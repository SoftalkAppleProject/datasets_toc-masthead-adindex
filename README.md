Softalk Magazine: The TOC, Masthead, and Advertiser Index Corpus - Work In Process
==================================================================================

Project: **The Softalk Apple Project**  
URL: **http://www.SoftalkApple.com**  
Internet Archive collection: **https://archive.org/details/softalkapple**

This repository contains the Softalk magazine (Apple edition) Table of Contents
(TOC), Masthead, and Advertisers Index Corpus as a dataset.

The **images** subdirectory contains the full-resolution individual page images
for each of the 91 pages that contain one or more of the document structures
included in this dataset. The **djvu_text** directory contains both the djvuXML
and djvu text files generated by the Internet Archive during the stock
digitization process. The **magpage** directory -- currently containing
incomplete work-in-process files -- will collect the files in MAGAZINE and PAGE
format as part of the (upper) **\#GroundTruth** edition of the corpus.

The **scripts** directory includes Python scripts used to generate the text and
CSV files for the masthead staff and Ad Index structures within this corpus.
Please note for non-developers, both the staff and ad gathering scripts expect
to be run via the command-line with the source and output directories (in this
order) supplied as arguments. Developers extending these scripts will need to
provide the required command-line parameters as part of their project run/debug
configuration.

A manifest Excel spreadsheet -- and its equivalent in CSV, JSON, and XML formats
-- is provided.
