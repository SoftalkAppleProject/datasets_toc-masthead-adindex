This repository contains the Softalk magazine (Apple edition) Table of Contents (TOC), Masthead, and Advertisers Index Corpus as a dataset with validating screenshots. 

A manifest Excel spreadsheet -- and its equivalent in CSV, JSON, and XML formats -- are provided together with a set of "upper" #GroundTruth TEI/XML files that model Softalk's complex magazine structure. In addition, screenshots of the TOC/masthead/adIndex pages, as they appeared in the magazine, and as scanned into the Internet Archive are provided.
