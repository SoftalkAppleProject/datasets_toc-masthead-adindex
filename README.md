This repository contains the Softalk magazine (Apple edition) Table of Contents (TOC), Masthead, and Advertisers Index Corpus as a dataset. The images subdirectory contains the full-resolution page images. The djvu_text directory contains both the djvuXML and djvu text files generated by the Internet Archive during the stock digitization process. The magpage directory -- currently empty -- will collect the files in MAGAZINE and PAGE format as part of the upper #GroundTruth edition of the corpus.

A manifest Excel spreadsheet -- and its equivalent in CSV, JSON, and XML formats -- is provided.
