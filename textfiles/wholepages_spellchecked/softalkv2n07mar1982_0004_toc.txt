THE FIRST GREAT APPLE TRIVIA CONTEST

BY CHRISTOPHER U. LIGHT AND CHRIS LIGHT JR.

What better way to celebrate the spring equinox than with a chance to win a second Apple disk drive? The Chris Lights, junior and senior, have collaborated on a very special Apple trivia quiz to make sure you’ll have earned the disk drive if you win it.
You’ll have until June 15, 1982, to get your answers back to Softalk. Take care and be precise. In case of apparent ties, more precise answers will win over less precise answers before chance steps in.
If no one gets all the answers to Ap-pletrivia correct, that entry with the most correct answers will win. In the case of a tie, the random number generator will be called into play. Second place winner may choose $50 worth of prizes from goods created by Softalk advertisers. Third, fourth, and fifth places each win an extra year's free subscription to Softalk. And don’t forget that all
entrants are, by virtue of entering, entitled to subscribe to Softalk at the $18 sponsored rate.
So fill out the entry form on this page and mail it and your answers—printed, computer printed, or typed, but legible— to Softalk Appletrivia, 11021 Magnolia Boulevard, North Hollywood, CA 91601.

Now, with a new disk drive for the taking, here is the First Great Apple-trivia Contest.
Although some of the questions appear to be devilishly hard—as they’re intended to be—all questions are in one way or another related to the Apple computer, peripheral hardware for it, software for it, or material written about it. All sources for the questions have been circulated nationally and have been generally available at one time or another. Just because you own an Apple, you’ll already know some of the answers. Other answers will require considerable effort. Good luck!
