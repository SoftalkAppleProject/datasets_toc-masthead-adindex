CONTEST:
ORACLE '83

You’ve all been waiting for it, and it’s finally here—the monster contest to end all monster contests (for 1982, anyway). Yep, it’s Oracle ’83, the contest that awards six prizes throughout the year and one biggie at the beginning of 1984. But best of all, the grand prize winner will be named the Softalk Oracle of 1983, a title coveted by 16K and 128K users alike.
Whether you’re a Basic bungler or a machine language maestro makes no difference— everyone has an equal chance at doing well or bombing.
For you newcomers in the gallery who don’t know what’s going on, sit back down and read the rules.
Rules: None.
There are no rules; they’re too confining. Just look at what we want you to predict and do the best you can. Point values are listed to help you decide how much time to spend working on each one.
List your predictions on a sheet of paper and send them in to us postmarked before midnight of December 31, 1982. No exceptions! Don’t forget to include your name, address, phone number, the name of your dealer, and your signature.
Prizes: Should you hit any of the predictions on the nose or come closer than anyone else, a good feeling of success should be enough. But, in case it isn’t, we’re going to award $100 worth of products made by Softalk advertisers to the winner of each part. Keep your eyes glued to these pages for announcements of winners.
The person who winds up the year with the highest cumulative score will win the “biggie” we mentioned earlier: Apple’s next personal model computer. Not a II, not a III, but Apple’s next personal computer, whatever it is, brand spanking new!
In addition to the prizes, you’ll have bragging rights in all Appledom as the Softalk Oracle of 1983. So get going and have a blast! The Oracle ’83. Predict the following:
1.	The day and month Apple will officially announce the release of a new personal model Apple computer, or predict that they won’t. In case they should release more than one new model in 1983, only the first one counts. —1 point for every day off the mark; —365 if they announce one and you said they wouldn’t (watch yourself).
2.	The teams to make the Final Four in the NCAA Basketball Tournament. +5 points for each team; -5 for each wrong guess. +10 bonus points if you predict the winner of the tournament.
3.	Who will win the Academy Awards in the categories of best actor, actress, and picture. + 10 points for each; +20 bonus points for getting all three correct.
4.	The sex, region of origin (East, Midwest, West, South, Foreign), and winning time of the winner of the Kentucky Derby. +1 point for a colt, +20 points if it’s a filly, -10 points if you blow it; +5 points for region; -1 point for every 1/5-second off the time; +25 bonus points for naming the horse; +15 bonus points for naming the jockey (whew!).
5.	Flags fly high on the Fourth of July. People and temperatures get high then, too. What do you predict the high temperature will be in San Jose, California, on July 4, 1983? -1 point for each degree Fahrenheit off the mark.
6.	The earliest presidential candidacy declarations for Republican and Democratic parties made by September 30, 1983. +10 points per valid declarer; -5 points for everyone you name who doesn’t declare by then.
7.	The five companies that will appear most frequently in Softalk"s Top Thirty throughout 1983. +5 points per company; +20 bonus points for guessing the correct number of appearances of the top company.
