CONTEST:
APPLEETYMOLOGY

Ever wonder how gruds and gleep-noks got their names? Or where Oo-Topos is located? Or what the derivation of Snoggle is? We don’t know, but we do know that there are a lot of words and names in Appledom whose geneses are obscured by our immediate association of them with our microcomputers. Some of their origins lie in history; some are as close as your pocket dictionary.
For example, more often than not, when someone says “integer,” we think first of a high-level language rather than of the numbers, -1, 0, 1, 2, and so on, just as “novation” conjures images of modem hardware, rather than the legal substitution of contracts or agreements.
This month’s contest will help you remember (or teach you, if you don’t already know) where some of these Apple-associated names came from. Below are twenty riddles. The object is to figure out the word or words referred to by the clues. Some of the answers are the names of software products, some are the names of companies related to Apples, and others are simply Apple-related proper names.
Some of the clues are definitions of the answers; others are definitions of words that themselves are clues to the answers. So if you think you have solved the given clue but it just doesn’t make sense, then push on further.
Each puzzle is worth at least two points; one for the answer to the clue, and one for the name of the product, company, or proper name it refers to. Answers that require two clues being solved are worth three points. Make sure you give complete names in your final answer, and that they’re spelled correctly. Incomplete or misspelled answers won’t count.
Example:
a)	Henry Ford’s and assembler.
Answers: assembly line, Assembly
Lines: The Book (2 points). “Assembly lines,” or “Assembly Lane,” as a final answer would not be acceptable.
b)	Spike and Snoopy.
Answers: beagle brothers, Beagle Bros (2 points). As a final answer, “Beagle Brothers” wouldn’t count, as the correct spelling is “Bros.”
The winner will receive $100 in goods from Softalk advertisers. In case of a tie, contestants will be churned through Apple’s random number generator. The lone survivor will be the winner.
A prize worth $50 will be awarded if someone makes an equally good case for an alternate answer or answers to those intended; in the event of more than one such entry, that deemed cleverest and most reasonable by Softalk's contest
staff will take this consolation prize.
1)	Imagine flying in your spacecraft through some saw-toothed mountains.
2)	The Romans worshipped her at cockcrow. Sleepytime girl?
3)	These sentries are definitely ahead of their time.
4)	A pattern of horizontal lines that form on a television screen when no signal is received. Especially visible if one tilts slightly.
5)	This Titan stole fire from the heavens and gave it to mankind. I read it in a chain letter.
6)	A large keyboard instrument with steam whistles, found in most carnivals and amusement parks.
7)	Hi! I’m Peggy. Fly me to Coarse-gold.
8)	Computer gaming, in Brazzaville?
9)	Lassie was one. So is Benji.
10)	The air defense in North America neither takes nor adds to its power.
11)	Having lived alone in the Arabian desert for over five hundred years, this creature burned itself, only to rise again—but in Illinois?
12)	German sausage? We’re stalking to kill about two thousand pounds’ worth.
13)	Like 1+1=3, for example.
14)	In the valley, carries twice the weight as N.
15)	Five shillings for a hard day’s work.
16)	A remarkable historic period. Like the era of the confused pharaoh.
17)	In theory, what protons are made of. Just ask Richard Benjamin or Chris Jochumson.
18)	Describes an alien creature that is intelligent, feeling, aware. Even if he’s half ’n’ half.
19)	When translated into Greek, the name of the main character in an adventure game becomes the name of the main character in a Greek literary work—the title of which is the name of another adventure. Whew!
20)	You can get stoned with this woman of serpentine hair, but don’t get carried away.
