Famous Apples in History

Luisa Puig, the computer operator who plays Queen Elizabeth I in the Renaissance Pleasure Faire in California, suggested recently that if Queen Bess had been told about microcomputers, “The first thing she would have asked is how much does it cost and what does it do? She was a very executive woman. If someone could prove that computers would be much more cost effective for the royal scribes and mathematicians, she would have wanted at least three—two for the palace and one for Lord Burley, the treasurer.
“Elizabeth would have done just fine in a corporate job in this century.”
Now, if Puig had quoted Liz instead of telling about her, and if she’d thrown in an Elizabethan dialect and maybe put it all in iambic pentameter, she’d have an ideal entry for this month’s Softalk contest.
Famous Apples in History challenges you to imagine an encounter between some famous person in history and an Apple, where the Apple and its accouterments (software, for example) are the only anachronisms in the situation. Write down what the famous person would have said in your imaginary situation, and try to make the quotation appropriate to the era and circumstance; finally, try to make it possible to guess from the quote who’s speaking.
Length is up to you, so long as it’s no more than a page, double-spaced. One line is plenty, if it fills all the requirements.
Here are some examples; who they represent is printed upside down at the bottom of this page.
1.	“Contrary to what I have proclaimed, I see the Almighty has made a set of men that do all the eating and none of the work, and has made them with mouths only and no hands!”
2.	COMMAND? IGNITE ROMA
YOU DON’T HAVE ANY MATCHES COMMAND? ACQUIRETE IGNIUM
OK
COMMAND? IGNITE ROMA OH WHY DON’T YOU GO PLAY YOUR VIOLIN?
3.	"Boot up my campaign again and see what happens if the second army takes the left flank, the third the rear,
and . . .”
4.	Heard during a nineteenth-century game of Computer Bismarck: “Damn the torpedos! Full speed ahead!”
5.	“So this is the Apple that fell on Isaac’s head. No wonder he’s been so down to earth lately.”
6.	To boot or not to boot: that is the
question:
Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of syntax error, Or to take reset against a break in 512 And by opposing crash them.
7.	He lit a cigarette.
The thing would not boot. Its time of booting was over. He remembered the times before. They were happy times. It had booted everything he had. It had been young and strong and its chips were clean and they worked quietly and well, with no smoke. It was old now. Those times were past. "I am sorry, machine,” he said. “Tomorrow I must trade you. It is all that is left.” The machine said nothing. A light rain was falling. It began to rust.
Entries will be judged by historical ring of truth, probability, wit, and general quality of method of meeting requirements.
Include the name of the famous person you’re quoting on your entry in case we're dense.
$100 worth of Softalk advertisers’ products is the first-place prize. Two runners-up will win $25 gift certificates at their local computer stores.
Fill out the entry form or a facsimile and send it with your entry on a separate but-attached piece of paper to Softalk History, 11021 Magnolia Boulevard, North Hollywood, CA 91601. Deadline is July 16, 1982. Every entry must have the entry form information on it or with it and there may be no more than ten entries per envelope.
