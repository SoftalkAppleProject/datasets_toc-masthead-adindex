Contest: Poultry Panic!
or A Time To Gather Gobblers (turn, turn,turn)

No, the cover of this issue has absolutely nothing to do with Softalk employees. Well, okay, maybe a little. You see, we were planning to have the First Annual Softalk Thanksgiving Banquet right before the Applefest in San Francisco at the end of this month. The guest list included everyone who works at Softalk, our columnists, and a few derelicts who hang out at the hamburger joint across the street.
If you know us like we know us, you know that we just love to eat. So, we went out to the local North Hollywood turkey farm and traded them some magazines and BasiCalc disks for a whole bunch of turkeys—enough for everyone to have at least two. An even trade, wouldn’t you say? Then, Softalk's construction department got right to work and built a turkey pen to hold the little gobblers until we were ready to eat.
For your viewing pleasure, here they are, all one hundred and.. . . Hey, wait a minute. Some of them have escaped! Most of them have escaped! Word has it that our trustworthy, yet hungry, writers saw some of them strutting around and began to hoard them, stashing most of them away in their columns. Boy, as if an invitation to this epicurean extravaganza wasn’t enough!
If we can’t recover the birds, we’re all going to go hungry.
So, we’re calling on you to give us some assistance. Help us round up the turkeys that got away, and you’ll be handsomely rewarded. All you have to do is peruse the magazine and capture any stray turkeys you see aimlessly tiptoeing through the typefaces. Once you think you’ve caught them all, count them up and submit your tally to us.
Whoever catches all the turkeys will be eligible to win $100 in goods made by Softalk advertisers.
Here are the rules:
1.	Any photographs of turkeys don’t count. We’re just looking for escaped hi-res roasters like the ones on this page.
2.	Then, to make sure you have the right total, add the number of turkeys you captured to the number of turkeys on this page. We’re looking for the total number of turkeys before the massive breakout.
3.	In the case of more than one correct entry, the names of those who tie will go into the Random Sandwich Generator. Whoever is able to make the most turkey sandwiches from leftovers will be the winner. The RSG will oversee this part of the contest in all its awful majesty, cruel and magnificent.
That’s all there is to it. So, get going and have a ball!
