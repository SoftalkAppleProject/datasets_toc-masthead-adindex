CONTEST:
DIG THE DECADES

The conglomeration of people picnicking on pages 136 and 137 represents some of the outstanding personalities of three decades, 1952 through 1982. Most would be known to anyone at all familiar with those eras; a few require some acquaintance with the Apple world.
The person who names correctly the greatest number of pictured people will win $100 worth of Softalk's advertisers products. In case of a tie, the random number generator will labor again.
Fill in each number on the entry list with the name of the person whose caricature on pages 136 and 137 corresponds to the numbered outline on the drawing on this page.
Be sure that your answers also correspond to the list of anagrammed names that follows. The list is given as an assist but it also acts as a check to be sure you choose the correct name in the event that a person goes by more than one.
The best way to proceed is to note the people you recognize immediately; then find the anagrams corresponding to their names and cross them off. When you’re stumped on faces, begin solving the remaining anagrams, looking then to fit the names you discover with the faces.
Deadline for entries is June 15, 1982.
Good luck.
Send this entry form or a facsimile with your answers to Softalk Caricatures, 11021 Magnolia Boulevard, North Hollywood, CA 91601, by June 15, 1982.
