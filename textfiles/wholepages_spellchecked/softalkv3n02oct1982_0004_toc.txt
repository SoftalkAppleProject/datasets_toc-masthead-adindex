Contest:
The Significant
Figure

First there was Rocky III. Then came Friday the 13th, Part 3. Star Wars fans already have their eyes set on summer 1983 for Revenge of the Jedi. From the looks of things, sequels to sequels are doing pretty darn well, so the Softalk contest staff is trying their hand at it.
As deadline approached we found the contest staff still patting themselves on the back for last month’s Shapes contest when they realized it was time to think up another. So we hosed them down; shut them inside their cage with a few pads of paper, some pencils, and an abacus; and they came up with this month’s contest, the third Unknown A.
(The cage, in fact, was not to keep in the puzzle staff but to keep out the furious art director who actually invented September’s contest.)
It seems rather appropriate, since the last few contests have been focused toward our more literary-minded readers, that we address ourselves to another group, the mathematically inclined. The Significant Figure will be a delight for some, a nightmare for others. One staffer tried for two hours to solve the puzzle and went into shock. Recovery is slow; he can now recognize his shadow and eat solid foods.
How to play:
1.	First, determine the values of the letters by figuring out the clues.
2.	Next, plug the values into that hideous looking formula to find out what the mysterious A is. (Don’t forget your Apple’s built-in math functions.)
3.	Those who correctly solve the Unknown A III will be stuffed into the random number generator (yes, it’s back again), which will yank out a winner. That lucky person wins $100 worth of goods made by Softalk advertisers.
4.	For go-getters, there’s more. Once you get the A, explain its significance. Explanations must be more than two words, but not more than A words. Again, if there are ties, the beloved RNG will work overtime. The winner of this round will also win $100 worth of goods made by Softalk advertisers.
5.	Getting the significance without knowing the numerical value of A won’t win you a blooming thing.
6.	Tips. The only real tips we can give you are:
a)	The answer A is significant in the microcomputer industry in general.
b)	Were it not for A, you probably wouldn’t be doing this contest.
If you really get stuck, open your window and give us a call. We probably won’t be able to help that much, but you may recognize your shadow. Or we could crack some jokes, have a good time, and take your mind off the contest for a while. Good luck, and above all, have fun!
