CONTEST:
WHY NOT
KUMQUAT?

Last month we brought you the origins of some of those apparently off-the-wall names that companies give themselves and their products, but one name was suspiciously missing. Apple! What the heck is this magazine all about, anyway?
How anyone can use an Apple and not wonder where the name came from is beyond us. This month’s contest invites you to provide an answer. Quite simply, tell us your version of how the Apple got its name.
If you’ve read articles about the Apple or its creators in other newspapers, magazines, or journals, you probably have an idea of how Woz and Jobs decided on such a whimsical name for such a fanciful creation. Forget them. We're not interested in truth for this contest; we want to see how creative you can be.
For those of you with a creative flair who missed out on last November’s Art Gallery contest because: (a) you weren't a Softalk reader back then, (b) you can’t draw, or (c) you thought HGR meant “handy game routines,” here’s your chance to shine.
And we do mean shine. Really let yourself go! If you’re good with rhymes, you might write your answer in a poem, a song (include sheet music, if you like), a limerick, or a sonnet done in iambic pentameter. Monologues, dialogues, essays, and dramatic scenarios are equally acceptable. Whatever form you decide on, decide fast, because September 15 is coming up soon, and that’s when all en-
tries must be in the mail.
This month the random number generator gets a rest; Softalk's contest staff will judge all entries and come up with one winner. Entries will be judged on imagination and creativity. (In the case of a tie, the contest staff will fight it out.)
The winner will receive $100 worth of goods from Softalk advertisers, to be collected at the winner’s local computer store.
Entries must be at least twenty-five words long, but not longer than two double-spaced pages. If you can’t type (via printer or typewriter), then print neatly. Verrry neatly. We can’t be responsible if we can’t read your writing.
Sound like fun? You bet. So get those creative juices flowing, and send us your fantasy version of why your computer isn’t a Kumquat II Plus.
All entries must be postmarked by midnight, September 15, 1982.
