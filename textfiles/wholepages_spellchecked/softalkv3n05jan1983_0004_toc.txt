CONTEST:
Save the Subheads

Nobody likes to see a good line go to waste. Consider the lowly subhead—those bold little catch phrases placed in a story or column in every issue of Softalk. They’re designed to catch your eye, maybe amuse you, help you grasp an idea, and generally move a story along.
Here’s One Now. We write about a hundred of them per issue. Some are gems, some are duds, some are just odd. We think the good ones are worth repeating.
Live and Let Die. But we don’t want just to pick them up and drop them in the next issue; that would be cheating. There’s nothing worse than a pirated subhead. However, if we don’t recycle them, that would be wasteful. Why, those little phrases just can’t win. You see, they’re not really essential to any story. One subhead can easily be replaced by another. Also, after it’s been used once, it’s too old to be used again. The baby seals of Softalk.
Not Fade Away. Yes, the life of a subhead is short; it’s a life of “shine once, then perish.” For some, that’s good. For others, a shame.
But it doesn’t have to be that way.
Oh Boy, a Contest. Here’s your chance to help save the subheads from meeting a premature death. Give them a chance to live a little longer before they go to that great word processor in the sky. All you have to do is write a short story using as many of the subheads in this issue and any other issue of Softalk as well as you can. Any kind of story—as long as it has something to do with our lovable Apples.
Volume and Variety. The rules are simple: use as many as you can, although entries will also be judged on story value, cleverness of subhead use, and wit. If you get greedy, you can also use the headings to the letters in Open Discussion.
Read This. Stories can be as long as five typewritten, double-spaced pages. That means a blank line between lines. We’re serious on that rule. Very serious.
And This, Too. Finally, underline every occurrence of a subhead in your story. Also, to keep everyone straight, you must put the issue date and page number for the source of each
original subhead above the subhead in question. We realize it’s extra work, and it’s not fair to the honest people. It’s too bad that just a few had to ruin it for the whole class.
Final Notes. The winner of this competition will win the customary $100 worth of stuff made by Softalk advertisers and will hold the title of Softalk Subhead Savior of 1983. Remember, no copying off your neighbor’s papers, and neatness counts. Here’s an example:
Sometimes he thought he’d rather be bored (Dec. ’82, p. 46) than sit around solving the riddles of space and time. When that became too much to look at, he knew he’d better start looking to get out (Dec. ’82, p. 60).
That’s why he was going to call Colette and confess.
It would be rescue by remote resource (Dec. ’82, p. 308), he quipped to himself as he dialed.
“Hello?”
He felt luminously lucky (Dec. ’82, p. 250) she was in. “Hello, Colette? This is Frank. Whatcha doing?”
“Well, my Apple IX just arrived, and the gang’s all here (Dec. ’82, p. 105).
Well, we could go on and on, but you get the idea of how this is supposed to work. Of course, yours will be somewhat longer and have a beginning, middle, and ending to it.
Send in your entry with this coupon to: Softalk Subs, Box 60, North Hollywood, CA 91603. Postmark deadline is February 15, 1983, the day after Valentine’s Day.
