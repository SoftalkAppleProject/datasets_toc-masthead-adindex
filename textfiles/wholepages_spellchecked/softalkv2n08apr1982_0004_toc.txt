CONTEST: MAN ON THE MOON

You don’t have to complete the crossword puzzle on page 4 to win this contest; the required answer is the phrase at the end and its identification. But you’ll need to solve some of the puzzle to know what goes in the phrase.
The shaded letters in the puzzle ana-
gram to produce a famous quote. The quote relates to another extremely significant achievement that has affected the way of the world. To win the contest, you must solve this quote correctly, then identify who said it, the circumstances under which it was said, and the significance of those circumstances.
Except for the final sentence, every answer in Man on the Moon has to do with outer space or the U.S. space program.
Man on the Moon is our second puns ’n’ anagrams puzzle; the answers are easy but the questions aren’t. The clues are maliciously designed to be tricky and misleading, even though they often contain more than one definition and they always contain at least two hints each to the answer.
The hints may be of any sort. For example, the actual answer may be contained in the clue, except that the letters are mixed up, and you’ll need to anagram them: “camp case” hides an anagram of space. Or the answer may be hidden: “Jim’s pa ceded his land.”
The clue may be a pun: “The vet spays dogs throughout the universe.” or a charade: “room for a well-paid veteran weight lifter”—room = space, well-paid veteran = pro, weight (lifter is just to confuse you) = gram; put them together to get space program.
Each clue contains a real definition of the answer, which may be either definitive, descriptive, or exemplar but it may be of any meaning of the word, not necessarily of the meaning pertaining to space. A clue for the word space might contain a definition such as room, interstice, area, emptiness; Venus might be defined as planet, goddess, through the veins (venous), like an Italian city (Venice). The last two required translating the pun as well.
Throughout the puzzle, you’ll find shaded squares with small letters in the lower left comers. The answer letters that go in these squares are the letters that make up the phrase beneath the puzzle. The small letters indicate which word of the phrase the answer letter belongs in. The letters for each word must be anagrammed to find the phrase. The blanks have purposely not been punctuated; you need not punctuate the phrase, but do not assume it shouldn’t have punctuation.
Again, winning the contest does not require that you finish the puzzle, only that you correctly solve for the phrase and identify it completely. However, if you do complete the puzzle, you’re eligible for additional prizes.
The winning entry will choose $100 worth of Softalk advertisers’ goods at the local computer store. In case of a tie, the random number generator will choose the winner.
Five correct entries that also contain correct completed puzzles will receive copies of Crossword Magic, the program from L&S Software with which the puzzle was generated. If there are more than five correct puzzles submitted, the five winners will be chosen by the random generator.
Fill out the entry blank and send it to Softalk Moon, 11021 Magnolia Boulevard, North Hollywood, CA 91601, by May 15, 1982.
Send this form or a facsimile to Softalk Moon, 11021 Magnolia Boulevard, North Hollywood, CA 91601, by May 15, 1982. To be eligible to win copies of Crossword Magic, include the completed puzzle.
