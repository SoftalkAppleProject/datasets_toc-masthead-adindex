CONTEST:
Final Exam

Good afternoon, class. We’re all anxious to go home and pack our bags for Hawaii, Europe, Greece, or wherever we’re planning to go for summer vacation, but nobody leaves this room until everyone’s taken the final examination.
The test covers the following subjects: history, folklore, literature and humanities, mathematics, anatomy, and general knowledge.
It’s really simple. All you have to do is read the questions, write your answers on a separate sheet of paper, and send it in. And, just to keep everyone in the competitive spirit, we’ll award $100 worth of Softalk advertisers’ goods to the person who ends up with the highest score.
Here are a few guidelines for the test:
1.	Many of the answers can be found within the confines of your computer room. Others have appeared in books and national publications (Softalk, Newsweek, Time, Wall Street Journal, Mad). If you think you have a correct answer, but you’re not sure your source is the same as ours, be sure to list your source of information with your answer.
2.	The test can be a team effort. Work with your family, friends, pets, and local computer store if you like. The more help you get, the better you’ll probably do. Visit your computer store. If you have to, go over to Steve Jobs’s house and interview him. Your final grade is limited only by your creativity and resourcefulness. Go for it.
3.	Some sections have two questions per number. In these cases, the first question (24a, for example) is for students with the Apple II or II Plus. The second question (24b, for example)
is for students with the IIe. Apple III students will have to trek down to their computer stores.
If you have a IIe, you don’t have to answer the question for the II, and vice versa. If you have a III, you can answer either question.
Questions with several parts to them (a—e, for example) are to be answered by everybody.
4.	All questions are worth 5 points each, except where noted. There is a total of 157 points possible.
5.	Write your answers on a sheet (or sheets) of paper, with answers appearing by their corresponding numbers.
6.	On the bottom left-hand comer of the envelope, indicate which test you’re taking II, IIe, or III.
That’s all there is to it. Please do not begin the test until you see the word go. You must turn in your test so that it’s postmarked by July 10, 1983. Please include the following information on your test form:
Name:___________________________________
Address:________________________________
City, State, Zip:_______________________
Phone number ___________________________
My local dealer:________________________
What I’d like to win:___________________
Send your exam to Softalk (Con)Test, Box 60, North Hollywood, CA 91603, postmarked by July 10, 1983. Go\
