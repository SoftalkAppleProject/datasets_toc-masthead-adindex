Contest: ASCII RR

Alan Nayer was a close runnerup for first prize in the Contest Contest with his contest, ASCII Railroad. It’s a word game and a number game and a computer game all rolled into one. And it’s hard.
First prize in the contest will be $100 worth of the Softalk advertisers’ products of your choice. Up to five runnersup will win an extra year’s free subscription to Softalk. In case of ties, the Apple random number generator will determine the winner and the runnersup.
Beginning with this month, all sincere contest entrants who were not already eligible for the $18 subscription rate for Softalk will become so by virtue of their entry in a contest.
Deadline for the contest is March 15, 1982.
Here are the rules for ASCII Railroad, as Alan Nayer wrote them.
Fill each of the 27 ‘‘railroad cars” in the chart with a decimal digit. Each pair of digits forms the decimal representation of an ASCII code. Except for the first and last digit, each pair of digits overlaps with its neighbor; the second digit of a number is also the first digit of the next number.
Clues may relate to the meaning a character has in one of Apple’s languages or operating systems, the character name (nul, soh, and so on), or the character itself. Sometimes, poetic license was used, or even abused. Remember: the digit pairs are the decimal, not hexadecimal representation, and the code 0 through 9, when used, should contain a leading zero.
Here is a brief example (with answers):
A.	Some languages prefer this as the literal delimiter (the apostrophe character ’ which is decimal 39)
B.	Enticement to a horse (carrot. . . carat or 94)
C.	Basic subscript delimiter (end parentheses, 41)
D.	Its name is a holdover from the typewriter (CR, 13)
A.	Alarm clock for DOS
B.	Footnote
C.	Underwater vessel (abbr)
D.	Prompt character
E.	Computerized eraser
F.	Arithmetic operator
G.	Realistic minimum number of drives for Pascal
H.	Oops!
I.	Golfers need this to boot up
J.	Immediate AND opcode
K.	New England state (abbr)
L.	Down, but not back
M.	Hara-kiri in Pascal
N.	Hara-kiri in Basic
O.	Pascal default exec delimiter
P.	Innocent exclamation
Q.	Spanish affirmative
R.	Statement separator
S.	Second person singular or plural
T.	Default maxfiles
U.	There’s more than one way to go home
V.	Half of our northern neighbor
W.	Like F
X.	String suffix
Y.	It prints in Applesoft
Z.	It’s NOT in Integer; it’s not in Applesoft

Jumbled Jumble Extends Deadline
Any of you who sailed through most of last month’s Apple Jumble only to be stumped on Hector Plagbits can quit pulling out your hair. Yes, old Plagbits suf-
fers from a typo. His name should read: Hectar Plagbits
That’s Hectar with an a instead of an o.
Because of our error and your torn fingernails, the deadline for Apple Jumble entries is extended to March 1, 1982
