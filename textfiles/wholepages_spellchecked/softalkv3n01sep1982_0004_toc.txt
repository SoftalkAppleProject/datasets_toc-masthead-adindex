CONTEST:
The Great
Name-the-Shape
Table
Game

Well, summer’s over and it’s time for the kids to get back to school, grown-ups to get back to work, and everyone to get back around the television for weekend football excitement on the gridiron.
And speaking of grids, look at the one on this page; pretty dull, isn’t it? Now look at pages 144 and 145 in this issue. What you see there are shapes of items you might find around the house, in your Apple, or pretty much anywhere. Some of them are darn obvious, others are not so obvious. Aha! Instant contest.
Your task this month is to figure out what in the world those shapes are. Study the silhouettes on pages 144 and 145. Each one has a corresponding number on the dull-looking grid on this page. After deciding what the shapes represent, write down your answers on a piece of paper numbered from 1 to 92.
The person who correctly identifies the most shapes will win absolutely nothing. However, that person will be entitled to select $100 worth of Softalk advertisers’ products for his Apple. In case of a tie, the random number generator is
also back from vacation to help decide the winner. Have fun!
