CONTEST: RHYMES WITHOUT REASON

Saint Patrick’s Day is just around the corner, but before you go pouring yourself a Bailey’s Irish Cream or sucking down a tall Bushmill’s, pull up a stool and have a giggle or two with us.
In honor of oP Pat the patron saint, we’re going to have some fun with limericks. You know what a limerick is, don’t you? It’s a light five-line verse that serves no other purpose than to be cute or humorous (depending on your sense of humor).
Limericks first appeared in England more than one hundred fifty years ago as a party game. The idea was to make up a nonsense five-line rhyme, after the recitation of which everyone sang a chorus that ended with the line, “Won’t you come up to Limerick?”
Well, parties like that tend to have a lot of drinking going on, and the more the spirits flowed, the more the spirits flew. Party animals of the Victorian variety. The drunker they got, the bawdier and sillier the verses became.
Of course, if we were just to have you all send in your favorite limericks, that would be boring. Besides, the unwritten laws of good taste would prohibit our printing most of them. So here’s the catch: each limerick must contain at least one reference to a product or its manufacturer that is advertised in this issue. Here’s an example from our last limerick contest:
My wife spent last week in the loft.
I know she’s alive; she just coughed.
She has found no new suitor;
It’s that Apple computer.
I’m afraid that she’s gone micro soft.
—Eric Marks (Mount Tabor, NJ)
My brother, named Ed, had a fight For a woman whose honor was bright. Asked he, “Was I wrong To ring that guy’s gong?”
“No,” I said, “Ed, you were right.”
—Mike Leavitt (Reston, VA)
The first example spells it right out in the last two words (Microsoft). Perfectly legal.
The second one virtually requires you to read the last line out loud to get the company’s name (Edu-Ware). Also legal, and a bit more subtle.
The subject of your limerick is up to you. It can be funny, witty, punny, or just plain silly. Clue: a good way to win is by making yours stand out in the crowd. Get crazy!
Limericks will be judged on cleverness, jazziness, and general toughness in figuring out what product or company you refer to in the limerick.
The winner of this contest will win $100 in booty made by advertisers in this issue, and finalists will win a month’s supply of Irish Spring.
Also, be sure to include this coupon or a facsimile of it:
