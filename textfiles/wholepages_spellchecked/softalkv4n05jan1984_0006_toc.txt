CONTEST: The Continuing Adventures of...

This month’s contest is very simple. What follows is an adventure game, just the way it would appear on the screen. To make things easier, we’ve taken the liberty of providing all the right commands to get you through the adventure as quickly as possible.
“Well, heck,’’ you’re probably thinking, “what’s the challenge?’’
The challenge is to read through the short adventure and figure out what the player was doing—in other words, what the adventure was about. Once you figure that out, write down what you think the adventurer was doing and send it in. That’s it! All you have to write is something like, “The adventurer was . . .’’ filling in the blank with a sentence or two. If necessary, you can follow that with a brief explanation of why you think that’s what the adventure was doing. Then give the adventure game a name, such as “Danger in Uh-oh Land,’’ or whatever suits your fancy.
Just a few rules. First, all entries must be on 8 1/2-by-11 -inch paper. No larger, no smaller. You shouldn’t need to use more than one sheet of paper, but if your entry is more than one page, then all pages must be stapled together. Your name, address, and phone number must be printed on each page of your entry. You can use a facsimile of the coupon on this page, but it’s more important that you write all the information on the entry.
A prize of $200 to be spent on Apple accessories made by Softalk advertisers will be awarded to the person who figures out correctly what the task of the adventure was. In the case of a tie, the snooty random number generator
(RNG) will send its butler to pick a winner by random drawing. All decisions are final (it figures).
Bonus! A special bonus prize worth $50 will be awarded to the contestant who turns in the most imaginative entry, right or wrong. So even if you can’t figure out what this adventure was about, you still have a chance to win. Any entry that gives a description of what was going on, as long as it is consistent with the action in the adventure, is eligible to win this bonus prize.
Entries must be postmarked by February 15, 1984. No exceptions.
Does this sound like just the kind of January fun that will kick off the new year right? Better believe it. So, get adventuring, figure out what the heck was going on, and send in your entry soon to Softalk Adventure, Box 7039, North Hollywood, CA 91605, postmarked by the day after Valentine’s Day.
