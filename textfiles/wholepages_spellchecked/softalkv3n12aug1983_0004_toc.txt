CONTEST:
Help Wanted

Did you know that before Ronald Reagan got into politics he was an actor? Of course you did. But did you also know that before that he worked as a counter person at Burger Palace? Probably not, since he didn’t. But you can just imagine his job resume: “President, United States of America, 1981-present; Governor of California, 1967-1975; order taker at Burger Palace in Dixon, Illinois, 1927-1930.” Okay, maybe not.
It works the same way in the microcomputer industry. Before a lot of people in this biz got where they are today, they held numerous other interesting jobs. What do you think they did back in the early seventies? It probably had little to do with Apples, since the word apple in those days meant pie and sauce, not PIE and SOS. Which brings us to this month’s contest.
On page 4, you’ll see a whole bunch of pictures of a whole bunch of people who make up the Apple world. On page 6 you’ll see a list of various positions they used to hold. Can you match the occupation with the person? Could you do it for $100 worth of Apple accessories? Good! Roll your tongue back into your mouth and let’s get started.
There are two ways to win.
The First Way. The first way is to match the person with the occupation. Just number your paper from one to twenty and write the corresponding person’s name next to each number. Next, find the occupation you think each person used to hold, and write down the letter that precedes it next to that person’s name. If you’d like to do this with a word processor or a typewriter so we can read your entry, the more power to you.
Whoever matches correctly the most people with their former occupations will become the Softalk Personnel Administrator of the month and will be entitled to a $100 shopping spree in the computer store of his or her choice. On us.
Most of the answers can be found in those Softalks you put on the top shelf many months ago (we don’t write the Exec series for nuth-in’!). Others can be found by a process of elimination (someone as young as Lord British couldn’t have been a former Vietnam commanding officer, for example). So get out the mags and get to it.
If you choose this way to win, print the words What they were on the front of your envelope and on your entry form. This way, you
won’t end up being scored in the wrong category.
The Second Way. This way is more fun; it’s for people who don’t have the resources for the first way to win. Some people just look like they might have held a certain job. Can’t you just picture Ken Williams as a country bar bouncer? Dave Gordon as a used car salesman? How about Bill Budge as a young Chachi (as in Joan-ie Loves. . .)?
Just number your paper from one to twenty with each person’s name by the number as before. Then, next to each name, put down a letter corresponding to the occupations you think they look like they might have held. If you don’t know, then guess; if you can’t guess, then make one up.
Entries in this category will be scored against the answer key made up by a consensus of the contest staff. Answers are purely subjective; no debating will be allowed.
The winner of this category will win the customary $100 in advertisers’ merchandise that we usually give away in these alternative contests.
If you choose this way to win, print the words What they should have been on your envelope and on your entry form.
It ought to be fun, and it will be. So send in your entry with the information below postmarked by September 15, 1983. You must write either What they were or What they should have been on your entry so that we know which category to judge you in.
Send your entries to Softalk Job Hunt, Box 60, North Hollywood, CA 91603, postmarked by September 15, 1983.
