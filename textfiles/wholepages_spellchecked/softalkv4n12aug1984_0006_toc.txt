CONTEST:
Computeytoons

Computers and the computer industry are exciting, expansive, explosive (figuratively, usually), competitive, and ingenious. Sometimes computers and the computer industry can be funny.
We like funny. We want your ideas of what’s funny in the computer world. We want you to submit pen-and-ink cartoons, like those in the editorial pages of your newspaper. Like those for which you read the New Yorker. Like those that made Oliphant a household name. If you’re artistic, give us art; if you’re not, give us minimalism. The pictures are the least of it when it comes to cartooning; we’re looking for
brevity, sophistication, and clarity, a blend of humor and commentary to grace the pages of Contest Winners. The ’toons should be at least obliquely related to computers.
Send us your three best attempts at computeytoons, drawn in black ink on three separate pieces of plain white paper. Computer-drawn entries are okay if they’re printed in black. You have until September 15, 1984, to submit your work. Specify the dream software (from Softalk's advertisers) that you covet, and send the whole hysterical package to Softalk Computeytoons, Box 7039, North Hollywood, CA 91605.
