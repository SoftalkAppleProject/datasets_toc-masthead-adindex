Picture this. Presentation-quality bar charts, line 
graphs, and pie charts. In black and white or color. On hard 
copy or a CRT. In seconds. 

That's PFS: GRAPH. The fastest, easiest, most econom- 
ical computer graphics software package you can buy. 

For the first time ever, computer graphics 
without computer programming. 

With GRAPH, all you do is enter your information and 
specify the kind of chart or graph you want. GRAPH does 
the rest. So instead of making a lot of complicated calcula- 
tions, you can make graphics. 

GRAPH is so straightforward, you can begin 
creating graphs and charts almost immediately. 
But it also has powerful capability you can stay 
with for years to come. 

For example, you can mix and match line and 
bar graphs, stack or compare up to four bar graphs 
simult^eously, even display as many as four 
graphs on the same set of axes. 

Software that pays for the system. 

Compared to hand-drawn graphics, GRAPH 
can save you enough money on your first set of 
overlays to pay for itself. And over the course of a 




few months, it could save you enough to pay for the 
Apple® computer system it works oa And that includes a 
Hewlett-Packard 7470A color plotter. 

It even works with VisiCalc® files. 

GRAPH is so flexible it allows you to work with raw 
data, other members of the PFS Series, or even VisiCalc files. 

No other computer graphics package gives you all this 
capability. Combine it with the beautiful simplicity of PFS 
for information management, and PFS: REPORT for infor- 
mation analysis, and you have a software family that works 
hard without being hard to work. 

So if you're Slinking about making it in pic- 
tures, go see PFS: GRAPH. It's at your computer 
dealer now. And if they don't have it, ask them to 
contact Software Publishing Corporation, 1901 
Landings Drive, Mountain View, CA 94043.

Contest: 



The Significant 
Figuie 



First there was Rocky III. Then came Fri- 
day the I3th, Part 3. Star Wars fans already 
have their eyes set on summer 1983 for Revenge 
of the Jedi. From the looks of things, sequels to 
sequels are doing pretty darn well, so the Sof- 
talk contest staff is trying their hand at it. 

As deadline approached we found the con- 
test staff still patting themselves on the back for 
last month's Shapes contest when they realized 
it was time to think up another. So we hosed 
them down; shut them inside their cage with a 
few pads of paper, some pencils, and an aba- 
cus; and they came up with this month's con- 
test, the third Unknown A. 

(The cage, in fact, was not to keep in the 
puzzle staff but to keep out the furious art di- 
rector who actually invented September's con- 
test.) 

It seems rather appropriate, since the last 
few contests have been focused toward our 
more literary-minded readers, that we address 
ourselves to another group, the mathematically 
inclined. The Significant Figure will be a de- 
light for some, a nightmare for others. One 
staffer tried for two hours to solve the puzzle 
and went into shock. Recovery is slow; he can 
now recognize his shadow and eat solid foods. 

How to play 

1. First, determine the values of the letters 
by figuring out the clues. 



2. Next, plug the values into that hideous 
looking formula to fmd out what the myste- 
rious A is. (Don't forget your Apple's built-in 
math functions.) 

3. Those who correctly solve the Unknown 
A III will be stuffed into the random number 
generator (yes, it's back again), which will yank 
out a winner. That lucky person wins $100 
worth of goods made by Softalk advertisers. 

4. For go-getters, there's more. Once you 
get the A, explain its significance. Explanations 
must be more than two words, but not more 
than A words. Again, if there are ties, the be- 
loved RNG will work overtime. The winner of 
this round will also win $100 worth of goods 
made by Softalk advertisers. 

5. Getting the significance without know- 
ing the numerical value of A won't win you a 
blooming thing. 

6. Tips. The only real tips we can give you 

are: 

a) The answer A is significant in the mi- 
crocomputer industry in general. 

b) Were it not for A, you probably 
wouldn't be doing this contest. 

If you really get stuck, open your window 
and give us a call. We probably won't be able to 
help that much, but you may recognize your 
shadow. Or we could crack some jokes, have a 
good time, and take your mind off the contest 
for a while. Good luck, and above all, have fun!

CONTINENTAL'S 
HOME ACCOUNTANT IS NUMBER ONE- 

AND CLIMBING 



For the past several months, Softalk magazine has 
rated Continental Software's Home Accountant^ " 
No. 1 in its "Home 10" best-seller list. 

A lot of programs would have "peaked" by 
now. But with over 10,000 copies in use, Home 
Accountant just keeps getting stronger. 

There's a reason for this spectacular suc- 
cess — and it's not just the low suggested price 
of $74.95. 

The fact is. Home Accountant is one of those 
rare programs that virtually everybody can profit 
from using. It's powerful enough to handle even 
the most complicated family budget — yet it's so 



easy to use that one quick trip through the manual 
may be all you'll ever need. 

With Home Accountant you can track up to 
100 budget categories, 5 different checking ac- 
counts, and all the credit cards you can carry Just 
press a few keys and watch the program print your 
checks, net worth and other financial statements. 
And when you see the full-color graphs of actual vs. 
budgeted expenses, trend line analyses, etc., you'll 
know you bought the best. 

See your Apple dealer soon for a demonstra- 
tion. And start watching your fortunes climb with 
Home Accountant*

Contest Winners 



Words— What Do They All Mean? We were 
going to give away the American Heritage Dic- 
tionary of the English Language as a bonus 
prize to the winner of the Apple Etymology 
contest, but from the looks of things, the win- 
ner already has one — and used it well! 

Congratulations, Charles S. Lewis (Rich- 
mond, Virginia); you are October's etymolo- 
gist, according to the Softalk contest staff. Lew- 
is got off to a fast start solving the first twelve in 
a row and held on for a strong finish, winding 
up with a sizzling forty-six out of fifty-one pos- 
sible points. 

Lewis, who doesn't spend a lot of time play- 
ing games and therefore isn't too familiar with 
them, found only "one or two puzzles to be 
really challenging." Oddly enough, almost half 
the answers involved Apple games and Lewis 
got them all. 

Softalk contests, it seems, are old hat 
around the Lewds household. Lewis is the cur- 
rent leader in the Oracle '82 contest, and his 
wife Elizabeth was the winner of part 1 of the 
Oracle '82. 

Let's hear it for Jeff Moyers (MoGaheys- 

The Miracle 
of 

InvisiTab 

This is the write-protection tab that won't let 
you save anything to disl< accidentally as 
long as you believe it's there. Should you 
forget and write over your disk . . . you have 
learned a valuable lesson. 

Handyl 
FunI 
Educationall 

The best thing about this wonder is that, 
should you later decide to write something to 
disk, you don't even have to remove it; just 
pretend the tab isn't there and save away. 

The Tab of the Pros 

No mere gadget, InvisiTab embodies the 
theoretical concept of write protection without 
actually using it. Police yourself. Learn user 
discipline. Be more aware of the 
consequences of your actions in a 
determinate universe. Experience the 
beginnings of real faith. 

InvisiTab. Don't even try it. 

Send no money to: 



ville, Virginia), who wins second prize for the 
most clever and reasonable alternate answer. 
Moyers did fairly well in his overall contest en- 
try, scoring forty-three points. "Deciding what I 
want if I win is harder than solving the con- 
test!" he wrote. But he will be most remem- 
bered in the annals of Softalk contests for his 
answer to "A pattern of horizontal lines that 
form on a television screen when no signal is re- 
ceived. Especially visible when one tilts 
slightly.": 

"The word horizontal can be defined as 
'parallel to the horizon,' and parallel in this case 
means 'having analogous qualities.' Therefore, 
horizontal actually means 'horizon.' The ho- 
rizon is also known as the 'visible' horizon or 
'apparent' horizon. The word visible is con- 
tained in the clue and apparent can be ana- 
grammed from 'a pattern.' If the numeral 1 
(one) is tilted slightly both to the right and to 
the left, since neither side is specified, it forms 
the Roman numeral V. Horizon K is a hi-res 
game from Gebelli Software." 

It wasn't really that complicated, Jeff, but 
your prize is on its way. 

Missed It by That Much. John Fratus 
(Hiram, Ohio) was the only person to figure out 
what five shillings in "Five shillings for a hard 
day's work" amounted to. "Five shillings is a 
crown," says Fratus, "and a hard day's work is 
a job. The name Stephen comes from crown, so 
we get Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple Com- 
puter." Actually, the name Stephen does come 
from the Greek Stephanos, meaning crown, but 
we doubt that's what Mr. and Mrs. Jobs had in 
mind when they named their child. 

Moyers also had an answer for "five shill- 
ings" that tells a little about where he goes when 
he has the munchies. "Five shillings is one quar- 
ter of a British monetary pound. A Quarter 
Pounder is a sandwich at McDonald's, as is the 
Big Mac. Big Mac is a program for the Apple 
that received at least one first-place vote in Sof- 
talk's Most Popular Program of 1981." Now we 
know whose vote that was. 

Pity Cary Hara (Hollywood, California), 
who might have squared off with winner Lewis 
in the random number generator arena. Hara 
supplied correct answers to all but two puzzles. 
Unfortunately, that's all he gave us, having left 
out answers to all the clues. Well, that wasn't 
all. Hara also included a sketch of praying 
hands with his entry. Better pray he reads the 
directions next time. All together now, one, two, 
three: awww. . . . 

David L. Kutzler's (Welch, West Virginia) 
answer to "Hi, I'm Peggy. Fly me to Coarse- 
gold" had us all on the double take: "Many of 
Sierra On-Line's games were inspired by Peg- 
gy, the daughter of the company's president"; 
which prompted Ken Williams to comment, 
"Did I miss something, Roberta?" 

Chris Wysocki (Brookfield Center, Con- 
necticut) thought fifteen shiUings sounded like a 



line from a Charles Dickens book. "Dickens 
lived in the Kensington section of London," he 
told us, and that was the inspiration for Ken- 
sington Microware. Sorry, mate. 

And finally, gusto guzzler Samuel Swersky 
(Rockville, Maryland) reported for "Imagine 
flying in your spacecraft through some saw- 
toothed mountains" that, after a few glasses of 
Milwaukee brews, "the white lines (in Beer Run) 
sure look like saw-toothed mountains." Good 
for a few yucks, but not good enough to win, 
Samuel. 

If this were Olympic competition, Fratus, 
Hara, Kutzler, Wysocki, and Swersky would all

ARE YOU STILL 
PRINTING 

wimour USING 

A MKRDBUFFER? 



WHY? 



USING YOUR COMPUTER 
TO DRIVE YOUR PRINTER 
ISAWASTEOf TIML 

While your printer is running, your 
computer is tied up . All you can 
do is twiddle your thumbs until 
the program is finished. 



MICROBUFFER Allows YOU 
TO PRINT AND PROCESS 
SIMULTANEOUSIY. 

You just dump your printing data 
directly to Microbuffer, whoosh!, 
and continue processing. 

Microbuffer accepts data as 
fast as your computer can send 
it. It first stores the data in its 
own memory buffer, then takes 
control of your printer. 

It's that easy. 

THERE IS A MICROBUFFER 
FOR ANY COMPUTER/PRINTER 
COMBINATION. 

Microbuffers are available in 
Centronics-compatible parallel 
or RS-232C serial versions. 



FOR APPLE II COMPUTERS, 
Microbuffer li features on-board 
firmware for text formatting and 
advanced graphics dump 
routines. Both serial and parallel 
versions have very low power 
consumption. Special functions 
include Basic listing formatter, 
self-test, buffer zap, and 
transparent and maintain modes. 
The 16K model is priced at $259 
and the 32K, at $299. 

FOR EPSON PRINTERS, Microbuffer 
is $159 in either an 8K serial or a 
16K parallel version. The serial 
buffer supports both hardware 
handshaking and XON-XOFF 
software handshaking at baud 
rates up to 19,200. Both inter- 
faces are compatible with Epson 
commands including Graftrax-80 
and Graftrax-80 -I- . Both are user- 
expandable to 32K. 

ALL OTHER COMPUTER/PRINTER 
COMBINATIONS are served by the 
in-line, stand-alone Microbuffers. 
(Pictured here, twice actual size.) 

Both serial and parallel ver- 
sions are expandable up to 256K. 



The serial stand-alone will sup- 
port different input and output 
baud rates and handshake pro- 
tocol. The 32K model starts at 
$299, $349 for 64K, and 64K add- 
ons (for up to a total of 256K) are 
just $179. 

SIMPUTOINSTAIL 

Microbuffer II is slot-independent. 
It will fit directly inside the Apple 
II in any slot except zero. 

Microbuffer for your Epson 
mounts easily in the existing 
auxiliary slot directly Inside the 
Epson printer. 

The stand-alone Microbuffer is 
installed in-line between virtually 
any printer and any computer. 

MICROBUFFER FROM 
PRACTICAL PERIPHERALS. 

When you think of how much 
time Microbuffer will save, 
can you afford to not have one?

A Contest 
That's Out of 
This World 




The following message arrived unattended in a slightly charred 
capsule that narrowly missed some of our more somnolent staff after 
crashing through the roof late one evening last month. 

So far, we've discerned that there's some sort of contest involved and 
it appears that there's some sort of prize for everyone. 

Readers' opinions on the nature of this artifact are requested.

At 5pinnaKer Software, we make edu- 
cational games that are actually fun. 

Because they're fun, your children will 
use them. Instead of letting them collect 
dust in the basement. 

And because your children use them, 
they'll be learning. And after all, isn't that 
what educational games are all about? 

Our games are educational, because 
you can't kid parents. 

As a parent, you're probably very con- 
cerned with how much time your Kids 
spend playing mindless video games. 

Sure, they're fun. But they don't do 
much more than develop reflexes and 
hand-eye coordination. Spinnaker 
games are different. 

All our games have true 
educational value. They 
help develop a child's 
learning skills. And thafs 
something your kids can 
take with them wherever 
they go. 

Our games are fua 
because you can't Kid Kids 

Kids like Spinnaker games for the 
same reasons they like roller coasters, 
going to the beach and ice cream 
sundaes. 

They're fun. Lots of fun. So much fun 
your kids will probably forget they're 
learning. 

Our games make the computer 
screen come to life. With colorful graph 
ICS, animation and sound. 

And they're easy to use. In fact a lot 
of our games are easy enough for kids 
who've never even used a computer 
before. 

How do we maKe our games both 
educational and fun? 

We're glad you asked. 

Educators and game programmers 
write our software. 

Educators, because they've been in 
the classroom and know how children 




learn. And what it takes to keep their 
interest. 

Qame programmers, because they 
know how to have fun with computers. 
These programmers give our games the 
high resolution graphics, animation and 
sound that make them so entertaining. 

And right now, we're introducing four 
new games that can be played on the 
most popular computers, Apple,® Atari,® 
and IBM® 

rirst there's EACEMAKER. Ifs for 
young computer users, kids ages 4-8. 
EACEMAKEf^ helps children improve 
memory and concentration and provides 
familiarity with the computer 

Another game for young 
users is STORY MACMIME. 
This game lets children 
ages S-9 write their own 
stories and see them 
acted out on the screen. 
STORY MAChlME helps 
children learn to write 
correctly and acquaints 
them with the keyboard. 
Our SNOOPER TROOPS™ 
detective series gives your child mys- 
teries to solve. As a Snooper Trooper, 
your child will have to do some dahng 
detective work, including crawling 
through dark houses and talking to mys- 
terious agents. 

Designed for kids ages 10 and older, 
SNOOPER TROOPS helps children learn 
to take notes, draw maps, classify infor- 
mation, and develops vocabulary and 
reasoning skills. 

All four games are available in stores 
today 

With Spinnaker products, you can rest 
easy knowing your children are spend- 
ing their time wisely 

So ask your retailer about the growing 
line of Spinnaker games. 

Because one of the smartest 
things parents can do is help their chil- 
dren learn.

printmate: 

136 COLUMNS OF WONDERFUL. 



"It's wonderful!" You'll hear those words 
a lot when your PrintMate 1 50 first 
arrives. Seems everyone has a favorite 
reason for loving it. The way it stream- 
lines billing. Prepares easy-to-read 
financial reports. Effortlessly produces 
correspondence— when you need it. 
In fact, PrintMate is ideally suited to just 
about any business application— even 
the ones you dream up yourself. 
Personal. Change type styles for em- 
phasis. Add bold headlines. Stretch out 
words for I M P A C T. PrintMate makes 
it easy to personalize your printing. And 
MPI's inexpensive application packages 
(called AP-PAKs) let you choose at least 
1 5 different type styles. Mix them on the 
same line, or tailor a new type style to 
suit your business image. All with a print 
quality that's great for correspondence. 
Flexible. PrintMate lets you select virtual- 
ly any type size, so you can print up to 
226 crisp characters on a single line. 
PrintMate accepts any width paper— 



from 3 to 15 inches. So it's wide enough 
for P&^L statements. Narrow enough for 
mailing labels. And perfect for every- 
thing in between. 

Versatile. With PrintMate's extensive 
graphics capabilities, you'll enhance 
sales reports with charts and graphs. 
Create characters for bulletin board an- 
nouncements, or clarify technical infor- 
mation with illustrations. Mix graphics 
with words in any combination. No other 
printer can match PrintA/Vate's graphic 
capabilities. The applications are as 
unlimited as your imagination. 
Fast. If you're concerned about printing 
speed, PrintMate 1 50 won't keep you 
waiting. With thruput of up to 366 lines 
per minute, it's one of the fastest small 
business printers anywhere. 
Inexpensive. Compared to other printers, 
MPI's suggested retail price of $ 1 245 for 
the PrintMate 1 50 is unbeatable. And it 
offers more features at this low price, 
too. 



No matter which small business system 
you use, PrintMate is the ideal compan- 
ion. You might say it's ingenious. You 
could say it's innovative. But after ex- 
periencing the 136-column PrintMate 
1 50, you'll probably say, "It's 
wonderful!" And you'll say it for years to 
come.

Turn your Apple into the world's 
most versatile personal computer. 



The SoftCard™ Solution. SoftCard 
turns your Apple into two connputers. 
A Z-80 and a 6502. By adding a Z-80 
microprocessor and CP/M to your 
Apple, SoftCard turns your Apple into 
a CP/M based machine. That means 
you can access the single largest body 
of microcomputer software in exist- 
ence. Two computers in one. And, the 
advantages of both. 

Plug and go. The SoftCard system 
starts with a Z-80 based circuit card. 
Just plug it into any slot (except 0) of 
your Apple. No modifications required. 
SoftCard supports most of your Apple 
peripherals, and, in 6502-mode, your 
Apple is still your Apple. 

CP/M for your Apple. You get CP/M 
on disk with the SoftCard package. It's 
a powerful and simple-to-use operating 
system. It supports more software 
than any other microcomputer operat- 
ing system. And that's the key to the 
versatility of the SoftCard/Apple. 



BASIC included. A powerful tool, 
BASIC-80 is included in the SoftCard 
package. Running under CP/M, ANSI 
Standard BASIC-80 is the most 
powerful microcomputer BASIC 
available. It includes extensive disk I/O 
statements, error trapping, integer 
variables, 16-digit precision, exten- 
sive EDIT commands and string func- 
tions, high and low-res Apple graphics, 
PRINT USING, CHAIN and COM- 
MON, plus many additional com- 
mands. And, it's a BASIC you can 
compile with Microsoft's BASIC 
Compiler 

More languages. With SoftCard and 
CP/M, you can add Microsoft's ANSI 
Standard COBOL, and FORTRAN, or 



Basic Compiler and Assembly Lan- 
guage Development System. All, more 
powerful tools for your Apple. 
Seeing is believing. See the SoftCard 
in operation at your Microsoft or Apple 
dealer. We think you'll agree that the 
SoftCard turns your Apple into the 
world's most versatile personal 
computer. 

Complete information? It's at your 
dealer's now. Or, we'll send it to you 
and include a dealer list. Write us. Call

HiWEN'T YOU HEARD 
OF THUNDERCLOCK PLUS ? 




If you want to put 
your Apple® to work — around the 
clock — Thunderclock Plus is the solution. Just plug it 
in and your programs can read the month, date, day of 
week and time — down to the second — in any of Apple's 
languages. So your Apple can do any number of tasks 
for you automatically In the office, the lab or at home. 

Most good software packages for business, data base 
management, communications and time management 
are made to read Thunderclock Plus. (It's compatible 
with DB Master,* Micro-Courier** and VisiDex^, to 
name a few). So no matter how you use your Apple now, 
Thunderclock Plus can make it a more versatile 
and efficient tool. 

For example, with business or communi- 
cations software, your Apple can auto- 
matically access a data base or send elec- 
tronic mail when the rates are lowest. 

In addition, Thunderclock Plus can 
organize your disk files. Our optional 
DOS-DATER™ software upgrades the 
regular DOS on your disks. So every 
time a program is saved or a file is modi- 
fied, the time and date, to the minute, 
are stored in the CATALOG with the file 
name. Now you can instantly know 
exactly when your files were last updated 



^ ^ V W^" Thunderclock Plus 

' can even give you a sense of 

security. Or just make your life a little easier. With our 
X-10 interface option and a BSR X-10* Home Control 
System, your Apple can turn on your lights, water your 
lawn . . .whatever you desire, according to schedules you 
create. It comes with our menu-driven SCHEDULER 
software. So it's easy to design and modify schedules 
that can run in the "background" while you have 
"hands-on" use of your Apple. 

Thunderclock Plus comes with a one-year warranty. 
Powered by on-board batteries, it runs accurately for up 
to four years without battery replacement. 
So now that you've heard of Thunderclock Plus, isn't 
it time you put your Apple to work — 
around the clock? See your dealer 
for a demonstration or contact us.

LODO 
DROPS PRICES 

Bigger volume and lower production costs now make Lobo high 
performance disk systems and accessories even more affordable 



There's probably nothing that would add 
more power and usefulness to your Apple than 
a bigger, faster disk. 

Now Lobo Drives offers a whole family of 
disk upgrade options— direct from the manu- 
facturer, at substaritial savings 
We cut out the middleman — not the quality. 

Make no mistake— Lobo's low prices are 
for highest quality, ultra-reliable systems. We 
take no shortcuts in design, manufacturing, 
testing, and burn-in. That's why Lobo system.s 
are probably the only ones you'll find anywhere 
with a 1 -year pans and labor guarantee. 

Lobo uses only Shugart or Seagate 
drives— the standards of the industry We put 
them in rugged metal cabinets, with heavy-duty 
fan-cooled power supplies and our own proven 
controllers and interfaces. 

So whether you want 8 " floppies, a 
Winchester system, or just a less expensive 
Apple-equivalent disk. Lobo delivers top quality 
for less. 

You'll find our disk price breakthrough 
can mean a real performance breakthrough for 
your Apple II' 




8" Floppy Disk Systems 

up to 2.2 megabytes of on-line storage 
with two double-sided, double-density 8" flop- 
pies (1 .1 megabytes with single-sided drives). 
DOS 3.3 capabilities are supported Interface 
plugs into any Apple I/O slot (except 0). 

Lobo's optional CP/M includes a special 
DENSITY command to permit reading and writ- 
ing standaid single-density disks 

Optional Pascal software lets you store the 
entire Apple Pascal system on one side of one 
8" disk— With lots of room left for program files 

TWO SINGLE-SIDED DRIVES 

Model 8202CA $1625.00 
TWO DOUBLE-SIDED DRIVES 

Model 5202CA $1925.00 



Winchester Dislt Systems 

Programs that make heavy use of disk 
files will get a spectacular performance boost 
when you plug in up to 8 megabytes of ultra- 
fast hard disk storage And imagine the con- 
venience of having all your program and data 
files immediately available whenever you boot 
the sytem. 



IMPORTANT: many hard disk systems 
now being sold have no provision for backing 
up the disk (using standard Apple minifloppies. 
you'd need about three dozen diskettes to com- 
pletely back up a 5 MB drivel) Lobo hard disk 
systems come with a built-in double-sided, 
quad-density floppy drive that can store the 
complete contents of the hard disk on six or 
seven floppies This floppy drive also adds the 
equivalent of at least 5 more Apple disk drives 
to your total on-line storage' 




Software and Accessories 

All Lobo disk systems come complete 
with interface card and any necessary patches 
to DOS 3.3. Use of Apple Pascal with Lobo 8" 
floppy drives requires the Lobo Pascal Creator 
disk and documentation. 

Running CP/M with Lobo Winchester 
or 8" floppy systems requires a Microsoft 
SoftCard. an Apple Language card (or Micro- 
soft RAM Card or equivalent), and the Lobo 
CP/M disk. Pascal is not currently supported on 
Lobo Winchester systems

card are functionally identical and plug- 
compatible with Apple Disk II equipment. Lobo 
and Apple drives may be freely mixed on a 
Lobo or Apple interface card, and the Lobo 
interface features a switch to select 13 or 16 
sector boot The only other difference is the 
price and Lobo's unique 1-year guarantee'

A Home Computerist's Tale 

Two nights ago I brought home my new Apple 
II Plus. I have been feeling kind of confused and 
elated at the same time. Here I am with 48K, 
two floppy disk drives, a color monitor, and a 
printer — veritably all dressed up and looking 
hard for a place to go. 

I have been running a Datapoint ARC sys- 
tem for around four years and in that time have 
learned a bit about computers, but only in a 
strictly business environment. A month or so 
ago, for the hell of it, I visited my local Com- 
puter Universe store. I wondered how they sold 
computers for families. How can a computer 
improve the quality of life of an average family 
in 1982? So I decided to play dumb. Although I 
am quite able to sling RAM, ROM, and kilo- 
bytes with the best of them, I asked naive ques- 
tions such as what is a computer and what can it 
do for me? 

They looked at me like I was a congenital 
idiot. Immediately they started talking about 
eight bit machines, 6502 chips, and so forth. I 
made confused noises, and instead of realizing 
that I needed further explanation they just got 
more technical. I then asked what a computer 
could do for my family. They wanted to know if 
I was intending to run a business on it. I said no; 
it would be for my family. This time they 
looked confused. 

I asked if there were educational programs 
that my child could use. The salesman said that 
there were, but he really didn't know very much 
about them. I got the same response when I 
asked about my household budget and home 
money management. He did know about Visi- 
Calc and he tried to gear the conversation 
toward that. On the whole, this salesman didn't 
have the slightest idea of how to sell a com- 
puter to people. Computerland was a bit friend- 
lier, but for the most part no one knew how to 
sell a computer to people for people to use. If 
you are not computer literate, there is really no 
way to enter the market unless you have done 
the research and know the right questions 
to ask. 

The answers to most of my real questions 
have been found in computer magazines such as 
So/talk. I got hooked but good and knew I 
would have a computer in my home. I have 
learned that there is a wealth of application soft- 
ware on the market that ranges in quality from 
very useful or entertaining to incredibly mind- 
less. There are a myriad of uses which are only 
limited by the imagination after one becomes 
fairly proficient in programming. There are pro- 
grams that my child at eighteen months of age 
can benefit from. My wife and I can carry on all 
our correspondence (I was never one for writ- 
ing letters). We can keep records of valuables 




Why Not Pumpkin?

lantem he carved to say Happy Halloween to fellow readers o/Softalk. 



for ourselves and for insurance companies. 

But there is a darker reason to spend all this 
money and invest all this time and effort: the 
computer is probably the most remarkable toy 
ever invented! I always wanted to get my hands 
on a microcomputer, not for my business, but 
just for me. I want to learn to program it and 
see what kind of things my mind can make it 
do. I'm sure many other readers feel the same 
way. I'm very excited about what the concept of 
home computing has in store for me.

He Blew It and It Worked 

The morning after our daughter's slumber party 
my wife called me at work very upset. She had 
discovered that a glass of water had been spilled 
into our box of disks. All the disks were okay 
after being dried except Jawbreaker, our family 
favorite. When I got home, I saw that the disk 
would not turn in the jacket. In desperation, I 
used a blow dryer set to the lowest setting to 



blow warm air around the disk inside the jacket. 
The water was evaporated in about twenty-five 
minutes and the disk booted. Some happy kids 
could then resume their Jawbreaker contests. I 
hojje that sharing my experience can help some- 
one else.

Crime Report with a Plea 

Computer crime is becoming a common term, 
but I have recently been a victim of a rather un- 
usual form of it. A remarkably sophisticated 
and specialized burglar broke into my house. To 
the great surprise of the police, the only thing he 
took was the 128K Saturn RAM board which I 
had recently installed in my Apple II. Nothing 
else, except one unrelated disk, was taken or dis- 
turbed. This is certainly a step beyond piracy of 
programs, although I suspect that people who 
try to achieve a reasonable income developing 
and selling programs might not agree. 

I had been thinking of submitting a review

of the RAM board to Softalk; this thief s ac- 
tion seems to be a remarkably favorable review 
in itself. During the brief time I had it, I was 
quite impressed by the Saturn card, and I agree 
with the burglar that it was the single most val- 
uable thing in my Apple. It did a fine job of 
speeding up the compilation of large Pascal pro- 
grams, offered lots of programming space and 
convenience for Basic programs, and the ac- 
companying software performed flawlessly. The 
documentation was clear, complete, and easy to 
follow. Apparently, the thief didn't recognize the 
value of the manual and disks; he failed to take 
any of them. Unless he is a remarkably sophis- 
ticated programmer, the card will be useless to 
him without these items. I find that fact some- 
what consoling. 

This leads to the point of this letter. I would 
be grateful if any readers of Softalk who have 
Saturn cards would regard with great suspicion 
any requests to copy their disks or manuals, and 
let me have the name and address of anyone 
making such a request.

Apropos to Oo-Topos 

After all the horror stories about unscrupulous 
vendors giving Apple software a bad name, I'd 
like to say a word about one that supports its 
customers: Sentient Software. 

My copy of the game Oo-Topos blew up and 
I had to send for a replacement, which was 
promptly provided at the nominal fee of six dol- 
lars. However, problems with their disk sup- 
plier and with the software caused great diffi- 
culties. My replacement was a bad floppy and I 
had to send it back; they sent another that I al- 
so had to return. 

In the midst of my anger and frustration. 
Sentient sent me a free copy of their game Cy- 
borg by way of apology for the trouble I was 
having, along with another, as it turned out, 
bad copy of Oo-Topos. I kept Cyborg and sent 
back Oo-Topos again. Sentient finally deter- 
mined that their copy protection scheme was 
preventing the disk from booting on a standard 
Apple with language card. 

Sentient's support solution for me was to 
send me a completely unprotected version of 
Oo-Topos. It works fine, and I am amazed by 
their generosity and trust. Needless to say, I am 
very highly impressed by the ethics and dedica- 
tion of this company, and I'd like to commend 
them publicly. If game vendors will support 
their users thusly, we should likewise be willing 
to support them.

A Voice of Encouragement 

I bought my Apple used. It came with the Videx 
eighty-column card, but no Videx manual. So I 
called Videx and ordered a manual. While I was 
on the phone, they told me of the Videx Soft 
Video Switch. This little gadget lets you switch 
between forty and eighty columns under soft- 
ware control, so I ordered one. Included with it 
was version 2.3 of the firmware for the eighty- 
column card. However, since they had just re- 



leased version 2.4 of the firmware, they offered 
to send that instead. Unfortunately, 2.3 was in 
the package I received. I called Videx. They 
apologized and immediately shipped 2.4. At the 
same time they sent me a prepaid UPS ticket so 
that the 2.3 ROM could be returned. I was im- 
pressed by their helpful attitude and rapid cor- 
rection of the problem. 

When I decided to upgrade the keyboard on 
the Apple, I bought the Videx Keyboard En- 
hancer II. When I started to install it, I was 
again impressed, this time by the manual. Step 
by step, and with photographs even, it took me 
through the process of disassembling the Ap- 
ple, removing the keyboard encoder and re- 
placing it. Unfortunately, when I put it back to- 
gether, it didn't work. I called Videx. They im- 
mediately and with no hassle said to send them 
the Enhancer. They fixed it and returned it to 
me at no charge. There's a chance I may have 
damaged it while trying to install it. Videx did 
not ask. They simply took care of it. 

There's a problem with the Enhancer not 
being compatible with some games. I ended up 
removing it since the main thing I do on the Ap- 
ple is play games. At the National Computer 
Conference in Houston, I stopped by the Videx 
booth and explained my problem. The Videx 
representative said to call customer service at 
Videx and ask for the new release of firmware 
(version 1.1) for the Enhancer. With this new 
version, you can defeat all the features of the 
Enhancer and make it act like the original key- 
board encoder (by pressing the space bar when 
you power up the Apple). They immediately 
shipped me the new ROM at no charge, asking 
only that I return the old one. 

Videx has repeatedly demonstrated their in- 
tention and ability to provide extraordinary serv- 
ice and 1 congratulate them on their achieve- 
ment. The products I have used are excellent; 
with the high level of service provided by Videx, 
they are in fact a remarkable value.

Continental Courtesy 

I have just been overwhelmed by a prompt, 
courteous letter and a full no-questions-asked 
refund from Continental Software. I had prob- 
lems with one of their early releases, and rather 
than complain about it, I let it sit and gather 
dust for months. I finally decided I didn't have 
the heart to tackle it again and I sent it back. 
Wow! What a surprise to find a company so 
willing to stand behind their products. They 
sure made a Continental Software fan of me.

An Unaccustomed Customer 

I am a very satisfied owner of an Apple HI and I 
am always interested in seeing articles on the 
Apple III in Softalk. I do, however, have some 
concerns with respect to Apple Computer and 
the Apple III. First, with the exception of Mini- 
Micro Systems, I have not seen any advertising 
for the Apple III. It seems to me that Apple is 
missing the boat by not advertising in industry 
journals, let alone magazines such as Softalk, 
that are oriented toward the personal computer 
market. Second, although I have owned my Ap-

OCTOBER 1982 



pie III since January, I have yet to hear any- 
thing from Apple Computer regarding new 
products for it. Whatever happened to the 
much rumored Fortran; when is the SOS refer- 
ence manual going to be published; is Apple go- 
ing to manufacture a real-time clock for the III? 

Please do not let the foregoing influence you 
into thinking that I am dissatisfied with my Ap- 
ple III. I am extremely happy with it. I am, how- 
ever, accustomed to somewhat better user sup- 
port. I have been involved with computers for 
nearly fifteen years. During that period, I have 
used and programmed a wide variety of ma- 
chines. With the exception of the Apples I've 
used, I have always received excellent support 
from the manufacturer. Since I bought the Ap- 
ple III to use in my own business, I hoped, per- 
haps assumed, that I would receive similar sup- 
port from Apple. Apparently Apple assumes or 
expects local computer retailers to handle this, 
but it has been my experience that a dealer's staff 
is so busy trying to run the business and make 
sales to new customers that they simply cannot 
keep up with industrywide developments, let 
alone Apple developments. Because my credi- 
bility with my customers is dependent on cur- 
rent knowledge of the industry, I need all the 
help I can get. It would really be great if some of 
this help came directly from Apple. 
M. Keith Williams, vice president. Sunflower 
Micro Systems, Kansas City, KS 

Addressing the Mail Decision 

In response to Mr. Graham's (Northwestern 
Apple User's Group) letter concerning Apple's 
decision to restrict mail-order sales, I offer the 
following comments: 

1 . For rural populations not close to an Apple 
dealer, this policy does present a problem. 
Apple should consider direct sales or some 
other means of servicing that market. 

2. Local dealer organizations have more than 
enough competition from IBM, NEC, PET, 
and Radio Shack. I hardly think Apple has a 
monopoly on the market, and dealers I 
know are clearly aware of this, with or with- 
out mail order sales. 

3. With regard to restraint of trade, each com- 
pany still (thank heaven) has the right to de- 
cide what distribution channels it will em- 
ploy. The "ethical" aspect is indeed plain; 
that is, that Apple has the right to market 
their products by any legitimate means they 
deem appropriate. 

4. Apple will clearly have to contend with com- 
petitive equipment, including peripheral 
equipment. I suspect they believe that cus- 
tomer support will be critical to selling mi- 
crocomputers to the general public and busi- 
ness and, as a relative neophyte to micro- 
computers, I think they are correct. The ma- 
jority of noncomputer buffs will want more 
than a post office to help them get maxi- 
mum use out of their purchase. 

Apple has clearly decided that the future for 
microcomputers will require a strong dealer net- 
work and this action is evidently intended to en- 
sure this network. Let us hope they are correct. 
Ronald L. Sladky, Perrysburg, OH 



Reaction from Abroad 

I am a charter member of the Rota Computer 
Club aboard the United States Naval Station in 
Rota, Spain. This club was organized last Oc- 
tober and has been a valuable source of infor- 
mation and support for interested owners and 
potential owners of various computers. Those 
of us in the club who are Apple owners were 
very disturbed to discover Apple Computer's 
arbitrary decision to end mail-order sales of Ap- 
ple products. A lot of Americans who are in the 
military or civilians who work overseas for our 
government were effectively stopped from add- 
ing to a system that was already started. I have 
invested not only a substantial amount of 
money in this product, but my faith as well. I 
feel betrayed! The people who bought these 
products when Apple was a small company and 
helped turn it into a large company are the peo- 
ple most hurt by Apple's decision. I have not 
written to Apple regarding this decision. I doubt 
if my letter would be read. I have read many 
complaint letters in your magazine and in 
others, but I have read no satisfactory reply 
from Apple. If Apple thinks that all those deal- 
ers are supporting the buyers, I wish they could 
have followed in my footsteps. My computer 
came in a box, and I wasn't even invited to see 
how it would go together. Today, I know where 
to find answers to my questions: I read Softalk 
every month. I find a lot of answers there be- 
cause you directly address the problems we run 
into rather than pretending that problems don't 
exist. I will certainly buy a piece of software on 
your recommendation, as well as learning from 
other people in my computer club. 

I am a teacher, and I hope that the govern- 
ment changes the rules so that Apple can put a 
computer in every classroom. It makes sense. I 
also hope that Apple Computer changes the 
rules and remembers us forgotten people over- 
seas. That makes sense too. 
Karen Obrock, Rota, Spain 

Behind Life's Simple Things 

I want to congratulate Barney Stone for his fine 
discussion of copy protection tradeoffs in the 
August Open Discussion. So many users seem 
unaware of the complexity of "simple" things 
that they ask for; and too many want to have 
their cake, decide what plate it's served on, what 
flavor of ice cream it's served with, and then eat 
it too. 

Small Business Computer Systems war- 
rants all of its software to perform as specified, 
provides a free program back-up with each 
package, free program updates, and free re- 
placement of damaged disks. Modifications are 
available, as is prompt, ftiendly customer assist- 
ance by phone or mail. Demos with full docu- 
mentation are available, and questionnaires are 
sent to users and dealers for suggestions on im- 
proving present programs or developing future 
ones. 

That kind of service can't be offered if we let 
our users modify our programs whenever they 
want. As Mr. Stone pointed out, when a user 
makes a modification that results in a problem 
with the program, how do you determine if it's 



your code or their modification that's the source 
of the problem? When do such modifications 
void a warranty? 

I speak from experience. Our software used 
to be modifiable, but that policy was abused. 
Dealers were particularly adept at mangling the 
code and passing on mutant programs to users. 
When problems subsequently developed, the 
dealers passed the buck, and users turned to us 
for assistance. After all, it was "our" code, 
right? I invested a lot of time straightening pro- 
grams out, and since most users expected me to 
do it free of charge, it became quite expensive 
and time consuming. 

Users are expecting extreme flexibility and 
capability and also lower prices. They need to 
realize that time and effort are involved in pro- 
ducing, marketing, and maintaining software 
programs. There is time and money involved in 
customer service, and problems are inherent in 
modifying someone else's source code. Some 
sacrifices in flexibility have to be made in re- 
turn for program performance. Software manu- 
facturers aren't all raking in millions of dollars 
in profits. Because of things like overhead, de- 
velopment time, advertising costs, and dis- 
counts to dealers and distributors, the software 
manufacturers have to draw the line some- 
where. 

David McFarling, president, SBCS, 
Lincoln, NE 

Long-time Softalk readers may recall the 
character sketch of the remarkable Dave McFar- 
ling in ' 'A pples A re Handy for Handicapped Peo- 
ple," October 1980. McFarling founded SBCS 
and does all its programming. 

A Four-Disk Lunch 

Permit me to respond to Barney Stone's long 
letter in August Softalk. I like the options and 
features of your product, Mr. Stone; however, 
as far as user friendliness goes, DB Master 
ranks near zero. The product is copy-protected, 
which prevents me from tailoring it to my own 
needs. This is important because the program 
simply does not run well in an Apple II with 
two disk drives. 

My first test of DB Master continually 
asked me to swap three disks (programs, util- 
ities, and data, I guess). This was really tiring 
and unfriendly and was necessary for even a lit- 
tle database. However, when I expanded my 
testing and it asked for a fourth disk for sort- 
ing, I nearly lost my lunch. 

Thanks, Mr. Stone, for intelligent software 
with features. However, because I cannot tailor 
your product to correct this flaw, I think I'll just 
go out and buy a copy of VisiFile. How did you 
end your letter? "In a free enterprise economy, 
the market will tell."

ter that are not only copy protected but make 
use of so many nonstandard features that they 
are essentially incompatible with everything else 
in the world. The conventional, though per- 
haps unfair, parlance for such a program is a 
kluge. 

Barney Stone, the coauthor of DB Master, 
rebuts with a good defense of his position. Es- 
sentially, he argues that the Apple II is a small 
shoe and that a big shoehorn is required to ex- 
tract the kind of performance that he and his 
customers expect. Unfortunately, using a shoe- 
horn on software inevitably leads to a number 
of undesirable consequences and compromises. 
His closing statement is most telling and abso- 
lutely correct: "In a free enterprise economy, the 
market will tell." 

Mr. Stone may be right, but my own sym- 
pathies lie with Mr. Ogden and others like him. 
In sixteen years in the computer industry I have 
watched innumerable endeavors go astray be- 
cause of a single problem — the "Why can't the 
computer do just this one more thing?" syn- 
drome. It is only in recent years that more than 
a handful of software producers and con- 
sumers have realized the fallacy of that argu- 
ment. 

In the case of DB Master, Mr. Stone could 
have chosen to write a version completely stand- 
ard, maintainable, and extensible with a per- 
formance of X units of speed and capacity. In- 
stead, he chose to squeeze blood from the stone 
(no pun intended) to achieve, instead, a perform- 
ance of y units, where y/x is presumably 



greater than one. However, a customer is con- 
cerned only with satisfying his own perform- 
ance requirement of z units. Unless z is in the 
range x<=z<=y, little or none of the benefits 
of a stretched performance design do any good. 
In a growing business, z better remain less than 
y forever, or disaster may result. In short, the 
customer shouldn't be so greedy. In the long 
run, cutting comers is seldom profitable in any 
type of business. 

Will the microcomputer industry take as 
long as the maxi and minicomputer industries 
did to learn this lesson? I hope not, and I think 
not. For one thing, publications like Softalk can 
help spread the word before inexperienced users 
get in too deeply. What I would really like to see 
is the free enterprise economy motivate Barney 
Stone to use his considerable talents to produce 
a DB Master II that will satisfy the likes of 
Everett Ogden and me.

One Spell That Remains Unbroken 

I would like to respond to the letter about copy 
protection by Gary Griffis in August Open Dis- 
cussion. I, personally, would love to have all 
programs unprotected, and I think that it 
would show that the companies trust us. How- 
ever, I must disagree with Gary's statement that 
no copy protection would increase sales. I don't 
know if the following story applies to all Apple 
owners, but I know that it does to the ones I 
know. 

I know about six Apple owners, most of

whom occasionally copy programs. The pro- 
gram that most of them have bought is Wiz- 
ardry, which has perhaps the best copy protec- 
tion of any program on the market. First one 
person bought it, and then everyone saw how 
excellent it was. Next they tried to copy it. I 
know one person who spent hours trying to 
copy it using every copy program you can think 
of — but he failed. That person, and every other 
Apple owner I know (including me), bought his 
own Wizardry. Now I am positive that if Wiz- 
ardry had not been protected this well, especial- 
ly if it had not been protected at all, not a single 
person besides the first one would have pur- 
chased it. 

I would really love to have an unprotected 
Wizardry so I could look at some of the pro- 
gram (I know it's in Pascal). I am sure a lot of 
other people would like this too, but I just don't 
think that selling an unprotected Wizardry 
would increase its sales. I think it would de- 
crease sales by maybe up to one-third. Like I 
said, I don't know if all Apple owners treat the 
copying of programs this way. I would like to 
hear someone else's opinion. 

On another subject, I used Word Handler 
for this letter. Word Handler is an excellent 
word processor. To those of you who feel that 
you like WordStar better, I just don't have that 
kind of money to put into a word processor, so 
Word Handler was my choice. I love it! One 
warning: the letters are a little small, so you 
need a very good monitor (preferably green 
phosphorous) to be able to read it. 
Matthew Machlis, Temple City, CA 

Pass the Word 

I purchased an Apple II Plus nearly one year 
ago for several different functions, including 
limited word processing. I originally purchased 
Apple Writer and found it to be a handy text 
handler, but unsuitable as a word processor for 
a nontechnical writer such as my wife. I wanted 
a package that provided more capability than 
Apple Writer, but did not require additional 
hardware. 

About that same time I began receiving 
Softalk and Sierra On-Line Systems was pro- 
moting their Superscribe II (now ScreenWriter 
II). The advertising copy described a product 
that appeared to be what I was looking for. 
Many dealers would have been happy to sell the 
product to me, but none was willing to demon- 
strate it. I had not read my reviews of Super- 
Scribe II so I did not want to invest in a prod- 
uct of this size without a demonstration. I tele- 
phoned On-Line and they only referred me 
back to the same dealers I had already con- 
tacted. I wrote On-Line's president in a last at- 
tempt to get steered to a dealer who would dem- 
onstrate the product. My letter to On-Line was 
never acknowledged or answered. I felt happy 
for them since their business is so good that they 
can turn away customers. 

I gave up on Sierra On-Line and resigned 
myself to the limited functionality of Apple 
Writer until I could invest in additional hard- 
ware. Rereading Softalk, I came across an ad-

ADVENTURES IN EXCELLENCE 



35 



Nestled in a cozy office complex in Cambridge, Massachusetts, due 
west of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the 
new corporate headquarters of the legendary Underground Empire, In- 
focom. Perhaps embassy is a more accurate description of the facility, as 
there is certainly the feeling of stepping onto foreign, even alien, soil. 
Impressions of Infocom's several stories overlay and intertwine with the 
threads being woven on the loom of reality. Approaching the entrance, 
we recall the promise of a special surprise at the end of our visit, and that, 
in true Deadline tradition, if we keep our eyes open, we might discern 
clues as to what that surprise is. Come along and see if you can antici- 
pate the secret with us. 

Upon entering, you find a strangely familiar lamp sitting on the re- 
ceptionist's desk. As you instinctively take it along, you notice an attrac- 
tive paperweight a sword embedded in a crystal rock. A man resem- 
bling a prospector sits waiting in the lobby, and the sword glows brightly 
blue for a moment as we enter the offices. After wending through a series 
of winding, twisting passages, we arrive at the Wizard's Den. There is the 
Wizard of Frobozz himself, bent over, gazing intently into a black 
sphere. 

Marc Blank looks up from the Apple and smiles. 

Before the Fall. To understand Infocom is to return to the pre-Apple 
days of the eariy seventies at MIT. As Joel Berez, president of Infocom, 
relates: 

"We all at one time or another had worked for a research group 
that's now part of the Laboratory for Computer Science at MIT. This 
group was strongly result oriented. It was called The Dynamic Model- 
ing System; now it's the Programming Technology Division. 

"We believed it was important to develop programming tools before 
trying to develop applications. Over the years we had assembled an ex- 
tremely advanced set of tools. Marc Blank lived next door to me when 
we were undergraduates and we both worked in this group. 

"A dream of the leader of the group, Al Vezza, was that someday he 
would bring together all the people who'd been involved with the group 
to start a commercial venture using the same techniques that had been so 
highly successful. Of the ten founders of Infocom, eight came from the 
group. 

"We also have three generations of teacher /students here; Dr. Lick- 
lider, in a sense, was Al's teacher, and Al was ours." 

Joel Berez sets down the translator, as Marc Blank materializes to in- 
troduce us to one of the cocreators of Zork, the Great Implementor him- 
self, Dave Lebling. 

Moving through a door to the west brings us into a large conference 
room, where we sit around a shimmering table; everyone avoids touch- 
ing the table. Water seems to glisten in an African painting on the wall 
where crocodiles and hippos swim serenely. You notice, though, that the 
green bubble on the dam upstream is not flashing. The robot in the 
corner puts down its apple and, while whistling, serves tea. Strange, your 
cup has a slight discoloration in the bottom. 

The Underground Empire existed long before Infocom's founding, 
so Lebling and Blank relate how they first opened the door to Zork; the 
background music plays an oldie by the Taylor Mills Road group. 

As Lebling explains it, "We had so much fun playing Adventure that 
when it was all over, we said, 'Oh dear, there are no more of these; how 
awful!' " 

Blank, officially vice president in charge of product development, 
adds that there were some areas where they thought they could improve 
upon the original Adventure, which had been written in Fortran. 

"It really bothered us that if you said, Take bird,' it would put the 
bird in the cage for you — sort of doing things behind your back. I sup- 
pose it's the nature of computer programmers everywhere to want to 
outdo the other person, to be a little better, especially in games. 

"There were primarily three of us who worked on the original Zork: 
Tim Anderson, Dave, and I. In 1976, Tim and I started with an eight-

OCTOBER 1982 

room dungeon on a PDP-10, written in Muddle, or MDL, which was de- 
veloped at MIT in the early seventies as a spinoff of Lisp. 

"Then we began thinking of problems to overcome for the adventur- 
er. The silliest thing in Adventure was that you always had to say, Take 
ax, throw ax; take ax, throw ax.' So we decided that anything you threw 
at Zork's troll, it would eat! A lot of things in Zork pay homage to Ad- 
venture." 

Lebling and Anderson's Inferno. "We were thinking all along about 
an underground world. Tim and I had each read a lot of fantasy and it 
struck us as picturesque. We liked the idea that this was going to be like a 
book, like a story, so the player can say, 'I can see this world.' So we 
spent a lot of time on developing descriptions and trying to make the 
world seem more realistic." 

That's where Lebling comes in. "I'm in charge of the purple prose; 
and I did the geographical design of Zork /." 

Blank explains how Zork came to be Zorkr. "We'd generated this 
game with eighty places and five problems, and we didn't have a name 
for it. We just put it on the system. We had to have some type of name 
for it — files need names. Zork was a nonsense word used around the lab 
at the time as an exclamation — like, 'Zork, look at that!' The name 
stuck. 

"We then added direct and indirect objects so we could tell it things 
like 'Kill troll with knife.' The parser got more and more sophisticated. 
As things progressed, we understood prepositions, we used adjectives, 
and we differentiated between objects with adjectives." 

By June 1977, the first version of the mainframe Zork was finished. 
Blank had done the bulk of the work with help from Dave, Tim, and 
Bruce Daniels. Daniels is now working for Apple. He had done the coal 
mine section in Zork I and helped on the puzzle in Zork III. During 1977 
and 1978, the areas of Zork II and part of Zork III were added. That 
is as far as Zork was developed on the mainframes. 

How had Blank found time in his hectic, pressure-filled schedule at 
MIT to do all this massive work on Zorld Says Blank, "Oh, no. I had 
graduated from MIT in 1975 with a degree in biology. At the time of 
Zork'?, development, I was in medical school at Albert Einstein in the 
Bronx in New York City." Ah. That explains it. "I graduated from there 
in 1979. So how did I write Zork, in Boston, from New York? Easy. I 
used to drive up every weekend and work with Tim on it. During the 
week I would think of ideas to try out. I like biology and was sort of in- 
terested in medicine, but I love playing with computers, and I love games 
and programming." Enter Infocom, stage right. 

On Goldfish Pond. Al Vezza is the Prime Mover of Infocom and 
chairman of the board. He still works at MIT full time, where he holds 
the impressive title of senior scientist and is currently acting associate di- 
rector of the lab. Gazing out a rear window at the aspen trees and the 
goldfish pond, Vezza recalls, "Our main objective when we started this 
company in 1979 was to use our technology to sell products. At that time 
we didn't have a specific product in mind, but my firm belief is that the 
way you create new products, with new ideas, is to get a bunch of bright 
people, put them in an environment that is stimulating, and let them go 
at it." 

Over the summer of 1979, Berez told Blank about Vezza's exciting 
new venture. Blank suggested that Zork was certainly marketable, and, 
according to Joel, "Marc and I kicked around the idea of putting Zork 
out commercially; we designed a machine-independent language for 
games that summer." Berez, at that time, was in the Sloane Manage- 
ment School at MIT earning his business degree. They took the idea to 
Vezza, who agreed to let Zork be Infocom's first venture. 

From the summer of 1979 to the spring of 1980, Blank wrote the 
compiler and Lebling wrote the assembler for the new language. Bruce 
Daniels wrote the Apple Kernel. During this time, Zork for the micro 
was being developed independent of MIT on rented space on a DEC-20 
from Digital Equipment. 

In the spring of 1980, the decision to license Zork to Personal 
Software was made. Vezza relates why it was not a hard sale. 

"We talked to Dan Fylstra from Personal Software about Zork. 
Turned out that when Dan had been in business school in Boston, he 
had played Zork on my computer while doing a thesis. So he knew what 
Zork was all about." 

The Wizard and the Shape Changers. Zork did quite well under Per- 



mp 37 

sonal's umbrella, but in the fall of 1981, Personal underwent a corporate 
metamorphosis into VisiCorp. The new image involved VisiCorp's drop- 
ping all its game lines and concentrating on business programs, so Info- 
com took back the rights to market the Zork line. This created quite a 
problem for Infocom at first. 

During a moment's pause in Blank's narration, you watch a crystal 
phoenix being reborn in the air above the shimmering table. Blank con- 
tinues the story. 

"We've been in business three and a half years, but only one year 
has involved marketing under our own name. Last fall we started an in- 
credible scramble. We had Zork II ready, but we didn't know anything 
about packaging or advertising. So we got a terrific agency, Giar- 
dini/Russell in Watertown, Massachusetts. In two days they came up 
with the Zork logo and the manuals — really quick; and we had Zork II 
out for Christmas. We took our first office last September in the Faneuil 
Hall Marketplace in Boston. It was only one room and, in true Zork 
fashion, required a special key for unlocking the elevator to get up to that 
floor. Joel was the first full-time employee and started last July. I came 
on at the same time and became full time in January. We now have a 
staff of four people and we'll be expanding to ten within four months. 
Others, like Dave, have regular jobs elsewhere, working here evenings 
and weekends. We moved into these new offices in January." 

As Blank shows us around the offices, we notice all of Infocom's 
package fronts framed on a wall, including the two new ones, Zork 
III and Starcross. Next to Starcross is an empty frame filled with ivy. 
Perhaps the ad agency is from nearby Harvard. 

Great Caesar's Muddle! As we walk. Blank and Berez explain the 
Muddle language and why it's so central to Infocom's success. 

"Muddle, like us, is a result-oriented, function application lan- 
guage," says Berez. "A program is formatted, debugged, and compiled 
on a DEC-20 in Muddle, then translated into machine language, which is 
interpreted on the Apple. Thus programs are easily transportable be- 
tween different machines. Currently, all our programs are available for 
eight machines, including the IBM and the new NEC." 

Blank adds, "What we've done is design a machine independent Ian-

guage, which is emulated Hke Pascal on all the different machines, and 
optimized it for doing what we do. It's very compact. For example, on 
the mainframe, Zork / was about six hundred thousand bytes. That same 
game in its entirety is seventy-five thousand bytes on micros. So we get a 
factor of eight compression." 

Berez then points out, as we step aside for the bear, that "this gives us 
a tremendous marketing edge. If you can show us any machine that will 
sell a reasonable number of copies, we'll adapt our games to run on it." 

The Infocom parser is also a unique and somewhat mystifying tool. 
Blank defines a parser as "a module of a program that takes English in- 
put and distills it into smaller pieces of information. The parser has three 
outputs. It understands a verb, a direct object, and an indirect object. If I 
say, 'Put the brown bag into that trophy case' " (pointing to the one be- 
hind us), "the parser looks at that and basically comes out with three 
things: put is the verb, brown bag is the direct object, and trophy case is 
the indirect object. Thus, where most adventures are limited to a parser 
that can only handle two words, our parser takes full sentences." 

Old Pictures in New Frames. Blank also explains that Zork on the 
Apple was quite different in spots from the original mainframe version. 
Zork I is two-thirds from the original and one-third brand-new, Zork II 
is half and half, and the just-released Zork III is one-third old and two- 
thirds new. A black and white checkerboard figure looks over your 
shoulder as Blank discusses the depths of subtlety that Zork plumbed. 

"If you're really in a place that's very foreign, very mysterious, noth- 
ing should be taken at face value. Everything should be explored," Blank 
advises. "For example, in Zork II, the Oddly-Angled Room was sort of a 
joke, like the way Beethoven would write a scherzo. The minuet move- 
ment was a very formal thing, the third movement in symphonies. 
Beethoven turned it into a scherzo, which means joke, and did funny 
things to a movement that is normally a very rigorously stylized thing. 

"We decided, in the same way, that this maze was going to be differ- 
ent. You," Blank says, meaning us, "think you know how to do mazes. 
Here's a maze that you can't map. It's basically to tell people, 'Don't al- 
ways think that a maze is a maze.' " 

One of the big breakthroughs with Zork was the development of

multisolutions to the same problem. The cyclops in Zork I could be put 
to sleep by feeding him the right food, or, if you ever happen to chance 
upon saying Ulysses, he would flee from the room. Blank offers a rare 
piece of Zork trivia. "Do you know that there is actually a clue to saying 
Ulysses or Odysseu^. The commandment in the prayer book in the tem- 
ple starts off with saying: 'Commandment 29,160 — Oh ye who go about 
saying unto each other, "Hello Sailor." ' If you look at the first letter of 
each line going down the side, it reads 'Odysseus'!" 

Beware the Fork. Hearing a mind-curdling scream from behind an 
unmarked door, you open the door onto a view of a demonic black tem- 
ple. "What's that?" you yell. Blank swiftly closes the door, saying, "It is 
not time for you to know." 

Somewhat shaken by this vision of blighted evil, we turn for comfort 
to a more familiar subject Infocom's revolutionary breakthrough in the 
blossoming field of computer novels. Deadline. 

''Deadline was our hardest project yet to implement," Blank com- 
ments. "People moving around — the idea that characters can walk a 
path by themselves. You can interrupt them and sometimes change their 
future moves completely, like switching train tracks. If you ask them 
about something, their answers depend on what you know. If you've 
shown them this, but not that, you'll get one answer. If you've shown 
them that, but not this, you'll get a different answer. And, if you've 
shown both things to the person, you'll get a third, entirely different an- 
swer. If you ask someone about something before it happens, they'll 
claim to have no knowledge of it. 

"In Deadline, things are waiting for you to do something. You are an 
active force. It's possible that if you don't do anything in the game, noth- 
ing will really happen. There are thirty different endings possible. The 
newspaper headlines at the end convey how close to the best possible so- 
lution you were. When you finally satisfy this very finicky jury, you get, 
on the screen, the author's summary of what actually occurred. 

"We pride ourselves on anticipating the things people will try to do, 
so that there'll be meaningful responses in the game and not just the old 
standard 'nothing happens.' Deadline is our best effort to date in that re- 
gard. It adds a sense that there is more going on in the game than what 
you see." 

This Way to Debriefing. Lebling rejoins us, the natives having 
dropped him off from canoeing on the Charles River. He's excited about 
Infocom's first science fiction adventure, Starcross. 

"Just as Mark is almost entirely responsible for Deadline, Starcross is 
mostly mine," Lebling smiles. "I have always been a science fiction fan 
and have wanted to do an adventure in the genre. That's one of the 
things I really like about Infocom. We figure out what we really want to 
do, rather than design games by market demand. I'm in this to have fun. 
It would be nice also for Infocom to make lots of money and be very suc- 
cessful, but I couldn't work if I wasn't having fun doing it. I love writ- 
ing these games — much more than I enjoy playing them. 

"Starcross was a real joy to write and should be a lot of fun for peo- 
ple to play. The puzzles are science fiction puzzles, not adventure puz- 
zles. We did not want to do a 'Zork in Space' game. Starcross is intend- 
ed as an entry level game for people who like science fiction but who 
haven't played many adventure games before." 

The airlock puzzle that begins Starcross is worth the price of the 
whole game for its cleverness of design. Even the packaging of the game 
is extraordinary: the disk comes in a large flying saucer that's reusable for 
storage — and it really flies. Enclosed is a special color space map and a 
detailed manual. The map figures prominently in getting the game 
started. 

Let 'Em Eat Disks. Referring to this and the excellent Deadline 
package, Berez puts forth the innovative idea that "merchandising can be 
a deterrent to piracy. People want all the goodies inside. That's the posi- 
tion Infocom is taking in the marketplace, in the sense that we're dis- 
couraging piracy by making the add-ons so attractive that people are 
willing to pay for them rather than settle for a pirated disk without the 
paraphernalia." 

The outer door of the Starcross suddenly clangs shut and you hear 
the airlock recycling. Then the inner door opens in front of you and out 
steps the surprise you'd been told to expect a cyborg. Michael Berlyn 
lights the room with his elfin grin. Now many of the strange things 
you've been seeing and experiencing throughout your visit begin to be-

come CTystal clear. 

Sitting in the shade of the two ancient stone guardians of the Under- 
ground Empire, sharing a box lunch, Berlyn tells you of his journey to 
Infocom. 

"It all started when Marc and I were introduced at Applefest. We hit 
it off so well that we decided right there to do a collaboration. Later on it 
looked like it would be better to go beyond collaboration and actually 
join up with him. I'm very glad to be here." 

The future and its promises excite Berlyn. "I have two science fiction 
games planned. One is a collaboration with Dave and Marc. We intend 
to introduce some brand-new elements into the adventure genre with this 
game. I'm also working on a book called After the Change — six hundred 
pages long, so far. 

"Being offered a position in this company is the pinnacle of my ca- 
reer. I'm into squeezing and wringing every ounce of energy, experience, 
creativity, and application out of myself that I can. I perceive Infocom as 
giving me the space, the time, and the opportunity to do just that." 

Great excitement reigned at Infocom upon Berlyn's decision to join 



BONUS! 



Sleuthing for Spirits 

The winding halls of Infocom seem to be peopled by the spirits 
of games. Not only do ghosts from Infocom's own games roam, 
but so do some from other games by Infocom's people. 

How many allusions to these illusions can you spot? 

Be the adventurer to identify the most references — obvious, 
subtle, obscure, even punned — and to place each in its real game, 
and you'll win the Infocom game of your choice or $25 credit 
toward any Softalk advertiser's product. 

In case of ties, precision will reign. If there are still ties, the ran- 
dom number generator will work overtime.

them. This was not just a sudden, unplanned happening. Berez explains: 
"Since the summer of 1979, we've realized that our whole system lends it- 
self to the talents of a professional writer. We've wanted to bring in peo- 
ple who could put most of their effort into writing good stories. Michael 
Berlyn — a published science fiction author with computer experience — is 
ideal. It's possible that what we're producing will become the novels of 
the future, and you're not going to want to read novels written by pro- 
grammers. So we're providing new tools for writers to use to get their 
points across in new ways." 

Blank discusses those tools and Berlyn: "Having Mike Berlyn here is 
one of the biggest pluses we have for the future. He's an excellent writer. 
He has lots of great ideas for sophisticated games that couldn't be imple- 
mented within the restrictions of Basic. With access to our technology, 
he'll be able to develop them. We're trying to extend the concept of the 
adventure story to where the player is a character and feels like a charac- 
ter, a part of the story, and not just like some being solving problems." 

What Dreams May Come. Your lamp flickers; your remaining time 
here is short. If we're to learn about the future of Infocom, we must listen 
now. Berez complies. 

"Al and I have just completed a business plan — about two inches 
thick. It establishes where we are today and where we want to go — the 
old five-year plan. 

"In the future, we'll branch out from entertainment into other areas. 
For next year, there are five entertainment programs scheduled. 

"One reason we're successful is the broad spectrum of computers on 
which our products run and the large installed user base that entails. Yet 
our transportability, for all its breadth, reaches only one-third to half of 
all the personal computers. The marketplace is growing and hungry, and 
our plans are to provide for it." 

Your lamp is very dim and you can hear the baying of the grues in 
the distance. So, with a last whiff of the Perfect Rose, we bid Infocom 
adieu. Marc Blank leads us to a cell and waves as he sets a dial and 
pushes a button outside. As we pass through the Great Door, we hear 
the Wizard mutter an "F" word, and we leave with a warm glow in our 
hearts that will never leave. 31 



Apple" II's best LISP 
just got better! 

LISP (for List Processor) was developed at MIT in the late 
1950's. As one of the oldest languages still in active use, 
LISP'S applications include artificial intelligence, natural 
language processing, robotics and educational and psy- 
chological programming. LISP's unique features give the 
programmer the power to develop software that goes far 
beyond the limitations of BASIC or PASCAL. 

In use at hundreds of colleges and by many hobbyists 
around the world, P-LISP has been acclaimed by experts in 
the field as the best implementation written for the Apple II® 

Now you can get the newly released Version 3.1 at a

Are you tired of waiting for DOS to 
load and save files? Are you tired of 
waiting for DOS to finish so you can 
type again? Are you tired of waiting 
for your printer? When you buy 
Diversl-DOS^", you won't have to 
wait any more! Here's why: 

1. DOS speed-up: Apple DOS 3.3 
takes 18 disk revolutions to read a 
single track, whereas Diversi-DOS 
reads or writes a track in just 2 
revolutions. This speeds up file pro-

2. Keyboard Buffer: Diversi-DOS 

allows you to type at any tinne, as 
fast as you can, without missing a

tion earlier this year. News of the takeover 
caused IBM stock to soar to its highest level 
since 1936. 

The takeover of IBM continues the meteoric 
expansion which Broderbund began with the 
purchase of Commodore Computer and Tandy 
Corporation in 1984. Other subsidiaries of the 
computer software company now include Si- 
erra On-Line, Apple Computer, Digital, Stan- 
ford University, and Japan. 

Broderbund board chairman Douglas 
Cariston credits much of his company's suc- 
cess to Supreme Court Justice Warren Berger, 
who ruled inadvertently in 1982 that Broder- 
bund holds exclusive rights to the binary num- 
bering system. Although Berger recently 
claimed that he was "just kidding around," the 
Court has yet to reverse the decision. 

Justice Department lawyers say they are not 
presently planning to institute anti-trust proce- 
dures against Broderbund Software, because 
they are still working on the break-up of 
AT&T. Actually most of AT&T's digitally 
based long-distance equipment was awarded to 
Broderbund Software by a San Francisco small 
claims court in 1984, and AT&T is now limited 
to a few local telephone systems using hollow 
tubes for voice transmission. "Nonetheless," 
says Attorney General Donald Segretti, "Jus- 
tice has fifteen years tied up in the AT&T anti- 
trust case, and we intend to see it through to the 
end." 

Knowledgeable sources at Broderbund sug- 
gest that the takeover of IBM will result in few 
major changes in that company's operation. 
Rumors are that the company may be given to 
Broderbund heir apparent Amanda Cariston as 
a Christmas present. 

Despite the growth of Broderbund into an 
international conglomerate, company financial 
analyst Cathy Cariston says "this is still basi- 
cally just a family business." The company has 
given employment to Professor Donald E. 
Cariston as a consultant on a project to con- 
vert carbonated soft drinks into disposable mi- 
crocomputers using bubble memory technolo- 
gy. "A judge in Texarkana gave us the Coca- 
Cola Company," says Don, "and we felt we had 
to do something useful with it." The Texar- 
kana judge ruled that bottling and retailing 
Coke involved the systematic switching of 
bottles between two states, empty and full, and 
thus constituted a "binary process" covered by 
Broderbund's proprietary rights. Former Coca- 
Cola president I.M. Fizzy protested, "By that 
kind of logic, sex could be considered a binary 
process." Replied Broderbund spokesperson 
Erin Cariston, "It is true that it takes two to 
tango," but she wishes to reassure the public 
that "Broderbund has no plans to seek patents 
in that area." Then, after a brief pause, she 
added, "At the present time." 

Meanwhile, at press time, Doug Cariston 
has been reported en route to England to con- 
duct negotiations of an unspecified nature. In 
light of the ongoing troubled state of the United 
Kingdom's economy, it is speculated that it may 
be looking for a buyer. Dl

A GRAPHICS TOOL FOR THE

^ r ; r \ BV DAVID DUIikEE 





It has been said that any sufficiently advanced technology will be in- 
distinguishable from magic. If you think that this principle applies only 
to isolated aboriginal tribes, like the ones in New Guinea who thought 
they were seeing the gods incarnate when airplanes first flew over their 
lands, think again. 

We Apple users like to think of ourselves as too technologically 
aware to be more than just impressed by something as mundane as a new 



peripheral. It's a good thing when something comes along to challenge 
our complacency. If you left your sense of wonder behind you with other 
childish things, you may be surprised to find out that magic has returned 
to the world.

before. Now imagine that one of the presents is so neat that for the rest 
of Christmas vacation you forget about snow forts, snowmen, snow- 
balls, and the Flexible Flyer in the garage and just play with this one 
present. If you close your eyes and think about that for a second, you'll 
begin to feel the way that we feel about the LPS II from Gibson 
Laboratories. 

The LPS II is a light pen that's turned into a revolutionary graphics 
system. Originally intended as demonstration software, the disk in this 
package contains the most exciting hi-res art system since Bill Budge first 
chose to share the secrets of 3-D. The pen becomes a tool to the soft- 
ware — but a very special tool. 

This pen is not to be confused with other instruments called light 
pens. It's similar in appearance — a penlike object attached to a wire that 
runs to the back of the Apple — but in execution it is a quantum leap be- 
yond other light pens. It actually gives the Apple a coordinate location 
on the screen instead of a simple light-intensity reading. 



trol functions, such as turning the pen on and off, selecting a color, and 
loading or saving a picture, are handled with single keypress commands 
instead of with a pen-based submenu. If you forget the commands, 
they're as close as the help screen. Just hit H. 

Assisted Triple Play. Some of the other programs support and add 
to the capabilities of Sketch. EasyEdit allows you to clean up your pic- 
ture. Geomed II lets you put perfect geometric forms in your hi-res draw- 
ings. Penpainter is an innovation in color-fill programs that makes the 
most hardened adult yearn for a disk-based coloring book to play with. 

Even with the most precision equipment, the human hand is not 
completely steady, so anything you create with Sketch is likely to con- 
tain small glitches — lines that don't quite come together or details that 
don't look quite right. With EasyEdit, you point the pen at an area on 
the hi-res display and you instantly zoom in on the image in that area. 
That is, a forty by twenty-four pixel section of the hi-res image will be in- 
stantly translated to the text screen. Each pixel that's on (white) is repre- 




Left: This cozy domestic scene was created using Sketch. Sketch, Geomed II, and the Penpainter sketch mode all include a powerful mirroring 
function that can be set for two-way horizontal, two-way vertical, or four-way mirroring. The symmetry of the furniture was accomplished with two- 
way vertical mirroring. Center: Using EasyEdit, the rough lines of the picture on the left are smoothed out point by point. EasyEdit was also used to 
create the face and other detail work. Individual pixels from the hi-res display are blown up to the size of Apple text characters in EasyEdit's zoom 
mode. Right: The domestic scene after EasyEdit. The line drawing is clean and was relatively easy to create. It is now ready to go on the Penpainter 
to pick up some color. 



Steven Gibson, the creator of the LPS II, originally intended the de- 
vice and its machine language driver program, Pentrak, as a graphics aid 
for programmers, but light pens had such a bad reputation that com- 
puter retailers wouldn't even look at it. Undaunted, he set out to create 
demonstration programs. He soon got so caught up in the wonder of his 
own product that the demos grew to a full graphics system. 

No graphics system on the market makes a fair comparison with the 
LPS II. The paddle and keyboard based systems are all somewhat diffi- 
cult to use. Keyboard input just doesn't lend itself to easy graphics ap- 
plication. Paddles' problem lies in their duality you need both members 
of a pair to control horizontal and vertical cursor movement, and pad- 
dles aren't designed for one person to operate both dials at the same 
time. Joysticks aren't much better; although simpler to manipulate than 
paddles, they don't give as fine a degree of control. 

The Apple Graphics Tablet comes the closest to the LPS II, but hav- 
ing to point to the tablet and watch the CRT just isn't the same as point- 
ing the pen directly at the screen and seeing the image appear right be- 
neath the pen tip. 

"Don't Point That Thing at Me!" The system is operated from a 
central menu program that comes up when you boot the Pentrak master 
disk or whenever you exit one of the system's programs. The menu is the 
first inkling an unsuspecting user has of the actual capabilities of the pen. 
You merely point the pen at the program you want. Many of the pro- 
grams in the system use similar submenus, making the whole package as 
friendly as you could ask for. 

For. each of the programs, there's a help listing accessible from the 
keyboard. The programs are so interactive and easy to use that the one- 
page help listings are all it takes to make the programs completely self-ex- 
planatory. 

After running Introduction (which gives an overview of the system) 
and Calibrate (which ensures that the pen is honed in to your individual 
screen), the logical place to go is Sketch. This is a drawing program that's 
as easy to use as pen and paper but more versatile. The pen has six col- 
ors, and the whole image can be erased or switched to a reversed display 
(black on white instead of white on black) at any time. 

Because Sketch uses the whole screen as its drawing pad, all the con- 



sented by an inverse space (which appears as a white block the same size 
as the Apple's flashing cursor), and each pixel that's off (black) is repre- 
sented by a normal (white-on-black) dash. You then use the pen to 
change the image point by point. The result is a picture with clean lines, 
well defined angles, and fine curves. 

Penpainter is perhaps the most powerful and exciting program on the 
Pentrak disk. Penpainter is a fill program that doesn't have to be told 
twice. Where most fill routines may miss a section of the area they're sup- 
posed to cover and require the user to try again to get the missed areas, 
Penpainter'^ fill algorithm never misses. It actually seems to find and fill 
its "missed" areas itself, so filling even the most complexly shaped area is 
always a one-step process. 

The first thing you do when you enter Penpainter is load the picture 
into what Gibson has called "border memory." The picture you start 
with must be a black-on-white line drawing created with Sketch, 
Penpainter'?, mini-sketch routine, the other programs, or any other 
graphics system. If your outline drawing is white-on-black, Penpainter 
can reverse it with a single pen stroke. Selecting the border memory op- 
tion makes the black lines thicker and copies the screen to a separate 
location. 

South of the Border. The purpose of the separate storage location is 
to allow you to change your mind. When you fill an area, Penpainter de- 
termines the area to fill by looking at border memory, not at the actual 
picture. It performs the action of filling on the displayed screen but leaves 
border memory as it is. If you don't like the pattern you first selected, 
you can replace it with another with no hassle — even if your first choice 
was black. 

You may have noticed the word pattern where you might have ex- 
pected color. This is another unique feature of Penpainter: it fills with pat- 
terns. The disk comes with a file containing ninety-one different pat- 
terns. Some are solid colors, some are mixed colors such as other graph- 
ics programs offer, and some are repeated patterns. 

The beauty of this approach is that you can create your own patterns 
using another of the programs on the disk: Pattern Editor. You can easi- 
ly create any conceivable pattern from wallpaper to herringbone, from 
water to brick wall. 




Left The palette of patterns in Penpainter displays ninety-one different color and pattern options. The Info-Flow diagram at the bottom not only 
shows the options available, but suggests the logical order of the painting process as well. Right: The domestic scene in color. Some of the patterns 
used came with the Patterns file on the disk; others were custom made with the Pattern Editor. Any of the patterns in the picture can be changed by 
selecting a new pattern and pointing the pen. 



The outstanding system is not without problems. One minor annoy- 
ance is that these programs have no protection from ordinary disk er- 
rors, like file locked, file not found, and disk full. These problems won't 
occur if you do everything right, but to err is human. The only other 
problem with the current implementation of the graphics system is that 
you have to save the picture before you can pass control from one pro- 
gram to another. Gibson will release a unified graphics system that elimi- 
nates these problems by the end of November, but even in its present

form LPS II is easier to use than any other graphics system extant. The 
update will be free to all LPS II owners. 

Two programs are included that don't tie in with the others in the 
graphics system but are interesting in their own right. Music allows you 
to use the pen to compose short musical pieces that it plays with the Pen- 
trak sound routines. Animate lets you make a twenty-frame graphic car- 
toon frame by frame and point by point. The graphics in the cartoon can 
be as complicated as your patience allows. While both of these are really 
only demo programs and have the limitations that that implies, Gibson 
plans to expand on them if there is sufficient user interest. 

Happy Hour. All the programs are written in unprotected Applesoft 
Basic, so they're open for intrepid programmers to build on and modify. 
In fact, Gibson has deliberately left them uncopyrighted. He figures that 
if people take routines from his programs and put them into their own, 
even for commercial purposes, it won't hurt his business. It will just sell 
more pens. 

For the Applesoft programmer, the programs that come with the 
LPS II are just the beginning. The Pentrak driver is the software heart of 
the graphics programs, but more than that, it was designed for easy ac- 
cess from Basic. The machine language routines that allow the pen to 
work its magic are available to the ordinary programmer. 

Pentrak uses the ampersand hook, which may be somewhat familiar 
to those who have used the Renumber program from the DOS System 
Master. Simply, Applesoft's ampersand command (&) calls a machine 
language routine at a specific location. The routine is then able to read 
the characters foDowing the ampersand in the Basic program and inter- 
pret them as further commands. 

So loading the Pentrak driver adds a whole new set of commands to 
Applesoft. A Pentrak command that demonstrates the typical com- 
mand syntax is &PEN(X.Y.KEY.ZV60). This tells the computer to fol- 
low the pen's position on the screen and put the values for its location in- 
to the variables X and Y when an escape condition is met. Two escape 
conditions are given in this example. Key, the third parameter in the pa- 
rentheses, says to escape when a key is pressed and put the ASCII value of 
that key into the variable key. ZV in the fourth parameter stands for zero 
velocity. ZV60 says to escape when the pen has been aimed at the same 
point on the screen for sixty machine cycles, or one second. While key 
and ZK are the only escape conditions available, the variable parameter 
on ZK and the possibility of using the conditions alone or in combina- 
tion make the commands that use escape conditions extremely flexible. 

DocuDramas. The Pentrak system includes other commands and 
options to draw a black or white rectangle anywhere on the hi-res screen, 
produce sounds, write in various character sets on hi-res, negate a screen, 
switch to hi-res without clearing the screen, and perform many other

There are some exciting programs soon to be released which will use

Besnard. Stoneware is updating its Graphics Processing System to use the 
pen, and Island Graphics is releasing a hi-res drawing program, Illustra- 
tor II, with complete LPS II compatibility. Gibson Laboratories is work- 
ing on Pastrak, a version of the Pentrak driver that will be compatible 
with Pascal, Fortran, and Pilot. 

The Method behind the Magic. Here are some technical goodies for 
the electronics buffs. If you believe in magic, you may find the realities 
behind it a bit disillusioning, but if you believe in hardware, we will now 
answer the burning question, "How does it all work?" 

Anyone who has seen a light pen before has probably been pro- 
foundly unimpressed. The typical device of that name is a passive light 
receptor that returns a value from 0 to 255 to the Apple through the 
game I/O port. This value represents an analog to digital conversion of 
the light intensity where the pen is pointed. It can't even tell if the light 
source is on the Apple screen or not. The only resemblance it bears to a 
pen is its shape. 

The LPS // is in a class well beyond its unsophisticated predecessors. 
Its plastic-encased interface card looks like an audio cassette case with 
teeth. It plugs into a peripheral slot rather than the game port. Instead 
of reading light intensity, its hardware actually synchronizes with the 
computer's video signal. The pen's receptor is sensitive enough to deter- 
mine when the monitor's scan line passes the tip. Because \hs Pentrak 
driver has been tracking the scan's horizontal and vertical positions, it 
can return a pair of numbers for the hi-res X, Y coordinates. Applesoft 
can read these numbers, and the magic begins. 

At the moment, only about five hundred of Gibson's pens have 
been sold. That's less than two-tenths of a percent of the Apple user base. 
And yet, when professional programmers see this device they seem in- 
stantly to want to write software for it. To experience the wonder is to 
know that the LPS II will become a significant factor in the Apple mar- 
ketplace. Now people are writing software that will help sell the pen, but 
in another year, it will be the pen that is selling their software. Di 



Note: The LPS II currently works with any monitor or television except for the 
Apple green monitor III and the green Amdek monitor Gibson is testing wider spec- 
trum diodes to eliminate this limitation. The Pentrak driver requires an Apple II with 
48K and DOS 3.3.

Hf!|VE AN APPLE 
SPLIT 




Have you ever wanted to create a display with both lo-res graphics 
and hi-res graphics on the same screen? Or graphics with more than just 
four lines of text at the bottom? Or how about text with four lines of 
graphics? 

As we all know, the Apple II has only five display formats. It can dis- 
play all lo-res graphics, all hi-res graphics, all text, lo-res with four lines 
of text at the bottom, or hi-res with four lines of text at the bottom. The 
latter two formats are sometimes called mixed modes because they al- 
low, in a very restricted way, the mixing of graphics and text. But, ac- 
cording to page 12 of the Apple II Reference Manual, "There is no way to 



display both graphics modes at the same time." Well, not only are there 
ways of displaying both graphics modes on the same screen, it is also 
possible to display any combination of modes! 

The technique of mixing display modes by the process of screen split- 
ting is familiar to programmers who've used the Apple III, the Atari 400 
and 800 machines, and several other computers. These machines con- 
tain special hardware that helps detect what is referred to as vertical

hows and whys of screen splitting, let's look at an example of screen split- 
ting on the Apple II. Listings 1 and 2 present a short Applesoft main pro- 
gram and a machine language subroutine that the program calls. 

Take a few moments now to turn on your Apple and enter these two 
programs. Don't worry if you don't understand machine language. Just 
go into the Monitor from Basic by typing call— 151 followed by the re- 
turn key. Then start typing in the hexadecimal values for the listing 2 
subroutine that starts at $0300: 

300:8D 52 CO A9 EO A2 

and so on followed by the return key. 

Now run the Applesoft program. What do you see? (Nothing, if you 
didn't type in the listings correctly.) You should see a text message in the 
top half of the screen and lo-res color graphics in the bottom half. This is 
a display mode that's supposed to be impossible to create on a standard 
Apple II computer! 

To understand how to do screen splitting on the Apple II, you must 
be familiar not only with 6502 machine language but also with how the 




UNDISPLAYED 



Figure 1. Memory mapping of bytes on hi-res page. 

Apple maps its memory onto the display screen. (The latter information 
can be found on pages 14 through 21 of the Apple II Reference Manual.) 
The essence of what we need to know about hi-res in particular is shown 
in figure 1 . Each line of the display is forty bytes long from left to right, 
and there are 192 such lines from top to bottom. The memory mapping 
seems somewhat haphazard: consecutive memory locations don't map 
onto consecutive lines of the display. FinaUy, for each set of 128 bytes of 
display memory only 120 bytes (three lines' worth) are di^layed. The re- 
maining eight bytes of the 128-byte set are never seen and are therefore 
sometimes referred to as the "undisplayed" or "unused" bytes. These un- 
displayed bytes all lie, conceptually, just off the bottom right-hand edge 
of the display, as shown in figure 1. 

Text and lo-res both map in a way similar to hi-res, except that each 
cluster of eight lines now comes from one set of forty bytes instead of 
eight sets, and instead of the screen buffer being located at $2000 through 
$3FFF it lies at $0400 through $07FF. (Compare the Apple II Reference 
Manual pages 16 and 18 with page 21.) 

Some Preliminary Insights. Let's try a few experiments that might 
give us some clues as to how screen splitting can be accomplished. From 
Basic type the command call —151 (followed by return) to get into the 
Monitor. Next, clear the screen by issuing the escape— shift-? sequence. 
Now type C051 followed by return. (Hitting return will always be as- 
sumed from now on.) The computer will probably display: 

C051- AO 

(If it doesn't, try typing C051 again.) 

Typing C051 from the Monitor is the way to turn on text mode if the 
computer is displaying graphics. But since we're already in text mode, 
nothing much happens — nothing much except that the contents of 
$C051 are displayed. But $C051 isn't supposed to be a readable ad- 
dress; it's merely a screen switch. So what does it mean for $C051 to con- 
tain $A0? Is it just a coincidence that $A0 is the hex code for an ASCII 
blank, and that most of the screen is also blank? What would happen if 
we typed C054? Or C056? Again, we tend to get $A0 if the screen is most- 
ly blank. 

Let's try another experiment. Again from the Monitor, type: 

2000:73 200K 2000.3FFEM 

followed by: 

C050 C053 CO 57 

You should see some vertical hi-res lines with space for four lines of text 
at the bottom of the screen. Now type Q)50, or Q)53, or C054, or C057. 
Most of the time we now see $73 in the screen switch locations, and once 
in a while we see $A0. (Remember that the bottom four text lines on the 
screen are mostly blank.) 

The results of the previous experiments suggest that by examining the 
screen switches we can somehow read the contents of at least part of the 
screen currently being displayed. But, to determine the time-history of 
what is being read, we must first find a way to "tag" the screen data and

then sample the saeen switches very quickly. Doing this would provide 
us with a cycle-by-cycle map of how the Apple's video is generated. In 
other words, we could determine which locations in memory the infor- 
mation in the screen switches is coming from during each clock cycle of 
the processor. Such a cycle-by-cycle map would be extremely useful in 
the implementation and understanding of screen splitting on the 
Apple II. 

Tagging and Sampling a Hi-Res Screen. Now let's create a special 
hi-res display. We'll put zeros in the forty bytes of the hi-res memory 
buffer that correspond to line 0 and ones in all the bytes corresponding to 
line 1. Line 2 will contain all twos, and so on. In other words, Une n will 
contain all n's, for n = 0 to 191 ($00 to $BF). But we still haven't tagged 
the undisplayed bytes in the bottom right-hand comer (screen lines 128 
through 191). Let's fill these sixty-four sets of eight-byte "invisible" lines 
with the values SCO through $FF. Then every byte in the primary hi-res 
display buffer ($2000 through $3FFF), whether displayed or not, will 
contain a known quantity from $00 to $FF. Listing 3 is a program for 
creating such a hi-res display of tagged screen data. Two versions are 
given; one in Integer Basic and one in Applesoft. Use Int^er if you have 
it. It's faster. 

Next we need to devise a way of quickly and uniformly sampling a 
screen svidtch over and over and saving each sample for later study. One 
way of doing this might be with a program like the following: 

LDX #$00 
LOOP LDA $0050 
STA $1000,X 
INX 

BNE LOOP 

This program is very short and straightforward, but it suffers from two 
major flaws: first, it does not provide the fastest possible sampling (be- 
cause of the time required for index register operations). Second, it al- 
lows only 256 data points to be sampled and stored. If we try to remedy 
the second flaw by changing the method of storage to STA (indirect),Y 
we not only aggravate the first flaw but introduce delays into the loop

that cause us to generate unevenly spaced samples after every two hun- 
dred fifty-sixth fetch. 

The best approach is to create a sampling program of the form: 

LDA $C050 
STA $1000 
LDA $C050 
STA $1001 
LDA $C050 
STA. $1002 

and so on. There's no loop involved; an individual set of LDA and STA 
commands is used for each check. Such a program is quite long (six bytes 
per sample) but executes very quickly (one sample per eight machine cy- 
cles) and yields uniformly spaced data. The programs in listing 4 gen- 
erate the machine language program just described. Again, use the Inte- 
ger version if you have that language. 

We're now ready for business. Having run the programs shown in 
listings 3 and 4, we have the tagged hi-res data starting at $2000 and the 
sampling program starting at $4000. We run the sampler by entering the 
Monitor and giving the command 4000G. After a brief flash of the screen 
the program terminates, leaving its collection of screen samples starting 
at $1000 in the Integer version or $8000 in the Applesoft version. 

Figure 2 is a partial listing of the key results of the sampling pro- 
gram. The entire listing of all the samples is much longer. Interested read- 
ers are encouraged to generate their own complete set of data using the 
programs described above. Before we can b^in interpreting these re- 
sults, we must discuss some fundamental concepts about television vid- 
eo and the Apple. 

Television Images. A standard television picture consists of 525 in- 
terlaced scan lines that start in the upper left-hand corner of the screen 
and end in the bottom-right. "Interlaced" means that the image on the 
screen is created by first scanning all the even lines of the picture and then 
going back and filling in all the odd hnes. In each scan line, the electron 
beam starts at the left side of the display and travels across the screen to 
the right, displaying one line of the image as it moves. When the beam

finishes at the right end of each scan line, it shuts off for a few microsec- 
onds while it repositions itself at the beginning of the next line to be 
scanned. This shut-off period is referred to as horizontal blanking (HBL). 
When the beam reaches the bottom of the screen and finishes scanning 
the last line, it again shuts off, this time for a few milliseconds, while it re- 
positions itself at the top of the display for the next frame of the image. 
This second turn-off period is referred to as vertical blanking (WBL). The 



total time required to complete one interlaced frame (including VBLs) is 
one-thirtieth of a second. 

When the Apple computer was first being designed, it was discov- 
ered that a computer-generated interlaced video signal produced a dis- 
play that had an objectionable flicker. So interlacing was not used, even 
though this meant that half of the potential vertical resolution would be 
lost. This lost spatial resolution allowed Apple to achieve increased tern-

Your mission.., to destroy the 
evil Mangan devices before they datnage 
yf iir cyber crystals,; the heart of the ^ ^ 




poral resolution; instead of generating only thirty video frames per sec- 
ond, the Apple generates sixty, because the Apple uses the interlace to 
display a new 192-line frame. 

A second design consideration in the Apple II was the decision not to 
overscan the screen. "Overscanning" means that the image extends slight- 
ly beyond the four edges of the screen so that the picture fills the entire 
viewing area. Instead, so that information in the comers won't be lost, 
the Apple leaves a small dark border of unused screen in all of its display 
modes. This further reduces the number of visible scan lines in each 
frame, so that only 192 lines remain in the display. 

The Apple transfers its video data to the screen at a rate of one byte 
per machine cycle. Each scan Une requires a total of sixty-five cycles from 
HBL to HBL. Since the Apple produces a forty-column display (forty 
byes per line), we can deduce that twenty-five cycles of each scan hne are 
spent in a tumed-off state and forty cycles are spent turned on. But even 
when the video is turned off, the screen switches can still be sampled. 
What will they contain? 

Interpreting the Sampled Results. Let's return to figure 2 to see what 
we can learn from our sampled data. Locations $1 19B through $1 19F all 
contain zeros. Our sampling program required eight cycles per sample. 
Consequently, the five samples represent forty machine cycles — exactly 
the duration of the visible part of one scan hne. 

Since the top line of our display was the only line containing all zeros, 
we infer that the data stored at $1 19B represents the beginning of a vid- 
eo frame. After three strange bytes ($1 lAO— $1 1A2) we see five ones in a 
row. These apparently represent the next scan line down, followed by 
three more strange bytes, and so on. 

Well, if we've identified the data that isn't strange as representing the 
visible portions of the scan lines, then it follows that the strange bytes 
must be coming during HBL, and that HBL maps from $81 lines ahead 
of the line just scanned. The fact that HBL seems to come from such a 
far-away place is confusing enough in itself, but why an odd number like 
$81 instead of a nice power of two or something (like $80)? Something 
about these results doesn't feel right; they just don't seem to make any 
sense. 

Well, our decision to attribute HBL to the end of a scan line was sim- 
ply one of convention. Since HBL occurs between scan lines, we could 
just as easily have attributed it to the beginning of a scan line. Then our 
interpretation of the data in figure 2 would be that a scan line consists of 
its visible forty-cycle component preceded by its invisible twenty-five- 
cycle HBL component, which is mapped from $40 display lines earlier. 
This model assumes a circular screen; that is, if counting up $40 lines 
would take you off the top of the screen, continue counting up from the 
bottom. 

If we interpret the data in this fashion, it soon becomes evident that: a 
complete sixty-five-cycle scan line consists of sixty-five consecutive bytes of 
display buffer memory that starts twenty-five bytes prior to the actual data 
to be displayed. (See figure 3.) We can even see the undisplayed bytes of 
the screen buffer (where we stored the values $C0 through $FF, remem- 
bei?) in locations $119A, $11 A2, and so on; they're right where we'd ex- 
pect them to be.

It is the "CYCLOTRON" that provides life sustaining 
energy to the surrounding empire, a vital source of power. 
If destroyed the empire would soon fall to the enemy 
Mangan forces. Within the CYCLOTRON lie the accel- 
erator tubes, they bathe the cyber crystal power source with 
constant energy. The evil Mangans launch terror weapons, 
strange devices that streak downward toward the 
CYCLOTRON, twisting and turning through the acceler- 
ator tubes bombarding the crystals, destroying the source of 
life itself. The Mangan weapons are a pseudo life form and 
can mutate to faster and deadlier devices at anytime. Each 
hit on a cyber crystal takes it up one level closer to the 
critical stage, with each stage there comes a color change. 
And on the fourth hit the crystal goes totally critical and 
destroys all the other crystals. 

You're provided with repair pods that are generated at 
regular intervals, they can affect some repairs to cool down 
active cyber crystals. After each attack wave an enemy spy 
ship surveys the area for damage, preparing for the next 
attack. This lull in the battle allows you to gain enough fuel 
to re-energize your destructor, but only once during each at- 
tack wave. 

The Mangans are fast, but you have to be faster. How 
long can you hold out?

If we now look at locations $17AB through $17AF in figure 2 we 
see that they all contain $BF, which represents the bottom line of the dis- 
play. Thus $17B0 must be the start of VBL. During VBL the data acts 
just as if it were starting a whole new frame from the beginning, but it 
never finishes this pseudo-frame. After getting one third of the way 
through the frame (to scan line $3F), it suddenly repeats the previous six 
scan lines ($3A through $3F) before aborting to begin the next true 
frame. Examine locations $1970 through $19FF in figure 2. 

If we had done our tagging and sampling exercise using a lo-res or 
text screen instead, the results would have been similar. The only differ- 
ence would have been that each row of sixty-five bytes in the display 
would be repeated eight times, since both text and lo-res "characters" are 
eight scan lines tall. 

Example Program Revisited. Now that we have a better feeling for 
what's going on, let's go back and try to understand how the screen split- 
ting example in listing 1 worked. 

The for- next loop in lines 200 through 250 does three things: 

1. Line 210 pokes the value $E0 into the middle line of text/low-res 
display. 

2. Line 220 pokes the value SAO into the bottom line of the display. 

3. Lines 230 and 240 create a simple lo-res pattern of colored verti- 
cal lines. 

After printing a text message (lines 300 through 310) in the top part 
of the screen, the program calls (in line 400) the machine language screen 
splitting subroutine located at $0300. Line 500 then keeps re-calling the 
subroutine so that screen splitting will continue. Screen splitting is a dy- 
namic process; it requires a program to keep it working. If the program 
stops, screen splitting stops. Try hitting control-C and see what happens. 

Now let's examine the machine language subroutine. Ironically, one 
of the first things we have to do to produce a mixed mode display is to 
turn off the mixed mode screen switch, $C052. Since we'll be doing our 
own mixing we don't want the Apple to confuse things by putting in its 
own mode switching. The rest of the routine consists of two virtually 



identical polling loops. 

The first loop ($0305 through $03(E) sets text mode by referencing 
screen switch $C051 and, at the same time, waits for four consecutive 
$EOs to be scanned. Where do these $EOs come from? From the middle of 
the display screen where they were poked by line 210 of the Applesoft 
program! When the $EOs are detected, the subroutine enters the second 
polling loop ($0311 through $031 A). This loop sets lo-res graphics mode 
by referencing screen switch $C050 and then waits for four consecutive 
$AOs (from the bottom line of the display) to be scanned. Once the $AOs 
have been detected, the mode is set back to text (at location $03 1 B) and 
the subroutine returns to the main program. 

There are a few subtleties here that should be pointed out. Why, for 
example, do we require four consecutive occurrences of SAO and $E0 in- 
stead of just one? The reason for this can be inferred from figure 3. We 
see that every displayed line also has a part of itself mapped into some other 
display line's twenty-five-cycle "invisible" HBL component. This compli- 
cates the problem of detecting where the beam is currently scanning on 
the display. How do we know whether the data being sampled is coming 
from a visible scan or from an invisible HBL? Well, a visible scan con- 
sists of forty cycles of data, while the invisible HBL can only be twenty- 
five cycles at most. So, by requiring several consecutive samples whose 
fetching times total more than twenty-five cycles duration, we will dimi- 
nate false triggerings from HBL. Be careful not to exceed forty cycles or 
you'll miss the visible data too. 

The process of mode changing sometimes tends to produce small un- 
sightly glitches on the display screen. To test this out, change the con- 
tents of location $0305 in our example program in listing 2 to be either a 
$03 or a $02 and see if it makes any difference in the display. You can see 
how it's a good idea to try to change modes during HBL (or VBL) rath- 
er than in the middle of a visible scan line. 

Another subtlety in the example program lies in our choice of $A0 
and $E0 as tag bytes. While any values could have been used as tags, the 
values $A0 and $E0 are especially useful because they both appear as

blanks on a text screen. On a lo-res graphics screen they appear (in our 
example) as a row of black (or blank) over a row of color. Thus these val- 
ues provide a convenient way of switching cleanly between text and 
graphics modes. 

In Conclusion. From our examination of the example program, we see 
that screen splitting consists of essentially two steps. First, the screen 
must be preformatted with "tagged" lines at the points where screen 
splitting is to occur (that is, the SAO and $E0 lines in our example). Sec- 
ond, a machine language subroutine must be written that detects these 
tagged lines and then quickly switches display modes. But the process is 
far from being trivial, and it requires a certain amount of creativity and 
ingenuity to design screens that can be split cleanly and effectively. 

What are some applications of screen splitting? Well, it can provide 
for a little more variety and flexibility in display modes above and be- 
yond the basic five that everyone knows about. To this end I have used 
screen splitting to create the opening displays for several commercially 
available games {Maxwell's Demon/ Bishop's Square, from Datasoft, 
Inc.; Money Mmchers, from DataMost). 

In addition to splitting a screen, we can superimpose screens. For ex- 
ample, if we print some words on the primary text screen and plot some 
lo-res colors in the corresponding locations of the secondary lo-res 
screen, then by screen switching, we could produce text on top of a col- 
ored background (if we don't mind a little bit of flicker). Similarly, by 
combining the two hi-res pages in such a way that the primary page has 
all of its high bits off while the secondary page has all of its high bits on, 
we can generate true 560 x 192 hi-res graphics. It is thai possible to write 
a hi-res character generator for this mode that, in effect, produces eighty 
columns of text (in hi-res) without benefit of an eighty-column card! 

The possibilities arising from screen splitting seem quite exciting, to 
say the least. But there is, unfortunately, one fly in the ointment — the 
technique may not work on all Apples. Looking at the screen switches 
like we've been doing is called "reading the floating bus," and it's some- 
thing that Apple Computer never intended to be done. Therefore, they 
make no guarantees that the data read in this manner will be meaning- 
ful, especially when certain peripheral cards are plugged into the expan- 
sion slots. In fact, this method of screen splitting doesn't work on the Ap-

pie III at all, even in emulation mode, because its bus doesn't float. But 
there seem to be very few Apple lis in which the method can't be made 
to work when the incompatible peripherals are unplugged. 

If you can't get screen splitting to work on your Apple, you might 
want to try running the machine language program shown in listing 5. 
Load a hi-res picture into the primary display buffer ($2000 through 
$3FFF), create any lo-res display on the primary lo-res screen, and then 
run the program at $1000. 

This program is an example of screen splitting using nothing but tim- 
ing loops. But there's no way to synchronize the splitting. So, each time 
you run the program, the split will occur at a different vertical position 
on the screen, depending on which scan line you just happen to catch the 
beam on. This program should work on all Apples. Hi

Tools of the Craft, Part 16 

You may think of a single index array, such 
as those we discussed last time, as correspond- 
ing to a row of individual elements, all Hned up, 
shoulder to shoulder, like suburban tract 
homes. Given the row of houses on, say, Tan- 
glewood Street, you need only a single piece of 
information — the house number — in order to 
identify and find any particular one. 

What if you want to find a certain house 
within the subdivision? Assuming that there are 
streets other than Tanglewood in the neighbor- 
hood, you must now use at least two separate 
pieces of information — the house number and 
the street name — to distinguish a single home 
from its neighbors. We cannot conveniently 
model an entire neighborhood using a single in- 
dex array. Since we need two pieces of informa- 
tion to specify a particular house in the "real 
world," our computer model should use two in- 
dependent indices, one denoting the street name, 
the other signifying the house number. 

Matrices: Dimensions without End. When 
an array has more than one index, it is some- 
times called a multiple index, or multidi- 
mensioned array. (A single index array is said to 
be one-dimensional, a dual index array is called 
two-dimensional, and so on.) More often, how- 
ever, and from now on in this column, a multi- 
ple index array is called a matrix (plural 
matrices). One way to create a matrix is to de- 
clare a single index array such that the individ- 
ual elements also happen to be arrays. Here's 
how that technique would be used to create a 
two-dimensional matrix, Neighborhood: 

CONST 
MinHouseNum= 1; 
MaxHouseNum= 199 (* unrealistic *); 

TYPE 

Home= Integer (* may be any data type *); 
Street= (* one-dimensional *) ARRAY 

[MinhouseNum .. MaxHouseNum] 
OF Home; ' 
StreetName= (Redwood, Tanglewood, 
Sandalwood, Driftwood); 
VAR 
Neighborhood 
:ARRAY [StreetName] OF STREET; 
(* two-dimensional!! *) 
As you might expect, the array element 
Neighborhood[Sandalwood] refers to Sandal- 
wood Street, and all 199 houses on it. But, since 
the array element is itself an array, you may ap- 
pend an extra index to it in order to access the 
information for any single house on Sandal- 
wood Street. Thus, "Neighborhood [Sandal- 
wood][153]" refers to 153 Sandalwood Street, 
"Neighborhood [Sandalwood] [12]" corre- 
sponds to 12 Sandalwood Street, and so on. 



Similarly, "Neighborhood [Driftwood]" spec- 
ifies all of Driftwood Street, while "Neighbor- 
hood[Driftwood][75]" refers to a single house 
on that street. 

In defining Neighborhood, we declared the 
types Home, HouseNumber, Street, and Street- 
name, as well as the constants MinHouseNum 
and MaxHouseNum in order to shorten and 
clarify the final matrix definition. It's good 
practice to use such subsidiary types as tools for 
improving the readability of your programs, 
and we've already discussed the desirability of 
using named constants whenever possible. Still, 
this is a matter of programming style, and Pas- 
cal does not force you to do things this way. 
Here is a valid recasting of Neighborhood that 
does not use any subsidiary data types or 
named constants. 

VAR 
Neighborhood 
:ARRAY [(Redwood, Tanglewood, Sandal- 
wood, Driftwood)] OF ARRAY [1 . . 199] OF 
Integer; 

(* two-dimensional!! *) 

As you can see, this second version of 
Neighborhood is somewhat unwieldy, and less 
transparent than its predecessor. It isn't clear, 
for instance, that "Redwood," "Tanglewood," 
"Sandalwood," and "Driftwood" are street 
names; that "1..199" denotes a range of house 
numbers, or that the base element of the matrix, 
declared as Integer, is intended to model a 
home. Nevertheless, the Apple Pascal compiler 
will accept this form of array definition as readi- 
ly as it will the more detailed form. It is up to 
you whether or not (or how often) to use sub- 
sidiary data typjes and named constants in your 
data declarations. Keep in mind that they con- 
tribute not only clarity but also flexibility to a 
program, as you'U soon see. 

Of course, you may find yourself using sub- 
sidiary data types just to shorten matrix defini- 
tions. A declaration that looks like "'array . . .of 
array . . . of array . . . of array . . . of .y may 
simply be too cumbersome for your tastes. Take 
heart! Pascal includes an abbreviated syntax for 
declaring and accessing matrices. You may 
group all the index descriptors (or indices) to- 
gether, separating them with commas, between 
a single set of square brackets. For example, 
either 

Mati: ARRAY [Monday . . Friday] OF 
ARRAY [1 . . 10] OF Integer 

or 

Mat2: ARRAY [Monday . . Friday, 1 . . 10] 
OF Integer 

defines a two-dimensional matrix that contains 



a total of fifty Integer elements, where the first 
index may range from Monday to Friday 
(which, we presume, are values of a previously 
declared enumerated type), while the second 
may range from 1 to 10. Similarly, 
Mati [Tuesday, 5] 

and 

Mat1[Tuesday][5] 
are identical references to the fifth element in 
the Tuesday row of matrix Mati. No matter 
how a matrix has been declared, Apple Pascal 
takes after its UCSD Pascal relatives in permit- 
ting you to use either the full or the abbreviated 
syntax in accessing matrix elements. Not every 
implementation of Pascal is so accommodat- 
ing, however. Some do not permit you to use 
the abbreviated syntax when accessing a matrix 
that was declared using the full syntax. Be care- 
ful about this if you ever write programs for a 
different Pascal compiler. 

Array Size Considerations. Apple Pascal 
does not limit the number of indices that a ma- 
trix may have. As we saw last time, only minor 
limits are placed on the range of values that an 
index may acquire. On the other hand, practi- 
cal limits on both the number and range of in- 
dices are imposed by the availability of RAM 
memory in your Apple. Even an apparently 
small array can require prohibitively large 
amounts of memory, depending upon the num- 
ber and ranges of its indices. For instance, here 
is an apparently small, three-dimensional ma- 
trix that takes the same amount of space as one 
thousand Integers: 

BigMat: ARRAY [1..10, 

(Black, Red, Yellow, Blue, 
White), 1..20] OF Integer; 

To determine the memory space required by 
any array or matrix, you must multiply the 
cardinalities of all the indices together, then 
multiply that product by the amount of space 
required by a single element. The cardinality of 
an index is the number of distinct values that in- 
dex can assume. For example, the first of Big- 
Mat's indices can assume ten different values 
(from 1 to 10), so its cardinality is ten. The 
cardinalities of the second and third indices are 
five and twenty, respectively. Ten times five 
times twenty is one thousand. An Integer takes 
up two bytes, so BigMat requires two thousand 
bytes of your computer's RAM. 

How Many Bytes? The built-in function 
SizeOf allows you to determine the memory re- 
quirements for any variable or data type. Size- 
Of takes as its single argument an identifier that 
names either a specific variable, or a data type. 
It returns, as its function value, the number of 



OCTOBER 1982 



SOCTAI K 



bytes occupied by the specified variable, or by a 
variable of the specified type. SizeOf (Integer) is 
two, for instance. SizeOf (Char) and SizeOf 
(Boolean) are also two. SizeOf (Real) is four, 
and SizeOf (BigMat) is two thousand. What is 
SizeOf (Neighborhood)? 

Use caution when applying the SizeOf func- 
tion to large arrays or matrices. The number re- 
turned by SizeOf will be negative if the actual 
size of the structure is greater than 32,767 bytes. 
This is not a failing in SizeOf, but rather a natu- 
ral consequence of the representation of In- 
tegers in Apple Pascal. Remember that under 
normal circumstances. Integers may never be 
larger than 32,767, nor smaller than —32,768. 

Because of the characteristics of Apple Pas- 
cal's internal Integer representation, any num- 
ber that grows larger than 32,767, but remains 
smaller than 65,536 (perhaps because of an ad- 
dition or multiplication operation), is auto- 
matically translated into the negative region. 
For instance, 32767 + 1 = -32768, 16000*3 = 
- 17536, and so on. Because of the difficulties of 
dealing with this overflow, your programs 
should not perform arithmetic on the value of 
SizeOf if the structure being measured is likely 
to exceed 32,767 bytes in size. 

On the other hand, if you're simply curious 
as to the size of a particular variable or data 
structure, you can write a short program that 
merely displays the value that SizeOf returns for 
it. If the size is negative, you may assume that 
the actual size lies between 32,767 and 65,536 
bytes. To determine the precise number of bytes 
occupied by the structure simply add the n^a- 



tive value of SizeOf to 65,536. Thus, 65536 -I- 
(-32768) = 32768 (or 32767 + 1). Similarly, 
65536 + (-17536) = 48000 (or 16000*3). 

Whither the Neighborhood? So long as its 
basic element, the Home, is designed to accom- 
modate all the data that must be kept on behalf 
of a home and its occupants, our neighbor- 
hood matrix can serve as the foundation for an 
interactive data manipulation program, suit- 
able for use by anyone who needs to organize 
and maintain information about individual 
homes in a neighborhood (for instance, news- 
paper distributors, utility companies, door-to- 
door vendors, governmental agencies). 

The data that comprises an appropriate 
model of a single home, of course, depends 
upon the nature of the program's user. The 
newspaper carrier, for example, probably needs 
to know whether or not to deliver a paper at a 
given address, and also whether to deliver on 
weekdays, Sundays, or both. The Pascal defini- 
tion of a Home would reflect these needs. On 
the other hand, a completely different defini- 
tion would be required by a telephone compa- 
ny that is concerned with the number and loca- 
tion of outlets within a home, as well as the tele- 
phone number and type of service associated 
with each outlet (for example, rotary or touch 
tone). 

Once the data structure has been defined, it 
is a reasonably simple matter to write functions 
and procedures that permit its manipulation. A 
minimum program would provide some way 
for the user to examine the data for all or part of 
a neighborhood, and to update data for an in- 



65 

dividual home. In this and future installments, 
we will develop and refine just such a program, 
using the Neighborhood matrix, in which the 
definition of Home will be optimized to serve 
the needs of a hypothetical cable television 
company. 

Birth of a Program. Despite what many 
pedagogues would have you believe, most pro- 
grams don't spring full-blown from precise, 
comprehensive specifications written in Eng- 
lish. Instead, they start as relatively small pro- 
totypes ("skeletons"), and are scaled-up and 
fleshed-out as necessary to improve their per- 
formance or increase their flexibility. Starting 
small means that the programmer need not 
wait very long to see the program in action. A 
program that does something useful can be 
built — and pressed into service — quickly. 

When it comes time to improve the proto- 
type, the programmer can take advantage of the 
software environment provided by the existing 
tool — constants, variables, types, procedures, 
and functions — rather than waste time creating 
and assembling a new (and possibly redun- 
dant) one. Moreover, building upon previously 
written, well-exercised code helps the program- 
mer to confine his inevitable errors and mis- 
judgments to only the comparatively small 
amount of new code that embodies the im- 
provements or extensions, thus making it easier 
to detect, trace, and correct those mistakes. 

Of course, it is possible to build a prototype 
program in such a way that it cannot evolve 
easily or cleanly. Unfortunate decisions made 
when defining key variables, data types, proce-

dures, and functions will return to haunt you 
when the time comes to modify your proto- 
type. You can avoid many of these pitfalls sim- 
ply by remembering that your program is 
bound to change, sooner or later, as long as 
you continue to use it. This will help you to 
write programs that are amenable to modifica- 
tion. As we develop programs, we will try to 
make the "correct" design and implementation 
decisions, and will attempt to describe not only 
the rationale behind them, but also some of the 
mistakes that can be made at each develop- 
mental step.

END (* Cable *). 

This skeleton concentrates on defining the 
data that will be manipulated by the program. 
The main structure, of course, is a two-dimen- 
sional matrix of Homes, indexed (and thus, or- 
ganized) by street name and house number. We 
choose for now to represent a Home as only an 
account number (that is, as a nonnegative In- 
teger), such that a number greater than zero im- 
plies that the corresponding Home subscribes to 
the cable service. If we are careful, we will find it 
easy to change the definition of Home at a later 
date, so as to accommodate a more complete in- 
formational model of a subscriber's home. 

To promote future fiexibility, the range of 
account numbers is defined as a subrange data 
type, expressed in terms of the named con- 
stants NoSubscriber and MaxAcctNum. The 
subrange type HouseNumber is also defined in 
terms of a constant, MaxHNum. Consistent use 
of these type and constant names throughout 
Cable will pave the way for changing the future 
size of our model, as necessary, simply by chang- 
ing the declared constant values. 

You have probably noticed that the struc- 
ture previously known as a Neighborhood has 
been renamed a Town, in recognition of the fact 
that cable television franchises are seldom limit- 
ed to a residential subdivision, but usually en- 
compass entire municipalities. A Town is phy- 
sically no different from our old Neighbor- 
hood, but the structure's new name seems more 
descriptive of its actual significance to our pro- 
gram's user. We have also moved the descrip- 
tion of the Town structure into the type sec- 
tion, and have in fact chosen to describe no 
structures explicitly in the var section. Instead, 
every variable declared in the var section will be 
associated with a named type, as Smallville is

associated with Town. 

CComType exists because we'll need some 
way to select between Cable's various func- 
tions; a variation of NewCommand, the com- 
mand handler that we developed in the August 
1982 issue of So/talk, should serve this pur- 
pose nicely. As you'll recall, NewCommand re- 
turned a value of a special "command indica- 
tor" type, hence CComType here. 

The constants Header and Blank are the 
products of my own personal programming 
style. A program should always announce itself 
to the user, unless exceptional conditions dic- 
tate otherwise. A good method of doing this is 
to define a terse "header" message as a global 
string constant, then display that string at the 
eariiest feasible point in the program. As far as 
Blank is concerned, long experience teaches that 
the blank is used throughout almost every pro- 
gram that employs interactive input and out- 
put. Furthermore, it's often confusing to see a 
single blank as a character constant in a printed 
program listing, especially one that has been set 
in type. It's good, therefore, to define a single 
blank as a named constant, and use it consis- 
tently to avoid ambiguity. 

Now, let's consider the functions and pro- 
cedures in Cable's skeleton. Remember that we 
must always initialize variables, including ar- 
rays (and other structures that we'll study later). 
It stands to reason that we may have occasion 
to initialize a Town more than once in our pro- 
gram, so, rather than force ourselves to dupli- 
cate the necessary initialization code wherever it 
is needed, we have declared a special initializa- 
tion procedure, NewTown. Next are proce- 
dures for modifying and displaying the data set: 
ChangeTown and DisplayTown. Last is Cable- 
Command. 

At this point, all of Cable's routines are pre- 
sented as stubs (or dummies). In a developing 
program, stubs serve not only to remind the 
programmer that more work needs to be done, 
but also to permit finished portions of the pro- 
gram to be exercised and tested, in a limited 
fashion, even if they rely on unfinished rou- 
tines. A reasonable policy to follow when writ- 
ing stubs is simply to have them send a mes- 
sage to the console, announcing their imma- 
turity. Additionally, the stubs of functions 
should return "safe" function values that will 
not lead to complicated or potentially danger- 
ous behavior on the part of the calling routine. 

Function stubs must return some value, 
however, othenvise, the undefined value re- 
turned could cause the P-machine to abort the 
skeletal program after the function call, com- 
plaining of a "Value Range Error." This error 
occurs when the value of a variable, function, or 
expression exceeds the limits of its data type. (If, 
for instance, you tried to assign a negative val- 
ue to a variable of type AcctN umber, which, by 
definition, excludes all negative Integers, you 
would get a Value Range Error.) Consider the 
stubs of NewTown and CableCommand. Al- 
though both display "not implemented" mes- 
sages, CableCommand's stub also returns the 
safe CComType value of Quit. (Display and 
Change are less safe than Quit only because 
they force the Cable program to call still other

unfinished routines.) 

Arrays as Parameters. Every routine in Ca- 
ble that deals with a Town requires a single var 
parameter, the name of the Town being affect- 
ed. Thus, the procedure call 

NewTown (Smallville) 

would empty all the homes in Smallville, and 

NewTown (Metropolis) 

would initialize Metropolis. Had we not made 
provision for these parameters, we would have 
had to write each routine so that it accessed the 
global object, Smallville. If we then decided to 
change the name of our Town, or work with 
more than one Town, we would have had to up- 
date the bodies of three different procedures. 
Such concerns are eliminated by arranging to 
pass Towns to procedures as parameters. 

An entire array or matrix may be passed to 
a function or procedure as either a value pa- 
rameter or a var parameter, but there are a cou- 
ple of important points to consider in deciding 
which method to use. Remember that the re- 
ceiver of a var parameter gets to manipulate on- 
ly a "voodoo doll" of the actual parameter. The 
"doll" is very small, requiring almost no mem- 
ory space, and the P-machine takes practically 
no time at all in delivering it to the receiver. The 
receiver must take care, however, since any- 
thing it does to its "voodoo doll" permanently 
affects the actual parameter. 

In contrast, passing an array as a value pa- 
rameter can consume unreasonable amounts of 
time and (memory) space. Consider that Pascal 
provides the receiver of a value parameter with 
its own, private, full-scale copy of the actual pa- 
rameter. This is fine if the actual parameter is an 
Integer, Char, Boolean, Real, or enumerated 
value. But what if it is an array? Then, Pascal 
must duplicate the array, including each and 
every element, for the benefit of the receiver. If 
the array has, say, five thousand elements, it 
might take a second or so for your computer to 
finish the task. That doesn't seem like very 
much time, but it could slow your program 
down greatly if the receiver of such a parameter 
is called often. Even seconds add up, eventual- 
ly, to minutes and even hours of frustrating 
delay. 

Of course, even if the copy operation took 
no time at all, your computer probably does not 
have enough memory to accommodate multi- 
ple copies of a large array or matrix. Keep this 
in mind when writing your programs; one good 
way to crash the system with a cryptic "stack 
overflow" is to pass a large value parameter to 
a procedure or function when there is insuffi- 
cient memory for the copy. 

Within the parameter list of a procedure or 
function, the only way to designate the type of a 
formal parameter is to use an identifier that 
names a declared data type; no explicit array de- 
scriptors, subranges, or enumerations are al- 
lowed in a formal parameter list. This is prob- 
ably the most important reason for placing the 
description of the Town matrix in the type sec- 
tion. It is also a good reason to avoid declaring 
any structures explicitly in the var section, since 
you might eventually want to use them as pa- 



rameters, and cannot, unless they are associ- 
ated with named types. By taking the time to 
generalize your data declarations in this way 
from the very start, you provide the largest 
number of options for yourself when the time 
comes to change the program. 

Rules of the Road. There are two good 
rules to follow when developing programs 
using the "evolutionary" method: 

1 . Don't walk away from a dead program. 
In other words, never postpone working on a 
program that will not compile and execute in its 
current form; keep working until you have 
something that the compiler likes, the execu- 
tion behavior of which you can observe. When 
you return to the program later, observing its 
execution will help you to remember what's go- 
ing on inside, and will better prepare you for 
"surgery." Note that the skeleton of Cable, as it 
now stands, will compile and execute, although 
execution will not produce exciting results. 

2. Write the most "visible" code first. Com- 
plete first those parts of the program that will 
produce the most significant (and gratifying) re- 
sults. There is just something about watching 
programs execute that gives programmers the 
inspiration and energy to develop them even 
further. It's a kind of snowball effect; the better 
a program runs, the more time and effort one 
wants to invest in it. Getting visible results ear- 
ly will help you stick with the project until the 
entire program is complete. A corollary to the 
latter rule is, "develop and verify gross pro- 
gram structure before turning to details." For 
instance, we should write the main program 
body before proceeding to the routines that em- 
body the separate commands. 

Here is Cable's main body; note that it is 
very similar to that of TestCom, the test pro- 
gram in which we nestled the NewCommand 
function in August. Use it to replace the corre- 
sponding stub at the end of Cable's skeleton. 

BEGIN (* Cable *) 
WriteLn(Output, Header); 
WriteLn(Output); 
NewTown (Smallville); 
UserQuits : = False; 
REPEAT 

CASE CableCommand OF

ChangeTown(Smallville); 
Display: 

DisplayTown(Smallville); 
Quit: 

UserQuits : = True; 
END (* CASE CCom *); 
UNTIL UserQuits; 
END (* Cable *) . 

In order for this part of the program to 
compile correctly, we must declare UserQuits as 
Boolean in the global var area, but this is the 
only change to the rest of the program text that 
needs to be made. 

Suppose we wanted to postpone working on 
Cable at this point. 

Since the program will compile and exe- 
cute, we would be justified in taking a break. Of 
course, the execution of this skeletal version re- 
sults in nothing more rousing than a couple of 
"not yet implemented" messages (one apiece for 
NewTown and CableCommand). We haven't

The prompt chosen for CableCommand 
should be familiar; it was deliberately designed 
to mimic the style of the Apple Pascal operating 
system. By aping the operating system, we have 
not chosen the optimum prompting scheme, but 
it should work well for people who are used to 
working with Apple Pascal. At the very least, it 



indicates that a response is required, and sug- 
gests possible responses. In the future, we may 
see fit to rewrite CableCommand to be more 
friendly, but right now, we're more interested in 
seeing the entire program work. 

The sharp-eyed reader will see that Cable- 
Command relies on Capital, our standard func- 
tion for letter-capitalization. This means that 
the code for Capital must also become part of 
the Cable program. But where should we put it? 
We could nest it within CableCommand itself, 
thus placing it precisely where it is needed, but 
since we've seen that Capital is such a useful, al- 
most ubiquitous function, we're probably bet- 
ter off making it global, so that other routines 
may call it if necessary. I would place Capital 
between the end of the global var section and 
NewTown's procedure heading. In other words, 
I would make Capital the first procedure de- 
clared in Cable, thus ensuring that every rou- 
tine in the program can "see" Capital, and 
therefore call it. 

What's in Store. Next month's column will 
begin with a complete listing of Cable, in its 
present state. From there, we'll proceed to de- 
velop NewTown, Display Town, and (if space 
permits) ChangeTown. In the process, we 
should learn some interesting facts about the P- 
machine, more about arrays and matrices, and 
begin the study of string variables and record 
structures. Does that sound like a hearty 
Thanksgiving feast? No? Well, why not drop by 
anyway; this turkey would appreciate having 
you over to share some food for thought. HI

Word Processing: 



Word Handler Goes 
to tlie Movies 




BY JUHAIHAn niLLtk 



Life, Thomas La Mance once observed, is what happens to us while 
we're making other plans. George Catanzano, Jr., would agree. Back in 
the mid-fifties when Catanzano was making plans, the script in his life 
picture show seemed all but written. He'd gone straight from high school 
usetts, to being a medic in Uncle Sam's army and 



now, honorably discharged, he was heading straight for the rolling com 
carpet of Iowa and Palmer College, fount of United States chiropractic 
instruction. 

On the surface, the plan seemed something of a bold stroke. Not on- 
d still suspect in the eyes of many in the

medical fraternity, he was shipping out to Grant Wood country, to the 
vastness of the great American heartland. Why, for all this geographi- 
cally untutored Yankee knew, Indians still roamed the fruited Iowa 
plain. And yet, on closer examination, the move, even the profession, 
made perfect sense — fit neatly into the unfolding scenario. Or so it 
seemed. 

All the Home's a Stage. "I can still remember, from when I was 
twelve or thirteen, my dad calling my twin brother and me into the 
kitchen, closing the door, and saying, 'Hey, guys, I have these heart 
problons and I want you to take care of mom if anything happens.' " 
How many family crises, it seems, play out in the hard glare of cheery 
kitchens with ominous news exploding like a dropped plate. The elder 
Catanzano, near as anyone could determine, had already suffered some- 
thing like eight or nine heart attacks. The doctors shook their considered 
heads and said the elder Catanzano didn't stand much chance of surviv- 
ing the year. But of course he did. 

That chance was chiropractic, the specialty Catanzano's father 
turned to in desperation. Not only did it relieve his severe angina pains, it 
helped extend his life seventeen years. And, by dint of favorable exam- 
ple, the experience fixed a career ambition in the mind of his earnest son. 

"I became interested in chiropractic because of what it had done for 
my dad," says Catanzano, now forty-six. "I felt I owed it something." 

Today, Catanzano sees that period from a different perspective. He 
sees a kid who went directly from high school to the army and bang into 
college, to cram four academic years into three by attending Palmer year- 
round. He sees a kid so in a hurry to get some place that he hadn't taken 
time to ask where he was going. He hadn't, that is, until the end of his 
sophomore year when he realized he was exhausted. George Catanzano 
needed a break, some time to himself, so he took the summer off. He lux- 
uriated in the freedom and then, true to a tortured twentieth-century 
soul, felt dutifully guilty about enjoying it. 

"Well, it was a mistake," he says today, laughing. "It was a mistake 
because I had a good time and decided to take another semester off. 
Then I wasn't sure whether chiropractic was what I wanted to do." 

Into the Dream Palace. So while Catanzano considered alternative 
life plans — the big picture, as it were — he decided he might as well work. 
Almost any job would do. Then, as luck or the fates would have it, a 
chance encounter occurred with a fellow PaLmerite who was working the 
summer as an assistant manager at a Davenport, Iowa, movie theater. 
The theater needed a fall replacement and, well, one thing led to a new 
career. It was just to be a temporary job, you understand, something to 
do while Catanzano sorted life's scenarios — those scripted for and by 
him over the past twenty years. But it worked out differently. 

"I just got into the business," says Catanzano, now assistant film 
buyer and booker for Central States Theatre Corporation, "and fell in 
love with it." 

That, as they say in Hollywood, was twenty-three years ago, twenty- 
three years of managing bijous in places like Davenport and Burlingame 
and then, in recent years, of playing the high-stakes game of theatrical 
bookings. Catanzano had gone from relieving pains through spinal 
manipulations to the even trickier maneuver of tickUng funny bones, and 
wiser adult heads shook their hoary manes, much like the doctors with 
his father, and said, "George, you better look for a full-time job, be- 
cause this industry is going downhill." 

CRT Still the Enemy. Back in the pre-Wasteland fifties, you'll re- 
call, the experts were predicting that television would empty theaters 
across the land. Today the mavens of the media are prophesizing death 
by video games, video tapes, and that creeping economic subversive, "the 
ever- in creasing competition for the entertainment dollar." The subtext 
was clear movies were high-risk enterprises, made even riskier by the 
Byzantine economics of movie distribution. Catanzano might as well be 
shooting craps in the dark. Perhaps, but therein lay its appeal. To book 
films and call 'em right was to be there on the cutting edge, to be where 
the myths are made. 

"A generally good rule of thumb in the motion picture industry," 
says Catanzano cheerfully, "is out of every ten pictures made, seven lose 
money, two break even and one makes money." 

These are not great odds, but they're probably no worse than those 
faced by Iowa farmers every planting season. The odds could be better, 



to be sure, but every now and then you get a surprise that makes it all 
worthwhile — financially as well as emotionally. Like E.T., the film that 
has humbled industry forecasters everywhere: made for $10 million, 
bringing in upward of $200 million, 10 percent of which will be shared by 
theater operators. That's the kind of action that keeps you riveted to the 
big screen — keeps you riveted and then, by competitive turns, leads you 
to its home-size miniature, to the friendly monitor of an Apple 1 1 Plus, to 
word processing, and, yes, to a whole new way of looking at life. 

Scene II. We observe our protagonist one crisp fall day in 1977 lug- 
ging a video recorder back to the Computer Emporium in his adopted 
home of Des Moines. He bought the thing to keep up on the competi- 
tion, but he's not impressed with the quality or the experience. He's figur- 
ing to pocket the refund when his wandering eye catches a smiling Apple 
in yonder corner. There, animating its screen, is an intergalactic strategy 
game based on Star Trek, and Catanzano is enthralled. Absolutely. 

For the first year or so, he is lost in monitor space, but a subplot is 
stirring. Catanzano, like his father and his father's father and his twin 
brother, has had a heart attack since last observed. It has shaken him up 
and reordered his life and led him back to the Roman Catholic Church. 
He is becoming more involved in his local parish and looking for ways 
to help. 

"That heart attack changed my life dramatically," he says, trying to 
explain. "From a moralistic standpoint, tremendously. Prior to that, the 
primary objective of my life was to be a big businessman, to be the 'suc- 
cessful' businessman to own a camper, two cars, a nice home — the keq> 
up-with-the Joneses syndrome. Those things are unimportant now. I 
think the best way to describe it now is that I value friendships rather 
than objects. I can honestly say I care about pjeople, where before it was a 
question of using people. That's a tough thing to tell about myself, but 
it's a fact." 

Came the Calling. He v/as looking for ways to use his Apple to 
lighten the church's workload when who should intervene as a comput- 
er angel but the pope himself. 

In response to the invitation of a local farmer. Pope John Paul II in- 
cluded Des Moines on his American itinerary in October 1979. Catan- 
zano volunteered his services and was told he had six weeks to coordi- 
nate press credentials and Secret Service clearances for eleven hundred 
reporters. The bishop's residence became the gathering place for fifteen 
Apples, including Catanzano's — the electronic nerve center for a com- 
munications and logistical network that greatly impressed the pontiffs 
party. Computers amidst the corn — it became something of an organi- 
zational mind blower. 

Parishes throughout the diocese began to see the labor-saving bene- 
fits of word processing — of mailing lists, label reproduction, quantity 
correspondence, not to mention general accounting work. And Catan- 
zano recognized an opportunity to provide a free service, which would 
give birth to a commercial enterprise destined to generate a quarter mil- 
lion dollars in sales last year. Only to get there, he first had to check out 
word processors for his Apple. 

In the course of three-plus years, says Catanzano, he has demon- 
strated nearly every word processing program written for the Apple, not 
counting CP/M products. None comes close to Word Handler from Sili- 
con Valley Systems. And one can readily see why, from his standpoint. It 
gets a movie exhibitor where he lives. Visually, viscerally. "That's one of 
the great things about Word Handler," says Catanzano, echoing Silicon 
Valley's ad copy. "What you see [on the sixty-six character screen] is 
what you get on your printout. And that's the other beautiful thing 
about the program. It's all up there on the screen with the software." 

Neatness Counts. What also scores at the box office with a movie ex- 
hibitor is packaging, and Silicon Valley has advanced the art of docu- 
mentation. Instead of an oversized, intimidating loose-leaf with pages in 
wild disarray, we observe a small, tidy binder that's easy to look at and to 
read. "When you open it up, it doesn't give you a lot of verbiage to try to 
sell you on how to use the product," adds Catanzano. "It tells you plain- 
ly and simply how to use it." 

Using it is made exceptionally easy, he says, by the simple logic of the 
control key strokes in the editing, insertion, and print modes. "If you 
want to do something with a line, you hit control-L. If you want to do 
something with a word it's control-W; bold, control-B; copy something, 



74 



OCTOBER 1982 



control-C; format, control-F; and so on. It's just so simple." 

Simple and yet sophisticated. Other program functions include a cap 
lock (permitting continuous typing in upper case), superscripting, verti- 
cal line spacing, variable line justification (allowing ragged and justified 
type within the document), searching in both forward and backward di- 
rections, and fold-sheet printing (a feature ideal for newsletters, a major 
Catanzano service). There's even a very useful function, overlooked by 
the documentation, that allows the typist to move the cursor from para- 
graph to paragraph (control-M). 

Boldface Turnaround. The only problem that Catanzano's encoun- 
tered, in fact, has been a certain incompatibility between Word Handler 
and his particular printer. He's had trouble generating a boldface print- 
out on his IDS Prism Printer. 

"Usually, when you call a software manufacturer," observes Catan- 
zano, "you find that they're expecting a problem and they're ready to 
defend themselves; but these people at Silicon Valley are so nice, it's un- 
believable. Every time I've had an occasion to call them, they've been 
very cooperative." 

And so, it might be added, have the fates. The more Catanzano be- 
came involved with word processing for church groups, the more he 
recognized the need for secular spin-offs — a commercial extension of 
word processing services to local organizations and an even more ambi- 
tious project. About two years ago, he and his identical twin Jerry 
formed CATCO (for Catanzano Company). A diversified operation, it 
wholesales IDS printers, merchandises peripherals, offers consulting 
services, and designs custom software packages, drawing on the exper- 
tise of two resident programmers. A couple of research and develop- 
ment projects in progress: an interactive Bible storybook patterned after 
Dungeons and Dragons and a sophisticated program enabling a would-be 
Des Moines area dating service to mix and match as many as ten thou- 
sand lonely hearts. 

Zing Went the Strings. In the process, Catanzano more than 
covered his initial $15,000 investment in hardware and software and 
gained a working knowledge of programming. But the big payoff, to 
hear him tell it, is emotional. He's simply doing good works and feeling 
better for it. 

"There's a self-satisfaction but it isn't in the programming as such," 
he says, recalling work on a direct-mail solicitation for a local church 
group. "It was in accomplishing a goal with the program, in helping 
people." 

It's people, says Catanzano, that connect his two worlds — the mov- 
ies and computers. Both offer escapes from the tedium of life; both 
promise a greater congeniality and communication among their cele- 
brants. Des Moines, after all, belongs to the Bible Belt, and Catanzano 
never loses sight of that cardinal fact of Midwest hfe. 

"In addition to being in the film business, we're also involved in the 
community where we operate," he says. "We consider ourselves good 
citizens. We feel a responsibility to bring quality motion pictures of all 
types to the community." 

That is the cinematic goal, but it is often frustrated by the products of 
Hollywood and the penchants of the movie-going public — even in Des 
Moines. 

"The most severe limitation that we have is what Hollywood pro- 
duces," says Catanzano. "There are things that we'd bke to see made. I'd 
personally hke to see the production of more family-oriented films. 
However, the film companies don't produce a lot of those films because, 
generally speaking, they don't make money. The things that sell in mo- 
tion pictures primarily are, very frankly, sex and violence." Of the films 
made last year, 63 percent were rated R, Catanzano points out, which 
doesn't leave a whole lot left for G and PG rated products. For many 
producers, says Catanzano, a G rating is tantamount to the kiss of box 
office death with the prime movie-going audience in the sixteen to thirty- 
five year old age bracket. 

When Good Is Bad. "When people see a G rating, they tend to say, 
'Oh, that's a kiddie picture.' That's not true, but the producers will put in 
a swear word because they don't want the stigma of the G rating." 

Catanzano is not a protector of public morals, though. His job, as he 
and his employer see it, is to select a money-making package of films for 
the chain's eighty indoor and drive-in theaters in Iowa and Nebraska. 



That may sound simple enough when you know your market, but in the 
mad, mad world of movie exhibiting it's anything but. 

"It's a very strange and peculiar business to explain to somebody, be- 
cause a lot of what happens in this industry runs counter to what ap- 
pears to be good business sense." Take the case of blind bidding, a grow- 
ing industry practice in which movie exhibitors bid on films before 
they're in the can. 

"Would you buy a car from an auto dealer without test driving it?" 
he asks incredulously. "That's exactly how we feel about blind bids. In 
some cases we bid the picture before production has even started. That's 
when it becomes completely ridiculous." 

The Law of the Cinema Land. All of which raises the question, why 
do movie exhibitors put up with it? According to Catanzano, they 
haven't much choice unless they operate in those few states that have de- 
clared the practice illegal, Iowa and Nebraska not being among them. 
There's a limited supply of films, essentially a single distribution source — 
namely Hollywood — and an increasing tendency industrywide to rely on 
up-front guarantees from exhibitors to secure financing for big-budget 
movies or prime playing dates during the peak Christmas and summer- 
time release periods. 

"The competition among distributors fosters blind bidding, particu- 
larly on play dates," Catanzano contends. "They don't want the other 
guy to get the jump on them." 

Even without blind bidding, a movie exhibitor wagers at less-than- 
favorable odds. 

"If Universal is selling E.T. and the film deal is ninety-ten with a 
seventy floor," says Catanzano, segueing into industry lingo, "then it's 
ninety-ten with a seventy floor for every single exhibitor in the country. 
Let's say we have a theater with an overhead of $3,000 and we gross 
$20,000. We subtract the overhead from the gross, leaving a balance of 
$17,000. Then we'd pay the distributor 90 percent of $17,000, or 70 per- 
cent of $20,000, whatever is greater." 

A Piece of the Nut. On a blockbuster movie like E. T., such arrange- 
ments can prove mighty attractive, but oftentimes an exhibitor is literally 
working for peanuts. "In some cases, if you're talking profit, conces- 
sions account for 100 percent of it," says Catanzano. "Distributors don't 
get a percentage of the concessions and they never will, because they'll ef- 
fectively put every exhibitor in the industry out of the business." 

Catanzano and Central States Theatre Corporation may occasional- 
ly lapse into wistful thinking about the good old days twenty years ago 
when the distributor/ exhibitor split was more like 75/25, but they're evi- 
dently doing enough business to keep them in the game. 

"If I had all the answers on what the public would buy," says Catan- 
zano, "I'd be out in Hollywood making films and making a hundred mil- 
lion dollars. It's very difficult from a practical standpoint to pick out the 
successful films. I guess those of us who do it as a profession tend to 
guess right more often than wrong, which is why we're still in the 
business." 

The larger question, of course, is what the nature of that business will 
be in five or ten years or even if there'll be a business. Television didn't 
kill the movies, but what about video games, video tape, and cable, not 
to mention the short-run effects of a lingering recession that has already 
cut box office receipts, particularly at drive-ins? Catanzano seems more 
concerned than worried. He just doesn't think the old tube can compete 
with the theater experience, with big screens, big sound, and the synergy 
of group emotion. 

"How much can you enjoy a comedy in front of a television screen as 
opposed to in a theater?" he asks. "Laughter is contagious. All the emo- 
tions are." 

The Bigger, the Better. When television reared its head in the fifties, 
Hollywood answered with wide screens, stereophonic sound, reserved 
seating — the really big show. Given the current challenge, Catanzano ex- 
pects they'll answer with more of the same. In fact, producer/director 
George Englund (The Ugly American) has already previewed a possible 
prototype in Las Vegas and at the World's Fair in Tennessee — a wrap- 
around cinematic technique called Imax that evokes comparison with the 
Cinerama of yore. Catanzano foresees a number of technological break- 
throughs keeping the competitive dogs at bay: theaters receiving pictures 
via satellite transmission, doing away with costly prints, and advances in

3-D and holography making viewers literally feel a part of the film. 

"It's really difficult to explain to people what good 3-D really is; they 
think of the arrow being thrown out in Bwana Devil, and that detracted 
from the story being told. I think in the future there'll be a better mar- 
riage between story and effect." 

A case not in point, says Catanzano, is Tron, the Disney paean to 
computer graphics that bombed at the box office (and on Wall Street) 
this past summer. 

"The computer graphics in Tron are absolutely out of this world," 
says an admiring Catanzano; "however, the story is very weak." All of 
which underscores a Catanzano box office maxim: People today go to 
see films, not to the movies. Movie-going is not the habit it was back in 
the Depression, when you could "slip an occasional stiff by the audi- 
ence." Today's more discerning moviegoer, says Catanzano, demands a 
good product; stars can enhance a film, but they can't save a turkey. 



Fickle Finger of Fate. Separating the winners from the turkeys is the 
hard part, for there's no sure-fire way of accounting for the public's fickle 
tastes. Quality alone is no guarantee of box office whammy. If you're a 
veteran movie exhibitor like Catanzano, you're resigned to that. Expec- 
tations about films, like plans about life, don't always turn out as you fig- 
ured, so all you can do is try to think positively. And you savor the 
screen gems you called right, like E.T., whose grosses exceeded your 
wildest estimates, and Chariots of Fire, which you had the prescience to 
book into a long run to build word of mouth. 

"In some way, those good films are really our kind of contribution," 
says Catanzano. "It feels good to be associated with something that is 
upbeat and has good Christian and Jewish values. 

"I hope E. T. goes on to be the number one film of all time, because 
that will mean the top two films in the history of the industry will be Star 
Wars and E.T. — classic cases of good triumphing over evil." m 



Olivieri's Outline 

of 

Word Processors 



by Peter Olivieri 



What equipment makes up a good word processing system? Gener- 
ally, word processing systems come in two forms. The first is the stand- 
alone word processor. Designed specifically for word processing, this sys- 
tem usually has a video monitor, two eight-inch floppy disk drives, and a 
printer attached to it. Word processing systems like this are truly a dream 
to use. The keyboard is well-designed, with special keys labeled on the 
front with the name of a specific word processing task (center a line, de- 
lete a word, delete a sentence, or whatever). Some of the major manu- 
facturers of these "dedicated" word processors include Digital Equip- 
ment Corporation, Wang, and IBM. These systems are relatively 
expensive. 

The second type of word processing system you might encounter is a 
software package for use on a microcomputer. The equipment configu- 
ration used will vary, although the most common situation is one in 
which the system includes two disk drives and a printer. 

There are, as you can see, some common denominators between 
dedicated word processing systems and word processing programs that 
run on microcomputers. 

You'll need to have a monitor on which to view your document as 
you type it. There are all types of monitors. Some come with tinted 
screens and some give you the capability to display a full page of text 
exactly as it might look on a piece of paper. 

It's nice if you can see your material displayed in both upper and low- 
er case letters. Some word processing software packages require that you 
add a special board to your Apple to accomplish this, while others han- 
dle this problem with the software itself 

You'll need at least one disk drive. Clearly, having two increases 
processing speed and allows you to store more documents. The advan- 
tages of a hard disk system are obvious. 

The printer is a key element in the system, since your documents 
must eventually exist in hard copy form. To many people, the quality of 
the print is the most important factor in their selection of a printer. 



Typewriters That Think. When the term "letter quality" is applied 
to a printer, it's a way of saying that the output from that printer is of a 
quality consistent with what could be produced using a high-grade type- 
writer. Letter quality printers are expensive, ranging in price from $1,500 
to more than $3,000. A decision about the kind of printer that will meet 
your needs is a decision only you can make. Some businesses simply will 
not tolerate documents or letters that look as though they were "printed 
by computer." Others are more forgiving. 

Of course, all word processing systems are computer-based systems. 
It is the computer that gives systems the capability to move words 
around and to perform many of their fancy feats. 

Using a word processing system on a microcomputer is almost as 
easy as typing. Essentially, all you do is place the disk containing your 
word processing program into the drive and start it up. You then b^in 
creating your document. As you type each character, you see it appear 
on the video screen. During this process, there are a variety of com- 
mands you can issue to control what takes place. You can delete charac- 
ters, words, or entire sentences; move text from one spot to another; 
capitalize it; underline it; or justify it. 

At any point you choose, you can save what you have been working 
on and then recall it later when you're ready to modify or add to it. 
When you're satisfied with your document, you select a print option, is- 
sue instructions as to how your document should be printed covering 
such'things as margin settings, line spacing, number of copies, and page 
numbering, and then press a button. Your document will now print, and 
the result will be just what you specified. 

What Features Should You Consider? The features you want in a 
word processing system are precisely that — the features >'ou want! These 
will vary from user to user and from application to application. For ex- 
ample, you may want a system that allows you to take data that is stored 
in your VisiCalc file and insert it into a document you're creating on the 
word processor. On the other hand, you may be more interested in hav-

ing a system that takes customer names and addresses, merges them into 
letters, prints originals, and prepares mailing labels. 

To help you decide what features you want in your word processing 
system, scan through the glossary in this month's column and make a 
note of those items you feel are essential ingredients of a word processing 
system you might want to own. The features defined there are among the 
major ones you'll find, to varying degrees, in some of the word process- 
ing packages currently on the market. In our profiles of the various pack- 
ages later on, we'll indicate which features each includes. You can then 
compare your list with the attributes of various word processing systems 
and identify which systems possess the characteristics important to you. 

There are a few other factors you might wish to consider when con- 
templating the purchase of a word processing program. One is the sys- 
tem documentation. How good is it? If the manuals that support that 
system are poorly written, it's very likely that you'll experience nothing 
but frustration when trying to use it. (In a way, it seems odd that a word 
processing manual might be poorly written. Oh well.) 

Menus, Please. Does the system provide clear and complete menus 
that list the options available to you? Well-thought-out, menu-driven 
programs can be a lifesaver to both the experienced and the inexperi- 
enced user. 

Word processing programs often call for you to use specially desig- 
nated keys (or combinations of keys) to perform various tasks. If a pro- 
gram has a lot of different commands or command sequences to memo- 
rize, it becomes more complicated to use. Perhaps some of the vendors of 
word processing systems will begin releasing sticky labels that you can at- 
tach to the appropriate keys to indicate the word processing functions 
they serve. It would certainly be easier to remember, for example, that 
control-D means "delete a line" if the key had an appropriate remov- 
able label. 

Another factor worth considering is whether you'll be using continu- 
ous form paper, single-sheet paper, or both. You must decide this by the 
time you are ready to purchase your printer since-not all printers have the 
capability of providing both options. Some printers are friction feed on- 
ly; others are only sprocket fed. And some have a sp»ecial single-sheet 
feeder you can use to feed single sheets continuously into the printer. The 
important thing is: Know your printing needs and know your printer. 

At this p»oint, you should have a pretty clear idea of what a word 
processing system can do. In addition, you should be somewhat more fa- 
miliar with the special features that might be part of such a system. Take 
some time to think about what the hardware requirements of your sys- 
tem are and about what word processing features are most important to 
you. During the next few months, we'll try to match your needs with 
what is currently available. 

Word Processing System Features 

Automatic paging: This provides for the automatic numbering of all 
pages, either at the top or the bottom of the page. Also, it's usually pos- 
sible to suppress the numbering of pages if you like. 
Centering: This results in the automatic centering of a word or a group 
of words. It's very useful when you're preparing headings. 
Cut and paste: This capability is called by many names. What this op- 
tion does is allow you to move a block of text from one spot in your 
document to another. If you've ever finished a document and then 
wished, upon rereading it, that a particular paragraph were somewhere 
else, this feature is for you. 

Directory: Most systems have a facility for displaying a directory of all 
the documents currently on your disk. The directory might provide such 
information as the length of each document, the date it was created, the 
date it was last accessed, its name, and perhaps a brief description of its 
contents. 

Displaying a page: This feature lets you see what a page in the docu- 
ment you're creating looks like. That way, if you have, say, a situation in 
which a single word at the end of a paragraph appears at the top of a 
page, you have the opportunity to alter your document as necessary for 
better appearance. 

Document insertion: It's often useful to be able to insert one document 
(or a portion of a document) into another. This allows you to store text 



you use often and then to place it anywhere you wish in a new document 
without retyping. 

Headers and footers: This capability allows you to place items at the top 
or bottom of a page. Chapter titles, the word "confidential," and page 
headings are all examples of headings. Footers might be page numbers, 
the company logo, footnotes, or even a special marketing message. 
List processing: With a list processing option, it's possible to merge a list 
of data (usually names and addresses) with a document (usually a letter). 
The list processing task may also allow you to perform more sophisti- 
cated processing tasks. Some list processors allow you to specify a set of 
conditions for selecting which records from your list are to be merged 
with your letter. You could, for example, select only those records that 
had a state entry equivalent to CA and a personal income figure greater 
than $25,000. 

Mathematics: Some word processing packages will actually perform 
some mathematics for you. For example, you may be creating a table 
that contains several columns of numbers and you may wish to have the 
"totals" become part of the final table. If your word processor has a 
math capability, this can be accomplished easily. If it's Likely that your 
applications will require lots of calculations or mathematical processing, 
a system with a math capability is worth serious consideration. 
Print control: How much control you have over what is printed de- 
pends in part on the word processing system you have and in part on the 
type of printer you own. Some capabilities worth thinking about are (1) 
underlining of words or phrases; (2) boldface printing (achieving a dark- 
er image by typing over a word a second time; (3) overprinting (for creat- 
ing special characters, such as the not-equal sign); (4) page layouts (these 
include control over such things as the number of lines on a page, the size 
of the top and bottom margins, the spacing between lines, and the verti- 
cal spacing used); and (5) printing multiple copies. 
Right justiflcation: This refers to the fact that the right-hand margin is 
not "ragged" as is usually the case when a document is typed. When you 
use a word processing system that has the capability to right-justify, the 
right-hand margin will align perfectly, the way it does in this article. 
Scrolling: This feature allows you to move through your document. By 
pressing a particular key, you can advance by word, by line, by para- 
graph, or even by page. Some systems also allow you to move quickly to 
the beginning or end of a document. 

Search: When used alone, the search feature moves the cursor to the 
point in the document at which the word or phrase you're searching for 
first occurs. You can begin typing or inserting at that point, or you can 
move on to the next occurrence of the word or phrase. 
Search and replace: This feature allows you to search for particular let- 
ters, words, or phrases and replace them with other letters, words, or 
phrases. For example, you could change every occurrence of the word 
"color" to the word "colour" by means of a single command. Or sup- 
pose you were writing a document that frequently used the word "hexa- 
decimal." Rather than type this word each time, you could type a #sign 
in its place and then use search and replace to replace all occurrences of 
the number symbol with the word "hexadecimal." Used in this way, 
search and replace can save a lot of typing time and may also cut down 
on typing errors. 

Spelling checker: If you're a terrible speller, you may want to have an 
option that allows the computer to check your spelling. Some systems 
come with a 50,000 word vocabulary. There are even systems that allow 
you to enter special spellings of words that might be unique to your par- 
ticular business or profession. 

Subscripts and superscripts: Subscripts are numbers that are printed 
slightly below a letter or word (most often as part of a mathematical 
formula such as Xj + X2 = 36). Superscripts are printed slightly above a 
word and are most often used for identifying footnotes. If you have fre- 
quent need of either of these features in your writing, be sure the word 
processing system you select includes them. 

Word wrap: This term refers to the fact that as you are typing and you 
reach the end of a line on your screen, the words "wrap" automatically 
around onto the next line; you don't have to press the return key. With 
word wrap, you no longer have to worry about accidentally entering the 
space that should be reserved for the right margin, typing "off the page," 
or splitting a word in half. IM

OCTOBER 1982 




BV JOE SHELTOn 



Last month we set up a VisiCalc template to allow consolidations of 
data using both DIF files and normal VisiCalc files. We saw that the real 
key to doing consolidations is preparation in setting up the original tem- 
plate. Once that has been done, the rest is easy. This month we'll examine 
some ideas to keep in mind when designing templates, and we'll also de- 
sign a template that may help you in your day-to-day life. In addition, 
we're starting a semiregular section for discussing and finding solutions 
to problems that might come up while you're completing a template. 

Template Design. No matter how often you've done it, designing a 
new template can be a complicated task. It seems that once you decide 
on a method that permits easy template design, you find a new problem. 
And, invariably, once you've completed a template, you realize that you 
could have designed it in a different way that would make it (choose one 
or all): more compact/more logical/faster. 

Recognizing that each template will be different, let's consider some 
things to think about when designing a new template. There's no set pro- 
cedure for template design, so don't expect the answer here. Instead, look 
for hints and a clearer understanding. It helps if you look objectively at 
the template we're going to design. Don't look at what we are trying to 
accomplish; focus instead on how we are accomplishing it within the con- 
straints of VisiCalc. 

Today's economy being what it is, it seems logical to look at how 
VisiCalc might help you make ends meet. After all, as the saying goes, 
"Once you think you're about to make ends meet, somebody moves the 
ends!" Let's see if we can design a useful budgeting model. 

If you purchased Apple III VisiCalc, you received a VisiCalc Sam- 
pler disk that includes a Personal Budget template. You might want to 
look at or use that template; the one we design here will be similar. 

First Things First. The first thing to decide in designing any tem- 
plate is whether your objective is really within the capabilities of your 
Apple and VisiCalc. If you had hopes of putting General Motors's ac- 
counting system on your Apple, you're better off taking up kite flying. Be 
reasonable in your requirements and VisiCalc can help. (You could do a 
corporate analysis of General Motors's finances, for example.) 

What's the next step? Decide what you are trying to accomplish, the 
component parts, and how you would solve your problem if you were to 
do it on paper. Think about our budget. From an operational stand- 
point, a budget is simply a cash flow analysis. A budget has two compo- 
nent parts: cash in and cash out. The bottom line is the comparison of 
these two values. 

Next, list all the possible income (cash in) and expenses (cash out) 
you want to include. Remember to include occasional expenses (for 
example, car insurance) as well as to allocate money for clothes, enter- 
tainment, and so on. Look at housing, food, insurance, transporta- 
tion — in short, everything you spend money on. You'll probably also 
want to include an entry for savings. 

The next thing to do, before even turning your computer on, is to sit 
down with pencil and paper and sketch the basic layout of what you 
want to see in your printed result. It is infinitely easier to change your 
layout before you start the VisiCalc template than it is to make changes 
after it's completed. This becomes especially important if you plan on 
doing date conversions, having look-up tables, having antiforward refer- 
encing tables, and so on. 

Once you have the basic idea of what you want to see, think about 



what's going to be required to achieve it. If your model is mostly values 
that will be summed, or columns or rows that will be added or sub- 
tracted, you won't have to worry about special considerations. But if you 
plan to do complicated computations (like date conversions with look-up 
tables), you should understand what will happen to your model if you 
have to expand it. If, for example, you have to insert a row or column 
that splits a look-up table, you lose the complete look-up function until 
you recombine the table. You also have to think about where to place 
look-up tables or groups of formulas that solve specific problems to 
minimize the number of recalculations necessary to finding the final 
solution. 

The Overall Design. You can, of course, lay out the template in any 
manner you want. What we'll demonstrate here is just one method. 
There are probably going to be some similarities in most budgets. First 
you'll want to list and total your income and expenses in separate areas. 
It's beneficial to set up different expense categories with subtotals to help 
clarify where the majority of your expenses are. You'll also want to lay 
out the template in some periodic manner. 

We're going to set up our template by months. If cash is tight, set it 
up by weeks. Which periodic format you decide on has no real effect on 
our template except that you need twelve monthly columns or fifty-two 
weekly columns for each year. You could even do individual periods in 
separate models for more precise analysis. 

As you design and complete templates, two things will quickly be- 
come obvious. First, you rarely know or remember in the beginning 
everything you will include in the template eventually. Second, the size of 
the template and number of calculations always turns out to be larger 
than you planned. Your design must take these two factors into account. 

Now boot VisiCalc and let's get to it! 

Income First. Since your budget (and cash flow) would be pretty lop- 
sided without cash coming in, we'll start with income. If you are part of a 
two or more income family, you'll want to list each of the incomes and 
then total them. This is a cash flow analysis, so enter take-home (net) pay 
rather than gross pay. See figure 1 for a sample income section. T.I. is an 
abbreviation for Total Income. 

Now let's look at an example of planning template design to allow 
for additions (this works for expenses too). The formula in C5 could be 
either -I-C2-I-C3 or @SUM(C2...C3). We use the ©SUM function rather 
than adding the individual incomes to allow for future expansion. 

Suppose you take another job. Your additional income should be add- 
ed to the Total Income. Then, rather than changing the formulas (fifty- 
two in all if you are doing weeks), you'll be able to insert a row between 
Income 1 and Income 2 and enter your new income. Your new income 
will automatically be added to the Total Income. 

Want a better way to accomplish additions? In your ©SUM expres- 
sion,' enter the cell containing the dashes below your last value (for

will malce existing software compatible with 
the 80-coiumn VIDEX VIDEOTERM. 

APPLE WRITER ][ 

pre-boot with 80-Column Display 

This program allows an SO-column display for your APPLE 
WRITER ][, and access to true upper and lower case input 
fronn the keyboard. When combined with the ENHANCER ][. 
this program will provide a complete word processing 
package. 

Interested in word processing in different languages? The pre- 
boot program has been set up to allow APPLE WRITER ][ to 
prompt in other languages. With 
an Enhancer ][, the keyboard 
can be programmed to be 
compatible with different 
languages.

VisiCalc" 

pre-boot with 80-Column Display 

Now you can view the VisiCalc electronic worksheet window in 
80 columns. Since the entry line is also 80 columns wide, 
complex formulas can now be seen in their entirety for editing 
ease. An added bonus is the ability to display upper and lower 
case $49.00 

Suggested retail price 

for those who need even more power, a more advanced ver- 
sion combines all the above features with the ability to use 
many of the memory expansion boards currently available. A 
configuration editor allows VisiCalc to use a mixture of dif- 
ferent kinds of memory expansion cards. Just tell it what 
memory cards you have and which slots they are in. For exam- 
ple, you could use more than one language card equivalent. The 
memory cards can be combined 
to give you access up to 
T76 K of memory!

VisiCalc was a swell Idea 

for then. 



The next generation. First generation electronic 
worksheets were a good idea. They were early software 
nnanagement tools that could eliminate a lot of hours 
with a spreadsheet, calculator, pencil and eraser Enter 
Multiplan, the next generation electronic worksheet 
that's as easy to use as it is useful. 
Make comparisons. Compare Multiplan to any of 
the earlier electronic worksheets. We've given you some 
"prompts" above. 

Compare learning time. Multiplan's tutorial book brings 
you up to speed. Fast. But Multiplan doesn't stop there. 
Multiplan's On-line Reference Guide gives you instant 
help if you have questions. It knows where you are in 
Multiplan and offers information related to your problem, 
right on the screen. 

Compare ease of use. All Multiplan prompts are 
full length words or phrases. And Multiplan provides 
"naming," the ability to assign a plain English name to any

of VisiCalc on the Apple II and IBM-PC respectively 



cell or area. "Gross Profit = Sales— Cost" rather than 
"AA44=AZ23— BK154." Which means you can work 
more intuitively. And faster. 

Compare utility. Multiplan lets you link related work- 
sheets so that information is transferred between them 
automatically. For instance, you can keep regional sates 
forecasts on separate sheets but link them with your overall 
company forecast. Then, just change the forecast for 
any region, and the company forecast sheet is updated 
automatically. Something you can't do with first generation 
worksheets. 

Compare reports. Not just the work you can do, but the 

way you can present it. Multiplan's flexible formatting 
options allow you to produce presentation-quality reports. 
And its sorting capability lets you sort by either alpha- 
betic or numeric order. So a sales manager who normally 
lists sales regions alphabetically could sort by amount 
sold and conveniently rank by sales performance. The 







MuHiplanis 

for 



result is a more meaningful and useful presentation of data. 
Compare availability. With Multiplan, you're not 
limited to a single range of computers. Multiplan is avail- 
able for Apple® and for microcomputers that run 
MS™-DOS, XENIX™ or CP/M-80® operating systems. 
Multiplan supports both 40- and 80- columns on the 
Apple II. 

Compare the source. Microsoft was the world's first 
nriicrocomputer software company. Today, Microsoft 
software is running in well over a million installations, 
worldwide. Languages. Utilities. Business programs. All, 
maintained at the state-of-the-art. 
Compare for yourself. Drop into your computer store. 
Compare Multiplan's powerful, user-oriented features 
to any electronic worksheet on the market. If you've 
been using VisiCalc, Multiplan's ability to directly utilize 
your VisiCalc files lets you easily upgrade to Multiplan. 
And that's just another of the many features designed 



a great idea 
now. 

to make Multiplan the electronic worksheet for 
now. And years from now.

Use the same format to complete the expenses sections. We show a 
number of different expense categories in figure 2. You can enter as 
many specific expenses under each category as you want to and then sum 
each category.

Didn't think there would be so many? You should see the rest of 

the list! 

Below the final expense category, enter TOTAL INCOME and be- 
low that TOTAL EXPENSES. Enter the cell reference for the sum from 
the Total Income cell above. In the TOTAL EXPENSES section, enter 
the cell references for the category totals for each of the expenses (for 
example, -I-C9+C14+C21 and so on). Below these, enter Total Cash 
Available (TTL CASH AVAIL) and enter the cell references for TO- 
TAL INCOME minus TOTAL EXPENSES in that cell (+C55-+C56). 
See figure 3. 

Replicating the formulas in each of the cells in column C across the 
template (using relative reference) gives you a basic budget template. En- 
ter income and expense amounts in the appropriate cells and see the re- 
sults. If you don't like the results, change some of the values and see what 
your new budget looks like. Remember "what if? Now you have a per- 
fect example. 

Now What? The real world dictates that once you complete a tem- 
plate and find it workable, you'll want it to do something it doesn't. In 
the software development business, that paradox is called "creeping ele- 
gance." Let's look at a possible enhancement and how the design of our 
original template affects the way we implement our new feature. 

From a cash management point of view, we'd like to see how ex- 
penses relate to our income. You could look at the totals and get a per- 
spective, but corporations look at ratios and so can we. The idea is to 
compare each expense against total income. If take-home pay is $1,000 
and rent is $500, then the rent expense is 50 percent of total income. 

Some expenses, such as house payments, are constant and are not a 
variable part of the "what if?" scenario. Others, such as recreation, are 
highly subject to adjustment. 

Look at the model we've constructed and decide which expense cate- 
gories it would be logical to analyze. Consider two things. First, do you 
want to do this analysis monthly? Second, do you want to show these 
percentages with the rest of the budget, or in a separate analysis section? 

For the sake of simplicity, we'll put the analyses below the expense 
category totals. You may have to insert rows under each expense cate-

gory total. If we had decided to put the analyses beside or under individ- 
ual expenses, the model would have to be restructured by inserting addi- 
tional rows or columns. 

Suppose we had a look-up table in an area where an inserted row or 
column would affect it? The look-up table would have to be reentered. 
The fact that planning is an important part of template design is becom- 
ing more and more obvious. 

Move to the expense total for the first expense category. Divide the 
Total Expenses for that category into the Total Income for the period. 
Do the same for the remaining categories and you have an analysis tool 
that will help you in planning your budget. 

A Look at Problem Solving. This is the first installment in a semi- 
regular miniseries on solutions to problems you might encounter while 
designing templates. Its focus will usually be on using different functions 
and features in combination to solve normal design problems. 

Let's start out with something prompted by a letter from a reader. 
The reader, a teacher, wanted a way to enter fifteen grades for each stu- 
dent and then to have VisiCalc automatically average the grades and as- 
sign a semester grade. The grade breaks are A = 90 'o 100, B = 80 to 89, 
C = 70 to 79, D = 60 to 69, and F = 59 or less. We'll simplify matters by 
using VisiCalc'% @INT function to determine the integer value of the 
average. 

Sound easy? It is, but before reading any further why not try solving 
the problem yourself and then compare your solution with the one given 
here? Incidentally, there are a number of methods for accomplishing this, 
so if you find the solution easy, try to figure out a second solution. To 
add another wrinkle, grades number 5, 10, and 15 count twice. In other 
words, they are for the midterm exams and count as two tests each. 
Hint — this gives a total of eighteen grades! 

The Student's Bane. The first thing we must do is enter student 
grades. (In our example, we'll enter grades for just one student.) Enter 1 
in cell A3. In A4 enter 1+A3 and replicate that, with relative reference, 
into A5...A17. This will indicate the fifteen individual grades and we will

use it later. We are going to enter the grades vertically, but we could just 
as easily enter them horizontally. Next, enter random grades, between 1 
and 100, into B3 through 817. See figure 4 for an example. 

The next step is to compute the average grade for each student. You 
could use the ©AVERAGE function, but does that really find our aver- 
age? In this case, no — because we should count three of the grades as 
being worth two grades each. You could enter grades number 5, 10, and 
15 twice and use the average function. But let's get tricky. Enter Average 
in A19 and the following expression in B19: 

@INT(@SUM(B3...B17) + @LOOKUP(5,A3...A17) + @LOOKUP 
{10,A3...A17) + @LOOKUP(15,A3...A17)/18) 

If this expression looks confusing, you could make it easier to under- 
stand by entering each component into a different cell, summing the 
components, and then dividing by 18 in a final cell. If you're thinking 
about model design, you'll want to do your computations in a separate

area of the model and then reference the answer into B19. 

The ©SUM part of the expression sums each of the grades. Each of 
the ©LOOKUP functions finds the look-up values for grades 5, 10, and 
1 5 in column A and returns the value next to them in column B. They are 
added to the sum. Grades 5, 10, and 15 have now been included twice 
in the sum. The @INT function simply returns the integer portion of 
the total. 

The expression computed a 90 point average for our example above. 
Had we used the ©AVERAGE function on 83.. .817, the average would 
have been 89 — the difference between an A and a 8 grade! 

One major advantage of this method is that grades 5, 10, and 15 are 
automatically summed twice. We have minimized the user's entries. 

The next step is to determine the final grade. A look-up table is one 
easy method of accomplishing this. In addition, by using it we get to dis- 
cover a little more about how to use ©LOOKUP. 

When designing a template, you'll usually want to place the look-up 
table away from the working part of the model. Enter the look-up table 
as shown in figure 5.

Figure 5. 



You'll notice that the values in column A define the beginning and 
ending values for each grade. The look-up function searches column A 
until it finds a value larger than the look-up value. It returns the value in 
column B next to the value equal to or smaller than the look-up value. 
Column B substitutes 4 for the A grade, 3 for B, and so on. 

Now that we've completed the look-up table, let's compute a grade. 
In A20 enter Grade and in 820 enter @LOOKUP(19,H13...H22). That is 
your final grade. The final model should look like figure 6. 

A Final Note. Those of you who share the feeling that VisiCalc is a 
powerful tool that anyone can use will be interested to learn that a jun- 
ior college in the San Francisco, California, area offers a class entitled 
"Introduction to VisaCalc [sic], the 'Electronic Spreadsheet.' " We won't 
hold the misspelling against them; and isn't it interesting to see VisiCalc 
taught in the schools? New class members sometimes feel that the course 
should be listed under foreign languages! JM

Mind Your 




BY PETER OLIVIERI 




In many states, the arrival of the fall season is marked by special ac- 
tivities. Football games and tailgate parties have begun, and there's just a 
hint of the holidays on the horizon. For us this month, it's Mind Your 
Business as usual. We have two business user profiles, some Business 
User Group comments, and a product review. 

Trying Before Buying. In July, we talked about how nice it would be 
if people who were considering the purchase of a software package could 
try it out ahead of time. This would allow consumers to experiment with 
several different programs and ultimately to choose the one that best 
suited their needs. 

Now here's a variation on that idea. Marvin J. Plateis, a certified 
public accountant from Schenectady, New York, is half owner (with Dr. 
Marvin Englebardt, a dentist) of the Computer Assisted Self Help Cen- 
ter. The center has three Apples on which customers can rent time to do 
their computing chores. 

Since the company doesn't sell software or hardware, customers can't 
try out an existing package before purchase. What they can do, how- 
ever, is try out an Apple, and they can continue to use the Apple to de- 
velop applications that range from keeping financial or income tax rec- 
ords to improving their skill at blackjack. According to Plateis, a local 
restaurant owner uses the Apple in doing his payroll calculations and one 
of the contractors in the area is preparing job cost estimates with the aid 
of the microcomputer. 

Customers pay eight dollars per hour for time on the machine. This 
doesn't seem prohibitively expensive, although it certainly could add up 
if you're a slow typist (aren't most of us?). The hourly rate includes a

printed copy of the work you've been doing. If you're storing data, you 
can supply your own floppy disk or purchase one at the center for five 
dollars. 

Users who encounter problems can get help; the center has hired stu- 
dents in the computer science program at the State University of New 
York at Albany as computer consultants. This can, indeed, save begin- 
ners a good deal of time. Center hours are 1:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Mon- 
day through Friday; 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on Saturdays. 

The chance for a prospective Apple owner to get some hands-on ex- 
perience before actually purchasing a system is perhaps the most val- 
uable opportunity the center provides. For a very nominal cost (even if 
you were to spend several hours), it's possible to determine whether you 
can successfully operate a microcomputer, what some of the capabilities 
of such a machine are, what applications might be useful to you, and 
what equipment you'd need to meet your own special computing needs. 

The next logical step for the center would be to maintain a library of 
software packages customers could try out before purchasing a particu- 
lar one. Wouldn't it be great to be able to try out three or four word 
processing systems for twenty-five dollars before making that fmal 
purchase? 

Apples Can Be Catching. It all started when Bob Singer, an ad sales- 
man for two McGraw-Hill trade publications {Electrical Construction 
and Maintenance and Electrical Wholesaling), decided to invest in an Ap- 
ple. His idea was that a microcomputer would make it easier to keep 
track of more than five hundred clients. Indeed, that certainly proved to 
be the case. 

At present. Singer uses his Apple for a variety of tasks and applica- 
tions. He maintains an up-to-date mailing list, creates promotional pieces 
using a word processor, prepares and prints letters, publishes his own 
monthly newsletter to keep clients informed about new products and 
services, prints out mailing labels, prepares reports for the sales man- 
ager, and prepares sales forecasts. 

When they learned of the success Bob Singer was experiencing, mem- 
bers of the research division at McGraw-Hill decided that they, too, had 
uses for a microcomputer. In fact, according to research division direc- 
tor Gordon Ross, five people in the group now have Apples of their own 
at home. At the office, the fourteen members of the research division 
staff use two Apple lis and an Apple III in their work. In addition, the 
sales, promotion, editorial, and finance departments have developed a 
variety of applications that take advantage of the Apples' capabilities. 

Before the research division had Apples, staff members who needed 
computer services went through a costly and time-consuming interac- 
tion with a computer professional who had to translate their requests in- 
to language the computer could understand. They were glad to discover 
that in the world of personal computing, you can make use of the com- 
puter without knowing how to program since, in most cases, you can use 
an existing package to accomplish the application you have in mind. 

Applications in the Research Division. The Apple that gets the most 
use in the research division is a 64K machine with two disk drives. It has 
an eighty-column card that's used primarily in word processing applica- 
tions and a Z-80 card for CP/M applicafions. Within the division, many 
of the applications center on performing extensive market research. 

Word processing was one of the first applications the Apple was used 
for. The research division developed numerous questionnaires on a regu- 
lar basis, and these often had to be redone five or six times when they 
were typed up by hand. A word processing program speeded up the 
process a lot. 

Easy Writer Professional was the first word processing program the 
division got. They found that it was not an easy program to learn to use.

Four applications in one. 

The Incredible Jack combines the 
convenience of a personal filer with the 
power of a calc package. It handles 
most word processing tasks with ease. 
Toss in the ability to sort and print 
mailing labels, and you have a totally 
integrated, suprisingly easy to use 
package that does most of what you 
bought your Apple for 

Organi2e information your way. 

The Incredible Jack lets you arrange 
your information in "records" you design 
yourself using the computer display. 
Each record may be as little as a mailing 
label or as large as 60 sheets of legal 
sized paper 

Word processing made easy. 

With a few simple commands you can 



master in minutes, you can create 
letters, memos and reports. To help 
you edit. Jack lets you insert, delete, 
and copy portions of text all with 
automatic word wrap and flush right 
margins. The Jack does away with the 
mind boggling control codes and 
formatting options of other word 
processing packages. 

Automatic decision making. 

Jack even allows you to build decison 
making logic into your file. With 
English language rules and a powerful 
IF THEN ELSE function, you can 
instantly calculate complex discount 
tables, commission plans, contract 
terms, or tax rates. 

See for yourself.

especially for beginners, although they discovered that the learning went 
along much more rapidly once they had an understanding of the basic 
concepts and mastered the fundamental vocabulary. 

Mailing lists constituted another important application area, since 
the company communicated with three reader research panels on a fair- 
ly constant basis. 

A database package was used for keeping track of budget records. 
With it, weekly budget reports could be printed up. These reports gave 
summaries of expenses on projects that might have had bills from fifteen 
different suppliers over a three or four month period. 

We all make "to do" lists, but not all of us create and store them on 
the Apple. The research division used Apple Project Manager as a way of 
reminding themselves about tasks that needed to be done. The package 
was originally designed to keep track of the progress of construction 
projects, but it was used in the research division to produce a calendar of 
events for each step of a project from start to finish. The project in this 
case was a large-scale mail survey. Since the calendar was circulated 
every two weeks to all who were involved in the project, everyone was 
aware if the schedule slipped or got ahead of the calendar. Relationships 
among people working together on the project improved considerably. 

The division had not intended to use the Apple for tabulating the re- 
sults of surveys. But since they had both VisiCalc and The Data Factory, 
it was inevitable that these tools would be put to use, particularly on 
some of the smaller jobs. VisiCalc is also used in estimating the cost of a 
survey. Indeed, once those involved became familiar with all the options 
available in VisiCalc, they were able to use it in estimating survey return 
rates, tabulation costs, and production costs. 

Having used the Apple for approximately a year on a part-time basis, 
members of the research division feel that they are just beginning to real- 
ize the potential benefits it makes available to them. They anticipate that 
there is, indeed, much more learning to be done. 

Business User Group. A reminder to you BUGs out there to send in 
your comments on printers and word processing packages as requested 
last time. Also, if you want to be an "official" member, please send your 



name and address, along with a little bit about your interests and skills. If 
we get enough response, perhaps we can create a directory. 

One of our business users helps other business users. Paula Ozols is 
from Prairie Microsystems (Eden Prairie, Minnesota). Her company spe- 
cializes in software development and computer services. Lately, the firm 
has been busy installing Apple lis and Apple Ills in the Twin Cities. 

Oddly enough, however, they have found some businesses that have 
had Apples for as long as six months to a year but are not using them to 
any extent. 

This seems surprising at first, although a moment's reflection sug- 
gests that the reason may have something to do with first-time users feel- 
ing intimidated when it comes to using the computer. There may, in fact, 
be a lot of Apples out there gathering dust . . . just waiting for an advo- 
cate in the company to awaken others to their potential. 

Ozols reports that the two areas in which her company has the most 
requests for training are VisiCalc and database management systems. 
Having worked extensively with DB Master, VisiFile, and PFS, Ozols 
generally recommends DB Master to all but the least sophisticated user. 
Because it is an extremely powerful piece of software, a fair amount of 
time and effort must be spent learning to use it. An especially nice fea- 
ture of the package is provided by the Utility Pak ^1. This feature allows 
you to use DB Master files with other programs.

plesoft in ROM, two disk drives, and a printer. The Invoice Factory is 
compatible with The Data Factory (a Micro Lab database management 
system), so it would be useful if you had that package available also, al- 
though The Invoice Factory does work as a standalone system. 

As the name implies. The Invoice Factory prepares invoices. The pro- 
gram can handle as many as 550 active accounts, although you may only 
have 275 active accounts in the system (on line) at one time. This is about 
equivalent to the contents of one floppy disk. If your business has more 
than 275 customers, they can be accommodated; you'll just have to pair 
certain disks when using some aspects of the system. 

The first step is to create some data. The information that can be re- 
corded about a client includes an account number; the customer's name, 
address, and phone number; a contact person; salesperson number; ship- 
ping address; sales tax code; the terms (for example, net 1 to 30); a credit 
limit; a method of shipment; and a comments field. 

Next, you're asked to enter information about shipping. Up to nine 
sales tax rates can be entered (these were identified by code earlier when 
accounts were set up). COD cost, handling cost, and UPS shipping data 
should then be entered. Of course, the UPS shipping information is auto- 
matically tied to the standard UPS shipping zones and the ZIP code in 
your own area. Finally, you can enter product, price, and weight infor- 
mation. The Invoice Factory can record data on up to one hundred 
products. 

At some point, it comes time to enter specific invoice data. Three dif- 
ferent types of invoices can be prepared. 

The standard invoice allows you to select any of the one hundred 
products you have entered, and up to six products can appear on one in- 
voice. The invoice you create is saved to disk for later printing. The auto 
invoice is used when you have several invoices that have the same prod- 
uct content but are for different customers. Those invoices can be sent to 
all the accounts in your master account file or to accounts you select. The 
third invoice, the freeform invoice, is very different from the other two. 
With this option, you can enter up to twelve products on an invoice; you 
enter product descriptions, prices, and so on, and the invoice is printed 
immediately after you finish. It is not saved to disk, so you can't per- 
form any of the sales analyses available in this package when you select 



the freeform option. 

Since we all make errors when entering data to these unforgiving ma- 
chines. The Invoice Factory includes a procedure for editing the data en- 
tered. You can then search for a particular invoice in a variety of ways 
(by account number, customer number, date, and so on). It's easy to 
look at other invoices while you're in the edit mode. 

Eventually, it will be time to print the invoices. Since they've been 
saved to disk, this can be accomplished rather easily. Some sample in- 
voice forms are standard forms on tractor-fed continuous sheets and are 
as attractive as most we've seen. You are then given some instructions on 
preparing your printer for the printing process. When these instructions 
have been followed, all of your invoices will print. 

After the invoices have been printed, you may wish to send out state- 
ments. Simple statement forms are also included with your purchase. 
While these statements don't have your company name and address on 
them, The Invoice Factory user manual has a listing of a program for the 
Epson printer that allows you to print your company information on the 
top part of the form. An order form that enables you to order your own 
forms directly from the manufacturer is also included. 

When payments start to come in, you can use The Invoice Factory to 
record them. The program accepts the appropriate information about a 
customer and then posts the receipts. This part of the package is very 
powerful. It allows you to identify each invoice, including overpay- 
ments, void invoices, underpayments, and so on, and a second option 
can be used to resolve overpayments. 

Finally, the package allows you to generate a dozen special reports. 
These reports are: 

1. accounts receivable by invoice number 

2. accounts receivable by due date 

3. aged receivables 

4. quarteriy/yearly analysis (shows the quarterly or monthly sales 
for each account) 

5. product list (all the variables for your one hundred products) 

6. shipping data information (that you entered earlier) 

7. customer list/mailing labels 

8. a sales analysis (you can analyze up to ten products at a time); one

While there can be a good deal of disk swapping with this system, it is 
quite easy to get accustomed to and to use. As usual, Micro Lab has in- 
cluded backup copies of all the program disks. You can also get replace- 
ment disks at nominal cost. 

The user manual is clearly written. It would have been preferable if 
the manual had included screen images (or representations) of various 
menus. Even though the manual is meant to be used in conjunction with 
the program, it would have been more useful if these screen images had 
been included. 

John Stalnaker of Sarasota, Florida, writes to warn prospective 
Apple 111 users not to assume that all software written for the Apple II 
will work on the Apple III. Although the Apple III comes with an emu- 
lator program on disk that allows the computer to think it is an Apple II, 
this does not guarantee that software will work on both machines. 

Stalnaker found that The Home Accountant from Continental Soft- 
ware, described in an earlier column, does not work in the emulation 
mode on the III. Continental, a company that is most responsive to cus- 
tomer questions, does not imply that The Home Accountant will run on 
the Apple III, since it was designed for the Apple II Plus. The point Stal- 
naker wants to make is that the purchaser of Apple II software for the 
Apple III must be aware of whether or not that particular package works 
on the III. He has found that, in general, local sales people don't know 
the answer to this question. 

The Readers Speak. "I just wanted to let your business readers know 
that they should be serious about computer security. We recently set up a 
microcomputer lab with ten Apples. Since the lab was in a main office 
building, very little thought was given to the possibility of someone walk- 
ing off with a machine. 

"Well, no one walked off with a machine. However, we have "lost" 
two of our VisiCalc disks, one DOS 3.3 disk controller card, two sets of 
paddles, and several blank disks. We now have a system to prevent this, 
but it was a bit too late for us. Perhaps our experience will prevent the 
same from happening to someone else." — At a Loss, Cambridge, 
Massachusetts. 

We agree with you that business users tend to be less serious about 
the question of security when it comes to microcomputers. We recom- 
mend that the machine itself be permanently attached to a desk or table 
(this includes the disk drives and the monitor). It's particularly impor- 
tant to be sure that the cover of the Apple can't be removed easily (would 
someone really remove a chip?). 

Software should be kept in a central location and issued by one per- 
son. Users should sign software out when they need it. This is a minor in- 
convenience, but it ensures that the package will be available when they 
need it. Of course, backup copies of software should also be kept in a se- 
cure place. There are even situations in which it wouldn't hurt to restrict 
access to the computer itself. 

While we're on the subject of security, let's talk about an aspect of 
this issue that is often overlooked. As you know, a programmer (or com- 
petent computer person) is capable of causing your computer system to 
do some strange things. Sometimes these things are funny; other times 
they're not so funny. 

So if you have a programmer working on a system for you, it's im- 
portant that you recognize the control this person has over your system. 
Build in safety checks, particularly for financial systems. Have an inde- 
pendent auditor check your system occasionally, and don't take your sys-

SEARCHING FOR RECORDS 
CAN BE A REAL HASSLE. 






IT'S 



It always seems 
to happen at the 
wrong time. A file 
cabinet or two 

filled with records that are not 
quite in alphabetical order. In 
there somewhere is the right 
record, but there's just no way 
to find it without leafing through the whole mess. 
Sound familiar? 

With DB MASTER finding the right record takes 
about three seconds. You just call up the name, say 
"Mark Piper," or invoice number "38965," and there 
it is in front of you. No worries. No misfiling. 
No anxiety. Think what it means for a business where 
you constantly need to check product inventories or 
customer billing status. 

But what if you don't know the whole name or the 
exact number you're after? No problem. DB 
MASTER'S "Search" method makes it simple to find 
what you're after. For example, you can call up all the 
"Pipers" and stop when you recognize the right one. 
And there's more. You don't even have to know the 
name at all. If all you really know is that it begins 
with a "P", for instance, you can use DB MASTER'S 
"Wild Card" feature. It'll give you every name in your 
file that begins with "P". The same goes for a range 
of numbers. Punch in the range of digits you know, 
and you'll get a series to choose from. Try that with 
your filing-cabinet system. 

We designed DB MASTER to make your life easier. 
Sure, there are other data base systems available for 



MASTER 
EASY. 



|TM your Apple II. But, 
if you're not using 
DB MASTER 
you're simply 
not getting all you could from 
your data base manager. 

Want more capability? DB 
MASTER provides it with the 
expanded-capacity Special Edition for Hard Disk to 
complement the popular floppy diskette version. 
And there are three powerful accessory programs. 
UTILITY PAK #1, for example, allows you to access 
other standard Apple files (including VisiCalc), and 
even change the way you've structured your files. 
UTILITY PAK #2 allows you to edit or change up to 
five "fields" in a single pass through your files. And 
STAT PAK performs statistical analyses on data in 
your DB MASTER files. Of course, there's 
considerably more capability in each of our accessory 
paks than we have room to talk about here. Ask your 
dealer for the full details. 

Stoneware backs up DB MASTER with a support 
staff second to none. Just give us a call. We can help

THE ANIMATED APPLE 



With GraForth 

Part 2 



BV PAUL LUTUS AND PHIL TUOHPSOU 



Last month, we intrcxluced GraForth and discussed a number of its 
special language and graphics features. We also promised to show how 
to create animations using character graphics. Before we start, let's take a 
look at some of the more advanced conditional and looping commands 
available in GraForth. 

The branching and looping capabihties of GraForth are much more 
varied than those of Basic. There is only one branching command found 
in Basic that GraForth does not have a parallel to: goto. However, Gra- 
Forth has a number of constructs not found in Basic that not only make 
the goto unnecessary, but increase a program's readability as well. 

The simplest is the if-then construct, which is similar to Basic's. In 
either language, a test is made, and if the test evaluates as true, the code 
following the test is executed. The format for GraForth's if-then is 
somewhat different, though A test is done before the word if, leaving a 



number on the stack. If the number is nonzero (meaning true), the words 
between the if and then are executed. If the number is zero (false), then 
the words are skipped and execution continues after the then. Here is an 
example of if— then, along with a similar statement in Basic 

GraForth: X 5 = IF 

L 1 + ^ L 
THEN 

, Applesoft: 40 IF X = 5 THEN L=L+1 

The first extension to Basic-like capabilities comes with if— else— then. 
This works like if— then, except that if the test is true, the words between 
the if and else are executed; otherwise the words between else and then 
are executed. This allows for a simple choice between two options and 
clearly defines the program statements for each. 



98 



OCTOBER 1982 



GraForth: X 5 = IF 

L 1 + - >L 
ELSE 

L 1 - - >L 
THEN 

Applesoft: 40 IF X = 5 THEN L = L+1 : GOTO 60 
50 L = L-1 
60 .... 



Last month we discussed do-loops (similar to Basic's for-next 
loops). GraForth provides two looping constructs to simplify program- 
ming when the number of repetitions is not known ahead of time. The 
first of these is begin— until. In a program, the words between the begin 
and until are executed, then until removes a value from the stack (placed 
there by the previous words). If the number is zero (false), execution 
loops back to the words following the begin. This loop continues until 
the top stack value is nonzero (true) when the until is executed. 

GraForth: BEGIN 

L 1 + - >L 
X L * - >X 
X 1000 > 
UNTIL 
Applesoft: 40 L = L+1 
50X = X*L 

60 IF X< = 1000 THEN 40 



Another looping construct, begin— while— repeat, allows the test to 
occur before a group of words are executed. Control is first given to the 
words between begin and while. While removes a number from the stack. 
If the number is nonzero, the words between the while and repeat are ex- 
ecuted, then the loop repeats back to the begin. If the number is zero, 
then the program hops past the repeat and continues from there. (It's 
easiest to remember that the second group of words are executed while 
the test is true.) 

GraForth: BEGIN 

X L * - >X 

X 1000 < = 
WHILE 

L 1 + -> L 

M L + - > M 
REPEAT 
Applesoft: 40 X=X*L 

50 IF X>1 000 THEN 90 
60 L = L+1 
70 M = M + L 
80 GOTO 40 
90 .... 



The last test construct, similar to Basic's on— gosub, is case.— then. 
Here, a number of separate words appear between the case: and then. 
The word case removes a number from the stack to select and execute 
one of the words. A zero selects the first word, a one selects the next, and 
so on. The program continues following the word then. Each word in the 
list can, of course, be a complicated routine itself, calling many other 
words. 

GraForth: CASE: 

COLOR. IT 
DRAW.IT 
UNDRAW.IT 
THEN 

Applesoft: 40 ON X GOSUB 100, 150, 200 

As we discuss various aspects of animation in future columns, we'll 
be using these branching and looping words quite a bit. In introducing 
character graphics animation, however, we're going to rely on the good 
ol' do-loop construction. 

In the GraForth demonstration program {Graphics of the Second 
Kind), you can see an animation of a small man walking across the 



screen. The man (actually the collection of images making up the man) is 
called Maxwell and originated from Apple Computer. Maxwell is an 
example of character graphics. We'll discuss the basics of animation with 
character graphics and present a short program showing how to make 
Maxwell walk across the screen. 

When GraForth first boots up, it loads its standard character set, 
which is simply a table containing the shapes of all of the printable char- 
acters. Whenever a character is to be printed on the graphics screen, Gra- 
Forth looks up the shape of the character in the character set and draws 
the character at the appropriate position on the screen. The GraF orth 
disk contains a number of character sets, with different shapes for each 
character. These shapes can be either various lettering styles, other sym- 
bols or images, or parts of larger images which are printed as a rectangu- 
lar block of characters. 

Maxwell is an example of this last type of character shape. The char- 
acter set Chr.Maxwell contains three separate pictures of Maxwell, 
showing three phases of a single walking step. Each picture, or block, is 
two characters wide by three tall, using six characters in the character set. 
Each individual character makes up one-sixth of the block. 

The GraForth manual discusses how to create character shapes and 
plot individual character blocks on the screen. The plotting process can 
be broken into a few simple steps; (1) Load and select the desired char- 
acter set, (2) set the size of the block to be printed with blksize, (3) posi- 
tion the cursor with htab and vtab, and (4) print the desired block by call- 
ing putblk. 

Animation with character graphics, as in cartoons, is created simply 
by rapidly displaying a number of still images one after another, creating 
the illusion of smooth motion. This is precisely what happens when Max- 
well walks across the screen. The three character blocks are repeatedly 
displayed in order and moved to the left across the screen. 

Before we do any programming, let's have a look at what we're 
about to animate. Start by loading the GraForth character editor into 
memory: 

READ " CHAREDITOR " 

The disk will whir as the character editor is read and compiled into mem- 
ory. Since the program does not automatically clear the screen (a feature 
we'll find very useful in future columns), do so now and run the charac- 
ter editor program: 

HOME RUN 

Get (G) the character set named Chr.Maxwell and type D for Dis- 
play. At the bottom of the screen (in inverse) you will see many standard 
characters and a number of different shapes that are the images that 
make up our Maxwell character. The shapes have been redefined to look 
like a walking man, rather than alphanumeric characters. 

Type B and select a Block size of two characters wide by three tall. 
Now type R, then the number 64, to Read the two-by-three character 
block that begins with character number 64. The first of the three Max- 
well images will appear in the upper left corner of the screen. 

Now read from character number 70, then firom number 76. This will 
display the other two positions of Maxwell. Note that each of them 
shows him in different stages of walking, moving from right to left with- 
in the character block. Read each of the three images in turn back to the 
screen again, one right after another. You have just performed a simple 
animation: Maxwell has taken a step. (That's one small step for Max- 
well, one giant leap. . . .) A GraForth program that shows Maxwell tak- 
ing one step (not very exciting yet) would simply display each of the 
three images in turn. 

The next step is to convince Maxwell to walk all the way across the 
screen. That's not at all difficult to accomplish, but it does require a bit of 
planning. As Maxwell took his one step, note that his upper body moved 
smoothly from right to left, neariy an entire character width. If we start 
the three-part animation over again, one character position to the left, his 
upper body will continue its smooth leftward motion as his l^s main- 
tain their stride. 

There is one more thing to consider When we showed Maxwell tak- 
ing only one step in the character editor, each character block was clean- 
ly drawn over the top of the last one, completely erasing it. But if we start

At the rate we're going, 
we'll have these pages 
filled by 2083. And by 
2084, people will be 
clamoring for the next 
Infocom creation. 

We hate to disappoint our 
public. So we keep you waiting. 
Because while the software facto- 
ries are cranking out arcade game 
after arcade game, pulpy adven- 
ture after trite fantasy, we're 
writing and rewriting, honing and 
perfecting. Before a single person 
enters one of Infocom's worlds, 
it must be crafted into a living, 
riveting, definitive experience. 



WE CAN! 

Judging from the public's reac- 
tion, it's worth the wait. For 
instance. Creative Computing 
welcomed DEADLINE™ as 
"thoroughly engrossing and real- 
istic," while a Softalk readers' 
poll recently voted ZORK™ I and 
ZORK II the most popular adven- 
tures of 1981. 

And now, for the moment, your 
wait is over. ZORK III, your final 



step in the underground 
trilogy, and STARCROSS;" 
an exploration of a new 
dimension in science fiction, 
are ready for you. 

Look at them up there, 
the little worlds of Irfocom. \s 
our universe expands, compan-

OCTOBER 1982 



shifting the blocks one position to the left, then the right side of the pre- 
vious two-character wide block will stUl be visible after the new block is 
drawn. It's up to us to erase it. Fortunately, GraForth has a command to 
do that. It's called unblk. 

Let's write an actual program to animate Maxwell. We'll build it in 
four steps, using separate word definitions for each step. You can type 
the entire program into the editor, compile it, and watch it run; or you 
can enter each word definition one at a time and see how each word 
builds on the last. If you choose the latter, we do have one suggestion, 
which is best demonstrated: Type Q to Quit the character editor, then 
type: 

2816 CHRADR 

Location 28 1 6 is the default address used by the character editor, and 
thus is the current address of the Maxwell character set, still in memory. 
Chradr selects this as the character set to use when doing character 
graphics or displaying text. The prompt. Ready, will appear as a combi- 
nation of letters and pieces of Maxwell. You can see that the Maxwell 
character set was never intended for normal text display! Recover the 
normal characters by typing either chrset, chradr, or abort (cheaters can 
press the reset key). 

The moral of the story is this: After using character graphics, re- 
member to return to the system character set if you want things to make 
sense. Enter the following short word definitions: 

: IN ERASE 2816 CHRADR 0 VTAB ; 
: OUT CHRSET CHRADR 15 VTAB ; 

In clears the screen, sets the character set (in this case, the one at 
memory location 2816), and moves the cursor to the top of the screen. 
Out puts us back into the system character set, and moves the cursor 
down so that the graphics won't be overwritten by text. In and Out can 
be helpful when used before and after any immediate mode character 
graphics work. 

If you didn't follow us through the character editor example, you'll 



need to load the character set into memory and select the block size be- 
fore continuing 

CR 132 PUTC PRINT " BLOAD CHR.MAXWELL,A2816 " CR 
2 3 BLKSIZE 

Now, on to the example itself. GraForth is fast enough to draw many 
large character blocks on the screen quickly, so with a single small block 
like this, a delay loop is needed each time the block is drawn. Without it, 
Maxwell would skitter across the screen like a paper doll in a hurricane. 
The animation starts with the following word defmition: 

: ONE. FRAME 
PUTBLK 

1000 0 DO LOOP ; 

The word one.frame removes a number from the stack, which is used by 
putblk to select and draw the appropriate character block; then it waits 
for a moment. (A loop to 1000 in GraForth takes about a tenth of a sec- 
ond.) To see one.frame work by itself, you can type: 

IN 64 ONE.FRAME OUT 

This selects our Maxwell character set and draws the first of the Max- 
well images. It then returns us to the normal set and stops. One.frame 
can be called once for each of the three blocks that make up one walking 
step: 

: ONE. STEP 
64 ONE.FRAME 
70 ONE.FRAME 
76 ONE.FRAME ; 

If you want to see this much in action, type: 
IN ONE.STEP OUT 

Here's another way to do one.step. This version simply uses a loop to 
do the same sequence:

of a Maxwell remains on the left side of the screen. In most animation 
applications, you will want to erase this leftover image. Let's clean it up 
with one more unblk and combine the entire animation in a single word 
definition: 



Next is the word definition that runs the show 
: WALK 

- 1 37 DO ( Start a loop to move left across the screen ) 

2 3 BLKSIZE ( Set the 2 by 3 block for Maxwell ) 

I HTAB ( Tab to the position set by the loop ) 

ONE. STEP ( Have Maxwell take one step ) 

1 3 BLKSIZE { Set the block size to erase half of the block ) 

I 1 + HTAB ( Tab to the right half of the block ) 

UNBLK ( Erase it ) 

-1 +LOOP ; ( Loop back and repeat ) 

The walking sequence is in a loop, counting backwards from 37 to 0. 
(RemembCT that GraForth do— loops stop one short of the final value.) 
This loop provides the horizontal positioning as Maxwell walks from 
right to left. Inside the loop, we first set the block size. The loop value is 
recalled and used by htab to position the block, then one.step is called 
and Maxwell takes one step. 

Now we have to erase the current block before the next block ap- 
pears one space to the left. Actually, the next block will overwrite the left 
half of the current one, so we only need to erase the right half of the 
block. That makes a block one character wide by three tall, and we set 
the block size accordingly with blksize. We then position one more space 
over by htabing to the loop value plus 1, and call unblk to erase it. 

The loop repeats and Maxwell takes one step after another. Anima- 
tion! The sequence is started by typing: 

IN WALK OUT 

One last complication appears at the end of the walk: The last image 
drawn is partially erased with the unblk at the end of the loop, and half 



: MAX.WALK

WALK

OUT ; 

The animation shown here is fairly simple, but the same basic con- 
cepts can be used for designing much more complicated character 
graphics, with more movement and more shapes. Insoft recently re- 
leased two new Apple games. Spider Raid and Zargs. Both of them are 
written in GraForth and use animated character graphics extensively. 
Here is a quick overview for producing any sort of animated character 
graphics: 

Animation is simply a series of still pictures rapidly displayed one af- 
ter another. Each still picture, or block, should be planned with regards 
to its relationship to previous or subsequent pictures. Choose the block 
size(s), and design the shapes with the character editor, storing them in- 
to one or more character sets. To display the animation, simply draw 
each block in turn, with a short delay created by either a time-wasting 
loop, or graphics being drawn elsewhere on the screen. If the picture 
doesn't move about on the screen, each block can simply be drawn over 
the top of the previous one. If movement is required, then all or part of 
the block will have to be erased before moving. For maximum speed, 
erase only what will not be drawn over. 

Next month, we'll describe more advanced character graphics and in- 
troduce the use of color and different character sizes. We'll conclude with 
greater detail on how GraForth manipulates characters on the screen, 
giving you the tools to create complex animations with character graph- 
ics. Remember, if you have any suggestions for this column, send them 
to Softalk. Hi

of an Applesoft program is to use the list com- 
mand. This may be the best way of doing things 
for some people simply because it is the only 
way they have available. But producing hard 
copy this way does have its drawbacks. 

One problem centers on the commands you 
may need to use to initialize your printer. 
Issuing a pr#l command isn't so difficult, but 
for some printers you also have to issue a spe- 
cial control code to get eighty columns. After 
all, eighty column format looks a lot better than 
forty columns, and you paid for that, right? 

Finally, for all your trouble, your copy still 
has glitches that make it difficult to read. Words 
and Basic commands are broken indiscrimi- 
nately, control over the margins is at best diffi- 
cult to achieve, and no breaks are provided for 
page perforations. There has to be a better way. 

Well, there is. The Applesoft program in 
listing 1, Basic Lister, will give you readable 
hard copy, ready for you to refer to or to bind 
neatly in a notebook. It provides page headings 
and numbers, automatic form feed (even if your 
printer doesn't have form feed) at page perfora- 
tions, and a handy line count at the end of the 
report. It also gives you the choice of page 
length (sixty-six lines is fairly standard for an 
eleven-inch page) and page width. 

As an added feature, if you end any line 
with *P (which must be in a rem statement to 
avoid a syntax error), Basic Lister will auto- 
matically put that line on the top of a new page. 
This feature is useful for isolating important 
subroutines. All Basic Lister needs is for the 
program to be on the disk in the form of a 
text file. 

"A what?" you ask, knowing that Basic pro- 
grams are not normally stored as text files. This 



is true, but a fairly simple method of conver- 
sion is available. All you have to do is open a 
text file on the disk and list our program to it. 
Adding the following lines to your program and 
typing run 32000 (assuming the program itself 
has no line numbers greater than 31999) will do 
the trick. 

32000 D$ = CHR$(4) 

32010 PRINT D$;"OPEN HOLD TEXT" 

32020 PRINT D$;"WRITE HOLD TEXT" 

32030 LIST 0,31999 

32040 PRINT "END" 

32050 PRINT D$;"CLOSE" 

So now you have the knowledge and the 
programming tools necessary to create a for- 
matted listing of your programs. Just follow 
these steps: 

1 . Load the Basic program you would like 
to list. 

2. Add the six lines starting at 32000. 

3. Type run 32000 

4. Run the Basic Lister 

5. Type delete Hold Text 

"Wait a minute," you exclaim. "You said 
this was going to be easy!" Well, there are two 
ways to make something like this easier, en- 
slave a friend, or let the computer do the work 
for you. We can't help you with the first 
method, but the second is right up our alley. 

You want to be able to load the Basic pro- 
gram (step 1) and to let the computer take care 
of steps 2 through 5. No problem! The tool for 
your purposes is the exec routine. 

An exec routine is simply a text file of a se- 
ries of entries that the Basic interpreter can deal 
with. It can be used to add lines to a program in 
memory, issue DOS commands (like load and 



run), issue Basic commands, respond to input 
requests from programs, and other neat things. 
Truly a useful type of file. But how do you 
create an exec routine? 

Admittedly, it is not easy to create one from 
the keyboard. Some word processors create 
text files, but we'll assume you don't have one 
of these and give you a program to do the trick. 

Actually, the routine we used to make the 
Basic program into a text file isn't too different 
in spirit from what we'll be doing here. Just add 
the lines in listing 2, Exec File Maker, to the 5a- 
sic Lister in listing 1, and save the whole thing. 
Then, instead of running it from the beginning, 
type run 1000. Lines 5 through 480 are not exe- 
cuted here, but are put into our exec routine 
along with the other necessary commands. 

There should now be on your disk a text file 
called Trans, and things will not be as simple as 
we said that they would be. To get your for- 
matted listing now, simply load the program 
and type execTrans. After a lot of disk activity, 
you will be asked for the program name and the 
date (this information is for the header) and the 
desired page length and width. From there on, 
the computer does all the work. 

You may find that you want to customize 
Basic Lister for your own purposes. For in- 
stance, you may wish to create standard values 
for page width and length if you use the same 
printer every time. You may want to make the 
listing double spaced, or add some new fea- 
tures to the end report. To make these and 
other modifications, you'll need to make the 
changes in Basic Lister and then re-create the 
text file Trans. Be sure you delete or roiame the 
original Trans first, as your new file may not 
overwrite all the original, which will cause prob- 
lems when you exec it. 

There are many possible ways of per- 
sonalizing Basic Lister. From the response re- 
ceived on July's BasiCalc, it's clear that many of 
you are very creative and capable program- 
mers, so, until next month, the ball is in your 
court.

byDougCarlston 



Last month we completed two of the four modules of a shape table 
utility that allows us to draw shapes on the high resolution screen; 
change their size, color, rotation and screen position; and then save them 
off to disk or tape if we want to save them. 

The third module is the one that displays our shape, in any position, 
size, or rotated position, and in any of the Applesoft colors. 

The first thing we want to do is retrieve our shape from the shape 
table and display it to the screen. To start off, let's just display it normal 
size (scale = 1 ), without any rotation (rot = 0), in the middle of the 
screen (X = 140 and Y = %). For color, let's use the ever-popular white 
(hcolor = 3). 

Rather than just plugging these numbers in with the appropriate 
commands, we are going to issue this series of instructions in two steps, 
using variables (so we can easily change them later): 



2030 GET C$ 
2050 IF C$ = 
2060 IF C$ = 



THEN MODE 
THEN MODE 



You can write this section without my help, right? Now, the trick is to 
pick two more commands that say change the value of the appropriate 
mode either by increasing it a set amount or decreasing it a set amount. 
The two arrow keys might be good for this, so let's set up a section to in- 
crease values with the right arrow and another section to decrease values 
with the left arrow. Then if an arrow key is pressed we can check this and 
jump to the right section: 

2090 IF ASC (C$)<>8 THEN 2200 
2200 IF ASC (G$)<>21 THEN 2300 



2000 SCL = 1:RT = 
2010 SCALE = SCL: 



0:X = 
ROT 



140: Y = 96:CLR = 3 
= RT: HCOLOR = CLR 



By jumping back to line 2010 later on in the program, with new 
values in the variables SCL, RT, or CLR, we shall be able to change the 
characteristics of the shape we draw to the screen. 

There is a little more set-up work to be done, as you may recall. We 
still have to tell the computer where in memory the shape table is located 
and poke that address into the shape table address pointer at 232 and 
233. Since the shape is located at 768, which is the same as $300 hex (3* 16 
squared), we need to poke the right two digits (in hex) into 232 and the 
rest of the digits into 233, thus: 

2005 POKE 232, 0: POKE 233, 3 

Now all we have to do is draw the thing: 

2020 DRAW 1 AT X, Y 

Next comes the fun part (the part you've been waiting for). We are 
going to add some lines to the program to permit us to change the size, 
rotational position, X or Y position, and color of the shape. 

First, we have to let users tell the Apple which of these five charac- 
teristics they wish to change. Let's do that by setting a variable (call it 
mode) equal to a value from 0 to 4, depending on which of the five 
characteristics is to be fiddled with. Users can enter preferences by typ- 
ing single keystrokes. Here is a suggested list (chosen because they should 
be fairly easy to remember): 



Keystroke 

S 
R 
X 
Y 
C 



Function To Change 

Scale 
Rotation 
Horizontal start 
Vertical start 
Color 



Mode Value 

0 
1 
2 
3 
4 



Then the only trick is to get a keystroke from the keyboard and check it 
against this list: 



The ASCII value of the left arrow is 8; the value of the right arrow is 
21. Attentive readers may remember the trick for discovering these 
values: temporarily add the following line to your program, and run it: 

1 GET A$: PRINT ASC (A$): GOTO 1

OCTOBER 1982 



Try typing the two arrow keys, then hit reset and delete line 1. 

We have blocked out the area from line 2100 to 2199 for dealing with 
what happens when the left arrow is pressed (line 2090 skips straight to 
2200 if the left arrow hasn't been pressed). Similarly, the area from 2200 
to 2299 has been set aside for dealing with the consequences of pressing 
the right arrow. 

Let's try writing the right arrow section first. What we want to do, of 
course, is to increment (a computertalk word meaning "add one to") the 
appropriate variable, depending on which mode we're in. For example, if 
the value of mode is 0, that means that you, the user, have chosen to fool 
around with the scale of the shape. Therefore, pressing the right arrow 
means "set scale one higher!" We can do that like this: 

2210 IF MODE = 0 THEN SCL = SCL + 1 

There's just one problem. Scale can run from 0 to 255, but if it 
exceeds that amount, your Apple will bite you. To prevent this we want 
the above line to read "If mode is equal to zero, then add one to the vari- 
able 5d . . . unless, of course, scl is already equal to 255, in which case just 
forget the whole thing." In computerese you might write this: 

2210 IF MODE = 0 THEN SCL = SCL + 1 * (SCL < 255) 

What you have here is a clever use of a logical variable. If SCL is less 
than 255, then the expression (SCL < 255) is true and is evaluated as a 
one. So the value one times one is added to SCL. All well and good. 

However, if SCL has been added to until it equals 255, then 
(SCL < 255) is not true and is evaluated as zero. As we all remember 
from college, one times zero is equal to zero so nothing whatever gets 
added to SCL. Which is just the way we wanted it. 

Try adding lines 2220 through 2250 on your own before continuing. 
The upper limits for the different values are: RT=64; X=279; Y=191; 
and CLR=7. Go to it. 

If we are thinking along the same lines, your code should look some- 
thing like this: 



2220 IF MODE = 1 THEN RT = RT + 1 * (RT < 64) 
2230 IF MODE = 2 THEN X = X + 1 * (X < 279) 
2240 IF MODE = 3 THEN Y = Y + 1 * (Y < 191) 
2250 IF MODE = 4 THEN CLR = CLR + 1 * (CLR < 7) 
2260 GOTO 2010 

The same logic can be used to design the left arrow section, except 
that we will be decrementing all of the values. This part is entirely up 
to you. 

If curiosity drives you to try the program at this point, you'll discov- 
er at least one weakness in it. It isn't erasing the old shape before it draws 
a new one. Line 2040 has been left open for you to add the line that fixes 
it. Try it on your own. 

Did you come up with hcolor = O.draw 1 at X, Y] If so, go to the 
head of the class. 

We have to tie up the loose ends at line 2300, too. This is where pro- 
gram control was sent if the key you pressed was neither of the two ar- 
rows. We ought to add a couple of extra commands here before wrap- 
ping it up: 

2300 IF ASC (C$) = 13 THEN RUN 
2310 IF ASC (0$) = 12 THEN GOSUB 4000 
2320 IF ASC (C$) = 19 THEN GOSUB 4500 
2330 GOTO 2010 

Line 2300 gives us a chance to clear the screen and start over again, just 
by pressing return (CHR$(1 3)). The next two lines check to see if we have 
pressed control-L (CHR$(12)) orcontrol-S (CHR$(19)), which stand for 
load and save respectively. These two commands give us the opportu- 
nity to jump to the fourth and last part of the program, the part that 
saves and retrieves shapes from disk or cassette. 

Let's start with the save routines first, since you'll have to save some- 
thing before you can possibly load it. Applesoft doesn't have any nice 
shape save command; we have to save the appropriate area of memory 
using the bsave command if we have disk drives — and a very cumber- 
some method indeed if we are saving to tape.

4510 INPUT "D)ISK OR C)ASSETTE: ";C$: IF 0$ <> "D" AND C$ 

<> "C" THEN 4510 
4515 IF 0$ = "C" THEN 4600 
4520 INPUT "SAVE AS WHAT FILE: ";F1LE$ 

Since the save routines for disk and cassette are entirely different, we 
have had to determine which medium will be used to record the shape. 
The easiest way to determine this is to ask the user. If cassette is to be 
used, the program branches to line 4600. Otherwise, it continues and asks 
a name to save the file under. 

At this point it would be useful to get a catalog of the disk, so we can 
employ the same trick we tried when building our word processor 

4530 IF FILES = "" THEN PRINT: PRINT CHR$ (4);"CATAL0G": 
PRINT : PRINT : GOTO 4520 

We can save the shape table to disk by using bsave. We know that the 
starting address was $300. The length will be equal to bnum + 1 (can you 
figure out why we have to add the 1?). 

4540 PRINT CHR$(4);"BSAVE ";FILE$; A$300,L";BNUM + 1 

All that remains then is to turn the hi-res graphics back on and return to 
the main routine: 

4550 POKE -16304,0: POKE -16299,0: RETURN 

The cassette save routine should merely be taken as a matter of faith. 
In point of fact, the Applesoft designers appear wholly to have over- 
looked the problem, and the following lines of code are required to ma- 
nipulate the Apple's built-in cassette routines directly, something no 
self-respecting Basic programmer should ever have to do. 

4600 POKEO, BNUM + 1: POKE 1,0: POKE 60,0: POKE 61,0: POKE 

62,1: POKE 63,0: CALL - 307 
4610 POKE 60,0: POKE 61,3: POKE 62,BNUM + 1: POKE 63,3: 

CALL - 307 
4620 GOTO 4550 

For those who just gotta know, line 4600 puts a header out to the tape 
telling how many bytes of information will be in the shape. Line 4610 
puts the starting address of the shape in locations 60 and 61 and the end- 
ing address in locations 62 and 63 and then jumps to the cassette writing 
routine. 

No point in flogging a dead horse. Let's move on. We use a similar 
structure in designing our load routine. You should be able to write most 
of the disk load part without my help. Then take a look. Here is is. 

4000 TEXT : HOME : VTAB 5 

4010 INPUT "D)ISK OR C)ASSETTE: ";C$: IF C$ <> "D" AND 0$ 

<> "C" THEN 4010 
4015 IF 0$ = "C" THEN 4100 
4020 INPUT "WHICH FILE TO LOAD: "; FILES 
4030 IF FILES = "" THEN PRINT : PRINT CHRS (4);"CATAL0G": 

PRINT : PRINT: GOTO 4020 
4040 PRINT CHRS (4);"BL0AD ";FILES; "ASSOO" 
4050 GOTO 4550 
4100 SHLOAD : GOTO 4550 

Shload is Applesoft's cassette shape load command. It loads the shape in- 
to an area in high memory and automatically changes the values of loca- 
tions 232 and 233 to point to this area. 

There it is in all its glory, our first full-length, homespun utility. 
Shape tables are not necessarily the most useful things in the world, but 
their manipulation requires some programming skill, and the ability 
easily to create images on the screen is very rewarding. Sincere thanks to 
Brian Crouch, who designed this utility for your enjoyment. 31

BY DAVID HUHTER 

"The old world, the world to which I belong, was and in my universe 
alas still is, the world of the Crowd, the world of that detestable crawl- 
ing mass of un-featured, infected human beings. 

"You have never seen a Crowd, Crystal; and in all your happy life 
you never will. You have never seen a Crowd going to a football match or 
a race meeting or a bull-fight or a public execution or the like crowd joy; 
you have never watched a Crowd wedge and stick in a narrow place or 
hoot or howl in a crisis. You have never watched it stream sluggishly 
along the streets to gape at a King, or yell for a war, or yell quite equal- 
ly for a peace. And you have never seen the Crowd, struck by some 
Panic breeze, change from Crowd proper to Mob and begin to smash 
and hunt. All the Crowd celebrations have gone out of this world; all the 
Crowds gods, there is no Turf here, no Sport, no war demonstrations, 
no Coronations and Public Funerals, no great shows, but only your lit- 
tle theatres. . . . Happy Crystal! who will never see a Crowd!" 

— Mr. Barnstaple in H. G. Wells's Men Like Gods 

The solidarity of the crowd surprised Ray Davies of the Kinks. Late 
Saturday afternoon, September 4, 1982, attendance at the Us Festival 
had swelled to more than two hundred thousand. A hopping and bop- 
ping sea of hot and dirty bodies, this extra army that Lee could have used 
at Gettysburg raised their voices in unison with the music. 

Davies: "I'm on a low budget. What did you say?" (He points the mi- 
crophone at the crowd.) 

Crowd "Low budget!" 

Davies (visibly impressed if not a little frightened): "You don't have 
to shout." 

The song "Low Budget" was released on an album of the same name 
two years ago when times were thought to be rough. This summer the al- 
bum would have sold millions if anyone had had the money to buy it. 

It's no wonder that there was a ferocity in the way the crowd shouted 



Clockwise from top left: Ray Davies of the Kinks on the screen over the festival stage. Wandering minstrels play at the technology fair. Woz plays 
Defender. Keeping snakes cool. Mickey Hart, Bob Weir, and Billy Kreutzmann of the Grateful Dead at an aquatic press conference. Youngsters play 
Cavalier's Teleport. An enterphsing musician plays human jukebox. Center: Cooling off in a stream under a shade tree. 



"Low budget!" at Davies on the stage and at his image projected on a 
huge video screen high above. No one has been hurt more by the current 
recession than the fifteen year old through twenty-five year old age 
group. Try finding an unskilled job. Fat chance. It's slim pickings. 

U. S. Blues. There's only one cure for the low budget doldrums and 
that's a good party. You get together with friends and carouse away the 
specter of joblessness and the shadow of poverty. After all, recessions go 
away, given time. As Tom Petty would say; "It's the waiting that's the 
hardest part." 

Three cheers for Steve Wozniak and his grand party! Three cheers 
for Steve Wozniak and his twelve million dollars that made it all pos- 
sible! Surely the event of the year, it's far too early to call the Us Festival 
the event of the decade. But an event it was, long to be remembered by 
those who attended. 

TTie big story at the Us Festival was that it all worked. You could 
even say it worked smoothly. Sure, there was dust — a whole lot of dust 
(not just of the angelic variety). Sure, the temperature was more than one 



hundred degrees all three days. Sure, the distances between things meant 
trekking like Lawrence of Arabia aaoss the Sinai Peninsula every time 
you wanted a drink of water. Sure, you were liable to be cornered by a 
half dozen drunken, mostly naked concertgoers asking for a light or di- 
rections to the nearest beer garden. 

It was worth it. Dust, heat, and blisters were only minor distractions 
from an otherwise enjoyable and enriching weekend in the desertlike 
foothills of Devore, California. 

Ail Day and All of the Night. Some attendees complained of the 
heat, blaming the concert promoters for insisting on the lucrative Labor 
Day weekend to hold the festival. Actually, the temperature at night 
dropped just enough to be comfortable. This was fortunate because 
many attending the Us Festival came dressed in bathing suits to watch 
the music acts. Some even whisked those off to be as comfortable as pos- 
sible. If the concert had been held later in the year, the weather might 
have been a much more serious problem than it was. 

Through the whole weekend, about two thousand people were

nice, maybe even profitable, to offer 
a full line of printers that would look like 
Apples, last like Apples, with Apple 
warranties and Apple dealer service 
and Apple documentation. 

We even gave them Apple names: 

The new Apple Dot Matrix Printer. 

The new Apple Letter Quality Printer 

And the new Apple Thermal Printer 
[Which is really the old, reliable 
Silentype!"] 

Taking it from the top, our 7x9 
Apple Dot Matrix Printer is a superb 
machine for correspondence-quality 
printing. With exceptionally legible, 
fully-formed characters, it gives you 
a choice of eight different type sizes 
and five different fonts. It can also give 
you proportional spacing. Plus boldface 
phnting, underlining, varied pitches, 
varied line spacing and more. 

With 144x1 60 dots per square 
inch, our Dot Mathx can put all 
kinds of high resolution 
graphics on paper— from 
bar charts and line graphs 
to digitized portraits. 

The Apple Letter Quality 
Printer, on the other hand, is 
the preferred machine forjustthat. 
In fact, for any word processing or data 
processing applications where 
graphics aren't a primary concern. 

For one thing, it lets you get the 
words out faster. At a blazing 40 cps

Naturally all our printers - including 
the sturdy inexpensive Silentype'"— are 
deliberately designed to take full 
advantage of all the advantages 
built into every Apple computer 
The interfaces are clean, the 
electronics compatible. So 
you don't have to go peeking 
and poking to adapt print 
commands or parameters, or 
spend your summer vacation 
kluging an interface. Which is 
a lot more than we can say for the 
Samurai Ichiban. 

All of which should stimulate you, 
we hope, to see the newest Apples 
up close. 
They look good, even on paper

treated at the festival's medical tent. The problems ranged from sprains 
and drug overdoses to asthmahke attacks caused by the swirling dust. 
Sixty-seven people were treated at local hospitals. The only death asso- 
ciated with the festival occurred the morning before it opened. A man 
was killed on the freeway in a car accident near the site. 

For the most part the attendees were law-abiding, except for drugs 
and nudity. There were only thirty-six arrests, mostly for vehicle theft, 
drugs, and carrying concealed weapons. A T-shirt salesman was ab- 
ducted at gunpoint and robbed. There was one reported rape and sever- 
al cases of assault. That's it. In a city of more than two hundred thou- 
sand inhabitants such good behavior for a holiday weekend is a minor 
miracle. 

Sprawling over five hundred acres, the Glen Helen Regional Park the 
evening before the opening of the festival was a scene to remember, like 
Yorktown before the arrival of Comwallis. Frenzied activity was evi- 
dent most everywhere except in the concert area, which was remarkably 
peaceful. The massive grass and dirt amphitheater was silent and empty. 



Later Thursday night the crowd began pouring into the area. They 
came in trucks, vans, cars, helicopters, and buses. They rode motor- 
cycles, hitchhiked, and walked. They came from all over the North 
American continent and farther, mainly to hear the music acts. They 
would find much more. 

Seen and Not Seen. A decision was made a month before the festi- 
val to advertise it primarily as a rock show, Wozniak's original idea was 
to have a spectacular technology fair that would complement the enter- 
tainment and add punch to the philosophy behind the Us Festival. There 
was a technology fair, housed in five huge circus tents, but one got the im- 
pression that many people were more thankful for the air-conditioned 
environment than for the content of the exhibits. 

A wildly diverse group of exhibitors spread their wares for the steady 
stream of sweaty bodies. Fox Video Games unleashed their "Games of 
the Century," including Worm War I, Deadly Duck. Beany Bopper, and 
Fast Eddie. Produced by Sirius Software, the games are compatible with 
the Atari Video Computer System and the Sears Tele-Games machine.

OCTOBER 1982 



Fox Video, a wholly owned subsidiary of Twentieth Century-Fox Film 
Corporation, must have been pleased at the attention awarded their new 
games at the Us Festival. Jerry Jewell of Sirius was in attendance and 
actually smiled once or twice. 

Computers, computer games, video arcade games, science, music, 
and science fiction were the main themes of the technology fair. Apple, 
Atari, and Quantel Computers all had respectable displays. Exhibiting 
products for the Apple were Link Systems, Softape, Novation, R. H. 
Electronics, FMJ, Passport Designs, and Syntauri, to name a few. Three 
of the tents had several dozen standup arcade games each. Old and 
young alike tested their skills against Defender, Tempest, Zaxxon, Red 
Clash, Centipede, Krazy Kong, and others. 

Kittlevision had a small booth where they imparted information on 
various components for home satellite receiving stations. There were bro- 
chures for Television Receive Only, TVRO, billed as the "finest home 
entertainment system available today." From United Satellite Systems, 
TVRO features more than fifty television channels and they're predict- 
ing one hundred and fifty by 1985. 

Life during Wartime. Claiming to be the "biggest SF novel ever 
published," L. Ron Hubbard's soon to be published Battlefield Earth 
was the recipient of a lavish spread. A ten-foot-tall replica of one of the 
aliens in the novel, called Psychlos, was chained between two walls. 
Booth attendees dressed in Scottish garb explained what was going on. 
Besides being more than nine hundred pages long, Battlefield Earth is 
going to have its own soundtrack album written by Hubbard along with 
jazz talents Chick Corea and Stanley Clark. 

In the speaker tent, Chick Corea gave a demonstration of the Fair- 
light computer synthesizer, which allows sounds to be recorded, stored, 
and then played through a keyboard. The music for Battlefield Earth is 
being called Space Jazz, where real sounds are used for melodies and 
rhythms with a jazz beat. The sound in the speaker's tent was loud and 
raspy, eliciting howls of pleasure from the music-hungry crowd of shade- 
seekers. 

Other guest speakers included jazz great Herbie Hancock, also

playing Fairlight. When asked whether he was completely abandoning 
more traditional instruments for the computer variety, Hancock said he 
would never do that, but sophisticated synthesizers like the Fairlight 
were fascinating and revolutionary. Bob Moog, the father of the synthe- 
sizer, gave a presentation on the history of electronic music. It was diffi- 
cult to see slides in the sunlit tent, but Moog gave an interesting talk. 

Give the People Wliat Tliey Want. The wizard Woz himself made a 
much publicized talk about the history of the Us Festival, where he can- 
didly discussed some of the problems encountered. Scheduled to speak 
on the first day, Wozniak cancelled once and then again. He finally 
spoke on Sunday to a packed tent, receiving several standing ovations. 

It all started when he was driving down the freeway listening to the 
radio. How neat it is, Wozniak thought, to hear several different types of 
music at one sitfing. From these humble beginnings began all the rumors 
and legends. Having been beat up worse than Muhammed Ali's punch- 
ing bag by the press and doomsayers, Wozniak seemed pleased and very 
confident on Sunday. 

He made it clear he was throwing a party for a few thousand of his 
friends. This was not meant to be some political statonent or great cul- 
tural showpiece. The theme of the festival, for Wozniak, was people 
working together. Despite some difficulties between Unuson and Bill 
Graham Presents, Wozniak proclaimed the ambitious endeavor a certi- 
fied success as far as he was concerned. The crowd agreed. 

Another much delayed event was the opening of the Sensonics 
Theater. Thursday afternoon, the power went off around the exhibition 
area and the sixty-foot inflatable dome that housed the theater col- 
lapsed. Two days later the video and audio display was still not working, 
but on Sunday it was finally up and running. The waiting made ex- 
pectations soar. Unfortunately, the promoters didn't make full use of the 
dome as a circular video screen, projecting a standard rectangular image 
on two sides of the dome's wall. 

The Sensonics theater uses the dome structure as a parabolic reflec- 
tor for eight channels of discrete sound. Needless to say, the audio por- 
tion was somewhat better than the visuals, though marred by the bois- 
terous audience, who quickly discovered that any sounds they made were 
amplified by the dome just as well as the eight-channel sound was. Il- 
luminated at night, from the outside, the Sensonics Theater resembled 
half of a giant crystal ball. 

Catch Me Now, I'm Falling. The sale of tickets to the Us Festival 
went through several phases. At first only three-day tickets costing 
$37.50 were announced, but, despite a solid lineup of music acts, sales 
were slow. Then one-day tickets costing $17.50 were announced, with 
promoters still claiming that no tickets would be sold at the festival site. 
The final agreement was to sell tickets at the door, though the wait would 
surely be long. 

There were remarkably few hassles in this regard. Everybody who 
showed up wiUing to pay got in. The camping areas were large enough and 
the facilities adequate, though nowhere near the Ritz. Port-A-Potties 
numbered two thousand and were strategically placed all around the fes- 
tival site and the camping areas. There were never lines. Hundreds of 
drinking water outlets brought water to the dehydrated masses. There 
were both drinking fountains and faucets for those wanting an impro- 
visatorial minishower. 

Two communal shower areas were popular, as was a shallow and 
fantastically cold pool in one of the beer gardens. The promoters were al- 
ways thinking of the attendees during the preparations. One nice touch 
was a good sized sound system at the far beer garden (half a mile from 
the stage) bringing the music live and loud to those punishing brews or 
relaxing in the pool. Many attendees grumbled about the two lakes being 
off limits to swimming. Wide and deep, the main lake was wisely fenced 
off for safety reasons. The other lake was in the backstage area and very 
few people got anywhere near it. 

Water was the most precious possession of the weekend, but food in 
great quantities was also needed. Though open campfires were banned, 
many attendees brought their own food. There was plenty at the festival 
site for those with only cash in their possession. Hot dogs, hamburgers, 
corn, and other munchies kept the hunger pangs at bay. The longest lines 
were for the sweet and sour pork at the one food stand offering more 
than the usual ballpark delicacies.

From Small Things, Mama, Big Things One Day Come. Late Fri- 
day afternoon, a special press conference was held with Steve Wozniak 
and Bill Graham in attendance. They announced the first direct televi- 
sion broadcast ever between the Soviet Union and the United States to 
occur that night. Plans for this had been alive for more than a year and 
Wozniak thought the time was right. Graham reportedly went along but 
protested that this kind of thing was inappropriate for a rock show. 

That night, between Talking Heads and the Police, a broadcast from 
Moscow was beamed to the three large video screens around the stage. 
The content of the first broadcast was less than exciting. It consisted of a 
short travelog around Moscow. The next day, portions of Eddie 
Money's set were beamed to the Soviet Union and snippets of a crowd 
attending a rock show in Moscow were shown to the Us Festival crowd. 
It was a brief but historic encounter, and Woz made it happen. 

One of the measures of success in an event the size of the Us Festi- 
val, according to Wozniak, is how the end product is received. In the case 
of the Us Festival, the most important end product was the music and it 
was an unqualified success. Sure, there wasn't a superstar act like Bruce 
Springsteen, The Who, the Rolling Stones, or Stevie Wonder. But heck, 
Betty Boop on that stage with that sound system would sound like a mil- 
lion dollar act. 

In terms of presentation, the festival stage and sound system were un- 
paralleled. Measuring in at three hundred feet by sixty-seven feet, the 
stage area was easily big enough to hold a chained-up King Kong and 
twice the usual amount of Radio City Music Hall Rockettes. The sound 
system was loud and clear, three times the size of the typical Rolling 
Stones setup. 

Two fifty-foot Eidaphor screens on either side of the stage and a 
twenty foot by thirty foot Diamond Vision screen above the stage pro- 
vided a front row view of the music acts almost anywhere in the fifty- 
seven acre amphitheater. Several video cameras set up around the stage 
and one on a swinging boom in front of the stage provided a variety of 
angles. Unfortunately, the same image had to be projected on all three 
screens at once during the live broadcasts. Still, the total effect, en- 
hanced by spectacular spotlights and the awesome sound system, was a 
religious experience. 

Almost Saturday Night. Between music acts all three days and 
nights, video images were projected on the Diamond Vision screen, 
usually in time with music. Janek Kaliczak of the "World's Largest Ap- 
ple System" (December 1981 Softalk) used a font generation program 
he's been working on for a year and a half to display graphics and text on 
the Diamond Vision screen. Usually given two to three minutes between 
acts, Kaliczak and two Apples were responsible for displaying the Us 
Festival logo and brief messages. 

"Sometimes we had a lot more than three minutes," explains Kal- 
iczak, "because the regular video equipment would break down from the 
heat. The Apples were not down at all, even when we ran them fourteen 
to sixteen hours a day." 

Hidden behind a door with the sign "Applefex" stuck on it, to let 
people know where he was, Kaliczak also digitized images of notables 
like Wozniak for displaying on the Diamond Vision screen. "This was a 
good field test of the system," Kaliczak said. "Everything worked per- 
fectly, though this wasn't what the system is designed for. It's meant to 
be used in regular studio broadcasting and industrial displays." 

Saturday night, between Pat Benatar and Tom Petty, the crowd of 
two hundred thousand was treated to the most spectacular laser display 
this side of Star Wars. A dozen or so bright green slivers shot off in all di- 
rections, blinking on and off and swiveling in time to music. Other lasers 
projected fantastic geometric and hyperbolic patterns on special screens 
next to the stage. If there hadn't been so much dust and if the night sky 
had been clearer, the effect would have been even more stunning. 

Crawling from the Wreckage. Every night after the show was over, 
concertgoers would stream from the amphitheater, a human tide in the 
dust and trash. Many helped clean up as they left. There were no stam- 
pedes, no mad rushes, no serious altercations between attendees and 
security. The crowd was good, because the music was good. The end 
product reached and surpassed expections. 

In this age of telecommuting and pay TV, it's good to know that 
large crowd gatherings can still come off with relative ease. The Us Fes- 
tival is a crowning achievement for the promoters and planners. The list 



of those responsible is long, much too long to mention all. But special 
kudos are due Stanley Kephart, responsible for land development and 
public safety; Otis Swanson, construction coordinator of the festival site; 
Craig Tocher, in charge of architectural design and land restoration plan- 
ning; and Pancho Rodriguez, head of the production team for site 
development. 

Wozniak, Unuson president Peter Ellis, and Bill Graham were the 
inspired generals of this strat^c effort. Unuson may produce another fes- 
fival next Labor Day weekend or sooner. This year's Us Festival will live 
long in the annals of rock and roll and Apple Computer lore. 
Mr. Barnstaple, you don't know what you're missing. 

Thoughts from the Crowd 

The following vignettes and impressions were gathered during the three 
day festival by Al Tommervik, David Durkee, Matthew Yuen, and 
David Hunter. 

Countering the counterculture: Seen Sunday on the concert grounds was 

a rotund, elderly man with a T-shirt carrying the legend, "If you want to 

get stoned, drink wet cement." AT 

Sign: "Jim from Laytonville, where are you?" nv 

Planned pickups: Despite possible ideological shortcomings, the festival 

was very well planned and executed for an event involving more than 

two hundred thousand people. Parking was reasonably well organized, 

even to having shuttle buses running from the outlying parking lots five 

miles away. DD 

In-tourist service: Sweatshirt and T-shirt legends indicated that just 
about every state in the union was represented by attendees. Canadian 
and Texas flags represented the foreigners. AT 

Bikers: Four men dancing under and waving a Canadian flag came 
down from Edmonton, Alberta, on three motorcycles. For them, the Us 
Festival "is just the beginning of a month-long party. We're going back 
home in October." tlV 

Comparative Review: First speaker of the festival Stewart Brand, editor 




R«^C-|3\tRieJ5 hp b-'-C- C-5R5\T 
bC-N^C- P^b3^ b'<- (eibR^iei 



and publisher of Coevolution Quarterly: "What's the difference between 
the Us Festival and the Nuremberg Rallies? The music's better." DH 
Exhibition blues: More than half the exhibitors were associated with mi- 
crocomputers, but it was the music exhibits that got the most and biggest 
play — among them Syntauri and Passport Designs, who use Apples in 
conjunction with their keyboards. AT 

Tech talk: Although more heterogeneous than Applefest, the technology 
fair was no more exciting. Some exhibits successfully got across the point 
of what new technologies are doing and can do for mankind. The L-5 so- 
ciety is a national organization for promoting and supporting space de- 
velopment from the grassroots level. Their small booth had posters, 
pamphlets, and people willing to talk about the present and future of our 
involvement in space. DD 

More acreage? Concerning the cancellation of the announced robot 
marathon, one disgruntled exhibitor said "They didn't give us enough 
room." DH 

Where were the Moonies? The booths that really had something mean- 
ingful to say were the hardest to find. They had to compete with the big- 
ger, flashier exhibits of the mass-market organizations like Atari with 
their home video systems, Mattel Electronics with their electronic drums 
and games, and L. Ron Hubbard's people, who were hyping Hubbard's 
latest science fiction opus and its soundtrack album. DD 
Eye-opening sights: Computer shows were never like this. The high tem- 
perature caused the flower of southern California youth to come dressed 
as scantily as is legal. The following week's Miss America contest was 
hard-pressed to match the pulchritude on display. AT 
Reach for the sky. By Sunday afternoon, sheriffs in the security towers 
and sound engineers in the light and speaker towers were sharing their 
high-perched viewing areas with bikini-clad women who danced to the 
audience's delight. HV 

When you're hot, you're hot: Despite free showers and misters to keep 
the audience cool, the hundred-degree temperatures probably had a lot 
to do with the tameness of the crowd. Standing in that kind of heat for 
six hours will take the aggressiveness out of anybody. AT 



Hey, mister: The most popular concession offered by the organizers was 
a simple plant sprayer with the festival logo that became a way of shar- 
ing comfort with others. Mist a stranger; make a friend. DD 
All seasons: Three retired couples from San Jose, California, who decid- 
ed to attend the festival together the same day they returned from a va- 
cation in Hawaii, loaded up their motor home, drove more than three 
hundred miles, and bought tickets at the door. "Our kids go to these 
shows all the time; we wanted to see what it was all about." nv 
A bit commercial: The concessions for Miller and Tecate beers and 
Coca-Cola were hefty money earners but welcome alternatives to water 
even at the somewhat inflated prices. Us Festival T-shirts in many forms, 
some official, some home-grown, were sold at stands and by itinerant 
vendors. DD 

Messages from above: Skywriting filled the sky all three afternoons. The 
messages were mainly commercial in nature. "E. T. Phone Home" and 
"Fast Times at Ridgemont High" advertised popular movies. "It's a 
Boy" alluded to Wozniak's newborn child. DU 

The pub with no beer: One of the two beer gardens actually went dry 
Saturday. With a more rowdy crowd, that could have been an invitation 
to disaster. At Glen Helen, it merely resulted in miscellaneous 
grumbling. AT 

Wet ones: Jerry Garcia, during the Grateful Dead's set: "At Woodstock 
we all had to help each other keep dry. Here we have to help each other 
keep wet." In the hundred and ten degree heat and the almost choking 
dust of the amphitheater, Garcia had neatly encapsulated the feeling of 
togetherness at the Us Festival. DD 

Breakfast with the Dead: The Grateful Dead are legends from the 
sixties, but they exhibited considerable pulling power Sunday morning. 
More people came from outside southern California to hear the Dead 
than any other group. AT 

Counterpoint parables: A barefoot Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead 
crossing a stream backstage: "Watch the Dead walk on water." DU 
Lead singer Sting of the Police: "This is the largest audience we've ever 
played to, but it doesn't mean anything unless we all act together. We 
must have cohesion." flV 

Red, white, and blue: Near the end of Jackson Browne's set, an Ameri- 
can flag was carried through the crowd to great cheers. And when, ex- 
cept for the Olympics, have two hundred thousand people gathered in 
one place cheered Old Glory? AT 

The beat goes on: Toward the middle of the concert area gathered a 
crowd of more than a hundred who eloped and bounced off each other 
as one man provided rhythmic drive on a set of congas. It wasn't long be- 
fore other spectators joined the act by setting up an impromptu limbo 
dance, moving in unison to the crowd's continuous chanting of "Us! Us! 
Us. . . !" On the outside of the circle, you couldn't see what was going on 
in the middle, but you didn't care. You just picked up a rock and a cup, 
or two sticks, or anything that would make noise, and joined in the 

fun. nv 

Fistful of dollars. Close to two hundred thousand people waited for 
something to happen before the Ramones played on Saturday after- 
noon. Suddenly the title track of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, one 
of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns, boomed on the mammoth sound 
system. Hollywood would have paid a lot more than twelve million dol- 
lars to capture such scenes. DH 

We're all together. But what was all this "us" business about anyway? 
The message was getting through, if not verbally, then emotionally. If 
you were looking for an "us" answer, nobody told you. You just felt it. 
You did it. It was the people staying after the show each night to help 
pick up trash. It was the security guards offering rides in their golf carts 
to festivalgoers who had long walks back to the campgrounds. It was the 
mutual spraying of water at each other in efforts to keep cool, or just to 
say hello. tlV 

Another Apple Seed: Bill Graham's looking to take credit for the Us 
Festival, even to the point of obnoxiously croaking "My Way" with pi- 
ano accompaniment after Fleetwood Mac closed the show. Fact: Gra- 
ham is merely a booking agent; the warmth and generosity of spirit that 
pervaded the attendees was another manifestation of that special feeling 
that is Apple. What Woz proved is that Apple esprit de corps is portable 
to other environments. AT HI

Prisoner 2. By David Mullich. Maybe you were one of the lucky ones 
who escaped from the Island. In doing so, you proved yourself a master 
of cunning strategy and brilliant logic. Many of your compatriots in the 
Service were not as lucky. Some live there still; others found suicide the 
ultimate solution to getting off the Island. 

You changed your name, enlisted the aid of a plastic surgeon, and as- 
sumed a new identity. For months you hid in the shadows, relying on 
your former training in the Service to scavenge the necessities of life. You 
could smell Pax lurking around every comer. After a while you began to 
relax your defenses and chose to leave the safety of your sanctuary. At 
the airport you purchased a ticket but found it strange to be the only per- 
son on the plane. Only when the voice of the Caretaker crackled over the 
cabin intercom did you realize the horrible truth. 

The Master never forgot about you. He figured that a little time on 
the outside would erode your defenses. Could you now be persuaded to 
break down and reveal your resignation code — the three digit number 
that summarizes your reasons for resigning the Service? Are you an 
easier, softer mark for the Master or has the constant fear of being re- 
captured kept your senses as finely tuned as before? A few days on the Is- 
land in Prisoner 2 and both you and the Master will know. 

Prisoner 2, like its predecessor, is a science-fiction nightmare. Again, 
you are charged with the task of searching for clues to help you escape 
from the Island. Only this time the Master and Caretaker have added 
thirty-two brilliant colors, hi-res animation, and somefimes jarring, of- 
ten hypnotic sounds to distract you from your purpose — all for just a few 
dollars more than the price of the original game. Every structure, path, 
stranger, and object you encounter is part of a grand deception with the 
dual purpose of extracting vital information from you and breaking 
down your spirit of individualism. The Caretaker has a diabolical new set 
of tricks to get you to reveal your resignation code. Your every move is 
monitored and points are assigned for intelligent play. 

Each of the twenty buildings on the Island is itself a game of wit and 
logic that is further veiled by a curtain of glitter, color, and sound. Even 
worse, upon repeated visits to many of the buildings, you'll find that their 
layouts have changed — or are you losing your mind, perhaps? More than 
anything. Prisoner 2 is a game of details. In the early stages of the game 
you will face many dead ends and assimilate a lot of what seems to be ir- 
relevant information. You must persevere. Take careful notes; no clue 
can be considered too trivial to the overall solution. You must read be- 
tween the lines, use logical deduction, and throw out your old thinking 
patterns. When all else fails, rely on intuition. 

Beginning with a newly designed three-dimensional maze (hint; don't 
go out empty-handed), you'll find that even the keyboard functions 
change as you move through the game. What you press on the keyboard 
is not always what appears on the screen. Persistence is the key. Some- 
times it wins you points when you least expect it. 

A word of caution: There is a stop and save feature built into Prison- 
er 2. typing control-C or Stasis at a convenient time the game will be 
suspended and you will be able to check how the Caretaker has been rat- 
ing your performance. Every decision you make is scored, and your score 
is dependent upon how well your actions reflect individual thinking. A 
number of doors will be closed to you until you reach a high enough 
score. And if you have stopped the game (to rest or seek psychological 
treatment) any player booting the disk will automatically be transported 
to the Island and assume your identity. If the newcomer succumbs to the

Sales Order Entry III. By Richard Loggins. Nobody's going to com- 
pare Sales Order Entry III with VisiCalc III and nobody's going to utter 
Richard Loggins's name in the same breath with Robert Frankston. But 
it's the appearance of software such as this that contributes to the grow- 
ing conviction that the new, improved Apple III can be more than just a 
specialized spreadsheet and word processor. 

Sales Order Entry III is a pjerfectly straightforward program that does 
what its name purports — it allows you to enter orders into your system, 
track their progress, ship them to the correct address, bill them to the 
correct party, and track the efficiency of your salespersons. What's re- 
markable about the program is not that it does all these things, but that it 
does them so easily. 

Author Richard Loggins has capitalized on the power of SOS to 
keep several interactive files open at all times, allowing rapid passage of 
data from one part of the program to another. Capturing this data in like 
fashion on an Apple II would be an arduous and tortuous task. On the 
Apple III, it all comes down slick and easy. Working with this software 
gives you the feeling of minicomputers, not microcomputers. 

This program has gone through several development stages to get to 
this point, but it still has a couple of rough edges. Its mailing label sort is 
slow, and the author has defined field names and record lengths for 
you — a noxious practice. Turnkey microcomputer software won't be 
truly modern until those items are totally user definable. On the other 
hand, Loggins redeems himself by leaving his program unlocked. If you 
have the time, knowledge, and inclination, you can modify his defini- 
tions to better meet your needs. 

Sales Order Entry III is a specialized database application that takes 
advantage of the power and sophistication of the Apple III. Every dealer

Teleport. By Mike Abbot. Teleport is Cavalier's watershed product in 
many ways: It's the first Cavalier product lacking the Jim Nitchals 
byline, it's the first Cavalier product in several months, and it's the first 
Cavalier product the company will try to sell outside their former exclu- 
sive distribution agreement with Softsel. It's also the first verbose arcade 
game, although you don't need the sound to enjoy the action. 

Teleport is a maze game in which several lost aliens wander through 
one of ten mazes. It's your job to stun the aliens and haul them to a warp 
chamber so they can be transported home. But don't come in contact 
with an unstunned ahen — that's instant death. 

Author Mike Abbot has drawn from recent Cavalier entries Bug At- 
tack and Microwave in that there's lots of action on the screen at all 
times. Up to five aliens at a time wander the maze. The warp chamber 
entrance moves every few seconds, which can be terribly disconcerting 
when you're within pixels of it. 

Also on screen at all times are two teleport doors. Should several of 
the lost aliens be closing in on you, you can enter a teleport door and be 
relocated elsewhere in the maze. Sometimes your relocation is directly on 
top of a wandering alien, however. Periodically appearing in the maze 
are two stars — the happy star is worth points, the grumpy star is death. 

All these elements combine in a form that should keep arcade fans in- 
terested for some time. 

Abbot wrote the program, which has sound effects either way, to 
work with the Votrax speech synthesizer, but even owners of the Votrax 
might never be able to prove it. The Votrax device requires a serial card, 
and it turns out that all serial cards are not created equal. In fact, serial 
cards are so unequal in the way they handle data that Cavalier could find 
only two that were compatible with their game — the CCS and the MPC 
cards. So possession of a Votrax unit is not guaranteed to get Teleport 
to talk. 

Luckily, the vocal aspect of Teleport is just the frosting on the cake 
and not the whole pastry. The mute Teleport stands by itself as one of the 
five best of the early Christmas season entries. ART 
Teleport, by Mike Abbot, Cavalier Computer (Box 2032, Del Mar, CA 92014; 
714-755-8143). $29.95. 

Wayout. By Paul Edelstein. At last! A maze game that doesn't require 
you either to eat or to leave a trail of dots. Instead, you merely need to 
find the way out. Merely? Perhaps a stronger word is in order. 

You begin with a choice of twenty-six mazes. Upon selecting one, 
you enter the maze armed only with a compass and a mapmaker. The 
compass shows on the screen as an arrow within a diagram of the four 
cardinal points. The mapmaker creates a twisty maze of purple lines at the 
bottom of the screen to show where you've been so far. Using these two 
devices, you must hunt for an exit, represented by a flashing colored rec- 
tangle. 

There are a few obstacles to be overcome in Wayout. One is the wind, 
which may or may not originate from the very exit you seek. At times 
this wind is so powerful that you can't move directly into it. You'll be 
able to tell when this happens by the simple fact that you can't go for- 
ward. There are fireflies in the various mazes, and at times they'll drift 
by, indicating from which direction the wind is blowing. Take note of 
this when it happens, for it can give you a clue to the direction of the exit. 

A much more aggravating obstacle is the Cleptangle. This revolving 
orange and white rectangular critter is an irrepressible sneak thief. Any 
time it gets near you, your mapmaker, compass, or both will be stolen. 
The only way to get them back is to chase the Cleptangle through the 
maze until you have it trapped in a corner somewhere. But even after 
you've taken back your possessions, watch out! The Cleptangle never tires 
of petty thievery. And it has no trouble with the wind. The other obsta- 
cles are the mazes themselves. Each one is exceedingly complex and en- 
dowed with the quality of looking virtually like any other spot in the 
maze. Down here disorientation is a way of life. 

The graphics in Wayout are outstanding. The mazes are three-dimen- 
sional and quite confusing, while remaining true to themselves. Each 
maze is extensive and bewildering. Your point of view is that of a person 



walking — actually more like roller skating in speed and smoothness — 
through; what you see is what you get. The graphics are so remarkable 
that you can pirouette rapidly and see the maze swirl all around you in 
all its detail. 

The package comes with a cardboard compass and a set of Wayoul 
protective goggles. Don the goggles, grasp your compass, and prepare to 
venture forth into the most challenging set of mazes ever brought to the 
CRT screen. You have nothing to lose but your sanity. DA 
Wayout, by Paul Edelstein, Sirius Software (10364 Rockingham Drive, Sacra- 
mento, CA 95827; 916-366-1195). $39.95. 

Serpentine. By David Snider. Every now and then, mixed in with the 
flood of new game software, a truly great game appears. Serpentine is 
one of these. 

The elements of the game are relatively simple. You are initially rep- 
resented by three small serpents in a nest. Your opponents are three large 
serpents in a maze. You and your opponents grow in size and power by 
eating frogs, the eggs of the other serpents, and the other serpents them- 
selves head-on (if they are smaller than you). Serpents are reduced in 
size either by laying eggs or by having bits of tail bitten off. The frogs 
love eggs and will go after any egg available, although they seem to like 
yours best. The other serpents' eggs hatch if you don't eat them; then you 
have another serpent to contend with. 

When you've eaten all the opponents, you move to the next and more 
difficult level, scoring higher points for eating eggs and serpents. If one of 
your eggs survives through the round, it hatches and returns to your nest, 
giving you another reserve serpent. You receive bonus serpents when you 
reach twenty thousand points, fifty thousand points, and at each multi- 
ple of fifty thousand points. 

Serpentine offers a good challenge to plan your strat^y and, with a 
little experience, you can take advantage of the different maze configu- 
rations. Each level through twenty has its own unique maze. There are 
no sudden surprises; no threat will suddenly appear out of thin air. You 
can see everything that's happening in the maze. 

The hi-res color graphics, while not flashy, are well done and very 
smooth. Color is nearly essential, because it is the only easy way to know 
if you dare face an attacking serpent head-on. 

The sound effects are descriptive and realistic. Frogs sound like frogs 
and eggs eaten or hatched sound like little shells breaking. However, in 
consideration of late-in-the-night players, the sound may be turned off. 

Considering all the detail and activity, the speed and smoothness of 
the game is surprising. It is very responsive to input commands, either by 
assignable keys or with a joystick. Play may be suspended at any time by 
pressing the escape key, and a bad beginning can be cancelled by hitting 
control-R, giving yourself a fresh start without rebooting the disk. There 
is a provision for recording the ten all-time high scores, and the top five 
scores in the current session are kept whether they make the "Hall of 
Fame" or not. 

Above all. Serpentine is addictive. No matter how experienced you 
may be, you'll see the mistakes you made and feel certain that if you play 
just one more game you'll do better — and you probably will. ) DU 
Serpentine, by David Snider, Broderbund (1938 Fourth Street, San Rafael, CA 
94901; 415-456-6424). $34.95. 

Transylvania. By Antonio Antiochia. One more variation on an old 
theme, Transylvania contains just enough twists and innovations to make 
it seem fresh and bright. But the story is not the big story. The big story is 
the graphics. 

There's been a spate of software acknowledging Penguin Software's 
graphics packages as tools, and the graphics have been singularly medio- 
cre. Now Penguin leader Mark Pelczarski and right-hand Dave Albert 
have conspired with newcomer Antonio Antiochia to show us what The 
Graphics Magician can do. 

The result is consistently the best graphics ever in a hi-res adventure. 
There are faster graphics, though few, but there are none more attrac- 
tive, none clearer, none more thou^tfuUy done. Everything is recogniz- 
able; there are no glitches, save the normal fast-fill, drop-where-it-will 
variety. 

The author is equally considerate in the story. You will never be 
killed in Transylvania without a chance to see the peril and overcome it or 
flee it. Of course, once you see it, well, then you'd better make the cor- 



rect move right away. 

There are vampires and werewolves, goblins, witches, wizards, black 
cats, fleeing rats, hooting owls, howling dogs, and nasty bats. Some just 
keep their eyes on you; others you must deal with. Remember that ward- 
ing off danger is not always the best course; at some point the danger 
must be dealt with. (Hint, hint.) There are also frogs and eagles and 
princesses and a big surprise. 

Rescuing the Princess Sabrina from the evil vampire is your mission. 
(Once more, female readers have to pretend to be male; the game's still 
fun — it's the reward that loses meaning.) First you must do away with 
some more pesky creatures, gather several implements, and take the 
vampire who holds the princess captive out of the picture. Then you 
must find her and free her. And all within five hours of dark midnight; 
she dies at dawn. 

The puzzles are excellent, of an easy to medium variety, and logical 
within the realm of fantasy. There are no foolish tricks designed just to 
trap you. 

Transylvania is not a word game. The author has attempted to in- 
clude every word you might try in the game's vocabulary; and if the 
game doesn't know a word, it tells you whether it's the command or the 
noun that it's stuck on. 

Overall, this is a thoroughly enjoyable adventure, of normal propor- 
tions, with delightful graphics and some good surprises. In its first foray 
into the field. Penguin has proven itself a worthy adventurer. flCT

push the power switch to the 'off position to stop the machine 
temporarily." 

"Yes, Mr. Higgenbottom." 

That memorable scene from a classic television series leaps instantly 
to mind when describing Pie Man. What fun it was to watch Lucy battle 
the miracles of automation as the machine eventually won. The only dif- 
ference in Pie Man is that you are a baker's apprentice filling in a sum- 
mer position, and there is no "off switch to save you. 

You must run to get the topping from one area, cherries from an- 
other, and put the pies away when finished in another area. Nothing 
complicated here. Pies begin appearing one at a time, allowing you to fin- 
ish what you start before moving on. Later, they come out closer togeth- 
er, forcing you to make such professional baker's decisions as "Should I 
put toppings on both pies and then cherries, or should I do one pie at a 
time?" It won't be long before you start to feel like an actual real-life 
baker making actual real-life baker moves. 

And, as if that weren't enough, sacks of flour, grease spots, and a 
wobbly footed wedding cake baker appear, only to become obstacles in 
your path. Job performance evaluation is simple: let seven pies drop and 
you're fired. 

You begin to wonder. Why can't you move the pie toppings and 
cherries closer to the conveyor belt so you don't have to dart back and 
forth? Why don't they fire the honyock who's leaving the flour and 
grease all over the place? And, finally, when they invented this pie-mak- 
ing machine, why didn't they include the topping and cherry functions as 
well? Quit complaining; if they did, you'd be out of a job. 

Pie Man is playable either from keyboard, with eight directional 
movement keys, or with a joystick, the preferred mode. There are no 
numbered levels of progression; but you get promoted as your pie-mak- 
ing efficiency increases. 

At first, putting toppings on pies may not seem as glamorous as 
shooting down fifty thousand points' worth of wicked aliens or bomb- 
ing out the bad guys as you valiantly rescue captives. But you may 
change your mind when you start reaching the enviable positions of lead

Acey Deucey. By Larry Sherman. By their nature, computers are good 
at organizing data, retrieving data, and gambling. In probably the oldest 
and simplest of the noble games of chance, your Apple has a definite 
edge. Success at Acey Deucey depends on your ability to figure the odds 
of a third card failing between the high and low values of the first two 
cards. If it's lower than the low card or higher than the high card or equal 
to either, you lose. (You can't "pass"; you can only bet low.) The game is 
named for the gambler's golden ideal of an ace and a deuce flanking the 
crucial third card, a situation in which one can't lose . . . almost. 

The computer version of this venerable game allows up to four 
players, all starting out with $50 apiece. You can try to break the bank, 
assigning any astronomical amount you wish for an endless game, or 
draw on a modest fixed pot that shrinks and expands according to the 
fortunes of the players. 

The attraction of the game, on the computer as in the real world, is its 
speed and economy. Bet everything you have on one likely chance and 
you can double your money on the turn of a card. Do this successfully a 
certain number of times and laws of geometric progression will smile 
upon you with a shining radiance. 

That simple attraction is, of course, most people's downfall. It looks 
so easy. A five and a king? How can you lose? Very simply. The Apple's 
circuitry is confused neither by greed nor trepidation. In such a play, it 
instantly figures the odds on one of the seven desired cards being the 
third drawn, compares them to the odds of one of the six losing cards 
turning up, and then bets exactly the right amount — enough to add sub- 
stantial if not spectacular winnings to its stake, and not so much that a 
loss would take more than a few more cooly reasoned wagers to make 
up. If it has $650, it can afford to drop $85 on what may look like a fool- 
hardy risk. It will never make the disastrous bet from which there is no 
recovery — at least, not before you do. The law of averages is a harsh mis- 
tress and all must fall before her. You can depend on the Apple always to 
bet everything on an ace and a deuce (it's only human), and the third 
card will occasionally be the same as one of the two. You win. The 
mighty computer is a sucker for a "sure thing." But then, so are you. 

Though this is not an Apple action game, what action there is is 
beautifully done; the cards are painstakingly detailed and realistic. Using 
real money in the Apple version would be redundant (and a no-no in 
many states). All players' pots are displayed and added to or subtracted 
from at the instant the crucial card is turned. One is also saved the fatigue 
of shuffling, math mistakes, forgetting whose turn it is, and drunken 
brawls over accusations of cheating — though it's fun anyway. Observing 
your Apple's technique can allow you to pick up a lot of valuable bad 
habits. A(

Crazy Mazey. By Ron Meadows. It's the least flashy of DataMost's 
games to date, but Crazy Mazey is definitely the most fun. 

It's original, it's challenging, it's addictive, and it's enduring — at least 
your money's-worth long and probably longer. 

Crazy Mazey presents two challenges, and, chances are, you'll choose 
to master one before you go on to the other. If so, you'll find yourself 
with two games; the first is a strategy game, the second a skill game. 

You control a car attempting to collect money from various pickup 
stations. Thieves in other cars — slightly faster than yours — wish to 
thwart your efforts. On each maze through nineteen you must contend 
with the number of thieves' cars corresponding to the maze number. You 
can't outrun four cars coming every which way, much less nineteen, and 
you have no weapons with which to eliminate the rascals, so you're left 
with pitting them against one another or tricking them into getting stuck 
where they can't harm you. 

The thieves aren't very smart. They know so well where you are that 
they move in relation to you; but you can use this against them. Con- 
ning them into crashing into one another scores points as well as lighten- 
ing your burden. 

Once you've collected all the money, you must make your way to an 
exit, which leads to the next level. High scores bring extra cars.

Determining working strategies for the multifarious mazes takes 
courage and cunning, and it's great fun. 

To master the mazes calls for slow going. Once you're there, you're 
ready for the second game. There are seven speeds ranging from very 
slow to very, very fast. Jump just three speeds faster than your strategy- 
planning snail's pace and you're into a game of skill and dexterity. It's a 
whole new challenge. And it's exciting — the kind of excitement that'll 
have you on the edge of your chair forgetting to breathe. After all, by 
now you know how to get these guys — but can you execute your knowl- 
edge? 

The graphics are colorful and finely done, although not particularly 
appealing (you won't care); the animation is very, very smooth. The 
sound is a high point. Except for fairly standard blips when you pick up 
money or when two cars crunch, the only sound is a jazzy, aknost West 
Indian sounding offbeat syncopation punctuated by subdued castanets. 
It speeds up and slows down with the game speed, but, at any speed, it's 
charming and enduring. 

If you like Crossfire, you're apt to like Crazy Mazey — it's not quite 
the masterpiece, but it's the same kind of pleasure; if you gave up on 
Crossfire because of the complex keying, don't give up on Crazy 
Mazey — it uses the usual A— Z-arrows combination. (Then, if you like 
Crazy Mazey, go back and master Crossfire, it's worth the effort.) 

The documentation implies a new experience for those who master 
level nineteen; no one here has. If you do, and learn the secret, write to 
Mazey Softalk. If you're first from your state, you won't win a thing. But 
we'll print your name and achievement here. 

Crazy Mazey is a darn good game, despite its ridiculous name. Look 
for it to soar. HCT

Combined Graphic Writer. By Joel Upchurch and George W. Baltzell. 
If interchangeable typefaces enhance the value of an IBM Selectric type- 
writer or a daisy wheel printer, then Combined Graphic Writer will make 
your dot matrix printer a more valuable component of your word proc- 
essing system. 

Theoretically, a dot matrix printer, since it doesn't have its charac- 
ters carved in stone (or, like daisy wheels, plastic, metal, or nylon), ought 
to be extremely flexible in the size and style of characters it prints. Un- 
fortunately, with most (if not all) printers, the character set is carved in 
silicon, which can be just as bad. The few options they do offer for 
changing the output — boldface, double width, or half width, for exam- 
ple — are either not controllable from software or are documented so 
cryptically that Sherlock Hobnes would find them a challenge to 
decipher. 

With this in mind. Graphic Writer was designed to unleash the po- 
tential of the dot matrix printer. What the DOS Tool Kit allows you to 
do on your screen. Graphic Writer lets you do on your printer — you can 
print out text in any of the twenty-one fonts supplied on the Graphic 
Writer disk, or any font you can create with the Animatrix program from 
the DOS Tool Kit. 

Actually, Graphic Writer is even more powerful than that, because 
you can combine up to ten different fonts in a single printout. Think of 
what that could mean in a report: one typeface for the main title, 
another face for subject headings, and still another for captions. In addi- 
tion, it has options for underlining, boldface, inverse lettering (white on 
black), large or small print, and any combination with any character set. 
All Graphic Writer commands consist of two characters: a ] (shift-M) to 
signal that a Graphic ff>/7er command follows, and a number (0 to 9) to 
indicate character font or one of seven letters for all the other style op- 
tions. They can be embedded anywhere in the material to be printed. 
Graphic Writer can give almost any kind of printout a very professional 
appearance. 

Although Graphic Writer isn't compatible with every word proces- 
sor, it is flexible enough that it can probably be used with your system. It 
is directly compatible with and documented for Apple Writer 1.0 or 1.1, 
Magic Window, and ScreenWriter II. It can also be used to format the 
printout of Basic programs, lending itself to custom report generating ap- 
plications. 

Graphic Writer has formatting programs for twelve different popular 
printers and several interface cards, all listed on the outside of the 



package. DO

<^8?J?$8. By Nhoj Dranseb. This unusual offering is a home-arcade 
game from an unhuman perspective. So how do you review a game writ- 
ten by an alien? It certainly isn't easy! The reviewer approaches the task 
with all-too-human biases. But the time has come for humanity to be 
open-minded about extraterrestrials. How do you know that the guy 
standing restlessly behind you in line to see E.T. for the third time isn't 
just homesick? 

Accepting aliens is one thing, but being one is another. For that is 
exactly what this intergalactic gamegrammer expects of his more down- 
to-earth customers. You are the spaceman. Protect yourself at all costs 
from the belligerent Earthlings. 

If you believe the cosmic propaganda in the ads for this game, the 
ahens at the top of the screen (which you control with a joystick, kind of 
reverse Space Invaders style) are on a peaceful exploratory mission. The 
Earthlings attack from below (obviously trained for violence from an early 
age by insidious video games), exhibiting a shoot-first-and-ask-ques- 
tions-later mentality. The question is: if the aliens are so pacifistic, what 
are they doing with all those explosives? Perhaps they decided Earth 
looked like an inconsequential planet, perfect for running experiments on 
the effects of seismic shocks on plate tectonics. 

Well, that isn't for us to say. Communication is the root of under- 
standing, so perhaps a look at the manual will help put us in their shoes. 
Unfortunately, the manual looks like they dipped a three-toed Denebian 
slime greeb in an inkwell and trained it to dance on blank paper. A 
spokesman for Southwestern Data Systems claims that the manual is 
translatable, but into what? 

As if that isn't bad enough, the first things you fight in the game are 
Space Shuttles. The carnage is like the finale of Moonraker. These are hu- 
mans that are dying, not ugly little monsters that are easy to hate. Clear- 
ly it is necessary to adopt a schizophrenic sense of identity in order to 
master this game.

The second level is a little better, as your alien alter ego is defending 
itself against somewhat more threatening tanks, using mines and mis- 
siles. But between levels there appear more of the greeb-scratchings they 
call instructions. What are they trying to do to us, anyway? 

As you can see, it is difficult for a human reviewer to maintain a de- 
tached objectivity here. The game begins to grow on you, once you fig- 
ure out how to read your score. It challenges the reflexes and offers 
good joystick control. You might lose yourself to a more galactic Welt- 
anshauung, develop an interest in xenobiology, and yearn for the feel of 
freefall under your feet again. Your alien equivalent of adrenaline flows 
as the humans attack in bigger and bigger waves. The rules begin to 
make sense to you, but the world you live in seems to have become for- 
eign. Don't be distressed; perhaps the alien way is the better way. Now

The Dithertizer II. By David K. Hudson, George Baltzell, and Kile 
Mullen. Dithertizing is a lot of fun, it really is. The name has probably 
misled you to believe that it's just another new weight-loss fad. Now try 
saying it three times, fast. See how fun it can be? And don't be discour- 
aged when your friends start accusing you of having a lisp. 

The Dithertizer II is a frame-grabbing video digitizer. It consists of a 
circuit board that goes into the Apple's slot seven, a video camera, con- 
necting cords that hook up the camera to the computer, and one disk 
containing all the software needed for capturing images on the monitor 
screen. And the pictures come out well. The camera has no view finder; 
the computer monitor is used for that. The game paddles are used to ad- 
just the intensity and contrast of the on-screen image; then all you do is 
press escape to freeze the frame. By hitting another key the picture is 
saved to disk for later retrieval and you're ready to grab another pose. By 
adding the proper graphics dump program (the manual explains how), 
you can print the shots you've taken. 

A digitized image is certainly interesting to look at, but it doesn't 
compare with traditional photography in resolution and clarity. Con- 
sidering the costs involved, why bother with video digitizing just for the 
fun of it? The answer is simply because the potentials inherent in the 
Dithertizer transcend the digitizing process itself. 

A creative artist could have a heyday with this thing. The printed 
compositions could be used as preliminary sketches, springboards for 
works that might encompass other media. Digitized images could be sub- 
jected to further manipulations and treatments by a dexterous hand 
wielding a good light pen. How about figuring out a way to take a series 
of frames, frozen by the Dithertizer, and animating them? Specific scenes 
could be captured to disk and, when printed out, used to create story 
boards for films, or even comic strips. Obviously these suggested appli- 
cations are only a beginning. The value of the Dithertizer only ap- 
preciates when it is coupled with a lively imagination. 

Easy to use, the Dithertizer II will show you a good time. And 
though you may be no Avedon, at least you can enjoy being a dithering 
idiot! TC

Taipan! By Art Canfil. Venture forth into the exotic and dangerous 
world of silk trading and opium smuggling on the China Seas in the late 
1800s. Travel among seven ports, buying and selling general cargo, arms, 
silk, and the always forbidden opium. Short of cash for that big trade? 
No problem — elder brother Wu will be glad to lend you the needed 
money, although this Chinese "family" charges even steeper rates than 
the loan sharks in the urban cities. Sudden storms, the dreaded tai-funs, 
can sink an overladen ship, and roving street gangs will rob you of ex- 
cess cash. The real challenge, though, lies in the only hi-res graphics se- 
quence of the game — the battle with the feared Chinese pirate fleet. You 
get to watch the effect of your shells on each of the pirate ships during the 
barrage, and have the pleasure of seeing several ships slowly sink below 
the waves. If you can evade or overcome all these obstacles and keep 
from getting your valuable opium cargo confiscated by the local author- 
ities, then it is possible to rise in the merchant ranks until you achieve the 
exalted title of Taipan, or master trader of the China Seas. (But don't for- 
get elder brother Wu— he won't forget you!) RRA

Pest Patrol. By Mark Allen. For all those legions of Threshold addicts, 
something new has finally emerged. Imagine taking Threshold out of 
space and combining it with elements of Centipede. The result is the hot 
new game from Sierra On-Line (yes, that is good old On-Line with an 
image lift). Pest Patrol. The battlefield is the jungle of your garden, and 
your only weapon against the armies of invading bugs is a can of 
pesticide. 

There are six basic types of pests, although one metamorphoses into 
another species. The fleas are the most numerable and worth the least 
points. Beetles fly down at you, and, upon reaching the ground where you 
are, slide across horizontally in the direction that their head is facing. 
Once they land, they are impossible to avoid if they are coming your 
way! Waldoes take three squirts to kill and are worth ten points. Here al- 
so are the famous hopping spiders, requiring three shots to kill and very 
difficult to avoid once they land. The spiders hop back and forth across 
the screen several times before they disappear. Careful timing will allow 
the spider to jump over the can. 

The snails are an intriguing addition to the game; they are totally im- 
mune to the spray and, unlike every other pest whose contact with the 
can destroys the can, the snails can only be killed by stomping on them 
with the can itself. Because they are immune to the spray, the snails be- 
come highly effective shields for other species of pests to hide behind as 
they descend. Worms are the ones you really have to watch out for. They 
take four shots to kill as they slowly move across the screen, but if you 
don't kill them in a certain amount of time, the worms undergo a meta- 
morphosis into killer butterfbes. Killer butterflies take five squirts and are 
worth 250 points. They are incredibly dangerous once they emerge, 
swooping and darting from all angles. 

And — as if this wctc not enough — all the pests drop any one of four 
different types of bombs on you. There are simple bombs that explode 
on impact with the ground, homing bombs that move horizontally to-

ward the can, time bombs that sit on the ground for a while before they 
explode, and the truly delightful homing time bombs which do every- 
thing all at once. 

The game has forty levels of difficulty, with the first twenty-nine be- 
ing selectable with the plus key. Levels thirty to thirty-nine can only be 
reached by skillful playing and luck. One very exciting new feature of this 
game is that it contains a practice mode. How many times have you been 
really frustrated trying to get down the pattern skills needed to survive 
some high level? You've had to replay the game up to that level, hoping 
that you still have a few men left and usually getting wiped out in a few 
moments. Then you have to replay the entire game to get back up there. 

Pest Patrol simplifies your life! In the practice mode you have sev- 
enty-seven cans and can still play any level up to level twenty-nine for as 
long as you like until you have developed sufficient mastery of that level 
to go back to the regular game mode. If Threshold had had this inno- 
vative idea, many more people would have enjoyed the artistry of the dif- 
ferent aliens— spinning Volkswagens, swooping killer seagulls, and the 
infamous marching letters— on the higher levels. While the arcade freak 
will certainly like the intense challenge of the higher levels, the ordinary 
player is more likely to enjoy the cleverness of the graphics and the sur- 
prises of each level. It is refreshing to see an author cater to both worlds.

Statistics With Daisy. By Kevin C. Killion. This is a tool for special- 
ists — people who work with statistical data analysis for such arcane pur- 
poses as the modeling and prediction of various business and scientific 
processes. Daisy will not teach you how (or when) to use the various 
techniques of statistical analysis; but if you know those techniques al- 
ready, Daisy can make it easy to apply them. 

Daisy (data analysis, interactive stafistics) works with a rectangular 
array of numbers: each row represents a case being studied, and each col- 
umn represents one of the points being observed on each case. Daisy's 
pet trick is generating new columns, based on relationships among 
the old. 

You can think of Daisy as a calculator or number-crunching system 
with an extra dimension: she operates on whole columns, not just indi- 
vidual numbers. Where a calculator would multiply a worker's pay rate 
by his hours worked to get his paycheck, Daisy will generate a whole col- 
umn of paycheck values by applying the same process to each row in the 
array. 

And she can do much more than simple arithmetic operations. She 
can do comparisons or range checks, mathematical transforms like log 
and inverse, time-series transforms, and standardization (producing a 
column with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1); fill a column with 
random numbers; rank the rows (or sort the entire table) on a chosen col- 
umn; and so on. 

That's the basic, nonspecialist stuff: then Daisy begins to get sophis- 
ticated. She also offers correlations and covariances, Spearman and Ken- 
dall rank correlations, ten modes of hypothesis testing, and several fla- 
vors of regression and regression tesUng. She can also draw sequence and 
scatter plots (some with choice of log, semilog, or normal axes), histo- 
grams, and even fitted curves. The drawings can be saved on disk and 
(depending on your printer) printed. 

Speaking of disks, the data in all those rows and columns can, of 
course, be saved to and loaded from disk. Also, a disk file can be selec- 
tively overlaid onto a file in memory, overwriting part of it to merge 
the two. 

There's more, but why go on? It should be clear by now that Daisy 
has enough capabilities to be worth checking out — if you need those 
kinds of capabilities. 

The best thing about Daisy is that she's very friendly to strangers and 
easy to get to know. If you're not a statistics person, she may seem exotic, 
but she'll try to make you understand. There's not only a help file which 
lists the various commands (it reminds you about it if you gooO but also 
a file that gives you a definition of each command. The manual is clear, 
simple, and organized more for "read through and learn" than for "look 
up and review." It's rather big for that; but that's a minor point. 

All in all, Daisy is a very attractive and capable program, and if you 
have a use for her abilities, you should certainly meet her. IR

Starship Commander. By Oilman Louie. Slarship Commander has the 
makings of a brilliant simulation. Drawback: it is programmed in Ap- 
plesoft. Faster than light, it's not. 

The game turn proceeds as follows. The first display you get is la- 
beled motion detector, and it shows the movements of your ship and the 
one to three enemy ships you are expected to beat in combat. This is fol- 
lowed by about a minute of disk access and data calculations. Then the 
command mode menu is displayed. 

Starship Commander' s method of accepting commands is brilliant in 
its simplicity and ease of use. Next to each option on the main menu and 
all of the submenus is a box. The paddle controls the position of a blink- 
ing arrow. When the arrow is next to the option you want, simply push 
the paddle button. Any time you have to input a range of numbers, such 
as speed, course, or degree of evasive action, you use the paddle to tell it 
to increase or deaease the number, and push the button when the num- 
ber is what you want. This can take some dme to get right, but you nev- 
er have to touch the keyboard. 

The options of command mode are communication, defense, engi- 
neering, life support, navigation, science, weapons, end of game, and end 
of turn. Every station on the ship is represented by a hi-res control board 
which has a graphics display and all the available options grouped under 
convenient headings like status and action. It is not necessary to go 
through every option on each turn. For instance, communications only 
gives three options: bluff, surrender, and ask for surrender, to be used 
only in appropriate situafions. To Captain Kirk fans, the bluff will be fa- 
miliar as the Corbomite maneuver. When you are in deep trouble, you 
radio headquarters and say you are going to blow yourself up. The 
enemy ships back off to a safe distance and you move out as fast as pos- 
sible. This does not work except in a situation where the enemy would 
believe that you would actually self-destruct. Asking for surrender usual- 
ly elicits the mocking response, "You must be joking." 

The other options, of course, relate to various subsystems of your 
ship. Some of them offer control, others just monitor power levels or 
enemy status. All power allocation to the engines, weapons, and shields 
is through engineering. Firing weapons and changing course and speed 
are accomplished through the weapons and navigation stations, respec- 
tively. Note that you are only giving orders here. Weapons firing is all 
done simultaneously when you select the end-of-tum option. Course 
changes actually take place at the beginning of the next turn, displayed 
on the motion detector. 

As captain of the USS Ranger, you have control over every aspect of 
life aboard ship. That means every aspect, right down to individual crew 
assignments. This is the life-support option. At each of four major work 
stations there are three crews to assign. At any time, one crew must 
be on duty, one on standby, and one asleep. A readout will tell you the 
relative efficiencies of the crews. If an individual in the crew is injured or 
killed, it is up to you to replace him. 

With all those options, such carefully done graphics, and such an 
easy way of entering commands, you would think that Starship Com- 
mander must be a cut above the ordinary space battle game. If you really 
want to control all those things, it is. Though the name of the game is

ficers of the ship. DD

Crisis Mountain. By David Schroeder. Crisis Mountain is a slow starter 
that builds fast and hooks you forever. You find yourself in a cutaway 
view of a cavernous mountain, in which are interred a couple of rapidly 
ticking nuclear devices. The mountain is basically unstable and has a 
plentiful supply of boulders constantly rumbling through its narrow pas- 
sageways to prove it. There are also a few bubbling magma pits waiting 
to catch you should you miss your jump over a yawning chasm in your 
frantic efforts to get to the bombs and disarm them. It's a nice place to 
visit. . . . 

This is one where you have to read the documentation, at least a lit- 
tle, to get the most out of the game or to play it very long. Learning how 
to jump, when a boulder is coming your way, how to crawl through the 



OCTOBER 1982 



151 



tight spots, and, especially, how to dig out the bombs, is what the game is 
about. You generally don't live long enough to find out through trial and 
error. Crisis Mountain succeeds in generating real suspense and provides 
a lot of interactive Perils of Pauline climaxes — though they generally 
have unhappy endings, at least at first. 

Play levels alternate between more intricate cavern layouts and the 
layout from a previous level with more bombs and rolling boulders that 
become bigger, faster, and meaner. (Never will you have appreciated the 
escape key more.) Boulders, should you lack the agility and good man- 
ners to get out of their way, only cause mild, temporary disablement. Af- 
ter making several such contacts, however, you must shuffle off this 
mortal coil, which is performed in a neat little arcade-style routine. (Re- 
member Boot HUH) 

After deactivating the bombs, you get a bonus run, during which 
your unused time on the clock adds ten points to your score for each ad- 
ditional second you remain alive. Now comes Miller time. You get to 
draw a deep breath, have a look around your interesting surroundings, 
and pick up a couple of the nifty sparkly and whirly things that you 
didn't have time for previously and which will add additional hundreds 
of points to your score. 

Fat chance. 

Such delusions of glory and easy living will net you a bonus run of 
about five seconds. If you so much as get tagged on the ankle by a flying 
pebble, it's all over. If you're going for a high score, your best bet is to 
crawl under a ledge where the boulders can't get you and you're not like- 
ly to fall into a lava pit, and just let the numbers accrue in an orderly 
fashion until your time is up for that level. You are at the mercy of the 
mighty forces of Mother Nature, you craven, sniveling wimp. 

If you liked Apple Panic, have fond memories of the old Mousetrap 
game of many years ago, or loved the opening sequence from Raiders of 
the Lost Ark (that got 'em), this game will push your buttons. 

Speaking of which: Crisis Mountain does not appear to like joy- 
sticks. It can be played with them, but it is happiest when button 0 and 
button 1 are each on their respective paddles. A(

Guadalcanal Campaign. By Gary Grigsby. Strategic Simulations has 
come a long way since Computer Bismarck. That game, the company's 
first, was almost entirely concerned with naval search and combat. The 
German side had little more than a single battleship. And the game 
was slow. 

Guadalcanal Campaign is also a naval game, and it is based on simi- 
lar principles of movement and combat. Like Computer Bismarck, it can 
be played solitaire. But it is a much broader game — each side controls 
land, sea, and air forces, and must worry about supply and transport as 
well as combat. Guadalcanal offers a better-balanced conflict — the Japa- 
nese and the Americans both have tremendous resources. Both are 
stretched thin, fighting far from home in the vast, empty expanse of the 
Pacific. Both have only an incomplete idea of what the other side is do- 
ing. And, for all their heroics, both are dependent on a very slender 
trickle of reinforcements. 

Until the final five-inch shell goes home, this game will keep a player 
sitting on the edge of his seat, his head full of anxious questions: When 
does the Tokyo Express make its next run? Do I have enough Wildcats to 
protect my carriers? Where the devil are his submarines? Though no ar- 
cade game, Guadalcanal Campaign is both fast and exciting. 

There are five scenarios of varying lengths included and a campaign 
game that runs about three hundred turns. Since the game can be saved 
on disk, you can take the campaign in small bites over the course of a 
month. There are four levels of difficulty for solitaire play, and most peo- 
ple will find the enemy plenty dangerous even at the first level. 

Grigsby has simplified things to make it easy for the players to con- 
trol all of their diverse forces. For example, you have every ship that 
fought in the battle, but you don't have to maneuver them individually. 
Instead, ships are assigned to task forces, each with a mission — combat, 
transport, or bombardment — and task forces are moved by single key- 
strokes. Land forces are recorded simply as numbers of troops (for com- 
bat) or numbers of companies (for transport). Aircraft appear as num- 
bers of each type available at each base or carrier. Day by day, they are 



assigned to strike, counterstrike, search, patrol, or transfer. Float planes, 
like the Catalinas, are factored into the game abstractly. 

Of course, not all of this simplification is for the good. The cruiser 
Chicago, which attacked and pursued the Japanese in the battle of Savo 
Island, can't do it in the game because its mission is bombardment. 
"Mad Jack" Cram, who blew up a transport in a dangerous daylight tor- 
pedo run, has no combat role in the game because his plane was a Cata- 
lina. However, the dread surprises of combat have not been ignored. The 
player is often put in the position of the sailor who spots torpedo wakes 
heading for his ship, or the Marine who sweats and swears in his dugout 
while the Japanese pound Henderson Field. But the player wears the 
admiral's shoes as well, deciding whether to trade planes for ships, or 
ships for time. 

How accurate is Guadalcanal CampaigrP. In its details, only so-so. 
The navy's patrol torpedo boats, which made things "exceptionally dif- 
ficult" for the Japanese historically, just aren't there. The P-400 "Klunk- 
ers" of the Cactus Air Force have also vanished, along with other types 
of aircraft. There is no mention of the Australian coast watchers, whose 
secret radios gave warning of many a Japanese attack. On the other 
hand, the game re-creates the drama of the campaign very well. The 
night attacks, the deadly peekaboo of the naval forces, the unquench- 
able hunger of Ironbottom Sound — all have their place in the game as in 
history. Considering the limitations inherent in a game like this, the 
author has done a remarkably good job. If you like strategy games, give 
it a try. Fl

the wise detective in 
this classic adventure 
game? 




The mention of mystery brings up images of huge old Victorian houses, trap 
doors, narrow escapes and — most of all — MURDER!!! 
Over two years ago, a tantalizing adventure was released that combined all of 
these images and made them hotter through the use of HI-RES GRAPHICS. 
Now, that adventure has been made bigger because the original authors and 
Bob Davis (creator of ULYSSES and the GOLDEN FLEECE) haveadded new 
puzzles and pleasures to that game, made better through the use of 21 color 
Hi-Res Graphics to really make the adventure come to life. What treasure

The example given is one of $2,000 per year being put into an IRA ac- 
count for thirty years at a 12 percent rate of return with a marginal tax 
rate of 40 percent, filing jointly with no early withdrawal. In the exam- 
ple, the total accumulated would be $540,585, while the total on the non- 
IRA after taxes would be $125,976 on the same money. Now that is cer- 
tainly putting your money to work for you! Each person's particular

U-Boat Command. By Charles J. Fleishman. If you're tired of killing 
aliens in space; if you've had it with shooting unidentifiable insects; and if 
eating things while jaunting through a maze is getting old, then come 
back to reality and some good old earthbound destruction. U-Boat 
Command is a game that will take you back to those days of old and put 
you on the bridge of a submarine at sea. 
Your mission: to sink the aircraft carrier. 

Not exactly an arcade game, U-Boat is not a complete strategy game 
either where you can think for a few minutes and make a decision. It's a 
combination of the two. 

You have two viewpoints in this game. The periscope view allows 
you to see what's going on in the air and on the surface. While using this 
view, you can fire torpedoes at the vessels and use your main deck guns 
against aircraft. The map view shows you where you are in relation to is- 
lands, the mainland, and the aircraft carrier you are out to destroy. 

Also on your screen are various gauges indicating your boat's status. 
Your sonar screen will alert you to vessels in your area, though they ap- 
pear just as clearly in your periscope. A compass tells you your direc- 
tion; and depth, air, and fuel supply indicators are also present. Key- 
board input maneuvers you around the seas and joystick or a set of pad- 
dles controls your guns.

As you sail about, unidentified vessels appear on the horizon. The 
best strategy is to approach with caution and hope you can identify them 
before they fire upon you. Once they're identified (either they will shoot 
at you or their enemy/friendly status will appear on the control con- 
sole), you have several options. If it is a submarine supply boat, you will 
be replenished with torpedoes, fuel, or men. 

If it's an enemy ship, you can either fire a torpedo or take a dive and 
wait for them to pass by. But choosing the latter option makes you vul- 
nerable to depth charges, and they never miss. It's not hard to hit them 
with torpedoes, it's just costly — you start out with nine and seldom have 
more than that. 

Also harassing you on the way to the aircraft carrier are (under- 
standably) aircraft. Appearing as small dots in the distance at first, they 
approach in a lifehke manner, becoming more definite visually as they 
get closer. They'll bomb you if you let them, but don't you let them — 
downing them is a breeze. You're given unlimited gunning ammunition. 

The object of U-Boat is to sink the enemy aircraft carrier. It's worth 
one thousand points, almost ten times more than any other vessel, but 
sinking it is no harder than sinking the others, requiring only one torpe- 
do to send it to the bottom. But once you do that, you don't get to sail 
home to ensconce yourself in glory or any other hero's reception. You 
must stick around and fight other smaller vessels until you are sunk, run 
aground, or until time expires. (Sort of like wallowing through the Ap- 
plesoft Tutorial after you've mastered machine language). 

At first there seems to be something wrong with this game. No U- 
boat commander in his right mind would go one-on-one with aircraft, 
aircraft carriers, or destroyers. Even if he did, the chances of winning are 
marginal at best. And sinking an entire aircraft carrier with just one tor- 
pedo? C'mon, let's be real. Well, U-Boat is not meant to be a historic 
simulation in any respect (you even get to name your own countries); it's 
all in fun and should be taken that way. 

Sound effects in U-Boat are deliciously realistic. The sonar sounds 
like a sonar, and when you get hit you can hear the steam leaking from 
pipes as you scream orders to the torpedo room. If the sound bothers 
others in the room, the period key toggles on and off. Don't use it. U- 
Boat plays much better with it on. Better to tell those peeved at your dis- 
courteousness just to leave the room. 

One of U-Boat's annoying features is also one of its most realistic. As 
your crewmen become casualties and their number diminishes, the 
execution speed of your commands slows down. Why? Fewer men 
means more work per man. Obviously twenty men's work will be done 
faster by twenty men than by ten. 

Typical playing time is long enough not to discourage novice players 
and short enough to get in several rounds at one sitting. The game fea- 
tures four levels of play to provide for beginners and experienced play- 
ers; each gives you a choice to add aircraft or not. If you enjoy exercising 
your reflexes, making real-time decisions, and implementing effective 
strategies, U-Boat Command will hook you. HTV

The Physical Exam. The most time-intensive everyday job in the typical 
medical office is filling out medical examination reports. Who wants re- 
ports? Insurance companies, prospective employers, various govern- 
ments, and, of course, the physicians themselves. Reports are often three 
or four pages each, and patients usually wish to take the physical exam 
reports with them to the appropriate institution. And none of this can oc- 
cur until the doctor has noted the state of health or disease in many areas 
of the body. 

Physical Exam solves these problems ingeniously and simply. Initial- 
ly, each of the body parts relevant in the practice must be input, along 
with the definition of what is normal and usual for each one. This infor- 
mation is stored permanently, the definitions serving as defaults. 

The doctor examining a patient notes any variances from normal un- 
der the appropriate headings in the program; these findings replace the 
default descriptions for this patient. At this point, the doctor may enter a 
summary diagnosis. 

Assuming the patient's name and personal data have been input as a 
matter of course, the program is ready to print out multiple copies of the 
necessary reports, ready for the doctor to sign.

After printing, the system erases all information entered for the pa- 
tient and resets itself to the default information. There is no provision to 
retain the individual patient's information in a disk file. 

The program comes with a brief, well-written instruction manual.

Succession. By Chris Eisnaugle. Just as advances in Chatty Cathy tech- 
nology made a talking dolly into a talking, crying, wetting, blushing dol- 
ly, so Apple game programming know-how has now produced an eating 
game in which you can throw up. 

That's only one of the new features in this new version of the most 
popular of computer games. Your food does not consist of anonymous 
dots; the objects of your hunger are manifestly alive. Also, they bear 
numbered placards informing you of the order in which they are to be 
consumed. Should you devour one out of order, you are immediately 
seized with the urge to regurge, and you must start all over again. Before 
that happens, your time may run out and you'll have to go back to the 
beginning. Before that happens, the guardian of the maze may introduce 
you to his uvula, in which case you don't have to start all over again; one 
of your remaining munchers (three to start) comes to the fore to take up 
where the last one left off. 

Does this make it hard enough? Need you ask? The delectables 
scamper about in cheerful randomness and are hard to catch, let alone in 
numerical order. The guard, though there is only one, almost always 
knows where you are and is indestructible. Escape hatches at the top, 
bottom, and sides of the maze, though numerous, are not the escape 
hatches we have come to know and love. Entering one will not safely de- 
posit you through the opposite doorway, but will materialize you at 
some random location in the maze. The maze itself is more intricate than 
usual, cutting down on mobility no matter how nimble your fingers get 
(keyboard only). It also has a lot of randomly appearing doors that in- 
variably disappear when there's something nasty on the other side and 
slam in your face when something nasty is right behind you. There are 
four levels, each one faster than the one before and each with an extra 
little creature to catch; up to eight in all. 

It does take getting used to and it can be done. For the real eat-'em- 
up game freaks, the primary pleasures of the genre have always been the 
random race to gobble dots in whatever pattern was most expedient at 
the time, then rising up to slay one's persecutors at the propitious mo- 
ment. Succession does not do that. Nor does the construction of the 
game allow the crucial submersion into the Alpha state, when your con- 
sciousness exists only between the first and second knuckles of your fin- 
gers. You must watch the numbers, you cannot trust your environment 
to act in any predictable manner, and you must constantly be on the 
defensive. 

For these reasons, it probably is not destined to become a classic. It 
is, however, different. While its differences may alienate the traditional 
audience for the eat-'em-ups, they are also likely to attract a new one — 
not to mention its obvious potential for early education numbers drill. If 
used as such, there would certainly be a veritable explosion of previously 
slow-learning children who would suddenly be able to count to eight.

Tunnel Terror. By Eric Popejoy. Anyone who hung out in vacant lots as 
a kid will remember the popular game King of the Mountain. You stood 
atop a mound while the others tried to dethrone you by pushing, rolling, 
kicking, or throwing you down the hill; whoever succeeded became the 
next king. The contest, bke so many other childhood games, ended when 
it got too dark to play, or when moms started calling the kids in for 
dinner. 

If any game simulates this at all, it's Tunnel Terror. 

As you cruise around the top ledge of the tunnel, which looks more 
like a polygonal pie, Walker-Carriers try to clamber up the insides to face 
you on equal ground. The most sensible thing to do is shoot them down 
before they get to that point, £md that's exactly what you do. The only 
problem is that when you hit them, you're not sure if you've really hit 
them, because they blink on and off while climbing. Once they reach the 
top, real strategy is needed. 

Though moving around the tunnel takes you in a complete circle. 



you are only allowed two full trips around before you are forced to circle 
in the other direction. Once the Walker-Carriers reach the top — and they 
will — they turn into Walkers and will try to destroy you. One touch from 
the Walkers is all it takes to melt you down to size. However, it's no great 
task to get them before they get you. Just bear down on the rapid fire 
button and mow them down. 

Each level has more walls than the one before, providing more ave- 
nues of ascent for the W-Cs, and at the higher levels. Crazies appear. 
They are invulnerable to your energy blasts, so it gets to be a game of cat 
and mouse as you try to outrun them until they either catch you or tuck- 
er out and fall back down. 

For those who have never experienced Tempest, this game may be 
somewhat interesting. There are no real aliens to kill in the sense we're fa- 
miliar with. All you really see are nondescript shapes zooming up the 
tunnel toward you. Who are these guys? They have no faces, no ap- 
pendages; they don't even look dangerous. All the same, it's zap or be 
zapped. 

Tunnel features sixty-one levels of play, each just a bit more challeng- 
ing than the preceding one. One nice feature of this game is that it gives 
you the option to start at higher levels if lower ones prove to be too sim- 
ple. When you first boot the game, you are only allowed to start as high 
as level five. But as you progress to higher levels, you can start new 
games as high as those levels. 

The game is playable with either keyboard or paddles, and plays 
equally well with both. For glory hounds, four persons can play the game 
at once; for bigger glory hounds, Tunnel saves high scores of the day to 
memory. Unfortunately, once the game is terminated, so is your score. 

As the author's premier game for Adventure International, Tunnel 
provides a challenge to both the novice and experienced player, allowing 
them to play side by side with equal time at the controls. flTV

under the Apple Pascal operating system and are primarily directed at 
handling text files. Each tool is executed from the Pascal command mode 
and the operation is smoothly guided by meaningful prompts. 

The first tool, called Xref, generates a cross-reference listing of any 
Pascal program, showing each identifier that is used in the program fol- 
lowed by the line numbers on which it appears. 

The next tool is called Diff. It examines two text files and then re- 
ports the differences between them. This tool is ideal for determining the 
differences between versions of a given program under development. It 
can also be used to compare the text output from various versions of a 
program to see what changes, if any, resulted from modifications in the 
program. 

Diff prompts for an output file (defaults to console. ) and then asks 
for pairs of input files to be compared. The . text suffix is again optional- 
ly supplied by Diff. Several other options are also supported, such as de- 
termining whether leading blanks should be significant during com- 
parisons. 

Page is a general-purpose pagination utility that simplifies the for- 
matting of text output and its transmission to a printer. A specific ver- 
sion of the Page utility, containing user-specifiai defaults for the op- 
tions, can be created using files contained on the Pascal Tools I disk. 

The next two utilities. Cat and Split, allow the concatenation and 
splitting of several text files to or from one larger file. The Split utility will 
most likely be used on files that are too big to fit into the Pascal editor. 

Finally, there are two datafile-textfile conversion programs: Make- 
text and Makedata. These tools may prove helpful in transporting files 
between the Apple Pascal environment and other operating systems. An- 
other possible use would be as an alternative to Pascal's extremely slow 
I/O with text files. Programs could use the faster block I/O operations 
using a straightforward file representation. To use such a file with the 
Pascal editor, you have only to run it through Maketext to convert it 
back to a regular text file. Conversely, files created with the editor can be 
converted to the data format for quick access by programs. 

The documentation is precise and complete; some knowledge of the 
Pascal operating system is assumed. Anyone with a serious involvement 
in Apple Pascal will find Pascal Tools I a valuable aid. ill

(12333 Saratoga Sunnyvale Road, Saratoga, CA 95070; 408-446-2013). $75. 

Pascal Tools II. Like Pascal Tools I, this is a collection of utilities for 
the serious Pascal programmer. While Tools I deals mainly with text files, 
these six utilities concentrate on handling the binary data in any type file. 

The first utihty in Tools II is called Patch. This is a disk file editing 
program similar to the "disk zap" variety used with DOS. Any disk 
block can be displayed, edited, and rewritten at will. In fact, it is not even 
necessary to know the actual block numbers — you can edit according to 
file name. A block is displayed on the screen in both hexadecimal and 
ASCII, simultaneously. The display automatically configures itself to ei- 
ther forty or eighty columns according to your system. The information 
provided by Patch can also be sent to your printer for a hard copy of the 
hex dumps. The editing display shows either one-half or one-quarter of 
the block at a time, depending on your screen size. A cursor can be 
quickly positioned anywhere within the block to make changes in the hex 
data and a helpful indicator reminds you when you've made changes to 
the block. 

The next utility, Dumpcode, is a p-code disassembler. This program 
takes a Pascal (or Fortran) code file and displays it in symbolic form us- 
ing the p-machine op-codes as described in the Apple Pascal Operating 
System Manual. Dumpcode also displays various information about the 
segment and procedure structure of the code file, and information used 
by the linker in processing compilation units. All of this may be mean- 
ingful to only the advanced programmer, but it can provide a wealth of 
details about a program which would otherwise be hidden from the user. 

The General-Purpose Pattern Grabber and Rq)lacanent Utility, or 
GREP for short, performs several text editing functions on text files. 
Like the Pascal Editor, GREP accepts a search pattern and, optionally, a 
replacement string of characters. The input file is then scanned for all oc- 
currences of the specified string and each successful match is dis- 
played on the screen. If a replacement string is specified, an entire new 
file with replacements is created. 



The real power of GREP, however, is that it allows multiple search 
patterns (and corresponding replacement strings) to be entered as a com- 
plete list. Thus several search (and replace) operations can be performed 
on a single file simultaneously. 

Cmp is a binary file-compare similar to the Diff utility in Pascal 
Tools I. This program, however, operates on all files (code, text, or data) 
and compares them on a byte-by-byte basis. Once a difference is detect- 
ed, the program makes no attempt to resynchronize matching bytes. 
Therefore, when comparing text files, the Diff program should be used. 

The Filegen utility is used to create nonstandard files such as text files 
with embedded, nonprintable (control) characters. 

The final utility in Tools II is a keyboard character code display 
called Echo. This is a short program which simply indicates the corre- 
sponding character code for each key that is pressed on the keyboard. 
This can vary from system to system depending upon your console de- 
vice (Apple keyboard, eighty-column board, external keyboard, and so 
on) and also because of various software patches. Knowledge of the ex- 
act key codes is useful in preparing input files for the Filegen utility. 

like its predecessor, Pascal Tools II is very professional and well writ- 
ten, though it is definitely for the more advanced Pascal programmer. 
Some technical information on the inner workings of the Pascal operat- 
ing system and compiler would have been useful, although this informa- 
tion could probably fill an entire book by itself. Jfl

Tharolian Tunnels. By Rod Nelsen. The three difficulty levels of Tharo- 
lian Tunnels — Pilot, Captain, and Commander — all seem much the 
same: extremely difficult. 

The play of the game also remains constant: you must ( 1) get past the 
planetary defenses, (2) navigate the title tunnels, (3) get past the internal 
planetary defenses, (4) navigate through a bank of lasers, and (5) land at 
the bottom. Initially, you are faced with two rows of alien ships descend- 
ing inexorably toward you in your traditional position at the bottom of

the screen. Planetside, there are also zipping drone torpedoes (injurious) 
and plummeting fireballs (fatal) to enliven the proceedings. Your slow- 
moving ship fires slow-moving bullets at measured intervals. The speed 
of your foes, in true arcade fashion, increases as their numbers decrease. 
By the time there is just one left, screaming down the screen like a luna- 
tic typewriter carriage return while you wallow in your trough like a 
wounded garbage scow, your only strategy is to stay in one place and 
hold down the fire button. (It's called "luck.") 

This gamut run, you are free to wend your way through the miles and 
miles of tunnels down to the heart of the planet (Tharolia, center world 
of the Metal Universe, home of the robot termites), squeaking through 
narrow passages or using up energy to blast out expensive larger ones, 
depending on your attitude toward fuel conservation. Once refueled at a 
handy halfway refueling station, you continue your tortuous descent 
through even narrower tunnels, passing throu^ some rather listless 
drone torpedo fire and blasting some noncombatants who appear to 
have wandered into your tunnel and are pretty much minding their own 
business, but with whom, nevertheless, it would be inadvisable to col- 
lide. The White Rabbit does not appear. 

That is the general idea. It takes considerable patience to get past the 
fighter phalanx in the first part; getting past the laser bank at the end . . . 
well, good luck. Wearing you down by degrees, this game seems to have 
perfected the Communist brainwashing techniques pioneered in the 
Korean War. The tunnels themselves are claustrophobia-inducing; the 
play alternates between extreme tension and concentration and sedate 
passages in which nothing much happens. After a while, you may start 
throwing yourself into tunnel walls (game over), ramming alien fighters 
(game over), and sitting under fireballs (game over). You leave ex- 
hausted. You're lucky to leave. A(

Multiploy By Paul Coletta. Here is an educational game that introduces 
the excitement of an arcade game into the learning and practicing of 
arithmetic skills, as well as reading and typing. As you begin, a single 
space saiioer with a math problem inside descends from the top of the 
screen. Let it get too low and it will zap you with its laser. Type the cor- 
rect answer to the math problem and your command post will zap it with 
lots of color pyrotechnics. 

But don't get distracted. The saucers keep coming, up to four on the 
screen at one time, each carrying its own math problem. The speed of the 
saucers and the complexity of the problems can be set separately. There 
are up to six levels of difficulty based on speed and complexity, along 
with a choice of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The 
levels of difficulty span the second through fourth grades and offer a val- 
uable refresher for fifth-graders and above. SC

Mars Cars. By David Husch. A wonderful solution to the frustration of 
maze games is being able to burn them down as you go from level to 
level — and get points for it. Mars Cars has this fiery new feature, as does 
Firebug and Mine Sweep, one of the games in Laf Pak. Snap, crackle, 
pop! The burn-'em-up games have arrived. 

Each of the sixteen mazes in Mars Cars is striped in different pat- 
terns. The object is to drive your car up and down the striijes trying to 
capture barbells from the four comers. You must have all four before 
you can go to the next level. The space between the stripes is inhabited by 
various deadly creatures who zig-zag and bounce about, spoiling your 
keen sense of geometric destruction. As you travel, you bum up stripes 
for points and they crackle like kindling on a crisp fall day. 

The levels of the game don't get progressively harder as you ascend 
like most games do. Some are excellent for making lots of bum-points if 
you like high scores; others are better for just grabbing the barbells and 
running if you're ambitious. Watch out, though; the Martians get smart- 
er and seem to be able to track you as you climb higher in the game. Oc- 
casionally a rampaging Martian will burst through the walls at you and 
crash you out of a turn (you have four tries at a level). There ought to be 
a law! 

Mars Cars is enjoyable home-arcade fun — like the kind you had 
when you rode the bumper cars at the carnival when you were a kid — 



combined with the crackling of a roaring good fire. tIF

Ergono I. Rarely does any piece of computer furniture generate more 
than a passing glance, much less exude any aesthetic appeal. At the re- 
cent Applefest show in Boston, however, one of the talks of the show was 
the new computer stand from Sensible Software. It derives its name from 
the term ergonomics, which is the study of the use of human energy to 
accomplish tasks in the most efficient manner, more commonly referred 
to as human engineering. 

The oak wood grain and the roll-top dust cover do lend an aura of 
days gone by, but the attention to the user's needs is up-to-the-minute. 
Under the Apple is a sliding tray. Thus, the Apple can be rolled out to 
have its cards changed or its joystick replaced by paddles. What a differ- 
ence from the other models available, where the entire superstructure has 
to be removed to get inside the Apple! To the left of the disk drive slots 
sits the other very nice feature — a separate power supply with four 
grounded outlets. One of these outlets is always "hot," while the other 
three are controlled by two separate lighted switches. Thus, the Achilles' 
heel of the Apple, its on-off switch, can be circumvented. As an added 
bonus, circuit breakers and surge suppressors are built in. These are cer- 
tainly the surroundings an Apple deserves in the executive suite or in the 
professional office. RRA

Neptune. By Nasir Gebelli . . . Jerry Mathers as the Beaver. 
"Hey, Beaver, what are you doing?" 

"Oh, hi, Wally. I'm playing this new game me and Whitey saw down 
at the computer store. It's called Neptune. The man at the store said it 
was supposed to be pretty good." 

"Golly, Beav, you don't just go out and buy something because the 
man says it's pretty good. You gotta try it out; you know, kinda like 
basketball tryouts at Medfield High. Heck, even Lumpy can go around 
saying he's pretty good at point guard." 

"Well, it is a neat game. You have this submarine ship, sort of like 
Captain Nemo's, and you go through the water and try to shoot and 
bomb these underwater ahens. But the trouble is some of them pop up 
and down, which makes them harder to hit, and some of them just sit 
there. Those are the ones you have to drop bombs on." 

"What's so hard about that?" 

"Boy, Wally, you think just because you got a date with Mary Ellen 
Rogers Friday night that you can do anything. Watch. Okay, see those 
rocketlike things? Those are Neptunians. They'll shoot up and down 
when you don't expect it. And those bouncy things on the bottom? 
Those are the Jellyfish. You have to bomb those, but it's kinda rough 
with the Neptunians sitting guard next to them." 

"That's a cinch. Here, let me try it. Hey, why aren't my bombs drop- 
ping on the Jellyfish?" 

"I tried to tell you about that. You're limited to only twenty bombs. 
Kinda like the way Larry Mondello limits himself to twenty apples a day. 
Anyway, next you gotta get through the Pupfish, and they never stop 
moving." 

"Hey, look at that. Beaver! You mean after I sweat through those 
creepy underwater guys, that I have to dodge torpedoes too?" 

'Those aren't torpedoes, they're Octonians. They're a breeze; just 
don't get too close to the top or bottom. Those bubbles are deadly. 
What's rotten is that once you get through this level, you gotta make a 
choice in this fork in the road. If you make the wrong choice, you end up 
getting mashed. Kinda like when Lumpy took his dad's car to the 
prom." 

"Heck, Beav, how am I supposed to know which way to go?" 

"Phil, the man at the store, said that if you shoot as little as possible 
at the Neptunians, Jellyfish, and Octonians, there will be something to 
show you which way to go, but if you just shoot like crazy, it's all luck." 

Door opens. 

"Hey, Sam, what's shaking? Heh, heh, heh. Are we gonna go down 
to the malt shop and score with the chicks, or are you gonna hang 
around here with the squirt all day?" 

"Aw, knock it off, Eddie. Beav and I are playing Gebelli's Neptune.

Look, he's already at the refueling stage." 

"Hey, squirt, that's a pretty jazzy rhythm the game plays when you're 
at the filling pumps. Let me try this game — uh, not that I'm normally in- 
to these kiddies' things. What's this? I'm swimming upside down?" 

"Boy, are you in for it now, Eddie. You busted the game!" 

"No, he didn't, Wally. The next time around you go through the 
whole thing, and everything's upside down. And later on, there's sharks 
and stuff, but they're almost impossible to kill. And after that. . . ." 

"Aw, c'mon, Sam. This stuff is for kids." 

"Golly, Eddie, you don't gotta get sore about it." 

"Yeah, you didn't have to break the pins off of Beaver's joystick. 
Now he won't be able to play anymore." 

"It's okay. I can also play Neptune from the keyboard, but it's a little 
harder." 

"Let's go to the malt shop, Wally. The kid's beginning to sound like a 
software review." 

The boys leave Beaver and enter the hall. 

"But I was just down at the malt shop today with Mary Ellen 
Rogers." 

"Okay, let's go down to the computer store and see if there are any 
more Neptunes left. I just didn't want the punk to know I actually think 
the game's pretty good. I mean, did you see how smooth the animation 
was? And the color! And how 'bout the way those smiling Jellyfish 
bounce up and down with their little bow ties on, and those purple 
sharks. . . ." 

"Boy, Eddie, you sure are something else. Now you sound like a 
commercial." 

"Hello, boys. Off to the malt shop?" 

"Oh, good afternoon, Mrs. Cleaver. That's a very becoming house- 
coat you have on. Wallace and I are going to the computer store to 
broaden our knowledge on the latest in technology." 

"How nice, Eddie. You be sure to be back for dinner, Wally." 

Boys exit. 

"What was that all about, June?" 

"Ward, I'm worried about the Beaver. He's so tied to that Neptune 
game from Gebelli that he doesn't get into as much trouble as he did in 
the old days. I just hope our series doesn't get cancelled." tITV

Retirement Planner. By William L. Hamilton. Many people these days 
are trying to plan far in advance of their retirement and finding the un- 
dertaking quite complex and confusing. This simple forecasting model 
from the government think tank, ABT, will help clear some of the fog 
away for the average person. Via a step- through menu, a wide range of 
variables are input such as your current age, earning level, total current 
assets, social security benefits, pension income, and income from assets. 

The model handles all of the complex calculations, figuring out what 
happens to all those variables over the length of time between now and 
the time you would like to retire. Even IRA accounts, for self-pension- 
ing, can be included. When all the figures are ground out, graphs are gen- 
erated, plotting out each of the separate trends. 

Seeing what your future looks like in thirty or forty years is a rather 
sobering experience. Retirement is one of those things in life that seems 
to exist in the sweet by and by; we always feel it will somehow take care 
of itself and just be there when we need it. Actually seeing the harsher 
economic realities can be disconcerting. Fortunately, the designer of this 
program realized that, for he has included the saving grace of "what if?" 
in his design. So if you don't like what the crystal ball shows you for your 
future, like the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come, you can make 
changes. 

It is still amazing to watch the old pebble rolling down the snow bank 
and turning into a mighty avalanche. But a few extra thousand saved 
here, a raise there, a wiser investment with a higher rate of return over 
here, and prestol — a veritable ton of money at the other end. Ah, now 
doesn't that feel better? RRA

Understand Yourself. By Mike Taylor. From the time of Plato, if not 
before, humankind has been preoccupying itself with the puzzling task of 



gaining self-knowledge. In the momentary interstices that form between 
our perennial struggles for survival have evolved elaborate methods to 
address the riddle that is us. History is littered with attempts to pene- 
trate the mysterious bastions we erect that belie our avowed thirst and 
serve as monuments to the deep-seated self-dread uniquely borne by self- 
conscious creatures. The arts and sciences contain the artifacts of his- 
torical points of view that are all too quickly superceded by others that 
prove just as illusory. 

Psychology, that hazy "discipline" that deigns to institutionalize our 
quest for self-decipherment, proselytizes the Enlightenment myth of 
scientific reductionism as a methodological panacea. Inculcating itself 
with all the trappings of a nascent "hard" science, psychology directs its 
minions to seek the demigod Quanta and to pay obeisance with techni- 
cal rituals that quickly become supernumerary. In point of fact, such 
rituals manage only to distract us with their glossy scientism. Our goals 
can only be frustrated when an increasing fascination with our chosen 
tools becomes a major diversion even as our need for self-scrutiny 
reaches a fevered pitch. 

The software program temptingly titled Understand Yourself, based 
on unspecified psychological premises, purports to be a viable tool for fa- 
cilitating self-knowledge. The claims made by this program seem at least 
as questionable as similar claims made by self-help books and astrology 
manuals. The latter species are no doubt quite essential to many and 
find their niche alongside such portentious devices as augury. A closer 
look at the program enables a further deduction to be drawn. 

Consisting of a series of questionnaires, the disk is derived in toto 
from The Test Yourself Book, by practicing psychologist Dr. Harry E. 
Gunn. Material from the book appears here unexpunged, and the book 
author is given full credit — but the book contains many and various psy- 
chological questionnaires and tests not contained in the disk version, 
while the disk is easily three times as costly as the original book. 

All this is unmitigated by certain points of convergence between the 
book and the disk. Both claim, by means of seemingly arbitrary sets of

questions, to be able to unmask the true disposition of the user in such 
areas as aggression, possession of conscience, marital adjustment, sense 
of values, and others, vaguely defined. When an attempt is being made to 
evaluate such things so nebulously termed, the implication is that the 
evaluation occurs vis-a-vis some standard. The standard used in making 
evaluations of the user is never stated. No bibliography or references to 
bolster the claimed veracity of this particular approach are offered in the 
book or with the disk. The user, as hapless truth seeker, must rely on the 
credentials of the psychologist-author — a dubious consolation if one 
were really to take seriously the findings of these questionnaires. 

Much controversy continues to rage in professional circles regarding 
the meaning and usefulness of psychological test procedures. Even well- 
researched and extensively used standardized tests of this kind remain 
open to question. The pubhsher of a software program that attempts to 
tread into such territory should be obliged, at least, to offer some caveat 
in the advertising or packaging. The user will inevitably be impressed by 
the certainty that there are more reliable paths to self-understanding, and 
the astrology industry may thereby gain more adherents.

Casino. By Bob Rosen. Strains of The Entertainer greet you as you walk 
into the Golden Apple casino. The Golden Apple offers five forms of en- 
tertainment, more or less resembling their Las Vegas counterparts: 
blackjack, keno, poker, roulette, and baccarat. Your friendly 
microcroupier will prompt you with rules and options and will keep track 
of your winnings and losings, storing the data safely on disk when you 
take a break from a playing session. It will do this as well for any friends 
you care to bring along, and it'll present a game-by-game ranking of the 
five toughest players it encounters. 

Blackjack at the Golden Apple is a one-deck game with typical Las 
Vegas Strip rules — except that the croupier only counts in integers, so 
blackjack payoffs are two-to-one instead of the usual three-to-two. Keno 
seems to pay a little better than typical Vegas locales, but it's still a bad 



game for the player. The Golden Apple is kind enough to print in plain 
sight the odds against each possible bet; careful study of this informa- 
tion ought to save Golden Apple clients a bundle when they get to the 
real place. For those who like to buck the laws of nature, there's a maxi- 
mum payoff of one hundred thousand to one for certain astronomically 
improbable outcomes. 

Poker is slot-machine style, which means that you get five cards plus 
the option to throw away and redraw three. Payoff is according to the 
unlikelihood of your final holding. For anything under a pair of jacks the 
machine keeps your money (well, it debits your account); two pair pays 
even money, three of a kind five-to-one, and so on. If you score a royal 
flush, you'd better grab the first plane out before the Apple wins it 
all back. 

Roulette looks like its namesake, except that the wheel is unaccount- 
ably square. Meanwhile, the Golden Apple's baccarat offers us two-dol- 
lar players a chance to don imaginary black tie and ruffled shirt. It may 
be the closest we ever get to playing Nevada's most sophisticated big- 
money game. 

As you wander from table to table in the Golden Apple, you'll be fol- 
lowed by that same mariachi troupe that greeted you at the door. 
They've got an extensive repertoire — rooted in the classics — with which 
to serenade your every play. A shut-up switch is provided, in case you 
find their accompaniment distracting. (S

equally dense, thick, and indecipherable manuals. One is named the Ap- 
ple Pascal Operating System Reference Manual and the other the Apple 
Pascal Language Reference Manual. The former is a bulging 300 pages 
with a 14-page addendum, and the latter is 210 pages with a 16-page ad- 
dendum. 

Something happened to the Apple manuals between the Applesoft 
Tutorial and the Pascal books, and that something was that someone for- 
got that we are really all beginners in this computer learning game and 
need a very gradual, hand-holding advance to gain any ground at all. To 
aid in this, there is now a series of Pascal tutorial and utility programs 
from a young and dynamic programming group in Santa Monica, Cali- 
fornia — Link Systems. The programs can be divided into two groups. 
The first is the tutorial, LinkSampler I; and the second, three utility disks 
for programmers, LinkVideo, LinkDisk and Linklndex. 

LinkSampler is a Pascal teaching aid and tutorial that attempts by 
demonstration and instruction to get the Pascal novice to a level where 
he can make use of the Apple Pascal manuals. This is done by leading 
him through the early steps of Pascal programming with some well-docu- 
mented, understandable examples. As the manual puts it: "We feel that a 
lot of people need just a little more help to get over the initial stumbling 
blocks of learning a new language." 

The manual starts out by telling you in simple language how to cata- 
log a Pascal disk and how to send that catalog to your printer. You are 
then shown how to print listings of the programs on the disk so that you 
can visually follow the explanations on the screen and in the manual. 
This may not seem like much of an achievement to someone who has not 
spent a couple of hours trying to figure out how to do these seemingly 
simple tasks. Those who have know that after a few such humiliating at- 
tempts, the temptation is to give up altogether. 

After that first step you are taken to a three-line program which is 
used to illustrate what a program looks like and what the basic require- 
ments are. In this fashion a few new terms at a time are slipped into the 
mind of the unsuspecting apprentice along with a bit of understanding 
and a nice feeling that Pascal may become as accessible to us as 
Applesoft. 

After many such simple advances you will find yourself being able to 
look at a Pascal program and understand what it's doing. Soon you will 
be able to write your own simple programs and, more importantly, you 
will be at a level where the Apple Pascal manuals actually become tools 
you can use. Along with all of this knowledge you will find that the 
twenty-odd demonstration programs are in themselves interesting and 
useful. They include simple add, divide, and prime number calculation 
routines, progressing to loan and future value programs, and finally to 
two simple games, Hanoi and Maze. In all of the programs care is taken 
to make you understand the language and programming points being 
covered. If this isn't the best deal you can get for $59.95 and a few eve- 
nings' diligent study, the one that beats it must be a dilly. 

We turn now to the programming utilities: LinkVideo, LinkDisk, and 
Linklndex. 

LinkVideo is a set of screen formatting tools that can be used in every 
program you write. It has capabilities that will give any program a pro- 
fessional look and make it easy to format screens quickly. You can cre- 
ate menu and input screens that automatically format the information 
given it by the operator and also validate it so that common errors are 
trapped before they hit your files. These routines are "terminal indepen- 
dent." That means, for instance, that you can use the Apple forty-col- 
umn SCTeen, an eighty-column card, or an external terminal, and the pro- 
gram will adapt itself by searching memory to find the proper codes to 
operate the device being used. If you have ever tried to adapt an existing 
Applesoft program for use with a Videx eighty-column card, you will 
love this program for this feature alone. If the expected input is a phone 
number, it will be sure that all inputs are numbers and will also skip over 
dashes. It can be thought of as a black box with ten functions that will be 
performed just by calling them, and this calling is automatic from within 
your program. 

LinkDisk is a free-standing Pascal utility unit which was designed to 
fill the need for manipulating individual bytes of Pascal mass storage me- 
dia. In addition, in order to ease the transition for those who want to up- 
grade their applications systems from Basic to Pascal, LinkDisk pro- 



TTTT

vides a facility for translating data files, both text and binary, from DOS 
3.3 volumes to Pascal volumes. 

In use, the Link Disk routines are added to the System. Library on 
your Pascal program disks and are thus resident whenever you are using 
the Pascal system. 

Entering the examine command transfers control of the program to a 
menu of commands that do most if not aU of the things we associate with 
track and sector programs. An interesting innovation in this area is the 
screen display of the individual disk sectors. In addition to the usual hex 
or ASCII display toggle, you can request a mixed display which, as the 
name implies, causes printing characters to be displayed as ASCII, and 
nonprinting characters to be displayed as two hexadecimal digits. As an 
extra, LinkDisk can also compare two Basic volumes. 

A new version of LinkDisk due out shortly will also provide a text 
compare function. (Link Systems's policy at this time is to provide up- 
grades to all registered owners of Link products.) 

The third offering in this group is Linklndex. This utility can also be 
added to your System. Library and linked into your programs after they 
are compiled. The program implements the tried-and-true B-Tree index- 
ing method, capable of finding one name out of 6,000 in a mailing list in 
a maximum of three disk accesses. 

Making Linklndex a UCSD Pascal unit has separated the details of 
Pascal operation in the implementation portion of the unit, and pro- 
vided seven simple procedures and functions that interface the applica- 
tion program with Linklndex. These seven procedures and functions al- 
low the programmer to open and close the index file, as well as to search 
for, insert, and delete keys. Thus the programmer need not be concerned 
with the mechanics of a B-Tree while taking advantage of its benefits. 

Once again, the routines are well documented and sample Pascal text 
files and executable code files are included on the disk. R)R

SOFICfiRD 
Symposium 

by Greg Hkbetts 



In the past fourteen monthly columns, most of our discussions have 
centered on the utility programs distributed with CP/M on the SoftCard. 
The first goal of this series has been to provide a good grounding in the 
language and concepts that describe CP/M (and to have a litde fun as 
well). 

Now that we have accomplished this, it's time to go deeper into the 
subject of generic CP/M — what it is, how it operates, to what purposes it 
can be put, and so forth. Since we're still dealing with the Apple, the bulk 
of our specific examples will still come from Microsoft CP/M; but we'll 
attempt to show them against the background of the rest of the CP/M 
world to present a broader picture of this subject. 

These last fourteen months of preparation in the language tools and 
basic constructs should make it easy for you to assimilate the informa- 
tion that's presented. While we'll still attempt to organize material so that 
beginners will be able to follow it, we won't go to quite the same lengths 
in definition. Those of you who find the information difficult to follow 
from this standpoint can find the necessary background in nearly any of 
the CP/M primer-type books available at your local bookstore or com- 
puter store. 

First off, let's look at operating systems in general and CP/M in par- 
ticular in light of what we've done in the last year. What is an operating 
system? Although its functions may be very complex, for the most part, 
an operating system is a communications interface between the system 
processor and its environment. 

In its simplest form, a microcomputer is nothing more than a micro- 
processor, memory (in the form of a number of RAM chips with their 
decoding circuitry), and a series of electronic pathways or lines over 
which the processor can send and receive electronic impulses. Such lines 
are sometimes grouped together to form buses. Two major ones are the 
address bus and the data bus, both of which connect the RAM and the 
processor. In other cases, these lines may be single pathways that supply 
power, supply a ground path, and connect the system clock signal, all of 
which are necessary for the processor to function. 

Typically, all the lines just described, plus a few others that are need- 
ed by all or most components of the system, combine to form a single 
system bus. It is this bus that is being tapped into by the contacts on the 
edge connectors of any peripheral cards you may have in your Apple. 
Once all this is taken care of, surprisingly little is actually required for the 
processor to be functional — that is, to read and write memory, make 
comparisons, and manipulate numeric values in some very basic ways. 
Such a micro, however, has no way of interacting with the environment 
outside itself. 

In order to communicate with the outside world — the keyboard, the 
video display, and so on — additional electronics, providing channels, are 
required. Lumped into a single category, these signals are referred to as 
input/output, or simply I/O, and the electronics are referred to as I/O 
circuitry. The actual mechanics of how the I/O is performed depend on 
processor type, bus architecture, and other factors. The specifics in elec- 
tronic terms are not really relevant to this discussion, so we'll let it suf- 
fice to say that most systems use one of two types of I/O: memory 
mapped I/O or port driven I/O. 



As its name implies, memory mapped I/O reserves a quantity of 
memory addresses to act as channels of communication rather than as 
memory storage cells. These addresses terminate at external devices rath- 
er than at system RAM. When such addresses are accessed through 
memory reads and writes, however, the processor cannot distinguish be- 
tween them and normal system memory cells. During a write, the elec- 
tronics in the external device uses the signals received either as normal 
data being communicated or as a trigger signal telling it to perform some 
standard function such as changing from one mode to another. In like 
manner, when the external device is interrogated by the processor, it 
places data on the system data bus just as normal RAM would. 

The 6502 processor and the Apple computer itself are examples of 
memory mapped 1/0 systems. The 6502 processor has no port I/O 
implemented; therefore, all external device data transfer must take place 
through memory locations. The 4K block of addresses at 6502 location

SCOOO is the memory mapped I/O area in the Apple II. 

Port driven systems have (usually) 256 ports, numbered 0 through 
255, that are used for these communication signals. These ports are not 
accessed as memory locations and are completely independent of system 
memory. Processors that support port driven I/O have sjjecial op-codes 
as part of their instruction set, usually with the mnemonics IN xx and 
OUT XX, where xx is the port number. These instructions direct the data 
stored in the appropriate register out the port or request data in from the 
port. Once this occurs, the external device handles it in exactly the same 
ways, that is, as data or as a trigger signal. 

The Z-80 is an example of a processor with port capabilities. Al- 
though using the ports is more memory efficient, systems based on such 
processors are sometimes implemented with memory mapped I/O for 
some other reason that's perceived to be important. 

You may be wondering how all this relates to our discussion of op- 
erating systems. When there's such diversity even in so basic a function 
as the transfer of signals from processor to video display, it becomes ob- 
vious that a totally universal operating system will have to await a future 
where there's more standardization in hardware design and protocol. 
This is true even when it comes to computer systems that are based on 
the same processor. 

In fact, it's easier to deal with the difficulties that arise from having 
different processors than it is to remedy those that occur because of 
different hardware protocols. The use of higher level languages such as 
Pascal, C, and others when writing operating systems, as has been done 
with the Bell System's UNIX OS for sixteen bit processors, can solve 
problems that relate to having different processors. 

In the practical sense, though, there will always be the hardware de- 
sign differences to one degree or another, and as such, there will always 
be the need for some portion of the operating system to be custom de- 
signed as well. For this reason, the term universal operating system has 
come to mean a group of specific systems that, although they may be 



radically different internally, share a common set of protocols wherever 
they are visible to the user. 

CP/M is such an operating system. Internally, some sections of it are 
different in every different computer on which it is implemented. In other 
very important ways, however, it is identical in each of these systems. 
Our examination of CP/M's structure will call sjiecial attention to these 
differences and to what they mean to you as a CP/M user. 

In our earlier discussions, we said that CP/M was made up of three 
separate modules: the BDOS or Basic Disk Operating System, the CCP 
or Console Command Processor, and the BIOS or Basic Input /Output 
System. From the earlier description of communications, it should be ob- 
vious that the BIOS contains most of the differences between CP/M sys- 
tems running on different machines since, as its name implies, it is the 
module concerned with I/O. It is safe to say that wherever differences be- 
tween different CP/M systems exist in the BDOS and CCP modules, 
these differences are simply a result of the efforts of one manufacturer or 
system supplier to introduce a few extra bells and whistles into a prod- 
uct. In all important respects, the core of these modules will be the same. 

The BDOS module is the heart of CP/M. It occupies approximately 
3.5K, and its location determines the absolute end of user memory space. 
The BDOS module must reside in RAM memory unchanged whenever 
the system is operating. Note that this statement only describes condi- 
tions where the "system" is operating. It is in no way contradicted by 
those few programs that may overwrite the system to perform some 
stand-alone function, such as a RAM memory test, requiring a complete 
cold boot when finished. The BDOS uses the BIOS as its communica- 
tions link to peripherals and other devices external to the processor; the 
BDOS performs no direct accesses itself. 

Design of the CP/M was based on the assumption that no direct ac- 
cess to the BIOS routines would be made by any module or program ex- 
cept the BDOS, including even the CCP and the Digital Research utility 
programs. For this reason, the BDOS structure was set up to utilize com- 



LOCK-IT-UP 5.a 



Copy-Protection System 
for the Apple II 

by Jeff Gold 



Lock-lt-Up 5.0 is a sophisticated copy-protection and 
duplication system for the Apple II Computer. It features 
several levels of protection which make standard diskettes 
uncopyable by even the most sophisticated nibble copy 
programs now available including Locksmith 4.1. 

• Any diskette which functions under the normal DOS 
3.3environment will work underthe Lock-lt-Up system. 

• All sectors on the diskette can still be used. 

• Files can be loaded and/orsaved to both the protected 
diskette or a normal diskette. 

• You can change and/or delete the names of any of the 
DOS commands. 

• You can require Autostart ROM. 

• You can autorun Applesoft programs so that even if a 
person can break out of your program, whatever they 
type will cause the program to execute again. 

• Save to tape has been disabled. 

• You can have your program clear memory and reboot if 
the reset key is pressed. 

• Our copy system supports up to 14 disk drives. 

• Complete data verification is available during copy 
(bad sectors are re-copied). 



• Sequential serial numbers can be applied to your 
diskettes and checked with our system or from your 
own program. 

• A faster DOS can be used in order to decrease diskette 
access time by up to 50%! 

• An optional semi-hardware protection can be added 
for even more security. 

• Oursystem is supported by Dysan Corporation, should 
you need a large quantity of diskettes copied by their 
copy service. 

Our system costs only $225, which includes the system 
with three back-up copies, an informative manual, and a 
non-exclusive license to copy as many diskettes as you 
need. 

Our System Requirements: 

48K Apple II or 11+ with Applesoft in ROM or language 
system, and at least two DOS 3.3 disk drives. 
Requirements of Diskettes Created with the System: 
48K Apple II (or III in emulation mode) with DOS 3.3.

binations of very simple tasks to perform any conceivable system func- 
tion. This set of tasks, known as system calls, was implemented by as- 
signing a unique numeric value to each call and defining a protocol for 
passing to the BDOS both the identifier value and any additional infor- 
mation necessary to perform the task when that system call was used. 
Code within the BDOS identifies the call value, preserves any additional 
information (called parameters), and, based on the call value, branches 
to code that performs the function. 

In many cases, the BDOS makes use of the same less complex rou- 
tines over and over again to perform a more complex one, as in the case 
of the system call to print a string of characters on the console. In that 
specific case, the BDOS uses the same routine it uses to print a single 
character on the console repetitively until it encounters the special char- 
acter being used as a delimiter for the string. We'll come back to a dis- 
cussion of system calls and internal BDOS functions at a later time. 

The CCP is the module that allows the user to interact with the sys- 
tem on a direct rather than a deferred basis, deferred meaning under pro- 
gram control. As its name implies, the CCP's responsibility is primarily 
to scan the keyboard continually for command input and, when a com- 
mand is received, to identify it and call upon the system to perform the 
appropriate task(s). 

Consisting of approximately 2K of code, the CCP resides just below 
the BDOS module and is in control of the system any time a pro- 
gram is not running in user memory. User memory is also known as the 
Transient Program Area or TPA. Since the CCP is not used during the 
execution of programs, it may be overwritten to provide an extra 2K of 
free space for the program to work with at the upper limit of the TPA. 
The designers of CP/M recognized that not all programs would use this 
area and therefore established the means either to reload the CCP easily 
and restart it or to simply return to the existing CCP image in mem- 
ory at the completion of the program. The former is accomplished 
through the warm boot process that we'll discuss in detail later. The lat- 
ter is done simply by executing a RET instruction, since before the CCP 
releases its control of the system to a transient program, it places its own 
return address on the system stack to be used or not as the programmer 
wishes. 

The CCP is probably the most often altered of the two "standard" 
modules, since all sorts of special functions may be implemented in it 
without having much effect on the universal nature of the system. At 
least one reasonably sophisticated special version of the CCP, called 
ZCPR, exists as a public domain, assembler source file in the CP/M user 
group bulletin board of the Micronet timesharing network. Any Micro- 
net subscriber may download, assemble, and install it in place of the 
standard version for only the cost of the Micronet time charges. 

In any case, the CCP must perform a set number of standard func- 
tions to fulfill the minimum operation criteria of CP/M. These are: com- 
mand scanning, obtaining a disk directory, erasing a file, renaming a file, 
changing to a different user directory, displaying the contents of a disk 
file, and, finally, executing a transient command. The first of these func- 
tions is performed constantly whenever the CCP is operational; the 
others are performed on command. 

The first five commands are the ones you are familiar with by now; 
DIR, ERA, REN, USER, and TYPE. The last is actually several func- 
tions: identifying the command word as a transient command, finding a 
disk command file (one with the extension .COM) by that name on an 
accessible disk drive, loading an image of that file into the TPA, and 
passing control to the code at the beginning of the transient command 
program. 

Other fiinctions that have been implemented in specialty CCP's are 
the ability to use one certain user area as universally available to all user 
areas (eliminating the need to place copies of often used utilities on each 
user area), the ability to search beyond the logged-in disk drive for files 
named in commands without specifically entering the drive specifier 
ahead of the file name, the ability to query the user before erasing disk 
files to verify that the user actually wishes aU files found to be deleted, the 
ability to use so-called wild card file name conventions with the rename 
command, the ability to load programs at other than the bottom of the 
TPA, and so on, ad infinitum. The CCP performs all of these functions 



through the use of system calls into the BDOS, never accessing the BIOS 
directly, and in that sense is itself more like a transient program than an 
actual part of the system. 

The BIOS module, being unique to every different computer's sys- 
tem, has no specific size, since its size is dependent on the complexity 
necessary to perform its communications tasks. Typically, the BIOS 
module begins at the very end of the BDOS and occupies the entire space 
to the end of available system RAM. Its length is what usually deter- 
mines the total user RAM available in the system by designating where 
the BDOS module will be located. In actuality, only a very small portion 
of the BIOS module need be located here. This portion consists of a 
jump table comprising fifty-one bytes which must follow the end of 
BDOS and a set of Disk Parameter Headers or DPHs, comprised of 
sixteen bytes for each disk drive that it would be possible to connect to 
the system. This maximum number of disk drives in the system must be 
determined when the BIOS is created, and whether they are ever actually 
installed or not, DPHs must be established for them at that time. With 
the exception of these two components, the rest of the BIOS is accessed 
by BDOS either through the use of the jump table or by examination of 
the DPH to find the location of information about a particular drive. 
This being the case, all the other routines that comprise BIOS may be 
placed anywhere that they can be protected from user programs and the 
operation of the system. 

With the exception of the Apple and other systems that can use bank- 
switched RAM, the BIOS in its entirety resides right next to BDOS, since 
this is by far the simplest way to proceed and nothing is gained by shift- 
ing things around. In the Apple and other such systems, however, con- 
siderable gains in TPA size can often be accomplished by placing por- 
tions of the BIOS routines into banked RAM and having a few bytes of 
code in the normal BIOS location to switch in the bank and execute the 
banked code, switching it back on completion.

does not use the 4K bank present on RAM boards. Add-on peripheral 
manufacturers, especially suppliers of large-capacity disks who often 
need large amounts of extra BIOS space, have been able to use the 
banked area for their extra routines, thereby not removing TPA space 
from their customers' systems. In at least one case, extra banked RAM 
was provided on the peripheral interface card to accomplish this same 
purpose. We'll be looking at the BIOS organization in detail as our dis- 
cussion continues. 

There are two more areas of CP/M that, while they are not specif- 
ically identified as modules, are as necessary to its operation as any of the 
sections we've discussed so far. These are the system workspace, located 
from memory location 0 to location OFFH inclusive, and the collection 
of routines usually known as the cold start loader or simply the boot code. 
The former is present in nearly identical format in all CP/M systems, 
while the latter differs greatly from system to system, with some of the 
boot code being located in the BIOS, some loaded temporarily and then 
overwritten, and so on. Since the boot code precedes the operation of the 
system, we'll examine it first and then move on to the system workspace. 

The boot code actually makes use of three separate sections: the cold 
loader, the system initialization routines, and the warm loader. It should 
be noted that the warm loader is used very frequently by itself and even 
has a separate entry in the BIOS jump table. It is therefore not strictly a 
part of the boot code; however, its use by the boot code is almost man- 
datory. 

How the boot code is organized in a given system is dependent on the 
configuration of the system itself. In large part, the key factor is what the 
computer system contains exclusive of anything being loaded from disk; 
that is, those programs present in ROM that are available when the com- 
puter is first powered up. Some computers contain a ROM that serves as 
a system monitor or housekeeper and has as one of its functions the 
loading of the first disk sector from the first track of a disk in the highest 
priority drive. In other systems, it is a matter of having the Monitor load 
this sector by executing a separate ROM contained on a disk interface. 
In any case, it is common practice to reserve the first sector of track 0 to 
contain the necessary code for loading the remainder of the operating 
system into memory at a specified range of addresses. This is the physi- 
cal process known as cold start loading. 

In SoftCard CP/M, the cold start loader is itself made up of two sep- 
arate parts: the boot sector and the Z-80 finder. The boot sector is a 256 
byte segment or code that, like all the other boot sectors used with the 
Apple (whether they be DOS, Pascal, or whatever), is loaded and 
executed automatically at 800H by the boot ROM on the Apple disk 
controller card. 

Since the Apple disk controller ROM and electronics are fairly primi- 
tive compared to the ROM and disk controller chip combinations used 
with most eight-inch drive systems, the cold loading process on the Ap- 
ple is much more involved. Where a disk controller chip is in use, it is rel- 
atively easy to program a ROM that specifies track, sector (or number of 
sectors), and load address to the disk controller and, in one or more sim- 
ple operations, can load a major portion of a disk. 

The Apple, on the other hand, as you may have learned by reading Be- 
neath Apple DOS or some other such text, utilizes not a disk controller 
chip, but a state machine. This allows considerable freedom in the way 
data is stored on disk and gives the system programmer total control of 
all segments of drive operation, from turning the motor on and off to 
stepping the head from track to track. But it is a complex type of work 
and extremely sensitive to such factors as timing and memory usage. In 
addition, the Apple boot ROM is designed to load only the sectors avail- 
able on track 0. It has no inherent capability of stepping the head to track 
1. Since most operating systems require at least two tracks (SoftCard 
CP/M, for example, requires nearly two tracks for just the boot and 
BIOS code), it is generally not practical to load the entire system using 
the boot sector. 

For these reasons, the most common path when working with Apple 
booting systems is to use the boot sector and the Apple boot ROM to 
load a section of code known as RWTS or Read Write Track and Sector. 
This code more closely simulates the type of ROMs found on eight-inch 
systems and accesses the state machine directly to perform the various 



functions required to read or write all parts of the disk. 

Usually, at the same time RWTS is loaded, a second stage boot rou- 
tine is loaded also and this segment uses RWTS to load the remainder of 
the system. In SoftCard CP/M, this is, in fact, what is being done. The Ap- 
ple Autostart ROM executes the disk controller boot ROM on power-up 
(the old monitor ROM will execute it via PR#6 from Basic or 
6[CTRL-P] from the Monitor), thereby loading the boot sector at 6502 
address 800H. This code is then executed, loading the next ten sectors 
from track 0 into memory beginning at 6502 address OAOOH. Of these 
ten sectors, the first five and most of the sixth make up the RWTS rou- 
tines. The remainder of the sixth sector is the 6502 warm loader. The 
other four sectors that load at 6502 address lOOOH are the Z-80 finder, 
which also detects the configuration of the system and does some patch- 
ing of the lOCB based on what it finds, and an image of the lOCB itself 
that will eventually be moved to 6502 address 300H . There is code in the 
Z-80 finder that handles moving it down. The lOCBis loaded high and 
moved because its normal location is used by the Apple disk controller 
ROM when it is operational. 

At the completion of this ten-sector load, control is branched to the 
Z-80 finder, and from this point on, the boot sector image at 800H is no 
longer used. It is, in fact, overwritten as the system becomes operational, 
being used as the general-purpose disk I/O buffer. 

The Z-80 finder first shuts off the disk drive motor and then does 
some system initialization, both on its own by accessing the I /O circuit- 
ry directly, and also by using some Monitor routines. Essentially, every- 
thing is brought to the power-on/reset condition. From this point, theZ- 
80 finder moves down the lOCB, determines the system configuration, 
and locates the SoftCard. When this has all been completed, provided 
there are no problems, the Z-80 finder executes the warm loader subrou- 
tine. This routine, which we mentioned was in the last part of 6502 page 
OFH, loads not only the CCP and BDOS on the initial execution, but al- 
so the remainder of the BIOS. It is later backpatched so that on future

Uisdngthe VOICE BOX ^ Speech Synthesizer 

Now you can make your Apple® II"*" games and other programs come alive with the VOICE BOX by the 
Alien Group — the first low-cost, smart speech synthesizer with unlimited vocabulary. 

Add jokes to your programs. Insults. Compliments. Help messages. Stories. Alien voices. Animal roars. 
Hove your computer talk to the fire department or police in emergencies. To kids. Or blind people. 
Teach touch typing with immediate spoken feedback. Or just about any other subject — the fun way. Or 
help a speech-impaired friend communicate . . . the possibilities are limitless. 

The VOICE BOX plugs into any Apple II slot. No power supply or special interfaces needed. - 

Just select from its simple screen menu. A dictionary with thousands of common words (on diskette) 
automatically translates your text into speech. It's that easy. 

But don't let its friendliness fool you. The VOICE BOX has all 64 phonemes (basic sounds, like "ah") built 
in. So you can precisely create any word or sound you can imagine. And store it all on diskette. Names 
or foreign language words, for example. Or wierd non-human languages. 

Let me entertain you — The VOICE BOX is creative too. It will crack you and your friends up with 
non-stop random, grammatically correct sentences, using words you specify. It also has an amusing 
talking face with lip-sync animation — a real crowd-stopper. Best of all, you can call the VOICE BOX 
from any BASIC program and make your program really hum —literally! 

The VOICE BOX comes in two versions. For $ 1 39.00 you get a card plus a diskette (with programs and 
dictionary). And there's a deluxe version with the dictionary in ROM (no diskette to bother with), 
speaker, and ability to "sing" in any key. (Both versions require 32K or more Applesoft and DOS 3.3). 

Not Dumb — Don't confuse the VOICE BOX with "dumb" speech synthesizers that can't leam new words. 
Or software-based ones with lower speech quality — and an annoying tendency to blank out the 
display when they talk. The VOICE BOX is a true breakthrough in speech synthesis. Small wonder 
thousands of Apple owners have already bought the VOICE BOX. 

The VOICE BOX is available now at leading computer stores throughout the world. Or direct from the

calls it will load only the first two modules. 

Up until now, all routines executed have been purely 6502, and with 
the exception of the warm loader and RWTS routines, all are overwrit- 
ten by subsequent system operation. Even the Z-80 finder's being located 
in what will become the system TPA will be overwritten soon by the first 
transient program loaded. In any case, having finally set the stage, the Z- 
80 finder turns on the Z-80 and executes the more traditional boot code 
that is analogous to the one found in standard CP/M machines. ThisZ- 
80 boot code is located in the BIOS portion loaded immediately follow- 
ing BDOS. 

In a 56K system, the CCP loads at Z-80 address 0C400H, the BDOS 
at 0CCX)0H, and the BIOS at ODAOOH. The Z-80 boot code is responsi- 
ble for setting up the Z-80 system initialization, using the information 
' discovered by the Z-80 finder during its checking of the peripheral slot 
contents. Various vector addresses and Z-80 jump instructions are 
I patched based on this information. Finally, the sign-on message is 
printed, and now that the system has been fully identified, all recognized 
hardware devices are initialized. At this point, control is passed to the 
CCP, and SoftCard CP/M becomes fully operational. The Z-80 boot 
code, like its predecessors, is also overwritten when completed, in this 
case by using its location for one of the BDOS workspaces. This is a brief 
description of the boot code and its function. In upcoming columns, we'll 
examine this topic in depth. 

The final module of the system is the work area between Z-80 ad- 
dresses 0 and OFFH. Since we are limited as to space, we'll do a quick 
identification of the module's component parts in the remainder of this 
column and go into those parts in more depth as our series continues. 

At location 0 is a Z-80 jump vector which, during the initial booting proc- 
ess, points to the beginning of the BIOS jump table. The first entry in 
the table is the address of the Z-80 cold boot code we just finished de- 
scribing. Since this is overwritten later, the jump vector at 0 is altered by 
the boot code itself to point to the second entry in the table, the address 
of the warm boot routine. 

At location 03H is the lOBYTE. This single byte, a constant indica- 
tor to the operating system of which logical devices correspond to which 
physical devices, is not implemented in every system. We will take up its 
structure and purpose when we cover the lOCB in detail, as the two are 
closely interrelated. 

Next, at location 04H, is a value corresponding to the currently 
logged drive, with 0 being drive A, 1 being drive B, and so on through 
value OFH being drive P. This is initialized by boot to a value of 0. 

At location 05H is another jump vector, this one pointing to the en- 
try of BDOS. In the 56K configuration, the address of the jump is 
0CC06H. This is the location that is called by transient programs when 
making system calls to DBOS, since it is independent of the actual loca- 
tion of BDOS. The address corresponding to the DBOS entry point is 
placed in this location during boot and is rewritten during each warm 
boot along with the warm boot vector at 0. 

Locations 08H to 37H are not currently used by CP/M, but are re- 
served for use in later versions. The same is true of locations 3BH to 3FH 
and 50H to 5BH. 

Locations 38H to 3AH represent the place the Z-80 will go to look 
for a vector address if a RESTART 7 instruction is encountered. This is 
the only RESTART instruction currently used by CP/M, and it is 
used by DDT, SID, ZSID, and other debuggers as a means of vectoring 
control back to themselves when breakpointing. Other than that, the op- 
erating system itself does not use any of the RESTART locations. 

The area from 40H to 4FH is a sixteen-byte scratch area that is used 
in some implementations of the CP/M BIOS. Neither BDOS nor CCP 
use it, and not all custom BIOS implementations do. It is a good idea, 
however, not to attempt to use this area yourself if it is possible to 
avoid it. 

I Next, the locations 5CH through 7CH are the default File Control 
I Block or FCB created by the CCP for use by transient programs. Under 
certain circumstances, more than one FCB may be placed in this same 
area by the CCP prior to turning control over to the transient program. 
In these cases the programmer must assume responsibility for separating 
them and creating his own separate FCBs for continued access. 



The locations 7DH through 7FH are the optional default random 
record position in the file named in the preceding FCB. The entire sub- 
ject of FCBs and file manipulation will also be covered in a future col- 
umn in this series where we'll look closely at the structure of CP/M's file 
manipulation system and examine in detail the means of using these 
tools. 

The final section of the workspace consists of the area from location 
80H to OFFH. This area is the optional 128-byte disk buffer used during 
disk file accesses. It is also used to store the command string that is being 
entered while the CCP is active. The CCP will preserve the command 
string for use by transient programs loaded with additional parameters, 
such as the command 

PIP A:TEMP.BAS = B:NOTAPROG.BAS 

Because the command string is preserved, PIP can access the parameters 
after it becomes operational. 

This completes our breakdown of the component parts of the work- 
space. It should be noted that, provided a program does not utilize any 
of the components, it is possible to overwrite this area and allow a pro- 
gram to begin at actual Z-80 location 0. If no other parts of the system 
are overwritten, and if the program preserves the warm boot jump vec- 
tor address from locations 01 and 02, a simple warm boot at the end of 
the program will restore the necessary parts of this area. Otherwise, a 
complete cold start is required. 

This completes our overall look at operating systems, specifically the 
CP/M. We have been able to go into considerably more depth this time 
than we could last year, and it is hoped that this revised discussion has 
been of value. In the coming months we will be taking the component 
parts and giving each one the same more thorough approach. 

Your comments on this new series will be appreciated. Until next 
month. ...

MACHINE LANGUAGE SPEED 
WHERE IT COUNTS... 



IN YOUR PROGRAM! 



For the first time, Amper-Magic makes it easy for people who don't know 
machine language to use its power. Now you can attach slick, finished machine 
language routines directly to your Applesoft programs in seconds! And interface 
them by name, not address! And pass parameters directly, just like with Applesoft 
commands! 

You simply give each routine a name of your choice, perform the append 
procedure once, and the machine language becomes a permanent part of your 
BASIC program; no more separate BLOADing programs! (Of course, you can 
remove any subroutine if you want to.) 

Any number of relocatable machine language routines can be attached to an 
Applesoft program and then called by name. We supply over 20 machine language 
routines on the disk. You can enter more from magazines. And more library disks 
are in the works. Some routines on this disk are: 



Binary file info 
Delete array 
Disassemble memory 
Dump variables 
Find substring 
Get 2-byte values 
Gosub to variable 
Goto to variable 



Hex memory dump 
Input anything

Print hex $ 
Print string 
Print w/o word break 



Remove characters 
Restore special data 
Search string array 
Speed up Applesoft 
Speed restore 
Store 2-byte values 
Swap variables 



These routines and more can be attached and accessed easily. For example, to 
allow typing of commas and colons in a response (not normally allowed in 
Applesoft), you simply attach the Input Anything routine and put this line in your 
program:

Everyone's Guide to Assembly 
Language, Part 25 



Last month we looked at the collision counter and at how it could be 
used in hi-res graphics programs in which collisions might have to be de- 
tected. This month we'll see some further examples of the collision count- 
er, along with simple examples of how an explosion might be simulated. 
In a way, this installment could be considered a brief introduction to 
some special effects. 

Explosions, Rays, and Other Things That Go Bump in the Night. 
Quite some time ago the basic principles behind writing simple tone rou- 
tines in machine language were presented in this column. Interested read- 
ers may wish to refer to back issues for this information or read chapter 7 
in Assembly Lines: The Book (a collection of the first eighteen months of 
this column). 

As you'll recall, sound of any kind is generated by accessing memory 
location $C030. Each time this location is accessed by either a read or 
write operation (such as an LDA or STA command) the speaker clicks 
once. A tone or other noise is produced by doing a large number of very 
fast accesses. 

Consider, for example, this sample listing: 



crated, and NUM determines how many tones will be played. You could 
think of this program as a random melody generator. 

At line 23, a JSR is done to Applesoft's random number function. 
This fills the floating point accumulator (usually called FAC : 
$9D-$A2) with a random number in floating-point form. For our pur- 
poses, we need only a single byte, which we'll get from $9F. Very shortly 
we'll retrieve this byte from FAC for use in our routine. You might think 
that any of the six bytes in the FAC would be sufficiently random, but it 
turns out that the first two bytes, FAC and FAC+1 ($9D,$9E), don't 
vary sufficiently to generate good random numbers. 

Line 24 retrieves the value for DRTN to prepare for entering the main 
tone service loop. TICK clicks the speaker once and then loads the Y 
register with our random value. Because this value is then used in the 
DELAY loop, the interval between clicks varies each time a new ran- 
dom number is used. This is equivalent to a different frequency tone 
being produced each time, and thus gives us randomly pitched notes. 

CYCLE is a secondary loop that executes the TICK/DELAY loop a

certain number of times, determined in this case by the value given to 
DRTN by the calling program. The number of CYCLEs determines the 
overall apparent length of a particular tone unit. 

NUMBR is a larger loop that determines how many notes the sound 
routine will generate, according to the value given for NUM. 

Run the Applesoft program with this routine assembled at $300 and 
try different combinations for DRTN and NUM. If DRTN is a large 
value (greater than 20), a random melody of NUM notes is generated. 
As DRTN gets smaller, you have to increase NUM to get sounds that 
last equivalent lengths of time. The value pair 10,50 for DRTN and 
NUM creates sort of a ray gun sound, and the pair 3,20 produces a rea- 
sonable explosion effect. In the latter case the amount of time each note 
is played becomes so short that the notes tend to blend together into 
what's essentially just a random noise pattern. 

A random tonal pattern is, in fact, the key to any definition of noise, 
and noise is what an explosion is all about. What we need is a way of 
generating a lot of high-speed random data for a good noise routine. The 
RND function helps us create the random data, but it takes so long to 
execute the routine for each note that there is a limit to the number of 
notes we can generate in a short period of time. 

One technique we used earlier when speed was a problem was table 
look-ups. Let's apply this technique to sound generation and see what 
we can produce.

This routine has two entry points. This means that the routine has to 
be called twice. The first time, a call to $300(768 decimal) generates the 
table of data to be used. This need be done only once. The noise pattern 
is generated by calling $313 (787) whenever a sound is desired. This rou- 
tine is ai.so designed to be called from an Applesoft Basic program that 
would look like this: 



10 CALL 768; REM CREATE TABLE 

20 INPUT "D,P":P,D 

30 CALL 787, P.D REM CALL NOISE ROUTINE 

40 GOTO 20 



In this case the two parameters passed to the noise routine are pitch 
(PTCH) and duration of the noise period (DRTN). At first thought, pitch 
may seem to be a contradictory notion when applied to noise, particu- 
larly in light of our previous definition of noise as a random mix of fre- 
quencies. The pitch, however, does not need to be an entirely homoge- 
neous mixture of frequencies. 

It's possible to favor either high or low frequencies in the mix and 
thus to influence the suggestive nature of the noise. High frequency mixes 
sound like rays or fast moving rockets. Low frequency mixes remind the 
listener of the low roar of a slow moving rocket or a garden variety ex- 
plosion. 

Examining the new routine, then, let's see how this noise generator 
works. The first call to INIT creates the table of random values. Lines 19 
and 20 initialize to zero a counter we'll be using shortly. A call to the ran- 
dom function is then made to generate a random byte. Next, the Y reg- 
ister is loaded with the current value held in CTR. This value is used as 
an index to the location in the range from $1000 through $10FF where 
we will store the random byte. CTR is then incremented to the next po- 
sition and LOOP is executed until CTR wraps back around to $00 after 
cycling 256 times. 

You may wonder why this code was not used instead 



LDY #$00 
LOOP JSR RND 

LDA FAC + 2 
STA $1000,Y 
INY 

BNE LOOP 



Although it's much shorter and more direct, the routine fails because 
RND scrambles the Y register, thus losing any running value for our po- 
sition in the table being created. This fact necessitates the use of a back-up 
counter (CTR) to remember the current value that Y should be set to. 

The INIT routine, then, will fill 256 bytes of memory starting at 
$1000 with a random pattern of bytes. More important, this also results 
in a random pattern of bits, which will be used very soon by the noise 
routine. 

When $313 (787 decimal) is called, COMBYTE is used to read the 
values for PTCH and DRTN from the calling Applesoft program. 

READ then starts the process of scanning the data table for the ran- 
dom data to be used in generating the noise pattern. The trick in this pro- 
gram comes in using the actual bit status of the data rather than entire 
bytes. 

After each byte is loaded into the accumulator on line 35, a bit-shift- 
ing routine is executed eight times to determine the on or off status of 
each bit. Line 36 initializes the X register to act as our counter in this 
eight-step loop. 

Line 37 uses the LSR command (Logical Shift Right) to move all the 
bits in the accumulator one position to the right. The end position bit, bit 
0, falls into the carry. 

Line 38 then tests the carry flag and, if the flag is clear (bit not set), 
skips the speaker-toggling step found at line 39. 

NEXTBIT decrements our counter in the X register, and if X hasn't 
reached zero, loops back to SHIFT. If X has reached zero, X is reset with 
the PTCH value and a delay loop is entered. 

When the delay loop is finished, the Y register is incremented in prep- 
aration for reading the next byte in the data table. 

As it happens, reading each bit of 256 bytes does not take that long. 
Our sound would be over rather soon if we didn't do just one extra step. 
Although we could generate and read larger tables, another approach is 
to reread the table a set number of times. This is where the DRTN value 
is used, and the table is repeated the number of times specified by 
DRTN. 

The main area of experimentation in this routine is with different 
values for FrCH. Smaller values produce higher-sounding noise pat- 
terns; larger values more of a roar. 

A Little More Sophistication. This last routine probably sounds 
more like an explosion to you than the first one did. This is due to the 
higher noise content of the sound as compared to the more musical first 



OCTOBER 1982

routine. Something is still missing, though. A classical explosion doesn't 
sound the same from start to finish. It usually starts at a higher or lower 
pitch and works its way up or down, depending on the nature of the ex- 
plosion. What we need is a way to modulate the frequency mix as a func- 
tion of time. 

By linking the delay value to our position in the table, we can ac- 
complish this goal. Here's the new listing:

This program is designed to be called from an Applesoft program 
that looks like this: 

10 CALL 768: REM GENERATE TABLE 
20 INPUT "START?";S 
30 CALL 787, S 
40 GOTO 20 

The main difference between this routine and the previous one is that 
just prior to the delay loop, the X register is loaded with the current 
DRTN counter value, as opposed to a user-defined pitch value. Thus, no 
PTCH is specified in the calling program, and you may only select a 
starting point on the ramp, as it is sometimes called. 

Entering a value of 255 results in the longest sound possible. It is 
rather interesting to have your Apple sound like a 727 ready to take off 
through your ceiling. 

Putting It All Together. Now that we've got some sound effects to 
add to our knowledge of hi-res graphics, let's put everything together in- 
to a simple demonstration of how an explosion might be simulated in a 
game program. 

Assemble the following listing and run it either with brun or call 4096 
(from Basic), or lOOOG (from the Monitor).

When the program is run, the hi-res screen should clear, and a fly- 
ing-saucerlike ship should appear in the middle of the screen. Pressing 
any key will blow up the space ship. Let's see how this is done. 

Lines 27 through 38 contain the data for a three-element shape table. 
This table is jumped over when the program is first run. START clears 
the hi-res screen in the usual manner and initializes the shape table point- 
ers and the HCOLOR and SCALE values. Lines 49 and 50 set NUM to 
10, to be used later as the number of cycles the explosion routine will go 
through. 

SHIP draws the spaceship in the center of the screen. KEY? waits 
for a keypress. When a key is pressed, the code moves on to ERASE, 
which erases the ship prior to starting the explosion sequence. 

The explosion sequence itself consists of a three-part loop. These 
parts consist of: (1) drawing one of two explosion shapes; (2) creating a 
little noise with the speaker; (3) erasing the explosion shape drawn 
in step 1. 

This sequence is then repeated a number of times depending on how 
long you want the explosion to last. In detail, here's how this sequence is 
carried out. 

Lines 74 through 77 position the hi-res cursor at the ship's old posi- 
tion. Lines 78 through 82 then select one of the two explosion shapes in- 
cluded in the table based on whether NUM (the current loop counter) is 
odd or even. 

This is done by first loading the X register with what might be called 
a default value of #$02 for the first explosion shape (which is the second 
item in the table). NUM is then loaded into the accumulator and a ROR 
(Rotate Right) command is done to shift all the bits to the right one po- 
sition. Bit 0 will then be forced into the carry, where we can test with the 
BCS (Branch Carry Set) command. (This is similar to the technique used 
earlier for the noise routine. In fact, the LSR command would have 
worked just as well here, but a little variety can sometimes be nice.) 

If the carry was set, NUM was odd, and we'll go right to the next 
phase. If the carry was clear, NUM was even, and the INX (INcrement 



X) will be executed. Remember that the X register is always loaded with 
the shape number you want to DRAW or XDRAW prior to calling 
SHNUM. If the INX is done, X goes from #$02 to #$03, thus indicating 
shape number 3, which corresponds to the second explosion shape in the 
table. 

Once an explosion shape has been drawn, the first noise routine 
presented earlier is used to generate a short burst of quick random notes. 
This passes for some background noise for an explosion. After a few 
quick sounds, ERASE2 again XDRAWs the shape selected in LOOP. 
This has the effect of erasing the previous image. Finally, lines 109 and 
1 10 check NUM to see if the loop is finished executing. As written, line 
49 sets the loop counter to ten passes, but you may want to try different 
values to suit your own tastes. 

Because all imaging is done with XDRAW, the HCOLOR setting is 
actually irrelevant, and this routine would work on any screen back- 
ground. You may want to try clearing the screen to different back- 
grounds as described in the last issue and see how the routine given here 
behaves. 

The Shooter Program. What we need now is some sort of collective 
example of how all this can be put together as it might be done in an ac- 
tual game. Although not necessarily your definitive hi-res arcade game, 
the following is offered for your general interest and amusement.

This is an independent program that can be called from Applesoft 
Basic by typing in call 4096 or from the Monitor by typing in lOOOG. The 
assembled object file can also be directly brun. 

When the program is run, a spaceship-like form similar to the one 
drawn in the explosion routine is drawn in the center of the screen. At the 
top of the screen, a wall made up of two horizontal lines is also drawn. 
Turning paddle 0 and pressing the corresponding pushbutton will fire 
a ray from the ship. If the ray hits the wall, an explosion occurs, and the 
wall is left suitably damaged. You must press reset to terminate the 
program. 

The program combines many of the techniques described in this and 
last month's articles. The program can be summarized as follows: 

1. Initialize a shape table containing four shapes: a spaceship, two 
explosions, and a one-dot shape for the ray effect. 

2. HPLOT a wall of two horizontal lines at top of screen. 

3. DRAW shape 1 at center of screen (spaceship). 

4. Read paddle 0. Store value in rotation register. 

5. Pause to encourage paddle reliability. 

6. Read pushbutton 0. If not pressed, go back to step 4. 

7. Button pushed: Start fire sequence. 

8. Draw dot shape starting inside ship. Rotation value set in step 4 
determines angle of shot. 

9. Make some noise with the simple noise routine. 

10. Erase the dot shape. 

1 1 . Check the collision counter to see if anything was hit. 

12. If nothing was hit, add 3 to the SCALE value. If it is still less 
than #$90, go back to step 8. 

13. If no impact, restore SCALE to 1 and the explosion counter to 
#$0A. Then go back to step 4. 

14. If something was hit, find the end of the ray by calling the Ap- 
plesoft HFIND routine. Save this position value. 

15. DRAW one of the explosion shapes in white. 

16. Make some noise. 

17. DRAW the same explosion shape in black to erase not only the 
shape, but the parts of the wall that were hit. 

18. Go back to step 15 ten times for an exciting (?) explosion. 

19. Restore SCALE and the explosion counter. Go back to step 4. 
Because this program is made up of the various routines used earlier, 

this summary should be sufficient to explain the overall method of 
operation. 

The use of the single dot shape to create the ray is similar to the tech- 
nique used in last month's Scanner programs. The new things presented 
in Shooter are the incrementing by three (lines 1 32 through 1 34) to create 
a faster firing appearance and the use of HFIND if an impact is detected. 

Remember that the HFIND (#$F5CB) routine in Applesoft is used 
after drawing any shape to find out where we've been left. We used 
HFIND in this program to determine where the impact occurred. 



Also note that DRAW rather than XDRAW is used in this program 
to ensure that portions of the wall are destroyed by the impact. In con- 
trast to the explosion program, this program cannot be run on any hi-res 
screen background without changing the colors used by the ray and the 
explosion routines. 

A New Contest! During the preparation of this article, it became ap- 
parent that the creation of explosion routines is an artfoim in itself Al- 
though the code for just the sound portion of an explosion is generally 
fairly short, a wide variety of results is possible, and the ideal explosion 
sound is very elusive indeed. 

Recognizing this, we thought this would make a great challenge for a 
new programming contest for Assembly Lines. Our last one was some 
time ago, and this provides a good opportunity to have a lot of fun with 
relatively short routines. 

The contest, then, is as follows: 

1 . Entries should be directed toward creating the most interesting and/ 
or realistic explosion sounds possible. Routines may also include 
graphics effects for added points. 

2. Although the length of the routine is not critical, shorter routines 
are always given points for elegance. 

3. Routines should be submitted in source listing form. Please men- 
tion which assembler was used to generate the listing. Disks containing 
both source and object files in DOS 3.3 must be sent in a reasonable disk 
mailer and accompanied by a self-addressed label and return postage if 
they are to be returned. 

4. Entries must be received by December 1, 1982, to be considered. 

5. First prize is twenty-five dollars toward any merchandise 
marketed by a Softalk advertiser. Ten-dollar gift certificates will be 
awarded to runners-up.

The Bank 
Shot That 
Always 
Scores 



Bob McElwaine, microcomputing guru at the Bank of Louisville, is captured sans pinstripes at 
the Jenny Wiley State Park following a site installation and training session for one of the 
bank's many Apple-leasing customers. For McElwaine, Apples have brought back to his work 
the excitement he felt twenty years ago when card-crunching mainframes were hot stuff.

AMD )in SAinons 



When two small lending institutions in Kentucky merged to give 
birth to the Bank of Louisville in the late fifties, the new company suf- 
fered labor pains that wouldn't quit. 

In the long run, the answer was Apples — hundreds of them. 

And the Bank of Louisville became one of the most sophisticated, 
comprehensive, and effective users of microcomputers in the business 
world. 

This is its story. 

The Sound of Micro-Management. Many banks and other large 
business organizations see microcomputers only as supplemental tools in 
management decision making. As a visit to any Bank of Louisville office 
will reveal, B. W. Klein, president of the bank, sees their potential quite 
differently. 

In the sixties, the Bank of Louisville's primary source of income was 



the collection of interest on consumer loans. Since the merging that 
formed the bank, problems in this area had persisted. Analyzing the pro- 
cedures used by the installment loan division, then executive vice presi- 
dent of operations Klein identified the weak link as inefficient handling 
of the massive data required for processing loan applications. He de- 
cided that it was time to automate. 

The information handling required comprised two separate tasks. 
First, information on the type and cost of loans needed to be passed 
along quickly to potential customers at the main bank office and at 
branch offices that served as loan sales offices. Second, the main office 
used the information for approving or denying loans. Klein believed that 
computers could help speed up the process. 

In the bank's first introduction of computer technology, Klein tend- 
ed to break the traditional mold. He knew that the Bank of Louisville's 
business was banking, not data processing, and believed it was essential 
that the bank data processors be expert in banking, since this knowledge 
would be required of them daily. Therefore, the new data processing de- 
partment was staffed not by data processing people who would have had 
to learn banking but by the bank's own staff— beginning with an audi- 
tor and a teller — who learned data processing. Taking automation in- 
house boosted the employees' morale and helped them accept the 
change. Instead of fearing for their jobs as a result of the computeriza- 
tion, employees saw opportunities for advancement. 

Perhaps underestimating the difficulty of the task, Klein believed that 
data processing consultants could teach his people all they needed to 
know about using the new tools. But the tools proved complex and com- 
munication problems developed. The teller and the auditor couldn't 
solve all the problems that were presented to them. 

Meet Me in Louisville. When Klein turned to the computer sup- 
pliers for help, they sent him to another customer who had successfully 
implemented similar tasks. It was here that Klein first met Bob McEl- 
waine, manager of a data processing firm that already worked with three 
banks in Indiana. 

Klein's meetings with McElwaine convinced him that he needed a

Can you survive the perils of the RED planet? 

MARS CARS 



Clever these Martians. They've hidden their 
treasure in the four corners of their barren planet 
and dare you to take it. But, to reach it you have to 
destroy hundreds of massive barriers they've 
placed in your path. And that's the least of your 
worries. 

For the deadly Mars Cars sense there's an alien on 
their planet, you - and they track you relentlessly 
over the dunes, around the barriers, across the 
treacherous land. Eluding them is imperative, 
because they can "blink" you at a touch. 



The more treasure you "liberate," the deeper you go 
into the center of the War God's planet, and the 
smarter the Mars Cars get. The Red Planet's trea- 
sure is worth a king's ransom. Is it worth your life?

full-time staff member literate in computer operations and familiar with 
bank management. Who better than McElwaine, who agreed to join 
Klein's staff and quickly became invaluable as his technology translator. 

When news came of more flexible processing chips and other exotic 
gizmos, McElwaine explained what these technological breakthroughs 
meant to the bank. Klein was promoted to bank president, and McEl- 
waine remained his tech translator. 

The success of the collaboration between Klein and McElwaine was 
dramatic. Within a couple of years, the bank's staff had been reduced by 
one hundred positions with its $300 million in assets maintained. Yet no 
one was laid off as a result of automation; rather, staff reduction was left 
to attrition. Seven years later, the bank had doubled its assets to more 
than $600 million with no significant increase in staff. 

As soon as microcomputers were introduced in 1977, McElwaine 
wanted to use them at the bank. His choices at that time were Commo- 
dore's Pet and Tandy's TRS-80. The Pet offered everything in a single 
package, but McElwaine didn't like the toylike keyboard. The TRS-80 
had just enough memory, but McElwaine felt the system's expansion ca- 
pabilities were inadequate. By 1978, he'd found a micro that met his re- 
quirements: the Apple II. It needed a separate monitor, so it wasn't the 
one-piece system he'd envisioned, but its keyboard and potential for ex- 
pansion sold him. 

Hello Folly. McElwaine's Apple retailer wouldn't even talk to him 
about using an Apple to control bank operations — no personal com- 
puter could handle the job, according to the prevailing view in those 
early days. But McElwaine's experience and determination told him 
otherwise. He found another dealer and made the first purchases in what 
was to become a million-dollar account. 

McElwaine saw a potential in the Apple that most people didn't rec- 
ognize then. After all, here was a microcomputer that was more power- 
ful than the computers he'd cut his teeth on in the late fifties, computers 
that had required large rooms to house them and large support staffs to 
operate them. 

While others equated large, useful memory with huge machinery, 
McElwaine had retained a clear perspective on what could be done with 
a few kilobytes of memory by a dedicated, or task-oriented, machine. 
Having run a $15 million payroll for an interstate firm on an IBM 1401 
that had 4K of memory supplemented by punched cards, McElwaine 
knew that, if the dedicated task approach was followed, a machine with 
48K of memory could certainly perform all the computing tasks he 
required. 

That the Bank of Louisville began implementing microcomputers in 
operations at a time when the machines were of little interest to anyone 
except hobbyists is a powerful example of the bank's innovative think- 
ing and risk taking. 

Bob McElwaine's courage in recommending Apples shines even 
more brightly when you consider the extent of the application and the 
context of his 1978 decision. 

In the late seventies, economic conditions forced banks to focus at- 
tention on reducing overhead and increasing cash flow. By moving more 
money at a smaller return, the bank could equal the performance of a 
lesser flow of money with a greater return. Because of the downturn in 
the economy, more and more individual consumers were seeking install- 
ment loans that would enable them to "buy now, pay later." 

Gotta Dance. Bert Klein had clearly defined McElwaine's challenge: 
increase the cost effectiveness of the installment loan service by reducing 
the overhead, by increasing the volume of loans that could be processed, 
and by improving the quality of the information on which to base loan 
approval decisions. 

Consider McElwaine's challenge from a general retailing perspec- 
tive. An installment loan program is in the business of selling a prod- 
uct — money. The bank sells a pile of money to an individual and, in turn, 
the individual agrees to pay back a bigger pile of money, a bit at a time. 
Bank headquarters is the distributor, obtaining its inventory of money 
product through its own sources, such as account deposits and invest- 
ment, as well as purchasing large quantities of product in the money 
market of institutional lending and investment. The bank's network of 
neighborhood branch offices is its chain of retail stores that sell the 



money product to individual consumers. 

But these local stores can't sell to just anybody. The complex task of 
determining the probability of whether a potential customer will be able 
to pay back a loan requires a centralized decision-making process. 

Decision making requires information gathering and analysis that 
leads to a course of action. In installment lending, the loan application is 
the vehicle for information gathering. Headquarters analysis can begin 
only after the local branch turns in this application. And only after head- 
quarters makes a decision can the local branch take action. In Ken- 
tucky, where the branches are spread out over hundreds of miles, this in- 
formation transfer is a big job. 

Although by 1978 the computerization program had been going on at 
the Bank of Louisville for ten years, the loan processing procedures were 
still time-consuming and labor-intensive. Branch managers completed 
applications by hand, and, although telephone transmission of written 
data had replaced courier delivery, the communication process still took 
several minutes and the transmitted copies were often illegible. 

Singing in the Mainframes. Although mainframe statistical analysis 
helped central management reach loan decisions, the same problems be- 
set communication of these decisions back to the branches. And, once a 
decision had been received, branch personnel spent much time prepar- 
ing neat and legally correct documentation of the transaction. 

When McElwaine recommended using Apple computers to stream- 
line this entire process, the Disk II had been announced but not deliv- 
ered. There were no readily available modems, no hard disks, no inter- 
face cards, and no sophisticated software. Yet, McElwaine believed that 
such products would be forthcoming; he was willing to stake his career 
on it. 

McElwaine set about assembling a miaocomputing staff to develop 
custom task-oriented programs. Commercial software, still in its infan- 
cy, did not meet the bank's sf)ecial needs. 

The conventional wisdom held that computer science graduate

schools were the best sources of data processing professionals. Bob Mc- 
Elwaine didn't go along with this view; neither did Bob Potts and Marcy 
Brown. With no sense of disadvantage because of their lack of data proc- 
essing background, Potts and Brown welcomed the opportunities of- 
fered by the bank's shifting emphasis toward microcomputers. 

Bob Potts was a branch manager when the bank made its first move 
toward automation through mainframes and programmable calcula- 
tors. Potts embraced the new devices. Instead of being content with the 
bank's "need to know" level of training, Potts read technical manuals 
and talked to data processing professionals. He soon began program- 
ming his calculator beyond the levels of sophistication required by 
the bank. 

Two-Side Story. Impressed by Potts's initiative, McElwaine had 
him transferred from field operations to headquarters technical manage- 
ment. Potts and McElwaine formed the core of a new department, 
charged with developing and implementing microcomputer operations. 
By comparison with the existing mainframe data processing staff, this 
two-man department was about as small as the computer it was begin- 
ning to use. 

With the initial purchase of Apple lis, McElwaine and Potts began 
development activity in earnest. Potts's involvement was thorough. Be- 
sides developing his programming skills, he learned much about the 
hardware and electronics of the Apple and its peripherals. 

McElwaine and Potts weren't alone in those early days. Marcy Brown 
was a competent and strongly motivated secretary. When McElwaine 
saw that Brown's job was growing out of hand despite her outstanding 
abilities, he replaced the typewriter she had been using with an Apple 1 1. 
He believed that the Apple's word processing capabilities would make 
easier and smoother the turning out of statistical management reports 
routinely required by Bert Klein and senior management. 

Brown soon became so adept at using the Apple that there began to 
be too many hours in the day with too little work to fill them. 

Instead of inventing more secretarial tasks for her, McElwaine gave 
Brown a set of Apple programming manuals to read. He hoped that fa- 
miliarity with the program development terminology and process would 
give her a feeling of involvement that would sustain her interests until he 
could find ways to make her position more challenging. 

McElwaine got more than he'd hoped for. Brown began turning out 
the department's statisfical reports in record time. Upon complimenting 
her on the speed and accuracy with which she prepared the reports, Mc- 
Elwaine learned, to his amazement, that Brown had written a program 
to automate the tedious calculations and generate the reports from his 
raw data. He went directly to personnel and arranged for Brown's pro- 
motion to a programming position within the department. 

Today, Potts and Brown are officers of the bank. Potts as a vice 
president and Brown as microcomputer programming manager. They 
are testimony to the opportunities that open up for people who take the 
initiative to develop microcomputing skills. 

Damn Yapples. As time has told, the risk Bob McElwaine took by 
introducing Apples was a risk well taken. 

Today, the simplest Apple configurations are found in the branch of- 
fices. Most branches have two complete systems, each consisfing of a 
48K Apple II Plus, two disk drives, and a monitor. One system has a let- 
ter quality printer; the other has a modem and a thermal printer. 

In the branch offices, simplicity is the key to software applications. 
There are menu-driven, operator-prompting programs to handle vital 
steps in the loan processing procedure. Programs by McElwaine, Potts, 
and Brown make quoting rates and taking loan applicafions neat and 
simple. 

Through the bank's micros, customers can ask "what if?" about their 
prospective loans instead of guessing and hoping what the bank man- 
agement will decide. Once the details of the loan have been entered, the 
printer produces a hard copy of the loan quote. Upon the applicant's ap- 
proval, the application is sent to headquarters via modem. A special pro- 
gram prepares and prints the entire documentation for each loan 
package. 

McElwaine believes that the screen-oriented, interactive nature of his 
department's custom programs is responsible for the increased produc-

tivity of the branch offices. Many staff members can now take and proc- 
ess loan information — a procedure that used to require the branch 
manager. 

Bank news has been computerized, too. McElwaine, Potts, and 
Brown have modified Software Sorcery's telecommunication bulletin 
board package to keep branch offices informed of the up-to-the-minute 
interest rate changes and related banking business news. The bulletin 
board also keeps track of staff meetings and various managerial dead- 
lines. McElwaine cites the ABBS package as the most cost-effecfive en- 
hancement of the system's capabihties to date. 

On the Crown. The headquarters end of the branch office telecom- 
munication network is a wall full of Apple II Pluses, with up to six disk 
drives each. Loan applications coming through the modems are time and 
date stamped by Thunderware clock cards prior to storage. The Apples 
are hooked into a Corvus Omninet system to accommodate more on- 
line data. 

The absolute workhorse of the commercial software used by the 
Bank of Louisville is DB Master. Because data storage, transmission, 
and analysis are the bank's principal requirements, it's not surprising that 
a database management system is its most widely used program. 

How the DBMS benefits the bank is evident in the changes in han- 
dling overage and shortage reports. These daily reports keep track of dis- 
crepancies between tellers' drawer returns and paper receipts. Before 
computers, the reports were derived from a hand-kept ledger. 

Now, an Apple equipped with hard disk keeps a daily accounting of 
more than one hundred tellers' cash drawer records. Not only is the data 
accessible and easy to analyze, but it can be drawn on to determine the 
cumulative statistics for reconcihafion of the bank's overall accounts. 
The same information can be transferred to the individual work his- 
tories kept by the personnel department. 

Operational tasks such as these were once the exclusive territory of 
mainframe systems. Sophisticated software packages and hard disk stor- 
age capacities have enabled micros to do the job. 

Word processing is an important capability used throughout the 
bank; the package used is Apple Writer. It's used in the corporate trust 
section in preparing complex legal documents and in the consumer cred- 
it (VISA) department in creating form letters. The branch offices use 
word processing in the installment loan program. 

McElwaine's small but aggressive staff expands the Apple applica- 
tions at the Bank of Louisville almost daily. Cost control has been im- 
proved by keeping a detailed record on the Apple of every expense check 
issued by the bank; the commercial loan area uses Apples for collateral 
control and processing repossessions. And happier Apples are used in the 
bank's leasing services for safe deposit box accounting. 

All of these applicafions make user training critical. McElwaine and 
staff have developed one of the most extensive Apple training programs 
extant. 

Coordinating and delivering the training properly meant expanding 
the microcomputing department. Naturally, the new micro department 
staff member was chosen from the greater bank staff and trained to be- 
come a computer professional. Wayne Carter was transferred from the 
credit card division. 

Shall We Dance? As soon as McElwaine decides to move Apples in- 
to a department that hasn't had them. Carter develops a training pro- 
gram just for that department. First, he arranges for key people to be- 
come familiar with the Apple and with its potenfial applications within 
their department. Those people are then instrumental in developing the 
software to meet the department's needs. Parameter-driven commercial 
packages keep programming tasks to a minimum and, to solve prob- 
lems, people need only become sophisticated users — not programmers. 

Once a department has developed its own solufion, the people in the 
department who'll be using the Apples begin three days of hands-on 
training — of a special sort. Besides learning simple use, they get to tear 
apart and put together Apples, printers, and peripherals — all in the name 
of demystification. 

Any department may schedule refresher training or send a new em- 
ployee for specific training within the ongoing educational sessions con- 
ducted by Carter. 



The Bank of Louisville has never sought publicity or advertised its 
capabilities. Yet numerous inquiries led to an unexpected expansion of 
its income-producing capabilities. 

In came requests for help from other banks in the state that wanted 
to automate their installment loan services. The Bank of Louisville re- 
sponded by developing a microcomputer leasing program. 

For a single monthly charge, a bank may lease the hardware and 
software needed to automate an installment loan program. The lease in- 
cludes a hardware maintenance contract and provides for inifial and on- 
going staff training. A licensing agreement provides for full use of the 
proprietary software developed by McElwaine's department. 

The Louisville Melody of 1982. Since the leasing program began al- 
most two years ago, its growth has been dramatic. It isn't unusual for 
other banks' presidents to call, saying. "I need one of your Apple sys- 
tems as soon as possible. Who do I talk to and how quickly can you de- 
liver?" 

Other banks are not the only beneficiaries of Louisville's experience. 
Representatives of police departments, government agencies, and uni- 
versities have come to Louisville from as far away as England and South 
Africa to learn the Apple's business secrets via training sessions. For 
those requiring more in-depth assistance, on-site consultation from 
McElwaine and his staff is available. 

So where is this increasing acfivity in microcomputers leading the 
Bank of Louisville? Well, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Klein and 
McElwaine are currently working out a way to turn the microcomputer 
services department into a separate holding company. Such an action 
would clear the way for intensive marketing of the applications and serv- 
ices that McElwaine and his dedicated staff have developed. 

Should this happen, let's wish Klein, McElwaine, and company the 
greatest success. Because, as a result of their initiative and hard work, the 
Bank of I^uisville has become a shining example of the potential of the 
microcomputer in serious business applications. HI

SampleCalc. By Richard Anderson. This is a highly useful utility for do- 
ing statistical analysis of people-oriented figures. The models are based 
on Jacob Cohen's acclaimed "Statistical Analysis for the Behavioral 
Sciences," published by Academic Press (New York, 1977). Included 
among the modes are r-test for means, r-test for proportions, sign test, 
correlation coefficient, multiple r^ression/correlation, and the ever- 
popular chi-square. 

Some of the important concepts of error tolerance and statistical con- 
fidence are explained, enabling the user to develop a feel for the interac- 
tion of the figures and the determination of proper sample size. Remem-

The Animator. By Ray Balbes. As anybody at Disney will tell you, ani- 
mation is a tedious process. A second of film animation requires eight- 
een frames. A minute requires over a thousand. As the movie Tron apt- 
ly demonstrates, computers are well suited to performing the repetitive 
tasks of animation. The Animator will do much of the repetitive work 
for you in creating your own moving pictures, but don't expect to come 
up with dazzling cinematic portrayals of "the world inside the comput- 
er," at least not on the first try. 

The Animator is a set of programs for creating full screen, high speed 
animation routines that can be run from The Animator or your Basic 
programs. The black and white animation sequences it creates are quick 
and flickerfree. They are based entirely on lines and shapes. 

Although creating anything complicated requires a certain amount of 
preplanning, the program is flexible and forgiving enough that you can 
learn the system and come up with some interesting first efforts by fol- 
lowing the tutorials in the manual and diving right in. You first define 
the components (shapes and lines) of the animation steps in a table of 
format constants. This table tells the editor what shapes you intend to 
use, how many lines are involved, and how they are all connected. 

Next you use the components defined to create a series of steps. A 
step is best defined as a key frame. As you define each step, you tell the 
computer how many frames to put between steps. The computer inter- 
polates the path each line or shape must take to get from its position in 
the first step to its position in the next step. 

Steps are defined in one of two ways. The more interesting way is 
with the visual mode, in which you use keyboard commands to move the 
lines and shapes around on the screen until they are in the right posi- 
tions. For some setups, however, it may be more efficient to use numeric 
entry, in which you type in numbers for the screen coordinates of the 
lines and shapes. 

Once you have created a series of steps for your animation to follow, 
you tell the computer to assemble the sequence into machine language. 
With more complicated animation, this process can take several min- 
utes, giving you a chance to run out for pxjpcom. When it is done, you 
give the command to run and your miaodrama unfolds. Watch it with a 
critical eye, because The Animator has a full range of options for ex- 
panding on what you have created. 

The editing commands are somewhat reminiscent of a word proces- 
sor, at least in the terminology they use. You can insert new steps (which 
have to be defined numerically, as there is no visual option in the editing 
routines), change ones that weren't quite right, or delete ones that didn't 
work at all. You can change the number of frames between various steps 
to speed up or slow down certain parts of the sequence. You can't add a 
new line or redefine how the components are connected. When you are 
satisfied with what you've got, reassemble it and see how it looks. 

The shape maker included with TTie Animator has some features that 
aren't available on other shape makers (see "The Shape of Things," Sep- 



tember Softalk). If you give it three points, it can create a curve in the 
shape to fit them. It will also make lines automatically, eliminating a lot 
of repetitive keystrokes. But overall, it's nothing to write home about. 

The system as a whole makes it remarkably easy to create animated 
sequences, but in the final analysis, the usefulness of The Animator is 
limited. Once you have made an interesting sequence, there isn't much 
you can do with it. You can put it into an Applesoft program, but not in 
any interactive way. It won't give you animation under paddle control. 
Aside from making title sequences that move, the most impressive thing 
it does is make demo programs of itself [)D

Income Tax Data Recorder. By Gaynor C. Benson. Income Tax Data 
Recorder is an inexpensive system that's intended to replace the shoe- 
boxes, notebooks, or kitchen drawers most of us use to keep track of the 
various invoices, receipts, and records we'll need when tax time rolls 
around. 

This program won't do your taxes. Rather, it provides for you to 
store pertinent information in files named to correspond to the line 
numbers of the usual tax forms, including Form 1040 and schedules A 
and B. Most other forms have to be computed and entered just before 
the final printout is made. 

At year's end, the program prints a list of all your entries, organized 
into groups that correspond to the lines on your tax form and group to- 
tals. You or your accountant have only to transfer the information and 
printouts to tax forms and do the computations.

Kamikaze. By John Van Ryzin. This game will certainly be loved by 
those long-time fans of Depth Charge who had wished for an aerial ver- 
sion of the game. Once again you are commanding a surface ship, but 
this time your enemy is the IJA (Imperial Japanese Air Force). Besides 
the routine high and low bombers flying back and forth, periodically one 
of them suddenly turns sideways and becomes a kamikaze, diving 
straight down at your ship. To add to the fun and skill level, floating 
mines appear at random, limiting your horizontal movement. Every 
thousand points you get a new ship. 

Hayden Software is promoting this game through a playing contest 
that will pay five thousand dollars to the top player. The top five contes- 
tants, via photo verification of scores, will be flown, all expenses paid, to 
San Francisco for the playoffs. Certainly it is time to adjust the trims on

The Executive Speller. By John Risken. Do you have a problem with 
spelling? When you finish a manuscript, do you have trouble spotting the 
typos and misspelled words? If so, this may be the very program you're 
looking for. 

What it does is simple enough: it reads a text file from disk and com- 
pares each word against a master word list (provided with the program). 
Then it displays (or prints) the text, underlining each word it couldn't 
find in the master hst. This permits you to proofread the text quickly, 
without having to concentrate on every word. 

Of course, an unmatched word is not necessarily wrong. Numbers 
aren't in the word list, nor are most personal names; and the list is only 
ten thousand words long (as supplied), so a great many perfectly good 
words are left out. But that list is only a starting point: a disk can hold up 
to twenty thousand words of your choice. 

The manual points out that every writer will have his own favorite set 
of words — so the system provides a number of options for making cus- 
tomized word lists. The master word list is copiable, and you are ad- 
vised to make copies for both customizing and backup. 

Or, if you prefer, you can start a list from scratch and simply pour a 
few of your old manuscripts into it! The system will read your manu- 
scripts from disk in the usual way, adding every new word to the list be- 
ing created and rejecting duplicates (this may take an hour or two). If 
you're sure that all the words in your manuscripts are spelled correctly, 
you can let the process run by itself, or the system will gather up the new 
words in bunches of thirty and ask you to approve them. It can handle 
word lists as well as manuscripts in this way; and it can be set to delete, 
instead of add, the words in an incoming document. 

And there's even another way to add new words to the system. One 
of the proofreading modes allows you to add each underlined word to 
the word list as it's encountered. This is useful for a document with a lot 
of technical terms in it, since you can approve them as they come up and 
they will be accepted from then on. 

All in all. The Executive Speller seems to offer all the options one 
could ask for, in a simple and friendly package (for example, if you goof, 
you can almost always back up safely to the previous menu by pressing 
escape — a reassuring feature shared by most of Mr. Risken's programs). 
If you find spelling to be a nuisance, this program could rid your life of 
considerable annoyance. 

One limitation should be mentioned: the system is designed to work 
with documents (actually, text files on disk) produced by the company's 
Executive Secretary, a word processor. It may not work with files pro- 
duced by other word processing systems. If in doubt, be sure to try it 
first. And if you already use Executive Secretary, you will be happy to 
note that hooks are built into both Secretary and Speller to allow you to 
switch back and forth between them easily. JR

Doctor's Office Companion. By Mark T. Grennan. Doctor's Office 
Companion is designed to handle the patient billing and collection proc- 
ess for a medical office of up to five full-time doctors and as many as five 
additional personnel with billable time, such as physical therapists. Be- 
sides the normal billing functions, it generates reports on demand at any 
point of the billing cycle. Possible reports include guarantor list, CPT list, 
transaction analysis, monthly aging report, and history report. 

The program is easy to customize and set up for any office. You need 
to enter only those clinical procedure terminology codes, descriptions, 
and fees that apply to the particular practice. When the daily patient 
transactions are entered, the operator enters only the CPT codes and the 
program prints the corresponding descriptions on the screen along with 
the default fee to be charged. When invoices are printed, they show the 
description rather than the CPT code. 

The program can handle up to ten street accounts, such as walk-in 
trade and vacationers who normally will receive a single service, pay in 
full, and never be seen again. It is possible to designate as many as thir- 
teen billing descriptions such as office visit, hospital visit. X-ray, and 
medications. 

The program gives particular attention to the billing of insurance 
claims. It will automatically print out the HCFA 1500 Universal insur- 
ance form as well as forms required by the states that haven't yet ap- 
proved the Universal form. Zero balance billing for Medicare is also 
available. 

The manual is about sixty pages of well-organized information that 
will make even the newest computer recruit confident. The section on ini- 
tially setting up the system is especially clear. 

All in all. Doctor's Office Companion should receive serious consid- 
eration from any medical office that is ready to consider the computeri- 
zation of their billing procedures. R)ft

As a serious computer user the 
biggest investment you will make in 
your data management system is 
time. And you can't afford to re- 
invest that time when your need for 
information expands. You need 
database management software that 
is easy to get started on and that 
anticipates the inevitable— growth. 



TPG, The Program Generator, 
can be used to generate highly effi- 
cient user-structured inquiry, input, 
edit and file update applications 
programs without programming. In 
a program produced with TPG, up 
to 16 different TDM data files can 
be open and accessed simultan- 
eously, with up to 17 different user- 



Other System Capabilities 




As a business manager planning 
for growth your need for more and 
more information is inevitable. Your 
software should be chosen because 
it can handle the inevitable. 

With the TDM /TPG Software Sys- 
tem you will know you've done it 
right the first time. 



• date arithmetic Cfor aging reports, elapsed time, etc.) 

• interfaces with most text formatters and word pro- 
cessing programs to produce quality documents 

• interfaces with Visicalc and Apple II DOS 3.3 files 

• floating dollar signs, commas, leading or trailing 
signs, and negative amounts with brackets or CR 

• 12 digit accuracy 

• fast key sort, with keys built from portions or all of 
any fields 

• interactive report processing, with rewrites to the file 

• record retrieval and selection using combinations 
of any data 

• job definitions 



TDM can easily handle very large 
files, and includes the most versa- 
tile and powerful free-form report 
generator available for the Apple II, 
Apple III and IBM-PC. It provides 
simple reporting procedures in 
spite of its power and rapidly pro- 
duces complex reports. When the 
inevitable happens and your re- 
quirements change, you can easily 
redefine and restructure an exist- 
ing database. 

With TDM you can combine any 
two databases to create a third. 
You can retrieve data and update 
files from remote locations. There 
are no rigid restrictions for report 
titles and headings. You can use 
GOSUB statements and labelled 
paragraphs. IF . . . THEN . . . ELSE 
statements can be nested 16 levels 
deep. TDM lets you sort once to 
produce any number of reports in 
the same sequence. 



defined screen "forms." TPG 
makes it easy for you to change 
your custom programs as your 
needs expand. The TDM /TPG Sys- 
tem can be used with most hard 
disks that support UCSD Pascal. 
On a hard disk, TPG can make it 
possible to access up to 500,000 
records. It operates in both Corvus 
network environments. (Incidentally, 
there is no charge for additional 
copies for multiple-user installa- 
tions.) 

The TDM/TPG System is current- 
ly satisfying some very demanding 
managers at companies like Marri-

Under normal conditions, DOS lets you read and write data to disks 
in a very restricted manner with its keyboard commands: load, save, 
lock, rename, and so on. This month we're going to learn how to get 
some "raw data" off of and back onto our 3.3 disks. You should gain a 
better understanding of how your disk system works and pick up a cou- 
ple of useful utilities, so pull up an Apple and type along. 

To gain more control over your disk system, you need a way to read 
any one of a disk's 560 sectors into memory and then rewrite it, the way 
you want, back onto the disk. There are many reasons for doing this: "il- 
legal" customization, disk repair, copy protection, and so on. 

3.3 Disk Structure. Think of a floppy disk as magnetic recording 
tape in a new shape. A disk fresh out of the box is just that: a disk. It 
doesn't know an Apple from a Fruit-Loop until you initialize it. Apple's 
init function formats a disk into tracks and sectors and copies DOS from 
your Apple's memory (put there the last time you booted) onto the 
new disk. 

A standard 3.3 disk is divided into thirty-five concentric tracks num- 
bered in confusing (but efficient) computer style, 0 through 34. Each 
track is further divided into sixteen sectors, numbered 0 through 15 (the 
late DOS 3.2's thirty-five tracks had only thirteen sectors apiece, so a 
disk could hold only thirteen-sixteenths as much data). Each sector can 
store 256 bytes, numbered 0 through 255. Each byte can store a numeri- 
cal value from 0 to 255. The byte is further divided into bits, but this is 
where we get off. 

There are 560 sectors on a 3.3 disk (thirty-five tracks times sixteen 
sectors). DOS ties up three of the thirty-five tracks (tracks 0 through 2) 
and the directory (catalog) occupies one track (track 17), so essentially 
there are only 496 sectors (thirty-one tracks times sixteen sectors) avail- 
able for data storage. 

Track Allocation 



Tracks 0-2 
Track 17 
Tracks 3-16, 18-34 



DOS 
Directory 
Data Storage 



A Disk-Read Utility. With that disk structure in mind, let's write a 
utility that will read and display the 256 bytes from any sector of any 
track in decimal, hex, or ASCII format. If you don't have a disk zap type 
of utility, type this one in; you're likely to find it useful, and you can cus- 
tomize it to fit your needs. 



Warning: One slip of a finger while typing the following program 
could easily bomb (ruin) a disk when the program is run. 
Don't Experiment with Nonexpendable Disks! 



This program reads the selected sector (variable SEC) from track 
TRK, stores its 256 bytes in memory starting at location 10,000 (LOC), 
and dumps the whole thing to your screen or printer in the format you 
choose.

Here's what makes the program tick (and whir). 

Line 1 10 contains the variable RW, which determines whether we're 
reading a sector (RW = 1 ) from the disk, or writing a sector (RW = 2) to 
the disk. Setting RW=2 in this program would write whatever data is 
stored at locations LOC to LOC+255 (see line 180) onto the disk at 
track TRK, sector SEC. To change a byte in a sector, you would run the 
program, poke a new value at the appropriate location (1(XXX)— 10255 or 
$2710-S280F), change the value of RW in line 110 to two, and run the 
program again. But hold on! Be sure you know what you are doing be- 
fore you let RW = 2. 

Lines 140 and 150 get the track (variable TRK) and sector (SEC) you 
want to read. If you want to read an ancient 3.2 disk with only thirteen 
sectors, change the maximum allowable value for SEC in line 150 to 
twelve. You'll have to run this program under DOS 3.2 for it to read a 
thirteen-sector disk. Muffin or niffum it as you like. 

Lines 160 and 170 poke DOS's Input /Output Block at locations 
47083 through 47092 according to the table in figure 1.

Figure 1 . 

Line ISO's variable LOC determines where in memory you want the 
disk data to be stored, and pokes the location into 47088-89 (see figure 
1). We arbitrarily let LOC = 10000 because of a fondness for zeros. You 
might want to let LOC = 24576 ($6000) if you are going to enlarge this 
program considerably. Don't set LOC too low, or the disk data will over- 
write your program. 

Line 190 pokes in a little machine language routine at 768 ($300) that 
looks like this: 

300- 20 E3 03 JSR $03E3 

303- 4C D9 03 JMP $03D9 

These instructions cause a jump to DOS's built-in RWTS (read-write- 
track-sector) routine, the animal that actually reads the disk for us. 

Line 200 asks for the format of your sector printout. Most zap utili- 
ties dump sectors in hex format, but, depending on which sector you're 
reading (or on the way your brain works), another format might make 
more sense. 

Line 210's call 768 does a jump to the routine we put in at location 
$300 and beyond (see line 190), causing the disk to spin and the selected 
sector to be read. 

Line 250 is a tricky way of doing a hex dump from Basic. It is the 
equivalent of the commands: 

Call -151 (Enter monitor.) 

2000.20FF (List locations $2000-20FF.) 

823G (Continue Basic program.) 

Lines 270 to 300 create the mixed decimal/ ASCII catalog printout 
that is used in the analysis given later in the article. 

Lines 310 to 350 print the ASCII character for each byte in the sec- 
tor. Control characters are preceded by a (a) thanks to line 320. Spaces 
are designated by a lower-case .9/?. If you don't have lower-case capabili- 
ties (or don't like the clutter of the sps), delete line 270. 

Lines 360 and 370 perform the decimal option, printing eight bytes 
per line for comparison with the hex printout. 

Line 410 is an input check to see if the return key (only) was pressed. 
If it was, the program ends. 

Reading the Directory. Track 17 is where DOS stores pertinent in- 
formation about the files on a disk. When you type run Hello, DOS 
searches this track from sector 15 to sector 1 for the word "hello" (plus 
its twenty-five trailing spaces). If it finds it, you're in business. If not, 
"File not found." 

Run the Sector-Reader program and read track 17, sector 15, the first 
catalog sector. Make a hard-copy printout if you have a printer, using 
the format option C (mixed decimal/ASCII). Notice that your catalog's 
file names are printed with normal characters while other bytes are des- 
ignated by numbers. 

Let's look at track 17, sector 15, of a disk whose catalog is shown in 
figure 2. 

Format option C will produce a printout that looks like that in fig- 
ure 3. If you're without a printer, your layout won't be quite so tidy, be- 
cause of forty-column wraparound, but it will still be readable and fit on 
the screen. A more accurate (but almost impossible to read) representa-

lion of a sector may be obtained with the H (hex) option. 

Figure 4 gives a byte-by-byte breakdown of our sample sector. Each 
of the directory's sectors, 1 through 15, is laid out in this form. Look at 
the first file. Hello, occupying thirty-five bytes, 1 1 through 45. The mid- 
dle thirty bytes are the file name itself, the word hello plus twenty-five 
trailing spaces. If you had selected the D or H option, you would see 
each character in the file name represented by its ASCII value plus 128. 

Bytes 1 1 and 12, the first two bytes for our file, tell DOS the track 
and sector where Hello's Track-Sector List, very essential information, is 
found. The first unused empty file name slot in the directory (and all slots 
that follow) will have a zero as its first byte. A deleted file name will have 
a 255 ($FF) as its first byte. 

Byte 13, the third byte, reports Hello's file type and locked/unlocked 
status as in figure 5. Since HeUo is an unlocked Applesoft file, byte 13 in 
our example has a value of two. Notice that 128 ($80) is added whenever 
a file is locked. 

Bytes 44 and 45, the last two bytes, report a file's size in low/high for- 
mat (multiply the second number by 256 and add it to the first number). 
The second number, byte 45, is usually zero. In our example. Locked 
Applesoft File is a whopper, occupying 258 sectors (2 -I- 1 * 256). The 
catalog, however, only reports the 2 (as "002") of byte 44. 

Reading Other Sectors. With your Sector-Reader utility, you can 
read any sector of a normal DOS disk. The C option works best on track 
17, sectors 1 through 15. The A option will be more rewarding on other 
sectors; take a look at track 1, sector 9, for instance. Near the middle, 
you will see your disk's greeting program name, the name you typed af- 
ter init when you initialized the disk. DOS commands and error mes- 
sages appear on track 1, sectors 7 and 8. Anything you see may be 
changed with pokes (examples next month), and may be rewritten back 
to the disk by letting RW equal 2. 

File Swapper. When you save, bsave, or write a file to a disk, its file 
name will appear in the first file name slot available. If you delete file 1, 
the next file stored on the disk will show in position 1 , whether you want 
it there or not. Here is a utility that will swap any two file names on a 
disk so you can organize your file names the way you want them. 

Have fun, but be careful and practice first on a backup disk. If you do 
mess up a disk that's important, just remember, you read how to do it 
right here in Nibble. . . .

Puzzle: If your Apple II has a RAM card or ROM card in slot 0, try 
this simple exercise: boot the System Master; type FP (return); and then 
type print PDL(29) (return). (Apple II Plus owners type PDL(28) in- 
stead.) Can you explain what happens? 

On Joysticks and Paddles. April's column on joysticks and paddles 
brought lots of mail. Who says the Apple is becoming a serious business 
computer? Many readers were interested in more details on how the 
game I/O socket actually interfaces to the CPU; several wanted to know 
how to build their own game controllers or joysticks; and one reader 
even described an unusual problem which we'll diagnose and attempt to 
repair in this month's installment. 

To begin, let's examine the various signals that appear on the game 
I/O connector (refer to figure 1). This "port" is quite versatile in that it 
contains four latched outputs and one pulsed output as well as three dig- 
ital and four analog inputs. In gaming devices, ordinarily only the inputs 



are used — the digital inputs monitor the status of momentary pushbut- 
tons and the analog circuits measure the variable resistance of a game 
paddle or joystick. 

It is interesting to note that all of these inputs are multiplexed, along 
with the cassette input port, onto the high order bit of the data bus. This 
just means that whenever one of these inputs is read, the CPU receives a 
somewhat random number between 0 and 255. Only the highest order bit 
is significant, and it reflects the status of the desired input. Thus a num- 
ber between 0 and 127 indicates a low input signal, while an input in the 
range of 128 to 255 represents a high input signal. Selecting which input 
to read is accomplished by decoding the lower three address lines, which 
results in eight consecutive locations for these inputs. 

Figure 2 details the portion of the Apple that handles the game I /O 
connector. On the left side are two ICs that are part of the Apple's on- 
board address decoding logic. These are labeled F14 and F13. An "ac-

tive" signal is generated by the higiier order decoders H12 and F12 
whenever an address starting with SCO is accessed. This signal enters pin 
5 of F13 and, with address lines 4, 5, 6, and 7 coming in on the left, 
creates eight "active" signals of its own. Figure 2 shows these signals 
coming out of the right side of F13, and each signal corresponds to one 
of the address ranges $COOX to $C07X (where X represents the unde- 
coded portion of the address). For example, whenever the address 
$C060, $C061, or any address up to $C06F is accessed, theZ6 output of 
F13 (pin 9) is activated. This signal is connected to H14, pin 7, which is 
the enable control for this IC. While enabled, H14 places one bit of digi- 
tal information on the CPU data bus (DA7). Furthermore, this data can 
come from one of eight inputs (10 through 17) and is selected by the low- 
est three bits of the address via ADO— AD2. 

In case all these numbers have you spinning, let's try to work out the 
address of switch 2 on the game I/O connector by looking at the sche- 
matic. Working backward from the connector, we find that SW2 con- 
nects to the "3" input of H14, which is enabled by the "6" output of F13, 
which is, in turn, enabled by the "CO" output of H12/F12. Thus, the 
SW2 input must be located at the address $C063. A check of figure 3 
confirms that this is correct. In case you weren't exactly sure what the 
term meant, that's address decoding.

The switch inputs and annunciator outputs of the game I /O port are 
simple logic signals. The game controller inputs represent an analog sig- 
nal (a variable resistance of from 0 to 1 50,000 ohms), which must be con- 
verted to digital form for the computer to use it. This is accomplished by 
the timer IC at H13 along with a small software routine in the monitor 
ROM. 

Looking at the hardware side first, think of the 558 quad timer as 
four individual timers, similar to the more familiar 555. Each of these 
timers shares a common strobe input that, when triggered, causes the 
outputs to turn on and a timing cycle to begin. The length of time that 
any of the timers stays on is directly proportional to the resistance of its 
associated game controller. After this predetermined pyeriod, the timer's 
output goes low until the next strobe signal. 

With this in mind, let's turn now to the software routine that can read 
the paddle inputs. This routine is located at SFBIE in the Monitor and is 
reproduced in figure 4. The entry point for PREAD assumes that the X 
register contains the number of the paddle to be read. This should be in 
the range of 0 through 3 but no check is made. (This should solve the 
puzzle posed at the beginning of this article.) 

The first thing PREAD does is to trigger the timers by accessing lo- 
cation $C070. The Y register is used as a counter so it is first initialized to 
00. The remainder of the routine consists of a loop around PREAD2

that keeps testing the output of the selected timer. As long as the timer 
output remains high, the loop continues to increment the Y register ap- 
proximately every twelve microseconds. As soon as the timer goes low, 
the branch at $FB28 succeeds and the routine exits with a value between 
0 and 255 in the Y register. This value is directly proportional to the pad- 
dle setting. Note also that if the timer does not "time out" before 255 
passes through the loop, it still returns with the maximum value. 

Thus, the Apple achieves its goal of analog to digital conversion: the 
analog position of a dial or joystick is first converted into a resistance 
and then into a small time interval. This time interval is then sampled by 
a software program loop that converts the analog period into a digital 
number of passes through the loop. This number can then be manipu- 
lated by a program to react to input from the controller. All that just to 
move a little figure around on the screen! 

One drawback to the paddle circuit just described is that it can take 
up to 12 times 255 (or more than three thousand) microseconds just to 
read a paddle. This amounts to a considerable overhead when you're try- 
ing to write fast, animated graphics games. One solution used in many 
games is to bypass the Monitor PREAD routine and write a shorter loop 
that might return after no more than fifty passes. This definitely speeds 
things up but at the cost of resolution. This also accounts for why, in 
many games, the player figures reach their rightmost positions when the 
paddle is turned only one-third to one-half the way up. 

In case you still haven't figured out the riddle, here's what was hap- 
pening. When Applesoft attempts to read a paddle input, it simply cal- 
culates the appropriate address by adding the parameter (in parentheses) 
to the base address for paddle 0. Thus, when you ask for the value of 
PDL(29), Applesoft goes to the PREAD routine with 29 (hex $1D) in the 
X register. This causes the routine to access location $C064 + $1D = 
$C081. When a RAM or ROM board is located in slot 0, this has the ef- 
fect of shutting the board off— placing the machine into Integer Basic. 
Unfortunately, this entry is not very graceful and the computer usually 
hangs up. For the Apple II Plus, the location accessed is $C080, which 
turns on the ROM /RAM board with the same results. Too bad Apple- 
soft doesn't check for valid data on the PDL function — just be sure your 
programs do or you may find yourself fighting an elusive bug. 

Constructive Suggestions. Now that we know how the game inputs 
work, let's see how to construct a set of game controllers or a joystick. 
This is shown in figure 5. Note that pull-down resistors are used on the 
pushbutton inputs. This is necessary in order to present a "low" level 
when the buttons are not pressed. An alternative approach is to use 
normally closed switches connected to ground; the former approach is

preferred, however, and is more reliable. 

Although the Apple requires 150K ohm variable resistors, or poten- 
tiometers, most joysticks use lOOK parts. If you already own one, there's 
a way to make it work properly. This is achieved by adding a 0.008 —0.01 
MFD capacitor across the game controller input to ground. If possible, 
use a shielded and grounded cable to connect the controller; this will 
minimize any RF radiation from the computer that might cause inter- 
ference to nearby radios and TVs. 

Ready for another puzzle? This one is a real problem related by 
Mark Adams of Salt Lake City, Utah. Here is what Adams wrote: 

I have had my Apple for about a year and a half. About three 
months ago I began to have problems with my paddles so I bought a 
set of paddles from the Keyboard Company. When I plugged them 
in, a strange thing happened. Whenever you push button 0, both 
paddle 0 and paddle 1 read 255; furthermore, both buttons read as if 
pushed! I'm sure that the paddles were plugged in correctly and I 
also tried another set of paddles and a joystick with the same results. 
The same paddles work on another Apple, so I guess something is 
wrong inside the computer. If anybody knows what is wrong, please 
tell me. I have to stick to playing keyboard controlled games until I 
find out. 

Before you read the diagnosis, return to figure 2 and see if you can 
figure out what's happening. Normally, service technicians hate to re- 
ceive letters describing a particular problem. Most of the time the writer 
doesn't give enough information for the technician to determine the 
problem. Many times the only description given is "it doesn't work." 
While this may be the appropriate perception to the user, it does not of- 
fer much help to the person trying to do the repair work, especially if the 
problem is not obvious or is intermittent. 

Adams's letter, however, is concise, describes the problem fully, and 
even offers some valuable servicing clues. For example, he notes that the 
problem has just recently occurred in a machine that used to work cor-

rectly. This already provides some information about the problem. By 
checking several paddles and using another computer, Adams has come 
to the correct conclusion that the problem is within his machine. 

Referring to the schematic, let's see what might cause this strange be- 
havior. Several possible situations could cause the game I/O inputs to 
stop functioning. The key here is that button 0 is still working correctly. 
This rules out any obvious problem with the ground or +5V connec- 
tions. It also indicates that part of H14 must be okay, but apparently the 
one-of-eight decoding portion is not. 

It would seem that the output of H14 is stuck — always giving the 
status of its input 1 (SWO), regardless of which game I/O address is ac- 
cessed. Therefore, reading any of the three svkitch inputs will probably 
give the status of switch 0. Likewise, when switch 0 is pushed (causing it 
to go high), it appears to the PREAD routine like a timer that doesn't 
time out. This causes the routine to return the maximum value, which is, 
of course, 255. Furthermore, if this diagnosis is correct, Adams will find 
that his cassette input port no longer functions either. (We assume he 
uses a disk and was unaware up to now of this other side effect.) 

The obvious step to take at this point is to replace H14 with a new 
IC. This will probably fix things up in a jiffy. Let's hope Adams reports 
back that this was successful. 

Another question often raised when talking about joysticks is wheth- 
er it is possible to use the inexpensive Atari controllers. These sticks are 
based on an entirely different principle than those that are designed to 
work with the Apple, but there are ways to interface them to the Apple. 

If you were to take one of these joysticks apart, you would find an ar- 
ray of five small switches instead of the linear potentiometers. Four of 
the switches are used to sense movements of the stick in the up, down, 
left, and right directions. The last switch is used as a fire button and is 
compatible with the switch closures used on Apple controllers. To con- 
vert the joystick operation from switch closures to an analog position, 
however, requires some modification. As with most things, this modifi- 
cation can be done in software, in hardware, or in a combination of both. 
Modifying software is usually easier, but getting into the code for most of 
the present games involves breaking their protection schemes as well as 
figuring out the programs themselves. 

A totally hardware solution is also possible; this solution makes the 
Atari joystick appear to the Apple just like a regular analog joystick. 
There are several ways to accomplish this, but the tricky part is convert- 
ing to the variable resistance that the Apple wants to see. This presents 
some complications and makes the design somewhat critical and hard to 
produce. 

Several manufacturers have chosen an alternative approach that re- 
quires both hardware and software changes. Sirius Software takes this 
approach in its Joyport. 

Joyport. The Joyport allows you to connect up to four controllers to 
the Apple. Two of these can be your normal paddle sets or joysticks; the 
other two must be Atari-type joysticks. All of these devices plug into the 
Joyport, which sits next to the Apple. A flat cable connects the Joyport 
to the Apple game I/O socket. 

Two switches on the Joyport select which controllers are active. The 
first switch chooses between the Atari and Apple variety. The second 
switch enables either the left joystick or set of paddles, the right set, or 
both the left and the right sets of paddles. The "both" position is used for 
games that can handle two joysticks or four paddles. Since the game I/O 
connector cannot handle four pushbutton inputs, a multiplexing scheme 
is used to read all the buttons. More on this later. 

Another possible use for the Joyport is for switching back and forth 
between a set of paddles and a joystick using the left/right switch. The 
controllers plug into the Joyport, so it is easy to change them without 
having to remove the top of the computer. A small, removable cover 
hides the conections within the Joyport. 

The most obvious reason for getting a Joyport, however, is to be able 
to use the Atari joysticks. They are relatively inexpensive (around $10) 
and easy to find. They can even offer better control than Apple-com- 
patible joysticks for some games that use simple directional input, such 
1 as Pac-Man and Beer Run. 

As previously stated. Atari joysticks cannot simply be connected to 
the game I/O port. Each joystick contains five switches, so running a 



pair of these requires monitoring ten switch closures. Since the Apple's 
game port has only three switch inputs, some extra hardware must be 
added. The Joyport provides this hardware by multiplexing the ten 
switch closures onto the three pushbutton inputs of the computer. This is 
done in a fashion quite similar to the scheme we described for the IC H 14 
in the Apple. Here, the controller switches are the data inputs, and two of 
the annunciator lines are used as the select signals. Figure 6 shows how 
this is accomplished. Depending on the state of annunciators 0 and 1, ev- 
ery one of the switches on two Atari joysticks can be sampled. 

Well, this obviously means that some extra software will also be re- 
quired to read the joysticks. Instead of just calling the PREAD routine 
(or some equivalent) and returning with a value between 0 and 255, a 
more complex driver must be used. This driver must poll all of the con- 
troller switches sequentially. It does this by using the annunciators as a 
sort of two bit address, and reading back three bit data from the push- 
button inputs. After checking all the switches, it can then determine in 
which direction, if any, the joysticks are being pressed and whether the 
fire buttons are being activated.

Now that we have all of the relevant information from the control- 
lers, we have to translate it into positional information for the game piece 
we are trying to move around. Since all we are getting is an up/ down or a 
left/right signal from the joystick, the software must keep track of the 
current position of the piece at all times (it usually does this anyway). In 
most cases, this information is kept as an X,Y coordinate in memory. 

When the joystick is pushed up, the controller-scanning routine 
senses it, and this causes a jump to the movement portion of the pro- 
gram. This, in turn, causes the Y coordinate of the piece to be increased 
(or decreased), effectively moving it up. The speed at which the piece 
moves is completely controlled by the program. 

Although this technique is considerably different from that de- 
scribed for the Apple joystick, the effect is the same: the game piece 
moves up. Instead of a variable resistance controlling a timer that is 
monitored in a software loop, we now have a switch closure being de- 
tected by a software scanning loop and then being converted into a digi- 
tal value by a software up/ down counter routine. The only disadvantage 
of this approach is that the software must be written to work with either 
type of control. None of the early Apple games can use the Joyport with 
Atari sticks. However, since the introduction of the Joyport, almost ev- 
erything from Sirius Software has been compatible with it. Further- 
more, several older games have been modified for use with the Joyport 
and software authors are being encouraged to include the necessary 
driver routines. By the way, even though reading the Atari joysticks re- 
quires a more complicated routine, it actually takes less time than the 
average delay of PREAD (which, of course, varies with the setting of the 
controller). 

Kraft Systems Joystick and Paddles. There are some new products 
on the market that weren't available when we did the last review of game 
controllers. Kraft Systems, well known in the radio control hobby mar- 
ket, has just turned its attention to computers. Among the company's ini- 
tial products are two unique game controllers for the Apple. 

The first is a very styhsh and functional joystick. The two main fea- 
tures of this product are defeatable spring-return centering of the stick 
and excellent button placement. Rather than mounting the two switches 
side by side, Kraft chose to put only one switch on the top side of the 
box. The other is located slightly to the right but on the back side. This 
placement is ideal for right-handed users who hold the box in their left 
hand. It puts the buttons just under the left thumb and index finger 
where they can be easily activated. Left-handed users may not appre- 
ciate this arrangement as much but should still find it manageable. 

The joystick itself is a spring-centered, gimbal type with electrical cen- 
tering adjustments on both axes. Turning the unit over reveals two more 
controls on the bottom of the case. These are the spring-return defeat 
switches — one for each axis. Activating the switches requires pulling the 
stick to one comer. This raises the spring-return levers inside the joystick 
assembly. When the bottom switches are moved to the free position, they 
grab the return levers and hold them back. This prevents the lever from 
forcing the stick back to its center position. At any time, the switches can 
be thrown back to their centering position. This releases the levers and 
causes the stick to return instantly to the center position. 

Having complete control over the stick's operation has proven to be 
a dream! On those games in which up/down /left /right control is desir- 
able, the spring-returns are activated. The trimming controls can then be 
adjusted to null out any motion while the stick is centered. This gives a 
positive action that is easy to control — something like the action of the 
Atari joysticks. For single axis paddle games, one spring may be defeat- 
ed for linear control within one plane. Other applications may dictate 
complete free-floating operation. Any way you like it — it's just a click 
away! 

The Kraft joystick appears to be very well made. The components 
used are of high quality and rated at more than one million operations. A 
shielded cable with grounding clip is used for connecting to the comput- 
er with minimum RF interference, and the joystick's case matches the 
color and styling of the Apple. All in all, the Kraft joystick is a very fine 
product. 

Kraft also sells a set of game paddles for the Apple. Each paddle is 
housed in a case similar to that used for their joystick. This may seem a 





Photo 1. 



bit cumbersome to anyone who is used to the more slender paddle 
shapes. It's not the most comfortable paddle to hold, but then it's not the 
worst either. 

The Kraft paddle sports a large knob that is easy to grab. You may 
be in for a shock the first time you turn it, however. Unlike the knobs on 
other paddles, this knob only turns a few degrees. You go from one end 
of the travel to the other with almost no wrist action. For playing games, 
this seems to be somewhat of an advantage. It may improve reaction 
time and reduce fatigue slightly. In some cases, however, the smaller 
travel distance means less resolution. Since a tiny movement of the knob 
represents a large change in value, it may be hard to reach an exact posi- 
tion. This will be most evident in graphics programs or in routines where 
the paddle position is referred to as a number between 0 and 255. Most 
of the time, any exact position can be reached; it just may take a little 
longer than with full travel controls. Other than this tradeoff, the Kraft 
paddle performs very well as a game controller for the Apple. Its color, 
styling, and cable are identical to those Kraft uses on its joystick. Hi

You can just imagine what a nightmare programming would be if 
Applesoft didn't have error-handling routines. Think what would hap- 
pen if, when you tried to load a program too large for available mem- 
ory, Applesoft went ahead and ran as much of the program as it could 
instead of quitting and printing an "out of memory" message. Or if, in- 
stead of printing "undef d statement" when the line number referred to 
in a goto command didn't exist, Applesoft simply went to the next line 
number or, perhaps worse, created the missing line and gave it some 
harmless command like conf^ What if, instead of giving an overflow or 
division by zero message, Applesoft simply used the largest number it 
could handle? 

If computers didn't have error-handling mechanisms, all kinds of 
horrifying things could happen. The computer that directs the Space 
Shuttle could load and execute the instructions for launching the shuttle 
without letting anyone know that it hadn't had room for the landing in- 
structions. A goto command in an accounting program could jump to 
nonexistent line number 10000 instead of to line 1000, which the pro- 
grammer had meant to type, causing the program to overlook a bunch of 
costs and blithely show sales and profits rising all the way to bank- 
ruptcy. Or the stresses on a new bridge across the Mississippi could be 
too low by a factor of twenty because, instead of generating an error, ac- 
cidental division by zero simply created a very large number. 

Portents of Disaster. Not all errors can be anticipated, and bridges 
have fallen occasionally because of design error, but it's essential that 
programming languages catch as many errors as possible. It's also very, 
very desirable for programs to print messages that help the programmer 
or user find and correct errors. If you're working with a program that 
has a thousand lines, the message "syntax error" isn't nearly as useful to 
you as "syntax error in line 2390." 

The Apple has three kinds of error messages, each with its own 
prompt. When there's an error in an Applesoft program, the error mes- 
sage is preceded by a question mark; Integer Basic prints three asterisks 
preceding an error message; and DOS error messages have nothing in 
front of them. Because Applesoft and DOS error messages are the ones 
most Apple owners will encounter, we'll look only at them. 



Boot DOS by having an initialized disk in your boot drive when you 
turn on your machine and then enter the following program.

10 FOR I = 1 TO 1000 
20 X = 1/2 
30 PRINT X 
40 NEXT I 

Them's the Breaks. Run the program to make sure it's okay. You 
should get a rapidly scrolling column of numbers from .5 to 500 in incre- 
ments of .5. When you've seen enough, hit control-C to stop the pro- 
gram. You'll see the message, "Break in «" (« being the line number the 
program happened to stop at). Even though you stopped the program on 
purpose, this break is technically an error. Applesoft treats it as a special 
one, though, and leaves out the question mark. 

Now type print X, and you'll see that control-C does not affect the 
value of the variables. You can recover from control-C and continue 
running the program simply by typing cont (short for continue). Try it, 
then hit control-C again. 

Now type continue. This time your message is "?syntax error" with no 
line number because the error came directly from the keyboard. Try to 
restart using cont. You get the message, "?Can't continue error." This is 
for your protection. When a running program is interrupted, you can 
start it up from that point again only if you have made no changes in the 
program while it was stopped (you could have changed the value of a 
variable) and only if no errors have occurred. Again, type print X; you'll 
see that errors also leave variables intact. 

Run the program again and hit control-S. The program will stop, 
and will do so without printing "Break in «" to mess up that crucial re- 
port that's going to the chairman of the board. 

It shouldn't have worked that way, should it? According to your Ap- 
plesoft manuals, control-S stops only listings, not running programs, 
which stop only with control-C and its error message. Well, documented 
or not, it works. 

To start the program again, hit any key except reset. If you're print- 
ing a report and need to stop the output to change the paper in the print- 
er, control-S is the command to use if you want to avoid an error mes- 
sage on the report. Try it out (just don't bump the keyboard while you're 
stopped). 

Finally, run the program and stop it with reset. The program will 
stop and, as when you use control-S, there will be no error message — un- 
til you try to start the program again. First, type print X to satisfy your- 
self that the variables are still intact and then type cont, which does work 
with reset, at least in theory. This time you should get the message, "Next 
without for in 40." There's no error in the program, but reset sets some 
of the pointers back to zero again so they're ready for the next program. 
In this case, the for portion of the loop has been cleared. Even though 
cont will work after reset, reset may have changed the program. 

Finding Those Pesky Typos. Now add these lines to your program: 

5 PRINT X 

25 IF X = 100 GOTO 50 

50 HIME 

Run the program. The first number on the screen is now 0 because 
the command run sets all variables to zero as well as the stacks and point- 
ers. After the printing of the number 100, the program will stop with the 
message, "?Syntax error in 50," where you typed hime instead of home. 
Type cont. As expected, you get the message, "?Can't continue error" be- 
cause, as we saw above, Applesoft won't continue after an error. 

Now begin again from the top, but this time start the program with 
goto 5. When you use the command goto n from the keyboard, the pro- 
gram begins running at that line, and if n happens to be the first line, it's 
almost the same as the command run — but not quite. 

When the numbers start scrolling on your screen, stop them immedi- 
ately with control-S. Notice that the first number displayed is 100. Like 
reset, errors clear certain pointers and stacks but do not zero the vari- 
ables. If for any reason you want to start over with any command but 
rm, be sure you clear the variables first, either from the keyboard or at 
the beginning of the program. 

Although the result is basically the same, let's create a DOS error. 
Type: 



50 D$ = CHR$(4) 

60 PRINT D$ "LOAD SA.PLE" 

Line 50 is fundamental to using disk commands in programs. It defines 
the string variable D$ as character number 4 in the official set of ASCII 
characters. This, as you can see from page 138 of your Applesoft pro- 
gramming manual, is control-D, which is Applesoft's way of notifying 
the Apple that the next command is a DOS command rather than one in 
Basic. Once D$ is defined as control-D, the instruction print D$ in line 60 
tells the computer to treat the command enclosed in quotes that follows 
as a DOS command, just as though it had been typed from the keyboard. 

Line 60 does contain an error. Instead of calling for a file called Sam- 
ple, we typed a comma in place of the M. Run the program and you 
should see "syntax error" (without a question mark) because of the ille- 
gal comma, followed by "break in 60." If you correct this error and run 
the program again, you should get a file not found error unless your disk 
contains a file named Sample. In both cases, type print X from the key- 
board after the program stops and you'll see that DOS errors, like Ap- 
plesoft errors, leave the variables intact. DOS errors also reset certain 
pointers and stacks, though. 

There's no need to discuss all sixteen Applesoft and fifteen DOS er- 
ror messages individually. They're well covered in the manuals, and the 
purpose of this lesson is to show what encountering an error can do to 
the rest of your program. 

Error Handling with Care. Providing error traps in your programs 
will keep common, simple user errors such as mistyped keys from caus- 
ing serious errors that make the programs crash. Error traps are one 
mark of careful, professional programming. Users simply aren't going 
to continue using a program that bombs every time they accidentally hit 
a wrong key. 

Next month, we'll look at ways of trapping user errors made at the 
keyboard. In the meantime, here's a bit of not very useful information 
for the curious.

rent DOS manual (page 121) is the sentence, "The program's file name, 
specified with init or Update, must refer to an Applesoft or Integer Basic 
program file." 

Update'^ What command is that? It's not listed in the index of either 
the DOS manual or the Applesoft manual. If you try to use Update as a 
command the way you'd use init, you get ?syntax error. Despite the ref- 
erence to it Update is not a command. It's also no longer useful. Update is 
a machine language program on the old DOS 3.2 System Master that up- 
grades the DOS on a disk from 3.0, 3.1, or whatever to 3.2. It also con- 
verts a slave disk, which will boot only on a machine with the same 
amount of memory as the one that was used to initialize it, to a master 
disk, which will boot on any Apple with at least 16K of memory. 

Fun with File Names. In the process. Update also changes the name 
of the greeting program. If you're not careful, you can end up with a disk 
whose files wiU load and run if DOS is already booted from another disk 
but will not boot successfully by itself. You can create the same difficul- 
ty on a 3.3 disk using the rename command. Although useless from the 
practical standpoint, it's worth doing once to learn a bit about how DOS 
works. 

Take a blank disk and initialize it with some small greeting program 
by typing: 



commands load greetings and run greetings work fine. But prjfd gives you 
a "file not found" message. 

When you initialize a disk, your Apple copies the disk operating sys- 
tem onto it and enters into it the name of the Applesoft or Integer Basic 
program you have given it. When you later boot that disk, DOS searches 
the catalog for an Applesoft or Integer Basic file with that name and then 
runs that program. If a program with that name isn't there, the disk 
won't boot. If you have a friend you'd like to confound, send him or her 
a disk initialized with this program; 

10 HOME 

20 VTAB 5 

30 PRINT "THE MIRROR, MIRROR ON THE WALL SAYS" 

40 PRINT:PRINT " 'YOU ARE THE FAIREST OF THEM ALL' " 

50 VTAB 20 

60 PRINT "(LEAVE YOUR APPLE ON. IF YOU TOUCH A KEY," 

70 PRINT "YOU'LL NEVER SEE THIS MESSAGE AGAIN!)"; : GET 

A$: PRINT 

80 D$ = CHR${4) 

90 PRINT D$; "RENAME HELLO, NEVER MORE" 
100 PRINT D$; "RENAME TEMPORARY, HELLO" 
110 PRINT D$; "DELETE NEVER MORE" 



NEW 

10 HOME 

20 PRINT "HELLO" 

30 END 

INIT HELLO 



When you've initialized the disk, type. 



RENAME HELLO, GREETINGS 



and check the catalog to make sure the name has been changed. Now the 



Initialize the disk with the name Hello. Then save on it the following 
program with the name Temporary. 

10 HOME 
20 VTAB 10 

30 PRINT "SORRY. YOU ONLY GET TO SEE IT ONCE." 

What will happen when the disk is booted ought to be obvious from 
the program. If not, initialize two disks with the first program and then 
save the second program on both. Boot one disk to see for yourself.

Exploring Business Basic, Part 13 

Last time we plunged as far as anyone seemed to dare into creating 
special screen functions. As is the usual pace in this column, we will now 
move swiftly from the sublime to the overly intense, and in the process 
answer last month's mystery question, "How can I tell the difference be- 
tween the return and enter keys?" We asked this question, or something 
like it, last time when we delved into creating a data entry screen builder 
program. Rather than answer the question by inserting that capability 
into the data entry program, we'll provide a general-purpose keyboard 
read program that you can modify to any number of uses. 

Two Bytes Are a Lot To Swallow. Before getting into the program, 
let's consider some possible solutions and their problems. We have 
agreed that the only difference between enter and return is that the enter 
key, along with the rest of the numeric pad and some other keys, is a spe- 
cial key within the SOS keyboard definition. That means that although a 
normal read to the console returns an ASCII value of 13 in both cases, a 
two-byte read will return a flag in the keyboard status byte that indicates 
whether or not a special key was pressed. The layout of the two bytes 
is shown in figure 1 (stolen from Appendix G of the Standard Device 
Drivers Manual). 

Well, this looks deceptively simple. We learned in a previous episode 
that there is a control call to the console driver (using request.inv) which 
can put the keyboard into two-byte read mode. This is device control call 
number three. After calling it with a parameter of 128 (hex $80) the con- 
sole will return two bytes for each keypress. Okay! Now all we have to 
do is perform the control call and input from the console, right? Unfor- 
tunately, ordinary reads don't work too well. They keep expecting the 
line terminator character (normally return) and when two bytes pop up, 
input gets confused. Okay, still keeping it simple, let's do a get, which 
doesn't require a terminator character. Oops again. Get expects to re- 
ceive only one character, and, in fact, informs the console of this desire. 
The console keeps getting two characters each keypress, and for reasons 
too bizarre to discuss here, returns no characters to the get. Get, expect- 
ing always to receive a character as soon as one is typed, bravely returns 
a null string to the user, no matter what was typed. Interestingly enough, 
the ASC function interprets a null string as having an ASCII value of 
- 1 . You may have to try that one to believe it.

Waiting for Baudot. Now that all that's clear, let's get back to the 
original question. How can you do it? The most plausible answer lies in 
yet another console capability, the little-known no-wait read. We want to

Line 5 invokes the request.inv module, which performs SOS calls. 
Then lines 10 through 35 set up the screen and initialize variables which 
will be used later. Line 40 performs the control call which puts the con- 
sole into two-byte read mode. Line 45 puts the console into no-wait 
mode, so that read requests are immediately filled with whatever has 
been typed up to the point of the read. Line 50 is very important. It sets 
up a jump to a "back to normal" routine that we'll put in later. If for 
some reason your program terminates without setting everything back, 
Basic will become very confused, and you will have to reboot. This is be- 
cause Basic, like everybody else, uses the console driver for input. 

Sometimes It's Proper to Interrupt. Line 55 starts the interesting 
stuff. We could, of course, keep reading the console until something 
showed up (sometimes called polling the keyboard). A better, more effi- 
cient way is to use the keyboard interrupt as a trigger to go and look at 
what was typed. Between keypresses, line 60 keeps something interesting 
going on on the screen, to let you know that it's waiting. Obviously, the 
routine at line 60 could be expanded to do useful work (more on that 
later!). 

When a key is pressed, the on KBD statement in line 55 sends the pro- 
gram leaping to line 65. That routine looks like this: 

65 OFF KBD 

70 INPUT#1;char$ 

75 PRINT:HPOS = 24 

77 FOR k = 1 TO LEN(char$):PRINT" ";MID$(HEX$(ASC(MID$ 
(char$,k,1))),3,2);:NEXT k 

79 PRINT clearendvp$:PRINT 

80 IF char$ = CHR$(9) + CHR$(199) THEN 100 
85 HPOS = 0:VPOS= VPOS-3 

90 ON KBD GOTO 65 
95 RETURN 

Sometimes It Isn't. First, we turn off keyboard interrupts, and then 
perform a file input statement to get the accumulated characters. Using 
file input {inputjf) is unusual, since it is generally easier to use the value of 
KBD, the reserved value containing the ASCII value of the k^ress that 
triggered on KBD. However, if you think that a two-byte read confuses 
get, it really blows KBD's mind. Note that with no-wait on, an ordinary 
input statement only returns the first byte in the buffer (don't ask why!). 
Thus we use input#, and since no-wait is turned on, we'll get any 
characters currently in the buffer placed in the variable charS. 

Line 77 scans through the string and prints out the hex codes of each 
character there. By scanning the entire length of the string, we take care 
of the case of any characters being entered while the previous set of char- 
acters were being processed. Don't let the somewhat complex print state- 
ment in line 77 throw you. It is simply taking each character, converting 
it to its ASCII equivalent, converting that to hexadecimal notation, and 
then extracting the rightmost two hex digits (since the value is always 255 
or less — $FF in hex). Line 79 prints the console command to "clear to 
end of viewport" (CHR$(29)). This ensures that if the previous display 
contained multiple characters, the excess ones will be erased when the 
print occurs. 

Line 80 gives us a way out of the program, by testing for a certain 
two-byte combination. Checking your keyboard chart should prove that 
the desired combination (read as an ASCII 9 followed by an ASCII 199) 
is a control— shift— tab. You can change the exit to any combination of 
keystrokes just by substituting the appropriate character codes in Une 80. 
If the characters don't match, the routine resets the display location and 
returns to the little time waster in line 60. 

Reality Revisited. In the event of a match (or an error), lines 100 
through 125 clean things up and terminate the program. They look like 
this: 

100 REM return to reality 

105 PERFORM control (%3,@hex00$) devlce$ 

110 PERFORM control (%10,@hexOO$) deviceS 

115 PRINT:PRINT 

120 CLOSEilNVOKE 

125 END 

Now that you've typed in this little jewel, you can try some interest- 
ing things. So far we've discovered ten different variations on the letter 
A, and there are bound to be more. Those who think the Apple III only 




207 



has two function keys, think again! The combinations are practically 
endless. 

When you are tired of trying out all the weird combinations (like 
Open-Apple,. Closed-Apple, Control, Shift, Alpha Lock A), then con- 
sider the more useful ones. Return is read as OD 41, which means car- 
riage return ^Ivith keyboard on and any key flags set. Enter, on the other 
hand, is read dsOD CI, which means the carriage return with keyboard on, 
any key, and special key flags sets. Similarly, a 1 on the main keyboard is 
read as 31 41, while 1 on the numeric pad is 31 CI . That's how programs 
like Word Juggler can use the numeric pad as a special function key set. 
Another handy example is that control-H is 08 45, while the backarrow 
key is 08 CI. This allows a program to distinguish between an ASCII 
backspace and a cursor backspace. Apple Writer III uses control-backar- 
row {08 C5) for deleting a character and a simple backarrow (OS CI) for 
cursor movement. With single-byte reads, these two different combina- 
tions would be indistinguishable. 

But Will It Play in Peoria? As usual, this column tells you more 
than you could possibly want to know about almost everything. Know- 
ing all this stuff about two-byte reads, you'll probably be able to develop 
applications with the keypad and other keystroke combinations that 
really simplify things for the user. An added benefit, and possibly the 
subject of a full article one of these days, is the ability to do useful work 
within a program while waiting for the user to type something. For in- 
stance, your program could print out a disk file which it previously 
wrote. You could use the driver status calls to tell how many characters 
are left to be printed and occasionally output enough to keep the printer 
busy. In some circles, this is known as spooling and is considered really 
tricky. With SOS and the input routine mentioned earlier, it becomes rel- 
atively trivial. Good luck, and have fun! 

P.S.: Next month's column is a long treatise on sorting techniques in 
Basic, including some routines that can sort a thousand items in a min- 
ute or so. Unbelievable? Watch this space! Until then, a final puzzle: 
What combination of keys creates the largest value for a two-byte read 
(considering both bytes as one sixteen-bit unsigned value)? Answer next 
time! )l

Apples of the Sun 



Bv DAVID mwm 



The launching on February 14, 1980, of the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration's Solar Maximum Mission signified to solar 
astronomers the end of the Dark Ages. In September of that year, orbiting 
four hundred and ten miles above the earth, the satellite had provided the 
most incontestable evidence to date supporting a theory long held by 
some of the best minds in the field The sun is a variable star. 

Mira is a red-orange variable star in the equatorial constellation of 
Cetus. The total brightness of Mira varies from magnitude two to mag- 
nitude ten (a lower number of magnitude means greater brightness — 
magnitude six is the dimmest you can see with the naked eye). The com- 
plete cycle of Mira's brightening and dimming takes about three hun- 
dred and thirty days. 

Buying real estate on a planet in the Mira system is not recom- 



mended. A difference of five magnitudes means a difference of one hun- 
dred in brightness. Eight magnitudes difference means Mira shines 
twenty-five hundred times brighter than its minimum every nine-tenths 
of an Earth year. One nice thing about variable stars is that they are 
regular — most of the time. 

Our Exceptional Sun. Our local star, the sun, is not so regular. Ac- 
cording to data gathered by NASA's SMM on the sun's total luminosity 
using the Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor experiment, 
slight fluctuations occur almost daily. The amounts are usually small, 
about 0.05 percent, but dips in luminosity of 0.2 percent (one part in five 
hundred) have been recorded. The more dramatic dips have coincided 
with the appearance of large sunspots on the sun. 

For the past few thousand years, humans have been trying to discov-

Lawrence peers at the mysteries of the sun with help from the San Fernando 
Observatory's twenty-four inch vacuum telescope. 



er what the sun is made of and how it works. We know the sun is about 
864,000 miles in diameter and 93,000,000 miles from the earth. In tons, 
the sun's weight is 219 followed by twenty-five zeros. We know the sun is 
a giant sphere of gas, very hot in the center and relatively cool at the 

edges. 

Furthermore, the sun is a giant fusion reactor rotating on its axis — 
every twenty-seven days at the equator (the closer toward the poles, the 
slower the rotation). In the dense central core, hydrogen atoms fuse into 
helium atoms in a three-step proton-proton reaction. The conversion of 
the missing mass from this reaction (the resulting helium nuclei have less 
mass than the original hydrogen atoms) powers the sun and brings light 
to our sky. 

There's no doubt about it, the sun is a fascinating subject about 
which many questions remain unanswered. Why does the sun change its 
diameter spwradically? What causes sunspots? What are coronal holes? 
Where are the neutrinos? Each time a question is answered, ten new ones 
are generated. 

The Lonely Seekers. Enter John Lawrence and Gary Chapman of 
the San Fernando Observatory in Sylmar, California. These solar as- 
tronomers, who double as professors at California State University at 
Northridge, both use Apples in research. They are but two of mitfiy 
thousands around the world studying our fiery and mysterious neighbor 
year-round. 

Astronomers and observatories are a hearty lot. Lonely peaks in far- 
away places like Peru and Nepal are the poetic locales we've come to ex- 
pect. The San Fernando Observatory in Sylmar used to reside on a tiny 
peninsula in the middle of the Los Angeles Reservoir. That was before 
the earthquake of 1971. 

It didn't help matters at all that the observatory and reservoir were 
smack-dab on top of that quake. The reservoir developed such serious 
cracks that it had to be drained. The observatory's twenty-four inch vac- 
uum telescope broke loose from its moorings; repairs took over a year. 
At least the telescope had a chance. The reservoir is still empty. 



Let the Sunshine In. The importance of solar astronomy cannot be 
underestimated. The sun has very significant effects on the earth. It has 
been shown that prolonged droughts and ice ages can be caused by 
changes in the sun. Agriculture is the most important activity of our spe- 
cies, and its success depends on the cooperation of our fluctuating, un- 
predictable star. 

John Lawrence may not wield the jawbone of an ass or rescue peo- 
ple from frozen rivers, but he's a hero nonetheless. Calmly and quietly he 
goes about the work of analyzing data from the sun. What others might 
consider tediously boring, he relishes. 

Lawrence's latest contribution to understanding the sun is a paper 
finished this spring describing the spatial distribution of umbral dots 
and granules. Umbral dots are the bright features in the dark central area 
of a sunspot, called the umbra. Photospheric granules are brilliant bright 
spots in the photosphere, the luminous surface layer of the sun. 

Two Czechoslovakian astronomers, V. Bumba and J. Suda, have 
posited that umbral dots are morphologically identical to granules, the 
only difference being the size of the two phenomena. From this they im- 
ply that the same convective processes underlie both. 

Trashing Old Blinds. Lawrence is not the first to challenge this 
theory. R. E. Loughhead, R. J. Bray, and E. J. Tappere have cited dif- 
ferences between the sizes and spacings of umbral dots versus photo- 
spheric granules. Parisian astronomers A. Adjabshirzadeh and S. 
Koutchmy have noted the differences in size and shape between umbral 
dots and granules, in addition to pointing out that umbral dots do not 
become foreshortened near the solar limb as do granules. The conclu- 
sion reached by the naysayers is there are fundamental differences be- 
tween the two phenomena, though some kind of convective process un- 
derlying umbral dots cannot be ruled out. 

Lawrence's paper means to set the record straight. "We will com- 
pare the work of the . . . authors by means of a statistical study of the dis- 
tribution of points in a plane," he writes. "Consider a collection of N 
points in an area A. The points may be randomly distributed, or some 
underlying mechanism may tend to cluster them together or cause them 
to be more evenly spaced than random." 

Determining a value for the state of randomness is where the Apple 
comes in. Lawrence wrote his own program for generating random dots 
in a rectangular or square area. You have a choice as to the size of the 
area and how many dots. A machine language subroutine handles the 
point plotting. The program also generates the all-important nearest 
neighbor measurement and standard deviation. 

"The main thing I learned from machine language is that I don't like 
it much," Lawrence muses. "I like a nice, easy, high-level language." 

Each point in a sample must be measured for its nearest neighbor 
point. You then average this for the whole sample to find the average 
nearest neighbor distance, L. Much of Lawrence's case rests on this 
method, which he makes clear in his paper "[L] is a precisely defined 
quantity and is more suitable for quantitative analysis than are the 
'typical separations' or distances between 'adjacent' or 'neighboring' 
points referred to in umbral dot literature." 

L is converted to a dimensionless, scale-invariant "structure param- 
eter" by this equation, 

P = NLVA = pL^ 

where p is the average surface density of the points in the sample. A typi- 
cal value, Po, is expected, on the average, for the number of points P will 
have in a randomly distributed sample. Points clustered by some non- 
random process are therefore represented by 0<P<Po. 

"P is maximized for regularly spaced points in hexagonal close- 
packed configuration," Lawrence writes with fervor. "In this case P = 
1.155 (for points in a square lattice array, P = 1). Thus, for points with 
some even spacing mechanism we expect Po<P<1.155." 

Lawrence determined the value of Po by repeated simulations on the 
Apple using his random point generating program. Next he empirically 
determined P for a number of samples related to umbral dots and gran- 
ules. The idea was to find all the values for P using samples published by 
Adjabshirzadeh and Koutchmy and Bumba and Suda. Lawrence also 
tested the oentroids of laboratory Benard convection cells and photo- 
graphs taken at the San Fernando Observatory.

Once he had the values of P, Lawrence used the Apple and elemen- 
tary statistical methods (student's /-test) to reach conclusions about each 
sample. Lawrence found that Adjabshirzadeh and Koutchmy's umbral 
dots were more evenly spaced than random — P>Po. 

According to Lawrence's research, the centroids of granule cells 
taken from the San Fernando Observatory photographs and the maps of 
Bumba and Suda are more evenly spaced than A and K's umbral dots. 
"Thus, whatever mechanism is regularizing the spacing of these umbral 
dots is weaker than that for the granules." 

Expectedly, the laboratory Benard cells are indistinguishable from 
photospheric granules in their spacing. Furthermore, the umbral dots 
mapped by B and S are more evenly spaced than those mapped by A and 
K; "these maps, therefore, do not appear to represent the same phe- 
nomenon." Mysteries like this one warm the heart of your typical as- 
tronomer. For the moment, Lawrence is concerned about other things. 

The results of Lawrence's paper "are in agreement with that of Ad- 
jabshirzadeh, who compared two-dimensional Fourier transforms of 
granule and umbral dot patterns and found differences at spatial fre- 
quencies corresponding to scales of 1 to 2 arc seconds. Our result, how- 
ever, refers specifically to the distribution of granular and umbral dot 
features, while the Fourier transform method responds both to the fea- 
ture distributions and sizes, which are already known to be different." 

Who gives a hoot about umbral dots, photospheric granules, and all 
that? A quarter of the people who saw E. TP. The president of the United 
States? You? The answer in all cases is probably "nope." Wait! Before 
you skip over to DOStalk or Mind Your Business, take a good look at 
sunspots. It's enough to give you bad dreams. 

Acquitting the Weather Predictors. Sunspots are areas of intense 
magnetic fields. Sunspots rise and fall in abundance during an eleven- 
year period. At the end of each eleven-year cycle, the sun's general mag- 
netic field reverses polarity. Santa Claus is suddenly living at the South 
Pole. Thus you have a double sunspot cycle of twenty-two years. 

Through the use of dendrochronology (establishing dates of events 
from tree-ring patterns) and other esoteric methods, astronomers have 



been able to trace sunspot activity back before the Romans. The eleven- 
year cycle has been remarkably steady despite slight deviations. Unfor- 
tunately, remarkably steady isn't good enough. 

From roughly 1645 to 1715 the sun went through what is called the 
"Maunder Minimum." All traces of an eleven-year cycle disappeared. 
During this long period there was very Uttle sunspot activity overall, and 
most of Europe was in the grips of what has been called the Little 
Ice Age. 

There is no question that sunspots affect weather on the earth. The 
Great Plains area of the United States was hit by sipjck drought in 1815 
through 1818, 1842 through 1847, 1866 through 1869, 1890 through 
1892, 1912, 1934, 1953, 1976, and 1977. Every twenty-two years or so, in 
synchronization with the sun's magnetic twist, the West is pulverized by 
drought. Look for another bout around the turn of the century. 

"It's hard to explain. No one knows what's going on," says solar 
astronomer Gary Chapman. "The sun goes through little fluctuations. 
Sunspots are a skin effect, but they seem to affect the sun's total energy 
output." 

A solar astronomer since 1967, Chapman has been with the San Fer- 
nando Observatory for all but one year of its operational lifetime; long 
enough to see the facility change hands. Originally part of the Aerospace 
Company, the observatory (built in 1969) is now owned by California 
State University at Northridge. 

"There are two theories," he continues. "One claims that sunspots 
are like volcanoes, sucking energy in and out, upward and downward. The 
other maintains that sunspots are blocking energy, so that it can't get to 
the sun's surface. 

"We're studying the effects of sunspots on the sun's variability. They 
definitely change the total output in small amounts. Now we want to 
know what happens to the energy. Where does it go?" 

Driving Old Sol. Chapman, like his colleague Lawrence, has to travel 
a long road to find the answers, and that means analyzing a lot of data. 
The information in question comes from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
in the form of solar radiance observations taken from the Solar Maxi-

mum Mission. 

The key measurement here is watts per square meter. Chapman takes 
the observations from space and correlates them with theoretical models 
of sunspots. To do this he uses an Apple and the HSD Regress program 
from Human Systems Dynamics. 

"I've got the minimum system at the moment — no disk drive and no 
printer," says Chapman. "When I want to work with Regress, I borrow 
my next door neighbor's disk drive. I look forward to the day when I can 
upgrade, the system^ though the cassette tape deck has worked just fine 
so far." . . ., 

For both Chapman and Lawrence the Apple has been a godsend. 
Ask any engineer or scientist who works in a research facility with only 
large computer systems and you'll understand why. 

At the San Fernando Observatory the computer system is more than 
ten years old and it's only suited for specific, sophisticated tasks, like 
image processing. Personal computers are small and easy to use, perfect 
for the research scientist who needs more than just large-scale number- 
crunching. 

Lawrence and Chapman like their Apples so much that they want to 
make them a permanent fixture at the observatory. At the moment, the 
two solar astronomers have their Apples at home. The university defi- 
nitely supports the use of Apples; the physics and astronomy depart- 
ments share two dozen for instructing students. 

Publishing on Sun Standard Time. Chapman's work concerning the 
effect of sunspots on the sun's variability will eventually become part of a 
papjer. He's not announcing any conclusions at the moment, but that's 
not unusual. It's easy to look for something while doing research and 
then, once you've found it, stop looking. The dedicated researcher 
doesn't believe the sky is blue or rocks are hard until it's been verified six 
ways from Sunday. 

At last word. Chapman's paper count was thirty-five. "I'm still plan- 
ning to write a book on magnetic fields in the sun." He points to a pile of 
notes and charts for the half finished project. 

"Once or twice a year I get a letter from this technical book publish- 



er in Holland asking me, 'What about that book?' At this rate I'd need a 
six-month sabbatical, where I could hide away and work only on the 
book. My responsibilities at the observatory and university are a big 
drain in terms of time. I enjoy them, but my own projects get shoved 
aside." 

Earth Interfering. A rigorous academic schedule weighs down some 
solar astronomers. On a completely different level, volcanoes can dis- 
rupt the work of astronomers in a whole hemisphere. 

In March this year, the Mexican volcano El Chichon burst into ac- 
tion and within a week built to an explosive crescendo. On April 4 it 
launched a terrific stream of sulfur-rich ash and gas that reached as far as 
the stratosphere. Stuck there for a while, El Chidion's cloud is ^reading 
and will eventually cover the entire Northern Hemisphere. It's making 
work difficult for many solar astronomers. 

Regular clouds go away eventually. It rains, it snows, but next week 
it's clear again. El Chichon's cloud won't dissipate for at least a year. 
That it's blocking rays from the sun makes the cloud more than just a 
headache for solar astronomers. The cloud may lower the temperature 
between 0. 1 degree centigrade and 0.3 degree centigrade. This is a fair- 
ly significant drop, though no one knows exactly what will happen. 
Mount Saint Helens's effect on the temperature was less than 0.1 degree

On the Sunny Side of the Street. Weather and volcanoes aside for 
the time being, Lawrence and Chapman are steadily whittling away at 
the unknowns of solar science. Both have done their ovm programming, 
but packaged software has come in handy. Lawrence and Chapman are 
grateful to Human Systems Dynamics. Chapman has nothing but praise 
for Regress and Lawrence used the Stats program extensively. 

Actually, they didn't have far to go to find help. John Lawrence is 
married to Virginia Lawrence, founder of Human Systems Dynamics. 

Meanwhile, the sun shines and humans go about their business. 
Someday we may all be swept away by a bigger than usual belch from 
the sun. We're probably the by-product of cosmic indigestion anyway. 
Pleasant dreams.

6V K. O. CCKLAhP 

There's this fellow, you see, a little below me in things like creature 
smarts, spelling, wearing matching socks, and other things of conse- 
quence, but when it comes to computerese, my neck is getting stiff from 
always looking up at him. He is least interested in which side his hair 
looks best parted on, Marlboro Lights, form 1040s, Budweiser, Rocky 
III, how to fix a flat, who's in office with the city council or on third base 
with the Dodgers, and I get a distinct impression he recognizes the op- 
posite sex because they're the ones that dance backward. 

What he does care about is computers. His brain is pure Applesoft. It 
is a portable dumpster filled with singular jargon, miniature circuits, and 
schematics designed to fit on the head of a pin. He probably hasn't seen a 
syntax error in five years, poor soul, and he doesn't have to be reminded 
to close the disk drive door. His voice sounds a lot to me like machine 
language looks. He can not only read the DB Master manual but he un- 
derstands it. His milieu is a little section in the back of the local Apple 
shop, impressive with its multicolored ribbon cables, humming test 
equipment, and the aroma of frying electronics. He's the product of an 
age. And he scares me. 

Why? Because, simply stated, he is one of the thousands who set the 
pace. And they forget I've got this game leg. 

He and his kind got into computers when they were passing out bot- 
tom rungs, and there's no way that I or my kind will ever catch up. They 
all talk funny, they spend their time in the front sections of the maga- 
zines, they wouldn't be caught dead playing Snack Attack, and they all 



have to be booted to get them going. Strangely enough, we have de- 
veloped an odd sort of Archy and Mehitabel relationship, mainly be- 
cause he probably feels the same way about me as I do about him. To 
him, I am a side dish he hadn't ordered. Perhaps, deep within his ROM 
circuits, he feels a bit of empathy — pity, at least — for me. 

So, anyhow, in between repairing Apples and their umbilical accum- 
ulations, he dabbles in programs and assembling machine language in 
some understandable order. His latest creation is one that allows any 
nerd (me) to use a "pen" to draw harmless little squiggles or the Mom 
Lisa in hi-res graphics, to add type of any proportion I choose, and to 
wonder ultimately what I'm supposed to do with it all. 

"I'll make a dupe of my program," he volunteered. "Take it home 
with you and play with it. Give me your thoughts on it." Handing a gun 
to an idiot. 

"Fine," I agreed. "But only on one condition. If you ever decide to 
release this for public consumption, I get to do the manual." 

He looked almost relieved. So did I. We would have shaken on the 
pact except he had a small soldering iron in one hand and a peanut but- 
ter sandwich in the other and I didn't want either one leaving their mark 
on me. 

This overt act of benevolence on my part was sort of self-defensive in 
context. I wish I could write all the manuals. That way, I would undCT- 
stand all the manuals — and now we arrive with a thud at the part with 
the meat in this treatise. 

Divide the world of computerdom into two hemispheres — the nerds 
and the geniuses. Granted, there are subdivisions of this hypothesis butJ 
for now, let's work on understandable terms. Who write the programs

for this world? Right, the geniuses. Who sit in little rooms, devising the 
Raster Blasters and DB Master^ Right again. And who write the man- 
uals for the aforementioned? You got it, pal. 

Now, let's move across the border and put a glass on the guy who has 
a manual in his hand — the nerd. He has just spent the better part of his 
welfare check on a disk that will dehver whatever it promises in four col- 
ors on the package face, usually complete with half-dressed nymphets. 
The manual will be a bridge between the two continents, if the nerd can 
fathom anything past the page numbers. Chances are good he can't. 

Again, why? Because the geniuses are communicating with their own 
kind. They haven't the vaguest idea how to deal with a computer intel- 
lect less than their belt size, even though this represents perhaps some 
three-quarters of their audience. I speak with authority because I have 
not only been there, I am there. 

I have been the proud guardian of an Apple II for more than a year 
now and, although my talent and command of the art may impress one 
who is just now sticking a cautious toe in, I still dare not open my mouth 
around the local Apple shop for fear the real nerd will emerge in full col- 
or for all the geniuses to see. After a year, I am still befuddled by ma- 
chine language — I must cop a plea that the principal use for my Apple is 
word processing — and the best I can produce from my DB Master is a 
few address labels disproportionate to the cost of the package. 

A pity, really. I do want to understand the nuts and bolts more than I 
do but, short of signing up for an expensive course that will take me a bit 
further than I care to go, my expertise will be severely limited to articles 
such as this and some address labels. Oh, maybe I'll get the Mom Lisa 
done in hi-res color but damned if I know how to get my Epson to re- 
gard the work as more than a dry program listing. On the plus side, I 
have managed to poke around and alter a Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star 
program to where I can get my Apple to perform a reedy Bach fugue. 
However, I would love to poke once on my own and not wonder if this is 
the one that's going to produce blue smoke from inside the Apple. 

So, I am left quite alone in a world I never made — much less expect- 



ed — faced with magazines, manuals, and advertising geared to the 
geniuses. I am pitted against game paddles bearing instructions like: "Be 
sure to insert game paddle IC with colored dot facing toward the back of 
computer." Simple? Boy, I hope to kiss a crippled cricket that's simple. 
Only they forgot to put on a colored dot, assuming everybody knows by 
now which way they go in, I guess, 

I fastidiously copy a program from a magazine, devoting sevwal 
hours of my life to what turns out to be in Integer Basic instead of Ap- 
plesoft. How to modify it? No sweat — a summer course at MIT ought to 
take care of that dilemma. 

I can dazzle friends by bringing up a real clock face on the screen but 
have yet to figure out how to get a CPS card to tell an Epson what time it 
is in print. Oh, it's in the manual, I know, I know, but it isn't in nerd-talk. 

Perhaps the best example of a nerd-oriented chapbook is the one ac- 
companying the basic TRS-80, my introduction to computers. This one 
should be a standard of the industry by now for lucidity in communica- 
tion. By the time I was through the last chapter, I had, by God, mastered 
Basic and I even knew how to use loops and data. That someone had 
picked up on the idea was apparent with one other manual I got my 
hands on — it started out superfriendly. 

"Well," it smiled warmly at me from the first page, "we're going to 
have fun together, aren't we?" And then, while I was still wagging my 
tail, it proceeded to tell me I'd better put such-and-sudi at A$2000 and set 
himem. Problem. I didn't have two thousand bucks handy and I didn't 
remember where I had left himem lying the last time I might have used it. 
End of manual. Back to the nerd world. 

I see a few heads nodding out there, so I'm not alone. Perhaps all of 
us nodding nerds should get together and form a club, maybe offer to 
write all the manuals for the geniuses at a reduced rate. This way, we can 
honorably perpetuate our own species, maybe even gain an upper hand 
someday. I mean, can you picture what computers in everyday life would 
represent if everyone understood them? At least the handbooks? 

Why, it's positively whelming. 2W

No matter how you slice it, the only way you're 
going to know if a data handling program is 
right for you is by running it on your computer, 
solving your problems, your way. 

And the only database management sys- 
tem (DBMS) that lets you do that is dBASE II™ 

A DBMS like the mainframers have. 

Conceptually, dBASE II is a relational 
database management system, like the system 
IBM introduced on their mainframes last year. 

Practically, dBASE II is the most powerful 
DBMS made for a micro. It handles multiple 
databases on a single drive and simplifies every- 
thing from accounting to project management 
to monitoring rainfall on the Upper Volta. 

With a word or two, you CREATE data- 
bases, APPEND new data instantly, UPDATE, 
MODIFY and REPLACE fields, records and 
entire databases. Organize months worth of data 
in minutes with the built-in REPORT. Do sub- 
field and multi-field searches, then DISPLAY 
some or all of the data for any conditions you 
want to apply. 

And you've just begun to tap the power 
of dBASE II. 

Easy to look at^ easy to use. 

Input screens and output forms couldn't 
be easier— just "paint" your format on the CRT 
and what you see is what you'll get. 

You can do automatic calculations on 
fields, records and databases, accurate to 10 digits. 





And you can use dBASE II interactively 
for instant answers. Or save your instructions 
and automate your data handling with two words: 
DO Finances, DO Rainfall, DO whatever has 
to be done. 

Use dBASE II to help make your choice: 

Instead of asking you to pore over a 
manual, we'll let you try dBASE II free for 30 days. 

Send us $400 and we'll send you a copy 
of dBASE II that you can run on a 48k Apple with

vertisement for the Word Handler II, written 
and distributed by Silicon Valley Systems. I saw 
the product in a retail store and found that 
Word Handler II provides more capabilities 
than Screenwriter II, does not require addi- 
tional hardware, and was less expensive. People 
without a computer background (like my wife) 
find it easy and fun to use. 

And I want to tell other Apple owners 
about the excellent service provided by Silicon 
Valley Systems. They have been extremely re- 
sponsive in clarifying product features and sin- 
cerely interested in feedback and suggestions for 
product enhancement. The value of my soft- 
ware investment is leveraged by their policy of 
free updates. Silicon Valley Systems has taken a 
novel approach in this industry; they back up 
their product with really first-rate customer serv- 
ice. Word Handler II is an excellent software 
product. I have found it to be easy to use and 
very rehable, incorporating most of the features 
of so-called professional word processors. 
(Name withheld by request) 

Right Over Write 

In reply to the question of George Forde, Jr., in 
August Open Discussion regarding word proc- 
essors: Switch to Screenwriter II. Apple Writer 
was written by Paul Lutus, a brilliant and ec- 
centric programmer. Unfortunately I don't be- 
lieve he fully understood what someone using 
the Apple for word processing might require. 
On the other hand, ScreenWriter II is pro- 
grammed for the professional or business writ- 
er but can be used by anyone willing to spend 
time learning its intricacies. Another choice 
(and it's my preference) is the new 40/56/70 
version of Super-Text. Replying to Gary Grif- 
fis's complaint that Super-Text files can't be 
sent by modem, with this new version, they 
can be. 

G. R. Brieger, Redmond, WA 

Gift Horse Gripe — No Triple Crown 

Just a few words about the most popular word 
processor for the unadulterated Apple II. Sier- 
ra On-Line has updated their popular Super- 
Scribe II and renamed it ScreenWriter II. The 
original program was as buggy as a Houston 
kitchen in the summer, but the new version has 
gotten rid of the worst of the old bugs and re- 
placed them with some of its own. I am writing 
to inform your readers of a bug in the docu- 
mentation. The solution to this problem cost me 
several hours and two calls to California. 

The documentation speaks of ScreenWriter 
IPs supporting alternate character sets. They 
then give a couple of lines to be added to the 
program called APP2. The lines will not work 
unless one adds the same command again as 
line 9820. In other words, new lines should be 



S S I O H 



added as 7820, 8820, and 9820, each reading 
print D$;"bload (diaracter set name), A$COO". 
After the program APP2 has been saved, the 
routine Customize must be run again. No new 
information is required in Customize, but it must 
be run again to cause the new version of the 
program to become a part of the loading cycle. 
If you are using character sets from the DOS 
Tool Kit, then the address given in the lines 
mentioned above must be changed to $D00. 
(This may be true of other character sets as well, 
but I have had no opportunity to try them.) 

None of this information is in the docu- 
mentation for the program and it requires con- 
siderable effort to find it out. Remember that 
the character set must be run through the pro- 
gram Upside Down before it is usable by Screen- 
Writer II. I would recommend copying the 
character set onto a separate disk and then run- 
ning Upside Down, saving the new upside-down 
version of the character set to the extra disk and 
then using FID to copy it to the ScreenWriter II 
program disk, since the program disk is very 
full. 

Screen Writer II is a powerful but frustrat- 



ing program providing most of the features of a 
dedicated word processor for the basic Apple II 
without additional hardware. It is annoying to 
have to make up a new name for a file each time 
you change a comma. It is equally annoy- 
ing to have to run a dummy file just to be able 
to catalog the text file disk if you load the edi- 
tor without checking the contents of the disk 
first. It is downright dangerous to have a pro- 
gram that will overwrite your output file in the 
process of saving it. There is even an error mes- 
sage to inform you that this has taken place, so 
it must have been something the authors took 
into account when they were working on the 
program. All this can be avoided if one is rich 
enough to have two disk drives and a 16K 
RAM card. The ostensibly economical Screen- 
Writer II should have been built to operate safe- 
ly with the unimproved Apple II, as its advertis- 
ing would have us believe.

New-Breed Appiers Hatching 

Microcomputers are beginning to find their way 
into every walk of life. I moved from California 
about three years ago and bought a chicken 
farm. We raise breeding hens to provide hatch- 
ing eggs to a hatchery for the purpose of pro- 
viding baby chicks to the many broiler farms in 
the area. I prepare reports on my Apple that 
help me keep tabs on just what's happening 
with my flock. Each day I enter nineteen fields 
of data regarding the day's activities and use 
that data to create my reports. I wrote the pro- 
gram myself, and I'm attempting to start a small 
computer service for people in the area. In my 
spare time I write for Nibble. We also have a

Valid Comparisons? 

The story on Apple's Apples (June Softalk) 
caught my eye. Such hyprocrisy! Super among 
the super software protectors, Apple people bla- 
tantly talk about how active they are when rip- 
ping off the copyrighted materials of any and all 
printed matter via the copy machine and 
modem. I suppose it depends upon whose ox is 
being gored. Maybe Call-A.P.P.L.E. and the 
rest should include in their copyright notice that 
their articles can only be read by the registered 
pair of bifocals, as do some software houses in 
their "licenses." 

Milton Gussow, Lake Villa, IL 

After reading that software companies cry over 
the practice of businesses purchasing only one 
copy of a program and making many addition- 
al copies for the use of their employees, I was 
struck by the practices at Apple Computer. It's 
no wonder computer users engage in piracy 
when it is practiced in the highest levels of com- 
puter companies themselves.

Presidential Pratfalls 

To Jonathan Miller In your article on word 
processing (June Softalk) you accused Jimmy 
Carter of putting his foot in his mouth (which 
he did on numerous occassions), but he is not 
guilty of the charge listed in your article. To my 
recollection, it was Gerald Ford who commit- 
ted the faux pas, and the real culprit was the in- 
terpreter on his staff who was guilty of getting 
his tongue twisted around his teeth. You may 
be an expert in word processing, but history 
isn't your bag.

Historical Corrections 

A disturbing rewrite of history is appearing on 
the pages of several magazines lately. A recent 
example appeared in Phillip Good's article, 
"Fritz the Cat Has an Apple II," in your May is- 
sue. Mr. Good presents an interesting chronicle 
of the events and people that laid the ground- 
work for the personal computer revolution. He 
seems extraordinarily myopic, however, about 
simultaneous developments that weren't even 
over the horizon from Palo Alto. For his (and 
your readers') enlightenment, I recommend the 
June 1975 issue of The Journal of Community 
Communications. Two articles are of interest. 

In the first I describe the Community 
Memory Project which in 1973 and 1974 pro- 
duced a very powerful electronic bulletin board 
system (the first) and put a lot of computer 
power in the hands of total computer illiterates 
in several San Francisco and Berkeley store- 
front locations. We, and later Bob Albrecht's 
People's Computer Company, were the first to 
demonstrate that the average person might ac- 
tually have a use for a computer. 

The second article describes Lee Felsen- 
stein's design for a convivial, intelligent terminal 
for Community Memory and electronic bulletin 
board use. The design predates even the Altair 
and the Imsai. Later it evolved into the first 
computer with an integrated keyboard and vid- 
eo output: the Processor Technology SOL, 
which was in full production when Apple was 
still just selling boards. 

The Journal of Community Communications 
is slicker now, but still the only place to read 
consistently worthwhile articles on where all this 
is leading us. The Community Memory Project 
has written and just released Sequitur, probably 
the best database system for micros on the mar- 
ket. Both are still nonprofit, and still struggling, 
but doing good work, fighung the good fight. 
Now that Jobs and Wozniak have their billion, 
I hope they can finally relax and remember 
some of the things they learned at Midpenin- 
sula Free University.

Teacher Seeks Pilot 

As an Apple user and a computer education 
teacher, I was pleased to see the addition of 
Schoolhouse Apple by Jean Varven. I think that 
educational applications is an area that is at least 
as important as business or recreafional soft- 
ware coverage in your magazine. An entirely 
new category should be added to Fastalk in 
which programs designed for educational use

would be listed and described. Quality pro- 
grams such as Magic Crossword, Apple Shell 
Games, and the Apple Pilot family could be 
included. 

Many educators find selecting software to 
be a difficult task, not because they do not 
know what they are looking for, but because it 
is difficult to find a reliable source for evalua- 
tion. Obviously, the best way to select software 
is to view and use it personally. This is not as 
easy to do as it sounds. Typically, local com- 
puter stores stock very little (if any) software for 
educational use. Other sources of information 
for software selection are advertisements, de- 
sCTiptions in software catalogs, and evaluation 
service books. I think that your evaluation and 
rating system offers greater reliability than other 
readable sources that I have described. How 
about it? 

In August Mind Your Business, I read 
about the programs in the Apple Pilot family in- 
cluding Co-Pilot, Apple Super Pilot, and Apple 
Super Pilot Log. Why hasn't this software been 
released for sale? Apple has already provided 
promotional copies to various organizations for 
evaluation months ago. I could use the addi- 
tions to the Apple Pilot family now. Where are 
they? 

Robert Hofemann, San Jose, CA 

These programs in the Apple Pilot family 
should be available for purchase by the time you 
read this. , 

One Considered Opinion 

I am really appalled by the tortuous, over- 
blown, and opaque writing style of Jim Sal- 
mons's June Exec article. Please have him read 
a style manual, or better, use other writers. I 
love your magazine and recommend it to many 
of my friends. Thank you for considering my 
opinion.

Grappling with the Dip Switch 

I have just purchased an Epson MX-lOO print- 
er and an Orange Micro Grappler interface for 
my Apple II. I am now in the market for a good 
word processor (I am using Apple Pascal to 
write this letter). Among the processors that I 
am considering is the Super-Text II. A friend 
has shown me how it works and 1 have tried it 
on my system. There are apparently two prob- 
lems with the interface. 

First, I have been unable to control the au- 
tomatic line feed after carriage returns by soft- 
ware. 1 can set the dip switch in the Epson to get 
them, but this will foul up the works with Basic 
and Pascal. The instructions with my interface 
say to send a control-IA to get line feeds ap-

Additions to the Deleter 

I have made some improvements to the Excess 
File Deleter program that appeared in August 
Softalk: 

First, it would be advantageous to be able to 
move the cursor to copy the file name when cat- 
aloguing the disk. I use control-A to catalog. 

Now, if you are like me, you'll need some- 
thing to remind you what the special com- 
mands are. Line 20 takes care of that. 

The final change is a routine that handles 
the input of the file name following a catalog. 
The end resuk is that you don't have to type in 
every file name you wish to delete, but you still 
may do so if you desire.

THE NORMAL EXPECTATIONS 
OF SMALL BUSINESS 



All too often our normal 
expectations for small business 
financial reporting are "logically 
abnormal". We limit our finan- 
cial reporting activity to satisfy- 
ing the needs of the IRS. Kept 
hidden in most fmancials is val- 
uable information waiting to be 
found to assist us in managing 
our business more profitably. 
Our normal expectations dictate 
that the cost and difficulty of 
organizing and reporting such 
valuable information will pre- 
vent its access. 

Likewise, most general ledger 
systems for the Apple II invari- 
ably restrict themselves to assist- 
ing us in satisfying the IRS . . . 
and not much more. 

ACU=LEDGER, a newly in- 
troduced Financial Manage- 
ment System, represents a dra- 
matic departure from the ""norm". 

ACU=LEDGER simultaneously 

addresses: 

= General Ledger Requirements 

(IRS. etc.) 
= Product Profitability Analysis 

(Job Cost) 

(with automatic proration of 
'overhead burden') 

= Financial Budgeting, Forecast- 
ing, and Modeling 

= Automatic Depreciation 
Scheduling/ Posting (including 
A.C.R.S.) 

= Instantaneous, upon demand 
(on line) inquiry 

- Two Accounting Months 
"open" simultaneously 

- Full Year's detail entries 
retained on the current file 



Moreover, ACU=LEDGER al- 
lows you to describe your vi- 
sion of your environment (em- 
phasizing Marketing, Opera- 
tions, both, etc.). You can even 
describe your environment em- 
phasizing one aspect, period- 
ically re-organize to emphasize 
another, produce the manage- 
ment reports, and switch back to 
the original 'profile' — or stay 
with the new! 



All of this is done within an 
integrated, logical universe (no 
costly redundant input for "Bud- 
get vs. Actual" Reporting, etc.). 
In fact, your bookkeepers' skills 
will improve because they use 
ACU^LEDGER (many book- 
keepers' present difficulties are 
directly traceable to a problem 
in finding the "logical thread" 
that holds the current system 
together). 



ACU^LEDGER's logical struc- 
ture is easily matched by its 
technical sophistication, viz.: 

= Produces many times more 
reports than competitive systems 
(up to 289 unique P&L's, daily if 
you choose) 

= Stores many times more entries 
than any competitive system 

= Has multiple techniques for 
most functions (may use any or 
all of 4 methods to post entries) 

- Extremely efficient — One test 
"closed" one day's 3.440 
"entry-sides" in 2'/: minutes! 



ACU=LEDGER is so versa- 
tile that it can be operated in a 
very restrictive manner (mini- 
mal skill level); or it can be 
operated utilizing all of its 
advanced features (or any- 
where in between). Migration 
from one level to another can 
be effected as you become 
familiar with ACU^LEDGER; 
and comfort can be taken in the 
recognition that as your needs 
change, ACU=LEDGER can 
change with you.

pended. I have not been able to do this, even 
when I use the user-definable keys that are avail- 
able in Super-Text II. Secondly, if I do flip the 
dip switch, the output on the printer has ran- 
domly placed large spaces inserted, really goof- 
ing up the right margin and the appearance. 
These blanks even may appear in the middle of 
words. 

Is there an incompatibility of Super-Text II 
and the Grappler that prevents their common 
use? Clearly this is a problem that would have 
to be cleared up before I could purchase and use 
a copy of Super-Text II. I would appreciate any 
information I could get on this.

In One Era and out the Other 




Last fall, I wrote Softalk a letter describing how 
I was using antique paper apple box labels to 
decorate my Apple den. I have finally quit pro- 
crastinating and took some photographs of the 
finished product showing my Apple II, oak roll- 
top desk, and the apple label background. They 
make an excellent and colorful background for 
my Apple as well as good conversation pieces. 
A future addition will be a 1905 red brass Na- 
tional cash register, model number 49 y4. Nos- 
talgia alongside modern technology the best of 
two eras.

A Side Road on the Advancing Path 

The value range error uncovered by E. R. Mill- 
er (July Open Discussion) can be a tremendous 
help in Pascal program development, but there 
is virtually no information about it in the vari- 
ous Apple manuals. Basically, this error mes- 
sage occurs when, during program execution, 
an attempt is made to assign a value to a vari- 
able that is outside a permissible range of values 
for that variable. This will happen whenever a 
program encounters an attempt to insert a value 
exceeding a variable's previously defined sub- 
range. Here is a brief example: 

Program Test; 
Var 

I : 1..10; 



Key : Integer; 
Begin 

Readin (Key); 
I := Key; 
Writein (I) 

End. 

Try this while inputting values between one 
and ten and everything is fine. But enter any 
other number and you get the value range error 
when the interpreter attempts to assign that 
number to I. 

The beauty of this range checking scheme is 
that, by careful consideration of the possible 
values a given variable may assume and appro- 
priate designation of subranges, the program- 
mer can build into his or her program the 
means to easily detect some of the more subtle 
bugs that creep into program development. This 
can be especially useful when one is trying to de- 
termine the correct termination point for while 
loops and repeat loops. The more subtle pro- 
gram design message is that, once again, Pascal 
forces us to think out our programs before we 
write them. 

In terms of actually finding the error point, I 
highly recommend the use of the compiler list- 
ing option (see Apple Pascal Language Refer- 
ence Manual, pages 64 to 66), which will gen- 
erate a "road map" to enable one to decipher 
the "S#, P#, I#" message. On single drive sys- 
tems, large programs may be difficult to com- 
pile with this option because of limited disk 



space. The use of the {*$L printer:*} directive is 
recommended for those with printers. 
R. Paul Miller, Sacramento, CA 

Another reader clarifies fidrther: 

The value range error message indicates that a 
variable with a certain valid range of values has 
been asked to take on a value outside that 
range. In order to understand where in the pro- 
gram this is happening, you need to compile 
with the listing option on. Generally, either the 
printer or a file is used for the listing. For the 
printer, insert f * $L printer: *} as the first line of 
your program. For a listing to be produced on a 
file, insert (* $L+ *) or (* $L filename.text *j as 
the first line of the program; the first produces a 
listing as SYSTEM. LST.TEXT. An example of 
this is: 

(* $L printer: *) 
program Bomb; 
var X: array[1..5] of integer; 

I: integer; 
procedure BlowUp; 
begin 

for I := 1 to 6 do 
begin 

X[l] := I * I; 

writeInC I = ',1:2/ X = ',X[I]:2) 
end 

end;(*BlowUp*)

The error message indicates segment #1,

tion #16 occurs after 1 1 and before 25 so it is in 
the statement X[I] := 1*1. Instruction is the

The range error has occurred because an array 
that is only supposed to be 1 through 5 has 
been assigned the value 6. 
Rich Hatcher, Piano, TX 

Meeting Beasties on the Trail 

I thought all the explanations of the value range 
error sent in by readers were great, and I'd like 
to amplify a couple of points that were made. 

All expression values, even those of sub- 
ranges, are computed as full integers. Only af- 
ter an expression has been completely eval- 
uated is subrange checking applied to it. You 
may think of the assignment operator as a sieve 
that allows datum values within range to pass 
through to a storage location, but catches and 
holds out-of-range values. This "watchdog- 
ging" does not come free; the compiler auto- 
matically emits p-code instructions for range 
checking which require time and space to do 
their job. The p-code versions of some pro- 
grams might be much smaller, and could exe- 
cute much more quickly, without the extra 
range-checking code. At the programmer's dis- 
cretion range checking may be eliminated, but 
this is an exceedingly dangerous practice and is 
recommended only for master programmers 
who wish to optimize the execution of pro- 
grams that they believe to be correct and ro- 
bust. Those who wish to experiment with this 
aspect of the system, and who are not afraid of 
the system crashes that their tinkering might 



cause, may read how to defeat range checking 
in the Apple Pascal Language Reference Man- 
ual (page 67). 

The (*$L printer:*} directive, mentioned by 
R. Paul Miller, is a specific instance of a com- 
piler directive. Normally the compiler ignores 
comments, but comments that begin with a dol- 
lar sign are treated as instructions to the com- 
piler. Apple's official documentation explains 
what compiler directives are and how they are 
used in some detail. The Pascal Path will also 
cover this topic in the months ahead; whether it 
is addressed sooner or later depends on reader 
demand. 

The most frequent question I've ever been 
asked about compiler directives is, "What is 
$U-?" Unfortunately, the answer entails open- 
ing several large cans of worms that are better 
left undisturbed until the questioner is at least a 
journeyman programmer and completely fa- 
miliar with both the elementary and the many ad- 
vanced aspects of the Apple Pascal system. 
Judging from the letters I've seen, I expiect that 
most followers of the Pascal Path are well on 
their way to this level of expertise; we should be 
able to look into the matter within the next few 
months. A deluge of mail might convince me to 
tackle the beast even sooner!

Filedump Follies 

Personal Finance Manager came with my sys- 
tem and it has one major flaw: I cannot read the 
data file with my Basic programs. Filedump 
utility (Cail-A.P.P.L.E.) immediately gets an 
end-of-file indication and prints nothing. The 
length of the random-access text file is not docu- 
mented. I filed an Apple user input report, and 
Apple said thanks but gave me no help on ac- 
cessing my data. I find it legitimate for authors 
to protect their programs but unacceptable for 
them to lock up my data so that I cannot access 
it. Softalk reviews should indicate whether a 
user can access data files with their own pro- 
grams. Vendors should be required to docu- 
ment the formats of the data files. After all, the 
data does belong to the user. Does anyone have 
a method for reading the PFM data file?

Not So Goodspell 

Can anyone help with the problem of saving the 
words one has added to Goodspell to one's own 
disk? Even if one has to load two disks, it is far 
better than retyping the additions by hand each 
time you write a letter. I cannot understand 
how a program with the severe limitations of 
Goodspell ever made the top ten in Softalk.

Ratzburg (June Open Discussion). I bought my

Apple a little over two years ago. It has the 16K 
RAM configuration blocks (Apple Reference 
Manual, page 70), and it also has the piggyback 
encoder card with the reset protection switch on 
the keyboard. How can I tell what revision my 
computer is, as this is usually necessary infor- 
mation when ordering a lower-case adapter?

Inside Operator 

Where can I get more detailed information on 
the operating system, such as internal registers, 
than that which is provided in the reference 
manual?

Necessary Paperwork 

Warren Michelsen's praise of Videx in July 
Open Discussion deserves to be echoed. I also 
have a Videoterm eighty-column board and the 
Enhancer II. This pair constitutes a very pleas- 
ant enhancement of the Apple Pascal system. 
The only minor difficulty is that it is hard to fit 
the Enhancer and the numeric keypad by The 
Keyboard Company into the same machine at 
the same time, although it can be done. I found 
that they actually abut one another, and must 
interfere with each other electronically (pre- 
sumably by shorting circuits) unless one puts 
some sort of insulation between the two. Just a 
simple piece of paper was all that was required 
to make things work satisfactorily.

I also agree with the reader who com- 
mented that an editorial response would be 
nice, although his complaint that there is a three 
month lag between a letter being written and its 
appearance in the magazine is a little bit of an 
exaggeration.

Lo-Reser 

The commercial drivers I have will dump onto a 
printer only hi-res graphics. Is there a commer- 
cially available driver that will print out lo-res 
graphics? Another problem encountered deals 
with keeping the lo-res page one image intact. If 
text is typed, the image is destroyed. Is there a 
way to get back to text mode without bombing 
lo-res page one graphics? I have an Apple II 
Plus with IDS445G and Prism 80 printers. Can 
anyone help?

Getting in Touch 

I am sixteen years old and I want to go to a 
computer camp, but I haven't had much luck. If 
possible, I would like to be a counselor or as- 
sistant at a camp. I live in New Jersey and 
wouldn't mind going to New York, Pennsyl- 
vania, or even Connecticut. Can anyone please 
help me with some leads, suggestions, or ad- 
vice? 

Also, I read in August Softalk about the 
touch screen system used on Catalina Island. 
Who can I contact to get more information 
about this system? 
Rizwan Ali, Hazlet, NJ 

The Touch Screen is manufactured by Touch 
Technology, Number 3 Church Circle, Annapo- 
lis, MD 21401: their phone number is (301 ) 269- 
8838. Your best bet would be to contact them 
directly for specifics on the system.

The Beginning of the End 

I thought your readers might be interested in 
something that happened to me several weeks 
ago. In fact, some of them may even be able to 
offer suggestions in getting out of a rather pe- 
culiar dilemma I find myself in. 

It all started when I was walking down Ven- 
tura Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley, Los 
Angeles, California. I came across a large com- 
puter store which had apparently just opened. 
The name of the place was Nesting(O) Comput- 
ers. I couldn't make much out of the name but I 
did notice that they had a large banner in the 
window advertising a new computer game. I 
think it was called Mad Venture or Sad Venture 
or something like that. 




OCTOBER 1982 S C) P T A L k p 231 



Intrigued, I went inside and asked if it might 
be possible to try out the new game that was ad- 
vertised so prominently in the window. The 
salesman said that he would be delighted to 
have me try out this amazing new program and I typed sure. 
immediately led me over to a very nice-looking 
computer system of a type I had never seen be- 
fore. He had me sit down at the console and 
type run Mad Venture (or whatever), and then 
he went off to help some other customers. 

The disk whirred and clicked for a few sec- 
onds and then the following text appeared on 
the screen: 



You are inside tlie store. A salesman asks you 
if you want to try out the new ganne. 



The salesman has you sit down at a computer 
and type run Sad Venture (or whatever), and 
then he goes off to help some other custom- 
ers. The computer prints out: 



"It's a beautiful Saturday in September, and 
you are out for a stroll on Ventura Boule- 
vard . . ." 



It's a beautiful Saturday in September, and 
you are out for a stroll on Ventura Boulevard. 
You are just walking along, minding your own 
business, when all of the sudden you spot a 
new computer store where just yesterday Fat 
Jack's Hamburgers stood. 

Enter command: 

I typed look store, and the computer respond- 
ed with: 

The name of the store is Nesting(l) Comput- 
ers and there are advertisements plastered all 
over the window for some game called Bad 
Venture. 



Well, there was something about that name that 
sounded familiar but I couldn't quite place it. 
Anyway, I figured I better go in so I typed enter 
store. 



By this time I was beginning to catch on to what 
was happening, but I also was getting a little bit 
confused. 

Before I knew it, 1 was standing in front of 
Nesting(12) Computers. At this point I was 
really starting to get worried. I decided that I 
had had enough of this and that I had better 
change my tactics. I did go into Nesting(12) 
Computers, but when the salesman asked me if 
1 would like to try out their new game I replied 
that I most definitely would not! 

He looked a little hurt but maintained his 
friendly demeanor, asking me if there was any- 
thing else he could help me with. For a mo- 
ment I couldn't think of just what to say and 
there was a brief, embarrassing silence. But then 
it hit me. I knew exactly what I had to do. With 
great enthusiasm I asked the salesman if he 
could possibly show me exactly how to end a 
game of Sad Venture. 



"You mean Bad Venture." he asked. 
"Whatever." 

"Well, look," he began, "first, why don't 
you just sit down here and let me show you how 
to start the game." 

"No, no!" I interrupted. And I began try- 
ing to explain, as coherently as I could, that I 
was already playing the game in another com- 
puter store called Nesting(ll) Computers. Ac- 
tually, in several different stores, but, in any 
event, he was just a character in one of the 
games and . . . 

During the ride to the hospital I was given a 
nice storybook to read, something about a tor- 
toise and a university professor arguing the mer- 
its of New Wave music. 

It had become clear to me at this point that 
there was no straightforward way of getting 
back to Nesting(0) Computers. During the next 
few days I even began to wonder if it was really 
all that important. Aside from the name of one 
particular computer store, everything in this 
world was pretty much the same as I remem- 
bered it. 

Anyway, I decided to just play it cool and 
hope for the best. After I was released from the 
hospital I went back to work, and generally 
tried to immerse myself in the routine of every- 
day life. Still, I can't help wondering if there 
might be somebody out there who has gone 
through a similar experience. Possibly even 
someone who has found out a way to end the 
game.

OCTOBER 1982 




BY DAVID mm 



Rubbing sleep from his eyes, Roy Hamilton recalled the little girl 
with the flower in Singer of the Spheres. Roy had played the computer 
game before, through several different characters; never had the little girl 
appeared. Very odd. He checked Arthur Singbold's inventory. 

Sure enough. There was a white rose along with holy books, prayers, 
unholy spells, unholy books, weapons, and survival gear. Roy led Ar- 
thur Singbold up a wind-whipped, icy road through Croakinet Crevice 
on the way to King Xorba's castle. 

It was a pitch-black night in the computer, a vulnerable situation for 
Arthur. Roy, expecting trouble, became wary and watched the monitor 
intensely, hands lightly poised on the keyboard. 

The slowly moving picture on the screen showed Arthur's point of 
view as he walked in a cavernous forest. It was cold in the mountains. 
Arthur approached a fallen tree that was blocking the path. Roy tensed 
with anticipation, holding in mind at once the exact position of each 
weapon command. 

Disturbed from sleeping peacefully on the tree, a Leapkit suddenly 
sprang up with an unnerving shriek. Illuminated for a moment by Ar- 
thur's helmet light, it bounded off into the moonless night. Leapkits are 
harmless forest creatures that usually mind their own business; they sleep 
heavily and awaken noisily as this one had. Killing one by reflex means 
being haunted by its spirit later in the game. Roy/ Arthur held his fire. 

Momentarily relieved, Roy leaned back. He directed Arthur to eat 
some food. The bright, sunlit room seemed to grow colder. Roy sensed 
something else was about to happen in the game. A cloud passed in front 
of the sun. Roy was totally absorbed in the computer world. 

Singbold looked up from his hasty meal and saw two faint lights ap- 
pear far off in the forest. They waved and dipped like fireflies. But there 
are no fireflies in winter. This must be some faery apparition. 

Gradually the silence was broken by the computer's audio synthe- 
sizer whispering distant laughing and shouting. The faery lights were 
definitely getting closer and the laughter grew louder with them. 
Roy/Arthur activated his all-purpose personal protection field, good for 
one minute. 

The faeries — Roy wasn't sure now just what they were — approached 
rapidly. Darting through the trees, they seemed to be racing each other. 
Roy thought they were flying, as most faeries are wont to do. When they 
zoomed by fifty feet from Singbold, he saw they were skiing. Two hu- 
manlike skiers with bright helmet torches. They didn't seem interested in 
Singbold. 

Roy/Arthur switched off the force field and scratched his head. He 
could still hear faint shouting and laughing but couldn't make out any 
words. The phantom skiers dipped and disappeared. An uncontrollable 
shiver raced up Roy's spine to his crown. He looked wildly about the 
room. Arthur drew his hand laser. 

In a moment, Roy/ Arthur was calm again. 

"Good Albion and Xorba's holy trousers!" they both whispered. 
This game never gave me the shivers before. 

Roy paused by putting Singbold to sleep, protected by a light warn- 



ing shield, and walked downstairs to the kitchen. Fear leads to hunger, 
he vowed to remember. 

The rest of the day's playing was not so unusual. Singbold awakened 
to a new day and continued his journey, eventually getting through 
the tough part of the mountain pass with little incident. 

But, in an abandoned cabin, Singbold met again the little girl who 
had given him the rose. This time she introduced herself as Susie and said 
she was just one of many, like her, that true singers will encounter. She 
gave him a photograph of herself. Susie smiled and then walked through 
the wooden wall. 

Slightly bewildered from this encounter, Roy/ Arthur searched for the 
best path down the mountain. Susie and the strange encounters faded 
from his consciousness as he concentrated on the terrain; but, once he 
found the right path, he discovered he was in a good mood. Roy direct- 
ed Arthur to burst forth in a glorious song of love and youth. He enter- 
tained the mountains and the spirits therein. 

That night Roy told his cousin Jeff about the skiers in the game. 

"Skiing at night. Sounds like a stunt Jim and Eric would pull," Jeff 
said thoughtfully. 

The computer game quickly passed away as a subject of conversa- 
tion. Jeff and Roy decided to watch an old movie on the big living room 
monitor. 



An ethereal force tugging at Roy's brain awakened him the next 
morning. The girl Susie and the phantom skiers were out of place in 
Singer of the Spheres. They were too ordinary. Roy couldn't find an ex- 
planation; you just didn't meet little girls who give you flowers and pho- 
tos and talk in riddles. There were plenty of dwarves, elves, midgets, fish, 
squirrels, spirits, ghosts, and little boys to talk to, but no little girls. And 
the skiers were just too subtle an effect (though exquisitely executed) for 
even thirty megabytes of gaming world. 

Almost from the moment he arrived at his uncle's house, Roy felt 
mysterious forces in the air. Staying up here has never been quite like this 
before. 

Two days before Roy had been dropped off by his girl friend Mela- 
nie, who couldn't afford to take five days off from her job. For Roy this 
was supposed to be a much-needed rest after completing a rough spring 
quarter in college. 

His uncle Martin and aunt Mary were lecturing overseas; Roy had 1 
been greeted by their youngest son Jeff. They had shaken hands. Unbid- \ 
den memories had flashed through Roy's mind of countless other vaca- - 
tions with his three cousins. ] 

Jeff had seemed genuinely glad to see Roy, but there was a moodi- ■ 
ness to his manner that Roy hadn't seen before. For half an hour they ■ 
had exchanged news and rumors. Roy had had much to relate about the ■ 
latest computer products, but Jeff hadn't seemed interested. 

Roy had marked well the pained look on Jeffs face when he sudden- :

ly grew morose and said: "Jim and Eric would probably be incredible 
compudesigners if they were still alive." After a moment, Jeff had ex- 
cused himself to prepare for a night with his friends. 

Left alone, Roy had wandered through the house and pondered the 
past. Ten years ago he had played with the three sons of Martin Hamil- 
ton all over the mountainside and this house. At one time all four shared 
a passion for small computers, playing and creating with them in the 
game room. It's 1992. Seems like yesterday, but years have passed. 

The second day, sitting amid the soft sunlight in the bedroom once 
belonging to the oldest son Jim, looking occasionally away from the 
monitor through the big window that framed this wilderness wonder- 
land, Roy had decided there was no better way to start a vacation. That 
he would begin a summer job next week made this time in the moun- 
tains doubly dear. 

His uncle's house was equipped with four main computer stations 
networked with ample storage and big and little computing power. What 
had started as a single microcomputer more than fifteen years ago had 
turned into a large-scale hobby. 

Computers figured very prominently in Roy's life. He was using 
them and studying them. Seaside College required word processing for 
all papers and other academic work. Roy owned his own microcomput- 
er and a library of software programs. 

Around noon that day he had decided to take a break. The super 
home computer's screen had seemed to welcome Singer of the Spheres — 
the newest mystical-science adventure game. The computer had hummed 
joyfully and Roy had plunged eagerly into the game's world; his goal in 
the game was to discover the secrets of heaven, go there, and return. 

With a style somewhere between Tolkien and Jack Vance, Singer of 
the Spheres came complete with long stretches of real-time action and ex- 
tremely lifelike and realistic characters, though on the whole it was out of 
this world. A terrific challenge, the game had its own mythology and 
rules. Death was not final. 

It had happened when Roy was listening intently to an ill-mannered 



street dwarf, trying to find out what the Upper Angel said to King Xorba 
before the angel flew away to Albion. He had felt someone walk up be- 
hind him. On the screen, a sweet-faced urchin had come silently up to 
Roy's character and offered him a flower. Arthur Singbold took it. The 
muckish dwarf had run off with a snort. The girl had vanished. 

Roy had turned to find Jeff looking over his shoulder with a smirk. 
And that had been the first encounter with Susie. These thoughts rum- 
bled around in his mind as Roy got ready to play the game again. 



Flipping a small red lever over an on/off label booted the Rosebud 
VI super home system. Roy inserted a blue packet about the size and 
shape of a small pocket watch in what looked like an overgrown coin slot 
on an arcade game machine. Once again the computer seemed to hum 
joyfully, as if the game had put it in a good mood. 

Three hours later, Roy sat frozen in his seat. The air was warm in the 
room. He was dressed in Seaside College aqua shorts and a cut-off white 
T-shirt. It seemed like a skeleton's hand stroked his left leg. Every hair on 
his body stood on end. A thundering attack of the chills. 

He could feel another presence in the room. It was like a soft breeze. 
There was no one else you could see. The air pressure changed and his 
ears popped. 

On the screen, in the computer, Singbold was once again traveling at 
night, this time on a deserted street toward the center of the city Ram 
Stand. King Xorba's castle towered in the distance, illuminated by faery 
globes. 

"This is crazy," Roy whispered to himself / don't like to be scared. 

Roy/ Singbold keyed/ walked on warily. Singbold approached a 
sharp curve in the dark street. Roy had an absolute conviction that 
something unexpected and starthng was around the corner. 

As Singbold turned the comer a bright light flared up. Roy's hands 
shook.

Roy's feeling that someone else was in the room peaked when Sing- 
bold saw two strangely dressed young men. One was holding an old- 
fashioned wood torch, which accounted for the bright light. They 
stopped walking upon seeing Singbold. 

Roy didn't know what to do. He didn't even think about activating 
one of Arthur's shields. The two young men stood gaping at the silent 
Arthur. 

Actually, Roy/ Arthur was the one who should have been gaping. 
The strangers were dressed like honorable starship commanders. Roy re- 
membered instantly and completely the evergreen afternoons of early 
adolescence, playing with Jim, Eric, and Jeff on the mountainsides. They 
had reached high and dreamt wildly. The characters from a movie were a 
foil for unbridled fantasy. 

Roy tensed as the strangers in the road approached Arthur. 

"Now, now, Arthur Singbold," said the one on the left, wearing a red 
shirted admiral's uniform, complete with shiny stars and red boots. Roy 
thought of Admiral Jason, the role Jim Hamilton had always assumed. 

"Pretty authentic, aren't they?" the one on the right said, indicating 
his cobalt-blue Captain Sylvester uniform. Eric had liked variation, but 
this had always been his favorite role. Both the strangers smiled. 

Roy felt like laughing. They didn't really look or sound at all like Jim 
and Eric. There was something wrong with the computer. Something was 
inside it. 

"In this game we're playing, all those who die unnaturally remain on 
earth as spirits for a while." The mysterious admiral took a deep breath. 
"Well, a certain percentage. Right?" 

Roy/ Arthur was too dumbfounded to answer. The light shone 
weirdly on the captain and the admiral. 

"You believe that people who are murdered haunt or otherwise 
spook their killers and enemies. You also believe that certain spirits are 
friendly and capable of helping the living. You believe spirits manifest 
themselves to the living frequently." The admiral paused. 

Roy frantically keyed, "I don't believe in all that." Arthur said it. 

"Come, come, Singbold," said the captain. "You don't believe in 
spirits? You shouldn't be in this game." 

Roy/ Arthur typed/said: "Yes, you're right. I do believe." Roy 
realized his mistake. 

"Well, you're wrong," said the admiral. "There are many spirits all 
over. They rarely haunt the living and never contact those they knew 
when alive. The shock is too much. Rarely do spirits return to the place 
of death." 

"You say rarely?" Roy/Arthur asked, not sure exactly what he was 
asking. 

"We love this mountain," the captain whispered. "It is beautiful. It's 
been three years since we last saw it." 

Roy was very confused. That was not the answer he expected. 

"You are the ones who shouldn't be in this game," Singbold blurted. 

"Who's to say. Perhaps you are the author?" asked the admiral. 

Roy felt like he was being played a masterful joke. Maybe Jeff had 
programmed some interruption device that inserted these alien charac- 
ters. There was no obvious conclusion Roy could derive. 

"What are your names?" he asked suddenly. 

The two costumed characters looked at each other and shrugged. 

"I'm Captain Sylvester and this is Admiral Jason," said the blue uni- 
formed one. 

" 'Bye, now. We must be on our way and you have to see your good 
King Xorba," said the admiral. As they disappeared from his sight, 
Roy/ Arthur heard the same laughter he'd heard in the mountain pass. 
The chills finally went away. 

Roy parked Arthur at the closest inn and then quit the game. More 
than a little spooked, he took a long walk in the forest for the rest of the 
afternoon. 

He spent the evening sitting on the back porch watching the light 
fade, listening to the forest sounds, sipping ale. Roy tried to sort out all 
the strange occurrences in the game of late and what they might mean. 
Instead, he found himself thinking mostly about Jeff. 

Jeff had always been a follower. He had skied when Jim and Eric 
skied. He had run around on hot summer nights when the other two felt 
so inclined. And he had contracted war fever along with the others; but 
he had been too young to serve.

OCTOBER 1982 



Jeff was thoroughly shaken when his brothers died. Many of his boy- 
hood dreams were brought to an early, irrevocable end. Both his broth- 
ers and his dreams survived now only as memories. 

That day of the terrible ambush in a sandstorm, three years ago, Roy 
had known Jeff would never be the same. The two older brothers, Jim 
and Eric, had wanted to fight in the Great Desert War. This was some- 
thing that Roy still couldn't understand. 

And somehow, the computer game was bringing this all back. Maybe 
I'm going nuts, Roy thought. 



"They were dressed just like the characters in Arcturus Traders. They 
reminded me of Jim and Eric, but they looked and sounded nothing like 
them," Roy told Jeff the next morning. 

"And you say these characters have never appeared before?" Jeff 
asked while they both sat in front of the computer monitor. Roy nod- 
ded. He had convinced Jeff that something was dreadfully wrong with 
the expensive and elegant Rosebud system. 

Roy entered the game with Jeff as counsel and witness. The sun 
shone brightly in the room. 

Singbold was in King Xorba's castle. Once Roy/ Arthur talked to the 
king, he'd be three quarters of the way toward understanding greater 
middle heaven. He would still have a long way to go to complete the 
game. 

"Well, one thing is sure," said Jeff, "I haven't fooled around with 
programming and computer games for about two years. This is the kind 
of thing I might even try to pull. But . . ." 

Jeff didn't have to complete the thought. Roy knew that Jeff would 
never make light of his two dead brothers. 

"Do you believe in ghosts?" Roy asked. 

"No." 

"Then what's going on here?" 

"Some supersophisticated part of the program." 

Roy shrugged nervously. It could be. He swore to find out about this 
from the game's author. If it were true that all the baffling encounters 
were part of the original program, Roy would proclaim Singer of the 
Spheres the greatest experience since movies. 

It wasn't over yet. Roy was glad to have Jeff there. The encounter on 
the street with Admiral Jason and Captain Sylvester had really shaken 
him up. It had given him bad dreams. Roy had never believed in the su- 
pernatural. He sfill didn't; but he was very confused. 



On the monitor, Singbold walked proudly through a set of double 
doors into a low-ceilinged antechamber. From the synthesizer came 
sounds of a royal gathering going on behind the next set of double doors. 

"Come here, Arthur Singbold." 

Arthur turned to his right. Susie, the little girl, was beckoning him. 
Arthur walked toward her. 

"By the big wide bend is a fallen tree. At the base you'll find it lightly 
covered up," she whispered very slowly and carefully. 

"Find what?" Roy/Arthur keyed/asked. 

" 'Bye, now." Susie turned and walked through the wall again. Roy 
and Jeff both felt some kind of cool breeze go through the room. The 
window was closed. 

"That felt like a wayward blast from the air cooler. It's been broken 
for a month," Jeff said. 

Arthur entered the massive and opulent throne room. King Xorba 
was seated atop a splendid wooden throne, holding court in all his feath- 
ered glory. 

Near the king, still dressed in the mock uniforms, stood Admiral Ja- 
son and Captain Sylvester. They looked grim. Arthur saw them and at 
once Roy felt him shiver, but his recovery was instant. 

"There they are," Roy said excitedly to Jeff. They both peered in- 
tensely at the monitor. Jeff seemed unusually calm and at ease. Roy was 
a wreck. 

Arthur Singbold presented himself to the king. Captain Sylvester and 
Admiral Jason sat in finely carved oaken chairs next to the monarch. 

"So you aspire to be a singer in the clouds?" the King asked. 

"Yes, my lord. I want to know heaven in all its many levels while still 
among the living." 

"You'd also like to find a mate?" asked the King. 

"Of course, my Lord," Roy/ Arthur keyed/replied. 

This was a fairly normal conversation for the game. 

"You do not know the whole riddle though. Only half, I think. You 
come to me for another piece?" 

Arthur said nothing. 

"I like you. You play the game well," said the King. "The Upper An- 
gel said to me: 'Look in the hills and mountains. This is the way to the 
clouds.' Angels have always been fond of the outdoor life, at one time or 
another. I hope this helps you." 

"Thank you, my King." Arthur fidgeted. Roy looked at Jeff. "My 
Lord, who are these gentlemen that sit next to you?" 

King Xorba smiled. "They're ghosts living out their natural life 
span."

"I do not understand," Roy/ Arthur typed/said. 

"They met a bad end. They died young, and now they wander. At 
this moment they are visiting me in my castle. They tell me things." 

The King frowned. "Now leave us, Singbold. There are more secrets 
to be told, not for your ears to hear. Secrets of war and death. You are 
young and have almost mastered the first great riddle. You're very for- 
tunate." 

Arthur withdrew. Admiral Jason and Captain Sylvester remained si- 
lent and grim, warlike. Roy felt defeated. It was like that red evening 
three years ago when he tried to convince Jim and Eric to give up the sol- 
dier's dream. They had gotten the war bug and couldn't be stopped. Lit- 
tle good it had done trying to talk them out of it. 

Arthur left the king's castle and went east. He rented a boat and 
started down the Armgood River. Near a river island Arthur was at- 
tacked by vicious Oop birds. This was a common hazard of river travel 
and he handled it in the normal fashion; he obliterated one bird and the 
others scattered. 

Roy and Jeff were tired by early evening. 

"This is a really great game," Jeff said. "But I don't see anything all 
that unusual." 

"Yeah, I know." Roy was exhausted and a little irritated with him- 
self Some vacation. I've wasted it playing this dumb game. 

After dinner, Roy retired with little ceremony. He had trouble fall- 
ing asleep. He kept wondering what the admiral and captain had meant 
about spirits returning to the site of death. In a dreamhke state of half 
consciousness, when bizarre and wonderful juxtapositions of thought oc- 
cur, Roy almost made sense of it all. Almost. 



"I hope you had a good time," Jeff said. He and Roy were sitting on 
the front porch waiting for Melanie to arrive. Roy's bags were packed 
and ready. 

Returning from deep thought, Roy asked, "Have there been any car 
accidents around here in the last few years? Any where people died?" 

Jeff thought it an offbeat question but racked his memory nonethe- 
less. "No fatal ones. Cars are pretty safe these days." 

Roy sank back and imagined Jim and Eric wandering the world in 
spirit form. How wonderful to be ethereal and free. 

Jeff perked up. "There was a small plane crash three years ago. I re- 
member it well, because it happened the same day as the ambush. Two 
teenage boys took a joy ride in their father's plane. They had one of the 
first Supra-ten crystal cameras. Just like the one Jim had." 

Roy brightened. "Two teenage boys. They'd be a little older now." 

"When the wreckage was found the camera was missing. It must 
have been thrown from the plane during the crash. Did I say two boys?" 
Jfcff was silent for a few moments, thinking hard. "That's right. There 
was a little girl, too; their younger sister." 

Roy felt a chill go up his spine. It was the victims of the plane crash 
that had invaded the computer. He said so to Jeff. 

"How are dead people going to enter a computer program? Through 
the air holes? Come on, Roy, admit that the game stumped you. It's just 
better than you thought." 

"I don't know. I'll talk to the programmer about it." Roy felt weak 
and tired like never before. Out of fight. 

Melanie drove up in the big blue IM Electro V. Roy said a brief 
good-bye to Jeff. 

Roy and Melanie were zipping down the curvy mountain road. They 
came to a wide bend and Roy spotted the fallen tree. 

"Stop here for just a second," he asked Melanie. She obligingly 
braked and pulled up by the side of the road. 

Without explaining, Roy went to the base of the fallen tree. After dig- 
ging through needles and branches, he found the camera. It was in per- 
fect shape, wrapped in its case. 

Smiling strangely, Roy got back in the car. 

"How did you know that was there?" Melanie asked about the cam- 
era clutched in Roy's hands. 

He didn't answer. He just stared into the lens. A small window into 
the spirit world. 

Soon they were back in the valley. JU 



No Tricks, 
Just Treats. 



Boy, oh boy, if you thought Halioween 
was going to be the high point of 
October, think again. 

Yes, the rumors you've heard are true— 
Softalk will have a booth at the Houston 
Applefest on October 28-31. If you're 
hanging around the Houston Civic 
Center that weekend, drop what you're 
doing and drop by our booth. Loads of 
goodies will be available for the asking. 

We'll have Assembly Lines: The Book, 
by Roger Wagner, for sale. We'll also 
have Softdisk, the floppy magazine 
chock-full of user information. And as if 
all this were not enough (and gosh 
darn, don't you think it ought to be?), 
you'll have the opportunity to meet the 
people behind Softalk Publishing. 

More fun than Apple owners should be 
allowed to have? You betcha. But 
friendly fun is what Softalk is about, and 
that's why we'll be at the Applefest in 
Houston. 

Come by and see what we mean.

With the help of our readers, we're planning to devote an issue (may- 
be more) of this column to examples of graphics done with the Apple. 
We're looking for graphic creations done on Apples with various soft- 
ware packages (or with your own programming) and for various uses 
(serious, or just for fun). We don't have anything exact in mind; we don't 
want to stifle your creativity. We do want pictures done with the Apple, 
and you can send them on disk to Softalk Gallery, Box 60, North Holly- 
wood, CA 91603. 

Tell us about how the graphics were done so we can describe how 
you created them. If you are using graphics in a specific application, let 
us know about that, too. If we get a lot of interesting ideas we may run 
more than one issue describing them. Let no appUcation seem too mi- 
nor; we'd like to show the variety of ways that the graphics can be used, 
from games to sales charts. We need the sales charts as much as we need 
the art. Submission of disks will constitute approval to reproduce the pic- 
tures in Softalk. If you want any of the materials returned, include a self- 
addressed, stamped mailer appropriate for sending disks. 

On With the Business at Hand. To create real fancy graphics as a 
programmer you have to acquaint yourself with the actual mapping of the 
Apple hi-res screen and with handling graphics on a byte and bit level. 
It's not very difficult once you learn a few tricks of the trade. The first is 
coping with the strange memory layout of the screen. 

Figure 1 shows a small part of the upp)er-left corner of hi-res page 1. 
The full screen is 192 bytes tall and 40 bytes wide. The bytes are dis- 
played horizontally, with seven bits (on/offs) displayed in each, so the

40-byte width results in 280 dots. The actual memory address of any byte 
on the screen can be computed by taking the Y address down the left side 
of figure 1 and adding the X value at the very top, from 0 to 39. The X 
offset is nice and simple, with 0 on the left, 39 on the right, and all the 
numbers running normally in between. The locations for the start of each 
line, based on the Y value, are quite a different story. At one point there 
must have been a good reason for the strange sequencing of addresses, 
but it remains an unusual puzzle for most beginning graphics pro- 
grammers. 

There is a formula for computing the starting address of each line, 
given the Y value of that line. Listing 1 is a short program that contains 

10 INPUT Y 

20 Y1 = INT (Y / 8):YR = Y - Y1 * 8 

30 Y2 = INT (Y1 / 8):YS = Y1 - Y2 * 8 

40 L = 8192 Y2 * 40 + YS * 128 -H YR * 1024 

50 PRINT L 

60 GOTO 10 

Listing 1. 

that computation. It allows you to input a number for Y (from 0 to 191), 
and it prints the address of the start of that line. There's no need to go in- 
to the actual formula in this context; we'll just say it's there. To use hi-res 
page 2 instead of page 1, change 8192 to 16384 in line 40. 

10 HGR : VTAB 23 

15 INPUT "X :-'*;X: IP X < 0 OR X >39 THEN 15 

16 INPUT "Y : ";Y: IF-Y < 0 OR Y > 191 THEN 16 
20 Y1 = INT (Y / 8):YR = Y - Y1 * 8 

30 Y2 = INT (Y1 / 8):YS = Y1 - Y2 * 8 

40 YL = 8192 -H Y2 * 40 -h YS * 128 + YR * 1024 

50 L = YL -h X 

60 POKE L,255 

70 GOTO 15 

Listing 2. 

Listing 2 contains a little more excitement. Using the same computa- 
tion for the Y location, it allows you to enter values for X and Y. It com- 
putes the Y location (lines 20 through 40) and then adds the X value (line 
50) to give a specific screen address. Then it pokes the number 255 into 
that address, setting all seven displayed points in that byte (the number 
127 would have the same result). 

Tricks of the Trade. Doing a three-line computation whenever you 
want to find a screen location takes a lot of time. Even in machine lan- 
guage, the time used to compute a Y address can make a difference when 
speed is an important factor (it usually is). To avoid using computations 
all the time, a trick that is often used is precomputing all the Y locations 
and storing them in a table. Then, when an address is needed, instead of 
computing, you just look for it in the table. This is most often done in 
machine language programs, but for explanation this month we'll do it in 
Basic. Next month, we'll convert. 

Listing 3 has a program that works like the one in listing 2, except it 
repeats in a pattern around the screen. It uses a trick we've used before,

In lines 70 and 80, X and Y are updated, and if they reach the edge of the 
screen the increments are reversed, giving the illusion of bouncing. Try it, 
and take notice of the speed. The Y value in this example is computed 
before each plot. 

Listing 4 has the same program, but it uses a Y look-up table for the 
addresses. The subroutine starting at line 150 creates the table, comput- 
ing each location for Y, from 0 to 191, and storing them in an array, 
YT(Y). The first thing that is done in the program is the gosub to the ta-

gram we'll have these precomputed addresses sitting in the array YT(Y). 
The rest of the program is exactly as before, except that the computation 
from lines 20 through 50 has been reduced to one short line 20, which 
takes the computed address in YT(Y) for whichever Y value you need, 
then adds the X offset. Note that it takes several seconds in Basic to cre- 
ate the look-up table when you run the program, but after the table is 
computed the graphics move much faster. 

A Basic Character Generator. Once you have an idea of what 
bit/byte graphics are (poking values into screen memory), you are ready 
to start using them to put things on the hi-res page. What we've used be- 
fore — shapje tables — are known as vector graphics, in which objects are 
defined by plotting and moving in lines from a starting point. The move 
commands can be translated anywhere on the screen, so your shape can 
be plotted anywhere. The other tyf)e of graphics is called bit-mapped 
graphics, in which you define a set of dots to be on or off, store them as a 
sequence of bytes, then put those bytes wherever you want them in the

screen memory area. That's what the programs in listings 2 through 4 do, 
with the bit map being the number 255 that we were poking into screen 
memory. 

Listing 5 is similar again. It uses the look-up table to find the Y ad- 
dresses. But instead of a single poke command, we've put in lines 20 
through 70. Lines 20 through 60 form a loop that repeats eight times, in- 
crementing the Y value and poking a number into the screen area each 
time. The result is that instead of putting one byte of information on the 
screen, it puts eight bytes, or a block of dots seven pixels wide and eight 
pixels tall. It reads the values for the eight bytes from the data statement 
in line 70. As it turns out, those numbers translate to the letter H when

Figure 2. 



To see how those numbers were determined, see figure 2. Each row 
of that grid represents one byte: eight rows, eight bytes. Each column 
represents bits within the bytes. Bits 0 through 6 are displayed as dots on 
the screen. Remember that bit 7 is used as a color flag. The decimal num- 
bers associated with each bit are listed above each column. Note that bit 
0 is displayed on the left; those of you who've worked with binary or ma- 
chine language would expect the opposite. 

To compute a number for each of the eight bytes, after marking each 
dot that you want set, go across each row and add the values from the 
top of each column that is marked. In figure 2 we've put those numbers 
at the right of each row. Notice that those numbers match the numbers 
used in the data statement in listing 5. You now have a hi-res charac- 
ter generator, if only for one character. Try using different values in the

for three characters (0 to 2) of eight bytes each (0 to 7). The nested

through the characters, and J counting through the eight bytes for each 
character. The characters used in the data statements are A, B, and C,

Lines 18 and 60 are the only others that are significantly different 
from the previous programs. Line 18 gets a character from the key- 
board; as soon as you press a key, that character is put in A$. The ASC 
function is then used to find the character's ASCII value (see the table in 
appendix K of your Applesoft manual, pages 138-139). This particular 
program will only recognize the keys A, B, and C, which have ASCII 
codes 65, 66, and 67, so after subtracting 65 we have a number that corre- 
sponds to the characters in our table. You can do a lot of fiddling with 
that limit and the length of the table. Line 60 increments X after each 
character (so the next one is printed one space over to the right), and if 
the right edge of the screen is reached, Y is incremented and X is set back 
to zero. When Y reaches the bottom of the screen, it is set back to 
the top. 

Next month we'll put a bunch of this into machine language, which 
actually turns out rather simple once you have the idea of look-up tables. 
Without much computation, the machine language routines become 
more of a taking something from one place and putting them in an- 
other. The most difficult part will be coping with addresses in hexadeci- 
mal (base sixteen) instead of decimal. Hi

The Schoolhouse Apple 

byJeanVarven 




Now that the school year is underway, we're 
beginning to get news of what various people in 
education did during the summer vacation. For 
educators in Montana in particular, the sum- 
mer months were a busy time. But, in truth, 
Montana's story began many months earlier. 

What Montana Needs Now. In the autumn 
of last year, the Office of Public Instruction for 
the State of Montana conducted a needs assess- 
ment survey. According to state department 
communications specialist Betti J. Christie, 
some 81 percent of the teachers, principals, and 
district superintendents who responded iden- 
tified "selection and utilization of computer 
technology" as their school's top concern. 

The outcome of the survey helped spur State 
Superintendent of Schools Ed Argenbright to 
appoint sixteen highly qualified educators from 
around the state to a computers in education 
task force. The task force would work with 
Argenbright's office during the coming months, 
sharing their experience and expertise with 
other members of Montana's educational com- 
munity and with all the state's eight hundred 
thousand citizens. 

The group that met this past May in Helena 
consisted of two elementary school teachers, 
two junior high school teachers, two high 
school teachers, two college professors, and two 
school administrators, as well as six curriculum 
specialists from the state department. Two 
Plains, Montana, high school students also at- 
tended. Dan Dolan, the state department's 
computers and math specialist, chaired the 
group. 

Task force members brought with them the 
benefit of many years' experience using micro- 
computers. In fact, the sixteen educators who 
met together in May had a combined total of 
sixty years of experience working with miao- 
computers in a classroom setting. They also 
brought a variety of perspectives and concerns, 
according to whether their experience had been 
working with younger or older learners, at a 
large or small school, at a school with only one 
computer to be shared among all students, or at 
one with several machines arranged in a com- 
puter center format. 

Using computers in the classroom presents 
new challenges. Hardware selection, software 
evaluation, and teacher training all become 
matters of concern. So does the question of how 
computers should be used. And, as Argen- 
bright pointed out to the task force group at the 
opening session, the very basic issue of "the real 
role of education in our society today" must be 
examined. The task force's primary goal was to 



devise some concrete ways of helping Mon- 
tana's schools deal with these questions. 

At the end of three long days, the group had 
hashed out a lot of issues. First, they reached 
agreement on three basic premises: computers 
should be integrated into regular classroom in- 
struction, students should be provided with as 
many hands-on computer experiences as possi- 
ble, and the main goal for using computers in 
the classroom should be problem solving. It was 
judged that emphasizing these things was the 
best way of preparing Montana's students to 
meet the demands of a future in which comput- 
er literacy will be so important. 

Working within this framework, the group 
decided on the three projects they hope will 
make a real_ difference in how Montana adjusts 
to and makes use of computer technology. The 
first of these is a handbook entitled Elements of 
-Computer Education: A Complete Program. Al- 
ready, reports Betti Christie, educators from 
many states have expressed their eagerness to 
have copies of the handbook. 

Scheduled for release later this fall, the pub- 
lication offers information about how to 
establish a program for using computers in edu- 
cation. Guidelines for hardware and software 
evaluation and selection will be included, as will 
suggestions about program development, staff 
training, and telecommunications possibilities. 
The handbook will also contain information 
about ways to stay out of trouble. After all, 
knowing what not to do (what equipment you 
may not really need, for instance) can be a life- 
saver, especially during these times when school 
budgets have been reduced so drastically. 

Work is scheduled to begin soon on a pro- 
fessionally prepared videotape that will feature 
teachers, administrators, school board mem- 
bers, parents, and students from around the 
state. They'll talk about the successful experi- 
ences they've had using computers in education 
and about the problems they've encountered 
and how they solved them. The emphasis in the 
videotape presentation and in the handbook 
will be on practical hands-on suggestions and 
information designed to help educators move 
smoothly into the world of computers in edu- 
cation. The videotape will be made available for 
check-out through Montana's Office of Public 
Instruction. 

According to Betti Christie, some 90 per- 
cent of Montana's schools are using at least a 
portion of this year's federal government block 
grant funds for the purchase of computers and 
computer-related materials. It seems particu- 
larly appropriate, then, that the task force's 



third project is the creation of a statewide staff 
development system. In collaboration with the 
Montana University System, the Office of Pub- 
lic Instruction plans to train experienced educa- 
tors to teach others about computers. 

As a result of this training, everything from 
awareness sessions of two to six hours duration 
to thirty-hour college courses will become avail- 
able to interested educators. The goal is to 
establish a network of resources throughout the 
state so that when educators need information 
or additional training, they'll have a highly qual- 
ified local person they can turn to. 

Clearly, the state of Montana is responding 
creatively to the new challenges that using com- 
puters in education presents.

pie that revealed fresh water microfossils in lo- 
cations F20 and 21, land plant fossils in G20, 
and a large salt deposit in G21. 

Based on the core-sample results, you and 
your colleagues have decided that it's worth 
spending $40 to do a seismic exploration of lo- 
cation G21. Setting off a dynamite charge will 
cause shock waves, and these shock waves will 
create echoes; the echo pattern that results will 
give you and your teammates more informa- 
tion about how to proceed. 

By studying the echo pattern, you'll be able 
to evaluate how likely it is that an oil trap is 
buried far below the earth's crust in this loca- 
tion. Then you'll be prepared to decide whether 
it's best to look further in other locations or to 
spend $80 to drill a well at F20. 

How did you and your colleagues become 
geology and oil drilling experts? By taking part 
in Geology Search, an outstanding Search Se- 
ries simulation from McGraw-Hill and Com- 
puter Learning Connection. In the course of 
your adventure, you've found out what a geol- 
ogist does, how oil is formed, and where oil is 
most likely to be found. You've learned about 
sedimentary rock, igneous rock, and fossils; 
learned how to read a coordinate system on a 
graph; and learned how to create a graph that 
charts your company's progress. 

There are five Search Series packages in all; 
the other programs focus on geography, 
archeology, energy, and community. Geology 



Search was devised primarily for use in upper 
elementary and junior high school classrooms. 

In a classroom setting, students are grouped 
into teams (or oil companies) that compete 
against each other. In the process of learning 
about density scans, gravimeters, and drilling 
rigs, students also develop their powers of ob- 
servation, their communication skills, and their 
abilities to arrive at strategies that take relevant 
factors into account. 

The workbook is clear, readable, entertain- 
ing, and informative, with illustrations that clar- 
ify and expand the material covered in the text. 
When a new word is used, it is printed in bold- 
face and defined at the end of the chapter in 
which it appears. There are also questions at the 
ends of chapters to test searchers' understand- 
ing of the material presented so far. 

The workbook is an integral part of the pro- 
gram, since it is here that you keep track of the 
current price of oil, how much money is avail- 
able, which locations have been tested, and 
where wells have been drilled. It also contains 
the map of Newlandia, on which you can re- 
cord information about areas you're in the 
process of exploring. 

The accompanying teacher's manual is a 
genuine resource for teachers. It provides use- 
ful information about the skills and concepts 
Geology Search is designed to teach, as well as 
excellent ideas for supplementary classroom ac- 
tivities to increase students' understanding of 



the material. 

Geology Search is an imaginative, well- 
thought-out program. It involves learners and 
makes very good use of the computer as an edu- 
cational tool. In addition to providing students 
with opportunities to interact with the comput- 
er, the program challenges learners, calling on 
their abilities to read, write, keep records, make 
predictions, and solve problems. Because 
Geology Search requires only intermittent use of 
the computer, it is especially welcome in class- 
room situations where one computer must serve 
many students.

A Review of Moptown. Moptown is the 
home of the Moppets — shy, friendly, brightly 
colored creatures who will entertain and edu- 
cate learners of all ages. 

Moptown has sixteen moppets in all, each 
one slightly different from all the rest. Through 
these sixteen creatures, players of Moptowrts 
eleven different games learn to distinguish 
height, girth, color, and type. And in the proc- 
ess of distinguishing between short and tall, fat 
and thin, red and blue, bibbitt and gribbit, 
learners develop the logic skills involved in iden- 
tifying similarities, differences, and patterns, 
and also practice devising problem-solving 
strategies.

Although Moptown has been on the market 
for some time now, it still stands out as a clearly 
conceived and truly educational program that's 
delightfully appealing as well. Happily, it is ap- 
propriate for both home and school use. 

Intended for learners from age four on, 
Moptown's eleven attribute games range in dif- 
ficulty from easy to very challenging. In each 
game, learners can look forward to feedback in 
two forms, graphical and musical, and these 
features enhance the program rather than clut- 
tering it up. 

In the first game, Make My Twin, players 
are shown a moppet and asked to make a sec- 
ond one just like it. If they succeed in creating 
the moppet's twin, they are rewarded by a flash- 
ing frame surrounding their new creation and 
by an appealing sequence of sounds. 

Game two. Who's Different?, can be played 
two ways. In the first version, players see four 
moppets and are asked to determine the one 
moppet who's different from the other three 
and to identify what trait makes it different. In 
the second version, all four moppets differ from 
one another and the learners' task is to deter- 
mine which one differs most. 

Game three asks. What's the Same? This 
time, players must identify what trait all four of 
the moppets shown have in common. And in 
game four. Who Comes Next?, learners must 
look closely at a row of moppets, determine the 
pattern the moppets' order demonstrates, and 
decide who logically comes next. 

Moptown Parade presents the player with 
one moppet and the player chooses the other 
four members of the parade according to the 
rules that were set at the beginning of the game. 
Depending on which rule variation the player 
chooses, the moppets allowed in the parade can 
differ in one, two, three, or four ways. This 
extends the learner's understanding of what it 
means for something to be different. Different 
how and in how many ways, the learner must 
now determine. 

In Who's Next Door?, two moppets are 
presented that differ from one another in one 
way. A third moppet appears and the learner 
must create a fourth one. The fourth moppet 
must differ from the third in the same way (and 
in no other) that the first differs from the sec- 
ond. In this way, players are introduced, ever so 
naturally, to the concept of analogy. 

Finding one's Secret Pal requires the learn- 
er to remember attributes and to be able to 
make the appropriate connections between re- 
lated bits of information. Change Me is another 
one about differences; this time, you can see the 
first and fourth moppets and must figure out 
how to make the second and third moppets dif- 
ferent from each other (in either one or two 
ways) and different from moppets one and four. 
As you play this game, what it means to be dif- 
ferent continues to take on new dimension and 
to be defined in more specific terms. 

The last three games — Clubhouse, Moptown 
Map, and Moptown Hotel — involve discover- 
ing and following secret rules. All are quite chal- 
lenging, even for adults. When you play Club- 
house, for example, only certain moppets can go 



in the clubhouse; they must fit the rule (or 
rules). In one playing of the game, the rule may 
say that only short moppets can enter; another 
time only tall blue moppets are allowed. The 
rules change, making each a new adventure. 

In Moptown Map, the object of the game is 
to put each moppet in his house; doing so re- 
quires following the secret rules that govern 
which two traits each mopf)et in a particular row 
or column must have. It may sound easy, but 
wait till you try it. 

The final game, Moptown Hotel, is likely to 
be a favorite among both young learners and 
older ones. It's a game for two players that in- 
volves applying two "difference rules" to deter- 
mine which moppets should be placed where. 
The object is to earn money (points) for placing 
moppets in the appropriate rooms in the hotel, 
and players can score bonus points for co- 
operating with each other. 

And so it goes. Each game builds on the one 
before and learners gain more and more confi- 
dence as they lay the foundation for a solid un- 
derstanding not only of attributes, but of the 
thinking processes involved in solving prob- 
lems. 

The accompanying documentation booklet by 
The Learning Company's Ten Perl is clearly 
written and well organized, and its illustrations in- 
clude helpful sample screens. But it may be a while 
before you read the booklet — the on-screen 
instructions are so clear that it's unlikely you'll 
need to refer to the manual for help. (Do read it 
anyway, though. You'll enjoy it.) 

An especially nice feature of the program 
consists of "how to play" enactments that learn- 
ers can watch whenever they want a refresher 
course on how a game is played. 

Only single-keystroke input is required, 
making this a perfect program even for very 
young learners. Young learners may also ap- 
preciate the fact that the Moptown graphics 
were created by a young person, eleven-year-old 
Corrine Grimm, daughter of programmer Les- 
lie Grimm. (You'd never guess it.) 

Moptown requires a 48K Apple with one 
disk drive and works best with a color monitor, 
although it can be used with a black and white.

Class Records is a classroom management sys- 
tem that enables teachers to maintain records of 
grades, attendance, and other pertinent infor- 
mation. If a printer is available, the system also 
allows teachers to generate a variety of reports. 

Supermath is an enhanced version of an 
elementary math program written originally for 
Apple Computer by Ron Graff, director of 
Educational Systems Software. This exercise 
module (others are planned) can be used for 
drill and practice and for testing students' skills 
in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division. The difficulty level of the problems 
changes automatically as students' responses 
indicate that they need simpler exercises or that 
they are ready to move ahead. Student scores 
are stored initially in the Supermath exercise 
module and can be easily transferred to Class 
Records later on. 

In addition to producing more exerdse mod- 
ules, Educational Systems Software plans to 
create resource files containing useful informa- 
tion that can be used in conjunction with the 
modules. An editor program for composing text 
or for use with existing materials is also in the 
works. 

George Earl, 1 302 South General McMullen, 
San Antonio, TX 78237; (512) 434-3681. 

Dr. George Earl first became interested in 
computers in the early seventies. Recognizing 
various ways that computers could be of help to 
him in his practice. Dr. Earl, a general practi- 
tioner, purchased one of the first Apple lis. 

It wasn't long before Dr. Earl, whose inter- 



ests include world languages and cultures, 
started developing educational courseware. 
Current offerings include programs for elemen- 
tary and junior high school students in lan- 
guages, literature, and math. 

Programs from George Earl include The 
Spanish Hangman and The French Hangman, 
two drill and practice programs based on the 
age-old game and intended for first and second 
year language students, and Alicia, a bilingual 
reader that allows students to learn by studying 
Alice in Wonderland in Spanish translation. 
Another of the company's products is Lessons 
in Algebra, a beginning algebra tutorial pro- 
gram for junior high school students that was 
written by a practicing algebra teacher. Future 
plans call for Hangman programs in German, 
Russian, Hebrew, and other languages. 

The software George Earl markets is devel- 
oped by a team of educators using microcom- 
puters provided to them by the company. Dr. 
Earl meets regularly with the educators to dis- 
cuss new ideas and techniques. In addition, 
volunteer work in various educational settings 
helps Dr. Earl keep in touch with what's going 
on in the schools and with the needs of students 
and their teachers. 

Milliken Publishing Company, 1 100 Research 
Boulevard, Saint Louis, MO 63132; (314) 991- 
4220. 

Milliken Publishing Company was founded 
in 1960. If you're an educator, your first aware- 
ness of the company's existence may have come 
when you used filmstrips, color transparencies, 



or other audio-visual materials they published. 
In 1977, having created supplementary and re- 
source materials for teachers for many years, 
the company began developing computer-based 
educational courseware. 

In terms of educational courseware, Mil- 
liken is best known for its comprehensive school 
packages. These packages include Milliken 
Math Sequences, a drill and practice series for 
students in grades one through eight; Milliken 
Language Arts, a structured drill and practice 
for first through eighth graders that covers let- 
ter recognition and alphabetization skills; and 
Reading Comprehension, a skill-building pro- 
gram that covers some twenty-five different 
reading skills. Each of these series includes a 
manager program that enables the classroom 
teacher to monitor student progress and assign 
materials accordingly. 

Other school-use programs include Gram- 
mar Problems for Practice, and Writing Skills, a 
new eighteen-lesson program that covers such 
things as the use of good and well, preposition- 
al phrases, and describing words. A supple- 
mentary activities booklet provides informa- 
tion about off-line activities to reinforce the 
work students have done at the computer. Writ- 
ing Skills has been described as somewhat more 
tutorial in its presentation than the company's 
other packages and features hi-res graphics. 

With its soon-to-be available Edufun disks, 
Milliken enters the home education market for 
the first time. The first group of programs 
(twelve in all) focuses on math, while later pro-

grams will emphasize the language arts. The 
Mathfun games cover ten basic skill areas iden- 
tified by the National Council of Supervisors of 
Mathematics and several have been extensively 
field-tested in elementary schools. The games 
use color, sound, graphics, and animation to 
motivate learners. According to the company, 
the programs stress mental skills rather than the 
manual skills emphasized in video games. 

The home versions of Edufun packages will 
consist of the disk and a user guide that in- 
cludes suggestions to parents of ways to extend 
math concepts into everyday situations, as well 
as flashcards, scorecards, and stickers to re- 
ward good performance. School packages will 
contain additional supplemental activities for 
reinforcement and extension of the material 
studied, along with a record-keeping program 
for teachers to use in keeping track of chil- 
dren's performance. 

Reston Publishing Company, 11480 Sunset 
Hills Road, Reston, VA 22090; (703) 437-8900. 

Founded in 1971, this Prentice-Hall subsid- 
iary settled into Gulf Oil's planned communi- 
ty of Reston, Virginia. Primarily a publisher of 
college textbooks (with some eight hundred ti- 
tles in print), Reston has recently moved into 
the educational software market. 

Multiploy, the company's first program, is a 
math game that draws on arcade game princi- 
ples to make learning addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division more fun and chal- 
lenging. The game is especially intended for use 
by young people ages four to fourteen, al- 
though older learners can also enjoy playing it. 



The manual that comes with the program is 
clearly written and should be easy for inex- 
perienced computer users to follow. 

Reston recently issued a new book, Kids and 
the Apple, copublished with DataMost (Chats- 
worth, California). Especially designed to ap- 
peal to young people ages ten to fourteen, the 
book consists of thirty-three lessons containing 
Basic programs, explanations of Applesoft 
Basic commands and concepts, and review 
questions. The book can be used as a self-study 
tool or in a classroom setting. Each lesson is ac- 
companied by Instructor Notes that tell what 
the lesson covers and suggest concepts to stress 
when teaching it. The answers to the program- 
ming exercises are included at the back of the 
book, along with a glossary of terms, index of 
topics, index of commands, information about 
error messages, and a listing of Applesoft's 
reserved words. 

In the future, Reston plans to create soft- 
ware that makes educators' lives easier, as well 
as additional CAI programs. Meanwhile, the 
company is in the process of producing a 1983 
computer calendar. The calendar will feature 
close-up photographs of micro chips, computer 
trivia, and other computer-related pictures and 
information. 

Software Technology for Computers, Box 428, 
Belmont, MA 02178; (617) 923-4334. 

In the course of his involvement with com- 
puters, Gary Haffer has developed mainframe 
programs for everything from launching the 
Apollo 10 space shot to diagnosing heart dis- 
ease and bone cancer. In 1979, he and his com-

pany, Software Technology for Computers, | 
took on a new challenge — creating comprehen- 1 
sive education and business programs for the ^ 
Apple. 

The company's most ambitious education 
project to date is the Language I Reading Devel- 
opment Program, described by Haffer as a ^ 
"complete course in reading and perception." ^ 
The system helps learners see relationships be- 
tween words, rather than teaching reading and 
language arts by means of classical drill and 
practice methods. 

Haffer came to the realization that many 
people don't understand a lot of what they read 
and have a tendency to stop at every word they 
don't know. He decided that in order to be- 
come faster, more efficient readers, people need 
to be able to recognize words, understand clear- 
ly what those words mean, and be able to spell 
them. This was the reasoning behind the crea- 
tion of the Language / Reading Development Pro- 
gram. 

The system consists of four disks: two on 
perception and word recognition, one on 
synonyms and antonyms, and one on analo- 
gies. Intended for use by both school-age learn- 
ers and adults, it offers several levels of difficul- 
ty. Pacing that takes learners' responses into ac- 
count has been incorporated into the program. 
In addition, users of the program (parents, 
teachers in a classroom situation, and others) 
can create their own supplemental files in order 
to test recognition and understanding of words 
they choose. The package includes supplemen- 
tary worksheets, study guides, and lists of all the 
words the program employs.

defines new territory. If that product is a computer 
simulation, it will leave the crowded field of carbon- 
copy Space Invaders far behind. 



Rendezvous . . . the breakthrough is here. 

Rendezvous accurately simulates the orbital 
fli ght of a space shuttle craft. During the 
liftoff and orbital rendezvous stages, exact 
systems of ballistics and orbital mechanics 
require you to master Earth's gravitationa 
force. Once you achieve orbit, the 
disorientation of a frictionless, 
zero-gravity environment 
complicates your maneuvers 
Throughout the final stages of 
alignment and docking, you wi 
view the rotating, 3-dimensiona 
space station as it would appear in a 
space craft's anterior window. 




Space 
Flight S 



From liftoff to docking. Rendezvous tests the limits 
of your technical understanding, mathematical 
judgment, and raw perceptual skill. 

Toda y. Rendezvous is an Interactive Simulation . . . 

tomorrow it will be realit y. 

Rendezvous is the brainchild of Wes 
Huntress, author of Sub Logic's Saturn 
Navigator and a scientist at NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory. Huntress created

system which brings to life the massive bulk

challenge — of emulating the big kids. Several 
excellent procedures in all versions of Logo 
have been written for use by preschoolers. But 
judging by the experience of the Young Peo- 
ples' Logo Association, the most successful pro- 
grams are those that offer young people of all 
ages the chance to explore turtle graphics both 
on and off the computer. 

Using both on and off computer activities 
has a range of benefits. Classrooms and clubs 
are always faced with the very practical prob- 
lem of where to get (and how to afford) the 
hardware to satisfy so many curious young- 
sters, all of whom are eager for their turn at the 
keyboard. Since the time of one computer per 
learner is a long way off, the question becomes, 
"What do we do with those people who are not 
working at the keyboard?" 

Schools, classroom groups, clubs, and fam- 
ilies can all enjoy a wide range of "off comput- 
er" turtle geometry activities. As an aid to vis- 
ualizing what the turtle is doing on the screen, 
learners can walk through turtle exercises, mov- 
ing FORWARD, BACK, LEFT, and RIGHT 
to form different geometric patterns on the 
floor. When children are working together in a 
group, one child can play the turtle while others 
"program" the turtle to walk through different 
geometric procedures. 

A wide range of exercises can be done on 
graph paper and on large sheets of paper or 
cloth that have been spread out on the floor. 
Knotted string laid out in patterns can help 
youngsters visualize the trail the turtle must take 
on the screen. In addition, many arts and crafts 
activities, along with body geometry, can be 
used to demonstrate keyboard and screen func- 
tions. For example, ask four children to stand 
together forming a square. Kinetic activity like 
this goes a long way toward making geometry 
come alive for children. 

A young child recently demonstrated the 
value of these kinds of exercises. Three-year-old 
Jeffrey was fascinated by the computer and en- 
joyed typing random letters and seeing them ap- 
pear on the screen. He tried some of the proce- 
dures designed especially for preschoolers but, 
because they were not like those being used by 
his older brother and sister, he really wasn't that 
interested. 

Working with the MIT version of Logo, 
wherein the shape of the turtle can be changed, 
Larry Muller of the YPLA Software Exchange 
developed single-keystroke procedures that al- 
lowed Jeffrey and others in his age group to 
draw, in effect, "just Hke the big kids." 

With the aid of the shape editor, the shape 
of the traditional triangle-shaped turtle was 
changed to a more graphic representation of a 
small turtle. The new turtle now moved on com- 
mand, changing direction as requested and 
drawing multicolored lines on a white back- 
ground. Jeffrey found this fascinating and was 
soon putting squares and rectangles on the 
screen with ease, accurately describing the shape 
of each figure as the turtle made it appear. 

How does a three-year-old know the differ- 
ence between squares, rectangles, and triangles? 
It's tempting to cite this as an example of "ge- 



nius at work." But it is more realistic to say that 
Jeffrey has found the key to enjoying the com- 
puter through a single-keystroke language that 
puts him in control so that he can "be like the 
big kids." Those who have watched him 
work — that is, when he lets people get any- 
where near the computer — can't help wonder- 
ing just how much of this Jeffrey understands. 
How much is instinctual learning? 

One thing is obvious, however. Jeffrey is at 
that age where he wants to do everything him- 
self He even insists on holding his own hand — 
not his mother's — when he crosses the street. 
Having had the chance to live and feel turtle ge- 
ometry through off-computer experiences, Jeff- 
rey now seems to be able to translate the expe- 
riences into meaningful on-computer proce- 
dures. The result is that the computer has come 
alive for Jeffrey and for those around him. 

The activities Jeffrey enjoyed, along with a 
number of other on and off computer activi- 
ties, have been gathered together into The Tur- 
tle Sourcebook, a turtle graphics workbook for 
home and school scheduled for publication by 
the YPLA this month. Developed with the 
guidance and participation of Dr. Kathleen 
Martin of the University of Dallas, the pro- 
grams in the book will be introduced at the Ed- 
Com '82 conference, which is being held Octo- 
ber 21 through 24 in Los Angeles, California. 

On-Computer Adventures. Once young 
people begin working at the computer, they can 
learn about turtle graphics and Logo through 
the building of procedures using basic geomet- 



ric shapes. Not only are the circle, square, tri- 
angle, and rectangle very easy to draw, they are 
very common natural shapes that can be com- 
bined to form all sorts of more complex pic- 
tures. And it is this structuring of small ele- 
ments into more complex procedures that is the 
power of Logo. 

A fundamental procedure used to draw a 
shape is the POLY procedure: 

TO POLYR :REPEAT :SIDE :ANGLE 
REPEAT :REPEAT [FORWARD ;SIDE 
RIGHT :ANGLE] 
END 

To draw a polygon, you need only assign 
values to the variables REPEAT, SIDE, and 
ANGLE. For example, POLYR 4 50 90 draws 
a square with each side fifty turtle steps long. 
The turtle repeats that which is inside the brack- 
ets four times. In this case, it moves fifty steps 
and then turns right. The "R" in POLYR indi- 
cates that the figure will be drawn by the turtle 
making right turns. To have the turtle draw to 
the left, you need only change the direction. 

Youngsters in various schools have been 
working with Logo for about a year, develop- 
ing procedures for simple geometric shapes and 
then assembling the procedures into pictures. 
They have done elephants, cameras, churches, 
buildings, and all sorts of other objects. 

A Logo Challenge. Here's an example in 
which the POLYR and POLYL procedures are 
used to draw an old-time railroad engine. 
Called TRAIN, this procedure uses circles.

But there's one problem. 

Throughout the procedure, the variables

keep changing. Note that there are several 
places where the MAKE command is used to 
change the values of R, S, and A. 
Here's the challenge! 

Change this procedure so that only one set 
of variables is used. TRAIN would then be- 
come TO TRAIN :R :S :A. All other values 
within the procedure would then have to be re- 
lated to the assigned values of Repeat, Side, and 
Angle. For example, if 4, 30, and 90 are the 
values assigned to R, S, and A, then all of the 90 
degree turns within the procedure would be 
written as RIGHT :A or LEFT :A. A move of 
FORWARD 60 could be written as FOR- 
WARD :S * 2.

AT LAST, PERSONALIZED 
LETTERS THE EASY WAY! 

In May. 1981, Blue Lakes started testing a new 
program ttiat may very well revolutionize the way 
letters are written. Letters are first entered on 
forms from witfiin a Super-Database program that 
was specifically designed to handle personal in- 
formation. The Database can then be searched by 
up to 6 position searches simultaneously. It 
doesn't matter whether the searches are only part 
of a word, name, or code. The first name with a 
semicolon next to it is a built in feature that gives 
you perfect salutations for the most demanding 
situations. Spacing is automatically taken care 
of- Help screens throughout the program assure 
first time users and yet doesn't slow down ex- 
perienced users. Learning seven commands will 
give you full power of the letter writing features of 
l\flailmod. 

Files can be merged together and transfered in an 
order picked by you! You can select a single 
Record while viewing it. Automatic Batch 
changes can be made to groups of searched 
records. Immediate jumps to any record can be 
made when viewing records. All fields can be 
sorted. 

Labels, letters, and listings can be made in Zip- 
code order and even alphabetized by last name 
within each zipcode. Labels can even include cap- 
tions. 

Requires a 64K Apple with 2 disk drives. Works 
many times faster on any hard disk supporting Ap- 
ple Pascal. Apple III version is now available.

chased before Oct. 31st, 1982.

In the coming months, we'll bring you a va- 
riety of programs and challenges for people of 
all ages. You'll be introduced to multilingual 
turtles from South America and other parts of 
the world. Jeffrey and his preschool friends will 
continue to explore the computer. You'll also 
see how Logo can be used in the study of dy- 
namics and two and three dimensional geome- 
try, as well as what it can do as a general pur- 
pose language.

SYSTeM SAVeR 



p most important peripheral Tor your 

Apple IL 





As soon as you move to 64K RAM or 
80 columns you need SYSTEM SAVER. 

Today's advanced peripheral cards 
generate more heat. In addition, the cards 
block any natural air flow through the Apple 
II creating high temperature conditions that 
substantially reduce the life of the cards and 
the computer itself. 

SYSTEM SAVER provides correct 
cooling. An efficient, quiet fan draws fresh 
air across the mother board, over the power 
supply and out the side ventilation slots. 



For Line Surge 
Suppression 

The SYSTEM SAVER provides essential 
protection to hardware and data from 
dangerous, power surges and spikes. 

By connecting the Apple II power 
input through the SYSTEM SAVER, power 
is controlled in two ways: 1) Dangerous 
voltage spikes are clipped off at a safe 130 
volt RMS level. 2) High frequency noise is 
smoothed out before reaching the Apple II. 




For Operating 
Efficiency 

SYSTEM SAVER contains two switched 
power outlets. As shown in the diagram, 
the SYSTEM SAVER efficiently organizes 
your system so that one convenient, front 
mounted power switch controls SYSTEM 
SAVER, Apple II, monitor and printer. The 
heavy duty switch has a pilot light to alert 
when system is on. You'll never use the 
Apple power switch again!

□ What Hath Tron Wrought? You are float- 
ing in outer space. Far in the distance is a trian- 
gular plane covered with some kind of grid- 
work. Then you are moving toward it at an in- 
credible speed and the black, airless void turns 
bright blue as you make contact with its atmos- 
phere. You perceive objects floating above the 
surface. They appear to be pillars and concave 
triangular solids which, as you approach within 
inches, can be seen to contain . . . Pentel pens. 



a tiny lo-res video game figure. Cineflex created 
a graphics program that simulates the play of 
one of the Fox/Atari games. With 2,100 hnes of 
resolution available in their filming system, the 
only problem, as Rocklen recalls, was not to 
misrepresent the product as looking better than 
it really does. 

□ The Big Check-Out. Taking books out of a 
public library is one of the last great free things 
in America — anyone can do it if their library 




That's the scenario of the first television 
commercial produced by Cineflex Pictures of 
Los Angeles, and it claims to be the first thirty- 
second spot consisting entirely of computer- 
generated imagery. Cineflex, the commercial 
film division of Pacific Electric, achieves its ef- 
fects with 256 color selections, sixteen density 
types, and a nearly infinite number of available 
shapes — the same kind of solid geometry sys- 
tem used in the film Tron. 

Producer Gary Rocklen and his "imagists" 
feed object descriptions into a computer, which 
then makes the digital-to-analog translation of 
the image to 35 millimeter film. The result is 
"pure" computer-simulated graphics, with no 
opticals or combinatory imagery. The specific 
system and process are tightly held trade se- 
crets in this suddenly competitive field. 

Cineflex's next commercial was for Twen- 
tieth Century-Fox video games, an assignment 
that required filling the screen with a close-up of 



credit's good. Nevertheless, many people have 
missed the spirit of the idea and are neglecting 
to return what they have borrowed. 

Collecting fines and retrieving overdue or 
stolen books is a serious business. Library in- 
vestigators in Los Angeles try to collect on more 
than one million dollars' worth of fines and ma- 
terials each year. Failure to return books or 
pay fines can result in six months in jail or a 
$500 fine. 

The downtown Los Angeles Central Li- 
brary will soon be going on-line with CRTs 
hooked up to IBM mainframes at the City Hall 
Data Service Bureau, giving them access to pa- 
trons' overdue book files. Several branch h- 
braries already have this system successfully in 
operation. 

The L.A. Public Library system has been a 
leader in in-house library automation, accord- 
ing to Elizabeth Higbie, who oversees the sys- 
tem from the central library. "We've been han- 



dling acquisition of books, inventory, and the 
making up of book cards on the IBM for sev- 
eral years." 

With the new patron file terminals, if some- 
one owes money, their library cards are confis- 
cated on the spot. This cuts down on repeat of- 
fenders and gives the library a front line to pro- 
tect their books and audio-visual materials. 

"The IBM terminal system is becoming a 
very valuable tool at more branches each year," 
says Higbie. 

"Before this system, we had no way of deal- 
ing with it at all, except for looking up records 
on microfiche, which was very cumbersome." 

The major stumbling block to equipping a 
library with electronics effectively has been the 
sheer size of the task. According to Higbie, "It's 
been very difficult to find a system to handle a 
public hbrary as large as this one. It takes so 
much equipment. Whenever money is avail- 
able, we start looking at new ways to auto- 
mate." 

Right now they are watching what the Chi- 
cago Public Library is doing with a newly in- 
stalled Data Phase system with one hundred ter- 
minals. "We don't want to have to start from 
scratch again," says Higbie. "It's just too ex- 
pensive." So they watch and wait patiently for 
expansion money to be budgeted their way. 
Meanwhile, the war against pilferage of books 
and audio-visual materials goes on. 

Library offenders are offlseat thieves. They 
often stick to stealing only books on their fa- 
vorite subjects. One man cleaned out all the El- 
vis records in several branches only hours after 
the star had died. 

Although most people pay their fines when 
notified to do so by mail, the worst offenders 
hold out until they have to be hunted down. 
One man owes $2,200 in books and fines to 
eight San Fernando Valley branches. Several 
hundred borrowers owe more than a thousand 
dollars each. 

□ Prisoners Pass Plato. In Stillwater, Minne- 
sota, at the State Penitenfiary, they offer an es- 
cape from the dead end of serving time — com- 
puterized rehabilitation. Their slogan might be: 
"Go to prison — earn a bachelor degree in com- 
puter programming." Stillwater inmates have 
the option to learn basic and advanced com- 
puter skills through an educational alternative 
program called Insight, Inc. 

The program was originally the dream of a 
Stillwater inmate, John P. Morgan, when he 
was in solitary confinement ten years ago. "I 
wanted to fill a void in prison education," says 
Morgan. "We had classes — some vocational 
training and the G.E.D. test (equivalent to a 
high school diploma) — but there were no sec-

Insight provides a challenging opportunity 
and is unquestionably popular. Nine inmates 
are presently enrolled. The curriculum includes 
650 hours of instruction, equivalent to twenty- 
three lower-division credits at the University of 
Minnesota. The truly ambitious can earn bache- 
lor and associate of arts degrees as computer 
technicians, systems analysts, or engineers. 

The hardware for the Insight program is 
supplied by Control Data Corporation, based 
in Minneapolis. Much of the prisoners' cur- 
riculum emulates the courses offered by the 
Control Data Institutes across the country. 



Three of Control Data's Plato terminal systems 
link the inmates' classroom in Cellblock D via 
modem to the company's Supercomputer 176, 
located in a suburb of Saint Paul. 

"Unique in the history of penology," says 
Morgan, "Insight is privately funded and in- 
mate-run." There are seventeen classes avail- 
able, and a 3.0 grade point average or better has 
been maintained. Insight has earned eighteen 
men bachelor degrees and has seen twenty-five 
men through their junior and senior years be- 
fore they were paroled. Thirty-five men have 
obtained certificates of completion in computer 
programming and operations. Since 1975, there 
have been a total of 140 participants in the 
program.

gramming and computer operations. 

Control Data is involved in prison reform at 
Stillwater even beyond the Insight program and 
Homework project. 

According to Pat McKinnie, senior public 
relations consultant. Control Data also em- 
ploys fifty-one inmates at the prison in assem- 
bling components for Control Data computers. 
To be accepted for the program, McKinnie 
says, "Applicants go through one of our pro- 
grams called Fair Break that instructs them in 
basic spelling, math, and grammar skills using 
the Plato terminals. They also learn job-seeking 
and job-retention skills that can be used in and 
out of prison." 

□ Prognosis for Arcadia. If you're an arcade 
video-game addict, you stand a 65 percent 
chance of developing arthritic conditions in 
your hands and wrists. 

That's the bad news from Dr. Gary E. 
Myerson, a video-game addict and head of the 
three-man rheumatology team that conducted a 
study of 142 Atlanta video-game patrons. The 
good news is that preliminary findings suggest 
that better design of video games, not mere ab- 
stinence following injury, could do a lot to pre- 
vent potentially serious conditions from devel- 
oping. 

The standard arcade game is ideally suited 
to persons of statistically average height — 
namely, five feet, eight inches tall, says Myer- 
son. People above and below that average show 
a marked tendency to develop temporary arth- 
ritic problems. These include neuralgic pain in 
the fingers, wrists, palms, and arms; tendonitis, 
causing local inflammation and redness, and fi- 
nally, blisters and callouses. 

In addition, standard playing consoles — 
sporting dials, buttons, and joysticks that must 
be pushed, punched, and twisted — tend to be 
improperly angled, putting additional strain on 
wrists and finger joints. Adjustable arcade seats, 
friction-free plastics for playing surfaces, and 
the use of playing gloves may be partial solu- 
tions. But only partial, Myerson adds, because 
the principal cause of injury is rapid repetition 
of one of four actions — pressing buttons, ma- 
nipulating joysticks, rotating spheres, and twist- 
ing dials. 

"Any of those motions performed at a rapid 
rate and at frequent intervals will be pain-pro- 
voking and joint-injuring," says Myerson, 
whose study evaluated fifteen popular arcade 
games. (Home computer games will be investi- 
gated in a subsequent study.) Thirteen of the ar- 
cade games required two-handed play, and all 
required at least two kinds of playing motion. 

Myerson says no particular arcade game 
studied proved particularly problem-produc- 
ing, but the investigation raised additional ques- 
tions that he and his research team plan to ex- 
plore in greater detail. On the drawing board, 
he says, is a more ambitious project calling for a 
long-term study of an entire high school class. 
Its focus will be twofold: to assess long-range

benefits, such as improved hand-eye coordina- 
tion; and to evaluate long-term susceptibilities 
of different kinds of players to chronic disor- 
ders, such as numbness or tingling sensations. 

The study represents the first statistical ap- 
proach to the subject according to the Atlanta 
rheumatologist. "This study disproves the no- 
tion that the problem is anecdotal. It's for real. 
Sixty-five percent of the people who play ar- 
cade games develop a problem." 

The problems tend to go away within twen- 
ty-four hours if a player uses common sense and 
rests the sore or inflamed joint, says Myerson, 
but he recommends abstaining forty-eight hours 
to be on the safe side. 

As for the researcher's sympathies, they are 
definitely those of a confirmed video-game ad- 
dict. "Playing a game is a great way to release 
tension and go into what I call reversible mind- 
lessness," says Myerson. "Once you start play- 
ing you're back to normal." 
□ Two-Wheel Sensation. Bicyclists in the 
California seaside community of Huntington 
Beach have good reason to believe the town is 
paving their way with good intentions. The city, 
boasting one hundred miles of bike lanes, is up- 
grading its Honeywell K-HMP 190 minicom- 
puter traffic signal system to give pedal pushers 
a little vehicular respect. 

A key new element, says traffic engineer 
Ralph Leyva, is improved amplification of road 
sensors that monitor bike lanes as well as auto 
traffic. Heavy activity in a sensored bike lane 
will activate the computerized signal, giving cy- 
clists approximately a twelve second margin to 



break away. 

In the past, cyclists had to dismount, hit a 
not-so-responsive "pedestrian button," and 
then wait for the thirty-second crossing signal. 
The new system, the first of its kind in Orange 
County, is designed primarily to increase traf- 
fic flow. 

The improved amplifiers, in operation now 
for three months, were installed at a cost of 
$1,200 per intersection. Plans call for upgrad- 
ing eleven more crossings this year. 

□ Knocking Off Chips. After designing and 
scrapping half a dozen versions of its 64K 
RAM chip, Intel introduced the finished prod- 
uct this year, months after Motorola and Texas 
Instruments put their respective versions on the 
market. 

Intel's patience and expertise were reward- 
ed early in September when International Busi- 
ness Machines contracted with the Santa Clara 
Valley firm for the design and process informa- 
tion of the component. IBM may use the tech- 
nology to produce chips in the form of Intel's 
second-generation design, the 2164A, replacing 
IBM's own slower first-generation 64K 
component. 

Intel has previously provided IBM with 16K 
chips and a microprocessor chip for the IBM 
Personal Computer. 

□ North of the Border. The Canadian gov- 
ernment is studying the social impact of new of- 
fice technologies and seeking means to help 
workers adjust to electronic office systems. To 
that end, the Electronic File Cabinet, a software 
product by Officesmiths Inc. of Ottawa, Can- 



ada, allowing access and retrieval of office docu- 
ments and information on various microcom- 
puters, will be field tested by the Canadian Min- 
istry of Energy Mines and Resources. 

Almost three quarters of a million dollars 
will be allocated over a period of two years to 
field test the software in the administrative 
branch of the finance and administration sector 
of EMR. The money will be spent under the Of- 
fice Communications Systems program, estab- 
lished in 1980 to help Canadian companies de- 
velop the industrial capacity to supply the grow- 
ing national and international markets for inte- 
grated electronic office products and services. 
The OCS program is a joint initiative of the De- 
partment of Industry, Trade, and Commerce, 
headed by Herb Gray, and the Department of 
Communications, ministered by Francis Fox. 

The trial, to be conducted in three phases, 
will involve system design and definition of 
standards conforming to the needs of its users, 
implementation of a pilot automated system for 
administrative manuals, and introduction of an 
integrated system of administrative support in- 
formation for use in regional offices across the 
country. Studies will also be undertaken on user 
satisfaction and administrative productivity, 
and a report entitled "What Happens to Your 
Office When Your Administrative Support Sys- 
tem Is Automated" will be issued. 

The trial will be implemented in consulta- 
tion with affected workers, who will assist in the 
design of the system and development of train- 
ing and education programs on a voluntary 
basis. Hi

More tips from the authors of Beneath Apple DOS . . . 

Ba^ofTrkKs 

By Don Worth and Pieter Lechner 

Now there is more from the authors of the best selling book Beneath 
Apple DOS — four comprehensive utility programs on diskette and 
over 100 more pages of valuable information about the Apple H's 
disk operating system. 

BAG OF TRICKS is useful to beginners and experienced programmers 
alike. It includes many "hand holding" tutorials that assist you in 
repairing damaged diskettes and allow you to change sector ordering, 
reconstruct blown catalogs, etc. etc. etc. At the low price of S39.95, 
BAG OF TRICKS is one of the best software values ever 

The four programs and their functions are; 

1. TRAX dumps and examines a raw track, either 13-sector or 16- 
sector, displays the internal Apple diskette formatting 
information, and flags exceptions to standard formats. 

2. INIT will reformat one or more tracks, attempting to preserve 
the contents of undamaged sectors. It also allows you to change 
sector order. This can cut disk access times by 40% or morel 

3. ZAP is a sector editor like no other! More than 50 commands are 
available to assist you to locate, compare, change, or print the 
data on your diskettes. ZAP is even programmable! Using 
powerful macros, it is possible to transfer and compare DOS, 
CP/M, or PASCAL files. 

4. FIXCAT automates the process of repairing a damaged diskette 
catalog. It operates with or without user intervention, locating 
"lost" files and rebuilding the catalog — from scratch if necessary! 
DOS removal and VTOC repair are also possible. 

Requires Apple II or Apple II Plus $39.95 
with 48K RAM and one disk drive

Softalk Presents Tlie Bestsellers 



In baseball, it's traditional to talk about the dog days of August. By 
that time the season's almost over, the heat is at its worst, and most of 
the teams have been effectively eliminated from the pennant races. It's 
then that it gets tough for a player to get motivated. 

August is taking on similar negative meaning for purveyors of prod- 
uct in the Apple marketplace. In the previous two years, August repre- 
sented the end of a slow summer period that extended from Memorial 
Day through Labor Day. But this year, August managed to stake out its 
own claim to infamy by being the worst month of all. 

Systems sales held reasonably steady because of Apple's aggressive 
marketing, represented by the Family Pack for the Apple II and the Pro- 
fessional Solution for the Apple III. But software and peripherals tended 
to gather dust. 

Particularly hard hit by the unexpected sales slump were games. En- 
tertainment software has been holding its share of the market, even 
though the flood of different titles has spread the same dollars over more 
titles. But in August, entertainment sales were off considerably. It is not 
correct to assume that serious applications software benefited at the ex-

pense of games. Nationwide business software sales were flat; games 
were down. 

Even in awful August, there were some things of interest. One was 
the resurgence of Ultima, which oddly enough reflects on the pulling 
power of Wizardry. . 

Wizardry remained fourth and held its own against the entertain- 
ment downturn. Its companion piece, Knight of Diamonds, did compar- 
atively better than most games, slipping only one notch, from ninth to 
tenth. But the two Sir-tech products have fueled a demand for more fan- 
tasy role-playing games, and dealers have turned to Ultima to satisfy this 
demand. Ultima's August sales equaled the sales of the prior two months 
and were enough to place Lord British's year-old program in a five-way 
tie for the lowest spot on the Top Thirty. It was the first Top Thirty 
showing in several months for the former bestselling game. 

Also rising in sales in the face of the slowdown was Escape from 
Rungistan, Sirius Software's latest hi-res adventure. It now doubles the 
sales of any other adventure game in the Apple market. Another oldie- 
but-goodie. The Wizard and the Princess from Sierra On-Line, rose to 
second place in the Adventure 5, with Infocom capturing the remaining 
three places with Deadline, Zork II, and Zork I. 

Also bullish in a bear market were two new products from Broder- 
bund Software. Serpentine made twenty-sixth and the long-awaited 
Arcade Machine was among the programs tied with Ultima for twenty- 
seventh. The new products made August a banner month for theBroder- 



bundians. Choplifter remained the runaway bestseller in the Apple 
market and Star Blazer maintained its eleventh rank in the Top Thirty. 

The software most often carried out of the retail store in August, as 
in July, was Apple Writer II. Paul Lutus's word processor was bundled 
into the Family Pack, and more than twice as many as Choplifter were 
actually put into the hands of end users. Apple Writer II did well even 
after deducting those bundled with systems, ranking sixth overall and 
second among word processing programs. 

Screen Writer II from Sierra On-Line continued as the most popular 
word processor. WordStar and Word Handler also made the Top Thirty, 
reflecting the increased use of the Apple II for word processing.

Few of the changes in the Top Thirty were of a dramatic nature, 
most reflecting the general sluggishness of the market. No new program 
was able to crack the top eleven positions. Within the Top Thirty, 
MasterType made the biggest move, going from twenty-first to twelfth. 
MasterType sugar-coats its educational intent with an arcade frosting 
and apparently is the forerunner of a new breed of educational software. 
Among other companies, the Learning Company and Spinnaker will be 
introducing products with a similar approach to education in the hopes 
of invigorating what has been a relatively moribund home educational 
market. 

Because sales were slow, there were few changes in the speciality lists.

1st CLASS MAIL. By Bob Schoenburg and Steve Pollack. 
Here's a pair of authors who may be software's answer 
to Irving Wallace. Wallace is the bestselling author who 
hears the murmuring of general populace and caters to 
their desires. Bob Schoenburg and Steve Pollack seem 
to have the same trait. 
Consider. 

The pair brought out Home Money Minder, a 
perfectly respectable home finance package. Then they 
listened to the user feedback. The result was Home 
Accountant, one of the phenomenal success stories of the 
first half of 1982. 

Around the same time Home Money Minder hit, the 
team also tested the market with The Mailroom. 
Mailroom never was the success of HMM, but the authors 
used the same technique — listen to the users and in- 
corporate all the good ideas. The result is 1st CLASS 
MAIL - a program that, incredibly enough, manages to 
live up to its double-entendre name. 

All of the above is not to accuse Schoenburg and 
Pollack of putting out the programming equivalent of 
stalking-horses to do their market research for them. 
Their original efforts do stand on their ovra merit. They 
just pale next to the sequels. 

1st CLASS MAIL is so well thought out and so easy 
to use that other publishers who call their programs ' 'user 
friendly" should bow their heads in shame. 

SOFTALK got an early release of the program sans 
documentation. Yet a rank computer illiterate was able 
to apply the program to two separate uses with relatively 
little trouble. This is high praise indeed: that a novice 
operator could use a powerful program with no more 
than the screen menus. 

The program allows for twelve fields, clearly more 
than the traditional name and address of a mailing label. 
The implication is that the software can be put to other 
innovative uses as well. The built-in ability to sort and 
filter on any field or combination thereof enhances the 
chances that users will find multiple applications for 
the program. 

Continental Software will actually be publishing 
four versions of the program.* The one already in release 
is for the Apple II using floppy disks. A hard-disk ver- 
sion will follow. Both versions are pending for Apple III 
as well, awaiting the development of a rapid binary sort 
subroutine. 

1st CLASS MAIL is a first-rate program for special- 
ized data base applications.

A typing program for the Apple II that 
dares to be fun. But it's not just child's play. 
No matter who you are, your computer will 
become a more efficient tool, as you become 
a more proficient typist. And MasterType 
can help. Dramatically 

But don't just take our word for it. 

Infoworld magazine had this to say 
about Lightning Software's Hi-Res MasterType: 
"MasterType is an excellent instructional 
typing game. We had fun reviewing it, and 
we highly recommend it to those who 
want to learn typing in an unconventional 
but motivating way" 

Infoworld also went on to rate Master- 
Type as Excellent in all categories.

bution of Apple Writer II to new system owners. 

Home Accountant and MasterType continued atop the Home 10, but 
the big news is Transend, which remained third in the Home list while ris- 
ing to seventeenth on the Top Thirty. SSM bundles a membership to the 
Source with its Transend packages, making it an attractive purchase for 
those interested in telecommunications through computer. 

Personal Finance Manager from Apple jumped to fourth on the 
Home 10 and regained the Top Thirty in twenty-third place. The only 
newcomer to the Home list was the Dow Jones Portfolio Evaluator. 

The Hobby 10 list continues to be dominated by the unprotected 
software published by Beagle Bros and Penguin. DOS Boss rose to first 
on the list and tied for twenty-seventh on the Top Thirty. Other Beagle 
Bros products on the list are Utility City and A pple Mechanic. Penguin's 
Complete Graphics System rose to second and was joined on the list by 
Graphics Magician and Special Effects from Penguin. 

New this month to the Hobby list were DOS Tool Kit from Apple 
and the TASC compiler from Microsoft. 

There were no changes in the Fantasy 5 list, but there was some shuf- 
fling in the Strategy 5 category. 

Edu-Ware's Rendezvous gained a notch to second and Strategic 



Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 5.4 percent of the sales of 
Apples and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in September to ascertain their sales leaders for 
the month of August. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was number of sales made — such other cri- 
teria as quality of product, profitability to the computer retailer, and personal prefer- 
ence of the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in September represented every geographical area of the continental 
United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index 
number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is an 
arbitrary measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are correla- 
tive only for the month in which they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index 
rating of 50 in one month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in an- 
other month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus-or-minus 5.3 percent, which translates roughly 
into the theoretical possibility of a change of 4.03 points, plus or minus, in any index 
number. 



Simulations's Cytron Masters tied for fourth. Hot among the newcom- 
ers but not yet on the Strategy 5 was Spitfire Simulator from Mind Sys- 
tems and another SSI entry. Galactic Gladiators. 

The Apple III market was also static, with the first six programs 
holding their respective ranks. Apple Writer III closed the ranks on 
VisiCalc, which was being bundled in the Professional Solution special, 
in the battle for the top spot. 

New to the list were VisiSchedule from VisiCorp and VersaForm 
from Applied Software Technology. 

Generally, August was a month best forgotten by most retailers and 
software publishers. But, as Softalk conducted its poll in early Septem- 
ber, retailers were reporting an encouraging and significant uptick that 
bodes well for the market through year end. New product already in- 
troduced or on its way promises to make the Christmas season a mon- 
ster one. It's just too bad Christmas isn't in the month after August.
