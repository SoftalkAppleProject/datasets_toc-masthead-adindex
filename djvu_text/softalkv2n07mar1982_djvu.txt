Many people think just because a computer does 
difficult things, it must be difficult to operate. Not so. 
At least not with PFS *" and PFS: REPORT. 

PFS and PFS: REPORT let you concentrate on 
doing your work, not on working your computer. There's 
no complicated programming or computer language to 
leam. Using the PFS Series is so straightforward, you 
can leam it in as little as 20 minutes, and that's some- 
thing both experts and beginners can appreciate. 

Design your own management system, simply. 

PFS lets you arrange your information in "forms" 
you design yourself. Once you've created your form— 
with spaces for all the necessary data— you simply fill 
in the blanks. 

If you don't like the original form, PFS lets you 
change just the form, without having to totally re-enter 
the information on it. 

To use your forms, just call up the information 
you want in a variety of ways such 
as "less thanj' "more than," "equal 
to;' "between" or "not." You can 
even find specific charac 
ters, words, names or num 
bers. And PFS can also 
sort labels, change its 



Hardworking 
software for Apples 
that isn't a lot of work. 



40-column format to accommodate larger printouts, 
and tell you how much room you have left on your disk. 
Get more out of what you put in. 

PFS: REPORT sorts, calculates, totals, formats 
and prints presentation-quality reports with up to 9 col- 
umns, in alpha or numeric order, with automatic 
entering and justification. With your information in 
this format, you can analyze it quickly to help spot 
trends, plan and make decisions. 

A whole family of software for Apple® II and III. 

PFS consistently ranks among the 5 top-selling 
business software packages for Apples. Because you 
can use it for almost anything— from chemical analyses 
to keeping track of your wine collection, from bal- 
ancing your checkbook to computing your payroll. 
And there are more programs on the way. 

For a free, hands-on demonstration of PFS and 
PFS: REPORT, stop by your local computer store. If 
they don't have it yet, tell them to 
call Software Publishing Corpora- 
ation at (415) 962-8910. Or write 
1901 Landings Dr., Moun- 
tain View, C A 94043. 

You'll be amazed at 
how much you can bite off.

What better way to celebrate the 
spring equinox than with a chance to win 
a second Apple disk drive? The Chris 
Lights, junior and senior, have collabo- 
rated on a very special Apple trivia quiz 
to make sure you'll have earned the disk 
drive if you win it. 

You'll have until June 15, 1982, to get 
your answers back to Softalk. Take care 
and be precise. In case of apparent ties, 
more precise answers will win over less 
precise answers before chance steps in. 

If no one gets all the answers to Ap- 
pletrivia correct, that entry with the 
most correct answers will win. In the 
case of a tie, the random number gen- 
erator will be called into play. Second 
place winner may choose $50 worth of 
prizes from goods created by Softalk ad- 
vertisers. Third, fourth, and fifth places 
each win an extra year's free subscrip- 
tion to Softalk. And don't forget that all 



entrants are, by virtue of entering, en- 
titled to subscribe to Softalk at the $18 
sponsored rate. 

So fill out the entry form on this page 
and mail it and your answers— printed, 
computer printed, or typed, but legible— 
to Softalk Appletrivia, 11021 Magnolia 
Boulevard, North Hollywood, CA 91601.

Although some of the questions ap- 
pear to be devilishly hard — as they're in- 
tended to be — all questions are in one 
way or another related to the Apple com- 
puter, peripheral hardware for it, soft- 
ware for it, or material written about it. 
All sources for the questions have been 
circulated nationally and have been gen- 
erally available at one time or another. 
Just because you own an Apple, you'll al- 
ready know some of the answers. Other 
answers will require considerable effort. 
Good luck!

Contest Contest Revisited. Philip 
Sun's first-prize-winning Apple Jumble 
has turned out to be one of Softalk's most 
popular contests, despite the misspelling 
of Hectar Plagbits's name. Most en- 
trants caught the error and took the cor- 
rect spelling from the name tags illus- 
trating the story; a few folks even en- 
joyed the added challenge. 

Coincidentally, Sun and Alan Nayer, 
one of the Contest Contest runnersup, both 
frequent AIDS Computer Center in San 
Francisco. Store vice president Ray- 
mond Tong arranged for them to pick up 
their prizes at the same time and 
snapped their picture together. Results 
are not yet in on Nayer 's contest, ASCII 
Railroad, which appeared in February's 
Soft alk. 

Art Gallery. Talent, it would appear, 
takes second place only to spirit among 
Softalk readers. A surprising number of 
talented people entered our November 
Art Gallery contest, especially in the 
computer-generated design division. 

The task was to design a package for 
an imaginary or real software program, 
then to render the design either by hand 



or by computer. Most entrants chose the 
imaginary, and some even included de- 
scriptions of the games they were repre- 
senting. Good ideas, too. 

The Softalk staff has chosen six hand- 
done and six computer-rendered de- 
signs. It's up to you to vote for the one in 
each category that you like best, and the 
two that get the most votes will win the 
first prizes. 

Two of the entries below, The Wind 
and Land of the Pharaohs, came with de- 
tailed descriptions of the games but with- 
out titles and imaginary logos, probably 
because of lack of knowledge of how to 
combine these with the paintings in slide 
form. Because of the quality of the art- 
work, we believed they should be includ- 
ed anyway. 

To keep the vote fair, the order in 
which the finalists are listed is unrelated 
to the order of the art works. Finalists, 
who will receive $10 credits at their local 
computer dealers and an additional 
year's free subscription to Softalk if they 
don't win, are: Eddie Moore, Mesquite, 
Texas; Jeff Coyle, Anaheim, California; 
Ben Lanterman, Bridgeton, Missouri; 
Nathan Jensen, Austin, Texas; Mary Cic- 
colella, Piscataway, New Jersey; Bob 
Martin, Boulder, Colorado; Chuck Ar- 
nold, Dalton, Georgia; Wendel Kirk- 
bride, Idaho Falls, Idaho; Mildred Ed- 
wards, Waterloo, Iowa; and Brian Tay- 
lor, Pasadena, California. If you counted 
fewer entrants than entries, you're 
sharp; two entries each from two people 
made the finals. 

Election Bonus Sweeps. There's more 
than one reason to vote for the artists you 
like best. Not only does it support your 
fellow readers, but your ballot is your 
automatic entry into the other kind of 
drawing. Ballots will be numbered as 
they come in. On or soon after April 16, 
the random number generator will be put 
to work, and the person whose ballot 
number corresponds to the number the 
rng chose will win $100 in products of ad- 
vertisers in Softalk. 



Starfire 5. The disk drive that won't play hide-and-seek 





What do we mean by that? 

You chose the Apple II, and it's a good 
computer choice. 

But Apple diskette drives play hide-and- 
seek with your valuable data. 

And if you're not looking for a diskette, 
you're worrying about scratching one. 

Besides, they're just too slow and hold too 
little. 

That's why your Apple II needs a REAL 
business partner. 

Like Starfire 5, the 5 Megabyte Winchester 
disk from Corona. 



The one that holds 38 diskettes of data, 
available instantly, and can alphabetize 
a mailing list 5 to 10 times faster. 

The one that seals your data off from 
danger and insures it with DataGuard 
automatic data protection. 

Double-volume data files. 

And best of all, Starfire 5 lets your files be 
twice as long, beating a crucial limitation 
of Apple's disk operating system, without 
abandoning it. 

That's the kind of partner your Apple II 
needs to let it fulfill its computer promise. 



At $2995, it's quite a deal. 

So ask your dealer to show you Starfire 5 
from Corona. 

Or call us for the local dealer who can. 

Because Starfire 5 is the BUSINESS partner 
for your Apple II,

Words from a Winner 
Just a note to thank you again for the 
Oracle '81 prize. Everyone here has been 
very excited about the contest, although I 
must say that I'm glad it's over! A few 
days ago we took a picture of me picking 
up the disk drive at AM which you should 
have already received. 

Well, it's been a lot of fun and thank 
you all again, not only for the disk drive 
but for producing my favorite Apple 
magazine — I really appreciate the time 
and effort that must go into making it 
what it is. 

Jim Ganz, West Hartford, CT 

Getting Straight on the Beagle Bros. 

I saw in your January Hobby 10 list that 
you finally listed Jack Cassidy as coau- 
thor of DOS Boss. That's correct; we 
wrote that one together. 

However, you also show him on the 
same list as coauthor of Utility City. 
That's wrong! I wrote Utility City by my- 
self; he had nothing to do with it! 

Lookit ; I work my fingers to the bone 
on this software, and all the while that 
egomaniac is sitting at home watching 
soap operas and writing letters to Sof- 
talk. That guy will try to take credit for 
anything! He once told me he wrote Visi- 
Calc! 

But don't let him intimidate you. The 
true program authors are listed in our 
ads. And you can tell by looking at his 
picture (January, page 65) that he has 
shifty eyes. 

Bert Kersey, San Diego, CA 
On Subscriptions 

I've had an Apple since early 1980, and 
have been getting your magazine since 
issue 01. 1 want you to know I'll be happy 
to pay for it. My wife and I subscribe to 
about twenty publications — important 
stuff like Barron's, Business Week, Sci- 
ence News, National Geographic, and so 
on. I even get a stack of computer maga- 
zines. But Softalk is the only one I pounce 
on and devour the day it is delivered. 

I am a journalist by trade and a con- 
sultant by profession. I use your maga- 
zine as an example when trying to ex- 
plain to Editorial Types the importance 
of advertising as editorial material. For 
while I gain a lot from your articles and 
reviews, I am also intensely interested in 
the ads. 

It has been a pleasure watching you 
grow from that first skinny issue seven- 
teen months ago. I wish you good luck in 
your conversion to a subscription publi- 
cation. I don't think you'll have any trou- 
ble at all. 

Tom Weishaar, Overland Park, KS 

For the last few months I have had a 
gripe about your magazine. It's not with 
Softalk itself, but with the cover. Every 
issue I have received from your compa- 
ny has had the cover fallen off of it. So 
when January's issue came along, I was 
not really surprised. But by looking 



OPEN 

Discussion 



Penguin Pioneers Unprotected Good Will 

Penguin Software announces a new policy on copy protection: an open letter to 
all Apple owners. 

In conjunction with the release of The Graphics Magician and the updated 
Complete Graphics System II, Penguin Software is announcing a new policy 
with our applications software for the Apple. The Complete Graphics System II, 
Special Effects, and The Graphics Magician will all now be available on non- 
protected disks. 

We've been torn between two points of view. As computer users, we appre- 
ciate the ability to have several working copies of our applications software, and 
even the ability to go in and modify the code, if desired. We'd use programs such 
as VisiCalc or DB Master for dozens of other applications if we could have them 
running off several separate disks and didn't have to guard our master copies 
with such extreme care. Being programmers also, occasionally we'd like to 
adapt a program slightly to our system or our needs. On locked disks, much of a 
software product's potential usage goes untapped. 

On the other hand, as publishers we've been drawn into the prevailing point 
of view that lack of copy protection means greatly decreased sales due to cas- 
ual "piracy." This is not just a crazed overreaction ; we've all been to user group 
meetings, homes of acquaintances, and even some computer stores where 
we've been aghast at the almost encouraging attitude toward copying copy- 
righted software, most of which took authors months, maybe years, to perfect. 

The real scare here is that many of us have decided to take a risk on a very 
new industry and trust our livelihoods to it. Suddenly, individuals out there be- 
come statistics, some of which say that for every nonprotected program sold 
there are at least a dozen "pirated" copies. Those kind of numbers could really 
wreak havoc on paying the bills. Scary? Yes. 

From these conflicting points of view, our desire to make a good product bet- 
ter won, but not by much, over our fear of tampering with something that is al- 
ready going well. Our policies, from pricing to support, have always been very 
consumer-oriented. Ultimately, it is from that viewpoint that we decided to go 
ahead with removing the protection. We feel that you, the consumer, are enti- 
tled to software as useful as possible for the money you spend. 

Our hope is that the added convenience will result in more sales, not less, and 
that the software market has matured to the point where people realize that the 
result of illegal copying is less convenience for everyone with all software. We 
hope that people will think twice before accepting copies from friends, and we 
hope to be able to continue this policy and start a new trend toward improved us- 
ability of all applications software. 

Please don't abuse our trust in you. 

Mark Pelczarski, President, Penguin Software

through the best Apple II magazine, I 
saw your article about distribution pol- 
icy and thought right away that Softalk 
would not be free to me anymore. Now I 
know most of us computerholics of the 
world are disappointed. But I'll put it to 
you straight. I imagine that everyone will 
be happy to comply with paying for Sof- 
talk, because it's invaluable to the health 
of us and our Apples no matter what the 
price. (And thanks for the new cover pro- 
tection.) Keep up the good work. 

P.S. Now I can get back to playing 
Gorgon. 

Steve Cohen, Thousand Oaks, CA 

The purpose of this letter is to give you 
my views concerning your change in pol- 
icy by going to subscription rates. Up un- 
til now you have been giving the Apple 
user something for which they invested 
only time and thought to consume. 

For this, I am appreciative and have 
read your magazine thoroughly. With 
that policy, your obligation to the read- 
ing public is minimal . . . user beware. 
Anything advertised in your magazine 
has been helping to, or has paid for my 
subscription price. Once you begin charg- 
ing the reader for the right to read your 
magazine, you have committed yourself 
to an additional obligation. No longer has 
the advertiser in your magazine as sig- 
nificant a part in furnishing the maga- 
zine to the reader. 

If I am to pay $2.50 monthly for your 
magazine, I expect you to exercise edi- 
torial license to evaluate all advertise- 
ments in your journal. I consider you re- 
sponsible to back claims made in your 
ads. Consumer's Union charges $1.50 per 
month for their consumer's report, they 
have no advertisements and they objec- 
tively evaluate all merchandise dis- 
cussed. Are you willing to make that 
step? 

At least 50 percent of the software and 
hardware advertised in your magazine 
is not as good as the advertisement 
promises. I have several items sitting in 
my shelf to prove this point, i.e., Easy 
Writer, DB Master, Data Factory, Apple 
Paddles, Broderbund Payroll Program, 
Videx eighty-column card, Charles Mann 
Payroll and Accounts Payable pro- 
grams. 

I have several good programs as well 
. . . including VisiFile and VisiCalc. If the 
increase in the amount of advertising in 
your magazine still does not pay your ex- 
penses, I would think you need to reeval- 
uate your advertising charges. If, on the 
other hand, the reason for this move is a 
matter of supply and demand . . . there is 
no question that there is a great demand 
for your magazine . . . then please be 
honest with the public. 
Darrell H. Hunsaker, M.D., FACS, P.S., 
Yakima, WA 

The percentage of ads to editorial in 
Softalk has not increased; the circula- 
tion has skyrocketed. To charge the ad- 



vertisers accordingly would put ad prices 
out of reach of all but a handful of manu- 
facturers — not nearly enough to support 
even a thirty-two page book such as our 
premiere issue. The alternative would be 
to limit circulation. Will you take the re- 
sponsibility of telling half our sub- 
scribers and all new Apple owners that 
they can't get Softalk at all because Dar- 
rell Hunsaker wants his free ? 

To test the products of every adver- 
tiser would entail — among many other 
practical problems — a separate staff that 
did nothing else — driving our cost and 
yours skyhigh. Refer to Marketalk Re- 
views for our opinions. Incidentally, 
Videx and Charles Mann have never ad- 
vertised in Softalk; nor has Apple adver- 
tised its paddles. 

As to other reasons, and your impli- 
cation that (horrors!) we might be will- 
ing to take a profit, we do indeed look for- 
ward to such a day. The principals of Sof- 
talk have yet to take a full salary. 

A Generous Spirit 

I think Softalk is the best computer 
magazine currently being published, 
and, although I'm sorry to see you end 
your free distribution policy, I will be 
glad to pay for it. You have had a phe- 
nomenal degree of success, going from a 
slim little magazine mostly in black-and- 
white to an enormous one full of color pic- 
tures, all in just a little over a year. 
I have a few comments to make 



about letters in your letter column. As for 
Paul Wilson's contention that it is stupid 
to publish your programs in a magazine 
rather than market them, I disagree. It 
takes a lot of time, effort, and money to 
market a program. If you want to do all 
that, you have to feel a program is really 
marketable. All-text adventures, such as 
the ones described in the letter, probably 
do not have that much of a market now, 
due to competition from the many so- 
phisticated hi-res ones. To succeed, an 
all-text game needs to have a really novel 
twist. However, simple text adventures 
can still be very entertaining, both to 
play and to program. As a matter of fact, 
I have recently written two of them my- 
self. Since, as I said, they probably are 
not very marketable, I submitted them to 
Softdisk Magazette, which is "throwing 
them away" according to Mr. Wilson. I 
don't feel that, as writing the programs 
was a good exercise of my programming 
skill, and I hope they provide entertain- 
ment to the subscribers. As a subscriber, 
I hope other readers take the same pride 
in creating quality programs to submit; 
this makes the publication (in this case a 
magazine on diskette, but the same is 
true of print magazines including soft- 
ware) better for everyone. 

Adding my input to the ongoing ob- 
scenity controversy, if, as you state, 
more people have supported you for pub- 
lishing the so-called "obscene" ads than 
have denounced you, why have you only

printed the letters of those who criticize 
your publishing of these ads? I think it 
would be fair to print letters from both 
sides. The letters you have published 
seem to show your readers to be of a puri- 
tanical morality, rather than of the for- 
ward-thinking type that I would expect 
most computer users to be. While the so- 
called Moral Majority (really an im- 
moral minority) is attempting to throw 
the country back one hundred years, 
throwing out the First Amendment in the 
process, I think publications such as 
yours should fight this.

Thanks, Coach 

I have never written (or 'APPLE- 
WROTE') a letter to any editor or au- 
thor, but I was so enjoyably enlightened 
by your article "All About Applesoft" 
that I was truly compelled to write to 
thank you. 

I have had my Apple for about three 
months and I have been very successful 
in utilizing some of the software on the 
market. During these months I have 
spent many hours trying to work through 
the Apple manuals to learn also to pro- 
gram. Frustrated and confused I would 
resort to a favorite game program to un- 
wind. I decided that I must find some 
book or some person that would "break" 
my Apple into edible and understand- 
able bytes, so I visited my local comput- 



er store and looked through every book 
on their shelves to find that one author 
who would talk to me in bits. I came 
home to find my second issue of Softalk in 
the mailbox. Wrongly, I thought to my- 
self, "Self, here is another 'over my head' 
computer magazine" when I spied (af- 
ter your new subscription policy) "All 
About Applesoft." Anxiously, I raced 
through all necessary duties, chores and 
amenities of the day and finally sat down 
to try to figure out the APPLETRUTH as 
told by Doug Carlston. I started getting 
excited as I read each sentence with un- 
derstanding and not frustration. Just to 
prove to myself that I did understand, I 
listed the first program without peeking 
(or is it poking?). I was so pleased that 
my APPLEMONSTER now hears and 
obeys its Master's voice, that I was com- 
pelled to tell you my story and thank you 
for beginning to teach me to talk to my 
new APPLEFRIEND. 

Please advise me if this article is part 
of a book you have written or must I keep 
bugging my mailperson each month to 
quickly deliver my Softalk. 

With your help, by the time my free 
subscription runs out, I'll be able to ap- 
preciate all of Softalk and will gladly buy 
a subscription! 

I think David summed it up best after 
learning how to slay Goliath when he said 
"Thanks, Coach!"

A Light Trip 

That four-page "ego trip" you allowed 
Christopher U. Light to indulge himself in 
his column Ventures with VisiCalc this 
month is uncalled for. 

You certainly must have some feel- 
ing for how much help such a column 
could be. 

Of course, I am interested in paying 
for my subscription to Softalk. The 
magazine is current, it addresses itself to 
my hardware, and I believe, overall, 
makes a contribution to my effort and un- 
derstanding. It goes without saying, how- 
ever, that articles of that nature certain- 
ly don't encourage me.

Clones? 

I've been waiting awhile for an excuse to 
write a letter! In January '82 Open Dis- 
cussion you said, in response to a ques- 
tion, that one can never have two pro- 
grams with precisely the same name on 
the same disk. Unfortunately, this is not 
true. You can "rename" every file on a 
certain disk to have the same file name. 

On another subject, does anyone know 
of a way to enlarge hi-res screen print- 
outs on the Epson Mx-80FT? 

I think there should be a separate cat- 
egory of the bestseller lists for games. 

Anyhow, I want to congratulate Sof- 
talk on keeping me up to date on every 
aspect of the Apple world. I am sure it is 
an arduous task.

Family Game in Demand 
Perhaps you can help me obtain a spe- 
cific program for my Apple. Some time 
back I purchased a copy of Warlords, 
produced by Speakeasy Software, 
Kemptville, Ontario, Canada. It was on 
tape, which fit my system at the time. 
My family and I liked it a lot, especially 
since it involved all four of us together. 
After a while the tape developed a glitch, 
and refused to load the second half of the 
program. I sent it back, along with an ex- 
planation, requesting a working tape. 
Since then I have called the phone num- 
ber listed in their literature, and written 
additional letters, all to no avail. I heard 
a rumor that Speakeasy is no more, also. 

What I want is to get a working copy 
of the game, so that I can put it onto a 
disk and make a few changes to improve 
it, and so on. The game was not sophisti- 
cated by current standards, but we liked

Can You Justify Those Numbers? 

My Apple II Plus and I appreciate very 
much receiving your outstanding maga- 
zine. It's been a big help. 

As an old Fortran fan, I've come to 
appreciate the many excellent features 
of APPLESOFT a great deal— except for 
one : the difficulty in right- justifying col- 
umns of numbers, especially when trail- 
ing zeroes are needed. While there are so- 
lutions — and even an example program 
in the reference manual — they seem to 
be computationally inefficient. I've never 
completely solved the problem, but have 
come up with a useful algorithm for 
right- justifying data, to wit: 

10 B$=" " :REM - INITIALIZE BLANK MASK 
15 N = 15 =REM - INITIALIZE COLUMN WIDTH 
20 V = any expression :REM - COMPUTE 

NUMBER TO BE PRINTED 
25 FOR 1 = 1 TO 4 

30 PRINT RIGHTS (B$+STR$( V )+" ", N); :REM 
- PRINT THE VALUE OF V IN A COLUMN N 
SPACES WIDE 

35 NEXT I 

The above will print V four times (for 
example, as the first row in four col- 
umns of numbers) in a relatively neat 
format, with each column precisely N 



spaces wide including leading and trail- 
ing blanks. In this example, B$ supplies 
the leading blanks necessary to right- jus- 
tify the numbers, and +" " concatenates 
an additional blank to the end of the num- 
ber for positive spacing. While one must 
be sure that V won't require more than 
N-2 digits to use the algorithm — else sig- 
nificant digits will be lost— it's more con- 
venient than PRINT SPC(N-LEN(STR- 
$(V)));STR$(V);SPC(20); I hope it 
helps someone. 

Paul T. Burnett, Alamogordo, NM 
More on Crystal 

The letter from P. T. Carroll, Fort Story, 
Virginia, in the December 1981 issue of 
Softalk prompted me to write. Mr. Car- 
roll described the recurrent problems he 
has had with Lasar Wars from Crystal 
Software. I'd like to mention some simi- 
lar problems that I've had with another 
of their programs, Sands of Mars. Ap- 
parently, I purchased one of the first 
copies of Sands of Mars, because it con- 
tained over ten major errors, several of 
which were serious enough to require re- 
setting the computer and aborting the 
program. 

In May 1981, 1 began a long and frus- 
trating correspondence with John Bell, 
the president of Crystal computer. First, 
Mr. Bell acknowledged that there were 



several bugs in the "original version" of 
Sands of Mars, and supplied me with a 
print-out of the corrections. He request- 
ed that the purchasers of the first copies 
inform him of any additional bugs and 
promised that they would be reimbursed 
$10 per original bug. I phoned Crystal 
that day and informed them of four bugs 
which I had discovered, but which were 
not mentioned in his corrections. I also 
sent a letter to Crystal that same day, de- 
tailing a total of nine new bugs and their 
corrections. A few days later, Mr. Bell's 
wife wrote, thanking me for my letter, 
and enclosing a new copy of the pro- 
gram. This new disk had not even been 
initialized and, of course, it would not 
boot on my Apple. I wrote again to Mr. 
Bell, informing him of this, and inquir- 
ing about the bugs and corrections that I 
had supplied. He sent me a third copy of 
Sands of Mars. It, too, had some of the 
same serious problems. Mr. Bell men- 
tioned he had not received my correc-

Listing Lapses 

I just received my first issue of Softalk, 
and I love it already! As a new Apple 
owner, I think it's better than having a 
second disk drive. 

However, I do agree with David Fell- 
man (I'm glad to see I agree with an- 
other Rochesterian, too!) that you should 
publish listings in a form that would be a 
facsimile of the actual working pro- 
gram. Typesetting involves at least one 
human operation, and that opens the door 
for errors. Since the Apple, like all its 
brethren brains of copper and silicon, is 
very unforgiving when it comes to typos, 
typeset solutions can often cause more 
work than they save. 

A case in point: Richard Patton's pro- 
gram for converting hexidecimal num- 
bers is a very handy thing to have 
around. I have no great difficulty doing 
the conversion on a calculator that I keep 
on the desk within arm's reach of the Ap- 
ple, but, as I said before, humans make 
mistakes. And even an obvious error can 
hide itself for hours before you find it . . . 
like the error in line 150 of Dave's pro- 
gram. It should read: 

150 PRINT "AN ILLEGAL CHARACTER WAS 

DETECTED IN THE INPUT STRING. IT IS - 
"MID$(A$,N,1): RESTORE: GOTO 30 

Another: Robert Leedom's sugges- 
tion to eliminate the glitch in Renumber 
is something every Green Apple should 
know about. But how does a Green Apple 
actually do it? I'll tell you how! He 
spends hours, hours he can ill afford 
sometimes, pouring over the manuals, 
researching areas of programming that

One is the Heuristics H2000 and the 
other is the Cognivox VIO-1003 by Voice-

However the cursor drops two lines after

Let's Put Apples in the PX 

This [letter] concerns the recent policy 
action by Apple Computer — that policy 
that eliminates mail order sales of Apple 
products. I have been an Apple owner 
since mid-1979. Since then I've expanded 
my system to disk drives and Silentype 
printer, as well as other accessories. I 
felt very strongly about the Apple com- 
puter — and the company — and have 
heartily recommended it to other non- 
computer owners. 

No longer!!! Apple's policy of pro- 
hibiting Apple sales by mail is ludicrous. 
All of my hardware and most of my soft- 
ware has been obtained by mail order. 
Why? Because I, like thousands of 
others, am in the military and am sta- 
tioned overseas where the only method of 
obtaining Apple products is by mail. 

I am president of Manzana Panama, 
the Panama Apple Users Group. Over 90 



percent of our membership is made up of 
military members, and all but one ob- 
tained their computers by mail order. By 
prohibiting mail order sales, Apple has 
effectively cut off all sales to overseas 
personnel who simply cannot "walk into 
a local store" to buy an Apple. Even if 
there is a dealer overseas, the military 
member must now pay local prices 
(which often include import taxes) that 
are well above list price. 

I understand one of the reasons for the 
curtailment was because of a lack of 
dealer service. Well there is a common 
concept when dealing with mail order 
firms — caveat emptor. We are well 
aware of the risk associated with mail or- 
der, but we are willing to undertake that 
risk! I would rather take a chance on ser- 
vice with the firm I ordered the comput- 
er from than not have a computer. Local 
word of mouth is very effective in deter- 
mining the best mail order firms — look at 
the success of Huntington. 

The net result is that I can no longer 
support Apple Computer Inc. nor Apple 
products. Those individuals who come to 
me asking me what computer to buy, I 
can now only refer them to the Atari, or 
IBM, or other computers that can be mail 
ordered easily. Additionally, all other pe- 
ripheral equipment I buy will be manu- 
factured by other companies (Lobo, Vis- 
ta, and so on). 

I realize these actions on my part will 
have little impact. But I cannot help but 
feel that the court actions I've read about 
by mail order firms, plus the detriment 
to public image, can only hurt Apple. I 
whole-heartedly urge Apple to recon- 
sider their decision. 
Montgomery A. Lee, Captain, USAF 

Roots of the Apple 

I read the letter "A Better Way To Trace 
Roots" in your January issue of Softalk in 
which a reader described his dilemma of 
trying to locate a good computerized ge- 
nealogy system. About 15 months ago a 
friend of mine expressed, very strongly, 
the same desire to me. After contacting 
numerous genealogy societies and re- 
searching available software I too was 
convinced of the need. 

In March of this year I am going to re- 
lease a genealogy package called "The 
Genealogist's Bight Hand". This sys- 
tem, like many others on the market, has 
the ability to generate the standard re- 
ports such as a family tree, pedigree 
chart, and sorted indexes of all the peo- 
ple in the system. This however is where 
the similarity ends. First of all there is no 
real limit to the number of people the sys- 
tem will manage, it will handle literally 
millions. Next you ask how much and 
what information can you collect about 
each person and I will answer this by say- 
ing basically anything and as much as 
you like. The question of how many chil- 
dren and by how many marriages is also 
answered by the word unlimited in both 
cases.

THE APPLE SPELLER fills the void 
that has consistently kept the large 
variety of excellent word processing 
packages for the Apple II Computer 
from approaching the power of a 
dedicated work processor. Finally, 
the first professional quality spelling 
verification program is available for 
the Apple II. The Apple Speller will 
certainly be the standard against 
which all other similar programs are 
compared. 

The Apple Speller interfaces to the 
most popular Apple word processors, 
including Applewriter, Apple Pie, 
Executive Secretary, Letter Perfect, 
Magic Window, and Superscribe II, 
just to name a few. In fact, The Apple 
Speller can analyze the output of any 
editor that writes a standard Apple 
binary or text file to a diskette. In 
addition to this flexibility, the per- 
formance of The Apple Speller will 
astound the microcomputer world. 

The Apple Speller is supplied with 
a 30,000 jfword dictionary on a 
single 5V*" diskette with additional 
space to easily add another 8,000 
words to suit your individual needs. 



The Apple Speller has built-in utilities 
to maintain the dictionary diskette. 
You can readily add words, delete 
words, and create an unlimited num- 
ber of modified and/or new diction- 
aries for specific application. 

The Apple Speller is unbelievably 
fast. The first pass reads your docu- 
ment and collects all the words it 
contains at a rate of 5,000 words 
per minute. Next, the words are 
compared to the dictionary for spell- 
ing errors at the incredible speed of 
50,000 words per minute. Finally, all 
misspelled words are marked as 
such in your document with a rate 
of 1,000 words per minute. This 
translates to proofreading a 10 page 
document in 1 minute if there are no 
spelling mistakes and 2 minutes, 15 
seconds for an unlimited number of 
spelling errors. 

Numerous options are provided 
throughout the program to enable 
you to completely control all activi- 
ties of The Apple Speller. These 
include the ability to ignore both 
control codes and formatting com- 
mands, an alphabetical listing of 



either mispelled words or all the 
words in your document along with 
usage frequencies, multiple options 
for the action taken with each 
misspelled word, and much, much 
more! A verification mode is pro- 
vided to allow you to examine and 
dispense with misspelled words 
while viewing them in the actual 
context in which they appeared in 
your file. 

The Apple Speller requires an 
Apple ll/Apple II + equipped with 48K, 
DOS 3.3, and 1 or 2 disk drives. Two 
disk drives are required to delete or 
add words to the dictionary. 

The Apple Speller is being intro- 
duced at the incredible price of 

$75,001

THE NEW SERIAL/PARAL- 
LEL AIO-II: this new full-function 
serial and parallel interface for the 
Apple II gives you true simulta- 
neous operation. It's totally trans- 
parent to the user; there's no soft- 
ware to write, and no need to 
modify your computer. Advanced 
design techniques overcome the 
need for "phantom" slot assign- 
ments and related software com- 
patibility concerns. 

The AIO-II™ appears to applica- 
tion software as either an Apple 
communications card or parallel 
printer card. You don't have to 
worry about special setup require- 
ments. Hassle-free, user-oriented 
AIO-II design permits easy selec- 
tion of four functions: serial modem, 
serial terminal/printer, parallel Cen- 
tronics printer, and general-purpose 



parallel. On-board firmware provides 
all necessary drivers in a single 
package. Optional cables support 
Centronics-compatible printers and 
others. 

You can remain in the game, too, 
with either our Serial ASIO™ or 
Parallel APIO™ boards-if low 
cost, single function's your style. 
Our ASIO connects your Apple to 
a modem with an optional terminal 
routine, or to a terminal/printer 
without modifying the cable. It

There is one last very important fa- 
cility I want to mention briefly and that is 
the dynamic report generator. This al- 
lows you to very easily and quickly de- 
sign very simple reports such as mailing 
labels for club meetings or Christmas 
cards all the way up to family reports 
showing any amount of detail about a 
person along with their father, mother, 
children, and wife or wives. 

There is much more but I think that 
this should give your readers interested 
in genealogy the general flavor of the 
sytem.

My Kingdom for a Write-Protect Sticker 

Enclosed are copies of two letters I sent 
to On-Line and Muse that I believe may 
be of interest to readers of Softalk as well 
as other software authors. The letters de- 
scribe a problem I encountered when us- 
ing a Muse product with suggested solu- 
tions. These letters are self-explanatory 
so I won't repeat it all here. 

If you would publish two items, I be- 
lieve it would be a useful service to your 
readers : 

1. Publish a warning for users of Cas- 
tle Wolfenstein describing the reset wipe- 
out danger 

2. Publish the five listed suggestions 
in the Muse letter to emphasize some of 
the characteristics required of quality 
commercial software 

Softalk continues to be my favorite 
Apple periodical and I look forward each 
month to its arrival. I am one of its 
charter "subscribers" and will continue 
to subscribe with your recent change in

George Anderson's Letter to Muse 

I received your Castle Wolfenstein for 
Christmas and have thoroughly enjoyed 
it for three weeks, until yesterday. Un- 
fortunately, your software caused the 
wipe out of another of my valuable disks. 

The purpose of this letter is to explain 
how this happened so that you may con- 
sider precautions in your software and in- 
structions to prevent this occurrence. Ac- 
cording to the Apple DOS manual, one 
procedure for booting my Apple Plus is : 
Place disk in drive, reset, PR#6, <CR>. 
After having finished playing Castle 
Wolfenstein — that is, the program halted 
with "you're caught" on the CRT, I pro- 
ceeded to boot another of my disks. Us- 
ing the above procedure, when reset was 
pressed, your software became unex- 
pectedly activated and began overwrit- 
ing (and wiping out) my program disk in 
a "save game" mode. Your instructions 
require escape to save a game, not re- 
set! Your instructions warn not to press 
reset while the disk drive is active. The 
drive was not active when I pressed re- 
set. 

My suggestions to you and your in- 
dustry to prevent such unhappy situa- 



program. 

5. Your software should always veri- 
fy the presence of the correct disk in the 
drive by first reading a "key record" be- 
fore writing. 

Having these types of features in your 
products is the difference between qual- 
ity commercial software and merely a 
hobby program. Although I am very un- 
happy about the loss you have caused 
me, I understand that your industry is 
still embryonic and you may not have the 
total resources needed to develop prod- 
uct quality assurance. However, I be- 
lieve that the future belongs to those com- 
panies that mature most rapidly in qual- 



tions are: 

1. Be specific in your instructions 
about required inputs and error-trap all 
illegal inputs. 

2. Place caution notes in both the 
CRT prompts and in your written in- 
structions if number 1 is not accom- 
plished. 

3. Always maintain the operating 
characteristics of the Apple as described 
in the Apple manuals, such as the ex- 
pected response to pressing reset. 

4. Always return the Apple to its resi- 
dent language at the end of a program in- 
stead of leaving it hung. Power cycling a 
computer is not a proper way to exit a

Peter Hohenbrink, Age fifteen, 
Placentia, CA 

Enough of Buccaneers and Barons 
Having long watched the pirate manu- 
facturers controversy swirl in the pages 
of the computer magazines, I have con- 
cluded that both sides spend more time 
rationalizing than reasoning, and what I 
have to say will make little difference ei- 
ther way. From several minutes of dis- 
tracted study I have summarized the ma- 
jor points of both sides. First, for the pi- 
rates: 

1. Software is overpriced, and the 
only reason they steal software is the 
price. 

2. Software has to be backed up, and 
only by learning pirating techniques can 
it be done. 

3. Software manufacturers often 
make misleading claims about their 
product, and rather than paying a lot of 
money for software that turns out to be 
less than advertised, it is better to pirate 
it first. 

4. Software that is no longer avail- 
able cannot be had any other way. 

5. Numerous other excuses that can 
probably be gleaned from combining 1 
through 4 above or The Devil Made Me 
Do It. 

And now for the manufacturers' side. 

1. If their product is pirated, they'll 
go out of business. 

2. They spend a lot of money devel- 
oping software, and their prices reflect 
not only development but also materials, 
royalties, advertising, shipping, dis- 
tributor/dealer mark-up, and so on. 

3. They support updates on their soft- 
ware ; so that the consumer who buys the 
original can have it updated inexpen- 
sively if there are flaws in it or if im- 
provements are made. 

4. It's unAmerican to steal and hurts 
their business. 

Such homilies as "There's truth to 
both sides" are banal, and, in my opin- 
ion, both sides are probably hypocritical. 
First, I don't care what software costs, if 
people can get it free, they'll probably 
take it. Since I have not met one single 
person — including software manufac- 
turers, dealers, distributors, and soft- 
ware authors — who does not have pi- 
rated software, I seriously doubt that 
anyone can cast stones. Secondly, manu- 
facturers do have various costs, but any 
businessman worth his salt doesn't fig- 
ure the minimum amount he can get for 
a product and sell it at that. He figures 
the maximum, and if he doesn't go too 
high, he'll get rich. Look at VisiCalc, for 
example— they got their development 
costs back a long time ago and they're 
making a bundle selling both old and new 
versions. However, as for manufac- 
turers supporting their software, with 



Anderson's letter to On-Line repeats 
much of the Muse letter; its purpose was 
to obtain a replacement for the wiped-out 
disk, which was Threshold. 

Basic Solution a Month Later 

Per your request in the December issue 
of Softalk, I am taking the time to write 
and tell you that I really enjoyed your col- 
umn. In fact, I enjoyed it to such an ex- 
tent that I typed in the short program 
submitted by Brad Stone for a "Hello" 
program. Anything to make life easier 
and more tricky, right? Well, in this case, 
tricky it was, as I was not able to detect 
any typos with my inexperienced eye, 
something I was specifically looking for 
as my abilities as a programmer are 
limited. And we have all seen the correc- 
tions to programs that have been listed in 
magazines run in the next month's issue, 
right? 

Well, right at the end of the listing, on 
line 320, there is a lower-case b. Then 
right on line 1000 there is a symbol that I 
cannot find on my Apple keyboard. So I 
saved the program to disk until such time 
as I can fix it or read in your column next 
month how to do it. It is not all that bad, 
however, for in the process of trying to fix 
the program I learned some more about 
Basic and a couple of other items of in- 
terest about the Apple, so I consider the 
time well spent anyway. But just in case I 
can't fix it, you will print the corrections, 
right? 

I have, as you have undoubtedly gath- 
ered, an Apple, with two drives, a moni- 
tor, and a C.ITOH M-85 printer. I am sta- 
tioned in Tokyo, Japan, with the U.S. gov- 
ernment and was able to get the monitor 
and printer at really nice prices as they 
are manufactured here. The M-85 is the 
counterpart of the Epson MX-80. There is 
quite a lot of activity in the area, with 
both Japanese and Americans getting to- 
gether for talk and demonstrations, real- 
ly an exciting atmosphere. Some of the 
Japanese are really talented at hard- 
ware fabrication and machine language, 
a real joy for a neophyte like me to be 
around. 

By the way, Softalk, Softside, Nibble, 
and C.A.L.L. Apple seem to be the most 
popular English language magazines 
here, but the Japanese have a whole slew 
of publications with quite technical arti- 
cles. 

Well, this was just a short note to say 
"Keep up the good work," but as usual 
this is so much fun that I got carried 
away. 

Oh, the types of programs that I like 
are the ones that make life easier, like 
the one in the December issue. 

Again, enjoyed your column and hope 
to see more programs like the above. But 
I think I will wait until the corrections 
come out next time, at least until I find 



And a Little Babe Shall Lead Them 

I challenge you to publish the attached 
letter. 

[The letter:] 

In glancing through the "letters to the 
editor" in your January 1982 issue, I no- 
ticed the usual assortment of complaints 
about "uncopiable" software; one per- 
son found his purchase (a diet program) 
so protected that it didn't even do the 
tasks that it was advertised to be able to 
do; another person bought a game that 
was subsequently discontinued by the 
company that made it. 

Then there were — and are — the 
countless others who didn't write to you 
to tell you that a "protected program" 
they bought couldn't be modified to suit 
the buyer's needs, couldn't be saved on 
eight-inch disks or other recording media 
that suit the buyer, couldn't be backed-up 
with a copy, etc., etc. 

I was amused to see that, predict- 
ably, you sided with your advertisers in 
seeing nothing wrong with such prac- 
tices; yet you condemned any sugges- 
tion that buyers of such software can do 
as they please with their purchase, be it 
removing the "protection" scheme, 
modifying the program, etc. 

How hypocritical! 

Consider the following arguments: 

1. It takes no more effort to write a 
good program than it takes to write a 
good book. Yet you won't see books sell- 
ing for up to $500 a copy. What a nerve it 
takes to sell a program for $100 to $500 
when one can buy books by mankind's 
best minds — Einstein, Russell, Freud, 
and others — for a few dollars. 

2. When I buy a program, I buy the in- 
structions that constitute that program ; I 
do not buy the box that the program 
came in. I feel perfectly entitled to do as I 
please with my purchase except to make 
a profit from its author's work. I can 
break the code, modify it, give it to 
friends, eat it, burn it. Being prevented 
from so doing is simply unacceptable. 

3. How many kids do you know who 
can afford to buy many programs at $30 
to $500 a copy? These kids are tomor- 
row's technocrats. If I give them a copy, 
the software manufacturer is not losing a 
sale he wouldn't have made in the first 
place (because of the outrageously high 
prices he charges). 

4. The only reason why people don't 
bother to make tapes of music albums 
they buy and pass them to friends is be- 
cause the cost of the blank tape is only 
slightly below the cost of the original al- 
bum. Until software makers understand 
this simple truth, "bootlegged" software 
will outnumber original purchases by 
well over twenty to one. 

I suppose that you have to placate 
your advertisers by not condoning soft- 
ware trading. But you don't have to be

"low cost" updates — that's a joke. For 
example, one piece of software I bought 
with promises of updates for $7 charged 
$20 when the updates finally were made. 
However, one of the updates was on the 
original — only you couldn't get to it un- 
less you had a "broken" copy. (That's 
how I found it was there.) 

If manufacturers came out with high 
quality, low cost, and well supported soft- 
ware, I doubt it would make a bit of dif- 
ference. Pirating would go on regardless. 
The fact that there is a lot of junk and un- 
fulfilled promises does shore up the ex- 
cuses of the pirates, but, let's face it, as 
long as there are ways to copy software, 
everyone is going to end up with some hot 
programs. About the only bright spot in 
this (for the manufacturers) is that I 
have only come across one person dumb 
enough to try to sell pirated material. He 
didn't get very far since no one was will- 
ing to pay him for what they could get 
free. 

So what's the point of this letter? Well, 
I'm tired of hearing bull from both 
sides — mainly in the form of lame ex- 
cuses. The pirates are trying to get some- 
thing for nothing, and the manufacturers 
are trying to get rich. Maybe they de- 
serve each other, who knows? But, 
please . . . let's not hear any more of the 
false morality that has pervaded the 
whole issue.

Opening Apple's Mail — by Request 

The Northwestern University Apple 
Users' Group has today sent the en- 
closed letter to Apple Computer, asking 
that the ban on mail-order sales of Ap- 
ples be lifted. We hope you will publish 
our letter. 

Colin C. Graham, Evanston, H. 

The letter: 

Dear Mr. Markkula: 

I write in my capacity as chair and 
founder of the Northwestern University 
Apple Users' Group. This users' group 
consists of about one hundred people rep- 
resenting somewhat more than one hun- 
dred Apples. We are generally delighted 
with Apple products. But we, as a group 
and individually, deplore Apple Comput- 
er's recent implementation of a policy 
banning mail-order sales. We urge you to 
change that policy for the following rea- 
sons: 

1. For some Apple buyers, mail-or- 
der is quite appropriate; they are lo- 
cated so far from the nearest dealer that 
meaningful dealer support is impossi- 
ble ; they are so knowledgeable that deal- 
er support is not necessary. 

2. The existence of the mail-order op- 
tion obliges local dealers to provide high 
quality service, since otherwise people 
will learn that the higher cost that they 
pay for a locally purchased machine 
brings no commensurate benefit. The ex- 
istence of that option also provides a 



competitive stimulus to local dealers to 
keep their businesses efficient. The mail- 
order sales ban is likely to lead to a de- 
grading of local dealer support. 

3. Apple's banning of mail-order sales 
is in restraint of trade. I leave the legal 
aspects of that to lawyers. The ethical as- 
pect is plain and does not enhance the 
reputation of Apple Computer as a com- 
pany that wishes to provide the best pos- 
sible computers at the lowest possible 
price commensurate with appropriate 
levels of customer support. 

4. To the extent that the ban on mail- 
order sales artificially raises the price of 
Apple hardware, other suppliers will be 
encouraged to produce competing, 
equivalent equipment. That has already 
begun with RAM cards and 5Vi-inch disk 
drives. I personally have mixed feelings 
about such developments; you should 
not. 

We urge Apple Computer to rescind 
its mail-order sales ban. Thank you for 
your interest. 

Yours sincerely, 

Colin Graham 

Professor of Mathematics 

Chair, N.U. Apple Users' Group 

The Best Argument 

I want to echo the objections of Michael 
Daugherty, John Zimmer, and other Sof- 
talk readers to pornographic advertising 
in Softalk. But I object for different, and I 
think more important, reasons. 

The problem is not erotica in media, 
or toplessness, or even whether the kids 
will see a picture of a breast. The prob- 
lem is not obscenity. Rather, the prob- 
lem Softalk needs to address is sexism. 

Ads that present women as sexual ob- 
jects are sexist, and I object to them on 
that basis alone. They include On-Line's 
Softporn ad, to be sure, and Don Fudge's 
HirRes Secrets ad, and others. But I would 
add to the list Howard Software Ser- 
vices' ad for Creative Financing, which, 
despite the claim that it is "for the se- 
rious personal computer user," features 
a woman in a most unbusinesslike ki- 
mono letting her hair down, under the 
double-meaning headline, "Worth Wait- 
ing For." 

Women are not merely fixtures for 
the sexual enjoyment of men. They are 
people. Depicting them as sexual objects 
denies their personhood. Sexist ads help 
create and reinforce sexist attitudes. And 
Softalk cannot pretend neutrality: either 
you are for sexism — by your action of 
aiding and abetting it — or you are against 
it. 

If making decisions about what is sex- 
ist and what is not sexist seems inappro- 
priate to an advertising staff, consider 
this: would you run an ad depicting a 
black person in overalls eating a water- 
melon? Would you run an ad that con- 
tained the words "nigger," "gook," or 
"spic"? Of course not. You know better 
than to print a racist ad. You should know 



better than to run a sexist ad. 

This is, after all, 1982. 
Don Doumakes, Iowa City, IA 

Dislocated Memory? 

I have several questions that I hope you 

or some reader might be able to answer. 

First, why did Apple choose to put the 
hi-res graphics memory where they did? 
Several times I have written programs in 
Applesoft, only to find that the program 
is too long to use page 1 of high graphics, 
and, due to a large number of string vari- 
ables, I can't use page 2. I'm sure there is 
a way around this problem, but how can 
someone who is not a computer expert 
and does not want to spend money for ex- 
tras get around it? 

Second, in the March/ April 1980 Ap- 
ple Orchard, the internal entry point for 
xdraw was given to be $F65D. In the 
latest Softalk, it was given to be $F76F. 
There were several other differences 
also. First, which is right, and, second, 
why doesn't someone give concrete ex- 
amples as to how to use these entry 
points? I have tried dozens of variations 
and have yet to get any results that are 
predictable. Won't someone please treat 
us as the dummies we are and give some 
extremely basic yet informative exam- 
ples to go by? 

Third, as chips with larger amounts of 
memory (such as 64K chips) are devel- 
oped, does Apple have any plans to allow 
for finer graphics as some of the Japa- 
nese are doing? 

Finally, as more and more software is 
developed for the Apple, would it not be 
possible for Softalk to have a continuing 
evaluation of programs by readers to be 
published monthly rather than just the 
yearly voting? As you pointed out, your 
top thirty indicates what is being pur- 
chased, but it doesn't give feedback as to 
how good the program is. 
Richard Arnold, Hogansville, GA 

Earth, Wind, and Fire 

I found the review of Volcanoes very in- 
teresting, perhaps especially so because 
it may indicate something of what we can 
expect from Info World, etc. There are a 
few points that are not clearly stated, or 
may even be somewhat misleading to 
someone who has never played the game. 
From the top (as I used to say when I was 
directing plays) : (1) volcanoes are not 
"true" (or "false") — they are real or 
imaginary. (2) The initial budgets for 
players are in part a function of how 
many are playing the game; evidently, 
your reviewer had in mind only the two- 
player format when citing a budget of 
about $350,000. If players have smaller 
areas of responsibility, they have small- 
er budgets with which to do investiga- 
tions. (3) If seismic surveys are done 
with one or two seismometers installed on 
the slopes of the imaginary volcanoes, 
their costs are not significantly different 
from those of gas analyses. (4) Players

New Microbuf fer II lets you use your printer 
without tying up your computer. 



Time. As an important resource 
it shouldn't be wasted. One 
such waste is in printing, where 
your computer must wait for 
your printer. Now there's a way 
to eliminate this waste. 

Introducing the 
Microbuffer ][™, a buffered 
parallel printer interface for the 
Apple ][® computer with 16K 
characters of memory (user ex- 
pandable to 32K). It accepts 
data as fast as your computer 
can send it, allowing you to use 
your computer while the 
Microbuffer ][ is in control of 
your printing. 

The Microbuffer ][, compatible 



with Applesoft, CP/M'" 1 and 
Pascal, comes with complete 
print formatting features as well 
as advanced graphics dump 
routines for most popular 
graphics printers. 

The Snapshot™ option per- 
mits you to dump the text 
screen or graphics picture to 
the printer while any program is 

/MICROBUFFER ][ 

MM 



running — without interuption. 

The 16K Microbuffer]! is 
available for $259. And the 32K 
version, for $299. The Snapshot 
option is $69. 

So why waste time while your 
computer waits for your printer? 
Ask your computer dealer for 
the Microbuffer ][ or call us for 
the name of a dealer near you:

may not only exit a game, they may also 
re-enter any saved game. Perhaps that is 
implicit. 

Finally, (5) we were amazed that no 
mention was made of the quality of the 
graphics. Perhaps your reviewer has 
only a limited "visual sense," and did not 
notice the exceptionally vivid depictions 
of volcanic eruptions, in several distinct 
artistic styles. (I can effuse about these 
images because, except for very minor 
contributions, I did not draw them. If, in 
analogy to books, I am the author of Vol- 
canoes, then my wife is the illustrator.) 

I expect that you have not had a 
chance to see these eruption images 
yourself. If you look at the March-April 
issue of Educational Computer, you will 
see a half-page ad in color, part of which 
depicts one of these images, shot direct- 
ly from the video monitor.

Apple-Controlled Video Recorder? 

I recently saw an Atari 800 being used 
with a piece of educational software. Its 
unique feature was that it could, through 
program control, start and stop its tape 
recorder. This feature has great poten- 
tial for educational programs. 

Is this possible with the Apple through 
hardware additions or modifications? 

Is there a way to control VCR equip- 
ment in the same manner? 

Softalk's a great magazine made even 
better by the addition of a column on 
hardware. Long overdue! 
Steven C. Helms, Bettendorf, IA 

Graft or Good Sense? 
I read Mr. Mazur's article on coproces- 
sor cards in the November issue with 
some interest since Southern Semicon- 
ductor also has a 6809-E card for the Ap- 
ple II which we have been shipping since 
mid-summer of 1981. Unlike the Mill, 
ours was introduced with little fanfare 
but with system software to make it im- 
mediately usable. An editor, assembler, 
and utility routines were included with 
the card. These programs are all written 
in 6809 assembler and will run with ei- 
ther Integer or Applesoft (or no) Basic. 
We are now also supplying a stand alone 
debugger which will interface directly 
with DOS and provide breakpoint and 
hardware trace capability. 

I have tried on several occasions to 
contact Mr. Al Tommervik about a pos- 
sible review of our product but he hasn't 
seen fit to return my calls. Seeing the ad 
for the Mill included with the article may 
explain that. Does Softalk do reviews of 
products before the manufacturer starts 
advertising in Softalk? If so who is the 
proper person to contact? 
David Ramsey, Norcross, GA 

A bit of thoughtful paging through Sof- 
talk would have precluded your question 
and suspicions about reviews and adver- 
tising. You would have found numerous 



products reviewed and featured in other 
articles that have never been advertised 
in this magazine. There is one secondary 
connection, however; companies that ad- 
vertise in Softalk are usually careful to 
send us samples of new products so that 
we can review them. 

You saw the Mill ad where it was be- 
cause that was the most appropriate place 
in the magazine for it. You will generally 
see business products advertised near 
the business columns and assemblers 
near Assembly Lines. We attempt to 
place all ads where they are most apt to 
be read by readers who'll be interested 
in them. Your product would be treated 
in exactly the same way whenever possi- 
ble. 

Down in the Dumps Again 

Mark Lavetter's improved version of Art 
Christopher's Screen Dump Program 
(January 1982, page 18) was a great help. 
I commend him for making the program 
faster and significantly shorter. When I 
tried to use the program in Diarmuid Mc- 
Carthy's Applesoft tutorial, though, I dis- 
covered that my Epson printer would not 
print inverse or flashing characters cor- 
rectly. After studying page 15 of the Ap- 
ple II Reference Manual, I added two 
statements that convert all characters to 
normal before printing. Of course the 
program is a little longer and slower, but 
it can now handle inverse and flashing 
characters with no trouble. Unfortunate- 
ly, the program can no longer fit on one 
line. It could fit on two lines, but I chose 
to use three lines for readability.

If you are absolutely positive that the

take advantage of the extra speed of

ments of the Screen Dump Program ap-

Pascal and the Epson 

The following may be helpful re the prob- 
lem described by Jim Burke on pages 22 
and 23 of the January 1982 Softalk. 

There is a problem in interfacing re- 
cent Apple II Pluses and Epsons for Pas- 
cal programs and for programs that are 
Pascal-driven (whatever that may mean) , 
like Personal Filing System. Some cards 
will just not work, and that includes the 
Epson Apple Card and the Mountain 
Computer multifunction card. 

I resolved the problem by replacing 
my Epson Apple Card with the Grap- 
pler, which works fine. The Apple Cen- 
tronics and parallel cards may well 
work, as might the increasing number of 
parallel cards that advertise themselves 
as Pascal compatible. 

But it is a good idea to take one's pro- 
grams to a dealer that has an Apple 
hooked up to an Epson to see if the con- 
nection really works. Dealers tend thus 
far to say that they are unaware of the 
problem, but there are people at both Ap- 
ple and Epson who are aware of it, and it 
is real. 

John M. Allswang, Los Angeles, CA 

In response to the request of Jim Burke

TASC The Applesoft Compiler. 
It turns your Apple into 
a power tool. 



Step up to speed. TASC, the Applesoft Compiler, 
converts a standard Applesoft BASIC program 
into super-fast machine code. By 
increasing program execution speed 
up to 20 times, Microsoft gives 
you a power tool for Applesoft 
BASIC programming. 
Highest capacity available. 
TASC will compile and run 
larger programs than any 
other Applesoft Compiler. As a 
disk-based system, it doesn't 
require the simultaneous pres- 
ence of compiler and program 
in memory. The memory you save 
allows you to compile significantly 
bigger programs. 

Power without bulk. Code expansion of up to 100% 
severely restricts other compilers. TASC's special 
code compression schemes typically limit code 
expansion to only 25%. You'll really appreciate that 
with complex programs or programs that utilize 
Apple's hi-res graphic pages. 
More BASIC power. TASC's powerful new 
commands increase Applesoft BASIC programming 
capability. Chain with COMMON allows compiled 
programs to share variables, so a main menu 

'Applesoft is a trademark of Apple Computer, Inc. 




supports several programs in a 



single runtime environment. 
TASC's True Integer Arithmetic 
and Integer FOR... NEXT 
capabilities maximize the execu- 
tion speed of compiled programs. 
TASC's near total compatibility 

with Applesoft speeds compil- 
ation of existing programs 
with little or no modification. 
What about mistakes? You 
perfect your programs inter- 
actively with Applesoft. If some- 
thing does slip by, TASC recovers 
from errors discovered in compilation 
and traps all runtime errors. It even permits 
graceful interruptions during compilation.

V ENTUR ES W 

BY (KAK sTinson 



Our VisiCalc application this month will address itself to 
the care and feeding of your local — and national — taxman. Or, 
rather, to the reduction of hassle attendant thereto. 

We could conceivably apply VisiCalc to the task of comput- 
ing federal income taxes, but it would be tough to come up with 
a single model that could accommodate the wide variety of in- 
dividual needs. Instead, we'll tackle the taxman in his recur- 
rent — should we say chronic — manifestation; we'll build a 
model to calculate withholding taxes and other payroll de- 
ductions. 

This model is in some ways the opposite of what we did last 
month. Then, you may recall, we used VisiCalc to create a ta- 
ble of numbers representing the future value of an investment 
at various points in time, given various assumptions. This time 
we're going to use VisiCalc' a ©LOOKUP function to extract in- 
formation from a previously input table of values and re- 
lationships. 

The lookup function is ideal for a lot of situations where you 
want VisiCalc to select some number from a table and use it in 
a calculation. Which number the program selects will depend 
on some other criterion, which is input by the user. 

Figure 1 illustrates a tiny lookup table, representing a fre- 
quency discount scheme for a certain size of magazine ad. BIO 
holds the price for a single insertion ; Bll is the price per inser- 
tion for a three-month contract, and B12 is the price per month 
for six or more months. To extract a value from this table, 
you'll need two VisiCalc cells. The first will hold the search cri- 
terion, the second the result. 

For example, if you put the value 3 at A13, then the formula 
©LOOKUP (A13.A10 . . . A12) will return the value 540. The 
function gets or calculates the search criterion at A13, finds it 
in the table range A10 . . . A12, and returns the value to the 
right of the appropriate position in the lookup table. If the ta- 
ble is arranged in rows, the function finds the search criterion 
in the upper row and returns a value from the lower. 

If the table does not include the search criterion, the func- 
tion returns the value opposite the next lower entry in the 
source range. In other words, putting a 4 at A13 would still 
cause the formula ©LOOKUP (A13.A10 . . . A12) to return the 
value 540. 

Tax computations, however, are based on many different 
variables, and there are few linear relationships with which 
the behavior of one variable may be tied to another. So our 
payroll deduction calculator is going to have lots of lookup ta- 
bles, and we'll need to find some way to choose a single end 
result from a multiplicity of plausible ones.

of one variable may be tied to another. So our payroll deduc- 
tion calculator is going to have lots of lookup tables, and we'll 
need to come up with some way to choose a single end result 
from a multiplicity of plausible ones. 

Our worksheet, like many a good program, will have an 
area for input, an area where some processing will take place, 
and an area for output. We'll need to pay some attention to the 
spatial arrangement, so that these three functions — input, proc- 
essing, and output — occur in the proper time sequence. In 
general, the output should appear to the right of anything else 
on the screen if your sheet is set to calculate in columns, and 
below everything else if you're calculating by rows. If you're 
going by columns — VisiCalc 's default arrangement — your 
lookup tables ought to be columnar as well. 

It's nice to have input and output areas visible at the same 
time, so that you don't have to go traipsing all over the sheet 
whenever you want to see the results of a change in input pa- 
rameters. Since we're going to need a large area for process- 
ing, the way we'll bring input and output both into view is with 
a vertical window. The final result of our labors will look like 
figure 2 ; notice that all the processing areas are neatly tucked 
away off screen. 

This sheet is set up to calculate withholding for federal in- 
come tax, social security, California state income tax, and 
California state disability tax. The first two items on that list 
will be relevant to most people reading this article. For state 
and any other taxes you'll need to put in whatever information 
pertains to your locality. The methods used on this worksheet 
should be applicable most places in this country. 

On the left side of the sheet you'll find the four independent 
variables: marital status, number of dependents claimed, pay 
period, and gross pay per period. The third item under mari- 
tal status, unmarried head of household, is a special category 
meaningful to the California state income tax collector. 

Under pay period we've included only three categories. 
Others are obviously possible ; the federal tax tables acknowl- 
edge eight: weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, monthly, quar- 
terly, semiannual, annual, and daily or miscellaneous. The 
problem with allowing for all of these options on your work- 
sheet is that you'll run out of memory. Besides, it's almost cer- 
tainly a lot of unnecessary work. Use whatever data applies to 
your situation; we've included three periods for illustrative 
purposes. 

The sheet as we have it here, by the way, uses 17K of memo- 
ry. On a 48K Apple using VisiCalc 3.3, that leaves IK for any 
additions. In a typical company application, however, where 
everyone's pay period is the same, you could eliminate one in- 
dependent variable and save quite a bit of memory. That 
would allow for the inclusion of other kinds of deductions, like 
voluntary contributions or automatic savings deposits. 

On a clear worksheet, run your cursor over to Jl, then move 
it back one column so it sits on II and Jl still shows on the 
screen. Now type /WV to establish the vertical window. 

There are some things to note as you do this. VisiCalc pre- 
serves the default column width of nine on the left side of the 
sheet but narrows the columns on the right to eight. When you 
type in the window command with one column to the right of

the cursor, the program assumes that you want to see two col- 
umns displayed in the right window at all times, and it just 
makes whatever adjustments it needs on the right side to fit 
the new set of row numbers on the screen. The program al- 
ways tries to use all forty columns on the Apple display. Each 
set of row numbers takes up three columns, and the rest of the 
available space gets distributed as equitably as possible, with 
the specifications requested (or accepted by default) for the 
left window taking precedence over those requested for the 
right. 

The column widths can be modified, of course, and in a 



vertical-window model you can specify one width for one side 
and a different one for the other; that's the only situation 
where VisiCalc, in its present revision, permits differing col- 
umn widths. 

Now that you have your windows set up, you can type in the 
material shown in figure 2. The semicolon key will take you 
back and forth from one window to the other. 

On the input side, you'll probably want to put in a /F$ at B17 
for the sake of neatness. Likewise, on the output or results side, 
cells J2, J5, J8, Jll, J14, and J17 should be given the dollar for- 
mat. As for the formulas for those locations, J2 is clearly +B17, 
and J17 — the bottom line on this chart — can be entered as + J2- 
J5-J8-J11-J14. 

The formula at J8 can be entered as simply + J2*.07. Social 
security is the simplest tax to calculate because it's a straight 
percentage — currently 7 percent — of gross wages. The only 
time you'll need to change this formula is when the govern- 
ment increases the rate. 

The California State Disability payment is, likewise, a sim- 
ple percentage taken off the top. That tithe now stands at 0.6 
percent. There is one complicating factor here, however. The 
state only takes a maximum of $136 dollars a year, regardless 
of how much you make. To cover the possibility that an em- 
ployee had already met his state disability obligation for the 
year, we can use one of VisiCalc 3.3's conditional functions. 

Start by entering the label PERIOD #> at A20. At B20 you'll 
need to add another independent variable representing the 
number of the current pay period. If your paycheck is semi- 
monthly, this will be the number of the month times two, plus 
one if you're in the middle of the month — and so on. 

At CI, enter the formula +B17*B20*.008. This will return the 
amount of money paid to the state disability fund Up to and in- 
cluding the current pay period, assuming that the gross pay for 
the current period is an amount close to the average pay per 
period recorded by this employee this year. 

At C2 enter @IF(C1>136,0,.008). The @IF function has 
three fields. The first is an expression yielding a Boolean re- 
sult — true or false. If the result of that expression is true, the 
@IF function returns the value of the second field — whether 
that value be a constant or a formula. If the result of the first 
field is false, the function returns the value contained in the 
third field. 

In this case, the program checks to see if the amount con- 
tributed to the state disability fund exceeds the maximum re- 
quired. If it does, then C2 will hold the value 0 ; if not, it will hold 
.008. The final step, of course, is to enter the formula + J2*C2 at 
location J14. 

Now we've got two of our four deductions figured. The last 
two— the federal and state income taxes— are going to take a 
little more work. 

The first step in calculating the amount to be withheld from 
an employee's pay for the federal income tax is to deduct a cer- 
tain amount from the gross pay; this amount, which is depen- 
dent on both the number of deductions claimed by the em- 
ployee and on the pay period, is exempt from taxation. 

To figure the exemption, we'll put a small lookup table at 
A22 to A24 and B22 to B24. The three values in column A will 
represent the three pay-period options that our sheet will al- 
low. The corresponding figures in column B represent the 
exemption, per claimed deduction, for each of these pay peri- 
ods. The table should look like this: 

A B 

22 1 19.23 

23 2 38.46 

24 3 41.66 

So, for example, if an employee claims three deductions 
and is paid weekly, the amount of his paycheck that's exempt 
from withholding is found by multiplying $19.23 by three. 

In order to calculate the amount of money subject 
to withholding, enter the following formula at B30: 
+B17-(B8*@LOOKUP(B14,A22...A24)). B17 holds the gross 
pay and B8 the number of deductions claimed. The lookup

function selects an exemption allowance dependent on loca-

You can dress this table up a bit by adding the values 0 and 
4 at A21 and A25, respectively, and ©ERROR in both the cor- 
responding positions of column B. Then edit the formula at B30 
to make the lookup table extend from A21 to A25. This will 
catch any out-of-bounds data entered at B14. If someone en- 
ters a pay-period code of 5, for example, the value ERROR will 
show up at B30 and, when we're done, at J5 and J16 in the out-

The data for this lookup table, as well as all the other data 
pertaining to federal income and social security taxes, comes 
from the IRS's Circular E (Publication 15) . To determine the 
amount of tax to take out of our employee's paycheck, we need 
to consult the tables on pages 16 and 17 of Circular E. One of 
those tables, the one that covers withholding from weekly pay, 
is reproduced in figure 3.

bracket cutoff point. For example, if our employee is single, 
claims one deduction, and grosses $300 a week, we calculate 
his tax as follows: first we observe, by means of the lookup ta- 
ble we established earlier, that his taxable pay with one de- 
duction is actually $280.77. Then we locate him on the fifth tier 
of the IRS's table and see that his tax will be $51.31 plus 30 per- 
cent of the difference between $280.77 and $273. 

We can get VisiCalc to do the figuring for us by entering the 
four columns of numbers shown in figure 4. You'll find it con- 
venient to kill the window setup — by typing /Wl — before en- 
tering the data. You can always reinstate the window later on. 

The four columns of numbers represent, respectively, the 
following information: the cutoff points that determine the em- 
ployee's tax bracket, the base tax for that bracket, the per- 
centage that must be taken of the amount in excess of the 
bracket cutoff point, and the cutoff point again. The first and 
fourth columns may initially appear to be redundant, but there 
are a couple of reasons why they both need to be there. 

First of all, these four columns will be used as three over- 
lapping lookup tables. That is, we're first going to look at col- 
umn A, the bracket boundaries, and pick out the appropriate 
base tax in column B. Then we'll use that base tax value as a 
search criterion for a lookup table made up of columns B and 
C. The result of that operation will give us the proper percent 
figure to be applied to the amount in excess of the bracket cut- 
off. But the appropriate cutoff figure itself has to be pulled out 
of a lookup table based upon the various percentages. Since the 
two columns of a lookup table have to be adjacent to each 
other, we need to repeat column A as column D. 

There's an important difference between column A and col- 
umn D, however. We've added a penny to the values in A, to 
cover the possibility of an employee landing exactly on the cut- 
off line. The IRS table says that an employee so situated on the 
cuff between two brackets is entitled to remain in the lower of 
the two. Putting that extra penny onto the figures in column A 
allows for the eventuality. 

One more note about this set of lookup tables. The values at 
B33 and B34 are both shown as zeros, but they're not identical.

PUT ONE OVER 
ON APPLE II. 





What happens when you put one over on Apple II? You 
make it better. Because Station II organizes, simplifies, 
protects, secures and lets you control access to your 
Apple. In other words, it makes your Apple II y our | 
personal computer. 

IT'S DESIGNED FOR H-GETHERNESS. 

Station II is designed specifically for Apple II by 
design consultants to Apple Com- 
puter. It pulls your Apple and peri- 
pherals together into an attractive, easy- 
to-use, integrated system. 

Your Apple is free to slide in and out, so 
there's no unstacking and restacking peri- 
pherals everytime you need to get inside 
And you can choose the distance from 
keyboard to monitor that's most com- 
fortable for you. Station II even posi- 
tions your monitor at just the right 
angle for maximum viewing 
ease. 

IT CLEARS YOUR DESK OF 
CORDS AND CABLES. 

Station II is equipped 
with three built-in power 
outlets, so the cords and 
cables that normally clutter 
your work area are tucked away neatly 
inside. Now one cord, Station Us own, 
powers your entire system. 

Apple and Apple H are registered trademarks of Apple Computer. 






THE KEY IS SECURITY 

AND CONVENIENCE. 
You're not the only one who's 
discovered the value of 
Apple II, so Station II has a key. 
And a lock. And two ways to 
secure it. Now you can slide your j 
Apple inside, lock it and leave it. 
Safe and sound. It puts the clamps on 
theft, and beyond mat, you control 
who gets inside your Apple and who 
doesn't. 

Your programs are safe, too. Because 
Station II has a line voltage surge sup- 

Eressor, ready to intercept power surges 
efore they can wipe out your program. 
What's more, the key means conven- 
I ience. With one twist 
of the wrist you can 
power up your entire 
system. Plus, you can lock 
your Apple "on" or "off." 
IT MAKES YOUR APPLE 
MORE FRUITFUL 
That's what happens when you put 
one over on Apple II. So look for 
Station II at your computer dealer.

All the values on the left side of a columnar lookup table have 
to be unique and arranged in ascending order. So B34 actually 
holds .001 rounded to zero by means of a /FI. When ©LOOKUP 
selects a percentage figure from column C, it will recognize the 
difference between B33 and B34. The base tax value actually 
held in B34 is a mil higher than it ought to be, but since all our 
final calculations will be rounded off by /F$, the error will have 
no effect. 

Having exact zeros at both B33 and B34 could lead to some 
aberrant results. For example, if a single person claiming one 
deduction earned gross pay of $25 per week, his tax ought to be 
a base amount of zero, plus zero percent of the excess over 
nothing. But our lookup operation that selects the percentage 
amount would overlook the first zero in column B and arrive at 
the figure of .15 ; the error would be propagated into the next 
operation, so that 15 percent would be applied to the excess 
over $27 — a negative amount. Our employee might not mind; 
he'd be owed $3.18 by the government. But it would be hard to 
explain that to the authorities. 

Below the overlapping lookup tables shown in figure 4 we 
have three formulas that calculate the base tax, percentage, 
and total tax to be withheld — for the single person drawing a 
weekly paycheck. Those formulas are as follows: 

At B42 we can calculate the base tax with 
@LOOKUP(B30,A33...A40). B30, you may remember, holds 
the amount of wage subject to withholding — calculated from 
the number of deductions claimed and the pay period. 

B43 figures the proper percent multiplier by ©LOOK- 
UP (B42.B33...B40). B42 is the value we just calculated; note 
once again that these calculations have to be performed in the 
proper time sequence. 

The formula by which the tax is computed, at B43, looks 
like this: +B42+ (B43*(B30-@LOOKUP(B43,C33...C40))). B42 
is the base tax, B43 the percent multiplier, B30 the total sub- 
ject to taxation, and the last term — generated by the lookup 
function — is the cutoff point of the tax bracket. 

This result, of course, is valid only for the single person 
drawing a weekly check. The remainder of our chore in set- 
ting up for the federal withholding consists of entering more 
lookup tables for all the bases we wish to cover. Since married 
people get their own tables, separate from and mathematical- 
ly unrelated to single people's, if we want to cover three pay 
periods we'll need a total of six table sets. 

We leave the rest of the data entry to you. Note, however, 
that within a given marital status category — single or mar- 
ried — the percentage figures are the same for all pay periods. 
Only the base tax amounts and the bracket boundaries change. 
So you can replicate the numbers from the tables you've al- 
ready entered to other parts of the worksheet. 

Also, the three formulas at B42 to B44 can be replicated for 
each set of tables. All the cell locations in these formulas 
should be replicated relative, except for B30, which represents 
the total wage subject to taxation. This one has to be repli- 
cated no change. 

After you've finished putting in the data to cover all the op- 
tions you need, you'll have a VisiCalc model that computes a 
number of different tax-due figures for a given amount of tax- 
able income. You still need a way to use the pay period and 
marital status data entered at the top of the model, in B14 and 
B5, respectively, as criteria for determining which tax-due fig- 
ure should be carried over to the righthand window, to the out- 
put section of the worksheet. The simplest way we found to do 
this is to use yet another lookup table. 

In our worksheet the two remaining independent vari- 
ables — marital status and pay period — can be configured a to- 
tal of six different ways. That is, we have data for three pay 
periods— weekly, biweekly, and semimonthly — each of which 
is broken down into a section for married folks and a section 
for nonmarried folks. If we can combine the two variables into 
a single variable with a domain of six possible values, then we 
can use that variable as the search criterion for one last look- 
up table that will carry the appropriate tax figure to the other 
side of the screen.

The way to make that combination is to multiply the mari- 
tal status value, at B5, by 10 and add it to the pay period value, 
at B14. This will produce a two-digit code that can hold six dif- 
ferent values— 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, or 23. So the bottom of our fed- 
eral tax processing area looks like figure 5. 

The code at B116 is derived from the formula 
+B14+ (10*B5) and is used as the selection criterion for the 
lookup table below it. The values in the right side of that table 
are simply pulled from the appropriate cells at higher eleva- 
tions on the worksheet. The error results at 10, 14, and 24 are 
provided to forestall input screwups. 

Last, but by no means least, at J5, in the right-hand 
window, we have the lookup formula that selects the appro- 
priate entry in this ultimate table : @LOOKUP(B116,All7...A125) . 

Actually that's not the end of the problem, since we still 
have the state tax to compute. But the California income tax, 
with its third marital category, low-income exemption tables, 
and tax credits, is horrendously more complicated than the 
federal. So, while VisiCalc is perfectly capable of handling the 
computation, we'll spare you the details. 31

Tools of the Craft, Part 9 

Functions. By now, it should be reasonably clear that pro- 
cedures are somehow analogous to program statements. In 
fact, procedures and statements are interchangeable. Any- 
where you can put a statement, you can put a procedure call, 
and vice versa. 

I hinted last time about the existence of functions. These 
are objects that look very much like procedures but take the 
place of data expressions, rather than statements. As an ex- 
ample, let me reintroduce the Chr function. In calling it, you 
must supply a single parameter: an Integer expression that 
should evaluate to a number in the range 0 through 127, inclu- 
sive. The value that Chr assumes is that of the ASCII charac- 
ter associated with the given number. For instance, Chr (65) is 
the same value as capital A, Chr (97) corresponds to lower-case 
a, and Chr (33) is the exclamation point (!). 

Here is a small program that uses Chr in several places. 
One use is incorrect; can you spot it? (You can always check 
your answer by compiling the program.) 

PROGRAM 
TestChr; 
CONST 

lnt= 34; 
Ch= '"'; 
BEGIN (* TestChr *) 
Write(Ch,' is '); 
IF (Ch <> Chr(lnt)) 
THEN 

Writefnot '); 
Write('equal to Chrf, Intsl, *).'); 
Chr(lnt); 
END (* TestChr *). 



If you try to compile ChrFn, the compilation will fail on line 
11, at the point where Chr is used as a statement. The compiler 
reports "Error 150" ("Assignment to standard function is not 
allowed.") and, soon after, "Error 51" (":= expected."). To 
understand why these particular messages are given, you 
must, once again, put yourself in the role of the compiler. The 
final semicolon in line 10 primes the compiler for the start of a 
new statement. Proceeding to line 11, it finds an identifier 
("Chr"). Only in assignments or procedure calls will an iden- 
tifier ever be the first item in a statement. Since Chr is not a 
procedure, the compiler concludes that the statement in ques- 
tion must be an assignment. However, the compiler knows 
right away that it is not possible for a program to assign any 
value to the built-in function Chr, hence the first error mes- 
sage. 

The second error is indicated because the compiler, once 
having noted that assignment to Chr is illegal, proceeds to 
"look the other way," and treat Chr as if it was a variable, or 
other object to which a value may be assigned. By doing this, 
the compiler makes the best of a bad situation ("recovers from 
the error condition," in the language of computer scientists) . It 
attempts to continue analyzing the program for further er- 
rors, even though the presence of previous errors means that it 
cannot generate the executable P-code version of the pro- 
gram. Continuing, on the assumption that the current state- 



ment should be an assignment, the compiler fails to find the as- 
signment operator (: = ) and so complains of "Error 51." 

If you remove TestChr 's erroneous line, you will have a cor- 
rect program, which you can use to determine whether or not a 
certain character corresponds to a certain integer. As shown, 
TestChr will indeed verify that Chr (34) and the quotation mark 
(") are equivalent data. If Int were 49 and Ch were 'A', how- 
ever, TestChr would deny any relationship between the two. 
(Just to satisfy your curiosity, Chr(49) = 'l', and 'A'=Chr(65).) 
By changing the values of the constants Int and Ch, then re- 
compiling, you can determine the ASCII relationship between 
other pairs of integers and characters. If you would like to look 
at the complete ASCII correspondence, see Table 7 in the Ap- 
ple Pascal Language Reference Manual. 

General Characteristics of Functions. Chr, along with all 
other Pascal functions, behaves as a "magic" expression, in 
that it acquires a different value according to each different in- 
put parameter value but otherwise fills the same niche as a 
more conventional data expression. A function is like a vari- 
able, too; it has a name, represents just one value at a time, 
and must be declared as having a certain data type. Chr is a 
function of type Char; it returns a single character as its value. 
Other functions may be of type Integer, Boolean, or Real. 
User-defined functions may also be given user-enumerated 
types, or subrange types, provided that such types have been 
declared and named in the program prior to the function defi- 
nition. 

Finally, a function is also like a procedure, since it has a 
body (invisible, in the case of built-in functions) , that contains 
the statements used to compute, obtain, or derive the function 
value. This aspect of functions will become clearer below. 

Writing Your Own Functions. As you can see in the syntax 
diagram of figure 1, the structure of a user-defined function is 
much like that of the user-defined procedures you have al- 
ready studied. Of course, the heading is different. For one 
thing, the keyword FUNCTION is used, instead of PROCE- 
DURE. For another, every function must be given a type, just 
as if it were a variable. As you might expect, this is done by fol- 
lowing the function name (and any parameter list) with a 
colon and a type name. The same restriction that applies to pa- 
rameter types also applies to function types — they must be 
named, not specified explicitly. Both FUNCTION and PRO- 
CEDURE headings terminate with a semicolon. 

Below is a program that defines and uses Power, a func- 
tion that returns the value of the integer parameter base, 
raised to the power of the integer parameter exponent. It il- 
lustrates both a proper function heading and the method by 
which functions acquire the values that they return to the call- 
ing program.

Assigning a value to the function name within the function 
body gives the function itself that value. The statement 
"Power := 0" gives the Power function the value zero. The 
statement "Power : = TempVal" gives the Power function the 
value that is in TempVal at the time the statement is exe- 
cuted. (This doesn't establish a relationship between Power 
and TempVal, however. Subsequent statements could alter 
TempVal, but Power's function value will remain frozen until 
such time as another assignment to Power is made.) 

Notice that, if the Exponent parameter is a value less than 
zero, the body of the IF statement will never be executed, and 
the function value of Power, as seen by the caller, will be zero. 
When the Exponent is nonnegative, however, the IF body is ex- 
ecuted, and the original function value of zero is superseded by 
the final value contained in TempVal. The value that the func- 
tion has at the time its body ceases execution is the function 
value that the caller "sees," regardless of how many times the 
function value may change during the execution of the func- 
tion body. Also, if NO value is assigned to the function name 
during function execution, the function value that is returned to 
the caller should be considered as undefined garbage. (The 
moral is : Please be careful ! Incredibly bizarre program bugs 
are often traced to poorly written user-defined functions that, 
under some circumstances, return such garbage values.) 

Because we can assign a value to a function name as if it 
were a variable, you might be wondering whether or not we 
can, within the body of a function, use the function name in ex- 
pressions as if it were a variable. To be specific, you might be 
curious as to why we bother to use the local variable TempVal 
to accumulate intermediate values for Power. Perhaps, you 
believe, we could have saved time and space by using Power's 
function value itself as the accumulator, like so: 

FUNCTION 

Power (Base, Exponent 
integer) 
integer; 

(* Power (Base, Exponent) = Base raised to the Exponent power. *) 
(* NOT LEGAL PASCAL, DUE TO IMPROPER USE OF IDENTIFIER "POWER" *) 
VAR 
I 

integer; 



BEGIN (* Power *) 

(* If Power returns with this value, exponent is out of range. *) 
Power := 0; 
IF (Exponent >= 0) 
THEN 

BEGIN (* Exponent in range *) 
Power := 1; 

FOR I := 1 TO Exponent DO 
Power := Power * Base; 

(* 

WRONG!! You can't use the identifier "Power" in an expression 
within the function body of Power! *) 
END (* Exponent in range *); 
END (* Power *); 

It's tempting to wish that the declaration above were pos- 
sible. Unfortunately, the Pascal compiler will not accept it. Al- 
though you may assign a value to the function and therefore 
use the function name on the left-hand side of an assignment 
statement within the function body, you may not, in general, 
use that same name within the body on the right-hand side of 
an assignment, or in any expression. 

Whenever the compiler sees a lone function name on the 
left-hand side of an assignment, it views that name as a physi- 
cal destination for some value. (In other words, for purposes of 
assignment, it treats the function name as a variable name. 
This makes sense, since similar memory storage is used to 
hold the values of both variables and functions.) Whenever the 
compiler sees a function name in an expression, however, it 
wants to treat that name as a function call. Thus, to use a func- 
tion's name in an expression within the function body itself is to 
indicate that the function should call itself! 

A function that calls itself — a "recursive" function — is not 
so strange (or rare) a beast as you might at first assume. Re- 
cursion is used often by advanced Pascal programmers, and 
will be the topic of at least one future column. At this point, 
though, we're not concerned with recursion, and do not want 
Power to operate that way. Fortunately, any and every func- 
tion call — even a recursive one — must be complete, and in- 
clude an actual parameter list if the function requires param- 
eters. In trying to process the second version of Power, the 
compiler will encounter the function name as part of a data ex- 
pression (Power * Base), assume that you intend a (recur- 
sive) function call, and complain when it doesn't find an ac- 
tual parameter list after the function name. In short, Pascal 
does not, when scanning the erroneous function above, recog- 
nize any recursive function calls. Rather, it notes, and informs 
you of, your abuses of Power. 

Some Built-in Functions. Now that you understand a little 
bit about how to write and use functions, you should become fa- 
miliar with several built-in functions that Apple Pascal pro- 
vides to you. You don't have to define these handy functions— 
you can use and benefit from them immediately. 

FUNCTION Abs (Number: Real): Real; 

FUNCTION Abs (Number: Integer): Integer; 

Abs returns the "ABSolute value," or magnitude, of Num- 
ber. In other words, when Number is negative, Abs (Number) 
= -Number, and when Number is positive, or zero, Abs (Num- 
ber) = Number. The function value returned is Real when 
Number is Real, Integer when Number is Integer. Of course, 
there is actually only one Abs function, but, like many built-in 
functions (and unlike any user-defined functions), it can ac- 
cept parameters of different types, and will return a function 
value that reflects the type of its parameter. Abs, having 
powers and abilities far beyond those of ordinary functions, is 
therefore an "anomalous" function, in the same way that 
Write and WriteLn are "anomalous" procedures. 

What is Abs (-39)? How about Abs (-39.0), Abs(0), 
Abs (0.0), Abs (3,1415), and Abs (3)? What is the data type of 
each function value in these examples? 

FUNCTION Chr(Number: Integer): Char; 

As we've seen, Chr returns the character that is associated 
with Number, according to the ASCII correspondence. ASCII 
defines only Chr(0) to Chr (127), but Chr will accept any non- 
negative integer expression as its parameter. (We'll discuss

the reason for this in a future column.) In general, you should 
write your programs to ensure that only proper, ASCII-range 
integers are fed to Chr. 

FUNCTION Mem Avail: Integer; 

This function takes no parameters. It returns the number of 
words (two-byte units) that are not currently being used for 
Pascal programs or data in your Apple's RAM memory. Note 
that the number of words is half the number of bytes ; you can 
see how many words are available for your programs and data 
by compiling and executing this (nearly) empty program : 

PROGRAM 
HowMuch; 

(* Displays the number of free RAM WORDS available for user programs/data, 
(one word = two bytes.) Number is approximate — accurate to within twenty- 
five bytes or so (the size of this program!). *) 
BEGIN (* HowMuch *) 

WriteLn(MemAvail); 
END (* HowMuch *). 

You may be tempted to see how many bytes are available, 
by displaying "MemAvail*2" instead of just "MemAvail." Go 
ahead, try it. Then try to explain the negative number you re- 
ceive ! This happens because MemAvail (at 18824, on this Ap- 
ple) is greater than 16383, so MemAvail*2 is certainly greater 
than 32767. The expression MemAvail*2 thus represents a 
value that is outside the range of Apple Pascal's Integer data 
type. The displayed value of this expression is negative, and 
you may consider it a garbage value, even though it does, in- 
deed, bear a mathematical relationship to the correct value. 
(For the moment, we leave it to the stout-hearted reader to de- 
termine what this relationship is — we will, however, explore it 
in a future column.) 

FUNCTION Odd (Number: Integer): Boolean; 

If Number is odd, True is returned as the function value, 
otherwise False is returned. For practice, try evaluating 
Odd(0), Odd (5), and Odd(-2). If you need to check your an- 
swers, write a small program to do so. 

FUNCTION Ord (Value: ScalarType): Integer; 

Ord is another "anomalous" function. There is no type 
"ScalarType," of course; this is just a way of indicating the 
wide range of data that Ord accepts as its parameter. Value 
may be from any fundamental type except Real, or from any 
user-defined enumerated type, or subrange type. Within the 
computer, all such values are represented by integers. Ord 
gives you Pascal's internal integer representation for Value. 
Ord(32) = 32. Ord(False) = 0. Ord(True) = 1. Ord('A') = 65. 

Note that, when speaking only of Char values, Ord and Chr 
are inverse functions. For example, Chr(Ord('A')) = 'A', and 
Ord (Chr (65)) = 65. Ord is most often used to permit a pro- 
gram to determine the integer value that corresponds to an ar- 
bitrary ASCII character. (We'll do this shortly.) 

FUNCTION Pred( Value: ScalarType): ScalarType; 

Another anomalous function, Pred accepts exactly the 
same types of parameters as Ord. Moreover, the function 
value of Pred is the same as its parameter. Pred returns the 
value that precedes its parameter (that is, the PREDecessor 
of Value). For instance, Pred (33) = 32, Pred(True) = False, 
Pred('B') = 'A', and so on. If Value has no predecessor (which 
is true, for example, of the Boolean value False), then Pred's 
function value is undefined. (What "being undefined" entails is 
too complicated a subject to go into just now. Use of "unde- 
fined values" can lead to strange program behavior, including 
program abortion, and should be avoided by all but expe- 
rienced — and very brave— Pascal programmers.) 

FUNCTION PwrOfTen (Exponent: Integer): Real; 

The Real number 10, raised to the power of Exponent, is re- 
turned as this function's value. To illustrate, PwrOfTen (3) = 
1000.0, PwrOfTen(O) = 1.0, and PwrOfTen (-2) = 0.01. Expo- 
nent may not be less than -37 or greater than 37. (In other 
words, Abs (Exponent) must be less than or equal to 37.) To my 
knowledge, PowrOfTen is rarely used, except by systems pro- 
grammers. A discussion of why it exists and why it is useful for 
system programming would be a suitable topic for another col- 



umn; let me know if you're interested! 

FUNCTION Round (Number: Real): Integer; 

Round "rounds" Number to the nearest Integer, and re- 
turns the result as its function value. Here are some examples 
that characterize Round's behavior: Round (0.0) = 0, 
Round(0.4) = 0, Round(0.5) = 1, Round(0.6) = 1, Round(-0.4) 
= 0, Round(-0.5) = -1, and Round(-0.6) = -1. 

Note that the rounded value of Number must not be great- 
er than 32767, nor less than -32767. 

FUNCTION SizeOf (<Any Variable Name or Type 

Name>): Integer; 

You can see right away that SizeOf is anomalous. It re- 
turns either the number of memory bytes that are occupied by 
the specified variable, or the number of bytes that would be oc- 
cupied by a variable of the specified type. The following exam- 
ples send type-name parameters to SizeOf: SizeOf (Real) = 4, 
SizeOf (Integer) = 2, SizeOf (Boolean) = 2, and SizeOf(Char) 
= 2. 

SizeOf is another function that is most often used by very 
advanced programmers. It may be fun to play with at this 
point, but we don't yet have any good uses for it. (We will find 
some, however, in future columns.) 

FUNCTION Sqr(Number: Integer): Integer; 

FUNCTION Sqr(Number: Real): Real; 

Sqr returns "Number*Number," and is simply a convenient 
shorthand for that expression, in the same way that the user- 
defined procedure Inc (Number), as presented in our recent 
discussion of procedures, was a convenient shorthand for 
"Number := Number + 1." Sqr(0) = 0, Sqr(1.4) = 1.96, and 
Sqr(-2) = 4. Like the Abs function, Sqr is "anomalous," and 
returns a value, the type of which agrees with that of Number. 
Thus, Sqr(l) = 1, an Integer, but Sqr(l.O) = 1.0, a Real value. 

FUNCTION Succ (Value: ScalarType): ScalarType; 

Succ is the inverse of Pred, and returns the value that fol- 
lows—that is, the SUCCessor of — Value. Succ(l) = 2, 
Succ(False) = True, Succ('A') = 'B', and so on. As with Pred, 
the type of Succ's function value depends on, and matches, the 
type of Value. Also, Value cannot be a Real number. Finally, if 
Value has no successor (which is true, for example, of the Boo- 
lean value True), then Succ (Value) is undefined. 

Because Pred and Succ are inverse functions, 
Pred(Succ (Value)) = Value, and Succ (Pred (Value)) = Value. 
FUNCTION Trunc (Number: Real): Integer; 

Number's fractional part is removed (that is, 
TRUNCated) , and the resulting quantity, converted to an inte- 
ger, is returned as Trunc's function value. Thus, Trunc (0.123) 
= 0, Trunc (2.718) = 2, Trunc (-0.5) = 0, and Trunc (-10.8) = 
-10. Contrast Trunc's behavior with that of Round. Note, for 
instance, that while Round(0.5) = 1, Trunc(0.5) = 0. In par- 
ticular, Round may be defined in terms of Trunc, as follows: 

FUNCTION 
Round(Number 
:Real) 
: Integer; 

(* Returns Number, rounded to nearest Integer *) 
BEGIN (* Round *) 
IF (Number >= 0.0) 
THEN 

Round := Trunc(Number + 0.5) 
ELSE 

Round := Trunc(Number — 0.5); 
END (* Round *); 

The truncated value of Number may not be greater than 
32767, nor less than -32767. 

Although we're about to use a couple of built-in functions in 
order to tie up some loose ends from last month's discussion, I 
don't have space to present relevant usage examples for ev- 
ery function listed here. This shouldn't stop you from experi- 
menting with them while you await the next issue of Softalk ! 

Functions vs. Procedures. Last time, we gave you the head- 
ing, but not the body, for a procedure called Capitalize. Here is 
the entire procedure: 



36 



m sunn 



MARCH 1982 



PROCEDURE 
Capitalize(VAR 
Ch 
: Char) ; 

(* If Ch contains a lower-case letter, transform its value to upper-case (capital) *) 
BEGIN (* Capitalize *) 

IF ((Ch >= 'a') AND (CH <= V)) 

THEN (* It's a lower-case letter — transform it! *) 

Ch != Chr(Ord(Ch) - Ord('a') + Ord('A')); 
(* Otherwise, it's not a lower-case letter, so leave it alone. *) 
END (* Capitalize *); 

In writing Capitalize, we've made some crucial 
assumptions about the ordering of values in the Char type. Spe- 
cifically, it's assumed that alphabetic characters are ordered 
alphabetically, in an unbroken (contiguous) sequence. In other 
words, A immediately precedes B, which immediately pre- 
cedes C, which immediately precedes D, and so on to Z, with 
the same being true of the lower-case alphabet. (This means 
that Ord('A') is one less than Ord('B'), which is one less than 
Ord('C'), and so on.) Given these assumptions (which are 
valid for the ASCII character set), let's consider how Capital- 
ize works. 

If Chi and Ch2 are Char values, then (Chi = Ch2) only when 
(Ord(Chl) = Ord(Ch2)). Similarly, (Chi < Ch2) only when 
(Ord(Chl) < Ord(Ch2)), and so on for all the other relational 
operators. All the relational operators apply to values of type 
Char, and yield True or False depending upon the relationship 
between the Ords of the values involved. A character Ch is 
lower case if ((Ch >= 'a') and (Ch <= 'z')) — that is, when 
((Ord(Ch) >= Ord('a')) AND (Ord(Ch) <= Ord('z'))). 

If you subtract Ord('a') from the Ord of any lower-case let- 
ter, you get a number from 0 to 25, where 0 corresponds to 'a', 
and 25 corresponds to 'z.' If you then add this number to 
Ord ('A'), you get a number that falls in the inclusive interval 
[Ord('A') .. Ord('Z')]. Taking the Chr of this number, you get 
the capital version of the original lower-case letter. 

Because Capitalize was written in this way, the conversion 
from lower case to capitals is independent of the exact values 
of Ord('A') and Ord('a'). We could have used the number 65 
for Ord('A') and 97 for Ord('a'). In fact, this has been done 
many times by other programmers. But I'm lazy and hate to re- 
member obscure numbers like Ord('A'). Not only that, but my 
memory might someday lapse, and I could specify the wrong 
number — perhaps 64 or 66, instead of 65 — when writing a pro- 
gram ! Then where would I be (not to mention the unfortunate 
individual who encounters that bug while using my pro- 
gram)? It's far easier (and safer) for me to use Ord('A') and 
Ord ('a') , thus letting the computer do the work of remember- 
ing what those numbers are. 

Written as a procedure, Capitalize exhibits a couple of 
minor weaknesses. First, its actual parameter must be an in- 
dividual Char variable, since the corresponding formal pa- 
rameter is prefaced with the keyword VAR. Thus, everything 
you want to capitalize must be put in a variable before Capi- 
talize can affect it — you cannot provide Capitalize with a Char 
expression as parameter. 

Secondly, Capitalize can (and often does) change the value 
of its parameter. For instance, if you hand Capitalize a vari- 
able that contains a lower-case 'q,' the procedure destroys that 
value, and replaces it with a capital 'Q.' Unless a program has 
taken steps to remember that the value in the variable was 
once lower case, all traces of the original value are lost for- 
ever. (Capitalize, then, is like the novice stage magician, who 
asks you for a ten-dollar bill, proceeds to tear it up as part of a 
trick, and then can't remember how to reassemble it. If you 
can make do with a shredded bill, everything's fine; other- 
wise, tough luck ! ) If you want to retain your original data, you 
must send Capitalize a copy of that data on which to work. It's 
easy enough to make that copy — just assign the original value 
to a spare variable that you have declared precisely for this 
purpose — but the extra statements involved are tedious to 
write, especially if you use Capitalize frequently. (Again, my 
laziness shows.) 



Now, let me show you how Capitalize would be rewritten as 
a function, named Capital: 

FUNCTION 
Capital (Ch 

=Char) 

: Char; 

(* Return Ch, converted to upper case (capital) if Ch is lower case. *) 
BEGIN (* Capital *) 

Capital := Ch; (* No change unless lower case *) 
IF ((Ch >= 'a') AND (CH <= 'z')) 

THEN (* It's a lower-case letter — transform it! *) 

Capital == Chr(Ord(Ch) - Ord('a') + Ord('A*)) ; 
(* Otherwise, it's not a lower-case letter, so leave it alone. *) 
END (* Capital *); 

Capital can accept any Char expression — not just a vari- 
able — as its actual parameter. If you do specify a variable as 
an actual parameter, Capital cannot affect (obliterate) its con- 
tents. Also, Capital's function value can be assigned directly to 
variables or used in expressions. Finally, supposing you do 
want to replace the contents of a Char variable — for example, 
ChVar— with its upper-case equivalent, then "ChVar := Capi- 
tal (ChVar)" is all that you need write. 

How I Name Procedures and Functions. To conclude this 
month's discussion, let me tell you why I named the capitali- 
zation procedure "Capitalize" but called the capitalization 
function "Capital." 

Procedures replace statements — they do things, and there- 
fore correspond to verbs in a natural language (such as En- 
glish or German). Good procedure names, in my opinion, are 
command-tense verbs (such as "Write," "Capitalize," and 
"Create"). "Write ('a')" is, again in my opinion, a succinct and 
understandable rendering of the English "Write a (lower- 
case) 'a'!" The procedure call " Unlock (FrontDoor)" is self- 
explanatory and also fits the mold. 

Functions replace expressions — they are things, and so cor- 
respond to nouns in a natural language. Consequently, func- 
tions should be named with a part of speech that, in combina- 
tion with the function's parameter list, completes a noun 
phrase, as perceived by a human reader. (About now, you are 
probably wishing you had paid more attention to the gram- 
mar school English teacher, but, believe me, the concept is 
much more easily grasped and applied than described!) The 
functions "Capital" and "SizeOf" are good examples. The Pas- 
cal expression "Capital ('a') = 'A' " is a very good Pascal ren- 
dering of the English sentence "The capital of 'a' is 'A'," while 
"SizeOf (Real) = 4" is a passable translation of the English 
"The size of Real (objects) is four (bytes) ." "Capital" is an ad- 
jective. In combination with the "noun" represented by the pa- 
rameter, it gives a complete noun phrase. In other words, 
"Capital('a')" describes, or names, something. "Of Real" is a 
genitive phrase. In our example, it follows the noun "size," 
and indicates which size is being described. Again, the com- 
plete phrase — "size of Real" — describes or names something. 
In contrast, "Write (Number) " doesn't describe anything. It 
implores action. 

To go into greater detail about how to choose procedure 
names that "complete the verb phrase" or function names that 
"complete the noun phrase," we'd have to mention a few more^" 
parts of English speech, and perhaps run the risk of putting you 
to sleep. There's probably no need to run this into the ground— 
you get the idea. Nevertheless, it's good to dwell on these is- 
sues of programming style from time to time. The time you 
spend considering such "niceties" will lead to clearer, more 
readable programs, and, in the end, will help you to become 
far more expert in the art and science of programming and 
even more productive than those who "have no time to waste 
on such trivial matters." 

"Too much thinking, and not enough doing," say they, 
"never accomplishes anything." 

"On the other hand," say I, "sometimes the more thinking 
you do, the less hard labor you have to do." And the less work I 
have to do, the better I like it. Hi

Anybody who has read Kipling knows that freema- 
sons will go to the ends of the earth together, facing all 
obstacles. Like Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnahan in 
"The Man Who Would Be King," people who are al- 
most instinctively drawn together in a fellowship often 
attempt to conquer unknown territory and set them- 
selves up as its masters. 

Freemasonry still exists today in its most tradi- 
tional form; in addition, its spirit takes on various 
forms throughout the world. If one stretches the defini- 
tion to include masonry as practiced by a stonemason, 
it's not hard to conceive of a fellowship of artisans, 
bound together by their art. 

It's no accidental flight of fantasy that the Stone- 
ware, Inc., logo has a little man chipping away at it, 
painstakingly using hammer and chisel to fashion the 
final E. Software authors can be compared to stonema- 
sons and artisans of old, skilled workmen who build by 
laying up units of material. Programmers frequently 
spend hours laboring over one little piece of a highly 
technical product. 

Beginning a Tradition of Quality. Some software 
publishers throw a product on the market and let it go. 
This is not the case with Stoneware and its best selling 
DB Master. 

From the top down, Stoneware tries to live out the 
idea that software is the work of artisans. Ken Klein, 
vice president and chief operating officer of Stone- 
ware, is adamant in his position concerning user sup- 
port, going far beyond the usual standards in making 
sure a product is understood and used to its utmost. His 




belief is that the attention given during the creation of a 
product should continue after it is out in the world. 

Legend has it that the little guy chipping away at the 
Stoneware logo is Barney Stone, founder and chief pro- 
grammer of the company. The likeness may be some- 
what lacking, but the thought is what counts. 

Stone is a small man with a dark beard; he's confi- 
dent, funny, and friendly. Stone first heard of micro- 
computers while he was working for an industrial video 
company in Philadelphia. He built his first computer 
out of a kit and after that set out to become a program- 
mer, beginning with Basic. 

In the late seventies, Stone worked for a small chain 
of electronics stores. When he left his job, he received 
an Apple as severance pay. Soon after, he moved out 
West to go to school. Numerous distractions and other 
interruptions had affected Stone's education before; 
coming to the San Francisco Bay area and Berkeley 
didn't alter this pattern. 

Stone's fascination with computers won out over the 
academic life ; he left school to work full time at Com- 
puterLand of San Francisco. In his year-long tenure 
there, he gained a tremendous amount of knowledge 
about computers. Sometime in late 1978, Stone met 
Mike Belling and Ken Klein, the two future business as- 
sociates who would be instrumental in making Stone- 
ware what it is today. 

Up From the Stone Age. It Was early in 1979 that 
Barney Stone finished writing his first software prod- 
uct for sale. His creation was Micro Memo, a calendar 
program that remains usable to this day. Having

caught the business bug, Stone wanted to start a company — 
software publishing with distribution. 

In order to make the company a viable entity, Stone also ob- 
tained the rights to Bill Budge's first game, Tranquility Base, a 
top lunar lander program. This marked the start of Stoneware 
Computer Products. Stone also picked up two games by Arthur 
Wells, Bloody Murder and Micro League Baseball, along with 
Aristotle's Apple by Scott Kamins. 

Working out of a post office box and his car, Stone soon 
found that too much of his time was being swallowed up by the 
business. In early spring 1980, he realized that he would either 
have to give up the company or give up programming. 

Friends in Need. At this point, Stone turned to Ken Klein 
and Mike Belling, owners of a retail computer store in the San 
Francisco Bay area, and his good friends. In April of that year, 
Belling and Klein bought Stoneware, agreeing to retain the 
original name. 

Ken Klein, a big man with a serious face, was born in 
Brooklyn and raised in Texas. Before becoming involved in the 
microcomputer software industry, Klein was in the army for 
three years and then a photographer for six. The desire to eat 
three meals a day caused Klein to seek out a more lucrative 
career. His uncle advised him to look into computers. 

Klein attended technical school on Saturdays, and was soon 
programming mainframes. He liked this enough to spend most 
of the next fifteen years as a programmer and systems ana- 
lyst for seven or eight different companies on the East Coast. 
From 1977 to 1979, Klein worked as a consultant; it was toward 
the end of this period that he got wind of micros through a re- 
tail store in New Jersey. 

To backtrack a little, Klein's sister, Sue, got married in 
March 1978 to Mike Belling. Bucking the odds in brother-in-law 
relations, Belling suggested that he and Klein might become 
partners, should they find a business they'd like to start. 

The idea of a computer retail store fascinated Klein, so he 
asked around the stores he frequented on the East Coast, and

popped up as one worth investigating. 

Klein contacted Belling, who lived in San Francisco. One of 
them would have to make the cross-country move ; Klein won 
the honor, and Klein and Belling opened their first store in San 
Rafael, California, in April, 1979. 

Origin Story. Not too long after Klein and Belling bought 
Stoneware, Stone, eager to get back to some serious program- 
ming, asked Klein what kind of program was most needed for 
the Apple. Klein uttered the fateful words: "A good database 
management system." 

Stone went to work. He found that he was able to do much of 
the designing on his own, but came up against some obstacles 
that seemed insurmountable. The file handling system was 
crucial and he turned to Apple Computer for help. 

Apple recommended Stanley Crane and Jerry Macon of Al- 
pine Software, who had developed a file handling system that 
they wanted to market. Stone flew out to California and spent a 
month of all-nighters incorporating Crane and Macon's pro- 
gram into the growing DB Master. But this was just the begin- 
ning; about nine months of hard work would go into the devel- 
opment of DB Master. 

Stone, Klein, and Belling formulated the concept of DB 
Master at a time when there really wasn't anything like it on 
the market. Stone found that he had time to tackle the task of 
developing the product properly, while Klein and Belling had 
the software publishing business to market it. 

Teamwork Counts. The first edition of DB Master shipped 
in November 1980. About a month before this, Lou Long, a 
friend of Mike Belling's joined the Stoneware staff as market- 
ing manager. This USC graduate assumed responsibility for 
product marketing. Since coming on board, Long has been pro- 
moted to general manager and has done a superb job. In the 
rapid-fire world of business software, DB Master has had un- 
qualified success, due largely to the efforts of Long. 

Mike Belling's background in business has also been a tre- 
mendous help to the company. Packaging and marketing- 
things that weren't Barney Stone's forte despite lots of hard 
work— were Belling's specialties. In Belling's capable hands, 
Stoneware's growth has been well managed, especially when 
you consider that the initial production projections for DB 
Master were exceeded by 250 percent. 

The enthusiasm and expertise of other Stoneware em- 
ployees has also contributed to the company's success. Marian 
Clerc, the administrative coordinator, was Stoneware's first 
outside employee. Other principals in the Stoneware roster in- 
clude Frank Diffley, another friend of Belling's whose job is in- 
ternational marketing; Frank Colin, head of technical sup- 
port; and Bruce Herbert, who handles all the inhouse machine 
maintenance. 

Overall, they are a hardworking, likable bunch. 

Their Hit Parade. Barney Stone no longer owns Stoneware, 
but he does maintain a close working relationship with the 
company that bears his name. Living now in Colorado Springs, 
Colorado, Stone has his own software development firm, DB 
Master Associates, which he formed with Crane and Macon of 
Alpine. Stone plans to develop more DB Master-related prod- 
ucts, as well as a few items characteristically shrouded in 
mystery for now. 

Stoneware originally made the Top Thirty of Softalk'B first 
bestseller poll (October 1980) with Tranquility Base (ranked 
twenty-eighth) , but DB Master, which first made the list in 
March (ranked twenty-seventh) would come to be one of the 
longest-lived bestsellers on Softalk's list. In the months that fol-

Even more telling of DB Master's success is its dominant

maintained a position second only to VisiCalc. Softalk first ad- 
dressed the business ten in the February 1981 issue and DB 
Master placed ninth. It went to fourth and then to third. In 
May, DB Master placed second in the business ten, and it held 
that spot all the way through January of this year. Its lesser 
showings in last month's poll are more than likely due to the 
huge rush of Christmas releases and the inclusion of several 
software packages in the Apple family pack. 

Since its original release, DB Master has undergone sever- 
al updates and been enhanced by various add-on packages. Al- 
ready on the market and soon to be released are DB Master 
Utility Pak #1, DB Master Utility Pak #2, DB Master Hard Disk 
Version, and DB Master Stak Pak. 

Back to the Well. As we enter perhaps the most important 
year yet in the microcomputer industry, Stoneware has two 
new products on the market: Compucube, a program by Rich- 
ard Stauduhar that simulates the mathematical puzzle cre- 
ated by Erno Rubik ; and the Illustrator, a graphics program 
for the Apple, to be followed soon by the Illustrator II. 

The smallness of Stoneware's product line should not be 
taken as their riding the success of DB Master. Klein is quick 
to make clear that he will not stand for mediocre software. He 
reviews all potential products and won't allow anything to go 
onto the market with the Stoneware name on it unless it meets 
his high standards. 

One of the keys to Stoneware's success has been its user- 
support system. Every day, three or four people sit by the 
phone solely to answer users' questions and help solve their 
problems. Although DB Master has sold some thirteen 
thousand packages to date, it's not an easy program to learn. 
Belling and Klein say their worst problem is convincing people 
to read the manual. 

This relationship between the software company and its 
customers is a mutually satisfying one. User feedback on the 
DB Master manual has resulted in a new version of the manual 
due sometime this summer. Much of the content of the utility 



packs was also inspired by user feedback. Ken Klein realizes 
that running a support group can be expensive but feels that it 
more than pays for itself. A satisfied customer is the best kind 
of advertisement. 

The Best Mousetrap. Much of Stoneware's marketing 
strategy stems from Klein's and Belling's involvement with 
the retail end of the business. They know of the pressures and 
concerns that attend this part of the process. Some retail stores 
like to sell a product and never be bothered with it again; Klein 
boasts that when a call comes in to Stoneware, it's usually 
turned around within twenty-four hours. 

Klein admits that dealing with the public can be difficult at 
times, but software publishers have a responsibility. If they 
don't live up to that responsibility, it's a disservice to every- 
one — users, dealers, and themselves. Stoneware is in business 
for the long run and wants all its customers to feel like winners. 

Located fifteen miles north of San Francisco, Stoneware is 
in the middle of what they hope is the never-ending process of 
development and expansion that characterizes a vital and suc- 
cessful business. Twenty-six employees inhabit three build- 
ings within one block of each other on Belvedere Avenue. Dur- 
ing the recent torrential rains that pelted the Bay area, the 
street disappeared and water was lapping at the door. Work 
ceased for two days as people found it impossible to get to and 
from work. 

The Secret. Almost everyone at Stoneware has one of life's 
saving graces — a sense of humor. Led by the almost larger 
than life Mike Belling, Stoneware radiates good humor, though 
their business is very serious. There's this thing called success, 
but it's so much sweeter when you're having a good time. 

The attitude of looking upon software publishing as an art 
may not be original with Stoneware, but it ensures the compa- 
ny's reputation, respected position, and continued presence in 
the marketplace. The people at Stoneware are trying harder 
all the time to make their products better so that everyone con- 
cerned will come out a winner. HI 



Why do unnecessary surgery 
on your Apple? 



Sooner or later, you're going to need a 16K 
memory-expansion for your Apple. When you 
do, we suggest you buy it on the card that doesn't 
require poking about on the motherboard— nor 
removing a RAM chip, installing a strap, etc. 

The Ramex 16 RAM Board just plugs in. It's 
simple, reliable, and does its own memory 
refresh, with no additional connections. 



Run Pascal, Fortran, FP, INT and 
.other alternate languages, 56K 
CPM with a Z80 Softcard, increase 
usable memory for Visicalc by 16K. 
The possibilities are endless. Do 
it with the finest, closed-track 
engraved, epoxy sealed, 16K

board available — the Ramex 16. And do 
it without unnecessary surgery on your Apple. 

In spite of its quality, the Ramex 16 costs less 
than most other expansion boards — just 
$139-95. And it comes with a one year limited 
warranty, instead of the usual 90 days.

□ Steven W. Pederson and Sherwin A. 
Steffin, president and chairman of the 
board of Edu-Ware Services (Agoura, 
CA) , have been named as defendants in a 
suit filed against Edu-Ware by Game 
Designer's Workshop, alleging that "de- 
fendants have jointly and individually in- 
fringed . . . copyrights by publishing and 
placing upon the market computer 
games entitled Space and Space II which 
were copied largely from Workshop's 
copyrighted books . . . (the Traveller se- 
ries) and have thereby been engaging in 
unfair trade practices and unfair compe- 
tition with Workshop to Workshop's ir- 
reparable damage." Edu-Ware has de- 
nied the allegations; the case will go to 
court April 1. □ David G. Mullich has 
been promoted to the position of vice- 
president of software development, after 
two years of programming systems for 
Edu-Ware. He will be coordinating the 
development of the company's Edu-Ware 
and Interactive Fantasies software. 

□ Personal Software (San Jose, CA) has 
changed its name to VisiCorp. Chairman 
and founder Dan Fylstra took the move 
to establish a closer identification with 
VisiCalc and the company's line of re- 
lated programs. Said Fylstra: "Our 
name change is part of a high visibility 
and aggressive marketing program to 
establish brand recognition, and in- 
cludes a major advertising campaign 
and dramatic new product packaging." 

VisiCorp's 1981 revenues increased 
fivefold over 1980, placing the company 
at the $20 million revenue level. 

□ Japan Economic Journal confirms 
that Hitachi Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) will 
ship samples of its 256K RAM chip to sub- 
sidiaries this fall, gearing up for volume 
sales beginning in the spring of 1983. In- 
dustry analysts believe that Hitachi's 
high-density chip will beat all other man- 
ufacturers to the market by two years, 
thereby further increasing the Japanese 
semiconductor industry's share of the 
memory-component market beyond the 
present 69.5 percent and cutting the price 
of microcomputers by as much as 15 per- 
cent. 

□ Programs Unlimited (Jericho/White 
Plains, NY), the computer center that 
developed the "software supermarket" 
computer store concept, has been 
granted franchise authorization by 
government regulatory bodies in thirty- 
six states. They are now accepting appli- 
cations for franchises. Franchises will 
receive assistance in site location and 
lease acquisition and will benefit from a 
national advertising program and parti- 
cipation in trade shows. The company 



provides on-site management training, 
inventory training, and financing to 
qualified applicants to assist with the re- 
quired capital investment, estimated at 
between $162,000 and $241,000. 

□ Following the acquisition last fall of all 
outstanding stock in Dynacomp (Roches- 
ter, NY) by Dr. Frederick Ruckdeschel, 
reorganization and expansion of the firm 
has resulted in the appointment of Ms. 
Beverly Rivers to the position of 
secretary-treasurer, her election to the 
board of directors, and the election to the 
board of Dr. Janet Bernstein. Dr. Arthur 
Gleiner has been named software re- 
view manager, and Charles Meyers is 
software development manager. 

□ Sourcecable, a consumer information 
service of Source Telecommunications 
(McLean, VA) is being offered in com- 
munity franchise packages from Cox 
Cable Communications, Cross Country 
Cable, Storer Cable Communications, 
and United Cable Television. The ser- 
vice will include general, sports, and 
business news, educational exercises, 
home shopping, a library of home and 
consumer information, and electronic 
games. It can be tailored to fit the spec- 
ifications of the system operator and the 
information needs of the community. The 
first active marketing of the service will 
begin in Omaha this spring. 

□ SSM(San Jose, CA) has promoted 
David J. Wertzberger from director to 
the new position of vice president of mar- 
keting and sales. Wertzberger joined 
SSM in May 1981, bringing to the com- 
pany fifteen years of end-user applica- 
tions and OEM experience. He will be re- 
sponsible for marketing and sales pro- 
grams involving Transend data commu- 
nications software, and board-level prod- 
ucts for the IEEE 696/S-1000 bus and Ap- 
ple II. 

Preparing for its push in OEM and 
end-user markets under Wertzberger's 
guidance, SSM has expanded its San Jose 
offices, doubling the plant's manufactur- 
ing and warehousing capabilities. 

□ Software Distributors (Culver City, 
CA) has announced the appointments of 
Linda Johnson as vice president of ad- 
ministration and David Dorsey as sales 
manager. Johnson previously worked in 
the sales and marketing division of a dis- 
tributor for consumer electronic prod- 
ucts. Dorsey served for three years as 
national sales manager for a wholesale 
distributor. 

□ Software Design Associates (New 
York, NY), currently involved in the 
manufacture of a line of productivity 
tools for Fortune 500 companies, has ap- 



pointed Michael S. Ornstein director of 
technical development. He will be re- 
sponsible for identifying and developing 
new marketing opportunities and over- 
seeing the expansion of SDA products in 
technical and management services. 
Ornstein began his career at IBM, where 
he spent nine years in marketing and 
technical functions, and was most re- 
cently assistant vice president at Blue 
Cross/Blue Shield of New York. 

□ Structured for system houses, com- 
puter consultants, and OEMs, the new 
software dealer distribution program in- 
troduced by Mlcrocon SoftwareCenters 
offers a selection of fifteen hundred prod- 
ucts at competitive prices. According to 
Barry J. Passen, president, "Our pro- 
gram affords independent consultants 
the opportunity to establish their busi- 
ness without the typical heavy initial in- 
vestment of hardware and software. Ad- 
ditionally, consultants can be more ob- 
jective in analyzing their clients' needs 
as they can demonstrate software on a 
variety of microcomputers."

Gome and See Us at 

The Computer Faine! 

Rumor has it that March is a good month to visit San Francisco and the Bay Area. If s just a matter of coincidence that 
the West Coast Computer Faire is the same month. 

Last year Softalk was at the fair, but we didn't have a booth. This year things will be different. 

If you attend the fair in San Francisco, March 19-22, stop by our booth and we'll make it worth your while. 

The first copies of Roger Wagner's Assembly Lines: The Book will be on display and for sale. The first issue of Demo 
Disk, a new magazine on diskette that features demos of current software from major publishers, will be available 
free of charge to anyone possessing a blank disk. 

We will also be offering a special introductory price on Softdisk Magazette, the successful user oriented publication 
contained entirely on a floppy disk. Bring a blank disk and you can get the latest issue of Softdisk for the 
low price of $5. 

There will also be an opportunity to purchase Softalk's August '81 cover art in poster form. This beautiful painting by 
Robert Zraick of a robot holding a rainbow colored apple makes for a handsome addition to any Apple lover's com- 
puter room. 

We'll also have copies of Softline, our gamer magazine, for free distribution to anyone with a burning desire to see 
what is new and happening in game software. 

If that isn't enough, then we'll also tell a few jokes and do some card tricks. 

The West Coast Computer Faire is an exciting event and Softalk wouldn't miss it. If you feel the same way, then stop 
by our booth and let us show you the world of Softalk Publishing.

INTRODUCTION 



Tim edition the THK HOOK OK APPLE COMPUTER SOFT- 
\\ ARK - l ( )K2 combines jm-\ iou$ editions (some re-written) and 
new artic les. re\ iew s ami e\ al nations. Judging from the response 
accorded the first edition, w Inch immediately sold out; there is a 
>ireat nee d for a jiuide to the hundreds of programs that compete 
for the Apple <>u tier's dollars, With the introduction of the Z80 
card, choices p.t even harder concerning what to purchase;" 
therefore, we dedicate this hook to you, the consumer. We hope 
\(>m will use it for a tuiidc and as a reference to assist you in mak- 
ing intelligent and informed decisions when purchasing software. 

Currently, the Apple- Computer owner is presented with a 
hew ilderinti selec tion of software from which to choose. On the 
one hand, this should please you in that, as the owner of probably 
the most popular micro-computer in the world, you have a wide 
and rapidly ijrouini; selection of software from which to choose. 
On the other hand, this wide and growing selection presents some 
problems. The \ ast majority of retail computer store staff people 
simph just do not have the time to adequately review each new 
piece of softw are that comes in their store. The problem is com- 
pounded if the new program is an extensive or complicated one, 
such as an accounting package or a word processing system, or a 
comprehensive data base management program, This does not 
me an that store pe rsonnel do not want to give you the best service 
possible: it s just that it is an almost impossible task, If you pur- 
chase software through the mail, the risks that you assume, 
without a reliable guide to assist you should be apparent. 

( )ther pitfalls aw ait the uninformed buyer. For instance, in too 
many c ases you c annot by the appearance of the package whether 
the- program requires Integer Basic of Applesoft Basic or whether 
it needs 16. 32 or 4SK of RAM. It is also often difficult to tell 
w lien you purchase- a program on tape whether it can be trans- 
ferred to disk or. if a disk program is purchased. 1 whether it can 
be copied or not. 

Another area that can present problems to the buyer is the 
similarity of software- A well -stocked computer store may 
possibly offer fi \ e different word processing packages, four 
assemblers, ten different adventure type games and»'or several 
mail list programs, (the- choices seem endless): all of which have 
ob\ iems ad\ ant ages and disacb an (ages as well as different prices. 

The goal of "The- Book' is to e liminate as mam of these poten- 
tial problem areas for the software buyer as possible. 

\\ e w elcome any comments or e ri tie isms from readers that will 
help us in reaching this goal.

Ahead And 




VOIR 
APPLE 



BY DAM FISCHER AMD 
HOfcCAtt P. (AFFREY 

It's a rare free evening and you're deeply involved in a good 
book. You're barely aware of the music you have playing in the 
background, and you're totally oblivious to the load of laundry 
you put in the washer before you sat down. 

Occasionally, favorite passages in the music draw you out of 
the book for a moment ; later on, a buzzer summons you to tend 
to the wash, transfer it to the dryer, and set another buzzer, af- 
ter which you return to your book. 

Asked later what you did this night, you'll say you spent the 
evening reading. But your ability to respond to interruptions, 
such as particularly pleasurable musical passages or the nec- 
essary laundry manipulations, enabled you to accomplish 
more than one activity virtually at the same time. 

What if your Apple could respond to interruptions in a simi- 
lar way? Naturally, it would do so at thousands of times the 
pace you do— if it could do it at all. And, thus, it would perform 
more than one task while apparently fully concentrated on one. 

Well, your Apple can do this, and it does it by means of what 
are called, logically, interrupts. If you'd like to be playing Wiz- 
ardry while your Apple prints your entire budget from Visir 
Calc, take heart and read on. 

During 1981, we wrote a program that teaches the Apple to 
do two things at once. Doubletime Printer, which includes an 
enhanced F8 ROM chip, allows the Apple to print text files at 
the same time as it is running another program. A person 
using this program could be printing one file while editing 
another. 

The techniques we used and the lessons we learned can be 
useful in many other applications, most of which involve inter- 
rupts. The only requirement is that the programmer under- 
stand something about the internal workings of the Apple II.

mation, starting with the basics so the novice won't be over- 
whelmed. Also included, however, is information that should 
offer some meat for the expert programmer as well. 

A Bit of Background. The heart of any personal computer 
(or rather its brain) is, of course, a device called a microproc- 
essor chip. In the case of the Apple II, the microprocessor chip 
is the 6502, the big, forty-pin rectangle in row H of the mother- 
board. 

Until just a few years ago, it would have taken a whole 
roomful of equipment to do what the 6502 does. Relative to the 
central processing units (CPUs) of the early computers back 
in the forties and fifties, the 6502 is fast, reliable, and 
sophisticated. 

The 6502 microprocessor has several features that aren't 
used in the Apple II. One feature that hasn't been taken advan- 
tage of much is the interrupt. An interrupt forces the micro- 
processor to stop whatever it is doing and go do something 
else. Then when the "something else" is completed, the mi- 
croprocessor picks up where it left off in its former task. 

Before we talk about interrupts, let's take a few minutes to 
discuss how the 6502 knows what to do and then how it does it. 

When you remove the top from your Apple and look inside, 
the chips you see inside the white box painted on the outside of 
the Apple motherboard are memory chips. There's room here 
for three rows of eight chips ; each row provides storage space 
for 16,384 characters or numbers. Multiplying 16,384 by 3 pro- 
duces 49,152. Oddly enough, this is referred to as a 48K mem- 
ory system. If you have a language or RAM card in slot 0, you 
have an additional 16K of memory, giving you a 64K system. 

What Shall Be Done with Memory? Each location in mem- 
ory may serve either as coded instructions to tell the com- 
puter what to do (a program) or data for the program to act 
on. Few programs use all the memory available, so some 
memory locations may have no meaning to a particular pro- 
gram. 

The part of memory that contains the instructions for the 
microprocessor is organized so that the instructions are lo-

cated one after the other, head to tail. Although some instruc- 
tions break the sequence by jumping backward or forward to a 
distant (nonsequential) memory location, generally instruc- 
tions are executed in sequence. 

Sequential processing works just fine ; for many purposes, 
it is the only way to go. You are reading this page sequentially, 
just as it was written. It would not make much sense if the 
same words were spread randomly around the page or if you 
read one word at a time from randomly selected lines. 

Suppose you write a program to deal with events outside 
the computer that are happening at random. Suppose it's a 
program to record the times when a light switch is turned on 
and off. One way to do this would be to tell the computer: 

"Read the switch setting. 

"If the switch is open, go back to the previous instruction. 
"If the switch is closed, read and print the time. 
"Read the switch setting. 

"If the switch is closed, go back to the previous instruction. 

"If the switch is open, go back to the original instruction." 

This little program would print the time that the light 
switch operated each time it operated. 

Unfortunately, a light-switch monitoring program such as 
this one would tie up the whole computer. With the program 
written this way, the sole function of the computer would be to 
keep tabs on the state of that one switch and report activity. If 
you have nothing else to do with your computer, this is fine. 
But what if you have another program ydu want to run? 

That's where interrupts come in. Interrupts allow the com- 
puter to do other things while waiting for the switch to operate. 
Through the use of interrupts, the switch can be operated to 
tap the computer on its electronic shoulder and say "Hey, 
mark the time. I just closed." 

Go Ahead — Interrupt Me. The 6502 was designed to permit 
external events to interrupt its processing sequence. It does 
this in such a way that it is transparent to the program that is 
running, which means that the main program never really 



knows it's been interrupted. 

A few paragraphs back, we said that the 6802 executes 
instructions that it finds in memory in the sequence that they 
are stored. Suppose you're sneaking in another chapter of that 
book you were reading when we began and someone calls out 
to you. You stop where you are and carry on a conversation. 
Then when the conversation is over, you continue reading as if 
there had been no interruption. 

Or do you? You do if you marked your place before shifting 
your attention. If you didn't mark your place — if you slammed 
shut the book and tossed it in a desk drawer to avoid being 
caught — you have to page through the book until you find 
where you were. Marking where you were would have allowed 
you to restart easily. 

In the Apple, there are two registers, memory cells within 
the microprocessor chip, that are important to the process of 
dealing with interruptions. 

The processor status register, or P register, keeps track of 
conditions that programs want to test through the use of a set 
of flags. Flags are actually on/off markers showing such 
esoteric statuses, known only to your Apple, as a zero result, 
positive result, negative result, carry from addition, borrow 
from subtraction, and several other pieces of information that 
you need not deal with directly. Some microprocessor instruc- 
tions can test these flags and change the operation sequence 
(jump forward or backward) based on the result of the test. 
One of these flags is dedicated to showing whether or not an 
interrupt has occured. 

The second register is known as the program counter, or 
PC. This register is a memory pointer that tells the micro- 
processor where to go to get its next instruction. Any jump in- 
struction just changes the contents of this register to the ad- 
dress of the desired location. 

If the processor status register and the program counter 
are saved and later restored, all the information the micro- 
processor needs to continue a program will be retained. This

makes it possible for an interrupt to change the microproces- 
sor's activity without causing it to get lost when it comes back 
to its original task. 

The Physical Interrupt. When the 8052 senses an interrupt 
signal, it marks its place by storing both its processor status 
register and its program counter in a known location. This lo- 
cation is in a special memory area designated as the stack. 
This area is especially designed to help return the program 
counter to a previous program area. 

Once the interrupted location and status are saved, the 
interrupt processing mechanism transfers the address of the 
program to handle interrupts into the program counter. This is 
effectively a jump instruction. 

When the interrupt handling program is finished, it re- 
trieves the saved values (they were placed automatically on 
the stack) to restore the processor status register and the pro- 
gram counter to the status they had before the interrupt. The 
main program continues executing without ever being aware 
that the interrupt occurred. It wouldn't matter to the fore- 
ground program whether the interrupt processing program 
used a number of hours or only a few microseconds. 

Interrupt Handling "Overhead." In addition to the proces- 
sor status register and the program counter, the 6502 uses an 
accumulator register (A) , two index registers (X and Y regis- 
ters), and the stack pointer (S). Upon return from an inter- 
rupt, all these registers must have the same values they had at 
the time of the interrupt. 

If these are not properly handled, the operating program 
may get confused and bomb out. We've seen already how the P 
register and PC are returned to their proper values. The pro- 
grammer has the responsibility to return from the interrupt 
handling program with the stack pointer (S) , accumulator (A) , 
and X and Y registers exactly as they were when the interrupt 
occurred. However, the A, X, and Y need be restored only if 
the interrupt routine changed them.

More Than One Type of Interrupt. The 6502 recognizes four 
distinct types of interrupts. The first, an interrupt request 
(IRQ) , is one that the foreground program may ignore if it sets 
the right processor status flag. The second, what's known as a 
nonmaskable interrupt (NMI) , may never be ignored, but can 
be processed in the regular way. 

The third type of interrupt is called a break (BRK) or soft- 
ware interrupt. This kind of interrupt, which does not depend 
on external events, must be planned by the programmer in ad- 
vance ; it is a debugging tool that will assist the programmer in 
locating program logic errors. The fourth kind of interrupt is 
the reset, an interrupt that attempts to return the microproc- 
essor to near its original state (its state when the power was 
first turned on) . This interrupt is used when the logic of a pro- 
gram has been hopelessly jumbled and the system has hung 
up. In the Apple II, this often leads to a reboot situation. 

The 6502 allows only three different program routines to 
process the four interrupts, and it demands that the addresses 
for these routines be stored in the last six memory locations 
(FFFA-FFFF hexadecimal or 65,629-65,535 decimal). 

That's right; three routines to handle four types of inter- 
rupts. NMI has its own routine address ; so does reset. But IRQ 
and BRK double up on one routine. 

This doesn't pose too much of a problem, though, because 
it's easy to distinguish between BRKs and IRQs. The Apple II 
uses nine memory locations to inspect the processor status 
register flags and make the distinction. 

Both the Apple's Monitor ROMs— the autostart and the old 
Monitor ROM— have a routine that the 6502 jumps to when it 
gets a BRK or an IRQ. This routine saves the A register (to get 
a register to work with) and then inspects the P register to de- 
termine whether it is processing a software BRK or a hard- 
ware generated IRQ. 

If an IRQ interrupt is what occurred, this program passes 
program control (by a simple jump instruction) to the user 
program whose address is stored by the user at memory loca- 
tions $3FE and $3FF. 

If no user routine address has been stored here, the 6502 
gets confused. Apple alleviates the confusion by returning to 
the Monitor, bombing out whatever program is running at 
the time. 

Break and Reset Don't Count. Technically, BRK and reset 
operate like interrupts in that they interrupt the running pro- 
gram and pass control to a special handling routine. But reset 
and BRK handling don't fall within the scope of this article be- 
cause they are not normal operating conditions. Both have a 
catastrophic effect on a running program. 

Now that we've limited the scope of this discussion to NMI 
and IRQ, what's the difference between the two? 

One bit in the P register disables the curcuitry that re- 
sponds to IRQs. One simple instruction sets this mask, which 
has the effect of making the microprocessor ignore this inter- 
rupt. Thus, the IRQ is often referred to as a maskable 
interrupt. 

By contrast, there is no bit that allows the microprocessor 
to ignore an NMI event. That's why such an event is called a 
nonmaskable interrupt. When the NMI interrupt line is tapped, 
the computer stops whatever it was doing and goes to see what 
it is supposed to do now. Use of the NMI line in the Apple II is 
usually disastrous ; it conflicts sharply with the operation of the 
disk operating system. 

Interrupting the Interrupt Article. Now you know what kind 
of interrupts there are and which the Apple can deal with if It's 
prepared to. Next month, we'll talk about limitations and dan- 
gers that arise from interrupting too rudely. Finally, we'll dis- 
cuss just how your Apple can learn to accept interrupts gra- 
ciously. 

In the meantime, you can go back to that book you were so 
eager to read: tonight there'll be no laundry to worry about; 
you could unhook the phone and spend an uninterrupted eve- 
ning reading. 

Well, that will have to do it. I've got to answer the door.

E-Z Draw is a graphics editing 
package for Apple II BASIC with 
simple one character commands 
so it can easily: 

• Draw dots, lines, parallelo- 
grams, triangles, circles and 
ellipses on the screen, 

• Move any area of the screen to 
any other area, 

• Transform any area of the 
screen into its mirror image 
while expanding or compress- 
ing its width or height or rotat- 
ing it 90 degrees, 

• Draw text on the screen using 
any of 20 original and imagina- 
tive type styles using the 
Higher Text Character Genera- 
tor by Ron & Darrell Aldrich, 

• Save images and complete 
pictures to the disk for use 
within BASIC programs, and 

• Draw using any of the Apple 
BASIC colors. 

This program has been used by 
professional programmers to 
generate spectacular hi-res pic- 
tures for use with their games, 
professional packages and edu- 
cational software. It can be used 
to create professional illustra- 
tions, graphs and slides in addi- 
tion to adding hi-res graphics to 
BASIC programs. E-Z Draw re- 
quires a 48k Apple II or II + and

Taylor Pohlman 



Exploring Business Basic, 
Part 7 

Last month we explored some of Busi- 
ness Basic's unique formatted output and 
arithmetic capabilities. There is a good 
more to say on those topics, but such ex- 
position will be left to some future month. 
This month we'll undertake a journey 
through some of the thickest jungles 
found in the Apple m: the infamous 
.GRAFIX driver and its faithful Indian 
companion, BGRAF.INV (the preceed- 
ing collection of mixed metaphors was 
just a sample of what some enterprising 
explorers have encountered on their own 
trips) . 

The new Business Basic manual 
(which everyone who purchased Basic 
should have received by now) , contains a 
sixty-page section in volume two that de- 
scribes the programming possible with 
the BGRAF.INV invokable module. In 
addition, the Standard Device Drivers 
Manual contains a section on .GRAFIX. 



Rather than repeat all of that material, 
this column will briefly describe the func- 
tions of BGRAF.INV and then take up a 
subject that's not mentioned at all: how 
to draw a circle. 

Drawing a circle may sound easy, but 
given that BGRAF allows only dots and 
lines, and given that none of the graphics 
modes have equal horizontal and verti- 
cal resolution, and given that monitors 
distort images because of aspect ratio 
differences, drawing a circle of arbi- 
trary radius with an arbitrary center that 
actually looks like a circle and doesn't 
take forever to finish is non-trivial. Non- 
trivial is a favorite word of mathemati- 
cians and engineers, principally because 
it allows them to assert that a task is dif- 
ficult without requiring that they figure 
out how difficult. 

Well, enough cheap shots at mathe- 
maticians. We will discover later that 
some handy mathematical principles 
will serve us well in our quest for the per- 
fect circle. 

The BGRAF Invokable Module. As 
has been discussed before, Business Ba- 



sic is almost infinitely extensible by the 
use of invokable assembly language rou- 
tines. These routines can be loaded into 
memory only when needed, and have the 
effect of adding extra commands to the 
language. Furthermore, as many invok- 
ables as will fit into memory can be used 
at once, with Apple Ill's SOS operating 
system responsible for making sure that 
there are no conflicts. BGRAF.INV is one 
of the most useful of the invokable mod- 
ules. It is supplied on the Business Basic 
program disk, and is loaded into mem- 
ory with the command: 

INVOKE "bgraf.inv" 

Those of you who have Apple II's, or 
who have used Applesoft in emulation 
mode on the Apple III, know that there 
are several commands in that language 
to manipulate color graphics. Among 
these are gr and hgr, color and hcolor, 
plot and hplot that permit initializing 
graphics modes, changing colors, and 
plotting points and lines. In addition, Ap- 
plesoft has special commands that per- 
mit the manipulation of shapes based on 
special tables that describe the bit pat- 
terns of the images. 

The BGRAF invokable has com- 
mands for all these capabilities, and a 
great deal more besides. Unlike Apple- 
soft, which has a fixed high-resolution 
page for drawing, the Apple in graphics 
modes permit plotting points within a 
range of -32768 to 32767. The concept of a 
viewport (like the window in text mode) 
is what defines which dots actually get 
plotted on the screen. Only the dots with- 
in the current viewport are actually plot- 
ted, and the viewport is limited to the 
maximum resolution of whatever graph- 
ics mode is selected. 

We'll see shortly how handy this is, be- 
cause it permits plotting generally with- 
out regard to whether the physical screen 
limits are exceeded. Exdeeding the valid 
range in an Applesoft program causes an 
error. In addition, setting the viewport to 
an area smaller than the physical screen 
permits us to draw without worrying 
about overwriting other areas outside the 



Initgrafix Initializes the viewport, cursor position, color table and transfer options 
Grafixmode Sets the current graphics mode. The four modes are: 



0 - 280 x 192 black and white 

1 - 280 x 192 color (sixteen colors with limitations) 

2 - 560 x 192 black and white 

3 - 140 x 192 color (sixteen colors with no limitations) 
Grafixon Displays the current graphics screen 

Viewport Sets the boundaries for graphics operations 

Pencolor Sets the color of the pen for draws, plots or characters 

Filleolor Sets the background color for filling and erasing 

Fillport Fills the current viewport with the fill color

viewport. To keep track of where the 
plotting operations are to take place, an 
invisible cursor is maintained, to which 
all draw and print operations relate. 

There are two capabilities of the Ap- 
ple HI graphics driver which are not well 
understood but can be extremely power- 
ful. These come under the heading of the 
color table and transfer option. Used 
properly, they can save an incredible 
amount of programmer effort. 

The color table allows you to set the 
priority of a given color. Imagine that 
you want to draw some blue lines on a 
screen that contains some yellow 
squares. Suppose, furthermore, that you 
don't want to cross the yellow squares (in 
effect, you want to draw the line behind 
the squares) . If the color table is set up 
properly, the graphics driver will auto- 
matically change any blue dots you plot 
to yellow if you try to plot them over a 
yellow dot. In any other system, your 
program would have to check the color of 
each dot before plotting, thus grinding 
everything to a virtual halt. Imagine 
what this capability could mean if you 
wanted to animate shapes of various col- 
ors over a background. 

One additional capability in Apple III 
graphics is really convenient. At any 
time you can print text directly to the 
.GRAFIX driver and it will be written at 
the current dot position. Since you can 
also change the definition of the charac- 
ter set with the newfont procedure, hi-res 
animation tricks of the sort found in the 
Apple II DOS Toolkit package are essen- 
tially built-in! 

To give you an idea of the functions of 
the BGRAF module, the command table 
lists the commands available, along with 
a brief description of each. Remember 
that to use these in Basic, the module 
must first be invoked, and the word per- 
form prefixed to each command. Quite a 
collection of goodies, right? 

As was said earlier, there is really too 
much here for one article; indeed, a 
whole book could be written about the Ap- 
ple in graphics. Rather than tackle that 
task, let's start with something seeming- 
ly simple. As you noted from reading the 
list of functions above, the major com- 
ponent that's missing is anything to do 
with curves. Rather than throwing you a 
curve (groan!), we'll try drawing some. 

Getting Around in Business Basic. To 
start, some quick math is required. You 
can think of the Apple HI screen as a co- 
ordinate system, with x and y locations 
depending on the mode. In all cases, y 
(vertical) values are displayable be- 
tween 0 (bottom) and 191 (top) . X (hori- 
zontal) values range between 0 and 139 
(lowest resolution) up to 0 to 559 (high- 
est) . Circles are nothing more than sets 
of points with a common attribute; 
namely, they are of equal distance from 
a single point called (surprisingly 
enough) the center. There are formulas 
for determining the points that lie on a 
circle, generally derived from the formu- 



la below: 

x 2 + y2=r 2 

This formula works for circles start- 
ing at a center of 0,0, but since we want to 
draw circles anywhere, and since the 
general form of the circle equation is 
more difficult to solve, we'll rely on 
another fact about circles. The trigono- 
metric functions sine and cosine define x 
and y values for the unit circle, and it is 
possible to obtain values for any circle by 
multiplying these values by the radius 
and adding the center coordinates; that 
is, to find a point on a circle of radius 30 at 
an angle of 30 degrees from horizontal, 
when the center is at a? =70 and y=96, 
these formulas can be used: 



x = COS(30 degreas)*30+70 
y = SIN(30 degree$)*30+96 

These simple formulas suggest that 
we might be ready to write a program. 

Program 1 is a relatively straightfor- 
ward program, except that the trig func- 
tions (sin, cos) work in radians, of which 
there are 2 x pi in a full circle. That value 
is approximately 6.2832, which is further 
approximated in line 100. One other thing 
of note: Since this graphics mode is not 
"square," some adjustment must be 
made for the fact that there are more 
points proportionately in one axis than in 
another. 

For simplicity, we have scaled the x- 
axis value (since that is the only one that 
varies in the different modes) by multi-

plying by the constant 140/192, the ratio 
of horizontal to vertical dots. This is done 
in line 110. The other factor in lines 110 
and 120 is the constant 30, which repre- 
sents the radius. Note also that line 170 
cleans up the graphics memory and 
closes the driver. This is very important. 
If you don't release the memory, it will 
stay around, unusable by Basic. Also, 
doing the invoke in line 180 removes the 
BGRAF module from memory. If you 
have other invokables normally resi- 
dent, you should delete this statement. 

Run this program several times, with 
different values for the step. You will no- 
tice that in addition to being pretty slow, 
it takes a step size of about .1 to draw a 
good circle. You'll probably also notice 
that this program can't draw a very good 
circle. Depending on the aspect ratio of 
your monitor, the circle will probably 
look like a flattened circle, that is, an el- 
lipse. This is so because all monitors dif- 
fer in the relationship between horizon- 
tal and vertical resolution and size. We 
will see a little later that this is an easy 
problem to correct. 

As was just mentioned, this routine 
suffers from being very slow. The main 
problem stems from the fact that it takes 
a large number of dots to create a circle, 
and that number of dots translates into a 
large number of steps to draw a circle. In 
the example above, it took approximate- 
ly sixty-four dots to draw a filled-in cir- 
cle of radius 30 units. Had we tried to 
draw a larger circle, or had we used a 
higher resolution mode, the problem 
would have been even worse. The solu- 
tion to this problem lies in understanding 
the real nature of the task at hand. 

Mathematics and mathematical 
physics is sometimes called the realm of 
the perfect. Energy truly is exactly re- 
lated to mass times the speed of light 
squared (Einstein's famous formula). 
But in the world of measured events, 
nothing is ever exact and perfect. 

The same is true of circles. Geometry 
allows us to dream of perfect circles, but 
the realities of trying to draw even one 
(especially freehand!) are such that we 
are willing to settle for reasonably good 



representations as long as they are not 
too lumpy. In fact, the resolution of any 
graphics screen — no matter how good — 
is a far cry from the perfection of a real 
circle. Therefore, when we set out to 
draw a circle on the screen, we should 
first ask, "How good a circle do we 
want?" 

A quick lesson from geometry will 
help with the answer. As you may know, 
a circle can be approximated as a poly- 
gon (a figure with many sides). The 
more sides the polygon has, the more it 
looks like a circle. Since the resolution of 
the graphics screen is limited, at some 
reasonable point a polygon will be indis- 
tinguishable from a circle. 

The advantage of this approach is that 
the Apple in has graphics commands 
available for drawing lines. Since a poly- 
gon has sides that are all straight lines, 
we can use the line drawing commands 
to represent a circle, finding the number 
of sides in each resolution which make 
reasonable looking circles. The number 
of sides necessary to make a good circle 
will also vary according to the radius of 
the circle, since large circles will be 
more likely to show the lines as straight 
segments. 

Program 2 will let you play with the 
number of sides necessary to make good 
circles and to experiment to determine 
the aspect ratio that is correct for your 
monitor. Modify this program to try 
other graphics modes and see how the 
different resolutions affect the results.

Program 2 

Several new things are done in this 
program 2. Notice that we invert the as- 
pect ratio because we are adjusting the x- 
axis only. Further, we have named the 
ratio between the x and y resolution scale 
for use in the repetitive calculations. 
Next, because we are drawing lines this 
time, the program uses the moveto pro- 
cedure to move the graphics cursor to the 
initial point on the circle (in this case, the 
horizontal point to the right of the center 
(origin) of the circle) . 

Once a starting point is established, 
subsequent lineto commands will draw 
the circle as a series of line segments. 
Try experimenting with widely vary- 
ing numbers of steps, from 1 to .02 as an 
example. You will find that at some point 
the circle looks the same, no matter how 
many line segments make it up. By 
choosing the fewest steps that still pro- 
duce a decent circle, you can speed up 
the drawing process considerably. Don't 
forget to experiment with values for as- 
pect ratio as well. For the Monitor in, a 
value of 1.3 usually works pretty well. 
Try several values until you are happy 
with the results.

The next technique for speeding up 
this routine is even more interesting. No- 
tice that we keep calculating the sine and 
cosine of each angle, no matter how 
many times we run the program. 
Furthermore, it should be apparent that 
it's possible to draw a circle of any rea- 
sonable radius by just varying the multi- 
plication factor. Further, it's obvious that 
steps of less than .05 for any reasonable 
radius do not produce better circles. All 
that suggests program 3, an enhanced 
version of the original program: 

10 OPEN#l,".grafix" 

20 INVOKE".dl/bgraf.inv"

180 INVOKE 
190 END 

Program 3 

Notice that this time two arrays have 
been set up, both with sixty-four values 
each. Rather than recalculate the sin and 
cos functions, the program does them 
once at the beginning and stores them for 
use later in lines 110 and 120. If you intend 
to do a great deal of this kind of work, or 
if you want to expand the number of steps 
significantly, you may want to create 
another program that calculates the 
values and writes them to a data file. 
Then your circle program could simply 
read the values in at the beginning. 

Notice, too, that these routines are es- 
sentially identical to the previous ones, 
except that this time you may experi- 
ment with circles of different radii. After 
experimenting with this routine, you 
should see that a general purpose rou- 
tine can be written that will satisfy all cir- 
cumstances. It's most practical to ex- 
press this as a subroutine, with the 
variables being the circle diameter, the 
mode, the scale factor and the center co- 
ordinates. The result might look like this 
program 4.

Program 4 

Program 4 is a considerably enhanced 
version. Notice that we have doubled the 
number of points that can be used, as 
well as introducing the capacity to 
change modes and colors. Since we now 
have different possibilities for the mode, 
we introduce the xdot array, which con- 
tains the horizontal dot density required 
to figure the center and the scale factor. 
The actual drawing routine is now a 
subroutine at line 900, in such a form that 
you could incorporate it into other pro- 
grams. 

To speed up the subroutine for the 
various graphics modes, the concept of 
density is introduced. This factor varies 
between one and three depending on 
whether the horizontal resolution is 140, 
280 or 560 (modes 3, 0 and 1, and 2 respec- 
tively) . Note the use of the logical state- 
ments in line 907 to replace a lot of if and 
assignment statements. Be sure you 
work through that program line in your 
mind to assure yourself that the assign- 
ments work as intended. 

The other thing to note is that the 
density factor is used in line 920 to calcu- 
late a reasonable step value for drawing 
the circle. You might want to substitute a 
few values to see just how this works. 
Line 930 makes sure the program uses a 
reasonable number of steps even if the 
circle is extremely small. 

Notice also that in line 905 the value .5 
is added to the center coordinates. This

has the effect of rounding the values 
when they are passed to the lineto pro- 
cedure in line 950, ensuring more ac- 
curate plotting. Another new feature is 
that in line 970 an additional lineto is 
added to draw a line back to the original 
point. This ensures that if the step value is 
such that the circle is not fully com- 
pleted, the last point drawn will be con- 
nected to the beginning point. 

Line 160 presents another new con- 
cept. By simply printing to the .GRAFIX 
driver file, you may write text on any 
graphics screen. Furthermore, the text 
can begin on any dot boundary any- 
where on the screen. That requires some 
pretty tricky software on the Apple II, 
but is a built-in feature of the Apple III 
graphics modes. 

Many more enhancements could be 
added to this program, but instead of 
going on and on, here's an example of 
how the program and routines could be 
modified to draw circle segments (arcs) 
and pie slices, using essentially the same 
techniques. The new program (program

Program 5 

Program 5 is set up to use lines 88 
through 100 to create random centers, 
radii and arc lengths (in radians) and to 
use the subroutine at line 1100 to draw the 
resulting arcs. This routine and the one 
above for drawing circles should equip 
you to do most of the interesting tasks in 
graphics. It's likely that these routines 
will also give you ideas on how to ap- 
proach other specific projects you might 
wish to tackle. 

Normally, when you run the arc pro- 
gram you'll get some arcs that are par- 
tially off the screen. Notice that the 
.GRAFIX driver handles such a situa- 
tion perfectly because it treats its graph- 
ics area as a space of points from -32768 
to 32767, with the screen as a window into 
the total space. This eliminates immeas- 
urable amounts of bounds checking 
within programs, a process that usually 
ends up slowing down the drawing. In ad- 
dition, as was mentioned already, the 
graphics window can be set to anywhere 
on the screen, with any values outside the 
window automatically clipped. 

There are a thousand more topics to 
be covered in exploring the graphics ca- 
pabilities of the Apple III. Next month we 
will tackle a few biggies, area fill (espe- 
cially for the circles and arcs we have 
been drawing) and the whole area of 
user-definable character sets. With luck, 
we'll get to some animation examples. 
Until then, dig into your device driver 
manual documentation on . GRAFIX and 
the writeup on BGRAF.INV in the Busi- 
ness Basic manual. There's a whole 
world inside this system! I

Tradition is an overwhelming presence at the United States 
Military Academy. It is evident from the Civil War regimental 
colors in the chapel and stringent honor code to the hazing of 
plebes and captured Mexican cannon surrounding the Battle 
Monument. 

But there are some decidedly untraditional activities be- 
hind the massive gray stone walls towering above the plain at 
West Point. And Apple computers play an increasingly impor- 
tant role in several of them. 

Inside Thayer Hall, erected in 1911 as a cavalry riding hall, 
faculty researchers work on a project designed to put an Ap- 
ple in the hands of intelligence analysts on the battlefield with 
tactical units. 

Four Apple II computers perform a wide variety of func- 
tions for members of the Cadet Computer Seminar, an in- 
creasingly popular extracurricular club. 

A new Apple Users Group was launched in February by fif- 
teen Apple owners drawn from the cadet corps, staff, and 
faculty alike. 

And the cable TV bulletin board that serves as a principal 
source of local news for the West Point community boasts an 
Apple as its nerve center, determining which message is 
shown when. 

Marching as to War. Cadets will pack a couple of eight-bit 
Apples along with their rifles and folding shovels when they 
embark on field maneuvers at nearby Camp Bruckner this 
summer. 

"We'll take them out and operate in a tent," explains 
Colonel Gilbert W. Kirby, Jr., head of the department of geo- 
graphy and computer science. "We'll use them for land navi- 
gation work, fire planning for the artillery, determining what 
weapons to deploy against potential targets, picking out loca- 
tions, and getting elevations." 

Major Francis J. Monaco, systems manager at the Acade- 
my, explains how the program is to work: 

Field commanders will no longer have to draw upon per- 
sonal experience or manual calculations to determine where to 
place weaponry. They'll just tell an Apple what they want to hit 
or, as the Army puts it, to defend from enemy aggression. The 



computer will respond with an oblique view of the terrain 
showing hills, streams, and villages as they might appear from 
a low-flying helicopter. 

After selecting a likely gun position, a commander will key- 
board its location and be rewarded with a contour plot show- 
ing precisely what targets would be accessible from that posi- 
tion and which would be blocked by forests or hills. If coverage 
is inadequate, the commander will pick another position and 
try again. 

To help make a final choice, the Apple will generate a per- 
spective view of what the terrain actually looks like from the 
weapon position. 

The Apples assigned to do all this are configured with dual 
5.25-inch floppy disk drives, a digitizing tablet, and a color 
monitor. The operating language is UCSD Pascal and the soft- 
ware was developed at West Point under Colonel Kirby's lead- 
ership. The power will come from generators on military 
vehicles. 

The maps and plots are generated from topographical data 
for a very limited area of operation in the Apple memory. 
Mass storage of data for wider fields of operations is provided 
by a Corvus central disk drive equipped with twenty-mega- 
byte Winchester disks each offering 160 times the memory of 
an Apple disk. 

Friendly Touch around the World. Why, then, did the Army 
select the Apple with its limited memory for this crucial work 
on the battlefield? 

"They're so available and user oriented," is the succinct 
rationale offerred by Colonel Gerald E. Galloway, Jr., deputy 
head of the department. He said the Apples with their Amdek 
Color I display screens are two of thirty-three assigned by the 
Army to intelligence units at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Fort 
Hood, Maryland, and in West Germany for field trials similar 
to those being planned at West Point. 

While the computers involved are small, the weaponry is 
apparently not. The venture was undertaken in cooperation 
with the Defense Nuclear Agency. 

In the field, maps and plots must be generated individually 
from digital data. Back at the computer center, Monaco dem-

onstrates how time and storage capacity are saved through 
use of a video cassette recorder. Completed maps are copied 
from the display screen and stored on video disks, each of 
them holding 54,000 map sheets in far less space than the gen- 
erating data can be stored on mag tape. 

Kirby has seen enrollment in computer science elective 
courses more than triple since the 1976-1977 academic year. 
"The Army would come to an abrupt halt should its comput- 
ers suddenly be withdrawn," he notes. "No pay, no food, no 
supplies, no personnel, no nothing! The ability of the Army to 
move, shoot, and communicate would vanish." 

In such a climate of growth and burgeoning capability, 
petty annoyances sometimes seem even more frustrating. The 
day we visited his office, Kirby was impatiently awaiting de- 
livery of a joystick for his new Apples. "Then I'll get rid of 
these damn paddles," he grumbled after a minor coordination 
failure.

TERRORIST does not skirt the issues — whether nuclear

international politics ... and the unpredictable behavior of your •

choose; in TERRORIST there is no middle ground.

MARCH 1982 




Major Francis J. Monaco. 



the map- making Apples to interface with the Corvus multi- 
plexer. But most of the Apples at West Point continue to oper- 
ate in Basic. This is true of four Apple II processors in daily use 
by the Cadet Computer Seminar under Monaco's guidance. 

And there's another important difference between the 
battle Apples and the seminar Apples: there's nothing in the 
academy budget to buy computers for extracurricular activi- 
ties such as the cadet group. 

So Monaco, demonstrating some old Army ingenuity, 
worked a series of deals to finance hardware for the seminar 
through grants from varied sources. In return, the Apple- 
minded cadets keep the books and produce mailing labels for 
other student organizations ranging from the swim team and 
i 1 ' ' ■ W^wXSSi 



Judo Club to the Jewish Chapel Choir. 

The cadets' first venture into programming their Apples in 
Pascal came through a similar arrangement with officials of 
the National Collegiate Bicycle Race, held annually at West 
Point. 

"We set up an interactive registration program with rosters 
for each school, structured ten heats, sorted all finishing times, 
and provided placement results," notes Monaco proudly. 

Race officials responded with a grant to help add to the 
seminar's hardware arsenal. "We add a component or two 
each year," adds Monaco. "A line printer and speech syn- 
thesis equipment are high on our list." 

Meetings Wind Up with— What Else?— Games. The fifty ca- 
dets in the program pick up hands-on experience with the Ap- 
ples whenever they can manage the free time. And they meet 
together every other Thursday evening for a formal presenta- 
tion by a seminar member or faculty guest, followed by some 
spirited competition at football, battleship, or other computer 
games. 

"We try to take some of the pressure off them," says Mon- 
aco, a 1970 graduate of the academy who recalls the psycho- 
logical burdens of time and academic demands that shape the 
cadet's life. 

The night we attended a Seminar meeting, we entered a 
darkened room to the decidedly unmilitary sight and sounds of 
Musical Kaleidoscope, a six-color light show program that 
keys off the sounds of a tape recorder. 

After ten minutes of that, Joseph Moravec, a fourth termer 
and president of the seminar, presented an equally light-heart- 
ed demonstration of lo-res graphics. His subject matter: a 
Snoopy calendar. "I'll show you how to do it, not how it works. I 
haven't checked that out yet," he confided. 

The main item of business was a carefully planned, il- 
lustrated explanation by Moravec of how to program shape ta- 
bles and load them from memory to disk. The other cadets 
were attentive and full of questions. And Moravec volunteered 
his own assessment of Apple's major strength: "Easy inter-

face with the user — that's what made Apple such a success." 

Stringent Rules for Private Apples. A few cadets have spe- 
cial permission to keep personal Apples in their rooms, no 
small accomplishment at an institution where tradition yields 
as reluctantly as it does at West Point. 

A pioneer in this effort is Alex E. Tetreault, a fourth termer 
or senior from Las Vegas. Turned onto computers for some 
time, Tetreault bought his Apple and a Sprinter 40 miniprinter

in November 1980 and began seeking approval to bring it to the 
academy. He got approval on a couple of conditions: 

1. No audio on his monitor. Cadets cannot have television in 
their rooms. 

2. No computer games except on weekends. "I keep my 
paddles locked in the drawer during the week," says Tetre- 
ault. "But I have lots of company on weekends." 

His Apple doesn't sit idle on weeknights. He uses it as a 
character generator to write papers for class. "And I use it for 
little functions in calculus. It's a big help in finding curves," he 
adds. 

John B. Alumbaugh, a second termer or yearling from Mat- 
ton, IL, knew next to nothing about computers when he ar- 
rived at West Point, but he's turned on now. He's even taken 
his Apple to class with him, a first at the Academy. 

Like Mary's little lamb? Not quite. He used it to present a 
demonstration in military science class. 

Alumbaugh found the cost of paper for his Epson MX-80 
printer was becoming a burden, so he borrowed a page from 
Monaco's book and negotiated a deal. The Protestant Sunday 
School keeps him in paper and he maintains its records and 
keeps it in mailing labels. 




Major Monaco with the two Apples slated for on-site training this summer. 



"I'm working on a program so I can call into the main 
frame," says Alumbaugh, "I hope by spring. And I'm writing 
programs for my dad's ice cream store, for check writing and 
keeping his books." 

What To Expect from Apples Who've Been to Boot Camp. 
The academy operates an electronic bulletin board over chan- 
nel 3 of the local cable television system. It carries calendar 
items, announcements, and other news of general interest to 
Academy personnel and residents of the surrounding com- 
munity. And it is programmed by an Apple II Plus. 

Clearly, Apple's role is expanding all the time at West 
Point. In January, the Cadet Seminar added a Hayes Micro- 
modem II computerized bulletin board to serve as a resting 
place for information about the computer scene. This new 
component, donated by the Mr. Computer store in nearby 
Wappingers Falls, was put into immediate action. 

Apple users interested in buying, selling, or exchanging 
equipment or merely trading ideas with the computer minded 
cadets can do so easily. Just call 914-938-2044 and put your Ap- 
ple on the line. But you'd better warn it first not to be startled 
by being addressed as "sir." HI

THE CURE FOR THE DISLOCATED 

computer... BRaiQoTnroiOT n 

A computer has a knack for speeding the hands of the clock. It's also true, those hours of concentration at the keyboard are most of the fun. 
But an aching back resting on a tired "*" could reduce your creativity and enjoyment. 

The solution. ..the new Basic Comfort II computer desk. Designed by a dedicated computer hobbyist, the Basic Comfort II was built to be a 
pleasurable workhorse. The top accepts the usual peripherals — disk drives, small printer and CRT — and leaves about two square feet 
(15 "x25 ') in front of you for read'n and writ'n and all those good things. The keyboard shelf is 25" above the floor and that places your 
"left arrow" where your fingers like to be. At about 3 in the morning, just slide your Apple forward taking advantage of the "dust cover"' 
feature. 

Proper venting is built in, and your tangled web of ribbon and wires has its own "rat's nest'' area. There's also an inconvenient shelf (actually 
a structural-support-turned-shelf) in the knee hole for those items you don't mind storing in an awkward but accessible location. 
Finished in woodgrain (walnut or light oak) high pressure mica laminate, Basic Comfort II is rugged (70 lbs.) and it looks so good that your 
Apple may find itself in a place of honor. 

Slip into something comfortable for computing. Send $169.00 check or money order, today. (Fla. residents add $6.76 tax.) Mastercharge

When you turn your computer on, the speaker beeps, the 
screen shows the Apple n logo, the disk drive comes to life, the 
disk operating system gets loaded into RAM from whatever 
disk happens to be in your drive, and some program — the so- 
called boot or greeting program on your disk — gets run. What 
does all this mean? In particular, what do we mean when we 
say that the computer "runs a program"? What's a program 
and how do you run one? 

The next few columns are going to be devoted to general 
concepts about programs and programming. We're not going 
to get into programming techniques, since there are several 
columns in this magazine that do a superb job of teaching pro- 
gramming in various languages. Instead, we'll describe the 
different languages available on the Apple and deal with 
notions that apply to programming in any language. 

When your computer is on but apparently in idle, when 
you're looking at that familiar right-hand bracket and your Ap- 
ple appears to be waiting for instructions from you, you're 
actually running a program. That program is called the Ap- 
plesoft Interpreter or the Basic Interpreter. 

There are a good many things you can do while running the 
Basic Interpreter. For example, you can type print 
42*3. 79~sin(. 5/tan(. 15) ) and as soon as you hit return you'll see 
the product of 42 and 3.79 raised to the power of the sine of half 
a radian divided by the tangent of three quarters of a radian, 
expressed to a precision of seven decimal points. From the 
perspective of human experience, this response from the com- 
puter occurs instantaneously. 

But you could accomplish the same thing with many pocket 
calculators. It might be a little more awkward — you might have 
to go through several distinct steps and look at intermediate 
results — but still you could get the same answer in almost the 
same amount of time. So what distinguishes a computer from 
a calculator? 

Putting Three and Three Together. Well, while running 
your Apple's Basic Interpreter, you could also type print "My 
name is Jonathan Apple. " In a flash when you hit return, you'll 
see that sentence— the letters between the quote marks — re- 
peated on your screen. That's something you couldn't do on 
many calculators. 

You could also ask your Apple to print 3 = 3 and you'd get a 
one in reply. The number one in this case is the Basic In- 
terpreter's way of telling you that it has evaluated the proposi- 
tion 3 = 3 and found it true. If you typed print 3> 3, you'd get a 
zero on your screen, meaning 'tain't so. 

The numbers zero and one in response to a proposition like 
3 = 3 are called Boolean values. Your computer has the ability to 
evaluate the truth or falsity of propositions according to the 
rules of what's called Boolean logic, and this capacity enables 
it to make judgments and vary its behavior according to what- 
ever exigencies arise. 

What if you type 10 print 3=3 and hit return? Nothing at all 
happens except you get another Applesoft prompt. When you 
type run and hit return, however, you'll get a one again. 

When you type commands that are not preceded by a num- 
ber, you are said to be using your computer in immediate exe- 



cution ; and you get an immediate response from the comput- 
er. When you precede your order with a number, you are said 
to be operating in the deferred execution mode, so named be- 
cause the order doesn't get carried out until you type run. If, 
before you type run, you have entered several instructions pre- 
ceded by different numbers, they'll all get executed, in as- 
cending order according to the numbers you've given them. 

This activity— typing numbered instructions and executing 
them in sequence with the run command — is what's called pro- 
gramming. Or rather, it's one kind of programming. 

The Proper Ambience. Remember we said that when you 
were looking at the Applesoft prompt you were actually 
running a program called the Applesoft or Basic Interpreter. 
When you run a program in Basic, like our humble little 
10 print 3=3, you're still running the Basic Interpreter. Actual- 
ly, you're running an applications program within the context 
or environment of a systems program. The Basic Interpreter 
is a systems program; the programs you write in Basic and 
the ones you buy on disk to do all sorts of useful, entertaining 
stuff for you are applications programs. 

The Basic Interpreter falls into the general category of sys- 
tems programs called programming languages. That means 
it's a special kind of systems program designed to facilitate the 
writing and execution of applications programs. Other kinds of 
programming languages that can be run on an Apple II in- 
clude Integer Basic, Pascal, Forth, Pilot, Cobol, Microsoft Ba- 
sic, Fortran, Logo, and Lisp. There are others, too. Some of 
these languages require that additional hardware be added to 
the standard Apple II Plus. We'll describe the more popular 
languages and discuss their hardware and software require- 
ments eventually. 

Languages are not the only kind of systems programs. Disk 
operating systems, like DOS 3.2 or DOS 3.3, constitute another 
important category. DOS 3.3 is the system most widely used by 
Apple owners at the moment, although the UCSD Pascal Sys- 
tem is becoming more and more popular and there's a fair- 
sized contingent who run their Apples primarily in an operat- 
ing system called CP/M. 

The function of the disk operating system is to control any 
kind of functioning involving the floppy — or hard — disk drive. 
That includes such things as interpreting and executing com- 
mands to show what files are on the disk, arranging the physi- 
cal layout of data on the disk, creating or deleting files, mov- 
ing files from one place to another, and so on. 

A Basic Working Relationship. If your turn on your ma- 
chine with the DOS 3.3 System Master disk — or another disk 
initialized with DOS 3.3 — in the drive, a body of code making up 
the operating system gets loaded from the disk into memory. 
There it cooperates with the Basic Interpreter. 

Once DOS gets into memory, it acts like a censor reading 
the mail addressed to the Basic Interpreter. It scans every- 
thing you type at the keyboard to see if your messages are in- 
tended for it instead of for the interpreter. So, if you type a 
command like catalog that DOS recognizes as one of its own, 
the Interpreter never sees it; DOS just goes ahead and exe- 
cutes the command. 



88 



tnnnn 



MARCH 1982 



DOS and the Basic Interpreter could be said to work co- 
operatively. DOS gets first priority, but passes on to Basic any 
messages it doesn't recognize. If you don't happen to have a 
disk drive, or if DOS doesn't happen to be in memory, Basic 
will get along fine. It just won't know how to do anything in- 
volving the disk. Type catalog in that situation, for example, 
and you'll be charged with a syntax error. 

As a side point, if you have DOS in memory and you type 
catalogit, you'll get a syntax error message from DOS. The 
operating system will find in the first seven letters of your 
message a match to its own vocabulary, so it will nab the com- 
mand ; then it will complain about those extra keystrokes. If, 
on the other hand, you type catalarge, DOS will look at the 
sixth character, say, "Nope, this ain't mine," and pass the 
word to Basic. Basic will look at it and say, "No friend of mine, 
either" and issue its own error message. When you make a 
syntax error, you can tell who's complaining because Basic 
puts a question mark before the error message and DOS does 
not. 

The situation that prevails with Applesoft or Integer Basic 
and DOS, where the operating system and the language essen- 
tially sit side by side, although the operating system gets the 
first look at incoming mail, is a little unusual. It's more com- 
mon that the operating system is so essential to the language 
that the language won't perform without it. You might say that 
the operating system creates the environment in which the lan- 
guage can function, much as the language creates the en- 
vironment in which your application program can be written 
and run. 

This is one of two reasons why the choice of an operating 
system has so important a bearing on the things you can do 
with your computer. If you want to run Pascal or Apple For- 
tran, you have to have the Pascal operating system. If you 
want to run Microsoft Basic or Microsoft Fortran, you have to 
have CP/M. 

The other reason is that the operating system governs the 
way data is stored on disk. If you want to read a program cre- 



ated under CP/M — in the CP/M environment, as they say— 
and your Apple is expecting to find data on disk laid out in the 
manner of DOS 3.3, you're going to get a plague of I/O errors. 
That's also the reason why the stuff written for Brand X com- 
puter won't run on your Apple. The program for that foreign 
devil may be written in a version of Basic very similar to Ap- 
plesoft, and if you could get it loaded into memory you could 
modify it easily enough to run, but the difference in operating 
systems makes the alien disk unreadable. 

The Power Behind the Throne. There's one other impor- 
tant systems program that affects your everyday activities 
with the Apple, and that's the System Monitor. Most of what 
the Monitor does happens behind the scenes, in a sense ; you 
don't interact with it in quite the same way you do with DOS or 
the Basic Interpreter, unless you happen to write your pro- 
grams in assembly language. 

The Monitor controls your machine from the moment you 
turn it on. It's responsible for that first beep from the speaker, 
the appearance of the Apple's name on the screen, and the 
booting of DOS. Once all that has been accomplished, the Moni- 
tor passes control over to the partnership of DOS and the Ba- 
sic Interpreter, but it remains at the ready, available on com- 
mand. All you have to do is execute a call -151 command from 
Basic and the Monitor's asterisk prompt will appear. 

The Monitor's functions can be broken down roughly into 
two categories. First, it provides a tool for manipulating 
memory. When you're talking to the Monitor — that is, when 
you're looking at that asterisk prompt — you can inspect the 
contents of any location in the Apple's 65,536-byte range of 
memory addresses. You can put any value between 0 and 255 
into any of the first 48K of addresses (you can't alter the upper 
16K because those addresses are located in ROM) , and you can 
move large sections of memory from one set of addresses to 
another. 

So the Monitor provides a tool for the direct manipulation of 
the contents of memory. You can also inspect and manipulate 
memory from Basic, via peek and poke statements, but it's

less convenient to do it that way ; in Basic you can only read or 
write to one address at a time. 

The other aspect of the Monitor's function is the introduc- 
tory one; it provides a library of routines that perform rudi- 
mentary operations — things like beeping the speaker, putting 
characters on the screen, clearing the screen, and so on. If 
these routines were not available as a prepackaged body of in- 
structions permanently stored in the Apple, a programmer 
would have to re-create the code every time he wanted to do 
one of these fundamental operations. Even the Basic Inter- 
preter uses the Monitor; when you execute a Basic command 
like home, the Interpreter momentarily passes control of the 
machine over to a certain portion of the Monitor program, 
which clears the screen and returns control to the Interpreter. 

So now it appears that when you run a program in Apple- 
soft you've got an applications program running in the context 
of a language program with the cooperation and support of 
both a disk operating system and a system Monitor. All of 
these things— applications program, language, operating sys- 
tem, Monitor — can properly be called programs. So what's a 
program? 

A program is a set of instructions to the 6502. So what's an 
instruction? 

What 6502 Means to You. While your computer is on, the 
6502 is constantly scanning its range of memory addresses, 
fetching the contents of memory locations into its own internal 
registers— holding areas — and examining those contents. 
Each memory location holds an eight-bit binary number. 
Some of those binary numbers have the effect of causing the 
6502 to perform some action; these numbers are called op- 
codes, operands, or just instructions. 

The fact that a certain binary number — a certain pattern of 
ones and zeros held by a memory address — causes the 6502 to 
do something it wouldn't otherwise do is determined by the 
structure, or architecture, of the microprocessor. To say it 
another way, the instruction set of the microprocessor is hard- 



wired into the chip. 

The kind of things that the opcodes tell the 6502 to do are 
very elementary — things like load a certain value or the con- 
tents of a specified memory location into one of the internal 
registers, add the contents of two registers, or compare two 
values. Nothing here so complicated as the Basic print 
statement. 

All the simple things, in fact, that we take for granted from 
our computers have to get broken down into myriad rudimen- 
tary steps. The 6502 only does one miniscule thing at a time; of 
course, it does those things in a great hurry, and that's its prin- 
cipal value to us. 

Adding two and three and putting the results on the screen 
would be done in something like the following manner: the 
value two would be loaded into one of the 65Q2's registers. Then 
the value three would be loaded into another register. Then the 
contents of the two registers would be added, and the sum 
would be deposited back into one of those two registers. Final- 
ly the contents of that register would be copied into the appro- 
priate address in the area of memory that governs text output 
to the screen. 

Each of these steps would have to be ordered up by its own 
opcode. And the values two and three would also have to be 
somewhere in memory where the 6502 could find them. 

This raises another question. Memory contains both in- 
structions and the values upon which instructions are carried 
out— both operands and data. How does the 6502 distinguish be- 
tween them? 

It tells by context. When the processor reads the instruc- 
tion 00100000 (hex 20) , for example, it knows that the following 
two bytes of memory will hold not another instruction but, 
rather, the data on which opcode 00100000 is to be carried out. 
Those next two bytes are sometimes said to comprise the argu- 
ment for opcode 00100000. Some opcodes require no argument; 
others take one byte, and still others, like 00100000, require two. 
The processor knows which is which. It also knows — by keep- 
ing track of what it's doing — when 00100000 is not an opcode at 
all, but a datum or argument for some other opcode. 

Getting back to the question of what a program is, one way 
to answer would be to say that a program is the sum of all the 
opcodes and arguments in memory at any given time— in 
other words the entire contents of memory. By this kind of defi- 
nition there could be only one program in memory at a time, 
and, in fact, from the 6502's point of view, that's exactly the 
case. 

Class Distinctions. Since the Monitor, the operating sys- 
tem, the interpreter, and your applications program are func- 
tionally and conceptually — to human minds — distinct, it's 
customary to consider them as separate, cooperative pro- 
grams. And, in normal speech, the word is used only to desig- 
nate your applications program — the set of code that's actual- 
ly doing some useful work for you. 

Instructions and data that are put into the computer's 
memory by you, either by your writing a program or by your 
loading one in from disk or tape, are called software. The im- 
plication is that they are temporary residents of memory and 
are not essential to the functioning of your computer. DOS is 
also a piece of software, since you have to load it in from disk. 

The System Monitor and Applesoft Interpreter, on the other 
hand, belong to a different class of programs, called firm- 
ware. What's firm about them is that they are permanent resi- 
dents of memory, so long as you don't pull out or physically 
alter the eight ROM chips on your motherboard. It's possible to 
have other programs in firmware as well; you can buy a ROM 
card to sit in one of your peripheral slots, and you can get 
equipment that will burn your favorite programs into ROM 
chips that you can then plug into that board. 

The term hardware is reserved for the physical com- 
ponents of your system— the chips and connecting circuitry. 
By extension you could also refer to the processor's micro- 
code—the set of primitive instructions that govern its activi- 
ty—as hardware, since those instructions are determined by 
the physical architecture of the processor chip. JM

THE LOWER CASE ADAPTER 



and put lower case on the screen 
WITHOUT HARDWARE. 



THEN WE GOT RID OF 
THE 80 COLUMN BOARD 




and put seventy columns of text on the screen t 
WITHOUT HARDWARE. 



THEN WE GOT RID OF 
WASTED EDITING TIME 

by developing printer spooling 
AGAIN WITHOUT HARDWARE! 




AND WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR 
NEW WAYS TO SAVE YOU TIME AND MONEY. 




When ON-LINE SYSTEMS began work on SUPERSCRIBE II, we wanted to make it the 
most powerful word processor on the market. We began by putting in boldfacing, 
underlining, form letter capabilities, global search and replace, support of multiple disk 
drives, full macro capabilities, generation of up to four indices, complete formatting 
capabilities, a software based keyboard buffer, full editing capability of any DOS 3.3 text 
or binary file (including APPLESOFT programs) and all other features you need for professional word processing. That was just the 
beginning. . . . 

Our next step was to make SUPERSCRIBE II hardware independent, so we eliminated the lower case adapter and the 80 column 
board. SUPERSCRIBE II is the only word processor on the market to offer true software based lower case and a 70 column screen 
available today. 

The move that put us over the top was the introduction of printer spooling" 1 which allows you to do your editing while printing, 
making your word processing time more efficient. 

With SUPERSCRIBE II, we've added all the features you need, did away with all the problems you can do without, and we did it all at 
a price that you can afford-$ 129.95. 

'Printer spooling feature only available for printers with APPLE parallel or SSM AIO interface, and EPSON printers/APPLE II and APPLE II Plus are registered trade 
marks of APPLE COMPUTER INC. 

We Don't Think That Word Processing Should Cost An Arm And A Leg, 
And At On-Line Systems, We Won't Stand For It.

WE'RE BUILDING UP SPEED 




A recent article in "INTERFACE AGE" tested 45 of the most 
used BASICs on 48 different microcomputers. That article 
judged that if you are an APPLE owner writing programs in 
APPLESOFT, you have the nineteenth fastest BASIC/com- 
puter combination tested.* 

-THAT WAS BEFORE EXPEDITER II- 

If you're an APPLE owner with EXPEDITER II writing 
programs in APPLESOFT, you can now have your BASIC 
program judged second in the same comparison - with a 
minimum of effort. You need only LOAD your program, BRUN 
EXPEDITER, then save your program. 

EXPEDITER II is a new programming utility which translates 
your APPLESOFT programs into machine language, usually on 
the first try. Problem spots in the code are flagged during 
compilation. The new compiled code supports all the features of 
APPLESOFT including HI-RES graphics, shape tables, LO- 
RES graphics, defined functions and DOS commands. 
EXPEDITER II is the only compiler to support global string 
variables easily. There is no additional BASIC syntax to learn. 
The only real difference you'll notice with the new program is 
that it's faster - usually two to twenty times faster. 

Other APPLESOFT compilers are available for the 
APPLE, but none have all the features of EXPEDITER II. 
EXPEDITER II, with its new MEMORY COMPRESSION 
OPTION can reduce your compiled program size by up to 50 
percent. (Remember: a machine language program is normally 
bigger than a BASIC program that does the same thing). It's also 
compatible with MMS II** to help you solve any memory 
problems you might encounter. 



The race has just begun 

We make your compilation process easier by providing a 
symbol table and address listings for each line of your BASIC 
program. EXPEDITER II even allows you to reserve areas for 
machine language subprograms or graphics. Debugging is 
facilitated by EXPEDITER lis support of the Applesoft TRACE 
command. 

We at ON-LINE SYSTEMS believe that the APPLE II is a 
powerful machine, and we're constantly trying to make it better 
and easier to use. Thats why we offer a full line of utilities written 
by some of the best programmers in the field. The only limits we 
feel the APPLE should have, are the limits to your imagination.

THE 

GENERAL MANAGER 

THE SHORT CUT TO YOUR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT NEEDS 




• Easy to use— Simply design the screens you wish to use for data entry. Your 
database is created automatically. 



• Information may be retrieved such as: list all customers who owe over 
$1,000 with an invoice over 30 days old or who owe over $10,000 dollars. 



• APPLESOFT interface provides complete access to your information and 
allows you to tailor THE GENERAL MANAGER to YOUR needs. 



• Expand your database at any time with no loss of existing data. 

• Easy to use reporting capability provides automatic formatting and totals. 

• Easily sort the entire database or selected portions for reporting. 

• Full range of calculation capabilities including logical operations. 

• Your database can span over one hundred disketts using one to four drives 
or a hard disk. 



• Selected fields from selected records can be written to a standard text file 



Some database programs let you perform calculations so you can 
easily handle economic projections, sales forecasting, and cost 
accounting. Other database programs give you a wide range of 
search and selection options so you can find the information you 
need to make daily decisions. Still others format the screen for 
easy data entry so anyone can use the database. But now, one 
database program PUTS IT ALL TOGETHER. 

THE GENERAL MANAGER is designed after large mainframe 
database management programs. The hierarchial structure allows 
up to sixteen unique record formats which interrelate to form the 
total database. You design the screens the way you want them 
and then fill them in. It's just like working with a set of blank 
forms. Information from one screen can be automatically used in 
other screens. Any fields can be used in complex calculations to 
figure costs, interest, payment terms, discount rates, recipe 
proportions, and many more applications. The data built on one 
screen may easily be used to make comparisons or build totals on 
another screen. 

THE GENERAL MANAGER provides easy-to-use APPLESOFT 
interface using the ampersand command which allows user 
programs to read, write, update and delete database records. 
Uses for this interface are limited only by your imagination. In 
addition, using your selection criteria, THE GENERAL MANAGER 
can write selected fields of selected records to a standard DOS 
text file to be used by word processors or other existing 
programs. 

Visa, MasterCard, Check, COD 



With THE GENERAL MANAGER you are never stuck with your 
original database format. You may change the length and type of 
fields, add and delete fields and add entirely new screens at any 
time with no loss of existing data. As your needs change The 
GENERAL MANAGER will change with you. The unique access 
method of The GENERAL MANAGER allows your database to 
span over 100 diskettes using from one to four disk drives or a 
hard disk while at the same time using the minimum amount of 
disk storage to store your data. The GENERAL MANAGER has 
the flexibility to handle a recipe file or an entire business system. 

A complete tutorial and reference manual leads you through the 
many uses of The GENERAL MANAGER and presents a number 
of solid applications. 

THE GENERAL MANAGER is designed to work FOR you. You 
mold it to your operation and it gives you the information you 
need, when you need it, in just about any format you want it. 

THE GENERAL MANAGER, a database management program 
that finally BRINGS IT ALL TOGETHER for only $99.95 

THE GENERAL MANAGER runs on any 48K Apple II or II Plus with single or 
multiple disk drives and is available at your local computer store or order direct by

Unless otherwise noted, all products can be assumed to run on

Zork II. Sequels in microcomputing entertainment have, for 
the most part, escaped the fate of their counterparts in film 
and literature. Perhaps the relevant question about Zork II, 
however, is not how it managed to equal and possibly even sur- 
pass its predecessor, but how either Zork or Zork II managed 
to stand alone. 

That's because Zork, Zork II, and the expected Zork III are 
children of the mainframe Zork, a single adventure that's been 
cleverly cleavered by Infocom into three parts in order to fit on 
the microcomputer. 

Regardless of its past or its predecessor, Zork II is a de- 
light to play. A text adventure, it is of the high quality, logic- 
loyal wing of that genre, populated only by such gems as the 
original Adventure, Zork, and Cyborg. Where Cyborg 
reached — and retains — the mountaintop in terms of plot and in- 
tegration of player with adventure, Zork II joins Zork as the ul- 
timate in text adventuring technique and communication. 

The people at Infocom clearly do not like to speak in mono- 
syllables and two-word phrases, and they don't expect you to 
either. Both Zorks will listen to anything you have to say, and, 
as long as you obey one or two Zorkal rules of grammar (no 
complex sentences, no conditionals, for example) , they're like- 
ly to understand you. 

You can tell Zork, "Get the box, the bucket, the pearls and 
the globe then open the box then examine the box and the 
bucket. Walk north then tell the robot 'Push the round button 
then walk south.' Walk south. What is a grue?" You'll end up 
with all the things you requested, in the same room where you 
started, having been north to fetch the robot, who will have 
pushed the proper button. And you'll know what a grue is, for 
whatever that's worth. 

Little things are convenient in Infocom 's games. For ex- 
ample, the Apple editing diamond has not been disabled, so if

The plot in Zork . . . isn't. Or at least it's peripheral. A story 
it's got, but it's mostly a series of loosely connected events. 
Some relate to each other, but many are there just for the puz- 
zles they afford and the general flavor they add to the adven- 
ture. None is out of place, and they're superior puzzles yet all 
very logical. 

Where Zork -the-first was very reminiscent of the original 
Adventure, Zork II somehow escapes the mold. It is fresh and 
interesting. Yet the conquerer of Zork will recognize land- 
marks from time to time. As in Zork, the adventurer can't de- 
pend entirely on shank's mare. There's no raft in Zork II; look 
for a means of travel far more esoteric. 

You do not need to have played Zork to play Zork II; but, if 
you haven't, you're apt to want to pick up the first Zork after 
the fact. n(T

Photar. By Steve Baker. It's been a very long time in micro- 
computer industry terms since Softape, one of the first two 



publishers of software for Apples, published a really good 
game. In the old days, Softape had Bob Bishop, whose experi- 
mental games seemed eons ahead of anyone else graphically. 
But Bishop left Softape, and technique caught up with Bishop, 
and Softape faded. Bill Depew's Apple-21 kept them going; 
then the word processor Magic Window, from their sister com- 
pany Artsci, made them well. But new games died and old 
ones, well enough executed, just weren't what people wanted 
anymore. 

Steve Baker had published much through Softape. His Mi- 
crogammon 2.0 is still one of the two best backgammon 
games on the market by far and the most fun to manipulate, 
but backgammon is not the rage it was a year or two ago. Now, 
gamers want fast action, arcade-style, in the home-type 
games. Baker began trying, but the extra spark that makes a 
hit was never quite there. He kept trying, and so did Softape, 
never quite giving up on each other. 

Photar may be the payoff. It's fast, it's active, it's varied, 
it's fun. 

The game is best played with a joystick, letting your space 
ship move throughout the bottom third of the playing area. 
Throughout the area are stationary meteorites that you can de- 
stroy with several shots. Groups of — what? stars? Saturn's 
rings? who cares? — enemies float in, breaking formation to 
weave down one row at a time to collide with and kill you. 
These are little, pesty creatures who can hide behind the me- 
teors and appear from behind new, low-hanging meteors just 
above you. If they do make it to the bottom, move up— they'll

turn around and start weaving toward the top in the same way. 
When you shoot them, they become meteors. 

Far more dangerous are the black holes that fly in erratic 
patterns at crazlly varying speeds, always in the same area 
you're limited to. They are after you, one at a time, and they're 
very hard to avoid. They're also worth good points if you can 
get them. From time to time, what appears to be the mother- 
ship of the meteors streaks down from the top, always at an an- 
gle. If you don't shoot it, it's apt to leave a path of meteors be- 
hind it all the way to the bottom. 

Finally, a harmless object crosses the upper screen every 
so often, usually well guarded. This fellow is worth 1,000 
points; but paying attention to shooting him often results in 
wipeout by black hole. 

With all this going on, Photar is a very active game. The 
graphics are well animated color hi-res, and the sounds, which 
can be turned off, are loud and brassy and appropriate. 

Photar has only one fault, and it's a quality the author and 
publishers thought of as a feature. You get only one ship per 
game. When you're hit, you're killed. That's that. 

If you can live with having only one ship per, and you like 
home-arcade shoot- 'em-ups, you're apt to have a good time 
with Photar. ~ ^ MCT

Conglomerates Collide. By Paul Mason, Louis R. Mayne, and 
Robert E. Siegling. As a first product from a new company, 
Conglomerates Collide is outstanding; the care and quality 
that obviously went into its making promise good things from 
the Arizonans whose name sounds like a Scottish thane. 

A game of business simulation, Conglomerates is more 
simply executed than many similar board games and than 
Strategic Simulations' Cartels and Cutthroats. Each turn rep- 
resents a full year, for instance, and the only influence you 
have over the sort of company you control is its name. This 
doesn't matter, however, since the product of your imaginary

For one full year, many of you have been wondering how long we would con- 
tinue sending you Softalk free without trying to put the touch on you for some- 
thing, whether a subscription, software, peripherals, kidney beans, defective 
grommets, or spare Edsel parts. Now comes the magic moment. 

Softalk commissioned graphics artist Robert Zraick to do August's cover 
with a poster in mind. The robot contemplating a bite is evocative both of Ro- 
din's The Thinker and the Genesis passage on the Garden of Eden . . . not to 
mention the possible significance to our favorite technological fruit. 

The artist and Softalk are sharing in the profits from the poster. Softalk will 
distribute its proceeds to individuals developing Apple tools to help the handi- 
capped. Softalk guarantees 100 percent distribution of its monies. 

In addition to the posters, which are being sold at $6.00, (plus $1.50 to cover 
shipping and handling), two hundred artist's proofs, signed by Robert Zraick, 
are available at $75 each. 

The size of the poster is 24 inches by 34 inches. The artist's proof will be hand- 
numbered and hand-signed and be accompanied by a certificate giving its num- 
ber and guaranteeing that only 200 are being distributed. 

Robert Zraick's art will grace any computer room, and your purchase will 
help others become more self-sufficient.

company is irrelevant anyway. 

What you do control are mergers and acquisitions, whether 
to accept offered loans, when to pay off loans, and the pur- 
chase and sale of your company's stock. Factors are the prime 
interest rate, rate of interest on investment, and price-earn- 
ings ratio of the company. 

All these things affect your personal equity. For instance, if 
your company acquires a subsidiary, the stock value rises and 
so does your equity. But to become truly rich, you'll have to sell 
stock so you can acquire more valuable subsidiaries, thus rais- 
ing the stock value sharply. But, when you sell stock, you lose 
personal equity. Consequently, you can have the most suc- 
cessful company by far and lose the game because it ends be- 
fore you've bought back your stock — or because you can't af- 
ford to buy it back. 

Random events affect the world situation — the prime inter- 
est rate most obviously. Individualized, apparently random 
events affect individual players. 

Don't let the simplicity fool you. This is a difficult game to 
win, at least against the opponents provided on computer by 
RockRoy in the computer- play mode. 

There are two other modes: Solitaire and Collide. Solitaire 
actually allows as many as four players, but it is limited to fif- 
teen year-turns and is designed for trying out strategies and 
learning. 

Collide requires two players and can have as many as four. 
Here the game is limited only by the number of companies 
available to be acquired. The game ends at the end of the 
round during which the last company is claimed. 

Conglomerates Collide excels among games of this genre 
in its visual bells and whistles. It opens with a full color hi-res 
screen of a businessman with briefcase rushing from a heli- 
copter on a rooftop. Along with gathering players' names and 
company names, it asks each player to choose a headquarters 
location from a list of twenty world cities. Then, as each play- 
er's turn begins, a city skyline appears with the appropriate

Bez-MX. The theory of deterrents has held off a nuclear holo- 
caust to date and allowed for costly defense projects in this 
country like the MX missile system and B-l bomber. Many peo- 
ple wonder if the complex guidance systems in modern missiles 
would perform properly in the event of an actual war. Many 
people also wonder if the proposed MX deployment plan, in- 
volving underground silos with interconnecting transportation 
rails, is really a good way to fool the enemy. 

Games are never meant to mimic reality completely and 
war games are no exception to this rule. Nonetheless, in a good 
war game you can at least partially make the decisions that 
might face a general or commander in real combat. Usually 
this involves laying down a strategy against an opponent and 
watching that strategy succeed or fail, as the case may be. 

Bez-MX can be played in several different ways, mostly 
limited by whether or not you have game paddles. In the soli- 
taire version, it's you against the computer as you try to de- 
fend your country against attack while attempting to destroy 
the enemy's ability to wage war. 

You start with eight MX missiles deployed in silos around 
your country. During each round, you can either move them or 
launch them. You are given two B-l bombers and the option of 
one mission per round. The B-l can either defend your terri- 
tory or bomb your opponent's territory. After each round, you 
are given two bonus MX missiles, if your factory is still intact 
enough to make them. 

Bez-MX comes with a playing map that is a grid with x and 
y coordinates. You enter the coordinates of the enemy terri- 
tory you want bombed or hit by a missile. The missiles tend not 



to be as accurate as the B-l bomber, unless you launch several 
at a time, blanketing an area. In the solitaire version, after en- 
tering the strategy commands you just sit back and watch the 
battle unfold. A quick eye and good memory are needed, since 
the battle itself might be over in fifteen seconds. During the 
battle is the only time you can see the effect your missiles and 
bombs are having on the enemy. 

In the solitaire version of Bez-MX, the computer makes for 
a tough but not unbeatable opponent. Getting through more 
than ten rounds is an indication that you are getting good at it, 
though this is truly a game where you can win the battle and 
lose the war. It's a good warm-up for the advanced two-player 
version. 

In the advanced version of Bez-MX, it's possible to make 
real-time changes in your strategy through the use of game 
paddles. You do this by controlling the precise instant that mis- 
sile launches occur by using the paddle button to launch them. 
With the paddle you can also vary the flight of your B-l bomb- 
er along the y coordinate when it is defending. This makes it 
possible to intercept missiles and enemy bombers. 

Similarly, being able to launch the missiles when you 
choose^llows you to intercept enemy bombers (or at least try 
to, since the B-l destroys 85 to 90 percent of all missiles it 
comes in contact with) . 

In the advanced version, you also have the headache of de- 
termining how to utilize the population. You have to delegate 
so many people to farming, working in the cities, working at 
the airfield, working at the MX missile site, and, most impor- 
tant, working in the factory where the MX missiles are manu- 
factured. If you misjudge the percentage of population that 
should be working at a given task, you find yourself in trouble. 

There is scoring in Bez-MX to determine who wins, though 
a low score does not necessarily indicate a badly played 
game. It is easy to rack up points bombing cities and farms, 
but destroying the more crucial things like the runway and fac- 
tory are what help you win the game. 



Why you need The Inspector. 



If you're serious about programming, you need 
to set all your utilities together in one place — 
inside your Apple. The Inspector comes on an 
Eprom that simply plugs into the D8 socket, or on 
a disk ready to merge with Integer Basic for 
automatic loading on boot. Either way, it stays at 
your fingertips, ready to call without disturbing 
your current program. 

The Inspector puts you in total control of both 
memory and disks. You can search forward 
and backwards, edit, read nibbles, 
map disk space, dump the screen 
to a printer, examine every secret 
of your Apple. Use The Inspector 
to repair blown disks, undelete 
files, input "illegal" commands, 




read and alter files, locate strings in memory or on 
disk. The uses are endless. The manual, alone, is an 
education. And it's always there when you need it. 

You need the most powerful disk and memory 
utility available for your Apple. You need the 
Inspector.

The hi-res graphics are interesting but not very spectacu- 
lar; although crucial to the two-player version, they are not the 
chief attraction of the game by any standards. The sound ef- 
fects are also negligible and don't add much to the game. 

If you can find someone who doesn't mind pretending 
they're Dr. Strangelove, the two-player version of Bez-MX 
makes for a pretty good game. It is not as long or involved as a 
board game like Risk, but it provides the same kind of thrill. 
You risk all to gain everything and, if you lose, all you've real- 
ly lost is an hour or two. 

Unfortunately, real life is rarely so innocuous. It would be 
nice if there were only games, but the sad truth is that we all 
live in very dangerous times. If only the leaders of great na- 
tions could solve their differences with the help of a computer 
game, instead of with the lives of real people.

tion book and requires an Apple II plus with 48K and one 13 or

Suicide. By Steve Hawley. In the beginning, there was New- 
ton's Third Law of Motion. Then there was video Pong. This 
evolved into Breakout, but that got buried beneath the thun- 
dering herd of Pac-Man/ Asteroids/Space Invaders progeny 
that have since shaped the course of computer arcade game 
history. 

But now there is a game that goes back to the beginning, 
takes the basic Pong concept, and actually does something 
unique with it, turning the attack-and-destroy arcade gestalt 
into one of defense and protection. Suicide involves no lasers, 
phasers, blasters, alien hordes, or threats to one's continued ex- 
istence. Instead, the gamer must prevent an inexhaustible 
population of little pink lemminglike beings from leaping hap- 
pily to their deaths. Intent on making little pink lumps of them- 
selves at the bottom of the screen, they are manifestly an- 
noyed when you save them with your paddle and bounce them 



back to the top, from which they immediately try again. 

There are tricks: if you save a single-antenna creature you 
lose a lot of points : they are defectives— they're supposed to 
die. (Here, the issue of selective breeding and genetic selec- 
tion presents the potential for some lively discussions around 
the keyboard.) Make sure never to miss the ones falling head- 
first; they were evidently pushed, and are not happy. Saving 
them rewards you with bonus points. 

Paddles offer more control, but the joystick is faster, a fac- 
tor you will appreciate at the higher levels. Scoring factors are 
intricate and interdependent; you are timed, with a maxi- 
mum allowable casualty count at each level. Each little pong- 
person you save is ten points ; each one who goes splat is mi- 
nus ten. 

The expressions on their faces are the most intriguing part 
of the game. The rudiments of character (happy /sad), the 
moral ambiguity of the whole situation (these guys want to 
die) , the tension inherent in having responsibility for so many 
lives ; of having to choose between plummeting bods on either 
side, knowing you can save one but never reach the other in 
time . . . this, rather than more meanies and bigger explo- 
sions rendered in greater detail, is the kind of sophistication 
that arcade-type games should now strive for. 

The game is interesting. And different. It figures that it 
would take a return to the roots, arcadewise, to produce a 
unique and involving game from the most simple physical 
premise. A(

hand accordingly. 

Where McKee parts company with Thorpe and most of 
Thorpe's followers Is that he doesn't advocate the correlation 
of the running count with the number of cards remaining in the 
dealer's hand or shoe. Thus a count of +5, say, has the same 
implication for strategy whether there are twenty cards re- 
maining to be played or five and a half decks. Since a true 
measure of the deck's eccentricity — its favorability or unfa- 
vorability for the player — has to consider the number of cards 
remaining, and since most casinos now play multiple-deck 
games, this seems like a crucial point. 

The Count offers a single-player hi-res game of blackjack, 
with a number of rules options. You can specify the number of 
decks, whether the dealer deals to the bottom card or shuffles 
after 75 percent of the cards have been played, the permissible 
hands for doubling down, and so on. If you like, the program 
will coach you on the counting technique and strategy. At your 
discretion it will reveal the current count value and the appro- 
priate play. 

The program will also teach a beginning player the basic 
strategy of the game — the best possible play without counting 
cards. If you master the basic strategy you've got almost even 
odds against the casinos. 

There's an automatic mode in which the computer plays 
against itself. This feature allows you to run the program all 
night or longer and test the effectiveness of its counting ap- 
proach. In auto mode, The Count modulates its betting by the 
following scheme: at zero or negative counts, it bets one unit; 
from zero to +1.5 it bets five, from +2 to 2.5 it bets 25, and at 
higher values it goes to 50, 75, and 100 betting units. Here again, 
the tactics advocated seem a little unrealistic. Such huge bet- 
ting increases run the risk of disastrous short-term losses, even 
though they pay off big if the bankroll holds out. 

One appealing feature of the automatic mode is that it 
keeps a record of how the player has fared at various count lev- 
els ; it keeps a running score of the number of bets won or lost 
at unfavorable, even, and favorable conditions. It also keeps 

— FROM ■■n 



track of the total number of hands played in a given run. It 
would be nice if it also recorded the high and low values of the 
player's stake for a given run; that way, you could test the 
probability of your going broke on a streak of bad luck. 0

don't pay enough attention to them, to paraphrase Bell) and 
Fall of the House of Usher, which promises, according to title 
and blurb, to be a pre- Victorian gothic horror mystery. Usher 
is not what it promises — the graphics were state of the art two 
years ago and the mystery is meaningless — and Oregon Trail 
is not available yet. But the ideas are terrific, and they are 
Bell's forte. 

John Bell has another forte. His full-color, full-scene hi-res 
graphics are computer paintings, not cartoons. Coming upon 
one will startle and delight you. They are so well done that you 
soon cease to mind that the majority of screens contain only in- 
dicative outline hi-res graphics and that some places — such as 
desert — are indicated by lack of graphics altogether. 

In Crystalware's most ambitious offering to date, Fantasy- 
land 2041 A.D., Bell shows yet one more exciting quality: the 
ability to think big and be undaunted by the scope of the task of 
implementing his thoughts. Fantasyland consists of three two- 
sided disks, one side for each place you need to traverse to fin- 
ish the game; and each place comprises around sixty-four 
screens, six to ten of which are Bell's full-screen art work.

HOW MUCH ARE YOU WORTH? 



An interesting question and, in these financially turbulent 
times, an important one. Surprisingly, most people do not, ex- 
cept in a general sense, know the answer. 

Although most would agree that it is necessary and impor- 
tant to plan for their financial future, few have taken the time 
to take the first step. Taking that first step requires determin- 
ing, with some degree of accuracy, exactly what is one's cur- 
rent financial situation. This is accomplished by further deter- 
mining how much income is coming in and how it is being 
spent. "THE HOME ACCOUNTANT" is designed to 
facilitate that very important first step.

All that talent and creativity would seem to be a good basis 
for superior software ; but somewhere along the way, some- 
thing has gone wrong. Attention to detail appears not to have 
existed in the programming cycle. Where detail was consid- 
ered in gaming values, it has not always been weighed care- 
fully against playability. For example, while most screens 
have only the barest indications of the kind of terrain you're in, 
your character's ease of movement varies according to the ter- 
rain, so that crossing the desert is fast, but moving through a 
screen on which mountains are indicated is drudgery, because 
acceptance of keyboard input is delayed. 

In our numerous attempts to play Fantasyland, the 3.2 Ap- 
ple version currently available at this writing, the game found 
numerous ways to end. It variously went off into space with 
frozen keyboard, froze the player character in one screen 
where he could move freely within that screen and everything 
else worked but he could not move to another location, and 
aborted in the midst of saving. 

Within play, some bugs hinder and some help. Hostile char- 
acters blocking the way occasionally disappear in spirit only, 
while their images become inanimate obstacles on the screen. 
Although it's suggested that you speed up movement by hold- 
ing down the repeat key, the occurrence of random events is 
not equipped to stop your extra input from being read and thus 
takes the keystroke ahead that repeat gives you as rejection of 
whatever was being offered. Inputting a minus figure in the 
buying sequence in the market enables you to sell goods at full 
price instead of at the partial price you would get in the selling 
sequence. 

The 3.3 version Crystalware sent Softalk turned out to be a 
preliminary set of disks, seemingly not yet tested. Bell blamed 
industrial sabotage as the cause of their unfinished state. 

John Bell's programs hold the promise of being larger- 
than-life games of the Clardy /Automated Simulations genre. 
What Bell needs is a patient, benevolent, detail-oriented Ap- 
ple-programming partner who is willing to hone and polish 



Bell's rough creations. 

Until he gets such a person or the equivalent, Fantasyland 
2041 A.D. remains an appetizing but undigestible fruit. fl(T

Special Effects, by Mark Pelczarski and David Lubar, Pen- 
guin Software (Box 432, West Chicago, IL 60185; 312-231-0912). 
As if the Complete Graphics System were not complete 
enough, Penguin has augmented that earlier utility with this 
new bag of tricks. Actually, while Special Effects can be used 
as a complement to the Complete system, it also has a great 
deal to offer as a standalone item. 

The painting module allows you to make pictures by ma- 
nipulating a set of "brushes" with game paddles or joystick. 
Joystick is recommended, since diagonal movement is hard to 
control with the paddles. The brushes are shapes that can be 
edited with a subprogram of the Complete Graphics System, 
should you have that package as well. 

Like its predecessor, Special Effects offers a set of 108 com- 
posite hi-res colors. At any point while drawing, you can step 
out of the painting module and examine the palette ; the pro- 
gram uses the second hi-res page to display the color options, 
sixteen at a time. The painting module also has routines that 
allow you to double or quadruple a portion of your drawing and 
edit it point by point. 

The second major program subdivision, called appropri- 
ately the graphics tricks module, lets you flip your picture up- 
side down or flop it left to right. Or, you can produce a mirror 
image of half of it onto the other half. There are also routines to

transfer some or all of a picture from one hl-res page to the 
other, or to copy a portion of a picture from one screen loca- 
tion to another. 

Like those of the Complete system, the Special Effects 
tricks are designed to be available to your own programs, and 
the documentation offers sample code to show you how to use 
them. 

Particularly handy in that regard are the packing and un- 
packing routines. These permit the saving of pictures on disk 
in less than the usual thirty- four sectors. The compaction is 
made possible by a storage technique that codes patterns in 
the picture instead of saving the screen bit by bit. 

Finally, Special Effects includes a conversion facility that 
will rename pictures to match the conventions of the Com- 
plete Graphics System and — handier still — will let you trans- 
late character fonts from Apple's DOS Toolkit or various Syn- 
ergistic Software products into the format employed by Pen- 
guin's Complete package. For paddles or joystick, $39.95; for 
graphics tablet, $69.95. 

□ Neutrons, Level-10 (Box 21187, Denver, CO 80221 ; 303-426- 
6090). Neutrons is the latest entry in the pinball category of 
games for the Apple. Played with a keyboard or paddles, it in- 
corporates some elements of bumper pool, with the added 
challenge of a moving trap that swallows the ball. 

Hitting the return button covers up the trap for a few sec- 
onds, while controlling the bumpers is accomplished by push- 
ing the buttons on the paddle or using the A key and the left ar- 
row key. You've got ten neutrons in a game and if you keep one 
on screen long enough it splits in two, making it doubly diffi- 
cult. 

Neutrons is not a hard game to master; after an hour of 
playing, it should not be hard to get a score in the hundreds of 
thousands. The color graphics and animation are fairly stan- 
dard as are the sound effects. Neutrons allows up to four play- 
ers, taking turns. $29.95. 

□ Roach Hotel, by Mike Livesay, Micro Lab (2310 Skokie Val- 
ley Road, Highland Park, IL 60035; 312-433-7550). Keep telling 
yourself: "It's only a computer game. . . ." They know you're 



alone . . . don't go in the kitchen . . . and all manner of other po- 
tential subtitles which present themselves to the imagination. 

Yes, the bugs are back. There probably isn't going to be 
much middle-ground of opinion on Roach Hotel. Past or pres- 
ent residents of aging apartment buildings may take a sort of 
vicarious satisfaction from it, or they may grow pale and turn 
away, shaking uncontrollably. Anyone who has experienced a 
midnight encounter with a hardy representative of the planet's 
oldest surviving species suddenly spotlighted on the linoleum 
knows that the experience carries with it a unique and primal 
sensation, which one may not care to repeat voluntarily. 

Roach Hotel voluntarily repeats it. Your foot is located at 
the top of the screen, poised to discourage the roach incursion 
from reaching the hotel in the center. The hotel is a multi-story 
A-frame, which allows for some nifty bank shots as you drop 
your shoe on the roof, letting it slide out and down to your in- 
tended target below. 

The foot/roach interface is the major "effect" of the game, 
and it was obviously a programming labor of love. Love takes 
many forms. 

You have several species to contend with, each worth dif- 
ferent point scores, but all proceeding inexorably toward their 
single goal, bringing to mind, in manner and appearance, an 
enemy aircraft silhouette identification drill. Most are neither 
fast nor dangerous. The spiders go for your foot but are easily 
avoided if you don't want to try for extra points. This, how- 
ever, gives you virtually no chance of ultimately prevailing. 
Taking out ten spiders debugs the hotel, bestows bonus points, 
and advances you to the next level. 

The real difficulty, in authentic pest control simulation 
style, is that there are eventually many more of them than 
there is of you. After they completely occupy the hotel, they 
raise their flag, bring down the house, and end the game. 

Alternately, a quicker finish comes after the second time a 
spider has managed to bite your foot. This makes for some 
pretty short games, which some may consider to be a bit 
disappointing. 

Others, however, may not. $34.95. Hi

□ Putting a Whole New Face on Things.

Chernoff's computer-generated faces, ac- 
cording to a recent Wall Street Jour- 
nal. Vijay Mahajan of the University of 
Pennsylvania's Wharton School, David 
Huff of the University of Texas, and Will-

ing large amounts of interrelated infor- 
mation understandable to people at a 
glance. He decided that a computer- 
drawn face on which relevant informa- 
tion was plotted would be more mean- 
ingful to people than would endless 
graphs and charts. 

In their new application of Chernoff's 
technique, professors Mahajan, Huff, 
and Black take financial information 
from a company's annual report and as- 
sign it to facial features. Such things as 
the length and angle of the eyebrow, the 
diameter of the ear, and the contour of 
the mouth become significant indicators 
of cash turnover, inventory turnover, the 
ratio of current assets to current liabili- 
ties, and so on. Facial features change as 
variables change. 

Their technique serves well as a 
means of comparing the health of two dif- 
ferent companies over a period of time. 
Certainly, various people interpret facial 
expressions differently, and the profes- 
sors concede that their technique needs 
further refinement. But when people say 
that the outlook for a particular compa- 
ny is cheery — or grim — don't be sur- 
prised if they don't ply you with compli- 
cated graphs and charts to support their 
views. They may be basing their assess- 
ment on the information they get from 
computer-generated faces. 
□ Rent a What? Want to fight a com- 
puter? Call Rent-A-Kvetch and let their 
trained staff do it for you. Kvetch is a 
Yiddish word, the meaning of which can't 
adequately be described in English, but 
which refers to a person who's good at 
complaining. B. L. Ochman is such a 
kvetch, and she founded tills organiza- 
tion dedicated to artful, legitimate com- 
plaints. Ochman says she'll handle just 
about any complaint, and a good percen- 
tage that come through her office are 
computer snafus that originated in de- 
partment stores and mail-order houses. 

Ochman's favorite involves a man 
who received a bill from a large store in- 
forming him that he owed a balance of 
"$00.00." The man ignored the bills that 
came month after month that requested 
he pay this outstanding amount— always 
"$00.00." Letters continued to come, 
threatening him with a collection agency 
unless he paid the amount of "$00.00" in 
full. Finally a warrant came for his ar- 
rest. 

Totally at a loss as to what to do, the 
man called Rent-A-Kvetch. B. L. Och- 
man advised him to write the company a 
check for the amount of $00.00. 

"It worked," she laughs. "He was 
never bothered again."

open, traps to evade, and loot to be divided! 

A partial list of Wizardry features includes— A 10 level 
maze— 8 character classes— 5 races— 20 stored on disk — 
3D maze display — complete castle — hundreds of monsters 
and magic items — monsters appear in mixed groups — 50 
castable spells, usuable by players, magic items and even

Another Rent-A-Kvetch customer was 
billed twice for a vacuum cleaner she had 
bought from a large store. She wrote let- 
ter after letter explaining her case to the 
company, but she always received re- 
plies signed by a Mr. Hamilton who sug- 
gested she pay her bill immediately. 

When Ochman entered the case, she 
first tried to contact Mr. Hamilton. It 
didn't take her long to discover that no 
Mr. Hamilton existed — just a computer 
using the name. 

"I kind of find this work challeng- 
ing," confesses Ochman. "I guess I like 
being a detective. 

"I also understand the business struc- 
ture. Although I don't know much about 



computers, I know when they make an 
error, they won't undo it. A person has to 
do that." 

And Ochman doesn't see any reason 
for micro owners to worry. Most of the 
computers she becomes involved with 
are large mainframes — like Mr. Hamil- 
ton. 

□ Computer Alarm. If your wake-up call 
sounded particularly sexy or friendlier 
than usual the last time you stayed in a 
hotel — think back. It could have been a 
computer you were listening to. Several 
hotels around the country are taking ad- 
vantage of computer technology to solve 
the problem of how to wake up their 
guests. It was just too big a job for tele- 




phone operators in some of the larger es- 
tablishments who sometimes had more 
than one hundred guests request a wake- 
up time of eight a.m. exactly. Invari- 
ably, the sleepers who received the later 
of the hundred phone calls weren't being 
awakened in time, so a computer was as- 
signed the job. 

International Micor Systems in Phoe- 
nix, Arizona, is currently revamping 
their old computerized system that 
awakens hotel guests with a recorded 
"Good morning" message, available, in- 
cidentally, in just about any language. 
When the hotel operator receives a call 
from a hotel guest requesting this ser- 
vice, the operator punches in the room 
number, the date, and the specified 
wake-up time on the computer key- 
board. If the guest requested a wake-up 
call at seven-thirty the next morning, the 
phone in that guest's room would ring at 
exactly seven twenty-five. The computer 
makes a notation if nobody on the other 
end picks up the phone, and calls back at 
exactly seven-thirty-five. 

"It's very dependable." explains 
Chuck Nasziger of Micor. "It tries five 
minutes before the hour and five min- 
utes after the hour." The company works 
closely with Craig Recording Studios in 
Jenkintown, Pennsylvania; Craig pro- 
vides the sound effects for the tape re- 
cording, which range from a foreign 
greeting to a rooster crowing. The tape is 
triggered by the computer. 

In case the room occupant complains 
he missed his appointment and ques- 
tions whether his wake-up call was over- 
looked, the computer also prints out hard 
copy — written proof that an attempt was 
made to rouse him. 

According to Nasziger, Micor is cur- 
rently working on a new version of the 
system that will be more streamlined 
and cost efficient. One of the main differ- 
ences is that hotel guests will no longer be 
listening to a tape recorded message. In- 
stead, they will be talking directly with a 
computer. 

"And it won't even sound like a com- 
puter. You can tell tape recordings — they 
hiss — I can't stand listening to them. But 
hearing the same message from a com- 
puter isn't much different from talking to 
either you or me." 

The old system is currently in use at 
Ramada Inns, Marriotts, and Hyatt Re- 
gencies. Other hotels have their own sys- 
tem, like the Fontainebleau in Miami 
Beach. There a thermometer on the roof 
gives the current temperature along with 
a recorded wake-up call. The computer 
pulls out ,the appropriate voice track 
based on the temperature reading from 
the roof. 

The Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles 
also has a computer that activates wake- 
up calls. However, some of their guests 
stipulate that morning calls come from a 
human and not a machine. "And they are 
accommodated," says a spokesman for 
the hotel.

SOCTAI It 



MARCH 1982 




Last month, we discussed various standards for interfac- 
ing peripherals to the Apple II. In particular, we defined the 
RS-232 serial and Centronics-type parallel standards with 
which almost all printers, modems, and terminals are con- 
nected. This month, we'll describe some of the interface 
boards on the market. Although all of these boards conform to 
one of the standards just mentioned, their operation and fea- 
tures are quite varied. Therefore, we will first examine the fac- 
tors upon which evaluation of these boards can be based. 

Parallel Boards. As you'll recall from last month, the Cen- 
tronics parallel standard specifies the signals, voltage levels, 
and timing necessary for the proper transfer of data. How- 
ever, this standard leaves several parameters undefined. 
Some printers stray even further by using a modified "Cen- 
tronics-type" standard. This usually means that the data 
and/or handshake signals are inverted from the normal stan- 
dard. Furthermore, many powerful features can be in- 
corporated into a parallel board by using the Apple's I/O ROM 
expansion. 

One of the undefined parameters mentioned above con- 
cerns the high-order bit of the transmitted data. Since most 
data is transferred using the seven-bit ASCII code, the eighth 
bit is left unspecified. Most of the older printers ignore this bit 
anyway and, in fact, some printer cards don't even send it. 
However, many of the newer printers do use this bit to select 
alternate character sets or print graphics. 

Therefore, if you're going to use one of these printers, it's 
important that you know how a printer card handles this bit. If 
the card always keeps the bit low, that card will work fine for 
text but cannot be used for graphics. If this bit is transmitted 
unmodified via the Apple's Monitor routines, then it will al- 
ways be high when text is being sent. This is so because of the 
way ASCII characters are stored in the Apple's memory (high 
bit on, also known as negative ASCII) . If this is the case with 
the printer you use, then you may have to adjust your printer 
(usually by changing a dip switch) or modify the cable to avoid 
the unwanted character sets or graphics. Full feature boards 
will allow this bit to be changed via software either by poking or 
with a control sequence. 

Several boards simplify the Centronics standard down to 
the minimum ten- wire interface. This deletes busy, select, 
paper empty, fault, and other such signals to and from the 
printer. Although these signals are seldom used, some older 
printers require that the busy line be connected. Most printers 
manufactured today, however, can provide full handshaking 
with the acknowledge signal and thus work with the simplified 
interface. Considering the way things progress in the comput- 
er field, it probably is a good idea to have the full interface ; fu- 
ture software or printer features may require the use of these 
extra lines. 

Probably the simplest nonstandard to deal with is the line 
feed on carriage return. Some printers automatically provide 
a line feed (moving the paper to the next line) whenever they 
perform a carriage return (moving the printhead back to the 
left margin) . Note that while a typewriter performs these op- 
erations simultaneously, they are two separate functions on a 
printer. If the printer does not supply its own line feed, the 
computer must send the appropriate ASCII code (OA in hex) 
following each carriage return code. 



Most printer cards can be configured to work with either 
kind of printer. Many printers today have an option that al- 
lows you to select for the line feed or not. If both your printer 
and interface card give you a choice, then it doesn't matter 
what you use as long as the two agree. If the printer is not get- 
ting line feeds when it should, it will print everything on the 
same line over and over again. If things are the other way 
around, you'll get double-spaced printing. All things being 
equal, it's probably better to let the printer generate the line 
feed, especially if you have a print buffer. 

All of the boards we tested contained some driver software 
in PROM. This makes it possible to call them up from Basic 
using the familiar PR# command. Aside from providing sim- 
ple parallel output, on-board firmware can also add many 
printer-related features, such as line and page length control, 
tabbing, left and right margin setting, and screen dumps. The 
default values for many of these features are also contained in 
the firmware or are possibly selectable through dip switches or 
jumpers. Most boards allow the values to be changed via 
software. 

To allow screen dumps of the hi-res graphics pages, a soft- 
ware routine customized for your printer is needed. Several 
such routines are available on disk, but the more elaborate 
printer cards include this in their firmware. Along with dump- 
ing either hi-res page, one can usually change the size of the 
image, rotate it, or invert it (change black to white and vice 
versa) and any combination of these. If your printer has selec- 
tion between bidirectional or unidirectional printing, you may 
wish to use the latter for graphics. It will take twice as long to 
complete a picture, but the detail should be cleaner as a result 
of the more accurate printhead alignment. 

Finally, if you hate waiting for the printer to finish before 
regaining use of the computer, consider one of the new buf- 
fered printer cards. The specs to look for here are: buffer size, 
ability to disable the buffer (for test purposes) , ability to clear 
the buffer (in case you make a mistake) , and text compres- 
sion. This last feature can make a small buffer seem much 
larger by reducing the number of bytes it takes to store a given 
portion of text. In a formatted program listing or columnar 
data printout, for instance, there will usually be many places 
where several spaces in a row are to be printed. Normally, 
each such space would take up one byte in the buffer. Text 
compression, however, might reduce this in the following 
manner. 

As each character to be printed comes in, it is checked with 
the preceding character. If the two match— meaning that you 
have at least two of the same characters in a row— then a 
counter is started. Instead of placing the subsequent charac- 
ters (all the same) into the buffer, the counter keeps track of 
how many times the character repeats. 

When the first new character appears, the result in the 
counter is placed into the buffer in some unique way, such as 
with its high-order bit set. At the other end of the buffer, this 
code being retrieved will cause the printer to repeat the last 
printed character the appropriate number of times. If such a 
technique is used, any number of repeating characters (in this 
case, up to 127) can be represented in the buffer by only two 
bytes. With typical printouts, this can effectively increase the 
buffer size by 20 percent to 60 percent.

Serial Boards. With serial boards, all the criteria for parallel 
interfaces apply (except the simplified ten-wire standard). 
Furthermore, there are several other factors with which to 
rate a serial board's capabilities. First is baud rate, the speed 
at which the data transfer takes place. Some printers and 
modems operate at only one baud rate. If that is the case with 
your peripherals, you only need be concerned that the serial 
board you select can be used at that particular rate. For gen- 
eral use, the more flexible the baud rate is, the better. 

Keep in mind that modems and external terminals require 
duplex operation (two-way communication) while a printer is 
generally treated as a receive-only device. Some printer /seri- 
al card configurations, however, may require the return data 
link for handshaking information. 

When your printer or other external device can operate at 
several baud rates, it is desirable to have an interface board 
that can match the highest speed available. Higher speeds 
usually require that the handshaking be done very carefully. 

The several forms of hardware handshaking presently in 
use have subtle differences that may be either good or bad for 
you; all interface cards may not work equally well with any 
given printer. 

After you've considered baud rate, you're ready to make 
choices regarding word length (five to eight bits) , parity con- 
trol (odd, even, or none) , and number of stop bits. Again, these 
settings should match those specified for the equipment to be 
connected. If in doubt, eight bit/no parity /one stop bit usually 
works. 

If the complete RS-232 standard is implemented, you may 
find it necessary to add certain jumpers inside the cable be- 
tween the computer and the other device. Some boards allow 
this jumpering to be done on the board itself along with pin se- 
lection for the handshaking signal. Look for as much flexibili- 
ty here as possible. All "RS-232 standard" devices are not 
equal and some can be very hard to interface. 

On to the Boards! To set the pace for the other interface 
boards, we'll examine the three cards currently available from 
Apple Computer. These have been around a long time now, 
and, although they do not represent the state of the art, they 
have set the standard with which other boards need to be com- 
patible. In particular, the control command sequences have 
become entrenched within many programs. Therefore, to al- 
low software compatibility, most interface cards recognize 
these standard control codes. 

Apple Parallel Printer Interface Card. In terms of our pre- 
viously described criteria, this board stacks up as follows. The 
on-board firmware sets the high-order bit low, but all eight bits 
can be accessed with user- written software. The simplified 
ten-wire interface is augmented by a configuration block. This 
allows selection between positive or negative going signals. 
Line feed control, line length, and printer command character 
are set easily, thanks to the parallel card's firmware. These 
commands are all signalled by first sending the printer com- 
mand character (usually control-I) : 

Control-I n N— Turns off printing to the video monitor and 

sets the line length to n columns. 
Control-I I — Restores printing to the video screen. 
Control-I K— Disables automatic line feed generation. 
Control-I control-letter — Changes the printer command 

character to the designated letter. 
Control-letter control-I — Changes the printer command 

character back to control-I. 

To activate any of these commands, just print the corre- 
sponding sequence of characters as shown above. This can be 
done either from the keyboard, in the immediate mode, or 
from within a program. The following Basic line, for example, 
will turn on the printer card and set the line length to eighty 
columns : 

100 PRINT "ctrl-d PR#1" : PRINT "ctrl-i 80N" 

Most programmers dislike the use of control characters 



within the print statements. For one thing, they do not show up 
on the video screen. Another problem is that when listing the 
program, these commands will be executed by the printer 
card. A better approach would be to use the CHR$ function: 

10 D$=CHR$(4):I$=CHR$(9) 
100 PRINT D$"PR=1" : PRINT l$"80N" 

Integer Basic, however, does not support the CHR$ function. 

Therefore, it would be nice to have some way to make the 
printer card ignore the embedded control commands. This can 
be accomplished using the last two commands above. Typing a 
control-I followed by any control letter changes the printer 
card's command character to that letter. Thus, the control-Is 
found within the program no longer have any effect on the 
card. The program can now be listed to the printer without any 
side effects. When you are ready to run the program, the com- 
mand character can be changed back to control-I. This fea- 
ture is even more important on other cards that have many 
more commands. Price of the Parallel Printer Interface Card 
is $180, including cable. 

Apple Communications Interface Card. This card provides 
full-duplex serial communication at either 110 or 300 baud. For 
this reason, it is used mainly for connecting modems or ex- 
ternal terminals. It can be used to drive a serial printer, but its 
slow speed and lack of handshaking make it a poor choice (it is 
possible to correct these deficiencies, but this requires making 
hardware modifications). 

Full control of the data word format is available by poking, 
and lower-case input can be optionally converted to upper case 
for display on the Apple's screen. The Comm Card's firmware 
permits Basic control with a PR# statement for output and In# 
statement for input. It further supports the following 
commands : 

Control-A control-H — Selects half-duplex terminal mode of 
operation. 

Control-A control-F — Selects full-duplex terminal 

operation. 

Control-A control-1 — Sets baud rate to 110. 
Control-A control-3— Sets baud rate to 300. 
Control-A control-X — Cancels terminal mode. 

The Communications Interface Card sells for $225 and 
comes with a DB-25 connector that mounts on the back of the 
Apple. 

High-Speed Serial Interface Card. This was Apple's an- 
swer to the need for a serial card that could run at higher 
speeds to drive printers or terminals. In many ways, it's prob- 
ably one of the worst boards Apple made, but it does have 
some features not found on other serial boards. 

To begin with, there are no provisions for handshaking. As 
a band-aid fix when duplex operation is not required (for 
example, use with a printer), it is possible to send the hand- 
shake signal over the receive data line. This requires a soft- 
ware patch or replacement of the card's firmware. 

The High-Speed Serial Card also performs its data transla- 
tion via software (as opposed to the usual hardware UART) . 
This can present some other problems, especially if interrupts 
are being used. 

On the positive side, this board supports communication at 
rates from 75 to 19,200 baud. Data format, lower-case conver- 
sion, baud rate, line length, and line feed are all software con- 
trolled through pokes. A very nice feature of this board is the 
use of seven dip switches to set the default values of several pa- 
rameters. Three of the switches set the baud rate; one allows 
for a carriage return delay; two more set the default line 
length to 40, 72, 80, or 132 characters; and the last switch con- 
trols the line feed generation. 

The carriage return delay is used in lieu of handshaking 
when connecting to some printers. It causes the computer to 
wait about one-fourth of a second after every carriage return. 
This compensates for the time needed by the printhead to re- 
turn to the left margin. Apple's High Speed Serial Interface 
Card goes for $195, including a rear- mounted connector.

SSM Microcomputer Products. SSM was one of the first in- 
dependent companies to offer interface boards for the Apple. 
They make a serial board (ASIO), a parallel board (APIO), 
and a dual serial/parallel board (AIO) . These boards are well 
designed, but the firmware included with them originally was 
rather weak. No command codes were implemented and all 
parameter changes had to be made by poking. 

Recently, however, SSM has revised all of its firmware and 
added a new board — the AIO- II. With the new firmware, the 
APIO now emulates Apple's parallel card. This board can also 
be used for general purpose parallel interfacing, providing two 
bidirectional programmable eight-bit ports. The standard 
firmware works with Centronics-type printers but optional 
PROMs are available to handle other printer standards. The 
PROMs can even be replaced with RAM chips to allow load- 
ing a custom driver onto the card from disk. 

The ASIO board provides serial communication at 110 to 
19,200 baud with full handshaking. Two connectors on the 
board allow it to act as either a DTE or DCE device, eliminat- 
ing the need for special cable wiring. The standard firmware 
emulates a parallel card for printer compatibility. For use 
with modems or terminals, the optional communications firm- 
ware can be installed. This makes the ASIO board look like an 
Apple Communications Card, including its "dumb terminal" 
operation. 

The AIO board combines the functions of both the APIO and 
ASIO. The firmware can support only one interface, however, 
so extra software must be written to use both ports. Although 
still available, this board will eventually be replaced by the 
AIO-II. 

The AIO-II sports several firmware options and seven 
jumper-selectable controls. These jumpers configure the 
board for line feed generation, DCE/DTE operation, se- 
rial/parallel operation, and positive or negative strobe, data, 
and acknowledge. This should provide the user with enough 
flexibility to connect any printer. Although simultaneous opera- 
tion of both ports is possible, extra software must be supplied 
for them to work independently. 

Optional driver software is also available for using the SSM 
boards with Pascal and CP/M. Pricing on the boards is as fol- 
lows: APIO, $109; ASIO, $149 including cable; AIO, $195 in- 
cluding parallel and serial cables; and AIO-II, $225 (cables 
cost extra). 

Tymac Controls PPC-100. Offering a little bit more than the 
average parallel card, the PPC-100 allows the high-order bit to 
be set high or low by simple poke commands. Aside from this, 
the board performs exactly like the Apple parallel board. No 
configuration block is used, so the printer must conform pre- 
cisely to the Centronics standard. The PPC-100 board sells for 
$139 including cable. 

Orange Micro Grappler. The Grappler interface combines 
an enhanced parallel card with on-board graphics dump rou- 
tines. The enhancements include treatment of the full set of 
status lines and the following additional commands: 

Control-I B — Enable bell. Allows Control-Gs to be passed to 

printer ringing its bell if it has one. 
Control-I H — Allows high-order bit to be sent to printer. 



Control-I nL — Set left margin to the nth print position. 
Control-I nP— Set page length to n lines per page. After 

every n lines, six line feeds will be outputted to start a 

new page. 

Control-I nR— Set right margin to nth character. 
Control-I S — Dump present text screen to the printer. 
Control-I X — Turn off high-order bit to the printer. 

These new commands are impressive enough, but the real 
power of the Grappler is in its graphics capabilities. Following 
a control-I with a G instructs the board to print out a hi-res pic- 
ture subject to the following optional parameters : 

2 — Print hi-res page 2 instead of page 1. 
D — Print the graphics image double size. 
I — Invert the image (reverse black and white). 
L — Print image at the left margin previously set. 
R — Rotate the picture 90 degrees. Allows several pictures 
to be shown adjoining. Can simulate a chart recorder. 

As an example of these commands, if you typed control- 
IGDI2R, you would receive a printout of the hi-res page 2 
double size, inverted, and rotated ninety degrees. Since there is 
no standard for graphics printing, the firmware in the Grap- 
pler must be matched to the particular printer you are going to 
use. If you change printers, the card will still be good for print- 
ing text, but the graphics commands will probably not work. 

Orange Micro deserves credit for advancing the state of the 
art in Apple printer boards. Several new boards have ap- 
peared with Grappler-compatible features. If imitation is in- 
deed a form of flattery, then Orange Micro should be pleased. 
Price of the Grappler is $165, including cable. 

Olensky Bros. Smart II. Touting a 3K print buffer with text 
compression, this board also adds margins and tab setting to 
the basic parallel board. Two dip switches allow the buffer 
and/or extra features to be disabled; with both switches on, the 
board emulates an Apple Parallel Card. Most of the new com- 
mands are accessed with a control-V as follows: 

Control-V S aaa.bbb.ccc,... — Sets up to sixteen tab stops at 

the absolute print positions specified. 
Control-V T— Tab to next stop. 
Control-V Ln — Set left margin. 
Control-V Rn— Set right margin. 
Escape K — Sets pass-through mode on. 

The pass-through mode allows special text to be transmit- 
ted without interference by the Smart II firmware. It turns off 
text compression, margins, and tabbing. This was the only 
board tested that passed text out with the high bit set. This re- 
quired us to change our printer settings to use seven- bit code, 
giving up its alternate character set capabilities. The Smart II 
also has an LED to indicate when the buffer is full. Price of the 
board is $225 including cable. 

Practical Peripherals Microbuffer II. As usual, we've kept 
the best for last. The Microbuffer II combines the best of all the 
other boards and then does a bit more.

Word Processing: Apple Writer III 



At Home in Little America 






BV JONATHAN MILLER 



Rob Swigart had arrived. 

Within moments, the science fiction writer from Northern 
California would be meeting with Ingo Preminger, the Holly- 
wood producer (M*A*S*H) who would later commission him 
to write the screen adaptation of his most successful book, Lit- 
tle America. 

This was the big time, the big bucks, and Swigart, the Sili- 
con Valley satirist, stood outside the PSA commuter terminal 
watching the wealth wheel by. A Cadillac, a Rolls, a Cadillac, 
another Rolls — on and on just like the idiot recording, made 
popular by the movie Airport, droning overhead about the 
white zone for loading and unloading of passengers only. 

This was Los Angeles, land of hype and hypocrisy. No place 
for an upstater and certainly no place for a writer. Swigart had 
heard the stories. About the studio heads who gave great meet- 
ings and wouldn't know a screenplay if it fell on them. You 
came here to remind yourself that evil was not an abstraction. 
You came here for all the money those chauffeured movie 
moguls paid their writers. 

Only where was Ingo, brother of Otto, the Austrian with a 
voice like a twenty-one gun salute? Why, standing at our pil- 
grim's feet, giving greeting and ushering Swigart to the park- 
ing structure across the street. For there, in a common stall, 
surrounded by Hondas, Capris, and Chevettes, stood Ingo's 
Hollywood limo: a blue, '71 Volkswagen Beetle. 

Swigart laughs as he recalls his rendezvous with Ingo 
"Three Homes" Preminger, the mogul who mauled his Holly- 
wood preconceptions. For Ingo is Swigart 's kind of guy and 
this, on a small scale, a Swigart kind of story — a free spirit in a 
cock-eyed world rising above the banalities and incongruities 
to make a game of life. 

We are gathered in Swigart's cozy office cottage behind his 
tree-shaded home in Redwood City, the one that has followed 
the Silicon Valley's soaring fortunes by appreciating from $42,- 
000 to $350,000 in ten years. Swigart, hands behind his head, is 
rocking in a high-backed swivel chair upholstered in shocking- 
ly decadent and unwriterly red velveteen. Behind him, on a 
long table, the tools of his solitary trade: an Apple III, a Sony 
CRT, and a Diablo Printer, which moments before whipped 
out the final pages of his Little America script. 

Here is a man at peace in two language worlds— the fic- 



tional cosmos he creates using English and the literal world he 
manipulates with his Apple Writer word processor. "Push a 
button and in one and a half hours a whole script, one hundred 
seventeen pages, is typed. Push another button and you can 
move huge files around. You feel so powerful." 

The power inherent in technology, in those sublime gad- 
gets we call computers, fascinates Swigart both in fact and in 
fiction. In his novel, The Time Trip, Swigart's computer pro- 
grammer hero harnesses a bank of government computers, in- 
to which he has illegally tapped, to the linear accelerator at 
Stanford University to travel 4,000 years back in time. His pur- 
pose? To retrieve his deceased wife from the hereafter, the lit- 
tle woman having checked out by sticking her comely Mid- 
west head in a microwave oven. 

It's a neat trick, but in Swigart's absurdist world neatness 
doesn't count. There are limits to technology and languages 
that attempt to order the crazy universe. Ultimately, our hero 
learns, all life is fiction, a play on words. Winning isn't as im- 
portant as having fun in the game, in valuing language for it- 
self. "I've always felt that the language of science and tech- 
nology is very romantic, particularly when you get into the eso- 
teric aspect of basic research, such as high-energy physics," 
observes Swigart. "They'll talk about subatomic particles as 
having strangeness and charm, even a romantic streak." 

Swigart is intrigued by the notion of crossover, of the in- 
creasing power of electronic machines to simulate the real 
world. They may never bridge the gap, but brother Swigart 
relishes the prospect. "I'm really interested in the unification 
of East and West, in the right and left hemispheres of the 
brain," he explains. "Science is interested in the why, technol- 
ogy in the how, but traditionally there's been a split between 
them. I'm concerned about the creation and wholeness, which 
means understanding technology in a spiritual as well as a ma- 
nipulative sense." 

All this Is very serious thought food for a guy who claims to 
be nontechnical, but the way Swigart tells it, it's perfectly 
natural. Computers are as much a part of the natural environ- 
ment as trees in the forest. That certainly was true in Swigart's 
neck of the woods. Back in the seventies, every whiz kid in San 
Mateo County was turning the family garage into a computer 
laboratory. You could no more ignore that incredible activity

than you could the psychological impact of technology on man, 
long a Swigart preoccupation. "It affects the way you think 
and creates certain limitations. Like phones," he deadpans. 
"They're always ringing when you're in the bathroom, the im- 
portance of the call always being inversely proportional to the 
urgency of nature's." 

Yes, at times there does seem to be some machinelike con- 
spiracy against man — from sadistic laundromat washers that 
tear families of socks asunder to larcenous vending machines 
that goad you to kick them. Such tension between the animate 
and inanimate worlds bore looking into. It was time for Swi- 
gart — teacher, poet, cello player, and screenwriter — to bite the 
Apple, to taste of the forbidden fruit. 

The Agony and the Ecstasy. Writing is not by nature a plea- 
surable occupation, but Rob Swigart is enjoying it more now 
that he has an Apple III. He loves its superb keyboard and the 
way his fingers fit the scalloped keys. He marvels at its speed, 
the capacity of its memory, and the flexibility of its operating 
program. But mostly, he just likes playing with it. When you're 
a gadget freak, your tools are your toys. 




"To tell you the truth, I'm not even sure I'm saving more 
time using a word processor instead of a typewriter," he says 
of his Apple Writer program. "I know I do a lot more editorial 
tinkering because it's so easy to make changes, but I don't 
know about my productivity. I just have a lot of fun playing 
with it." 

Playing, of course, has its serious side, as Swigart discov- 
ered when he started hammering out Ingo's script. Scripts pre- 
sent certain formatting problems because dialogue blocks and 
scene directions employ margins of varying widths. "Basical- 
ly, I was dealing with four different margin settings," he ex- 
plains. "Because you don't get on the screen what you even- 
tually get on the page, you have to format the stuff as you do it 
so that when it prints, it prints the script." 

Another problem was not as easily solved. Because scripts 
are constantly undergoing revision — with scenes being moved 
from one place to another — scene numbering is customarily 
left to the last moment. To cope with this, Swigart spent two 
taxing days writing a utility subprogram that consecutively 
numbers scenes during the final print run. 

The printing itself, however, created another headache for 
Swigart, though the prescription was easily filled thanks to the 
Apple's flexible operating system. "Due to the printer's age, it 
required certain handshaking routines, but I was able to con- 
figure the system in a way to make it work," Swigart ex- 
plains. "With another computer, you would have had to ex- 
change hardware to get it to work. It's nice to know the Apple 
is software-driven rather than hard-wired, so that if some daz- 
zling feature comes along you can reconfigure your system to 
accommodate it." 

It's also nice to know, he adds, that this new word process- 
ing program features a glossary that stores frequently used 
names and phrases. And that his files contain 58,000 charac- 
ters as opposed to the 12,000 on his old Easy Writer program. 
Now he keeps his entire script on four files (two disks) instead

of seventeen. Mention of the Easy Writer program evokes a 
nightmare recollection: the transfer of his script files from 
Easy Writer to Apple Writer. And it does sound horrible. 

"I had to boot up Easy Writer on the Apple II, then get an 
Easy Writer file disk, take a file off of it, put in another Easy 
Writer file disk, turn off the machine, boot up this program, put 
the Easy Writer file disk in drive one and the Apple DOS file 
disk in drive two and run this program transferring the Easy 
Writer file from the Easy Writer file disk to the Apple Writer 
disk, turn off the machine and boot up Apple Writer, transfer 
the file from the DOS disk to an Apple Writer disk, turn off the 
machine, boot up Easy Writer, delete the Easy Writer file from 
the Easy Writer disk, and put another file on it. I had to do that 
with seventeen files to get the script transferred over," says 
Swigart, gasping for breath. Then triumphantly: "But it 
worked." Is this a man happy with his Apple Writer? In the 
main, yes, but he does have a few bones to pick. As currently 
configured, there's no way to know where the page breaks are, 
so you don't know where to place a script's headers, footers, 
and continued lines. An optional, page line, and a decent bunch 
of utility programs in word processing language, says Swi- 
gart, would eliminate the system's few bugs. He figures they'd 
be easy to write, but he'll leave that housekeeping chore to 
others. "A programmer I'm not," says Swigart. 

Lust For Life. If not a programmer, who is this nontechni- 
cal man who plays the cello, cheats at computer games, and 
writes science fiction based loosely on Greek tragedy? A man 
of many parts. 

In his forty-one years, this Princeton alumnus has been a 
police reporter, a poet, a textbook salesman, a documentary 
filmmaker, a teacher, a California think tank futurist, and the 
author of four books. Now, as they say, he are a screenwriter. 

It's been a learning experience, with Swigart apprenticing 
under one of the best, Preminger's co-producer, J. P. Miller 
(Days of Wine and Roses). "I thought I knew all this stuff," 
says Swigart. "I wrote the first draft based on a course in film 
comedy I taught. What I did was Xerox the book, cut the chap- 



ters out, and then restructure and paste. They said throw out 
the book, keep it moving, and dramatize everything." 

Screenwriting not only calls for a different technique, it re- 
quires a new mindset, says Swigart. "When you write a novel, 
every word you write down they get, but when you write a 
script nobody's going to read it. Maybe a couple of executives 
and the director, but that's it. Scripts are not movies. They're 
packaging, designed to sell a bunch of lawyers who wouldn't 
know a movie if it fell on them." 

Books are another story, and the eclectic Swigart is experi- 
menting here as well. His latest, The Book of Revelations, ex- 
plores ecological questions and represents his most serious 
and political work. "It's easy for me to be sort of goofy and ab- 
surd," Swigart confides. "It's much harder to be serious." 

But why, Rob? 

"Scared," he says. "When you're reading to people — which 
I like to do — and they're laughing, you're getting feedback. 
When you read something serious and there's no visible, audi- 
ble response, you don't know whether they're asleep." 

At the moment, though, Swigart is more concerned with the 
sleep state of his interviewer. He's afraid he hasn't been quot- 
able. This, after all, is the self-promotional age of the writer ce- 
lebrity, the pugnacious Norman Mailer and the dapper Tom 
Wolfe. It's part of the hype borrowed from the painterly arts, 
from Dalis and the Pollocks. The quotable prospects are look- 
ing dismal when suddenly, gratefully, Swigart brightens with 
inspiration. "Yes," he wryly observes, "you can't get by with 
just cutting your ear off anymore." Hi 



Jonathan Miller edited several magazines from time to 
time at East/West Network, a publisher of in-flight magazines 
in Los Angeles, and there distinguished himself as & nonpareil 
author of office memos. Formerly with the Los Angeles Her- 
ald Examiner, Miller had recently joined the ranks of starving 
writers when Softalk offered to let him string for his supper, 
which he'll be doing regularly. 



Lazer isn't afraid to compare! 

(because we have the best lower case system available.) 

Despite the fact that we were one of the first manufacturers to produce lower case equipment for the Apple II, Lazer 
Microsystems products are still the state-of-the-art. Beside the obvious price/performance advantage we have over the 
competition, our products are expandable. Lazer is constantly introducting new products including our Lower Case + Plus 
II, Character Set + Plus (that adds 2 additional character sets to the Lower Case + Plus), and our new "Double Vision 
+ Plus" for owners of Computer STOP'S Double Vision 80-column board. 

Lazer's products are compatable with more word processors than anybody else's. Our Lower Case + Plus is compatable 
with Easywriter and unmodified Apple writers. None of our competitors below can make that claim. In fact, BASIS' board 
isn't even compatable with Programma's PIE! The following chart lists Lazer's superiority over the competing units.

Before getting into this month's topic (yes, folks, we really 
are going to do graphics this time!), there is a little house- 
cleaning left over from the first two columns. First of all, you 
can use all the commands given to date in deferred mode, to 
wit: 

10 LIST 
20 RUN 

Try it. You'll like it. Second, you can usepeefc and poke to look 
at almost any area of memory or to modify it. Try the follow- 
ing little routine : 

10 POKE 1024 + X, 193 

20 X = X + 1: IF X < 1024 THEN 10 

You might want to try numbers other than 193 in line 10 and 
then examine the effect. 

So much for loose ends. Here is this month's vocabulary 
list:

This month we promised to explore the Apple's graphics 
capability. To understand how the Apple can switch between 
text mode and graphics mode we are going to have to bite the 
bullet and take at least a cursory look at how the Apple's 
memory is organized. When Steve Wozniak ("the Woz") and 
other early explorers first mapped out the memory of the Ap- 
ple, they placed boundaries between regions at nice even num- 
bers to make them easier to remember. Unfortunately, they 
were not using the decimal numerical system at the time, so 
much of the beauty of this arrangement may be lost on the 
casual observer. The numbers on the left side of this map are 
decimal; the ones on the right, hexadecimal (which is just like 
decimal if you have sixteen fingers). Hexadecimal numbers 
are indicated by the dollar sign placed in front of them.

The numbers on both sides of this diagram are addresses. 
When we poked 193s into memory a short time ago, we poked 
them into the area between 1024 and 2048. This is the area of 
memory that is displayed on your television when you are in 
text mode (which you are right now unless you have looked 
ahead) . 

Now try adding the following line to your program: 
5 GR 

The command gr puts you in graphics mode. If you poke 
this area of memory now, instead of A's you'll see rows of 
colored stripes being plotted on the screen. We are not going to 
get into why the rows don't load in order or what causes the 
stripes to be different colors— these would lead us pretty far 
afield. But this little demonstration is important because it 
shows that the same area of memory can represent text or 
graphics. 

Apple graphics come in two flavors : low resolution (lo-res 
to those in the trade) and high resolution. Lo-res graphics can 
plot up to forty blocks in forty rows, in sixteen different colors. 
Hi-res gives you 280 dots horizontally and 192 vertically, in 
eight different colors (although two of them are black and two 
are white, which is another way of saying you really get white 
plus four other colors) . In addition, in hi-res, you have an op- 
portunity to draw on either of two different screens. 

Those screens come from a different area of memory than 
the part we just poked. If you look at the memory map above, 
you will find two areas side-by-side, one marked "Hi-res, page 
1" and the other marked "Hi-res, page 2." A little quick sub- 
traction will show that these areas are far larger than the lo- 
res area we have been fooling with up to now, which makes 
sense when you think about it, since there are 280 by 192 dots to 
keep track of rather than 40 by 40. 

You can display any of these screens on your television. 
Type text and then list your program. Now change line 5 to 
read: 

5 HGR (remember how to edit?) 

Run it. The screen clears, and for a while nothing happens. 
Then four rows of A's appear at the bottom of the screen. At 
least that's what happened at this computer. 

Hgr is a composite command, which means that it tells the 
computer to do a whole lot of things. First, it tells the comput- 
er to take the video output from the area of memory called hi- 
res page 1. Then it tells it to clear this area of any accumu- 
lated garbage, so the screen Is blank. And finally, it tells it to 
open a four-line text window into the text page at the bottom of 
the screen, presumably so you can put a title on whatever pic- 
ture you are about to draw. 

Let's take another look at our program. Type text and then 
list to retrieve it. To prove that hgr redirects the television's at- 
tention to a new area of computer memory, let's rewrite our 
program so that it pokes into the area called hi-res page 1 on 
our map. The new program should look like this: 

5 HGR 

10 POKE X + 8192, 193 

20 X = X + 1: IF X < 8192 THEN 10 



130 



Immn 



MARCH 1982 



Does everyone understand why line 20 uses the number 
8192? Because when x equals 8192 then x + 8192 (from line 10) 
will equal 16384, which is the end of hi-res page 1. Now run the 
program and be patient. After all, this will take eight times as 
long as filling the lo-res page. 

If all went well, the screen should be filled with color (ex- 
cept for that window into the text page) and you should all now 
believe that hi-res page 1 is located where it's supposed to be. 
We can do the same thing with hi-res page 2, by the way. The 
command to direct video output from page 2 is hgr2, which is 
pretty logical when you think about it. Hgr2 differs from hgr in 
only two respects. First, it won't work if you only have a 16K 
Apple (since your memory doesn't extend up that far — 16K 
means 16 X 1024, which equals 16384, the top boundary of page 
1). Second, it doesn't automatically open a text window at the 
bottom of the screen (you can open one yourself with a well- 
placed poke, but we won't get to that until a little later in this 
episode) . 

You may at first question the value of having two hi-res 
screens available to you, when you don't even know what to do 
with one yet. Well, we'll write a little "page-flipping" program 
next time that should convince even the most skeptical that 
two is better than one. 

But let's get on with the business at hand first. Try entering 
the following program: 

5 HGR 

10 HCOLOR = 1 
20 X = RND(l) * 279 
30 Y = RND(l) * 159 
40 HP LOT X,Y 
50 GOTO 20 

We have a whole mess of new commands here. As you re- 
call, hgr stands for hi-res graphics. Hcolor sets the hi-res color. 



Hplot plots a dot on the hi-res screen. (The equivalent com- 
mands on the lo-res screen are gr, color, and plot. ) Hcolor can 
be set to any value from 0 to 7. The values 0 and 4 are always 
black, 3 and 7 are white. The others vary a great deal depend- 
ing on your television but are usually green (1), blue (2), 
orange (5) , and violet (6) . 

Hplot must always be followed by two values, separated by 
a comma. The first value represents the X coordinate (that is, 
the column) of the dot to be plotted. The second value is the 
vertical row or Y coordinate of the dot. The X coordinate can 
range from 0 to 279 (if the value ever is less than 0 or greater 
than 279, the Apple will stop with a beep and print "? Illegal 
quantity eror in. . . ." You may have to type text to read this 
message, since all errors are printed on the text page) . The Y 
coordinate can range from 0 to 191. (We cut it off at 159 in line 
30 up above because there was no reason to plot dots on the 
part of the screen that is overwritten by the text window.) 

Rnd(x) is the Applesoft random number generator. As long 
as the x is a positive number, rnd(x) will return a random 
value between 0 and 1 each time it is used. Therefore, if you 
want a random number between 0 and 279, you just take 
rnd(x) and multiply it by 279. Rnd(x) is a useful way of getting 
nonsense on your computer screen. 

Just for the fun of it, try modifying line 20 to read as fol- 
lows. Then try to predict what will happen before you run it. 

20 X = RND(l) * RND(l) * 279 

It would take a long time to get anywhere if all you could do 
is plot dots. Fortunately, it isn't. Hplot can be used to draw 
lines as well. Add the following line to your program: 

6 HCOLOR=3: HPLOT 0,0 TO 279,0: HPLOT 279,0 TO 279,159: HPLOT 279,159 
TO 0,159= HPLOT 0,159 TO 0,0

Hcolor=3 sets the color of the border to white. Then each of 
the next four commands draws a straight line from the first set 
of coordinates to the second. Actually, it wasn't necessary to 
write four separate commands like we did. The following line 
would work equally well: 

6 HCOLOR = 3: HP LOT 0,0 TO 279,0 TO 279,159 TO 0,159 TO 0,0 

Hplot can be used to draw diagonal lines as well. After you 
have run the program above to your heart's content, try add- 
ing the following line : 

7 HPLOT 0,0 TO 279,159: HPLOT 0,159 TO 279,0 

Run it. Now we're cooking. Perhaps you would like to title 
this work of art. You could add the following lines to your code : 

1 HOME 

8 VTAB22:HTAB10:PRINT"GLYCOL STUPOR" 

9 PRINT TAB (10)"BY ANN BYE" 

Now run it one more time. Ain't that grand! A classic cross 
between dynamic art and genetic drift. You may not have 
noticed the very subtle way in which we snuck in another for- 
matting command. Tab differs from htab in that it can only be 
used inside a print statement (and htab can never be used in- 
side a print statement) . 

Anyone mad enough to want to save the above creation 
can do so by typing: save Stupor (if on a disk system) or just 
plain save (if you have a cassette based system) . 

Now, we are not going to ignore lo-res graphics utterly. 
However, most of our examples from now on will be on the hi- 
res screen. The lo-res equivalents to the hi-res hplot ... to 
command are vlin and hlin. They are used like this: 

Vlin 0, 39 at 3 means draw a vertical line from row 0 to row 
39 in column 3 

Hlin 0, 39 at 5 means draw a horizontal line from column 0 to 
column 39 in row 5 

A table of the lo-res colors can be found in Appendix O of 
your Applesoft manual. Once you have absorbed all this, try to 
write a lo-res version of Glycol Stupor. Then compare it with 
the listing at the end of this column. The diagonal lines should 
be a real challenge. 

Now that everyone has had a chance to play with the 
graphics some, let's go back to basics for a while. The video 
display of the Apple is controlled by four sets of switches. 
These switches are located in the Read Only Memory (ROM) 
of the Apple and are so sensitive that they can be toggled mere- 
ly by looking at them. Here they are : 



Set 


Purpose 


Address 


la 


Displays screen in graphics mode 


49232 


b 


Displays screen in text 


49233 


2a 


Closes text window at screen bottom 


49234 


b 


Opens text window at screen bottom 


49235 


3a 


Displays page 1 on screen 


49236 


b 


Displays page 2 on screen 


49237 


4a 


Displays $400 area (text/lo-res) 


49238 


b 


Displays one of the hi-res screens 


49239 



You can look at any of these locations by peeking them, like 
this : X=peek(49233) . So if you want to use hgr to turn on page 1 
of the hi-res screens but you don't want the little text window to 
appear at the bottom of the page, you would add a line like this 
to your program: 

10 HGR: X = PEEK(49234) 

That should do it. Now let's see if you can turn on the hi-res 
page 1 using only peeks. (First type text or press reset to get 
back to your normal text page.) Go to it. Your finished effort 
should look something like this, although not necessarily in this 
order: 

1 X = PEEK(49232) 

2 X = PEEK(49234) 

3 X = PEEK(49236) 

4 X = PEEK(49239) 



Hgr is a lot simpler, isn't it? 

The Softalk Random Walk. Let's try one last problem using 
some of the new commands we have learned. Let's write a pro- 
gram to draw a random walk. The first thing to do, as we have 
learned, is to flowchart the problem. A flowchart of this prob- 
lem might look like this: 



Turn on graphics screen 






Initialize 


variables 



Plot start point 



I 



Add random number to x and y ^ 



yes 



I 



Are x and y still on screen? 



+ or — to fix x or y value 



Plot new value 



Our listing might look something like this : 



10 HGR:X = PEEK (49234) 
20 X = 140:Y =96 
30 HCOLOR= 3 
40 HPLOT X,Y 

50 X = X - 5 + RND(l) * 10 
60 Y = Y - 5 + RND(l) * 10 

70 IF X > 0 AND X < 279 and Y > 0 AND Y < 179 THEN 130 
IF X < 0 THEN X = X + 280 
IF X > 279 THEN X = X - 280 
IF Y < 0 THEN Y = Y 4- 192 
IF Y > 191 THEN Y = Y - 192 
GOTO 40 
HPLOT TO X,Y 
GOTO 50 



80 

90 

100 

110 

120 

130 

140 



There are a couple of new ideas in here as well as the Ap- 
plesoft and command and a new way to use hplot ... to. But 
pay closest attention to the way the X and Y values are altered 
in lines 50 and 60, and to the tests in lines 70 through 110. To fig- 
ure out what each part is doing here, try omitting parts of the 
program. For example, place a gotolSO at line 65 (which will 
cause the program to skip all the tests) . Or eliminate line 120 
altogether. What happens in each case when the wandering 
line hits the edge of the hi-res screen? 

We'll examine this program a little more closely next time. 
We'll also start using the game paddles to control our video 
output. 

Finally, as promised, here is a lo-res version of Glycol 

Stupor: 

1 HOME 

5 GR 

6 COLOR= 15: VLIN 0,39 AT 0: VLIN 
0,39 AT 39: HLIN 0,39 AT 0: HLIN 
0,39 AT 39 

7 X = 0:Y = 0 

8 PLOT X,Y: PLOT 39 - X,Y: X = 
X + 1:Y = X: IF X < 40 THEN 
8 

9 VTAB 22: HTAB 10: PRINT "GLY 
COL STUPOR": PRINT TAB( 10) 
"BY ANN BYE" 

10 COLOR = 2 

20 X = RND (1) * RND (1) * 40 
30 Y = RND (1) * RND (1) * 40 
40 PLOT X,Y 
50 GOTO 10

TAMING YOUR APPLE III 

bv iohh jeppsou 



How Does the Program Talk to the Printer? Consider a pro- 
gram happily working away, its subroutines recurring, its 
logic circuits looping, until, in a twinkling, it has computed an 
Important Result. Imagine its excitement, its syntax all 
aquiver. The program must tell the world its Important 
Result. But how? . . . Aha! It knows. It will tell that notorious 
blabbermouth, the printer. That will spread the word quickly 
enough. 

But wait. The printer lives in a rough neighborhood. The 
program mustn't be seen there. What to do? 

In Boston, where the Lodges speak only to the Cabots, and 
the Cabots speak only to God, the solution is well known: send 
a servant to tell someone else to find someone to do the job. The 
solution's much the same in the Apple m. One just has to know 
where to find the right middlemen. 

SOS Brings Help. Programming the Apple m is really quite 
smooth and simple, once you get by some initial complexities 
of the operating system. In fact, the Sophisticated Operating 



System (SOS) greatly increases the computer's power and 
versatility and, in the long run, simplifies many programming 
tasks. But, when you first encounter the Sophisticated Operat- 
ing System, it may seem alarmingly complex. 

How, then, is information transferred from program to 
printer in the Apple m? Not directly. Information goes 
through middlemen, and the principal middleman is the 
driver. There are, in fact, many different drivers, each one as- 
sociated with a device. 

There are all sorts of widgets you can connect to your Ap- 
ple ni. Most people tend to focus on the central processor it- 
self, the main section of the computer where the fancy stuff is 
done. After all, that's what you really bought. But without all 
the attached gadgets, your computer would be deaf, dumb, 
blind, and helpless. These attached thingamagigs are called 
devices. 

Some devices live up to the name pretty well. A printer is ob- 
viously a device. And it doesn't greatly stretch the imagina- 



136 



immn

tion to call the monitor screen and disk drives devices, too. But 
how about the keyboard, or the audio capability, or the 
graphics department? It's not quite so obvious that graphics is 
a device. Graphics seems more like a program, since it's all in 
software. But in the Apple III, graphics is a device, and it's 
handled just like all the other devices. 

A Basis for Comparison. Some devices are mostly soft- 
ware, like graphics; others are mostly hardware. But most de- 
vices are really a mixture of hardware and software. Consider 
for a moment an Apple II with attached Silentype printer. The 
Silentype connects to the Apple II with a cable that ends in a 
circuit board, and the circuit board is installed in one of the 
slots inside the Apple II. So what the Apple II does is send in- 
formation to a particular slot. The circuit board in that slot 
then picks up the information and sends it on. The circuits and 
software on that attached circuit board are really an integral 
part of the Silentype printer. Information is processed for a 
while on the circuit board before being sent on to the print- 
heads. The circuit board, in effect, functions as a software-type 
intermediary between the Apple n and the printer. 

Now what happens in the Apple HI? In this case, the Silen- 
type plugs directly into the back of the computer. The circuit 
board is gone, but you can't eliminate the software middle- 
man. The Silentype still isn't any smarter; it still needs to have 
that information processing done. But, instead of using a plug- 
in circuit board, the processing in the Apple HI is done by a 
special program in the main computer memory, the driver. 
This driver program is written specifically for its associated 
device and functions only with that device and no other. 

The printer driver is stored on the boot disk, along with 
other drivers for other devices. When the disk is booted, the 
special driver program is loaded into memory right along 
with, and as part of, the rest of the operating system. The 
driver program is not part of the user program; it's hidden 
away where you can't find it or look at it, even if you want to. 
It's the perfect middleman, silent and not too expensive, al- 
though it does take up a couple thousand bytes of RAM. Fortu- 
nately, the Apple HI has quite a lot of RAM. 

The best approach to understanding all of this is to think of 
a driver as being actually part of the device it's associated 
with. Consider it to be a sort of (soft) connecting arm by which 
the device attaches to the computer. And that's really what it 
is — a software plug-in board. Don't be confused by the fact that 
the driver comes on the boot disk and is loaded into RAM. 
Functionally, it's really part of the device. It is even pur- 
chased with the device. If you buy a Winchester hard disk, or a 
clock, or some other goody, it must come with its own driver. 
Part of the job of plugging in a new gadget is plugging in its 
driver. 

Thus each separate device has its own driver. If an Apple 
m has six devices attached, then it must have the correspond- 
ing six drivers in its memory. If a device's driver isn't in place, 
the Apple III considers that device not to exist. Without an ap- 
propriate driver program to go with it, a device is useless. 

On the other hand, it's equally pointless to have a driver 
program in memory, using up available RAM, if you don't own 
the corresponding device or if you don't plan to use the device 
for the program at hand. It's desirable to plug in only those 
drivers needed at the time and to remove others, just as you 
might remove an unused connecting circuit board from its slot 
to make room for another. This is one of the jobs accom- 
plished by the System Configuration Program, which we'll talk 
about shortly. 

Name That Driver. So how, then, does a program get in 
touch with a driver? That's simple ; it calls the driver by name. 
Since all contact with the outside is done through the various 
drivers, the program can use the very same method for all. 
This is a great simplification. With the Apple m, the program 
never needs to worry about where a device is located, what slot 
it's attached to, how it likes its data cooked, or anything else. 
That's for the driver to worry about. The program just calls 
whichever driver it wants, by name. 

Okay. So what name? Well, the program must use the ap- 



propriate pathname. "Aha!" you say, "and what is a path- 
name?" Well, a pathname is an elaborate sort of a filename, 
which is . . . Why don't we just start with a file? 

What the computer does all day, when it's not Just waiting 
around, is process chunks of information. It stores a lot of these 
collections of information right in its main memory. These 
chunks of information are not files. They have names like ar- 
rays, stacks, and variables. And since they are in memory, 
they are all immediately available to the central processor. 
They are already inside. 

But certain other collections of information are stored out- 
side the computer, on disks, tapes, and whatnot. These are 
files. To deal with these outside collections, the central proc- 
essor must arrange to have them brought inside. Later on, af- 
ter processing, such a collection may be returned outside to its 
storage area. This is "intake and output" (I/O). A file is any 
external collection of information that might get involved in 
I/O. 

The usual way one encounters files is to see them listed by 
name in a disk catalog. We usually tend to think of a file as a 
specific chunk of information stored on a disk. 

If we think a little harder, though, we can also picture a file 
as a string of data bytes, a linear or one-dimensional array, 
similar to a long train of cars on a railroad track. The essen- 
tial point is that all the small pieces of data are arranged one 
after another in a succession. And, being human, we can also 
visualize the train from above ; that is, we can see the train (or 
file) as a whole. Because of this ability to picture a file's length 
and composition, we tend to think of a file as an object. 

The View from the Middle. Computers have no such abili- 
ty. They process information one byte at a time. In some 
larger computers a byte may have 16 or 32 or more bits. But 
even this byte size is still a very small amount of data. Gen- 
erally speaking, computers hack away one very small slice at 
a time. Of course they hack very rapidly. 

When the central processor receives input from a file, the 
data comes pouring in one byte after another. It's like stand- 
ing in the mouth of a railroad tunnel as a train comes forth, car 
after car. The computer's viewpoint is always from the mid- 
dle of the track. It doesn't see the whole train as an object. It 
just sees the next car in line. The different tunnels (or files) all 
look much alike; they just have different names, the file- 
names. So the computer sees all files the same way. 

From the computer's point of view, anything is a file if it is 
a hole in the outside wall through which a stream of data pours 
in or into which a stream of data can be made to disappear. 

Thus they keyboard is a file — data comes from it. And the 
screen is a file — data goes out to it. And disks and printers and 
speakers are also files. All the computer sees is a hole, with 
data flowing in or out. And in the Apple m, as we have seen, all 
I/O takes place through middlemen, the drivers. So in the Ap- 
ple in, the drivers also are files. 

Since a file is just a collection of information, it's perfectly 
possible to make a collection of collections. And this larger col- 
lection is also a file. In this way it's possible to construct a 
branching family tree of files, sub/files, and sub/sub/files. The 
slash is used here to separate the various levels because that's 
the way Apple IH likes it written. An example of such a hier- 
archy of files might be : 

Disk Catalog File type- (for humans only) 

DISK1 Volume or device 
FRUITS Directory 
ORANGE File 
PEAR File 
APPLE Subdirectory 
RED File 
GREEN File 
VEGETABLE Directory 
POTATO File 
SQUASH File 
MEAT File 

In the Apple ni a file's name is its complete name: 
/DISK1 /FRUITS/APPLE/RED. This is a compound name

The 
Softalk Cruise 



Leaves June 5th! 




The time to act Is immediately. Reservations are due by March 15. Softalk will express mail information to any- 
one who calls our office inquiring about the Softalk cruise before this date. Don't wait, call today. 

A week can be a long time and seven days is what you get on the Softalk cruise. For seven days you can get 
away from the daily grind, shake off the chill of winter, thrill to spectacular scenery, and, most important, learn 
more about your Apple computer. 

You and Your Apple are invited to take part in a great adventure that will present a challenging curriculum in a 
relaxing environment. The time is early June and the place is the magnificent Pacific Northwest, seen from the 
land and from the deck of the luxurious Sun Princess. 

Beginning in Vancouver, British Columbia, the Softalk cruise will visit the ports of Juneau, Skagway, and Ketchi- 
kan. It will also explore the wonders of Glacier Bay and Misty Fjord, returning to Vancouver at the end of a 
week. During the cruise there will be seminars offering Apple owners and their computers the opportunity to 
learn from the masters. Ken Williams, creator of hi-res adventures and other mischiefs, will illustrate sophisti- 
cated graphics techniques. Roger Wagner, bestselling author of Softalk's Assembly Lines column and a crooner 
of some renown in the San Diego area, will investigate advanced assembly language programming. Dennis 
Goodrow, co-author of Expediter II, the bestselling Applesoft compiler, will enlighten Basic programmers of the 
uses and abuses of compilers. 

The latest addition to this list of all-stars is Mark Pelczarski, author of the popular Complete Graphics System 
and Special Effects. He'll delve into the mysteries of Basic and instruct those present on how to program their own 
database. 

For those not in the seminars, Cheryl Pelczarski has graciously offered to teach water color painting. 

You can meet all these people, see some of the most beautiful scenery north of Silicon Gulch, learn more about 
your computer, and escape from the daily grind all at the same time. Sound great? 

If it does, you'd better move fast because time has almost run out. You've only got a matter of days to sign on, so 
now is the time for action. Please call or write for the necessary information and cost of the cruise to: 



Softalk Cruise 
Attention: Jo Hilliard 
11021 Magnolia Boulevard 
North Hollywood, CA 91601 
213-980-5074 




This tour is exclusively arranged for SoHalk readers by Valencia Plaza Travel Agency of Newhall, California. Roger Wagner, Ken Williams, Dennis 
Goodrow, and Mark Pelczarski are committed to giving seminars on this cruise unless extraordinary business contingencies arise.

constructed of the local name at the rightmost end, preceded 
by the names of each successively larger collection of which it 
is a part. The leftmost name is the name of the root of the tree. 
Thus the complete (compound) name of a file forms a path- 
way to the file through the family tree. So it is called a 
pathname. 

Organizationally Speaking. To make things easier for hu- 
mans, the leftmost component of the pathname is often re- 
ferred to as a volume name or a device name. The rightmost 
component is the local filename. And the names in between, if 
any, are directories and sub/directories and sub/sub/direc- 
tories. This makes the organization of a floppy disk more obvi- 
ous to humans. But to the computer they are all files. 

There are rules for constructing the separate component 
filenames: Length must be no more than fifteen characters. 
Only digits, letters and periods are allowed. Lower case is auto- 
matically capitalized. No blanks are allowed. Filenames must 
start with a letter. A filename standing alone is preceded by a 
slash if it is a volume name (a particular disk) , a period if it is 
a device name (really the driver, of course) , and nothing if it is 
a local filename. When filenames are put together into a path- 
name, successive names are separated by slashes, and the 
leftmost name is preceded by a slash (volume name) or a peri- 
od (device name). 

To contact the printer, for example, the program would use 
the name .PRINTER (note the initial period). The name 
.AUDIO will direct output data to the speaker, and 
/RECIPES/DESSERTS/APPLE.PIE refers to the local file 
APPLE.PIE in the directory DESSERTS on the floppy 
disk named RECIPES. 

Human nature being what it is, most of us immediately at- 
tempt to invent impossible pathnames, such as 
.PRINTER/SUBDIR/LOCFILE. This doesn't work. Printers, 
keyboards, speakers, and so on are character devices. That is, 
they send or receive one character at a time but do not store 
blocks of data that we humans recognize as separate entities. 
So it makes no sense to talk about a subdirectory of a printer. 
Only block devices are allowed directories and subdirectories. 
But those clever folks who designed the system knew you 
would try it anyway, so they armed SOS with a whole arsenal 
of error messages. 

Apple III does, of course, have block devices: the floppy 
disks. It comes with one floppy drive built into the box, and it 
only takes about two seconds (and some cash) to add as many 
as three more. These floppy disk drives are obviously devices 
and are addressed, using the usual pathname conventions, 
with the device names .Dl, .D2, and so on. Presumably the 
disk drives also have a software driver program in SOS just as 
all the other devices do. But this driver is unremovable, al- 
ways present, and transparent. This means it can be ignored 
(which is a good thing because the imagination staggers at the 
confusion of names in a disk drive driver). 

Just as one can address .PRINTER, so one can address .Dl 
and get whatever disk is currently in that disk drive. If you 
can't remember the disk's volume name but know that there is a 
file on the disk called GOOD.STUFF, you can get to it with the 
pathname .Dl/GOOD.STUFF. Or you can list all the contents 
of a disk in drive 2 with the Business Basic command: cat .d2. 

A more common occurrence might be that you want a pro- 
gram to talk to GOOD.STUFF on the disk named /MYPRO- 
GRAMS, but you don't know which drive that disk will be in 
during future program runs. No problem. Just use the name 
/M YPROGRAMS/GOOD . STUFF and the operating system 
will search through all the disk drives to find it. In other words, 
when communicating with disks you can begin the pathname 
with either a device name (.Dl) or a volume name (/MYPRO- 
GRAMS) , whichever is more convenient. 

Prefix Paves the Way. In its never-ending effort to make 
things easy, the Apple III has yet another handy feature for 
pathnames. This is the prefix (or in Business Basic, the PRE- 
FDC$) . The prefix consists of some or most of the beginning of 
a pathname. The user sets the prefix to part of the route. Then 
you need type only the local filename, and the operating sys- 



tem will insert the prefix. Suppose, for example, you want to 
talk to /FOODS/FRUITS/APPLES/RED and also to 
/FOODS/FRUITS/ APPLES/BAD . 
Just set the prefix (from Basic) : 

)PREFIX$ = "/FOODS/FRUITS/APPLES" 

Now you just use the local filename RED or BAD and SOS will 
automatically add the prefix (and the necessary slash for a 
separator) . The rule is : If the given name starts with a slash or 
a period, it is taken to be a complete pathname. Otherwise the 
prefix is added. Although the prefix is not strictly necessary, it 
is certainly a great convenience, and, once you've got a grip on 
pathnames, the prefix is very easy to set and use. 

In the Apple III, every disk has a volume name. It is named 
during the initial formatting process, although the name can 
subsequently be changed if desired. Whenever a disk is boot- 
ed, the prefix is initially set to the volume name of that par- 
ticular disk. So the prefix is always set to something, unless, 
out of appalling perversity, you set it to nothing with: 

)PREFIX$="" 

The prefix is among those ultimately convenient features 
that are terribly confusing to the newcomer. One can suffer 
considerable frustration before it is clear why THISFILE is ac- 
ceptable on one occasion and .D2 /THISFILE is required on an- 
other. Finally one realizes that the system is adding this mys- 
terious prefix, which is set correctly on the first occasion but 
inappropriately on the second. 

You may have noticed that we have gradually stopped talk- 
ing about driver names and started talking about device 
names. They are really the same thing. Drivers are named for 
the devices they serve and can, in practice, simply be ignored. 
One just pretends to talk to the device. This is okay because a 
driver is functionally transparent. Its services are needed but 
are not readily apparent. Only when you want to make 
changes in drivers — to add or delete or modify a driver — do 
you need to deal directly with the drivers themselves. And that 
job is accomplished by means of the System Configuration 
Program. 

The System Configuration Program (SCP). The Apple III 
comes with a variety of goodies, one of which is a floppy disk 
labeled System Utilities that contains a variety of housekeep- 
ing facilities. With this disk, you may easily format (initialize) 
disks, copy disks, rename volumes and files, and transfer or 
delete individual files and groups of files. All these things are 
done in a very straightforward manner. But the utilities disk 
also contains the System Configuration Program for manipu- 
lating drivers. 

The SCP is not quite so simple to deal with as the rest of utili- 
ties disk, especially for an Apple III novice. It has gone through 
several revisions intended to make it friendlier and easier to 
use. The latest version comes with "System Software 1.1" and 
is the version discussed in this article. While the SCP seems 
complex, in reality, it is difficult only if you have not yet 
mastered the rules for pathnames or you don't clearly view the 
driver as a software "plug-in board" that belongs to the de- 
vice. When pathnames and drivers are clearly understood, the 
SCP is quite easy to use. 

As we have already seen, every device has associated with 
it a driver program that is used by the central processor as a 
middleman for contacting the device. These driver programs 
are stored on the boot disk, and when the disk is booted, they 
are loaded into memory along with, and as part of, the operat- 
ing system (SOS) . If six devices are to be used, then the cor- 
responding six driver programs must all be available on the 
boot disk and be successfully loaded into the operating system 
portion of memory. 

A Collection of Drivers. The various drivers are not, how- 
ever, stored on the disk as individual files. They are gathered 
together in a single basket, a file whose name is SOS. DRIV- 
ER. When one catalogs a boot disk, SOS.DRTVER must ap- 
pear somewhere on the list, although it doesn't matter where. 
But a file of that name must be present if a disk is to boot sue- 



140

cessfully. The collection of drivers contained In this basket will 
then be loaded into memory and the drivers made available 

for use. 

The name SOS. DRIVER is a bit unfortunate because it is 
not immediately obvious that this is a collection of drivers 
rather than something which somehow drives SOS. SOS.DRIV- 
ERSET might have been a happier choice. 

It's important to realize that SOS.DRIVER is a typical disk 
file. It can, for example, be copied to another disk or to the 
same disk under another filename. Or it can simply be re- 
named. Thus you can have two separate copies of the same 
driver collection on the same disk at the same time. Which- 
ever is named SOS.DRIVER is the collection that will be load- 
ed and brought into service when the disk is booted. Drivers 
are loaded only at boot time. 

The System Configuration Program is a means— the only 
means — of restructuring the driver collection, SOS.DRIVER. 
All changes are made to the disk file, not to the drivers pres- 
ently functioning in the computer. One can add, delete, or 
modify drivers and thereby generate, on the disk, a new and 
different SOS.DRIVER file. Subsequently, when the Apple III 
is rebooted, this new system configuration will be loaded into 
memory and will begin to function. 

To start the System Configuration Program one merely 
boots the utilities disk and selects S from the main menu. The 
SCP menu soon appears, and the first item on this menu is 
"Read a Driver File." At this point, a further word of ex- 
planation is in order. 

Operating System Memory versus Program Memory. 
When you boot the utilities disk, some drivers — used by the utili- 
ties disk programs — are loaded into the computer. But these 
drivers are placed in the operating system portion of memory, 
which is separate from program memory. Program memory 
is the storage area for strings and arrays and other data used 
by the program. As a rule, programs can access only the data 
in program memory, not areas reserved for the operating sys- 



tem. Thus when the SCP starts running, there are, initially, no 
drivers in the program memory. They are still on the disk, or 
scattered around on several disks. So the first step in custom- 
izing a new SOS.DRIVER file is to read into program memory 
all the drivers you want to have in your new system. 

When you select "Read a Driver File" from the SCP menu 
you are asked to give the pathname of a file containing driv- 
ers. This can be the SOS.DRIVER collection from one of the 
boot disks, or some other file containing one or more drivers. 
The utilities disk itself, being a boot disk, has some drivers in 
its SOS.DRIVER file. The following table shows the drivers 
present on various (unmodified) Apple III disks: 

/BASIC/SOS.DRIVER /PASCAL 1 /SOS.DRIVER /UTILITIES/SOS.DRIVER 



.SILENTYPE 

.AUDIO 

.PRINTER

+.FMTD3 

+.FMTD4 

.SILENTYPE 

.PRINTER 

.CONSOLE 



The .FMTD1..4 drivers on the utilities disk are really all one 
unit. They are used to format disks in the respective drives. 
The .CONSOLE driver controls both keyboard and video 
screen, so it's difficult to imagine any useful configuration 
without it. In addition to these collections of drivers, the utili- 
ties data disk contains each of the above drivers as an individ- 
ual file (CONSOLE.DRIVER, and so on) . 

The Silentype printer comes with a disk that contains two 
different Silentype drivers: BIG.DRIVER and SMALL.DRIV- 
ER. The big driver can type in three different type fonts but 
occupies some fifteen hundred bytes more memory. 

Any other devices you may purchase come with their own 
drivers. The Apple ProFile hard disk, for example, comes with 
a disk containing a file named PROFILE. DRIVER.

The l-PROTECT shield is a slightly tinted, trans- 
parent, 6 mm. sheet of leaded hi-impact 
acrylic. The lead equivalency is .3 mm., which 
provides more than 97% shielding of any 
radiation emitted through the monitor or tele- 
vision screen. In addition, l-PROTECT enhances 
the visual acuity of the display image with a 
slight magnification, thus reducing eye strain. 
The light tint also reduces glare. 
OTHER INFORMATION: 

This acrylic shield is easy to cut, drill or shape 
to fit any terminal or television set, and is 
easily cleaned with" a plastic cleaner. The 
product is shipped with Velcro fasteners for 
easy attachment. 

l-PROTECT will provide on-site consultation and 
customization for multi-terminal installations.

If you answer the "Read a Driver File" prompt with an ap- 
propriate pathname, such as (.D2/SOS.DRIVER, /BASIC/ 
SOS.DRIVER, /MYDISK/CONFIGUR.l) the drivers con- 
tained in that file will be copied into program memory and list- 
ed on the screen. Additional files are then successively read, as 
desired, and their contents will be shown added to the list. If 
two or more collections of drivers are read, there will un- 
doubtedly be duplications. Use the "Delete a Driver" option to 
remove duplicates and other unwanted drivers from the list. In 
this way, by adding and deleting drivers, you end up with a list 
containing only those drivers you wish to have in the new sys- 
tem configuration. 

System Parameters. A complete and proper SOS.DRIVER 
package also contains one other set of data that is not a driver 
but is similar. It does not appear on the screen in the list of 
drivers. This set of data is the System Parameters and con- 
tains information for the Apple III operating system : 

System Parameters: 

1. Number of Disk III drives 

2. Peripheral slot assignments (for those devices using 

cards installed in the expansion slots) 

3. Character set (several different sets available) 

4. Keyboard layout (which keys shall be where) 

. The information in System Parameters can be changed by 
selecting that option from the menu and following subsequent 
instructions. The parameters will then automatically be in- 
cluded in the new SOS.DRrVER package being constructed. 

When you read various drivers into program memory, at 
least one of the files used will probably be a previous 
SOS.DRIVER file. In that case, a set of System Parameters 
will already be present. They are read in from the first 
SOS.DRrVER file selected, and can then be modified using the 
"Change System Parameters" option. On the other hand, if all 
the drivers have been read in individually (from the Utilities 
Data disk, for example) , then you must also separately load a 
character set and a keyboard layout,, specify slot assign- 
ments, and specify the number of disk drives in the system. All 
of that is done via the "Change System Parameters" option. 

Drivers themselves may also be modified, and that is done 
with the "Edit Driver Parameters" option. All drivers, of 
course, have names. That's how they are contacted. But the 
name of a driver can be changed to almost anything you de- 
sire, as long as it begins with a period and follows the usual file- 
name rules. Whatever name you assign is the name your pro- 
gram must then use to contact the driver (and its correspond- 
ing device) . If you get tired of typing .SILENTYPE you can 
change it to .SIL or even .S. Remember, however, that in the 
long-run, the most convenient name is one whose meaning will 
be as obvious a month from now as it is today. 

Some drivers have other modifiable features. The printer 
driver, for example, can be set to transmit data to the printer 
at a variety of speeds (baud rates) . This, along with other op- 
tions, allows the printer driver to service printers from vari- 
ous manufacturers. Such options can be changed by altering 
information in the "Configuration Block Data" via the "Edit 
Driver Parameters" option. Configuration block data is stored 
in hexadecimal code, and you must follow the instructions in 
the manuals for that device. 

Generating a New Driver System. When the new 
SOS.DRIVER package is properly configured, it needs to be 
stored on the boot disk to be ready for use. From the SCP menu, 
select "Generate New System." The new system is validated 
to be sure all necessary steps have been carried out. Then 
you're asked for a pathname where the new file should be 
stored. 

The whole point of creating a new driver system is to have 
it function. And in order to function it must be on a boot disk, 
and it must be named SOS.DRIVER. If, at this point, there is 
no such file on the destination disk, the next step is easy. Just 
type /volume/SOS.DRrVER and you're in business. On the 
other hand, the new system is most often a replacement for a 
previous SOS.DRrVER. In that case, the destination disk al- 
ready contains the previous file named SOS.DRrVER. If it's in 



drive 2 and you type .D2/SOS. DRIVER, the disk drives whirr 
for a while and you are asked: 

.D2/SOS. DRIVER already exists. Delete? (Yes/No] 

An affirmative reply deletes the old file and stores the new one 
in its place. If all goes well, you should be able to reboot the Ap- 
ple III with the new system, and it will begin to work. 

There's one danger in the above procedure. In order for a 
boot disk to function, a properly constructed SOS.DRIVER file 
must be present. If, for any reason, the new system you have 
constructed fails to work, you'll no longer have the old 
SOS.DRIVER file to fall back on. Since you are undoubtedly a 
sensible person, you'll have been working with backup disks all 
along, so you'll still have the originals with which to begin 
again if need be. 

Another sensible precaution is to store the new system tem- 
porarily under some other filename. When the "Generate New 
System" prompt asks you where to put it, type .D2/NEW- 
DRIVER. Now you'll have both systems on the disk. Use the 
"Quit" option to leave the SCP, and select "File handling com- 
mands" from the main menu. Rename: 

SOS.DRIVER -> OLDDRIVER and NEWDRIVER -> SOS.DRIVER 

You're now ready to try booting the new system, and if it 
doesn't work, you can always use the utilities program to 
change the names back again. 

Does it all seem terribly complicated? Well, even so, it's 
worth it. Once your new system is up and running, you can just 
concentrate on programming and the Sophisticated Operating 
System will work for you, silently and efficiently. And if you 
should buy some marvelous new gadgets, you can quickly revise 
your system to include them. The energy you devote to working 
through the initial complexity of pathnames and drivers and the 
System Configuration Program is amply compensated by the 
power and versatility of the Apple m. Once you're over the initial 
bumps, it's smooth sailing from then on. H

The Huge-Memory RAM Boards 

BV JEFFREV MAZUR 



Several months ago we examined 
various RAM expansion boards for the 
Apple n. Since the appearance of the 
original 16K language card from Apple, 
a slew of lower priced 16K boards with 
better features have found their way into 
the marketplace. And if 16K was good, 
then 32K or 64K must be better — witness 
the ads for several boards in this range. 

As predicted, however, the race to see 
who can cram the most memory onto one 
card has not stopped there. The follow- 
ing is a report on two new RAM boards: 
the 128K Soft Disk from Legend Indus- 
tries and the 256K App-L-Cache from Sor- 
rento Valley Associates. 

Double Density. Legend Industries, 
manufacturers of the 64K board previ- 
ously reviewed in this column, has pulled 
off a neat trick with the 128K Soft Disk. 
By rearranging things a bit, they have 
been able to fit all 16 RAM chips plus the 



associated circuitry on a board no larger 
than their 64K version. In keeping with 
the usual procedure, this board is In- 
stalled in the computer by removing one 
RAM chip and moving it onto the board. 
A short ribbon cable is then inserted into 
the empty socket on the motherboard. 

From a software standpoint, the Soft 
Disk appears to the system as eight sep- 
arate 16K language cards. Selection of 
the active bank is accomplished by writ- 
ing or poking the appropriate number in- 
to memory location $0084. This is identi- 
cal to the operation of the 64K board. Of 
course, each 16K bank further divides the 
$D000-$E000 block into two sub-banks, as 
per the language card. 

All this bank switching increases the 
amount of time it takes to read or write to 
the card; however, since we are dealing 
with RAM and accessing it via machine 
language routines, response is still rela- 



tively fast. In fact, as its name implies, 
the most significant use of the Soft Disk is 
as a disk emulator. With the software 
provided, it is possible to load an entire 
floppy disk into the Soft Disk. Informa- 
tion can then be read, modified, sorted, 
or whatever at three to ten times the 
normal disk access speed. If necessary, 
the new information in the Soft Disk can 
then be downloaded back onto floppy disk 
with one simple command. 

There's one catch, however. While 
you're working with the RAM image of 
the disk stored in the Soft Disk, a power 
failure or computer glitch can wipe out 
any changes you made since you last 
saved the information to disk. The moral 
of this, as always: update often. 

Installation and operation of the disk 
emulator is similar to that described for 
Legend's 64K board, except that now an 
entire disk worth of information fits onto

a single card. Previously, this required 
either two 64K boards, taking up two 
slots, or specially formatted "half- 
disks." Up to four Soft Disk cards can be 
installed in different slots, each emulat- 
ing a disk drive with any given slot and 
drive number. 

The Soft Disk comes with the disk 
emulator software, Memory Master (a 
utility that moves DOS onto the RAM 
board), and a 44-page manual. A firm- 
ware selector program is also included 
that allows Applesoft or Integer ROM 
card owners the option of installing their 
ROM board into any slot of the Apple. In 
this way, one can have both languages in 
ROM without having to give up some of 
the RAM board to hold the alternative 
language. Price of the entire system is 
$750; this includes Disk Emulator soft- 
ware for either DOS 3.3, Pascal, or CPM. 
The other operating system emulators 
can be purchased for $50 extra. 

Oink Oink. Cramming 256K of RAM 
(that's 32 chips!) onto a single Apple- 
sized peripheral board would seem to be 
an impossibility. However, Sorrento Val- 
ley Associates has done the impossible by 
designing a piggyback, two-board sys- 



tem that plugs into slot 0. 

The main board contains 64K of RAM 
plus all of the associated circuitry neces- 
sary to interface it to the Apple's memo- 
ry space. You'll also find 2K of EPROM 
on this board that contains some useful 
routines for controlling the RAM selec- 
tion (interesting indeed, as this is the only 
RAM board to contain such firmware ; in 
fact, it is the only board we know of that 
resides in slot 0 and uses the 2K ROM ex- 
pansion space between C800-CFFF) . 

The main board itself is fairly large, 
extending almost to the keyboard. At- 
tached to the back of this board, just to 
the left, is the piggyback expansion with 
the remaining 192K. Together they make 
a nice, neat package, taking up only one 
slot. Since the App-L-Cache must be in- 
stalled in slot 0, it would appear that you 
are restricted to only "one per 
customer." Installation of the board is 
similar to the installation of other RAM 
boards except that two IC's are removed 
from the motherboard and replaced by 
jumpers. 

By the way, if you're wondering 
where they got the name "App-L- 
Cache," it comes from a term used in

larger mini and mainframe comput- 
ers — "cache memory." Cache memory 
refers to a block of very fast memory 
that is used as a buffer between the 
speedy cpu and other slower memory de- 
vices. True cache memory handles this 
buffering automatically, coming into 
play whenever the slower memory is ac- 
cessed. The App-L-Cache, however, will 
most probably be used as a disk emu- 
lator that requires the manual transfer of 
data between disk and RAM. At present, 
this software is available for all Apple 
operating environments — DOS 3.3, Pas- 
cal, and CP/M. 

SVA has also taken a different ap- 
proach in the mapping scheme used by 
the App-L-Cache. They've divided the 
256K of memory into sixty-four banks of 
4K each. Referring to Figure 1, you can 
see that the top three banks occupy the 
space normally used by a language card, 
namely $D000-$FFFF. Note, in particu- 
lar, that the top two banks ($3E and $3F) 
are always mapped into the top 8K of 
RAM. The lower 4K then becomes a 
window through which any of the 64 
banks can be accessed. Bank $3D is the 
default, or front page, while the selected 
bank is referred to as the AUX page. In 
this manner it can be made to resemble 
the language card. Figure 2 gives a com- 
plete description of how the RAM and 
ROM on the App-L-Cache is controlled. 

In terms of software, SVA has done an 
elaborate job of interfacing the App-L- 
Cache to Pascal (1.0 and 1.1). This is 
achieved by adding a special SYS- 
TEM . STARTUP and associated files to 
the boot disk. When the Apple is powered 
up, it can then load Pascal, link in the 
App-L-Cache, and automatically copy 
the contents of a selected disk into RAM. 
In fact, there's even an option by which to 
delete those files that are only used for 
booting, thus freeing up an extra forty- 
seven blocks. To the Pascal operating

pears as two drives in slot 1. Drive 1 is a 
full thirty-five tracks for 140K of storage ; 
drive 2 is only twenty-five tracks or 100K. 
The upper 16K of the RAM board acts 
like a language card. To move files from 
a floppy disk into RAM, either Fid (for 
selective copying) or Apple's Copy utility 
(for an entire disk) can be used. It takes 
about twenty-nine seconds to load in an 
entire disk using Copy. 

At press time, SVA announced that 
they will soon support full disk transfer to 
and from the App-L-Cache in DOS 3.3. 

To get some feeling for the speed of 
App-L-Cache, we copied the DOS 3.3 Sys- 
tem Master from Apple into it. Then we 
compared the time it took to verify all of 
the files on this disk using Fid. This is a 
good test since it requires a lot of disk ac- 
cess. For the floppy disk version, this 
task was accomplished in about fifty sec- 
onds. When the same command was is- 
sued to the emulated disk, it finished in 
less than five seconds — ten times faster! 
The only thing lacking with DOS opera- 
tion is a utility to download the entire 
RAM image back onto a floppy disk. If 
Fid is used, it will take forever because of 
having to stop at each file to answer the 
prompt lines. Copy can be used, but that 
entails the overhead of initializing the 
disk again. Presumably, other copy pro- 
grams could also be used, but a fast, sim- 
ple update utility would be welcome. 

The App-L-Cache is available from 
Sorrento Valley Associates. Price of the 
entire system including 256K board, disks 



for all operating systems, and a loose- 
leaf style manual is $1,345. The main 
board (64K) is also available separately 
and can be expanded later on to the full 
256K. 

A Bug Uncovered. While some of the 
RAM boards were being tested for this 
series of articles, a peculiar problem was 
discovered. Several manufacturers 
claim that it is possible to use more than 
one RAM or ROM board in any combina- 
tion of slots. This becomes important 
when both languages are desired along 
with full disk emulation. While at first 
this idea may seem reasonable, certain 
boards may not work. 

Take for example the Apple Lan- 
guage System Card. In addition to being 
a 16K RAM board, it also contains an auto- 
start Monitor ROM. Therefore, when- 
ever the RAM is not active, this ROM 
takes over the $F800-$FFFF space. In 
fact, because of this, the Monitor ROM on 
the motherboard is never used and can 
even be removed. From this discussion, 
it is obvious that the language card can- 
not be completely "turned off" from the 
$F800-$FFFF space and therefore will 
conflict with any board in another slot 
that tries to use this space. 

Our first attempt to run such a com- 
bination of cards was unsuccessful; the 
computer would just hang up whenever 
the RAM card was accessed. Because we 
had a modified language card (see 
"Make Your Apple More Flexible," 
Softalk, December 1981), it was possible 



to disable the language card's ROM, at 
which point the problem disappeared. 
Since no mention of any incompatibility 
was made in the instruction manual, we 
contacted the manufacturer about this. 
The company was unaware of any prob- 
lems and insisted that their board could 
be used simultaneously with a language 
card. We tried their board in several 
other Apples and found that it worked in 
every machine except the original one. 

After scrutinizing both the hardware 
and software, we came to the following 
conclusion: Although technically speak- 
ing the memory conflict described above 
does exist, it appears that the RAM board 
is capable of overriding the language 
board's PROM. This is probably so be- 
cause the RAM board drives the data bus 
through a high-current bus driver IC. 
Simply stated, this chip has more power 
to put its information on the bus while 
swamping out the signals coming from 
the language card. 

Although this answers the question of 
why this arrangement works on almost 
all Apples (we may have the only Apple 
on which it doesn't) , it also indicates that 
there may be a reduction in the comput- 
er's reliability and/or component life. 
Therefore we recommend that you elimi- 
nate this condition. 

Fortunately, the solution is quite sim- 
ple. For the language card, it involves the 
addition of a single switch as outlined in 
the aforementioned article. Applesoft

MAJ^CH mCftp MAGIC 



For some, the annual West Coast Computer Faire in San Francisco is a unique educa- 
tional opportunity with hundreds of conferences to attend and exhibits to study. For others, 
it is a place to meet with the top minds in the microcomputer industry and exchange new 
ideas. Still others attend the fair just to get a sneak preview of new products soon to be re- 
leased onto the market. And many, no matter which they come for, also claim the fair to be 
the social event of the year in the microcomputer world. 

The Seventh West Coast Computer Faire seems to be all that and more, with everything 
from tutorials for novices to state of the art technical presentations for the expert. Held the 
third weekend of March at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium, the West Coast Computer 
Faire is the largest trade exhibit of microcomputers for end users in the United States. 

This year's fair boasts more than one hundred conference speakers and about six 
hundred auditorium exhibits. "And with that many presentations and demonstrations, you 
cover everything in sight," says Jim Warren, the creator and yearly coordinator of the 
event. 

Warren's hardly exaggerating. Just for starters, some of the topics to be discussed in- 
clude "Biomedical Applications of Computers," "Micros in Local Government," "Legal 
Issues," "Software Protection," "Inexpensive Expansion of Your 6502," "Computers in 
Speed Reading," "Enhancing Your Apple II," "Bionic Speech Processing as an Alterna- 
tive to More Traditional Forms of Speech Recognition," "Computer Networks in the United 
Kingdom," "Micro Based Geographical Informational Systems," and "How To Use the 
Computer To Design Tiffany Lamps." 

Approximately six hundred booths will display computer applications in music, pre- 
school education, agriculture, home, business, and much more. There will be booths selling 
everything from computer systems and computer components to computer T-shirts. 

Warren expects between twenty-five thousand and forty thousand visitors to the fair 
from all over the United States as well as large groups of enthusiasts from Australia, 
Canada, Japan, and South America. 

The average West Coast Computer Faire attendee, according to Warren, may be from 
any of a wide range of careers and interests. "We usually attract the serious hobbyist, 
computer or electronic professionals, and people who are using the computer as an infor- 
mation processor in their profession or avocation. A lot of people also come because they 
realize computers are the future and they'd better learn about them." 

Warren, who is himself a computer professional, first conceived the idea of the West 
Coast Computer Faire back in 1976, about the time when microcomputers were first coming 
into existence. He originally intended it to be a swap meet and considered Stanford Uni- 
versity as a possible site. When his request to use Stanford's facilities was turned down, 
Warren briefly considered taking over a nearby field, but he settled for the San Francisco 
Civic Auditorium, which had, among other things, electrical outlets. And when thirteen 
thousand people crowded into the first show during the spring of 1977, Warren knew he had 
created much more than the average swap meet. 

"People are interested in learning all they can about their micros," Warren explains. "If 
computerists with good ideas just knew about the other people doing similar things in the 
same fields, they could get together, learn from each other, and do things that much 
better. 

"The conference program is the value of the fair. The major feature is an opportunity to 
exchange significant technical information." 

And what does Warren see in the future? The Eighth Annual West Coast Computer 
Faire, of course! 

"The only thing larger is the National Computer Conference in Illinois," admits Warren. 
"It's the largest in the world, but it's about big computers only— the Univac, IBM, PDP. My 
show is for owners of micros — the real computers." 

The Seventh West Coast Computer Faire is being held March 19, 20, and 21 at the San 
Francisco Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. A $15 pass covers admission to all three days 
of the show. 31

They said it couldn't be done. 



There were doubters, critics, jealous competitors, and even the author himself. 

But against all odds, the greatest feat since Joe DiMaggio's fifty-six game hitting streak has finally been completed. Worthy to be called one of the seven 
wonders of the modern world, Assembly Lines: The Book can no longer be called Assembly Lines: The Fable. 

This magnificent obsession of Roger Wagner's consists of reprints of his popular Softalk Assembly Lines column from October '80 through December '81. 
Laboring mightily, Wagner has fleshed out and made additions to these fifteen columns. Like some benign deity of old, Wagner has also bestowed on us 
mortals a veritable pantheon of an appendix that expands heroically on the original material. 

If you are one of the victims that benefited from Softalk's honesty when we failed to deliver the book earlier, then now is the time to try again. We won't 
return your money this time. You'll get either Assembly Lines: The Book or two shares of stock in Slipshod Software. 

If you held off until you could actually see a copy of Wagner's book then the wait is over. Of course you still can't exactly see a copy, not unless you go to 
the West Coast Computer Faire in San Francisco, March 19-21, where there will be advance copies for display and sale. 

Take our word for it. Assembly Lines: The Book will dazzle your mind and thrill your computer. Imagine being able to say that you were the first person on 
your block to have Roger Wagner's book. Your neighbors will be pea green with envy as they see you learning assembly language programming at a basic 
level while they are stuck playing Bloodbath or tackling VisiGrind. 

Worth more than a chance to perform on stage with the Rolling Stones, Assembly Lines: The Book costs a low low $19.95, plus $1.50 for postage and 
handling. 

This is not a deal to be passed up. Send in your order and payment now and your knowledge of microcomputers will never be the same again.

Everyone's Guide to Assembly 
Language, Part 18 



Last month we examined the techniques for passing data 
back and forth between Applesoft and machine language in the 
form of standard Applesoft variables. This was greatly facili- 
tated by the use of the already existing internal Applesoft rou- 
tines. A natural extension of this idea is to use other internal 
Applesoft routines as may be appropriate to our given task. 
One of the most interesting applications of this is in the area of 
hi-res graphics, as indicated by recent correspondence to this 
magazine. 

There are two main reasons for doing hi-res graphics from 
machine language. The first and most obvious is speed. By do- 
ing many of the operations directly in machine language, the 
basic overhead (so to speak) of Applesoft is avoided, thus pro- 
ducing a noticeable speed increase in the overall program. Be 
aware however, that since we are still ultimately calling Ap- 
plesoft routines, the speed increase has a certain limit. Great- 
er speeds are obtained only by creating specialized and dedi- 
cated routines that perform only a specific function. The nor- 
mal Applesoft routines are designed to be flexible and to occu- 
py a minimum of space. Faster routines will do less and possi- 
bly be larger in terms of memory use. The trade-off must be 
weighed. 

The second reason is simply the convenience of being able 
to do the same things, including graphics, from machine lan- 
guage, that you are able to do from Basic. To this end, the tech- 
niques presented in this article should be quite adequate. In fu- 
ture issues, we'll explore the creation of specialized routines 
that give higher speed and independence from the Applesoft 
routines. 

Ground School. Before jumping into the intricate details of 
the various routines, we'll impose upon your patience long 
enough to describe briefly the model of Apple hi-res graphics 
used for the current discussion. This may seem unnecessary, 
but it will provide the common ground for the points to be 
made in this particular presentation. As you'll see in later is- 
sues, there are a number of different ways of looking at the to- 
tal screen environment. 

For the time being, we'll use an approximation of what is 
usually viewed as the "classical" explanation of the hi-res 
screen in figure 1. 

The array of possible points to be plotted consists of a field 
of 192 lines, each of which is made up of 280 points. If a mixed 
mode of graphics plus text is selected, only 180 graphics lines 
are displayed. On the majority of Apples, six colors are avail- 
able: black, white, green, violet, orange, and blue. 

The colors have been assigned to eight numeric values, as 
follows : 



Set 1 

0 = Block 1 

1 = Green 

2 = Violet 

3 = White 1 



Set 2 

4 = Bloek2 

5 = Orange 

6 = Blue 

7 = White2 



each other (green/violet or orange/blue) . Black, when specifi- 
cally plotted, is done by turning off two adjacent color dots. 

The model gets shaky when we have to tell you that things 
like "odd colors" (green or orange) can only be plotted at odd 
x-coordinates (1,3,5...), and that "even colors" (blue or violet) 
can only be plotted at even x-coordinates (0,2,4...). It gets even 
worse, but we'll save the horror stories for next month. For the 
time being, you'll have many fewer headaches if you limit 
yourself to using the colors from only set 1 or set 2. Even bet- 
ter, stick to black and white for the time being, and fewer mys- 
terious things will happen. 

Landmarks. A number of the fundamental hi-res routine 
entry points are more or less documented in various publica- 
tions relating to the Apple. A brief summary is given here:

Not Just Software 
But The 
Company 
Behind It. . . 



INDUSTRY PIONEERS 

Southwestern Dora Systems has been o 
pioneer in producing innovative software 
for the Apple II since its inception in the 
late 1970's when they entered the software 
marketplace with the introduction of 
Roger Wagner's APPLE-DOC and THE 
CORRESPONDENT. Mounting soles and 
interest contributed to the company's expan- 
sion including a truly professional staff, 
combining quality and reliability with both 
product and support perpetuating their 
special insight into realizing and satisfying 
consumer needs. 

From the outset, they established a MONEY- 
BACK GUARANTEE as evidence of their 
dedication to supplying only the finest quality 
products available. Software of such un- 
compromising quality became the corner- 
stone for their success and is the reason for 
their recognition as an industry leader today. 

SOFTWARE SPECIALISTS 

Minimal scrutiny will reveal SDS software to 
be the ripest, juiciest fruit on the proverbial 
apple software tree. Succulent appetizers 
like A.C.E., Z-TERM, APPLE-DOC, ASCII EXPRESS 
and LISTMA5TER have already established 
SDS as the UTILITY AND COMMUNICATIONS 
SOFTWARE SPECIALISTS! But that's only the 
beginning! SDS is bursting at the seams with 
a bumper crop of quality software just 
recently made available! They're sensa- 
tional! Have a byte of: 

ASCII EXPRESS - The Professional: The 

advanced version of the classic com- 
munications package. 

THE ROUTINE MACHINE: Allows anyone to 
put machine language in their Applesoft 
programs. 

DOUDLETIME PRINTER: Print files while 
simultaneously running another program. 



MUNCH-A-DUG: Easily de-bug machine 
language programs. 

MERLIN: A full featured 6502 macro 
assembler. 

UNIVERSAL GRAPHICS: Now you can print 
any Hi-Res image on almost any printer. 

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM II: The best 
home and small business accounting 
package available. 

NORAD: A fast moving Hi-Res arcade game. 

These recent releases nor only include 
superior utility and communications software 
but illustrate the SDS advance into the 
business and education computer game 
fields. The full line of SDS products are pro- 
fessionally and attractively packaged and 
should be available to the retail customer for 
inspection through your local dealer, or write 
to SDS for your complementary product 
guide. Dealers should contact Joanne 
Johnson regarding promotional materials 
and software samplers. 

THE PEOPLE 

SDS is more than just a list of products though. 
It's the people that make the difference. 
Together, the entire staff at SDS will continue 
to offer you, the software user, the highest

Motion. So much for discussions of elementary graphing. If 
you understood the first example of drawing the border on the 
screen, all this is already known to you. The reason we men- 
tion it is to prepare you for the next idea, the one of motion. 

When something is moving, we say it has a velocity. Ve- 
locity has only two components, direction and magnitude. That 
is to say that the only things we have to worry about when 
simulating a moving object are its speed and direction of 
travel. Speed is measured in units of distance per unit of time. 
In the case of our screen display, something moving from point 
A to point B in one second would have a speed of +5 units per 
second. Likewise for something moving from A to C. Negative 
values are used to indicate something moving in a direction op- 
posite the given coordinate system. An object moving from B 
to A in one second would have a speed of -5 units per second. 

Now at this point you may find yourself tempted to throw up 
your hands and say, "I can tell where he's going and it doesn't 
sound fun!" You might think you're going to plunge deeper

Just fill out a simple form like this 



To create professional-looking menus like this. 



Picture this: 

You sit down at your Apple II and boot your 
own custom system disk. 

A "menu ' of numbered options appears. 
Perhaps one says "RUN FILE DEVELOPER." 
Another says "BOOT 13 SECTOR DISK." Other 
options you've defined might be "GAMES" and 
"HOME FINANCES." 

Say you select "GAMES"— just by entering 
a single digit. 

Immediately, another menu appears listing 
the games you own. If the one you select is on a 
different disk, the computer requests you to 
insert that disk and press a key to run it. 

If this sounds like a convenient way to use 
your computer system, you're right. 

If it also sounds like a lot of work to 
program, you're right again. 

Until now. 

Introducing the MENU GENERATOR. 

Now creating your own custom menus is as 
simple as filling out a form on your computer 
screen . 

Just run the MENU GENERATOR, and tell 
it what you want each menu option to say, and 
what action to take when that option is selected. 
You can RUN or BRUN a program, boot another 
disk, execute user— written BASIC statements, or 
perform any valid DOS operation. 

MENU GENERATOR will compile your 
entries into a neat, attractively-formatted screen 
menu, then automatically write a documented, 
bug-free Applesoft program to generate and process 
the menu. 

You can list , copy , and modify this program 
if you want to add your own touches . A single disk 
will hold data for up to 150 different menus. 



Make it easy on others, too! 

If you write programs that other people are 
going to use , you'll find that a few good menus are 
worth 100 pages of instructions. You'll be 
thankful , too, when you put the program aside for 
a couple of months and then try to use it again! 

Pays for itself the first time you use it. 

Using the MENU GENERATOR should save 
at least 95% of the time you'd spend writing your 
own menu program . At just $39.95, can you afford 
not to have this great labor saver working for 
you? 

MENU GENERATOR comes complete with 
program disk, backup disk, and 40-page manual. 
It runs on a 48k Apple II Plus, under DOS 3.3. 

Ask your dealer for MENU GENERATOR, or 
order direct from Crane Software for $39.95 
(shipping included). Payable by VISA, Master 
Card, check, or COD. California residents add 6% 
sales tax.

physics teacher and end up who-knows-where and for what 
good reason anyway? 

Well, first of all, you're only going to have to wade in a very 
little bit deeper (the scary part comes when we try to do nega- 
tive numbers in binary ! ) . And second of all, the point of all this 
will be the simple goal of bouncing a little ball around on the 
screen. As it happens, we must know a little of how the uni- 
verse works if we are going to simulate it on our TV screen. 
And if you really intend to end up with spaceships careening 
wildly about, you'll have to show a little determination now to 
get the basics under your belt. So much for the half-time pep 
talk. 

The sticky question is how to handle objects that are mov- 
ing from, say, point C to A. As a case of extremely good for- 
tune, it turns out we can consider the components of the mo- 
tion quite easily, and achieve the same end result we want, 
without even having to know the objects' real diagonal speed. 

What this means is that we can give an object both a hori- 
zontal and vertical component to its motion, and then do the 
appropriate calculations separately. 

Speed can be rephrased as "a change in position with re- 
spect to time." On the screen, what this means is that some- 
thing will appear to move consistent with the real world as long 
as we keep replotting its position in a regular manner. The 
timebase of the operations ends up depending on how fast we 
cycle through the replotting pattern. Since an example can 
work wonders, let's take a moment to examine a program in 
(oh no!) Applesoft: 



position before being redrawn at the new one, and 3) a bounce 
is basically a complete reversal of the velocity factor, that is, 
the value is multiplied by minus one. The speed with which ev- 
erything is executed depends on the inherent speed of the pro- 
gramming language and how fast we can cycle through the 
service loop. If for some reason the loop shown was too fast, 
you could put a for-next delay loop in anywhere along the line. 
If it was too slow, you could increase the speed factor, V, from 
1 to a larger number. Larger numbers produce more jerky mo- 
tion, however. The other option would be to write it in machine 
language ! 

Before doing that, though, let's make it two-dimensional by 
giving the ball both horizontal and vertical components to its 
motion : 

10 HGR 

20 X=140:Y = 80 

30 XV=1:YV=1 

100 REM DRAW LOOP 

110 HCOLOR = 3: REM WHITE 

120 HP LOT X,Y : REM DRAW OBJECT 

130 HCOLOR = 0: REM BLACK 

140 HP LOT X,Y : REM ERASE IT 

200 REM MAKE IT MOVE I 

210 X = X + XV: Y = Y + YV 

220 IF X > 278 THEN XV = XV * (-1) 

230 IF X < 1 THEN XV = XV * (-1) 

240 IF Y > 158 THEN YV = YV * (-1) 

250 IF Y < 1 THEN YV = YV * (-1) 

260 GOTO 100 



10 HGR 

20 X = 0: Y=80 

30 V=l 

100 REM DRAW LOOP 

110 HCOLOR = 3: REM WHITE 

120 HPLOT X,Y : REM DRAW OBJECT 

130 HCOLOR = 0= REM BLACK 

140 HPLOT X,Y : REM ERASE IT 

200 REM MAKE IT MOVEI 

210 X = X + V 

220 IF X > 278 THEN V = V * (-1) 

230 If X < 1 THEN V = V * (-1) 

240 GOTO 100 



This program will bounce a tiny spot off the left and right 
sides of the screen. The important things to note are that 1) 
motion is simulated by adding a constant velocity factor V to 
the position of each cycle, 2) the object is erased from its old 



In this program, we watch both components of motion, ver- 
tical and horizontal. Again, a bounce consists of taking the 
negative value of the component we are reversing. The flicker 
is caused by erasing the dot so soon after we draw it and also 
by the scanning nature of the TV or monitor. It can be 
smoothed out by adding a line : 



125 FOR I = 1 TO 5: NEXT I 

This will also slow down the speed of the ball a bit, but it 
does help the overall screen appearance. You are advised to 
watch this fascinating program run for a while, meditating on

from page 120 — 

For starters, it has a 16K buffer expandable on board to 
32K. It supports all of the Grappler-type text and graphics 
commands, and It can even dump mixed text and graphics 
screens. Microbuffer n uses a CMOS microprocessor to con- 
serve the Apple's power supply and keep the heat down. It has 
a self test mode, 40/80 column default select, bypass mode (to 
emulate an Apple Parallel Card) , and a reset disable switch. 
This last switch allows the printer card to continue sending, 
even when the Apple's reset button has been pressed. 

Another nice feature is the buffer zap command, control-I 
Z. This allows you to clear out the buffer in case you don't want 
the rest of it printed out. Although the unit we tested used the 
simplified 10-wire connector, we were informed that an im- 
proved version has already been designed. It will carry the full 
standard and have several other new features. 

Practical Peripherals seems to have a very judicious pol- 
icy about updates — anyone purchasing an earlier board will be 
allowed to exchange it for the improved version. The Micro- 
buffer II can be purchased with either a 16K buffer for $259 or 
with 32K for $299. 

Another way to get serial and parallel interface capabil- 
ities is with one of the multi-function cards on the market. We 
will evaluate several of these in the May issue. 



As you can see, we've come a long way from the simple 
parallel interface board. What we are also starting to see is a 
prime example of what is called distributed processing. We 
can now have the Apple's cpu executing the desired program, 
sending data to an intelligent pinter card. The microprocessor 
there takes the data in at the Apple's speed, and then handles 
transmission to the printer. In most cases, there will be one or 
more microprocessors in the printer to handle all of its vari- 
ous functions. 

Looking back the other way, we can also have a co-proces- 
sor board like the SoftCard, Mill, 8088, or even 68000 board han- 
dling all the data processing, using the Apple's 6502 for simple 
I/O handling. In a future column we will examine other inter- 
face standards such as the IEEE GPIB and local networks.

By now, you are probably convinced, as we were, of 
what a nice person Softalk business columnist Peter Oli- 
vieri is. Few of us suspected the streak of secret 
voyeurism that revealed itself when he demanded that we 
molest you with the nosy questionnaire you'll find on the 
attached card. 

Oh, he tried to cover it up. "The results could be very 
interesting to all our readers," he proclaimed. "After all, 
it doesn't ask our readers to give their names. . . . 
Wouldn't you like to know what sort of folks our fellow Ap- 
ple owners are?" Then came the giveaway: "Send them 
to me. The results will be fun to analyze. . . ." Fun, Pet- 
er? Hmmmm. 

Nevertheless, Softalk likes to keep its writers happy, 
and, well, maybe it would be kind of fun . . . and interest- 
ing .. . 

We've paid the postage already, so all you need to do is 
fill out the card, tear it out— it's already perforated— and 
stuff it ... in a mailbox. It'd be ideal if you could do all 
this by April 15, but if you don't think of it until you're 
reperusing the magazine in September 1996, send it then 
anyway. Your info may not make the first roundup, but a 
wizened, crotchety Softalk staff will have a good laugh.

Busines 


BY PETER OLIVIERI 






One of the first questions prospective microcomputer own- 
ers ask is "What is the best personal computer?" The second 
question is usually "What can a microcomputer be used for 
anyway?" Most readers of this column have already found 
their answer to the first question, so in this month's install- 
ment, we'll provide some answers to question number two. 

Homing In. A personal computer is often used for games. 
Indeed, after its introduction into the home, the primary role of 
this new resident may be as an entertainer. After all, some of 
those games are great, and besides, applications for the home 
have not yet matured. As packages begin to appear that really 
tap the potential of the personal computer in the home, it's 
very likely that we'll see an increase in microcomputer sales, 
particularly as related to educational applications. In addi- 
tion, the microcomputer seems to be making a real place for it- 
self in small businesses. Well tested applications in account- 
ing, finance, data management, and so on, make the Apple a 
natural additional employee. 

Another setting in which the personal computer is making 
its presence felt is in businesses that are run from the home. 
Such businesses may be the primary means of support for an 
individual or family or may be the source of additional income. 

It's a good bet that as soon as people in the home begin to 
realize the microcomputer's potential, this market will de- 
velop rapidly. We'll begin to see an enormous growth in appli- 
cations, as well as an increase in the number of small busi- 
nesses. Home-based businesses will emerge to provide word 
processing/report preparation, mailing list maintenance, in- 
come tax preparation, graphics design, letter writing and 
many other services. With this in mind, we'll be devoting a fu- 
ture column to a review of the potential applications of that 
personal computer of yours. 

Certainly, whether you're thinking of using your Apple in 
your current business or of going into business because you 
have an Apple, a guide that provides some help along the way 
is likely to be useful to you. Next issue will mark the beginning 
of a four-part series that will ultimately become A Guide for 
Planning and Using a Computer in a Small Business. The origi- 
nal plan had been to start the guide in this month's column, but 
readers are probably more interested right now in timely tax 
information, so the guide will begin next month instead. It will 
be well worth the wait (or the weight) . 

Tax Time Draws Nigh. After the "Ides of March" comes 
the "IRS of April." If you're like most of us, you dread assem- 
bling all the documents and paperwork, struggling through the 
calculations, and then wondering in the end if you could have 
saved more money by doing your taxes some other way. You 
may have thought about income averaging, or about filing 
separately instead of jointly, only to decide against these meth- 
ods when you realized that they can sometimes require three 
times as much work as your usual methods. 

Let's face it. Doing taxes is a pain! 

Computers can help. After all, they're designed to perform 
routine, repetitive, boring, calculation-oriented tasks. (How 
better to describe doing taxes.) But there aren't a lot of tax 
programs available. Such programs are difficult to write, and 
even more difficult to maintain, particularly with so many 
changes in tax law each year. Because a variety of supple- 
mental forms may be chosen by particular taxpayers, it is dif- 
ficult to design a complete package. 

Tax Packages— Who Needs 'Em? Your first step in de- 
termining whether a tax package might be of use to you is to 



assess your needs. If you don't itemize, if you file the shortest 
form possible, or if you evade taxes altogether, it's obvious 
that you don't need a tax program. And if you have several 
businesses, a multitude of tax shelters, and 140 tax prepara- 
tion books, it's wise to stick with your professional advisor. 

But if you do your own taxes, have one or two reasonable in- 
comes, itemize, use some of the additional forms, or have a 
small business, it's well worth it to consider obtaining and 
using one of the tax preparation programs. 

Of course, these packages don't tell you how to do your 
taxes. They don't advise you about what deductions to take, 
and they can't provide you with receipts that you don't al- 
ready have. 

A tax program will, however, do all of the calculations for 
you. It will allow you to try different methods (that is, filing 
jointly, separately, and so on) , and to store all of your results 
on disk for comparison. In fact, if you're one of those really 
organized people, you can use a tax package at the end of each 
month throughout 1982 to keep your records up to date and 
have most of the work done by the time tax season rolls around 
next year. 

Who's Got What? Various software companies offer tax 
packages for the Apple. Among the ones we know of are two 
tax planning packages from Aardvark Software: Individual 
Tax Plan, designed for use by CPAs and other professionals 
($300) , and Personal Tax Plan ($130) . Both programs are in- 
tended as aids in tax planning, rather than as tax preparation 
tools. 

Microlab offers a tax preparation package called Tax Man- 
ager (see Marketalk Reviews) . This program is meant for use 
by individuals who are filling out Form 1040. An extensively re- 
worked version of a program formerly available from Taso, 
Tax Manager retails for $150. A $30 extended update fee pro- 
vides current users with information on any changes in rates 
or tax laws on a yearly basis. 

Other manufacturers have programs that will run on 
CP/M-based systems or an Apple with a language system. If 
you're an accountant or have very complex or detailed tax 
needs, you'll want to look carefully into what forms and options 
are provided by the various software vendors. 

One excellent tax package we're acquainted with is Tax 
Preparer from Howard Software. Priced at just $150, Tax Pre- 
parer is worth every penny (and of course, as is the case with 
any tax program, its cost is deductible). This package takes 
you through Form 1040 line by line and stores the information 
you fill in on the form. If a line on 1040 requires an entry that's 
the result of filling out another schedule (for example, Sched- 
ule A for deductions) , you can exit Form 1040 and go to the ap- 
propriate schedule. After you've completed that schedule, the 
result of your labors is automatically posted in the proper po- 
sition on Form 1040. 

At any time while you're completing a form, you may exer- 
cise an option that allows you to spell out what may have led to 
the entry of a particular figure. For instance, if a line item on 
one of the forms equals $1,598, you can store a list (including 
alphabetic descriptions and dollar amounts) that backs up this 
figure. Lists of this sort can contain up to 1,000 items and can 
be added to or modified at your choice. In addition, lists can be 
printed along with the forms. The manual is well done, easy to 
use, and takes you through a sample set of forms to familiarize 
you with the program's features. 

Each year, for a modest additional charge, you can obtain a

Resource Corner — Expanding Your Professional Library. 
If you're doing some of your own programming, you'll need to 
get involved at some point with using data files. If you haven't 
learned all about them already, you'd be well advised to pick 
up a copy of Apple Basic for Business by Alan J. Parker and 
John F. Stewart (Reston Publishing Company, $17.95 hard, 
$14.95 paper) . This book is one of the better introductions to the 
use of Basic for writing programs on your Apple for applica- 
tion in your business. 

The book covers the components of Basic, and does so by 
using examples from a business setting. Chapters include 
material on data entry, using sequential files, adding and de- 
leting records from files, using direct access files, and princi- 
ples of designing programs. Information about graphics, edit- 
ing, and data base management is also provided. The many 
listings of Basic programs that are included in the book make 
it even more valuable. 

Basic Training. The Basic Handbook by David Lien 
(Compusoft Publishing, $19.95) is actually an encyclopedia of 
the Basic programming language. It was designed as a ref- 
erence for Basic. Thus, it contains a wide range of Basic state- 
ments (that is, those for Apple, TRS-80, Digital, and so on) . The 
book is attractively laid out, and the pages contain all of the 
statements in the language in alphabetical order. 

Each page begins with a short explanation of the function of 
a particular statement, followed by a test program that illus- 
trates its use and allows you to determine how the statement 



will work on your computer. A sample run of the test program 
is also provided. Next, alternative spellings and variations in 
usage are presented, along with another test program, if ap- 
propriate, to demonstrate a particular feature. 

The reader is then directed to any statements that might be 
related to the one being examined. If you're already familiar 
with programming but need to look up the syntax of a particu- 
lar statement every once in a while, this book should be on your 
bookshelf. And if you happen to work in an environment where 
several versions of Basic are used, you'll find this reference 
invaluable. 

If you're interested in using your personal computer in 
starting up your own business, you may be interested in a book 
called INC. Yourself by Judith McQuown (Warner Books, 
$5.95) . This book has nothing at all to do with computers but it 
is a very readable and reliable reference for setting up your 
own corporation. It includes discussions about how to incorpo- 
rate, selecting an office site, dealing with your employees, ob- 
taining insurance, handling medical benefits, developing tax 
shelters and profit sharing plans, and preparing tax returns for 
your new business. Those of you who have been tempted to start 
your own business, perhaps from your home, should find this 
book quite useful. 

Special Reports. You may at some point want information 
about what printers are available for micro and minicomput- 
ers. Or you may be interested in learning more about word 
processing. Datapro Research Corporation offers a wide va- 
riety of unbiased reports on the latest information processing 
products and methods. 

These reports include specifications, prices, character- 
istics, user ratings, product comparisons, selection guidelines, 
and so on. Reports cost $15 apiece ; among the most recent ti- 
tles are "Glossary of 263 Word Processing Terms," "Manage- 
ment Guidelines for Office Automation," "User Ratings of 
Computer Systems," "How to Select and Install a Small Busi-

ing of available reports can be obtained by writing to the com- 
pany directly (or visit your local library and see what they 
have from Datapro). 

A Helpful How-To. If you already have your own business 
and are considering using your computer in it, you should also 
consider getting a copy of Jules A. Cohen's How to Computer- 
ise Your Small Business (Prentice Hall, $7.95) . (This paper- 
back will also be useful to you if you have not yet decided on 
what computer or computer components you want or need in 
your business.) The book is easy reading and contains some 
good advice. 

The opening chapters cover data processing and comput- 
ers. In subsequent chapters, the author presents a plan for se- 
lecting the best system for your particular needs. He traces the 
steps necessary to evaluating what your needs are, and then 
provides checklists for you to follow in actually documenting 
your needs. Sample forms are also provided, along with ac- 
tual examples of many of the principles and steps suggested. 

New Perspective. This next recommendation is geared to- 
ward those of you who would like to know more about comput- 
ers, not from the electronic or design points of view, but from 
the user's or manager's perspective. The volume in question is 
a hardcover text entitled Information Processing Systems for 
Management by Hussain and Hussain (Richard D. Irwin 
$24.95). It is not for or about the Apple, but addresses instead 
what managers need to know about computers and how they 
can be applied to a firm's operations. 

This very readable book includes chapters on software, 
hardware, input and output equipment, storage devices, tele- 
processing, design of a database, database management sys- 
tems, developing an information system, conducting a feasi- 
bility study, designing a system, implementing a system, 
quality control, security, computer applications, and many 
other topics. 

Again, this book is not specific to the Apple, or even to 
microcomputers. But it's a thorough and well organized text, 



Financial =

System! 



neither too technical nor too light. If you're thinking seriously 
of taking the next step toward expanding your horizons about 
computers, this book may be for you. 

The Readers Speak. "Of course, I like Softalk. However, 
are there other magazines that I should be reading or that 
might be valuable for me?" E. N., Columbia, South Carolina. 

I am certainly not biased when I say that I think Softalk 
(even with its new subscription policy) is the best reference of 
all for the Apple user. It's well written, more thorough in its 
coverage than any other magazine, and the best one-stop-shop- 
ping guide for the Apple that exists anywhere. 

Of course there are other magazines that are well written 
and valuable, although I don't think I'd necessarily subscribe 
to them just because I owned an Apple. As I said, Softalk is the 
only definitive Apple resource. While other magazines may 
have articles on Apple applications, or even a regular depart- 
ment that covers Apple applications, other magazines also 
cover many other machines. 

I look to other magazines for information or articles that 
are of particular interest to me. To answer your question (I 
feel like Santa Claus in Miracle on 34th Street telling you to 
shop at Gimbel's instead of Macy's) , I like Creative Comput- 
ing (Morristown, NJ), It has a lot of equipment reviews, as 
well as articles about computing and artificial intelligence, 
and I find it interesting reading. Occasionally I purchase 
copies of Byte and Personal Computing (both Peterborough, 
New Hampshire). 

So long, and have a great month.

SOFTCARD 
Symposium 

by Greg Tibbetts 



Last month we discussed the utility program STAT.COM, 
and in relationship to that program we discussed the manner 
in which CP/M handles the interaction between itself (the sys- 
tem) and the outside world (the peripherals) . Typically, this is 
set up in one of two ways — either by the manufacturer of the 
system for those systems that are sold with all peripherals in 
place and functioning or by the CP/M user in those systems 
whose components are supplied separately or who may have 
purchased CP/M separately from Digital Research or one of 
its agents. In the latter case and occasionally in the former, the 
user is required to write his own BIOS, or at least modify a 
sample BIOS supplied with the system. While this is not terri- 
bly difficult in most cases, it is by no means a trivial task, and 
a firm understanding of both CP/M and the system to be inter- 
faced to would be required. 

In Apple CP/M, the task is doubly difficult because of the 
fact that the CP/M Apple is a dual-processor system. For this 
reason, the BIOS was preconfigured by Microsoft for the most 
standard peripherals, and a means was provided to alter the 
BIOS to handle any special peripherals the user might wish to 
install. The means for making these alterations — and the sub- 
ject of this month's column — is the utility program CON- 
FIGIO.BAS. 

CONFIGIO, unlike the utilities we have dealt with before, is 
not a standard Digital Research program. In fact, no direct 
method of BIOS alteration is normally provided in most other 
CP/M systems. This is either because all configuration possi- 
ble has been done by the manufacturer, or because the user 
himself, having written or rewritten the BIOS in the first place, 
is in a position to alter it. The Apple CP/M user however, is not 
in a position to alter the BIOS directly, nor is he the owner of a 
nonexpandable system. Consequently, Microsoft implement- 
ed the BIOS with a special area they called the I/O Configura- 
tion Block, or IOCB, that allows changes to be made easily to 
the BIOS I/O control arrangement. Thus the Apple is some- 
thing of a special case, and we hope all the better because of 
that singularity. 

CONFIGIO as a utility is also unique in another way. It is 
comprised of 185 lines of Basic code (that's right, Basic) and 
contains several Z-80 machine language subroutines stored in 
the program as data statements. Using Basic routines and 
calling these Z-80 subroutines, CONFIGIO is able to alter di- 
rectly the IOCB and thereby allow the user to customize a sys- 
tem for specific peripherals. Before we take a closer look at 
what CONFIGIO does however, we need to know a little more 
about the structure of the IOCB, so we're going to take some 
not inconsiderable space to examine its physical structure. 

Each Apple CP/M system disk contains an IOCB that de- 
fines the way that CP/M system, if it's running in your Apple, 
will communicate with the outside world. Perform a cold boot 
with that disk, and you load that IOCB into memory. You may 
perform any number of warm boots or disk changes after that 
and you will not change the IOCB that was loaded from the 



i i mil i 



original boot disk — until and unless another cold boot is per- 
formed. The IOCB is loaded into memory at Z-80 addresses 
F200H through F3FFH. Several items are located within this 
range of memory. Those items and their addresses are listed 
in table 1. 

The three user patch areas, located from F200 to F37F, are 
specific areas of RAM allocated as free space for the user to 
place peripheral driver routines that may be needed for non- 
standard peripheral cards or special filter-type routines that 
perform some operation on data either going to or coming 
from the peripheral. 

Next, the I/O vector table is simply a series of two-byte ad- 
dresses that are vectors into the standard BIOS routines han- 
dling the function to which the vector is assigned. For exam- 
ple, we described list output vector §1 last month as the loca- 
tion of a two-byte address of the general-purpose printer driver 
located in the BIOS. It is these vector contents that you must 
alter to point to your routine in the patch areas listed in table 1, 
when you wish to substitute your own driver for the standard 
one. More on this later. 

The next two areas in the IOCB are the software and hard- 
ware screen function tables. Basically, screen functions can be 
described as macro operations performed by the CRT display 
(usually referred to as the terminal, regardless of whether it's 
truly an external terminal or part of the computer itself) . For 
example, if you wanted to clear the terminal's current line of 
unwanted characters and your cursor was at the beginning of 
the line, you could simply print sufficient spaces to erase the 
unwanted characters. Or you could issue sufficient carriage 
returns to scroll the display off the screen. Most terminals, 
however, have certain built-in operations that perform such

functions automatically. Things like clear screen, clear to end 
of line, clear to end of page, and so on, are done in hardware for 
the most part and as such are much faster than the primitive 
methods we just described. Each type of terminal supports a 
certain number of functions— some more than others— and 
each has its own character or sequence of characters that it 
recognizes as being a function command rather than charac- 
ters to be displayed. If all the various computer system and ex- 
ternal terminal manufacturers used the same sequence of 
characters for these functions, or at least for the more com- 
mon ones, things would be much simpler. Unfortunately they 
do not, and therefore the problem of screen-function protocols 
arises. 

Since CP/M systems are usually found on computers re- 
quiring external terminals, there is no way for the software 
producers to know in advance what sort of terminal functions 
their programs will be dealing with. It's common, therefore, 
for them to set up their programs to output screen functions in 
a common protocol, identify the protocol used, and leave it to 
the user to make a translation to the protocol used by his hard- 
ware if that protocol is different. 

This is where the screen function tables in Apple CP/M 
come in, and they are a very important interface between the 
system and the hardware. They take the output of the soft- 
ware, examine it against a table of function calls of the proto- 
col the software is using, and, if a screen function is being sent, 
translate it to the characters required by the protocol of the 
hardware. If that seems like a lot of work, it is, since every 
character output is examined in just this way. You may be 
wondering just how the terminal determines whether a char- 
acter or sequence of characters is a function or just something 
to be displayed. It can be done in several ways, but the most 
common way is by the use of a lead-in character. 

The lead-in character is usually a nonprintable character, 
such as an escape or control character, that tells the terminal 
to examine the character immediately following it. If the fol- 
lowing character matches one that the terminal recognizes as 
a screen function character, then the terminal performs the 
function; if not, then the character (and sometimes the lead-in 
character as well) is displayed normally. There are nine 
screen functions in Apple CP/M; they're shown in table 2. 

Consequently, there are eighteen bytes in the table, nine for 
software protocol and nine for hardware protocol, that repre- 
sent the identifying characters for each screen function. There 
are also two bytes that represent the lead-in characters re- 
quired by the protocols used for software and hardware, and fi- 
nally, there are two additional bytes representing the address- 
coordinate offset and the order of coordinate transmission. 

To see how it works then, let's take the typical example of a 
system using WordStar with one of the standard eighty-col- 
umn boards. The software table in this case would have to be 
set for Soroc protocol, since this is the protocol used by Word- 
Star when it commands screen functions. The hardware side 
would be set up for Datamedia, since this is the protocol used 
by both the Videx and M & R Sup-R-Term boards. When Word- 
Star, during its normal output, decides to clear screen, it sends 
an escape followed by an asterisk. CP/M sees the escape, 
which is the lead-in character for the software side of the ta- 
ble, and doesn't output it, but instead waits for the next char- 

1 . . . clear screen 

2 . . . clear to end of page 

3 . . . clear to end of line 

4 ... set normal text mode, (noninverse; also known as low light) 

5 ... set inverse text mode (high light) 

6 . . . home cursor 

7 . . . address cursor (meaning send cursor to position based on X, Y coordinates) 

8 . . . move cursor up one line 

9 . . . nondestructively move cursor forward 

Table 2. 



acter. If that character matches an entry in the table, as it does 
in the case of the clear screen entry, CP/M looks on the hard- 
ware side for the corresponding entry and finds the FF or 
form-feed character, which is an ASCII 12 (decimal) . It also 
looks to see if the hardware requires a lead-in character, finds 
that it does not, and simply outputs a decimal 12 to the eighty- 
column card. If it had received an escape character from 
WordStar and could not find a corresponding table entry 
matching the next character, that next character would be 
sent to the screen and the lead-in character discarded. 

The next area in the IOCB is the keyboard redefinition ta- 
ble. This table was designed to make available to Apple CP/M 
users certain characters that their software may require, but 
that the Apple keyboard is incapable of generating. It is set up 
so that, as the screen function table does with output, every 
character of input is examined as it is received to see if it 
matches one of the entries in the table. If it does, the character 
you have designated to replace it is transmitted instead. If it 
doesn't, the character is passed on as is. 

Certain characters used with the eighty-column boards 
cannot be redefined, however, as perhaps you have found out. 
CP/M comes with control-K translated to a right square brack- 
et. If you tried to redefine this to something else or even to 
eliminate it when using an eighty-column card, you found that 
it seemed not to work. This is because CP/M never saw the 
control-K in the first place. The eighty-column card, which also 
handles input, made the translation to a bracket before giving 
the character to CP/M. If you wish to make control-K really be 
control-K, the only way to do it with your present hardware 
configuration is to use the translation table to translate the 
bracket back into control-K. Once you've done that, you'll find 
that when you type control-K it appears as control-K, even 
though it is going through two separate translations. Each 
translation entry requires two bytes, one for the existing char- 
acter and one for the new one. There are twelve bytes used for

this table, so a maximum of six characters can be redefined. 

The byte Immediately following the redefinition table is 
used by CP/M to keep track of the number of disk drives avail- 
able to the system. It's not necessarily a true count, since it's 
simply the number of disk controller cards in use times two. 
CP/M has no way of determining if there are two drives on 
each card, so this number may not be correct. It is originally 
set on cold boot and changed only on subsequent cold boots. 

The next area of the IOCB is the slot types table. This table 
is also created during the boot process and not updated until a 
subsequent cold boot sequence. In this table, which consists of 
seven bytes, one each for slot numbers 1 through 7, is con- 
tained a value that corresponds to the type of card CP/M 
thought it recognized in the specified slot during the boot se- 
quence. To identify cards, CP/M looks at two bytes of the ROM 
on the card, 6502 addresses $CN05 and $CN07 (where N is the 
slot number) , and compares them to a table of values for cards 
it supports. Because of the nature of the hardware, it is possi- 
ble for CP/M to mistake an unknown card for one of those it 
recognizes, but most common cards will be recognized prop- 
erly. The card values and types it will recognize are listed in 
table 3. 

This information can be put to use in applications pro- 
grams, for example in programs that automatically configure 
for forty or eighty column output by examining the value In the 
byte for slot 3. 

The next area of the IOCB is the 6502/Z-80 control-transfer 
loop routine between F3C0 and F3DF (which also includes 
some miscellaneous temporary storage and vector locations) . 
This loop, on 6502 code, is a recursive means of constantly 
transferring control between the 6502 and the Z-80. The first 
nine bytes, which are first executed during the boot sequence, 
set up any RAM board that might be in the system and then en- 
able the Z-80 by writing to the address of the SoftCard. The 6502 
is placed in a "hold" condition at this point, but when it is reac- 
tivated by writing again to the address of the SoftCard, it will 
pick up where it left off with the instruction at $03C9. At this 
point, the 6502 again resets the Ram board and then performs a 
subroutine at $FF3F that restores its registers from the regis- 
ter-save area. Its next action, at $03CF, is to execute a subrou- 
tine whose address is stored obviously at $03D0 and $03D1. 
When that's completed, the 6502 executes another subroutine 
at $FF4 A that saves its registers in the save area ; and finally it 
goes back to $03C0 to activate again the Z-80 and put itself on 
hold until the next time it's "turned on." 

While this seems unnecessarily complex, it allows you to do 
some interesting things, such as easily calling 6502 subrou- 
tines from Z-80 mode. All you have to do in 8080 or Z-80 assem- 
bly language is store the address of the 6502 subroutine you 
wish to call in the address field at $03D0 (low-order byte) , and 
$03D1 (high-order byte) and write to the address of the Soft- 
Card (which, as we said, is found in Z-80 location F3DE and 
F3DF) . The control-transfer loop will do all of the dirty work 
for you and leave you back in Z-80 mode when your routine 
does an RTS. The 6502 control vectors all point to this routine 
also, so that If, for example, a reset is encountered during the 
execution of your subroutine, Z-80 recovery will take place. 

Actually, the control transfer loop occupies only the Z-80 ad- 
dress locations from F3C0 to F3DA. The remainder through 
F3DD is not used, and the addresses F3DE and F3DF are used 
by the BIOS to store the address of the SoftCard during the cold 
boot sequence for future reference and use by the system. 



The last area of the IOCB, F3F0 to F3FF, contains the Ap- 
ple break, reset, Applesoft, &, Monitor control- Y, nonmaskable 
interrupt, and interrupt request vectors (see page 65 of the Ap- 
ple II Reference Manual for more information). The actual 
vector addresses have all been changed to point to the begin- 
ning of the control-transfer loop so that resets, for example, 
will always leave the Apple in Z-80 mode. 

Now that we've seen what the IOCB is and does, we can 
now look at why and how CONFIGIO alters it. 

When you run the CONFIGIO utility, you will notice that it 
first initializes itself. By looking in the program listing, you can 
see each of these initialization steps in detail, but for our pur- 
poses, suffice it to say that they consist of setting up the ma- 
chine language subroutines and informing CONFIGIO of ex- 
isting system parameters. At this point, the main menu will be 
displayed, and from this menu you can determine the four 
functions that CONFIGIO can perform. They are: redefining 
the software and hardware screen function tables for the dis- 
play device, redefining the keyboard translation table, and 
loading and patching in user peripheral driver routines. The 
last item in the menu simply allows an original IOCB to be 
read in from a specific disk and a restructured IOCB to be writ- 
ten out to disk. 

Now that you understand the structure of the IOCB and how 
it functions, the first two items, screen function and keyboard 
redefinition, are pretty self-explanatory. In these cases, CON- 
FIGIO simply is a means to alter easily the character values in 
the tables, using words and methods that are easier for us hu- 
mans to understand. For that reason, we'll not discuss these 
further. 

What seems to confuse many SoftCard users is the concept 
of patching in peripheral handling routines, and that will be 
our topic for the remainder of the column. 

In last month's column we covered the concepts behind 
user handling routines in some detail. So for our current pur-

The Numeric Keypad For Your Apple ][ 

If you have an Apple ][, and would like fast numeric 
input and a calculator, relax, you can now have both. 
For VisiCalc* users, the TKC Numeric Keypad has 
special keys for entering data, deleting entries and 
cursor movement in four directions. A special auto- 
repeat key moves the cursor across the screen until 
the key is released. The numeric keys are positioned 
to enhance the numeric data and calculator entry 
speed. Keys to multiply and divide have been added 
to increase hardware capabilities.

poses, we'll simply highlight the important points. There are 
occasions, such as the case of nonsupported peripherals, where 
the user needs to force CP/M to recognize the peripheral or 
cause output to and input from the peripheral to be in a form 
different from the way the BIOS normally handles it. For want 
of a better term, we'll call these substitution patches, since 
they're complete in themselves and do not depend on the stan- 
dard BIOS routines. Also, there are occasions when it is desir- 
able to use a routine simply to alter the I/O traveling to or from 
a peripheral device before sending it on to the standard BIOS 
routine. These we'll call filter patches, since their job is to act 
as a filter through which the I/O must pass. In both cases with 
Apple CP/M, it is necessary to place in memory your routine 
to perform this function and then alter the normal vector that 
CP/M uses to send output or receive input via the BIOS to point 
instead to your routine. If your routine is a substitution patch, 
no further action need be taken. If, however, your routine is a 
filter-type patch which somehow alters the I/O before letting it 
go on its way, then the normal BIOS vector will have to be 
saved and placed in your routine. In both cases CONFIGIO is 
capable of handling most of this drudgery for you. To see how, 
we'll take a look at a typical case. 

A good example for us to use is the problem that occurs 
with some printers (mostly Centronics) , regarding extra line- 
feeds. As we've seen in earlier discussions on file handling, 
CP/M in its normal operations automatically places a linefeed 
at the end of every carriage return. Unfortunately, these line- 
feeds also get transmitted whenever output is sent to the print- 
er. Since the Apple does not store or transmit linefeeds, print- 
ers designed primarily for use with it usually insert them au- 
tomatically. The result is unwanted double-spaced output. 

Early in the SoftCard's history, users brought this fact to 
Microsoft's attention and a means was devised to circumvent 
the problem using a filter-type patch named NOLF (for NO 
Line Feed, of course). We'll now examine NOLF in detail to

see just what is happening. While this column is not aimed pri- 
marily at assembly language programmers, it is assumed that 
those readers interested in patching CP/M have some knowl- 
edge of assembly language and ASM.COM. Those of you with- 
out such specific knowledge would probably benefit from fol- 
lowing through the discussion below with a friend who has such 
knowledge. An assembly language printout of the patch is in- 
cluded here, and when we make references to it, we'll use the 
addresses running down the left margin to identify where we 
are. 

If we were a typical user faced with the problem above, our 
first step would be to design a machine-language filter that 
would be able to strip linefeeds from character output. Assum- 
ing that we have only ASM.COM to work with, we'll design the 
routine in 8080 code. The process will be as follows: All line- 
feeds following carriage returns will be ignored; any linefeeds 
not following carriage returns will be output normally; and fi- 
nally, carriage returns that are output immediately following a 
carriage return character (extremely rare), will also be ig- 
nored, since the printer would then issue two linefeeds. The ac- 
tual routine that performs this begins in the listing with the la- 
bel NOLF: at 010B and ends with the label NOTCR: at 011C. 
This is not all we have to do, however, to create a patch file 
that CONFIGIO can use. 

First, our assembler in this case — made up of ASM.COM 
and LOAD.COM — will not be able to create a loadable COM 
file that is assembled at any place other than address 0100 hex. 
On the other hand, since the program will need to be located 
and run in the patch area in high memory, we need to estab- 
lish its true origin (in this case F26A near the top of the slot 1 
patch area) and define an offset that is the difference between 
the two. By adding the offset in every memory reference we 
can resolve this problem. The origin is defined with the label 
ORIGIN and the offset with the label OFF$ at the beginning of 
the listing. You will notice then that in all branch instructions 
and data fetch instructions we have added the value of OFF$. 

The second thing we need to do is establish the information 
CONFIGIO will need when loading the file. Referring to the 
SoftCard manual on CONFIGIO, we see that the first eleven 
bytes of any patch file need to be in a certain format. They are 
fairly well commented in the listing, so we'll highlight them 
only briefly here .

Purpose 



This byte is the number of patches to be made in this op- 
eration. 

These two bytes are the place where CONFIGIO is to in- 
stall the patch. We use the ORIGIN value here. 
These two bytes are the length of the program set by us- 
ing the LENGTH value established near the end of the 

listing. 

This byte tells CONFIGIO what type of patch to make; 1 
if it is a substitution patch, 2 if it is a filter-type patch. 
NOLF is a type 2 patch. 

This byte is the number of the'lOCB vector to be patched. 
In this case, since we are using the LST: device, which it- 
self uses List Output Vector #1, the SoftCard manual tells 
us this is vector #10. 

Used only for type 2 patches, these two bytes are the ad- 
dress in our routine where CONFIGIO is to place the ex- 
isting contents of vector #10 so that our routine will go 
on to the BIOS to complete its output. We specify the la- 
bel NOTCR plus one, so the two bytes will replace the 
zeros in our listing. 

These two bytes are the address that we want CON- 
FIGIO to place in the IOCB vector, so that it will point to 
our routine. We use the label ORIGIN here since that is 
also the entry point of our routine. 



Now that we've done all the hard work, all that remains to 
install our routine in memory is to assemble it with ASM.COM 
and create a COM file using LOAD.COM. It is usually best to 
rename these files so that they have a .PAT extension. This is

There are a couple of final points to recognize in making 
patches to the IOCB. First of all, the breakdown of the patch 
area into three slot-dependent areas is arbitrary, and was done 
so that different patches for different peripherals would be less 
likely to conflict with one another. In actuality, NOLF could be 
placed anywhere in the three blocks and no difficulties would 
be noticed. There is, however, one area of the IOCB that should 
be avoided, and that is the upper portion of the slot 3 patch 
area, from F34A to F37F. This area has been used by Micro- 
soft in placing code to take care of problems found in the early 
releases of CP/M. This still leaves considerable space at the 
user's disposal for his own purposes. 

The second important point to consider is the fact that for 
each vector there can only be one type-1 patch by definition. 
This is apparent because a type-1 patch, being a substitu- 
tion, ends within itself; that is, it doesn't store the current vec- 
tor contents within itself and use them to branch back into the 
BIOS. Each new installation of a type-1 patch, therefore, will 
simply replace the old vector contents with the new one. 

In type-2 patches, however, extreme care must be taken 
when installing a second patch to the same vector. We can see 
why by examining what CONFIGIO does in this case. Re- 
member that the current vector contents already point to a 
routine in the patch area. CONFIGIO first loads your routine 
into the patch area, either writing over the old one or not, de- 
pending on where you have set it up to run. Next, CONFIGIO 
places the start address of your routine into the appropriate 
vector, saving the old vector contents. So far, so good. Next it 
takes these old vector contents and places them into your rou- 
tine as the place to go when it exits, and this is where the prob- 
lem can occur. Since they point not into the BIOS, but into the 
patch area, if the new patch is in the same place as the old one, 
then when your routine goes to exit, it will branch back into it- 
self with undefined, but probably nasty, consequences. Of 
course, if the new routine does not overwrite the old one, then it 
will exit to the old routine when done, and the old routine will 
exit to the BIOS when it finishes. This may or may not be a 
problem, depending on whether or not you wanted to replace 
the old one with the new one or have two filters for the I/O. 

For this reason, when replacing one type-2 patch with an- 
other, start with a fresh copy of the IOCB in memory by using 
CONFIGIO to read it in off your original Microsoft master 
disk. On the Other hand, when you want to install two type-2 
patches you will have to make sure that they do not overwrite 
each other ; in practice it is usually better simply to rewrite the 
patch to perform both functions. CONFIGIO is designed to tell 
you if you are patching a specific vector a second time and ask 
you if you wish to patch anyway. This gives you a safety check 
on this potential problem. As a final note on this problem, some 
vectors have been patched by Microsoft, with the patches in 
the area from F34A to F37F that we mentioned earlier. There 
should be no conflict with your patch routines, however, so long 
as you avoid this area ; but be aware that CONFIGIO will re- 
port prior patches made with some vectors. This simply points 
up the fact that you must keep track of what routines you've in- 
stalled and their locations. 

As has been said many times, the simplest things usually 
are the ones forgotten. So with that in mind, be sure that when 
the patch has been successfully installed you remember to use 
option 4 to write the new IOCB out to the disk you wish to alter. 
If you don't, you'll find yourself at best repeating the process 
and at worst examining your routine to find the bug that's 
causing it not to work. 

This discussion of the IOCB has been somewhat lengthy and 
esoteric. Even at that, we may not have covered all of the 
points of confusion. If this should be true in your case, you are 
urged to write and let us know. The column will reflect what you 
as its readers want to hear, and further discussion of any of the 
subjects covered so far and those to be covered in the future 
will be made at your request. Until next month ... JM

MARCH 1982 



THE BASIC 




Last month's Basic Solution con- 
tained a new input routine for Applesoft 
Basic that would perform automatic 
math functions transparent to the rest of 
the program. Those of you who didn't get 
a chance to look at that subroutine may 
wish to go back to last month's issue and 
review it. Many of the programs we'll be 
supplying in upcoming issues will use 
that subroutine. 

In this month's installment, we'll dis- 
cuss a function for the Apple that soft- 
ware alone cannot handle adequately. 
Many people have attempted to create 
software capable of handling this func- 
tion, but it cannot be done adequately 
without additional hardware. 

How many times have you been run- 
ning one of the programs you use quite of- 
ten and found yourself waiting for the 
program to enter an input statement be- 
fore you could begin typing? If you were 
to go ahead and type, the Apple would re- 
member only the last character you 
typed when the program finally entered 
the input routine. Some sort of input buff- 
er is needed to hold many characters 
transparent to the software until they are 
needed. 

Many programmers have attempted 
to peek at the keyboard location to test 
whether a character is waiting. If a char- 
acter is present, it is placed in a buffer 
zone and normal processing resumes. 
While this system serves the needs of 
most beginning typists on the Apple, the 
moment a proficient typist enters this 
system, the program usually can't view 
the keyboard fast enough to catch every 
character typed. 

Many computer systems, including 
the Apple III, have a special kind of key- 
board that is interrupt driven. If any key 
is pressed at the keyboard, the program 
is immediately halted. The computer 
places the keyboard character into a 
RAM buffer and then returns to the pro- 
gram, which continues as though noth- 
ing had happened. The Apple II key- 
board, however, is not an interrupt sys- 



tem, so this method is impossible. 

A number of companies have created 
front-end hardware for the Apple that 
will buffer the keyboard automatically, 
even if the programs are busy. To take 
advantage of this capability, you must re- 
move the bottom of your Apple to gain 
access to the keyboard and attach the 
necessary hardware. 

We have reviewed three such sys- 
tems : the Keyboard Plus System by La- 
zer Micro Systems, the Keyboard Buffer 
by Vista Computing, and the Keyboard 
Enhancer by Videx. The systems from 
Videx and Lazer also hook up the shift 
key for those of you who require upper 
and lower case input. 

Visit your local computer dealer and 
find out which of the systems are avail- 
able for your review. Bring in copies of 
whatever software you use on a regular 
basis and make sure there is no problem 
running your software with the key- 
board buffers in place. 

When looking for a keyboard buffer, 
make certain that it has some means of 
clearing the buffer out. If you happen to 
make a typing error, you don't want it to 
result in a syntax error. Some of the key- 
board buffers available also allow the Ap- 
ple to generate a number of the key- 
strokes that were previously unavail- 
able, such as the underline, the open 
bracket, and others. 

Just for fun, here is a subroutine that 
will create a small keyboard buffer so 
you can see how one works.

The Leader in Apple Graphics 



by Chris Jochumson and 
Mark Pelczarski 

Now anyone can put profes- 
sional graphics into their own 
programs. The Graphics Magi- 
cian contains machine language 
animation routines that use the 
same techniques as most of the 
popular Apple arcade games. 
Three animation editors let you 
design your figures, their paths, 
and assemble animation with up 
to 32 independent objects. 
Also included is a hi-res 
picture/object builder that lets you store hundreds of 100-color pictures 
on a single disk and recall them quickly from your own programs. These 
exact routines are being used in the new graphic adventure games from 
Scott Adams' Adventure International. Plus, a new shape editor greatly ex- 
tends the capabilities of Apple shape tables with multicolors and angles 
that are preserved on scaling. All design of graphics is done through menu- 
driven editors; to use in your programs, just attach our machine language 
routines. Extensive documentation makes this package easy to use for the 
beginning programmer, yet flexible enough for the most advanced.

tablet in two dimensions, until you 
decide to expand to real-world 
3-dimensional input. Now you can 
trace 3-D objects, either real or 
imaginary, then view and modify 
them in 3-D perspective with your 
Apple computer. The 16"xl3" 
tablet comes with a customized

This improved version of the already pop- 
ular Complete Graphics System is a com- 
plete and easy to use 2 -dimensional and 3- 
dimensional graphics design package for 
the non-programmer. Create color 
screen images with lines, circles, el- 
lipses, automatic 108-color filling, and 
"paintbrushes". Use high-resolution 
text anywhere on the screen in dozens 
of colors. Create and edit shape tables, 
and shrink pictures for multiple dis- 
plays. Amazing 3-D routines let you 
draw the parts of 3-D objects on the 
screen, then assemble, rotate, and edit 
them visually in true 3-D perspective. 
All the software is easy to use, even 
for the novice. Programmers can use 
the graphics, and even our machine

Like nothing else on the market, this unique software 
package allows you to escape the "coloring book" ap- 
proach to computer graphics, giving you a palette of 108 
colors and 96 different brushes for creating or enhancing 
color computer images. Also included is a magnifying 
mode that lets you magnify images 2 or 4 times and edit 
them point-by-point, a "picture packer" that lets you 
store images in a fraction of the space normally taken, and 
a set of tricks that allow you to reverse colors, perform 
mirror images, and move parts of screen images around 
and to other pictures. Special Effects is great as a stand- 
alone package -- or the perfect complement to 
The Complete Graphics System.

most from the competition is the Apple III, which many 
thought might be blown away by the Personal Computer. 

Nevertheless, it's still the Apple n that fuels the market- 
place, and January was a month when the Top Thirty under- 
went its most significant revision yet at its upper levels. Visi- 
Calc, Personal Filing System, and Snack Attack held their re- 
spective positions of first, third, and fourth. But seven new 
companies joined them in the first ten. 

Leaping into second place is On-Line 's hard-luck word pro- 
cessor, Superscribe II, a remarkable achievement for a prod- 
uct with such a checkered past. First introduced as Super- 
script, the software was full of bugs. Just as the product was 
starting to gain acceptance. On-Line was forced to change the 
name because of a potential infringement with a competing 
product. Now, even as it's finally reached the zenith of the Ap-

pie word processor world, its name will again undergo change 
because of possible infringement problems. Under what nom 
de guerre David Kidwell's program would next appear was un- 
known in mid-February. 

Jumping into the first ten from nowhere on the list were 
David's Midnight Magic, Broderbund's answer to Raster 
Blaster; and Home Accountant, Continental's answer to its 
own Home Money Minder. 

Reaching the top ten from lower echelons of the Top Thirty 
were Wizardry, fifth; VisiFile, sixth; DB Master, ninth; and 
VisiTrend/VisiPlot, tenth. 

There were also a number of oldcomers to the Top Thirty — 
programs that had been there before but had dropped off the 
list. In this category were BPI General Ledger, Flight Simula- 
tor, Ultima, Ulysses and the Golden Fleece, Falcons, and Zork 
II. Utility City from Beagle Brothers made the Top Thirty for 
the first time. 

Personal finance is becoming a foremost consideration 
among Apple owners, with seven of the Home 10 programs 
reflecting this interest. Home Accountant bested Personal Fi- 



nance Manager and Home Money Minder in one category, 
while Howard's Tax Preparer fended off challenges from Mi- 
cro Lab's Tax Manager and Datamost's Tax Beater. Dow 
Jones News and Quotes Reporter also made the Home 10. 

Utility City displaced DOS Tool Kit as leader of the Hobby 
10. It was one of three Beagle Brothers programs on that 
chart— DOS Boss was fourth and Alpha Plot was eighth. 

The Business 10 remained relatively stable. BPI Ac- 
counts Receivable was the only new entry to the list. VisiFile 
moved from fifth to third, while DB Master dropped from third 
to fourth and VisiTrend/VisiPlot dropped from fourth to fifth. 
Personal Filing System maintained its position as the bestsell- 
ing database program for the second month, but both VisiFile 
and DB Master, the former king, were closing ground. 

Other than Superscribe' s leap into first place among word 
processors, the biggest news was a new face in fifth. Letter 
Perfect, LJK's versatile entry, finally cracked the list after 
hovering nearby for several months. 




Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 9.0 percent of 
all sales of Apples and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in 
the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in February to ascertain their sales 
leaders for the month of January. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was number of sales made- 
such other criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer 
retailer, and personal preference of the individual respondents were not 
considered. 

Respondents in February represented every geographical area of the 
continental United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in 
the index number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. 
The index number is an arbitrary measure of relative strength of the 
programs listed. Index numbers are correlative only for the month in which 
they are printed ; readers cannot assume that an index rating of 50 in one 
month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in another 
month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus-or-minus 4.5 percent, which 
translates roughly into the theoretical possibility of a change of 3.11 points, 
plus or minus, in any index number.

Superb oolor HI- Res 
graphics reproduces the 
setting for this battalion- 
level game which reoounts 
the Israeli counterattack 
to cross the Suez Canal 
during the October War of 
1973 against Egypt 

The 28-by-39 hex-grid 
map of the Slnal can be 
viewed as one strategic 
screen or in twelve 





separate screens using 
scrolling. 

As the Israeli oom- 
mander, you have to 
smash past enemy strong- 
holds, cross the Suez, and 
establish a bridgehead. In 
order to accomplish this, 
your armor, artillery and 
Infantry units — along 
with your alrstrtkes — 
must successfully protect 
the slow- moving bridging 
units as they push 
towards the Canal. 

The Egyptian oom- 
mander's goal is to stop 
your advance using the 



forces at his disposal, 
which Include the potent 
SAM missiles. His air 
force can be called upon 
to negate your aerial 
threat 

To reflect history accu- 
rately, Egyptian and 
Israeli forces differ In 
efficiency level and 
strength points A unique 
"delayed move" feature 
allows for ambushes with 
Infantry and artillery. 

Thanks to machine- 
language programming, 
the computer can rapidly 
and efficiently calculate, 
display, and Implement 
combat results to give you 
a fun and fast- moving 
game. 

You never need to worry 
about being out of action 
for lack of a playing part- 
ner. The computer can 
direct the Egyptians and 
play you at any one of 
four levels of difficulty. So 
whether you're a novice 
or veteran gamer, you're 
guaranteed a challenging

Job Description 



I 



NAPOLlEON 
CAMPAIGNS: 




This advanced- level, 
board- assisted computer 
simulation presents a 
leadership opportunity 
where experience in 
strategy gaming really 
helps. Aside from fully 
appreciating the pains- 
taking detail and design 
efforts we've put into the 
game, a hardcore strate- 
gist can more effectively 
deal with the complexity, 
frustrations, and uncer- 



tainties Inherent In 
Napoleonic warfare. 

Leipzig and Waterloo are 
the two campaigns fea- 
tured. Like Napoleon, 
Schwarzenberg or 
Wellington, all your com- 
mands are sent to 
your troops and 
Information about 
them received via 
dispatch. Knowledge 

troop positions 
and estimates of 
enemy strength 
are only as good 
as your recon- 
nalsance patrols. 
The computer 
plays the individual 
corps commanders, 
whose leadership 
ratings have been 
preprogrammed 
based on historical 
data. How your orders 
are carried out depends 
entirely on the corps 
commanders, who may fol- 
low them to the letter or 
do so with hesitation 
Misinterpretation and 
even outright disobedience 
of your directives are also 
possible. 

Night rain, and terrain 
all affect troop movement 
Intricate rules that deal 
with the effects of fatigue, 
corps morale, and leader 
ship on battle outcome 
serve to mirror history 
faithfully. They also 
complicate your decision 
making and strategy 
planning. 

We know we've painted 
a pretty tough picture of 
this Job, and we don't 
expect everyone to apply 
for it We're looking for 
those who can meet the 
challenge and overcome 
the obstacles. For these 
people, we guarantee the 
same feeling of gratifica- 
tion the Emperor himself 
often felt when he added 
up his victory points. 

Two-player and solitaire 
scenarios are provided for 
both campaigns. 

Our Want Ad has all the
