Nobody likes to see a good line go to waste. 
Consider the lowly subhead— those bold little 
catch phrases placed in a story or column in 
every issue of Softalk. They're designed to catch 
your eye, maybe amuse you, help you grasp an 
idea, and generally move a story along. 

Here's One Now. We write about a hun- 
dred of them per issue. Some are gems, some 
are duds, some are just odd. We think the good 
ones are worth repeating. 

Live and Let Die. But we don't want just to 
pick them up and drop them in the next issue; 
that would be cheating. There's nothing worse 
than a pirated subhead. However, if we don't 
recycle them, that would be wasteful. Why, 
those little phrases just can't win. You see, 
they're not really essential to any story. One 
subhead can easily be replaced by another. 
Also, after it's been used once, it's too old to be 
used again. The baby seals of Softalk. 

Not Fade Away. Yes, the life of a subhead 
is short; it's a life of "shine once, then perish." 
For some, that's good. For others, a shame. 
But it doesn't have to be that way. 
Oh Boy, a Contest. Here's your chance to 
help save the subheads from meeting a prema- 
ture death. Give them a chance to live a little 
longer before they go to that great word proc- 
essor in the sky. All you have to do is write a 
short story using as many of the subheads in 
this issue and any other issue of Softalk as well 
as you can. Any kind of story— as long as it has 
something to do with our lovable Apples. 

Volume and Variety. The rules are simple: 
use as many as you can, although entries will 
also be judged on story value, cleverness of sub- 
head use, and wit. If yoil get greedy, you can 
also use the headings to the letters in Open Dis- 
cussion. 

Read This. Stories can be as long as five 
typewritten, double-spaced pages. That means a 
blank line between lines. We're serious on that 
rule. Very serious. 

And This, Too. Finally, underline every oc- 
currence of a subhead in your story. Also, to 
keep everyone straight, you must put the issue 
date and page number for the source of each 



original subhead above the subhead in ques- 
tion. We realize it's extra work, and it's not fair 
to the honest people. It's too bad that just a few 
had to ruin it for the whole class. 

Final Notes. The winner of this competi- 
tion will win the customary $100 worth of stuff 
made by Softalk advertisers and will hold the ti- 
tle of Softalk Subhead Savior of 1983. Remem- 
ber, no copying off your neighbor's papers, and 
neatness counts. Here's an example: 

Sometimes he thought he'd rather be bored 
(Dec. '82, p. 46) than sit around solving the 
riddles of space and time. When that became 
too much to look at, he knew he'd better start 
looking to get out (Dec. '82, p. 60). 

That's why he was going to call Colette 
and confess. 

It would be rescue by remote resource 
(Dec. '82, p. 308), he quipped to himself as he 
dialed. 

"Hello?" 

He felt luminously lucky (Dec. '82, p. 250) 
she was in. "Hello, Colette? This is Frank. 
Whatcha doing?" 

"Well, my Apple IX just arrived, and the 
gang's all here (Dec. '82, p. 105). 

Well, we could go on and on, but you get 
the idea of how this is supposed to work. Of 
course, yours will be somewhat longer and have 
a beginning, middle, and ending to it. 

Send in your entry with this coupon to: Sof- 
talk Subs, Box 60, North Hollywood, CA

JANUARY 1983 



Votes Are In; 

Numbers Unclear 



It's My Party. The country is in a serious 
recession; unemployment is soaring, and future 
Social Security benefits are being threatened. 
The only person who could possibly benefit 
from such tragic conditions with a clear con- 
science is Edward Radanovich of Bellevue, Ne- 
braska, the winner of Part 5 of the Oracle '82 
contest. 

Such a dismal economic outlook played an 
important role in the voters' giving the Demo- 
crats a stronghold on the House of Representa- 
tives, and Radanovich predicted a year ago that 
last November's elections would put 219 Re- 
publicans and 316 Democrats into Congress. 

It wasn't exactly a wild guess. "I went down 
to the library and looked up past years' elec- 
tions," says Radanovich. "The pattern seemed 
to be that whenever there was an off-year elec- 
tion the controlling party lost seats in the House 



of Representatives." 

The actual count was 220 Republicans and 
315 Democrats, giving Radanovich a score of 
-2. But he wasn't the only one with that score. 

Tom O'Brien and Marc Epstein, both from 
Portland, Oregon, submitted predictions of 220 
Republicans, 313 Democrats, and 218 Republi- 
cans, 315 Democrats, respectively. Because of 
the three-way tie, Radanovich, O'Brien, and 
Epstein all slugged it out in the random num- 
ber generator. 

It was neither pretty sight nor fair fight. 
During the first round, Epstein held Radano- 
vich while O'Brien slugged Radanovich. In the 
second round, O'Brien held Radanovich while 
Epstein slugged Radanovich. But during the 
third round, O'Brien and Epstein held and 
slugged each other, while Radanovich slipped 
out the back door.

it up at his local store, Computer Works. 

Don't Forget the Senate. One of the decid- 
ing factors was that a lot of you forgot to count 
the Senate when counting your congressmen. 
Several contestants (those of you who are kick- 
ing yourselves) hit right on the nose or came 
very close for number of Republicans and 
Democrats in the House of Representatives. 
But because you left your senators sitting out in 
the cold, we had to subtract 100 points from 
your score. Sorry (heh, heh). 

By the way, Epstein and O'Brien are still in 
the RNG pummeling each other to pieces. 
Hope they realize the contest is over in time to 
get back for the final part. 

Digging Sig Fig Gig. October's venture in- 
to higher mathematics certainly separated the 
slide rules from the Univacs. A relative handful 
of entrants came up with the Significant Fig- 
ure, and half that handful successfully assessed 
said figure's significance. 

The figure in question was, of course, that 
old favorite, 11616125. For the finicky hair- 
splitters among you, it was also 1 1616125.3, and 
such answers were accepted as correct. (Just 
keeping you on your toes.) The winner of Part 1 
split that hair down to two decimal places, but 
the random number generator loved him any- 
way. Larry Houston (Peru, IN) will receive his 
Bag of Tricks, Diversi DOS, and copy of Prac- 
tical Micro Programming through Huntington 
Computing, as there is no dealer within thirty 
miles of him. 

Whiz with decimals though he may be, Lar- 
ry didn't even take a stab at the significance of 
the figure, making things that much easier on 
the excitable RNG in selecting Laura Kirsch- 
baum (Shoreview, MN) as the winner of the 
contest's second part. As she put it: "Substitut- 
ing letters of the alphabet for numbers to the 
left of the decimal yields 1 = A, 16 = P, 16 = P, 
12 = L, 5 = E . . . 1 1616125 = APPLE." Spe- 
cial thanks to Laura for getting us off the hook, 
decimal-wise, by pointing out that "the 3 to the 
right of the decimal represents the third digit: 2 
(0, 1, 2 . . .). So 11616125.3 = APPLE.2." Ab- 
solutely right. Laura wants Prisoner 2 (appro- 
priately) and Rendezvous, washed down with 
Raster Blaster, Alien Rain, or Firebug, our 
choice. For being so rude as to correct our spell- 
ing of the possessive form of Beatles, she'll just 
have to remain in suspense as to which one she's 
going to get. 

Contest Notes. Man is a funny animal. Did 
you ever notice that, when worst comes to worst 
and life is hanging by a thread, we resort to all 
sorts of things to make our last gasps of breath 
valiant ones? 

Witness the hapless person caught in a fall- 
ing elevator, the cable of which has snapped. As 
he plummets toward the bottom of the shaft, he 
doesn't collect himself and pray for his salva- 
tion after death, nor does his life flash before 
him. Instead, he tries to time the fall of the ele- 
vator just right so he can jump up when the ele- 
vator is six inches from the ground. Go ahead 
and laugh. Ridiculous as it seems, such a silly 



SPY'S 




Somewhere on each floor of the Soviet diplomatic mission in 
Pyongyang are the nine parts of an encoded message. Your 
future is assured if you can just find those pieces and put 
them together, and then solve the puzzle. But to do so you 
must avoid the embassy guards who make frequent rounds at 
unscheduled intervals. They don't ask questions first, either. 





You got a late start looking for that summer job, and all you 
could find was a baker apprentice position at the Automated 
Bakery Company. Simple enough, since the pies are made 
by machine ... all you have to do is add topping and put 
the pies away when they come out on the conveyor belt. 
Shouldn't be too difficult of a summer, you think to 
yourself . . .

MICROBUFFER WIU 
SPEED UP ANY PROGRAM 
THAT REQUIRES PRINTING. 



MICROBUFFER ALIOWS YOU 
TO PRINT AND PROCESS 
SIMULTANEOUSLY 

Now you don't have to wait for 
the printer to finish before you 
can use your computer again. 

YOU CAN DUMP 
PRINTING DATA DIRECTLY 
TO MICROBUFFER. 

Unlike your printer, Microbuffer 
accepts data as fast as your 
computer can send it. So there's 
never a bottleneck. 

Microbuffer first stores the 
data in its own memory buffer 
and then takes control of your 
printer. This frees the computer 
for more productive functions. 

Additional output may be 
dumped to the buffer at any 
time and it will be printed in 
turn. 

THERE IS A MICROBUFFER 
FOR ANY PRINTER/COMPUTER 
COMBINATION. 

Microbuffers are available in 
Centronics-compatible parallel 
or RS-232C serial versions. 

FOR APPLE II COMPUTERS, 
Microbuffer II features on-board 



firmware for text formatting and , 
advanced graphics dump 
routines. Both serial and parallel 
versions have very low power 
consumption. Special functions 
include Basic listing formatter, 
self-test, buffer zap, and 
transparent and maintain modes. 
The 16K model is priced at $259 
and the 32K, at $299. 

FOR EPSON PRINTERS, Microbuffer 
is $159 in either an 8K serial or a 
16K parallel version. The serial 
buffer supports both hardware 
handshaking and XON-XOFF 
software handshaking at baud 
rates up to 19,200. Both Epson 
interfaces are compatible with all 
Epson commands 
including GRAFTRAX-80 and 
GRAFTRAX-80-I-. 

ALL OTHER PRINTER/COMPUTER 
COMBINATIONS are sen/ed by the 
in-line, stand-alone Microbuffers. 
Both serial and parallel versions 
are expandable up to 256K. The 
serial stand-alone will support 
different input and output baud 
rates and handshake protocol. 
The 32K model starts at $299, 
64K for $349. 64K add-ons for up 
to a total of 256K are just $179. 

When you think of how much 
time Microbuffer will save, 
can you afford to not have one? 



SIMPLE TO INSTALL. 

Microbuffer II is slot-independent. 
It will fit directly inside the Apple 
II in any slot except zero. 

Microbuffer for your Epson 
mounts easily in the existing 
auxiliary slot directly inside the 
printer. 

The stand-alone Microbuffer is 
installed in-line between virtually 
any printer and computer. 

MICROBUFFER FROM 
PRACTICAL PERIPHERALS. 

Practical Peripherals is dedicated 
to establishing new industry 
standards for product performance. 

The un-retouched photo at left 
has been enlarged to demostrate 
Microbuffer's exact workmanship 
and precise attention to detail. 
Specifications demand that each 
board undergo 36 seperate tests 
and inspections before it can 
leave the factory.

successful new product of the 
year — Microbuffer.

move is your best bet when you're about to go 
under. 

Or, how about those cartoon characters 
who start flapping their arms violently in a vain 
attempt to fly back to the cliffs edge that 
they've just run off. Or when massive boulders 
are about to crush them, they open up umbrel- 
las while gritting their teeth, hoping for the best. 
We laugh at them because it's silly how our 
minds work in desperate times. 

Now, let's all laugh (in good fun, of course) 
at some silly antics of contestants in des- 
peration. 

Who's Who Here? Hey, kids, is Carl Muell- 
er (Murfreesboro, TN) in your class at school? 
If he is, tell the teacher to keep an eye on him 
during the next test. Carl sent in duplicate en- 
tries (both wrong) — one for himself and one for 
a mysterious "Karl Miller." We'll just assume 
Mueller is going through an identity crisis. 

We all generally agree that finding the val- 
ues of the letters was only slightly challenging. 
Plugging them into the formula and solving for 
the value of A was a bit messy, but not impos- 
sible for anyone who can operate a calculator. 
Apparently, some of you didn't even think 
of that. 

Dishonorable mentions go to everyone who 
submitted entries with 6502 as a wild guess. 

Paulette Caswell (Los Angeles, CA) gets 
eight such mentions. She entered, "The signifi- 
cant figure is: 6502 or 7825 or 4050 or 8100 
or 8225 or 3,912.5 or 68,952,523.80 or 
7,997.26028. If I win, I'd Uke to have something 



that makes my Apple II talk." Considering Cas- 
well's entry, we would have sent her something 
to make her Apple stop talking. 

Then there's Jean Armour (Liverpool, NY) 
and the gang at the Liverpool Public Library. 
"Dear guys: Every month we enter, and every 
month we don't win. We are a worthy cause! 
Please let us win this time. One of our patrons 
was a codesigner of the 6502 microprocessor, so 
we should get extra credit, providing that it is 
the correct answer." Well, provided that your 
answer was incorrect, we're not sending you 
anything. But you are a worthy cause, and we 
know a certain former movie star in Washing- 
ton that you should write to for extra credit if 
your public funds ever run out. 

Luke Meade (Yorktown Heights, NY), you 
have only your math teachers to blame for your 
blunder. Meade told us, "The times T' in the 
middle of your equation eliminates everything 
preceding it (T = 0). Tricky, but as I am taking 
math right now I look for that sort of thing." 
Dam the luck, Luke. That inaccurate math rule 
also eliminated you from the contest. Send your 
math teacher to detention hall. 

Meade's math teacher sure gets around. 
Sam Robinson (La Mesa, CA) probably takes 
classes from him, too. "Since T = 0, the first 
part of the problem may be left off. You guys 
made it too easy!" Thanks, Sam. You made it 
real easy to leave your whole entry off the win- 
ners' list! 

But we bet Robinson's a lot of fun at 
parties. After blowing the contest and coming

up with 255,600 as his answer, he wrote, "The 
really significant part is the way you worded the 
problem. The significant figure is 2 (the signifi- 
cant figure of 255,600). Since rule 4 said the ex- 
planation must be more than two words but 
fewer than A words long, I will not tell you the 
significance of this number." That's okay, Sam. 
We won't tell you the price of the 1983 Merce- 
des you just missed winning. 

Essay Test. By far, the most interesting an- 
swers came from two contestants who were con- 
vinced that their wrong answers were right, and 
who could probably also convince anyone else 
they were right. First, there was Steve Emmett 
(Herndon, VA), who determined his A to be 
equal to 11,510,789.3. Here's how Emmett 
figured it: 

"The significance is learned by turning the 
number upside down and using a little imagi- 
nation to arrive at 'E. Galois II,' for Evariste 
Galois II. 

"As you know, Galois is credited with the 
founding of modern abstract algebra. [Sure, 
Steve, anybody knows that!] He gave impetus to 
the development of the theory of abstract 
groups. He also developed a general theory in- 
dicating the impossibility of finite algebraic for- 
mulation of solutions for polynomial equations 
of all degrees greater than 4." 

Well, that's all very interesting, Steve, but 
because you used the wrong number we can't 
award you anything. By the way, your zip code 
turned upside down spells "Ilozz." As you 
know, that's Bezardian for "contests just aren't 
smiling upon you these days." 

Our final "Gee, that's nice, but you're 
wrong" goes to Bernard Bopp (Toledo, OH). 
Bopp got all the clues right, but his computa- 
tion skills went bopping out the door. He came 
up with 2,975,376.39 as his figure. So, what does 
it mean? 

"My wife, a librarian, had the flash of in- 
sight on this: the number is a patent. It was filed 
on March 14, 1961, to the Princeton physicist 
Robert H. Dicke and refers to a special stable 
oscillator, which subsequently had a great im- 
pact on precise timekeeping (an atomic clock). 
Without precise time, precise navigation is im- 
possible. Precise navigation was and is abso- 
lutely necessary for space missions. Orbital 
docking maneuvers, for example, would be im- 
possible if celestial positions were known to a 
low accuracy. 

"The space program was the prime impetus 
for miniaturization of electronic components; if 
the Apollo missions had not taken place, there 
would likely be no integrated circuits or miao- 
processors. And, if Dr. Dicke had not de- 
veloped his stable oscillator, then Apollo, mi- 
croprocessors, Apple lis, and, yes, even So/talk 
might not exist." 

Wow! What a long way to go just to be told, 
"Sorry, Mr. Bopp. Not even close." But the 
speculation of So/talk not existing piqued our 
curiosity. We showed Bopp's contest entry to a 
local gypsy clairvoyant who told us that if Dr. 
Dicke had not developed his oscillator, we 
would still have a magazine — Softalk for the 
Smith Corona Adding Machine. So there. 




lb Do It Right 

To make a Winchester disk for just Apple®II. 



That's how we set out to design our hard disk for 
the Apple®II. To understand the needs of serious 
users and programmers, and to correct the errors 
of our predecessors. 

You want user-friendliness. So we wrote hard disk 
versions of Apple DOS, CP/M® and Pascal that 
are highly user-friendly and loaded with 
useful features. 

□ Auto-boot hard disk 

□ Menu-driven utilities 

□ Single-licystroke program execution in DOS 

□ Disk searchi with wild cards, and many more 

You want flexibility. So we made every 
feature variable. 

□ From 1 to 16 operating systems on each disk 

□ Operating system spaces grow as needed 

□ Slot independence 

□ Variable size volumes (to 400K in DOS) 

□ Mountable and unmountable volumes (even in CP/M) 

□ Custom DOS allowed 

You want reliability. We use the leading drive. 
And Corona's unique data protection technology. 

□ DataGuard™ 32-bit error correction code 

□ Failsafe™ read-after-write and automatic bad-sector reallocation 

□ 2-level impact-protection packaging 



You want low-cost backup. So we wrote backup 
utilities that make floppy backup convenient. 

□ File compacting to reduce the number of floppies 

□ Volume selective backup in all operating systems 

□ Automatic diskette sequencing to ease floppy handling 

You want compatibility. We maximize compati- 
bility with existing software and peripheral cards. 

□ 9K interface card leaves main memory untouched 

□ Interrupts are allowed 

□ Boot protected floppies from slot 6 without removing hard disk 

□ Automatic slot/drive to hard disk remapping 

And you want support. We do that right too. 

□ Hardware depot service in every region 

□ Software theft-protection on the hard disk 

Compare the features that matter to you. 
And visit our local dealer or distributor for 
a demonstration. You'll see the diflerence 
specialization makes.

Fastalk is your quick guide to popular, special- 
ized, or classic software. Programs appearing in Fas- 
talk must meet one or more of the following criteria: 
(1) equal or surpass in sales the least-selling program 
to appear on any of the current bestseller lists; (2) re- 
late to a specialized subject area and be in general dis- 
tribution (more specialized packages and areas will be 
included as Fastalk matures); (3) be new and of pro- 
fessional quality (such programs will be carried for 
one month only — after that, they must meet other cri- 
teria for inclusion); (4) stand out as extraordinary. 

Designation as a classic is noted by a bullet pre- 
ceding a program's title. 

Where opinion is expressed, Softalk has seen the 
software in question; the date of Soflalk's review, if 
any, is given at the end of the item.

Spinnater presents 
Delta Drawing. 




An mtrodtietion to the 
modern art of programming 
using the aneient art 
of drawing. 



Spinnaker Software Corp., 1982 



Kids love to draw. 

And with Delta Drawing, your children 
can have fun creating their own colorful 
drawings, and at the same time, learn 
about computer programming. 

Delta Drawing is much more than 
Just a fun game. Ifs an educational 
tool that helps children develop their 
creativity, learn to write computer pro- 
grams and 
build an 
understand- 
ing of pro- 
cedural 
thinhing. 





Easier to use than L0C50. 

Delta Drawing makes 
it easy for children to 
use the computer-even 
if they've never used a 
computer before. 

In fact it's easier to use than LOQO 
turtle graphics. And Delta Drawing costs 
less than half as much as LOQO. 

With Delta Drawing, your child controls 
the Delta cursor, and the Delta cursor 
controls all the action. 5o Kids can learn 
at their own pace while they're having fun. 
How your children will learn 
programming. 

With Delta Drawing, your child first 
creates a picture using simple, single- 
Key commands, for example: "D" for 
draw, "L" for left "E" for erase. 

As the picture is being drawn, the com- 
puter Keeps tracK of every KeystroKe 
and records it as a program. 

Then, by touching the "T" Key for "text 
mode," the child can see the program 



that was written. As children progress, 
they can begin to write their programs

500% Faster Loading of Textfiles, Integer, Applesoft & Binary 
and Six Powerful Extra Commands In Standard DOS 3.3 



30 out of 60 bought it on the spot when DAVID-DOS™ was 
demonstrated at the Original Apple Corps, UCLA. 



Automatically supports an Integer or Apple- 
soft Rom Card in any slot (without configuring). 

1. TLOAD Speed loads all Text Files. 

2. TLIST Lists aX\ Text Files to screen/printer. 

3. DUMP Binary/ Ascii to screen or printer. 

4. DISA Disassembles Binary to screen/ printer. 

5. AL Prints program Address & Length. 

6. HIDOS DOS moves itself to Language Card 

These six commands operate identical to ex- 
isting DOS commands. Use A or AS for address 
and L or L$ for length. Enter them on the 
Keyboard and use them in Basic programs with 
the familiar D$. 

TLOAD loads a Visacalc Template of a hundred 
sectors in 7 seconds and TLIST scrolls it to 
screen or printer. TLOAD speed loads Se- 
quenticil and Random Text Files starting at 
$1000 or as specified by A. It loads the entire 
file or a smaller length specified by L. 

TLIST lists Sequential and Random Text Files 
to screen and printer. 



DUMP screen dumps memory with Ascii along 
the right side. Use A and L for specific dumps. 
Without them it starts at $00 and stops with 
return. 

DISA disassembles machine code to screen. 
Use A and L for specific routines. 

TLIST, DUMP and DISA Features: 

1. Print with PR# 

2. Key operated variable speed control. 

3. Instant pause with Space Bar. 

4. Exit anytime with Return Key. 

HIDOS command checks for a language card 
in slot O and moves DOS residing in memory 
to the card at $DD00. Himem is set at $BEOO 
adding 1 OK of free memory for programs. The 
Integer Card is still autornatically supported in 
any slot. $300 to $3D0 is kept free. 

ks of Apple Compurer Inr Visi( ale 



HIDOS has all previous commands and features 
operational and adds a 7th command FIND, 
Find searches 64 K memory in 3 seconds for 
any Hex sequence up to 31 bytes long and 
prints the addresses to screen. Hidos has an 
optional 8th command DATE configured for 
Mountain Hardware clocks and is useable in 
basic programs. 

DAVID- DOS is totally accurate and speed 
loads Integer without over-writing DOS. Great 
care was taken to keep DOS standard and 
compatible with most software. All DOS entry 
addresses have been preserved. Only two 
routines were moved to allow more room in 
command tables. Init areas were used for 
DAVID-DOS. Two extra variables are used in 
Zero Page. 

Catalog Free Space is also provided as an 
option. DAVID-DOS installs in seconds on any 
disk. Requires a 48K Apple II with DOS 3.3.

If you're one of the 
(happy, smart, ecstatic 
thousands who 
learned (quickly, 
clearly, non-boringly) 
to use their APPLE 
computers with our 
beginners' BASIC 
tutorial, The New 
Step By Step, then 
we (know, believe, 
swear) that Step By 
Step Two is ready to (ease, breeze, 
squeeze) you into the (advanced, inter- 
mediate, grown-up) world of PEEK and 
POKE, hexidecimal numbers, concaten- 
ations, and (much, much, much) more. 

On the other (hand, foot) if you didn't 
(grow with, thrill to, involve the whole 
family in) the PDI (learning, hands-on, 
fun) experience, here's what you missed: 

• Teaching techniques that teach | 

• Involvement you enjoy 

• Sounds that spur you on 

• Graphics that simplify 
the complex 

• Animation that makes 
this tutorial a stimulating 
experience. 

• A friendly voice that guides 
you to course completion 

The Step By Step Two program 
works this way: 

• the computer program sets up screen 
displays or sample programs for you. 




the cassette voice 
tells you what's 
happening, 
you (deal with, 
figure out, guess at) 
the answer 
the computer 
(praises, pans) your 
work. 

you (peruse, plunge 
into, practice in) the 
Work Book, 
after each lesson, 
you're (quizzed, 
queried, questioned). 

• you're then (prepared, practiced, 
primed) for the next lesson. 

• the final exam reveals all (superstars, 
slackers). 

There's lots to learn in Step By 
Step Two:

(good, great, grand) the Step By Step 

'Apple is a trademark of Apple Computer Corp. 



method is. Listen to our (critics, 
reviewers, i^^/^s): 

"If you want to learn BASIC or 
would like a little guidance and encour- 
agement added to what you already 
know, then the way to go is Step By 
Step." — Softalk 

"The Step By Step approach is the 
next best thing to having an experienced 
programmer by your side . . . Step By 
Step is a superb example of a successful 
blend of various media. The teaching 
principles are sound, the execution is 
virtually flawless, and the whole 
thing works." — Popular Computing. 

If you want to move ahead in BASIC 
programming, the next (simple, logical, 
shrewd) step is Step By Step Two. 

Step By Step Two is available at fine 
retail stores or direct from PDI for 
$89.95 plus $3.00 shipping and 
handling. (The package includes back-

Format n: 
Word processing 
so advanced 
anyone can use it. 





Format E was tested for six 
months in the demanding 
arena of Wall Street. Dis 
tributed by local deal- 
ers to law firms, finan- 
cial institutions, and 
the like, Format I was 
used by secretaries and 
non-technical personnel. Overwhelm 
mgly Format n was recognized as one of the easi- 
est and most effective word processing systems 
available in anyfoim. 

Here's why Format n is unique among word 
processing programs : 

What you see is what you get. Format II 
performs virtually any editing and formatting func- 
tion you can imagine and displays on the screen

System Saver " 

The most important periphei^ for your 




For Line Surge Suppression 

The SYSTEM SAVER provides es- 
sential protection to hardware and 
data from dangerous power surges 
and spikes. 




SYSTEM SAVER 
APPLE II 



By connecting the Apple II 
power input through the SYSTEM 
SAVER, power is controlled in two 
ways: 1) Dangerous voltage spikes 
are clipped off at a safe 130 Volts 
RMS/175 Volts dc level. 2) High fre- 
quency noise is smoothed out be- 
fore reaching the Apple E. A PI type 
filter attenuates common mode 
noise signals by a minimum of 
30 dB from 600 khz to 20 mhz, with 
a maximum attenuation of 50 dB. 



For Cooling 

As soon as you move to 64K RAM 
or 80 columns on your Apple n you 
need SYSTEM SAVER. 

Today's advanced peripheral 
cards generate more heat. In addi- 
tion, the cards block any natural air 
flow through the Apple H creating 
high temperature conditions that 
substantially reduce the Me of the 
cards and the computer itself. 



For Operating Efficiency 

SYSTEM SAVER contains two 
switched power outlets. As shown 
m the diagram, the SYSTEM 
SAVER efficiently organizes your 
system so that one convenient, 
front mounted 
power switch 
controls SYSTEM 
SAVER, Apple E, 
monitor and printer. 











APPlE II 




SYSTEM SAVER provides cor- 
rect cooUng. An efficient, quiet fan 
draws fresh air across the mother 
board, over the power supply and 
out the side ventilation slots. 



The heavy duty switch has a 
pilot light to alert when system is 
on .You'll never use the Apple power 
switch again!

FIRST THINGS FIRST 
LEARN ALL ABOUT IT! 




When you don't know the first thing about your new 
Apple ir you need a friendly, cheerful, easy going teacher at 
your side. And the ELEMENTARY APPLE Is just that kind of 
book. 

It sweeps away the confusion— explains your Apple in 
everyday language — shows you how to hook it up, how to use 
the keyboard and work on the screen. 

Gently and carefully it gives you an understanding of all 
the things your Apple can do. And then, it even shows how 
easy it is for anyone to write a simple program— provides 
common sense answers about graphics, utility programs, and 
the how and why of word processors, business programs and 
hardware like printers. 



Yes, there's a lot of information. But, not one chapter or 
one word is dull or difficult to follow or complicated. Prove it to 
yourself. Visit your computer store. Open the ELEMENTARY 
APPLE. Read a page of the introduction, then flip it open 
anywhere and read a paragraph or so. You'll find it's as 
understandable, as helpful and as marvelous as we say. 

If you, or a member of your family, is an Apple beginner, 
this is the book you need. It'll teach you everything you want to 
know, in the way you want to learn.

If yotir printer uses yotir Apple 
more than yoti do, 
yott need The Bufferboaid. 



If your Apple is locked into the "PRINT" 
mode so much that you've taken up soli- 
taire to kill the boredom, you need a 
buffer And if your computer is the Apple 
II or III, the only buffer for you is The 
Bufferboard. Expandable to 64K of stor- 
age, The Bufferboard stores an instantane- 
ous bucketful of print data from your 
computer Then it feeds the data to your 
printer at its own printing rate. Your Apple 
is set free from driving your printer and is 
ready for more data from you. 



or expensive power supplies are needed 
because The Bufferboard fits right into 
your Apple — and docks onto your existing 
printer interface. The result is convenient 





Take your existing interface — 
and buffer it! 

Only The Bufferboard has a simple 
Interface-Docking System. No bulky boxes 



and economical buffering of most popu- 
lar printer interfaces, including the 
Grappler + ™ interface, Epson interface, 
and Apple printer interface. Thirty sec- 
onds and a single hook-up are all you need 
to end the printer waiting game forever. 

Up to 20 letter-size pages 
stored at a time. 

The Bufferboard comes standard with 
16K, and is expandable to 32K or 64K of 
buffering capacity with the addition of 



memory chips. This "bucket" will hold up 
to 20 pages of a print job, allowing you 
freedom to use your Apple. 

The Bufferboard — designed 
excIttsivelY for the Apple Computer. 

Specifications: 

• Versions for Grappler + interface, Epson ; , 
interface, Apple interface, and other popu- 
lar printer interfaces • 16K buffer standard 

• Upgradcable to 32K or 64K • Automatic 
memory configuration • Automatic self 
test • Includes interface docking cable. 

The Bufferboard is made by Orange 
Micro, Inc. ; the same people who brought 
you the popular Grappler + printer inter- 
face. Both the Grappler -i- and The 
Bufferboard are now available at your 
local Apple dealer.

Finding Our Way — with Your Help 

1 have watched with interest as your magazine 
has grown in length from a couple dozen pages 
to its current few hundred pages. You do a tre- 
mendous job, but I do have some questions and 
suggestions. 

I appreciate the index of advertisers, but 
could you also provide an index of products? 
I'm sure this would add to your appeal to ad- 
vertisers, and it would enable us faithful read- 
ers to find information about a product with- 
out time-consuming searches of our entire Sof- 
talk library. Most computer magazines contain 
cards in which the reader circles an advertise- 
ment number, mails it in, and some weeks later 
literature is sent by the given advertiser to the 
reader. Will Softalk consider including such a card 



PROGRAMMABLE 
DATABASE 

At last there is a database witti good menus ttiat 
you can program. Ttiis database produces multiple 
labels for mailing complete with horizontal and ver- 
tical tabs settings. 

ON-LINE DATABASE is an accurate name given to 
this program because it VKas developed with high 
speed retrieval in mind. It is an excellent program to 
use on a network for keeping track of hundreds of 
filecards of information. Individual records can be 
printed while viewing, in either a screen print or a 
preset label format. Examples are included of files 
that can be used for mailing lists and have user 
defined parts in each record for general usage. 

ON-LINE DATABASE is written in Applesoft basic 
but all searches use a machine language binary 
search that easily finds one record out of a thou- 
sand in one second. Approximately 1000 names can 
fit on a single 143K floppy. Up to 239 characters can 
fit in each record. Up to 9 sort keys can be made on 
any part of any field. Complete facilities for chang- 
ing Slot, Drive, and Volumes are included with user 
programmable defaults. (Multiple files can be stored 
on a standard Apple DOS volume on any device sup- 
porting standard DOS 3.3. 

ON-LINE DATABASE creates standard Apple Ran- 
dom Access Text files for easy transferring of infor- 
mation to other languages and computers. The 
documentation and program were written for first 
time users of a computer. Included are sample 
datafiles and pictures of screens using the sample 
data.

in the future whereby readers can obtain more in- 
formation about the products advertised? 

Your Bestsellers list is great, but what rules 
do you follow when dividing games between ad- 
venture, strategy, and fantasy categories? Is it 
statistically possible for you to provide the dual 
rating services (a la Nielsen) and report per- 
centage of sales and units sold separately? I 
like to get my statistics in absolute as well as 
relative terms. Finally, why, oh why, does 
WordStar consistently rank in the Top Thirty, 
and usually the top three, in word processors 
and yet never get more than a passing mention 
in the accompanying text? I would think Word- 
Stars incredible staying power would be a con- 
tinuing wonder given that it costs three to seven 
times more than its competitors, counting re- 
quired hardware. 

How about a section for us modem users? 
Even though I'm a computer professional, I'm a 
novice in the area of data communications and 
have trouble even understanding the terms com- 
monly used. I need help, and I turn to you as a 
friend who has helped so much in the past. 

While you haven't had a lot of trouble in the 
past, I'd like to issue you a word of warning 
Please be very careful when directly comparing 
products, especially in the form of tables and 
checklists. Most of those comparisons done in 
magazines and books are both inaccurate in fact 
and misleading in presentation. As just one 
example, both Apple and IBM publish com- 
parison tables and each leads the reader to a to- 
tally different conclusion! 

I'd love to read a column containing gossip 
about the industry. No, not Tradetalk, which is 
too personnel-oriented, but one that deals with 
new products, trends, and the like. An example 
is Dvorak's column in InfoWorld. Your first 
topic might be the anticipated Apple Super II 
and other new Apple computers. 

The reviews are okay, but they would be 
better if a standard rating system was added. A 
grade for such aspects as performance, docu- 
mentation, support, and so forth would be help- 
ful. Also, what about a Softalk annual, which 
would contain the best of that year's articles, in- 
cluding all hardware and software reviews? I 
really would love nothing better than to see 
these changes in a 500-page Softalk that would 
be the industry standard for computer maga- 
zines. 

Edward D. Isenberg, Newark, CA 

Thank.s for the neat letter. 

The idea of having an index of products is 
being considered: a thorough index of products 
would entail a major .staff effort. Know anyone 
who can reprogram the universe for a thirty-hour 
day? As for a reader service card, Softalk 'j re- 
search and empirical experience has shown us 



that advertisers aren't equipped to respond to such 
cards, and that many readers request informa- 
tion they have no use for. Everyone loses. 

Here's how we categorize games: An adven- 
ture in the computer-gaming sense is a logic game 
in which the player must initiate commands to the 
game and solve puzzles in order to win. Fantasy 
role-playing games tend to entail the generation 
of characters that usually move through the game 
via single-key commands set forth in the instruc- 
tions: there may or may not be specific puzzles to 
.solve. Strategy encompasses all games in which 
specific rules must be brought to bear in planning 
moves in advance — whether on a World War II 
battlefield or on a chess board. 

Clearly, some games cross lines. We then put 
them where they seem to fit best. Oddly enough, 
we've been mistaken from time to time. Not hav- 
ing seen Ali Baba, we were misinformed as to its 
nature and carried it as an adventure when it 
should have been a fantasy. Castle Wolfenstein 
seemed to defy categorization. With the arrival of 
Aztec — also difficult to categorize, except it def- 
initely belongs with Wolfenstein — we're moving 
out of strategy and into . . . home-arcade? Fan- 
tasy? Good griefi. 

Regarding your desire for absolute sales fig- 
ures, few companies would appreciate having this 
published, nor do we consider these relevant to the 
poll. If you know how much any one program on 
the Top Thirty sold, you can extrapolate any 
other by reference to the index numbers. The in- 
dex also gives you a percentage-of-sales estimate. 

What did you think of the telecommunica- 
tions article in this issue by Dale Archibald? Re- 
sponse to it will influence how soon we institute a 
section devoted to modem use. 

Glad you noticed the lack of direct product 
comparisons. We avoid tables and checklists like 
the plague. Readers are apt to skip an article 
when it's supposedly summed up in a table: they 
might read only the table, and tables alone don't 
do a thorough, fair job. As for gossip columns — 
rumors are just that, by nature often untrue, and 
sometimes damaging. We'll wait for the facts. 

Finally, we feel a standard rating of programs 
falls right in there with tables and checklists. We 
will lead our readers to water, but they'll have to 
look to see it — we don't force them to drink. 

Binding a Friendship 

Since becoming a new Apple owner in the last 
six months I am very refreshed at all of the user 
friendliness I have come across in documenta- 
tion, tutorials, and magazine articles. After put- 
ting up with directions that are ambiguous, 
vague, and demanding, it is a nice change in- 
deed to see such a widespread loosening of the 
ties. Since I don't know who to thank directly, I 
am writing this to Softalk since many of those 
responsible will see it here.

A Paddle on the Back for Service 

Sooner or later any Apple II user is going to be 
in the market for a new set of paddles. The 
originals supplied by Apple just can't handle 
heavy-duty workouts that three kids in an Alien 
Typhoon tourney can generate. My local com- 



JANUARY 1983 



35 



puter store suggested the TG Products paddles 
as being able to stand up to demanding use for 
some time. 

I am quite happy with the performance of 
the TG paddles as far as their comfort and ac- 
tion in the games goes. This letter is not intend- 
ed to praise the paddles but rather to comment 
on the excellent service of the TG Products peo- 
ple when I finally did come up with a problem 
that required repair. I had the paddles for over a 
year when we started to notice that one po- 
tentiometer seemed to fail. Since the paddles 
were out of warranty, I decided to call TG Prod- 
ucts to get an estimate for repairing the set. I 
was given an address to send the paddles to and 
an estimate of less than $5. The paddles were 
mailed that day, and in less than a week they 
were delivered back to me. There was no charge 
for the repair. 

I think that the prompt, courteous, compe- 
tent, and conscientious service provided by this 
company deserves recognition and encourage- 
ment. I would have no hesitation to purchase 
from TG Products again.

Invariably Pleased 

I recently purchased Direct Mail from Venture 
Software, which I had seen advertised in Sof- 
lalk. Usually people take the time to complain 
about problems or their dissatisfaction with 
something, but I am so satisfied and impressed 
with the possibilities of this program that I 
wanted to pass along these thoughts to your 
readers. 

Direct Mail, along with Apple Writer, allows 
you to use embedded variables extensively 
throughout a form letter, making it very per- 
sonalized. I realize this isn't the only program 
available to insert variables into Apple Writer, 
but with the great help of Jim Mechachonis at 
Venture Software, I was able to use selected rec- 
ords from my existing popular database pro- 
gram, convert them into the Direct Mail for- 
mat, and use them as the variables in the form 
letter. The results have been outstanding. 

The converted variables were all upper 
case, but again with Direct Mail they were eas- 
ily edited to first letter only with upper case or 
made fully lower case when desired. It also has 
the capability of creating master files if you have 
no formal database. The flexibility, depth, and 
possibilities with Direct Mail are yet to be real- 
ized as far as I'm concerned.

Top Grade Support 

I would like to take this opportunity to make 
my fellow readers aware of my experiences with 
High Technology Software in Oklahoma City, 
Oklahoma. 

I purchased their Information Master data- 
base in December 1981. I intended to use it to 
store recipes and to keep a membership list for 
my church. I haven't figured out a good format 
yet for the recipes, but I'm sure there must be a 
way. As for the membership directory — it is ex- 
cellent. 

The manual states you can use one or two 



disk drives. This is true, but one disk drive is 
practically impossible to use with this program 
because of the amount of disk access and, there- 
fore, swapping. I now have two disk drives and 
the program works excellently. 

One drawback as far as I am concerned is 
that the program is copy protected. I would like 
to change a few items to suit me, mainly print- 
ing parameters. 

A major consideration is technical support. 
Here High Technology gets an A-plus. I have 
called several times and always received 
prompt, courteous responses to my questions. I 
recently crashed all of my data disks. I called 
and then sent them in. My disks were not only 
fixed, but an extra copy was sent on a free disk! 

I feel it is important to give praise or criti- 
cism where deserved. In this case. High Tech- 
nology is to be commended for their excellent 
support of a good program. The program man- 
ual is extensive and well done, with many ex- 
amples. The program is user-friendly and easy 
to use. I highly recommend both Information 
Master and High Technology.

Medical Assistance 

This is basically a letter of thanks and apprecia- 
tion to several companies, all of which have 
heljjed me extensively in setting up a program 
for my medical practice. 

Sierra On-Line distributes 77ie General 
Manager, an excellent database package that I 
used for the core of my program. I have recent- 



ly acquired the new 2.0 version and I must say it 
really hves up to its expectations. The manual 
has been done over with more clarity. 

Brillig Systems is the company where this 
program was originally designed. The authors 
provided much information that helped me 
modify the program, another nice feature about 
this database. You can have user programs and 
customize your use of the program. 

Floppy Disk Services, in New Jersey, is the 
company that I bought a hard disk drive 
through when I rapidly exceeded the capacity of 
two floppies. QCS, also in New Jersey, is the 
manufacturer of the hard disk drive (ten mega- 
byte, one-year warranty). 

The whole system is now working great. 
More than 1,000 accounts are on it; access time 
to find a patient is about two seconds. It runs on 
an Apple II Plus with two floppies from Rana 
Drives and one printer. All this is thanks to the 
above companies and their excellent backup 
support.

An Interface of Responsibilities 

Piracy has always been a heated topic of dia- 
logue among readers of Softalk, and opinions 
representing every side of the issue have been 
aired through Open Discussion. The following 
two letters are the culmination of such a dialogue. 

It all began back in May 1982 with two let- 
ters from J. Barry Smith. One of Smith's points 
was: "Piracy is a biased word; it implies theft. As 
they say, it all depends on which ox is being

gored. Mine is my wallet, so my policy on copy- 
ing is this: If I can get it, I will." Furthermore, he 
stated- "Copy protection is an indefensible, self- 
defeating, technically impossible, unenforceable, 
greedy policy." 

A letter of appreciation from Mark Pelczar- 
ski—for the positive user response to Penguin 
Software's decision not to copy protect its prod- 
ucts (excluding games) — appeared in Open Dis- 
cussion, July 1982. This letter contained a reac- 
tion to Smith's position. To wit: "Sorry. [Piracy] 
doesn't imply theft. It is theft. There are no two 
ways about it. When you take something that 
doesn't belong to you, it's got a simple one-word 
definition: stealing. . . . If that's the definition of a 
pirate, then, yes, you're a thief. And if you steal 
because you can't afford the software then you 
had no business buying a computer in the first 
place." 

Mark Pelczarski wants readers to know that 
he is responding on principle, and that none of J. 
Barry Smith's comments were directed specifi- 
cally toward Penguin Software. Now, let us pick 
up this dialogue where it left off. Here's Smith's 
response: 

Thief? Thief? Who's calling who a thief? A para- 
graph in an Open Discussion letter starts out 
with my name, Barry, and later on states, "... 
yes, you're a thief." I say to the writer, noted 
publisher Mark Pelczarski of Penguin Soft- 
ware: Them thar's fightin' words where I come 
from, pardner. I trust your monitor was smil- 
ing when it displayed those words. 

Let's settle this dispute the modern, 1982 
way: Sue me. I'm serious; I'll accommodate 
you. Here's the deal. You make up some coded 
program and protect it by scrambling it some- 
how. Send off your ten bucks to the copyright 
office with your listings and then sell it to me for 
eleven dollars. In the presence of you, your law- 
yer, and a videotape machine, I will break the 
code, copy it, and give the copy to a friend of 
mine. You then prosecute me. Let's get this 
right-to-copy argument out into the open and 
into the courts. 

You say I'm breaking the law and I say I'm 
not. Let's let the experts decide. Let's set a 
precedent! 

A small item of interest: Did you know that 
the number-one Apple game program of 1981 
was a computer version of the hardwired pin- 
ball game, Firepoweil I believe not one penny 
in royalties was paid by the programmer or soft- 
ware publisher to Williams Company, the mak- 
ers of the original game. Maybe we are all 
pirates trying to keep the bounty as long as 
we can. 

Enough of legal arguments; how about a se- 
mantic one? For the record, artificial intelli- 
gence exists, has existed, and will exist., I sug- 
gest changing the name to reflect accurately 
what is going on. The results of any program 
written by humans shall be called distilled in- 
telligence. The results of any program that the 
computer writes shall be called synthetic intelh- 
gence. Distilled and synthetic sound so much 
better than artificial, and they convey an accurate 
description of the vague noun intelligence.

Shall Franklin Ace owners be welcomed in- 
to the Softalk fraternity/sorority? I vote yes. 
The issue is software, not hardware. Maybe 
competition will get Apple to improve their 
product as technology improves. Does the Ace 
with Micro-Sci disk drives really run Apple soft- 
ware? 

Two "must" movies for all of us to see are 
Blade Runner and Tron. These films ask some 
very profound questions in an incredibly visual 
manner. 

I tried to run the program of my life the 
other day and got a "branch error at 29" mes- 
sage. It appears there is a bug in my life master 
program and I can't find it. It loads okay, runs 
sporadically, but won't list. Maybe somebody 
has it copy-protected. 

You know, Mark, I was serious when I said 
"pardner," because we are partners in a sense. 
What programmers do is fantastic. It's too hard 
for me; I can't do it. You are entitled to all the 
cash you can get, at the point of sale. You dis- 
covered secrets and then sold them away. You 
create and sell, and I buy. Without each other 
we both are not as productive. Where does the 
money ultimately come from? (It does boil 
down to money, after all, doesn't it?) 

It comes from me, the consumer. Without 
the consumer spending the cash there is no 
computer revolution, or at least it will be a very 
lonely one with the hardware, software, and re- 
tail people all standing around complaining 
about software piracy. 

As a consumer, I accuse the hardware 
manufacturers of selling defective products. As 
a consumer, I accuse the software creators of 
selling programs that won't boot, won't run, 
and don't make sense when they do. As a con- 
sumer, I accuse the retailers of being shifty, in- 
competent, and rude. As a consumer, I accuse 
consumers of being the stupidest people in the 
world for being so exuberant in the dream that 
we put up with it all. We buy hundred-dollar 
programs without demanding that we be given 
a demonstration. We send off our money to 
places unseen for products unproven. We ac- 
cept lies from salespeople. We make do with pe- 
ripheral boards that marginally work. And we 
adapt to programs that are unwieldy and un- 
friendly. Evidently we believe promises because 
we want to believe. 
J. Bariy Smith, Barstow, CA 

Mark Pelczarski's reply: 

Barry. No, I don't want to fool around with 
taking you to court. That whole proposition is a 
little absurd. And, yes, there are already prece- 
dents upholding the copyright laws. The courts 
don't need to be reminded every six months. 
But mostly I don't want to bother because I not 
only do this for a living, I do what I do because 
I enjoy it. It annoys me when I have to take 
what could be productive time and deal with 
people who take advantage of what I do by rip- 
ping it off. The nice part is that most people 
aren't like that, and it is truly fun working and 
dealing with them. Yes, there will always be 
court cases for those who can't abide by com- 



mon sense, but those people are in the minority 
it seems. Most people seem to be teaching their 
children well. 

Your entire letter is put more into perspec- 
tive by your last paragraph. I assert that there 
are incompetent people in any field. There are 
also those who genuinely care about their prod- 
ucts and their customers. You are overlooking 
the fact that you, as a consumer, have a respon- 
sibility too. If you just go out and buy anything 
without looking, you are going to make some 
decent purchases but also some very foolish 
ones. As long as people keep buying from those 
who are incompetent, the incompetents will stay 
in business. It's your responsibility to yourself 
to care about what you buy. 
Mark Pelczarski, Geneva, IL 

Impression Correction 

The review of The Animator that appeared in 
Marketalk Reviews (October 1982) did a fine 
job of explaining many of the features of the 
system. We would, however, like to correct a 
couple of misimpressions. 

The Animator is designed to produce film 
strips that contain motion that is more compli- 
cated and detailed than what is usually seen on 
microcomputers. For example, the ballet demo 
utilizes a figure that has twelve independently 
moving body parts. The system is not designed 
to produce the simple, repetitive (but pad- 
dle/key controlled) motion found in computer 
games. The Animator will produce titles that 
move in interesting ways and can be incor-

porated into video productions. The docu- 
mentation explains how users can add the ani- 
mated strips to their own Applesoft programs. 

In conclusion, the primary design goal is to 
provide a means for making intricate modon

III CQock High 

A thunderous round of applause for John Jepp- 
son's article "It's III O'Clock and All's Well" 
(November 1982). As manufacturers of the 
Thunderclock Plus, Thunderware was pleased 
to see the subject of the Apple III clock covered 
so lucidly. We would like to take this oppor- 
tunity to clarify a few points. 

On the subject of timekeeping accuracy, the 
Thunderclock comes factory-adjusted to 
operate in the average Apple II internal tem- 
perature range. This results in typical accuracy 
of plus or minus a few seconds a week. The user 
can adjust the Thunderclock for unusually 
warm or cool environments using the simple 
calibration procedure in the manual. Tempera- 
ture is the dominant factor affecting the accur- 
racy of any quartz-crystal-controlled clock. The 
Thunderclock, the Apple III, and most quartz 
watches all use the same type of quartz crystal. 
Quartz wristwatches have the advantage of 
being maintained at a very nearly constant tem- 
perature, that of the wearer's wrist. As a conse- 
quence, they can be very accurate timekeepers.

clock Plus was developed and made available 
by Apple Computer when they could not de- 
liver Apple Ills with the original system clock. 
We were pleased that Apple was recommend- 
ing our product for use in the Apple III even 
though it was designed for the Apple II. This 
turned out to be a somewhat mixed blessing. 
Apple, in their haste to solve their problem, 
failed to give Thunderware an opportunity to 
review or comment on their SOS driver and the 
accompanying documentation. Both, it turned 
out, were woefully inadequate. Poor documen- 
tation, bugs, and, worst of all, the Apple-de- 
veloped driver that was not designed to time 
and date stamp disk files plagued most Apple 
III owners using the clock. 

Now, thanks to the efforts of John Jeppson, 
we have a much improved Thunderclock 
driver for the Apple III along with complete 
user documentation. Dr. Jeppson's new driver 
includes both corrections to the original driver 
and the update driver discussed in his article. 
The documentation contains complete instruc- 
tions for installing and using the Thunderclock 
Plus with the Apple III.

Froggy Would a'Wooing Go 

I find your review of Frogger (December 1982) 
very confusing and frustrating. Confusing be- 
cause of its rabid inconsistencies, it being a 
negative review about a product you said many 
positive things about; frustrating because you 
have criticized our product simply because you 
feel it is "graphically no better than others like it 
on the market," which is akin to saying "She's 
as ugly as her sister because they're twins." 

To expand on the inconsistencies of the 
review. ... I contend, as an Apple owner and a 
software publisher, that a game product review 
should judge the gaming value of the product in 
question. (That is, is the game fun? Is it worth 
playing multiple times? It is easy to understand?) 
I feel that Frogger deserves a yes! answer on all 
those counts, and, from the wording of your re- 
view, you agree with me. 

Why, then, is the overall tone of your re- 
view so extremely negative? Especially when 
lines like "the game is fiin to play" and "Frogger 
is a good game" appear throughout. I have to 
question the reasoning for a negafive review on 
any game that is "fun to play," "elegant in its 
simplicity," and "habit forming." (Your word- 
ing, not mine — although I have to agree.) 

The only "real" ground for criticism that 
you may have of Frogger is the graphics — but 
isn't that blame a little misplaced? As a maga- 
zine devoted to supporting the Apple and its 
owners, you more than anyone should, know 
the extreme limits of the machine. The origin of 
the "lackluster graphics" you complain of stems 
from the very hardware that we all know and 
love — Apple II. That's right, the Apple. 

Yet even with its lack of color scrolling 
abilities and its bothersome habit of making 
mud of any white object on a colored field, even 
with the multitude of other problems that Apple 
graphics present, we made a "fun to play," ele-

gantly simple," and "habit forming" Frogger 
game, complete with blue ponds, colorful cars, 
female frogs, scrolling logs, and all of the other 
bells and whistles that people expect from Frog- 
ger. Granted, Apple Frogger isn't Atari Frog- 
ger— hMl then Apple hardware ain't Atari 
hardware either. We did the best implementa- 
tion that we could with the resources we had 
available. We are proud of it, SEGA (the maker 
of the original Frogger for coin-ops) endorses it, 
and we think that Apple owners will enjoy it. 
We know that we do.

Here's Looking Through You 

Since computers and programming are new to 
me, I find so many ideas in your magazine that 
it is hard to know what to try first. As a matter 
of fact, there seems to be more to your efforts 
than just publishing. 

I have an interest in photography also. No 
doubt several others will ask you, but, in case 
they don't, I believe you owe us an explanation 
about the picture to the lower right on page 32 
of the September 1982 issue. 

Is Mark Overgaard still with us? What he 
"says" (Pascal) may not be so transparent to 
some of us, but it appears that he is. Was this a 
ghost of things to come in October? In case the 
photographer had a hand in the nondestructive 
graphics printover, I would like to know the 
technique or equipment used. That must have 
been one heck of a blinding flash, or was the 
photographer using x-ray sources? Well, back 
to the manuals, while I wait with interest to see 
your next revelation.

work, you don't want something that's going to 
tell you that you're out of disk space. 

Screenwriter II is also above reproach. 5m- 
perScribe II wrote my 1 1 5-page master's thesis 
effortlessly. They provided the update in five 
days for fifteen dollars including a backup that I 
have never needed to use. At home I use 
Screenwriter II with a single disk drive; at 
work, a second drive speeds things up only 
slightly. The RAM card version is exceptional- 
ly faster, but not that necessary. Every time I've 
called Sierra On-Line, they have solved every 
problem, save one. We are using ScreenWriter 
II to teach word processing to our students. We 
wanted fifteen copies of the manual, sparing us 
a complicated photocopy job, so that each stu- 



dent could have one for reference. They stated 
that their policy was to sell the entire package 
only. I can understand why they won't sell ex- 
tra copies of the manual; with everybody rip- 
ping off software like mad, I would hold onto 
my manuals too. Tough Trotskies — it is still the 
best word processing package I have found. 

For a comprehensive review of word proc- 
essors, I might suggest the July/August issue of 
Peelings II to the person whose letter, entitled 
"Pass the Word," appeared in October Open 
Discussion. In this librarian's opinion, the best 
software reviews anywhere can be found in this 
magazine.

Smoldering in the Stacks 

As a librarian with no more programming skills 
than understanding that a gosub takes the code 
somewhere else, I highly resent hot-shot com- 
ments like the ones that appeared from some 
readers in the October Open Discussion con- 
cerning Stone's DB Master and Sierra On- 
Line's ScreenWriter II. 

The micro is the only computer that many 
small school, public, and special Ubraries will be 
able to afford for quite a long time. The value of 
the machine lies in the fact that available soft- 
ware can be put to use at minimal expense, with 
no programming expertise required on the part 
of the library staff. We don't need to change 
things if we can get them to work for us; in fact, 
changing code will screw us up a lot more than 
leaving things as they are.. 

As for DB Master being unfriendly, I admit 
I use it nearly every day and have yet to dis- 
cover half of its power. We keep everything 
from film booking data to bibhographies on it. 
It crunches data every day and has never failed 
us in the creation of expansible files. In library

gramming skills and all the retraining involved 
in becoming programmers is unnecessary. We 
have good software available to us now. DB 
Master and Screen Writer II can be counted in 
this score. For the critics who possess the skill to 
write better code, go ahead and do it. Then let 
me see if I can put it to use in my library. 

As a postscript, I picked up a copy of Di- 
versi-DOS in Rockford, Illinois, last week. (We 
have to go thirty miles to find a computer 
store.) I have always stayed away from utilities 
that change the norm, but this disk is great! We 
put it on our gradebook program and the staff 
can't believe how it speeds up the Applesoft 
code. Kent Welling, our student programmer 
responsible for revising the gradebook, was 
equally impressed. I recommend it highly.

Of Rumors and Hints 

I was disappointed to hear about Reed Hub- 
bard's rating of Sierra On-Line's Cranston 
Manor (April Open Discussion). My mother 
and I have completed almost all of Sierra On- 
Line's adventures with the exception of Time 
Zone, which we are working on now. None of 
their adventures has disappointed us. That in- 
cludes Cranston Manor By the way, Reed, the 
ads state that the ghost of old man Cranston liv- 
ing in his house is a rumor, meaning that it may 
or may not be true. 

I must oommait on Sierra On-Line's custom- 
er support staff. Howard Luthy, the official 
hint-giver for the series, provided prompt and

efficient help when we needed it. When we played 
Kabul Spy, Sirius Software's staff and even Tim 
Wilson, the author, helped us. I believe a com- 
pany should attempt to give such assistance to 
the consumer when needed. 

I am pleased that some companies are con- 
verting to nonprotected software. Penguin Soft- 
ware's Graphics Magician has helped me with 
animation and picture drawing and has al- 
lowed me to customize the software to my lik- 
ing. It seems that after a few months Penguin 
Software is still going strong. Maybe other pub- 
lishers will borrow the same idea and then truly 
user-friendly programs will evolve.

Feedback from the Outback 

I noted a letter from Norman J. Wood in Open 
Discussion (July 1982) describing some failings 
in the Home A ccomtant that are similar to ones 
I've also found. I wrote to Continental Soft- 
ware with my questions and got a prompt re- 
ply, but the answers were not helpful. I find it 
most annoying that entries cannot be made to 
months other than those shown on the screen. 
When I wanted to go back a few months to the 
beginning of the financial year, I had to start 
again and then couldn't get to the budget cate- 
gories. I tried some text editing and bombed the 
disk, which isn't write-protected. Luckily I was 
able to restore an empty text file. Users of the 
program beware. 

One good thing about the program is that the 
date appears the correct way. first the day, then

the month and year. On the other hand, there 
are limitations to what it allows for in mailing 
addresses. The state segment is set up for only 
two characters, but the zip code requires five 
numbers. Don't they know that the English- 
speaking world extends beyond the United 
States? 

Readers may be interested that Home Ac- 
countant works with Fast DOS, available from 
Wytand P/L. This speeds up disk access three 
to five times, and it's proven to be one of my 
best investments.

One Picture Is Worth . . . 

We are now moving into a time when more and 
more families are investing in Apples for home 
use. Then, the question asked by puzzled par- 
ents is, "How do I get my child to do some- 
thing a little more studious than playing 
games?" Before buying a personal computer 
parents usually ask about the academic benefits 
for their children, only to see their dreams dis- 
solve into the home video arcade. 

As director of the Kids Computer Connec- 
tion I have found the use of graphics to be a 
very motivating means of introducing children 
to the world of programming. Graphics are col- 
orful, they allow for self expression and creativi- 
ty, and they can end up looking like the types of 
things seen in video games. Do not underesti- 
mate the power of graphics. In order to write a 
workable program, children must understand 
the whole concept of a program, plot their pic- 
ture on graph paper, plan ahead, and use a 
great deal of logical thinking. This easily leads 
to for-next loops, let, and goto statements. 

If the number of students that relinquish af- 
ter-school time and Saturdays to program is any 
indication of their willingness to learn graphics 
on the Apple, then graphics is truly a motivat- 
ing force for beginning programmers. 
Jim Tartaglia, Barre, MA 

Innocence Lost 

I want to comment on the state of pedagogy for 
computer innocents who are trying to learn as- 
sembly language. I'm one of them, and I'm 
ready to kill. 

First I ordered a copy of Randy Hyde's best 
seller. Using 6502 Assembly Language. Shortly 
after concluding that the author ought to re- 
turn to grammar school for a refresher course in 
English spelling and punctuation, I discovered 
that I had to purchase an assembler program (I 
told you I was innocent, didn't I?), and specifi- 
cally Mr. Hyde's LISA 2.5 program, to get any 
benefit out of the book. So I did. 

At the same time I ordered a copy of Roger 
Wagner's Assembly Lines: The Book. When it 
arrived, I determined that Mr. Wagner is at 
least literate, and that he endorses a variety of 
commercial assembler programs by name. 
LISA 2.5, however, is not among them de- 
spite its presence in your Fastalk listings as a 
long-time popular assembler. This was not 
reassuring. 

Now I had two texts on assembly language 
and the manual that came with LISA. I went

to work, or tried to. 

Hyde's text begins with a stultifying discus- 
sion of binary and hexadecimal operations. It 
stopped me cold. This material properly be- 
longs in an appendix, not as the first step to 
learning assembly programming. I may learn it 
eventually, or I may simply buy a hand-held 
converting calculator. Beyond the false start, the 
innumerable typos, the aforementioned gram- 
mar, and the virtual necessity for buying LISA, 
Hyde's book has one fatal defect: the index. The 
index consists of an alphabetized list of the sub- 
chapter headings. That is all it is. 

Even at that, it's better than the index to the 
manual that accompanies LISA itself. In this 
case they simply didn't bother. There's no in- 
dex at all. On all other counts, as a learning de- 
vice the LISA manual is quite hopeless. None- 
theless, I managed to get LISA up and run- 
ning, and entered and assembled a sample pro- 
gram from Roger Wagner's text. Fine. Then I 
wanted to save it on another disk and try run- 
ning it from within a Basic program. It was 
eight o'clock on a Sunday evening. 

By four o'clock on Monday morning I 
threw in the towel. I had pored over Wag- 
ner's text, Hyde's text, the LISA manual, and 
the DOS manual. I had tried every stunt! could 
think of Nothing worked. All I got were er- 
ror messages that the LISA manual did not doc- 
ument, or Apple error messages that made no 
sense. The situation was beyond belief No- 
where in all this literature was there a simple 
discussion of how to save and run an assem- 
bled program! 

I finally got my answer by contacting Sierra 
On-Line, publishers of LISA, later on Mon- 
day. The answer was not easy. The answer was 
not obvious. And the answer was not, in fact, in 
their manual. Nor was it in Hyde's text. Nor 
was it in Wagner's text. 

None of my friends or acquaintances are 
computer buffs. I am forced to rely entirely on 
the printed word, personal experimentation, 
and — as a last resort, lest I make a nuisance of 
myself — telephone calls to the software compa- 
nies themselves. Given this state of affairs, I 
wonder how any amateur ever manages to get 
past first base with assembly language.

Viva Pascal! 

This is in response to Chuck Walker, whose let- 
ter describing Pascal as an abortion appeared 
in Open Discussion (November 1982). 

You admit to being only slightly acquaint- 
ed with Pascal, then proceed to condemn it. 
Your acquaintance is surely slight; the ability to 
list directories to the printer is described in just 
over two pages of text on the List Directory 
command. The text includes the specific exam- 
ple of listing to the printer. Based on that kind 
of knowledge, you then condemn the language 
for being designed by professional program- 
mers, which makes you "puke." 

Be informed that Pascal was designed by 
one man. Professor Edsger Dijkstra, who is an 
educator and a well-respected thinker in the 
computing profession. It was designed to be a 



language suitable for educating students in the 
science of programming and for application of 
the developing scientific principles that the com- 
puter profession so sorely needs. Pascal has 
been accepted as a development language by 
many professional computing organizations be- 
cause we find that it helps us write efficient, 
modular, maintainable, correct programs. It is 
generally accepted that Basic facilitates attain- 
ing none of those goals. 

There are many languages used with com- 
puters. Some of those available for your Apple 
are Pascal, Fortran, Forth, Logo, and Lisp. 
Each of these languages has a reason for exist- 
ing and a set of tasks for which it is especially 
well-suited. If you will take the trouble to 
learn — really learn — a few other languages, you 
will find that the use of another language can 
help shape your understanding of a problem 
and can aid in the solution of it. 

As an educator you have a responsibility to 
teach our children not just facts, but how to 
learn and how to make decisions based on 
knowledge. Let me urge you to gain knowledge 
of Pascal (or of any other subject) before at- 
tempting to evaluate it. Let me suggest in evalu- 
ating a tool you consider its purpose and the 
ability of the tool to meet that purpose. Let me 
urge you to study first, then evaluate. Learn 
first, then teach. If you will do that, your stu- 
dents may one day be equipped to design a 
computer language that does not make you 
"puke."

Ann Arbor, MI 

More Than One Way To Skin an Apple 

This is in response to the letter "Sour Grapes, or 
Rather, Potatoes" from Mrs. George Heckler 
that appeared in Open Discussion (November 
1982). 

Words of comfort do not have any real ef- 
fect when a home computer owner becomes 
frustrated as he or she is learning about their 
new computer. Feelings such as surprise, con- 
fusion, or, worse yet, helplessness can occur 
even when a user learns about the logistics of a 
new system or a new software purchase. I can 
understand how Mrs. Heckler feels — I felt the 
same way when we purchased our Apple II 
months ago. Here are some hints on how to get 
more out of your system based on our 
experiences: 

First, try patience. Learning about your 
Apple will take time. Plan on that happening. 
You can reduce that learning curve somewhat 
by inviting a friend over who has some experi- 
ence with what you're trying to do. I com- 
plained once about how tricky it is to use a 
word processor program after spending only a 
few evenings with it. Then I remembered tak- 
ing fourteen weeks in high school just to learn 
how to use a simple typewriter! Experience also 
has no age barrier. The first person to guide me 
through our Apple was thirteen years younger 
than myself. So please take your time. 

The editing scheme in the Apple leaves some- 
thing to be desired. The fact that the cursor

□ Jim Nitchals, cofounder of Cavalier Com- 
puter and coauthor of Bug Attack, Microwave, 
and others, has left the firm to freelance. Cur- 
rently, he has a contract with Electronic Arts 
(Menlo Park, CA) as an independent game au- 
thor. He will produce one game for EA imme- 
diately, and the company will have first refusal 
rights on future games. 

□ Orange Micro has moved to new corpo- 
rate headquarters in Anaheim, California. The 
new facility will have more than fourteen thou- 
sand square feet of space. "The incredible suc- 
cess of the Grappler Plus interface card and the 
Bufferboard has certainly played a major role in 
Orange Micro's surging development," says 
company founder and president Art Scotten. 
"This success, coupled with the success of our 
retail computer stores, has led to expansion of 
market reach as well as facilities." Orange Mi- 
cro's new address is 14(X) North Lakeview, 
Anaheim, California 92807; phone (714) 779- 
2772. 




Paul Chaison, head of lUS research and 
development. 

□ Information Unlimited Software (Sausali- 
to, CA) has appointed Paul D. Chaison vice 
president of research and development. He 
spent more than twenty years with IBM and 
was in charge of overseeing vendor-supplied ap- 
plications for the IBM pc. Chaison oversees 
technical writing and programming as well as 
manufacturing functions. 

The company, publisher of Easy Writer and 
related programs, has assigned its advertising 
account to D'Arcy-McManus and Masius of 
San Francisco, who will develop national con- 
sumer and trade advertising for lUS as well as 
collateral material and other communications 
projects. 

□ A U.S. District Court of San Francisco 
has ruled in favor of plaintiff Sinus Software 
(Sacramento, CA), prohibiting Sirius Systems 



Technology (Scotts Valley, CA) from using the 
name Sirius. It was ruled that the Sacramento 
software company had superior rights to the 
name and was demonstrably in direct competi- 
tion with other personal computer manufactur- 
ers, having introduced its new color digitizing 
microcomputer at last November's COMDEX. 

□ Advertising piracy is on the rise! An 
employee of Software Distributors (Culver 
City, CA) attending the Hanover Industrial 
Fair in Germany discovered an advertisement 
for Northamber Limited, an English distribu- 
tor of computer hardware, virtually identical to 
Software Distributors's "1 -Upmanship" ads. 
Half a dozen words in the ad copy had been 
changed to refer to hardware and peripherals 
instead of software. Software Distributors has 
not yet contacted the English firm regarding the 
matter. 

Software Distributors has expanded its of- 
fices to a five thousand square foot facility at 
10023 West Jefferson Boulevard in Culver City. 
The building will house administrative, sales, 
and service departments. The company's origi- 
nal quarters at 9929 West Jefferson Boulevard 
will be used for warehousing and marketing 
support. "These new quarters will allow Soft- 
ware Distributors to continue with its present 
rate of expansion," says Linda Johnson, vice 
president of administration. "In addition it will 
provide retailers with a greater software selec- 
tion and faster delivery time." 

□ "The Personal Computer Show," produced 
by Solutions Incorporated (San Antonio, TX), 
is up and running on the cable Satellite Pro- 
gram Network. The show, sponsored by Apple 
Computer and Sierra On-Line, is a "video 
magazine" utilizing demonstrations and inter- 
views to illustrate different applications and 
benefits of personal computers. News, busi- 
ness, education, games, and weekly feature seg- 
ments spotlight new products and develop- 
ments in the industry. 

□ Softline magazine, born in a log cabin in 
Coarsegold, California, as the On-Line News- 
letter, has been purchased from Sierra On-Line 
by Softalk Publishing (North Hollywood, CA) 
for a six-figure sum. Softalk had taken over 
publication of the newsletter in September 1981 
and turned it into a nonpartisan computer 
games magazine, with On-Line staying on as fi- 
nancial partner. As the software house has now 
gone on to other ventures, Softalk has taken 
over all aspects of the magazine's publication. 
With full autonomy, Softline will expand in size, 
featuring contests, special games, and a class- 
room participation column, and will "generally 
be more fun than most reasonably sane people 
can stand," say informed sources.

□ The Burrouglis Business Forms Division 
(Phoenix, AZ) is working with business appli- 
cations software companies to provide a forms 
support program. Burroughs will supply the 
necessary business forms, reports, and state- 
ments required in the ongoing use of a business 
software application program. Spectra/ Soft 
(Chandler, AZ), makers of COMMA, a m,edi- 
cal management software system, has been the 
first company to take advantage of the pro- 
gram, in which Burroughs provides related sup- 
plies and equipment for computer installations 
and national marketing representation. Ap- 
proximately eight hundred Apple dealers have 
been contacted by Spectra/Soft about the 
COMMA software and forms support pro- 
gram. Company treasurer/controller Brian 
Sheppard has termed dealer response "ex- 
tremely favorable." 

□ Computerland (Hayward, CA) has an- 
nounced an "early bird" software program for 
its nearly three hundred stores worldwide, giv- 
ing participating stores product return privi- 
leges and the opportunity to experiment with 
software at no risk and providing product se- 
lection and evaluation by Computerland's new- 
ly formed Software Products Committee. "We 
want to provide a forum at corporate through 
which to channel the expertise of the network 
and the vendors," says software department 
manager Ed Murphy, "providing follow-up 
support to the stores, so they can educate the 
customers about what the software does, an- 
swer their questions, and help solve their 
problems." 

Computerland has signed an agreement 
with Simple Soft (Elk Grove, IL) to distribute 
the Quickcalc Real Estate Investor. 

□ W. G. Zirneltlis, president of MCE 
(Kalamazoo, MI), formerly Interpretive Edu- 
cation, has announced the sale of the com- 
pany's entire line of multimedia products. MCE

of high technology products. "This move rep- 
resents a major repositioning of our company to 
meet better the current and accelerating future 
needs for microcomputer-based programs for 
schools, adult-training, and home education," 
says Zirneklis. MCE is also expanding its re- 
search and development efforts following two 
years of development and testing for educa- 
tional microcomputer programs. 

□ Evotek (Fremont, CA), manufacturer of 
5 '/4 -inch hard disk drives, has named Russ 
Bishop, Peter A. Tegan, and Darwyn F. Kelley 
as regional sales directors. Bishop, former man- 
ager of product marketing for Honeywell, will 
handle Evotek's sales in the eastern United 
States. Tegan, formerly western region man- 



ager for ECS Microsystems, will fill the same 
role at Evotek. Kelley, southern regional sales 
manager, was previously branch manager and 
regional manager for Honeywell. 
□ Don Mandell has been appointed vice presi- 
dent of sales and marketing for Axlon (Sunny- 
vale, CA). He will be responsible for all Axlon 
domestic and overseas marketing efforts. Pre-

they have won a tournament and also become 
master robots. For information on future 
tournaments, write to Frank Krogh, Box 5337, 
North Hollywood, CA 91616. 

□ The Erin Computer Learning Center (New 
York, NY), a part of Erin Computer Distribut- 
ing Corporation, provides training to busi- 
nesses and individuals on a variety of micro- 
computer systems and software, focusing on 
word processing, accounting, and financial ap- 
plications. The center offers one-day intensive 
courses for executives and managers, half-day 
training courses for office staff in aspects of 
computer-based office work, a posttraining an- 
nual support contract for individual students, 
and ongoing training arrangements for businesses. 

□ Corvus Systems (San Jose, CA) has again 
expanded its facilities, bringing the firm's total 
facility to one hundred thousand square feet. 
Part of the expansion will be dedicated to addi- 
tional shipping capabilities for Corvus net- 
works and Winchester disk drives. The rest will 
be used by the expanded marketing depart- 
ment. The firm has also completed the offering 
of 2,750,000 shares of common stock at $13 per 
share. 

□ Wells Fargo Bank has extended an unse- 
cured line of credit in the amount of $500,000 to 



Corona Data Systems (Westlake Village, CA). 
The funds will be used as working capital and 
inventories in current production of hard disk 
peripherals. The company has appointed Loren 
Eltiste, former financial vice president, treasur- 
er, and secretary for PERCI, Incorporated, a 
Los Angeles based computer peripheral manu- 
facturer, as finance vice president and chief fi- 
nancial officer. 

□ Software Dimensions, producers of micro- 
computer accounting packages, has moved to 
new thirty-five thousand square foot corporate 
headquarters in the Lake Forest Technical Cen- 
ter in Folsom, California. Ronnie Green, presi- 
dent of the two-year-old firm, cites accelerated 
research and development and personnel addi- 
tions as reasons for the expansion. "Software 
Dimensions's growth has surpassed all our ex- 
pectations, and there is every indication that we 
will continue this growth rate in the future," 
says Green. "We expect to hire one hundred 
fifty people in our first three or four years in the 
Folsom area." The company's hiring needs are 
in research and development, production, and 
marketing, with priority given to the local la- 
bor pool. 

□ Mark G. Kallin, former president of Preci- 
sion Products of Aptos, California, has been

mC^^^^iiirse and Flying High 



BY DAVID HUHTEI^ 



How fast is too fast? 
How big is too big? 

Ask the ghosts of Elvis, Marilyn, and James Dean. Ask the ghosts of Sutter, Keats, and Alexander the 
Great. While you're at it, ask T. E. Lawrence, Amelia Earhart, and Dostoyevsky. 

Elvis became a king and a slave to his subjects before he knew what hit him. In three years Keats wrote 
more good poetry than most poets write in a lifetime and then he died. Alexander the Great conquered most 
of the known world before reaching the legal drinking age in present-day California. 

The Harder They Fall. Speed is exhilarating. Uncontrolled growth is intoxicating. As long as youth can 
dream, life will never move fast enough. 

Whether it's motorcycles, cars, planes, skiing, volleyball, or assembly language, Bruce Artwick likes 
speed. He likes Winchester disk drives, BMWs, zooming through undergraduate and graduate school in 
four years, and tearing down the Angeles Crest Highway on a Suzuki at a dangerous clip. The president of 
SubLogic Communications Corporation, Artwick is a tall, quiet, twenty-nine-year-old bachelor. He pos- 
sesses a remarkable mind, which has created several of the finest programs to grace the Apple's RAM. 

Contrast Artwick with Stu Moment. Outgoing, of medium height, and possessing an exceptional love of 
flying. Moment is SubLogic's chairman of the board. A businessman. Moment has steered the company to 

Opposite page: SubLogic's chairman of the board, Stu Moment, calls himself a "crazy aviation fanatic." This 
page: top, SubLogic's president and chief software engineer Bruce Artwick at ease in his office—christened Lazer 
Bay One from the movie Tron; bottom, Moment and Artwick pose with the faithful company plane, a Cessna 150.

JANUARY 1983 




Both Artwick and Moment are licensed pilots and fly all over the country

portant information on the radio and scans the sky for other planes while 
approaching the University of Illinois Willard Airport. 



its present course, complementing Artwick's superior software engineer- 
ing talents with organizational and financial skills. He's even picked up 
some modest programming skills, designing a system for logging flight 
hours at a fair-sized flying institute. 

Redford and Newman. Lewis and Clark. Laurel and Hardy. Jobs 
and Wozniak. Artwick and Moment. The grand adventurers riding the 
hard trail, living and playing at lives larger than life. It's an old story. 

Leaving hyperbole for the poets, the truth is that Artwick and Mo- 
ment are two thoroughly likable individuals who confess to hiding out in 
central Illinois, seemingly far away from the spotlights and hubbub. Un- 
fortunately, spotlights and hubbub are notorious for seeking out the fa- 
mous, no matter how hard they try to hide. Not intentionally being mys- 
terious, the company SubLogic is nevertheless something of an enigma. 
Who are they? Where did they come from? Where are they going? 

One thing is known. Artwick's Flight Simulator for the Apple was a 
monster success in the first two years of its release. It placed second on 
Softalk's first Top Thirty poll in October 1980. It was last seen on the 
Top Thirty in May 1982's poll at number twenty-seven. Flight Simulator 
has been pulling strong on the Strategy Five for sixteen straight months, 
usually second or third. Including the TRS-80 version, Artwick's Flight 
Simulator has sold more copies than any other flight simulator of any 
kind in the world. 

"And It Has Always Been Attributable to Human Error." Cham- 
paign is a farm community and a college town — home of the Fighting II- 
lini and of the third busiest airport in the state and birthplace of the 
most famous fictional computer, HAL, in Arthur C. Clarke's 2001: A 
Space Odyssey and 2010: Odyssey Two. It all started here. 

Artwick and Moment first met in the early seventies when they were 
attending the University of Illinois. They roomed together with a dozen 
other spirited students in a big old house dubbed Gamma Ray Zappa. 
The house was evenly split up among AV (aviation) jocks, parachuters, 
and electrical engineers. 

Moment was one of the AV jocks. Rakish looking in his black fly- 
er's jacket. Moment flashes a winning smile and recalls the true roots of

his love of flying: "My mother was six months pregnant with me and she 
flew in a Piper Cub through turbulence. I was bom a month early, feet 
first like a paratrooper. I first flew in a small plane at fifteen. I was really 
into engines and decided I wanted to be an airplane mechanic." 

Moment enrolled at the university's Institute of Aviation and began 
his flying career. He recalls fondly his student days, a past that both Art- 
wick and Moment are very much in touch with. 

"I was like any good college student at the time. I protested and had 
a guitar," says Moment. "I finally gave that away to our vice president of 
marketing. Norm Olson, a year ago." 

Gamma Ray Zappa was not a real fraternity, though fraternities 
were a big thing around campus. Still, the ad hoc brotherhood included a 
pretty crazy bunch of guys. 

Bruce Artwick was one of the electrical engineers. "We agreed that 
Stu would teach me to fly if I taught him about digital electronics," he 
remembers. 

When Artwick wasn't entrenched at the university's digital comput- 
er labs, he was doing the things only college students and devil-may-care 
parachuters can think up. He enjoyed the vibrant atmosphere and the 
chance to learn about flying. 

Rebel without a Cause. An electrical tinkerer for years, Artwick sur- 
prised no one when he started to build his own computer. On his home- 
made BACS 1000 (Bruce Artwick Computer System), Artwick did some 
"3-D stuff and even a real-time runway. I just had to have my own real- 
time 3-D graphics." 

Through most of his college career, Artwick was hardware oriented, 
particularly interested in computer design. Then his thesis project called 
for creating a real-time flight simulator on the PDP- 1 1 . Graphics soon 
became a major concern and hobby of Artwick's that would figure sig-' 
nificantly in the genesis of SubLogic. 

Artwick completed his bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical 
engineering in four years. When he started college, Illinois-born Artwick 
says it was a fifty-fifty chance that he would study either music or engi- 
neering. Once he made the choice, thanks to the excellent curriculum at 
the university, Artwick pursued his passion for computers ferociously. 
When he had finished, he had no trouble landing a job at Hughes Air- 
craft in Culver City, California. 

While he was at Hughes, several interesting things happened to Art- 
wick. Twice, midair collisions between small planes occurred close to his 
house; one time debris landed in the swimming pool. He learned to love 
the Southern California mountains and their winding roads that beat the 
cornfields of central Illinois for riding motorcycles. Artwick also began 
dreaming of founding a big company with hundreds of employees. 

Back in Champaign, flight instructor and business major Moment 
shared some of Artwick's dreams. In early 1977, they decided to form a 
company. Back at the university's digital computer labs, Artwick worked 
on devices known as sublogic circuits, and that's where the company 
name comes from. 

"We've had people think we make logic units for submarines. One or 
two people have called thinking we were a mental institution," Moment 
recalls. 

South by Southwest. In early 1977, Artwick wrote an article on 3-D 
graphics for Kilobaud Microcomputing and SubLogic sold its first prod- 
uct, a 3-D graphics package for Southwest Technical Products's 6800 
processor. In those early days, neither Artwick nor Moment had any real 
expertise in marketing, though their job wasn't that tough. There were 
only about two hundred computers with that processor. 

Other early products from SubLogic were graphics drivers for S-100 
boards, drivers for Vector graphics, and television dazzlers. Artwick's 
megacompany dream started slow, but the two fighting lUini gained con- 
siderable knowledge about the market with those early forays into hard- 
ware and software. 

Artwick was still working at Hughes and Moment was still plowing 
through college when the two decided to publish programs for machines 
with a wider circulation. In 1978, that meant TRS-80s and Apples. But 
first Artwick had to return to Illinois. 

Besides pursuing the dream of heading his own big company, Art- 
wick chose to leave Hughes because the rewards for good work were too

few. "Only generals would see the results," he explains. "I also wanted to 
leave Los Angeles because of the high cost of operating SubLogic from 
two locations." 

Anatomy of a Dream. One of Artwick's heroes is Seymour Cray, 
who left Control Data in the mid-seventies to start his own company. 
Cray discovered a niche in the computer industry and formed Cray Re- 
search to fill that hole. Supercomputers are Cray's forte, and Artwick 
looked for a similar niche in the microcomputer market. He found it in 
graphics and simulations. 

In June 1979, Artwick packed up a U-Haul and moved back to 
Champaign. Four months later, SubLogic published its first Apple pro- 
gram, A2-3D1 Graphics. Three months after that SubLogic launched A2- 
FSl Flight Simulator iox the Apple. A TRS-80 version of the flight simu- 
lator, T80-FS1, was released simultaneously. Unlike the typical first- 
time-in-business Apple software publishers — Sirius, HowardSoft, Syn- 
ergistic, Sierra On-Line, and many others — SubLogic diversified into the 
Apple market instead of out of it. 

Artwick took advantage of the Apple's larger memory to add lots of 
little improvements impossible in the TRS-80 version of the flight simu- 
lator. The animation is 25 percent faster and the instruments are closer to 
those of a real small airplane. On cassette at first, as were many Apple 
programs in those days, A2-FS1 soon became available on disk and sales 
took off. 

In June 1980 SubLogic got its own Cessna 150. The recession had al- 
ready hit private aviation, but the eighteen-year-old aircraft had been 
equipped in the factory with long-range gas tanks at the request of its 
original owner. This made cross-country flying economically feasible. 
Moment and six-foot two-inch Artwick crammed into the tiny two-seat- 
er and flew all across the country. They would take test flights to see if 
Artwick's mathematical simulations were accurate. It was very gratify- 
ing to fly in the company plane and see Artwick's software engineer- 
ing coincide with the real thing. 

Real Men Don't Eat Applesoft. Artwick prefers assembly language 
because of its high performance characteristics and the results, which run 
very fast. Higher level languages like C and Pascal are 75 percent as fast 
as assembly language, and that extra 25 percent, Artwick and Moment 
believe, is what makes SubLogic competitive. You need good tools to 
work in assembly language, because it's not a nice structured format. 
Still, that difference of three or four frames per second in the animation is 
what the competition has to contend with. 

In 1980, SubLogic hired its first full-time employee, to answer the 
phone. Rhonda Fultz filled the role until she got married and quit. Julie 
Newman took her place and is still with the company, though she now 
performs in a different capacity. Newman is distribution manager and 
the major force behind SubLogic's superb dealer network. 

Soon after Newman took over Fultz's position, SubLogic hired 
Teresa Evans to handle the shipping. A key person for the last year and a 
half has been vice president of marketing Norm Olson. An old college 
chum of Moment's, Olson had a motley college career that included psy- 
chology, premed, and rhetoric. When Moment and Artwick were look- 
ing for a marketing person, they chose Olson for his "fantastic" 
background. 

Artwick and Moment tried to create an image for SubLogic. Par- 
ticularly in the Apple market, they didn't want to be seen as just another 
software publisher. Caution is perhaps the key thing here. Artwick and 
Moment believe in putting out a few quality products and providing 
strong service for those products. 

"Money is slightly secondary to us," explains Moment. "We've made 
plenty for where we live. In central Illinois there are no Joneses to keep 
up with." 

It's cheap to run a business in Champaign and it's cheap to live there. 
How cheap? 

"This spring I'm buying five acres at $4,000 a piece," says Moment. 
"I'm building a big house for my family and the entire thing will cost 
around $80,000." 

The Luck of the Irish. Nestled in the center of Champaign is a local 
institution that has played no small part in the SubLogic story. Artwick 
describes Murphy's Pub as the kind of place where "all the engineering 
majors go to drink green beer on Saint Patrick's Day." Warm, dark, in-

Above, view of the University of Illinois Willard Airport— thiird busiest in 
Illinois— from about two thousand feet. Artwick and Moment dream of 
moving SubLogic's offices out to the airport— they really like the flying 
environment. 

timate, and supplied with a well-stacked jukebox, Murphy's Pub is the 
site of "some of the biggest decision making" for the SubLogic 
executives. 

For almost two years, SubLogic's only Apple products were the A2- 
FSl Flight Simulator, A 2-3 D I Graphics Package, A2-3D2 Enhancement, 
and A2-GE1 Graphics Editor. Early in 1981, Artwick and Moment de- 
cided to start experimenting with a slightly more diverse product line. In 
May 1981, calling themselves the "engineering and graphics experts," 
SubLogic released Saturn Navigator, by Wesley Huntress, author of Edu- 
Ware's current hit Rendezvous. 

A hi-res adventure/simulation, Saturn Navigator is a thinking-per- 
son's arcade game, a good example of the SubLogic image. You don't 
have to contend with invading aliens and you're not searching for a long 
lost monolith or the secret chamber of Urbana. You have to navigate 



through the rings of Saturn and negotiate an orbit around the massive 
gas giant. It's not easy, but it's an educational and rewarding simulation. 

Another good example of SubLogic's elusive image is their advertis- 
ing. Like many a young company that sprouted up at the start of the mi- 
crocomputer boom, SubLogic was at a complete loss and searched for an 
agency to handle this all-important task. 

"We looked for one in the Yellow Pages," remembers Moment. 
"The first guy we went to see was choking on a tie but didn't impress us. 
Then we found Bob Chapdu of ADLIB who ran a creative and artistic 
place, but he wasn't trying to be Madison Avenue." He was also sympa- 
thetic to SubLogic's conservative image. 

Most growing companies eventually have to move up to color, and 
late 1982 saw Chapdu and ADLIB launch SubLogic's first big advertis- 
ing campaign — for ArtvWck and Moment a momentous, almost scary, 
step. They wanted to be colorful but different. The result is a group 
of distinguished looking full-page ads that aren't misleading. Unem- 
bellished screens from the programs are featured prominently, giving po- 
tential buyers an idea of what they'll be getting. 

It's not a new approach, particularly for business programs, but in 
the world of entertainment software it's a welcome change from the 
usual airbrushed extravaganza. SubLogic, with the help of Chapdu, has 
taken the idea and used it in packaging as well. Hanging on the rack in 
the computer store, a SubLogic product always has a sample screen to 
persuade the buyer and make the salesperson's job a little easier. 

"Pinball Wizard, There Has To Be a Trick." When Raster Blaster 
was released, Budge's masterpiece seemed to be the last word on the sub- 
ject. Few people would have predicted that two other pinball programs 
would achieve even a modicum of success a year later. Raster Blaster un- 
seated VisiCalc; it sold systems; it was a phenomenon. 

Never underestimate Bruce Artwick's talent. A2-PB1: Night Mission 
Pinball was released in late spring 1 982 and climbed to number five on 
the Top Thirty in July of that year. The reviews were staggering. How 
had Artwick done it? The animation was so smooth, the configuration of 
features so realistic and competitive. The Cosmic Mode was the rave of 
the day. 



What Was 
That? 



The blank space to the left of this column of type ran 
on page 290 of the December issue. 

So/talk's art director disclaims that space as a 
representation of all he's been able to accomplish with the 
Apple's hi-res page. 

Sofialk's publisher disclaims that space as his 
collected wit and wisdom. 

Those readers of keen insight and a puzzle-solving 
bent probably referred to the Ad Index, where they 
ascertained that the space belonged to the Keyboard 
Company. 

Let it hereby be made known that the Keyboard 
Company had much more to say than the space on the 
left indicates. In the production process, we muted the 
Keyboard's voice. 

Astute readers may recognize the Keyboard 
Company name as belonging to Apple. The old 
Keyboard Company was folded into Apple and 
dissolved. The new Keyboard Company picked up the 
remnants of that process but feared the name might cause 
confusion. 

So now they're the Accessory Products Company, 
and what they had to say as the Keyboard Company is 
the essence of the Accessory Products ad to the right of 
this column. 

With a new name and a restored advertising voice, 
Accessory Products is off and running. Which may be 
more than can be said for the collected wit and wisdom of 
the publisher.

If Broderbund's also highly praised David's Midnight Magic hadn't 
come out several months earlier, Night Mission Pinball probably would 
have unseated VisiCalc. Well, maybe. 

In the last year, a number of different kinds of programs have 
emerged from SubLogic. Artwick and Moment decided to experiment 
with the educational market, releasing Whole Brain Speller from the 
team of Susan Campanini, David F. Manton, and Joe Weintraub and 
Music Maker by Jim Baldridge. It's still too early to tell, but SubLogic is 
not dissatisfied with the results and may offer more educational 
products. 

Another new area was opened up with the hi-res arcade/adventure 
Space Vikings by Mitch Robbins. "We wanted something that would 
take people all winter to play," recalls Moment. Multifaceted and chal- 
lenging in all the right ways. Space Vikings is another perfect SubLx)gic 
product. It doesn't have to sell thousands and thousands of copies. It has 
to stimulate the imagination and exercise the intellect. 

The latest experiment is in the familiar area of strategy games, or 
simulations. SubLogic's New Wave Strategy line is just now reaching the 
market. All three games, Zendar, Roadblock, and Front Line, are au- 
thored by Terry Eagan and fit into the SubLogic mold. Moment is a big 
fan of strategy games and even did some of the finishing touches on the 
programming of Front Line. He's hoping the games will be well re- 
ceived, though that is no condition on the success of the experiment. 

"Junior! Come Down Here!" SubLogic's next move will most likely 
be into hardware for the Apple. Artwick and Moment are developing 
what they call a "universal simulator." Not just another joystick, this 
multiplexed, seven-channel contraption will give a more realistic aspect 
to the flight simulator, possibly including foot pedals, a steering wheel, a 
separate throttle, and other features. 

It sounds like Artwick and Moment should just build an FAA-ap- 
proved flight simulator and get it out of their systems. They're smarter 
than that. Enough companies are out there making the real thing that 
SubLogic isn't interested. Nonetheless, their idea for the new controller

would come darn close to having all the features of a real simulator. 

Naturally the universal simulator will adapt to other kinds of pro- 
grams. Artwick believes it could add a whole new aspect to computer 
gaming. One exciting feature would be motion feedback, a soft- 
ware/hardware coordination allowing more precise control and faster, 
more accurate response. 

All this experimentation is meant to define a nidie for SubLogic in the 
world of microcomputers. Artwick turns again to Seymour Cray and his 
success story in the extremely narrow market of supercomputers. Sub- 
Logic would like to be king of simulation and concentrate on putting out 
the best products of this kind. One at a time, if need be. 

Even though he wanted a big company at first (SubLogic has had 
close to 400 percent growth each year of its existence), Artwdck is now 
content to stay relatively small for a while. He's learned something else 
from Cray, whose company grew so fast it almost caused Cray to leave. 
Artwick feels that when a company gets too big it gets impersonal. To 
maintain control over a large company, its leaders often become egotis- 
tical dictators, Artwick believes, and he doesn't want any part of that. 

Artwick and Moment like to keep their fingers in all the workings of 
SubLogic, dealing with customers, making the everyday decisions, and 
sharing the long-term decisions with the likes of Norm Olson and Julie 
Newman. Artwick and Moment personally talk to new and old custom- 
ers every day, coming to know many pretty well. Newman and Olson al- 
so have a terrific rapport with the loyal SubLogic customers and dealers. 

"There are a lot of people out there who've bought all our pro- 
grams," says Moment. "They're fiercely loyal and we'd never let them 
down." That's why SubLogic still carries products for the S-100 com- 
puters, even though they represent a rapidly dying market. That's why all 
SubLogic's Apple products come with a lifetime five-dollar replacement 
policy when the bad disk is returned. 

All Along the Control Tower. Moment says that few flight instruc- 
tors like to fly all day. He, on the other hand, couldn't get enough of it. 
"At the end of a long day, I'd be tired, yeah, but I felt great. I got along 
with the super hippie types and the military jocks." 

Moment got his own instruction at the institute from a retired Ma- 
rine commander. An active flight instructor from 1973 to 1980, Moment 
is proud to say he's on the Aviation Institute's Incomplete List of Excel- 
lent Instructors. 

At the same time, he calls himself a crazy aviation fanatic and a su- 
per aviation head. "I fly all week and on Saturdays. On Sundays I'm out 
there in the fields with my daughter flying a radio-controlled model air- 
plane." He routinely flies across the country, has logged in 2,500 total 
flight hours, and performs maintenance on the plane regularly. 

"Even though I do it full-time, it doesn't matter how many hours you 
rack up," he explains. "Each time it's a new experience. Most flights have 
something new." 

Artwick is not as fanatical about flying as Moment, but he's a good 
pilot nonetheless. Artwick's true love is motorcycles. He currently owns 
three and in his lifetime has had a total of fifteen. Why so many? "It was 
unintentional. I sell them. I don't crash them." 

Artwick is currently working on a book about interactive computer 
graphics as well as on an ambitious computer-aided design project with 
associates in Amsterdam. The CAD project is very close to his heart and 
Artwick considers it his most important and complex creation to date. 
It's not for the Apple market, unlucky us. 

Airport 1982: Hijacking Software. The University of Illinois Wil- 
lard Airport lies just off Highway 45, and, if Artwick and Moment get 
their way, it will be the future home of SubLogic. They like the flying en- 
vironment and would love to be close to the Institute of Aviation and the 
company plane. There may even be good business reasons for such a 
move. The only major problem comes with building their own offices — 
the university owns all the land and would own the offices. 

Comfortably spread out in three locations at present, SubLogic is 
constantly looking to the future — uh, cautiously. You know, conserva- 
tivelike. Artwick and Moment recently took a flight in a helicopter and 
it's not hard to guess why. Yes, Virginia, there may be a future simulator 
there. 

Oh, and about Artwick's love of motorcycles. . . . But there's no rea- 
son to go too far, too fast. All good things happen in their time.

SOFTAI 1^ 



JANUARY 1983 



Corner 




You may not have heard this one, but you've probably got a similar 
Apple horror story to tell. There was this small business owner who 
bought himself an Apple and a simple accounting package to use in his 
one-man shop. Ignoring the pleas of his family, he stayed up for many a 
night entering three years' worth of past records, making those records 
balance, and then printing out reports that looked just like those he'd 
been paying an accountant to do. 

Finally, the man felt confident enough to put his current records "on 
the computer," as he now knew how the jargon went. All went well for 
about a year. Then, on a dark, stormy January night at 2:17 a.m. while he 
was in the process of entering his post-Christmas sales and inventory 
data, it happened. 

He had just finished entering the sale of an alligator shirt, matching 
belt, and three pairs of socks to credit card number 18723-865-09543- 
0081-2 (exp. 5 /84) when, without warning, his Apple went into a coma. 

He could see that it was still alive. Its power light was on and warm 
to the touch. Its monitor glowed green and displayed the last entry. But 
the machine was totally insensate. It simply wouldn't pay any attention 
to anything he typ)ed at the keyboard. Finally, in frustration, he powered 
down for the night and went to bed. 

The next day, of course, our friend successfully entered the data and 
balanced his books. A couple of weeks later, the Apple again went into 
shock. And then, a few days later, it happened again. Figuring that the 
machine might be overheating, the man bought a fan. This helped for a 
while, it seemed, and then it didn't. 

Well, to make a long story short, the man finally gave up on his ex- 
periment in computerized accounting and returned to his old manual 
system (which, if the truth be known, allowed him to finish his books 
each night in time for the late news and then to get a good night's sleep). 
The Apple became a great game machine for his kids and seemed ideal 
for that purpose; when used for games, it never showed the slightest sign 
of brain damage or toxic shock. 

All would have been well for the kids if their father hadn't walked 
into a computer store at the wrong time one day, shortly after having re- 
initialized and reused all those disks that he'd spent so many hours sav- 
ing his accounting records on. As he stood at the counter waiting to buy 
a new home-arcade game for the kids, he overheard the clerk telling a 
customer about something he called "garbage collection." 

Our businessman listened in ever-growing horror. Then he ran out of 
the store, jumped in his car, laid rubber as he peeled out, and. . . . 

There's no need to go through the gory details. Suffice it to say that 
the man's kids are again enjoying mumblety-peg, hopscotch, and kick- 
the-can. They're out of doors, full of vitamin D, and ever so much tan- 
ner. The computer store clerk who originally sold our businessman his 
system and taught him how to use it but Jorgot to mention garbage col- 
lection is recovering nicely. 

So there's something called "garbage collection" that you didn't 
know about, right? Well, you'd better learn. If not, someday you may find 
that after you've been entering data for half an hour or so your Apple, 
without warning, will appear to hang up and won't respond to anything 
except a reboot. Actually, if you wait a long while — perhaps as much as 



several minutes — your Apple may reawaken and pick up where it left off. 
But if you don't know what's happening you'll probably blame the 
problem on a program bug, swear a bit, hit reset, and start over, long be- 
fore the necessary time has elapsed. 

Unless there actually is a program bug (pr#8 will do nicely), what's 
happening when the Apple appears to hang after a lot of string data en- 
try is that it's erasing the data that's no longer being used to make room 
for new data. String variables are stored differently than numeric vari- 
ables. In numeric variables, the values of the same two eight-bit bytes can 
be changed repeatedly to represent any integer number from —32767 to 
-1-32767. Applesoft's numbers are more complicated, but the principle re- 
mains the same. A string variable, on the other hand, can be anything 
from a single character to 255 characters in length. 

I f the Apple had to set aside 255 bytes for each string no matter how 
short the string in question might be, an awful lot of memory would be 
wasted. Instead, each input string is stored in order of entry. You can't 
cram in a long string where a short one used to be, and you can't be sure 
that any new strings will be the same length as the discarded ones; so Ap- 
plesoft simply puts the new strings right after the old ones without both- 
ering to erase the old ones. If, for example, you had an address list in 
which at first X$ = "101 5th Street" and later X$ = "25032 Washington 
Boulevard," both addresses would be retained, but a pointer would skip 
over the first after the second one "replaced" it. After a while, of course, 
those unused strings would start to fill up the Apple's memory. 

Garbage collection — removal of strings that are no longer used — can 
be done periodically from inside a program. If it isn't, however, Apple- 
soft will do it automatically, but only when all available memory is used 
up. At that point it checks to see which strings are still in use and re- 
moves only those that the program has discarded. The slang term gar- 
bage collection is apt. 

Go to the Source. When you run across something new and confus- 
ing, it's always a good idea to look in your Apple's memory to see what's 
going on. In the process you'll also pick up a smattering of machine lan- 
guage and have a better idea of just how the computer really works. 

To start, type call —151. As you may already know, the Basic com- 
mand call is a form of goto. They're the same in that both jump to a line 
number and then begin executing the program they find there. The dif- 
ference between the two commands is that goto goes to a Basic line, 
while a call goes to a memory location and then executes the machine 
language program that begins there. 

As you probably also know, there are 65,536 bytes or memory loca- 
tions in the chips inside your Apple. Because the old and virtually obso- 
lete Integer Basic couldn't handle numbers higher than half that (32,767), 
it became customary to refer to numbers between 32,767 and 65,536 as 
the numbers you actually wanted minus 65,536. Thus 65,385 becomes 
-151. Although Applesoft doesn't have the same limitation and can find 
a location using either the actual number or its negative complement, 
using the latter makes for less typing and has been retained as an option. 

In both cases, what you get is an asterisk prompt instead of a brack- 
et. This signifies that you've entered the Monitor, that mysterious land 
where you can read your Apple's mind byte by byte. In the Monitor, you

can even make your Apple change its mind — directly and without labor- 
ious peeks and pokes. 

From the Monitor type OG (that's zero G). This should put you back 
in Applesoft. If it doesn't, type 3D0G. 

The Monitor uses hexadecimal numbers whose digits go from zero 
through F; that leaves the letter G free to be used as a command. When 
you're in the Monitor, G means goto, and what we've done in this in- 
stance is to tell your machine to go to the beginning of its memory (loca- 
tion zero), which contains the Applesoft command to switch back to Ba- 
sic. If something's been changed there so OG doesn't work, try location 
$3D0 (976), which normally contains the corresponding DOS com- 
mand. Because this location is in a part of memory that you and your 
programs have access to, it might no longer contain this command. In 
that case you'll need to hit reset or even the off/on switch. 

In fact, if you've run a commercially produced program, 3D0G prob- 
ably won't return you to Basic because the 256 bytes from $300 to $400 
(768 to 1024) are a favorite place to tuck short machine language pro- 
grams so they'll be out of the way of those accumulating Basic strings. 

So, call —151 is the Basic command to jump into the Monitor while 
OG and 3D0G are the Monitor commands for jumping back into Basic. 

Go back into the Monitor again. Don't worry about the fact that all 
numbers here are in hex. Just follow the instructions. 

Type 9500.950F. When you're in the Monitor, typing a location 
number is the command to list its contents. (You already know what 
happens in Basic if you try to list a line by typing just its number, don't 
you?) For a range, type the beginning number and the ending number 
with a period between them. You'll see two lines, one beginning with 
9500 and the other with 9508. The first line contains the two-digit num- 
bers in memory locations $9500 through $9507 and the second the num- 
bers in locations $9508 through $950F. If you've just booted your sys- 
tem, these will probably alternate between 00 and FF, the lowest and 
highest numbers that can be represented by a single eight-bit byte (and 
the initial numbers in RAM on power-up). 

Let's write a very short machine language program. Begin with 9500:. 
The colon after the location number is the instruction to treat the num- 
bers that follow as a new program to be stored in memory beginning 
with that location. Type: 

9500:20 DD FB 60 

Check your typing by listing the line using the command 9500.9503. The 
eight characters form a complete program. In machine language $20 acts 
like gosub in Applesoft, although it is usually referred to as jump to sub- 
routine and abbreviated JSR, while $60 is similar to the command re- 
turn. The memory location $FBDD (64477) contains a short program to 
ring your Apple's bell once. 

All locations entered in hex via the Monitor require two bytes or four 
hex digits. These must be entered with the second two in correct order 
followed by the first two in correct order. Thus, location $1234 would be 
entered into machine language as 34 12 (not completely backward as in 
43 21). It's done this way so that the higher byte will contain the higher 
places of the number. The program will read the lower byte first, since 
machine language programs, like those in Applesoft, execute the instruc- 
tions in the lowest numbered locations first and then progress to the 
higher ones. In summary, then, our four-byte machine language pro- 
gram goes to location $FBDD and executes the subroutine it finds there. 

To see if it works, type 9500G. You should hear the bell, but, this 
time at least, it shouldn't be accompanied by an error message. Now re- 
turn to Basic. Type in this Httle program; in line 30, the number 38144 is 
the decimal equivalent of $9500. 

10 INPUT A$ 

20 IF A$ ="N" GOTO 99 

30 CALL 38144 

40 GOTO 10 

99 PRINT "END": END 

Each time you get the input prompt, type in a letter or a number. Do 
this ten times or so, and, when you're satisfied, enter N to end the pro- 
gram. Whenever the response is not N, this Basic program calls your ma- 
chine language subroutine located at $9500, which then calls the ma- 
chine language subroutine at $FBDD. That roudne rings the bell and re-

turns to your machine language program, which returns to your Basic 
program when it reaches the command $60. 

Let's move your machine language program. If DOS isn't in, you'll 
need to boot it now and retype your Applesoft program. Enter the Mon- 
itor and type 95F0:20 DD FB 60. Return to Basic and change line 30 in 
your Basic program to call 38384, the decimal equivalent of $95F0. This 
puts the program almost at the top of usable memory. Although the 
user-available memory goes from location 0 to 49151 (SBFFF), DOS 
takes up all the space from there down through 38400 ($9600). Your 
four-byte program then runs from 38384 to 38387 ($95F0 to $95F3), 
leaving only twelve bytes empty between the end of your work and the 
beginning of DOS. 

Now return to Basic and run your program with the new Monitor lo- 
cation in line 30. First, enter the letter A three times and then stop with N 
to make sure the program doesn't have any bugs. Run it again, slowly 
entering the letter A over and over again. What happens the thirteenth 
time you enter A? The system hangs, right? 

Let's find out what happened. Hit reset, enter the Monitor, and list 
locations $95 FO to $9600 by typing 95F0.9600. The byte at $9600, the last 
location, is the first instruction in DOS. Leave it alone; it bytes. Work- 
ing backward from $95FF, you should see 41, the ASCII code number for 
the letter A, once for every time you entered A. Remember that Applesoft 
doesn't replace old input strings with new ones; it merely starts a new 
string in the next location — working downward. 

Take a look now at your machine language program. The first three 
bytes are okay, but a usurping 41 has taken the place of your return code 
60. Strings always trail downward. When they hit your Basic program, 
which builds up from memory location 2048 ($800), Applesoft will ap- 
pear to go into a coma. It has begun automatic garbage collection. 

Unfortunately, strings creeping down over a machine language pro- 
gram simply overwhelm it and take over its locations. If the machine lan- 
guage program is one that isn't needed again, that's okay. If it is, too 
bad; it's been clobbered. In this case your twelfth A took the place of 
your return code 60, and the instruction to return to your Basic pro- 
gram after executing the machine language subroutine was lost. So the 
system hung. If you had just painted a hi-res picture (using locations 
8192 through 16383 or 16384 through 24575) and the strings dangled that 
far down in memory, they'd mess it up, too. 

There are three primary ways of preventing accumulated strings from 
interfering with machine language programs and hi-res pictures. Please 
don't protest that, since you're a beginner and not yet writing in ma- 
chine language, you don't need to know about them. After all, a number 
of useful packages written in machine language can be used right now to 
enhance your Basic programs. These include graphics programs that al- 
low your own programs to draw hi-res pictures, music synthesizers that 
let your programs play music through the Apple's speaker or through 
your own stereo, and programs to let you hear the sound of lasers zap- 
ping and aliens frying. 

We've mentioned the first way of preventing accumulated strings 
from interfering with your other programs. This method involves find- 
ing an empty hole that nothing else will use. About the only one of any 
size is page 3, memory locations $300 through $3FF. But a number of 
commercial packages place their short routines here on boot. 

The second method is to initiate garbage collection routinely with- 
out waiting for Applesoft to realize the need for it. This is done with the 
command X = FRE(O). This command does two things. If you print X 
now, it will tell you the number of free bytes between the top line of Ba- 
sic and the bottom string; unfortunately, it counts places occupied by hi- 
res graphics and machine language programs as also being free because 
Basic itself isn't using them. 

The other thing the command X = FRE(O) does is to initiate early 
garbage collection. Go back into the Monitor and type 95F0.9600 to list 
that range. Repair your machine language program and zero out the 
dangling strings with: 

95F0: 20 DD FB 60 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 

To proofread what you've just done and to make sure that you didn't 
change location $9600, list it by typing 95 FO. 9600. Then return to your 
Basic program and insert the line: 



35 X = FRE(O) 

Run the program again, entering A at least a dozen times. It won't hang. 
Hit N to end it and then go back into the Monitor and look at locations 
$9F50 to $9600. Most of your zeros are still there because your Basic 
program now starts garbage collection after every string, which effec- 
tively starts each string from the top of available memory rather than 
from the end of the last string. 

We spoke earlier of erasing old strings but, as you can see in the 
Monitor, garbage collection doesn't necessarily erase the unused strings. 
In this case, all it had to do was reset the input string pointer to the top of 
available memory so that new strings could overwrite old ones as needed. 

And, finally, the third way of avoiding strangulation is to redefine 
available memory. This is done with the Basic command himenvn, where 
n must be a decimal number. Remove line 35 from your Basic program 
and add the line: 

5 HIMEM:38144 

This command starts the string formation at 38143 and protects any ma- 
chine language programs stored in locations 38144 and beyond. Run 
your program, entering A more than twelve times before you quit with 
an N, and then go into the Monitor. Examine locations $95E0 to $9600. 
There is your machine language program from $95F0 to $95F4. The new 
strings, ASCII code $41 for A and $4E for N, dangle from $95EF 
downward. 

On booting, DOS sets himen at 38400 ($9600), which is just low 
enough to protect itself but not low enough to protect anything else. If 
you change this location, make sure you always know where you've put 
it or else have all your programs relocate it as needed. Himem is not re- 
set by typing new or run. Nor does it help to hit reset or to remove the 
program line that set himem after you've run the program. If himem is 
not where you want it for the next program, you've got to move it your- 
self unless you know that the next program will. 

One last word of warning. Don't set himem above the bottom of 
DOS. Your garbage can garble your disk operating system just as effec- 
tively as it can zap the machine language programs you create. m

Exploring Business Basic, Part 16 

This month's column features our most am- 
bitious program yet (at least in size). It's a data- 
base manager that shows how binary tree data 
structures can be used for data access. If you 
have been following along, you'll recognize sev- 
eral old and many new techniques used in this 
example program. Even though it's a pretty 
long program, it's only the bare bones of a da- 
tabase program, giving you plenty of opportu- 
nities to add your own wrinkles. 

Remembrance of Things Past. If you 
haven't read last month's article, you really 
should become familiar with the topics we dis- 
cussed therein before perusing this month's mis- 
sive. Remember that in a binary tree structure 
each value has associated with it a pointer to 
values less than the value (a "left" pointer) and 
a pointer to values greater than the value (a 
"right" pointer). Because there is no way of pre- 
dirting the sequence in which values will be add- 
ed to the tree, each individual branch may or 
may not contain both left and right pointers. 
For example, consider how you would arrange 
the following list into a binary tree structure: 



1 Johnson 

2 Baker 

3 Phillips 

4 Jones 



5 Williams 

6 Douglas 

7 Connor 



The tree would look like figure 1. 

As a table of pointers, the same data would 

look like table 1.

The binary tree (usually called b-tree) struc- 
ture offers several advantages over other sort- 
ing methods. As you can see, it doesn't take 
many tests to find out where a value goes. This 
is true even if the tree is very large, as long as it's 
reasonably well balanced (with most branches 
of roughly even length). Also, as we saw last 
time, it is easy to construct a sorted hst from the 
b-tree structure, even without reference to the 
original values. Another advantage is that we 
can keep as many b-trees around as memory 
will allow. The hash method we used some 
months back to make a database had the dis- 
advantage that only one field could be a key 
field. Since we can keep multiple b-tree struc- 
tures around, it is possible to have many differ- 
ent keys in the same file. The b-tree has some 
problems as an access method, however, and 
we'll cover those as we get into the program. 

Bird's-Eye View of Our Tree. Our b-tree 
database program uses two files. One contains 
the actual data records, implemented as a sin- 
gle string in a random access textfile. The single 
string textfile approach was chosen to keep 
things simple. You could easily change it by 
modifying the fiJe read and write routines. As- 
sociated with the main file is a key file, with its 
name formed by appending .key to the end of 
the main file name. Information about the 
structure of the database is kept in the key file, 
along with the actual key values and b-tree 
pointers. If at program start-up you request a 
file that doesn't yet exist, the program allows you 
to define it, including the names of the fields, 
which fields are to be key values, and where in 
the output record the field is to go. If the key file 
does exist, then all the required information is 
read from it, and the main file is opened for 
access. 

One of the interesting things about the pro- 



man 



gram is that it allows you to specify whether 
keys must be unique or not and checks when 
you enter a key value to be sure. The program 
requires at least one key value to be unique and 
uses the first such value as the key for deleting 
records. Examples of unique keys are social se- 
curity numbers or employee numbers. With 
some programming effort you could change this 
to allow choosing the record to delete from sev- 
eral different fields, but the technique shown is 
simpler and safer. Other general capabilities in- 
clude getting simple lists based on key or non- 
key values. The program automatically knows 
when your search field is a key and uses the fast 
key look-up routine. For nonkey fields, the pro- 
gram scans the whole file looking for a match. 

One last thing before we get started. This 
program as it stands keeps all key information 
in memory. This makes it fast, but it limits the 
number of records that the program can han- 
dle. Fortunately, the Apple III has lots of mem- 
ory, but even the biggest Apple III can run out of 
memory if you have lots of records and keys. 
With a little effort, and a tradeoff of size versus 
performance, part of the key arrays can be kept 
on disk in a random access file. You should still 
keep as much of the first part of the key arrays 
in memory as possible, to reduce the number of 
disk accesses. 

Now for the program: 

15 DIM item$(99),ib%(99),ie%(99), 

ik%(99),id%(99) 
20 DIM dup%(1000) 
25 z=0:o1 = 1:o2 = 2:bell$ = CHR$(7) + 

CHR$(7):b20$ = " ) ":REM 

b20$ is 20 spaces 

28 blanks = b20$+b20$ + b20$+b20$+b20$ 

29 blank$ = blank$+blank$ + MID$

Then a gosub to line 1000 does the file initiali-

the arrays declared in lines 15 and 20 will be

This next section of the program displays 
the main menu once the file has been initial- 
ized. Note that the list of functions was kept 
simple. It is easy to add additional routines to 
the menu by modifying a few lines. Note also 
the window statement. This method will be used 
extensively to keep header information on the 
screen during times when the display normally 
scrolls upward. The gosub in line 410 (gosub 
1 500) references the routine that saves the 
changes made to the file during a program run. 
This routine will be covered in more detail later. 

500 FOR key=0 TO num.key-1 
510 testrec= 1 

540 IF sort$(kev,rec)> = sort$(key,testrec) 
THEN 570 

550 IF sortpl%(key,testrec) THEN testrec= 
ABS(sortpr/o(key,testrec)):GOTO 540 

560 sortpl.%(key,testrec) = rec:GOTO 590 

570 IF sortpr%(key,testrec) THEN testrec 
=ABS(sortpr%(key,testrec)):GOTO 540 

580 sortpr%(key, testrec) =rec 

590 NEXT 

595 RETURN 

The routine in lines 500 through 595 should 
look familiar to those of you who were tuned in 
last time. Last month's version handled only 
one key, while this one uses a two-dimensional 
sort value array and pointer arrays to update 
multiple keys. Another change will probably be 
of interest to you sharp-eyed routine watchers. 
Note that lines 550 and 570 assign the absolute 
value (ABS) of the pointer array to the variable 
testrec. This precaution was taken because, as 
we shall see later, a negative pointer is used as 
an indication that the given value has been de- 
leted, even though the value itself must remain 
to complete the b-tree. 

600 testrec= 1 :dup = 0:errorcode=0:del.rec = 

(sortpl%(key,0)<0) 
610 IF key$ >==sort$(key,testrec) THEN 630 
615 del.rec=(sortpl%(key,testrec)<0) 
620 IF sortpl%(key,testrec) THEN testrec = 

ABS(sortpl%(key,testrec)):GOTO 610 
625 RETURN 

630 IF key$<>sort$(key,testrec) THEN 640 



635 IF NOT del.rec THEN dup=dup+1: 

dup%(dup)=testrec 
640 del.rec= (sortpr%{key, testrec) <0) 
645 IF sortpr%(key,testrec) THEN testrec= 

ABS(sortpr%(key,testrec)): GOTO 6 1 0 
650 RETURN 

The routine from 600 to 650 is a variation 
on the binary tree search routine in the pre- 
vious example, except that its sole function is to 
assemble a list of record numbers whose key 
values match the variable keyS. These are stored 
in the array dup%. Note that the variable del.rec 
is used as a flag to ignore a record if its pointer 
is negative (deleted). This routine is used by the 
program's Find function to scan the file for 
matching key values and return all records that 
apply. 

700 testrec= 1:errorcode=0;del.rec = 

(sortpl%(key,0)<0) 
710 IF key$>=sort$(key .testrec) THEN 730 
715 del.rec= (sortpl%(key,testrec)<0) 
720 IF sortpl%(key,testrec) THEN testrec = 

ABS(sortpl%(key,testrec)):GOTO 

710:ELSE:RETURN 
730 IF key$=sort$( key, testrec) AND NOT 

del.rec THEN errorcode= 1 :RETURN 
735 del.rec^ (sortpr%(key,testrec)<0) 
740 IF sortpr%(key,testrec) THEN iestrec= 

ABS(sortpr%(key,testrec)):GOTO 

710:ELSE:RETURN 

The routine from lines 700 to 740 is the most 
specialized of all. Its sole function in life is to 
check to see if a given key value has a duplicate 
value already in the file. It is used to ensure that 
the keys marked "no duplicates" are in fact 
unique.

CHR$(31);:VP0S = line:HP0S = 
col: RETURN 

930 FOR 1 = 1 TO delay*60:PRINT 
CHR$(22);:NEXT:RETURN 

The short routines in lines 900 through 930 
are utilities that are used throughout the pro- 
gram. Lines 9(K) and 905 put a message in the 
message window and restore the cursor. Line 
910 clears the message window, and line 930 
CTeates a delay by printing screen sync charac- 
ters (one-sixtieth of a second each). The length 
of the pause in seconds is determined by the 
value of the variable delay. Remember that de- 
lays on the Apple III should be programmed 
like this, rather than with for-next loops only. 
Because the Apple III is interrupt-driven, it is 
really impossible to tell exactly how long a given 
routine will take to execute. 

Now for the fun stuff: .

You guessed it, the initialization routine! 
The first step is to open the key file, formed by 
adding .key to the file name in line 1010. If it 
exists and contains data, then initialization pro- 
ceeds. If it doesn't exist (this is checked for in 
line 1020), then the program jumps to line 1 100, 
where the new file is created. Line 1030 reads a 
number of important variables from the key 
file. Most of them are self-explanatory. 

Variables ending in .rec point to the begin- 
ning record numbers in the key file where the 
associated arrays are to be found. Thus pl.rec is 
the record number where the sortpl% array is to 
be found and item.rec points to where the lists of 
data item definitions start. The exception to this 
rule is tot.rec, which is simply the total of vahd 
(undeleted) records in the file. This is different 
from num.rec, which is the total number of 
physical records. 

After reading these variables from the key 
file, the main file is opened in line 1032 using the 
record length that was read from the key file. 
Line 1033 then dimensions the appropriate ar- 
rays according to the number of keys defined in 
the key file. Note that this is an extremely 
powerful capability not found in many ver- 
sions of Basic. The arrays have been arbitrarily 
defined to be 1,000 records long. If you have a 
128K system and use lots of keys, you may 
want to reduce this total number. 

The rest of the routine determines whether it 
is necessary to read in the key data and, if it is, 
does so in lines 1050 through 1095. We'll cover 
the meaning of the arrays in line 1095 in a mo- 
ment when we talk about the creation routine. 

1100 PRINT"The file ";file$;" is not a 

database file" 
1110 INPUT"Do you wish to make it a 

database file? ";a$ 
1120 a$ = MID$(a$,1,1):IF INSTR("Yy",a$) 

THEN 1200 
1140 DELETE file$ + 

".key":errorcode= 1 :RETURN 

The section from lines 1100 through 1140 
prepares for the creation of a new file. Note the 
use of INSTR in line 1120. It substitutes for if 
a$="Y" oraS="y" then 1200. Another way to 
write line 1 120 is iflNSTRf Yy".MID$(a$J.l )) 
then 1200.

This rather elaborate input routine prompts 
for each field name, gets beginning and ending 
columns, and asks whether the field is to be a 
key. If the field is a key, the routine asks 
whether duplicate values are allowed. Note the 
extensive use of vpos and hpos to facilitate edit- 
ing, and the use of INSTR and MIDS in lines 
1340 through 1357 to save time and program 
size. As can be seen by examination, itemS holds 
the individual field names, ib% and ie% hold the 
beginning and ending field positions (and thus 
the maximum field size), and ik% and id% hold 
the flags for key fields and duplicates allowed. If 
memory size is a problem, these two arrays 
could be combined with a minimal amount of 
programming effort.

Volume T\iyOl 





T.M. 

by Bob Nacon 



The success of the original Amper-Mag i c" program package and the 
Introduction of its technique for attaching new commands to Applesoft 
programs has stimulated the production of Command Library" packages 
designed around a 'theme' such as information display or output, input, 
memory management, etc., which will enhance your Applesoft programs. They 
will give your program a professional operation and appearance by 
increasing speed, reducing size, and giving you features you never could 
have before, while still allowing yo'u to program with the ease of BASIC. 

Amper-Maglc Command Library No. 2 is dedicated to information display 
and output capabilities. Read on and enjoy the new programming power 
Ampei — Magic Command Library No, 2 wll I give you. 

This disk contains 27 machine language routines ready to be inserted 
quickly and painlessly into your own Applesoft programs. Included among 
them is the most powerful PRINT USING routine yet created for Applesoft, 
as well as some small but very handy routines for controlling the appear- 
ance and activity on the display screen. 

In order to use these commands, you will need the Ampei — Magic program 
itself which is contained on Volume One. SOME commands on this disk are: 

** Access the most powerful PRINT USING command EVER for the Apple. 
It sure does more than Just line up decimal points! it works with 
strings of characters as wel i as numbers, and lets the program de- 
cide whether to make them Flash or Inverse or Normal depending on 
conditions you specify. With numbers, you can have fixed or 
floating dollar sign and/or optional commas and a variety of fill 
characters. You can embed standard phrases within your format de- 
sign. You can even print to the screen WHILE outputtinq to the 
printer! And generate NO GARBAGE to collect! All in ail, the 
most powerful PRINT USING yet! 

** Print to the screen while a peripheral Is active 

** Save and restore instantly any text screen, no ntetter how complex 
with flashing, Inverse, and any window settings,., 

** Make your program WAIT a length of time specified in ordinary sec- 
onds (to the tenth of a second); the time may be a variable or 
expression which can be controlled by the program.,, 

** Print anywhere on the screen under program control, either with 
absolute movements or with relative movements,,, 

** Print string arrays to any device, with or without an appended 
special character, and WITHOUT A LOOP,,. 

** Set, clear, or toggle ANY bit or bits anywhere In RAM meirory... 

** Check the keyboard when called, pause if SPACEBAR is pressed, then 
continue If SPACE is pressed again or GOTO a location if RETURN is 
pressed. . . 

** Print the current text screen on command or from the program... 

** Send ASCII characters to peripheral devices and POKE peripheral 
card memory to set or clear bits for control purposes...

This Add routine is long but relatively 
straightforward. The only real twist occurs in 
lines 2080 to 2095, in which the check for 
unique values is performed. Line 2080 checks to 
see whether or not a given field is supposed to 
be unique, skipping to line 2100 if it's a non- 
unique field. If the field is supposed to be 
unique, a gosub to the routine at 700 is per- 
formed and the data is checked against all pre- 
vious entries. 

Notice that in line 2100 the record is built up 
by using SUBS to insert fields into the lineS 
string. After all fields are entered, a gosub to 
line 500 is performed to add all the keys to the 
pointer arrays.

This Delete routine is much tougher techni- 
cally. Because the b-tree depends on an ordered 
structure of key values, it's not possible simply 
to blank out a value in sortS and zero out the 
pointers in the arrays. The full solution is more 
complex than it's worth delving into here (read 
about "balanced b-trees" and "b-splat" trees in 
references). To keep things simple, we just ne- 
gate the pointers and go on. This is done in lines 
3170 through 3220.

This is the start of the rather long Find rou- 
tine, which gives the option of searching on an 
individual field or using the first unique field, 
the same one used by Delete. This second op- 
tion was put in for convenience, since the same 
thing can be accomplished with option 1 and a 
little more effort. An interesting option that 
could be added would be the ability to search 
on combinations of fields.

5450 GOTO 5355 

This is the routine used to scan the key file 
for a value. Notice that it uses the subroutine at 
line 600 to pull duplicates of a given value. Then 
the dup% array is used as the record list. 

5475 select=0 

5480 IF select.all=1 THEN select=1: 
RETURN 

5485 IFselect.all = 2AND field$> = "l" THEN 

select= 1:RETURN 
5490 IF field$=value$ THEN select=1: 

RETURN 
5495 RETURN 

The routine in lines 5475 through 5495 is 
used by the search routine to determine whether 
the field meets the search criteria. 

5500 field. num = unique:key= -1 :FOR 1 = 1

HPOS:GOSUB 900 

5530 key$=a$ 

5535 GOTO 5415 

Line 5500 sets up the search for the first 
unique field and then uses the regular key- 
search routine to complete. 

5600 INPUT#1,rec;line$ 

5601 no.rec=0 

5602 IF LEN(line$)<rec.len-1 THEN

5650 PRINT"("line$")" 
5655 rec.found= 1:RETURN 

5900 no.error=1:RETURN 

The preceding routines are general pur- 
pose. The search routines and other parts of the 
program use them to perform actual read op- 
erations on the files. 

And now, at long last, we come to the final 
routine (at least for this article!). 

8000 TEXT:HOME:PRINT"Llst all records in 

file '";file$'"."

8035 msg$=CONV${tot.rec)+" records 
listed. Press RETURN to continue:": 
GOSUB 900:GET a$ 

8040 no.error=1:RETURN 

Lines 8000 through 8040 provide a quick list 
of all records using the previously defined read 
routines. 

There — more than anyone wants to know 
about b-tree access methods in Basic! Purists 
among you will note that a lot has been left to 
the imagination. For example, what happens 
when the key array fills up with deleted rec- 
ords? How fast will this method add records 
when there are lots of records and lots of dupli- 
cates? These are real questions, and they are 
solvable with effort and cleverness. 

It was not the intention of this article to give 
you a working, general-purpose database pro- 
gram. There are plenty of those on the market 
for the Apple III. Rather, the program has given 
us a chance to explore programming tech- 
niques that may prove very useful in specific 
tasks and should enrich your knowledge of pro- 
gramming in general. It is therefore with misty 
eyes that we bid databases a fond, albeit tem- 
porary, farewell. M

Part 1: Labels, Legends, and Keys 



BV DAVID DURKEE 

Since the dawn of history humankind has longed for ways to convey 
profit and loss ratios at a glance. Early cave drawings found in the south 
of France are now thought to be primitive attempts at expressing proto- 
economic trends, but, as the culture that produced them had no concept 
of numbers greater than three, these early graphs were completely lack- 
ing in modem refinements. In modern times, of course, graphs are fre- 
quently, even casually, used on a daily basis by sociologists, business- 
men, students, professors, and especially politicians. Your Apple, 
whether you know it or not, is uniquely qualified to help you partake of 
this age-old ritual. So put on your programming hat and we shall forge 
together into this uncharted territory. 

Our goal for this endeavor is singular, but ambitious. We propose to 
develop a unified graphing system. Though the system will be composed 
of several Applesoft programs as well as a few machine language rou- 
tines, the individual components will act as a unit. One program will ac- 
cept, store, and edit data from which the others will be able to create 
Cartesian coordinate charts, which combine line graphs and bar graphs 
on a two-dimensional grid, and pie charts. 

Line and bar graphs allow you graphically to display prices, values, 
production levels, or other depjendent variables as they vary over the 
range of values of a single independent variable, most commonly time. 
Pie charts are useful for showing how individual components of a sys- 
tem relate quantitatively to the whole. Both types of charts have an ad- 
vantage over the data from which they are created. Where a huge array 
of numbers is often confusing, the charts that can be made from them 
usually simplify things immensely. 

Now, if you're not completely lost so far, you should have no diffi- 
culties in the pages, and installments, to come. Compared to the last two 
paragraphs, the rest of the series will be a breeze. 

The first actual graph program won't come until next month; there 
are foundations to be laid down first. A major stumbhng block to creat- 
ing professional looking graphs on the hi-res screen is labeling them. 
Using what Apple has given you, you can have four lines of text at the 
bottom. This is totally inadequate, not only because any graph using 
Cartesian coordinates has two axes to label, but also because the text and 
hi-res displays are in different areas of memory, complicating the task of 
saving and printing out your work. 

Hi-Res Writing Resolved. Without going into all the other possible 
ways of putting text on the hi-res screen, we'll jump right into shape ta- 
bles. Listing 1 is a nice long program that you'll only run once. Seem like 
a waste of time? Not so. The program creates a shape table for forty-nine 
ASCII characters; not all the characters on the Apple keyboard are rep- 
resented, but it should serve our purposes. Once we've run the program, 
we'll save the table to disk so we can retrieve it quickly when we need it. 
Save the Applesoft program too, though. If we have to add any more 
symbols to the table, that's where we'll be starting. 

The shapes are organized in a logical sequence based on their ASCII 
values. Table 1 shows the characters, their ASCII values and shape num-

bers, and the data lines they can be found on. Typing in such a large pro- 
gram, especially with so many data statements, you are likely to make a 
few typographical errors. The table and the program in listing 2 should 
allow you to pinpoint exactly where any errors are. 



The program in listing 1 to poke in the shape table is surprisingly 
simple. The variable SL in line 10 is the location in memory where the ta- 
ble will begin. The 24576 might not seem like a very round number, but 
it's the same as $6000 in hexadecimal. This location is immediately above

hi-res page two. We'll be using the second hi-res screen for display to al- 
low our programs to be longer. Because Applesoft programs ordinarily 
start at 2048 (in hex, $800) and move up from there, and the first hi-res 
page begins at 8192 ($2000), Applesoft programs that use hi-res page one 
are limited in memory use to 6K, and some of that space is used for vari- 
ables. Using page two instead allows us a generous 14K. Anything we 
can put into specific areas of memory, like the shape table, will go above 
hi-res page two. 

Going back to line 10, NB is the number of bytes in the table. It's 
right up front there to remind us to change it if we add any shapes to the 
table. Line 20 sets the Apple's shape table pointer. When the draw com- 
mand is executed in Basic, the computer looks to this pointer to find out 
what to draw. Finally, lines 30 through 50 read the data and poke it into 
memory. 



10 TEXT : HGR 

20 FOR Y = 0 TO 40 STEP 10 

30 FOR X = 0 TO 9 

40 IF Y + X = 0 THEN 60 

50 XDRAW Y + X AT X * 10 + 20,Y + 20 

60 NEXT X,Y 

Listing 2. Sliape table test. 



But What Do All Those Numbers Mean? The first seven data state- 
ments (lines 100 through 160) are the index to the table. Be sure you get 
those right or nothing else will work. After line 160, each line of data rep- 
resents one shape. If, when you attempt to draw a shape, the computer 
displays some sort of incoherent garbage, you will know that the error 
was in the index, the data line for that shape, or any of the data lines be- 
fore it. Any error in the data for one shape is likely to affect all the shapes 
after it. Displaying all the shapes should show you where the error origi- 
nated. Listing 2 is a quick program to test the shape table. It assumes, of 
course, that the table is in memory. 

When you're convinced the table is all there in working order, save it 
on disk with the command 

BSAVESHAPEFILE, A24576, L480 

Whenever you want to use the shapefile, you can get it back with the 
commands: 

BLOAD SHAPEFILE 
POKE 232,0: POKE 233,96 

Now let's do something with our shape table. Listing 3 is a routine 
we'll use as a print statement in our later programs. The calling program 
must define five variables, X, Y, D, F, and W$. The word or phrase to be 
printed goes to W$. The direction is indicated by the value of D. If D is 1, 



LOCK-IT-UP 



DISKETTE COPY-PROTECTION 
AND DUPLICATION SYSTEMS 
FOR THE APPLE COMPUTER 



The Lock-lt-Up systems are sophisticated, menu 
driven copy-protection and duplication utilities for the 
Apple II Computer. They feature several levels of pro- 
tection which make standard diskettes uncopyable by 
even the most sophisticated nibble copy programs 
currently available. 

• All sectors on the diskette can still be used. 

• Data files can be loaded and/or saved to either the pro- 
tected diskette or an unprotected diskette. 

• Memory will be cleared and the disk will reboot if the reset 
key is pushed. 

• The copying systems support up to 14 disk drives. 

• Complete data-verification is optional during copy. 

• Sequential serial numbers are assigned to each diskette 
produced by the system. 

• Master diskettes created with the system contain an I.D. 
stamp that you select. The I.D. stamp must be correctly 
specified before any diskettes can be duplicated. This pre- 
vents other Lock-lt-Up owners from copying your diskettes. 

• Extensive support is provided should you have any prob- 
lems or special needs. 

• Our system is supported by numerous disk copying services 
should you need a large quantity of diskettes duplicated. 

Either system is available for $225, which includes three diskettes, an 
informative manual, and a non-exclusive license to copy as many 
diskettes as needed.

Key U//Z is an Apple II compatible peripheral which is designed to take some of the drudgery 
out of constructing Visicalc models and to reduce the time necessary to learn to use this program. A 
good deal of time spent learning Visicalc is devoted to memorizing codes to use various program func- 
tions. Likewise, much of the time which is spent using Visicalc is devoted to typing in groups of com- 
mand codes. With Key Wiz, keys are labeled in plain English. No memorization is necessary. Instead of 
typing three keys to reset the column width, simply press the ''column width" key. What could be 
simpler? Key Wiz also has a 19 key numeric key pad. This can be used with any program which can 
make use of these keys but is especially helpful when using Visicalc as it has 6 additional keys to be used 
when entering formula. Don't spend $150 or more for a numeric key pad when Key Wiz can do so 
much more.

then they'll face in a direction perpendicular to the writing direction. In 
other words, the letters will be stacked above one another. This is pri- 
marily for labeling vertical axes. If F is 2, the letters will face in the same 
direction as the line, for normal printing. 

Finally, X and Y indicate where the word will begin. The range of 
values for these variables corresponds exactly to the dimensions of the hi- 



res screen.

Listing 3, Hi-res print routine. 



Lines 9000 and 9010 deal with print direction and character facing, 
which we just discussed. Then the word is compared one character at a 
time with all the possible character values to determine the shape num- 
ber to draw. Lines 9040 through 9120 are the comparison tests. The most 
likely conditions are tested first, minimizing the number of comparisons 
made and thus optimizing the speed of execution. Line 9150 draws the 
character and 9160 and 9170 determine the location of the next charac- 
ter based on the printing and facing directions selected. 

The Portable Printer. You can use this routine in your own pro- 
grams without much difficulty; just make sure to set the variable values 
before calling the routine. If your programs use a separate shape table, 
you will be okay as long as the two tables are in different places and you 
reset the shape table pointer when you want to switch tables. 

Also remember that the routine assumes that the scale is 1 . If your 
program changes the scale, be sure to set it back before calling this rou- 
tine. Similarly, the routine sets the rotation based on the values of D and 
F, so if your program uses rotation you'll have to reset it after calling the 
hi-res print routine. 

Listing 4 is a final quickie to help demonstrate and test the hi-res 
print routine. Type it in with the routine and run. It simply inputs the 
values of the necessary variables and calls the hi-res printer. 

Next month we'll use the shape table and the hi-res printer in a pie 
chart program. A moratorium on "easy as pie" puns is hereby called un- 
til March.

THE BASIC 



olution 



By Wm. Y R. Smith 





With the holidays finally over and the last 
assaults against your 1982 budget behind you, 
the time has come to plan for the new year. 
With the economy as it is today, you naturally 
want to eke as many pennies out of your sav- 
ings as possible. To help in this pursuit, this 
month's Basic program will help you calculate 
compound interest. 

Annual interest is calculated by multiplying 
the principal (in this case, your savings) by the 
interest rate once a year. Except it isn't usually 
that simple. Most banks calculate interest more 
than once a year. Quarterly or monthly interest 
accrual is not uncommon, and many banks now 
calculate interest on a daily basis. 

This means that whenever the interest is cal- 
culated the principal is not actually multiplied 
by the annual rate but by the annual rate di- 
vided by the number of interest periods in a year. 
This affects your financial situation in two 
ways. First, with daily calculation you stand to 
lose less interest by withdrawing part of the 
principal at an odd time of the year than you 
would lose with yearly, quarterly, or monthly 
calculation. Second, as interest earnings are 
plowed right back into the principal automati- 
cally, with interest accrued daily, the interest 
you earned on Monday starts to earn you more 
money on Tuesday. 

This sort of interest calculation affects you 
in one more way: it makes it really complicated 
to figure your interest income on your ten dol- 
lar calculator. 

There are actually two ways to determine 
compound interest. One is to plug the values for 
principal, interest rate, number of periods per 
year, and time into a formula. The other meth- 
od is brute force: calculating the interest for 
each period in a repetitive loop. We'll be using 
the second method, which offers the advantage 
of allowing us to keep a running balance. 

Enter this month's program and run it. As 
an opening example, try calculating the interest 
on one hundred dollars at 10 percent with in- 
terest calculated yearly (one period per year). 
Then try the same example again with interest 
calculated daily (365 periods per year). 

There is a difference in the results. 



There is a lot more that can be done with in- 
terest calculation than we have covered here. 
For instance, you might make provisions for en- 
tering deposits and withdrawals and recording 
the dates of transactions. Using text file read 
and write routines, which we have covered in 
several different contexts in the Basic Solution, 
you could keep all of your financial transac- 
tions on disk and always be one step ahead of 
your bank statement. 

Good luck this year with your savings and 
programming.

Unless otherwise noted, all products can be assumed to run on either Apple 
II, with 48K, ROM Applesoft, and one disk drive. The requirement for 
ROM Applesoft can be met by RAM Applesoft in a language card. Many 
Apple II programs will run on the Apple III in the emulator mode. 

□ What's new from Apple Computer (20525 Mariani Avenue, Cuper- 
tino, CA 95014; 408-996-1010)? Three years of research and develop- 
ment by Apple has produced mass storage systems for Apple III users. 
UniFile contains a high-density disk drive, and DuoFile holds two of 
them. Each drive provides 871,424 bytes of on-line storage to comple- 
ment the 140K Disk III drive that is built into the Apple III. DuoFile 
contains two drives, for a storage capacity of 1.7 megabytes. Both Uni- 
File and DuoFile use Fileware disks which contain 62 Vi tracks per inch, 
giving you six times the capacity of the conventional single-sided 48-track 




disk. UniFile, less than $1,000; DuoFile, less than $1,700. Apple also has 
two colorful guides for those who want to learn more about personal 
computers. The first is the Personal Guide to Personal Computers, an in- 
troduction for people who would like to have a personal computer for 
home use. The guide explains how computers are used, how they work, 
and how to shop for one. Fifty pages. $1 .95. Personal Computers in Busi- 
ness introduces managers, professionals, and small business owners to 
the personal computer as a business tool. It's chock-full of information 
that explains how computers are used in large and small offices, how 
they work, how to plan for them, how to evaluate different systems, 
where to shop, and how to estimate costs. Fifty pages. $2.95. 

□ Is anybody listening? Probably. Century Systems (12872 Valley View 
Avenue, Suite IIB, Garden Grove, CA 92645; 714-895-3381) takes care 
of nosy people with ComCrypt, a program that combines computer com- 
munications with encryption and decryption to send and receive CP/M 
files with complete security. ComCrypt helps to prevent unauthorized 
eavesdropping on computer communication that is going over tele- 
phone lines or by direct wire between terminals. The encrypted chat 
mode allows two users of the program to have completely secure com- 
munications between themselves over modem or on timesharing sys- 
tems. CP/M is a must. $250. 

□ Maxell (60 Oxford Drive, Moonachie, NJ 07074; 201-440-8020) 
strengthens its commitment to quality by announcing a new warranty 
policy. They now guarantee that all their floppy disks will be free from 
manufacturing defects in materials and workmanship for the lifetime of 
the original purchaser. Any defective disk will be replaced free. 

□ As an upgrade to their Palantir word processor. Designer Software 
(3400 Montrose, Suite 718, Houston, TX 77006; 713-520-8221) has 
added Mailout, which gives Palantir the ability to generate automatic 
form letters. Mailout gives you full variables and conditionals as well as 
the ability to include information from a data or text file from an ex- 
ternal document file. It also has four-function integer math, an essential 
for report generation. The new version of Palantir is $450. Current 
Palantir owners may upgrade for $25. 



□ No more delays; now you can connect your computer directly to the 
New York Stock Exchange Ticker line. First Flight Data Systems (Box 
555, Kitty Hawk, NC 27949; 919-441-6480) gets you there with The 
Monitor, a ticker tape and portfolio monitoring system that eliminates 
delays and long-distance phone calls. The system package includes soft- 
ware, interface circuitry with connecting cable, and a NYSE stock guide. 
You get ticker tape, a portfolio monitor, advance /decline indicator, tick 
index, stock prices, and data files. Requires NYSE line. $1,800. 

□ John Wiley and Sons (605 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10158; 
212-850-6336) has two book-and-disk combinations as their entries into 
the software market. A pple Basic: Data File Programming shows how to 
get maximum use from the Apple for data management. It teaches how 
to program and maintain data files for billings, catalogs and lists, nu- 
merical and statistical data, and more. $32.90. Golden Delicious Games 
for the Apple Computer features a book that teaches how to create games. 
The package comes with prepared games and some game subroutines 
that can be added. $47.90. 

□ Rank Master is a tool from Exemplary Software (725 Cowper, Suite 
46, Palo Alto, CA 94301; 415-328-0545) that allows decision makers to 
consider relevant qualitative variables in the decision-making process. To 
set priorities, you create a description of the problem, specify criteria that 
establish how alternatives affect the goal, and synthesize the criteria to 
develop a ranking of alternatives. $195.

The next generation. First generation electronic 
worksheets were a good idea. They were early software 
management tools that could eliminate a lot of hours 
with a spreadsheet, calculator, pencil and eraser. Enter 
Multiplan, the next generation electronic worksheet 
that's as easy to use as it is useful. 
Make comparisons. Compare Multiplan to any of 
the earlier electronic worksheets. We've given you some 
"prompts" above. 

Compare learning time. Multiplan's tutorial book brings 
you up to speed. Fast. But Multiplan doesn't stop there. 
Multiplan's On-line Reference Guide gives you instant 
help if you have questions. It knows where you are in 
Multiplan and offers information related to your problem, 
right on the screen. 

Compare ease of use. All Multiplan prompts are 
full length words or phrases. And Multiplan provides 
"naming," the ability to assign a plain English name to any

of VisiCalc on the Apple II and IBM-PC respectively 



cell or area. "Gross Profit = Sales — Cost" rather than 
"AA44=AZ23— BK154." Which means you can work 
more intuitively. And faster. 

Compare utility. Multiplan lets you link related work- 
sheets so that information is transferred between them 
automatically For instance, you can keep regional sales 
forecasts on separate sheets but link them with your overall 
company forecast. Then, just change the forecast for 
any region, and the company forecast sheet is updated 
automatically. Something you can't do with first generation 
worksheets. 

Compare reports. Not just the work you can do, but the 

way you can present it. Multiplan's flexible formatting 
options allow you to produce presentation-quality reports. 
And its sorting capability lets you sort by either alpha- 
betic or numeric order. So a sales manager who normally 
lists sales regions alphabetically could sort by amount 
sold and conveniently rank by sales performance. The

Multiplan supports both 40- and 80- columns on the

to make Multiplan the electronic worksheet for 
now. And years from now.

The Apple software market has come a long way. The winner of 
So/talk's First Annual Most Popular Software Poll, which covered Ap- 
ple software released prior to January 1, 1981, was the venerable 
Invader. Last year's winner, from a field of contenders released from Oc- 
tober 1, 1980, to January 1, 1982, was Raster Blaster, Bill Budge's pin- 
ball masterpiece. Now it's time to cast your ballot to put a third pro- 
gram in our software hall of fame. 

Though the first two winners were both games, keep in mind when 
you vote that we're looking for the best programs regardless of cate- 
gory — business, word processing, education, home, and hobby as well as 
games. Apple III owners are encouraged to vote too. When all the votes 
are tallied, the results will be set up like our monthly bestsellers, with a 
top thirty for all programs and top fives or tens in each major category. 

So tell us what programs you use and like, and we'll spread the word. 
We welcome your comments as well; maybe they'll shed some light on 
how a turkey piece of software can become a bestseller or how a real gem 
can languish on the store shelf gathering dust. 

In the first two years of the poll, the term state of the art has come to 
have a whole new meaning in Apple graphics. The standards for other 
aspects of program quality have gone up as well. By telling the market 



what you want and what you like, you the consumer are a major impetus 
behind the rising expectations of what makes a good program. 

This is why Softalk asks its readers to speak out en masse once a year 
about the software they like best. Factors like flashy packaging and a 
clever advertising campaign can sometimes contribute more to sales fig- 
ures than program quality. Reviews look at software products in depth, 
but it's always possible for a reviewer's analysis to miss the mark. The in- 
dustry gets some of its best feedback on software quality through the 
mechanism of this poll. 

A hotly debated issue, at least in "some circles, is just how far state of 
the art can go. Some folks say that the best Apple program has already 
been written. Others cite the fact that people have been surprising Jobs 
and Wozniak with what the Apple is capable of for years now and be- 
lieve that they'll continue to do so. This controversy may never be re- 
solved to everybody's satisfaction, but, to fan the flames a litde, Softalk is 
introducing a new element to the Most Popular Software Poll. We'd like 
you to name, in addition to your ten favorite programs from this year, 
your number one program of all time. With that we'll see how this year's 
models stack up against the classics. 

Rules. Only one ballot per Apple user will be accepted; this means 



These packages or programs are my favor- 
ites, in descending order, of all those released 
in 1982 or in November or December of 1981 
with which I'm familiar

that a family-owned Apple might generate four or five -ballots — one for 
each member of the family. Where there are two ballots from one per- 
son, only one will be counted if the choices are the same and neither will 
be counted if the choices differ. Your ballot must reach Softalk by Feb- 
ruary 15, 1983. 

For your convenience and ours, you can use the attached card to 
vote. If there are many eligible voters sharing one magazine, or if you 
picked up this Softalk in the dentist's office and the ballot has already 
been ripped out, just send a numbered list of your ten favorites with your 
name, address, and comments. Mail it to Softalk Pops, Box 60, North 
Hollywood, CA 91603. 

The ballot has spaces for your ten favorite programs. This is a 
weighted vote — give us your top ten in order and we'll give the most 
points to the ones that head the list. No fair voting for a program twice. 
Any program that was released between October 1, 1981, and January 1, 
1983, is eligible. The reason for the three-month overlap is that deserv- 
ing programs released late in the year often don't have sufficient chance 
to be noticed for that year's poll; so they're eligible in the following year 
as well. 

The list given here contains a lot of eligible programs, but by no 
means all of them. Use it to jog your memory, not to direct your vote. 



When casting your vote for the most popular program of all time, 
choose only one program. Any program. It can be a program that was 
released this year or a program that appeared years ago, as long as it runs 
on an Apple. 

The two sections of the poll are being tabulated separately, so if your 
all-time favorite is a recent release you'll have to list it as the first pro- 
gram on your top ten list for it to be credited for this year's most popu- 
lar program. 

The votes will be tabulated by members of the Softalk staff, who, 
while they aren't Price Waterhouse, are reasonably scrupulous. The re- 
sults will be hermetically sealed and the winner will be announced at the 
West Coast Computer Faire, where the author and the publisher of the 
winning program will be presented with the coveted award. Even if you 
can't make the fair, you'll be able to read about the poll results in the 
April issue. 

This is a list of many of the programs that are eligible for this year's 
Most Popular Software Poll. The list was compiled from entries in Mar- 
ketalk News, Marketalk Reviews, Softalk Presents The Bestsellers, and 
Fastalk from our last fourteen issues. It is not meant to be all-inclusive, 
however, and you may vote for any programs published between Octo- 
ber 1, 1981, and January 1, 1983.

RANDOM niOaSS IN 
A PRINTING BUFFER? 







Introducing . . . 

The IS PlpeUne" Random Access Printing Buffer. 

Insert pictures, graphics or spread-slieet data into reports. Dupiicate 
form letters— automaticaliy changing addresses on each. Now, all 
your programs can work together to produce printed output. 

For the first time ever, here is a buffer that not only frees your fast com- 
puter from your slow printer but also allows you to rearrange, compose 
and copy your data on its way to the printer, 

■ Random Access Printing— stores paragraphs or pictures for printing 
in any order— any number of times. 

■ FIFO Printing— conventional first-in first-out operation. 

■ Compression of data for efficient utilization of memory space. 

■ Ability to interrupt long-term buffer operations for straight-thru short- 
term printing. 

■ Simple Erase feature to clear buffer. 

■ Automatic duplication capability. 

■ Easily expandable, by you, from 8K Bytes to 128K Bytes. 

The IS Pipeline is Universal— it works with any parallel (Centronics' — 
style) computer/printer combination. A special version is available for 
PKASO™ Printer Interfaces. 

The IS Pipeline is a self-contained unit with operating manual, cables 
and power supply included. 

For more information on the truly revolutionary IS Pipeline Random 
Access Printing Buffer, call us today.

Free Enterprise 

A business management game 

You run your own company making decisions based 
on economic factors and the actions of competitors. 

It's your opportunity to sit on top and run a cor|)oration. 
Free Enterprise, based on an IBM-developed simulation 
for training top-level managers, is as surprising and 
demanding as the real world. 

It lets you face the same on-your-toes challenges you 
would in running a real business: pricing products, 
determining budgets for advertising, production, plant 
improvement, and R&D. Even securing bank loans and 
deciding on stockholder dividends. You use computer 
generated reports to make decisions. But if you're wrong 
you could go bankrupt. Only the shrewd survive! 

Free Enterprise can be played at three competency levels 
so novices can compete with the more experienced, and 
from one to six can play. It's the perfect chance to learn 
about the free enterprise system — to practice business 
strategies — and to enjoy it — with no risks. 

Simulation components: disk, user's manual, pad of 50 
record sheets, and pad of 50 decision sheets. 

To obtain Fiee Enterprise, see your local dealer or 
send in the order form below. 

Operates on Apple II Plus® with 48k RAM and disk 
drive (DOS 3.3): A printer is strongly recommended.

Last month this column contained a position statement with regard 
to locked-up software. Well, okay, I'm not above using some kinds of 
program protection (and, mostly, having a little fun). Here is a trick or 
two to keep certain people from looking at and changing your innova- 
tive Top Secret Applesoft programs. 

Anti-Listers. This non-DOS no-lister trick confuses Applesoft's list 
routine into thinking that your first program line follows itself! Some 
nifty DOS trickery follows. 

First, make sure you "normalize" your Apple's memory by typing 
the DOS command: 

FP 

FP (which stands for floating point) is much more "thorough" than 
your Basic command new. 

Now, load any Applesoft program, or type in a shorty, and make the 
first program line: 

1 REM (PROGRAM NOT LISTABLE) 

Now, peek into memory at location 2049 by typing: 



Our DAISY puts out...

packages yet to be released for

PRINT PEEK(2049) 

Your Apple will answer with an important number; write it down, 
right here: 

Peek (2049) = 



Thanks. Now type: 

POKE 2049,1 

Now list the program. Ha! The first program line repeats itself for- 
ever (or until you hit control-C, whichever comes first), looking like: 

1 REM (PROGRAM NOT LISTABLE) 
1 REM (PROGRAM NOT LISTABLE) 
1 REM (PROGRAM NOT LISTABLE) 
1 REM (PROGRAM NOT LISTABLE) 

1 REM (PROGRAM NOT LISTABLE) 

ad infinitum. 

To repair this "problem," restore the value that was previously stored 
in location 2049. Use the number you just wrote down (say it was 29) and 
do a poke: 

POKE 2049,29 

Now you can list your program to make changes. Add a second pro- 
gram line: 

2 POKE 2049,1 

Now whenever the program is run it will alter itself and become 
unlistable! You can put a repair statement into the program by altering 
line 2 and adding these final lines: 

2 PO = PEEK(2049): POKE 2049,1 

55554 END 

55555 IF PEEK(PQ) THEN POKE 2049,PQ: PRINT "LIST REPAIRED": 
END 

55556 PRINT "RUN PROGRAM, THEN 'GOTO 55555'." 

To make list work properly again, after the program has been run 
(and before you have made any alterations), type: 

GOTO 55555 

Back to the first line: the program line number doesn't have to be 1; 
any line number will do (you poke 2049,7 regardless). We're going to 
hide that line number now, so keep it at one digit for the time being. 

Re-enter line 1 like this: 

1 REM"""*(PROGRAM NOT LISTABLE) 

Notice that no spaces are used between rem and the seven asterisks. 
When you list line 1 (type list 1), a space will be added: 

1 REM '"""{PROGRAM NOT LISTABLE) 

Now, let's change the asterisks to backspaces so the words 
"(PROGRAM NOT LISTABLE)" actually "back up" to the left and 
hide the words "1 REM." Applesoft programs normally start at loca- 
tion 2049, and that will be the case here, especially if you typed that FP 
when you were supposed to. Type this set of commands (no line 
number): 



JANUARY 1983 



v on 



101 



FOR A = 2049 TO 2100: P = PEEK(A): POKE A,P-34*(P = 42): NEXT 

This cryptic statement says, "Look at each location from 2049 to 
2100. If the value there is 42, then subtract 34 from 42 and poke it in." 
Forty-two is the ASCII value of the asterisk, and 8, the value it is 
changed to, is the ASCII value of a backspace or control-H. 

Now type poke 2049,1 (or simply nm, assuming you added line 2) 
and list. You should see, without that ugly line number and rem: 



(PROGRAM 
(PROGRAM 
(PROGRAM 
(PROGRAM 
(PROGRAM 



NOT LISTABLE) 
NOT LISTABLE) 
NOT LISTABLE) 
NOT LISTABLE) 
NOT LISTABLE) 



"But wait a minute (you blurt); what if some snooper doesn't run my 
program; what if he just loads it and lists it?" (You had to think of that.) 
Well, why not make the list command do something other than list? One 
way would be to dig into DOS's command table and change catalog or 
any other DOS command to list, but that could cause other inconven- 
iences. Let's instead put a booby trap into our second program line that 
runs the program in memory (or any program you want), thus doing the 
poke 2049,1 for us. Enter this first program line: 

1 REM"***"(PROGRAM NOT LISTABLE)/&RUN PROGRAM NAME 

Replace "program name" with the name of your program or any 
program you want; use no quote marks. Save the program (or you will 
lose this line), and convert the asterisks, the slash, and the ampersand to 
backspaces, a carriage return (control-M), and a DOS control-D by 
typing these commands (don't hit return until all commands are typed): 



FOR A = 2049 TO 2100: P=PEEK(A): POKE A, P- 
OR P = 38): NEXT 



-34*(P = 42 0R P = 47 



Now list. The carriage return causes the next character (control-C) to 
print at the left margin of the text window, thus executing the DOS com- 
mand (if any) that follows. You could use any DOS command. How 
about FP to erase the program? Or verify program name to run the disk 
drive for no apparent reason. Or init; never mind, cancel that. 

Admittedly, the above shenanigans are a bit time-consuming, since 
Applesoft won't let you enter control-H and control-M in listings di- 
rectly from the keyboard. You can inject control characters into listings 
much faster with a line editor utility like GPLE (Synergistic Software). Or 
just enter this program statement as many times in a program as you 
want: 



or 



or 



1 A$ = "PROGRAM IS NOT LISTABLE": (control-D) FP 
50 A$ = "PROGRAM ISN'T LISTABLE": (control-D) CATALOG 

100 A$ = "PROGRAM IS UNLISTABLE": (control-D) ANY DOS 
COMMAND 

Listing any of these lines anywhere in a program will execute the 
DOS command that follows the invisible control-D. The length of the 
string in A$ is the key here; any statement of the proper length will do the 
trick. The control-D is typed but not seen. Notice that the length of A$ 
depends on the number of digits in the line number. 

Come to think of it, you could use an exec program to inject a no- 
lister command on every other line. This would foil all but the most per- 
sistent snooper. 

The Run Flag. There's a little machine language critter called the run 
flag hiding in your Apple at location 214. Usually it just sits there with a 
value of zero. Take a look at it: 

PRINT PEEK(214) 

There, you see. If you change that zero to any number from 128 to 
255, any Basic command in immediate mode, including list, will be inter- 
preted as the command run. Someone could reset the run flag to zero 
with a DOS command FP, but that would (apparently) erase the pro- 
gram he was trying to list! 

Have fun. And remember to save as you go so you don't lock your- 
self out of your own programs! 31 



ross Clues: 
The unique word 
challenge game. 

It offers intellectual stimulation arcade games can't 
match . . . with all the excitement. 

Fast-action fun isn't just for mystery or arcade games any 
more. Cross Clues is a word game that tests more than 
mere reflexes. It's the mind-challenging evolution of the 
crossword puzzle, with beat-the-clock excitement. The 
playing tempo is lively, but you decide how fast you want 
to go. The computer "umpires" while you compete with 
another player for hidden words, coaxing clues from the 
computer. Since a clue helps your opponent too, suspense 
builds till the end, when the best combination of skill, 
intellect, timing and luck wins. 

If you're ready for an even greater challenge, try 
Concentration Crosswords]" a game that offers 3 levels 
of difficulty and 3 ways to play — for even the most 
demanding word whiz. Again, you compete against the 
clock to uncover hidden words. But once discovered, they 
disappear, to test your memory. Here, a combination of 
word skills, intellect, memoi^ and luck determine the 
winner. 

Both games offer 50 mind-boggling puzzles that appeal 
to young teens through adults. Try them both! You may 
find you've matched wits with monsters and space critters 
long enough.

IF TOITRE CONFUSED 
PERSONAL COMPUTER, 



At this moment, there are no 
less than 50 personal computers 
on the market. And more are 
being introduced every day. 

On one hand, having all those 
options is a good thing. On the 
other, it can make picking the 
right one pretty difficult. 




Start by making a list of the 
things you want to use the com- 
puter for. It can include almost 
anything-any kind of inventory 
filing, accounting, graphics, 
reporting, record-keeping, 
analysis -you name it and there's 
probably a software program that 
does it. 

Next, take the List into a com- 
puter store and ask the salesper- 
son to give you a demonstration 
of the program, or programs 
that will do the things you 
want. 

Even though you'll 
need a computer 
for the software 
demonstra- 



tion, keep in mind the computer 
is just a vehicle. The software is 
the driver. And once you've 
decided on the software, picking 
out the rest of the computer sys 
tem will be much easier. 
The simpler the better. 

Look for software that's easy to 
learn, easy to use, and that does 
the job in the simplest way 
possible. 

Good personal soft- 
ware should be, as the 
computer people say 
"friendly." Meaning 
that it helps you 
do what you 
have to do 
without get- 
ting in the 
way. 



Computers come in two parts. 
You have to buy both. 

We'd like to help. So here are a 
few suggestions about how to buy 
the computer that's right for you. 
Computers come in two parts. 

One part is the "hardware," 
which is the machinery itself. The 
other IS the "software," or a pro- 
gram, as it's sometimes called. 

Software is the part that tells 
the computer what to do, the way 
a driver teUs a car what to do. 

Without software, a computer 
can't do anything. 

And vice versa. 

You have to buy both. 
Buy the software first. 

Since the reason you're buying 
a computer is to get the capability 
the software gives you (remember, 
it's the software that knows how 
to get things done), it makes 
good sense to pick the 
software first. 




Mean- 
ing there 
are no com- 
plicated routines 
to follow to perform 
a simple task. And no 
programming 
language to learn. 
Some people, how- 
ever, will tell you that soft 
ware has to be compli- 
cated to be powerful. 

Nothing could be far- 
ther from the truth. 
Because in order for a 
program to appear simple 
to you on the outside, it has to 
be extremely complex on 
the inside. 



ABOUT BUYING A 
HERE'S SOME HELE 



Good software keeps the com- 
plications in the computer, where 
they belong. And keeps the capa- 
bility at your fingertips. It's that 
simple. 

You simply have to see 
for yoursel£ 

You can read any number of 
interesting books and magazines 
about personal computers. You 
can ask friends who have them. 
You can look at all the sales litera- 
ture you can get your hands on. 
And you should do all those 
things before you decide to buy 

But as helpful as all that can be, 
there really is no substitute for a 
real, live demonstration. 

When you do go out shopping, 
we recommend you take a look at 
the PFS® Family of Software. 

The PFS family is designed the 
way we think all software should 
be; simple, straightforward and 
powerftil. 

Currently three products 
make up the family PFS:FILE, 
PFS:REPORT and PFS:GRAPH, 
with more programs on the way 
Here's a little more about each 
of them. 

PFS:FILE. The simplest way 
to get organized. 

Basically FEjE works like a 
paper filing system, without the 
paper So you can record, file, 
retrieve and review information in 
a fraction of the time it takes with 
a conventional filing system. 

FILE lets you arrange your 
information in "forms" you design 
yourself. So you can get at and 
really use your information in / • 
ways never before possible. 

What's more, FILE lets you 
change the original form without 
having to redo the information on it. 



PFS:R£PORT. Making the most 
of your information. 

REPORT summarizes the 
information on your forms so you 
can use it to analyze, plan and 
make better-informed decisions. 

With REPORT, you get presen- 
tation-quality reports-sorted, cal- 
culated, formatted and printed- 
automatically in seconds, 
PFS:GRAPH. Instant pictures. 

GRAPH gives you presentation 
quality bar charts, line graphs, 
and pie charts, in black and white 
or color, on paper or the com- 
puter screen. To get a clearer 
picture of things and spot trends 
instantly you simply enter your 
information and specify the kind 
of graph or chart you want. 
GRAPH does the rest. 

You can also mix and match 
line and bar graphs, or even stack 
or compare up to four bar graphs 
simultaneously. 

And GRAPH will work with 
PFS.FILE, VisiCalc® fHes, or data 
entered directly into the 
computer 

Best of all, compared to the 
cost of hand-drawn graphics, 
GRAPH can save you enough 
money over the course of a few 
months to pay for the computer it 
runs on.

Instead of using Applesoft to manipulate information in the com- 
puter, as we have in the past, this month we're just going to look into 
ways of organizing data and storing it so that we can get it back when- 
ever we want. Don't let the phrase data storage and retrieval put you off. 
It's what computers are really all about. 

Let's imagine that we want to create a personal Christmas card list 
with names and addresses of all the people we know. It may seem late for 
this, but think of it as starting early for next year. For each address in the 
list, we'll want to store four items: the name of the person, the street ad- 
dress, the city and state, and the zip code. (If you want to talk like a com- 
puter person, you can call each line of the address a record.) 

It would be possible to set up an array and load into that the infor- 
mation on each person, one person after another. But variables lose their 
values when the computer gets turned off, and it may not be practical to 
keep the same program running year-round. Therefore, we have to find a 
way to store this information in a more permanent fashion. 

We are going to discuss three methods of permanent storage. The 
first method is the least practical but the only one possible if you are one 
of those poor benighted souls who are still saving everything on cassette 
tape. This method involves storing data inside the program itself in the 
form of data statements. You save your information by saving the 
program. 

Here's a short program that uses data statements to store informa- 
tion. This program will search through its data to find an address if you 
enter the name (or any portion of it) of the party you are interested in: 

10 HOME: INPUT "ENTER NAME OF PERSON: ";A$ 

20 RESTORE 

30 READ N$,AD$,ST$,ZIP$ 

35 IF N$ = "END" THEN 80 

40 L = LEN (N$) - LEN (A$) 

50 FOR X = 1 TO L 

60 IF A$ = MID$ (N$,X, LEN (A$)) THEN X = L: NEXT : GOTO 100 

70 NEXT: GOTO 30 

80 PRINT "NOT FOUND": GOTO 110 

100 PRINT N$: PRINT AD$: PRINT ST$: PRINT TAB (9);ZIP$ 
110 PRINT : PRINT : INPUT "ANOTHER? ";A$: IF LEFTS (A$,1) = 

"Y" THEN 10 
120 END 

130 DATA THE ALAMO, ALAMO PLAZA, "SAN ANTONIO, TX", 
78205 

140 DATA THE WHITE HOUSE, 1600 PENNSYLVANIA 

AVENUE,"WASHINGTON, DC",20500 
150 DATA BILBO BAGGINS,1 BAGSHOT ROW,HOBBITON,THE 

SHIRE 

160 DATA TOBY SACKTON,HOME FOR UNWANTED 

CHILDREN, DAR ES SALAAM,TANZANIA 
900 DATA END,END,END,END 

Let's see how this works. The first line clears the screen and then asks 
you for the name of the person you are trying to look up (actually, the 
first name alone or the last or any unique part will do, as we will see in a 
moment). Then line 20 tells your Apple that when it reads a line of data it 
should start with the first item in the first data statement. Line 30 is the 
read statement — it picks off the first four pieces of data and stores them 
in four different variables: N$, ADS, ST$, and ZIPS. 

Note that all items in the data statement are separated by commas. 
However, if we want to include a comma inside an item, we can do that 
by enclosing the whole item in quotation marks. You can see examples 
of this in lines 130 and 140. 



The next thing we want to do is compare the string that we are 
searching for with the one that is now called N$. If any part of N$ is the 
same as AS, then we have a match. 

We do this test in lines 40 through 70. To find a substring (AS) with- 
in a string (N$), we line up AS against the first part of NS and then grad- 
ually slide it to the right. Imagine, for example, that we had said we were 
looking for "White." When we get to the name "The White House," 
your Apple first compares the string "White" against "The W" — the first 
five characters in The White House. Then it checks House against each 
subsequent group of five letters until it finds a match, like this: 

The W = White? 
he Wh 
e WhI 
Whit 

White = White 

The for-next loop in lines 50 through 70 does this test. The MIDS 
statement in line 60 picks from N$ the five characters to be compared 
against AS. If it finds a match, program control jumps to line 100; other- 
wise, it goes back to line 30 to examine another data statement. 

The advantage of this kind of storage is that your data is stored right 
along with your program, and it can be saved right along with the pro- 
gram. One disadvantage is that every time you want to add, delete, or 
change a name you have to get into the program and aher it. Another 
disadvantage is that you cannot store more data than will fit in memory 
at any one time (a considerable amount, to be sure, but still a real limit- 
ing factor). 

Those of you with disk drives can get around these limitations 
through the use of text files. Text files come in two flavors — random ac- 
cess and sequential. Both are designated by the letter T in disk catalogs. 
Sequential files tend to be much more compact than random files, per- 
mitting far more names per disk. However, random access files allow 
much easier access to records than sequential files. You can modify a rec- 
ord in a random file without worrying about overwriting other records. 

Both kinds of text files are handled with the same commands. First, 
you open a file and give it a name. Then you write your data into the file, 
and, finally, you close it. If you are creating a sequential file, the data is 
packed in, one piece right behind the last, like this: 

<THE ALAMO >< ALAMO PLAZAXSAN ANTONIO, TX > 

< 78205 >< THE WHITE HOUSE >< 1600 PENNSYLVANIA 

AVENUE >< WASHINGTON, DC ><20500> 
and so on. 

The trouble with this, as we mentioned, is that if you're looking for a 
particular record you have to begin at the beginning and search your way 
through the whole file. Since each record is a different length, there is no 
easy way to jump directly to the record you want. 

Random access files take care of this problem. When you first open a 
random access file, you must specify a record length. Then, when you 
write data to the file, each record starts at an even multiple of the record 
length, like this: 



<THE ALAMO 
<ALAMO PLAZA 
<SAN ANTONIO, TX 
< 78205 

<THE WHITE HOUSE 



> 
> 
> 
> 
> 



<1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE>

<WASHINGTON, DO 
<20500> 

Because the file is organized this way, it is relatively easy to figure out 
just how many characters into the file you will have to jump in order to 
reach the address you are interested in. The disadvantage, as it's plain to 
see, is that you will waste a great deal of space on your disk saving blank 
spaces at the end of each record. In the example, each record is twenty- 
five characters long. Since zip codes are only five characters long, all zip 
code lines waste twenty characters (bytes) of space in the file. 

The easiest way to see the difference between the two text file types is 
by writing a couple of short programs and comparing them. So let's first 
write one that uses sequential files. We'll enter data into the program 
from the keyboard and save it in an array. When we've finished, we will 
press return without typing anything, and the program will take this as a 
signal to write the array out to the disk as a sequential file. 

In order to get a feel for proper programming style, we will try to give 
these programs a proper finished polish. A little additional vocabulary is 
used, so we'll dissect the programs line by line. 

First, here's the new vocabulary: 



WAIT 


ON ERR GOTO 


CHR$(4) 


GHR$(34) 


POKE 216,0 


PR#n 


OPEN file 


DELETE file 


CLOSE file 


WRITE file 



Strictly speaking, the last five commands are part of your Disk Op- 
erating System, not part of Applesoft at all. However, you need them to 
write this sort of program, so there's no point in being too much of a 
stickler about technicalities. 

Now here's the program: 

10 DIM A$(3,99):D$ = CHR$ (13) + CHR$ (4)

Take a look at line 10. We define the string D$ as a CHR$( 13) plus a 
CHR$(4). CHR$(13) is the same as a return, so what we are really doing is 
defining D$ as a control-D preceded by a return. The reason we have 
done this lies in the difference between Applesoft and the Disk Operat- 
ing System (DOS for short). As we mentioned, some commands in this 
program are not Applesoft commands at all. If they ever got to the Ap- 
plesoft interpreter in your computer, they would merely generate syntax 
error messages. Therefore, we need some way to intercept these com- 
mands in the program before Applesoft gets a chance to look at them. 

The way we do this is by printing DOS commands and by preceding 
them with the invisible control-D. Whenever an Applesoft program 
prints anything, your Apple checks the first character in the line to see if 
it is a control-D. If it is, the Apple says, "Aha! What follows will not be 
sent to the screen at all. My beloved user merely wants to speak with 
DOS." It then immediately takes whatever is printed and, instead of 
printing it on the screen, sends it off to DOS to try and puzzle out. 

The CHR$(13) part of D$ is not necessary as a rule. However, if you 
are using the get command in Applesoft, you will find that it has an un- 
fortunate propensity to swallow the first character in a subsequent print 
statement. In addition, frequent use of the semicolon to continue print- 
ing on the same line could lead to a situation where the control-D is not 
actually the leading character in a line, in which case it won't work. 

Look through the program and note which commands are preceded 
by D$. These are the DOS commands, most of which deal with text files. 
Then let's look at the rest of the program. 

The program structure is fairly traditional. Room is left for subrou- 
tines near the beginning of the program (although in a program this 
short it won't make any appreciable speed difference). Rem statements 
are used to set off the major subdivisions of the program. The main 
menu starts at line 500. The input routine is at line 1000, and the print 
routine starts at line 2000. 

After we have dimensioned thp array that we will store our addresses 
in, cleared the screen, and printed the header, we jump to the main menu. 
There we print our two principal choices — to enter names or to print 
the list — and use a get statement to accept a single character of keyboard 
input. Two if statements evaluate the response and branch to the appro- 
priate line numbers in the program. 

If we press E to enter addresses, program control jumps to line 1000. 
Line 1030 prompts the user to enter the first name on the list or to hit re- 
turn if he or she is finished entering the list. Line 1040 then jumps to the 
input subroutine at line 80. A brief inspection will show why we used this 
subroutine instead of a more straightforward input statement (which 
would, admittedly, be a whole lot less trouble).

The subroutine uses three string variables. A$ is set equal to 
CHR$(34), which (as you'll see if you look it up) is the same as a quota- 
tion mark ("). B$ is the variable that eventually becomes our output 
string. The routine starts off by loading it with a quote mark too. C$ is a 
temporary string. We use the get statement to load it with characters 
from the keyboard, one by one, examine them, and then add them to the 
end of B$. If, however, C$ comes back from the keyboard input loaded 
with a CHR$(13), then we know that the user has pressed return and is 
finished with the input, so we add a final quote mark to B$ and exit. 

What does this routine have that an input statement does not? The 
main advantage is that it permits the user to include commas in the 
string. If we tried to enter Dubuque, Iowa with an input statement, we 
would get an "?extra ignored" message, and the portion after the comma 
would be lost. (Line 84 is necessary to handle backspaces — look at it 
carefully and you can figure out how the line works.) 

Line 1040 tests B$ to see whether we entered any data. If the length of 
B$ is less than 3 (that is, just a pair of quotation marks), then control 
jumps to line 1090, which is where we create the text file. Otherwise, B$ is 
loaded into the string array A$(0,K), not to be confused with the string 
variable A$, which still contains a quotation mark. Arrays are very spe- 
cial animals and are not kept anywhere near mere variables. 

The K is our counter. It tells us which set of addresses we are 
working on. Each time we add a four-line address, the value of K is in- 
creased by 1 (in line 1080). Line 1050 loads up the other three lines of the 
address and stores them in the array. 

Once we have typed in all the names in our mailing list, we are ready 
to create the text file and save it off to disk. Lines 1090 to 1 160 do this 
like so. First line 1090 sends out a DOS command to open a file, giving it 
the file name Mailing List. Then hnes 1095 and 1100 send out the DOS 
commands to delete that file and then open the file all over again. 

This may seem a bit peculiar to the uninitiated. But the only really 
convincing way to prove that this piece of redundancy is, in fact, quite 
necessary is to delete lines 1095 and 1100 and then run the program a 
couple of times with lists of differing lengths (not too long, as you'll have 
to do them over again once the point has been made). The reason for the 
two-time opening will emerge, as they say. So go ahead and try it. 

The next DOS command is a write command. From this point on, 
anything printed via the print command will be written into the text file 
rather than printed to the screen. The only way to return to screen print- 
ing is to close the file with a DOS command, as is done in line 1 160 after 
the array has been completely written out. 

That's the end of the Enter Names main menu item. The second 
choice is Print List. This section starts at line 2000. The first thing the 
program does in this section is ask whether the list should go to the 
screen or to a printer. If you have a printer, you can send the output to 
the slot your printer card is in by inserting the DOS command PR#n, 
where n is the number of the slot (usually slot 1). 

In this program, we also set the variable P equal to 1 if output is to be 
directed to the printer. We keep track of where the output is going so 
that, if it has been directed to the screen, we can pause every few names 
so the list can be read. Otherwise, the list will whip by at a speed to defy 
even the quickest eyes. 

We do have one major problem in taking this file off the disk. That 
is, we don't know how long the file is, so we don't know how many 
names to read in. Why don't we just look at the value of K, you may ask. 
A very good question. But imagine, if you will, that after entering your 
data you turned off your Apple and went off to do something boring. 
Now you've returned and are ready to print your list. On goes the com- 
puter; in goes the program. But who was keeping track of variable val- 
ues? Not I, says the Apple; please refresh my memory. Not I, says your 
program; it's not in my contract. 

The problem is this. The loop between lines 2080 and 2100 reads in 
the data from the text file (input statements get their input from the text 
file instead of from the keyboard after a DOS read command). How- 
ever, sooner or later, your Apple is going to try to input a piece of infor- 
mation and your data file is going to be all used up. Ordinarily, at this 
point you would hear a beep, the program would break, the Applesoft 
cursor would appear on the screen, and the message "end of data" would 
sit there staring you in the face. 



A sad state of affairs. However, all is not lost. We can tell the com- 
puter that, if it finds an error, we would prefer to handle the problem 
from within the program. Look at line 2070. This line says, "If you 
should run across an error, please direct your attention to line 3000, 
which will tell you what to do." 

Line 3000 starts out with another one of those pokes that makes for 
an oversight in Applesoft. All this poke does is turn off the on err com- 
mand. After all, there are all sorts of possible error messages, and we 
don't want the program branching to line 3000 any time it feels the least 
bit cantankerous. 

Line 3000 assumes that the reason program control jumped to it was 
that you ran out of data in your address file (there is a way to check this, 
but we'll take that up another time). Therefore, it is now possible to 
know the number of addresses in the file and set K equal to that num- 
ber. Then program control is returned to Hne 2110, where we can get 
ready to print what we have read. 

If we are printing to the screen and not to the printer, Une 2130 in- 
cludes a test that will pause the program after every three names. Can 
you figure out how the test works? The pause routine itself is a subrou- 
tine that starts at line 90. The only difference between this pause routine 
and a simple get statement, which would work almost as well, is that this 
routine does not put a blinking cursor on the screen. Instead, it uses a 
very obscure and seldom used Applesoft command called wait. 

Wait tells your Apple to stop doing anything at all until something 
changes. Wait —16384,128 means, "Stop all execution until memory lo- 
cation -16384 becomes greater in value than 128." As you may remem- 
ber, — 16384 is the location of the keyboard strobe, which is set to 128 
plus the ASCII value of whatever key you press whenever you press it. 
The poke on line 94 is used to reset the keyboard strobe. 

The final line of the print routine includes the DOS command PR#0, 
which tells the computer to direct all output from then on to the screen. 

Next month, we will build a similar program using random files and 
add utilities to append names, to delete and edit entries, and to sort the 
list by last name or zip code. Hi

This time around we'll take a look at hi-res colors on the Apple. 
There are only six: black, white, green, violet, blue, and orange. Some- 
times you may hear that there are eight, but that's when you count two 
blacks and two whites. The extra black and white may be stored differ- 
ently inside, but they look alike. 

So how's it work? Some publishers of graphics utilities advertise that 
they can give you anywhere from twenty to more than a hundred colors. 
Well, what they're really doing is combining the existing six colors in 
various patterns to make it look as if there are more. It's effective. There 
are hi-res pictures done in several shades of a single color alone that look 
real nice. It's not the same as having a computer with a few hundred pure 
colors built in, but it's definitely stretching your Apple to its limits. The 





pictures in this article were created using this technique. To see how it's 
done, we can do a couple experiments. Then, compliments of Eagle 
Berns, we'll have a fairly simple machine language fill routine for you 
next issue. 

First, drag out the machine language plot routine from the Novem-

byte routine, and listing 5 showed how to enter it directly into memory.

Listing 2 created the look-up table.) Now, to fill the screen with black, all 
we have to do is put either $00 or $80 in every byte of the screen. These 
numbers give the two "different" blacks. In one, all the bits are off; and, 
in the other, all bits except the high bit (color flag) are off See figure 1 for 
this and other color patterns. 

Similarly, to fill the screen with white, you need to store $7F or $FF 
in every screen byte. Listing 1 shows a Basic routine to fill the screen with

black or white, using the plot routine and the look-up table. Note that 
the value being poked into the hi-res memory is set in line 40. Because the 
routine returns to Basic after each byte, it is slow. In fact, filling the 
screen can be done even faster directly from Basic. This way, however, 
gives you more room to experiment later. To fill the screen by drawing 
parallel lines, instead of poking values into specific bytes, see listing 2. 
And for a real quick version of these first few examples (using the pure 
Apple colors) you would more likely want to use the method in listing 3. 

Now, to get a color other than black or white, you may recall that 
only half the dots are used. Blue and violet have only the dots in the even 
columns set. Orange and green have only the dots in the odd columns 
set. Blue and orange require the high bit (color flag) to be set. Violet and 
green require that it be off. Look at figure 1 again to see the patterns.

(and listed here) with bit 0 at left and bit 6 at right. Bit 7, the color flag, is not

reversed again to convert to hexadecimal— or you can turn the page upside 
down. 

One catch is that there are only seven dots displayed per byte. That 
means that if the leftmost byte on a screen line (byte 0; even) has only bits 
0, 2, 4, and 6 set, it will show as violet (since 0, 2, 4, and 6 will fall on

screen columns 0, 2, 4, and 6). But for the next byte (byte 1), bit 0 corre- 
sponds to column 7 on the screen — an odd column. So, if the same pat- 
tern (0, 2, 4, 6) is used, that byte will show as green! (Bits 0, 2, 4, and 6 in 
that byte correspond to columns 7, 9, 11, and 13.) To continue with vio- 
let across the screen, byte 1 has to have a different pattern; bits 1 , 3, and 5 
should be set, with the others off. Moving to the right, byte 2 would go 
back to the original pattern: 0, 2, 4, and 6. Byte 3 would go back to 1, 3, 
5, and so on. 

Listing 4 uses the plot routine to put the correct byte values on the 
screen for violet. By changing the even and odd values to correspond 
with the other patterns in figure 1, you could also do green, blue, or 
orange. Of course, you could also still take the Basic shortcuts from list- 
ings 2 and 3. 

Figure 1 shows the patterns for the standard colors. You can, of 
course, make up your own patterns. Try using different numbers in list- 
ing 4. Make up some; anything from 0 to 255 is legal. The key to a good- 
looking color is a regularly repeating pattern. The next example gives 
another hint for good patterns. 

Here's where we play some tricks on your eyes. We're going to do 
different colors on alternate rows of colors. Not much explanation is 
needed; just watch what happens. Listing 5 uses the plot routine, mixing 
the colors orange and green. You can change the color patterns easily in 
the program to try others. Listing 6 does the same thing strictly in Basic 
and with only the six Apple colors. It's set up in a loop so that it will cycle 
through every combination of the six. You may even try playing with the 
color intensity control on your monitor or television. Tweaking it up 
more exaggerates the effect considerably. 

Eagle Berns has written a color fill routine and an explanation of its 
algorithm for Graphically Speaking. You'll see his work in next month's 
issue.

BV PETER OLIVIERI 




Happy New Year! Here it is, 1983. Since this is the time for making 
resolutions, let's make some for somebody else. Here are a few resolu- 
tions for the vendors of hardware and software: 

1. Be it resolved that all products offered for sale to the public will 
include thorough, readable, and error-free documentation. 

2. Be it resolved that product prices will appropriately reflect both 
the value of the product in question and the ability of the consumer to 
pay for such a product. 

3. Be it resolved that the user will be provided with backup copies of 
each product purchased. 

4. Be it resolved that we'll work diligently to make the computer 
easier to use and that we'll devise many more built-in features that 
smooth the way for the user. 

5. Be it resolved that the manufacturers of printers will make avail- 
able a letter-quahty printer that prints amazingly fast for a price under 
$1,000. 

6. Be it resolved that, when releasing a new or upgraded product, 
vendors will consider ways for people who own the earlier version to 
trade up to the newer one. 

You can probably think of many more resolutions that could be add- 
ed to this short list. But to include them all would consume an entire col- 
umn. Since it's not unrelated, however, here are a few general comments 
about things it would be nice to see in the future. 

The Apple II and the Apple III are wonderful machines, providing 
tremendous computer power to many people who may not have been 
able to take advantage of the technology before. Yet, regretably, these 
machines are not very easy to use. So-called ease of use is relative, of 
course, and certainly the Apple computers available now are easier to use 
than the earlier versions were. But, in all honesty, there's still room for 
improvement. 

Picture, for example, the situation that executives or small business 
owners face when it comes to computers. These busy people have a time- 
consuming task ahead of them. 

First, they must learn to operate a new computer. Now that's not all 
that hard if the machine comes with adequate documentation. Indeed, 
learning to use any new tool requires the investment of some time and ef- 
fort. For business people, however, the work is just beginning. Now they 
must learn to use various applications packages. 

The happiest computer users seem to be the ones who use the com- 
puter almost exclusively for a single task — word processing or spread- 
sheet analysis, for example. Where business people are concerned, the 
computer's main strength lies in its capacity to facilitate five main areas. 
These are word processing, database management, spreadsheet analysis, 
graphics, and the standard business functions (accounts payable, ac- 
counts receivable, and so on). 

Many of the software packages for these different areas can "talk" to 
one another. It may be possible, for example, to use a graphics package 
from one vendor to display a portion of the table you developed using 
another package {VisiCalc, perhaps). 

There are excellent spreadsheet packages, superb graphics packages, 
truly nice database management programs, and powerful word proces- 
sors. But it is not always easy to integrate these packages together in or- 
der to take better advantage of the computer's power. And learning to 
use even one new program can be a lot of work. 

Some software vendors have tried to do some of the work involved in in- 
tegrating the various kinds of packages. The problem is that some of the 



programs that are part of these integrated packages aren't as good as 
other similar programs that are available separately. This puts users in a 
real dilemma. 

Here are some recommendations. It's important that the computer 
be easy to use, and this implies maiu-driven programs that, indeed, may 
not even need much separate documentation. All you'd need to know 
would appear on the screen in front of you. Perhaps printed documenta- 
tion could be reserved for technical notes or examples demonstrating 
how the program works. 

This ease of use would come about in two ways. First, programs 
themselves would be easier to use. It's intriguing to envision a single pro- 
gram (at least from the user's viewpoint) that, once loaded into the ma- 
chine, would allow the user to do word processing, database manage- 
ment, spreadsheet analysis, and graphics. This would be a sort of "one- 
stop shopping" type of program. This is certainly not a thought that 
hasn't been thought before — several vendors are already working on 
such a beast. The intent of such a program would be to make the com- 
puter easier to use. And, since it's the software that makes the computer 
do what it does, an integrated program would achieve part of that goal. 

It's not only the software that needs to be improved. From the user's 
point of view, the keyboard is the single most important aspect of the 
hardware. Apple Computer's addition of up and down arrows and a nu- 
meric keypad to the Apple III keyboard were significant improvements. 

And much more can be done here. For example, a lot of letters come 
in from Business User Group members who rave about their use of word 
processing. Indeed, word processing is truly a marvel; typewriters, in the 
traditional sense, may soon be gone. And yet, word processing on a 
microcomputer is not easy. For one thing, the keyboard wasn't designed 
for word processing. On most standalone word processors, the keys are 
clearly labeled so that it is obvious which function each performs. There's 
likely to be a key labeled "delete a word," another key marked "under- 
line," and so on. 

These same handy features ought to be incorporated into the key- 
board of the microcomputer. In the short run, this could be accom- 
plished by means of stick-on labels. Or, perhaps some vendor will come 
out with a keypad that plugs into the game port and has on it only the 
word processing symbols for a particular word processing package. 

It would be nice, too, if computer vendors would design the "ulti- 
mate" keyboard. Such a keyboard would take into account the fact that 
database management, word processing, spreadsheets, and graphics were 
the major uses to which the computer was being put. The keyboard 
would be appropriately designed — perhaps it would even have two key- 
pads or interchangeable ones. The main keyboard might be much bigger 
than the ones Apples have now and might have plug-in modules. The de- 
sign is, of course, up to the person who creates and markets it. The intent 
is clear. 

These two factors — integrated software and improved keyboards — 
would enhance the ease of use of these computers tenfold. Imagine how 
great it would be if there were a button on your Apple keyboard marked 
bar chart. When pressed, this button would make the computer print, or 
ask you about, a bar chart of the data you'd been working with. It'll 
happen one day. 

One matter of some concern is what will happen to Apple II and III 
users once the hardware and software reflect the kinds of changes we've 
been talking about. Well, perhaps some imaginative entrepreneurs will 
open up Apple II Trading Posts where users can trade in their old equip-

ment much the way they would a used car. Or perhaps the newer ver- 
sions of the Apple will be priced so low that we won't care whether we 
can arrange for a trade-in. We'll just have to wait and see. 

We've rambled at great length. It really is time now to get to the busi- 
ness at hand and proceed with the column. 

Apple III Revisited. As you already know, the first version of the 
Apple III had some problems. The "new" Apple III has none of the 
problems of the original and is, in fact, an excellent machine. As was 
mentioned earlier, the Apple III keyboard was redesigned to include 
some desirable features. Now, if the ProFile hard disk that Apple Com- 
puter produces just had a more effective means for providing for backup 
of files, the Apple III would indeed be a remarkable computer system. 

The Apple Ill's only real drawback is some of the manuals that go 
with it. It's not that they're poorly written, it's just that some of the 
manuals aren't very easy for a first-time user to get through, especially 
when they start discussing such things as "device drivers" and "config- 
uring your system." This is good stuff, but it doesn't make it easy for the 
new user to get up and running. 

Some people say that when they read the Apple III manuals they 
start feeling as though they need to become programmers in order to 
understand what's being said. What they're getting at is how frustrating 
it can be when you have to learn a whole lot of new terminology before 
you can begin to use a program. 

Much that's currently included in manuals could be left unsaid. For 
many users, it's just not necessary to know everything there is to know 
about a program. One way of making things simpler would be to have 
two sets of manuals. The first set would allow the prospective business 
user to get up and running quickly without having to know a great deal 
about the inner workings of a program. The second set would be for peo- 
ple who want to "get inside" of things — to learn to perform special tasks, 
write programs, customize applications, and so on. In many cases, one 
manual just can't be all things to all people. 



The preferred Apple III business system would include an Apple III 
with built-in disk drive, a ProFile hard disk, a Monitor III, and a printer. 
Apple Computer provides manuals for each component of this system 
and also offers a variety of Apple III applications packages. We'll dis- 
cuss some of these packages now and wiU continue to review Apple III 
applications packages in future columns. 

Lots of manuals are provided with such an Apple system. The two 
main ones are the Apple III Owner's Guide and the Standard Device Driv- 
ers Manual. 

The Owner's Guide describes the Apple III in depth, explains how to 
put the system together, outlines some of the fundamental steps in- 
volved in operating the machine, and provides more detailed information 
about the machine itself. The sections on putting the machine together 
are well done and include pirtures to help the uninitiated user connect all 
of the components properly. A disk that gives a helpful demonstration of 
some of the Apple Ill's features is also provided. 

Next the manual describes SOS, the Sophisticated Operating Sys- 
tem. This system is, in many ways, comparable to CP/M. The manual 
covers such topics as file-naming conventions, selecting and identifying 
different devices that are attached to your machine, and how directories 
are set up. (While all this is very useful, it's an example of what we were 
talking about before — information that may not be needed by all users.) 

The Owner's Guide then describes the utilities disk that's supplied 
with the system. This disk allows you to work with files (to transfer, 
copy, and so on), explains how to configure your system (tell the Apple 
all the parts you are using), and discusses how to format and use disks. The 
appendices describe error messages, how to make the Apple III think it's 
a II, the specifications of the input and output ports on the back of the 
machine, and how to care for disks. 

The Standard Device Drivers Manual is a somewhat more technical 
document. It begins by describing what device drivers are. Essentially, 
device drivers are programs that communicate with the external devices 
that are connected to your Apple. When device drivers are used, a wide 
variety of equipment can be connected to the machine fairly easily. The 
manual also contains sections on using the console, with its associated 
screen control commands, and on using graphics, audio, and the RS-232 
standard interface. It is, really, a reference manual for the Apple III. 

The ProFile Owner's Manual is short but complete. As is the case 
with most manuals that are supplied with a piece of hardware, the first 
sections of the manual deal with how to install the equipment. In the case 
of this disk drive, you must install the hardware, which simply means in- 
serting a card into one of the Apple's slots, and you must install the soft- 
ware so that the Apple knows that a ProFile is attached. 

There's a very nice, though short, section on how the drive actually 
works. With the exception of a few appendices that give some operating 
characteristics and some Pascal information, that's all there is to the 
manual. The interesting thing is that not much more is needed. The Pro- 
File is extraordinarily simple to use. You don't really need a manual. 

In addition to these manuals, Apple Computer has manuals for spe- 
cific products. For example, there are two volumes on Apple Business 
Basic. If you're doing any of your own programming (or you expect to), 
you may find these books quite helpful. The same is true for the Apple 
III Pascal manual. 

Then, of course, there are the special applications packages. Next 
month we'll be looking at the support materials for VisiCalc HI, Apple 
Writer III, Business Graphics, and the Apple III mailing list program. 

Graphics. Clearly, most games are more exciting when they include 
graphics. In a similar vein, graphic presentation of business information 
c^n be more interesting. In a business setting, the most common means 
of presenting data is in the form of a table. People who need to examine 
the data, draw conclusions from it, or make decisions based on it usually 
have to wade through a lot of numbers in a table in an attempt to find 
the relationships that are important. That very same data expressed as a 
graph can make the process of finding relationships and examining them 
a good deal easier and more effective. 

In the business setting, the most common graphs are a bar chart 
(sometimes referred to as a histogram), a pie chart, and a line graph. In a 
bar chart, data is displayed on a standard two-dimensional axis, with the

height of the bars representing the magnitude of a particular number (for 
example, dollar sales in 1982). A pie diagram looks like a pie (probably 
apple). Each slice represents a percentage of the whole pie. Thus, if a pie 
chart were to be used to represent a firm's total expenses, one slice might 
be the proportion of the total that was allotted to travel. A line graph is 
simply one or more lines plotted on a graph. These are the graphs most 
people are familiar with. Line graphs do a great job of displaying growth 
trends. 

One of the nicest graphics packages we've seen is Apple II Business 
Graphics, developed by Business and Professional Software and avail- 
able through Apple Computer. The highlight of this package is how easy 
it is to use. 

Picture this: After you load the disk, a prompt symbol appears on the 
screen. If you wish to enter data, you simply type the word edit and then 
begin entering the data. Let's say you wanted to enter ten years' worth of 
data on sales. You'd type the data as follows: 

"1972", 2000 
1973,5000 
1974,10000 
1975,4000 
1976,7000 
1977,12000 
1978,9000 
1979,15000 
1980,17000 
1981,20000 
END 

When you type end, the data you've entered is stored on your disk. If 
you want a bar chart of your data, all you do is enter the command draw 
bar. Lo and behold, after a slight pause, a beautiful bar chart will be 
drawn on the screen (see photo 1). You can control the color of the bars 
and how many bars appear for each year (which makes it possible for 
you to display two or three years of data simultaneously if you want to). 
You also control the titles of the charts.

Type set title and a title can be typed on the graph. If you enter set 
vertical title, a vertical title can be entered, while typing set horizontal title 
allows you to move a title all around a graph until it's positioned exactly 
where you want it to be. (By the way, you can enter all of these com- 
mands by using only two letters. If you want to save your picture, you 
merely type save. If you'd like to see what the same data looks like in the 
form of a line graph, type draw line. And (you guessed it!), if you want to 
see a pie diagram, you simply type draw pie. It's precisely this simple 
vocabulary that makes this package so easy to use. 

Apple II Business Graphics requires an Apple II with 48K of mem- 
ory, at least two disk drives, and either a language card or a 1 6K add-on 
memory card. A color monitor is quite useful and, of course, having a 
printer allows you to make copies of your charts. The package works 
quite nicely with a variety of printers. 

The user manual is clearly written. It guides you through the develop- 
ment of several graphs as a means of teaching you how to use the pro- 
gram, which turns out to be an effective way of managing the material. 
In addition, a variety of help commands can be used. Thus, if you 
weren't sure what to do at a certain point, entering help titles would get 
you an explanation of how to use titles and their appropriate commands. 

This is the kind of package you can get started with immediately. 
With very little instruction, you can prepare graphs, display them, save 
them, and print them. And, if you wanted to use the package for more 
complex applications, you could learn to do this by studying the sections 
of the user manual that deal with more sophisticated tasks (manipulat- 
ing data, using sine functions and logarithms, using some of the math 
functions in the package to alter data, and so forth). 

Furthermore, Apple II Business Graphics "talks" to files from other 
sources. You can draw graphs from data found in various sources, 
including DOS 3.2.1 text files, DOS 3.3 text files, Pascal/Fortran text 
files, VisiCalc print files, VisiCalc DIF files, and Apple Plot data files. 

Slide Shows. As if all this weren't enough, various companion pack- 
ages can be purchased that work in combination with Apple II Business 
Graphics. One of the first you're likely to consider is Screen Director. 
Screen Director essentially enables you to be the director of your own 
slide show. The package allows you to put the pictures (graphs) you've 
created into a "slide tray" for later viewing. 

The slides in the tray are given various characteristics such as display 
time, fade-in, or flash-on. The tray can include "text screens" that you 
can create from within Screen Director. You can select from a variety of 
font sizes and colors and then create introductory or comment slides for 
inclusion in your tray. Slide shows can be set to run automatically and 
continuously, and trays can have slides added to them or taken out. 

You don't have to have Apple II Business Graphics in order to use 
this package. Screen Director will group together high-resolution graphic 
images from a variety of sources, including /i/v'^e/'/o/, VisiPlot, and The

tures are to appear. To present a group of screens, you can use either the 
keyboard (arrow keys), the game paddles, or an adapted carousel-type 
projector button to go forward or backward through your tray. 

You do need the same equipment as was mentioned earlier, includ- 
ing a language card or a 16K card, but such an addition gives your Ap- 
ple more power for a variety of chores. 

Business and Professional Software offers a wide variety of user serv- 
ices. For example, there is a Printer/ Plotter Installation Kit (PIK) avail- 
able that allows you to tie various packages to a large number of periph- 
eral devices. Furthermore, it's possible to send your slides over the tele- 
phone to the company's offices and have computer-enhanced 35mm 
slides prepared from your originals. 

B.U.G. Membership in the Business User Group continues to grow. 
Names of members have been entered into a database /mailing list pack- 
age, but don't worry; you won't be getting any junk mail from this list. It 
never leaves the office; it's for B.U.G. use only. 

We haven't yet done anything as formal as a meeting, but that may 
come someday. Right now we just share our successes and failures with 
one another and try to help each other out. If you have something to 
share or a problem you'd like solved, write to B.U.G. in care of Softalk. 
In fact, how about offering some suggestions as to what roles the B.U.G. 
might play. Could we have a collective impact on Apple? On some of the 
vendors of software we all use? 

Think before Buying. You'll recall that we've talked in this column 
about how important it is to be able to try out software before you buy it. 
Well, Robb Jacobs, a B.U.G. member who read that particular column, 
is opening a store in Bloomington, Minnesota, where people can do 
just that. 

A franchise of Softwaire Centres International (Culver City, CA), the 
store will be called The Softwaire Centre and will sell business packages, 
utihties, education packages, and entertainment programs. You'll be 
able to try out software before you buy. This means, for example, that 



you could look at, use, and ask questions about three or four different 
word processing packages in the store before deciding on which one is 
right for you. 

Trying before buying is a great idea that's well worth supporting. It 
requires some investment of time, effort, and money on the part of the 
supplier of such a service and can certainly help users out a lot. 

Help B.U.G. Out. Some readers have questions they want to ask of 
other readers. If you can help out with any of these, please send along 
your comments, noting whom they are for. Comments will be forwarded 
to the right person or mentioned as part of a column. Now for some 
questions. 

William Burkhard of Woodstock, Georgia, asks, "Has anyone had 
experience with the low-cost letter-quality printers on the market? How 
are they standing up?" 

"I need the protocol setup to allow file transfer between an IBM Dis- 
playwriter and the Apple III using Access III" says M. Ken Hockabout 
of Alameda, California. "Also, how do you send Displaywriter stuff to 
the III?" He also wonders, "What is interlacing and how does one get 
nicer screen output (nonsegmented letters)?" 

"Has anyone used ScreenWriter II in conjunction with the General 
ManagerT (Peter French of Dayton, Ohio, wants to know.) 

And John P. Schnell of West Olive, New Jersey, writes to inquire, "Is 
there any way to print superscripts using Apple Writer IIP. Subscripts are 
easy, but we find that control-V escaped followed by anything only 
prints subscripts. We would be grateful for any help on this." 

Well, this column has been a bit longer than usual this month; there 
was a lot to say. We'll just have to have a special magazine for business 
users (just kidding). Take care, everyone. Look forward to hearing from 
you and to having you back next month.

ITS UP 

Wl 




a mu niLKu 



We are only left on the ground if we choose 
to be. 

"Clear prop!" 

Nothing in sight except dirt runway, hay- 
mown fields, china-blue sky. No kids, dogs, or 
other ultralight aircraft. 

•'Clear!" 

The pilot pulls the starter rope. It doesn't 
start. He yanks it again and the sputter makes 
contact with the engine. The throttle is pushed, 
and the machine, a strange reincarnation from 
Kitty Hawk 1903, plows off, shaving the run- 
way in one smooth stroke. 

Jonathan Livingston Pterodactyl. And 
then the miracle of liftoff — little more than an 
equation, lift versus weight and thrust versus 
drag, that few people other than physicists and 
aviation experts ever completely understand. 



Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird, uh, a plane, uh. . . . Ah heck, whatever it is, it's weird. Actually, it's just ultralight guru Jack McCornack in one of his latest 
creations buzzing over the California coastline near Watsonville. Neither bird nor conventional plane, McCornack's experimental Apple-enhanced Pterodactyl 
is testimony to the recent explosion in private homebrew aviation. McCornack and others are picking up where the Wright Brothers left off, flying for the fun 
and the thrill of it. 



The mathematics works, and machine and pilot are airborne, no longer 
tied to the ground. 

These ultralight aircraft are strange birds indeed. They are engines at- 
tached to hang-gliders, motorcycles with wings, souped-up lawn- 
mowers. However these new ultralights are described, the new pilots, 
veterans of Boeing 707s, DC airglides, antique biplanes, and torn para- 
chutes, say flying an ultralight is as close as you can come to being a bird. 

And it is these same veteran pilots who confess they'd never felt ac- 
rophobia until they'd flown an ultralight. 

There's not much metal up there. From the ground, looking up a 
thousand feet, the ultralight seems as if it could be held together with 
toothpicks. But stainless steel cables, aluminum tubing, shock absorbent 
wheels, and strong dacron sailcloth-covered wings in rainbow colors 
make up a deceptively sturdy body. 

Even so, say the pilots, you are absolutely naked up there. There are 
no brakes. You don't need brakes, in theory, on something this light. 
You don't even need a pilot's license — the Federal Aviation Adminis- 
tration hasn't yet attempted to control ultralights. As for parachutes, 
nobody seems to bother; there's hardly enough room for one. 

This particular ultralight is called a Pterodactyl — the same name as 
the flying reptile that became extinct fifty million years ago. 

No brakes, no license, no parachute, and a Pterodactyl. What is there 
in this barebones aircraft to hang on to for even the least sense of 
security? 

It was designed with the help of an Apple II. 

"Computers can't do everything!" Jack McCornack, designer of the 
Pterodactyl, says loud and clear. 

Prehistoric Pilot. McCornack hovers and swoops over the field ad- 
jacent to Pterodactyl Limited, his two-year-old company by the sea in 
northern California. He lands on one wheel, spins around, and zips off 
again, sending a haze of dust floating over the small group of earthlings 
watching him with envy. 



"Jack might not look sane, but he knows exactly what he's doing," 
says fellow ultralight pilot Jim Campbell. 

Campbell is certainly quahfied to talk about sanity; he's often been 
charged with its opposite lately. Campbell and a friend, Pat Trusty, are 
planning to travel around the world by Pterodactyl, a trip they figure 
should take them about a year and a half to complete. In theory, such a 
trip is possible; the farthest their ultralights will have to fly over the ocean 
in between land on their easterly route is four hundred miles, and a gas- 
saving Pterodactyl gets forty-five miles per gallon on a ten gallon tank. 
It's called the Blue Goose Route, and it will take them over Maine, New- 
foundland, Greenland, Iceland, the Faeroe Islands, and Scotland, then 
across the English Channel to central Europe, over Siberia, and, finally, 
across the Bering Strait to Alaska. Among other things, says Campbell, 
he wants to touch a pyramid and sleep next to the Great Wall of China. 

When people buck the comfortable, common life like that, they're 
laying themselves open to a lot of criticism, and Campbell and Trusty 
have had their share. But they don't think they're missing anything. Are 
they crazy? A lot of people think so; Campbell and Trusty disagree. 

In Watsonville, California, perhaps, lies the answer. 

"Watsonville? What's that?" That's what the travel agent said, and, 
when a travel agent doesn't know, it makes you wonder. 

Watsonville is on the map. Well, on some maps. Approximately sixty 
miles south of the Silicon Valley and not quite five hundred miles north 
of Disneyland, it's there — a pinpoint. The Pacific Ocean and some of 
the most fertile agricultural land in the world surround it on the west and 
east. A nice place to drive through on your way to San Francisco, but 
rather inconsequential compared to all the booming metropolises 
nearby. 

That's what outsiders think. But the local chapter of the Friends of 
the Library won't let you forget that John Steinbeck wrote about 
Watsonville. And the chamber of commerce still remembers when The 
Dating Game sent a lucky couple here on a dream date. Not to mention

Take a good look at the picture. That's an Apple II Plus, monitor, 
disk drive, and Apple Juice power supply bolted to a wooden mount 
with foot-long bolts and protective pads. On the two-seater Pterodactyl 
pictured, the Apple sits where the passenger normally would. The con- 
trol stick for the canard and winglets is managed with the right hand 
while the pilot reaches over with the left hand to type on the keyboard. 

Jack McComack of Pterodactyl does not play games or write poetry 
or manage finances while he is soaring and swooping through the air. He 
uses the Apple, which runs off the engine with the help of the Apple 
Juice, to document test flights under different conditions. 

McCornack is continually experimenting with different designs and is 
particularly interested in the two-seater's performance during varying de- 
grees of wind turbulence. Instead of risking two people, he chooses to 
take the Apple along — and it's useful, to boot. 

The more you increase the payload of an ukralight, the more crucial 
certain factors become. McCornack is thinking about expanding the 
wingspan of the Pterodactyl and these test flights give him valuable in- 
formation to start basing designs on. The software McCornack uses is 
generally the work of his employees and students, nothing off the shelf. 

Another scheme McComack has in mind involves the use of 
ailerons, the surfaces on the outside trailing edge of the wing that con- 
trol roll. Up to this time, McCornack's Pterodactyls have been limited to 
the canard (the elevator mounted on the front of the plane) and the wing- 
lets or rudders (the control surfaces at the wingtips). These are fine if 
there is not much crosswind or turbulence. 

Ailerons on a conventional aircraft and other brands of ultralights 
provide lateral control that would come in handy on a Pterodactyl. Mc- 
Cornack is working toward a version of the two-seater in which you can 
control ailerons with a joystick hooked to the Apple. In a normal plane, 
ailerons are controlled by the stick and the rudders are controlled by foot 
pedals. 

The computer would control servo motors that activate the ailerons. 
The computer would also act like a flight instrument giving McCornack 
information on control force, effectiveness, and efficiency, avoiding the 
more traditional seat-of-the-pants decision making. 

McCornack is currently investigating navigational software written 
by a programmer in Washington. While flying, McComack can deter- 
mine the proper heading to achieve better fuel economy. He'll be able to

Watsonville is the center of apple production in California, and in 
this part of the country that means ice-cold red Delicious, sun-warmed 
golden Delicious, crunchy pippins, Mcintosh, Bellflowers, and Granny 
Smiths. 

Now it's the home of some electronic Apples and their lighter than 
air product with the Pterodactylous name. Watsonville finds itself torn 
between its wholesome, home-loving apple growers and its foolhardy, 
risk-taking Apple users. 

Jack McComack is a little bit of both. 




do what they call inflight planning, taking advantage of shortcuts. "It's 
off-the-shelf software, but you won't find it in your local computer 
store," McCornack says. 

Once again the Apple proves it's an incredibly durable machine. Both 
takeoff and landing in a Pterodactyl are bumpy, like riding a bicycle on a 
dirt road at twenty miles an hour. It's a good test of mettle even for the 
most ruggedly designed microcomputers. McCornack has had few prob- 
lems, other than the unavoidable hazards like landing and then rolling 
into a mud puddle. Needless to say, his airborne Apple may be the first 
that positively has no need for a cooling fan. 

McCornack stresses that the two-seater with the Apple is just an 
elaborate testing device for Pterodactyl's research and development de- 
partment, and he has carefully embossed the side of his flying machine 
with the label "experimental." 

In the meantime, he has something to do while he's zipping around 
the skies of Watsonville. 

"I've gotten real good at flying with one hand and typing with the 
other," McCornack boasts in his usual unimposing manner. 

Chariots of the Gouds. Although it's hard to get to know him when 
he's up there and you're down here, McComack believes in moderation. 
A balance. It's not always apparent, but it comes through at the impor- 
tant places and always on time. It's true, ultralights can be daredevil, 
hamm-scarum bucking broncos, but they can also be gazelles in motion, 
Adonis riding Pegasus, and the Lone Ranger on Silver. It's all in the way 
you take control. 

The only thing you can rely on in a one-seater model is yourself 
Take comfort in the fact that ultralights are well designed, but, as far as 
security goes, that's it. You can kill yourself in a minute.

JANUARY 1983 




Consider McCornack, the pilot who designed the thing, an ex-motor- 
cycle racer with speed still in his blood, and a philosopher "There is no 
excuse for trusting your engine to keep you alive. Figuring an average 
lifespan of seventy years, you've got less than one chance in a million of 
dropping dead in any given hour. Why hitch your life to a piece of equip- 
ment with less than a thousandth of your durability?" 

So you've got to keep your wits about you in case the engine conks 
out while you're three miles in the air. You'll come down for sure, but 
managing the aircraft sanely increases your chances of landing safely and 
walking away. 

"The basic goal of ultralight pilots," says McCornack, "is to be able 
to tell our grandchildren about it when we're old and gray and feeble. 
That means that for years and years and years while we're getting old 
and gray and feeble we can live our lives with a bang." 

Although the FAA is seriously considering changing this little loop- 
hole, present regulations state that, as long as an aircraft can be foot 
launched, a pilot's license is not required. Foot launching is possible in a 
single-seat ultralight, but you practically have to run with each foot flying 
over your shoulder — fast, huge strides — somewhat like a goose. If the 
aircraft is capable of taking off after that, you don't need a license to 
fly it. 

"Look, Ma, No License!" Pilots don't need to prove this capability 
when they buy a standard model ultralight, and, unfortunately, they 
don't need to prove any ability at all. That's why the FAA is starting to 
worry about the increasing popularity and availability of one-person 
ultralights. 

To fly a two-seater Pterodactyl, you need at least a student pilot's li- 
cense, because the planes can no longer be foot launched. And, of course, 
there are other necessary steps a pilot must take to fly in certain areas. 
Any time you enter controlled air space, you must have proper radio 
equipment for communicating with air traffic controllers. 

People are attracted to one-person ultralights because no license is re- 
quired (yet), they're not too expensive (you can take home a Pterodactyl 



for about three thousand dollars), and they're very portable (an ultra- 
light packs up easily and fits nicely atop a Volkswagen Bug). Besides all 
that, a person who has never flown before can learn to fly an ultralight in 
a week. 

"They're too easy to fly," says McCornack; "that's what makes them 
so dangerous. 

"You can learn to fly an ultralight from a book, but there really is a 
need, even for a brilliant person, to have supervision." 

What's it like learning to fly an ultralight? Imagine learning to ride a 
bicycle on extremely thin ice. Some folks say ultralight flying is vaguely 
like driving a car, once you get used to having no brakes. Occasionally, it 
takes experienced pilots the longest to master the concepts; they have to 
unlearn a lot of reactions ingrained by conventional aircraft flying. 

As in most things, an instructor is involved in the educational proc- 
ess, but the learning is done by the student and the teaching is done by 
the aircraft. McCornack has written a flight manual and developed a 
step-by-step method for learning to fly one of his Pterodactyls. A stu- 
dent starts learning as soon as she or he starts exercising judgment. 

"You can have the best instructors in the world, but those instruc- 
tors have no control over your destiny," McCornack explains. "They can 
tell you what to do and you'll agree to do it, but once the instructors step 
out of the way and the plane taxis down the runway you're on your 
Qwn." 

All ultralight aircraft are unforgiving of incompetence; but a Ptero- 
dactyl offers a lot of crash protection. 

"This sport is as dangerous as you want to make it," McCornack 
says. "In my book, a recreational aircraft should be very resistant to 
crashing. If it does crash, everything possible that could absorb energy by 
its own destruction should do so. In other words, if it does break, it 
doesn't break you." 

Twelve O'CIock High and Designing. And this is where the sit-at- 
homer, stay-at-homer part of McCornack comes into play. He designs 
these aircraft on his Apple computer, diligently, to make the most effi-

cient aircraft that will give the pilot the best possible chance in case some- 
thing goes wrong. 

The plane is designed to absorb a lot of impact. Rough field landing 
gear, aluminum tubing axles intended to bend, and wheels with extra sus- 
pension take the shock first. The pilot's lower body is surrounded by a 
cage, and the power plant structure is directly behind it for further pro- 
tection. A compression system keeps the engine intact so it doesn't break 
loose and smash into the pilot. A harness keeps the pilot inside the cage. 
McComack says a helmet is essential. 

The speed of a Pterodactyl is another built-in safety feature. At top 
speed, a Pterodactyl Fledgling can go fifty-five miles per hour, but pilots 
usually fly them at thirty-five, a healthy bicycling clip. The pilot in an ul- 
tralight has a better chance of surviving a crash than someone traveling 
in a much faster vehicle. 

The last thing McComack wants to do is soft-pedal the danger; the 
fatality rate for Pterodactyl pilots is roughly equal to that for pilots of 
conventional small airplanes. 

You can take a fifty pound bag of dog food, put it on the seat of a 
Pterodactyl, push the throttle all the way, follow it in another Ptero- 
dactyl till the first one runs out of gas, and ninety-nine times out of a 
hundred, McComack says, you'll find it sitting on its wheels without a 
scratch. 

Nine times out of a thousand you'll find the aircraft with a few bent 
parts, a wheel broken off it, and the dog food bag lying twenty feet away. 
One time out of a thousand, you'll find a heap surrounded by an acre of 
dog food. 

"A severe gust of wind or just a thermal barrier can catch it in the 
wrong place at the wrong time," shrugs McComack. "On that one time 
out of a thousand, if there's no pilot there to correct the plane's sudden 
change of altitude, just to make a simple tum . . . it's just so easy to make 
hamburger out of something." 

McCornack has investigated a few accidents in order to increase the 
safety of his own models. "As a consumer I know what I would like to 
have, and I make what I want and see if anybody else wants it." 



The computer is gradually replacing pencil and paper at Pterodactyl 
Limited. McComack designs, plans, and rearranges his ultralights on the 
Apple. 

"I use VisiCalc for this much the way business people use it for 
trends," he says, that is, to get immediate information on such things as 
what effect changing the thickness of the tubing will have on the expense 
and labor as well as the strength and weight of the aircraft. 

McCornack adds here that, by the way, he didn't invent the Ptero- 
dactyl — the Wright Brothers did. "Designing an airplane is mostly a 
matter of taking available knowledge and cataloguing and correlating it 
against possible design goals. 

"You want to have low drag, better fuel economy, more excess 
power available for speed changes and climbing, and the ability to carry 
larger payloads. One way is to increase the wingspan; but then, to bal- 
ance it out, you have to decrease the weight of the rest of the aircraft. 
When I'm trying to find the optimum wingspan for minimum drag, I 
can enter the variables into VisiCalc and see the results," McCornack 
explains. 

The Plain Truth. Not a computer expert when he started and not 
one now, McCornack has had some bad luck and some good luck with 
the Apple. On the bad side are his early dealings with a local computer 
store and his never-ending search for a good graphics program. Rarely 
has he found a package that delivers what the advertising promises. Mc- 
Cornack particularly berates the manuals that accompany several of the 
most popular graphics packages currently available, saying that they're 
great if you're as smart as the programmer. 

On the lucky side are his experiences with a digitizer, which he used 
for producing the structural diagrams in the Pterodactyl's owner manual. 
A digitized image of an assembled joint is stored in the computer and 
then printed out. A clear piece of acetate is placed over the printout and 
the parts are outlined. He can even speed up the process a tad by tracing 
the image directly off the monitor. 

McCornack and his wife Toni James also use A pple Writer for pro- 
ducing the assembly instructions in the owner manual and for writing a

quarterly newsletter for Pterodactyl owners called The Ptimes. Apples 
are also used in the business side of McCornack's company, managing 
the inventory, the mailing list, and the accounting. 

The story of Pterodactyl Limited and how it got one Apple, two 
Apples, and eventually seven Apples is an Algerlike success story — but 
not without problems. McCornack and James's main gripes are directed 
toward the computer industry in general. To understand how the prob- 
lems began, you need to visualize these two pioneers. 

Meet Jack McCornack: Pinstriped overalls, a bright T-shirt with 
"Have You Hugged Your Pterodactyl Today?" scrawled across it, and 
blue running shoes. He also has a beard, mustache, and red hair, the kind 
that would be unruly if he allowed it to get much longer. Not too many 
pretensions here, by McCornack's own admission. 

James wears the same type of clothes, but somehow on her they look 
more like a coordinated outfit. Neither is sloppy; just casual. 

Even so, the first time they walked into a computer store in a neigh- 
boring town, both McCornack and James were shunned by the 
employees. 

"Like we were a couple of hippies looking for a handout," recalls 
McCornack. 

With cash in their pockets, they were trying to buy a power supply 
for their computer and were ready to be talked into buying an Apple IIL 
But the store's employees wouldn't give them the chance, didn't even 
look at them. 

So McCornack and James left, made a lot of excuses for the store's 
behavior, and returned another day to try again. 

"But still," says McCornack, "we didn't even get to first base. Some- 
one tried to sell us a game but didn't take us seriously when we ex- 
pressed interest in buying something more comphcated." 

Snobs and Slobs. McCornack believes snobbishness still runs ram- 
pant in the computer industry. And he and James agree that it didn't 
help them get taken seriously when they informed the store that James 
was the head of the company. (McCornack does all the design work, but 
James quietly does everything else.) 

"Computer stores are going to have to get used to the fact that the 
best customers are on the leading edge of the wave of change. Custom- 
ers should be allowed to dress any way they please." 

At that point the couple could have said "forget it" and ordered their 
equipment through a catalog, but Pterodactyl wanted to establish a good 
working relationship with a retail store. 

"You're buying a lot of expertise along with that equipment and it's 
very worthwhile to expend the effort to get person-to-person contact. A 
lot of software is unintelligible unless somebody is there to help you." 

So, on their third try, they not only acceded to the store's values, they 
threw them at it — arriving purposely ostentatiously in their vintage Lotus 
1966 and wearing their most establishmentlike clothes. 

It worked. The two from Pterodactyl were waited on immediately. In 
succeeding trips, they got everything else they wanted modem, camera 
clock, digitizer, Wizardry, Zork, Cross/ire, and seven complete Apple 
systems. 

McCornack didn't see their actions as giving in. 

"Sometimes playing their game is fun. You get the fun of beating the 
system. Of course, it's a stupid system." 

And that's an important part of balance — knowing you can't be one 
way all the time. Sometimes you have to bend a little, but still, in all fair- 
ness, the bending should go for both sides. In the future, it will, and peo- 
ple like McCornack and James will do fine being themselves. 

James is excited about the future. As she sees it, our grandparents 
had a lot of changes to get used to: television, jet-powered cross-country 
flight, high-tech medicine. 

"While people older than thirty are suddenly fmding it necessary to 
get used to computers, today's children are growing up with them," 
James observes. 

"You've got to wonder what changes in technology the kids today 
are going to see in their lifetime." 

Prehistorically Modern. Pterodactyl Limited seems to qualify as a 
new-age company. There is a woman at the head of it making all the de- 
cisions, computers behind the scenes doing all the tedious work, and 
those Pterodactyls — they get high mileage per gallon of regular gasoline. 



and McCornack has started to experiment with alternative fuels. Are 
ultralights the transportation of the future? 

Most of the Pterodactyls sold are for recreational purposes, but a few 
consumers get tax write-offs when they claim them for business pur- 
poses — pulling banners and crop dusting are frequent uses — and a lot of 
new-age farmers are using them for cattle counting forays or checking on 
the wheat rust. 

McCornack hears about some new creative use for them everyday, 
but he doesn't believe ultralights will ever replace the automobile: 

"Aviation won't tolerate the sort of behavior that takes place in an 
automobile. There's no such thing as a fender-bender in aviation 
accidents." 

McCornack knows some people he wouldn't trust near an ultralight; 
to others he offers free flying lessons. "I don't want to put everybody in 
the air, but sometimes I get a strange satisfaction when I meet somebody 
who wants to do it." 



Morning dawns early in Watsonville. The big Bud Antle trucks rat- 
tle by on their way to the cold storage buildings; people with brown faces 
under straw hats are already out in the fields cutting lettuce; and a large 
group of men and women carrying empty lunch boxes are just now 
punching out at the canneries while the next shift punches in. 

It's sometime after seven at Pterodactyl. Inside, the Apple comput- 
ers are chugging out the mailing list and spitting out the inventory. Good 
computers. But let them be. Outside, the field is wet and the worms 
are out. 

It's lesson three: Taxiing, takeoff, and landing. The speed isn't much 
more than thirty miles per hour, and the plane was never more than a 
couple feet off the ground, but the burst of cool air fresh in the face and 
the thrill of seeing the ground move by underneath brings a roller coast- 
er grin to the new pilot. 

McCornack looks worried. "Wait. There's something on your 
teeth," he says.

JANUARY 1983 



In the excitement, an airborne worm landing right in the mouth is no 
big deal. Amelia Earhart probably went through all this and more when 
she was learning to fly. 

Grin and Bear It. There are definitely hazards involved in flying — 
like smiling too much. So why do people persist in doing it? 

Somewhere, sometime, you may have learned and recited out loud 
the venerable Robert Louis Stevenson poem, The Swing: 

Up in the air and over the clouds, 
Till I can see so wide, 
Rivers and trees and cattle and all. 
Over the country side. . . . 

Stevenson wrote The Swing in 1879, long before the Wright Brothers 
came along. Wouldn't it have thrilled him to ride in an ultralight! Poets, 
some say, have a different view of the world, they see different things. 
Flying in an ultralight can make anyone a poet. 

The most thrilling thing that ever happened to round-the-world pilot 
Pat Trusty was a pigeon coming 
along and flying for several miles 
right along with her. In 1979 when 
McCornack and his friend Keith 
Nicely were flying in Pterodactyls 
across the country. Nicely saw a 
couple of mountain climbers scal- 
ing the Grand Tetons. So he 
swooped down and treaded air 
while he had a conversation with 
them. It's a different world up there. 

But it's not exactly a surrealistic 
experience. Before you can even get 
off the ground in a Pterodactyl, you 
must adjust the swing seat so you 
are perfectly balanced in it accord- 
ing to your weight. (Again, this bal- 
ance — it keeps cropping up.) But, if 
you keep the equilibrium, anything 
is possible — even a takeoff — in these 
amazing flying machines that weigh 
less than most of the pilots who fly 
them. 

The High and the Flighty. Once you're up a thousand feet, you can 
start to see things more clearly or surrealistically, depending on the 
poetry you write. But you can't forget the wonder of human flight. It still 
seems impossible. 

Back to earth, McQjrnack helps make it all more real with a bit of 
aviation history and some of its surprises. "World War I messed up avia- 
tion," he says, ''really messed up aviation." 

In the early days, McCornack recounts, aircraft served no practical 
purpose; they were purely for recreation, and the developmental work on 
aviation took very creative avenues. 

"But then World War I came along and people discovered that air- 
planes were useful for killing people. After that, high-status planes were 
fast, powerful, maneuverable — all factors that made them more effi- 
cient for killing. 

"And when Johnny came marching home again after the war, the 
high-status pilot was rugged, daring, craving excitement, and cool under 
pressure — efficient for killing." 

No balance here. A shifting to one side. It was fifty years, says Mc- 
Cornack, before people were willing to risk developing aircraft solely for 
recreational purposes again. 

Other people besides the military are attracted to aircraft for danger- 
ous purposes. For instance, ultralights are very good tools, perhaps the 
best, for daredevils, says McCornack, a former daredevil himself. 

The Devil and Jack McCornack. A weekend motorcycle racer from 
not so many years back, McCornack remembers the psychology of the 
daredevil fairly clearly. 

"What daredevils want is public recognition for being braver than the 




You don't have to be an aviation expert to learn to fly a Pterodactyl; still, you 
must exercise caution and common sense. McCornack is something of a 
daredevil himself, but he's an excellent teacher emphasizing both the 
dangers and the joys of flying an ultralight. He wants to see more people in 
the air flying well-designed, reliable machines in a safe and sane manner. 



public that's recognizing them. I can't explain that attitude, even though 
at one time I had that feeling. One of the symptoms of being a daredevil 
is claiming, 'I have such high standards of courage that what you see as 
remarkable is nothing to me.' " 

But daredevils, says McCornack, are likely to be very undisciplined 
students, and he doesn't particularly want to teach them. He's more in- 
terested in giving lessons to people like fifteen-year-old Lee Raymond, 
who had to ask his mother first. 

McCornack does, however, credit his racing background with giving 
him a good awareness that sometimes things don't go as planned — a 
handy thing for all pilots to know. So at least half of the landings in his 
Pterodactyl are made with the engine shut off to simulate a forced 
landing. 

McCornack seems to take the most daredevilish type of risks now 
only when he's playing Crossfire. He may be the only player in the world 
who attempts the game with the monitor turned off. 

His high score, sans monitor, is 480. He plays by the sounds, listen- 
ing to the delays and counting the shots, and when the game is over he 

turns on the screen to see how 
he did. 

McCornack says Crossfire is the 
only thing that enables him to relax 
after his "brain drain" at work. 
"VisiCalc is useful to me as a de- 
signer, but I would have to say 
Crossfire has been a more effective 
business program." 

To some people, McCornack 
probably seems to do things in ex- 
tremes. Maybe he shouldn't go 
around calling other people dare- 
devils when he himself shuts off his 
monitor to play computer games 
and then later goes riding with the 
birds. 

But take a minute to look be- 
yond the man in the Pterodactyl, the 
big spender in his yellow Lotus, the 
coffee shop psychologist. Balance 
works in McCornack's life. He 
— knows how to construct a safe air- 
craft, how often to practice forced landings in his machine, when to quit 
work, and how to relax with a computer game. 

Then take his and James's marriage. Toni James doesn't fly — you 
don't have to fly to have a stimulating amount of risk in your life. She 
takes plenty of chances everyday with the business, and she was first to 
explore the possibility of computers at Pterodactyl. Theirs is not so much 
a well-balanced marriage as it is two well-balanced individuals who hap- 
pen to be married. In between, they manage to run a growing company 
successfully. 

McCornack and James also live in a town some people might turn up 
their noses at, but Watsonville swings like a pendulum, maintaining a 
balance that tends to be jolted in larger metropolises. 

It's this balance that's important, and calling someone else "crazy" 
because they dare to do something different is the most dangerous game 
to play. 

Adventure International. By now, Campbell and Trusty are nearly 
ready to leave on their round-the-world adventure. Again, they don't

"Kindred Spirit" in big block letters on the lower wing of the aircraft —

Gymnastics Tahe Wing 



BV ANDI^EW CHRISTIE 

Borrego Springs is a little town in the high desert country of south- 
ern California. A long, flat stretch of two-lane blacktop connects the 
town to an airfield, with a lot of desert and blue yucca in between. When 
night falls, the dim outline of the Chocolate Mountains glows purple. 
You can see every star in the sky, you can hear for a thousand miles, and 
the only thing making a sound is a single cricket. 

It's the kind of country where private pilots come to fly airplanes. On 
this night, dozens of gleaming sport planes line the length of the airstrip, 
wingtip to wingtip. The Decathlon, a monoplane, is a popular item. The 
stubby Pitts Special biplane, smaller and more powerful, is also much in 
evidence. There are a few one-of-a-kind custom-built planes here, like El 
Gato and Super Fli — owned by one man, piloted by another, and main- 
tained by someone else, like thoroughbred horses. 

They are all here for the Akrofest '82; three days of fancy flying with 



rules like an Olympiad and — this time — an Apple computer to keep ] 

score. II 

Daring Young Men. Much of the history of acrobatic flying was 

written in places like this. All of southern California once looked like b 

Borrego Springs, and it was a hotbed of technical and cultural innova- j; 

tion even when the century was young. Air-devils and inventors were j 

drawn to the area, and the combination proved fruitful. j 

, Lincoln Beachey, a man whom a lot of aviators died trying to imi- n 

tate, made his home base Dominguez Field and went there to work out b 

with his Curtiss pusher, a mass of struts and wheels with no cockpit, con- ij, 
trolled mainly by leaning to the left or right while perched between the 

wings. Orville Wright called him "the most wonderful flier I ever saw." ai 

Whenever a stunt pilot was killed, Beachey would attempt to re-create p 

the reported conditions of the fatality and find a solution. After Eugene i,; 
Ely was killed when his plane went into a flat spin, Beachey took his 

plane up and kicked it into a flat spin. The controls became unrespon- of 

sive as the plane screamed earthward, and he finally shifted his weight t|, 

and slammed the joystick and rudder against the direction of the spin, jf;

II, the workplace of the aerobatic pilot. 




Apples Keep Score 

The plane leveled off, and Beachey had discovered how to beat the 
flat spin. 

Aerobatics thrived with people like Beachey investigating what could 
be done in an airplane and gradually persuading the government and the 
infant commercial aviation establishment that there were more benefits 
inherent in the development of pilot confidence and skill than there were 
in the cheers of a carnival crowd. World War I produced a lot of new 
maneuvers, inspired by the desire of one pilot to avoid being shot down 
by another. The most successful of those pilots made livings in the twen- 
ties as barnstormers or members of air circuses. 

The air show almost died in 1945, when a spectator flying to a show 
at Flagler, Colorado, did a slow roll over the field and crashed into the 
grandstand, killing twenty-two people. The Federal Aviation Adminis- 
tration clamped down hard, and there was little organized activity in 
American private aviation for the next twenty years, a time when the rest 
of the world was building on and surpassing American achievement in 
the air. No American flier could successfully compete against the highly 
trained, government subsidized Russian and European teams at the in- 



ternational meets until Frank Price, barnstormer extraordinaire, won the 
international meet in Czechoslovakia in 1960, hiring a local to carry the 
stars and stripes onto the field. 

Price brought back something more than new hope and pride for 
American aviators. At the Czechoslovakia meet, he had noticed Euro- 
pean pilots taping up diagrams of lines, squares, triangles, circles, and ar- 
rows inside their cockpits. This was the aerocryptographic system of 
Count Jose Aresti, providing a symbolic code to tell a pilot at a glance 
which of the known eighty-seven maneuvers or their three hundred and 
fifty variations he was to perform next in his precisely choreographed 
routine. It beat trying to memorize them, or reading a script and flying at 
the same time. Price brought back to America the Aresti system and 
began the next chapter in American aerobatics. 

A Joystick Is Also a Joystick. The International Aerobatic Club de- 
fines four categories of competition. Sportsman is the general category, 
simply requiring a pilot's license and a will to learn; Intermediate re- 
quires an FAA waiver to fly below an altitude of 1,800 feet; Advanced 
requires an additional waiver to fly under 1,500 feet. Each category has a 
Known division, in which the pilot flies a set routine that has been re- 
hearsed as much as possible before the meet, and an Unknown, in 
which Aresti charts for a series of maneuvers are distributed minutes be- 
fore takeoff 

For those hopeful of breaking into the fourth and final lAC cate- 
gory, Harold Krier, winner of the 1965 U.S. Aerobatics Championship, 
provides a how-to in his handbook. Modem Aerobatics, describing the 
beginning of his routine: 

As the controls come to life, we hold the airplane on the runway a bit 
longer than usual . . . we're going to need that extra speed! Now, slight 
right-stick ... the left wheel leaves the runway, and then the right one. 
Back slightly on the stick, with a little rudder — and watch the right lower 
wingtip as it clears the runway. ... As we roll past vertical, feed in slight 
forward stick and, at the twenty-foot level, we are in inverted flight. You 
may be fairly sure everyone is watching now! 

Flying upside down twenty feet off the ground on takeoff is a ma- 
neuver that requires a special FAA waiver allowing one to fly in aero- 
batic meets in what is known as the Unlimited category — which is just 
what it sounds like. 

The pilots at Akrofest '82 are a mix. Half of them work in nonavia- 
tion professions that allow them the economic wherewithal to purchase 
and maintain their own aircraft, and half of them are crop dusters and 
full-time commercial pilots. Jim Neal is a dentist. Bridget St. Thalle is a 
computer programmer. Chief contest judge Bob Porter flew AV-lOA 
Broncos as a caigo-drop specialist in Vietnam and more recently took a 
team of four Pitts Specials to South Africa for an air show. (En route, fly- 
ing cross country, the map flew out of the cockpit and Porter had to buzz 
down to check the road signs.) All of them are here for one reason. They 
agree to act as judges for each other's flights; they mark off "the box," a 
300-square-yard area within which pilots must perform all maneuvers; 
they arise at dawn for the briefing on each day's flight, and, in fine, give 
up days of work for minutes in the air. 

And, before the Apple blew in, it took a lot longer. 

A Happy Confluence. Bill Cornick's red windbreaker is laterally bi- 
sected by a row of patches designating chronologically his category 
standings, from Sportsman to Unlimited. Cornick is a pilot with United 
Airlines and is active in most Western division meets. His co-worker. 
Chuck Rigsby, would like to be but hasn't found the time. 

Sitting around with a few beers one night, Cornick mentions that the 
most fatiguing part of the meets used to come after all the flights had 
been flown, all the judging had been done, and all the scores were in. 
Then two or three people got to sit around in a motel room with hand 
calculators until three o'clock the following morning, figuring out how 
everyone did. Wouldn't it be neat if they had a calculator that could do 
this stuff" faster than the hand calculators? 

Well, yes. Rigsby had just bought an Apple and had several degrees 
in statistical analysis and related fields. He got into Apple's little books 
and went as far as they would take him. He bought some more detailed 
texts and learned about sorting and error routines. He read programs, fig- 
ured out what they did, and adapted them. After three months of Apple- 
soft self-taught, he wrote a simple high-low program — throwing out the 
high and low in each group of scores and giving the average. 



134 



s n r T A I 1^ 



JANUARY 1983 



The program grew in complexity as Rigsby decided to give it the abil- 
ity to print out; then Bill Cornick came around again and mentioned the 
Bauer-Terrasov model, using averages and standard deviation to nor- 
malize scores. It preserves the scoring of the judge who may score higher 
or lower than the average but does so consistently, while detecting judges 
who pick the wrong order of finish but stay in a midrange. The math re- 
quired to normalize scores, with the end result of the same score as- 
signed to the same maneuver by each of five judges, would take two days 
on a hand calculator. When Rigsby had his program completed, it could 
keep track of all judges' raw scores, reenter all data in the event of a crash 
(computer variety), and have all results printed out fifteen minutes after 
the last pilot landed. 

Making It Fly. Enter Larry Lowe, the man who provided the 
Apple /videodisc interface for the America's Electric Energy exhibit at 
the Knoxville World's Fair. When he's not exploring the Apple's visual 
potential, Larry Lowe is flying airplanes in the Unlimited category, or 
thinking about flying airplanes, or hanging out a lot with people who 
love to fly airplanes, or tinkering with the disassembled carcass of his 
customized Piper Club so he can spend more time flying airplanes. It's 
been three years since he flew his Cub from Arizona to Southern Cali- 
fornia and took it apart. Putting it back together has proven to be 
another matter entirely . . . "But hey, the longer you wait, the more sexy 
it's going to be." 

As a member of the San Diego chapter of the International Acrobat- 
ic Club, he was the obvious choice to customize Rigsby's high-low scor- 
ing system to the club's needs. Rigsby mailed in his disk and Lowe 
tweaked it, renumbered it, and mailed back a copy of his version. (Rigs- 
by donated the Bauer program to the Aerobatic Foundation.) All was in 
readiness. 

Gentlemen, Start Your Engines. An early morning overcast will give 
good silhouettes to the planes, an aid to judging. The judges are lined up 
on the yucca flats behind the airfield terminal in a line on the center of 
the box. They are in five groups of three; caller, judge, and recorder. Jim 
Neal is calling for number 5 judge Bill Mclntyre, with Larry Lowe kibitz-

ing until enough scores can be collected to start entering data. Waiting 
for the first flight of the second day, Mclntyre is in a reminiscing mood. 
He and Larry Lowe flew in air circuses together in Arizona, once flying 
to Texas just to hear aviation legend Charlie Hillard talk about flying. 

Mclntyre declaims to the desert air. "The first time I ever flew up- 
side-down was with Larry. I'm in the back seat; the plane has these skin- 
ny little stock belts. He says, 'Are you ready?' I say 'Yeah,' and he rolls it 
to the inverted . . . and there I am, looking out the cockpit bubble at the 
Beeline Highway running from Mesa, Arizona, up to Payson. I'm hang- 
ing there, looking up at the ground and looking back down, and think- 
ing, 'This seat belt is not gonna help. There is no way that a thousandth of 
an inch of plexiglass is going to keep me in here if this little thing doesn't 
stay latched. . . .' Larry's saying, 'You like it? You see the attitude?' and 
I'm going, 'Uh. . . .' " 

"Yeah," drawls Jim Neal, "Larry scares me, and I'm fearless." 

There is a consensus that aerobatic sequences are getting tougher, as 
in any professional sport. A copy of the original Aresti manual shows the 
Unlimited Freestyle competitions from the world meets of the sixties; 
they look like current Advanced Free. "I looked at the 1977 Unlimited 
Known, and I could fly that in my airplane," says Neal. "It wouldn't be 
easy but I could do it. I couldn't touch this year's." 

The planes start coming into the box. Mclntyre holds up a drafts- 
man's triangle and a pencil to check their angle. A pilot "draws a line," 
establishing a direction straight up and pulling back on the stick until the 
nose is up, pointing the airplane, and holding the position. It should be a 
45 degree line. If it is 40 degrees, the pilot receives one point off his score; 
two points off if it is 35 degrees, and so on. 

Jim Neal calls out the intended maneuvers from an Aresti diagram. 

"Center-box slow roll to inverted . . . other end, reverse half-Cuban 
. . . slow roll center-box . . . hammerhead . . . center-box four-point . . . 
1 80 degree turn . . . double slow roll center-box; half roll to upright. . . ." 

Mclntyre punctuates the calls with his commentary for transcription 
on each maneuver. 

"Roll was late going up, early coming down: eight. Slight barrel in 
the roll: nine. Tucking. . . ." 

Everyone admires the moxie of an Intermediate pilot named Brown 
who executes an outside loop to a hammerhead roll in a Decathlon — a 
maneuver usually attempted in the more powerful Pitts Special or a cus- 
tomized plane. It is not done that well, but the judges are impressed that 
it. should be done at all. "We're seeing some wild sequences out here in 
Intermediate today," Neal comments approvingly. 

Meanwhile, the runners are taking the score sheets of the five judges 
to Larry Lowe in the scoring room. Aided by a Centronics printer, nu- 
meric keypad, and a Practical Peripherals Microbuffer II allowing for 
data entry and printing simultaneously. Chuck Rigsby's high-low pro- 
gram acts as final arbiter. Sue Porter, having just flown a sequence her- 
self, enters the numbers into the Apple as Lowe calls them off. 

The score sheets for her own sequence come up, and she sees a lot of 
disappointing sixes and sevens. Was it her climbing snap? She looks 
closer. No, it was her positioning.

DOUBLE CHECK 
THE BACK-OFFICE BALANCER 

At first people laughed. "Are you kidding. The 
Apple market's flooded with checkbook balancers." 

Yes, it's true. There are at least six balancers for 
the Apple. But until Double Check, no one 
designed a balancer just for professional offices, 
small business, and personal computer users. 

THE STORY BEHIND THE PROGRAM 

I'm Bob Payne, co-creator of Double Check. 
When I bought my Apple last year, I wanted it to 
do some rather simple-minded tasks. You see, I 
own a small commercial building. I figured my 
Apple could keep an eye on rents, maintenance 
accounts, and property taxes. These data should 
flow from checkbook balancing on the computer. 

In addition, I wanted the computer to record 
commodity purchases; keep me up-to-date on 
income taxes; and make an informal budget of 
personal income and spending. It would be easy, I 
thought, to get a checkbook program to do the 
job. 

But I was wrong. In frustration, I went through a 
slew of programs. First I tried a popular home 
money manager, then Apple's own balancer, and 
finally "The Complete Home Financial Package" 
selling for $39.95. 

What did I get for all this effort and money? A 
maze of complex budget programs, a tangle of 
computer jargon, useless graphics, and pages of 
fouled-up documentation. Worse than that, no 
one offered to refund my money when these 
programs didn't deliver as promised. 

I GOT MAD! 

Then I got mad. "What the hell," I said, "I can 
do better than this." So I set to work 
programming, but quickly fell flat on my face. 
Programming isn't my bag. 

Finally I met Don Hill, an up-and-coming game 
programmer and the creator of Blackjack Vegas 
Style. Don and I set about reviewing all the money 
managers on the market. 

The need was clear: an easy-to-use balancer 
with "sort-by-category" capability. Don created 
the basic program then added some bells and 
whistles: 100 user-defined categories, machine 
language speed, plus an on-screen category 
dictionary. He even gave it "edit anything, 
anytime" capability. 

More: his program also generates seven Pre- 
formatted reports: a code dictionary, checks by 
category, checks by date, grand totals, uncleared 
checks, and more. It prints reports or displays 
them on the screen. So you don't need a printer to 
use the program. 

As to balancing, the program displays a 
facsimile of your checkbook. You see 17 items per 
screen, and can scroll for more. It's a 
computerized replica of your checkbook. 
Balancing is easy because errors appear 
immediately. 



SMART CUSTOMERS 

We figured such a program would be a natural 
for professional offices, home use, and small 
businesses. 

So that's how it came about. But since putting it 
on the market, we find that our customers are 
smarter than we are. They are finding all kinds of 
new uses for Double Check. ..uses we didn't think 
of. For example: 

One Double Check user creates "budgets with 
actuals" by entering dummy amounts to each 
category. As checks (or deposits) are entered, the 
category totals increase or decrease. The balance 
is the "over/ under" budget amount. 

A local investor uses Double Check to watch 
credit card accounts, to control petty cash, and to 
manage asset accounts. A lawyer in Orlando, 
Florida used it to control his trust account. A 
doctor in South Carolina uses it to separate 
income in his medical partnership. A school 
district in Indiana uses it to track expenses by 
department. 

More than that, one San Francisco businessman 
uses it as a mini-accounts receivable. He simply 
enters invoice numbers in place of check numbers 
and tracks payments received. In this mode, it 
gives him a list of "aged accounts receivables". He 
didn't need to learn another program to do it, 
either. 

SAVE BIG MONEY 

Double Check can pay for itself ten times over 
by saving the cost of organizing and totaling data. 
As a one user put it: "Why pay a $100-an-hour 
accountant to count beans?" 

But the best use for Double Check is tracking 
tax items (which makes it tax deductible). This 
allows mid-year tax planning. Just press the 
proper keys and see current income, deductions, 
and tax credits. One customer said, "Hey a mid- 
November planning session with your CPA is 
worth ten times more than those April tax 
reviews". 

So, Double Check is a meat-and-potatoes 
bankbook balancer that does high level accounting 
and tax work. No complex budget features. No 
graphics. No check writers. 

It's just plain vanilla. But what it does, it does 
very well indeed: oh yes, the documentation is in 
plain english...no computer jargon.

ENGLISH BUTLER 

The program will never trap you; nor will it 
"crash". It's polite as an English butler. It says 
"Please" and "Thank you." It has loads of 
reminders, and even tells you what's wrong when 
you goof. (Example: try running it with the drive 
door open and see the neat little message) 

Unlike other balancers on the market, there are 
no monthly closings to worry about; no "cut off 
dates". Better yet, you can split checks or 
deposits between codes. ..a very handy 
accounting tool. 




Seven ready-to-print reports: code dictionary, 
cleared and uncleared checks, lists by category, 
grand totals, and more. 

MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS 

The program allows multiple accounts. It will 
manage all your checking accounts. Even Apple's 
Personal Finance Manager can't do that. 

Reconciliation is a snap: just enter the numbers 
of checks returned by the bank, and instantly the 
computer displays the date, payee, code, and 
amount for verification. You can enter numbers in 
any order. No need to sort checks, either. 

The program is copy protected. Back up disk $20. 

Here's how we market it. We sell directly to you. 
You get a money back guarantee. If you don't like 
it, we'll give you a prompt, courteous refund. (So 
far we are running one-in-forty returned.)

APPLE 
FLEDGLINGS 

Rubye Bushey became involved in video productions in 1977, assist- 
ing a Newhall, California, cable firm in the production of a half-hour 
weekly show on local events. At the same time, Rubye's husband Bob, a 
former Air Force pilot and flight ground instructor, currently a com- 
mercial jet captain, was sent to school by his airline to learn about iner- 
tial navigation, a revolutionary computer-controlled navigation system. 
Soon thereafter, he became involved with microcomputers, and his con- 
tagious interest soon spread through his family. Bob purchased an Apple 
II Plus, father and son attended computer classes, and all soon decided to 
pool their respective abilities in a single enterprise. 

Avion Video Computers of Newhall was founded in February of 
1982 by Bob and Rubye Bushey with the idea of providing instruction in 
the operation of the Apple II Plus and pilot ground school training. Bob 
Jr. became primary instructor in the computer classes for ten-year-olds 
to fourteen-year-olds. It was quidcfy perceived that adults, though in- 
terested in the courses, could not easily schedule the time to attend, and 
the Busheys put their classroom courses on videotape. 

Designed to allow students to work at home or at the local flight 
training center at their own pace, the AVC series of instructional video- 
tai3es on "Preparing for the Private Pilot Written and Oral Examina- 
tion" uses the E-Z Draw program and shape tables for text, pictures, and 
graphs, combined with live action scenes. The course covers navigation. 

One judge has given her all nines. "Now there's an honest fellow," 
she smiles. 

The screen prompts with "pilot maneuver?" "# maneuvers?" and 
"K-factor each?" (the point value of the maneuver, depending on diffi- 
culty). The degree of difficulty is multiplied by coefficient X; in the 
Known sequences, the number of maneuvers and K-factor are entered 
automatically and the corresponding scores are read off

Lowe. "One reads off, one types, and one watches the screen and listens 
to the reader. With two people, you always have to be checking your 
input." 

Hour of Decision. The pilots land, park their planes, and make their 
way to the scoring room, outside of which the printed evaluations of 
their efforts are tacked to the wall. 

They can now argue about the scores almost a full day sooner than 
usual. 

"I got okay scores; some nines, some nine-fives; maybe one eight- 
five. . . ." 

"They're accepting the entry as a fact of life and just looking for 
recovery. . . ." 

"Not only is that hard to find in the nineties, what I'm doing is 
breaking that down to thirty-degree intervals. The first was pretty good, 
the second slowed down a bit. . . ." 

"I watched the entry into the box. You were one point off and then 
you capped it. Good scores on the tail slide; you held it right straight up 
and then you cheated a little. . . ." 

"I just wanted the longest hammer I could get out of the thing. . . ." 

"How was the pitching? Was there a lot of pitching? I feel I can't do a 
lot about it. If all you were looking for was a deviation in roll or 
turn. . . ." 

"You see the new kid coming up?" 

"He's shaggy." 

"What was the story with McCorkle's spinner coming off?" 
Ernest K. Gann, author of The High and the Mighty and an old mail 
pilot, has written a few thoughtful words on the subject. 

Once the sensual pleasure of controlling an aircraft is mastered, 
exhilaration diminishes and incurable habit takes command. Once the se- 
cretly nursed conviction that something dangerous and dramatic might 
happen — with yourself as hero or victim — is forgotten, then the heart joins 
the mind in submission to the necromancy of flight. Pilots who have flown 
for fifty years are unable to shake it — whatever it is. 

The next morning, the judges are back in a line on the field for the 
final sequences. Jerry Boughner is the first pilot up, the snarling roar of 
his red, white, and blue Skybolt rising in pitch and booming across the 
desert floor as his ship dives down through the overcast. 

Jim Neal, whose flight time is logged in thousands of hours, leans 
back in his folding chair and grins. 

"Hey, doesn't that just make the neatest sound?"

Unless otherwise noted, all products can be assumed to run on either Apple

ROM Applesoft can be met by RAM Applesoft in a language card. Many 
Apple II programs will run on the Apple III in the emulator mode. 

Ultima II. By Lord British. Hooray! Hooray! Ultima 11 is actually, 
finally out! And the wait was worthwhile. Ultima II is light-years ahead 
of Ultima in graphics and plot. It also is a lot more fun to play. 

Lord British has mastered machine language at long last, and this 
program sparkles with speed and superb graphics. The waters of the 
oceans move in wavelike motion. The towns, villages, and castles have 
been expanded to many screenfuls of hi-res detail. 

The game occupies three disk sides this time instead of two, but very 
little disk switching is required. One disk is the program disk. Another is 
the master player disk, from which you generate the disk on which your 
character is generated and stored. The third is the galactic disk; like the 
original Ultima, part of this game takes place in the far-flung future in 
space. This time, though, space travel is much more interesting than the 
quasi-arcade shoot-'em-ups of the first one. Now there is the entire solar 
system to explore, planet by planet. Each planet is a separate hi-res world 
just waiting for an intrepid explorer to set foot on it. Most planets con- 
tain mysterious places and inhabitants to tell you dark secrets; and you'll 
find some of the most bizarre dungeons you've ever tried to map. 

Not that things aren't wondrous on Earth. Lord British uses the 
fabulous shimmering time doors a la Time Bandits. Five eras are avail- 
able through shifting travel routes. Among these is the mythical time of 
legends. Each era has unique locations and inhabitants to aid or hinder 
you. You must take the time to talk to everyone in the game; you may 
miss important clues and aids otherwise. Besides, Lord British added a 
fun feature to this game by scattering among its population well-known 
people from the microcomputer industry. Each of these characters has 
something relevant to say about themselves or the game. It's a challenge 
to see'if you can find and identify these people. 

The story, subtitled "The Revenge of the Enchantress," revolves 
around your search for Mondain's evil apprentice Minax. Mondain was 
the evil wizard you destroyed long ago if you won Ultima I. His appren- 
tice has surpassed him, having succeeded in destroying the world of the 
future. Your task is to gather together all the special weapons and magic 
items needed, travel to Minax's heavily guarded castle, and there find the 
way to destroy her. 

Once again, the choice of what type of character (race, class, and at- 
tributes) you'll be is up to you. It has been whispered that clerics have 
more fun, but no one seems to be able to figure out just what kind of fun 
that might be. It's your responsibility to help your character grow and 
develop and, of course, to survive. 

A very nice feature is that the game automatically saves at various 
points in your wanderings. So, if you suddenly do something that turns 
out to be fatal, you don't have to begin all over again. Upon rebooting, 
you start off at the last saved game position. Incidentally, the save takes 
place on the player disk. Since each person playing must have a copy of 
the master player disk for storing a character, members of a family can 
be saved at different points. 

Sierra On-Line's publishing of this product has certainly enhanced it. 
The merchandising alone is worthy of an award. The box is a beautiful . 
rendition of the advertisement they have been using for the game. The 
manual is fun to read. The most delightful detail, though, is a large, full- 
color cloth map that depicts the earth and shows the placement and 
paths of each of the shifting time gates. The map is beautifully done in el- 
fin runes and temporal symbols. 



Ultima II is a universe of enchantment and challenge that draws you 
deeper into its unique spell with each playing. It will provide many hours, 
possibly months, of delight and enjoyment. 

The winds of time whistle softly . . . Ultima IW Perhaps. Who knows 
what the multitalented Lord British will choose to do next. rra

Data*Trans. By Mingche M. Li. With the wealth of modem communi- 
cations packages available today, it is very difficult for a new pack- 
age to be innovative. Rarely do any of the programs address the more ac- 
tive uses of telecommunications, such as bulletin board or Source appli- 
cations. Instead, they appear to be aimed at the passive user who wants 
to download a fixed file, upload a prepared text, or transfer some Visi- 
Calc data. 

Data*Trans, rising like a phoenix after many years of development 
by the giant government think tank, ABT Associates, is just such an in- 
novative program. This is certainly one of the most versatile telecommu- 
nications packages to date. It allows the Apple to interface with main- 
frames, minis, and micros. 

Data*Trans handles all aspects of electronic mail, such as unlimited 
autodialing and autolog-on files and remote control of your Apple. It lets 
you run, load, list, write, save, and, of course, transfer any Applesoft pro- 
grams to another unattended Apple. Here is really intelligent terminal 
power. You have the ability to print and copy data simultaneously as it is 
downloaded. 

One of Data*Trans's most useful features is the ability to work with 
and edit text files while on-line. This is very important to those involved 
with serious frontier modem communications, especially those working 
in a conference tree. Text files can be created, printed, and transferred ef- 
fortlessly via this system from either the 20K buffer or disk. Any disk can 
be catalogued while on-line also, in case you have forgotten what data 
was on which disk. A very nice touch is that the program automatically 
varies the speed of transmission to mesh with the fluctuating response 
time of the receiving database. 

Data*Trans also handles the transfer of VisiCalc DIP files (likewise 
DB Master DIP files). The program goes one more giant step forward 
with its ability to create the DIP files itself out of raw data. Until now, 
only one other program on the market could accomplish this, but it has 
very limited functions and only works at 300 baud. 

All in all, this is a very impressive package that's easy to use and thor- 
oughly documented. If you're shopping for software to use with the new 
modem you got for Christmas, Data*Trans looks like a good place to 
start. m

Jawbreaker II. By Chuckles. Who are they trying to kid? This may be 
the official Jawbreaker, but it doesn't look like the Jawbreaker that's rat- 
tled around the Apple market for the past year. As a matter of fact, it's 
not. It's an entirely new game under an old name. 

Sierra On-Line seems to be having name difficulties these days. They 
changed Gobbler to Jawbreaker. They changed the name of their com- 
pany. They changed the name of their word processor two times. At that 
point they must have figured that all the good names were taken. 

They put out a program named Frogger that should have carried the 
legend "Any resemblance to other programs, living or dead, is purely 
coincidental." 

Now comes a new version of Jawbreaker that deserves the same dis- 
claimer. As noted above. Jawbreaker stemmed from Gobbler. And even 
the unwashed could see that Gobbler had Pac-Man as an inspiration.

But Jawbreaker II is as new, as original, and as enjoyable as any ar- 
cade product to come down the pike in some time. It's an eat-'em-up, but 
not in a maze. The playing field more resembles Apple Panic or Cannon- 
ball Blitz than it does Pac-Man. 

Chuckles's first program for Sierra On-Line was Laf Pak, which was 
greeted by massive indifference in the marketplace. But Jawbreaker II, 
with its smooth animation, vibrant colors, and responsive controls, 
should establish him as a programmer to follow in his future endeavors. 

Be not confused by the name. Jawbreaker II is new, fun, and differ- 
ent. In the morass of arcade games, it should rise to the top. ART

Chess 7.0. By Larry Atkin. Odesta claims this to be the definitive micro- 
computer version. Such lack of modesty immediately alerts potential 
buyers to be especially critical to see what all the bravado is about. 

What it's about in Chess 7.0 is by far the most thorough implemen- 
tation of the ancient strategy game on the microcomputer. It's not the de- 
finitive one — all chess buffs will find something to gripe about — but it's 
hard to believe that anyone else will care enough to do their very best. 

This package exudes love of the game and care in its implementa- 
tion. From the nifty manual that all too briefly summarizes playing strat- 
egies to a collection of saved games and problems that highlight the de- 
lights of chess, this program is meant for the chess aficionado. 

In fact, if it's still possible for strategy games to sell computers. Chess 
7.0 will sell Apples. 

The best thing about Chess 7.0 is that it plays a good game without 
a long delay to think things through. That combines the best of its 
predecessors. Microchess played a lousy game, but played quickly. Sar- 
gon played a good game, but took all night to do it. 

Even at its simple levels. Chess 7.0 is a respectable opponent. It rec- 
ognizes all relatively standard openings and plays a solid, and sometimes 
spectacular, middle game. 

But what sets this program apart is its combativeness in the end

game. Right down to the mainframe diess programs that vie in highly 
publicized chess tournaments for the title of electronic king of the chess 
board, computer programs have been notorious for their poor perfor- 
mance in the end game. 

Chess 7.0 seems to break new ground in that regard. Even when suf- 
fering great material disadvantage, the program will exploit any misstep 
its human opponent might make. No chance here to take a breather 
when you're a rook ahead in the end game. 

The package includes abnost everything any chess player might have 
dreamed about. Among its features is keyboard cursor control. You 
don't have to know whether the computer understands European or 
American chess notation to play; just use the cursor to indicate which 
piece to move and where to put it. 

As the microcomputer infiltrates new areas of society, it's not clear 
that the newer owners are settling back with it for contemplative games. 
Mostly, they seem to be buying Uie games that provide instant gratifica- 
tion from a quick decision. 

But, for those who like to confront the silicon-implanted machine in 
thoughtful battle. Chess 7.0 vvill be a godsend. ART

Bumble Plot. By Leslie Grimm. Bumble Plot is a series of five number 
games designed to teach children of ages eight through twelve the funda- 
mentals of number lines, negative numbers, graph plotting, and comput- 
er graphics. 

This program is a good example of what educational researchers call 
a learning hierarchy. Its five games are presented in order of increasing 
complexity. Trap and Guess, the first game on the menu Usting, asks the 
child to trap a number that's being kept secret by the computer, using 
first a horizontal and then a vertical number line to limit the range of 
possible guesses. (The total number of possible choices on both horizon- 
tal and vertical number lines is seven, from —3 to 3.) 

Bumblebug, the next game in the listing, combines the horizontal and 
vertical lines from Trap and Guess to form a grid and asks the child to 
surround the Bumblebug with traps located on the grid points. 

Hidden Treasure adds the notion of X and Y coordinate axes. The 
child must describe the hidden treasure's position by specifying its X,Y 
coordinates. Word and arrow clues are used to promote the understand- 
ing of coordinate systems while helping to locate the treasure. 

Bumble Art reinforces the concepts learned in the previous three 
games. The child is asked to invent and draw pictures and to cany out 
drawing instructions supplied by the program. 

Finally, Roadblock puts the child in charge of an entire police force in 
hot pursuit of an escaped bank robber. This game makes full use of the 
concepts learned in the previous four games; the child must erect road- 
blocks across each of the robber's potential routes of escape. 

In a day and age when many twelve-year-olds are doing complex 
computer graphics, some children may find Bumble Plot too simple. But 
children who don't have much experience with computers or with plot- 
ting graphs may find Bumble Plot just the thing to get them started. It 
can also give younger childrai a head start in learning number concepts. 

Bumble Plot offers a choice of sound or silence and comes with in- 
structions and a backup-disk certificate. PC

Miner 2049er. By Mike Livesay and Bill Hogue. If a modern day Nice- 
ly Nicely had wandered through the microcomputer community recent- 
ly wanting to bet on Micro Lab's Micro Fun division coming up with a 
bestseller-caliber game within the next few months, few in the industry 
wouldn't have given him high odds. 

The laugh would have been on all of us as we coughed up the cash to 
make Nicely Nicely a rich man. Because he would have won. Micro 
Fun's new game. Miner 2049er, is every bit bound to be a hit. 

You'll think it's from Sirius. No, On-Line. Maybe even Broderbund. 
That's how it looks and that's how it plays — super and well. From Mi- 
cro Lab? Sure as hell. 

Miner 2049er has every element of a Top Ten home arcade, includ- 
ing that of cohesion; all the elements integrate smoothly and right. Ev- 
erything works. 



142 



JANUARY 1983 



There are bits of business that might recall other games; but no rip- 
off here — the pieces come together in a way that's new and fresh, chal- 
lenging and addictive; and delightful. To say Miner 2049er is based on 
another game would be like saying an apple pie is based on a stick of cin- 
namon. 

To begin with, there are not one or three or even five variations on 
the first screen, all to be repeated at a faster pace when you've mastered 
the lot. Miner 2049er has ten very different screens, each with its own 
unique challenges; and, when you've mastered them all (whew!), the 
challenge is to do it all more efficiently, for higher points. You learn to go 
faster; it doesn't. 

Bright, clean, sassy hi-res animated graphics provide the milieu of ob- 
stacles a happy little miner must overcome in his resolute determination 
to solidify ihe mine floor and, wherever necessary, to rid the mine of lazy, 
dangerous mutants. 

Only when he's in possession of a tiny rainbow-striped apple are the 
mutants vulnerable; otherwise, running into them is fatal. Mutants mind- 
lessly patrol out-of-the-way, difficult-to-reach places; they don't attack or 
give chase, but they don't give in either. The effect of the apples lasts a 
very short time, and the apples often seem to be located in spots that 
aren't the least helpful. The little miner must grab an apple and do in a 
mutant or two; how to do it offers several tactical challenges per screen — 
delightfully fun and very difficult to figure out. On some higher levels, no 
apples appear; then it's time for leapfrog — uh, leapmutant. 

In the beginning there are ramps and ladders; then chutes join in — 
and elevators and hydraulic lifts and many surprises. Deeper in the mine, 
you wish there were ladders: jumping among isolated ledges can be very 
dangerous. There are even moving ledges you must time your jumps to. 

The flavor is reminiscent of Apple Panic, with much more variety and 
much more strategy. There is a touch of Cannonball Blitz, but, where 
Cannonball became frustrating. Miner succumbs to logical solution as 
well as practice. And, in the triggering of vulnerability through touching 
a particular item, there's a tip of the hat to the multitude of Pac-Men; 
but, rather than being an end in itself, here this M.O. serves a larger 
purpose. 

When things go right, they go very right. Miner 2049er requires a joy- 
stick, and Livesay has found a way to make the joystick palatable and 
even friendly to those who hate them animals. You get to calibrate the 
game to your joystick — taming the instrument to work perfectly and eas- 
ily, even for joystick-klutzes like this reviewer. 

If you ever enjoy arcade games, you're bound to be hooked on Miner 
2049er. Forget who published it until you've played it; then help wel- 
come Micro Fun into Top Ten territory. 

Micro Lab prez Stan Goldberg doesn't look much like Nicely Nice- 
ly; but he's been willing to bet on Micro Fun's product for a long time. 
On this outing, he'll collect. He's on a sure winner. t1(T

Aztec. By Paul Stephenson. After the Aztec empire crumbled, legend 
had it that a golden idol was somewhere in the lost temple. Only a few 
people believed the legend and archaeologist Professor Von Foerster was 
one of them. Foerster located the temple and went in search of the gold- 
en idol. He was never seen again. 

Through extensive research, you have tracked the route to the tem- 
ple. To quell your fear on entering the pyramid, you keep in mind the 
millions of dollars the golden idol will bring you if you find it. Your main 
concern is staying alive while you do it. 

Aztec is a fascinating game by Paul Stephenson. Anyone who has 
seen Stephenson's previous game. Swashbuckler, will note similarities; 
but Swashbuckler is like a rough draft of Aztec. 

In Aztec, you must find a golden idol and escape from the temple. 
Easier said than done. The temple is swarming with monsters willing to 
kill you without remorse. Some of the monsters are poisonous scorpi- 
ons, deadly black widows, man-eating aUigators, slithering snakes, and a 
ravenous tyrannosaur or two. Many other monsters inhabit the temple 
and they intend to protect their territory. 

Scattered through the maze are chests and rubble piles. Both contain 
surprises, some helpful, others not so helpful. For example, in some 



chests and piles you'll find weapons such as pistols or machetes that are 
essential for protection against the evil monsters. In others, you'll find 
sticks of dynamite. These too are useful — unless they're lit when you 
find them. 

Equally hazardous in Aztec are numerous traps, some of which are 
amusing. But when you stop laughing, you'd better start running; you 
probably have limited time to find an escape from death. Some of the 
rooms have water faucets in them; when they start leaking, you're in 
deep water. Other rooms close in on you, all exits sealed. Before you hurl 
your disk drive through the monitor, try anything you can think of to es- 
cape. For all of these situations, there is an escape. Not always a logical 
one, but a way. 

Fighting with a machete is done in the same fashion as in Swash- 
buckler, but your machete is not effective against all monsters. A pistol, 
however, is — if you have an adequate supply of bullets. 

The graphics in Aztec are very detailed. The animated monsters 
move in a startlingly realistic manner. The sound is somewhat less than 
expected but the general playability renders this flaw irrelevant. 

With seven levels of difficulty and eight floors per temple, there's lots 
of variety for a wide range of player abilities. 

In Aztec, DataMost has done a good job of combining a fantasy ad- 
venture and an arcade-style game into one package. Until now, only Cas- 
tle Wolfenstein had crossed the line between fantasy and arcade games. 
Aztec builds on this concept with more of everything. And if it's a little 
rough around the edges — well, so was Rembrandt. All

Lunar Leeper. By Chuckles. While many arcade games are visually stun- 
ning, gripping, or lightning fast and exciting, only a select few are, well, 
delightful. Lunar Leeper, from Charies "Chuckles" {Laf Pak) Beuche, 
fits the latter category perfectly. It's a lot of fun. 

Your job in this game is to rescue little folk from certain doom at the 
hands (or beaks, if you will) of the dreaded Leepers. You do so by 
swooping down upon them in your trusty spacecraft, picking them up 
with the bottom-mounted grappler, and rushing them to safety on a 
nearby cliff. Sounds easy, huh? 

Meet the Leeper. He's a cute fellow with very llooonnnnggg legs, a 
huge eye, and a menacing beak. But you don't notice his long legs at first, 
because the Leeper squats before he leaps. When he leaps, however, his 
legs show him to be a distant cousin of the ostrich, without the long neck 
and with a penchant for propelling himself straight up instead of hori- 
zontally. Should one of his prodigious leaps bring him within reach of 
you and your trusty spacecraft, well, adieu! Rather like a terrier, the 
Leeper shakes you a bit before you vanish down the hatch. 

By staying at the very top of the screen, you can avoid the suckers, 
but woe to the fellow you just rescued. He hangs below your ship and is 
quite vulnerable. 

You could, of course, just shoot the Leepers on sight and avoid the 
whole mess, but there are some complications. To begin with, each 
Leeper left alive after all the men are rescued is worth 1 ,000 points. A 
dead Leeper is worth a mere 20. Each man you rescue is worth 300 
points, while each one consumed by a Leeper costs you 1,000 points. So 
it pays to let the misbegotten spawn of pogo sticks survive. 

Furthermore, your ship is a little tricky in tight spots. You see, the 
budget was short and they opted not to install brakes on your trusty 
spacecraft. Instead, there's an inertia meter that lets you know in which 
direction momentum currently holds sway. The only thing that slows 
you down is yourself, so to speak. It is simplicity of the log-falling vari- 
ety to coast into the maws of a Leeper. 

Oh, yes, the Leepers are capable of horizontal travel as well, al- 
though hardly in such a manner as to excite admiration. They just sort of 
sidle along, doing a lovely vaudeville soft-shoe, until they find somebody 
to eat. Therefore, it is incumbent upon you, as rescuer, to rescue the res- 
cuees before they become fodder for the shuffling Leepers. 

Then there are the Trabants. Bearing in mind that your beat covers 
the planet Opthamolia, prepare to meet the underground Trabants and 
later their surface-dwelling brethren. They are giant eyeballs, larger than 
your ship. You must fly down a tunnel, avoiding the occasional laser 
base, until you encounter these rather large eyes, bouncing up and down 



JANUARY 1983

in the tunnel. You must dispense with these refugees from CBS as rapidly 
as possible to get to what must be the Queen Trabant, a huge eyeball that 
fills the entire tunnel. Shoot it and you get back to the serious business of 
rescuing little folk. Just don't run out of fuel in the tunnel; there are no 
gas stations nearby. 
Fuel? 

The budget was kind of short, remanbei? Your trusty spacecraft does 
not have a heck of a lot of room for trinkets or frills such as fuel. So you 
have to reftiel quite frequently at the base of the cliffs, while avoiding the 
Leepers. Fortunately, a refueling station appears at the base of either cliff 
when your fuel gauge is at the halfway point. All you have to do is hook 
up to it, inertia notwithstanding. 

At each succeeding level, the game gets harder. In the rescue sce- 
nario, more Leepers and, after a couple of times, flying Trabants appear. 
The Trabants must be totally avoided; they're indestructible. The Leep- 
ers, as always, are to be shunned. During the cave scenario, the Tra- 
bants shoot back, and the laser bases multiply. 

Lunar Leeper is eminently playable. The spacecraft control is both 
frustrating and challenging. The Leepers are swift and unpredictable. 
The game is both silly and enjoyable. The people at Sierra On-Line have 
thoughtfully provided the option of choosing your starting level and the 
ability to use an Atari-style joystick, providing your hardware permits 
sudi, making a very good game even better.

Merlin. By Glen Bredon. Packed with features. Merlin may be the best 
assembler we will ever see for the Apple IL 

Although Merlin won't teach you assembly language, it won't stand 
in your way either. It's set up to make assembly programming as inter- 
active as possible — almost as interactive as Applesoft itself, in fact. 

This means that you can type in your source code, assemble it, save 
the source and object codes to disk, quit Merlin, execute the routine (or 
load and run the Basic program that the routine is designed to be used 
from), note if there is something wrong, and, with the single command 
assem, reenter the assembler. 

Yes, the assembler is still in memory. Furthermore, your source code 
is still intact when you go back to the editor — unless your program did 
something to cream it, as machine language routines, especially faulty 
ones, are sometimes wont to do. 

Many of Merlin's features are well conceived and executed. The edi- 
tor incorporates some of the features of a word processor, including sin- 
gle key commands to delete a character, add to the middle of a line with- 
out overwriting the end, skip to the end (or back to the beginning) of a 
hne, and even move the cursor to the next occurrence of a specified char- 
acter. PLE users will find the commands very familiar. 

Furthermore, there are a number of global editing commands. You 
can find or replace all instances of a given string within the listing. Other 
commands allow a section of code to be copied or moved to another lo- 
cation. The source listing can be printed with or without page headers 
and breaks. In addition to these options, of course, are the standard com- 
mands for adding, deleting, inserting, replacing, and editing lines. 

The editor has a classy bonus feature. It can translate between deci- 
mal and hexadecimal. This is so convenient, in fact, that you may find 
yourself jumping back into Merlin from Basic just to translate numbers. 

The editor has several other features that are more specialized. It 
even allows for such peripherals as lower-case chips and eighty-column 
cards, but none of this sophistication should make the beginner appre- 
hensive, as Merlin's basic functions aren't difficult to master and the 
others can be learned one at a time as they are needed. 

The code must be assembled before you can run it, of course, but 
Merlin's assembler is as painless and quick as the Basic list command. It 
understands the decimal, hex, and binary number systems as well as a 
wide variety of pseudo op-codes designed to bend it to your will in nu- 
merous ways. 

Merlin's exec mode acts as a steppingstone between the editor and 
Applesoft and handles all disk activity. Saving files is easy; Merlin re- 
members the starting address and length of the most recently assembled 
file. And, because all commands in exec mode are done from a menu and 
Merlin remembers the last file naine used, most disk access can be done 



IT'S A JUNGLE 
IN THERE. 




There's an untamed jungle inside your Apple II, lurking 
behind the facade of familiar Applesoft Basic. A place 
populated by unfriendly natives like carry flags, binary 
numbers, and indirect addressing modes. Where the 
only laws are the complex and mysterious ways of 
the 6502 microprocessor. 

For years Apple owners trying to learn 6502 machine 
language had a tough time in this jungle, forced to 
hack their way through one slippery new concept after 
another. 

Now there's an easier path through the machine lan- 
guage jungle. A path that anyone comfortable with 
Basic can follow. 

The Visible Computer: 6502 is a unique new program 
that teaches machine language programming. It com- 
bines a hi-res 6502 simulation with an extensive 
user manual/tutorial to provide the easiest way 
yet to come up to speed on machine language. 

The Visible Computer is like a microscope that lets 
you see inside a 6502 as it executes programs. 

You'll watch the registers change as instructions are 
performed. You'll see how instructions are executed - 
not just their results. You control how fast or 
slow JVC runs. And it can't crash, no matter what. 

Once you've earned your stripes as a machine lan- 
guage programmer, you can use JVC as a powerful 
debugging tool, with features veteran programmers 
appreciate, like: On-line 4 function calculator; 
single step and 6502 modes; disassembler; flexi- 
ble register and memory display.

with a mere two keystrokes. 

Besides these small but significant departures from the ways of other 
assemblers, Merlin has two aces to play: maaos and the Sourceror. 

Macros eliminate a lot of the repetitive work involved in using as- 
sembly language. They allow you to substitute a single command for a 
routine, with variables taking the place of as many as eight addresses. 
You can even assign macros to call other maaos. Macros can give as- 
sembly some of the simplicity of Basic. 

Sourceror is a program that disassembles machine language to create 
a new source file that can be edited with Merlin. This can come in handy 
in situations where the source file is lost or otherwise unavailable. The 
really impressive feature of Sourceror is the way it assigns labels. It can 
recognize the locations of a large number of routines in the Apple's 
ROM, so if you used any of Applesoft's or the Monitor's resident rou- 
tines Sourceror will label them correctly. It assigns labels for other ad- 
dresses by the hex number of the address, so you can use Merlin's global 
search and replace commands to substitute more meaningful words. 

Assembly language is a great way to make your Apple live up to its 
full potential, but too many programmers, while excited about its speed 
and efficiency, are turned off by the difficulty of learning or using it. A 
superb assembler like Merlin can turn that situation around. DD

Super Taxman 2. By Brian Fitzgerald. What's small and circular, runs 
around a maze eating little white dots, and boots up on an Apple? That's 
right, it's Taxman. Now Brian Fitzgerald, mad scientist of H.A.L. Labs, 
brings us Super Taxman 2. 

That little round guy with the uncanny resemblance to that other 
world-renowned dot eater is now a civil servant, a tax collector, and his 
mission is: "Get all the money dots and collect government bonuses, 
avoiding violent citizens." 

Super Taxman 2 has the same multiplayer selection, smooth, flicker- 
free graphic animation, and arcadelike sound effects found in Fitzger- 
ald's original game, along with the color/black-and-white select mode 
that makes it easier to tell if the taxman is chasing the violent citizens or 



being chased no matter what type monitor the game is played on. 

There's no Apple-type joystick mode in Super Taxman 2 (aww), but 
take heart, America, for H.A.L. Labs now offers the Gizmo, a device 
that adapts Atari-style switching joysticks to Apple computers, allowing 
faster playing on the upper levels. For those who don't care to use Atari- 
type joysticks, the game has a choose-your-own keyboard control. 

Super Taxman 2 earns its name with some rather super improve- 
ments over the original Taxman. Most notable are larger, more interest- 
ing mazes (four of them), each with six power dots instead of the tradi- 
tional four. Ninety-nine levels of play progress in speed and difficulty, 
with every third level an ultra-fast "challenging stage" (preceded by a 
musical interlude — ^the Beatles' "When I'm Sixty-Four"). 

Another nice improvement in Super 2 is a level-select option that pro- 
vides the player with a choice of any of the ninety-nine levds of play at the 
start. There are also a pause control and five new cartoon intermissions 
that may be viewed independently of play. HAS

Bellhop. By Garry Kitchen and John Van Ryzin. Many figures have 
been romanticized in our popular culture, but this may well be the first 
time — possibly excepting Philip Morris's Johnny — for the bellhop as 
hero. It's a cute idea, and the game itself isn't bad, but it's likely to sink 
without a trace in a market that's becoming saturated with top-notch 
software. 

You're a bellhop in a hotel, scavenging for tips by hustling seven 
pieces of luggage to seven suites on the sixth floor. As you cart the stuff 
to the elevators and to the various suites on the top floor, a counter that 
keeps track of your tips is rapidly running down in the lower left corner 
of the screen. Ergo, the faster you get the luggage to the rooms, the more 
you collect in tips. 

You begin with $60 in tips at the first level, $50 in tips at the second 
level, and so on. At the third level the hotel ghost appears at the left of 
the screen and slowly works his way up to the top floor. Should he en- 
counter a piece of luggage, he steals it and returns it to the lobby. 

To get the luggage up to the top floor, you must call an elevator and

then ride it up to the floor you desire. Getting bacic to the lobby works 
the same way, with one notable exception: You can jump down the ele- 
vator shaft below an elevator and get there twice as fast. No injuries 
allowed. 

There are some problems with Bellhop. To begin with, the game is 
somewhat slow and unexciting. The only speed increase in the game oc- 
curs in the amount of time it takes for your tips to run out. Further- 
more, there is no cumulative score, which means that no matter how well 
you do early in the game you still start out with the same time (amount 
of tips) for additional levels. There would be a great deal more incentive 
to play if one could earn extra time in the upper levels by succeeding in 
the earlier ones. 

All in all, it's not a bad game, but it's not a great one either. Da

Apple Assembly Line. For the hardcore Apple hacker, there may be no 
better publication than Apple Assembly Line. Mostly written by Bob 
Sander-Cederlof as a monthly newsletter to support owners of his S-C 
Assembler, the digest-size magazine is much more. 

In recent months there have been such articles as the one that enu- 
merated the differences and equivalencies between pseudo op-codes in 
the various popular Apple assemblers. Obviously, the material was in- 
tended to aid S-C owners in adjusting from prior assemblers or in trans- 
lating programs written for another assembler into S-C code. Just as ob- 
viously, the article had import far beyond just those assembly language 
folks who own the S-C Assembler. 

Sander-Cederlof is a man of far-ranging interests, and that shows in 
I the kinds of projects he tackles within the framework of the magazine. 
From speech synthesis to time keeping, Apple Assembly Line hunts down 
the most efficient code to do a given job. Belying the adage that pro- 
grammers can't write, Sander-Cederlof and his correspondents manage to 
communicate in a language that looks suspiciously like fluent and under- 
standable English, even if they do throw a JSR or a BNE into the fray 
occasionally. 

All you need to get a lot out of this publication is an abiding interest 
! in assembly language programming. If you have that, the $15 yearly sub- 
scription rate is a real bargain. ART

Repton. By Dan Thompson and Andy Kaluzniacki. How long has it 
been since you played an arcade game that actually had something to do 
with its melodramatic documentation/scenario? One in which the feel of 
the story came across in the play of the game, along with the pleasant 
alpha wave reflex-testing activity of blasting thine enemies? When was 
the last time you sat and played for hours just to get the feel of the thing 
and a bare outline of scoring/survival strategy — never mind higher 
levels — until your vision blurred, your throat cracked, and your spine 
atrophied? 

That's how good Repton is. You are the Reptonian commander of 
the good ship Armageddon, racing to the belated aid of your defeated 
planet. The Quarriors are consolidating their ill-gotten gains and build- 
ing their base on your planet, taking chunks out of the Repton business 
district and making energy siphon withdrawals from the Reptonian 
power bank. They are also swarming about underground. They are, in a 
word, parasitic. And they feel like it. And there are a lot of them. Yuck. 

Play is as fast as you want it to be; you can have your hands full just 
standing still. You can play offensive or defensive. In the latter, you 
ignore the Drayne ships depleting Repton's energy supply — let them do 
so, in fact — to concentrate on blasting and dodging everything else. This 
failure to save your planet, believe it or not, gets you to the next section 
of the game, where you make your last-ditch stand underground and get 
a shot at the Quarrior nerve center (a bit of a turkey shoot). Losing the 
battle, in other words, is the way to win the war. 

This is not an infinite loop shoot-'em-up where waves of invaders 
keep coming until you are overwhelmed or you get tired of shooting 
back. The enemy is finite, though they will send in reinforcements just 
to make it tough to get to the next level. The first time you get there, 
you're not likely to stay long, nor will you wish to return until someday 
when you're older. 



You cannot, however, remain indefinitely on the first level. You can 
try, of course. Flying back and forth over a Quarrior SAM missile base 
(dense pack, no less!) will trigger waves of warheads launched in your 
wake. You can wheel around and blast away at them for some fast point 
totals, but, if you try this stunt for long, the Quarriors' deadly single- 
ships will come warping in planetside like a cloud of mosquitos, making 
your radar screen look like the inside of a snowflake paperweight and 
dictating a rapid strategic retreat. 

A word about the radar nice. It's the best use of this device in an 
arcade game since Wayout. In most of these games, a little 'scope full of 
blips is either decorative or distracting. In Repton, it pays to keep one eye 
on the tactical while dealing with the main action. It's the only way to 
keep up with what the little buggers are up to, or to brace yourself to 
meet a bunch of them when they start heading your way. 

A word also about the documentation: cool. It's all on the screen and 
constitutes the demo. Brief, direct, and to the point, it's user-selectable 
(no Castle Wolfenstein three-minute bootup here). 

A word about the programming: magic. You can't begin to count the 
number of objects all doing their individual thing on screen at the same 
time, but it never slows down. 

Use of a joystick here is a matter of taste: it depends on the joystick. 
The keyboard mode allows the precision and control you will need, and 
you will need a lot — shields and nuclear devices are available for the faint 
of heart. 

One of the most tired and certainly most treacherous terms in this 
field is state of the art. So we won't use it here. Let's just say that Rep- 
ton makes everything else currently available in this particular genre look 
very thin and small. a(

JANUARY 1983 



Years after that day, Dwight Eisenhower, the supreme allied com- 
mander for Operation Overlord, the invasion of Europe, revealed that he 
had written two drafts for the invasion's press release. One acknowl- 
edged the success of the landings; the other accepted full responsibility 
for the failure of Overlord and the withdrawal of the Allied troops. After a 
few hours with Battle for Normandy you'll understand Ike's feelings on 
that June morning. 

The game set comes traditionally boxed. Included are one double- 
sided disk (one side for Apple II or III, the other for Atari), a seven-page 
game manual, and two game crib cards. Absent is the extended map 
board and cardboard counters used in SSI's "advanced simulations" 
such as Napoleon's Campaigns and the Gettysburg Campaign. In their 
place SSI has used some interesting graphic techniques to assist 
game play. 

You begin Battle for Normandy in your game manual, where you'll 
find an Overlord briefing to you, the commander of the operation, writ- 
ten in the style of a secret military directive and delivered to your head- 
quarters in London. The briefing effectively presents the basic outline 
and strategic overview of the game; it also helps re-create the mood of 
that historic time. 

Battle for Normandy strikes a good balance between complexity and 
playability. On-screen menus and user-selectable time delays enhance 
game flow. 

Play may be either one or two player. In single-player mode the com- 
puter always takes the role of the German opponent; in two-player mode 
the computer serves as referee and game administrator. The player may 
choose a historically accurate scenario or alter the game parameters to

dition to the game is the necessity to allocate shipping and air and naval 
support. Resources are finite and their allocation is a major factor in 
the game. 

The game's graphics use two technologies to provide a strategic over- 
view of the rapidly developing tactical situation. An aggregated hi-res 
map of the entire battlefield shows gross terrain and troop locations. The 
strategic map may be toggled on and off during game play, and the 
graphic hex screen may be scrolled under the direction of a movable cur- 
sor. This same cursor is used to designate units, move troops, and select 
combat. The standard hex grid is used to indicate direction and move- 
ment. The quality of the graphics is excellent, especially the terrain and 
unit counters. SSI has gone a long way in improving information flow 
and using the graphic interface in a logical design format. 

The five principle invasion beaches, as well as the strategic areas of 
St. Lo and Cherbourg, are reproduced on the graphic map. From as- 
signed disembarkation areas your troops hit the beaches, racing against 
time, weather, and the Whermacht. In all, eighteen offensive and defen- 
sive strategies are available to assign to particular units during combat. 
The computer opponent is an aggressive and capable player who will 
capitalize on any obvious blunders or hesitation on your part. Whatever 
you do, get those troops off the beaches and moving inland, General, or 
else. Remember what happened at Anzio!

Zargs. By Max McKee. It has been learned that there are armadas of 
alien fighters on their way to earth to take over the planet. (Where have 
we heard that one before?) The only way that the earth can be saved 
from this hideous fate is to complete and arm the Zarg superstructures. 
Zarg is a multipart military weapon designed to ward off extraterrestrial 
attacks. Two goals must be accomplished create the Zarg and then de- 
fend the earth. 

The first goal is accomplished in three phases. Unfortunately, the first 
two phases entail an activity that is much like hopping spaceships 
through bidirectional traffic — first vertically, then horizontally. The third 
phase is an interesting docking maneuver around the main Zarg struc- 
ture. Once four ships have been docked, the superstructure is complete 
and undergoes a very nice graphic transformation into the Zarg fighting 
machine. 

The battle is joined with the alien vessels attacking from all four sides. 
Four keys control which direction a shot will be fired. Every alien de- 
stroyed adds to the power level, while every strike on the Zarg drains 
power. The battle continues until the aliens surrender (not likely for a 
while) or until the Zarg is destroyed. 

Zargs is written in GraForth. The graphics are clean and flicker-free 
and the sounds are superb. The game is a delight to play, and the final 
battle will be tough to win. It is a good intermediate level arcade game 
for all ages. )D

THE Spreadsheet. By Randy Wigginton, Guil Banks, and Steve Woz- 
niak. Just when you thought it wasn't safe to enter your local computer 
store lest you be struck by one of a proliferating breed of electronic 
spreadsheet packages, the Apple PugetSound Ptogram Library Ex- 
change (A.P.P.L.E.) comes to the rescue. 

Back in the days when the world was young and Mother Nature 
ruled the earth, there was but one — VisiCalc. Now there's VisiCalc and 
SuperCalc and MagiCalc and CalcStar and Multiplan, and heaven only 
knows what's lurking just beyond the horizon. It's enough to give your 
RAM chips the electronic shivers trying to figure out which package is 
the one for you. 

Oddly enough, none of the Calc-alikes have managed to add one 
whit to the accumulated body of technology as it pertains to spread- 
sheets. Even more oddly, the result of all this competition has had a de- 
cidedly uncompetitive result — prices keep rising. 

Remember when VisiCalc was $99 and everyone was agog at Per-

sonal Software's affrontery in assuming that any software could be worth 
that much? Now it costs you two or three times that much to get into a 
spreadsheet package that's only bells and whistles better than the orig- 
inal. So much for Adam Smith and the virtues of competition. 

But where Adam Smith's theory may have failed, A.P.P.L.E. found a 
gaping hole in the market and moved to fill it for its club members. THE 
Spreadsheet is that program, and it does more than the original VisiCalc 
at File Cabinet prices — $22.50. At that price nobody, repeat nobody, 
should be without the power of a spreadsheet in their home or office. 
And, while it may not be as much fun as Choplifter, anyone new to 
spreadsheets will be suitably awed by the power and performance of the 
package. 

It serves little purpose to enumerate here the virtues of spreadsheets, 
nor is it useful to itemize those slight differences that distinguish this ver- 
sion from others. 

The salient point is the price. You no longer have to be Daddy War- 
bucks to play "what if on your Apple. If you are not an A.P.P.L.E. 
member, the cost rises to $67.50. That includes a $25 initiation fee into 
the club and $20 for annual dues. But for that you get other club bene- 
fits, including the outstanding Call —A.P.P.L.E. magazine. 

The competitive market in spreadsheets is changing rapidly and 
breakthroughs may soon occur. But at the moment Apple owners 
generally need consider only three: THE Spreadsheet for economy, 
Multiplan for certain three-dimensional applications, and VisiCalc: Ad- 
vanced Version for power extraordinaire. Implementing a spreadsheet 
program into an overall business environment may dictate choosing 
another; but those who have been laboring over a hot computer can now 
get 80 percent of the power of a spreadsheet for less than 10 percent of 
the price. ART

A.P.P.L.E. (available to members only) (304 Main Avenue South, Suite 300,

plesoft Basic? Bah! You can't write games in Applesoft; they're no good, 
and that's the truth." 
Well, the truth is false. 

Beagle Bag is the latest in the Beagle Bros indoor sports line — a col- 
lection of twelve games and several miscellaneous programs, all in that 
inimitable Beagle Bros style — fun for fun's sake. Everything is written in 
sluggish Basic; speed, however, is not the crucial element that makes this 
disk work. 

The games require quick thinking, but they're not mere tests of quick 
reflexes. They're more the brain-twister variety, forcing you to think be- 
fore making your move, and forcing you to do it quickly. Texttrain, for 
example, puts you in the engineer's seat of a choo-choo. The object is to 
manipulate railroad switches, car coupling, and forward/reverse con- 
trols, to hook up cars in a sequence so they spell out a preselected word, 
all in the smallest amount of time. Triple Digits lets you play against hu- 
man competition as you both try to outscore one another by placing 
numbers strategically in sequences that give you the most possible points. 

All the games on the disk are educational, but not in the scholastic 
sense. Youngsters will enjoy playing Hang Person (the guessing game on 
the gallows). Sub Search (a real-time version of Battleship), Pick-A-Pair 
(just like Concentration), and the rest of these mini-games because they 
are challenging and fun ways to develop mental agility. For mature audi- 
ences. Beagle Bag offers a little more. 

In keqjing with the Beagle tradition, Kersey and company have Idl 
the disk unprotected for the user's benefit. You can catalog it, load, 
modify, delete, rename, and save each program. And, yes, that means 
you can look at each listing and see why the program does what it does 
and how you can do the same thing in your own programs. Be careful, 
though. Gazing through the listing of some games may ruin the chal- 
lenge of future play. 

Of particular interest is a group of four "tricks" called Magic Pack. 
With this program in memory, you are the magician, and those around 
you are your victims — er, audience. To the audience, the Apple will ap- 
pear to be performing impossible tricks. Actually, it's just Kersey up to 
his old shenanigans. A few pokes here, a few string variables there, and a 
whole bunch of gosubs make this an entertaining way to answer those 
smarty-pants friends who ask, "So, what can you do with this thing, 
anyway?" 

Then there's the manual. 

The disk is not expensive. But, at any price, the twenty-page manual 
that comes with it is worth a few bucks by itself. Even if you don't have 
the Beagle Bag disk, find someone who has the manual and read it. 
Why? Because it's funnier than Mad Magazine and shortCT than Nation- 
al Lampoon. The prankster prose ("Secretly load Naked City into a 
friend's Apple and stand back and watch . . .") is good for a few guf- 
faws, the Monty Python-style art wUl keep you giggling, and the section 
on $2(X) free cash will have you thinking that maybe Reaganomics isn't 
so bad. 

If someone asks you if you've seen Beagle Bag. you'll have to an- 
swer, "Which part?" For the price. Beagle Bag gives you twenty pro- 
grams at $1.50 each. Try finding a decent hamburger and a soda for that 
price. 

The folks at Beagle Bros took a simple, unsophisticated program- 
ming language and tumed out an innovative package — one that's educa- 
tional, interesting, and entertaining. By technical standards, Beagle Bag 
is where the film industry was in the thirties.

Sea Dragon. By John Anderson. And suddenly there were submarine 
games . . . Neptune, Jellyfish, Seafox, and now Sea Dragon. Sea Dragon 
is definitely another thread-your-way-through-the-tunnels game, com- 
plete with mines, electric eels, lasers, sea fleas (!), and gun turrets — and, 
of course, a dragon. 

When you boot the disk it talks to you, or at least the computer 
does. It says "'Sea Dragon" in what seems like a Japanese accent heard 
over a terrible intercom. Then it asks you to wait while it "initializes sys- 
tems." Cute. 

Once you get underway, you are the pilot of a submarine that looks

not unlike a shark. You must guide your craft, via keyboard, joystick, or 
Atari-style joystick, through a treacherous tunnel some forty-four screens 
wide, avoiding all sorts of perils along the way. You are armed with 
limitless torpedoes and a sonic deflector. The aforementioned deflector 
would more aptly be called an annihilator, for that's what it does: oblit- 
erates anything on the screen. In the interest of fairness, the folks at Ad- 
venture International don't award any points for hazards destroyed via 
sonic deflector; it's too easy. Instead, using the sonic deflector consumes 
five hundred units of air, of which you only have six thousand units to 
begin with. It does not pay to run out of air, and thus it does not pay to 
use the aforementioned deflector with any frequency. 

Should you survive the mines, lasers, turrets, eels, seaweed, sea fleas, 
and sundry others, you reach the dragon. Depending on how much air 
you have left, there will be a certain number of scrolling bricks imprison- 
ing the dragon. Your task is to shoot away all the bricks and free the ser- 
pent, but don't hit him, for god's sake! There's a thousand point penalty 
for each hit on the dragon. 

Freeing the dragon replenishes your air supply and allows you to 
continue your suicide trek through the underwater passageways. 

Sea Dragon seems slow at first, but the hazards are so thick as to 
make any gamer forget about the speed of the graphics. The graphics are 
good, while not finely done. The tunnel itself runs horizontally for the 
most part, with occasional vertical dips and rises of a somewhat precipi- 
tous nature. Instead of having several ships as second chances, you are 
permitted to take 100 percent damage before starting anew. Running 
into a wall causes 10 percent damage and running into a hazard causes 
15 percent. Thus, you get between seven and ten tries per game. 

The game itself is quite playable. Although the speed makes the sub's 
responsiveness seem sluggish, perseverance proves the ship to be up to 
the task. With practice, you can learn how to clear the mines and avoid 
the lasers. Fortunately, the folks in Florida put a practice mode into the 
game. This mode plays at the same speed as the normal game but starts 
you off with a good deal more air, permitting you to use the sonic de- 
flector more frequently and thus see more of the tunnel and game. 

If running a gauntlet of jagged scrolling tunnels filled with innumer- 
able bad guys is your cup of tea, you should find Sea Dragon most enjoy- 
able. It plays well and is by no means an eyesore. It should provide a 
good deal of entertainment. DA

Computer Fundamentals and Programming in Basic. By Bob Bushey. 
The ultimate self-teaching aid for learning microcomputer principles and 
operation is one that tells you and shows you what you are supposed to 
do and then lets you take your time to do it. This, of course, is the defini- 
tion of videotape instruction, increasingly popular in schools and now 
catching on in homes that have television, computer, and videotape 
recorder. If you have the technology, you could do worse than Avion 
Video Computers's Computer Fundamentals and Programming in Basic 
(Beta or VHS). 

The fundamentals tape gets down to brass chips, going into detail on 
the structure and function of the micro and how it's used. You may well 
find that there's more of this information than you want to know. For- 
tunately, each section of instruction is keyed with an index number that 
can be used for fast-forwarding past or rewinding back to a given section. 

In the how-to section, each lesson signals when it's completed and 
gives you the opportunity to try out what you've learned — hit the pause 
button, switch from VCR to computer, exercise your new abilities on 
your keyboard, then on to the next lesson. "Live" demonstrations are 
interspersed with diagrams and illustrations. The graphics are bright and 
cdlorful. 

For the climax of the fundamentals tape— writing a Basic program — 
watching a program take shape and seeing it run on the tape as it is sup- 
posed to run on your computer is helpful indeed and a good early lesson 
in neat programming habits. 

Both tapes are based on a course of classroom instruction offered by 
Avion Video Computers. Often as not, it really does feel like class- 
room instruction — perhaps with one of your high school civics teachers 
on a June afternoon. The narration is informal and digresses freely to 
related topics. For those recently graduated from the American educa-

tional system, the temptation to turn off the teacher and run outside to 
play may prove too strong too frequently — the obvious drawback to all 
learn-at-home courses. This course was put together by teachers rather 
than marketing specialists trained in the art of getting your attention. As 
such, it is strictly an adult education course for those motivated to learn. 

But, if motivated you be, rewards you shall have. Expect to take from 
five to ten hours to complete a course of instruction, including the per- 
forming of all drill, practice, and review. AC

Tubeway. By David Arthur Van Brink. Deep in space, you're patrolling 
the galaxy on your usual route when suddenly something strange occurs. 
Your ship begins to shake uncontrollably and an unearthly force pulls 
you to a galactic battlefield, the Tubeway. A force field traps you at the 
rim as a storm of aliens begin to travel up the Tubeway in pursuit. 

That may sound like a bad dream or a clip from Star Wars, but it's 
neither. It is the setting for Tubeway, a fast-action home-arcade game 
from DataMost. 

In Tubeway, your ship has two defense mechanisms — your laser- 
firing ability and your super zapper. The zapper, which is time-released, 
appears as a white line rotating around the outer rim. When detonated, 
the super zapper will destroy all aliens that have reached the outer rim. 

On the first four levels, the aliens you battle are called Homers and 
Seekers. These levels are introductory in comparison to the challenges 
that await you on the upper levels. On levels five and six, the Homers and 
Seekers call upon the S.U.s, another breed of alien, to make your 
mission even more difficult. When destroyed, S.U.s transform into 
Homers and Seekers. 

Tubeway has thirty-two levels of difficulty; not many people will be 
able to say they've seen the final level. From level seven up, the aliens 
waste no time attempting to blow you out of the sky. They come racing 
up the Tubeway after you, some leaving deadly spikes in their trail. 
When you destroy all the aliens on your level, these spikes are released 
and shoot up the tube. They must be avoided or blasted away. 

Of all the aliens in Tubeway, the deadliest is the Destroyer. The De- 
stroyer lives in a cage; when it's released it will track you relentlessly. The 
Destroyer cannot be destroyed, only returned to its cage when hit by 
your super zapper. On these levels of extreme difficulty, your ship's ver- 
satility is most important. Your ship can travel all the way around the 
Tubeway in a split second — and may have to. 

Tubeway is highly addictive and very challenging. As a warning, you 
may want to remove any breakable objects within arm's reach. AH

Chatsworth, CA 91311; 213-709-1202). $34.95. 

Executive Briefing System. By Mitch Kapor. Graphing and plotting 
programs can be frustrating to use. The visual output they provide is of- 
ten limited, and a slide show function isn't effective if your presentations 
aren't self-explanatory. 

Executive Briefing System solves these problems. Its range of graphics 
is large and it permits explanatory — or any other — text on the slides 
along with graphics. 

With EBS, you can use your Apple II, or III, to generate a slide show 
eminently suitable for use in decision support presentations. The for- 
matting flexibility of EBS is wonderful; its use of color graphics makes it 
one of the few decision-support products that successfully take advan- 
tage of the Apple's graphics capabilities. 

EBS can produce multiple text formats, screen graphics, normal and 
inverse video, multiple colors, and numerous font types. Tutorials in the 
manual carefully walk you through the different data and text entry for- 
mats to produce these wonders logically following normal format. 

EBS may be used alone or in conjunction with several other business 
programs, including VisiTrend/ VisiPlot, ApplePlot. the Apple Graphics 
Tablet, and any program that stores hi-res pictures normally. 

EBS is extremely easy to use, and it's fun to play with — a plus for a 
program aimed toward business applications. Novice computer users 
should have no real problems setting up and getting started with this pro- 
gram. EBS is recommended for two disk drive systems; but it will work 
with one if you're willing to spend plenty of time doing a push-pull rou- 



tine with your disk. EBS copies or transfers one file at a time. 

Designing your slides is simple. Text entry is done by typing in the 
text from the keyboard. The main constraint here is the lack of word 
wrap; this forces you to be more aware of spacing and the number of 
characters you want to produce on one line. Numerous text sizes and 
fonts are available. Letters may be entered in normal, boldface, inverse, 
and upper and lower case, and it is possible to use mixed formats. Sev- 
eral letter fonts come standard, and Lotus has a full line of other font 
types available. Accessory disks may be purchased for use on standard or 
color monitors, and some contain both color and black-and-white fonts. 
In addition to alphabets, some of the disks contain special characters and 
shapes to enhance your slides. 

EBS produces black-and-white printouts of slides through compati- 
ble graphics printers. 

You can select among several formats for your slide shows. Choose 
the amount of time you want each slide to appear on the screen; then se- 
lect the kind of screen transition you'd like between slides. Transitions 
can be spiral, curtain up, curtain down, or all three interspersed 
randomly. 

Transfer of graphs and charts from other programs is simple. For ex- 
ample, a line chart generated on VisiTrend/ VisiPlot was saved to a data 
disk using VisiPlot's pixsave format. From EBS, the chart was called

whole procedure took less than ten minutes. 

EBS would enhance any business software library. There are a few 
problems, like the time required for certain functions to be performed 
and the need to switch back and forth between command lines when de- 
signing complex slides, but these are not significant. 

But you don't have to be in business to enjoy EBS. It can also be 
used to enhance school reports or in designing simple flyers for meet- 
ings. You probably have a project going right now for which you could

Contest Clarification 

I didn't think the rules for the Shapes contest in 
the September '82 issue were clear enough. 
Would you have accepted multiple entries for 
the same shape, and what about specificity? If 
one entry is "car" and another is "Thunder- 
bird," which would be correct? 

I think readers should be limited to one en- 
try per contest. A winner should be judged on 
the basis of quality, not quantity. If I were to 
send in 40,000 entries to the Oracle contest I'm 
sure I'd win. In fact, I would win any contest 
that uses the random number generator to pick 
the winner just because of the quantity of en- 
tries I'd sent. What do you think? 
Paul Zerner, Weston, MA 

Because the rules for the Shapes contest were 
open-ended, we were pretty flexible in the judg- 
ing (see Contest Winners, December 1982). 
Whenever we run a contest that is judged on crea- 
tivity, such as the contest this month, we encour- 
age readers to enter as many times as they please. 
Shoot, if you have more than one idea for an en- 
try, send them all! We love reading them. 

On the other hand, for contests in which ties 
are possible we allow one entry per person per an- 
swer. This means if you send in several entries, 
each with a different answer, you're in the run- 
ning since only one will be right. But if you bom- 



bard us with 40,000 correct entries only one goes 
into the dreaded random number generator with 
your name on it. This keeps things fair for those 
who can't afford $8,000 in postage stamps. 

(Actually, because you're allowed as many as 
ten entries per envelope, the cost would be only 
$800 — easily within the budget of every contest 
entrant. . . .) 

Great Expectations 

I would like to voice my disappointment with 
the Applefest held in Minneapolis. This was not 
an opportunity to meet the top ten software 
publishers; it was not an opportunity to meet 
representatives from Apple Computer. It was 
merely a local display of dealers from the Twin 
Cities with every computer off the showroom 
floor, except an Apple. 
Bruce Steinhagen, Algoma, WI 

Up to Something 

I have had an Apple II Plus for nearly a year 
and I was wondering if any readers of Softalk 
have a software conversion for TRS-80 or Atari 
cassettes to the Apple, allowing the programs to 
be saved to Apple disks and run later. 

Also, I've seen a hardware modification that 
converts a raster-scan screen to vector style, but 
it's not for the Apple. If anyone knows if a vec- 
tor graphics system could be developed for the 
Apple II Plus I would appreciate hearing about 
it through Open Discussion. 

Finally, I'm interested in making a direct- 
memory video digitizer that shows, in the same 
color and in the same amount of pixels across 
the monitor, an image that could be stored on a 
hi-res page, then on a disk. Any ideas? 
Gregg Johnson, Westerville, OH 

New Year's Resolution 

I write in response to Bob Wiseman's metalet- 
ter in Open Discussion (November 1982), de- 
spite his complaint about printing letters that re- 
fer to previous letters. Apparently Mr. Wise- 
man would like each issue that is discussed to be 
settled in one pass. If this were done, we would 
not have the opportunity to question the ideas 
of other writers or provide solutions to ques- 
tions posed. Mr. Wiseman predicts (erroneous- 
ly) that "in six months no new material will ap- 
pear." This is not a reasonable statement of a 
truly wise man. The flow of ideas in continued 
exchange, challenge, and suggestion is what 
leads thinkers to modification, new conclu- 
sions, and creative thought. Examined ideas are 
the basis of much of our rational knowledge, in- 
deed the core of reasoned thought. Un- 
examined ideas are only to be expected in total- 
itarianism. Please keep Open Discussion a place 
for free, spirited quest — our Apple public 
forum.

Outward bound, Seattle. The sailing ship Varm, out of Hawaii via 
Glacier Bay, is headed for Monterey before making the last leg of her 
long voyage home. Built in 1945 by one of the world's master shipbuild- 
ers to be the finest sailing vessel in the world, it's caught in a full Pacific 
Northwest gale and it's tossing like a cork. The time is four bells, two in 
the morning. The man at the helm is holding on to it to keep himself 
from being blown or washed off the deck as much as to keep the Varua 
on course. 

The skipper's head appears at the door of his cabin. He looks around 
the fo'c's'le briefly, blinks, and nods, satisfied. 

"Okay," he says to the man at the helm; "yell if anything goes 
wrong." 

And he disappears back into his cabin. 

Yell if anything goes wrong? 

Tracy Valleau is an Apple programmer/consultant. 

He's an independent. 

Start Up Time. Five years ago, Tracy Valleau had entered into a 
partnership in a Berkeley camera store and built it from a marginal con- 



157 

cern to a profit-making enterprise. Having more than tripled the store's 
income, he was now paying out a couple of hundred bucks a month to 
an accounting firm to put the business' books on a computer. Watch- 
ing the program being periodically updated, looking over the program- 
mer's shoulder as the code scrolled by, a thought eventually occurred to 
him: "Hey, I understand some of this." 

He sold his share of the store, bought himself half a suit, an Apple, 
and a couple of disk drives, and told himself, "Well, you just spent your 
last dime on this machine and you don't know anything about it; better 
read a few books and see if you can do something with it." 

After writing several programs for his own entertainment and that of 
the small, exotic tribe that owned Apples at the time, he realized it was 
possible to make a living at it. He decided to specialize in the one-shot 
deal: something that somebody needs done that there isn't anything com- 
mercially available for; something that's a challenge. He called his one- 
man company DataSmith. 

"I got my machine right when Apple was moving to the Bandley 
Drive address," he recalls. "One day, I got an anonymous phone call: 

" 'You . . . deal with Apples?' 

" 'Yeah.' 

" 'What do you think of . . . the Controller? 
" 'I think it's a fine product for 99 percent of the people who use it. I 
write specialized programs.' 
" 'Oh. Okay, thanks.' 

"Two months later I found out I was on Apple's recommended pro- 
grammers list. I got a kick out of that." 

Since then, he has spent a lot of time testing and reviewing products 
for Apple Computer and commenting on documentation. 

Tracy Valleau lives and works in the Monterey Peninsula communi- 
ty of Pacific Grove in a bustling one-room abode about fifty yards off the 
main house belonging to his landlord and attorney, Steve Slatkow. He 
shares his quarters with a small black cat that answers to "Hey, you," 
and a library of four hundred Apple programs that includes numerous 
early lo-res games and Paul Lutus's first editor. Rush-hour traffic be- 
comes a problem in Pacific Grove once a year in autumn when the Mon- 
arch butterflies return — "You have to wade through them with a base- 
ball bat." Noise pollution is a problem whenever a high wind blows 
through the branches of the Monterey pines that densely populate 
the area. 

Hey, it's a living. 

You'll Never Get Rich by Digging a Ditch. Valleau did not discover 
the Monterey Peninsula intentionally, but as a side effect of a personal 
invitation from the United States Army to try a complimentary two-year 
stay at their luxurious Fort Ord resort — an offer he couldn't refuse. Val- 
leau whiled away his two years as company clerk, fending off the ennui 
of the bureaucratic military life by periodically reporting himself AWOL 
and ordering his records flagged. When he got out of the service, he 
stayed in Monterey. Today, his one-room abode in its pine grove is the 
only area in his rather restless thirty-five years that he would character- 
ize as "the kind of place you can come back to and look at it and say 
'home.' " 

The army experience paid off in other ways as well. Shortly after he 
had established DataSmith, and right after the Pascal language had come 
out, the army contacted him again. They needed a program that could 
keep track of up to a thousand individuals on a base with up to three 
hundred fifty rooms, configured by any number of beds up to five, each 
bed identified as single and full or free. They wanted a reservation sys- 
tem set up, with each man identified by rank, why he was there, and how 
long he was going to stay. They'd called IBM and had been told it 
couldn't be done on a small computer. "I'll be right over," said Tracy. 

"I told them sixty days and wound up taking almost a year. And the 
only thing that made it possible was bit arrays; great, massive quantities 
of Boolean arrays. And we did it: eighty-six pages of code with no repe- 
titions. The real challenge was that the system would have to be used by, 
shall we say, anybody. It had to be bulletproof; real simple. 

"Got it done; got it running on an Apple with two disk drives and 
you never have to take a disk out. The army uses it on five bases." 

Sail Away. Another unexpected opportunity came through his con- 
nection with Apple. One day he got a call from Apple to say that the 
University of Hawaii was looking for a programmer for a scientific proj-

ect. How would Mr. Valleau like to sign on as a crew member on a 
brigantine sailing vessel and spend a few months chasing whales around 
Alaska with an Apple on board? 

"I said, 'I'll have to think about it . . . yes.' " 

It seemed that a drastic drop in the humpback whale population had 
been recorded in 1977, the year the Princess cruise ships started sailing 
into Glacier Bay, the whales' traditional spawning grounds. The bay was 
now closed to all major nautical traffic and the Varua had to obtain a 
special entry permit to observe the whales for possible changes in their 
migratory patterns. 

Said observation was accomplished in the main with a theodolite, a 
surveying device used to take a reading on the point where a whale sur- 
faced and then track it for changes in course and speed. Feeding the 
information to the Apple would produce two lines on the hi-res screen, 
dumped to a Silentype, indicating the path of the whale relative to the 
course of the vessel. 

All hands were required to do an equal share of work; cooking, 
standing watch, deck swabbing, steering the ship through gales, and 
the like. 

"It was not the kind of thing I would have been doing if I had been 
working eight to five for Apple Computer," muses Valleau. "In fact, 
after the five months, I had plans just to take my Apple II, stash it on 
board, and stay with the boat . . . but pragmatism took over at the ex- 
pense of romanticism." 

Success Is What You Make It. Tracy Valleau has made his own life- 
style. He enjoys his work, he gives himself frequent vacations, and he 
lives in one of the most beautiful corners of the planet. There are a lot of 
romantics who would approve of Valleau's brand of pragmatism. But 
he started out as a businessman and he remains one. 

What advice does he have for anyone on the trail of the Good Life 
through programming? 

"There are a lot of opportunities open for people who want to get 
serious with this kind of thing. The standard advice is 'Write a game,' 
and there's nothing wrong with that. I don't want to develop anything 




Watching for whales on the deck of the Varua. 



that's really mainstream commercial because of all the headaches it 
involves — and the packaging, marketing, and distribution. I've always 
believed it's possible to lead a comfortable, happy life where nobody ever 
hears of you except six or seven clients." 

Aside from a little packet of real wood keyboard inserts with which 
to beautify your Apple, DataSmith's only other commercial product has 
been an ill-fated capital assets depreciation program. 

"Somehow, the ad turned up in a magazine for Commodore Pet 
owners, which didn't really get the word out in the Apple market; then 
they changed the depreciation laws. . . . 

"I prefer to be in a position where I can help somebody; say, 'Yeah, I 
can write a program that will do that for you,' and take six months to do 
it. It's a professional relationship. You have to be there for the client not 
only during the writing of the program, but afterward. Clients are

generally just like anyone who first goes into computers. The first thing 
they say is, 'Ask it what the capital of Armenia is.' And you say, 'Well, it 
doesn't quite work that way. . . .' And, when you're halfway through writ- 
ing the program, they'll invariably say, 'Oh, you know what would be 
another nice thing to have it do?' and you smile and say, 'Yes, that would 
be nice.' And you go back and write a bunch of code and start over 
again. 

"If someone asks me, 'Hey, can you make the Apple do X, Y, and Z?' 
and I know of a piece of canned software that will, I'll tell them; I feel 
obligated to. Aside from it being unethical not to, it would be bad busi- 
ness. If clients were to discover that I'd hit them up for $6,000 for some- 
thing they could have gotten at a store for $150, they'd be a little upset. 
My business depends on word of mouth, and when bad word of mouth 
starts, there's no way to stop it. 

"It's satisfying to take an assignment and make the program do 
exactly what the client wants it to do. You can't walk into a store and 
buy a program that will track Hobie Cats for the Monterey Regatta, cer- 
tainly not with the speed and accuracy of the one David Kempton wrote 
for it {DASH). 

"But, when I can see that they can get close to what they want with 
VisiCalc or a commercial database, I'll tell them, 'Sure, I could make it 
do exactly what you want and it would cost you buckets of money, but if 
you're willing to cut this little corner right here, you could get it down the 
street for a couple of hundred bucks.' That is, in my opinion, the best 
business technique, because those are the people who later say, 'Hey, 
here's a guy who didn't try to oversell me.' 

"The secret of success is to honest-to-God care about the customer." 

You Shall Enjoy the Fruits of His Labor. Another secret of success 
is to be good at what you do. Valleau's latest project, slated for immi- 
nent release by a major software house, is a 3-D graphics package for 
the Apple III done in a combination of assembly language and Pascal 
routines that interface like blocks, with Dr. John Jeppson's disassonbler 



handling the color fill with dispatch. The program allows the user to 
work with three hundred planes and three thousand vertices in the con- 
struction of objects and display twenty objects per scene with up to 
thirty-two surfaces each. 

The program's potential for computer-aided design is obvious. Its po- 
tential as a game programming utility reels the mind. ("You can fly 
around and into three-dimensional objects, using a joystick. This is 
gonna make some people's eyeteeth drop out.") In his spare time, Val- 
leau is, in fact, working on a game: an interactive role-playing space 
adventure with "legitimated visuals" and a moral imperative. On such 
matters, of course, one must say little. 

What It's All About. "Everybody specializes in different things. I 
chose to specialize in unusual or difficult programs. There are two rea- 
sons for that I like a challenge; and, if the requirements are that diffi- 
cult, I can charge a lot of money for the programs — which is fortunate, 
because such projects are few and far between. 

"Also, it's nice to be in a business in which you can do something you 
believe in. There are a lot of good machines on the market, but the best is 
still the Apple. I can look anybody in the eye and say that because it's 
true. It was the best in the beginning because of the hardware — there was 
nothing around that was as dependable or was built as well — and it's still 
the best today because of the software. 

"The small independent consultant is rather rare, I think. You can't 
just leap into the business. I was able to because I was single and young. 
I'm sure there are a lot of former Honeywell employees doing consulting 
work for Hilton Hotels and whatever, but full-time one-man program- 
ming . . . that's another thing. 

"When I decided to get into this, it seemed to me that what was really 
important was the quality of life; not just what kind of gee-whiz thing 
you can do but how you can do it and be happy." 

For the future: "Retirement. Computers are great, but I'd rather be 
sailing." HI

VisiCalc™ 

pre-boot with 80-Column Display 

Now you can view the VisiCalc electronic worksheet window in 
80 columns. Since the entry line is also 80 columns wide, 
complex formulas can now be seen in their entirety for editing 
ease. An added bonus is the ability to display upper and lower 
case. $49.00 

Suggested retail price 

For those who need even more power, a more advanced ver- 
sion combines all the above features with the ability to use 
many of the memory expansion boards currently available. A 
configuration editor allows VisiCalc to use a mixture of dif- 
ferent kinds of memory expansion cards. Just tell it what 
memory cards you have and which slots they are in. For exam- 
ple, you could use more than one language card equivalent. The 
memory cards can be combined 
to give you access up to 
176 K of memory!

The Challenge! Last month you were left with a challenge — a prob- 
lem to solve. That challenge is repeated here so those of you who don't 
have the last issue handy can review it. The only stipulation for solving 
this problem is that you have a version of VisiCalc that contains logic 
functions. 

The Problem. The problem concerns a sales analysis for the sales of- 
fice of a company that manufactures photocopiers. The sales office is re- 
sponsible for three geographic areas and has hired sales representatives 
to cover two of the three areas. Now the sales manager must decide 
whether it would be wise for the company to hire more sales reps to cov- 
er the third area. All sales in Area 3 are responses to national advertising 
by the parent company. The sales manager must decide whether sales 
reps actually contribute enough to warrant adding more of them. 

Figure 1 shows the template the sales manager has developed. The 
values in columns B and C are values he entered. The formula in column 
D is column B divided by column C (for example, in cell D4: -I-B4/C4). 
Since there are no sales reps in Area 3 (cell C6), VisiCalc gives a division 
by zero error and displays ERROR in cell D6. When the sales manager 
tries to average column D in D7, it displays another ERROR. 

The sales manager could ignore the ERROR in D6 and average Area 
1 and Area 2 sales reps (-l-D4-fD5) /2) in D7, but he would like to be 
able to use and expand the template when he becomes national sales 
manager in a few months. When he adds sales representatives or moves 
them to different territories, he doesn't want to have to reenter the aver- 
aging formula. 

Can you fix the template so that any ERRORs that show in col- 
umn D don't affect the formula in D7? 

The Solution? In solving anything, the first thing to ask is "What is 
the problem?" Functions in VisiCalc allow the ERROR display to over- 
ride whatever the function is trying to accomplish. For example, if you 
try to sum three cells, one of which displays ERROR, the sum will also 
be ERROR. VisiCalc works this way to ensure that you know about any 
errors that might corrupt your answer. 

So the problem is, how do we insulate our answer from the ERROR 
condition? A look at the reference card or the user manual reveals a func- 
tion known as @ISERROR(v). This function is designed to return a 
TRUE if V is an ERROR. There's a companion function, @ISNA(v), 
that does the same thing for cells that display NA. 

So, it looks as though we have a solution. All we have to do is apply 
©ISERROR to each cell in column D. But there's one glitch. The 
©ISERROR function returns TRUE if an ERROR is indicated or 
FALSE if no ERROR is displayed. Great — we know now that we can 
isolate the ERROR, but we get TRUE or FALSE instead of values. 

Another logic function listed in the user manual is the ©AND func- 
tion. The ©AND function displays TRUE if all the values in the list are 
TRUE; otherwise it displays FALSE. That doesn't seem to resolve the

need for a value to be displayed either. Likewise, the functions ©NOT 
and ©OR return only TRUE or FALSE. That leaves ©IF. Convenient- 
ly, ©IF allows values to be returned. Before we make a move toward 
solving our challenge, let's look a little closer at ©IF. 

If, Then, Else. ©IF is one of the most useful, and possibly one of 
the least understood, VisiCalc functions. A good way to clarify how it 
works is to phrase the function in English. You might ask VisiCalc to do 
the following //my expenses this month are less than my pay, then add 
the difference (profit) to my savings account and tell me the total bal- 
ance; else tell me how much I still owe. 

The function would be written as follows: 

@IF(l,v1,v2) 

where / is any logical value and v/ and v2 are legal VisiCalc values. 

Using a combination of VisiCalc and English, our example would be 
stated this way: 

@IF (EXPENSES < PAY, THEN SAVINGS BALANCE + (PAY - 

EXPENSE), ELSE PAY - EXPENSE) 
In VisiCalc alone this might be written: 

@IF(C50<B50,G11+{B50-C50),B50-G50) 

At the beginning, the VisiCalc version of our example reads much 
like our original English. If expenses (C50) are less than pay (B50), take 
the savings account balance (Gil) and add the remainder of pay minus 
expenses (B50— C50). If expenses aren't less than pay (that is, they are 
greater), then tell me how much I still owe (B50-C50). 

The initial statement in the ©IF formula is called a logical value. This 
statement is the comparison of any values using the logical opwators, 
the ©TRUE and ©FALSE functions, or one of the logic functions that 
returns TRUE or FALSE. Effectively, what happens in our example is 
that VisiCalc evaluates the logical value C50<B50 and returns TRUE if 
C50 is smaller than B50. Otherwise it returns FALSE. If TRUE is re- 
turned, then the first value (G11-I-(B50-C50)) is calculated and dis- 
played. Otherwise the second value (B50— C50) is calculated and dis- 
played. Simple and elegant (you'll hear this phrase often here). 

What if pay and expenses are exactly equal? Look at the logical val- 
ue C50<B50 again. If pay and expenses are equal, then expenses (C50) 
are not less than pay (B50), and FALSE is returned. 

The ©IF function gives us a very powerful way to make VisiCalc 
choose or compute a specified value depending on criteria we stipulate. 
And, remember, the two values don't actually have to be part of the 
equation. They can be references to other cells or they can even be other 
functions. 

Back to Our Giallenge. It would seem that ©IF could be used to iso- 
late ©ERROR and then return the correct value. How? If an ERROR is 
generated by the original formula, we should be able to use ©ISERROR 
to change the ERROR to TRUE and then return the desired number 
from the first value in the ©IF statement. 

Looks like we are on the road to our answer — but not quite. Look 
again at the ©IF statement in our example: 

@IF(C50<B50,G 1 1 +(B50-C50),B50-C50) 

Assuming that B50 is an ERROR, look now at our restated formu- 
la. This time we'll use ©ISERROR and replace B50 with ERROR. 

@IF(@ISERROR{C50<ERROR),G11+(ERROR-C50) ,ERROR-C50) 
This formula can be resolved to read: 

@IF(TRUE,G11+(ERROR-C50) ,ERROR-C50) 

We've learned something important here. Even though we've man- 



164

aged to isolate the initial ERROR, the two value alternatives still return 
ERROR. 

If at this point you feel like throwing up your hands and running off 
into the distance screaming and yelling, take heart. That's exactly what 
the author of this column did at first. 

Knowing what we know now, let's think about our original problem 
and see if we can apply some of the things we've just learned. 

The Challenge — Solved. We know that we won't be able to isolate 
the ERROR indications easily from the final ©AVERAGE and still be 
able to display the desired values. Another way to attack the problem is 
to back up one level and try to isolate the ERROR indication at the 
place where it is first displayed. 

Returning to our original template, we'll have to change the formu- 
las in cells D4, D5, and D6. The formula in cell D4 should be 
@IF(@ISERROR(B4/C4) ,0,E25). If there's an ERROR calculated by 
the statement B4/C4, ©ISERROR will return TRUE and the first value 
will be displayed. The first value is a 0. That is why using this combina- 
tion of functions works in our challenge. The value returned by an 
ERROR calculation can't be an ERROR indication. If both values in 
the ©IF statement referenced all possible places that an ERROR might 
be displayed, then an ERROR indication can't be isolated. 

Replicate the formula in D4 into D5 and D6, using relative refer- 
ences, and our challenge is solved. See figure 2. 

As we said in the beginning, the solution is simple. But we didn't real-

ly solve the problem we originally posed. Our task was to fix the tem- 
plate so that any ERRORs that showed in column D didn't affect the 
formula in D7. We didn't actually do that. We just ensured that there 
would be no ERRORS displayed in D7. 

One thing worth learning from the challenge is that you can use com- 
binations of functions to solve many problems. In fact, you could prob- 
ably solve our challenge a couple of other ways, using multiple columns 
to help with the isolation. Try it; if you come up with an interesting and 
compact answer, send it in. Remember, though, the trick with VisiCalc is 
to keep the templates as small as possible, which means using as few cells 
as necessary. 

More Logic? Is your appetite sharpened for logic functions? They are 
the least understood of the VisiCalc functions and, as a result, are rarely 
used. That is in part because they aren't exactly intuitive and in part be- 
cause many users haven't learned to think in VisiCalds logical terms. 
Logic functions can turn VisiCalc into a much more effective tool and 
can help make reports more useful. When you can automatically choose 
which of a number of options are displayed or printed, much of the am- 
biguity of many reports disappears. 

Since we've spent most of our time so far discussing logic functions, 
let's look at some of the other logic functions and how they interrelate. 

The logical operators and logic functions shown in your reference 
card are listed in figure 3. 

Logical operators are the foundation of all logic operations. The 
premise is that whenever you compare two values (they can be numbers, 
formulas, cell references, or functions) the comparison will be either 
TRUE or FALSE. The comparisons are less than, equal to, and less than 
or equal to. 

The logic functions use the TRUE or FALSE values that logical op- 
erators return. Logic functions are divided into two types. As we found 
earlier, @IF is the only logic function that returns a value. The remain- 
ing logic functions return either TRUE or FALSE. 

The functions ©AND and ©OR are used similarly. If all values in a 
list are TRUE, ©AND returns TRUE; otherwise it returns FALSE. If 
any value in a list is TRUE, ©OR returns TRUE; otherwise it returns 
FALSE. Remember, a list can be composed of values, cell references, 
formulas, or ranges. 

The functions ©ISERROR and ©ISNA turn ERROR or NA dis- 
plays into TRUE or FALSE. ©NOT turns TRUE into FALSE and vice 
versa. 

Now that all of that is clear, you might reasonably wonder, "So 
what?" How can we use all this? The ©IF function we discussed is, at 
least for VisiCalc, fairly straightforward. We've already seen howi 
©ISERROR and ©ISNA can make ERROR and NA displays useful to 
the logic functions; now we'll look at the other functions. 

Let's start with another example. Coming back to our sales manag- 
er, we could hypothesize that he might want to compare the sales figures 
on different machines he sells against the national average. His template 
for this purpose would look like figure 4.

Columns C and D contain the sales figures for the sales manager's re- 
gion and the national sales average. Column F tells the sales manager at 
a glance which copiers are selling at a rate that exceeds the national aver- 
age. The formula in F3 is -l-C3>D3,F4 is-l-C4> D4,and so on. Because 
the sales manager expects his area to outsell the national average, the for- 
mula in F8 is @AND(F3. . .F6). The fact that there is a FALSE in the 
list (actually, there are two) causes F8 to display FALSE. 

Suppose the formula in F8 had been @0R(F3. . .F6). What would 
the cell have displayed? TRUE. @OR only requires that one TRUE be 
included in the list. The sales managers for slower regions might want to 
know if they have exceeded the national average for sales of any particu- 
lar machine. Of course it is easy to look at our two columns and pick out 
the differences, but imagine if there were fifty or sixty choices in each col- 
umn. In such a case, @0R would be helpful. 

Let's return to our example and see how we can modify the template 
to tell us something else. Assuming that our example has fifty compari- 
sons, how can we total the number of comparisons that are TRUE? 

In cell G3 enter @IF(F3,1,0) and replicate it through G6 (using rela- 
tive reference). For this example, imagine that we have fifty cells in this 
column. In F8 you have only to enter @SUM(G3. . .G6) and you'll have 
the total number of copiers whose sales exceeded the national average. If 
you want to compare those that sold at a rate equal to or greater than the 
national average, you have only to change the comparisons in column F 
to be>= and G8 will tell you any copiers that are selling at a rate that's 
equal to or better than the national average. 

If you were very aggressive and only wanted to know the copiers that 
were selling at a rate less than the national average, you could enter 
@IF(@NOT(F3),1,0) and replicate that. It would take the TRUE dis- 
plays in column F and turn them into FALSE, and all FALSE displays 
into TRUE. Your answer in G8 would now display the number of copi- 
ers that sold at a rate less than the average. Of course you could have 
changed the logical operators in column F to compare for less than (for 
example, in F3: -l-C3< D3).

Functions without Arguments 

©ERROR 
©FALSE 
@NA 
©TRUE 

Figure 5. 



That leaves us with one more type of logic function to discuss. Fig- 
ure 5 shows a list of functions without arguments. 

While the functions shown in figure 5 aren't really logic functions, 
they are modifiers for logic functions. You might notice that the @PI 
function isn't included in our list. That's because pi isn't a logic function; 
it's a mathematical function. 

As we discussed last month, ©ERROR and @NA can be used in de- 
bugging formulas, but they can also be used to key specific answers, espe- 
cially in connection with the ©CHOOSE function. 

INonlogic Logic? ©LOOKUP and ©CHOOSE are search func- 
tions, not logic functions. While it is true that these functions don't use 
logical operators to find a value, like ©IF they return a choice of differ- 
ent values. 

The look-up function is written @LOOKUP(v,range). Choose is writ- 
ten @CHOOSE(v,list). The two functions differ in two ways. First, look- 
up requires a contiguous range. That means a continuous series of cells in 
either a row or column. There should also be a parallel series of values ei- 
ther in the cells directly to the right of the column or directly below the 
row. Choose, on the other hand, requires a list. A list can be composed of 
ranges, values, and cell references mixed together. It doesn't require a 
second series of values. 

The second and most important difference between the look-up and 
choose functions is the location and manner in which each determines 
the value it will return. Lookup takes the value represented by v in the 
look-up statement and looks through the range stated in the second part 
of the look-up statement until it finds a value greater than v (the look-up 
value). It then returns the value in the cell to the right of the previous val- 
ue if the range is a column, or below the previous cell if the range is a 
row. Choose takes the value represented by v (which can be a value, a cell 
reference, or another function) and counts that many values through the 
list and returns that value. For example, if v is 5, choose will return the 
fifth value in the list. If the function is stated: 

@GHOOSE(5,A15. . .A1 7,237,21 ,©AVERAGE(L@23. . .29)) 

the choose statement will return 21. 

Remember that lookup requires two continuous and parallel col- 
umns or rows of information. One is for look-up and one is for data. 
Choose requires only a single series of values, and the values can be in 
any number of locations. 

You can use ©IF as the value in either function to provide true logic 
capability. Either choose or lookup can be the v in an ©IF statement. In 
addition, choose or lookup can be either, or both, of the then and else 
parts of an ©IF formula. Sounds good, but how does it work? 

Let's look at a couple of examples that use lookup and choose. As- 
sume we own a mail order business where people order different combi- 
nations of products. We've decided that we'll ship any package weighing 
up to ten pounds by air freight and anything weighing between ten and 
twenty pounds by normal shipping carrier. We've also decided not to 
ship any boxes that weigh more than twenty pounds. 

Our template should take the weight of a box, decide whether the 
amount is less than or greater than ten pounds, and then apply the per 
pound shipping rate from the specified rate table. The sample template is 
shown in figure 6. 

Note that the rates shown in this template are only examples and 
have no relation to actual shipping rates. 

The function in D5 calculates shipping cost. Before reading any fur- 
ther, why don't you stop and take a shot at solving our problem? It's fair- 
ly simple, and you have enough information. 

Okay, let's see how we can solve this problem. Each time we get a box 
to ship we have to decide whether it weighs more or less than ten pounds. 
If it weighs ten pounds or less we should look in the air shipping rate 
schedule to compute the shipping charge. If the box weighs more than 
ten pounds, we should look in the regular shipping schedule. Given that 



JANUARY 1983 



u n T A u 



167 




information, the answer is easy to figure. The function in D5 that calcu- 
lates shipping cost is: 

@IF(D3<11,@LOOKUP(D3,B10. . .B19) 
*D3,@LOOKUP(D3,E10. . .E19rD3) 

The ©IF function decides which rate table should be used, and the ap- 
propriate lookup takes the weight, finds the appropriate rate, and multi- 
plies the rate times the weight (D3). Simple and elegant. 

What about choose'] Now that you have seen how lookup works, can 
you take the same information and use the choose function to determine 
the shipping cost? You can enter the choose function in D5 or in an 
equivalent cell for comparison. 

The function is: 

@CHOOSE(D3,C10. . ,C19,F10. . .F19)*D3 
Choose takes the weight and counts through the first range, and then the 



second, and so on, until it counts to the correct value. In our example, 
choose counts through the values until it comes to the nineteenth value. 
You'll notice that the list is in different columns than in the look-up state- 
ment. Choose uses the columns that contain the actual shipping rates. 

In our example, both methods calculate the same answer. Normally, 
each function would be better used for solving different types of 
problems. 

Both of these methods are subject to the same rounding problems 
that we discussed in this column two months ago. To see an example, en- 
ter ten pounds in D3 and see how that compares to ten times the ten 
pound rate. You can use the rounding solution in your manual if 
you wish. 

The look-up example could have been accompUshed with a single 
look-up statement rather than with an @IF statement if we hadn't want- 
ed to keep the charts separate. To do this, you would put all of the rates 
in a continuous column (or row) and just use lookup to calculate the 
answer. 

If an amount greater than twenty pounds is entered, the choose func- 
tion will return NA. This is so because the choose function won't be able 
to count past 20. Lookup, in contrast, will continue to use the last ship- 
ping rate. Using lookup, a hundred-pound box will be charged at the 
twenty-pound rate. 

The End of Logic. When trying to solve logical problems (in VisiCalc 
and sometimes in life), the best way to start is to write your problem and 
solution in English and then convert it to VisiCalc. Usually, doing the 
conversion is much simpler than trying to solve the problem mathemati- 
cally first. 

Now you have seen some of the more powerful capabilities of 
VisiCalc. All the functions we've discussed, as well as most of the other 
functions, can be used in conjunction with one another. In fact, VisiCalc 
can accommodate up to nine nested functions. 

The best way of learning to use logic functions is to try them out. In 
fact, that is the best way to learn about VisiCalc. Experiment — you'll be 
amazed at what it can do! 31

Everyone's Guide to Assembly Language, Part 28 

This month's discussion centers on a little-mentioned operational 
mode of the 6502 microprocessor known as BCD, which stands for bi- 
nary coded decimal. 

In previous issues we've looked at arithmetic operations that use bi- 
nary and hexadecimal representations of the numbers involved. Such op- 
erations often require a certain degree of mental translation to produce a 
decimal equivalent. In terms of printing a number in ASCII form, even 
more difficulty is to be expected if you're using your own conversion rou- 
tines, rather than the built-in functions of DOS, Applesoft, and Integer 
Basic. 

The BCD mode greatly simplifies this process by storing numbers in 
one or more byte registers (either memory, X, Y, or the accumulator) in 
a decimal-oriented manner. It does this by using two four-bit groups in 
each byte to represent a digit in base ten. In this way two digits per byte 
can be stored, thus giving a total value range of 0 to 99, versus 0 to 255 
using binary. 

Table 1 provides an example of how the BCD counting scheme goes.

Table 1. 



One of the nice things about hexadecimal notation is that each digit 
of the hex number represents one-half (four bits) of the binary number. 
This is a great help when you must mentally convert from hex to binary 
and back again. BCD is a variation on this theme in which the hex num- 
ber really can be said to equal the decimal value (that is, the decimal and 
hex columns will always match). 

About this time you may be thinking, "Well, that's all very nice, but 
where does the 6502 come into the picture?" 

So far, all we have here is a possible system for storing decimal num- 
bers via our usual hex bytes. The good news is that the 6502 actually sup- 
ports this mode in the addition and subtraction operations. 

That's right. The secret to making it work is to tell the 6502 that you 
wish to operate in this mode. This is done by means of the instruction 
SED, which stands for set decimal mode. Once this instruction has been 
executed, all future add and subtract operations will be done in the BCD 
mode. When you're done, be sure to clear everything back to normal 
with the CLD, for clear decimal mode, instruction. 

Special note: Inadvertent setting of the decimal mode can cause the 
Apple to behave rather strangely and can be most puzzling when you're 



trying to debug program.*^. Reset does not clear the decimal flag (bit 3 of 
the status register). When in doubt do a call -155 or FF65G from the 
Monitor to clear the decimal mode. 

Let's verify that this mode actually works with a sample program:

Using the BRK command is an easy way both to end the program

should get the Monitor break response with a display something like this: 



8009- 



A = 46 X=90 Y = 00 P = 34 S = DE 



Ignoring the rest of the line, when we see the A =46 we know that the

can substitute other numbers for *12' and '34' to verify that it works cor-

In this case, the resuk should be '22'. Again, you may wish to substi- 
tute different values to verify its operation. 

For both addition and subtraction, results of the operations "wrap 
around" in a manner similar to the way hexadecimal calculations do. 
That is to say that 99 + 1 will give a result of '00' (100 less the leading ' 1') 
and 0 — 1 will give '99'. 

Limitations. Like everything else in life, BCD has its tradeoffs and 
warnings. The first involves that vague reference made earlier to every- 
thing working with "legal values." "What's legal?" you may ask. You'll 
note that in table 1 certain hex values, such as $0A, never appear. This 
is because in the BCD mode such a value is "illegal" because it uses a 
digit out of the range of 0 to 9. If you attempt to use such a value in the 
BCD mode, you'll get inaccurate results. 

To add to the fun, note also that the BEQ, BNE and INC, DEC fam- 
ilies of instructions don't work as expected either. The N (sign) and Z 
(zero) flags are all linked to binary operations and not BCD. Thus 01 -I- 
99 will yield 00, but N and Z remain unaffected, since the "true" binary 
result should have been $9A. Also, no provision is made for negative 
numbers (signed arithmetic). How, then, do we test for special condi- 
tions? 



The Carry Flag! The carry flag is the only direct indication of arith- 
metic results in BCD. In addition operations, the carry will be set if the 
result exceeds 99 (overflow). In subtraction, the carry will be cleared if 
the result is less than 0 (underflow). 

In multiple byte operations the carry is used in the same way as it is in 
"normal" hexadecimal arithmetic. 

Common Operations. Since INC and DEC don't perform properly, 
their functions must be implemented by using the ADC and SBC 
instructions:

Printing BCD Values. One of the biggest advantages of BCD is that 
the values are easily printed to the screen or disk. When using hexadeci- 
mal math, some sort of hex to ASCII string decimal conversion routine is 
required. This is then followed by the printing of the digits via some 
string print routine. In BCD, only a minimal conversion is needed, and 
the printing is done fairly easily. 

The easiest way to print a number is to use one of the Monitor rou- 
tines. PR BYTE (SFDDA), for example, prints the contents of the accu- 
mulator as a hex byte. Here's a routine that takes two BCD values from 
memory and prints the sum:

It is important to notice that in each routine the CLD is used to clear 
the decimal modefte/ore calHng PRBYTE or PRNTAX. This is so be- 
cause the Monitor needs the normal binary mode to calculate screen ad- 
dresses and positions properly. If you call the Monitor with the BCD 
mode set, strange things will happen when the text reaches the end of the 
line or the screen needs to be scrolled and the Monitor routines attempt 
to calculate where to put the next line of text. 

If you don't want to use the Monitor byte print routines or, for what- 
ever reason, just want to create the ASCII characters yourself, the con-

versions are straightforward and COUT (SFDED for character output — 
usually pronounced "C-out") can be used directly. 

The only real obstacle is how to convert the BCD digits to their 
ASCII equivalents. As it happens, this is even easier to do than you 
might at first suppose. Consider table 2. 

From looking at table 2, we can see that the lower digit of the ASCII 
value corresponds to the digit encoded in the BCD format and, coinci- 
dentally enough, to the number itself to be printed. If there was a way of 
adding $B0 to the value for the digit to be printed, we'd have just the 
value we needed to send to COUT to print the appropriate character. 

To add #$B0 to the BCD values shown would normally require the 
usual CLC, ADC instructions. There is a more elegant (that is, shorter) 
way, however. You may remember that the 'ORA' (for logical OR func- 
tion) can be used as a mask to perform an overlaylike operation. Here's 
how a possible ORA operation would appear 



Accumulator: 
ORA #$B0: 



0000 0110 
1011 0000 



Result- 



ion 0110 



($06 BCD) 



($86 = ASCII "6") 



What if the upper BCD digit is involved? The procedure then is first 
to shift the upper four bits "down" to the lower nibble position: 



BCD value: 

LSR 

LSR 

LSR 

LSR 



0110 0000 
0011 0000 
0001 1000 
0000 1100 
0000 0110 



Result: 



0000 0110 



($60 BCD) 



($06 BCD) 



Ah, you ask, what if both digits possible are indicated by the BCD 
value? The answer here is first to shift out the lower nibble, as was just 
shown, and to print the ASCII character arrived at. Then the original 



value is reloaded into the accumulator and the upper nibble is masked 
out. This can be done using the 'AND' instruction, which has the ability 
to clear a designated portion of a byte to zeros. For example: 



Accumulator: 
AND#$FO: 

Result #1: 
ORA#$B0: 



0101 0110 
0000 1111 

0000 0110 
1011 0000 



Result #2: 1011 0110 

Here, then, is the complete routine:

The CLD is done at the beginning just to emphasize that the BCD 
mode is not required here since the digit is presumed to exist already in 
MEM and no arithmetic operations are anticipated. Remember that the 
BCD mode is only required during the actual addition or subtraction op- 
erations. Although the BCD mode would have no harmful effect on the 
AND or ORA operations, COUT would certainly take offense at being 
called while the BCD mode was still in effect. 

Lines 12 through 16 get the original BCD value from memory and 
then shift it left four times to move the upper nibble to the lower posi- 
tion. At this point the ORA #$B0 is done to convert the value in the ac- 
cumulator to the proper ASCII value, at which point the JSR COUT on 
line 18 prints the first digit. Line 19 retrieves the original value again, af- 
ter which the AND #$0F clears the upper digit to D' and the ASCII con- 
version is completed and printed as before. 

The remainder of the routine is identical to the previous example 
program. 

When run, this program wOl provide visual feedback as to what hap- 
pens each time a key is pressed. It will show the buffer being updated 
each time as well as the new POSN value for each digit entered. 

Conclusions. The Binary Coded Decimal mode of the 6502 can be 
convenient for a variety of reasons. The most frequent use is to facilitate 
input and output, particularly for scientific instrumentation. 

A number of points should be kept in mind when using the BCD 
mode: 

1. The mode should be set only for arithmetic processes that use 
BCD values, such as addition and subtraction. 

2. Only legal values are allowed. Values outside the expected range 
will generate inaccurate results. 

3. The BCD mode should be cleared as soon as possible when arith- 
metic operations are completed so as to avoid possible complications 
with other software in the Apple that neither expects, nor checks for, the 
BCD mode. 

4. Reset does not clear the decimal mode of the 6502. Only the CLD 
instruction does. You can also clear the mode by means of a call —155 or 
an FF95G from the Monitor. 

5. The N and Z flags are unreliable as a means of detecting the re- 
sults of comparisons or of increment/decrement operations. Only the 
carry should be used to detect the results of such operations. 

6. The carry will be set for results greater than 99 (overflow) and 
cleared for results less I'lan 0 (underflow). 

7. BCD operations do "wrap around." That is, 99 -1-01 = 00 and 00 
- 01 = 99. 

Special Note: These are some general rules to help in programs us- 
ing the decimal mode of the 6502. There is only one notable exception 
that may on occasion prove useful. The test for zero (BNE, BEQ) can be 
used when counting down in the BCD mode. For example, 

SED 
SEC 

LDA #$01 
SBC #$01 
BEQ DONE 

would work, whereas, 

SED 
CLC 

LDA #$99 
ADC #$01 
■ BEQ DONE 

would not. 

It might be an interesting challenge for you to use the information 
given in this column and previous issues to try to write a routine that 
would add two Applesoft strings together using the BCD mode and re- 
turn the result in a third string. This would provide a way of extending 
the normal precision of Applesoft for mathematical operations requir- 
ing more than nine digits, a problem that unfortunately does not hinder 
my personal checkbook program.

JANUARY 1983 



177 



BY PAUL LUTUS AMD PHIL THOMPSOn 



Last month's introduction to GraForth's three-dimensional graph- 
ics demonstrated some straightforward methods for manipulating 3-D 
images. With a better understanding of how GraForth handles things 
internally, we can create some interesting new effects. 

Remember that using 3-D graphics is a two-step process: First the 
Image Editor is used to create a 3-D image in memory; then GraForth's 
3-D commands are used to display the image as an object on the screen, 
with a given position, size, and orientation. The object commands do not 
affect the image in memory; they only change the way it is displayed. 

For some 3-D animations, you may want to have several images in 
memory at one time. In order to keep track of what free areas of mem- 
ory are available, it's handy to know how the images are stored. 

A 3-D image is made up of a number of line entries, one for each 
move or draw in the image. Each line entry uses four bytes of memory. 
The format for the entry is described fully on page B-6 of the GraForth 
manual. Briefly, the first byte determines color and whether the entry is a 
move or a draw, and the next three bytes specify the X, Y, and Z posi- 
tions for the point in space. The end of a 3-D image is marked with a 255 
(hex $FF) in memory immediately after the last entry. The length in 
bytes of a 3-D image is four bytes multiplied by the number of entries 
plus one more byte for the end-of-image marker. 

From the Image Editor, the List and Enter options show the address 
in memory for the beginning of each line entry. An image starting at ad- 
dress 2816 will have line entries at 2816, 2820, 2824, and so on. The last 
address shown in the listing is for the beginning of the last line entry. The 
end-of-image marker will be four bytes after this. The byte immediately 
after the end-of-image marker (five bytes after the last listed address) is 
the next byte free for use. 

Loading the Inwge Editor every time you want to find the length of a 
3-D image can be cumbersome. The following short word definitions will 
also do the job. With a 3-D image already in memory, end.SD can be 
used to find the next free location after the image, and length.SD will re- 
turn the length of the image in bytes: 

: END.3D 
BEGIN 
DUP 

PEEK 255 <> 
WHILE 

4 + 
REPEAT 
1 + ; 
: LENGTH. 3D 
DUP END.3D 
SWAP - ; 

To use end.3D, simply place the starting address of the image on the 
stack, then call end. 3D. The routine scans through the list of four-byte 
line entries until it finds the 255 end-of-image marker. It then adds 1 to 
this address, leaving the address of the next free byte on the stack. 

Length. 3D is called the same way. It uses end.3D to find the next free 
address, then subtracts the original starting address from this value to 
find the length of the image. 

Here is an example that uses end.3D and length.3D to find the length 
of the XYZ image stored on the GraForth system disk. First, load the 
XYZ image into memory starting at location 2816: 

CR 132 PUTC PRINT " BLOAD XYZA2816 " CR 

To find the next free address after the XYZ image, enter 

2816 END.3D . 

End.3D returns 2877, the address of the next free area of memory. This 
means that the XYZ end-of-image (255) marker must be one location be- 
fore 2877: 

2876 PEEK . 

This should display a 255. 

The length of the XYZ image can be found by typing 



2816 LENGTH. 3D . 

In this case, you should get a length of 61. 

The Keep command in the Image Editor allows you to save 3-D 
images to disk, one image per binary file. If you're working with a graph- 
ics program that uses several images, it's often easier to combine all of 
the images into one disk file. By keeping track of image-length informa- 
tion, you can bload several images into memory one immediately after 
another, then bsave the images back to disk as a single binary file. This 
can save a lot of space on a CTOwded disk and make it easier to load sev- 
eral images at one time. The 3-D bat used in Die Fledermaus in the dem- 
onstration program is an example of this. Three separate images making 
up the bat are stored together in the binary file Bat. 

Another technique is to combine two 3-D images together into one 
larger image. We can create a "double" image by concatenating the XYZ 
image with the Cube image, also on the GraForth disk. First, let's get the 
XYZ shape displayed on the screen: 

OBJERASE 

0 OBJECT 2816 OBJADR 
0 40 20 24 WINDOW ERASE 
12 SCALE 4 SCALZ 80 YPOS 
10 XROT 20 YROT DRAW 

We can bload the Cube image right over the end of XYZ, so that the 
first line entry in the cube overwrites the end-of-image marker for XYZ. 
This leaves a single image with a set of line entries for XYZ and a set for 
the cube, with one end-of-image marker left at the end. 

We know that the XYZ end-of-image marker is at location 2876, so 
this is where we load the cube: 

CR 132 PUTC PRINT " BLOAD CUBE,A2876 " CR 
0 OBJECT DRAW 

Other unusual effects are possible by changing line entries from a 
running program, moving end-of-image markers, and so on. Keep in 
mind, however, that the image in memory is also used by GraForth 
when erasing old objects from the screen before redrawing. If you mod- 
ify images while displaying them, you might affect what lines from old 
objects are erased and what lines aren't. 

Another internal aspect of 3-D graphics worth looking at is the 
Image Data Map (described on page B-4 of the GraForth manual), 
which stores the parameters used to orient and draw objects on the 
screen. (A more accurate name would be Object Data Map, but we'll 
stick to the name used in the manual.) The map keqjs track of all of the 3- 
D parameters for sixteen objects for three different functions: erasing the 
old picture, keeping track of the picture on the other graphics saeen, and

drawing the new picture. The manual calls these data sets Undraw, In- 
terim, and Draw. 

Last month's column included a program that used variables to keep 
track of 3-D parameters. However, the Image Data Map already stores 
this same information and can be used the same way. The technique is to 
determine the address for the desired parameter of a given object, then 
take a peek at that address to find the current value of the parameter. 

The Image Data Map is first broken into the three data sets, with six- 
teen object tables for each data set and sixteen bytes for each object ta- 
ble. Table 1 shows the format for object tables. 

Here's an example to show how it all works. Suppose you want to 
find the current X position (xpos) for object 5. Start with the base ad- 
dress for the Draw data set at 6400. Multiply the object number by 16 
and add this to the base address: 

6400 + (5 * 16) = 6480 

Now add the relative byte for the xpos command, which is 7: 

6480 + 7 = 6487 

By this procedure you can determine that 6487 is the address that 
stores the X position for object 5. You can find the current value by 
peeking at this address. 

Using this technique, you can define words to update a 3-D param- 
eter by peeking its value, adding some offset, then resetting the param- 
eter. Here is a word that will increase the X position for object 5 by two 
pixels: 

: INCX 
5 OBJECT 

6487 PEEK 2 + XPOS ; 

The following is another version of the Roll, tetra program shown last 
month. It uses the Image Data Map to update parameters so separate 
variables are not needed: 

0 VARIABLE OBJ ( Object number ) 

VARIABLE DIR ( Scale direction larger or smaller?) 

: FIND ( Find address of parameter given relative byte: ) 

OBJ 16 * + ( Object number * 16 + relative byte ) 

6400 + PEEK ; ( Add base address and peek current value ) 



UPDATE.TETRA 

1 FIND 3 + XROT ( Increase X rotation by 3 ) 

2 FIND 5 + YROT ( Increase Y rotation by 5 ) 

7 FIND 6 + XPOS ( Increase X position by 6 ) 

8 FIND 3 + YPOS ( Increase Y position by 3 ) 
DIR IF (If scale is increasing: ) 

9 FIND 1 + SCALE ( Increase scale by 1 ) 

9 FIND 18 = IF 0 - > DIR THEN ( Change direction? ) 

ELSE 

9 FIND 1 - SCALE ( Decrease scale by 1 ) 
THEN ;

UPDATE.TETRA 
DRAW 
LOOP ; 



Set object number ) 
Initialize parameters ) 



Set scale direction ) 
Start loop ) 

( Set new parameters 

( Draw object ) 



( Loop back 



Special provision is made to work with any object, regardless of what 
object number is used. The object number is kept in the variable OBJ. 
Note the new word find. This takes the relative byte for a 3-D parameter 
from the stack, finds the address for that parameter, and peeks the cur- 
rent value. 

To run the prograrri, first bload the tetrahedron image into memory 

CR 132 PUTC PRINT " BLOAD TETRA,A2816 " 
OBJ ERASE 

0 OBJECT 2816 OBJADR 
Now store the object number into OBJ and call Roll.tetra: 



0 - >OBJ 
ROLL.TETRA 

If you want to use other images with Roll.tetra, you may need to adjust 
the scale so that the object fits on the screen. 

Another aspect of 3-D graphics to consider is the way in which 
images are transformed into objects on the screen. The three-dimension- 
al mathematical method on page B-5 of the manual describes some of the 
technical wizardry performed on the points using matrices. Understand- 
ing the details of the math isn't really important. What is important is the 
order in which the operations are performed 

The 3-D transformations are performed in this order. 

1. X, Y, and Z translation 

2. X, Y, and Z scaling 

3. X rotation 

4. Y rotation 

5. Z rotation 

This means that the 3-D points in an object are first translated, and 
then the translated points are scaled. These new points are rotated 
around the X, Y, and Z axes in order. Actually, GraForth does steps two 
through five simultaneously, though the formula used treats the objects 
as if the transformations were done one at a time. 

The order of the steps affects rotations most noticeably. Consider an 
object that has been set to 30 xrot 20 yrot. The X rotation is performed 
first. Remember that the X axis passes through the object from left to 
right. A rotation around this axis tips the top of the object forward and 
the bottom back. The Y rotation is done next. But since the X rotation 
occurred first, the Y axis has been tipped forward, along with the points 
in the object. The Y rotation will actually be done on this new tipped 
axis. Similarly, any Z rotation that follows will rotate around an axis that 
has already been tipped by both X and Y rotations. 

Suppose you want to create an animation of a 3-D spaceship that 
continually banks or rolls as it flies across the screen. This rolling should 
be the same regardless of which way the ship is facing. Before designing 
the ship with the Image Editor, you need to know which axis (X, Y, orZ) 
to use for the rotation. The Z axis is the proper choice for this kind of 
situation. The rotations around the X and Y axes will first set the ship 
(and the Z axis) facing the desired direction, then the Z axis rotation will 
perform the rolling in that direction. 

This is best demonstrated using the program Play. Compile Play in- 
to memory and execute it. 

READ PLAY " 
PLAY 

Select the 3-D shape XYZ from the disk. When the object appears, 
rotate it a little so that you can see all three arrows: Press 2, right arrow, 
F, 1, right arrow, F. The white arrow pointing from back to front corre- 
sponds to the Z axis. Start the object rotating around this axis at a good 
rate by pressing 3 and then pressing the right arrow key about six times. 
Notice that the rotation does occur around the white arrow. 

Now press either 1 or 2 and an arrow key, wait a bit, and then press 
F. This changes the rotation around the X or Y axis. Note that, even 
though the white arrow is now facing a new direction, the Z rotation is 
still around the white arrow. This is so because the X and Y rotations tip 
the Z axis before the Z rotation is done. 

Because of these rotation gymnastics, it is handy occasionally to have 
the ability to transpose a 3-D image in memory, changing X coordinates 
into Y coordinates, Y to Z, Z to X, or whatever. This has the effect of 
turning an image around so that it lies in a new direction along the 
three axes. 

The following word definition does just that. It reads each line entry 
of an image in memory, plucks out the values for the (X,Y,Z) point, and 
places them back into the image in a new order 

VARIABLE ADDR 
VARIABLE FIRST 
VARIABLE SECOND 
VARIABLE THIRD 
VARIABLE X 
VARIABLE Y 
VARIABLE Z 



TRANSPOSE 

- >THIRD - > SECOND - >FIRST ( Save new order ) 

- > ADDR ( Save starting address ) 
BEGIN 

ADDR PEEK 255 <> ( While not end-of-image: ) 

WHILE 

ADDR 1 + PEEK - > X ( Peek X, Y, and Z values 

from image ) 

ADDR 2 + PEEK - > Y 
ADDR 3 + PEEK - >Z 

X ADDR FIRST + POKE ( Poke values back into 

image in new order ) 

Y ADDR SECOND + POKE 
Z ADDR THIRD + POKE 

ADDR 4 H — > ADDR ( Increment address to next 



line entry 



REPEAT 



Before calling Transpose, four values should be on the stack. They 
are the image address, the new X place, the new Y place, and the new Z 
place. The numbers for the places should be 1, 2, and 3, in the desired or- 
der 1 for X, 2 for Y, and 3 forZ. For example, to trade theX and Y co- 
ordinates in an image at location 2816, you would enter 

2816 2 1 3 TRANSPOSE 

To run Transpose without exchanging coordinates (a do-nothing op- 
eration), you would type: 

2816 1 2 3 TRANSPOSE 

The numbers 1, 2, and 3 must be on the stack in some order or the 
image will be destroyed. For example, typing 

2816 2 2 2 TRANSPOSE 

copies all three coordinates in turn into the Y coordinate position, with 
the Z coordinate copied last, and loses the old Y value. 

The concepts we've been dealing with are more than isolated ideas. 
They can be combined to produce interesting new animations. Now let's

look at a space shuttle simulation program that makes extensive use of 3- 
D graphics. The program shows the shuttle flying into view over the 
earth, performing some rotations, releasing a satellite, and flying away. 
The graphics dumps in figure 1 comprise a storyboard of the animation. 
The simulation makes use of a number of concepts, including multiple 3- 
D objects, undraw, GraForth's Image Data Table, and Z axis rotations. 

TTie first step is to create the shuttle using the Image Editor. Below are 
the line entries that make up the shuttle. Read the Image Editor onto the 
word library (read" imageditor "), run the program, and type Z to zero 
any image (or garbage) that may be in memory. You can set a viewing 
angle before entering points. Enter a scale of 14, an X rotation of 20, and 
a Y rotation of 32. Now press E to enter the points. The general shape of 
the shuttle should become apparent after the first fifteen or twenty line 
entries. When asked for color at each line entry, just press return. 

Note that the shape is somewhat complicated. This gives the shuttle 
greater detail, but it requires more time to draw. To speed the program 
up, you may want to design a simpler shuttle later.

After creating the shuttle, press K to save the image to disk. Use the 
file name Shuttle. At this point, you might want to use the Play program 
to check the shuttle image more closely. Remember to forget the Image 
Editor program {forget X) before typing read " Play ". From Play, you 
can easily see the shuttle from all angles. 

The next step is to create the satellite. This is a simple shape created 
with the Profile program. (Profile is described in greater detail on pages 
8-18 to 8-21 in the GraForth manual.) Use forget to remove any other 
programs from the word library, then type: 



READ 
RUN

Enter X,Y pair (end = "E") 

Enter X,Y pair (end = "E") 

Enter X,Y pair (end = "E") 

Enter X,Y pair (end = "E") 



The program will generate a small twelve-sided, diamondlike shape. 
This is the satellite. As prompted, save the image to disk with the name 
Satellite.

The shuttle flies! To run the program again, you only need to type 

Fly.shuttle. 

Let's take a closer look at how each of the words works: 

Setup simply loads the images into memory and selects them as 3-D 
objects. Notice that the satellite object is also set to 0 scale. Since the sat- 
ellite has been selected, this will prevent it from being drawn at the first 
frame of the animation. 

Param is called by later words. It reads a parameter value from the 
GraForth Image Data Map much like the word find (which we dis- 
cussed earlier) did. However, param removes two numbers from the 
stack, one to select the object number and the other to select the relative 
byte for the desired parameter. 

Fly.in begins the simulation. It first clears the screen, then uses turtle 
graphics to draw an arc along the bottom of the screen. This is an out- 
line of the earth. It sets the initial orientation for the shuttle, then uses a 
do-loop to draw the shuttle rq)eatedly while changing its scale and posi- 
tion. Each parameter is updated by using param to read its current value 
from GraForth's Image Data Map, adding an offset, and then resetting 
the parameter. 

Note that undraw is being used to speed up drawing. An interesting 
tradeoff occurs here: The shuttle is a complicated shape and is being 
drawn to a fairly large size. Both of these contribute to slower drawing 
times. Undraw can be used to speed up the animation, but a large block 
size is needed to cover the object. Erasing a large area also takes time. 
Even though the block size covers nearly the entire screen (39 19 blksize), 
undraw is still faster. 

Rotate! performs two rotations on the shuttle, one after another. The 
first rotation rolls the ship around theZ axis to an upright position. The 
shuttle was designed with its body along the Z axis so that this rotation 
could be done regardless of which way the shuttle was facing. The sec- 
ond rotation simply tips the shuttle down for a better view. 

Release causes the satellite, which is 1 object, to appear (magically!) 
in the shuttle's cargo hold. The satellite then moves up twenty pixels 
while the shuttle moves down, lifting the satellite away from the shuttle. 
The drawing time is a little slower here because undraw is not used. If it 
were used, it would have to be called for both 0 object and 1 object, since 
calling undraw prevents the automatic erasing of only the currently se- 
lected object. 

Drift.away causes the satellite to drift quickly into the distance and 
disappear. Note that the shuttle (0 object) is referenced once before the 
satellite is moved. This puts the same view of the shuttle on both graph- 
ics screens, preventing residual motion. Undraw is not used here, be- 
cause the satellite shape is simple, small, and therefore fast. 

Rotate! rotates the shuttle into position for fly. out. 

Fly.out again adjusts scale, xpos, and ypws to fly the shuttle away and 
out of sight. 

Fly.shuttle performs the entire animation by simply calling each of 
the segments in turn. 

This shuttle simulation program was designed to give you a better 
idea of how more detailed three-dimensional animations are im- 
plemented. This should help make the creation of 3-D graphics displays 
less mysterious.

or years to get a telephone installed. In this country, we take for granted 
what people overseas are awestruck by. 

This nationwide web of communications gives us almost instantane- 
ous access to information, regardless of where that information may 
have been generated or stored. A wide variety of information goods and 
services can be used by individuals, small businesses, and Fortune 500 
firms. 

There are databases to draw information from; electronic mail for 
sending digital memos and letters around the nation in seconds; termi- 
nal programs to transmit and receive text files and programs, business 
data, and mail; and even means to use computers and computer lan- 
guages not normally available in the home. 

There are community bulletin board services (BBSs) through which 
people can exchange insights and information electronically and exciting 
new briefcase-sized gadgets that can store messages and send informa- 
tion to any computer that can be reached over the telephone. 

In this series of articles, we'll look at the world of telecommunica- 
tions. We'll examine how modulator/demodulators (modems) change 
electronic impulses into sound and back again, and we'll consider how 
data transmission speed, or baud rate, is important. We'll also discuss 
specific brands of modems and the software that makes them work to 
their utmost. 

We'll look at national networks and at various terminals that con- 
nect directly to the telephone and can correspond directly with your Ap- 
ple. We'll also get acquainted with community bulletin boards you can 
talk to through your computer. (You may even want to consider estab- 
lishing and operating one yourself.) 

We'll examine word processing programs that have electronic mail 
capability, see how the many brands of terminal software compare, and 
discuss on-line databases that allow you to use your Apple to gather in- 
formation from around the world. 

So let's get started. 

Hello Central. The telephone uses practically all the same principles 
now that it did when Alexander Graham Bell invented it. There have 
been many improvements, certainly, but the technology of a vibrating 
diaphragm sending electricity through a wire to vibrate another dia- 
phragm remains the same. 

Whether the means be copper wire, glass fibers, miaowave dish, or 
satellite, under the seas or over them, the end is still to carry that vibra- 
tion-generated electricity through space at the speed of light. 

The fact that small computers have become so widespread means 
that they will soon be accommodated in ways only dreamed of today. 
Hotels, for example, are already investigating feasible methods of pro- 
viding computers in their guests' rooms. And various companies are 
working to perfect voice and data transmission from telephones aboard 
aircraft, at a projected cost of around $7 per minute. 

In the wake of recent Supreme Court and government rulings, a 
number of telecommunications networks now offer telephone commu- 
nications at a lower cost than the Bell System. Such firms as MCI, 
Sprint, and Western Union offer some 15 percent to 50 percent lower 
rates than Bell companies, although usually only on calls to and from 
major metropolitan areas. The major savings are on evenings and 
weekends. 

MCI, for example, charges $10 per month for service to a residential 
user. To use the system, you telephone a local number via Touch-Tone. 
On connection, another distinct tone sounds, and you key in your code 
number followed by the number you want to reach. If the area you're 
telephoning is one that's served, your call goes through. 

Transmission quality is sometimes too poor for sending data, how- 
ever; and to make a call through a modem that doesn't offer Touch-Tone 
capability you need to dial the number separately. If you're located out- 
side normal dialing areas, you may have to pay a premium to telephone 
the microwave number. So it's a good idea to try to determine ahead of 
time whether using a telephone communications network will actually 
save you money once you add on the extra monthly fee. 

Modems. Once the computer existed, it wasn't long before someone 
asked why it wouldn't be possible to send computer data across the mil- 
lions of miles of telephone lines. Since both telephones and computers 
communicate through electricity, this was a logical possibility to 



consider. 

If binary data were to be transmitted through a telephone wire, how- 
ever, the transmission medium would have to be within the frequencies 
of the human voice. After all, the voice is what the Bell System was origi- 
nally developed for. 

A modulator was invented to take the binary computer codes of 0 and 
1 and change them into something that could be transmitted over the 
telephone lines. A demodulator was designed to read the modulated code 
back into binary form upon its arrival at the receiving computer. The re- 
sultant device was called a modem. 

An on-line modem has to be wired into the telephone lines. In many 
cases, on-line modems dial and answer automatically, as programmed. 
These devices are the ones that answer with a high-pitched tone if you 
happen to telephone a friend or business acquaintance whose computer 
is programmed to answer. 

The acoustic coupler or acoustic modem uses the handset of the tele- 
phone. That is, the computer talks into the mouthpiece and listens to the 
sound from the earpiece. The user must dial the telephone and place the 
handset into the cradle. 

Noise is a problem for these acoustic devices. The carbon granules in 
telephone mouthpieces tend to "pack" and lose their transmission capa- 
bility. This can be corrected by shaking or tapping the mouthpiece or by 
replacing the carbon mike with another type of microphone (such as No- 
vation's Super Mike) that doesn't pack. 

Most modems are connected to the computer by means of an RS- 
232-C serial interface. This often requires that a serial card be connected 
to the Apple and thus means an addition^ investment of $100 or more. 
(Both the Novation Apple-Cat II and thfe Micromodem II from Hayes 
Microcomputer Products incorporate serial boards, so there's no extra 
expense.) 

The recently released Dual-Comm Plus from Bit 3 adds two serial 
I/O interfaces to the Apple on one circuit board. Each one can be set to 
respond to a different slot number, or both can be used from the same 
slot location. Baud rates range from 50 to 19,200. You can hook a

modem to one port and connect your printer to the other. 

Baud. Bai4d rate is the speed at which data is transmitted. Dividing 
the baud rate figure by ten gives you a rough idea of how many charac- 
ters per second are being transferred. Thus, 1 10 baud sends eleven char- 
acters per second (cps), 300 baud is equivalent to thirty characters per 
second, and 1200 baud corresponds to 120 characters per second. Some 
expensive machines operate at 4800, 9600, or even higher baud rates. 

Some special equipment for the deaf (Telecommunications Devices 
for the Deaf, or TDD) operates at 45.5 baud, or Baudot. Tdecommuni- 
cations offers deaf people a whole new world of communication. Con- 
trollers such as the BSR, for example, blink the lights in a room to alert 
deaf users whenever there's a call for them on the terminal. 

On personal computers, the 0 to 300 baud modem, known as a Bell 
103 compatible, is probably the most common. Modems of this type are 
available with provision for originate only, answer only, and originate 
and answer. Be wary of cut-rate modems that may only originate or an- 
swer, unless you're certain you'll never need the corresponding feature. 

If you plan to send a great deal of data or textual material through 
the telephone line, the extra speed of a 1200 baud device can save you 
money in the long run. Even though that's four times as fast as the com- 
mon 300 baud, the price to connect up to various services is often only a 
little more for 1200 baud than for 300. 

Conversely, if you just want to check into your local community 
bulletin board service occasionally, or you just like to chat on the Source 
or CompuServe's CB simulators, you have little need for a 1200 baud 
modem. After all, you can only type so fast. 

A Duplex Built for Two. Duplex, or fidl duplex, describes a situation 
in which there can be simultaneous two-way communication between in- 
dividuals or computers. In half duplex only one person can communi- 
cate at a time, such as when a ham radio operator must say "over" to sig- 
nal a correspondent that it's her turn to talk. 

Older rotary dial telephones rely on pulse dialing. Pulse dialing sends 
a pulse over the wire to select a number. That's the click you hear when 
you turn the dial. Newer telephones use tone dialing, such as Touch- 
Tone, which generates a tone at a certain frequency depending on which 
button is pressed. Tone dialing is required for using long-distance micro- 
wave networks, for example, MCI. 

If you plan to have your Apple use such microwave networks auto- 
matically, you may want to purchase a modem that will tone dial. The 
Novation Apple-Cat II and the Bell 212A-compatible Hayes Stack 
Smartmodem will. Many other modems won't. 

A few terminal programs (they're called this because they enable you 
to use your Apple as a communications terminal) allow you to turn off 
the carrier tone. {Data Capture 4.0 for the Hayes Micromodem II is one 
such program.) You can then use the Touch-Tone buttons for micro- 
wave. If you don't have a telephone that will tone dial, you might want 
to consider buying an inexpensive tone generator that screws into the 
mouthpiece of a rotary handset, assuming that your local telephone sys- 
tem can accommodate such a device. 

More Baud Rates. The Bell 103-compatible modem is any modem 
that will accept baud rates of between 0 and 300. A Bell 202A -compati- 
ble device is a modem that's capable of sending or receiving 1200 baud, 
but it is only able to use half-duplex and doesn't offer 300 baud. In addi- 
tion, 202A devices can't take advantage of the vast majority of networks 
for the average user and thus aren't heavily supported by software. 

The 212A -compatible modem allows full-duplex and is compatible 
with practically all services. This type of device has both 0 and 300 baud 
and 1200 baud capability. Apparently the 1200 baud segment is the 
expensive part of the device: the 0 to 300 part hardly adds to the cost at 
all and helps make the 212A attractive to buyers. The higher 1200 baud 
rate is really the minimum baud capability you would want for business 
purposes. 

The 1200 baud speed is the clearest high-speed data transmission rate 
available using regular telephone lines. It's easy to lose information at 
this speed, though, so if you're operating a terminal program at 1200 
baud it's a good idea to be sure it has error-checking capability. 

The maximum data transmission speed for most telephone lines is 
4800 baud. This is accomplished by means of special equipment that will 
send four 1200 baud signals at one time. Because of noise on the line and 



other factors, the transmission quality varies. 

Beyond this, a variety of very high speed rates of transmission are 
possible. For example, the capability to transmit from 1.544 megabits per 
second (mps) to 60 megabits per second is available now or soon will be 
for large businesses, governments, and other major users. 

Now that we've discussed some of the basics of data transmission 
and looked in general at various types of modems, let's take a closer look 
at two of the more popular Apple-compatible modems. 

Novation Apple-Cat II. The Apple-Cat II is a multifunction modem 
that can be upgraded to interface with any 1200 baud modem. The basic 
unit from Novation consists of a 0 to 300 baud modem, a 1200 baud Bell 
202 modem, a built-in serial card, and communications software. Re- 
member, the Bell 202 format is not yet well supported for the microcom- 
puter environment. For an additional sum, you can buy the Bell 212A 
connector. This is the 1200 baud format that is well supported. The 212A 
connector may be plugged into a slot or, if all slots are filled, laid atop the 
power supply. 

The basic Cat II unit consists of a telephone line connector, Touch- 
Tone or pulse dialing, a handset connector, a tape recorder control, and 
dial tone/busy detection. The circuit board plugs into a controller slot 
the same way that any board does. The telephone line is plugged into a 
connector that dangles outside the case of the Apple. The optional hand- 
set snaps into a second connector. (This second connector will accept any 
standard handset jack.) 

Boot the communications disk that's included in the package and 
you're ready to use 50 or 75 baud; 110 or 150 baud for TWX or Telex; 
300, 600, and 1200 baud in Bell 202 configuration; nineteen selectable 
functions from the keyboard with a separate keypress, including auto 
tone and pulse dial, auto answer, and auto redial; and a terminal pro- 
gram with sending and receiving capability. 

The Apple-Cat II is not meant to replace your normal telephone, but 
it can certainly supplement it. For run-of-the-mill incoming calls or when 
the Apple is being used for something else, you should have an inexpen- 
sive telephone plugged into a Y-jack. 

The Apple-Cat II is fully programmable for those who are capable 
assembly language programmers. It can be programmed to do such 
things as automatic dialing for the handset operation. If a number is 
busy, the unit can pass on to the next number in a sequence or redial, de- 
pending on how it's programmed. 

In addition, the Apple-Cat II has options: an expansion interface for 
RS-232C, a telephone handset, a BSR AC line modulator, a Touch-Tone 
LSI receiver, firmware for the deaf user, and a cassette recorder interface 
cable. If you have the Touch-Tone option, you can program in such 
things as remote controls through the BSR power modules or operation 
of an attached cassette recorder. And the Baudot firmware option sets 
baud at 45.5 for Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf 

Novation operates a free bulletin board twenty-four hours a day at 
the company's home office. 

Hayes Stack Smartmodem 1200. The Bell 212A-compatible Smart- 
modem 1200 allows 0 to 300 baud or 1200 baud capability for less than 
seven hundred dollars. It has built-in auto-dial and auto-answer capabil- 
ity. In addition, it can use Touch-Tone dialing, pulse dialing, or a com- 
bination of the two. Busy signals and wrong numbers can be brought to 
your attention, and, if you like, the Smartmodem 1200 can automati- 
cally redial the last number called. 

An earlier version of the Smartmodem has the same adaptability as 
the Smartmodem 1200 but offers only 300 baud. 

A companion unit to the Smartmodem is the Stack Chronograph, 
RS-232C -compatible with small computers. It is a quartz-crystal 
clock/calendar that can tie time to your computer. The Chronograph in- 
corporates a backup battery that will keep it on time for as much as a 
year's worth of power failure or disconnection. 

Hayes released its first communications software last summer, 
intended for use with the Micromodem II. The Micromodem II was de- 
signed specifically for the Apple, and as such it has a built-in serial card. 
A 1 10 to 300 baud device that can only be used on pulse circuits, the 
Micromodem II has a very good reputation for high quality. Because of 
the Micromodem II's dependability, many of the terminal programs that 
have automatic features are designed to operate with it.

Hayes and Novation are perhaps the best known modem manufac- 
turers in the Apple world. Another company, Universal Data Systems, 
offers a 2 12LP model, powered by the telephone line, 1200 baud only, for 
about five hundred dollars. They also have a 212A model with both 300 
and 1200 baud for about seven hundred dollars. And a 300/1200 baud 
unit is available from Cermetek for around six hundred dollars. 

There are numerous other suppliers, so look around. 

Eighty-Column Cards. Communications consultant Dr. David A. 
Lingwood of Action Research Northwest (distributor of Zardax, a word 
processor that contains its own communications system in eighty 
columns) says that any terminal intended for serious use needs dghty col- 
umns. But the Apple user hotline at one state university strongly advises 
against using an eighty-column card with communications software on 
the Apple. 

The Micromodem 11, for example, apparently has some problems 
with eighty-column cards. The control codes it uses are, in many cases, 
the same ones that the cards use. Videx even offers a special EPROM 
chip of protocols for using the Micromodem II with its eighty-col- 
umn card. 

The Full-View Board from Bit 3 can be operated with Southwestern 
Data's ASCII Express: The Professional. This board opens up the possi- 
bility of programming a blank EPROM chip to allow a user-designed 
character set. This means that a programmer could incorporate symbols 
such as those used in APL or in a foreign language into communica- 
tions. 

Apple and Telidon. Apple Computer has just released its Telidon 
Graphics System for the Apple II. This is a videotex protocol, or a way to 
transmit graphics and text through the telephone. Most videotex trans- 
missions send only text that can be shown on a television or monitor. 

The Canadian Department of Communication developed the sys- 
tem and it is supported by AT & T. Norpak, Limited, of Canada de- 
veloped the interface card and software, which Apple now distributes, 
having recently received Federal Communications Commission ap- 



proval. 

The Telidon PDI protocol (short for pictures, description, instruc- 
tions) creates screens, then sends them over the telephone to any Teli- 
don-compatible system, which may range from another Apple II to a 
mainframe computer. 

Primary users at first are expected to be databases, multinational cor- 
porations, and other large organizations that need to transmit graphics 
and text. Eventually, however, this capability will reach the general 
market. 

The Telidon software has built-in page editor functions. There is, 
however, some variation in color resolution when graphics are transmit- 
ted between different makes of machines. Color graphics between Ap- 
ples have a resolution of 128 by 96 pixels; noncolor Apple graphics are 
256 by 192.

SOinORD 
Symposiam 

by Greg Hbbettsl 




It's hard to believe that we're already beginning the new year. This 
installment of the column marks one and a half years of Symposium, 
and in that time the SoftCard has grown from a relatively minor compo- 
nent of the Apple market to a substantial segment all its own. The num- 
ber of CP/M Apple users today is counted in the tens of thousands and 
is growing even larger, with users in countries all over the world. 

Apple CP/M's position would not have been possible without the 
efforts of many people, but one person in particular, Neil Konzen, had a 
direct effect on what we examine every month in Symposium. As the au- 
thor of the SoftCard software, Konzen was a prime contributor to Soft- 
Card's success. His work in establishing the dual processor BIOS is an 
accomplishment he has the right to be proud of. With that lead-in, we'll 
begin this month to examine Konzen's creation. By the time we finish, 
we should have a much better picture of the scope of that effort. 

Explaining the BIOS. The CP/M BIOS module is the catalyst for 
every successful CP/M implementation. Different computer systems re- 
quire different CP/M BIOS modules. When software designers set out to 
create such modules. Digital Research supplies them with a list of criteria 
that contains the necessary hardware functions required by BIOS in its 
operations and a sample BIOS source listing. It's then up to the indivi- 
dual software designer to produce the smallest possible CP/M BIOS 
module that meets these criteria and maximizes the special attributes of a 
particular system's hardware. 

This task is not a trivial one by any standards, even for system soft- 
ware types who are employed by the computer manufacturer and have 
access to all pertinent information on the hardware and related soft- 
ware. When it came to designing a CP/M BIOS module for the Apple, 
however, the level of difficulty was considerably higher. Even with the 
help of Apple Computer, no one was available to provide the intense fa- 
miliarity with the system that comes from having participated in its 
design. In addition, the amount and diversity of peripheral hardware 
available for the Apple, all of which had to be taken into account in the 
design of the BIOS, made the task enormously more complex. 

This is not to say that there weren't mistakes, that there weren't 
things that would be done differently if the project were being initiated 
today. But, considering that the effort b^an more than three years ago 
with the information available at that time, the job that was done was ex- 
cellent. 

In recognition of the fact that there are some areas that could be 
improved, a new version of SoftCard CP/M is currently being de- 
veloped. This development effort began in mid- 1982. As of this writing, 
the new version, called 60K CP/M, has not yet been released, although it 
has been in beta testing for some months. Radically different internally 
from the 44/56K variety, this new version provides an additional 4K of 
user TPA space and makes maximum use of the switchable 4K bank of 
the RAM boards in existence, as well as allowing an additional 12K of 
space per disk in certain cases. Although our present discussions won't 
address the new version of SoftCard, we will cover it in this column once 
it has been released. 

System Calls and BIOS Functions. As for the version of the Soft- 
Card CP/M BIOS in use today, it in many ways performs the same func- 
tions as its non-Apple counterparts do. In other ways, however, it is 
radically different. We'll explore these areas of similarity and difference 
as we discuss the BIOS. Our approach will be to cover what a stan- 



dard BIOS contains and does, then to contrast that with the SoftCard 
BIOS. 

To do that, we must look first at the Digital Research criteria for 
what is required in a working BIOS. Since the BIOS is used mainly by 
BDOS to communicate with the hardware, the primary criteria for a 
working BIOS are the functions BDOS requires in order to perform that 
communication. 

During its operation, the BDOS needs to perform a set of sixteen 
such functions. It uses these sixteen low-level functions, called primi- 
tives, individually and occasionally in combination with each other to 
perform the more than thirty-seven higher-level functions listed in your 
manual (page 3-76) as system functions or system calls. (In addition to 
functions 0 through 36 shown on that page, there are two more: func- 
tion 37, which resets a single system drive, and function 40, which, like 
function 34, performs a random disk file-write but fills the record with 
zeros before writing the data.) 

These system calls are what an operating system is really all about: 
providing a network of functions that applications and utility program- 
mers can use to build even higher-level functions into their products. For 
example, a single command in a disk utility program may make use of up 
to ten or more of the CP/M system calls during its operation. 

The same principle holds true for languages such as Basic, which are 
collections of high-level functions called commands. The commands 
dealing with I/O are usually implemented using one or more of the OS 
system calls. We can see, therefore, that, no matter how complex the 
functions required by the user, all I/O results from some combination of 
the sixteen functions required by BDOS. 

The functions BDOS requires are implemented by means of a jump 
table that's placed at the memory addresses immediately following 
BDOS. This table actually forms the beginning of BIOS and looks simi- 
lar to table 1. 

To function, the jump table must always be located immediately fol- 
lowing BDOS. This structure was established so that the requirements 
for the construction of the BIOS would be as flexible as possible. 

During design of the CP/M BIOS, the system programmer can make 
each of the sixteen routines as large or as small as necessary, locate them 
wherever seems best, and order them however he wishes. This is so be-

cause, as a result of the arrangement just mentioned, the address of the 
appropriate routine will be placed in the jump table at assembly time and 
BDOS will always know where each entry in the jump table is located. 
BDOS can then simply call the address of the appropriate entry in the 
jump table and control will be vectored to the correct input or output 
routine. A simple RET instruction at the end of the routine returns con- 
trol to BDOS for further processing. 

As shown, the sixteen routines (excluding BOOT) are broken down 
into two groups — character I/O and disk I/O. There are nine disk- 
related functions and seven character functions. Let's deal with the char- 
acter functions first. 

Character I/O. Character I/O can best be defined as everything 
that is input to or output from the microprocessor that does not interact 
with the disk. While this may seem a case of stating the obvious, it is not 
presented with the intent of being confusing. It's important to realize, 
though, that in a technical sense the term character I/O is itself confus- 
ing. For example, many instances of disk I/O involve the transfer of 
character data. Does that, then, make disk I/O character I/O? Further, 
since characters are nothing more than eight-bit values (usually with the 
high-order bit ignored or treated as an attribute indicator), then every 
possible eight-bit value can be said to represent some character. Does this 
mean, then, that any eight-bit value transmitted is character I/O? It 
would seem to be so, since many manufacturers of peripherals require 
the transmission of certain character sequences to printers and other de- 
vices for purposes of control arid not display. 

The answer, of course, is that everything is character I/O or nothing 
is character I/O, depending on your point of view. And, in fact, what we 
are transmitting is simply eight-bit values that have no significance except 
that which comes from how they are used. 

Since the real need is to distinguish between disk and nondisk I/O, 
the term character I/O has come to mean those types of data transfer 
where single-byte values, usually characters, are being manipulated, 
printed to the screen, sent to a printer, or perhaps received from the key- 
board. Therefore, as long as we don't look too closely at the word and 
simply accept it, it is very descriptive for the purposes of categorization. 
It is important to remember, though, that all nondisk I/O is labeled as 
character I/O, regardless of its purpose. With that in mind, BDOS 
requires the seven types of character I/O outlined here. 

1. Determine console status, that is, whether a character is available 
from the console device (CONST) 

2. Read a character from the console device (CONIN) 

3. Write a character to the console device (CONOUT) 

4. Write a character to the punch device (PUNCH) 

5. Read a character from the reader device (READER) 

6. Determine list status, that is, if the list device is ready to receive a 
character (LISTST) 

7. Write a character to the list device (LIST) 

Devices and Names. As you can see from the list just given, BDOS is 
aware of only four different devices — console, punch, reader, and list. 
The representation of these names in CP/M is CON:, PUN:, RDR:, and 
LST:. Of these, the only device actually used by BDOS without an 
outside request from a utility or application program is the console, 
which the BIOS needs in order to get user input from the keyboard and 
to print messages to the screen. With the exception of the console device, 
all of these devices are distinctly unidirectional; that is, they can only pass 
data in one direction. The console device is capable both of giving char- 
acters to BDOS and of accepting them for processing (reading and writ- 
ing respectively). 

In retrospect, for purposes of clarity only, it would have been much 
more universal to have had separate devices for the two types of console 
I/O (perhaps DISP and KYBD). But the reasoning behind the present 
choice is that with most of the early CP/M systems the keyboard and 
display were a single hardware interface to a single physical device, a Tele- 
type, perhaps, or in later times a video terminal. The fact that many of 
today's CP/M machines would have separate CRT and keyboard inter- 
faces was not foreseen during CP/M's design phase. But, as we will see, 
little is lost by not having these functions separated. 

This device structure is one of the traits that sets CP/M apart from 
many less flexible operating systems. Comparatively speaking, CP/M's 
structure makes it simpler to conceptualize than other operating systems. 



JANUARY 1983 



Treating everything in the system as though it is one of the four devices 
allows for a smaller and more efficient BDOS module. 

How the four devices are actually connected to the outside world has 
absolutely no effect on the operation of BDOS. So long as the seven 
functions BDOS requires are available and produce the expected 
numeric values when called, the four devices may literally be com- 
municating with any type of hardware device, or with a strictly software 
device for that matter. It is the choice of the BIOS designer. 

For the most part, of course, the functions BDOS requires are de- 
signed to be analogous to certain types of hardware; so, in fact, the 
console should be a keyboard/display device to be truly useful, but keep 
in mind that it does not have to be. 

Assuming for a moment that the four devices are connected to their 
suggested real world counterparts, having only four devices may seem 
rather limiting given the range of available peripheral hardware. This too 
was anticipated by CP/M's designers. Their response was to implement 
the concept of the lOBYTE. Given that BDOS will only talk to the four 
devices, there needed to be some method of assigning and reassigning 
these devices to additional devices in the system. 

The lOBYTE. The lOBYTE is the means of making those device 
assignments. The lOBYTE itself is not actually used by BDOS specifi- 
cally, although BDOS tolerates the presence of the lOBYTE at location 
03H and contains system calls to determine and alter the lOBYTE value 
at user-program request. Essentially, the lOBYTE is a single eight-bit 
byte, broken down into four two-bit fields, one corresponding to each of 
the four devices. Before doing its I/O function, each routine in the BIOS 
representing one of these devices examines the corresponding field of the 
lOBYTE to see where to direct or get the transmitted data. 

Since four distinct numbers can be represented in two bits, each of 
the four devices known to BDOS can assume one of four separate iden- 
tities. For purposes of distinction, the original four devices were called 
logical devices, while the devices they could potentially assume were 
called physical devices. The names logical and physical fit well, since the 
four devices known to BDOS have no real connection to the physical 
hardware and are, consequently, logical constructs (constructs of the 
mind) only. On the other hand, the physical devices that can be assigned 
to those four logical devices actually do represent the driver routines in 
the BIOS that service real physical devices. 

In theory, there could be sixteen such physical devices, four for each 
of the four logical devices. There are, however, only eleven discrete de- 
vice names. Table 2 shows the lOBYTE structure. It includes the logical 
device names, the bits comprising the two-bit field in the lOBYTE for 
each device, the four possible physical device assignments, and the values 
for the two-bit field of each device. 

Note that the lOBYTE is set up in standard form with the most sig- 
nificant bit (leftmost bit) as number 7 and the least significant bit (right- 
most bit) as number 0. 

When the lOBYTE is implemented in a particular system, the proc- 
ess goes something like this. BDOS receives, through system call num- 
ber 3, a request to get one character of input from the logical reader de- 
vice. BDOS calls the jump vector corresponding to the reader routine in 
the BIOS (JMP READER in table 1), which immediately transfers con- 
trol to the BIOS reader subroutine. This subroutine then examines the 
lOBYTE. Based on the value it finds in its assigned field (bits 2 and 3), it 
branches to one of four subroutines for handling various reader type de- 
vices. The routine branched to obtains a character of input fi-om the device 
and, via an RET instruction, returns to BDOS with the character in the 
[A] register. BDOS then passes the character and control back to the 
user program that called for the input function. 

The foregoing description assumes a fully implemented BIOS, with 
all four of the physical devices corresponding to actual hardware. TTY:, 
for example, might be the keyboard, RDR: might be a paper tape read-

er, URl: could be a card reader, and UR2: might be a cassette tape in- 
terface. Of course, for a particular system, it may be that none of this 
hardware is actually hooked up; consequently, the reader routine in the 
BIOS wouldn't contain any drivers except a vector to the keyboard de- 
vice for TTY: and a single routine to return $1A, the ASCII end-of-file 
character, for the other three devices. 

In another system, the three reader devices (excluding TTY:) may be 
a single driver routine, perhaps the cassette interface, in which case the 
lOBYTE would be examined only to determine if it indicated the TTY: 
device, and, if it did not, cassette I/O would be performed. Given that 
each system is different, few systems have identical device mapping. 

The flexibility of this overall device structure has benefits for the au- 
thor of a BIOS module. In the early days of CP/M, many people who had 
purchased it were writing their own BIOS modules for their own systems. 
The standard console and list devices were implemented during this time 
and the question of further interfacing was a relatively simple one. To 
add a new device, you wrote (or purchased) a new driver and installed it 
into the BIOS source code. The entire source was then assembled, test- 
ed, and placed on the boot tracks. 

As CP/M has become more and more a commercial product, re- 
ceived when a particular computer system is purchased, the idea of as- 
sembling one's own BIOS and then over time adding drivers and reas- 
sembling has lost popularity. As a result, the inherent flexibility of this 
system has been lost to a degree. 

Most of today's users are purchasing their computers to run applica- 
tions software, not because they want to become system programmers. 
As a consequence, most CP/Ms sold today are already implemented 
with functional BIOS modules that contain any drivers necessary to run 
the manufacturers' peripheral products (whether they are installed or 
not) at the time of purchase. Generally, such modules are only marginal- 
ly alterable through manufacturer-supplied utility programs that enable 
or disable existing driver routines. 

Another option, used mainly by peripheral manufacturers, is to re- 
quest the type of computer in use before purchase and to provide a utili- 
ty that replaces all or part of the computer manufacturer's BIOS with 
that of the peripheral manufacturer. The latter BIOS or partial BIOS is, 
of course, able to communicate with the new peripheral hardware. And, 
in some cases, even today, the BIOS source code is shipped with the 
original computer, allowing the user to alter and reassemble it at will. 

The job of the BIOS implementer, then, is to create a collection of 
driver routines for character I/O that correspond to the physical devices 
contained in this system. There can be up to eleven devices in all. Why 
only eleven, though, when there are sixteen possible lOBYTE field 
values? Well, three discrete device names are lost because, as evidenced 
by table 2, the TTY: device may be assigned to all four logical devices. 

Some question has been raised as to why anyone would want to do 
this, but suffice it to say it was a perceived need on the part of CP/M's 
designers to have the capability of one universal device assignment. 
While no specific examples are recommended by Digital Research in 
their documentation, the system is somewhat more flexible because of 
the potential to have a single physical device that any logical device can 
be assigned to, and the flexibility is realized at little cost. In fact, while it 
may appear that three potential physical devices are lost, this really 
makes little difference since the TTY: device accessed by the PUNCH 
routine need not be the same TTY: device accessed by the LIST routine 
if there is a crushing need to implement more than eleven devices. Again, 
it is up to individual BIOS designers to make use of the physical device 
names as they see fit, based on the number of actual interfaces they need 
to service with routines. From a practical standpoint, such tricks are 
seldom needed, however. It's unlikely that so many physical devices 
would need to be interfaced that the capacity for eleven would not be 
sufficient. 

Subtracting the three, though, still leaves us with thirteen possible 
devices. Where are the other two? The first is the CRT device, which is 
repeated in the CON: and LST: fields, again because of a perceived need 
to be able to assign the logical printer output to the same physical device 
as the logical console output. 

While it's easier to see here than in the case of the TTY: assignment, 
the rationale behind this is somewhat archaic. It goes back to a time 
when the console display was often a hard copy device such as a Tele- 



type. In such instances, there was little need for a system printer since the 
console display could do double duty. However, the list device was re- 
quired to be directed there separately, since its output format is con- 
siderably more flexible for purposes of printed material than the output 
format obtainable through the console device. 

The final potential device name is lost as a result of the inclusion of the 
BAT: device in the possible assignments of CON:. BAT: is not a phys- 
ical device; rather, it is a means of providing so-called batch processing 
by reassigning the console input and output functions. When STAT (or 
some other means) is used to assign CON: = BAT:, any further calls to 
the CONIN subroutine are automatically vectored to the READER 
subroutine; likewise, further calls to CONOUT are vectored to the LIST 
subroutine. It's important to realize that this is done in the BIOS in the 
CONIN and CONOUT routines themselves and that BDOS is unaware 
of the change. 

Whatever physical devices the logical RDR: and LST: are assigned to 
will be the actual physical devices providing input and output. This is so 
because the READER and LIST subroutines will not be able to detect 
that they have been called by CONIN and CONOUT, rather than by 
BDOS directly. The effect here is to cause the keyboard to go dead and 
eliminate all output to the screen in favor of getting all input from what- 
ever physical device is assigned to the RDR: and sending all output to 
whatever physical device is assigned to LST:. What this might be used for 
is up to the ingenuity of the individual user; however, if the keyboard and 
screen are physical device TTY:, then, by assigning RDR:=TTY: and 
LST: = TTY: and then assigning CON: = BAT:, the effect is one of hav- 
ing done nothing whatsoever. Well, at least no harm is done. 

SoftCard Singularities. It's time now to examine the SoftCard char- 
acter I/O to see what similarities and differences exist with regard to 
what we have just been looking at. First of all, the lOBYTE structure, 
which is an option for CP/M systems, was included in SoftCard CP/M. 
This means that the logical-to-physical device mapping we've just been 
discussing is applicable. In the case of the Apple, however, some changes 
and even some compromises were made because of the method of Apple 
interfacing. This method — using seven peripheral slots for the installa- 
tion of interface boards and memory mapping the seven slots — posed 
some difficulties for Konzen to work around. The fact that each slot 
could be just about anything when it came time for I/O made things a lit- 
tle too flexible for the system to deal with efficiently. For that reason, it 
was decided early on to make CP/M slot-dependent for certain devices. 
Slot 1 would, for example, always contain the system printer interface, 
slot 2 the reader and punch communications interface, slot 3 the alter- 
nate console device (if an eighty-column display was desired). Slots 4 
through 7 are left to be occupied by disks or user-installed peripherals. In 
this way, some of the ambiguity was removed from the device structure. 

If the BIOS had not been set up to follow this slot-dependent 
architecture, there would be no way of knowing, for example, which of 
two serial cards installed in the system was the printer interface and 
which was the reader/punch interface or even the terminal interface. The 
only solution would have been to force users to identify their systems, 
either at purchase or to some type of utility program, and then to create a 
special version of the BIOS for each user. Such a version would have to 
be re-created each time some trivial change was made in the system, The 
slot-dependent structure, on the contrary, allows the BIOS to reorganize 
the system during every cold boot by making a one-pass identification of 
slot contents and later rearranging vector addresses based on this infor- 
mation. 

Obviously, the system just described had some limitations. For one 
thing, not all of the many peripherals now available could be included. 
The reason here, of course, is that, because many of them have special 
driver subroutines and data handling protocols, it would mean separate 
routines for most of them. Including even half would mean that the 
BIOS would be huge and half unused in any given case. 

It was not possible, therefore, for the BIOS to be all things to all pe- 
ripherals. So the various eighty-column cards, the more common serial 
and parallel communications interfaces, and the common printer cards 
were included. The boot code was "educated" to recognize these com- 
mon cards and, based on the slot they were located in, to identify them as 
the TTY: device or the LPT: device and so on. Small multipurpose sub- 
routines to transmit and receive single characters from each of these de- 



JANUARY 1983 



vices were written and placed in the BIOS to be called by different device 
routines like READER and LIST, thereby avoiding duplication where 
possible. 

While this system worked well, it was inherently not very expand- 
able for the user. With that in mind, Konzen established a secondary set 
of vectors in a known place in the BIOS (the I/O configuration block) 
that users could manipulate to vector output to their own special-pur- 
pose drivers for any additional hardware they wished to add. In most 
cases, the original device routine jumps to the appropriate vector (based 
on the lOBYTE field value), which in turn jumps right back (normally to 
within a few bytes of the place it came from) to the "standard" driver for 
that type of device. 

This may not seem particularly efficient, but it does provide a very 
good way for the user to patch the various vectors to point to his own 
routines. And, since the I/O configuration block won't change size or 
location, the user's patches are unaffected by changes in the construc- 
tion of the BIOS. There are eleven of these special vectors, one for con- 
sole status (CONST) and two for each of the other five character I/O 
routines (that is, CONIN, CONOUT, READER, PUNCH, and LIST). 
The list status (LISTST) routine does not have a vector because the BIOS 
for SoftCard always returns a ready status to BDOS. 

We now have eleven physical devices and eleven vectors. Unfortu- 
nately for clarity's sake, they do not match up. Really, it was obvious they 
couldn't anyway, since console status is not a device. The map of these 
devices is shown in table 3.

From table 3, we can see that, for the purposes of the SoftCard ver- 
sion, only eight possible CP/M physical devices are covered by the ten 
vectors. In every instance in which two devices are served by the same 
vector, as is the case with the TTY: and CRT: devices, the URl: and 
UR2: devices, and the UPl: and UP2: devices, the two devices are 
thought of as only a single physical device. Changing the lOBYTE, 
therefore, from URl: to UR2: can have no effect. This is the second 
compromise made with SoftCard CP/M for the purpose of simplifying 
the I /O structure. It seems a trivial compromise, however, since a total of 
eight devices to utilize seven slots does not seem too limiting, especially 
since some of the slots will be taken up by disk controllers and the Soft- 
Card itself. 

We have covered a lot of ground in this column, and yet we still have 
not examined the character I/O routines and vectors in detail. The 
ground we have covered, however, should give you a better understand- 
ing of how these functions work in an overall sense. 

As a final recap, let's take one such system call and see what happens 
to the flow of control. (1) BDOS receives a request for a character from 
the reader device through system call number 3. (2) BDOS calls the 
READER routine via the BIOS jump table. (3) The READER routine 
examines the lOBYTE and finds the field set to the value corresponding 
to URl:. (4) The READER routine branches to READER input vec- 
tor number two. (5) This vector branches back into the BIOS several 
bytes past the READER start location to a routine called RDRINl. 
(6) RDRINl, which was created to deal with a serial card or communi- 
cations card in slot 2, loads the slot number into register [A] and jumps 
to one of several input routines, depending on whether the boot routine 
discovered a serial card, comm card, or parallel interface in slot 2 during 
boot. (7) That routine uses the slot value in [A] to get a character from 
the interface in slot 2. (8) The character gotten, the routine branches back 
to BDOS with the character now in [A]. (9) BDOS returns to the caller 
program with the character. 

Whew! Here's hoping this followed your conception of what would 
happen. With that, we'll bring this column to a close. Next time, we'll go 
into further detail on character I/O and make a start as well on the dis- 
cussion of disk lO. Until next month. ...

The fall '82 COMDEX was a resounding success. Next year's show will be even bigger. 



Computerized Center Combines 
Post Office and Indy Carriers 



The country's first private post office has 
opened computerized branches in Ventura 
and Century City, California. 

World Mail Centers, the brainchild of 
electrical engineer Scott Adler, premiered last 
year in Camarillo, California. This pilot cen- 
ter combined the full services of the United 
States Post Office with Federal Express, 
United Parcel Service, Trans-Pak, Burling- 
ton, Purolator, DHL International Overnight 
Service, and Emery. The couriers regarded the 
center as an extension of their own systems 
with no overhead cost to them and made reg- 
ular pickups. 

The Camarillo center generated a quarter 
of a million dollars in postal revenues in its 
first six months of operation, netting Adler a 
good profit on his $60,000 investment and 
paving the way for a projected three thou- 
sand franchised centers over the next five 
years. 

Software engineer Forrest Kendall, who 
has worked with Adler on missile systems, de- 
signed a computer system for the World Mail 
Center and wrote programs for accounting 
and courier rate tables. Computers made pos- 



sible the use of a debit card, replacing cash, 
idenfifying the customer, and keeping an on- 
going record of all account activity as well as 
allowing after-hours transactions. 

The center works like this; the employee, 
using a terminal at the counter, prompts the 
computer to make a generic selection based on 
where a customer wants a package to go, how 
fast, and for how much money. It then prints 
out a mailing label and a receipt, completing the 
transaction in thirty seconds or less. Profits 
are made from a 5 percent markup on stamps 
and a one dollar handling charge for transac- 
tions that require paperwork, like registered 
and certified mail. The system uses Hewlett- 
Packard's Image database for the manage- 
ment of records and reports. 

Worid Mail Centers will eventually have 
electronic mail capability, either as a tree 
structure or from the center's Century City 
mainframe. If all goes as planned, the centers 
will become a free-enterprise alternative to the 
modernization of existing postal services with 
taxpayers' money and will generate three bil- 
lion dollars in revenues for the United States 
Postal Service over the next five years. 



VEGAS HOSTS 
DEALER BASH 



COMDEX is the flea market of the mi- 
crocomputer industry, where dealer and sup- 
plier can attempt to do business face to face. 

This time around, observers found evi- 
dence for any trend they were particularly 
biased for. In a nutshell, here's what was 
there: 

• The eight-bit world may be dead, but the 
Japanese apparently haven't seen the corpus 
delicti. From Seiko to Sanyo, they displayed 
smaller, more powerful Z80-based machines. 

• Apple remains the dominant eight-bit ma- 
chine. Atari yielded the field without a fight by 
not showing up. This was not Tandy's kind of 
show, and Commodore still has fences to 
mend with dealers. Primary proof the exis- 
tence of at least four, and possibly more, Ap- 
ple emulators. 

• The number of IBM pc emulators or MS- 
DOS machines went from a trickle to a flood 
in one year. Right now IBM owns the six- 
teen-bit market just as surely as Apple owns 
the eight-bit market. 

• Jaded software users were disappointed. 
Other than TK Solver! and 1-2-3, both an- 
nounced previously, there was little true six- 
teen-bit software at the show. It's all eight-bit 
software warmed over. The Incredible Jack 
was the most revolutionary of the eight-bit 
packages. Has all the good software been writ- 
ten, or are we on the brink of a new wave of 
software innovation? 

• The unexpected source of the first break- 
through in Xerox Star user interfaces was Visi- 
Corp. They introduced Visi-On, a user inter- 
face shell for all VisiCorp products, to a suit- 
ably awed audience. Microsoft and Digital 
Research were evidently expecting a plunge up 
the middle and VisiCorp successfully pulled 
off the end run. 

• Even dealers with access to all three major 
microcomputers — IBM, Osborne, and Ap- 
ple — were looking for a quick fix to heal sag- 
ging margins. There was none to be found. 

• There were lots of new products at 
COMDEX, and the exhibitors would have 
you believe that the developments were ma- 
jor. In fact, nothing introduced at COMDEX 
this fall will ever stand next to VisiCalc or the 
Apple II as an influencer on our life and times.

look exactly like the real thing, will invariably 
have the appearance of a plastic imitation of 
the real thing. That problem has now been ef- 
fectively licked by Rob Cook of Lucasfilm's 
computer graphics laboratory in San Rafael, 
California. Speaking at the Boston Siggraph 
'82 convention. Cook revealed that the plastic 
problem is caused by an error in the calcula- 
tion of an object's reflective properties; in the 
computer graphics industry to date, "The 
model that has been used is a really good 
model for plastic and a really poor model for 
anything else." 




Making metal look like metal with the correctly computed specular component. 



Diffuse reflection — light from a specific 
source but reflected off a surface equally in all 
directions — has always been correctly com- 
puted as being the same color as the object, 
while specular reflection — the component rep- 
resenting concentrated highlights, light re- 
flected directly to the eye — has been calcu- 
lated as being the color of the light source, 
usually white. In fact. Cook found, "The spwc- 
ular component is usually the color of the ma- 
terial, not the color of the light source." 

Computing white spectral reflection for 
plastic or waxy objects is okay, since such ob- 
jects, in the real world, always have a trans- 



Computers Pursue Perfect Pasta 



Food scientists at Foremost-McKesson 
company are using a new noodle to perfect the 
old noodle at their million-dollar pasta re- 
search facility in Dublin, California. The new 
noodle is their time-sharing piece of a main- 
frame computer, taking the experimental 
drudgery out of the never-ending search for 
the perfect pasta. 

Pasta may be little more than wheat and 
water, but there are thousands of ways that 
scientists can manipulate those ingredients' 
interaction during the production process. 
They can alter proportions, for starters, and 
vary time and temperature setting for mixing, 
drying, and pressing routines. In the pasta 
past, researchers had to proceed step by la- 
borious step in their unsung quest — altering a 
single variable, recording the result, then mov- 
ing on to yet another experiment. Now they 
use a terminal's keyboard and let a General 
Electric Information Services computer back 
in Ohio do most of the work. 

The brains of the system is a sophisticated 
Basic program known as RSM, for Response 
Surface Methodology. Using sample lab test 
data for its parameters, RSM is able to shuf- 
fle one or more production-process variables 
as it runs scores of experiments in the time it 
would take Mama Celeste to say, "Abondan- 
za." A subprogram with an end-user orienta- 
tion offers a further enhancement — a model 
by which to create a people-pleasing pasta. It 



mixes variables for flavor, color, thickness, 
viscosity, and that all-important factor, 
"mouth feel." 

"These RSM studies won't give us the 
final answer," cautions Gaylord Palmer, a 
senior scientist at Foremost-McKesson and 
RSM coauthor. "When we get back into the 
production facility, we may find different 
numbers, but the direction, trends, and in- 
structions the program gives us are in the 
ballpark." 

Foremost-McKesson's investment in pas- 
ta research is predicated on two market fac- 
tors — the public's pasta preferences and an- 
ticipated industry growth. When it comes to 
pasta, says company spokesman Bruce A. 
Lewis, the public knows its own noodle. It 
covets a pasta that is firm, not mushy. It 
yearns for golden threads that cheerfully hold 
their own when convenience-minded con- 
sumers cook them to death. 

Foremost-McKesson is hoping its Dublin 
research facility will give it the competitive 
edge in a billion-dollar industry that is ex- 
pected to triple in size by 1990. Long seen as 
the principal factor in the girth of Italian 
opera singers, pasta is now promoted as a fad- 
cum-health food — no sodium, no salt, no 
sugar, practically no fat, and, yes, relatively 
few calories. 

"Noodles aren't fattening; it's what you 
put on them that is," says Lewis. 



parent or white molecular surface layer. Com- 
puting the same reflective properties for a 
computer-generated, kandy-kolored, tanger- 
ine-flaked, streamlined spaceship is, however, 
a big mistake and would result in the made- 
by-Mattel effect. 

Cook explains that, as all reflection "es- 
sentially occurs at the surface," the correct 
specular components for metals, painted sur- 
faces, and other "homogeneous" objects 
should be calculated from reference tables of 
thermophysical spectral data. 

The new technique is currently under de- 
velopment at Lucasfilm and was first em- 
ployed on a limited basis in the creation of the 
"Genesis effect" for Star Trek II.

Wall Street Adopts Computer 
Technology To Beat the Crunch 



On November 3, 1982, the Dow Jones 
soared 43.41 points, its biggest gain ever, to a 
new closing high of 1,065.49. Aside from the 
emotional boost such a rise gives to stock 
market participants, the figures are mislead- 
ing. Cold statistics show that this total would 
nearly have to triple, soaring to 3,000, to keep 
up with the cost of living over the last ten 
years. Market analysts call the recent climbs 
more psychological events than accurate re- 
flections of the market's health. 

Economically accurate or not, there has 
been plenty of action on Wall Street recently. 
And all that action requires paper, like last 
October 7 when 147 million shares were 
traded, causing proportionate accompanying 
paperwork. 

Avalanches of order tickets have been fall- 
ing from the Big Board lately in dizzying flur- 
ries. Wall Street is able to avoid a crunch of 
paperwork with the help of computers. 

According to the Wall Street Journal, 
there are three computer systems now on the 
floor of the New York Stock Exchange that 
are "crucial for managing the current volume. 
They are:

"The Designated Order Turnaround, or 
DOT, which routes small orders to the spe- 
cialist posts on the floor, eliminating the need 
for floor brokers to represent such orders in 
the trading crowd. 

"The Opening Automated Report Serv- 
ice, or OARS, which matches buy and sell 
orders before the market opens each day and 
spits out the imbalance; rather than do the 
matching themselves, specialists handle only 
the imbalance. 

"A batching system for the five hundred 
most active stocks, which lumps together 
orders in these active issues throughout the 
day, thereby cutting down on the number of 
transactions." 

When NYSE president John Phelan 
warned of coming volumes of one hundred 
million shares a day, a level most people 
thought unrealistic as recently as the late 
seventies, more and more Wall Street firms 
began investing in computer systems to han- 
dle the predicted onslaught — a wise invest- 
ment, as it turned out. The Dow Jones may 
not be as reliable as it once was, but the new 
trading levels have Wall Street firms seriously 
consuhing their local computer dealers. 

One such firm is Pershing & Company, 
who spent $25 million on a new system to 
handle order processing and clearing for the 
hundred-odd correspondent firms it serves. 
Today, its vast processing rooms are lined 
with banks of computers and terminals. 

Another firm. Prudential Bache, has im- 
proved its services with a GTE system that 
routes branch office orders to the various ex- 
changes for execution. Until a few years ago, 
these orders were relayed to New York and 
routed by clerks. ADP Brokerage Services, 
which handles accounting for about ninety se- 
curities firms, moved into larger quarters to 
make room for their new computerized ac- 
counting system. E. F. Hutton, the invest- 
ment broker, is installing a central computer 
system right now. Apparently, when com- 
puters lalk, even E. f. Hutton Hstens. 

Meanwhile, Big Board officials contem- 
plate furtfier improvements in floor opera- 
tions. Phelan is now talking volumes of 250 
million shares, and nobody is doubting him. 
The one tiny snag in all this computerization is 
the transaction tape that monitors the trading 
action on the floor. It's running as much as an 
hour behind. 

It's not a mechanical problem; it's just that 
people can't read any faster than nine hun- 
dred characters a minute. Ironically, the late- 
ness of the ticker tape may now be looked at 
as a market barometer, a good indicator of 
activity. 



Too Expensive? 

Impact of E-Beams 
On Semiconductor 
Industry Uncertain 



In the short and booming history of the 
semiconductor industry, technology has paced 
a succession of quantum leaps. Within the 
year, semiconductor manufacturers will be of- 
fered another state-of-the-art advance. 

The technology in question is the E- 
beam — a very expensive machine that uses 
beams of electrons aimed through negative- 
like masks to imprint integrated circuits on 
wafers of silicon. Heretofore unavailable on a 
wide scale commercially, these impressive ma- 
chines will enable semiconductor manufac- 
turers to pack more layers of circuitry (and 
hence more memory) onto a silicon wafer. 

The process of printing integrated circuits 
using optical techniques, the industry stan- 
dard to date, is impeded by an effect known as 
defraction, which causes microscopic lines in 
the chip's power grid to grow fuzzier the more 
tightly they're packed. E-beams, which print 
dot by dot like a television image, trace cir- 
cuits directly onto a wafer and are not as sub- 
ject to defraction. 

There are two reasons why the semicon- 
ductor industry is debating whether to em- 
brace this technological marvel — money and 
speed. The new machines will cost anywhere 
from one million to three million dollars per 
unit compared with today's equipment — op- 
tical devices known as steppers and projec- 
tion aligners that run around $500,000 and 
$25,000, respectively. In addition, E-beams 
sacrifice speed for greater precision; they're 
just plain slower than steppers and aligners. 

E-beam manufacturers believe the imme- 
diate future of their product lies in sophisti- 
cated mainframe circuitry for military and 
other high-performance systems. It's a grow- 
ing market and, according to some observers, 
E-beams could figure in half the semiconduc- 
tor industry's production by 1990. 

"The E-beam's impact on personal com- 
puters is further down the road," says Ron 
Felker, vice president of Electron Beam Cor- 
poration of San Diego, California, an affiliate 
of General Sigma Corporation. His com- 
pany, one of three manufacturers offering the 
advanced technology commercially, sold its 
first unit to the navy for a San Diego based 
computer fabrication facility late in 1982. 

"When the industry (as a whole) gets 
ready to take advantage of the new machine's 
ability to shrink circuit lines — to pack more

and more logic on a chip, more and more cells 
of memory — then our machines become eco- 
nomical, because you can no longer do it 
optically." 

Other companies banking on commercial 
acceptance of E-beam technology are GCA 
Corporation and Varian Associates, which 
plan to offer their own systems within the 
year. Their faith in the technology's prospects 
may hinge in part on the actions of three in- 
dustry pacesetters — Texas Instruments, IBM, 
and Hewlett-Packard, each of which has de- 
veloped in-house E-beam writers.

□ Take-Out Computer Boom. Cupertino 
based market research firm InfoCorp defines 
the market for "mobile" computers in a re- 
cent report and projects likely market trends 
toward the end of the decade. The three kinds 
of mobile computers are portables (Epson 
HX-20 and GRID Compass), handheld com- 
puters (HP-75C, Panasonic LINC, and Sharp 
PCI 500), and transportable computers (Os- 
borne 1). According to InfoCorp, the entire 
market will reach 5.1 milhon units in 1987 
from a projected 527,000 units in 1982. 

The fastest growing segment of the mo- 
bile computer market will be portables, which 
merge the computing power of desktop ma- 
chines with the portability of handhelds. The 
portable market is expected to reach sales of 
$2.3 billion by 1987. IBM, Apple, and a num- 
ber of Japanese suppliers are looking serious- 
ly at portables. Handheld computers will en- 
joy a fast growth period, selling 400,000 units 
in 1982 and climbing to 4.2 million in 1987. 
Transportable, suitcase-size computers will 
peak at 260,000 units in 1983 according to 
InfoCorp, dropping to 150,000 units by 1987. 

□ Decline of Business Personal Computers 
Forecasted. A new report generated by Inter- 
national Resource Development, a Connecti- 
cut-based market research company, predicts 
the virtual demise of the business personal 
computer, as we now know it, by 1992. Ac- 
cording to IRD's 163-page report, by 1987 the 
personal computer market wUl begin to be ab- 
sorbed by the multifunction workstation. In 
the coming years, office automation tools will 
converge on a common point of applications 
capabihty. For instance, today (if you're 
lucky) you can get a program that runs on a 
personal Computer that is as good as a dedi- 
cated word processor. Presumably, a multi- 
function workstation will include everything 
you need in one cost-effective package. This is 
not to say that personal computers in busi- 
ness will disappear overnight (in 1992 there 
will still be around 9.9 million installed, ac- 
cording to IRD), but the multifunction work- 



station will account for 90 percent of the new 
business in office automation equipment. 

□ Plugging in the Atlas Workstation. 

Dolch Logic Instruments has announced its 
new integrated digital workstafion, called At- 
las, that combines logic analysis, in-circuit 
emulation, word generation, and other meas- 
urement techniques in one system. Atlas inte- 
grates these various digital test methods yet 
maintains the ability to adapt to individual 
test environments through the use of plug-ins. 
Atlas (for adaptive test and logic analyzer sys- 
tem) combines a plug-in instrument front end 
with a CP/M-driven universal computer. 
Each plug-in module contains the instrument 
hardware and dedicated software required to 
perform a specific simulation or measure- 
ment task and all plug-ins use the same com- 
puter bus control. 

When a plug-in is inserted into the Atlas 
mainframe, its functional software is auto- 
matically loaded into the controller. Special 
function soft keys and flip keys are defined 
automatically to support the specified test 
function. Atlas also includes communications 
software that allows it to emulate a VT-100 
terminal on a Digital PDP-11; the computa- 
tion and memory capacity of a PDP- 1 1 can be 
integrated into an Atlas workstation, allow- 
ing software compiled on the PDP-11, for 
example, to be downloaded and debugged lo- 
cally. Atlas comes standard with two 5 '/4-inch 
disk drives used in combination with a Z80A 
cpu to support the CP/M operating system. 
The Atlas mainframe is priced around $12,000 
with plug-in modules ranging from $2,000 to 
$10,000, depending on the application. 

□ Apple-Compatible Portable. M P. Com- 
puter Services of Sunnyvale, California, has 
just released the Rover I, a standalone com- 
puter that fits into a regular size attache case. 
The portable computer features dual eight-bit 
microprocessors, 128K of RAM, a full/travel 
keyboard with ten function keys, a tape drive 
capable of storing up to 125K of data, a serial 
communications interface, parallel printer in- 
terface, and a real-Ume clock. The Rover Dis- 
play Unit provides high-resolution graphics 
on a 5 '/2 -inch diagonal screen. Multifunction 
expansion units allow the use of a modem, 
two disk drives, or a five megabyte Win- 
chester hard disk. Software supplied with the 
Rover I includes word processing {Rextex), 
spreadsheet forecasting (AbaCalc), and an ad- 
vanced calculator (Abacus). With a disk drive 
and the Rover Operating System (Rosy), the 
Rover is Apple software compatible, accord- 
ing to M.P. Computer Systems.

JANUARY 1983 




Less than ten years ago, the most common device for interactive 
communication with a computer was a printing terminal (such as the 
Teletype Model ASR-33 or one of the Selectric terminals) rather than the 
now ubiquitous CRT. At first glance, one of these machines typing along 
at ten to fifteen characters per second (cps) was a rather impressive sight. 
Waiting several seconds for a simple response or minutes for a small pro- 
gram listing, however, left much to be desired. At the time, a CRT or 
video terminal was considered a luxury; its writing speed of a thousand 
or more characters per second made it an excellent means of communi- 
cation. But once you'd finished working with the computer you had no 
written record of what had transpired. 

Today the situation is totally reversed. Advances in microelectronics 
have made video display much more economical, and ahnost all per- 
sonal computers use a video terminal as the primary output device. This 
leaves many computerists without any means of generating hard copy. 
For a while, in fact, many people considered a printer a luxury item. But 
in the last two years we've seen a number of well-built, low-cost printers 
arrive, mostly from Japan. These printers have enjoyed great popularity. 

While some printers cost less than a disk drive, a good letter-quality 
printer can still set you back as much as or more than the computer it- 
self Therefore, it's important to know the pros and cons of the different 
kinds of printers. Then you can choose a machine that meets your needs. 

Printer Basics. All printers can be classified as impact or nonimpact, 
with either fully formed characters or matrix character formation. 
Impact printers operate much the way an ordinary typewriter does; that 
is, they rely upon a hard object striking against a ribbon and thereby 
transferring ink to paper. Nonimpact printers use various other technol- 
ogies to create readable copy. 

You will also have to choose between fully formed and dot-matrix 
characters. Fully formed characters are printed by means of a single 
stroke of an appropriately shaped die. Matrix printing, on the other hand, 
divides each character field into a finite number of points (dots) in the 
same manner as most CRT video displays do. 

The tradeoffs involved in choosing impact or nonimpact printing and 
fully formed or dot-matrix characters can help you narrow down your 
selection of printers quite rapidly. For example, nonimpact printers offer 
quiet operation, good printing speed, and low cost. However, they 
usually require special paper and can't print on multiple-copy forms or 
make carbon copies. Thus, if you have mailing labels or special forms to 
print, you need an impact printer. 

For the highest quality printing, fully formed characters are desir- 
able; but a matrix printer offers higher speed and lower cost as well as 
allowing for special characters and graphics to be printed along with 
ordinary text. Categorizing printers by whether they are impact or non- 
impact and by their character formation method gives us four basic 
printer types. We'll discuss each of them in turn. 
Type I: Fully Formed Impact 

Printers in this category range from modified typewriters to high- 
speed drum and band printers. If the printer offers alternate typefaces, 
the font is changed by replacing the print element (often a wheel or 
sphere). Paper motion can be either tractor feed or friction feed. Some of 
the very slowest and very fastest printers fall into this group. 

Magic Fingers. One of the least expensive approaches to making a

printer is to add a bank of solenoids to an ordinary, preferably electric, 
typewriter. The solenoids are positioned over each key and connected to 
the computer via some interface. Thus the computer can activate these 
electric "fingers" in a manner similar to the way someone types at the 
keyboard. Because of mechanical limitations, printing is very slow (less 
than ten characters per second) and, of course, fairly noisy. Print quality 
can be very good, and the ability to use almost any type of paper is a real 
plus. If your primary need is to be able to print letters on your own sta- 
tionery, then a printer of this sort might be an economical solution 
(assuming you already own a typewriter). One word of caution, how- 
ever — most typewriters aren't designed to withstand heavy use as a 
printer, so take it easy! 

Selectric-Based Printers. Probably the highest print quality can be 
obtained using printers that are built around the IBM Selectric mecha- 
nism. With their familiar "golf ball" shaped elements, these ma- 
chines can reach a top speed of about fifteen characters per second. 
Many different fonts are available, and changing elements takes only a 
few seconds. 

There are basically two kinds of Selectric printers— those that are 
converted typewriters and those that were originally designed for use as 
terminals. The latter usually have a heavy-duty mechanism that's more 
suitable for use as a printer. Some of the older terminals require a differ- 
ent electrical code than microcomputers use. Thus making them work 
with the standard ASCII code may call for additional circuitry. Because of 
this, most Selectrics can be used for printing only (that is, the keyboard can- 
not be used for input into the Apple). Many suppliws sell used or refurbished 
units at a reasonable price; some of these units, but not all, indude the ASCII 
conversion. Aside from making letter-quality printouts, such a unit will 
double as an excellait typewriter. 

Electronic Typewriters. Along these same lines, several electronic 
daisy wheel typewriter/printer combinations have recently become avail- 
able. Although slightly inferior to a Selectric in terms of print quality, the 
new electronic typewriters do offer many additional features that you 
might find useful. Among these are multiple pitch (including propor- 
tional spacing), automatic underlining, centering, justification, and re- 
verse print. These features also work when the unit is used as a manual 
typewriter. Speeds of up to thirty characters per second are typical. 

Cylinder/Drum Printers. The heart of these printers is a character- 
studded, rotating cylinder or drum (see figure 1). A series of hammers 
strikes the paper against an inked ribbon and the drum, thereby trans- 




There are ihree characler sets on the chafacter wheel. In 
each character set ihere are six segments conlaining thirty- 
two characters each There are six hammers, one for each 
characler set.

The perimeter of the drum is surrounded by the complete repertoire of 

characters. Across the length of the drum, the characters are repeated.

ferring an image of the character onto the paper. Each hammer is fired 
under electromechanical control such that it strikes the paper at the pre- 
cise time when the desired character on the drum is opposite the 
hammer. 

Drum printers have a complete character set for each column to be 
printed. Thus an entire line is printed at once without any horizontal car- 
riage movement (see figure 2). This category includes a wide variety of 
printers. The price can range from less than $100 to more than $10,000. 
Some print at ten characters per second, others are as fast as two thou-

to control the printwheel and the print hammer's impact force. 



sand lines a minute. Most of the "standard paper" (that is, nonthermal) 
printing calculators use this type of mechanism. 

Daisy Wheel Printers. Probably the most popular type of printer in 
the fully formed impact category, the daisy wheel printer (see figure 3) 
gets its name from the petal-like construction of its printhead. Imagine 
taking all of the keys from a standard typewriter and forming them into a 
circle similar to the arrangement of the spokes on a wheel. An electronic 
servomechanism controls the position of the character wheel to bring the 
desired characters into place. When the correct "petal" has been spun in- 
to position, a hammer forces the petal into contact with the ribbon and 
paper. 

Their relatively low cost (less than $800 dollars now), moderately 
high speed (thirty-five to fifty-five cps), and interchangeable fonts have 
made daisy wheel printers very popular. There's quite a lot of competi- 
tion among manufacturers who create this type of printer. Each newer

activates solenoids that cause the print wires to impact printer and paper. 



model represents someone's "effort to offer increased features, reduced 
noise, and/or lower price. 

Band Printers. At the high end of the impact printer category are the 
band printers (see figure 4). Used with many mainframe computer sys- 
tems, they offer extremely high throughput. In this type of printer, the 
character elements are mounted on a continuous band or chain. The 
band constantly rotates in front of a bank of hammers, one hammer for 
each column. Again, precise timing is incorporated so that each hammer 
strikes when the appropriate character is in place. Because of the care- 
fully designed sequence of characters along the chain, several hammers 
often fire simultaneously. 
Type II: Matrix Impact 

This is by far the fastest growing sector of the printer market. All the 
printers in this category use a technique similar to that shown in figure 5. 
Because each character is formed by several strokes, more sophisticated 
electronics is needed to control the printhead. The head itself consists of 
several tiny hammers or "wires," each of which is activated separately to 
print a small dot on the paper. Customarily, seven to nine wires are 
mounted vertically on the head, which moves horizontally across the 
page. As the head steps from left to right, the electronics determines 
which wires to "fire." After several such steps, a complete character has 
been printed. 

How many print wires and horizontal steps per character there are 
determines the size of the dot matrix used (it's typically seven by nine). 
Some printers allow multiple strikes or multiple passes of each character 
as a means of producing bold, enhanced, or very high-resolution charac- 
ters. An advantage of this approach is that the same printer can be used 
for high-speed draft-quality printing as well as for lower-speed near let- 
ter-quality output. 

Character fonts are software-controlled and are usually stored in 
ROM. Some dot-matrix printers don't have enough print wires to 
include descenders on the lower-case characters. Instead, they push the 
character up onto the baseline, making text a little harder to read. Most 
newer machines have at least one or two dot descenders. Because the 
Apple's hi-res screens are already in dot-matrix form, graphics are easily 
printed. Friction and tractor feed are available, with many printers 
offering both as standard features. 

Dot-matrix printers are known for their relatively high speed (80 to 
350 cps) and low cost ($300 to $2,000). Compared to most other impact 
printers, matrix types usually operate more quietly. Most of the popular 
printers likely to be found as part of an Apple system fall into this cate- 
gory, including those from Epson, Okidata, NEC, C. Itoh, and Cen- 
tronics. 

Type III: Matrix Nonimpact 

The increased need for low cost, quiet, and fast printers has spawned 
the growth of several new printer technologies. Fundamentally, these 
nonimpact techniques prohibit multiple copying and may require spe- 
cial paper. Because of this, friction feed is almost always used and the 
lack of fan-fold paper makes long printouts difficult to handle. Ink-jet 
printers can use tractor feed and normal paper but still can't make mul- 
tiple copies. 

Thermal Printers. Thermal printing requires the use of a specially 
treated paper. This paper is heat sensitive; it will change color when 



206 




heated to a temperature of about 200 degrees. 

A thermal printhead is made up of tiny heating elements arranged in 
a dot-matrix pattern (see figure 6). Speed limitations are imposed by the 
fact that the elements must cool down sufficiently before the printhead 
can move on to the next position. Some of the lower-cost thermal 
printers print "on the fly," that is, while the head moves at a constant 
horizontal rate. Although this causes the dots to smear a little, it can 
actually improve the print quality. 

Thermal printers boast high reliability, low cost, and almost silent 
operation. Because of paper restrictions, the maximum width for these 
printers is usually eighty columns. Another problem with thermal paper 
is that the printouts can fade with age. Worse yet, if left in a hot car or 
placed near any hot object, the paper can turn completely dark. A good 
example of a compact thermal printer for the Apple is the Silentype 
printer. 

Electrosensitive Printers. Like thermal printers, electrosensitive 
printers require special paper and create characters via a dot matrix. In 
this case, a dark paper is coated with a thin conductive layer, giving it a 
shiny, metallic appearance. This paper is passed in front of the print- 
head, which consists of several small electrodes that glide along the sur- 
face (see figure 7). These electrodes are connected to a voltage source 
(about fifty volts) through electronic switches. A pressure roller contacts 
the entire width of the paper below the printhead to complete the circuit. 
When an electrode is switched on, a small spark jumps between the elec-

trode and the paper. This spark burns away the metalized coating at that 
point, leaving the dark paper showing through. 

The main advantage that electrosensitive printers offer is their speed; 
their biggest disadvantage is the silver paper. Words printed on this kind 
of paper can be difficult to read and the paper is sometimes hard to get. 
Fortunately, excellent photocopies can be made from this paper, so 
that's one way to improve the final printed result. 
Type IV: Nonimpact Fully Formed 

Ink-Jet Printers. The latest advances in nonimpact printing have 
been the ink-jet type devices (see figure 8). Several different schemes, 
which operate something like the one shown in figure 8, have been de- 
veloped. Basically, ink-jet printers try to imitate the operation of a CRT 
screen. A stream of ink is broken up into many tiny droplets, and the 
droplets are given an electrical charge. These drops are then deflected 
electrostatically so that they land on the paper in the shapes of the de- 
sired characters. 

Ink-jet printing offers many advantages, including very high speed, 
excellent print quality, and silent operation (except for the sound caused 
by the mofion of the paper). Although they're still relatively expensive, 
ink-jet printers could begin to dominate the market in the near future. 

Xerographic Printers. While not exactly a personal computer item, 
xerographic printers (costing from $20,000 to $200,000) represent the top 



C L O S S A M 

Baud rate — The speed of serial data transmission in bits per second. 
The most common format uses eight data bits plus one start and one 
stop bit, for a total of ten bits per character. Thus, dividing the baud rate 
by ten usually yields the transfer rate in characters per second. 

Bidirectional — The capability to print characters from right to left as 
well as vice versa. This increases a printer's throughput. 

Buffer — The capability to store incoming characters so that, to a 
limited extent, the printer can accept data faster than it prints it. 

Carriage return — The act of returning the printhead or printwheel to 
the starting position for the next line. 

Centronics interface — See parallel interface. 

Continuous feed — See fan fold, 

CPI — Characters per inch. This will determine the maximum num- 
ber of characters across each line on the page. The standard pica font 
(similar to that found on most typewriters) allows ten cpi. 

CPS — Characters per second. This specifies the maximum speed 
(usually under ideal conditions) at which characters can be printed. See 
throughput. 

Current loop — An old-fashioned standard for serial communication 
between peripherals. 

Descenders — The small "tails" of certain lower-case letters (j, p, q) 
that extend below the baseline. 

Dot-matrix — A type of printing in which characters are formed by 
using a number of strategically placed dots. 

Fan fold — A type of paper or multipart form that can continuously 
feed into the printer (usually via tractor feed). The name comes from the 
fanlike appearance of the paper when it is folded along its perforations. 

Font — A particular style of prinfing defining the size and shape of 



each character. For example, pica, gothic, script, and so on. 

Friction feed — A simple mechanism for moving paper through the 
printer by pressing it between two rotatable rubber rollers. Similar to the 
mechanism used by most typewriters, this arrangement is required when 
using paper or forms without tractor holes. 

Fully formed characters — Characters that are printed all at once 
with complete, unbroken lines. 

Handshaking — Signals used to coordinate the transfer of data from 
one device to another. 

Hard copy — Computerese for any form of printed output. 

Instantaneous print speed — The maximum rate at which the print- 
head can actually print characters. This does not include the time needed 
to perform carriage returns, line feeds, and so forth. See throughput. 

Justification — Alignment of text along the left and/or right edge so 
that each line begins (or ends) in the same column. 

Letter-quality — See fidly formed characters. 

Line feed — The action of moving the paper to the next line. 

Logic seeking — The ability of bidirectional printers to determine the 
fastest way to print the next line. 

LPI — Lines per inch. The vertical spacing of printed lines on a page. 

LPM — Lines per minute. This is another speed rating used mainly to 
quantify line printers. 

MTBF — Mean time between failures. A good indication of how well 
a machine is built. 

MTTR — Mean time to repair. An indication of how easily a ma- 
chine can be fixed (not too important to the average consumer). 

NLQ — Near letter quality. A dense printing using multiple passes 
with a dot-matrix head. Can approach the quality of fully formed 
characters. 

Parallel interface — A connection to the computer whereby charac- 
ter information is transferred along seven or eight data lines. The most 
common standard for this type of connection has been set forth by the 
Centronics company and bears its name.

of the line. These machines usually print an entire page at one time; 
many types can print as fast as two pages per second! As you might 
guess, these devices use an electrostatic/toner process similar to that used 
in ordinary photocopy machines. Other designs even incorporate lasers 
to achieve even finer print quality. 

Conclusion. Paper feed mechanisms, carriage size, and special func- 
tions are some other aspects worth looking at when you're choosing a 
printer. For many applications, friction feed is sufficient (you can use 
continuous feed paper in a friction feed printer). Of course, pin feed is 
nice for helping to keep the paper straight. Full tractors are needed only 
when precise alignment of the paper is required or special forms are used. 
Above all, it's important to make sure that the printer will handle the 
maximum size of paper that you wish to use. 

If your work requires precise horizontal or vertical tabbing, check 
out each printer's capabilities in this area. Other features — such as mul- 
tiple fonts, underlining, variable line pitch, and graphics — may or may 
not be important to you. 

Be careful when comparing overall printer speeds. Don't confuse a 
printer's maximum or instantaneous printing speed with its sustained 

Pin feed— A simpler form of tractor feed. Instead of full tractors, 
onFy one pin wheel is used on each side. Sometimes- the pin wheels are 
mounted at the ends of the platen, giving them a fixed spacing. 

Pitch — ^The character spacing in characters per inch. 

Platen— The rubber drum behind the paper. Usually acts as a cush- 
ion for the striking elements of an impact printer. 

Proportional spacing — A font that assigns variable width, or pitch, 
to each character according to its actual size. 

Ready/busy — A hardware handshaking signal used for serial data 
communication. Data flow is controlled by the use of a dedicated wire to 
carry the control signal. 

RS-232 — A standard for serial data communication specifying signal 
voltages and connector pin assignments. 

Serial interface — A connection between two devices where data 
flows over a single pair of wires, one bit at a time. See RS-232 and current 
loop. 

Slew rate — The maximum speed at which the printhead can be 
moved (horizontal) or the paper can be advanced (vertical). This figure 
determines the time it takes a printer to perform a carriage retxirn and is 
also important when using horizontal and/ or vertical tabs. 

Tab — The act of rapidly moving the printhead to a specific position. 
Vertical tabbing involves moving the paper to a desired vertical position. 

Throughput — A more accurate measure of a printer's overall speed. 
By printing actual text and taking into account carriage returns, line 
feeds, and so on, this figure gives a more accurate representation of a 
printer's performance than instantaneous speed. 

Tractor feed — A mechanism for moving paper through the printer in 
a very precise manner without slippage. This is especially desirable when 
using preprinted forms where the printer's output must be aligned with 
the paper. Requires special paper or forms with guide holes on each side. 

X-on/X-off— One type of handshaking used for serial communica- 
tion. This system uses bidirectional communication to control the flow 
of data. 31 



throughput capabilities. Unfortunately there's no standard definition for 
determining throughput, so you must interpret the manufacturer's spec- 
ifications carefully. 

Furthermore, serial printers may communicate at a baud rate that is 
much higher than the speed at which they can print. If there's any type of 
input buffer, then the printer can accept data in a rapid burst and then 
print it out at its own pace. Depending on the size of this buffer and the 
speed at which data is being sent, this can sometimes reduce the overall 
time needed to perform a given task. With long, continuous printouts, 
however, the buffer may reach its full capacity and no longer offer any 
speed improvement. 

Bidirectional printing is another proven technique for increasing 
throughput; with logic seeking, bidirectional printing can make even 
more of a difference. 

Logic seeking allows the printer to compare the printhead position at 
the end of each line with the length of the following line. When the lines 
being printed are of equal length, the printhead should alternate printing 
directions. However, when one line is substantially longer than the pre- 
vious one, it may be quicker if the printer returns the carriage and prints 
the second line in the same direction. This decision can be made elec- 
tronically by the logic-seeking circuitry. 

Once you've narrowed the choice down to a few printers, it's time to 
visit your local computer store for a firsthand look. Examine sample 
printouts to compare print quality. It's also important to take mechani- 
cal construction into consideration, especially if the printer will see 
heavy use. The specified mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean 
time to repair (MTTR) figures for some printers are only estimates. 
When you're considering a printer, don't be afraid to remove the cover 
and look inside. You can usually tell where short cuts have been taken to 
reduce a printer's price. 

Finally, it's imperative that you have the proper interface between 
your computer and your printer. This will be either a serial (RS-232) or a 
parallel (Centronics) interface with proper handshaking. See the March 
1982 and November 1982 installments of this column for information on 
these interface boards.

Word Processing: 




Tlie Power of 
Consultation 

VI lOtlATUAH niLLER 



Alan Tompkins had been thinking the un- 
thinkable for a number of years, imagining a 
scene as if it were in a movie. He'd stride pur- 
posefully into the boss's office, smile good- 
naturedly, then drop his verbal bomb: I'm leav- 
ing IBM. The imaginary camera would pan to 
show the boss wearing a stunned expression and 
making strange wordless noises. Then a reac- 
tion shot. Tompkins basking in the exhilara- 
tion of his bold decision, yet wondering, even at 
the eleventh hour, if maybe he hadn't dived off 
the shallow end of the pool. 

"The notion of leaving IBM," he says, "was 
a very scary one." 

Thinking the Unthinkable. There were the 
kids, of course. His three oldest would soon be 
entering college and the bill, joke as Tompkins 
might, loomed as large as the defense budget. 
Gone would be the regular paychecks, the 
security blanket of fringes, not to mention an 
eleven-year association with a great organiza- 
tion that had always done well by him. 

He wouldn't be quitting just a job, he'd be 
leaving home and mother church. This hardly 
sounded like the considered decision of an IBM 
systems engineer, yet here he was, at age forty- 
two, deciding to do just that. Risking every- 
thing, or so it seemed, in order to strike out as 
an independent computer consultant in, of all 



places, rural Waitsfield (population 2,000), 
Vermont. 

It was a scary proposition, all right, but that 
was the point. Alan Tompkins was loving ev- 
ery born-again minute of it. 

"The certain knowledge that you're to hang 
the day after tomorrow brings a marvelous 
clarity to the mind," jokes Tompkins, para- 
phrasing Samuel Johnson. "I find that for me at 
least that's very true. If I wake up on a Tues- 
day morning and I know that at the end of this 
week there are some bills I have to pay and I 
don't have all the money in hand, it really fo- 
cuses my attention." 

Tompkins is sounding very focused this 
Tuesday morning. Snug in his study on a cool 
autumn day, he reflects on the bold step he took 
only two years ago. He's sitting in an old col- 
lege chair under the beneficent gaze of a geo- 
desic dome made from wooden dowels. 

"To keep in touch with Bucky Fuller," 
Tompkins explains. The sculpture is gendy turn- 
ing in the updraft from an oil and wood burn- 
ing Danish furnace that's been left half-enclosed 
so its cheery orange paint can brighten the large 
room. 

It's a rough cut office, a mix of sheet rock 
and bare plywood walls and filled with the 
eclectic tools of a computer squire. An Apple II 



Plus (he was attracted by its open system and a 
cornucopia of hardware and software), two disk 
drives, and NEC Spinwriter printer wait obedi- 
ently on an oversized, makeshift desk. A li- 
brary, primarily of computer literature, lines an 
entire wall. 

And scattered about, in various crannies, 
are reminders of rural Vermont — a battery 
charger, a five-gallon can of weed killer, sacks 
of rye and corn seed, and a spooky door that 
blows open at the whim of the wind. 

Tompkins has been spending an interesting 
day, dividing his time between his organic en- 
thusiasms, which he loosely refers to as subsis- 
tence farming and data processing. Farming can 
mean a little gardening in the meadow, but this 
morning it embraced a little recreational wood 
cutting. Where others play tennis or go sailing 
on nearby Lake Champlain, Alan Tompkins 
chops, stacks, and delivers cords of wood. Not 
for the money, but for the focus of strenuous ex- 
ercise. 

Call of the Wood. As with programming, 
what fascinates is the process and its human di- 
mensions. There's the multifaceted business of 
managing a forest resource in a state where 90 
percent of the homes rely in part on wood for 
heating, and there's his boundless admiration 
for those hardy souls who earn a living at the 
risky maneuver of felling mighty trees. A hun- 
dred years ago when Vermont was farm coun- 
try, 75 percent of the land was cleared and only 
25 percent forested. Today, those percentages 
are reversed, a neat reconfiguration of the sys- 
tem engineered by economics and the state's 
commitment to conservation. 

"And the esthetics of a pile of wood stacked 
up are quite pleasing," he adds, "if you're 
into it." 

At the moment, Tompkins is intrigued by 
another esthetic. He's at his Apple using Logo 
graphics to draw pictures of gravestone monu- 
ments for a local granite company, one of a di- 
verse collection of several clients. What he's try- 
ing to do, he explains, is write procedures for an 
IBM minicomputer to ensure that order forms 
sent to the cutting shop bear a dot-matrix rep- 
resentation of the gravestone design ordered by 
a customer. The first step in the implementa- 
tion came last year when he and another pro- 
grammer defined the turtle graphics primitive. 

"So now," he enthuses, "I'm sitting here 
with Logo, saying, 'What do I have to say in 
turtle graphics to draw a gravestone with a nice 
curvy top?' " 

If Tompkins sounds delighted, it's because 
he's gained greater control over his life and his 
livelihood. He could have plodded on at Big 
Blue in his ten-pound wing tips, but he finally 
realized the shoes didn't fit. 

"I found the things I was interested in — mi- 
crocomputers — were something I got no chance 
to work on at IBM," he explains. "What IBM 
really needed were people willing to understand 
the guts of a very few packages expertly. I found 
that emotionally I was a lot happier if I was able 
to amass new materials, sometimes under pres- 
sure. I find a lot more satisfaction in doing the 
whole job for someone. When it's done, I can

look them in the eye and say, 'That was really a 
good thing we did. It really helped your busi- 
ness.' " 

Power to the Text! His own business is 
ideas, as he says — programs, system manage- 
ment advice, and in-service computer training 
for local schoolteachers. These ideas usually 
take written form, and written form (corre- 
spondence, reports, class notes, program docu- 
mentation, and proposals) means word proc- 
essing in the age of the moving cursor. For 
Tompkins it has also meant PowerText, the 
word processing system from Beaman Porter 
that is form-oriented and Pascal-based. To hear 
Tompkins tell it, PowerText is the independent 
businessman's supersecretary — it not only takes 
dictation, it's smart enough to get all the for- 
mats straight. 

Like many word processing pilgrims, 
Tompkins arrived at his ultimate choice by ac- 
cident. He can still recall the misadventure, the 
day the magic deserted his first word processor. 
Magic Wand. 

"The crisis point came when I was format- 
ting a twenty-five page report for a client and 
suddenly the system locked up and the report 
wasn't there anymore — either in memory or on 
disk. I remember walking around and around 
this office making funny noises." 

It wasn't the first time Tompkins had power 
problems, just the last. Quickly recalling an ad 
he'd seen for PowerText, Tompkins got on the 
phone to Beaman Porter's David Guest and 
within two days was back processing the King's 
English. 

The superb support made a distinct 
impression, but it was the system itself that 
sealed the sale. PowerText wasn't perfect, mind 
you, just what the customer ordered. 

"You can find things PowerText doesn't 
have," Tompkins allows. "It doesn't have foot- 
notes at the bottom of the page. It doesn't do 
sorted indices. But, because all the format in- 
formation is stored on a format file, I find I can 
crank out the several kinds of documents I do at 
a tremendous speed." 

Banks and Bibliographies. Tompkins is 
able to do that because of PowerText's format- 
oriented approach to word processing. Since it's 
the contents of letters that change, not their ba- 
sic formats, why not spare users the trouble of 
having to style every letter individually. Why 
not create a bank of commonly used forms so 
they can concentrate on the business at hand — 
what is being said rather than how it's going to 
look on the page. Leave that thankless chore to 
a very efficient word processing secretary that 
takes dictation, automatically eliminates awk- 
ward page breaks and widows, tracks footnote 
or bibliography numbers, and knows exactly 
how to generate a polished piece of correspon- 
dence, because the form has been defined by 
the user. 

PowerText comes with five standard for- 
mat styles — business letter, personal letter, 
memo, document, and a landscape file (allow- 
ing the creation of up to twelve printed col- 
umns on a paper when turned on its long axis). 
It also includes a PowerStyle file generator that 



enables users to design their own formats. 

What is striking about the program is its 
kinship with dictation, a feature designed to 
make it particularly attractive to businesspeo- 
ple who are accustomed to dictating letters or 
who write as they speak. Text appearing on the 
CRT resembles shorthand; it's usually entered 
as a full screen of unindented copy consisting of 
the actual letter content run together with em- 
bedded keystroke commands (like "/PAR" for 
paragraph) — again, as if someone were dictat- 
ing a letter. What you see on the screen, there- 
fore, is not what you get. What you get is pro- 
fessional-looking correspondence, an impres- 
sion that is furthered by the thoughtful inclu- 
sion of the "typist's" initials at the bottom of 
your printed page. 

The program gives users control over a 
range of secretarial functions, such as underiin- 
ing, justification (right and left), subscripting 
and superscripting, space blocks for illustra- 
tions, and pitch modification. In addition, it 
supports two unusual features — table of con- 
tents generation (from headings and subheads 
in the document format) and variable column 
creation. The latter funcUon is a major time- 
saver, according to Tompkins. "Often in a let- 
ter or document, I'll have to insert something 
like 'Here's the equipment you ought to ac- 
quire,' say, and I don't have to count spaces. 
Just use the column command and it all hap- 
pens." 

PowerText's principal plus in Tompkins's 
view is what might be termed a well-inten- 
tioned accident of birth — its language, Pascal. 
Pascal is portable, says Tompkins, which is why 



he promotes it among his clients. If they elect to 
get a new generation of micro two years hence, 
their Pascal-based packages stand a better 
chance of interfacing with what's around then. 
But it's marvelously compatible even now, he 
adds. 

"The fact that PowerText is in Pascal al- 
lows me to take output from a simple database 
like VersaForm, which I like very much, and 
feed it directly into PowerText.'" 

Tompkins does have a few reservations 
about the program, but they range from the 
piddhng to the middling to more elusive ques- 
tions of style. Of the trifling order, we have his 
original program that arrived with a binder too 
small for its documentation. Then there's the 
actual manual, a more serious shortfall. It reads 
all right, Tompkins concedes, but it seems to 
lack organization, the deft hand of a profes- 
sional manual writer. And, last, there's its 
image — if you like, its commercial sex appeal. 

"I think a difficulty that PowerText has is 
that the documentation and packaging isn't 
slick enough for today's microcomputer mar- 
ket," Tompkins says. But that, he allows, is 
more a matter of long-term market positioning 
than it is of program performance. 

"While I recognize that there are slicker, 
more widely used packages like WordStar that 
run in the CP/M environment," he adds, 
"PowerText seems to me to meet the needs for 
the large bulk of office typing that people do." 

Two Roads Diverged. Meeting people's 
needs, of course, is the bottom line in program- 
ming, but it's going to take more than slick 
packaging to go on fulfilling them, says Tomp-

kins. The computer industry is at a critical junc- 
ture, he argues. It's in a classic economic bind. 
It has to keep profits up at a time when unit 
costs are coming down, and the only way to do 
that is by building an appliance that's as simple 
to operate as a toaster. 

"Unless that problem's solved, the market 
will dry up," he says. "There are only so many 
people who are fascinated by computers, use 
them professionally, or are wealthy enough to 
buy them as status symbols. These groups don't 
constitute a mass market. Computers have to be 
simpler — simpler and more reliable." 

This challenge to the industry, he says, is re- 
flected in the formidable transformation of 
IBM. It's going from being a corporation that 
sold a relatively small quantity of very expen- 
sive items to one that will sell huge quantities of 
very cheap items. 

"I think what's going to happen is what 
happened with the automobile and telephone. 
It'd be interesting to do research to see wheth- 
er, when the automobile first came out, there 
was any push for people to become internal- 
combustion-engine-literate so they could drive 
cars and whether there were any predictions 
that said sales of automobiles were going to be 
limited by the availability of chauffeurs." 

The auto industry solved that problem by 
building cars any klutz could drive, and the 
computer industry must follow suit, according 
to Tompkins, by building smarter machines 
programmable in everyday language. 




"That's why there's so much excitement 
about artificial intelligence," he notes. "It may 
be overrated, but these guys may come up with 
the answers." The major problem is less techni- 
cal than hominoid. What electrical engineers 
can't do today, Tompkins says admiringly, 
they'll do tomorrow at half the price. 

"The real challenge is in the human 
interface." 

That's also Tompkins's specialty — writing 
custom programs with a personal touch. 

"When I look at what I offer in the market- 
place, some of it's programming ability, but 
more of it is just being able to listen," he ob- 
serves. "You listen to the client describe what he 
perceives as a problem in his business and then 
you help him clarify it." 

Tompkins tries to determine if the business- 
person's problems can be solved with informa- 
tion and, if they can, whether he can do that 
mechanically by exploiting existing resources or 
by recommending a new system. Finding the 
right answers pays the bills and fills a need, but 
the intellectual payoff for Tompkins is the joy of 
the search. 

"I seem to be happiest when I'm doing 
something that I don't quite understand how 
to do." 

Taking on challenges appeals to Tomp- 
kins's pioneering nature. When he was an un- 
dergraduate at Yale, he was moving right along 
to a degree in Russian studies when he caught a 
glimpse of his future in some diplomatic out- 



JANUARY 1983 



back. "I have all my eggs in one basket," he re- 
members thinking, and the next thing he knew 
he was beating a path to the placement office at 
Yale for an interview with a local IBM recruiter. 

"The guy from IBM looked at my resume 
and said, 'Why are you here?' because there was 
nothing about computers or math on it. 'I think 
computers are here to stay, although I've never 
seen one,' I said, and then I told him that I 
heard IBM was a good company." 

Big, Blue, and Shrewd. Something tells you 
a vital piece of dialogue is missing from this his- 
torical narrative, but IBM liked what it saw and 
so did Tompkins — for a while anyway. He dis- 
covered he was working for a good company, 
one that was genuinely committed to the credo 
that to elicit and maintain the best efforts of 
people you have to treat them with respect and 
concern. Moreover, he was being introduced to 
what he terms IBM's crisp, egoless approach to 
problem solving. 

"If you were in a meeting and some guy 
came up with a doubtful proposal, you didn't 
have to spend twenty minutes telling him he's a 
wonderful person before saying his idea was no 
good." 

In the process, of course, he learned the 
business, picking up the master's degree in com- 
puter science from Rensselaer Polytechnic In- 
stitute along the way. 

To outward appearances he had it made, 
but by February of 1971, after six years (in har- 
ness) at IBM facilities in Connecticut, Tomp- 
kins was eager for greater challenge. When his 
boss could offer nothing better in that depart- 
ment, Tompkins went elsewhere, working three 
years as director of information services for a 
fledgling health maintenance organization. He 
designed its records system, managed comput- 
er personnel, and generally administered the 
place, but after three years he wanted to go back 
to IBM. The fun was in putting a system to- 
gether, not in administering it. It was time to re- 
turn to his main business — computers. 

His return, as it happened, coincided with a 
nearly forgotten skirmish in the early years of 
the computer age — IBM's minicomputer coun- 
terattack. Pressure was building within large or- 
ganizations for a mid-size computer to handle 
business deemed too low in priority for the 
company mainframe. IBM, which didn't make 
minis at the time, responded to the threat from 
down below by hatching a remote terminal sys- 
tem based on the interactive programming lan- 
guage APL. And by launching Alan Tomp- 
kins. 

"I was sitting in a meeting one day and I 
suddenly realized that there wasn't anyone there 
who could go much beyond spelling APL, 
which is a language that uses funny symbols 
and looks unintelligible," Tompkins recalls. "So 
I sort of disappeared for a couple of weeks and 
learned APL and then my whole mission in life 
became to go around fomenting APL-based 
guerilla movements." 

Tompkins discovered once again that IBM 
was a great organization, but the working en- 
vironment was still more suited to people who 
delighted in becoming the world's foremost au-

thority on the minutiae of some operating 
system. 

"I remember I went to a two-week class in 
Poughkeepsie, New York, to study MVS, a big 
IBM operating system. It was a marvel and it 
was really wonderful that it worked at all, but I 
had this sinking feeling in my heart that I 
couldn't get my emotions to the point of taking 
joy in knowing more about that operating sys- 
tem than anyone else." 

Toe to Toe with the Russkis. What had 
drawn Tompkins to Russian studies — to the 
economics, politics, and language — was this 
strange, interactive system known as commu- 
nisrn. How did you manipulate incentives in a 
planned economy and were there correlations 
between it and the organization of a large 
company? 

"It made me tend to think in terms of sys- 
tems of inputs and outputs. If you set up a 
charge-back system on a big mainframe incor- 
rectly, people won't use it properly. I'm a lot 
more interested in human aspects of technol- 
ogy. How do you get a machine, a computer, to 
be more productive considering that it's sur- 
rounded by human beings?" 

Tompkins's partial answer was to get more 
in touch with himself, his friends, and his sur- 
roundings. Like many others in the early seven- 
ties, he was caught up in the back-to-the-land 
movement. He'd spend his evenings curled up 
with The Whole Earth Catalog, thinking of ways 
to fulfill his long-time desire to move to north- 
ern New England. 

When a friend stumbled upon an available 
thirty-acre tract in Waitsfield, Tompkins, the 
friend, and three other families bought in — the 
Tompkinses relocating in 1976 after squire 
Tompkins engineered a transfer to IBM's Ver- 
mont office. 

Two years ago, Tompkins engineered his 
biggest move yet, bidding Big Blue a final adieu 
as he embarked on a bold adventure as an in- 
dependent programmer/consultant. It took him 
awhile to adjust to scheduling his time and get- 
ting his outgo in phase with his cash flow. 

"If you measure income just in dollars, my 
income is lower," he says, "but high income 
isn't one of my goals. If I spend all afternoon 
reading a journal or a book, I won't make any 
money, but it may enhance my ability to do an- 
other job." The big difference, as he saw it then 
and sees it now, is that he's doing a variety of 
challenging things — writing code for a trucking 
company minicomputer network, doing some 
consulting work via IBM for a Florida indus- 
trial group, interfacing an IBM minicomputer 
with a Japanese telephone exchange in rural Ne- 
vada. 

"The telephone exchange normally writes its 
toll billing data onto a magnetic tape," he ex- 
plains, "so there was an effort mounted to see 
whether, instead of having real magnetic tape, 
we could program a minicomputer to look hke 
a tape drive." 

Pastoral Symphony. Challenging jobs like 
these were what Tompkins was after when he 
left IBM, and so far the choice assignments 
have been finding him. Combine this serendip- 



ity with the earthly delights of country living, a 
four-level town house built into the side of a 
hill, fields of hay, and a tiny golden pond, and 
it's easy to see why Tompkins might think he's 
reliving a childhood fantasy from the summer 
of '44. 

"When I was little, there used to be a big 
golf course surrounded by woods next to our 
house," he says, recalling his early kinship with 
open spaces and rural areas. "All during the 
war, the place was mostly empty, and I used to 
spend hours and hours imagining various kinds 
of adventures happening to me as I ran around 
and around." 

Today, on a course of his own design, 
Tompkins is letting his imagination do the run- 
ning. After all, he's got more serious business to 
attend to, that yin and yang of Vermont living, 
circa 1983 — chopping and computing. 



Olivieri's Outline 

of . 
Word Processors 

by Peter Olivier! 



It's time to look at two more word process- 
ing packages. Screen Writer II and the original 
Magic Window. It's time also to reemphasize the 
importance of doing your homework. Taking 
the time to define your needs and preferences 
will help you determine which program is the 
right one for you and will reduce the number of 
packages you need to look at. 

In the end, only a handful of word process- 
ing packages will turn out to be really excellent. 
We've already looked at some of these {Zardax 
and Super-Text come to mind) and will examine 
others in the course of this series. Some require 
that a board be added to your Apple if you 
want eighty-column display; others give you 
eighty columns from within the software. And 
don't forget the hardware aspects of a word 
processing system. The monitor, the printer, a 
modification that gives you upper and lower 
case, an extra RAM card — all can be impor- 
tant factors in determining how useful your sys- 
tem will be. 

Screenwriter II. Sierra On-Line, 36575 Mudge 
Ranch Road, Coarsegold, CA 93614; (209) 683- 
6858. $129.95. 

Equipment required: 48K, one or two disk 
drives, monitor, printer. 

At one time this package was called Super- 
Scribe II. More has changed than the name — 
the program has undergone some enhance- 
ments as well. 

Screenwriter comes close to being a com- 
plete word processing system, offering many 
features that are normally found only on stand- 
alone systems. It's easy to move, insert, or delete 
text, and global search and replace and propor- 
tional spacing are also provided. 

This system allows you to display on the

SCTcen exactly what will be printed on paper, in- 
cluding upper and lower case letters, without a 
hardware modification. It has a seventy-col- 
umn display mode as well as forty columns for 
those who prefer it. 

A feature that's often found on standalone 
word processing systems (and not often in- 
cluded in microcomputer word processing pro- 
grams) is hyphenation. The proper placement of 
hyphens in text can be a real chore. Screen- 
Writer has a manual mode that allows you to 
indicate where words should be hyphenated or 
an automatic mode that hyphenates only when 
needed, according to guidelines established 
by you. 

If you're an author, you're likely to appre- 
ciate the option that allows you to create an in- 
dex for your document. As many as four sep- 
arate indices can be created for a single docu- 
ment. You simply surround every word you 
want to include in the index with a character of 
your choice. The words you indicate are then 
stored, along with their page numbers, and 
when you are ready you can direct the pro- 
gram to print an index. This feature should be 
considered a definite plus. 

When selecting a word processor, many 
people look for the capability to create and ac- 
cess a large document. Some word processing 
programs only allow you to work with small 
documents (ten pages or less). For many 
applications, of course, this is just fine. By con- 
trast. Screenwriter II uses the disk drive as a 
sort of "extension" of the Apple's memory. This 
setup enables the system to handle documents 
of up to fifty pages (which is about all that can 
fit on a single disk). Of course, it is still possible 
to link documents together to create final copy 
that's even longer. 

Special Features. This package has some 
unique aspects. One is the capability to edit one 
document while another document is printing 
(this is possible only if you have two disk drives 
in your system). The process is called spooling. 
Basically, a document is "put on a spool" (in 
this case, one of your disk drives) and unraveled 
as needed. 

Some other aspects of ScreenWriter also 
deserve mention. For starters, text files, binary 
files, and even Basic programs can be edited. In 
addition, the program offers user-definable keys 
(you might decide to have the sequence con- 
trol-R stand for "word processing," for exam- 
ple). There is a form letters option and page 
headers and footers can easily be incorporated 
into a document. 

Documentation. The ScreenWriter docu- 
mentation includes a user manual, a tutorial on 
disk, and a reference card. The user manual is 
nicely put together but doesn't include enough 
screen images to suit some users. While 
comprehensive (it runs almost two hundred 
pages), the manual is not always clear and easy 
to follow. It's much better than some of the 
manuals that accompany competing programs 
and better than On-Line's own earlier efforts, 
but it could still be improved. 

Essentially, the manual is divided into three 
sections. The first of these discusses the editor. 



something called runoff (for printing docu- 
ments), and the embedded commands needed 
to achieve certain kinds of formatting (a fea- 
ture not all users like). The intent of this first 
section is to get the user up and running. 

Section 2 is designed for the serious writer. 
It discusses some of the more advanced editing 
commands (such things as search and replace, 
merging, and tabs), the creation of mailing 
labels and letters, preparation of professional 
manuscripts, and special formatting com- 
mands. Section 3 of the manual is a summary of 
the commands that have been described 
throughout the text. 

The appendices are quite useful. They cover 
getting started, caring for disks, testing your 



printer, doing the shift key modification, and 
ways of converting SuperText II and Apple 
Writer files for use with ScreenWriter II. An er- 
ror-message list is also included here. 

User Views. Users talking about Screen- 
Writer's strengths cite not having to buy addi- 
tional hardware, being able to enter some 
printer commands (so as to be able to take ad- 
vantage of a printer's special features), and the 
ability to display from ten to seventy columns 
on the screen. (You should really have a moni- 
tor rather than a television set for viewing these 
characters, although they look fine on some 
television sets.) 

The cursor movement commands are not as 
convenient in ScreenWriter II as they are in

some other systems. Furthermore, some of the 
embedded commands don't work as specified. 
This can be frustrating. It's not necessarily easy 
to get one's printer to do everything it's sup- 
posed to be able to. 

As with most systems, the keys that must be 
pressed to accomplish certain maneuvers are 
sometimes cumbersome and difficult to re- 
member. (Where, oh where, are those sticky 
labels?) To advance a page in ScreenWriter II, 
for example, you press shift-control-P. Unfor- 
tunately, until a new keyboard is designed or an 
attachment to the game port is developed, this 
will always be the case to some degree with 
word processing programs on microcomputers. 
In any case, once you learn your word proc- 
essor's keystrokes, you won't notice the incon- 
venience. 

Conclusion. All in all, ScreenWriter is a 
thorough and professional word processing sys- 
tem. It includes all the features that even the 
most discerning user might want. It should cer- 
tainly be among the packages on your final list 
of candidates. 

Magic Window. Artsci, 5547 Satsuma Avenue, 
North Hollywood, CA 91601; (213) 985-2922. 
Equipment required: 48K, one disk drive, 
monitor, printer. $99.95. 

There are two versions of this program — the 
original forty-column Magic Window and 
Magic Window II, an enhanced version that 
offers forty, fifty-six, and eighty columns as well 
as other features. We'll look this month at the 



original Magic Window and consider Magic 
Window II later on in this series. 

Magic Window is one of the easier word 
processing systems to learn to use. In designing 
their system, the program's authors have tried 
to maintain the operating simplicity of a type- 
writer. As a result, the program operates in a 
somewhat different fashion than many of the 
word processors we've discussed to date. For 
one thing, it doesn't require the user to place 
any formatting commands within the text itself. 
Instead, a format subsystem is used to describe 
the page length, the size of the top margin, and 
the line-spacing requirements. (This is basically 
equivalent to placing the paper in a typewriter, 
setting the margins and the line spacing, and 
so on.) 

Once the form is designed, you can start 
typing your document. The cursor doesn't 
move; rather, it remains in the center of the 
screen as text passes by it, a process that resem- 
bles the way the carriage and paper function to- 
gether when you are using a typewriter. 

In this version of the program, only forty 
characters can be displayed on a line at one time 
(twenty on either side of the cursor). You can 
look at the entire line; you just can't see it all at 
once. While some people find this aspect of the 
program hard to get used to, others are not 
bothered by it at all. 

From the main menu, you can select the 
format subsystem just described or any of the 
options that follow. 



The Editor. When you enter the editor, you 
are in a position to enter text. Simply start typ- 
ing. Escape can be used to signify an upper-case 
letter, although an inexpensive hardware 
modification is recommended so that upper and 
lower case can be displayed. 

All editing commands are entered by using 
the control key in combination with other keys. 
For example, control-Q moves the cursor up 
one line; control-Z moves it down one line. The 
cursor can be moved to the first line of text in a 
file, twelve lines ahead, twelve lines back, one 
line up or down, one character forward or back- 
ward, and to the beginning or end of the file. 

Other edit commands allow you to search 
for a particular string, move to the top of a par- 
ticular page, delete a character, insert a char- 
acter, delete a line, recover a deleted line, insert 
a line, and justify lines or center them. In addi- 
tion, you can split and glue lines (this is 
analogous to the "cut and paste" features for 
moving text that are available in many word 
processing packages). 

The Filer. This subsystem performs file 
maintenance. A menu is presented that allows 
you to load, save, and delete files. You can also 
save unformatted files so that information 
you've entered can be recalled later and used in 
a variety of ways. 

The Printer Subsystem. This subsystem 
presents you with a list of choices that will affect 
the final printing of your document. It is here 
that you can identify which pages of a docu- 
ment are to be printed. 

The Configuration Subsystem. The con- 
figuration subsystem is ordinarily the first 
selection you'll make when you're beginning to 
use this program. This system defines for Magic 
Window what components make up your partic- 
ular system. You're asked whether or not you 
have a lower-case video adapter, what slot your 
printer is in, and whether or not you want an 
audible sound when you press a key. You're 
also asked for some information about your 
printer. It's possible to put printer control char- 
acters in the body of the text you create so that 
you can make use of the special features of your 
particular printer. 

The User Guide. The Magic Window 
manual is very clearly written. Because of the 
ease of operation of the package, a lengthy 
guidebook is not really necessary. With the ap- 
pendices, which contain information on install- 
ing RAM printer drivers and on using the 
Apple parallel interface, the manual contains 
less than sixty pages. Included in the manual is a 
very handy reference card that displays (in 
color) what the keyboard looks like when the 
keys are "labeled" with the appropriate Magic 
Window commands. 

Summary. Magic Window is a very nicely 
done package, and it is certainly one of the eas- 
iest to learn to use. It may not have all the "bells 
and whistles" of some of the other systems, but 
clearly it contains most of the essential features 
of a good word processor. If ease of use is one 
of your primary considerations, then Magic 
Window should be a major contender on your 
selection list.

Tools of the Craft, Part 19 

The Complete Cable. As you read this, most parts of the United 
Slates are firmly in the grip of CTOtchety Old Man Winter. If you're living 
through a cold spell yourself, you've probably already discovered that 
the versatile Apple makes a dandy hand warmer. With any luck, the fol- 
lowing listing, which presents the Cable data manipulation program in 
its entirety, will give you plenty of reason to huddle near your silicon 
stove. Before proceeding with this month's material, look over the 
program carefully, noting changes and additions from last month. 
In particular, examine the global tools SCapitalize, Alphanumeric, 
SNToString, DisplayHome, GoodAddr, GoodStreet, and GoodHNum 
first. Familiarity with these routines will enable you to understand 
ChangeTown and Display Town more easily.

Points of Interest. Because the listing is designed to be self-explana-

ble's innards without first having browsed the hsting from top to bot- 
tom at least once. You need to get in the habit of learning about a pro-

gram from reading only the listing; in many cases, the listing is the only 
"program manual" you'll receive! 

SCapitalize and Alphanumeric. The listing alone is sufficient to clar- 
ify the two minor tools SCapitalize and Alphanumeric, so we will 
not discuss them here except to note that both are so handy that they are 
bound to be needed by future programs. By coding them as independent 
subroutines, we have made it easier to transplant them when the time 
comes. You might find it worthwhile to collect the Pascal source code for 
such tools as Capital, SCapitalize, Alphanumeric, SkipBlanks, IntTo- 
String, and Goodlnteger into a single file named "TOOLS.TEXT". In 
the future, whenever you devise a new tool, add its source code to the 
"TOOLS" file as well. Keeping all your "utility routines" in one place 
will prove more and more convenient the longer you follow the Path. 

SNToString. The job of SNToString is to produce the String repre- 
sentation of a StreetName. As a data conversion procedure, then, it is 
similar in purpose and design to IntToString, which we developed last 
month. SNToString is somewhat less complicated, of course, needing 
nothing more than a CASE statement at its heart. It also differs from its 
predecessor in its "padding" behavior. 

Remember, a field width is nothing more than the minimum num- 
ber of character places that a data representation must fill. If the "nat- 
ural" String representation for a given datum occupies less than the re- 
quired amount of space, a data conversion routine must fill, or "pad," 
the unused space with neutral characters (usually blanks). A conversion 
routine determines, according to its design, where to append these extra 
"pad" characters. 

Tacking pad characters onto the left side shoves a data representa- 
tion over to the right side of the field. Adding them on the right side 
keeps the datum on the left side of the field. Flitting equal amounts of 
padding on both sides has the effect of positioning the datum in the 
center of the field. 

As implemented here, IntToString positions convert data on the right 
side of the field, while SNToString puts its data on the left. The two rou- 
tines differ in their padding behaviors because of the conceptual differ- 
ences that exist between StreetNames and Integers. Numbers are fre- 
quently displayed in columns, such that their rightmost digits are flush 
with the right column margin. Data that look like English words, such as 
StreetNames, are usually displayed flush with the left margin. So, IntTo- 
String and SNToString are designed to pad properly in the majority of 
cases. Compare the set of statements used for String padding in IntTo- 
String with the set in SNToString; note that each is, in some sense, the 
mirror image of the other. 

DisplayHome. DisplayHome's brevity is due to the existence of Int- 
ToString and SNToString, which perform most of the work. The rou- 
tine is so small, in fact, that commentary — not working code — domi- 
nates its listing. Look at the output examples as given in the comments; 
then try to see how DisplayHome might produce each display. In par- 
ticular, notice that the HouseNumber in each example is padded with 
blanks, while the account number is padded with zeros. The padding 
mechanism treats HouseNumbers and account numbers equally, yet the 
visual impacts of the Strings produced differ greatly. The difference is 
clearly due to the programmer's choice of "padding pattern." 

DisplayHome also demonstrates that it is not always appropriate to 
place numbers on the right sides of output fields. If a number is the left- 
most item on a display line, as it is in the format chosen for Display- 
Home, aesthetic sensibilities almost demand that the leftmost digit be 
aligned flush with the left-hand margin. To be fair, IntToString permits 
this, after a fashion. If you specify a field width of 0 or 1, you disable the 
padding process, and the datum in question will then be flush with the 
left side of the field. However, in this instance, such a choice would most 
likely force the street names and account numbers out of their own neat 
alignment. Do you see why? 

With a little thought, you can also devise examples in which left-hand 
placement is clearly inappropriate for certain nonnumeric data, thus in- 
validating our design choice for SNToString. The best solution is to per- 
mit the caller of a data conversion routine to specify the padding behav- 
ior that is most suited to the datum in question. Given the data type 
Orientation, defined as 

Orientation = (Left, Center, Right); 



you could introduce a new parameter to both SNToString and IntTo- 
String, as follows: 

PROCEDURE 
lntToString(Source: Integer; 

VAR Dest: String; 
MinFW: Integer; 
Pad: String; 

Placement: Orientation); 
PROCEDURE 
SNToString(StName: StreetName; 
VAR Dest: String; 
MinFW: Integer; 
Pad: String; 

Placement: Orientation); 

Placement would tell each routine where to place the data representa- 
tion within the specified field. Thus, 

lntToString(23,DestString,5,'0',Right) 
would tell IntToString to produce '00023', while 

lntToString(587,DestString,10,'.',Left) 

would cause the routine to generate '587 ', and so on. SNToString 

would act similarly. In future, all routines presented in this column for 
the purpose of converting data to string representations will allow the 
caller to specify left, right, or center placement. When next you see Int- 
ToString and SNToString, they will also have been modified to respect 
this standard. If you feel ambitious, you might try updating your own 
copies of these routines to reflect the new design. 

GoodHNum and GoodStreet. Of the "fraternal twins," Good- 
HNum and GoodStreet, GoodStreet is the more interesting. Good- 
HNum merely adds a "range check" to the action of Goodlnteger, while 
GoodStreet demonstrates some useful string-handling techniques. In 
particular, the expression 

(Copy(S, TSP, Length(CName)) = CName) 
is True when the String CName exists within S beginning at position 
TSP. In GoodStreet, this expression is used to determine whether or not 
the String under examination, S, matches a given candidate StreetName.

GoodStreet tries to match S with each StreetName, in succession, until 
every StreetName has been tried or a match occurs. 

As we agreed in a previous column, the user should be able to 
abbreviate the first address in the town to 'F' and the last to 'L'. If it 
weren't for these "abbreviated addresses," GoodAddr would involve lit- 
tle more than calling GoodHNum and GoodStreet. However, special 
cases always complicate matters, and so more than half of GoodAddr is 
dedicated to handling 'F' and 'L'. 

We've seen that, when accepting human input, the polite computer 
ignores leading and trailing blanks that are obviously unrelated to the 
data. When given a regular address, GoodAddr relies on GoodHNum 
and GoodStreet to ignore any extra blanks. In the case of the abbrevi- 
ated addresses, we use a trick to accomphsh the task. We concatenate a 
blank to the end of the input String, S, skip any leading blanks using 
SkipBlanks, and check to see whether or not we find 'F ' or 'L ' at the 
current scan position in S. Think carefully about why this guarantees 
that GoodAddr will always accept the single character 'F' or 'L' regard- 
less of the number of blanks that come before or after it but will always 
reject multiple-letter input such as 'FIRST', 'LAST', 'F&' or 'L*'. Do 
you think that GoodAddr should accept 'FIRST' and 'LAST' as well as 
'F' and 'L'? If so, modify the routine to do this, but make sure that it still 
rejects input such as 'FARKLE', 'LUSTY', 'F123', and 'L&M'. 

DisplayTown and ChangeTown. DisplayTown requires the user to 
specify a range of Town addresses, then displays the Home information 
(so far, only the account number) for every address in the given range. 
Nested FOR-loops — the outer one stepping from Street to Street and 
the inner one moving from Home to Home — are used to drive the dis- 
play scan. The FOR-loop is appropriate in this case, because of the de- 
terministic nature of the scan; the starting and ending points are well 
known even before loop execution begins. 

ChangeTown is not so deterministic. It only asks the user for a start- 
ing address, then scans the Tovra, Home by Home, until either the user 
decides to quit or the Town's last Home is scanned. As every Home is 
scanned, the user has the option of quitting the Change process, skipping 
the current Home, or changing that Home's account number. As in Dis- 
playTown, two nested loops are used in scanning the Town, but neither 
can be a FOR-loop because of the complexity of the termination condi- 
tions involved. 

Remember, FOR-loops are appropriate only for pure "counting" ap- 
plications, such as the display scan in DisplayTown. When a loop may 
terminate on any one of several conditions, you must program it using ei- 
ther a WHILE-DO or a REPEAT-UNTIL construction. REPEAT-UN- 
TIL loops are employed in ChangeTown because each loop body must 
execute at least once before the termination condition can be checked. 
The computer must actually ask the user whether or not to quit, or it 
must increment the loop counter past the limit value, before it can de- 
cide if another iteration is required. Since both these actions are properly 
part of the loop bodies, REPEAT-UNTIL loops are most appropriate 
here. If you think that WHILE-DO loops would be clearer or more effi- 
cient, try writing your own versions and send them to this magazine for 
verification. 

There is a problem inherent in abandoning FOR-loops, however. 
The inner REPEAT-loop in ChangeTown relies partially on a "count- 
er," the variable HNumNow, in order to determine the status of its 
termination condition. According to the UNTIL clause, inner-loop exe- 
cution may cease whenever HNumNow becomes greater than Max- 
HNum. As we might expect, the loop body contains a statement that en- 
sures that this part of the termination condition will eventually hold true. 
Specifically, at the end of the loop body, we assign Succ(HNumNow) to 
HNumNow, thus incrementing that variable's value by one step. 

So long as the user doesn't specifically tell the computer to quit 
changing account numbers, the inner loop will iterate until HNumNow 
eventually equals MaxHNum. At the end of this crucial iteration, the last 
statement in the loop body will attempt to increment HNumNow so that 
its value equals HNumNow -I- 1. At this point, the Pascal system will 
abort the Cable program, complaining of a value range error. The system 
is well within its rights to issue this error message. Our program does, in 
fact, try to assign HNumNow a value that lies outside the HouseNum- 
ber range. 



We have created a paradox. The value of HNumNow that signals 
loop termination is not a valid HouseNumber. Whenever our program at- 
tempts to assign that value to HNumNow, the Pascal system steps in and 
aborts execution. Certainly, loop execution does cease at the desired 
point, but not in a friendly manner! How do we resolve our problem? 
Actually, there are several steps we might take; each, however, involves 
compromise, and one entails considerable frustration, on the way to a 
dead end! Let's examine each option, along with its consequences: 

Enlarge the true HouseNumber range, leave loop untouched: We would 
like to define HouseNumber as "1 .. MaxHNum-H 1" in order to leave 
room for the "spillover" that is a natural consequence of our REPEAT- 
UNTIL loop. Unfortunately, we can't define a subrange in terms of ex- 
pressions like "MaxHNum -I- 1", so we'd be forced to define another 
constant, TrueMaxH, say, to be equal to a value one greater than 
MaxHNum. Thus, in keeping with the MaxHNum value that we have 
used so far, TrueMaxH would be set equal to 1000. Then, the House- 
Number range may be redefined as "1 .. TrueMaxH" while we remain 
careful never to assign numbers greater than MaxHNum to any House- 
Number variables. The only permissible exception to our rule is the occa- 
sional "off-by-one case," such as the needy REPEAT-UNTIL loop. Of 
course, if ever we decided to change MaxHNum, we would also have to 
remember to change TrueMaxH; the compiler has no way of knowing 
that the value of one constant depends upon that of the other. 

This method of compensating for the spillover — by extending the 
HouseNumber type but restricting the bulk of computation to a slightly 
smaller subrange — is like asking a chronically tardy friend to arrive five 
or ten minutes before you really want to meet with him. You know you 
can't keep him from being late, so you arrange matters such that his 
tardiness is always irrelevant. In the same way, we can't avoid the spill- 
over without changing the loop, so we redefine the limits of the House- 
Number type so that, in the eyes of the Pascal system, no spillover 
occurs. 

There is one noteworthy drawback to this otherwise comfortable

solution: since the array Street is indexed by HouseNumber values, add- 
ing any numbers to the HouseNumber range increases the size of a 
Street. This increase is superfluous, since we intend never to use any 
HouseNumbers above MaxHNum. We can either choose to ignore the 
waste, or we might redefine a Street as "ARRAY [1 .. MaxHNum] OF 
Home." Most programmers choose the latter adaptation. 

Rewrite the loop, leave the HouseNumber and Street definitions alone: 
This is what many b^inning programmers would choose to do. The first 
attempt would probably be to change the termination condition to 
include "HNumNow = MaxHNum" instead of "HNumNow 
> MaxHNum". It quickly becomes clear that such a modification makes 
it impossible ever to Change any Home that is numbered above 998! 
This is because MaxHNum is incremented at the bottom of the loop! 
When HNumNow = (MaxHNum - 1), the loop body's last official act 
would be to increment HNumNow to the value of MaxHNum. The new 
termination condition would hold, loop iteration would cease, and the 
Change process would never be able to affect the last Home on the 
current Street. 

If you think we can eliminate our problems by moving the incre- 
menting of HNumNow to the top of the loop body, think again! True, 
the loop would be able to process the last Home on any Street, but it 
would also always skip the starting address, as specified by the user, be- 
cause the program, as currently written, sets HNumNow equal to the 
HouseNumber of the starting address initially, and the first thing the 
loop body would do would be to increment the value of HNumNow! 

At this point, the last gasp of the thoroughly confused novice pro- 
grammer is "Aha! Just initialize HNumNow to one value less than the 
desired starting HouseNumber and let the loop body do its thing!" But 
what if the starting HouseNumber is 1? You can't assign 0 to a variable 
of type HouseNumber, because 0 is not within the permissible range. 
Any attempt at such an assignment causes a value range error. 

And so, we've come full circle. If there is an elegant way to solve the 
spillover problem by rearranging the statements in our program, it is not 
readily apparent. This approach to the problem fails to provide a 
solution. 

Cheat — leave HouseNumber. Street, and loop body alone; tell Pascal 
system to ignore any spillover. This is the more dangerous of the two 
workable tactics we can use to eliminate our difficulty. As you might 
expect, it is the one we have chosen to use in Cable, in a blatant attempt 
to live dangerously and prime ourselves to study advanced topics that 
we'll be covering very soon. 

Under normal circumstances, the Apple Pascal compiler habitually 
sneaks special P-codes into any object program it produces. These spe- 
cial codes implement the Pascal system's range-checking facility. For 
instance, after generating the P-codes that compute an array (or string) 
index, the compiler will produce a code sequence that, when executed, 
determines whether or not the index value produced by the first P-code 
sequence is proper for the array in question. If so, program activity is 
permitted to continue. If not, control is passed to the operating system's 
error-handling routine. 

Suppose the compiler is processing an assignment statement. First, it 
generates the P-codes that compute the value to be assigned. Then, it 
produces a sequence that checks to see if the computed value falls within 
the acceptable range of values for the destination variable. If it does, 
the assignment is completed, but, if it doesn't, the system error-handler is 
called, as in the array-indexing example. 

The extra range-checking code emitted by the compiler is said to be 
"invisible." Obviously, the P-machine sees and executes this code, but 
you, as the programmer or user, are not usually aware that it is there, 
protecting the program from going too far astray in its computations. 
Range-checking code might therefore be called a "freebie," except that it 
does cost you memory and execution speed. After all, the range-check- 
ing P-codes must take up some memory space, and they certainly re- 
quire a finite amount of time in which to execute. On the other hand, you 
usually want to know if your fledgling program contains bugs. The slight 
increase in program size and execution time is a small price to pay to 
know that the system is watching out for — and guarding itself against — 
your mistakes. 

In the case of ChangeTown, however, we have written a reasonable 



loop, which, in certain situations, attempts a "suspicious" — but safe — 
assignment. Because very few assignments involving out-of-range values 
will ever be truly "safe," the system is certainly correct in warning us, one 
way or another, of the danger that lies along our chosen path. Granted, 
to use the run-time error-handling mechanism as a notification channel is 
a bit extreme. Even so, the system is simply looking out for our best 
interests. On the other hand, after we have acknowledged the possibility 
of our error and have checked our code thoroughly to be sure that its 
"illegitimate actions" are made only for legitimate purposes, we are justi- 
fied in informing the compiler that our hands need no holding; that we 
are capable of writing well-behaved code. In other words, we are free to 
disable range-checking. How? 

A Digression: The R- Compiler Directive. The compiler usually 
ignores all comments. However, comments in which a dollar sign lies 
immediately to the right of the opening delimiter (with no blanks in be- 
tween) are taken as instructions to the compiler itself. More precisely, 
the text that follows the dollar sign, up to the end of the comment, is 
taken as containing compiler directives, which are used to control the 
compiler's behavior. That is, with compiler directives, you — the pro- 
grammer — can tell the compiler how to do its job. 

A detailed study of compiler directives is scheduled for a future col- 
umn. Now, we are only concerned with telling the compiler to quit emit- 
ting range-checking code. Here is the directive that accomplishes this: 

(*$R-*) 

As you might expect, when range-checking is off, and you wish to enable 
it again, you use the following 

r$R+*) 

The compiler will produce no range-checking code for statements 
that occur after an R— directive until it encounters an R-(- directive. Pas- 
cal's range-checking features are intended to help you discover subtle but 
potentially catastrophic errors in your programs. If you defeat this pro- 
tection, you make it possible for erroneous program behavior to escape 
undetected. Thus, you should disable range-checking only after careful 
study of your program's construction. Only when you are convinced that 
your program is sound and that there's no better method of achieving 
your ends should you issue the R— directive. By refusing the Pascal sys- 
tem's help, you volunteer to be entirely responsible for any errors in your 
programs, especially those that the unrestrained system might conceiv- 
ably find through range-checking. In general R- should be applied only 
to those statements that would directly benefit by it and not to one state- 
ment more! In Cable, only one statement in the entire program is com- 
piled without range-checking. To have extended the effect of R- into 
other areas of the program would have been sloppy and negligent on the 
part of the programmer. 

The compiler always elects to produce range-checking code for as- 
signments to variables of scalar subrange types but not for assignments 
involving variables of unabridged scalar types. The HouseNumber data 
type is a subrange of Integer. Thus, range-checking code is emitted for all 
assignments to HNumNow because it is a HouseNumber variable. 
StreetNow, on the other hand, is declared as being a type StreetName. 
This type is not a subrange of any other type; it is a complete, un- 
abridged scalar enumeration. Therefore, no range-checking code is ever 
emitted after assignments to StreetNow. This is why we must use the R— 
compiler directive to disable range-checking after the incrementing of 
HNumNow but need not worry about the incrementing of StreetNow. 

Next Month: Beyond Cable. Finally, you have the complete Cable 
program in hand. Take the opportunity to play around with it; study it; 
get to know it so well that you can't help thinking of ways to improve 
and enhance it. When you sit down to read next month's column — the 
conclusion of the series on Cable — keep your ideas (and a program list- 
ing) handy, because we'll explore motivations and methods for tailoring 
this program to fit more closely the industry it purports to serve. In the 
process, we'll examine some of the considerations involved in modifying 
a lengthy program. 

Beginning in March, we'll delve into advanced, sometimes esoteric 
aspects of the Apple Pascal language and operating system. If there are 
specific topics you would like to discuss, now is the time to suggest them! 
Your mail is not ignored; indeed, it served as the inspiration for the

The Schoolhouse Apple 

by Jean Varven 



There's a little of the artist in each of us, so they say. It just needs a ht- 
tle encouragement. 

With that in mind, the current installment of Schoolhouse Apple is 
devoted to a colorful and longer than usual Logo tutorial. Join Jim 
Muller as he explores the world of recursion and the intricate patterns 
this procedure can be used to create. 

Next month, educational software takes center stage. Some exciting 
and innovative programs have been released lately; we'll take a good 
look at a whole bunch of them.

Have you taught your turtle any good tessellations lately? 

You know what tessellations are. They show up everywhere — in wall- 
paper, linoleum, tile, brick houses, and even in nature. When quilters 
painstakingly piece together cotton squares, triangles, and other geomet- 
ric shapes to form intricate patterns, they are making tessellations. Take 
away the honey and bees from a honeycomb and the result is a natural

tessellation of repeating hexagons. One of the deans at a Southwest Con- 
ference University who doodles during conferences and luncheons 
creates tessellations that evolve into elaborate works of art. 

As you've probably determined by now, tessellations are patterns 
made by repeating the same geometric shape or combination of shapes 
again and again. Children can learn a great deal about the way geomet- 
ric shapes fit together by carefully examining tessellations and by design- 
ing their own tessellations on graph paper or with cut-out shapes that can 
be manipulated. 

Imaginative young Logo users will have fun designing their own tes- 
sellations. They'll enjoy seeing, by means of off-computer activities, how 
shapes fit together to make beautiful repeating designs. But tessellations 
using Logo are not exactly child's play. It takes a more experienced Lo- 
goite to translate these kinds of designs into turtle graphics. 

The challenge of teaching the turtle to draw an elaborate tessellation 
requires imagination and an understanding of both conditional state- 
ments and recursion. In fact, creating tessellations provides a great way to 
experiment with the power of recursion, an important aspect of Logo. 

Recursion is the ability of a procedure to "call itself." In its simplest 
usage, recursion can cause a procedure to call itself "forever" or until it is 
stopped manually. Here's an example of a simple recursive procedure. 

TO SPIRAL :S :A 
FD :S 
RT :A 

SPIRAL :S + 3 :A 
END 

This procedure will continue to run until the programmer stops it. 

Adding a conditional IF-THEN statement is one way of building a 
stop into the procedure. 



MIT Logo 

TO SPIRAL :S A 
IF :S > 150 STOP 
FD :S 
RT :A 

SPIRAL :S + 3 :A 
END 



Apple Logo 

TO SPIRAL :S :A 
IF :S > 150 [STOP] 
FD :S 
RT :A 

SPIRAL ;S + 3 A 
END 



The rest of the examples will be given in Apple Logo. If you're using 
MIT Logo, remove the brackets in the conditional statements. 

Conditional statements enable us to stop a procedure in a variety of 
ways. For example, when the turtle reaches a certain X or Y coordinate, 
we can use IF :XCOR = 100 [STOP] to stop a procedure; when a proce- 
dure has been repeated a certain number of times, we can use IF -.TIMES 
= 10 [STOP] to stop it; and when the turtle faces a certain direction, (IF 
[HEADING = 180 [STOP]) does the trick. Using conditional state- 
ments allows us to repeat a shape or design, to stop, to move the turtle, 
or to continue drawing. In other words, using conditional statements 
gives us the power to draw tessellations. 

The inspiration for a couple of the designs included in this article 
came from Trianglepoint , a needlework book by Sherlee Lantz. Lantz 
has studied the use of triangles and hexagons in artwork over the cen- 
turies. What we're about to do is participate in an ancient art form using 
a very modern tool! The result of our efforts will look like figure 1. 

As usual, we'll break down what we're going to do into its simplest 
form. Thus, our first task is simply to define a triangle with a variable. 

TO TRI :N 

REPEAT 3 [FD :N RT 120]

By studying the result, we discover that a triangular design or unit is 



The List Handler is, without doubt, 
much more than a mailmerge 
program. 

Presto! List Handler turns your 
Apple® into a quick response file cab- 
inet with room to grow storage space. 
With List Handler you can hold up to 
3000 records per drive so that 24000 
can be kept on-line at the same time 
with multiple disk drives. 
These records can be addresses if 
you choose, but here's where the ver- 
satility and flexibility come in. 



Put what you like on those records! 

• inventory • product lists 

• form letters • short newsletters 

• mailing lists • personnel directories 

• invoices • labels 
The list is endless. 

The List Handler will run on one or 
more drives, read and write DIF for- 
mat and has unlimited sort fields. 
List Handler can stand alone or as an 
interface with your Word Handler (or 
most other word processors) for the 



most efficient word processing duo 
around. 

The List Handler will surprise you, 
but the first surprise will be the price! 
At 89.95 the List Handler is the best 
and the only buy of its type around. 
The enormity of Santa's job may have 
you skeptical of Santa's exist- 
ence—but when you see the List 
Handler you might just believe in 
Santa again! See your Apple dealer 
for the List Handler.

Figure 3. ROW. 

ROW contains a conditional statement that tells the turtle to stop af- 
ter repeating the procedure a prescribed number of times. For example, if 
the command ROW 4 is given, the turtle carries out the procedure four 
times. The recursive line, ROW.T - 1, calls the procedure ROW 4 — 1 
or ROW 3. The next time it becomes ROW 2, then ROW 1, then ROW 
0. The test line, IF T = 0 [STOP], causes the procedure to stop. (The tur- 
tle reads that line every time it repeats the procedure, but as long as T is 
not 0 the turtle keeps going.) 

Here's the procedure we'll use so that the row can run horizontally 
on the screen and so that an odd number of TRIS can be included. See 
figure 4.

Now all that remains is to figure out a way to repeat TRIROW

follows will position the turtle in the upper right-hand corner of the 
screen.

Two more move procedures can be defined to position the turtle to 
draw one TRIROW from left to right and one from right to left. Experi- 
mentation reveals that five TRIROWs seem to make a more esthetically 
pleasing pattern than four, so a TRIROW has been included in the con- 
ditional statement. Otherwise, because of the need for two different move 
procedures, the LATTICE procedure will always draw an even number 
of TRIROWs.

As with everything else in Logo, there's something more you can do 
using the procedures we've been working with. As you look at how 
LATTICE covers the screen, you may begin to wonder if there's any way 
of adding color in a more dramatic way. Instead of just changing the 
background and drawing with a different color pen, wouldn't it be great 
to be able to change the color throughout the design, making it resemble 
a rug of multicolored yarn? 

Because the turtle retraces its steps so many times, this is no easy 
task. One way of approaching things would be to use a random com- 
mand with conditionals, but we want more control so we can be sure that 
color changes throughout the procedure. If we use a random command, 
it's possible that we will end up with blocks of color (look at QUILT). By 
changing the colors on all of the different levels of the procedure and by 
using the conditional controls, we can create a "controlled form of ran- 
domization" so that the colors will keep changing. 

The six modified procedures follow.

t's not my desire to alarm anyone unnecessarily, but I do feel 
it imperative to apprise whomever I can of a situation that is 
becoming critical in nature. This may well be my last oppor- 
tunity in communication. The realization that something was 
amiss came to me late one night. 1 had gone to bed and was 
lying there, idly mulling over events of the day, when I be- 
came aware of activity of some sort in the den. There was a low hum- 
ming sound, punctuated by occasional mechanical clacking, which 
caused me to rise and put on a robe. Instinctively, I withdrew my trusty 
.085-caliber Lone Star water pistol from the bedside commode and 
stuffed it in a pocket. 

From just outside the den door, the sounds were a bit louder. I 
grabbed the knob and threw open the door, drawing the water pistol and 
turning on the lights simultaneously — no easy feat for one who is used 
to, at most, two actions at any given moment. 

"All right . . . what's going on in here?" I commanded in my best 
stentorian voice. 

The den was quite empty. I poked randomly at the drapes, peered 
under the divan, even looked in a few drawers — which shows to what ex- 
tremes one will go when investigating noises at night. The one thing I did 
notice was that I must have forgotten to turn off my Apple; a pale light 
glowed from below the shift key. I disregarded my oversight and snapped 
the switch. One more look around assured me that I'd heard some elec- 
tronic switchery from the computer. Never fully understanding the inner 
mysteries of the thing, I allowed as how it could be fully capable of mak- 
ing internal noises of its own accord. 

The whole incident would have been forgotten had it not been for a 
printed line I discovered the next morning while adjusting the Epson; 

"We really must be more careful," 

1 didn't recall writing that the day before. And I didn't recall having 
to be careful of anything in particular. I dismissed the whole matter by 
removing the offending sheet of paper and discarding it. 

Later, the same day, I was finishing up an incisive article for PBX & 
Switchboard Operator's Monthly when I became aware of a pronounced 
lag between my keystrokes and the printer. I pulled the sheet up to see 
what was happening and found there was an additional line of what ap- 
peared to be random gobbledygook, followed by an obscenity. I was 
lightly astonished. I didn't write that — PBX&SOM would never accept 
such language! 

It crossed my mind that my Apple was — how shall we say? — going 
dotty on me. Perhaps Apples, like Honda Civics, had a required main- 
tenance schedule to be adhered to, I thought. Sort of an electronic lube 
job, so to speak. Searching through the owner's manual provided noth- 
ing to suggest a 1,500-mile or 1 ,950,000-byte maintenance — whichever 
came first. However, on the assumption that I might have overlooked an 
instruction, I took it to my local Apple dealer and explained the symp- 
toms. He accepted this with callous indifference (Apple dealers, I under-

stand, are required to complete a course in Callous Indifference), took it 
into the back room, returned several minutes later, and pronounced it 
well, considering the amount of pipe droppings under the keyboard. 

But it happened again that afternoon. Another line of what, for want 
of better description, might be described as hash magically appeared 
printed midway in a letter to a friend. Since my friend was not a 
computer type, she would be hard pressed to understand what 
RR8M+sdd3P/bat5 represented in an otherwise cogent letter. I couldn't 
erase the hash, since it didn't appear on the screen, and a second printing 
of the letter showed that it was still there, so I ended up striking it out 
with a felt pen; messy looking at best. I spent that evening rereading the 
entire manual, looking for some instructions on hash removal to no 
avail. 

Once more, a short article on the Romance of Wallpaper provided a 
framework for two more hnes of hash, one on each page, both identical 
in content: DDf5$k/bat< 2;2dG. Retrieving a copy of the letter in sub- 
ject, I compared the two hashes, finding them entirely dissimilar save for 
the word bat and the fact that both began with two capital letters. 

My incredibly analytical mind leapt into action and in practically no 
time at all came up with nothing. After exhausting attempts at close 
logic, I tried entering the last hash in a complicated program that I de- 
vised from years of experience: 

10 HOME 

20 DDf5$k/bat< 2;2dG 
30 END 

Advanced programmers will recognize the deft hand of a master in 
that listing, but, for the neophytes among the readers, I must explain that 
I always start out with home, since it makes for a tidy screen. Fully pre- 
pared for my usual syntax error, I hit run. Nothing appeared on the 
screen, but the printer let off a short burst and the cursor winked its pres- 
ence. I pulled out the paper and read: 

"Not now. Later. 3DD." 

I was well aware now that something peculiar was going on some- 
where between the wall outlet and the head of the printer. This time, the 



whole works went into the dealership — Apple, printer, disk drive, even 
my game paddles. Two days later, accompanied by what I considered to 
be a disproportionate bill, the works were handed back to me with 
precious little ceremony and another bland diagnosis of good health — af- 
ter they swept out the pipe droppings. 

That same night, I discovered 1 had again left the Apple on and chid- 
ed myself for a memory slowly turning to lime Jello. Yet, it gnawed on 
me that I really had turned the machine off. To mend this flaw in an 
otherwise perfect character, I devised a mnemonic system whereby I 
would place a shoe in the center of the bed, removing it only after ascer- 
taining that all electronics were shut down for the night. An infallible 
plan, 1 complimented myself 

Then, the noise awoke me, this time in the early hours of the morn- 
ing. With my Lone Star in hand, I again attacked the den, to discover 
nothing — except that the Apple was on! 

1 began dwelling on the problem to the point where my writing 
suffered more from that than it did from those rampant hash lines. I 
stopped shaving, drank more coffee than usual, quit watching the late 
news, and devoted more time to bursting into the den at odd moments, 
hoping to surprise someone — anyone. I even took to wearing my Lone 
Star in a concealed holster on my person at all times except, of course, 
during bathing, when it sat handy nearby. The hash ruined practically all 
attempts I made at communication with the outside world, including 
those stories and articles my editors were demanding. The random let- 
ters, numbers, and symbols increased in volume. The Apple shop began 
drawing their shades and putting up a "closed" sign when they saw me 
approaching. I was becoming a stranger to my friends, and even the cats 
took to avoiding me, except for around dinner time. 

"I know there's someone in there," I spoke directly to the Apple. 
"Why are you doing this to me? Why don't you show yourself?" I even 
tried threatening it with my water pistol (knowing how fearful elec- 
tronics are of raw water). Nothing produced any results. The hash kept 
coming. I tried different wall outlets, tried setting the disk drive on its 
side, even bought an expensive "glitch-kicker." Nothing.

SOF TA I 1^

One night, during a terrible thunderstorm, with the trees dramatical- 
ly scraping the side of the house, the printer wrote on its own: 
"Give up. There is no use resisting." 

There was a flash of lightning and a boom of thunder. That really 
boggled my mind. I slept in the Honda that night. 

The next day, a UPS truck pulled up and the driver traded my auto- 
graph for a small package. I opened it and there was a card clad in 
blister-wrap. No invoice, no shipping tag, no instructions, only a typed 
note: 

"Install in slot 3." 

I called the Apple shop, disguising my voice so they wouldn't hang 
up on me again, and asked if they had sent the card, but they denied any 
knowledge of it. They couldn't even tell what it was by my description or 
why it would go in slot 3. I went into the den and opened the lid of the 
computer and verified that slot 3 was vacant, but decided to delay instal- 
lation. I glanced over at the Epson and there was a line printed: 

"Install the card NOW." 

"No," I said to it. "Not until I know more of what I'm doing." 

I tried calling a friend to see if he might have sent it but the phone 
had gone dead. Apparently they were working on the lines after the re- 
cent storm. I noticed the clock had stopped as well. To verify the power 
outage, I flipped the light switch; it was quite dead. I don't know why, 
but on a wild hunch I went over and flicked the switch on the Apple. The 
light came on and it beeped as the DOS booted. I looked up at the clock; 
it was still stopped. 

"All right, now cut that out!" I shouted at the thing. "I suppose you 
think you're being clever, whoever you are. . . ." 

The printer clacked briefly: 

"Imperative you install card NOW." 

"You win. But I'm going to find out what's behind this if it kills me!" 
I didn't particularly like my choice of words. I jammed the card into the 
slot, not caring which way was front or back. "There! I hope it fries!" 

Clack-clack-clack: 

"Thank you." 

The phone rang and I jumped a foot. It was the editor of Sand & 
Gravel asking where my article on aggregates was, as he was holding a 
spot open for it. This at least took my mind off the immediate problem, 
and I promised to have the story in the next day's mail. 

I replaced the Apple's lid and flexed my fingers, trying hard to think 
of something exciting to write about aggregates. After a bit of thought I 
entered an opening sentence, then ran a test print out of curiosity. The 
hash was there and worse than ever: 

"One tends to4R ove%rlook the na92tural wonders ))dH;4 of 
aggr7?egates und#er our very ffffeet." 

I walked away from the computer in absolute disgust. There was no 
way I could send copy like that to an important magazine! I went into 
the kitchen and turned on the coffeemako-, but it went "pffft!" and let out 
a cloud of blue smoke. At the same time, my cassette recorder began 
playing a tape backward. The phone rang and it was the editor of Sand

You haveni lived until youve died in space. 

And here's your chance. 
Software author Peter Fokos has created 
Alien Ambush, a space age nightmare. It's a hi-res, 
full-color arcade game, fiendishly written to give 
those nasty aliens every advantage. 

So if you have access to a 48K Apple* with 
DOS 3.3 or a 16K Atari 400/800** with a disk 
drive, and you're hot for some new thrills. Alien 
Ambush was written for you. But be warned: it just 
got a lot tougher to survive in space.

Softalk Presents Hie Bestsellers 



Cash registers hummed merrily in computer stores all over America 
in November as Apple computer owners geared up for what looked to be 
a giant Christmas season. In so doing, they reasserted the place of enter- 
tainment software in the Apple universe and helped Choplifter make 
history. 

The emphasis on Christmas buying was indicated by the resurgence 
of games in the Top Thirty. Where only six arcade games made that list 
in October, ten earned mention in November. Chief beneficiaries of the 
holiday buying spirit were Snack Attack, whidi rose from twenty-ninth to 
ninth, and Castle Wolfenstein, which had dropped out of the Top Thirty 
but made it all the way back to eleventh. 

The biggest shocker of all, however, was Choplifter. After several 
months as the number one program, Choplifter as deposed by all-time 
champ VisiCalc in October. Judging by historical sales patterns, that 
seemed to indicate the beginning of the end for Dan GorUn's piece de re- 
sistance. No game had ever dropped out of first place and regained it. 

But that's exactly what Choplifter did, narrowly edging out Visi- 
Calc for the top spot. There was no weakness in VisiCalc's sales. It was

the reemphasis on entertainment that changed the market. 

Frogger jumped from sixteenth to fifth. Canyon Climber, Aztec, and 
The Mask of the Sun came from nowhere to fourteenth, fifteenth, and six- 
teenth, respectively. Zork III debuted on the charts in twentieth. Serpen- 
tine regained a spot on the Top Thirty in twenty-first. Tubeway snuck in- 
to thirtieth in its first month of release. 

Preliminary indications were that December would see more of the 
same. Lunar Leeper and Repton started out strong among the arcade 
freshmen and Ultima II, at last being sold, was white hot among fantasy 
games. Transylvania and Sherwood Forest were showing strength among 
the adventures. And previewers were raving about Bill Budge's Pintail 
Construction Set and Micro Fun's Miner 2049er. 

The large number of titles in wide distribution seems to indicate that 
a good time will be had by all. 

Nearly twice as much software was sold in November as in October, 
and not all of it was entertainment. What might best be called soft edu- 
cation packages are making a big showing. Soft education packages are 
those that sugar-coat the learning process, generally are not curriculum- 
based, and are dependent more on home buyers than on school adop- 
tions for sales. 

This fall has seen the Learning Company and Spinnaker make big 
splashes with soft education product. They're doing real well, but the talk 
of the town was the set of Children's Television Workshop packages dis- 



tributed by Apple. CTW produces Sesame Street and it looks like they've 
found another medium through which to communicate to youngsters. 

In recognition of the changing circumstances in educational soft- 
ware, Softalk has implemented a Home Education 10 category. The cate-

EZ-LEDGER is the ideal record keeping system for somebody run- 
ning a small business out of their home or the self-employed profes- 
sional. EZ-LEDGER uses the simpleist form of bookkeeping 
possible. Single entry bookkeeping requires only posting transac- 
tions either under INCOME or EXPENSE. 

EZ-LEDGER will keep track of expense items under any one of 99 
user selected tax codes plus keeping all year-to-date and monthly 
running totals for each of the selected items. Expense items may be 
entered under DEDUCTIBLE or NON-DEDUCTIBLE type codes. 

EZ-LEDGER is a strictly cash system, i.e. if you pay out monies 
(check, cash, credit cards etc.) then the transaction is posted under 
EXPENSE and if you receive monies then record them under 
INCOME. 

EZ-LEDGER will produce INVOICES with an automatically incre- 
mented invoice number and then automatically post the data to an 
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 'holding' file or directly to INCOME and 
update all totals. 

The accounts receivable and accounts payable files are 'holding' 
files with their own running year to date totals. Transactions in these 
files may be automatically posted to INCOME or EXPENSE and all 
respective totals will be updated automatically. 

EZ-LEDGER will support 80 or 132 column printers and one or two 
disk drives. The printer is needed for producing invoices, but option- 
al on all other reports. 

EZ-LEDGER requires 48K ram. APPLESOFT rom and DOS 3.3.

gory is not all-encompassing. Curriculum-based software is customarily 
not sold through retail outlets, but through specialized educational dis- 
tributors. These sales cannot be tracked and verified and are therefore 
not included. It is well within the realm of reason to believe that more of, 
say. Algebra 3 from Edu-Ware is sold than some of the packages listed. 

The first education packages were nearly all curriculum-based. But 
the lack of curriculum-based software should not reflect poorly on the 
early education publishers. It was their pioneering efforts that parents 
used as a justification to buy a computer in the first place — even if they 
did buy Dogfight instead of Decimals and Space Eggs instead of Spatial 
Relationships. 

It should come as no surprise that MasterType leads the education

category. Biggest eyebrow-raiser is Early Games for Young Children, 
which outsold Apple Logo and almost made the Top Thirty. One of the 
old guard publishers made the list as Step By Step from PDI took 
position. 

Three of Spinnaker's offerings earned spots on the list and two CTW 
packages also made it. The higher price of the Learning Company 
packages apparently prevents them from being as widespread, but 
Rocky s Boots made a strong showing. 

Also new this month is the Arcade 10. After two straight months in 
which less than ten arcade games made the Top Thirty, it was decided to 
implement an arcade list to present more depth. Naturally, ten such 
programs made the Top Thirty this month, so the list has all the value of 
a second appendix. 



The Pizza Program 

Announcing the first dinner menu planning system. 
It will save you time and add new zest to your meals. 
It may even convince your wife buying an Apple* 
was a stroke of genius. 



ENDS HO-HUM DINNERS 

Are you tired of the same old 
thing for dinner? Would you like 
more variety in your evening 
meal? Is there something you'd 
rather have but don't get very 
often? The Pizza Program is 
designed just for you. It's a de- 
lightful new software package 
designed to end the dinner-blahs 
with computer generated menus. 
Here is how it works. 

You review what you like from 
the pre-selected food groups in 
the system. Delete any foods 
you don't enjoy. Add anything 
new at any time. Then decide 
how often you like to eat certain 
items. For example. Don't like 
liver? Then eliminate it with a few 
simple keystrokes. Or, you can 
plan for it as seldom as once every 
99 weeks or as often as daily. 

Want to go out to your favorite 
restaurant? Enter the restaurant's 
name as a "Main Course." Now 
your computer will automatically 
remind you to go out to eat— and 
as often as you select. It will de- 
lete all other items from that meal 
except the name of the restaurant. 

AUTOMATIC SHOPPING LIST 

You get a new menu each week 
or for just a few days if you want. 
And, it generates a detailed shop- 
ping list, automatically. It can 
arrange each item on the list in 
sequence according to the aisles 
at your favorite store Studies 
show a shopping list will discour- 
age impulse buying and save 
you money. 

Also, it generates a per serving 
calorie counter This is easy to 
delete anytime you are not in a 
diet mood or want to celebrate 
for any reason. You never count 
calories unless you want to. 

RANDOMLY DELICIOUS 

Say goodby to boring meals. 
Your computer will remember 
variety is the spice of life. This 
system makes eating at home a 
pleasure again. Each menu is 
randomly generated from major 
food groups according to the 
specific criteria you select. The 
system is easy to learn and easy 
to operate. Yet it is a sophisti- 
cated piece of software which will 
prevent menu mix-ups. 

It will add a new dimension to 
your home meals without increas- 
ing your food costs. It is rumored 
The Pizza Program may actually 
reduce the climbing divorce rate. 
Husbands now have something 
to look forward to for dinner 
Wives think it is terrific because 



it saves time and effort. And, kids 
love anything computerized. This 
is a useful and practical applica- 
tion you'll appreciate day after 
day, week after week. 

TRY IT FOR 30 DAYS 
WITHOUT RISK 

This tested system is guaran- 
teed to make your life easier and 
happier Our home trial lets you 
actually use The Pizza Program 
for a full 30 days before you de- 
cide to keep it. Watch the fun and 
convenience it creates. Enjoy 
better meals and see how much 
time it saves. If you are not satis- 
fied for any reason, return it 
within 1 month for a prompt and 
courteous refund Your invest- 
ment is just $34.50 plus $2.00 for 
shipping and handling. (Califor- 
nia residents add 6'/2% sales tax.) 
Full documentation is included. 

OUT OF THE RUT 

One housewife's reaction to 
this program is typical. She wrote, 
"Before using your system I found 
myself getting into a rut of serv- 
ing the same things over and over 
The Pizza Program has changed 
all of this for me. We now have a 
wider variety of dinners and best 
of all I don't have to decide what 
they will be. If this was all it did, 
I'd be thrilled. But it isn't. The 
shopping list I receive along with 
my menus has been such a time 
saver I quickly run through it 
and delete anything I feel I don't 
need and add something I might. 
I would have a hard time going 
back to doing my menus by hand." 

This system requires an Apple II 
Plus* with 48K and 1 disk drive.

In the Apple III list, Word Juggler made a leap into fourth and 
showed much broader strength than ever before. In addition, Quark's 
Catalyst just missed the cut. That the III is being used in big companies 
to talk to big computers is indicated by the increasing sales of Micro- 
com's Micro Terminal III. 

For the most part, Apple II business programs underwent only 
minor shuffling of order, although many dropped out of the Top Thirty. 
The interesting development was Microplan's appearance in ninth as Mi- 
crosoft flexes its marketing muscle against VisiCorp for the electronic 
spreadsheet business. It's a long way from ninth to first, but the situa- 
tion should be of continued interest.

pears to be an inexorable drive for the preeminent position. After two 
months in third place, the program passed Apple Writer II and edged 
closer to Screen Writer II. That means that the two bestselling word 
processors do not require eighty-column boards. To enlarge upon that 
thought, however, Apple Writer II is continuing as a premium on some 
Apple system sales and there actually were twice as many Apple Writers 
as Screen Writers and Word Handlers combined put into the hands of 
users in November. Which, of course, explains the continuing strength of

— — ^ 













Now there is more from the authors of the best selling book Beneath 
Apple DOS— four comprehensive utility programs on diskette and 
over 100 more pages of valuable information about the Apple ll's 
disk operating system. 

BAG OF TRICKS is useful to beginners and experienced programmers 
alike. It includes many "hand holding" tutorials that assist you in 
repairing damaged diskettes and allow you to change sector ordering, 
reconstruct blown catalogs, etc. etc. etc. At the low price of S39.95, 
BAG OF TRICKS is one of the best software values ever 

The four programs and their functions are: 

1. TRAX dumps and examines a raw track, either 13-sector or 16- 
sector, displays the internal Apple diskette formatting 
information, and flags exceptions to standard formats. 

2. INIT will reformat one or more tracks, attempting to preserve 
the contents of undamaged sectors. It also allows you to change 
sector order This can cut disk access times by 40% or morel 

3. ZAP is a sector editor like no otherl More than 50 commands are 
available to assist you to locate, compare, change, or print the 
data on your diskettes. ZAP is even programmable! Using 
powerful macros, it is possible to transfer and compare DOS, 
CP/M, or PASCAL files. 

4. FIXCAT automates the process of repairing a damaged diskette 
catalog. It operates with or without user intervention, locating 
"lost" files and rebuilding the catalog— from scratch if necessary! 
DOS removal and VTOC repair are also possible.

The G>tnplete 
Graphics System II 

* * by Mark Pelczarski 

Complete Graphics System is written for the non- 
programmer interested in doing a wide variety of graphics 
and design on the Apple computer. Included are options 
for two-dimensional drawing, with lines, circles, ellipses, 
and an automatic 108-color filling routine. Also, you can 
mix text with graphics, with various colors, sizes, and 
spacing, and easily create Apple shape tables. Three- 
dimensional options allow you to draw, edit, and 
manipulate 3-D objects in perspective — without having to 
use coordinates. A 2-disk set of additional text fonts is 
available separately. 



by Mark Pelczarski and David Lubar I f — — 

This is also a non-programmer's package, but oriented 
more toward computer artistry. It's also an ideal 
complement to The Complete Graphics System 11. It has 
a brush module that lets you "paint" using a joystick or 
Apple Graphics Tablet, with the screen as your canvas 
and a choice of 96 "brushes" and 108 blended colors. 
You can also magnify any portion of the screen 2 or 4 
times for detail editing, perform mirror images, exchange 
colors, and move parts of pictures to other areas of the 
screen. Also included is a packing routine that lets you 
store more pictures on each disk. 



Although both Complete Graphics System II and Special Effects are written for non-programmers, they are provided on 
unprotected disks, and instructions are included for using the graphics and machine language routines in your own programs. 



^''^raphics magician 



by David Lubar, Mark Pelczarski, 

and Chris Jochumson 



This one is written with the programmer in mind; for anyone who wants to put professional quality graphics in their own 
software. Fast machine language animation and picture drawing routines are included for use in your own programs, and 
they're extremely easy to use. Using the editors provided, you simply draw your own multicolored shapes, draw their paths, 
and combine up to 32 independent shapes with paths and starting locations. The result is a machine language animation file 
that you just add and control with your own program — it does all the graphics work for you! The adventure-game picture 
editor works the same way: just draw, save, and add the redraw routine to your program. It increases a disk's storage capacity 
from 12 pictures to hundreds. A tutorial manual is included with examples of controlling animated objects with joysticks, 
detecting collisions, and a multitude of other useful hints and examples. For samples of what can be done, see any of our game 
packages, including PIE MAN, Transylvania, and Spy's Demise, as well as those from several other companies using Graphics 
Magician for the graphics in their software. 

All of our graphics products are on unprotected disks for your convenience. 

No fee is required for using our graphics routines in other programs. All our license requires is that it is stated that our 
graphics routines were used. We are also most interested in publishing good, new products, and beyond our graphics software 
we can offer further help to authors publishing through Penguin Software. 

Instead of offering our own superlatives, we recommend that you read what others have said about our graphics products. 
Listed here are some of the reviews we've found, along with a few quotable quotes:

END TAX 
THAU 





We have the perfect way to 
breeze through the most 
dreaded task of the year. 
And you can do it on your 
computer — even if you're a 
complete novice. 

It's called The Tax 
Advantagel" It's fast and 
it's a cinch to use. 

The program takes you 
line-by-line through Form 1040 and the other most 
common tax forms. It asks you for information in plain 
English, and you type in the numbers.That's all there 
is to it. 

The Tax Advantage'"' does complex operations like 
income averaging with a few simple commands. Not 
only that, but as tax laws change, you can easily update 
the tax tables. 

Another terrific feature is that it automatically com- 
putes your taxes with each entry you make. So you 
know exactly how each line affects your overall tax 
picture. 

Pick up The Tax Advan- 
tage™ Simply stated, it's the 
best way to do your taxes. 

But hurry. April's almost 
here. 

The Tax Advantage™ is 
available for the Apple II and 
Atari 400/800. Price $59.95.

Softalk Presents Hie Bestsellers 



bership with their communications software has been so successful that 
they got both second and third. 

Bag of Tricks regained the number one spot in the Hobby 10, but 
mostly that list remains the private preserve of Beagle Bros and Penguin. 
Beagle Bros placed three programs and Penguin had two entries on 
the chart. 

Three new programs made the Strategy 5 chart. Space Vikings scored 
third, Sargon II rejoined the list in fourth, and Spitfire Simulator nailed 
down fifth. Castle Wolfenstein put some distance between it and the 
challengers. 



Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 5.8 percent of all sales of 
Apple and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in December to ascertain their sales for the month 
of November. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was the number of units sold — such other 
criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer store, and personal prefer- 
ence of the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in December represented every geographical area of the continental 
United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index 
number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is 
an arbitrary measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are cor- 
relative only for the month in which they are printed; readers cannot assume that an in- 
dex rating of 50 in one month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in an- 
other month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus or minus 4.32 percent, which translates roughly 
into the theoretical possibility of a change of 4.93 points, plus or minus, in any index 
number. 



Two variations of an exciting new game with detailed 
graphics. Challenge your friends or the computer to see 
who can win the pot or break the bank. 



Wizardry and Knight of Diamonds remained atop the Fantasy 5, but 
Ultima II looks to challenge there in December. AH Baba and the Forty 
Thieves and Apventure to Atlantis regained the list and tied for third. 

And then there's Infocom. Last month they got five of the first six 
spots in the Adventure 5, losing only fifth place to Escape from Rungi- 
stan. This month they also took five of the first six spots, but The Mask 
of the Sun took number one, primarily because of Ultrasoft's introduc- 
tion of new technology in screen swapping that has adventure fans agog. 

The Zork family will get another chance in December, as entertain- 
ment buying reaches its peak. If you don't believe second chances, just 
check Choplifter. 2M

Take your marble to 
the top. Pick your spot 
and let it drop. Hope 
for a flip instead of a 
flop. Once you get it, 
the fun never stops! 
It's FLIP OUT — a 
crazy new strategy 
game for one or two 
players. Each marble 
you drop causes a 
chain reaction, so take 
your time and plan 
carefully. Plan right 
and you'll flip, if you 
didn't you Flip Out! 



It is up 
to you to stop the 
invasion of the evil 
Quarriors and save 
Repton. You are armed 
with devastating 
Nuke Bombs, a Radar 
Screen, a Laser Gun 
and an Energy Shield. 
You'll need them all! 
You'll be attacked by 
Nova Cruisers and 
Single Saucers. You 
must avoid Spye 
Satellites and deadly 
Dyne-Beam Shooters 
and you must stop the 
Draynes from deplet- 
ing the Reptonian 
power supply. Repton 
is a battle so thrilling 
you'll be relieved to 
find out you're still on 
earth when it's over! 




Turn your keyboard 
into a typing arcade! 
You can blast attack- 
ing letters and words 
right out of the sky. 
Type Attack was 
designed by a profes- 
sional educator and 
the fast action game 
experts at Sirius. It 
features 39 pre- 
programmed lessons 
and 60 user defined 
lessons. Great sound, 
graphics and a real- 
time words per minute 
bar make improving 
your typing skills fun! 



Talk about adventure 
on the high seas! 
You're blasting away 
at a squadron of 
enemy bombers and 
Kamikaze fighters from 
the deck of your P.T. 
boat. Suddenly you 
notice the sea is 
loaded with mines and 
an Exocet missile is 
screaming toward you 
on the horizon. Instinc- 
tively you jerk the joy- 
stick to the starboard, 
keeping your thumb on 
the fire button. Phew! 
That was close! Some- 
times it's hard to 
believe Wavy Navy's 
just a video game.
