DECEMBER 1981 



Contest: Oracle *82 



Oracle '81 won't draw to a close until 
1981 is sealed and deposited in memory 
archives with the usual rounds of cham- 
pagne, kisses, and homblowing. When it 
does, one Softalk reader will be one Ap- 
ple Disk II richer. 

But, even before Oracle '81 is put 
away, Oracle '82 is bom, with an oppor- 
tunity for another Softalk reader to win 
another Apple disk drive — next year. 

It's still no fun to wait a full year to see 
if you've won a contest, so, once again, 
the top score on each part of the Oracle 
will win the prize of the winner's choice 
from the products of any December 1981 
Softalk advertiser, up to $100 in value, as 
soon as that part's answer becomes 
known. You're eligible for other prizes 
even after you win one. 

To enter the Oracle, you must be- 
come an oracle and predict the out- 
comes of several events or the status on a 
specific date of some fluctuating state of 
being. Points will be awarded in each

part of the contest according to how close 
you are to a correct prediction. Accumu- 
lated points will determine the winner of 
the disk drive. 

Send your predictions on the form or a 
facsimile of it to Softalk Oracle '82, 11021 
Magnolia Boulevard, North Hollywood, 
CA 91601. Entries must be postmarked on 
or before December 31, 1981. Because of 
the nature of the contest, this deadline is 
not flexible. 

Now, here's the contest: 
The Oracle '82 
Predict : 

1. Nielsen television rating achieved 
by the 1982 Super Bowl. 

2. The number of days on which snow 
will fall on Manhattan Island after 
Groundhog Day and before the first day 
of spring, 1982. (Authority will be the 
New York CSty Bureau of Weather and 
Statistics.) 

3. The date of the first no-hitter in the 
1982 Major League baseball season. (A 
possible answer is that there won't be a 
no-hitter this season.) For a five point 
bonus, name the team that will be the vic- 
tim of the no-hitting pitcher. 

4. The closing price of gold on the 
New York market the day after Labor 
Day 1982. 

5. The breakdown by party of the 
United States Congress after the 1982 
election. 

6. The three publishers, in order, who 
will have made the most appearances on 
the Softalk Top Thirty. (Appearances on 
specialized Top Ten or Top Five lists 
don't count. An appearance is that of one 
package on the list, so a company with 
three bestsellers might make three ap- 
pearances in one month.)

see if that austere city's city hall might 
be one of those buildings. 

Numerous readers looked at the Man- 
hattan photo, however, and saw New 
York's city hall there. In fact, so many 
entries came bearing this discovery that 
we were convinced and began planning 
to award prizes to the first of these many 
souls. 

But, ashamed as we were at our over- 
sight in not thinking to check out all pho- 
tos and not wanting a similar occurrence 
again, we took care to check on this one. 
According to New York's Finest, the po- 
lice department that walks the beat in 
Wall Street and throughout Manhattan, 
the Bronx, and Staten Island, too. City 
Hall was last seen on Chamber Street, 
considerably north of the onetime north- 
em wall of the city. None of these gentle- 
men surmised it had moved, and all 
agreed that the best rubbernecker 
couldn't catch a glimpse of the esteemed 
hall from the Stock Exchange or its envi- 
rons. 

Unfortunately, the ghost of Gotham's 
city hall probably kept many from look- 
ing further. Consequently, only one per- 
son found and identified the city hall we 
were looking for. We'll let him give you 
the real answer and some extra informa- 
tion as well. 

Lou Meiss, of Granada Hills, Califor- 
nia, wrote, "The hidden city hall is the 
Los Angeles City Hall. It appears on page 
43 and it is reflected in the glass over the 
entry door above the Apple III. The glass, 
by the way, belongs to the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power build- 
ing." Meiss's was also the first entry 
from the Pacific time zone to identify any 
city hall. 

Meiss will receive the prizes he 
chooses from Rainbow Computing in 
Northridge, California. 

Contest Contest. An ulterior motive 
revealed: after many months of making 
contests, the Softalk staff wanted the fun 
of solving some. Well, that wasn't really 
the motive, but it was a delightful side ef- 
fect of the Contest Contest. Thanks to 
everyone who entered for many hours of 
enjoyable contesting. 

In a very tight race, the winner of 
Contest Contest is Philip Suh, of San 
Francisco, California. Suh's contest, 
called Apple Jumble, will appear in the 
January issue of Softalk. Runners-up are 
Alan J. Nayer (San Ftancisco, CA), Eliz- 
abeth Riggle (Louisville, KY), and Jeff 
Lander (Yorba Linda, CA). Their con- 



test will run in future issues of Softalk. 

Suh appropriately chose games as his 
prizes: Gorgon, Apple Panic, and Raster 
Blaster. He'll collect them at AIDS San 
Francisco. 

The Oracle 1981. One contest remains 
in the Oracle from last December; and 
when it's decided, so will be the race for 
the Apple Disk II. Meanwhile, we won- 
dered for a time whether there would be 
an answer to the second to last part that 
dealt with the World Series. 

Happily, if strangely, the baseball 
world came through, but they couldn't 
manage to be very original about it. Af- 
ter all, if you were to pick entrants in the 
World Series purely by odds based on 
past experience, you'd have been a win- 
ner. Once again, the old battle between 
Yankee and Dodger was bit. But this 
time, as only two other times in the 
eleven confrontations of the two, the Dod- 
gers walked away with the spoils. 

Although around ninety percent of the 
entries chose either the Yankees or the 
Dodgers to be in the series and nearly 
half of those chose both, only six entries 
selected the Dodgers to win in a Yan- 
kees-Dodgers showdown. Among these, 
our random number generator chose 
Paul Shanberg, of Moraga, California, as 
the winner. Shanberg will receive Strate- 
gic Simulation's Computer Quarterback 
from Computerland/Walnut Creek as his 
prize. Despite his win and a plus status he 
shares with only seven other entries, 
Shanberg is out of the running for the 
grand prize in the Oracle. 

Jim Ganz, of West Hartford, Con- 
necticut, holds a commanding lead in the 
race for the disk drive with -1-22 points. 
Because the final contest to be judged of- 
fers a set twenty points, only those 
entries presently scoring -1-2 or better 
have a chance to tie or win. Four entries 
stand in that position, and the disk drive 
will be won by either Ganz or one of these 
people, listed with their current scores: 

Gary Kim, of Seattle, Washington, 
and Daniel Tobias, of Poughkeepsie, New 
York, are tied in second place with -1-93/8 
points; Tom O'Brien, Portland, Oregon, 
is close on their heels with -l-ss/s points; 
Charles Lewis, of Richmond, Virginia, 
follows with -f-3V8 points. 

Besides Shanberg, two others de- 
serve honorable mention for remaining 
in the black on the point scale. They are 
Michael Preston, of Culver City, Califor- 
nia, and Gary Kim, who is currently tied 
for second with a different entry.

Romance in the Future: 
A Form-Letter Affair 



BV AhllE WAvriAn 

Everyone from Alvin Toffler to the local news commenta- 
•tor has made wise pronouncements about what the computer 
age will bring us. Visions of interactive television bringing us a 
modem-day town forum that will let us truly speak with our 
government dance in the air. 

We'll live in a cashless society that will let us avoid the has- 
sle of balancing our checkbooks and give us believable rec- 
ords for the IRS. No longer will we have to spend hours and 
money driving to work. We will be able to do our jobs in the pri- 
vacy and comfort of our own homes using our very own micro- 
processors. 

No Hassles — Or Are There? The same keyboard, with the 
proper software, will allow our children to run up their home- 
work quickly and provide stimulating tutoring guaranteed to 
take them away from the dangers of television. Our world will 
become like Marshall McLuhan's global village, and all our 
problems will be solved. 

Well, maybe. But it seems to me there are some problems 
developing that we haven't even thought of. For example, I 
bought my Apple II Plus to process my golden syllables and 
better please editors with the look of my work. And this job it 
did delightfully from the word go. 

But it wasn't long before my growing affinity for the con- 
traption showed signs of becoming a problem. I used to get up 
at 6:30 in the morning to run — a good, healthy practice. Now 
I'm drawn irresistibly to my computer screen instead of to the 
streets and trails; I never make it out the door. 

My evenings are no longer spent with the current Mr. Won- 
derful — or looking for Mr. Not-So-Wonderful's replacement. 
My computer is much more appealing. Concerned friends call 
to urge that I get out of the house, join them at a symphony or 
ball game ; but, when I finally gave in once, I spent the time si- 
lently planning my next Basic session. 

And it gets worse. I'm annoyed by my toaster because it 
doesn't have a command that allows me to delete the piece of 
bread I've just inserted. I'm frustrated in conversation be- 
cause I can't, with a keystroke or two, move the sentence I just 
uttered to another part of the conversation. 

There's a saving grace. With a computer, problems lead 
only to solutions, and the constant discovery of new capabil- 
ities in the miracle machine makes the problems bearable 
anyway. My Apple has many more talents than I knew of when 
I bought it— and that's a nice surprise after buying a car that's 
twice as expensive and getting only half the mileage to the gal- 
lon its makers "estimated." 

Relationship Management Software. Just the other day, I 
purchased a new program that may just change my life com- 
pletely. With this program, I can keep in touch with all my Mr. 
Wonderfuls in great style and little time and never leave my 
Apple! On top of that, I can keep my parents happy and deal 
with angry creditors to boot. 

You see, the program I just bought allows me to print out in 
quantity letters I've written and edited. And, if I care to create 
a file full of names and addresses, this miracle program will 
address each copy of the letter to a different person. I can even 
custom write individual sentences within the letter so that cer- 
tain parts of it change. 

In short, I can do what those darned mailing houses do: 
cause your name to appear within the text of a form letter in 
hopes that you'll think I wrote it just for you. 

Now, you're no dummy and neither am I; we recognize the 



distinctive dot matrix style of the computer printout that de- 
clares: "There's $5,000,000 put aside especially for you, 
VLADIMIR SCHMUCK, in the Bank of SHEBOYGAN, if only 
one of the 5,000 numbers enclosed and reserved in your name is 
the lucky winner. . . ."; or: "The future can be beautiful, no 
matter what it holds, and it's never too early to plan for it. Just 
imagine your name, WALTER WASTRELL, carved on one of 
our magnificent simulated marble headstones, guaranteed to 
last you the rest of your life!" But these are on the way out. 

With coming price reductions, we'll all be able to purchase 
a printer whose output looks at least as good as any office tjT>e- 
writer. Since etiquette now allows typed correspondence, 
what's to stop us from using undetectable form letters ruth- 
lessly? 

And, when the time comes, we're all in for another cultural 
shock: the form-and-merge love letter. Convenient for sure, 
but what's going to happen to romance? 

What will my — or your — biographers do in the future when 
they discover that fifty-eight of your lovers received almost 
identical letters just before you left for Paris? What happens if 
two of those paramours get together, brag about their everlov- 
in', and each produces the wonderful letter he just got from 
what's-your-name? Trouble. That starts with T and that 
rhymes with G and that stands for Getoutoftowninahurry! 

The Return of the Furtive Look. Pretty soon, the very arri- 
val of the mail will be enough to raise the hackles of suspicion 
in all of us. A letter from your mother praising your most re- 
cent achievement — too generally perhaps? An adoring treatise 
from Lover #12 — has he found someone else? How will we 
know what and who to believe? 

I predict, first, the return of the typographical error. I see 
people examining letters closely for strikeovers and misspell- 
ings. In fact, in a warm, personal letter, I've already ordered 
several of my favorite programmers to start work on a pro- 
gram that will check my creative spelling and bring it into line 
with the norm. 

For a while the status of correspondence will depend not on 
its perfection but on the number and sincerity of its errors. 
Thumb prints and grease spots will be prized. 

Soon, however, everyone will catch on to the idea that all 
these things can be programmed. Every error can be dupli- 
cated by the computer; and the computer judges not. It sim- 
ply does trustingly what it's told to do. With voice synthesizers 
and networks already on the market, you won't even be able to 
count on a phone call. 

The next solution will be, of course, handwriting. Despite 
the discomfort of using unfamiliar muscles, for a short time 
the sale of pens will multiply exponentially and a smart few 
will make a fortune on special, noncomputer stationery. 

Ferson-to-Person. It won't last. I have it from a reliable 
source that the Nepalese plan to release, sometime next week, 
additional memory, cameras, and such that will let our com- 
puters look at and duplicate anyone's handwriting. 

Ye gods, we'll be forced back to communicating with each 
other in person! 

And what about the love letters that started it all? What 
about the besmirched idea of romance? 

Love letters will bite the dust altogether. When you kiss a 
lover good-bye at the spaceport, you can kiss the romance 
good-bye as well, because no romance will be expected to sur- 
vive even the distance of a phone call. Lovers will stick close 
together, and, for those who can manage that, romance will be 
better than ever. 31

You Could Be a Lord British . . . 

Roger Wagner, help! 

In your next installment of Assembly 
Lines, could you give us poor readers 
some hint on how to use hi-res graphics in 
assembly language? 

I have not been able to find this infor- 
mation anywhere. What is Apple trying 
to hide from us? Is this a trade secret? 
Do we have to be a Nasir or Bill Budge to 
know the routines? Please reply soonest.

Talk to the Animals 

Thank you for your article on dolphins. 
My feelings of deep respect and admira- 
tion for Dr. John Lilly notwithstanding, I 
feel the approach used in dolphin re- 
search today to an understanding of the 
cetacean "language" may be inappro- 
priate. I feel it is mistaken to search for 
words, syntax, or symbols in whale lan- 
guage, because I don't think they exist. 
Here's why: 

A few years ago, in listening to "Songs 
of the Humpback Whale," a phonograph 
record which had attained some degree 
of popularity, I was disturbed by the dis- 
crepancy I heard between the record 
jacket's claim that the sounds were re- 
corded in open ocean and the obvious re- 
verberation that lent a pronounced tank- 
like, enclosed sensation to the sounds. It 
occurred to me that the whales produced 
the sound AND the echo. In other words, 
they may have been recreating, as a lit- 
eral echo-picture, an environment to 
which they had been exposed, or more 
importantly, may have been inventing 
their own. 

I think we should prepare ourselves 
for the possibility that the totality of ce- 
tacean communication is the creation of 
sonic reflective images of objects in real 
time and space, that is, sonic holog- 
raphy, which I choose to call holosonics. 

We humans, with oior linear, nonholo- 
graphic communication medium, admit 
that one picture is worth a thousand 
words. (I suspect that's why we invented 
television.) So I don't think it is too diffi- 
cult for us to accept the idea that a spe- 
cies can commxinicate through the use of 
holosonics. 

We might ask ourselves what band- 
width a whale would use to adequately 
describe an object that may be kilome- 
ters long with details measured in centi- 
meters. I suspect it would be the band- 
width the dolphins are known to use. 

To digress momentarily, I should in- 
dicate here that my discussion of band- 
width is based in part on the assumption 
that living systems are more adept at 
performing phase-shift analysis on a re- 
flected wave than they are at timing the 
dxiration between a short pulse and an 
echo. Thus a long "broooonk" would con- 



D I s ( u 

tain more information about a large ob- 
ject than a short "peep" to a whale. You 
may ask then why a bat doesn't produce 
long broooonks, but obviously the bat's 
small sound producing and receiving or- 
gans are incapable of resonating at low 
frequencies with enough energy to be 
useful. In addition, bats are primarily in- 
terested in moths, which are quite small. 

We might also ask how easy it would 
be to teach a dolphin to communicate 
symbolically. About as easy, I submit, as 
it would to teach a human to talk and lis- 
ten holosonically. 

Computers are being used extensive- 
ly today to crack the dolphin code, by 
seeking for correlations between be- 
havior and speech patterns, and by try- 
ing to look for repetitive sequences that 
may be interpreted syntactically. But if, 
as I suspect, there is no syntax, it would 
be better to use the computers to find 
purely sonic relationships that can be 
mapped into spatial configurations as 
three-dimensional images. (Which may 
be difficult, as these images also un- 
doubtedly contain motion as well.) 

I think it will take a fast computer, 
and some very exceptional program- 
ming, to make the cetacean images per- 
ceptible to us. Your plea for programs of 
interest to dolphins is an interesting chal- 
lenge. Why not a sonic Breakout, for 
starters? The dolphin would have to pro- 
duce pulses which would have to satisfy 
certain parametric criteria to score a hit, 
and be rewarded with complex sound 
patterns. 

Unfortunately, I suspect that even a 
knowledge on our part of the holosonic 
nature of cetacean language will do little 
to offset our wholesale slaughter of these 
beings, but it is a work I feel should be en- 
gaged with all reasonable dispatch.

On Homespun Hardware 

Silas Warner, I have to inform you that 
your article (Softalk, October 1981), "The 
Controller Even You Can Make," is ex- 
cellent! Even though I've only read one 
page at this time, I had to write this let- 
ter before finishing it. That type is what I 
like! 

Keep up the fine articles! 

P.S. Do you have an idea how to 
interface a ham radio to an Apple? 
George E. Norkus, Utica, MI 

I am building a demonstration board for 
our chess club. The pieces will have 
magnets that will operate reed switches 
in the board squares. The big question is, 
how are we going to read these squares? 
Along comes your article in the October 
issue of Softalk, "The Controller Even 
[McGraw] Can Make." The timing is fan- 
tastic.

S S I O H 

I believe that I understand the work- 
ings of the APMOD card and will get one. 
The fact that it will monitor sixty-four 
switches is perfect. 

I am a little concerned about the code 
changes necessary to read the sixty-four 
inputs and I wonder if it would be too 
much trouble to ask you to give me the 
code changes to read sixty-four inputs. 

It is the lines 230 and 360 that would be 
the problem. I think there will be enough 
bugs to work out that if I can save some 
foolish code mistake, it will make things 
a lot faster. 

Softalk certainly has grown. The 
articles are pragmatic and such as yours 
are very useful. I hope you will be able to 
help me and I appreciate your comments.

5.0 volts but usually is 2.4 volts or higher. 
There is a big difference between an out- 
put that is grounded and an output that is 
in the low state. When TTL parts are 
tested by the manufacturers an output 
short circuit current test is usually per- 
formed but the output is grounded for 
only a few hundred microseconds to pre- 
vent damaging the device. It is not a good 
practice to literally ground an output. 

Mr. Warner also discusses the differ- 
ences between the output current that 
flows in the TTL device when high and 
low. It is true that TTL devices do most of 
their work when in the low state. This is 
because of the great difference between 
the current sinking capability (low) and 
current sourcing capability (high). Cur- 
rent flows into an output pin when it is 
low and out of an output when it is high. 
Three-state parts are different but not 
considered here. The 7400 (pronounced 
seventy-four hundred) series TTL logic 
family can sink 16 milliamps (mA) and 
source 800 microamps (uA) in many but 
not all cases. 

Just as there are different "stan- 
dard" config^urations for the Apple com- 
puter, there are different "standard" 
TTL logic families. For instance, a 7410 
TTL device and a 74LS10 (LS stands for 
low power Schottky) perform the same 
logical function but have different operat- 
ing speeds, power consumption, and out- 
put drive capability. The LS part in this 



^ son A I 1^ 

case can sink 8mA and source 400uA 
which is one half of the ratings for the 
7410. There are differences between parts 
in the same family. 

A person who is putting together a cir- 
cuit that uses TTL devices should refer to 
one of the many available TTL data 
books for the specifics.

Hard Disk Headache 
I have had an Apple II Plus and have ac- 
cumulated a number of commercial pro- 
grams. Recently I purchased a 10 meg 
Corvus disk drive with the understand- 
ing that it was completely compatible 
with my existing equipment. This is true, 
but you have to put the Corvus controller 
card in slot 6 and the floppy disk drive 
controller card in slot 4. Now everything 
works fine except a number of my com- 



DECEMBER 1981 



mercial progprams (VisiCalc, Master 
Disk Catalog, Sands of Mars) are slot 6 
dependent. To run these programs, I 
have to take my computer apart and in- 
terchange my controller cards. Is there a 
patch or soft switch available to do this 
without physically doing it? Also, is there 
a way to use bit copy programs to copy 
locked disks to a Corvus? 
Richard Smith, LaHabra, CA 

A True Gentleman 

I recently wrote to you concerning the 
fact that Maromaty and Scotto's Corp. 
would not produce an independently exe- 
cutable Applesoft program on my ma- 
chine. The letter appeared in your Octo- 
ber Open Discussion. Frankly, it ap- 
pears that there is a problem with one of 
my disk drives and that indeed the pro- 
gram will produce an independently 
executable Applesoft program. 
Maromaty and Scotto were kind enough 
to refund my purchase price before I had 
located the error. My apologies to 
Maromaty and Scotto for maligning their 
software.

Trust Is Best Protection 

I'd like to say something as a new Apple 
owner on the subject of protected disks. I 
have no respect for a company that tries 
to sell me a program then charges me for 
a backup. I will do anything to break 
those disks, spend any amount of money 
to do it. On the other hand, to a guy like 
Scott Adams who sells me a program and 
tells me to first make a backup I will do 
everjrthing I can to respect his program 
by not giving copies away and asking my 
fellow Apple owners to do the same. To 
him I send thanks from Apple owners of 
the world. Last but not least, what to do 
about companies that make progn'anis 
that don't work and tell you it's your fault 
or the mail's fault that it doesn't work: so 
far I haven't found out what to do about 
this, nor can I get anyone else to say any- 
thing. A point in case is software from 
Crystal. Every program that has come 
into this area has had the same prob- 
lems. I have returned one disk, Laser 
Wars, three times with the same prob- 
lem; it has done the same thing on at 
least six other Apples yet the company 
says it's not the program. 
P. J. Carroll, Fort Story, VA 

Addressing the Issue of Graphics 

I'm fourteen and I'm making up a rocket 
ship defense type hi-res program for the 
Apple II Plus. I feel the program would 
be better in machine language, but I 
don't know the addresses of the hi-res 
drawing and plotting routines and none of 
my reference books gives them. 

If you know the addresses for plot, 
line, draw, xdraw, color, scale, ROT, or 
any other graphics routines, please let 
me know through Open Discussion.

More Data on Bases 
I would like to thank Peter Olivieri for his 
recent review of DB Master (Mind Your 
Business, Softalk, October 1981). How- 
ever, there were a couple of points in the 
article which may have been mislead- 
ing, and I would like to clarify them. 

First of all, Mr. Olivieri mentioned 
only three of DB Master's eleven field 
types. Numeric fields include small 
integers (0-255), which require only one 
byte of storage, large integers {+/- 
32767) which use two bytes each, real 
(floating point) numbers, stored in five 
b3d;es, and computed fields, also five 
bjdes. (Storing numbers in binary form, 
rather than as ASCII characters, saves 
quite a bit of disk space.) 

There are also special field types for 
dollar amounts, telephone and social se- 
curity numbers, "yes/no" input, dates, 
and a special "auto date" field that con- 
tains the date of the most recent edit for 
each record. 

Secondly, the review stated that the 
report generator allows up to twenty-four 
fields in a report. In fact, a report may 
contain as many as twenty-four 
computed fields. The total number of 
fields on a report may be up to one hun- 
dred, using up to nine lines per record. 

Finally, although I am obviously 
biased in my viewpoint, I think it would 
be helpful for a review of data manage- 
ment systems to discuss the file capac- 
ities of each system (although I realize 
that testing those capacities can be a 
huge job). DB Master is, I believe, the 
only user-oriented file management sys- 
tem available for the Apple II that was 
designed from the start to handle ef- 
ficiently large files with many diskettes 
of data. (Some of our users have files 
with fifteen to twenty diskettes of data — 
more than two megabytes in a miniflop- 
py file ! ) 

In addition, the combination of our da- 
ta compaction, the lack of field delim- 
iters (quotes and/or carriage returns 
stored in the file) , and our operating sys- 
tem, which does not require track/sector 
lists on the disk, means that DB Master 
can store considerably more data on 
each diskette than most, if not all, of its 
competitors. For example, in a tyjncal 
mailing list-plus-comments application, 
we can store 1500-1800 records per 
diskette! And of course, when the disk is 
full, the file can expand onto one or more 
additional diskettes. 

Since each file does require at least 
two diskettes, and since you cannot have 
more than one file on a disk, DB Master 
is obviously not oriented toward the user 
with a lot of very small files. But, for 
those with large file requirements, DB 
Master can be the solution to many data 
management problems. 

Thanks for the opportunity to be blat- 
antly commercial. Keep up the good 
work. 

Barney Stone, Co-author, DB Master, 
San Rafael, CA 



Peter Olivieri's article appearing in the 
October issue of Softalk about data bases 
contained a box score of the various data 
base management systems. 

In describing Data Factory, it men- 
tioned that one of the weaknesses of the 
data base was the field names are lim- 
ited to five characters. This is not cor- 
rect. The field name in the data base may 
be up to 239 characters in length. (The 
name of the field may not be any longer 
than the field itself.) None of the other da- 
ta bases in this article have a capacity 
this large. With the Data Factory, in fact, 
you may have as many as 88 fields and 
each field may have up to 239 charac- 
ters. 

Also not discussed within the frame- 
work of the article was that the Data Fac- 
tory is the only data base that includes 
the ability to add fields, take away fields, 
make fields larger or smaller, and move 
all or part of a data base to another data 
base. This has been a standard feature of 
the Data Factory for over two years. The 
data bases mentioned by Olivieri did not 
have any of these features at the time the 
article was printed. 

One of the prime considerations that a 
user should have when purchasing a da- 
ta base management system is the obso- 
lescence factor. What will happen to their 
data base when the company produces 
the next version of the product? 

Micro Lab has solved this problem 



with its extended warranty. We have 
users who have purchased the 2.0 Data 
Factory and have updated to the 3.0 ver- 
sion, the 4.0 version, and soon will be up- 
dating to the 5.0 version. All this without 
buying the product over again. The data 
has always been compatible from one 
version to the next. As we work to in- 
clude new features and capabilities to the 
product, we feel that the user should have 
a method of benefiting from the en- 
hancements added. 

Customer support is also a criterion 
by which you should judge the data base 
system that you purchase. We, at Micro 
Lab, have personnel assigned to aiding 
users when a problem arises. If a user 
has difficulties in using one of .the five dif- 
ferent methods available to generate re- 
ports, he can call Micro Lab. If a user 
has difficulty with the four different 
methods available to enter data, he 
may call Micro Lab. Although the ease of 
use of the product usually eliminates the 
need for someone to call us, it's a nice, se- 
cure feeling for a user to know that we 
are there in case they need us. 

Peter Olivieri has done an excellent 
job in reviewing all the data base man- 
agement systems. He is a fine addition to 
your magazine. We eagerly look forward 
to more columns by Peter.

Tools of the Craft, Part 5 

The CASE of the Several Alternatives. 

As shown in a recent installment, the IF- 
THEN-ELSE facility permits a program 
to make one- and two-way decisions. 
That is, it can choose to perform one ac- 
tion or not (IF-THEN) , or to perform one 
action or another (IF-THEN-ELSE). 
Frequently, however, programs must 
choose to execute one from among many 
different mutually exclusive actions. 
Nested IF statements are often used to 
make the decisions in multiple-choice 
situations, as in the following example: 



PROGRAM 
Entreesi; 

(* Version 1.0, 01 -October- 1981, by Jim Merritt *) 

(* Uses a "ladder" of nested IF-THEN-ELSE statements in 

displaying the daily dinner entree at my favorite 

restaurant. 

*) 

TYPE 
Days = 

(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, 
Friday, Saturday, Sunday); 

VAR 
D 

:Days; 
BEGIN (* Entreesi *) 
D := Tuesday; 
WriteLn; 

Write("Entree for today, '); 

(* NOTE: Subsequent output occurs on same output line. *) 
IF (D = Monday) 
THEN 

WriteLn('Monday, is Southern Fried Chicken') 
ELSE 

IF (D = Tuesday) 
THEN 

WriteLn("Tuesday, is Hot Tamale Pie') 
ELSE 

IF (D = Wednesday) 
THEN 

WriteLn('Wednesday, is Hearty Beef Stew') 
ELSE 

IF (D = Thursday) 
THEN 

WriteLn('Thursday, is Roast Tom Turkey') 
ELSE 

IF (D = Friday) 
THEN 

WriteLn('Friday, is Grilled Red Snapper') 
ELSE 

IF (D = Saturday) 
THEN 

WriteLn('Saturday, is Ham Steak w/Pineapple') 
ELSE 

IF (D = Sunday) 
THEN 

WriteLn('Sunday, is Steak & Lobster Tail'); 

END (* Entreesi *) 



This program chooses the correct 
string literal to display from among sev- 
m different ones, using the current value 
)f D as its basis for decision. You can 
jompile the program, execute it, then re- 
jompile it, assigning different initial 
/alues to the variable D, to convince 
yourself that the correct entree is dis- 
played for any given value of D. Note that 



the original seven-way decision must be 
restructured into a succession of two-way 
decisions in order to be compatible with 
the IF-THEN-ELSE mechanism. 

Another, often superior, way to ex- 
press many multiple-choice decisions is 
to use Pascal's CASE statement. The 
syntax for CASE is given in figure 1. Here 
is a progn:"am that performs the same

function as Entreesl, but uses a CASE 
statement, instead of a ladder of nested 
IFs: 

PROGRAM 
Entrees2; 

(♦Version 1.0, 01 -October- 1981, by Jim Merritt *) 
(* Uses a CASE statement in displaying the daily dinner 

entree at my favorite restaurant. Contrast with 

program Entreesl. 

*) 

TYPE 
Days= 

(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, 
Friday, Saturday, Sunday); 

VAR 
D 

:Days; 
BEGIN (* Entrees2 *) 
D := Tuesday; 
WriteLn;

(* NOTE: Subsequent output occurs on some output 
line. *) 

CASE D OF 
Monday: 

WriteLn('Monday, is Southern Fried Chicken'); 
Tuesday: 

WriteLn('Tuesday, is Hot Tamale Pie'); 
Wednesday: 

WriteLn('Wednesday, is Hearty Beef Stew'); 
Thursday: 

WriteLn('Thursday, is Roast Tom Turkey'); 
Friday: 

WriteLn('Friday, is Grilled Red Snapper'); 
Saturday: 

WriteLn('Saturday, is Ham Steak w/Pineapple'); 
Sunday: 

WriteLn('Sunday, is Steak & Lobster Tail'); 
END (* CASE D *); 
END (* Entrees2 *). 

The expression that lies between the 
keywords CASE and OF is called the 
CASE Selector. Every time a CASE 
statement is executed, its Selector ex- 
pression is evaluated just once, before 
anything else happens. The CASE Body, 
which lies between the kej^words OF and 
END, consists of one or more CASE 



Alternatives. Each Alternative has two 
parts, a list of Selector values for which 
that Alternative is valid (its CASE Label 
List) , followed by a single statement that 
is executed whenever the particular Al- 
ternative is selected. (Remember that a 
single statement may also be a com- 
pound, which itself contains many indi- 
vidual statements.) When a CASE state- 
ment is executed, its Selector value is de- 
termined, and that value is then com- 
pared with the Labels given in the CASE 
Body until a match occurs or the END of 
the CASE statement is reached. If a 
match is found, the corresponding Alter- 
native is selected and its active state- 
ment is executed. 

The Selector expression must repre- 
sent a value from one of the fundamental 
types. Integer, Boolean, or Char, or from 
a programmer-defined enumerated type 
(such as Days, in the examples above), 
or from a subrange of any of these. In 
particular, the Selector may not evaluate 
to a Real number or a String. (We 
haven't yet discussed any expressions of 
type String, but we'll be getting around to 
them within the next few installments. 
Be forwarned that they may not be used 
as CASE Selectors. Of course, if you hap- 
pen to forget, the compiler will always re- 
mind you. . . .) 

For each Alternative, the values 
given in the CASE Label List must be 
constants and not variables (or other 
forms of expressions) . On the other hand, 
a Label List may include not only literal 
values, but also identifiers that have been 
declared and equated to constant values 
in a CONST section. 

When a CASE statement is executed, 
the Selector value may not match any of 
the given CASE Labels. If this happens, 
none of the alternatives is selected and

program execution continues with the 
statement (if any) that follows the CASE 
construct. For example, suppose you 
have declared a Char variable, named C, 
in your program. The following CASE 
statement causes a message to be 
printed on your screen only when the 
value contained by C is a vowel (A, E, I, 
O, or U) , or a digit (0 through 9) . All other 
characters are ignored because no Alter- 
natives exist to handle them. 

CASE C OF 

WriteLn("Vowel'); 
'V, '2', "3', '4', '5', '6', 7', "8', '9': 
WriteLn('Digit'); 
END (* CASE C *); 

Common Mistakes with CASE. Here 
are several erroneous CASE statements. 
Each one illustrates a common error 
made by beginning Pascal program- 
mers. They are presented within a single 
program so that you may find it easier to 
compile them.

causes the compiler to generate error

you receive an error message from the 
compiler, you may press the space bar, 
thus instructing the compiler to continue 
scanning the program for subsequent er- 
rors. Do this for all error messages you 
receive while trying to compile BadCases.

DECEMBER 1981 



You'll get six identical Error 156 mes- 
sages in a row for the first CASE state- 
ment. This message translates to "Mul- 
tidefined case Label," and indicates that 
you have used a certain CASE label more 
than once in the same CASE statement. 
If a particular constant appears in the 
Label Lists of more than one separate Al- 
ternative, this implies that every one of 
those Alternatives should be executed 
whenever the Selector evaluates to that 
constant. However, this cannot be done, 
and the compiler gives you an error mes- 
sage to tell you so. 

The second CASE statement causes 
two error messages. The first one is Er- 
ror 103, which means, "Identifier is not of 
the appropriate class." If you look close- 
ly, you can see that I've inserted a vari- 
able name into the CASE Label List and 
it is on this identifier that the compiler 
chokes. Since the only identifiers that 
may occur in a CASE Label List are 
those that are associated with constant 
values, the variable name is out of 
place — it is clearly of the wrong class. 
It's interesting to note that this particu- 
lar error condition serves to confuse the 
compiler momentarily, and so thor- 
oughly that it mistakenly detects a sec- 
ond error — another Error 156 — immedi- 
ately after the Error 103. 

The compiler reorients itself in time 
to encounter the Selector of the third 
CASE statement, which is of type Char. 



However, one of the Labels in the subse- 
quent CASE Body is of type Hue, and this 
leads to Error 147. In other words, Label 
type [is] incompatible with selecting 
expression. 

The final CASE statement includes a 
Selector that evaluates to a Real num- 
ber. The compiler recognizes this as an il- 
legal situation and issues the message 
Error 144, indicating an illegal type of 
expression. 

CASE Apes IF. You've seen how a se- 
ries of nested IF-THEN-ELSE state- 
ments can be used to simulate the be- 
havior of CASE. Just so, IF-THEN-ELSE 
behavior can be simulated in Apple Pas- 
cal using a CASE Statement: 

CASE BooleanExpression OF 
True: 

ActionA; (* 1 *) 

END; 

CASE BooleanExpression OF 
False: 

ActionB; (* 2 *) 

True: 
ActionA; 

END; 

Example (* 1 *) simulates IF-THEN 
logic. Should the CASE Selector evaluate 
to False, no action will be taken. 
Example (* 2 *) behaves likes an IF- 
THEN-ELSE statement. Whether the 
CASE Selector value is True or False, 
some action will occur. 



Given that either statement can per- 
form the other's function, whatv guide- 
lines can you use in deciding whether to 
use IF or CASE at a certain point in your 
program (besides the general rule that 
one-way or two-way decisions are best 
handled by IF-THEN and IF-THEN- 
ELSE, while CASE is tailor made for 
multiple-choice situations)? That's a 
very good question, and one that is best 
handled on a (pardon the expression) 
CASE by CASE basis. Were I to wax 
poetic on the distinctions between IF and 
CASE now, you could easily forget them 
by the time we get around to designing 
some "real" programs (in a month or 
two — be patient and you will be re- 
warded) . Right now, it's enough that you 
recognize a CASE statement and under- 
stand a little bit about its function. When 
the time comes to make design deci- 
sions, I'll do my best to explain and jus- 
tify mine so that you can acquire a real- 
istic feel for the distinction between IF, 
CASE, and other tools of the trade.

There have only been three issues of Soffdisk and already it has a loyal readership. 

According to Donna K. Woody of Corydon, lA, Softdisk Magazette is the most fun she's hod since she discovered adventure games. 
More entertaining than a truckiood of Elvis Presley imitators, there's a surprise in Soffdisk every month. For instance, Vagabondo Enterprises of 
Schaumburg, IL, was kind enough to let us disseminate Fireorgan for the November issue. 

Subscription cost is $10 for the first issue you order and $5 for each succeeding issue when the prior diskette is returned. 
Softdisk requires Applesoft and DOS 3.3. A printer is desirable.

The year now ending has marked such growth on the part of 
software producers that the industry is barely recognizable. 
Compilers for both Applesoft and Integer Basic hit the mar- 
ket. Personal Software came out with VisiCalc in 3.3 and added 
several packages complementary to VisiCalc. 

Sirius Software and Broderbimd blossomed into major en- 
tertainment suppliers. On- Line Systems, which had been 
heavy in entertainment, branched into business and utility 
software. Bill Budge started his own company and immedi- 
ately reached the top of the bestseller charts with his first of- 
fering. 

The number of other companies, offering both software and 
peripherals, that have been successfully launched in the last 
year augurs well for the Apple industry and the community of 
Apple users. 

Beginning with Bestsellers. Arguably, no company has 
been more active this year in a broader spectrum of software 
publishing to the benefit of Apple owners than Micro Lab, the 
Chicago-based publisher. Micro Lab opened the new year with 
two products. Data Factory by Bill Passauer and Dogfight by 
Bill Basham. It understates the fact to say that these were per- 
fectly respectable products. Both were ensconced in the top fif- 
teen of Softalk 's bestseller list as last year ended. 

With that kind of success as a foundation for a new compa- 
ny, it's no wonder that Rosalie Dixler and Stan Goldberg, the 
codirectors of Micro Lab, have churned out a new spate of 
products this year. The Micro Lab catalog has expanded to 
twenty items, most coming in the last quarter of the year. The 
litany of products includes entries in the business, education- 
al, entertainment, utility, and tax and finance areas, making 
Micro Lab perhaps the broadest based software company 
extant. 

This is a most improbable occurrence, based on the genesis 
of the company and the original desires of the directors. In 
fact, there're no more unlikely pretenders to the claim of soft- 
ware magnates than Dixler and Goldberg. These are two folks 
who were looking to form a tidy little part-time enterprise to 
occupy their spare moments. That's not necessarily an un- 
usual goal, but the end result is — because neither had any par- 
ticular expertise in the microcomputer field that could foretell 
even the remotest probability of success. 

An Unexpected Love Affair and a Reluctant Purchase. 
That's not to say that the pair had not achieved significant suc- 
cesses in prior businesses. Dixler was coming off a success as 
a travel agent and Goldberg was an executive in the garment 
industry. However, neither was primed for entry into the mi- 
crocomputer software publishing industry. Goldberg had to ex- 
plain away his purchase of an Apple to his wife, Susan, by as- 
suring her that he would be able to make the expenditure into 
an investment. Dixler resisted the purchase of an Apple be- 
cause she feared, as has become the case, that her interest in 
the machine would become all-encompassing. 

It was Goldberg's purchase of an Apple that started the ball 
rolling inexorably toward the formation of a company. He was 
functioning as the vice-president of marketing for a Chicago 
clothing concern and traveling on a weekly basis to New York. 



He became so enamored of the computer that he would haul it 
with him on his trips, using the flight time to devour the 
manuals and read all the computer magazines. 

Goldberg's fascination with the computer carried over to 
his home, where his son caught the interest and started show- 
ing the Apple to his friends, one of whom was Dixler's son: He 
urged his mother to buy an Apple, but she was reluctant. 

Abandoned Tour. At the time, Dixler was functioning as a 
truly successful travel agent. Her success had almost pushed 
the owner of the travel agency out of his own office as she re- 
quired more and more space to cater to her clientele. In fact, 
her clientele had grown to the point where she faced a ma- 
jor decision: should she strike out on her own as a full-fledged 
agency, or should she leave the business? The alternative of 
staying in business working under her curent set of conditions 
was not tenable. 

This was not an easy decision for her to make. Dixler is a 
woman who enjoys the excitement of the unknown and loves to 
travel. This lure of the unexplored place manifested itself as 
early as her college days, when she attended college in Mexico 
City and Hawaii as well as at three mainland schools before 
graduating. In addition, she spent one summer, between her 
junior and senior years in college, touring Europe. 

Clearly, Dixler had the early makings of the travel agent 
extraordinaire she became. But given the option of replicating 
her success under her own travel banner or pursuing some 
other line of endeavor, she opted to turn her clients over to her 
former boss and look for other opportunities. 

She was bound to be selective in what form that other op- 
portunity would take. Dixler had noted that most jobs open to 
women had the same failing: the remuneration was not suffi- 
cient for the effort expended. So when she considered new 
career options, she was looking for something that would pro- 
vide the constant challenge of the unknown and fair compen- 
sation. She investigated parapsychology but found that, while 
the stimulus of changing circumstances was certainly pres- 
ent, the compensation was lacking. Then she turned to com- 
puters, which is where Goldberg and his Apple came in. 

Commitment to Profit Presaged Part-Time Partnership. 
Goldberg was feeling frustrated over the lack of quality appli- 
cations software available for the Apple (this was in the pre- 
VisiCalc days) and, spurred on by his wife's periodic query as 
to when this mystical machine was going to transfigure itself 
from an expense into an asset, was giving some thought as to 
how to enter the personal computer industry. 

He and Dixler started comparing notes and found that they 
were both interested in building a business that could be con- 
ducted on a part-time, twenty-hour-a-week or so, basis. The two 
found that they were complementary in their skills — Gold- 
berg's creativity being conceptual and supported by great 
energy and enthusiasm, while Dixler's creativity found some 
outlets in marketing and in ensuring timely implementation of 
the projects under development. 

So it was that they struck a partnership to build a part-time 
software publishing company with its base of operations in the 
Dixler household basement.

It should be noted here that a start in a basement in High- 
land Park, Illinois, is not exactly comparable to starting a 
computer company in a garage in Cupertino. Highland Park is 
definitely one of the high rent districts around Chicago. In fact, 
in Highland Park, rent is what you collect from others, not 
what you pay. In Highland Park, food stamps are U.S. Postal 
Service commemoratives that elevate vegetables to a place 
of honor. In Highland Park, you start with an expectation of 
success, even, as in this case, when that expectation is unwar- 
ranted by a past track record in the endeavor you set out for 
yourself. 

How Best-Laid Plans Went Awry — for the Better. But ex- 
pectations of success do not a success make, as many a would- 
be entrepreneur has discovered to his sorrow. So, even though a 
basement in Highland Park is clearly more luxurious a 
beginning than many companies in the personal computer in- 
dustry had, it was the more common ingredients of hard work 
and long hours that carried the day, although it should be 
remembered that who we have here are two folks who had not 
intended to become too closely acquainted with hard work 
during the course of their twenty-hour-a-week part-time 
enterprise. 

Goldberg had seen a program sold in Chicago stores called 
Data Factory. It seemed to be the best of the applications pro- 
grams then out, but author Bill Passauer had no distribution 
outside the stores in the local area. Goldberg convinced 
Passauer to let the infant Micro Lab distribute the program. 
Passauer incorporated several enhancements suggested by 
the embryonic publishers and the company was on its way, re- 
leasing the revised Data Factory in June 1980. 

Dixler believes that the success of Data Factory in the face 
of the entrenched competition from Personal Software's CCA 
Data Management System stemmed from Micro Lab's em- 
phasis on making all their programs user friendly. Their per- 
ception that most personal computer owners are novices has 
led Micro Lab to stress simplicity in use. 

Even in this first publishing venture. Micro Lab confronted 
decisions of far-ranging magnitude. The original Data Factory 
had been sold unprotected, but the question of how to handle 
copy protection was a burning issue among publishers by this 
time. 

At the suggestion of a friend, Micro Lab adopted the policy 
they've stuck with — providing a backup disk in the original 
package to ensure continuity of program use in case the 
master disk should crash. That policy increased the cost of 
publishing considerably, but freed the partners to make the de- 
cision to lock the program. 

Expansion Underway. Their success with Data Factory at- 
tracted the attention of a young Illinois physician who had just 
finished what was to become the first arcade game for the Ap- 
ple not copied from a coin-operated machine. Bill Basham sub- 
mitted Dogfight to Micro Lab for publishing and that program 
immediately joined Data Factory as a bestseller. 

Two hits in two trips to bat is an unusually high batting 
average even for companies with the most cause for success. 
For two neophyte publishers who were also computer novices, 
it defied the odds. 

In the first nine months of this year, several other prod- 
ucts joined the line. In the entertainment field were Crcrum of 
Arthain, Mad Venture, and Palace in Thunderland. Mini-Fac- 
tory and Invoice Factory joined the business product line. And 
Learning System opened up the educational area. 

But the fruits of a year's labor have been showing up par- 
ticularly in this last quarter of the year. English SAT and U.S. 
Constitution were added to the educational line. Data Man- 
ager III, a hard disk data base for the Apple III, was scheduled 
for December. Merger, a utility to work with Data Factory 
files, VisiFactory, a program that makes Data Factory files 
compatible with VisiCalc, and VisiBlend, a program that al- 
lows the merging of VisiCalc files, joined the business product 
line. 

The tax and finance markets were addressed with Tax 
Manager and Asset Manager. Tax Manager offers the ability 



to use the Apple to figure your income taxes. Asset Manager 
provides a means of keeping track of net worth of an individ- 
ual or business and is particularly timely because of recent 
changes in the law concerning how certain assets should be 
treated for depreciation. With Asset Manager, adjustments 
from the old methods to the new method of depreciation can be 
done quickly and relatively inexpensively. 

Painter Power and three volumes of Language Plus also hit 
the market in the last quarter, marking Micro Lab's entry into 
the utility field. Painter Power is a graphics program. 
Language Plus is a series of amper routines that can be inte- 
grated into Basic programs to enhance their power. Written by 
in-house programmers Curt Rostenbach and Michael Hatlak, 
the programs reflect Goldberg's conviction that the compilers 
have not provided sufficient power for the Basic programmer 
and that amper routines offer a cost efficient and powerful al- 
ternative. 

Spare-Time Dabbling Can Take AU Day. If there is any one 
salient implication of this spate of activity, it's that such a 
catalog cannot be built by two folks working in a part-time 
business. Dixler observes, with at least a trace of regret, that 
she can't remember any week when either of the directors put 
in as few as twenty hours. Rather than being a venture that 
served to while away a few otherwise unproductive hours, it's 
been from the start a consuming task. 

In Dixler's view, that's the nature of the beast. She observes 
that the marketplace is now so competitive that when a publish- 
er presents a new and dramatically more powerful program, 
the lead they gain is only temporary. Soon other publishers will 
be matching and exceeding the capabilities of the original pro- 
gram with their competing products. 

Keeping even or ahead of the market has entailed seven- 
day workweeks and long hours, including many overnights, for 
both directors. The sheer volume of the catalog gives an indi- 
cation of the work that's gone into building the company. But 
that ignores what Dixler and Goldberg believe is one of their 
major strengths — they listen to their users.

Due to the generosity of an Irish professor, Micro Lab has a 
true Christmas gift for all members of the Apple community. 

Diarmuid McCarthy teaches computer science at the Col- 
lege of Marketing and Design, a third level school in Dublin. In 
the course of using the Apple II in his classes, McCarthy de- 
veloped an Applesoft tutorial on disk for use by his students. 

Typical of a spirit that seems to have almost disappeared 
from the Apple community, McCarthy has offered his tutorial 
to all Apple owners with the specific proviso that no publisher 
or disseminator of the disk do so for a profit and that the soft- 
ware be considered in the pubUc domain. 

Stan Goldberg and RosaUe Dixler, codirectors of Micro 
Lab, accepted the burden of handling the logistics for getting 
the program into the hands of American Apple owners. 

According to Goldberg, the program consists of two begin- 
ner lessons on the Apple and its keyboard, zooming in on the 
use of the edit keys. Two introductory chapters and two chap- 
ters introducing Basic follow. The major body of the work con- 
sists of two instruction blocks of twelve lessons each. 

An Applesoft reference section contains sixty-six com- 
mands with explanations as to their use. 

Goldberg was high in his praise for the programming tech- 
niques used in developing the tutorial. According to him, the 
software is strongly error-trapped. 

Apparently the program is a suitable gift for beginner or in- 
termediate programmers, and Micro Lab is providing the disk 
for a $7 charge that includes the cost of the disk, the cost of dup- 
lication, and the cost of postage. Inquiries and orders may be 
directed to them at 2310 Skokie Valley Road, Highland Park, 
IL 60035. The program requires 48K and DOS 3.3. 3M

Users Come First — and First Again. Listening to the users 
results in updates to products already on the market to make 
them more responsive to the uses to which the program is 
being put. The final result of that policy has been two updates 
to Data Factory and one update to Invoice Factory. An im- 
proved version of Dogfight also was published during this 
same period. 

The policy of updating the programs, as well as the policy of 
locking the programs, has caused Goldberg and Dixler to con- 
struct a user-support program that they believe has contrib- 
uted significantly to their success. In addition to providing the 
backup disk with the original package in applications pro- 
grams, they offer an extended warranty that permits users to 
upgrade to improved versions of the product at little expense. 
Micro Lab has always designed their updates in such a fashion 
that files of data developed under previous versions of a pro- 
gram will be compatible with the new version. 

Although Goldberg, a former industrial engineer before he 
turned to marketing, has not been able to fit in the hours of ten- 
nis and recreation that he foresaw resulting from his part-time 
business, he's found sufficient other rewards in Micro Lab. 

For him, the fun has been in the creative process of conceiv- 
ing of an idea, getting other persons excited and involved with 
a new concept, and nurturing that concept through to comple- 
tion. "Where else," Goldberg asks rhetorically, "other than 
when you parent a child, do you have the freedom for that de- 
gree of molding and shaping?" 

Goldberg has definitive ideas about the shape a product 
should take, but that doesn't foreclose accepting input from the 
rest of the Micro Lab staff. Generally, the development proc- 
ess encourages contributions from everyone involved in a proj- 
ect and the end product is the result of the suggestions of many 
contributors. 

But uppermost in Goldberg's considerations is that each of- 
fering has to be credible in its own right. "Our best public rela- 
tions is the catalog of programs that we've published. We can't 
afford to release a turkey." Goldberg believes that Micro 
Lab's success has been a happy combination of fortuitous tim- 
ing and high quality product. 

Dixler concurs in that opinion, but adds that the breadth of 
the product line has been a strongly contributive factor as well. 
In her view, dependence on one product or one line of products 
in an industry changing as rapidly as the microcomputer in- 
dustry would be foolhardy. 

The Elements of Partnership. It's true that an unbiased ob- 
server would not have chosen the combined experiences of 
Dixler and Goldberg as most favorable portents for success as 
software publishers. That same observer would have been 
hard pressed to select them as likely partners in the first place. 

Goldberg was born and raised in Brooklyn. His family was 
what is most often described as one of modest circumstances. 
Dixler's father was the owner of two businesses and she was 
raised in the more affluent areas around Chicago. But the two 
have meshed their skills well despite the diversity of their 
backgrounds. Goldberg handles product research and devel- 
opment, making publishing agreements with authors and clos- 
ing other contracts. Dixler pulls the loose ends together, han- 
dling packaging, developing marketing compaigns, and get- 
ting documentation completed. 

The pair share joint responsibilities for the company's ad- 
vertising campaigns. 

It wasn't until Dogfight was safely into the marketplace 
and had been accepted that the partners added their first em- 
ployee. Like other elements about Micro Lab, conventional 
wisdom was not operative in the search for employees. 

One of the unmistakable features of most software pubUsh- 
ing companies is the youth of the staff. Dixler believes that's 
because young persons more readily accept change and new 
things than do older persons. In her view, change— particular- 
ly change that comes as rapidly as it does in the microcomput- 
er industry— is threatening to most older persons. They have 
more difficulty adjusting to a pace where the technology of 
three months ago may already be out of date. So there's a nat-

ural trend to hire younger persons for whom such rapid rates 
of change are not threatening. 

The Value of Living. But directors Dixler and Goldberg re- 
fused to accept as necessary settling for key employees who 
might lack experience because of their youth. Even in their 
hiring of programmers — a microcomputer skill where twenty- 
five is practically ancient — Micro Lab has sought out and hired 
older, more experienced persons. While there's no danger of 
anyone mistaking the Micro Lab offices for a home for dod- 
dering retirees, there's clearly an emphasis on experience and 
efficiency reflected in the employees on board. 

Martha Erickson is a case in point. Last spring, she was 
hired to handle many of the customer support functions — an- 
swering queries from customers about the use of the various 
company products and solving specific problems that might 
arise. Erickson is not your typical recent college graduate, 
looking for work and receptive to the new world of the micro- 
computer. 

She's a schoolteacher of twenty years' experience who was 
reentering the job market. Toward that end, she'd taken a 
class in accounting but found the work not to her liking. She 
then took a business computer course. While taking the course, 
she applied for work at Micro Lab and was told to come back 
when she had finished. She did and was hired. 

Erickson's teaching experience has been invaluable in han- 
dling customer queries. Most of the questions derive from the 
inability of the customer to understand the proper use of the 
program— a situation which calls for them to be taught the cor- 
rect method. 

Erickson allows that teaching over the telephone is diffi- 
cult, but her background has made it easier to apply appro- 
priate teaching techniques for each caller. The almost infinite 
patience that a seasoned teacher must learn to survive has 
stood her in good stead when callers open conversations with 
hostile attitudes. She most often manages to kid the person into 
a more receptive frame of mind while solving their problem. 

Knowledge Never Hurt Sales. The major areas of her re- 
sponsibility are Data Factory and Invoice Factory. Because of 
the reliability and ease of use of the products, her time is not 
consumed in customer service. Because of her familiarity with 
the advantages of the products, she uses her additional time to 
dial up retailers and push the product. 

Micro Lab has provided an Apple for every employee, but 
Erickson confesses that she hasn't yet had time to learn one 
program other than those for which she's providing support. So 
while Dixler has converted from finding the computer an im- 
position when writing to an indispensable tool for composing, 
Erickson has yet to get the time to test that theory for herself. 

Hired about the same time as Erickson was Deborah 
Mihm, Ukewise a computer novice. Mihm, like Dixler, has a 
fascination with new experiences that has found some fulfill- 
ment in the microcomputer industry. As one of the persons re- 
sponsible for documentation, she's had to work closely with the 
programmers and found this stimulating. She describes the 
programmers' environment as one of humor and intense con- 
centration. If that's not how you've seen it or pictured it, per- 
haps her comment represents a true tribute to the atmosphere 
created at Micro Lab by Goldberg and Dixler. 

Mihm wasn't exactly looking for work in the microcomput- 
er field, but when a friend mentioned that Micro Lab might 
have need of a person with her journalistic talents, it struck 
her right. Her vicarious knowledge of computers, gleaned 
frorh friends who were closely associated with data process- 
ing, prepared her to be quite comfortable with micros. 

No stranger to hard work — she earned her way through col- 
lege—that concept was tested early by her assignment to do 
the documentation for Painter Power. She sat with two com- 
puters, one displaying the program and one to do word proc- 
essing, for several weeks. 

Like Erickson, she represents those programs she's most 
familiar with to the retailers. She's found that contact enjoy- 
able in that the retailers seem to like what they're doing. She's

Exploring Business Basic 
— Part Four 

Those of you who have Apple Ills 
have probably received some very good 
news in the last few weeks. Yes, Vir- 
ginia, there is a new version of Business 
Basic with some fantastic new features ! 
But first, a word from our sponsor. . . . 
Seriously, let's conclude presenting the 
information promised last time before 
getting into the new goodies. 

As you may remember (and are 
otherwise encouraged to discover), the 
last article concluded with some points 
about the use of data files in Business Ba- 
sic and modified our simple database 
program to use the data file format. For 
at least one more time, we'll list the pro- 
gram as it currently stands and then 
plunge into this month's enhancements, 
which cover the breathlessly exciting 
topics of list management, indexing, and 
sorting. That will about finish us in the 
data management area, leaving future 
issues to explore formatting, business 
arithmetic, and matrix arithmetic. 

Once more, dear friends, into the 
breach. . . . 

The Program as It Currently Stands. 
Remember that this program was de- 
signed to allow the entry and retrieval of 
information about parts such as might be 
maintained by a distributor or retail 
store. So far the program allows crea- 
tion of parts files, and adding, deleting, 
and finding records of specific parts by 
part number. The program:

Impressive, right? In plajdng around 
with this program, you may have dis- 
covered something very interesting. Re- 
trieving individual records on parts is 
simple and quick, as long as you remem- 
ber the part number you want. Try com- 
ing back to the program after a few days 
or weeks and attempt to remember the 
part numbers that were previously en- 
tered. It'll immediately be obvious that a 
list of all the active (not deleted) part 
numbers is needed. The program below 
will accomplish this task. 



10 PRINT"Name of Parts file: "; 

20 INPUT a$ 

30 OPEN#l,a$ 

40 PRINT"Name of list file: "; 

50 INPUT a$ 

60 OPEN#2,a$ 

70 ON E0F#1 GOTO 1000 

75 PRINT"Part number","Description", 

"Location","Quantity":PRINT 
80 FOR rec=l TO 9999 
90 READ#l,rec:IF TYP{1) = 5 THEN 200 
100 READ#l;partnum%,desc$,location$,

110 IF partnum%<0 THEN 200 

1 20 PRINT#2;partnum%,desc$,location$, 

quantity 
200 NEXT rec 

1000 PRINT#2:PRINT#2"End of file" 
1010 CLOSE 
1020 END 

Notice that this program has been set up 
to read from any parts file and to output 
to any file as well. This is similar to some 
programs from previous articles and al- 
lows output to go to the screen (by re- 
plying . console) or to a printer, and so on. 
Additionally, since we have no idea 
which part number records are actually 
in the file, a for-next loop is used to scan 
all the valid record numbers. Line 90 
reads the particular record into memory 
and checks to see if it contains valid da- 
ta. Recall that TYP(1)=5 means that 
there is no data in the record. If data is 
present, it is read into the variables and 
the part number is checked. A negative 
value means that the part number has 
been deleted. If the data passes all tests, 
it is printed out. 

Running the program reveals several 
interesting things. Notice the sample 
print-out in figiore 1.

Try entering these part numbers your- 
self and run the sample program. You'll 
notice that the first records print out fair- 
ly quickly, but the last one appears only 
after much whirring of the poor, over- 
worked disk. This is easy to understand, 
since 1,700 records must be searched be- 
fore the final one is found. Just imagine if 
we had used 9000 as the last record in- 
stead! Clearly there must be a better 
way to find out what's in the file than 
searching every record. However, we 
still want the fast lookup of an individual 
record that the random record access 
technique provides. 

Here's where all those comments ear- 
lier in the series about how neat it is to 
have lots of user memory in Business Ba- 
sic become important. With the extra 
memory, we can keep extra data struc- 
tures around to simplify the task of find- 
ing out what data is on the disk and 
where it is. The term data structure is a 
much revered one in computer science 
circles, and simply refers to organized 
ways to maintain data and the informa- 
tion about the data. In this case, we need 
a structure called a list. Sounds obvious, 
right? Lots of things in computer science 
are needlessly obfuscated. (Lots of things 
in English can be, too!) 

In this case, the list will consist of the 
part numbers stored in the file. Since the 
part number is also the record number, 
our task of retrieving the part number in- 
formation is simply one of looking up all 
the record numbers stored in the list. 
One other note. The file can contain 
up to 9,999 parts, so it will be convenient 
to keep track of how many records there 
are in our list. To do that, the following 
kind of list will be used: 

element 1: number of items in the list 
element 2: first item record number 
element 3: second item record number 



element 



(number of items+ l):last item record 
number 



Since all the record numbers are less 
than 10000, we can easily use an integer 
array to store them and the count. Also 
convenient is the fact that all arrays in 
Business Basic begin with element 0, a 
handy place to store the number of items. 
The next thing required is a place to store 
the information permanently so that it 
can be used by the main program and 
others (such as the little list program 
above). This could be done with a sepa- 
rate file on the disk, but it is much safer 
and more convenient to store the infor- 
mation in the main data file itself.

Among other things, it is much easier to 
keep track of where the information is if 
it is all physically together. With that in 
mind, let's pick record 20000 to park the 
list. This is clearly out of the way of our 
regular data, and, because very little ex- 
tra space is taken up, it doesn't hurt any- 
thing. 

So much for the philosophy. The fol- 
lowing additional program lines will ac- 
compUsh the task. First set up the array 
for the list: 

4 DIM f list%( 1 000):maxrecord% = 1 000 

The variable maxrecord% will serve as a 
check not to exceed 1,000 part numbers. 
Since Business Basic permits very large 
arrays, this could just as easily be 9,999 
as long as the dim statement and the 
maxrecord% variable agree. 

Next, we need to retrieve the list when 
the file is initially referenced by the pro- 
gram. To allow us to change this easily, a 
subroutine will be used: 

427 GOSUB 2500 
2500 ON E0F#1 GOTO 2570 
2505 READ# 1,20000 
2510 IF TYP(1)<>2 THEN flist%(0) = 
0:WRITE#1 ;flist%(0):RETURN 
2515 READ#l;flist%(0) 
2520 IF flist%(0) = 0 THEN RETURN 
2530 FOR i=l TO flist%(0) 
2540 READ#l;flist (i) 
2550 NEXT i 
2560 RETURN 

2570 flist (0) = 0:WRITE#l,20000;flist%(0):RETURN 

First an on eof statement is used in con- 
nection with the read statement in line 
2505 to take care of the case where the file 
is newly created. In that circumstance 
record 20000 will be past the end of file 
and statement 2570 will set up the list 
count in flist7c(0) and write that into the 
file. If record 20000 exists, a check is 
made to be sure the data is of the correct 
type (and initiaUzed if not). If every- 
thing is okay, the list count is read in and 
then a for-next loop loads the remaining 
data. Note that this is much more effi- 
cient than reading or writing all 1,000 
values each time. 

Next we need to add the list option to 
our menu of things we can do with exist- 
ing files. Fortunately, the way the pro- 
gram is set up makes that simple to ac- 
compUsh. The following changes add the 
new option: 

452 PRINT" 4 to list the parts in your parts 

file":PRINT 
475 ON a GOSUB 500,700,800,1 100 

The list option requires a new subroutine 
to read the list array and print the list to 
the screen: 

1100 HOME 

1110 PRINT:PRINT"List of current parts for parts 

file: ";file$ 
1120 PRINT 

1130 IF fli5t%(0) = 0 THEN PRINT"No parts on 

file"iGOSUB 995:RETURN 
1 1 35 PRINT"Partnumber", "Description", "Location", 

"Ouantity":PRINT 
1140 FOR i=l TO flist%(0) 
1150 rec = flist%(i) 
1160 GOSUB 1800 



1170 If errorcode = 0 THEN PRINT 

partnum$,desc$,locatibn$, quantity $ 
1180 NEXT i 

1190 PRINT:INPUT"End of list, press RETURN to 

continue: ",a$ 
1200 RETURN 

After checking to see if the list was 
empty, the program prints the heading 
and scans the list array. We can use the 
subroutine at 1800 to retrieve the record 
and set up the variables. That subroutine 
also checks for deleted records and line 
1170 uses the errorcode variable to check 
for that. Note that we could have opened 
a secondary file here to redirect the list to 
another device if desired. 

The next changes just clean up some 
sloppy programming from before. See 
that? There is no such thing as a perfect 
program (or a perfect programmer). 
These changes just recognize the fact 
that our part numbers were supposed to 
be four-digit numbers, yet we allowed 
any part number up to 32767. That was 
fine before we decided to put the part 
number list at record 20000. The changes 
are as follows: 

530 IF a<l OR a>9999 OR INT(a)<>a THEN 
500 

720 IF a<l OR o>9999 THEN 700 
820 IF a<l OR a>9999 OR INT(a)<>a THEN 
800 

The next change is to add to the list 
each time a record is added to the file. 
This involves updating the list count and 
storing the new part number in the next 
available Ust position. Since adds are 
done in the subroutine at line 2000, the 
changes are simple: 

2006 If flist%(0) = maxrecord% THEN 

errorcode = -1:PRINT"Parts file 

full":RETURN 
2025 flist%(0) = flist%(0)+ l:flist% 

(flist%(0)) = rec 

First, line 2006 checks to be sure that the 
list count will not be exceeded by adding 
this record. If everything is okay, line 2025 
updates the list count and uses it as the 
index to store the new part number (rec- 
ord number) . 

The last task is to write out the up- 
dated list as a part of ending the pro- 
gram. This must also be done when 
switching to a new file. The changes are 
as follows: 

470 IF a = 9 or a$ = "" THEN GOSUB 2600: 

RETURN 
1005 GOSUB 2600 

The subroutine at 2600 does Just the re- 
verse of the one at 2500; that is, it writes 
the list back into the file starting at rec- 
ord 20000 : 

2600 IF file$ = "" THEN 

RETURN:ELSE:WRITEii(l,20000;flist%(0) 
2610 IF flist%(0) = 0 THEN RETURN 
2615 FOR i=l TO flist%(0) 
2620 WRITE*(1;flist%(i) 
2625 NEXT i 
2630 RETURN 

Notice that we use the fact that file$ is as- 



signed the name of the file after opening 
to determine if the modify section of the 
program was used. If the string is empty 
(null) , then there is no open file to which 
to write. 

All that seems like a tremendous 
number of program changes, but the re- 
sults are well worth it. You can now find 
out what's in the file at any time, and the 
listing speed is essentially independent of 
the way the data is arranged in the file. 
Furthermore, this permits us to do some 
really interesting things later. 

The type of data structure used here is 
commonly referred to as a "variable 
length list." Here variable is used in the 
sense of changeable. This is an extreme- 
ly useful and widely used structure. One 
example in front of you at the moment is 
the Business Basic string variable. See 
your Basic manual for details of how the 
length of a string is stored. 

Indexing and Sorting. Now that we've 
made all these fun changes, try running 
the program on a new file. Try adding the 
following part numbers in this order: 5, 
35, 200, 100, 50. Now when you use the list 
option, you'll notice that the part num- 
bers appear in the order in which they 
were entered. The previous example of a 
separate list program always listed the 
parts in part number order, since it 
scanned the file sequentially from the be- 
ginning. Ordering of lists according to the 
sequence in which they were entered in- 
to the file is called chronological order. 
Ordering the list in any other way is gen- 
erally referred to as sorted order. 

Clearly, if the array flist% was ar- 
ranged in numeric order, we could use 
the subroutine at 1100 to list the contents 
of the file out in that order. That's be- 
cause the values in flist% are used as in- 
dexes into the larger file itself. It is the 
value assigned to the variable rec in line 
1150 that determines which record is read 
and listed. Unfortunately, sorting the in- 
formation in flist% would destroy the 
chronological order, and that might be a 
useful way to list the data as well. This 
impUes that we should create some addi- 
tional arrays to hold sorted versions of 
the flist% array. These arrays are some- 
times called sorted indexes. In fact, it 
may occur to you that several of these 
sorted indexes could be stored simul- 
taneously in the file. Similar kinds of 
multikey indexing are used in sophisti- 
cated database management systems. 

Wow! That's a lot of definitions of 
esoteric computer topics. In fact, there is 
enough implied in the preceding para- 
graph to be the meat for several articles. 
We'll look at a simple example and then I 
suggest you slide over to your local li- 
brary for a book on database techniques 
for the real details. 

First, let's change the list routine to 
provide some sort options: 

1102 PRINT"Type:" 

1103 PRINT" 1 for chronological order" 

1104 PRINT" 2 for part number order":PRINT 

1105 INPUT"Your selection: ";a$

1107 GOSUB 1300

The changes from 1102 to 1107 set up the 
choice and gosub to 1300 to perform the 
actual sort. Lines 1140 and 1150 change 
the list index to a new array, slist%, 
which has the same structure as flist%. 
This allows changing the order without 
changing the actual contents of flist%. 
This also means a change to line 4: 

4 DIM flist%(1000),slist% 

(1000):maxrecord%= 1000 

Isn't having all that memory nice? 
Next, let's cook up a subroutine which 



will sort the flist% array and create an 
slist% array with the contents in ascend- 
ing order: 

1300 IF flist%(0) = 0 THEN RETURN 
1305 slist%(0) = flist%(0) 
1310 FOR i=l TO flist%(0)

1360 NEXT pass 
1365 RETURN 

Several things are of note here. First, if 
there is anything in the flist% array, it is 
copied to slist%. If chronological order is 
desired, we're finished. If not, the con- 
tents of slist7o, but not the list count, 
slist%(0), must be sorted in order. For 
simplicity, we use a version of the clas- 
sic bubble sort, with a new wrinkle. Busi- 
ness Basic has a new statement named 
swap that comes in very handy in sort- 
ing situations, among others. It will 
exchange the values of any two vari- 
ables of the same type. This includes, as 
this example points out, elements of ar- 
rays. Normally this exchange is handled 
by assigning one variable to a tem- 
porary variable, as in the following 
example : 

1345 IF slist%{position)>slist%(position-l-l) THEN 
temp% = slist%(position): 
slist%(position) = slist%(position-|-): 
slist%(position-l- 1 ) = temp%: 
madeaswap%= 1 

In addition to being ugly, this version per- 
forms significantly slower than the ver- 
sion using swap, since swap is done in- 
ternally by Basic in assembly language. 

Try putting this routine into your pro- 
gram. For small lists it will perform very 
well. For larger lists, there are far better 
sort techniques. Later in this series I will 
try to do an article on different sort tech- 
niques. Most microcomputer references 
on sorting tend to try to minimize mem- 
ory utilization, which usually hurts per- 
formance. Since you lucky Apple III own- 
ers have fewer problems in that area, the 
classic techniques have to be looked at 
differently. 

It might also occur to you that it is 
possible to sort on items other than the 
part number. A good experiment for you 
might be to change the sort subroutine so 
that the slist% array was used to read in 
records to build a string array from the 
values of descriptions. When you sort the 
string array, you could swap the slist% 
elements in correspondence to the way 
you swap the string array elements. 
Then listing from slist% would produce a 
list in description order. This is referred 
to as a pointer sort. 

Another interesting change would be 
to use record 0 of the data file as a place 
to store the record number where flist% 
begins. Right now, that is hardcoded at 
record 20,000, but for a lot of reasons, it 
might need to be changed later. Writing 
it into the file and reading it back at open 
time would make the program much 
more flexible. Also, if you decided later 
to keep multiple indexes for different ele- 
ments, you could store all their ad- 
dresses there (or maybe just the address 
to the addresses ! ) . Another thing hard- 
coded into this program is the record for- 
mat, including not only the number of 
elements, but their names, types, and 
ranges of values allowed. Real database

programs maintain this information in 
the file as well, permitting the user to de- 
fine many different data bases with the 
same program. You might think about 
how our program would be modified to do 
that as well. 

The preceding paragraph contains 
enough challenges to last you as long as 
you want. Just remember that Business 
Basic has the power and capability to al- 
low you to be as sophisticated as you wish 
in managing file data. Good luck! 

The New Goodies. Version 1.1 of Busi- 
ness Basic is now available and it's neat ! 
Obviously, it clears up some nasty little 
problems from the first version, and the 
manual is now a completely revised (and 
two- volume) reference guide that you'll 
really enjoy. But that's only the begin- 
ning. Several new capabilities have been 
added in response to user requests and 
some pretty good thinking on the part of 
the Apple engineering staff. They are 
summarized below, but drop in on your 
local dealer to get the real scoop. The 
postscript is pretty good, too. It's free to 
all current purchasers of Basic, no mat- 
ter how long ago you bought your old ver- 
sion! 

New language additions. There are 
two new reserved words, indent and 
outrec. Indent sets the level of indenta- 
tion for the for-next loops (default is 
three) and outrec sets the record lengfth 
Basic uses to format listings. Ever have 



a long line in a Basic program that got 
overprinted on your eighty-column 
printer? Outrec is initially set to 80 but 
can have any value to 255. Zero causes 
listings to work as in the old version. The 
neat feature is that when the printed out- 
put reaches the outrec value, Basic auto- 
matically inserts a carriage return and 
spaces over to line the next part up with 
the indentation level of the previous line. 
No more screwing up those pretty in- 
dented listings with long lines! This 
works with any output file you specify. 

An enhancement has been made to 
the get statement as well. You are now 
allowed to use get# to get a single char- 
acter from any file. This includes disk 
data files, text files, and character de- 
vices. I can't begin to tell you all the pos- 
sibilities this presents, but it should keep 
you busy for a while. 

New Invokable Modules. The design 
of the Basic invoke mechanism allows 
the language to be extended almost in- 
finitely. Since the invokable routines are 
accessed by name and are available 
from immediate execution mode as well 
as deferred, its really like adding com- 
mands to the language. With all the 
memory available in the Apple III, you 
can keep lots of these routines around, or, 
if you need the space for data, you can in- 
voke just the ones you need at a particu- 
lar time. The new release of Business Ba- 
sic contains some really powerful invok- 



ables. Hang on to .console, here they 
come! 

For the development programmer, 
the most significant module is probably 
Renumber/merge. There's too much 
available in this one to go into detail but 
for those of you who have been frus- 
trated by wanting to add that one extra 
line into a program and having no place 
to put it, take heart. Renumber will re- 
number your program in memory and 
save it on disk automatically or renum- 
ber a program stored on the disk and 
place it in memory for you. In addition, it 
enables the merging of programs on disk 
with programs in memory. This means 
you can save important subroutines and 
have them automatically added to the 
program you are currently working on. 
Because it is an invokable module, it 
won't take up any memory unless you 
want it (obviously there is little need, and 
less desire, to renumber a program while 
it is running). 

The next biggie is the request module. 
Remember all those wonderful things we 
keep saying about SOS? Request allows a 
Basic program to make calls to the oper- 
ating system directly. You can read or 
write up to 64K bytes in one statement to 
any file on the system (including text and 
data files, .console, and so on). Numeric 
arrays can be stored about twenty times 
faster than with regular for-next loops! 
In addition, request allows the Basic pro- 
grammer to get device status directly 
and to use the SOS setcontrol mecha- 
nism. More details on this superpowerful 
module are in the documentation. 

The last goodie is an invokable which 
allows you to doumload character sets di- 
rectly to the RAM-based character gen- 
erator. After setting up the character 
definition in an array, one perform state- 
ment passes it to the operating system as 
the new character set. The Business Ba- 
sic disk contains several sample charac- 
ter sets, and you can have fun inventing 
your own. This also allows you to create 
animation, by properly defining special 
characters, ala the DOS Tool Kit Ani- 
matrix program. I'm sure some clever 
programmers will design a really nice 
program to use this invokable for char- 
acter set design. 

Closing Thoughts. Whew! Glancing 
up at the prompt line of my Applewriter 
III display, I see that I'm up to 26,590 
characters in this article! Your tired 
eyes and my tired fingers both need a 
rest. Next time, we'll have a mixed bag 
of things to enjoy, including some com- 
ments on the powerful formatting capa- 
bilities of Business Basic ; and I'll reveal 
a secret that I hope you all get in on. That 
secret is the answer to the question, 
"How many bytes of memory are avail- 
able for programs in a 256K Apple III?" 
Until then, have a happy holiday season! 

P.S. As you probably noticed in the 
paragraph above, there's more than 
Basic that's changed about the new 
Apple III! »

□ To Brighten the Fame. Next fall, one 
hundred randomly chosen households in 
Ridge wood, New Jersey, will participate 
in a field experiment involving Videotex, 
a home information system. Working to- 
gether, CBS and AT&T will install termi- 
nals in homes of this affluent Jersey 
neighborhood to ascertain the market po- 
tential for home information systems. 

Participants in the experiment will 
have access to large computers via 
phone lines. In addition to having news 
and featureUke programs, the system 
will allow two-way communication be- 
tween people who have Videotex. Com- 
munication with local institutions will be 
a handy feature, allowing participants to 
handle banking transactions without 
leaving the comfort of their home. 

According to Jim Bauer, director of 
business development at CBS, the termi- 
nals, equipped with an alphanumeric 
keyboard, will be from Western Electric 
and "fairly dumb." Participants will not 
be able to store the information they get

out of the system. 

Harry E. Smith, vice-president of 
technology at CBS, wants to find out what 
the consumer demand for such a system 
might be. "The technology involved is 
proven; now we need to test the human 
factor. The public at large may not like 
the technology. Is there a market in the 
general public or will only a certain per- 
centage of people go for this?" Smith be- 
lieves that the same people who would 
buy an Apple computer are potential cus- 
tomers for Videotex, but whether the 
nonscientific computer illiterate will is 
what the study is trying to determine. 

The joint Videotex experiment will 
start in one hundred homes around Octo- 
ber of next year and last for three 
months. After the end of the year, the 
units will be placed in a different one hun- 
dred homes in the area for another three 
months, resulting in two hundred par- 
ticipants altogether. The nature of the 
agreement between CBS and AT&T is 
pretty clear cut. The former has control 
over the content of Videotex and the lat- 
ter handles the software and installation 
of the terminals, along with providing the 
necessary phone lines. 

Both CBS and AT&T are optimistic 
about the potential of the Videotex sys- 
tem, predicting spectacular develop- 
ments if the concept catches on. Smith 
can't enumerate all the system will even- 
tually be able to offer, but he made clear 
that permission will be obtained for the 
use of all copyrighted material. 

Why Ridgewood, New Jersey? Offi- 
cials of both companies wanted the 
experiment close to home base — AT&T's 
technical facilities — as well as to a large 
metropolitan area. Smith further notes 
that Ridgewood is a good community for 
testing Videotex because the population 
is representative of people who might 
want (and can afford) a home infor- 
mation system. The lucky participants 
will be culled from this unsuspecting 
town with the idea of providing a cross 
section of the potential market for 
Videotex. 

□ It's hard to imagine anything easier to 
use than a simple light switch. Our an- 
cestors had to Ught fires, put oil in lamps, 
make candles, and even do without light 
in their dwellings, depending on the 
epoch and place. Now we can eschew the 
knuckle-bending task of flipping the light 
switch on and off every time we enter 
and leave a room. 

Kesser Electronics of Totowa, New 
Jersey, offers an energy-saving device 
that utilizes ultrasonic soundwaves to de- 



termine when someone is in a room. Fill- 
ing a room with high-frequency inaudi- 
ble sound waves, the KESS (kilowatt 
energy saving system) waits for the 
sound field to be broken by a moving per- 
son and then automatically turns on any- 
thing connected to it. According to Mari- 
lyn Misheli, director of sales at Kesser, 
the system is mainly designed for light- 
ing but can effectively control anything 
that is switchable. 

Although not available to home own- 
ers for a few months, the KESS will al- 
low you to hook up your television set, 
stereo, microcomputer, or just about 
anything else that plugs into a wall 
socket. When you entered the front door, 
the lights would go on, the stereo would 
launch into the evening pops concert, and 
the Apple would boot Beer Run. 

Some of the obvious disadvantages of 
this system have been thought of in ad- 
vance. A sensitivity adjustment will keep 
the cat from turning on the lights every 
time it moves from the easy chair to the 
comfortable spot underneath the coffee 
table. You can also work in a room next 
to one that has a KESS and not have to 
shut the door to keep the lights from turn- 
ing on. 

Misheli believes that the KESS will 
become a part of many homes, but it will 
be treated as a luxury item, rather than 
as an essential money-saving device. 
Where it performs the most good is in 
businesses, particularly large ones. "Re- 
cent studies indicate that employees in 
large companies may be absent from 
their work stations fifty percent of the 
workday," explains Misheli. Typewrit- 
ers and computers would be hooked up 
into the system, making absentminded- 
ness a thing of the past. 

MisheU goes on to cite the successful 
case of Mid Atlantic Bank. The initial in- 
vestment for a KESS was not cheap, but 
in six months the system had paid for it- 
self. Looking now at 55 percent savings 
every year on their electric bill, Mid At- 
lantic seems to have made a pretty good 
deal. 

The KESS can also be a nifty deter- 
rent against burglary and other home-re- 
lated crimes. Only a thief with steel 
nerves would stick around if the lights 
suddenly went on and there was nobody 
else in the room. 

In two or three months, when the 
KESS reaches the home market, it will 
cost somewhere between fifty and 
seventy- five dollars. It should help out 
the energy minded consumer and help 
make for a lot of nervous criminals. HI

THE FINEST IN 
FANTASY GAME SOFTWARE 



48 - w/disk 



At Crystal we are doing our best to provide the finest state-of-the-art graphic adventure software in the world. Our list of credits include the first indoor- 
outdoor graphic adventure, the first multi-disk graphic adventure, and now for the Atari, the first graphic adventure in the world which includes screen 
scrolling and animation. The era of the text adventure and games which are simple'combinations of static graphics and text is rapidly drawing to a close. We 
attempt to utilize the full potential of your computer. True, many of our games use up to 48K and we only deal in disk products, but there are a lot of users out 
there who have worked hard to upgrade their systems to the max and we think they deserve games that will give their computer system a run for its money. 




48K - w/disk 



★** ADVENTURE GAMES **★ ^ 

1- THE HOUSE OF USHER- Haunted house type adventure game with scrolling in the Atari version. Wander the creepy hallways of the three story 
castle based on Edgar Allen Poe's short story of the same name. Written in graphics, of course, with animation and sound. We have introduced a new mystery 
for another $100 prize. $29.95/1 disk 

2- FANTASYLAND 2041 A,D.- The largest disk based adventure game in the world (that we know of). Enter the Hall of Heroes and prepare 
yourself for the greatest fantasy-role-playing game you will see for years to come. To win you must survive Congoland, Arabia, King Arthur, Captain Nemo, 
Olympus (a sea voyage), and Dante's Inferno (Hell itself). In both the Atari and Apple versions it takes up more than 400,000 bytes of memory and uses more 
than 400 hires screens. The winner of the contest described in the manual with this game will receive $1000.00 and a bronze trophy. We have pushed the . 
award date forward to February 1982 to allow more people to participate in the contest. $59.95/6 disks 

3- GLAMIS CASTLE- Yes, Pat and I are on our way to Britain to stay in the dreaded Glamis Castle. If we survive our real life adventure, we'll be 
measuring it and will be able to provide you with a 3-D game based on this ancient haunted site where King Duncan met his end at the hands of Macbeth. Our 
good friend, Mark Benioff, after much research, said there's a mystery room that has never been found in this castle and a half beast, half-man creature that 
guards a treasure therein. Our stay will be covered by the British media and we hope to share our experience with you through the writing of this game. 
$49.95/2 disks 

4- BENEATH THE PYRAMIDS- You are an archaeologist in 1932 and must find your way through the perilous chambers beneath the pyramids 
to discover a golden statue of the cat goddess Bast. This game is in hires graphics, includes sound, your little man actually moves through the corridors which 
you can see on the screen. The monsters are animated and very agressive. There is a new $100 prize for the first to solve the mystery; which is a toughie! 
$29.95/1 disk 

**★ SPACE GAMES *** 

5- GALACTIC QUEST-An excellent combination of Star Trek and Space Trader. Battle the animated Vegan fighters as you warp from galaxy to 
galaxy. At the same time, you may land on and trade with hundreds of planets. Super hires graphics and lots of sound. This has been one of our most popular 
games. $29.95/1 disk 

6- SANDS OF MARS- Take an exciting voyage to the planet Mars via the Starship Herman. This game compared to the rest, is second only to 
Fantasyland 2041 A.D. It includes scrolling on the Atari and hundreds of full screen graphics. You can move your little man through the terrain of Mars; if, of 
course, you survive the exciting journey to Mars, which occupies the whole first disk. There is a new mystery and another $ 1 00 prize just waiting for some 
clever adventurer out there. Good luck! $39.95/2 disks 



*** WAR GAMES ★★★ 

7- WORLD WAR III- You Atari gamers will have to see this in the Atari version to believe it! if your tired of war games which take 15 minutes a move 
and have a manual the size of a telephone book; but still want a complex, real-time action war game-this is it! It is designed for two arm-chair generals which 
may manucvcr up to 1 28 seperate type of units at a time. The game displays a map of Iran & Iraq in the first scenario and later on you will find yourself moving 
nuclear submarines and battleships through two world wars. This is not a boring copy of a board based game but an original war game which takes a lot of skill 
and may take weeks to play. $29.95/1 disk 

8- WATERLOO Il-if you had been Napolean would you have done a few things differently? Well as you approach this final battle you are equipped 
with the same forces, face the same opposition, and survey the same terrain which he did. We have done a great deal of research to make this historically 
accurate as well as extremely complex. Even the angle of sight, fatigue of the individual soldier, and his psychological profile are included in the calculations. 
Oh by the way, your opposition is no slouch. You may find it more difficult to change the course of history than you think! $49.95/2 disks

Since Softalk's first Holiday Gift Guide last December, the 
Apple product market seems to have exploded. We saw that as 
even more reason to offer you a guide this year; your fingers 
may have farther to walk this year, but the rest of you can stay 
as comfortable as ever. And the end results, the packages that 
stuff those stockings, will come from a pool of goodies more 
various and unique than ever before. 

Once again, we asked software publishers and hardware 
manufacturers of products for the Apple to send us short de- 
scriptions of products they think Apple owners might like for 
Christmas. Softalk has not tried all these products, and we 
leave it to our readers to determine their applicability and 
worth for gift-giving needs. 

A few generalizations: where memory required is not spec- 
ified, assume you need 48K; where language is not specified, 
assume you need Applesoft; where no operating system is 
specified, assume DOS 3.3 and one disk drive. A requirement 
for ROM Applesoft can be filled by RAM Applesoft laoded into 
a language card. 

Finally, if you cannot obtain a product from your dealer, or 
the place you live is not conveniently served by a dealership, 
check to see if the manufacturer or publisher is a Softalk ad- 
vertiser, in which case you can probably learn how to reach 
them from the ad, or consider trying one of the mail-order ser- 
vices who advertise in Softalk. If all else fails, call Softalk, and 
we'll try to find the lost company for you. 

Good shopping and have a very happy holiday!

tinue sending you So/talk free without trying to put the touch on you for some- 
thing, whether a subscription, software, peripherals, kidney beans, defective 
grommets, or spare Edsel parts. Now comes the magic moment. 

Sofldlk commissioned graphics artist Robert Zraick to do August's cover 
with a poster in mind. The robot contemplating a bite is evocative both of Ro- 
din's The Thinkfr and the Genesis passage on the Garden of Eden . . . not to 
mention the possible significance to our favorite technological fruit. 

The artist and Snflalk are sharing in the profits from the poster. Snftalk will 
distribute its proceeds to individuals developing Apple tools to help the handi- 
capped, Sdfliilk guarantees 100 percent distribution of its monies.

shipping and handlingl. two hundred artist's proofs, signed by Robert Zraick,

numbered and hand-signed and be accompanied by a certificate giving its num- 
ber and guaranteeing that only 200 are being distributed.

Alfersonal Information 
Man^emd 



Your APPLE* computer really can track purchase 
orders and inventory, analyze your investment records, 
maintain client and patient histories, or even catalog 
magazine abstracts and your stereo collection. 
Software Publishing Corporation has the answer 
and it doesn't require programming! 

We call it the PFS software series - an easy 
to use yet powerful set of programs that let you 
design a system that's versatile enough to 
manage almost any kind of information. 

PFS, the personal filing system, let's 
you design your own form on the screen 
for organizing information. Once it's cre- 
ated you just fill in the blanks. Looking 
up what you've filed is just as easy PFS 
can search for a number, a single piece of 
data, a word within a page of text, or 
any combination. All forms that match 
are displayed on the screen for browsing, updating, ex- 
panding, or printing. PFS can even create mailing labels. 

PFS: REPORT, the personal report system, uses 
the files PFS creates to produce a report tailored to your 




requires a 48K, 16- 
APPLEII 



Specifications. Just mark the information you want listed 
and PFS: REPORT will sort it and let you specify head- 
ings, totals, averages, counts, and calculations. You can 
save your report design for use on a regular basis. 

PFS and PFS: REPORT come widi simple 
self teaching manuals plus a support plan that 
includes program updates and factory experts 
ready to answer your questions. And all of this at 
an affordable price. Each program is priced 
below $100.00. 

The PFS software series is different. 
It is not a specialized application pack- 
age nor a complex programmer ori- 
ented data base manager. It's a personal 
information management system that 
lets you store, retrieve, and report in- 
formation your way without program- 
ming. The PFS software series is avail- 
able through your local dealers. If diey don't carry it have

SANTA'S SLEIGH RIDE 



Ho, Ho, Ho and Season's Greetings 
from the Santa's Workshop annex, 
here at Energy Games. 

Santa and his very bright companion, 
Rudolf, invite you to join them in 
delivering Christmas presents. 

You will quickly discover that Santa's 
job is no milk-run! Not only do you 
have to time the air-drop of Christmas 
packages so as to hit the chimney 
openings, which pass beneath you, 
but you must also avoid being hit by 
abandoned NASA satellites, birds and 
the evil Christmas Grinch! 

To help Santa, you will need a 48k 
APPLE II (Plus or Integer) with a 3.3 
disk drive. 

APPLE II is a registered trademark of 
Apple Computer, Inc. 




COLORBLIND 




Runs on an APPLE II or 11+ with DOS 3.3 and 
Game Paddles. APPLE II is a registered trade- 
mark of Apple Computer, Inc. 



Your Hovercraft await you at your homebase 
island. The mission? To seek out and destroy 
yourenemy! How? By getting underway, cruising 
the straits of The Cluster Islands, and, upon 
coming into visual contact with your opponent, 
blast him out of the water! 

This new, exciting game employs a concept 
never before used in the home computer industry. 
The color goggles that come with this game allow 
two players to view one colorscreen and see only 
their own situations, until that critical moment 
when the two antagonists come within line of 
sight of each other. 

Then the chase is on! The aggressor chases his 
fleeing opponent firing all the while, attempting 
to damage or destroy him! 

The craft that runs is not defenseless either. He 
may drop an invisible mine as he makes his 
escape. And, by simply turning a corner, he will 
again disappear from his pursuer's sight. 

When one player has destroyed all three of his 
enemy's hovercraft fleet, he wins the battle!

When ON-LINE SYSTEMS began work on SUPERSCRIBE II, we wanted to make it the 
most powerful word processor on the market. We began by putting in boldfacing, 
underlining, form letter capabilities, global search and replace, support of multiple disk 
drives, full macro capabilities, generation of up to four indices, complete formatting 
capabilities, a software based keyboard buffer, full editing capability of any DOS 3.3 text 
or binary file (including APPLESOFT programs) and all other features you need for professional 
beginning. . . . 

Our next step was to make SUPERSCRIBE II hardware independent, so we eliminated the lower case adapter and the 80 column 
board. SUPERSCRIBE II is the only word processor on the market to offer true software based lower case and a 70 column screen 
available today. 

The move that put us over the top was the introduction of printer spooling* which allows you to do your editing while printing, 
making your word processing time more efficient. 

With SUPERSCRIBE II, we've added all the features you need, did away with all the problems you can do without, and we did it all at 
a price that you can afford-$l29.95. 

•Printer spooling feature only available for printers with APPLE parallel or SSM AlO interface, and EPSON printers/APPLE II and APPLE II Plus arc registered trade

Mind Your 




BY PETER OLIVIERI 




Welcome again! Here we are into December and it's 
mighty cold up here in Boston. May the sun be shining warmly 
on you wherever you are. 

As we close out 1981 and get ready to usher in the new year, 
it seems appropriate to talk about getting financial records 
in order. 

In the last issue, we discussed some features that are com- 
mon to computer-based accounting systems. We looked in par- 
ticular at the balance sheet and the income statement and we 
touched on the use of a general ledger. Continuing with this dis- 
cussion, we'll examine additional accounting concepts that will 
help you become more informed and put you in a better posi- 
tion to understand the nature of some of the accounting soft- 
ware now on the market. 

The Building Blocks: Accounts. The method that's used to 
record accounting data in its most basic form is called an ac- 
count. A business might have one account for assets, another 
for liabilities, several accounts for expenses, and so on. It's 
helpful to visualize an account on paper as being represented by 
the letter T (hence such an account is often called a T-ac- 
count). Increases to the account are recorded on the left side 
and decreases in it are recorded on the right side of the T. In 
accounting, this process is called making debits and credits. 
While these terms have many meanings outside of the world of 
accounting, within this world they simply mean entries on the 
left side of the account (debits) and entries on the right side of 
the account (credits). 

The ledger is no more than a grouping of accounts. A busi- 
ness may have many account ledgers. There may be one 
called an accounts receivable ledger and another referred to 
as the accounts payable ledger. The ledgers contain accounts 
that record information about amounts due to be received by 
the business (receivables) or amounts to be paid by the busi- 
ness (payables). 

The Chart of Accounts. Every business needs to set up a 
chart of accounts at some point in time. This is usually done 
prior to setting up an accounting system for the firm. The list 
of all the accounts to be included in the accounting system is 
called the chart of accounts. 

If the account numbering scheme is selected carefully, 
such a list can be used by the organization to retrieve valuable 
financial information. For example, a firm may decide to use 
three digits to represent an account number. The first digit 
might represent a general category (for example, 1 = assets, 2 
= liabilities, and so on) . The second digit would represent sub- 
categories within a particular major category. For example, 
under assets would be receivables, inventory, property, and so 
on. Each of these categories could be given a unique digit. A 
third digit could represent an actual account. To clarify these 
points, let's look at an excerpt from a chart of accounts. 



I Assets 

I I Current Assets 

I I I Cash 

112 Savings Account 



12 Inventory 

121 Rav^ Material 

122 Work in Progress 

123 Finished Goods 



2 Liabilities 

21 Current Liabilities 

21 1 Accounts Payable 



Thus, the code 121 identifies that the account is an asset (1) ; it 
is an inventory account (12), and it is raw material (121). As 
you can see, this scheme allows you to extract a variety of 
summary information about accounts. For example, by list- 
ing all accounts with 1 for a first digit, you'd get a listing of all 
the asset accounts. 



The number of accounts depends entirely on how much in- 
formation and detail managers of the business wish to have ac- 
cess to. 

A Journal. The journal is simply a chronological record of 
any transactions that have taken place. It lists the names of the 
accounts affected by the transactions and the amounts in- 
volved. Thus, the journal tells what changes are to be made to 
certain accounts. When the account balances are changed, the 
process is called posting. The order of operations, then, is as 
follows : 

1. Make an entry to the journal. 

2. Post these entries to the appropriate accounts. 

3. Use the ledger to summarize account data. 

The Role of the Computer, Obviously, all this can be a 
time-consuming, complex, difficult task. "The computer is well 
suited to such applications. Some of its particular advantages 
over bookkeeping by hand are the ability to process informa- 
tion quickly; the ability to interact with several files (ac- 
counts, journals, ledgers) ; greater security and control; more 
accurate information; and the ability to produce a variety of 
useful management reports. 

More Accounting Packages. Of course, it's not possible to 
describe here all aspects of the accounting field, but even so 
much information as we've discussed can be helpful in eval- 
uating the features of the various software packages currently 
on the market. 

We'll now review these packages, employing the method 
we used when we reviewed data base management systems. 
We'll review the features of the major packages, then present a 
summary evaluation of all the packages for your reference 
and review. 

Westware System II Software. The Westware System II 
software (Westware Software Inc., Ontario, OR) is a com- 
pletely self-contained package that performs most of an or- 
ganization's financial record-keeping functions. This very 
comprehensive package features programs for handling in- 
ventory, payables, receivables, payroll, general ledger, gen- 
eral journal, chart of accounts, vendor list, and customer hst 
and performs several system maintenance functions — such as 
making backup disks and changing dates. 

The system requires 48K with DOS 3.3 (although you can 
send for a DOS 3.2 version) and two disk drives. Most business 
applications are best designed around a two-drive system, so 
this should not be considered a drawback. A printer is a prac- 
tical necessity for programs that produce financial reports, 
paychecks, and invoices. 

Included in the package are two manuals, the first of which 
is a lesson manual that takes the reader step-by-step through 
an actual application. The second manual is a detailed opera- 
tions guide, explaining all the features of the package. In addi- 
tion, a circuit board (called a KSAM card) is provided for in- 
stallation in your Apple. KSAM stands for Keyed Sequential 
Access Method. This technique is used by some of the pro- 
grams in the package to organize and then retrieve stored data 
efficiently. It is really ROM (read-only memory) on a board. 
The board is inserted into slot 7 of your machine and makes 
possible two-second access to any record you search for by 
looking for a key field. While it's somewhat unusual for a cir- 
cuit board to be included as part of a package, you can expect 






On-screen facsimiles — no new data entry mettiods to 
learn; enter raw data on forms & let computer perform all 
the math. 

Auto-updating — changes in one form reflected in all 
others for immediate error correction. 

Tax bool(-keeping — long itemized lists accommodated 
with numbers easily changed from month to month or 
year to year. 

Tax planning — rapid estimates of tax bite without 
laborious completion of all forms.

to see much more of this in the future. It allows a manufac- 
turer to include more options as part of a package and it pro- 
vides a certain measure of security to the user. 

As is the case with most systems, it's imperative that you 
make backups of your disks. Westware provides an option on 
the main menu that carefully guides you through the process of 
making backups. 

As an additional measure of security, you have the option of 
creating passwords to control access to the programs and data 
that make up the system. Since some of the financial operat- 
ing data of an organization is meant to be confidential, having 
the ability to control access to it is useful. 

The Components of the System. The chart of accounts pro- 
gram includes options for adding an account number, deleting 
an account number, searching the account file, listing the con- 
tents of the file, and changing the information in a record. A 
record contains a six-digit account number (structured to pro- 
vide for a variety of subaccounts) , a descriptive title for the ac- 
count, an account budget, a beginning balance, and two year- 
end amounts. The chart of accounts may contain up to four 
hundred records. The system gives you the ability to find out 
quickly the status of the file, that is, how many records are in a 
particular file and how much room is left. 

The inventory component of the package has all of the re- 
quired file maintenance options (add items, delete items, 
change information about items, search the file, and so on) . An 
inventory record contains information about the part number, 
description, manufacturer, last transaction date, unit of mea- 
sure, quantity on hand, reorder level, unit cost, extended cost, 
retail price, reorder quantity, and margin. There's also an op- 
tion that allows the user to add an amount that has been re- 
ceived to the current amount of that item in inventory. Fur- 
thermore, a point-of-sale feature prints out an invoice for 
purchases, refunds, and quotations, with discounts if desired. 
A reorder report that searches the entire file and prints out a 
list of items whose current inventory levels have dropped 
below reorder points can also be requested. The system allows 
up to one thousand inventory records. 

Both the vendor file and the customer file utilize all the file 
maintenance options described. These files contain name, ad- 
dress, and miscellaneous data about the vendors or cus- 
tomers. Each file may contain up to four hundred records. 

The primary financial features of the package center 
around the accounts payable, accounts receivable, and gen- 
eral ledger programs. As you may recall, the general ledger is 
used to produce the balance sheet and the income statement. 
Some of the features the accounts receivable program pro- 
vides are the abilities to generate and print bills, print a past- 
due report (for thirty, sixty, ninety, or one hundred twenty days 
overdue), apply monthly interest, enter payments received, 
and produce month-end reports. Both the accounts payable 
and the accounts receivable files can contain up to four hun- 
dred records. In addition to the general ledger, a general jour- 
nal can contain as many as eight hundred entries. 

Another program provided with the system produces a pay- 
roll and maintains employee salary data. This program han- 
dles up to one hundred employees, four hundred fifty pay 
transactions, and four hundred fifty deductions or miscellane- 
ous transactions. Several different payment methods can be 
used, including hourly, salaried, and commission plans. The 
user can choose whether the pay period is weekly, biweekly, 
semimonthly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annual- 
ly. The user can maintain both federal and state tax-table in- 
formation, miscellaneous pay deductions, W-2 forms, and so 
on. Of course, actual checks to employees can be printed. 

To round out the features of the system, a variety of addi- 
tional programs is provided. With these, you can make back- 
up copies of programs and data, copy disks, establish printer 
characteristics, and even create company letterhead at the top 
of every report. 

Westware 's programs are available on 514-inch and 8-inch 
floppies as well as on hard disk. This is nice to know, particu- 
larly if you anticipate that your needs may grow and that you 



may at some time be upgrading to a larger computer system. 

Report formats were designed to a 132-column printer and 
are "not guaranteed" if another size printer is used. However, 
information about what kinds of forms and checks are needed 
to use the system most effectively is very helpful. 

The entire Westware package interfaces with another 
Westware product, the Universal Data Base. This set of pro- 
grams allows you to produce various other management re- 
ports using the data created by the programs in the account- 
ing package. Altogether, the Westware System II is a very 
comprehensive set of programs. 

Looking Ahead Next Month. Next month, we'll continue our 
review of accounting-oriented systems. We'll look at Spec- 
trum Software's Business Series, Software Technology for 
Computers 's Accounts Payable package. The Accountant by 
Decision Support Software, and Micro Lab's Invoice Factory. 
We'll also present a chart that compares, contrasts, and eval- 
uates each of the packages. 

The Readers Speak. "An associate of mine is thinking about 
buying an Apple computer system. He is calling and writing 
dozens of places in an effort to get the lowest cost possible. I 
am concerned that it may not be in his best interests to get the 
cheapest system. I wonder about warranties, service, and all 
the rest. Is there any information available about the best ap- 
proach to take?" P.L., Burlington, MA 

This is a very controversial question. It's not uncommon for 
the consumer to be faced with the price-versus-service deci- 
sion. A couple of factors make the microcomputer market- 
place unique. First, most consumers aren't able to repair their 
own machines. Second, microcomputers are a major expense. 

Thus, the buyer is faced with a difficult choice. The Apple is 
relatively expensive, so, quite naturally, consumers would like 
to pay as small a price as possible. In fact, many people would 
not be able to enter the market if they couldn't find a discount

A Holiday Present from Peter Oli- 
vierifor Softalk's Readers 

Enjoy a Softalk word search with an 
Apple twist ! You have to figure out what 
words are hidden before you can search 
for them. All words have appeared in Sof- 
talk and are fairly common to avid Sof- 
talk readers. To help, some clues are pro- 
vided. Answers appear below. 

This isn't a contest, there are no 
prizes and nothing to send in; it's just 
for fun.

price. They feel they must take the risks associated with lack 
of service. 

Discount consumers are, nevertheless, new Apple owners 
and, as such, they're likely to be in the market for additional 
hardware and software. Even if dealers who 're level 1 service 
centers (which are obligated by agreement with Apple Inc. to 
service warrantied Apples) did not sell a machine, they would 
in all likelihood service the machine in an effort to secure fol- 
lowup business. Of course, the dealer's first obligations are to 
regular customers. 

Put yourself in the position of a dealer. A potential cus- 
tomer comes into your store, asks about Apples, and con- 
sumes a fair amount of your time. Then, when it comes time to 
buy, the customer goes to a bargain basement source. Later, 
when service is needed, the customer returns to your store. 
How would you feel? 

I think it's critical that dealers be supported. It's important 
to maintain this network, strengthen it, and use it whenever 
possible. Good dealers take care of their regular customers; 
customer service is important to them. It's not unusual for cus- 
tomers' problems to be solved while they wait. 

The impact of microcomputers is just beginning to be felt. 
A strong dealer network is essential to accelerate the growth 
and development of the industry. 

Have a nice holiday!

On June 5, 1982, a luxurious cruise ship wiii depart from Vancouver, Canada, with severai Appies on board. For sev- 
en days, these privileged Appies wiii be learning such arcane arts as assembly language from Roger Wagner and 
graphics from Ken Williams, as well as compiling Applesoft programs into assembly code with Dennis Goodrcw. 

Besides coming bacit more intelligent, the Apples will be treated to the usual shipboard conveniences by a pro- 
fessional staff dedicated to providing everything a microprocessor might desire. The Apples will enjoy some of the 
most dramatic scenery north of Silicon Gulch, stopping in Ketchiltan, Juneau, and Skagway, some of the last fron- 
tier communities. They'll cruise past Glacier Bay— giving the Apples a loolt at a true hi-res graphic. 

Amazingly, in Iceeping with Softallt's policies, the Apples will be taking the tour free. Apples craving the com- 
panionship of their owners may inquire about the cost of human participation by writing to:

SOFICARD 
Symposium 

by Greg l!bbetts 




Welcome to the fourth and final installment of our continu- 
ing series on Basic-80. This month we'll deal with the functions 
suppUed in Basic-80, and, following that, we'll discuss some of 
those miscellaneous things that have been passed over in our 
previous discussions. 

The difference between functions and commands in any of 
the Basic languages is often difficult to define. A function is 
generally an operation performed on a single, specific operand 
(usually a numeric variable), returning a specific result. Nor- 
mally the result must be placed in a numeric variable to be re- 
coverable — as, for example, in the case of X=SQR(Y), where 
the square root of Y is assigned to the variable X. The opera- 
tion is usually mathematic, but, regardless of its form, it al- 
ways returns the same result for a given operand. 

Commands, on the other hand, such as the ones we've dealt 
with up to now, may or may not have arguments to act upon, 
and may either return an answer or cause the computer to per- 
form a specific action. 

The definitions are very close, and there is some overlap 
between these two operations. 

Now let's look at the specific functions available in Basic-80 
that are not found in Applesoft or Integer Basic : button, cdbl, 
cint, csng, cvi, cvs, cvd, eof, fix, hex$, inkey$, input$, instr, loc, 
lof, Ipos, mki$, mks$, mkd$, oct$, space$, strings, varptr, and 
vpos. 

In the interest of space, examples will be provided only 
where the use of the function is not obvious or has not already 
been thoroughly treated in the manual. 

Button is the function that returns the current value of a 
specified game controller pushbutton — 1 if it's being pressed, 0 
if not. Button replaces the peeks required to gain this informa- 
tion under Applesoft. 

Cint, csng, and cdbl are functions that convert numeric var- 
iables from one type to another— to integer, single precision, 
and double precision respectively. Generally, when you're con- 
verting from a less precise value to a more precise one, as 
from single to double precision, for example, a rounding error 
will be introduced because of the inability of the computer's bi- 
nary storage method to reflect decimal values with 100 per- 
cent accuracy. Note the example listed under the cdbl func- 
tion in Volume II of the SoftCard Manual. 

Cvi, CVS, and cvd are paired with mki$, mks$, and mkd$, 
and provide the means to convert numeric variables into a 
form that can be stored easily in a random disk file. Essential- 
ly the mk functions convert integers, single-precision, or 
double-precision values into a coded string form that can be 
placed in ASCII disk file and subsequently can be typed out to 
the terminal — avoiding the garbled output that straight nu- 
meric data would produce. The cv functions convert those cod- 
ed string values back to their numeric counterparts. 

Eof, loc, and lof also have to do with disk files. Eof is de- 
signed for use with sequential files ; it's the means by which the 
end of a sequential file is detected during input from the file. 
By testing for eo/— which changes to -1 when the end of the file 
has been reached— you can avoid the INPUT PAST END er- 
ror that occurs if more input is requested than exists in the file. 

Loc and lof are for use with either random or sequential 



disk files and return different results depending on the type of 
file being accessed. Loc, when used with random files, will re- 
turn the next sequential record number following a get or put 
statement, provided these statements don't themselves spec- 
ify record numbers. That is, when you are repeatedly input- 
ting to or outputting from a random file without specifying rec- 
ord numbers, the loc function v/ill always return the next rec- 
ord number to be accessed. With sequential files, loc returns 
the total number of 128-byte sectors that have been accessed 
since the file was opened. 

Lof returns the total number of records contained in the last 
extent of the file in question. If the file is no more than one ex- 
tent in length, then Zo/ returns the true length of the file in rec- 
ords. If the file is longer than one extent, then you will have to 
add the appropriate number of records contained in the pre- 
ceding extents. 

Fix, hex$, and oct$ are for the conversion of numeric 
values. Fix is nearly identical to int, since it truncates the non- 
integer portion of floating-point values; but it doesn't return 
the next lower number for negative values. See the example in 
Volume II of the SoftCard manual for clarification. 

Hex$ and oct$ return strings that are the hexadecimal and 
octal equivalents, respectively, of the argument. In cases 
where you wish to print the numeric values in hexadecimal or 
octal, these functions are the only easy way to do the job. 

Inkey$ and inputs are additional methods of getting char- 
acter input from the keyboard or, in the case of input$, from 
the keyboard or a disk file. Neither function echoes characters 
to the display, so if you want echoing you have to set up print 
statements. InkeyS is similar to peeking the Apple keyboard 
strobe from either Apple Basic, in that it performs a one-time 
check of the keyboard to see if a key has been pressed. Either 
the null string (""), if no key has been pressed, or the char- 
acter corresponding to the pressed key will be placed in the 
string variable used in the function. For example, 
X$=INKEY$ will return the character pressed or the null 
string in X$. This function is often used to check for a response 
to a "hit any key to continue" statement in a program. Com- 
bined with while/wend, such a device might look like this : 

100 Print "Hit any key to continue":X$="":While X$ = "":X$= INKEY$:Wend 

No argument is required with inkey$. 

Inputs, on the other hand, may have either one or two argu- 
ments and will get a set number of characters— the number 
specified in the first argument. This input will be taken either 
from the keyboard, if only one argument is present, or from a 
disk file, if a second argument of the form #x is given, where x 
is the file buffer of the file in question. All characters except 
control-C are accepted and placed in the assigned string vari- 
able; control-C will prematurely terminate the input se- 
quence. Inputs is generally the only way a carriage return can 
be input without terminating a multiple-character input state- 
ment. Another important use of inputs is for the gathering of 
data via keyboard entry at times when you want the user to re- 
strict his entries to a set number of characters. 

The advantage of inputs over inkeyS is that with inputs it's 
not necessary to set up a loop for multiple-character input. The

advantage of inkey$ is that your program can test each char- 
acter of input as it's entered, to detect illegal input or special 
user-selected delimiters. Choose the function that's appropri- 
ate for your needs. 

Instr is a function that searches a named string for the oc- 
currence of a second named string, then returns the character 
position where the match was found. It's often used for search- 
ing through tables of keywords that have been stored in a se- 
ries of strings, rather than in string arrays. In this use, it is 
much faster than a for-next loop with a sequence of equi- 
valence-type tests. For example: 

100 X$ = "DROPSAVETAKEKILLJUMPDIVESWIM" 
110 Input "DO WHAT";Y$ 

120 X = lnstr (X$,Y$):lf X = 0 Then 40:Rem 40 is error routine. 
130 Y = lnt(X/4)+l:On Y Goto 200,300,400,500,600,700,800 

Lpos is a function whose only purpose is to return a value 
corresponding to the current print position in the line printer 
character-buffer. Because of differences between printer con- 
figurations, the position returned by lpos may not be the cur- 
rent physical location of the print head on the paper. The pri- 
mary purpose of this function is to insert carriage returns 
and/or linefeeds at certain line lengths for nonformatted out- 
put. Because of the wide number of different printer-interface 
card-printer driver combinations, lpos may not be totally us- 
able in your system. A few seconds of experimentation will let 
you know. 

Space$ and strings are functions designed to shorten the 
Basic code needed to print lengthy repetitions of spaces or 
other characters. Space$, as its name implies, will assign the 
number of spaces specified in its argument to the assignment 
variable; this variable can then be printed, as, for example, 
X$=SPACE$(50) :PRINT X$. These statements will cause fifty 
spaces to be printed at the terminal. 

String $ has two arguments. The first gives the number of 
repetitions, and the second supplies the ASCII code for the 
character to be repeated. Alternatively, the second argument 
may hold the character itself, enclosed by quotes. The state- 
ment X$= STRINGS (50,32): PRINT X$ is equivalent to the 
spaces statement in the previous paragraph. Both can, of 
course, be used with Iprint statements as well. One very handy 
use of either function is to form ^n auto-center subroutine. For 
example : 

1 X$ = Space$((40-Len(Y$))/2):Print X$;Y$;X$!Return

Varptr is a function used to find the memory address of the 
first byte of a variable stored by Basic-80. This is most often 
done so that the data can be altered or otherwise accessed — 
either by a Basic program using peeks and pokes — or by a ma- 
chine language subroutine. The address is returned as an in- 
teger in the range -32768 to -1-32767, and the result, if negative, 
must be added to 65536 to obtain the correct address. 

Varptr can also be used with an argument of the form #x, 
where a? is a file number. In sequential-access mode, this will 
return the memory address of the beginning of the disk-file I/O 
buffer for the file specified. In random-access mode, the func- 
tion will return the address of the beginning of the file's field 
buffer (see last month's column for the difference between 
field buffer and I/O buffer) . 

Varptr can be used with any type of variable; however, 
with string variables, the function returns not the memory lo- 
cation of the first byte of the string, but rather the memory lo- 
cation of the length and pointer set that, in turn, points to the 
string. 

Using varptr with strings is a special case and is the one 
situation where this function is most often used. A very com- 
mon use is to locate the starting addresses for short machine 
language routines that have been placed in memory by coding 
them as strings. Once they've been located, a simple call will 
execute them. Here's an example: 



XOR 




zsro Qccumulotor 


LD 


HL,F400 


locotion of start of Appl6 text screen 


LD 


DE,F401 


start + 1 


LD

LD 


A,(HL) 


get last fill value 


INC 


A 


value + 1 


JR 


NZ,FO 


do until overflow to 0 again 


RET 




then return 



The 18 bytes representing this program in hex are : 

AF 21 00 F4 1 1 01 F4 01 F8 03 77 ED BO 7E 3C 20 FO C9 

The following Basic-80 program captures this routine as a 
series of elements in a data statement in line 10. It then builds 
the string X$ from these elements in line 20, thereby putting 
them in memory; finds the length and address pointer in line 
30, using varptr; converts the low- and high-order bytes of the 
actual string address and assigns the address to variable Y in 
line 40 ; makes sure that Y is a two-byte integer and calls the 
routine in line 50. As an exercise, you might wish to type in the 
Basic program; the result may amuse you. 

10 DATA &HAF, &H21, &H00, &HF4, &H11, &H01, &HF4, &H01, &HF8, &H03, 

&H77, &HED, &HBO, &H7E, &H3C, &H20, &HFO, &HC9 
20 FOR I = 1 TO 18 : READ A : X$ = X$ + CHR$(A) : NEXT I 
30 X = VARPTR (X$) 

40 Y = PEEK (X + 2) * 256 + PEEK (X+1) 
50 Y = Y - 65536! ; CALL Y 
60 END 

Note: this program affects the Apple 40-column text screen 
only. Its function with an 80-column board installed may be un- 
predictable. 

The final function we'll talk about is vpos. This function re- 
turns the current vertical position (1 to 24) of the cursor on the 
screen. It can itself be used as an argument to vtab for rela- 
tive movement of the cursor, as in VTAB VPOS (0)-l.

With Object Editor you can create whatever 
objects you want in the colors of your choice. 
You can also type in whatever 3D text you 
want and in different sizes. And savi ng an 
object is as easy as naming it. 

Then give the object names to Motion 
Programmer and see how the beautifully laid 
out keyboard controls will let you switch objects 
on or off, animate them, or add upper or lower 
case 2D text mixed right in. It's remarkably\ 
easy. 

You can also record your entire presentation, 
animation and all, for later use with IVIotion 
Playback, or just take "computer snapshots" 
of scenes with Slide Show Playback.

no easy task. It is surrounded by spinning 
shields that send out orbs of energy aimed 
directly at you. "The Wormwall" places you 
in one of the strangest mazes ever created. 
The walls do not connect. Openings only 
occur temporarily as moving colored seg- 
ments in the walls cross. In addition, there 
are munching mouthers in each level of 
the maze who are ready to gobble you up 



should you misjudge the time and loca- 
tion an opening will occur.

T" I his is not a C!hristmas story, although it is 
about birthdays. This is not a story about 
gifts, although many families are the richer 
today because of this birthday. This is not a 
Dickensian story about the rehabilitation of 
some modern-day Scrooge, although it has 
something to do with commerce. And, final- 
F ly, this is not a story about a piece of bestsell- 
ing software, but it does touch on software. 

The dramatis personae of this particular tale are Melody 
Huntington, her father Fred, and her mother Barbara. Center 
stage is Corcoran, California, although other locales span the 
nation. The software in question is Hodge Podge, a lo-res pre- 
kindergarten educational program published by Dynacomp. 

There are other elements that need to be tinderstood to 
grasp the short tale that's about to unfold. 

The first is that the Huntingtons are the foimders and pro- 
prietors of Huntington Computing, one of the largest purvey- 
ors of mail-order software in the country. This came about 
when they noticed that they had nowhere to go close to home to 
purchase software. 

Fred is principal of Mark Twain Elementary School, and 
Barb taught in the Corcoran school system. They reasoned 
that if they could be distant from computer stores in the mid- 
dle of California, there must be other computer owners who 
weren't close to a computer store that stocked a full line of soft- 
ware. 

So, for a ridiculously small sum of cash, they went into busi- 
ness less than eighteen months ago and have built a mega- 
bucks firm that Barb now tends full-time, along with nearly 
thirty employees. 

You also need to know more about Hodge Podge, written by 
Marsha Meredith. It's programmed in colorful lo-res graphics 



and teaches basic recognition and number skills for preschool- 
ers. Many of the pictures are accompanied by a couple of bars 
of songs familiar to tiny tots. 

No one will mistake Meredith's programming techniques 
for those of Bill Budge or Nasir. The lo-res graphics are appro- 
priately colorful for the intended audience, but both the graph- 
ics and animation are strictly early Apple. It's a program done 
with the preschooler in mind and, as such, eschews the bells 
and whistles that would keep even a first grader interested. 

As it happens. Melody's second birthday was July 25 and 
Fred and Barb were contemplating how to celebrate it. They 
noted that her favorite progpram on the Apple was Hodge 
Podge and they likewise knew that Hodge Podge was not a pro- 
gram that many retailers were carrying. 

So they conducted an advertising campaign in most of the 
national computer magazines in August, ottering Hodge Podge 
for the price of $18.99, marked down from $23.95, to £inyone who 
would call and say "Happy birthday. Melody." 

The campaign succeeded beyond their wildest expecta- 
tions. Some families even got on the phone together to sing 
Happy Birthday to Melody. Huntington probably moved more 
copies of Hodge Podge in August than the rest of the country 
combined. 

Because it happened in August, this can't qualify as a 
Christmas story. But it has all the elements. Birthday best 
wishes for a little girl from all parts of the country. Children 
now enjoying and learning from a program that they might 
otherwise not have had. New life breathed into a deserving 
product. 

In a way, every time one of those dozens of kids boots up 
Hodge Podge, they're celebrating Melody's birthday. So this 
isn't a Christmas story, but it sure would be a good one if it 
were.

Hi-Res Adventure #4: Ulysses and the Golden Fleece. By Bob 

Davis and Ken Williams. Once again, On-Line Systems, like 
only a few others, takes adventuring out of the dungeon, this 
time to the sunlit climes of ancient Greece and the Aegean is- 
lands. And, once again, On-Line has chosen to present an ad- 
venture with a story rather than a race for score or treasures. 

A couple of months ago, Bob Davis was a fat and sassy 
Coarsegoldian, innocent and computerless. Then one day, he 
wandered unknowingly into the offices of On-Line and there en- 
covintered a virulent virus; he was badly bitten by the 
adventure bug. Now, Bob Davis is a sleek and sophisticated 
Coarsegoldian, worldly wise and Apple addicted — and (truth 
at last) the author of the first Classical adventure, Ulysses. 

The roots of this adventure in mythology are loose to say 
the least. But who cares? The famous characters are there, the 
flavor is there, the good adventure riddles are there, and it all 
melds into a lot of fun. 

As Ulysses (that's you) , you must gain the favor of the king, 
acquire provisions, hire a crew, and leave no stone unturned 
before you even board your ship. Once sailing, you must 
weather hurricanes, lorelei, even wicked water kings. 

You'll visit islands of fascination and danger and find clues 
and treasures and labyrinthine caves. You'll have to use 
imagination that looks outside the norm for means of tran- 
sportation and for tools. 

All in search of a golden fleece. When you find it, you'll do 
so with the help of something very beautiful but fleeting. And 
you'll get credit for fulfilling your quest. 

The multicolorful hi-res graphics we've come to know and 
love from On-Line are not standing still. Williams and staff 
have made quantum leaps in some respects. A nice feature, 
apart from the graphics but enhanced by them, is the ability to 
communicate, if briefly, with the people who populate the 
adventure. 

On-Line Systems has two new winners in Ulysses: the 
adventure, which is the best from On-Line since Wizard and 
the Princess; and Bob Davis, a new author from whom we 
hope we'll be seeing many new adventures. n(T

Arith-Magic. By Joanne Benton Rudnytsky. Arith-Magic is a 
program for those who like to tinker with math. Three games, 
Diffy, Tripuz and Magic Squares, make learning math fun. As 
well as strengthening skills in addition, subtraction and multi- 
plication, Arith-Magic helps the user see relationships and 
patterns in math puzzles. You need to excercise faculties in 
logic and deduction to solve the problems. 

Tripuz, the easiest of the three, gives the player a puzzle in- 
volving either addition or multiplication. As with the other two 
games, Tripuz gives instructions if requested. The instruc- 
tions work backward in this case. 

The game is laid out in a triangle of six numbers, three 
known and three unknown. Three numbers forming the cor- 
ners of the triangle are unknown. Between any two comers is a 
number which is the sum of those two comers. The three sums 
between the comers are the given numbers and from them the 
player must determine the unknown numbers in the comers. 

The computer lets you know if you chose a wrong number. 



"Try again," it says. "Do you want a hint?" Such a helpful 
computer. Discovering the pattern is challenging to figure out 
but once you have it, it's a breeze. 

The most interesting and educational of the games is Mag- 
ic Squares. Magic square puzzles have been published in 
many a math puzzle book, but the program's advantage as a 
guide is that if offers you hints, prodding you to make intuitive 
or logical discoveries for yourself. The computer tells you 
when you're right or wrong and moves you through step by 
step until you discover the secret of the magic squares. 

Nine numbers in a three-by-three grid make up the magic 
square. In a given square, any three numbers in sequence al- 
ways add up to the same sum. You can add three numbers 
across any row, down any column, and through either of the di- 
agonals and you will always get the same result. 

The problem then is, given only four numbers, you must de- 
termine the remaining five. The difficulty of the problem de- 
pends on which four numbers are given. By the time you solve 
the most difficult of the problems, the computer declares you a 
champ. You will then have leamed some interesting relation- 
ships among the numbers that make up a magic square. 

Diffy is a dilly. A mysterious case of the disappearing dif- 
ferences, the game challenges you to choose four numbers that 
will form the corners of a square. The differences between 
those numbers will beccome the four comers of the next

subtraction yourself. The object is to pick numbers that will 
give you the most rounds of play before all the differences be- 
tween the remaining numbers become zero. It may soimd 
easy, but if you can last more than six rounds, you're good. It 
takes a lot of thought or a lot of luck to come up with long 
lasting numbers. The secret of this game remains a mystery at 
this office with a record high of nine rounds.

Palace in Thunderland. By Dale Johnson and Ken Rose. If 
you've read the works of Lewis Carroll, no matter how long 
ago, you'll have an advantage in this pun-filled adventure. 

Micro Lab's follow-up to their extremely frustrating but 
well-done Mad Venture — which also bears resemblances to the 
history of Alice — is perhaps not as difficult but it's just as en- 
joyable. 

ResembUng in setup the Scott Adams Adventures, Palace 
in Thunderland doesn't stoop to setting pointless traps just to 
kill you off. In fact, the ways to get killed are few, but those few 
are real posers to get past. 

When you begin the adventure, for example, your moves 
are numbered; you have just so much dayhght, and, as you'll 
soon discover, circumstances conspire to rob you of indoor 
artificial light. Numerous discoveries must be made and 
numerous logical-in-context steps taken before you can avoid 
or survive the darkness. 

By that point, you'll have had a lot of brain-teasing fun, and 
you'll still be only beginning. 

The object is to get rid of the wicked Queen of Hearts — 
another poser with with multiple steps required for solution. 
Even after you've achieved all this, you're apt to have a pretty

Birth of the Phoenix. Trusted friends have been immersed in it 
for months now; your favorite computer magazine gave it a 
glowing review. So yesterday, you went to your local retailer 
and bought — The Magician's Curse — your first adventure 
game. 

Now, you sit down at your computer, barely able to contain 
your anticipation. You turn the computer on, reverently place 
the disk in the drive, and settle in for what you expect will be a 
memorable experience. 

It's memorable all right, but not in the way you'd expected. 
To your dismay, you discover that you're unable to get the 
computer to understand anything you want to say. All you're 
trying to do is get past the courtyard gate, but your computer, 
firm, ever patient, and forever unbending, keeps giving you 
messages Uke "I don't understand" and "I don't know how to 
through." 

How much plainer can you be, you wonder, exasperated. 
Doesn't this game speak EngUsh? 

Now there's help. Birth of the Phoenix (Phoenix Software) , 
described as a class-one tutorial adventure, is just what the as- 
piring adventurer ordered. 

This program is loosely based on the ancient legend of the 
Phoenix. According to legend, the Phoenix is reborn every 500 
years out of the ashes that result from the burning of the old 
Phoenix. 

In addition to being fun to play, this game offers the novice a 
gentle initiation into some of the basic conventions, common 
phrases, and essential-to-know idiosyncracies that come with 
the territory in adventuring. 

You learn, for instance, that most adventure programs are 
set up to recognize a verb followed by a noun (drop key, get 
note, and so on) and you learn how to look for clues hidden in 
the various descriptions. You're introduced to the ins and outs 
of finding your way around in an adventure, as well as to the 
basics of mazes and maze mapping. 

Birth of the Phoenix also has an especially useful help/hint 
option that refers you to the appropriate page(s) of a thought- 
fully written manual for guidance. (The verb/noun tables at 
the end can also be helpful if you get stumped.) Even though 
you're being guided, you never feel condescended to or as 
though the answers are just being given away ; you still have to 
work to solve the adventure. This ensures feelings of genuine in- 
volvement in the playing and accomplishment in the solving. 

This program's super-reasonable $14.95 price tag may be 
disconcerting to buyers who think that for a program to be 
really good, it must be expensive. Don't let this line of reason- 
ing steer you away from this excellent program. Instead, be 
grateful and grab it. 

If you're new to adventuring, Birth of the Phoenix will chal- 
lenge and delight you, and will bring you the bonus of a val- 
uable tutorial that will facilitate your enjoyment of adventur- 
ing long after the phoenix has been reborn. )V

The Night Before Christmas and Christmas Songs. By Dr. 
Rick Coleman. The Christmas Story. By Mark and Connie 
Cross. In Sweden during the hoUdays people dance around the 
Christmas tree. In America the custom may soon become 
dancing around the computer. 

Two new Christmas programs are available this year that 
seem primarily for children, though adults might get into the 
yule spirit with them also. The Night Before Christmas and 
Christmas Songs and The Christmas Story provide the tradi- 
tional songs, poems, fables and bibhcal readings associated 
with this hohday. Although slanted towards children, very 
young children will need the help of their parents to read the 
text accompanying these programs. The Night Before Christ- 
mas has a simple structure— printed text and accompanying lo- 
res graphics for the different verses of this all-time favorite 
holiday poem. The second part of this program merits the

dance around the computer — Christmas songs with six tradi- 
tionals from which to choose, ranging from "Jingle Bells" to 
"The Twelve Days of Christmas." The fun comes in with the 
change pitch or tempo feature of this program. When deter- 
mining the tempo, the user picks a number from one to one 
hundred, with one being very slow and one hundred being ex- 
tremely fast. The program warns that either extreme could 
distort the song, but at any rate, it's fun to play with. Young or 
old musician can play around with the pitch just as easily — 
high, low, or average, or anywhere in between. Although par- 
ents might get tired of hearing the same songs over and over 
again, at least it'll keep the kids from peeking into the pack- 
ages under the tree. 

The second program. The Christmas Story, uses scripture, 
hymns, and hi-res graphics to tell the story of the birth of Je- 
sus. The program is divided into three parts; The Prophecy, 
Shepherds, and The Wise Men. Some of the songs included in 
this program are "Joy to the World," "The First Noel," and 
"Hark the Herald Angels Sing." The entire program takes 
about thirty minutes to run through, but the user can choose to 
see only individual sections. 

Both programs gave us a little bit of a problem when boot- 
ing up, so be sure you try out the disk you intend to buy while in 
the store. nn

Threshold. By Warren Schwader and Ken Williams. Perhaps it 
was inevitable that someone would come up with an arcade 
game that attempted to be all things to all arcade addicts. But, 
had you been wont to mull such an eventuality, chances are 
you would have looked to Sirius or Broderbund/Starcraft to 
bring it about. 

Instead, that game is here, but its perpetrator is the mas- 
ter publisher of hi-res adventuring, On-Line Systems. The 
game is Threshold, and the prognosis is many hours of great 
home-arcade fun. 

Only one thing remains the same from game to game in 
Threshold: you always shoot from the bottom. What you are 
shooting at varies enormously both in form and personality. In 
form, you'll encounter everything from maple tree helicopters 
to Volkswagen Bugs. In personality you'll enjoy — or be con- 
sumed by — slow, even spaceships that nearly disappear as 
they turn on their own axes or supersmooth airplanes speed- 
ing by in goose formation ; kamikazes that bounce erratically 
and intelligently before bombing you or lacy snowflakes that 
float just out of reach; and many, many more. 

On-Line expects few to see all the characters there are to 
see; but should you manage it, they promise you will recog- 
nize the last set. That fact alone is enough to create a good im- 
petus to keep at it. If you do make it, and live through it, you 
will have won. 

That the creatures shoot at you is not the only danger in 
Threshold. Some are not even super shots, although others are 
diabolically sharp in aim and timing. Unvarying is your finite 
supply of fuel and your laser's potential for overheating. When 
you overheat, you must simply wait, dodging bullets and 
watching your fuel supply wane until your weapon cools 
down. If you run out of fuel, you're through. 

Every four sets of creatures earns you a rendevous with an 
honest-to-Mehitabel mothership, complete with Model- A Ford 
flower vases. Despite mother's rather garish taste, mother's 
milk is pure fuel and readies you for the next set of four crea- 
tures. 

The hi-res graphics on Threshold are finely drawn and ex- 
traordinarily varying. Animation is at the forefront of prog- 
ress: extremely smooth in individual motion, in objects pass- 
ing over one another, and in collision. The potential for prob- 
lems in these areas is so well handled as to put anticipation of 
them out of the realm of consideration. 

Most important for the game player, collisions are ac- 
curate. These are sneaky adversaries, and many must be hit 
very precisely to be killed, but when you hit one, it's hit; and

Though it is very simple to use, the Dithertizer II represents 
the ultimate in video digitizing using the Apple II 
computer. The Dithertizer is on interface card v/hich 
converts video input into digitized images. Because the 
Dithertizer II is a frame grabber, DMA type digitizer, it 
offers extreme high speed in the conversion process (it 
grabs an entire frame in 1/60th of a second). The camera 
supplied v^ith the package is the Sanyo model VC1610X. 
Cabling is supplied for this camera so as to have the 
Dithertizer II system up and running in minutes. The video 
camera used for input must have external sync to allow 
for the frame grabber technology employed for digitizing. 
If a camera other than the model recommended is used, 
wiring adaptations by the user may be required. Software 
is supplied with the board to allow you to display up to 64 
pseudo grey levels on your Apple's screen. The number 
of grey levels may be changed with one keystroke. The 
intensity and contrast of the image are controllable via 
game paddles. Also supplied is software for image 
contouring for those interested in movement detection 
or graphic design applications.

Manager keeps track of all the information relative to the units 
themselves and the tenants, past and present. The Financial 
Manager keeps track of income and expenses. The package 
will handle a total of 400 units of up to ten different types in up 
to ten different locations. 

Among the many reports that can be generated are an 
apartment and resident listing that shows the name of the ten- 
ant with the pertinent apartment information. Another is the 
resident payment report, which tabulates all the tenant pay- 
ments received during the month. A summary of this activity 
can be generated. A listing of tenants with outstanding bal- 
ances is available. Also available is a monthly summary of the 
different types of expenses incurred during that month. For 
tax preparation, there is a summary of income and expenses 
for the month and the year to date. This also shows gross 
spendable income, gross equity income, and taxable income. 

Each month's financial activity is saved to a separate disk 
for filing when the month is closed. The program will also post 
the new rents due at the same time. Data on up to forty former 
tenants is also available. To save the most recent past tenant 
data, if forty are already recorded, one of the older records 
must be deleted. 

Those landlords who collect first and last month's rent at 
the start of tenancy will have no direct way to handle the last 
month rent other than to show the tenant overpaid for the en- 
tire tenancy. 

With each of the ten available apartment types, a rental 
rate must be assigned. If a specific unit is rented for a rate 
other than the one assigned for its type, a rent can be assigned 
to that unit. Unfortunately, when the rent is extended in the re- 
ports, the rate for the unit type is shown, rather than the ac- 
tual rent. In the actual record-keeping it does use the actual 
rent. 

High praise is due the publisher! This package is designed 
to be useful to a person who has never seen a computer before. 
Step-by-step directions start with an Apple still in its box and 
move to mining spare data disks and running the program. Er- 
ror trapping is excellent. It is nearly impossible to blow the 
program. The only technical flaw is that it is needlessly slot de- 
pendent, requiring your disk drive to be in slot 6. The speed, ac- 
curacy, and convenience of The Landlord should make it a wel- 
come tool for any apartment owner/operator. Even the long 
disk access time for, say, ten units, can be lived with when you 
know that they aren't any longer for 400 units. lU

Race for Midnight. By Steven Sacks. This hi-res game, from 
Avant-Garde Creations, is somewhat a cross between an 
adventure and a fantasy game. The player has been changing 
into a werewolf and must attempt to find a recipe and 
ingredients for a potion in a nearby dungeon. The potion, if all 
is done correctly, will cure the player of his lycanthropy. Of 
course, strange and unusual monsters stand in the way, and 
they must be destroyed. It's a very unique plot and makes for a 
very fun game. There's also a time limit, so you can't waste 
time examining unimportant things. 

The program accepts the usual two word commands and 
allows the player to switch between text and graphics with a 
press of the return key. The text portion is very similar to Scott 
Adams's, with a room description, objects, and exits followed 
by the last several commands. But the graphics are where 
Race for Midnight really comes through. Each room is drawn 
in full color, looking somewhat like the On-Line adventures. As

an estimate, there are at least thirty different colors. When you 
kill a monster, the room turns a bloody red color that looks 
really good. 

There are some interesting sound effects, too. There aren't 
many adventures with sound effects, but this one has them at 
every turn. "The Funeral March" when you get killed is es- 
pecially hilarious. Killing a monster, dropping an object, 
knocking on a door, and cursing at the computer all invoke 
various other sounds. 

Race for Midnight is faster in many ways than other hi-res 
adventures. This is because it does not go back to disk for 
every room. Usually there is about a three-room interval be- 
tween accesses. Generally, the colors fill faster than on any 
earlier program; according to Avant-Garde, the key to this 
phenomenon is revealed for all in that company's comprehen- 
sive package, Hi-Res Secrets. 

The only problem with Race for Midnight is that the ad- 
venture is not as long as it could have been, but the graphics 
and sound more than make up for that. We look forward to 
author Steven Sacks releasing another adventure in the near 
future. P*)

□ Santa's Sleigh Ride. By Bob Johnston and Al lapicca. Ener- 
gy Games (San Francisco, CA). The Yuletide was bound to 
bring a game like this. Flying Santa's sleigh on the Christmas 
run is a real ordeal. The age of technology has even affected 
Santa's job. Now he must avoid abandoned satellites as he 
darts through the sky, not to mention soaring birds and the 
Christmas grinch. 

You must steer Rudolph clear of these Christmas Eve men- 
aces while you attempt to drop Christmas goodies into the 
chimneys below. There goes a TV — and a doll, all sorts of stuff. 
Narrower chimneys pose a bigger problem and therefore give 
larger scores. 

To speed up the delivery route, Rudolph's flashing nose has 
been equipped with a photon laser. Rudolph's been shoved 
around enough in his lifetime, and he gets hot and nasty when 
those satellites get in his way. Santa jumps up and down for joy 
in his sleigh with each direct hit on a satellite or Christmas 
grinch. 

Timing is the key, when you hit the return key to drop pack- 
ages into the chimneys below. Luckily the arrow keys allow 
you to reroute packages once they have been dropped. 

Guide Rudolph clear of those oncoming birds. You lose 
points for each one that crashes into your sleigh. Don't be 
tempted to shoot them ; you lose even more points if you mis- 
take a bird for a satellite and zap it with your laser. You score 
the most points shooting down the Christmas grinch who will 
stop Santa at any cost including running into Santa's sleigh to 
blow it up. 

One would never have imagined a sleigh ride to be so vio- 
lent but the pace of the space age has affected everyone, in- 
cluding Rudolph and Santa. $29.95. 

□ FlleWhlz, by Stephen Goss, SoftHouse (Rochester, MN). 
Managing your files can be a lot of work. Shuffling papers, get- 
ting them out of order, losing them— sometimes it's easier to 
be disorganized. But one day a microcomputer was invented, 
and not long after that, computerized data base management 
systems came to be. 



Sound familiar? Don't count on it. 

Norad treats the simulation of national defense in a totally 
fresh, new way for the Apple, beginning with the graphics. The 
screen shows a fine-drawn map of the United States, looking 
slightly up toward Canada, which is considerably foreshort- 
ened by the angle. The curve of the planet can be seen above. 
Upon the map are nine major cities indicated by circles ; each 
city supplies a nearby missile site. 

A healthy city can supply a site with five missiles every so 
often; a damaged city is able to produce only three missiles be- 
cause of the effort required in extensive rebuilding. Some re- 
building is possible without decrease in missile productivity. 

When ICBMs appear over the polar cap, you choose by 
number from which base to send an ABM, then guide it with 
the arrow keys and detonate it with the space bar. You can 
send up as many ABMs in close succession as you wish, but 
you can only guide and detonate the first one extant. Key de- 
struction of useless ABMs is part of the strategy. 

The enemy missiles come in waves. After each wave, any 
injured cities that aren't totally destroyed are rebuilt and mis- 
sile sites are resupplied. When you've survived a certain num- 
ber of waves. Congress may approve the building of an MX 
site — a mobile missile station that can't be hit. Even later, 
further aid comes from a submarine firing waterproof mis- 
siles; it too cannot be destroyed. The catch is that crews of both 
the sub and the MX site get mighty uncomfortable if all the 
mainland cities and regular missile sites are destroyed; and 
they abandon ship. 

Norad offers an opportunity for far more strategic think- 
ing and planning than the home-arcade games that take off 
from the same reality. Yet it plays more simply mechanically 
and it makes more sense. n(T

□ Firebird. By Nasir, Gebelli Software (Sacramento, CA). 
The firebird whizzes by overhead, dropping firebombs on an 
unsuspecting building. Apartments burn and occupants leap 
for their lives. 

Your job is to control Piggo, the amazing fire pig who scur- 
ries up and down his ladder to douse flames, catching falling 
victims and carrying them to the top of the building where they 
can be rescued. 

Arrows move the ladder back and forth across the building 
while A and Z keys move Piggo up and down the ladder. 

After some practice you might be able to keep ahead of the 
firebird, who drops one bomb with every pass over the build- 
ing. But if you arrive too late the occupants must jump to the 
ground as the building goes up in smoke. Sorry, Charlie, no 
points for you. 

The victims wear an agonized scowl as they plummet 
downward, but you can change that expression to a broad grin 
if you catch and carry them to the top of your ladder where 
they are rescued by a circling helicopter. The former victim 
happily waves good-bye as he or she is carried off the screen to

In 



safety. The helicopter returns with a new unit to replace the old 
one that burned. 

Try as you might, you just can't keep ahead of the firebird. 
The longer you fend off the flames that attack the building, the 
faster the firebird flies. The object becomes to put up the best 
battle you can in a losing performance. 

You score in three ways. You can douse a fire before it de- 
stroys a unit. You can catch a falling victim. Or you can safely 
escort the victim to be picked up by the heUcopter. Prevention 
is not rewarded in Firebird. You get twice the points for catch- 
ing a falling victim as you do for putting out a fire, and four 
times as many points for carrying a victim up the ladder to be 
rescued. 

Don't let Piggo work under a falling victim or he will be 
knocked off the ladder and fall to his death. You only get three 
little Piggos per game so be careful. Also you can't quench fire 
while holding a victim that you've caught. The helicopter only 
picks up victims when moving left across the building. If your 
timing is bad two victims could be burned while one waits at 
the top of the ladder to be picked up. 

Once two columns have burned to the ground, the structure 
collapses and the game's over. The best you can hope for as the 
fires reach down to the lower levels of the building is to save 
the bottom row of apartments so that those nine units alone re- 
main. This feat will award you 5,000 bonus points and you get a 
chance to start on a new building with your present score in- 
tact. A Piggo 's work is never done. Will the firefighting pig 
ever get a chance to rest? 

Special features include sound off and escape to pause keys.

□ Hodge Podge, by Marsha Meridith, Dynacomp (Rochester, 
NY). Assuming that preschoolers can get the computer away 
from their parents, and assuming that an older person is there 
to boot up the program with a Basics disk, Hodge Podge can 
provide some enjoyable and educational hours for the user who 
is truly a micro. 

Hodge Podge is a combination of Sesame Street, Mother 
Goose, and data processing that can be played by children old 
enough to sit on an adult's lap and punch the keys. The pro- 
gram pops up colorful graphics of letters of the alphabet, num- 
bers, animals, and musical scales and plays some favorite nur- 
sery school songs. Preschoolers will probably be delighted 
when they learn mom and dad's computer can actually do 
more than VisiCalc. 

A great deal of learning possibilities are inherent in the pro- 
gram. Each letter and number on the keyboard corresponds to 
a different picture ; kids will have to recognize these letters and 
numbers simply to see and hear their favorites. For instance, 
F stands for Old McDonald's Farm, and the song will play over 
and over again each time the key is hit. The different animals 
of McDonald's farm also pop up on the screen as the song pro- 
gresses; somehow an elephant found its way onto this McDon- 
ald's Farm, along with the traditional sheep, goats, and cows. 

The program uses lo-res graphics beautifully, and the pic- 
tures are as complete as possible. The I key is for ice cream, 
which comes in different flavors each time the key is pressed, 
including chocolate chip complete with chocolate chips and 
cherry ice cream with cherry chips. 

Hodge Podge also has a keyboard feature that the adult can 
help set up. Hitting 0 turns the first eight number keys on the 
computer into a keyboard that will play the musical scale. A 
graphic representation of the notes played adds to the fun of 
this computerized piano. 

Adults can also introduce children to math with Hodge 
Podge. Shift-1 through shift-9 will display the word corres- 
ponding to the number. The symbols < and > are used in con- 
junction with animals to demonstrate the relationship of big 
and small. Addition can be made a game simply by hitting the 
" + " key. 

Hodge Podge seems to have a lot of possibilities. Unfor- 
tunately, we hadn't any preschoolers to test it more complete- 
ly, but the adults in our office liked it just fine. DOS 3.2. $23.95.

SOFICARD Symposhim 

from page 95 

This completes our discussion of the new functions avail- 
able to you in Basic-80. Obviously we didn't treat them in any 
kind of true depth. In later columns, we'll be looking at how 
these functions are used in specific circumstances, when we 
discuss programming techniques that take advantage of their 
features. 

Now we proceed to the subject of converting existing Ap- 
plesoft and Integer Basic programs to Basic-80, using .Apdos. 
The first thing we should mention is that you have to turn an 
Apple Basic program into a text file before making the trans- 
fer to Basic-80. This is necessary because each language has 
its own set of single-byte tokens to represent Basic keywords 
when the program is stored in memory or on disk. Although 
Apdos would transfer the tokenized file properly, Basic-80 
doesn't use the same set of tokens; consequently it couldn't 
translate the Apple Basic tokens back into their corresponding 
Basic-80 reserved words. When the program is turned into a 
text file, however, the word print gets stored on disk as the five 
bytes corresponding to the ASCII codes for the five letters. Al- 
though the Apple Basics could not recognize such an ASCII file 
as a valid program, Basic-80 has a built-in feature that allows 
it to save and load programs in this format. To place your Ap- 
plesoft or Integer Basic program into a text file, you need to 
add the following line : 

1 Print "Open APPLENAME" : Print "Write APPLENAME" : Poke 33,30 : List : 
Print "Close APPLENAME" : End : Rem the three prints must hove a control-D as 
the first character inside the quotes. 

When you run your program, it will create the text file AP- 
PLENAME, and that file will contain a listing of your pro- 
gram in ASCII. It is this new file that you transfer with Apdos. 
In practice, the Apple text files you create this way are best 
named the same as their Basic counterparts, with the addition 
of a single T on the end to indicate that they're text files. 



Since Apdos is designed to transfer all types of text files, it 
makes no assumptions about the need to insert linefeeds after 
carriage returns or to make any of the other alterations that 
are needed to make Basic programs compatible with CP/M 
file conventions during the transfer. It is therefore advisable to 
load the program into Basic-80 once and save it back to disk in 
ASCII format, using the ,A option. This will restructure the Ba- 
sic program file to fit CP/M's format. It also will provide a 
good opportunity to get rid of the extra line you added to per- 
form the text-file conversion under Apple DOS. Now that you 
have the file in proper format, you can make the necessary al- 
terations using a text editor. 

It makes little difference which editor you use, providing 
that it's sophisticated enough to have global find and global 
find/replace capability. This is by far the easiest method of 
converting programs written in other Basics to the lexical and 
execution conventions of Basic-80. Although ED.COM is rather 
primitive in some respects, it does have both of these neces- 
sary functions and will work quite well for this purpose. 

Although our primary purpose is the conversion of Apple- 
soft or Integer Basic programs, other Basics can be converted 
just as easily, once they have been entered from listings or 
downloaded from another CP/M system. Be sure that any pro- 
gram to be edited has been saved to disk in ASCII format. 

We have spent a lot of time in these past four columns dis- 
cussing the differences between Basic-80 and the Apple Ba- 
sics. We'll now put that knowledge to use. 

Because of the development of the Apple computer phe- 
nomenon, many Apple Basic programs make use of machine 
language routines in ROM, such as the statement CALL -936 
used so often to clear the screen. Such call statements will not 
work under Basic-80 without modification; many, in fact, will 
not work at all. In most cases, there are sufficient additional 
commands available in Basic-80 to perform such functions. 
HOME, for example, can be used to replace CALL -938. In any 
case, it will be necessary to locate all such call statements and 
replace them one by one, either with Basic statements or with

the necessary alterations in syntax and addressing to make the 
call work. Appendix C in Volume II of the SoftCard manual dis- 
cusses the subject of calling both Z-80 and 6502 machine lan- 
guage subroutines from within Basic-80. You should read it 
thoroughly before attempting to convert programs with this 
type of statement. 

Another problem is posed by programs that have machine 
language routines appended to them. These, of course, would 
not even transfer properly, using Apdos. If you have the ma- 
chine language routine in a separate disk file, you can transfer 
it to CP/M with Apdos and then write a short Basic loader rou- 
tine to load it into memory for later calling. Appendix A of Vol- 
ume II of the SoftCard manual provides an example of such a 
loader for hi-res pictures. The principle and operation are the 
same for other types of binary file. 

So far, the only kind of statement we've identified that will 
require alteration in every program, is call. Peek and poke 
statements belong in this category as well. Again, because of 
differences in addressing, these statements will not be looking 
at the same area of memory for which they were originally de- 
signed. In most cases, the peek and poke statements in the Ap- 
ple program will not work at all under Basic-80, for the same 
reason the call will not work ; the ROM routines and/or tem- 
porary storage locations for the ROM routines are seldom still 
active and many times not even accessible. You can certainly 
try them after applying the offset value to take care of mem- 
ory differences, but don't be surprised if they don't function. 

In addition to calls, peeks, and pokes, all I/O statements 
have to be reworked. The entire PR#x:PRINT "xxxxxxx": 
PR#0 string must be replaced with an LPRINT "xxxxxxx" 
statement, for example. Therefore, all PR# statements must 
be searched for, identified by function, and altered. Disk I/O 
also must be changed. To find disk I/O statements, search for 
control-D, since all such statements contain this character. In 
most cases, other peripherals that are accessed from an Apple 
Basic program will not be accessible from Basic-80 without 
some rather large reconfiguration. This subject is complex

enough that we will reserve discussion of it for a future 
column. 

Once you've identified the obviously unsupported com- 
mands mentioned here, you'll need to move on to the less com- 
mon ones. Wherever possible, use ED or your own text editor 
to perform the alterations, since it is so much easier to make 
changes globally than one at a time via Baslc-80. Spend some 
time getting familiar with the material in the appendices to 
Volume II of the manual. They provide good direction for de- 
termining the conversions that will be necessary. At some 
point, however, you'll need simply to run the program, looking 
for syntax errors and routines that don't function exactly as 
they do under the Apple Basics. As you encounter these, refer 
to Chapter One of the Baslc-80 manual for explanation. Some 
forms of incompatibility are rather subtle, so be sure to moni- 
tor output carefully before you assume the program is func- 
tioning 100 percent properly. 

Although we've made it sound somewhat complex, conver- 
sion is generally not that difficult — just time-consuming. It 
does, however, require a thorough understanding of what the 
original program is trjdng to do and a knowledge of the opera- 
tion and syntax of both languages. 

Here are some examples of familiar programs that were 
converted from Apple Basics to Basic-80: 

Brian's Theme: This program required no modification. 

Animals: this program required modification of all disk I/O 
routines, substring functions, and clear-screen calls. 

Color Demo and Color Demosoft: portions, like Kaleido- 
scope, required no modification; other portions had to be re- 
written almost entirely, because of pokes and peeks. 

With this we complete our treatment of Baslc-80, hoping 
we've provided you some good material for your use of this 
language. Obviously no column or series of columns can prop- 
erly point out all the features of a piece of software this com- 
plex. For those of you wishing to pursue the topic further, there 
are several books available, on Basic in general and on Baslc- 
80 In particular. Hi

BY (wic STinson 

"Try to remember a kind of Septem- 
ber, when grass was green and ..." 

Can you finish the line? Chances are, 
if you know the song but haven't heard it 
in a while and you can't quite recall what 
words come next, the first thing you'll do 
is start humming the tune to yourself; 
and hearing the tune again in your head 
will take you straight to whatever dis- 
tant pocket of your brain happens to store 
the missing lyrics. 

How we find our way around in the in- 
credible storage vaults of our minds is 
one of the most fascinating mysteries of 
psychology and physiology. Associations 
obviously play a big role ; a line of lyrics 
brings up a bit of melody that, in turn, 
serves to retrieve a few more words, and 
so on. Much too quickly for you to see the 
process, the combination of music and 
language evokes feelings and thoughts — 
maybe a feeling about autumn in gener- 
al, or a way you felt one particular Sep- 
tember, or something related to the last 
time you heard the song. And just as 
quickly, the images evoked lead to some- 
thing a computer person might describe 
as output — some piece of overt behavior 
perhaps, maybe just a change in facial 
expression, or something even more sub- 
tle, like a relaxing of muscles or a 
momentary quickening of the heartbeat. 

This whole complex chain of events 
occurs in approximately no time at all, 
which is what it has most in common 
with computer events. When you ask 
your Apple to do something elementary, 
like computing the sum of two and two 
and printing it on your monitor screen, 
the 6502 has to do quite an impressive 
number of things to make that happen — 
including consulting its memory to find 
out what's meant hyplus a.nd print. Even 
the so-called echoing of your command 
on the screen — the appearance of your 
letters and numbers on the monitor as 
you type them — is a many-stepped proc- 
ess. But all this complexity takes place 
on a time scale far removed from our or- 
dinary experience ; it happens so fast that 
we perceive it as a singular, instantane- 
ous event. 

Our Memories Are Bigger. In con- 



trast to the human mind, however, the 
Apple has a very limited extent of mem- 
ory to deal with. The connections be- 
tween the various elements of its mem- 
ory are straightforward and easy to un- 
derstand; as with everything else having 
to do with this machine, the Apple's 
memory is organized according to a nu- 
merical scheme. 

Each element of memory — each indi- 
vidual place where a piece of informa- 
tion may be stored — is given an I.D. num- 
ber, called an address. Because the 6502 
is designed to read or write data in eight- 
bit chunks, called bytes, the individual 
unit of memory also holds eight bits. 
Memory capacity is customarily mea- 
sured in kilobytes, abbreviated K, with a 
kilobyte equal to 1,024 bytes. 

When you're new to computers and to 
the language associated with computers, 
one of the things that can sometimes be 
confusing is the distinction between a 
value stored in a memory location and 
the address of a location. Often you'll see 
these two very different concepts thrown 
about in the same sentence or the same 
paragraph in a manner that may be be- 
wildering. 

Suffice it, we hope, to say that a mem- 
ory location is like a message box that 
can hold a single eight-bit message. The 
address is the identifying number, the 
means by which the 6502 finds its way to 
a particular box. 

6502 Takes the Bus on Memory Trips. 
The memory locations we're talking 
about are physically separate from the 
6502. They're scattered about in RAM 
and ROM chips on the motherboard of 
your Apple (actually, any given byte in 
RAM is spread out over a row of eight 
RAM chips). Within the 6502 itself are 
some other holding areas, each of eight- 
bit capacity, called registers. It is the 
registers that hold the data to be proc- 
essed by the 6502 at any given split sec- 
ond. The 6502 spends most of its waking 
life fetching data from memory, storing 
it in its registers, doing something with it, 
and shoveling it back out to memory. The 
physical connection between memory 
and the microprocessor — the path over 
which the data travels — is called a bus. 

The address of a memory location is a 
sixteen-bit quantity, which means that 
the 6502 has to look at two bytes within its 



internal registers to discern where it's 
going. If this were not the case — if ad- 
dresses were only eight bits — then the 
6502 could have only 256 addresses avail- 
able to it at any given time, since eight 
bits can be arranged to represent only 256 
unique numbers. 

The way to tell how many different 
numbers you can represent with a spec- 
ified number of bits is to take two to the 
power of the number of bits in question. 
With eight bits you get 256, since two to 
the eighth power is 256. With sixteen you 
get two to the sixteenth power, or 65,536 
— rather a sizable increase. 

A kilobyte, you'll remember, is 1,024 
bytes. If you divide 65,536 by 1,024 bytes 
per kilobyte, you arrive at 64K, which is 
the maximum addressable memory of 
the 6502. Another way to see that the 
maximum addressable memory is 64K is 
to reahze that a kilobyte is two to the 
tenth bytes ; two to the sixteenth divided 
by two to the tenth is two to the sixth (be- 
cause sixteen minus ten is six) , and two 
to the sixth is sixty-four. 

48K = 64K = 96K = 64K . . . Good 
Grief. You may have been told when you 
were shopping for your Apple that the 
maximum amount of memory you could 
put on the computer is 48K. That's true in 
a way, if by memory you mean random 
access memory; a fully configured Ap- 
ple II motherboard will hold 48K of ran- 
dom access memory. Most of the re- 
maining 16K available to the 6502 is taken 
up by the six ROM chips planted on the

motherboard between the RAM area and 
the microprocessor. Those ROMs hold 
2K apiece, so the six of them ensemble 
account for 12K. The other 4K of mem- 
ory doesn't normally reside in any kind of 
chip at all. It's devoted to the control of 
various kinds of input/output operations. 

You may also have heard about peo- 
ple putting much more than 64K on their 
Apple lis. This indeed is possible; there 
are a number of peripheral cards avail- 
able now that provide additional RAM in 
increments of 16K, 32K, 64K, or even 
more. The fact remains, however, that 
the 6502 can only look at 64K at any one 
time. The RAM cards expand memory 
by a process called bank switching, in 
which two or more areas of RAM share a 
common range of addresses. The user 
can then select, usually by way of a pro- 
gram, which bank of memory will be ac- 
tive at any given time. 

RAM cards, then, function as a kind of 
auxiliary storage device, much like a 
disk drive. They have the great advan- 
tage over a disk drive that material can 
be written into auxiliary RAM or read 
from it in an instant, without the delays 
occasioned by disk access. 

When you're running a program on 
your Apple, the 65,536 possible memory 
addresses must suffice to hold your pro- 
gram instructions, the data that is gen- 
erated or used by the program, and the 
elementary instructions that tell the com- 



^ SOPTAI 1^ 

puter how to operate. This last category 
would include such things as the system 
Monitor and the instructions that tell the 
computer how to interpret Applesoft or 
Integer Basic, depending on the species 
of Apple II. Most of this system informa- 
tion is stored permanently in ROM and 
occupies the highest 12K of addresses, 
from 53,248 to 65,535. Some of the lowest 
address space, from 0 to 2,047, is also re- 
served for system functions. 

Memories Are Made of This. Without 
going into undue detail, here's a sketch of 
the memory layout on a 48K Apple II and 
Apple II Plus: 

The top 2K, from 63,488 to 65,535, is oc- 
cupied on the Plus by the autostart ROM. 
This is the set of routines that gets your 
machine going when you turn it on. 
Among other things it puts the Apple in 
text mode, selects the keyboard and 
monitor as input and output devices, re- 
spectively, beeps the speaker, and leaves 
you in Applesoft Basic. 

On the standard Apple II, the same 
area of memory holds the Monitor ROM, 
sometimes affectionately known as the 
old Monitor ROM. The Monitor ROM per- 
forms many of the same functions as the 
autostart Rom, but it leaves you facing 
the system Monitor's asterisk prompt 
rather than putting you in Integer Basic. 

Both the Monitor ROM and the auto- 
start ROM comprise the set of routines 
known as the system Monitor — the rou-

tines that, among other things, allow you 
to examine, alter, or otherwise rear- 
range the contents of memory. 

On the Apple II Plus, the lOK directly 
below the autostart ROM, from 53,248 to 
63,487, stores the Applesoft Interpreter. 
This is the program that translates Ap- 
plesoft code into a more primitive code 
that the 6502 can execute directly. When 
you run a program written in Applesoft, 
the interpreter translates your program 
statements, line by line as they are ex- 
ecuted, into machine-level binary code. 
We'll have more to say about languages 
and interpreters in a later installment. 

Much of the same region of memory 
on the standard Apple II is occupied by 
the Integer Basic Interpreter. Integer, 
however, is a more compact language 
than Applesoft, and its interpreter re- 
quires less room in memory. The rest of 
this region on the standard Apple II in- 
cludes, among other things, the Pro- 
grammer's Aid #1. 

So far, we've accounted for the 12K 
held by the six ROM chips that sit direct- 
ly in front of the 6502 on your mother- 
board. The one all the way over on the 
left is the autostart or Monitor ROM ; the 
other five, on the Plus, are entirely dedi- 
cated to Applesoft. 

In Again, Out Again, Flnnegan. Im- 
mediately below the Applesoft Interpret- 
er is a 4K region that controls I/O func- 
tions. Among other things this part of 
memory, from 49,152 to 53,247, contains 
the so-called soft switches that deter- 
mine whether your Apple will be dis- 
playing text or graphics — or both at once. 

Below this I/O area is a vast region of 
free RAM, extending all the way from 
2,048 to 49,151. This is where your pro- 
grams and data get stored. 

Certain system functions, however, 
do intrude into this area. For example, if 
your system uses a disk drive, DOS will 
claim the top 10.5K of RAM, from 38,400 
to 49,151. Hi-res graphics are controlled 
from two functionally equivalent zones of 
memory, called the hi-res page one and 
hi-res page two. The hi-res pages take up 
8K apiece and extend from 8,192 to 16,383, 
and 16,384 to 24,575, respectively. 

On Apples with less than 48K of RAM, 
the region of memory that's not avail- 
able lies directly below 49,152. On a 32K 
system, for example, the highest avail- 
able address in RAM is 32,767. DOS, in 
this case, still claims the top 10. 5K of 
available RAM, which now includes part 
of the second hi-res page. Hence a 32K 
system will not be able to use both hi-res 
pages and DOS at the same time. 

Below the free RAM area, from 0 to 
2,047, is another 2K of memory devoted to 
system functions. The upper half of this 
area is the region of memory that con- 
trols the display of both text and lo-res 
graphics. 

We'll have a bit more to say about 
memory, and particularly about the con- 
trol of text and graphics display, in the 
next installment.

LOOKING 

hapers of the Futur 



(OHPILED W MELISSA HILKH 



There's a history in the human race and a future. And given 
the chance to look into the future, to glimpse it briefly as a land- 
scape through the windows of a speeding car, if it was there for 
the taking, wouldn't it be profound to snoop? 

The following is a compilation of almost fifty interviews 
with prominent individuals in the computer industry, busi- 
ness, and sciences. They were asked to predict what would be 
in store for us five, ten, fifty, even a hundred or more years 
from now. Editorially, these are just predictions. Realistical- 
ly, they are just a little bit more. 

The future is taken seriously by those in the computer in- 
dustry, whose job, in essence, is to program the future. Of 
course, their predictions might sound just like "predictions," 
way too wild to ever come true. But remember, these people 
support themselves by coming up with what are oftentimes 
considered very unusual ideas. 

Thus, something curious journalistically took place with 
this story. As these fifty made their predictions, we began to 
wonder whether their ideas were truly predictions or whether

they were giving us a clue to what they, as individuals, would 
be working on in the future — or are working on even now. Of 
course, these robotics experts, software publishers, and indus- 
try giants, couldn't give out their secret plans, but ... in the 
guise of an innocent predictions story? 

So what can we expect in the future? How about automatic 
transport between New York and California in five seconds . . . 
robots preparing our dinner . . . conversation with the micro- 
electronic reincarnation of William Shakespeare, Thomas 
Jefferson, even Marilyn Monroe? Or maybe a pollution-free 
world? 

Some people out there probably like these ideas enough to 
make them a reality. And when we hear someone like Owen 
Garriott, Skylab astronaut, making predictions about outer 
space, it's hard not to take him seriously. After all, he's been 
there. 

All of our futurists-for-a-day contributed enthusiastical- 
ly—some predictions were philosophical, others frivoloios, a few 
scary. No restrictions were placed on the type of material we so- 
licited. People didn't even have to talk about computers if they 
wished. But decide for yovirself which is imagination and which is, 
omigosh, tomorrow. 

People are working on it. Anything is possible. 



very hi-res, high-speed technology, we'll be able to make exact 
representations of characters— their appearance, their voices, 
their actions, their philosophies, their emotions, their per- 
sonalities. We'll insert every bit of information we know about 
Abe Lincoln, Socrates, Katherine the Great— whoever you 
want — and then, in the form of a movie, we'll be able to wit- 
ness conversations among them. Just think about it. What 
would Shakespeare say to Romeo and Juliet? What would hap- 
pen if you put John F. Kennedy at a restaurant table with Adolf 
Hitler? (Okay, then, with Marilyn Monroe.) This is an exten- 
sion of what Walt Disney has been doing for years. But the po- 
tential for misuse is truly great. We obviously can't set these 
digitally processed people loose on the world. This will be sole- 
ly for entertainment and education, and I predict we'll be doing 
it, in a crude way, before the end of the decade."

"In fifty years there's going to be an ERA for computers. 
That's going to have all sorts of impact. Computers are going 
to be paid the same amount as humans for the same amount of 
work — and since they work faster than us, computers will be 
millionaires. Computers will also start requesting paid vaca- 
tions. They'll be just like people and then we'll have to start all 
over again and invent something that will take their place."

"Within one hundred years we'll no longer be human beings. 
Microcomputers the size of a thumbnail will be Implanted in 
our bodies, probably in the medulla region of the brain. This 
will provide a second brain to access. By definition we're going 
to cease to be a biological organism. We'll be a biological/me- 
chanical organism — cybernetic to a degree. I'm not saying 
we'll have a second personality, an electric personality, but 
who can tell? An electrical interaction will interface our or- 
ganic brain to our electronic brain. We'll be able to communi- 
cate with others somewhat telepathlcally through our elec- 
tronic brains, which will relay information instantly to our 
organic brains. This will take the place of telephones. As a matter 
of fact, videophones will be a joke compared to this. People who 
don't have computers transplanted in their brains will be outcasts 
from society. It will probably be people in the back-to-nature 
movement who resist this technological invasion of their biologi- 
cal bodies. These "puries" will be ostracized by the majority of the 
society who have consented to these transplants. Puries will be un- 
able to get jobs and be forced to live in isolated societies."

"People will not be able to survive without computers. Kids 
will not be able to get through school without computers. The 
academic system is getting more and more competitive. I see 
this in my son's elementary school where the kids are re- 
quired to learn about computers. This year one of the schools 
in the district closed, and they transferred all the children from 
that school that didn't have computers to the school my son at- 
tends. Needless to say, the kids that have been learning on 
computers all along seemed to be a lot more advanced than 
those kids from the old school. It took a while for the new kids 
to catch up just in the sense of being able to run the computer. 
My son is in first grade and he is already learning program- 
ming. I predict he's going to be so smart by the time he gets out 
of high school, after spending all those years on a computer, 
that I probably won't be able to talk to him."

"There will be a new renaissance in thinking. Since computers 
will be taking care of all our manual and menial tasks, people 
will be a lot more free just to think. There will be a luxury class 
of deep thinkers in the tradition of Aristotle and Socrates. But 
then again, if people do have all this free time, maybe they'll 
just play and follow the tradition of the Romans instead."

"The entire educational system will radically change. Class- 
rooms won't look anj^hing like they do now. People will be tak- 
ing lessons at home and attending college classes at home via 
computers. We are moving toward a technology-based so- 
ciety, where performance and not degrees is important. Cer- 
tification will probably become meaningless, and, to get a job, 
people will probably have to show what projects they've com- 
pleted, rather than the schools they've attended." 

Craig Vaughan

"Paper is going to disappear, since we probably won't need it. 
We're going to learn a less paper-oriented way of doing busi- 
ness with computers. Doctors will record medical histories on 
a computer, the military will plan strategies on a computer. In- 
stead of doodling with a pen and paper, people are going to 
learn to doodle on a computer. The amount of paper wasted by 
business is ridiculous. Computers are going to save trees, and 
they'll save all the energy that was put into producing paper. 
With care and forethought we can enhance our environment. 
There'll also be a raising of computer consciousness. People 
are going to feel as naked without a computer as they do without a 
calculator." 

Terry Bradley

"We're going to evolve from a mobile society to an immobile 
society. We won't be able to afford to pay somebody enough to 
drive to and from work, since gasoline will probably cost three 
hiHidred dollars a gallon. So, many jobs will be done at home 
with people tied in to their work places by a computer. And 
since gasoline is going to be so expensive and people will still 
want to travel occasionally to another part of the country, we 
will develop an automatic transport system, like on Star Trek 
when they say, "Beam me up, Scotty." I think in the future I'll 
be able to throw a watch on the ground and stomp on it and end 
up in New York. Of course, then we''ll have to invent a replace- 
ment for the watch."

"Here's one people aren't going to like. In twenty years, we're

"People are going to have to learn to cope with the changes 
that are happening so quickly now in our lifestyles. I see some 
problems ahead. I see kids starting to relate with computers, 
but they're not learning to cope with people. That's a fault of 
our school system. People are saying computers are the great- 
est thing since sliced cheese, but we're going to have to tem- 
per our computer involvement with human interaction."

"I specialized in biomedical engineering in college and I can 
foresee computers programmed to do operations, computer- 
ized hearts, and special technology that can clean up clogged 
arteries. At a medical conference I attended recently, they 
mentioned that the average life span of a human being has 
climbed from seventy to eighty years old. In the future, with 
medical breakthroughs that will wipe out the major diseases, I 
don't think it will be impossible for someone to live one hun- 
dred forty years. Everybody will stay healthy, so we can boost 
the retirement age to eighty or ninety years old."

"Sociologically there will be a big shift. Instead of moving

be assigned all the menial jobs, so humans can devote them- 
selves to all service- and knowledge-related industry." 

Jim Tennyson 

Advanced Business Technology (Saratoga, CA) 
"Computers will humanize our society, by keeping elaborate 
records on each individual. People have a fear of being num- 
bered and tracked, but I see this as being to our advantage. It'll 
be a huge version of Who's Who that we can plug into. Suppose 
you like to ride bicycles. You can ask your computer if there 
are other people in your neighborhood who share yovir inter- 
est ; and the computer will tell you about the guy that lives two 
blocks away who owns six bicycles. We can become more 
known to one another and this will strengthen relationships 
among each other."

to sit back and let it run its course."

"I think we're almost beyond The Jetsons. Remember how 
George Jetson used to come home and complain to 'Jane his

pushing finger really hurt? Well, we're reaching the point 
where we won't have to punch buttons on our computer. We'll 
be able to program the computers by voice — tell it what you'd 
like to do and it'll do it. The computer will write its own pro-

"The architecture of the future will be designed with robots in 
mind. Robots will be patrolling the streets, doing the grocery 
shopping, and cleaning the home. I'm working with a com- 
pany on the design of a robot now. Ours will be able to plug it- 
self in, wash floors and windows, and not trip over the dog."

"It will be commonplace to rent time on a robot. In order to 
work in hazardous climates, such as under the ocean or in 
outer space, people will be able to climb into a body suit that 
will control a robot anywhere in the universe ; you'll be able to 
control the robot's actions. From the safety of your own home, 
you'll be able to project yourself into outer space and experi- 
ence the sensation of being there."

Edu-Ware Services (Canoga Park, CA) 
"Computer and holographic technology, coupled with other 
display technology, will make it possible to visualize your own 
environments for your own entertainment. Somewhat in the 
tradition of television's Fantasy Island, people will be able to 
generate their own world — using a computer. It will be a total- 
ly created environment that you can smell, hear, taste, see, 
touch. These total environments will be much like Fantasy- 
land and Adventureland at Disneyland, but to a much larger 
degree. If someone wants to be a big-game hunter, we can es- 
sentially create an African veldt, complete with attacking lions 
and elephants. Of course the jungle won't be real, but it will be 
too realistic to be able to tell the difference easily. This is do- 
able in the next twenty years; it's doable now, but it would be 
extremely expensive." 




Doug Carlston 



This is an intriguing field, because you can be anywhere from 
ten to ninety years old and rob a bank from the comfort of your 
own home. There's a subtle respect for people going into com- 
puter crime — when they get caught, they usually are hired by 
the business they robbed in the first place. You have to be pret- 
ty intelligent to be a computer criminal. In addition, the world 
is going to be less violent because of computer crimes. F'irst of 
all, they keep the dangerous element off the streets since most 
of them will want to stay at home to do illegal things with their 
home computers. No one usually gets hurt when a computer 
robbery is committed, nobody's dignity is harmed, just a few 
zeroes get transferred from a memory bank.

"The next generation will provide a significant change in the 
attitude of women toward computers. Unfortunately, today's 
women are still afraid of computers because they haven't 
given themselves a chance to enjoy them. Tomorrow's home- 
maker will teach her children the ABCs with a keyboard and 
color graphics and sound. Then while the baby naps she'll be 
using her ABCs teaching machine to access a data base for the 
latest developments in child care or stock market trends, or 
dialing into her work computer to finish the programming 
project she's working on, or writing a book on her desktop 
word processor, or composing music, or updating the house- 
hold budget with her custom-designed financial model, or play- 
ing adventure games for relaxation and intellectual stimula- 
tion. All of the above is available to her now, but she'd rather 
have a new couch than a personal computer. Up the road, 
she'll pass up the new couch for a desk in the kitchen so she can 
conduct business and cook a roast without missing a beat. 

Young people are now being exposed to computers as a part 
of everyday life. Traditionally in school, girls are good in En- 
glish, picking up on foreign languages, and math. All these sub- 
jects are quite useful in the computer age. Logic has been 
something reserved for the male gender, but that's becoming 
poppycock. Women have great potential that today is often left 
untapped."

Amdek's new Color-ll monitor with DVM interface board 



No video monitor has ever combined Apple II compati- 
bility with exceptional performance like the new 13" 
Color-ll monitor from Amdek. 

Color-ll features our optional new DVM peripheral board 
for easy interfacing with your Apple II. And look at the 
other top-of-the-line features Color-ll offers: 

• RGB, TTL input for high resolution graphics. 

• 80 X 24 character display capability (with expansion 
card by Vydec). 

• 560 (H) X 260 (V) resolution. 

• Molded-in carrying handle for easier portability. 

• Front-mounted controls for faster fine-tuning. 

So if you want to get the most from your Apple II 
system, get the "most" monitor. Ask your dealer about 
Amdek's new Color-ll monitor with the optional DVM 
interface board. 



What is DVM? The DVM, or "Digital Video Multiplexor," 
is a low cost interface that allows the Apple It computer 
to be used with an RGB monitor, such as our Color-ll. 
Amdek's DVM is software programmable to allow trans- 
parent operation, and is parallel with existing Apple 
text and graphic modes. Three of its channels are used to 
multiplex the existing Apple text, low resolution and high 
resolution graphics. The 4th channel allows the use of an 
80 character line video board. 

Our DVM is also color channel software programmable, 
enabling you to turn the three color channels on or off 
by software control. For example, the red and blue 
channel can be turned off when the 80 character 
channel is turned on, resulting in a green phosphor 
video presentation. 

For convenient operation, the DVM board may occupy 
any slot in the Apple II. The DVM also features low-power 
consumption and low-power schottky logic.

"In the future, people are going to be spending all their extra

big programmers like Silas Warner and Bill Budge are going 
to be the superstars of the eighties. They're going to share the

"I see man as becoming a great big fat lump of coal. I was in a 
pre-med program in college and I still look at things from an 
evolutionary standpoint. As we evolve as a species, parts of our 
bodies we don't use drop off or become smaller in size. In the 
future, computers are going to be doing all the hard work and 
all the running around — any physical activity imaginable. 
Things we don't need like our arms and legs are going to dis- 
appear and we are going to evolve into one big head, one big 
brain mass. We'll have no physical activity, sex will be re- 
duced to nothing. God knows how we'll reproduce. But the fit- 
test in our future society will be the smartest people with the 
biggest brains — that's the law of natural selection. I think they 
had a program on Star Trek once on this very subject. A big 
bowling ball shape was controlling an entire planet."

easily linked by communication devices, and interaction with 
other humans anywhere in the world will be as easy as turning 
on a television. The isolating effects of computers that every-

one thing I'd really like to see is gaming with multiple house-

You live in a smaii town in the 14th century. You were' 
awalcened this morning by a terribie pain in your arm. Upon exr 
amining your arm, you find a bioody gash in it. Wiseiy you cover 
it so that nobody wiil see it. Later, you find that the townspeople 
had seen a werewolf last night and one person had shot an ar- 
row at it, but evidently he had missed, because the werewolf 
continued running. You instantly deduce that you must have 
been the werewolf and realize that you must find an antidote. 

You decide to go to a nearby dungeon that is deserted. 
Legend says that a powerful wizard, Evro, once lived there, but 
he became a victim of his own experiments. The rumor is that he 
had strange and deadly creatures under his power. You decide 



that you might be able to find some sort of recipe for a potion to 
cure your affliction. 

Unfortunately, it is right around the time of the full moon, 
and you know that you will almost certainly become a werewolf 
tonight again. In fact, the moon rises tonight at exactly mid- 
night, which has always had a mystical aura about it. You arm 
yourself with a fine sword and a full lantern and set off in search 
of the dungeon. After finding the ruins which used to be Evro's 
castle you look for some sort of entrance, such as a stairway. 

While searching, the ground suddenly gives way under you.

memory expansion board. Once DOS is 
relocated, an additional 10,700 bytes becomes 
available for your use (Imagine! A 75K APPLE). 
DOS is still active but it no longer takes up 
precious memory. Now you can use that extra 
memory to run or develop larger APPLESOFT or 
machine language programs, store more infor-

MMS][ also works great with EXPEDITER II to 
help compensate for any memory you might 
lose after compiling. 

MMS][ is designed to become the boot

"This could be a gross understatement of the effects comput-

imagination in the next two to three years. But I truly expect 
within the next twenty years we'll have totally controlled liv- 
ing environments. Virtually everything will be integrated into 
a total system. It'll be quite the norm when a new nice house, 
not a tract home, is built, for it to be totally equipped with com- 
puters. Conceivably, these computers can be tied into a larger 
network, enabling the entire house to be monitored by the fire

what the 78 RPM phonograph is to us now. Also, by then, com- 
puters should be thinking in terms of complete pictures as the 
human brain does. They'll know and understand their owners 
so much better that way. Ninety percent of all computers will 
probably be hooked up to cable television. Now imagine this : 
Suppose the owner is away from the house one night. Well, the 
computer will have kept track of the television programs he 
missed, maybe an old detective movie of the kind of which the 
owner is a real fan. The next morning, when the owner stum- 
bles down to breakfast, the computer will greet him with some- 
thing like, "Good morning. Boy, do I have a treat for you. I 
have saved an old detective movie that you missed when you 
went out on the town last night." With the proper program- 
ming a computer will be able to sort something like that out."

One of the more thankless profes- 
sions now extant may be the retailing of 
personal computers. Consider the plight 
of the hapless retailer who stocked up on 
Paper Tiger printers just in time to see 
Epson hit the marketplace. Or contem- 
plate the woes of the merchant who re- 
ceived his shipment of thirty Star Cruis- 
ers in the same mail as the demo of Ap- 
ple Galaxian. 

Even the knowledgeable, conscienti- 
ous retailer can be whipsawed by mar- 
ketplace forces beyond his control. Wit- 
ness last year's holiday season debacle, 
when all of Apple took two weeks off, 
leaving the retail trade with an inad- 
equate supply of Apples to get through 
the Christmas season and into January. 

A Motley Crew. It's been difficult to 



assess either the triumphs or the tribula- 
tions of the personal computer retailing 
trade with any degree of accuracy be- 
cause there has seldom been a more dis- 
crete group gathered in the same branch 
of commerce than you find in this one. 

Some retailers can, and at the drop of 
a hat will, discuss with a prospective cus- 
tomer the difference in nanoseconds in 
the response times of the 6502s found in 
the Apple and Atari personal computers. 
Obviously, these owners had a strong 
grounding in computers and computer 
science prior to the development of the 
personal computer. 

Other merchants have a vague idea of 
where the power switch lies, although 
they're more likely than not to go for the 
power light. These are the businessmen 



who have seen the commercial power of 
the personal computer and jumped in for 
the ride, although their own expertise 
may be limited to the simpler functions 
on a hand-held calculator. 

A third group of sellers are those who 
have bought a personal computer, found 
it opened new vistas hitherto un- 
imagined, and decided that some com- 
mercial involvement in this new indus- 
try and with this new equipment was a 
must. Not being experts in either hard- 
ware or software, members of this group 
have always found selling the path of 
least resistance. 

It's interesting to note that each of 
these groups coped with the problems of 
communicating with customers by using 
their own specially developed language.

The computerniks speak in basic com- 
puterese, dropping in technical jargon at 
every conversational turn. The business- 
man speaks to his customer in basic lay- 
man, eschewing all words that might 
even hint at something technical. The 
hobbyist group speaks advanced lay- 
man, which metaphorically means the 
addition of bells and whistles to the basic 
version. 

Quick Study Required. While the pit- 
falls facing each group varied, make no 
mistake that each group has needed to 
learn a lot in a hurry to stay in business. 
The computerniks have had to learn to 
adjust their pitch to the lower level of ex- 
pertise of the computer newcomer. The 
businessmen have needed, at the very 
least, to learn the importance of various 



amounts of memory and the implica- 
tions thereof. The hobbyists probably 
were closest to speaking the right lan- 
guage but needed to learn some business 
fundamentals to survive. 

If you doubt the vicissitudes of the 
marketplace, even in growth periods of 
such growth industries as the personal 
computer market, just look in the yellow 
pages in any major metropolitan area for 
any two consecutive years and note the 
drastic change in entries. There may be 
as many or more stores listed, but the list 
will be radically different in terms of 
which stores are listed. In late 1979 in the 
San Fernando Valley in southern Cali- 
fornia, an area of about 1.5 million per- 
sons, more than half of the computer 
stores listed in the yellow pages pub-

lished in March 1979 had gone belly up. 
That's a fact that would give even the 
foolhardy pause for thought. 

The personal computer industry has 
been growing at such a rapid rate that 
there has never been established a real 
selling season in which results will def- 
initely outstrip the rest of the year. Each 
month, there are respondents to the Sof- 
talk bestseller poll who report their best 
month in history. Regardless of that cav- 
eat, the Christmas season remains the 
consistently strongest period. It spans 
November, December, and January and 
offers real opportunity for the business- 
man to close out one year and start the 
next in a big way. 

Leaders Emerge. In the three years 
that personal computer marketing has 
been estabhshed as its own unique brand 
of retailing, a handful of retailers have 
emerged as the trendsetters in the indus- 
try. These are the folks who assess each 
package on its merits, giving thoughtful 
and conscientious consideration to new 
software and hardware products as they 
become available and providing impetus 
for the makers of those new products that 
are found exceptional. 

Without exception, these trendsetters 
exist in metropolitan areas where there 
are dense populations of personal com- 
puters. It isn't so much that the metro- 
politan retailers are more intelligent or 
more conscientious, but they did get a 
head start on their country cousins and 




when they act, it makes a greater im- 
pact on the marketplace. 

One of the retailers who was an early 
trendsetter was Jim Sadlier at Comput- 
erland of South Bay in Lawndale, Cali- 
fornia. Now he relies heavily on the judg- 
ment of Softsel as to which new products 
to stock, but in the early days, one of the 
keys to success was the accurate evalua- 
tion of new software as it became avail- 
able. 

Most southern Califomians have a 



DECEMBER 1981 



tendency to supplant the first letter in 
Lawndale with a Y to epitomize all the 
excitement that Los Angeles suburb of- 
fers. But the location was exactly right 
for a computer store. It sits on Haw- 
thorne Boulevard, one of the most heav- 
ily traveled streets in the country, and is 
centered among wealthy suburbs such as 
Palos Verdes Estates. Also in the imme- 
diate vicinity are industrial parks and 
high technology firms such as TRW and 
Northrop. 

To say that the location was a natural 
understates its potential. It's now the cen- 
ter of a computer store row that finds be- 
tween fifteen and twenty stores in a 
three-mile radius. That Computerland of 
South Bay has survived the competition 
is a testimony to the acumen of Sadlier in 
negotiating the shoals of merchandising 
in a sea of discounters. 

The Vision To Recognize the Future. 
While Sadlier fits the description of those 
retailers who come from the business 
world and speak basic layman, his fun- 
damental grounding in business has al- 
lowed him to overcome his lack of tech- 
nical expertise. That experience in- 
cludes time holding a seat on the Ameri- 
can Stock Exchange as a partner in a 
small brokerage house ; he also served a 
term in Merrill Lynch's institutional 
sales department, which is where he first 
became aware of the personal computer 
industry. 

Commodore and its Pet line of prod- 
ucts came to his attention. He visited the 
company to research its investment po- 
tential for Merrill Lynch clients and 
came away convinced that he had seen a 
harbinger of the industry of the eighties. 

This was 1977, and though Sadlier had 
a strong grasp of business and finance, 
he lacked computer knowledge — to this 
day, when the conversation turns to gotos 
and gets, he disclaims any expertise. But 
Computerland was then beginning an ag- 
gressive push to add franchisees; their 
computer expertise meshed well with 
Sadlier's finance and business prowess. 

He was the fourth Computerland in 
southern CaUfomia, following a now de- 
funct West Los Angeles store on La Cien- 
ega Boulevard and stores in Tustin and 
San Diego. 

Sadlier was in the business early 
enough to have seen distinct market- 
place shifts. In the beginning, there was 
the supermarket approach of handling 
everything available. Computerland was 
carrying Amsai, Northstar, and Cro- 
memco as well as an Apple II without 
disk drives. 

The market soon shifted to an em- 
phasis on the lower- priced Apple, which 
was attracting members of the technical 
community as well as the hobbyist. To- 
day, the hobbyist market in southern 
California seems about tapped. Most of 
the sales are to small business, a statis- 
tic that Sadlier believes reflects the large 
quantity of high quality applications soft-

If Janek Kaliczak seems enthusiastic about his computer, it 
is not without reason. He has the largest Apple in the world. 

It's hard to get Kaliczak to talk about anything but his Ap- 
ple. It's not as though he has nothing else to talk about. The 
techniques he used for designing the projection patterns for the 
television version of Cosmos would be interesting enough. He 
could probably intrigue people by revealing how he designed 
lighting for MCA Universal Tour attractions like Castle 
Dracula, the Special Effects Sound Stage, Airport 77 Screen 
Test Theater, and Dracula's Stakehouse and Womphopper's 
restaurants. It would be fun to hear him talk about special ef- 
fects for the movies he's done, like Hangar 18 or GaUiaina, or 
about how he helped with the first geodesic dome projects and 
conferences in the late sixties. But Kaliczak would rather talk 
about CP/M. 

Kaliczak has designed multimedia systems of lights and 
slide and movie projectors for churches and auditoriums. He's 
designed lighting for film and stage, Disneyland, the Holly- 
wood Bowl, and the Greek Theater. Concert performers of 
genres from ballet to rock 'n' roll have benefited from Kali- 
czak's talent, including Leonard Bernstein, Carole King, and 
Supertramp. But, to Kahczak, one of the most exciting things 
to happen in the last few months is the introduction of a 256K 
App-L-Cache card that will triple his retrieval speed and quin- 
tuple his memory. 

How do we know Kaliczak's claim to fame is true? How 
does he know for sure that he has the world's largest Apple? 
"You know anybody who's got a bigger setup?" Kaliczak re- 
plies, waving his hand over the ribbons of spaghetti that con- 
nect his system's components. You have to admit, you don't 
see something like that every day. 

Modest Milieu. Kaliczak's office in the Mount Washington 
area of Los Angeles doesn't have the same impact as the stage 



sets he designed. There are no spacemen hiding in the shrubs 
waiting to zap you with a rainbow of lasers. And the beautiful 
starlight covering overhead isn't even a projection; those are 
real stars up there. There's not even a wide-mouthed shark to 
pop out of the ivy and scare the nightlights out of you. Just a 
long climb up the stone steps to the door where two friendly 
dogs wait to greet you. 

There's likely to be a friend sitting on the sofa as you walk 
down the long hallway and into the kitchen where Kaliczak's 
mother is preparing dinner for the dogs. 

"He treats them better than he treats me," she says. 

Hang a left from the kitchen, and there you be, standing in 
the doorway of the lifestyle of the future: the electronic 
cottage— home and office of Janek Kaliczak, lighting designer 
and consultant. 

Kaliczak moves quickly from one set of shelving to another. 
He pulls a box of eight-inch floppy disks from beneath the con- 
sole, then reaches up to his left for the five-inch disks. He puts 
them in their respective drives and stretches out to grab one of 
the project specification notebooks from overhead. 

He boots up a graphics program and turns around to focus 
the video camera that sits on the drafting table behind him. He 
adjusts the drawing below the camera, then checks the color 
monitor to see if he's got the composition he wants. "Okay, that 
looks pretty good. Let's save it." Kaliczak hits several keys on 
his Apple and the red light on the disk drive goes on. 

Kaliczak's office looks like a cross between a library 
reference room, an engineer's design quarters, and a film lab. 
He is surrounded by walls of notebooks and files. Behind him 
stands a drafting table strewn with theater blueprints and 
scrolls of drafting sheets. Sketchbooks lie open, revealing 
drawings of light fixtures, cabinets, and schedules. Overhead a 
row of half a dozen floodlights beam down on the drafting table 
and heat up the room. And snuggled in the comer opposite the 
table is Kaliczak's pride, his tool, and his toy. 



The system takes up most of the desk space in front of him. 
On top of two five-inch drives sits a black and white monitor 
with a blue-green lighting gel taped across the front to cut 
down on glare. Beside it stands the unit containing the two 
eight-inch drives. To the left is the color monitor with a control 
panel between the two monitors so that KaUczak doesn't have 
to reach around back of the Apple to boot the system. 

Anyone for Pinochle? Below the drives and monitors, sit- 
ting on the desk like an overstuffed turkey, is an Apple chassis 
so full of cards and interfaces that it takes an extra power sup- 
ply to keep it from blowing its noodles. The modified chassis 
has plugs and adaptors sticking out the side with wire cables 
snaking along to the various components. KaUczak 's Apple can 
do just about everything except keep a friendly dog out of the 
room. 

Anya, representative of that very breed, ambles up to 
Kaliczak's chair to rub her nose against his elbow. But no furry 
beast is tolerated in this sanctuary for long. 

"Out," he says. "Get out." Anya shuffles away with her tail 
between her legs. "I don't want your hair in my disk drives." 
He smiles apologetically, not Hking to be harsh with the affec- 
tionate animal. "She's shedding. So anyway," he says, "you 
have to have a look inside." 

Kaliczak takes the lid off his Apple II Plus to reveal a cir- 
cuit board full of cards. 

"I bet you've never seen anything like that. Look at this. 
I've got a 16K RAM card and language system, an I/O serial 
parallel clock card, an IDS-460 printer. Here's the phone 
modem and an eighty by twenty-four video card, a SoftCard 
and a disk controller card connected to two eight-inch Shugart 
drives and a chassis power supply. Over here I've got two five- 
inch Apple drives and. ..." 

As if all that weren't enough to drain the juice out of an Ap- 
ple, in slot eight Kaliczak's got an expansion interface that con- 
nects to the big box just to the left of the computer. What's in 



that box? Eight more slots for cards to hook up to the main 
chassis. There's an arithmetic AM-9511 card that Kaliczak 
built himself. There's a hi-res light pen and a video digitizer 
card with a 12K EPROM card next door. He's got a bit pad in- 
terface for a graphics tablet, an EPROM programmer, and an 
NTSC interface card that gives 280-by-240 hi-res in sixteen 
colors with two levels of grey on a full screen and ... an empty 
slot. He must have run out of cards. 

"No, that's for my peripherals," says Kaliczak, pulling out 
a box containing thirteen more computer cards. 

All over Again. "Then there's my other system in the living 
room." He calls the living room setup system two. Kaliczak's 
wife Irene uses system two to do the book work for his con- 
sulting business. It also has four drives and various 
peripherals — but no expansion chassis. Irene says she bought 
the second Apple for herself. 

"I bought the other Apple because I couldn't get access to 
this one," she says nodding at system one. "Now I can't get ac- 
cess to either one." 

Both systems are up most of the day. When Kaliczak runs 
across a problem that he needs to let sit for a while, he goes to 
work on the other system. One thing is certain; Kaliczak puts 
in a lot of time at the keyboard. 

"The new production system," says Alvin Toffler in the 
Third Wave, "could shift literally millions of jobs out of the fac- 
tories and offices . . . right back to where they came from 
originally: the home." Kaliczak is already living Toffler's 
prophecy. He spends twenty hours of his workweek in his home 
office and the rest on location. The computer has freed up time 
so that Kaliczak can work on four or five projects at a time 
where before it would be tough to handle more than one. When 
he tires of one project, he pulls out the disk and works on 
another for a while. 

Tooling Along. As a consultant, Kaliczak explains, he is a 
tool fanatic. "You have to be. You always have to be looking 



152 ^ SQPTALK DECEMBER 1981 



out for the client's best interest. I have to be good. I have to 
produce the best lighting design possible. Not only that, I have 
to convince my client that my design is the best. If he doesn't 
buy it, then it's not the best." 

Kaliczak uses the computer as a laborsaving device to do 
planning and word processing. He has to redo a lot of work, 
both schedules and drawings. "A drawing is never final. I may 
have to revise it ten times. I am always rearranging, adding 
new lights to the setup. All that revision means a lot of 
paperwork. I used to spend hours at the typewriter typing over 
an entire set of plans just because I changed one light. I either 
need an elaborate set of tools, or I have to hire a large support 
staff. With a computer I have more control." 

At night, Kaliczak receives visits from experts in various 
fields. Music or sound designers come to talk about projects or 
maybe just about computers. One minute Kaliczak might be 
talking to a headhunter for the electronics industry, the next 
with someone designing promotional computer graphics for 
the Apple III. But Kaliczak's contact is not limited to those who 
drop by. He often sends and receives information from other 
consultants over his modem. Or you might just find him calling 
up computer bulletin boards around the country picking up 
free CP/M programs or looking for equipment he can use. 

"I think CP/M is going to take over," he says. "It's so much 
easier to use." Kaliczak ties into two networks that distribute 
CP/M programs at no charge to user groups. All programs are 
donated by the users themselves and the material donated 
becomes public domain. The object of the networks is to 
spread the operating system around so that more people start 
to use it. 

A Proselyte. Tonight one of the people who is visiting Kalic- 
zak is another lighting designer, Darryl Palagi. Although 
Palagi is here largely by accident — his car broke down, leav- 
ing him without transportation— he's taking the opportunity to 
benefit from some of Kaliczak's extensive design experience. 

Palagi has done most of his lighting work with rock 'n' roll 
tours. Lately, he's been getting into a field he calls theme park 
design. Kaliczak has much more experience with theme park 
projects like the Universal Tour attractions. 

"This is a whole new design concept," Palagi explains. "In 
the past, most lighting work has been done in theaters or audi- 
toriums where the whole lighting system is already installed. 
In a theme park, you have to deal with more architectural 
problems. You have to install everything from control panels 
and cables to the fixtures that hold the lights. You have to do all 
that as well as decide where you want the light to fall and what 
effect you want. You've got a show that's performed hundreds 



of times a day before thousands of people. That requires an en- 
tirely different design than a theater. 

Lighting design is more complicated than one would 
suspect. There are sketches to be made. In a theme park pro- 
ject, the architectural structure must be designed. Schedules 
and blueprints must be drawn, indicating where lights are to 
be placed and the type of light and cable required. Plans and 
specifications are finally turned over to the master electrician, 
who installs the system. Standardized forms facilitate com- 
munication between designer and electrician. In fact, the field 
of lighting has developed its own language and protocol. 

"An electricians' schedule. " explains Palagi, "is something 
you can take down to any theater from the Mark Taper Forum 
to the Greek Theater and the master electrician there will be 
able to read it and know what you're talking about." 

Almost half of Kaliczak's work involves planning. Because 
he believes in putting all plans into writing, he finds the word 
processor invaluable. He thought that this use of the computer 
might also help Palagi in his work, so tonight Palagi gets his 
first look at the word processor at work. Until now, he'd only 
seen its achievements. 

"First you have to set the tabs where you want them. We'll 
use six. Now the first column is the dimmer, then we have the 
control, followed by the light number. . . ." Thus the lesson 
begins. 

The electricians' schedule is a standard lighting design 
form that has been used in theaters for more than seventy 
years. It tells the master electrician where to install the lights, 
what switches to hook them up to, the type of cables to use, the 
routing of the cables, and the area the lights will be focused on. 
The light numbers correspond to switches on the panel that 
control various lights. 

Palagi shakes his head as he watches Kaliczak work his 
magic. Kaliczak decides to change headings and move them 
around to get a better layout for the form. 

"You mean you can just move a whole line over like that?" 
asks Palagi. 

"That's nothing. Suppose you want to change a word; you 
just wipe it out." Kaliczak strikes a few keys. "You want to 
change a light number? No problem. Just wipe out the old one 
ajfid retype. How 'bout that? Also, you can print out blank 
forms so that you can pencil the information in on the first 
draft and then type it later." 

"Geez," says Palagi, "this is so hot it gives me chills." 

Coordinating Many Tasks. It's a feeling many people get 
the first time they see what a word processor can do for edit- 
ing. But the electricians' schedule poses some particular prob-

lems; these too are almost eliminated by the computer. 

"The way we used to do it," says Palagi, "you'd have a 
diagram that would say 'pipe one with lights one through eight' 
on it. Then you'd have pipe two with another set of lights — 
maybe one through ten. If you decided that you wanted to add 
one more light, you'd have to draw up a whole new electri- 
cians' schedule and a whole new cue sheet because the lights 
would have to be in order on the sheet. Each sheet took about 
three hours. And usually you have to make four or five revi- 
sions on a project." 

But now, if a change in the lighting setup is required, the 
corrections can be made on the word processor, and a new set 
of sheets printed. Since four or five copies of the schedules are 
necessary for the different people involved, print-outs save a 
lot of time. 

But Kaliczak and Palagi know from experience that it's 
hard to get designers and electricians to accept the new com- 
puter printed form. Often houses have their own forms that 
light consultants are required to use. It will take time to con- 
vince people in-house that it will be to their advantage to use 
the computer, but with some talking, it can be done. 

The traditional working arrangements in lighting design in- 
volve three primary people: the lighting designer, an assis- 
tant, and a master electrician. The lighting designer decides 
the effects required, and where to place the lights. The infor- 
mation is conveyed to the assistant who draws up the 
paperwork and revises whatever forms are necessary. The 
design specifications are then given to the master electrician, 
who solves the technical problems of installing the system. 

Kaliczak's degree in civil engineering and television gives 
him more latitude than most lighting designers. Because he 
knows the technical side of electronics so well, he is highly 
respected by the electricians he works with. He is sympathetic 
toward the needs of those who'll be installing the system he 
designs. Consequently, he's given a lot of freedom that 
wouldn't be given other designers. Electricians know they can 
trust him. 

I Palagi thinks Kaliczak is ahead of his time. 

! "I think what Janek is doing is evolutionary. I don't know of 

' anybody else who is using computer-generated planning 
material in lighting. It really helps, especially in California 
where you don't have the elaborate stage facilities that they 
have in New York. I think you'll find that as more people are 
exposed to the concept, it will change the whole industry." 

The evolutionary idea parallels the impact that the musical 
arrangements in the Beatles' "Sergeant Pepper" album had 
on the theater. "A lot of us heard that album and thought 'My 
God, we've got to do something like that.' The more you work 
on a new idea, the more you find other people who have been 
affected by it as well. From the new concepts in 'Sergeant Pep- 
per,' you see similar techniques emerge in lighting and stage 
design resulting in projects like Hair." 

Just as radical changes in music affected theater, changes 
in planning for lighting will affect other design areas. 

j "There's no limit to the applications," says Palagi. 

' Where Do We Go from Here? An acoustic designer who 
stopped by to see Kaliczak explained that lights were now be- 
ing installed in speaker cabinets and used to find where sound 
would project in auditoriums. "There are so many similarities 
between light and sound anyway," said Palagi. "I think pretty 
soon computers will be used in all types of design. Computer- 
generated design is already used in some rock shows. All light- 
ing effects are preprogrammed. It really screws things up 
though if the group comes back for an encore." 

This won't be the first impact that computers have had on 
the lighting industry. The light pallet, introduced about three 
years ago, changed lighting technology. A light pallet contains 
all the information for lighting cues- on a floppy disk. Where 
formerly lighting technicians controlled all dimming effects 
and light changes by manual switches, the light pallet made it 
possible to program all changes in lighting so that hitting a go 
button at the proper cue would take care of the whole show. 

i The computer would automatically turn on and off the ap- 



propriate switches and dim lights at a preprogrammed rate. 
Chorus Line was the first stage production to use a light pallet 
successfully. Since then pallets have become increasingly pop- 
ular. 

A lot of union problems sprang up when widespread use of 
the light pallet began to change jobs in, the lighting field. The 
problems were mostly with job security. Lighting experts had 
to become computer programmers. The pallets almost 
eliminated the need for assistants to the lighting designer. 
"Think about what that does," says Palagi "to a guy who is 
famous for being able to put tears in your eyes by the way he 
lights a scene." If they're adaptable, like Charlie Brown at the 
Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, they'll become good 
programmers. "He became an excellent lighting program- 
mer. He's great with the light pallet." The light pallet has 
changed Brown's job considerably. Once he's programmed the 
lighting, all he has to do is punch a cue button during the per- 
formance. 

There's another problem, this one a poser for the computer 
print-out schedule. On theme park projects like the Universal 
Tour, there are language problems: people from three dif- 
ferent fields are working together. There are film people, 
theater people, and television people. Each profession has its 
own specialized jargon, which causes problems for the lighting 
designer. What one profession calls a light, another calls a fix- 
ture. The third will call it a unit, and the poor consultant who 
specifies that lamps be placed at the foot of the stage is likely 
to find any one of three objects installed when he arrives at 
work. 

The Graphic Apple. Kaliczak removes the lens cap from the 
video camera over the drafting table. "Now watch the effects I 
can get with this camera." He can set his program to interpret 
one color from the camera as any color he wants on his 
monitor. Thus the color blue from an original graphic can be 
changed to any one of sixteen colors from red to green. This 
facility allows Kaliczak a great versatility in design. 

To demonstrate, he copies the robot poster from the cover

of Softalk's August issue. The poster appears on his screen as 
chartreuse and green. "Now look what you can do." He 
manipulates the robot into a high contrast black and white im- 
age. "How do you like that?" The ability to reverse colors and 
manipulate images has made the Apple graphics invaluable to 
Kaliczak in designing projection screens for special effects. 

"My goal is to develop an extremely high-resolution 
graphics system that is friendly to artists and designers. The 
problem with the graphics packages on the market now is 
that you have to know something about computers to use them. 
Computer programmers don't understand what an artist 
needs to work with." 

Although he would Uke to see a simpler system for the non- 
computerist artist, Kaliczak is fond of the Apple graphics 
system. He beheves it is the most complete and advanced 
graphics system available for microcomputers. 

Kaliczak knows of one other man who is using computer 
generated show materials and planning at this time, and a 
growing nimiber of consultants who are getting computers for 
various purposes. "That's why I have just about every word 
processor available for the Apple. It's not that I use them all 
myself. I have to be able to communicate with the other consul- 
tants I work with. We are constantly exchanging information." 

The Fascination of the Dome. Kaliczak has been involved in 
more projects than he can count, but one of the more futuristic 
projects happened a while back. In 1969, he and two friends 
were discussing the geodesic dome that was then owned by a 
Los Angeles university. They decided to offer the college fifty 
dollars for the entire structure— that was all the money they 
had. To their surprise, the college took the offer. 

"We sold it to the University of New Mexico. They paid us 
to come out and put it together for them. We sold it for ten thou- 
sand bucks. Cal State will never live that one down." 



Among fifty-some other projects, Kaliczak is working on a 
book covering the technical design of domes for engineers. 
Drawings of dome structures for the book are now on com- 
puter files. Kaliczak has written a program that allows him to 
manipulate the angle from which the domes are viewed. As the 
program runs, the dome appears to rotate on the monitor. The 
perspective moves from a distant view of an entire dome to 
close-ups of joints for detailed structural study. Kaliczak also 
organized one of the first international conferences on domes : 
"Focus: Shelters for Mankind," an alternative architectural 
and energy conference. 

The conference was attended by more than a hundred 
pioneering domers. Since then, Kaliczak has worked as a 
structural and civil engineer and contractor for the Inter- 
national Geodesic Corporation and is a cofounder of Dome 
West, which designed the theatrical system and equipment for 
the two domes at the University of Mexico in Mexico City. 

And His System's Still Growing. But all that's old stuff, and 
tonight Kaliczak's energy is focused on equipment for sale as 
he checks the different bulletin boards with his computer. 
Since he purchased his Apple in June 1980, he has picked up a 
lot of paraphernalia. It hasn't been cheap. His two systems 
have set him back about twenty thousand dollars so far. But he 
does get his use out of the gear. Not only that, Kaliczak is con- 
tributing to a new form of production in his electronic cottage 
in the hills. 

No one can predict what Kaliczak will do next with his 
hybrid Apple. But from the way he's eying the equipment for 
sale on the computer bulletin boards, it's not hard to guess. 
He's already started building a third system that will give 560 
by 492 graphic resolution. Kaliczak is hooked. And it's a safe 
bet to say that the world's biggest Apple will probably get even 
bigger. IW

THE BASIC 




By Wm.Y R.Smith 



It seems that no matter how much 
time and effort a programmer spends de- 
veloping a particular program, within a 
short amount of time someone figures out 
a better way, a faster way, or new and 
fancier functions that the program 
should perform. This single trait may be 
one of the most important ingredients to 
the future growth of computers and soft- 
ware. If you have thought of a new func- 
tion for one of the software products 
you've purchased, send the idea in to the 
manufacturer. You'd be surprised at the 
number of improvements that have been 
suggested by Apple owners. 

This month's Basic Solution program 
was written by Brad Stone of Provo, 
Utah. He read the May issue of Softalk 
and found a way to improve the Softalk 

100 TEST : HOME :D$ 



Hello program. His feeling was that the 
program was too limited in that the 
users should not only be able to run the 
program of their choice, but also load, 
lock, or delete any file on an Apple disk- 
ette. He also included instructions at the 
bottom of the screen so the user does not 
get confused. 

The Basic Solution is anxious to hear 
from Softalk readers about the types of 
programs they'd like to see printed in up- 
coming issues. With the starting of the 
New Year it will be interesting to find out 
how many of you would like to see more 
Basic programs or a discussion of the 
concepts of programming in Basic. You 
be the judge. Take a moment and write to 
Softalk Basic Solutions, 11021 Magnolia 
Boulevard, North Hollywood, CA 91601.

50 Belvedere Street. San Rafael, CA 94901 (415)454-6500 



DECEMBER 1981 S C3 T A L K ^ 

Pioneer Retailer Jim Sadlier 

from page 148 — — — 



ware coming into the Apple market. 

Good Stores Emphasize Support. 
Through these market shifts, Sadlier has 
steadfastly refused to change his sales 
philosophy, which has always been to 
speak basic layman, a language he be- 
lieves communicates better to most 
users. "We've got technicians who are 
delighted to compare clock rates with the 
technically oriented users. But the aver- 
age prospect who comes in the store isn't 
an expert and he needs information de- 
livered in a fashion he can understand. 
That means plain English." For this rea- 
son, Sadlier populates his sales staff with 
folks who have a strong sales back- 
ground but who are not expert in per- 
sonal computers. This policy has the ef- 
fect of forcing the sales pitch down to the 
level of the user who isn't knowledgeable 
in the workings of computers. 

Computerland of South Bay empha- 
sizes support of the computer user. Sad- 
lier perceives applications software as 
being more important to today's buyer 
than the hardware, because today's buy- 
er is not computer literate. On the other 
hand, that lack of literacy forces the 
store to provide more in the way of sup- 
port services. It's the emphasis on sup- 
port that Sadlier believes has kept him in 
business against the discounters. 

Business Apples Can Play, Too. For 
all that most of the computer buyers are 
now business oriented, a good percent- 
age of the software sold continues to be 
entertainment. Apparently, the business 
user takes the computer home at night 
for the rest of the family to enjoy. 

Computerland of South Bay was one 
of the stores that suffered from a prod- 
uct shortage last Christmas season. "We 
ran out of everything last year and took 
off the week between Christmas and New 
Year's. We didn't mean it that way, but 
we didn't have anything left to sell." Sad- 
lier has no intentions of getting caught 
short again this year. He's ordered what 
would seem to be an inordinate number 
of computers and rented more warehouse 
space to stockpile them until needed. 

In addition, the proximity of his loca- 
tion to Softsel leads Sadlier to believe that 
he's insulated from a shortage of soft- 
ware. "Last year, we were down to the 
bare walls." 

Even though the market has shifted 
toward the business user, the Christmas 
season remains the strongest period of 
the year. "There's a sense of the season 
that fuels additional sales. We get people 
in to buy that peripheral they've been 
wanting but putting off. 

"There's also a good business reason 
to buy before the end of the year to get 
the tax break. That practicality is 
strengthened by the sense of the sea- 
son." 

The Seeding of Blossoms Yet To 



Come. Sadlier credits Apple Computer 
Inc. for the development of the computer 
store as a viable retail entity. By provid- 
ing retailers with a mass market appeal 
computer at a low price, Apple provided 
the foundation for many of the retail 
stores now in existence. 

But he doesn't see anytime soon the 
realization of the vision of a microcom- 
puter in every home. "Until the applica- 
tions software is in place to allow bank- 
ing, paying bills, and shopping at home 
and until data bases from which the 



159 



home computer user draw are wide- 
spread and inexpensive, we aren't going 
to see mass penetration of computers in- 
to the home. The applications will have to 
be there to justify the expense." 

Sadlier believes the small business 
market is even more important to the 
retailer today. The advent of additional 
application software and mass storage 
devices pave the way for increased pen- 
etration into this market. In his estima- 
tion, these advances should fuel the mi- 
crocomputer industry for at least an- 
other two years. 

During that time span, watching the 
trendsetting retailers may give us some 
indication of what will follow.

This article grew out of a desire to find out which of the two 
Fortran language systems available for the Apple II com- 
puter, Apple Fortran and Microsoft Fortran, would best suit 
the needs of the authors. Before long, the effort had been ex- 
panded into a full-fledged evaluation not only of the two For- 
tran languages, but also of the development systems that sup- 
port them. 

The Fortran language was originally developed by IBM for 
applications involving numerical solution of equations. For- 
tran is an acronym for formula, translator. It was released for 
public use in 1957, after which it evolved as a scientific pro- 
gramming language and was standardized in 1966. Literally 
billions of dollars have been invested in development of For- 
tran programs since then. As a result of continued evolution 
and expanded applications involving character and film ma- 
nipulations, a new standard was announced in 1977 and for- 
mally accepted in 1978. It is known semiofficially as Fortran 
77. The Fortran language systems supplied by Microsoft and 
Apple correspond to the 1966 and 1977 versions, respectively. 



The fundamental difference between Basic and Fortran is 
that Fortran is a compiled language whereas Basic is an inter- 
preted lang^uage. What this means is that Fortran source state- 
ments are converted (compiled) into machine code only once, 
while Basic statements are converted (interpreted) every time 
the statement is executed. 

The upshot of this is that Fortran normally executes much 
faster than Basic, sometimes as much as thirty times faster. 
The price you pay for the increased execution speed is that you 
must submit your source language program to the Fortran 
compiler so it can produce object (machine) code. The resul- 
tant code must then be linked with other object code routines 
and the Fortran library to produce an executable program. 

This procedure is a high-overhead item for small, quick- 
running programs, but for larger, longer-running codes it can 
be a convenient way to program. It allows for the independent 
development of subroutines and libraries of subroutines to car- 
ry out common procedures such as matrix inversion and sort- 
ing. This is very difficult to do in Basic because of variable 
name and line number conflicts. 

The extra work and complexity involved in writing and de- 
bugging a program in Fortran make it a difficult language for 
a novice to use. This is especially true on a microcomputer 
where you have limited resources to use in the debugging proc- 
ess. For example, the lack of a printer would make It very 
hard to trace an error through several routines. For these rea- 
sons, almost no one recommends Fortran for programming 
novices, and we would not recommend the versions for the Ap- 
ple for anyone not already familiar with Fortran or a similar 
higher level language. 

Because the steps involved in writing a Fortran program 
are different from those used to develop a Basic program, we 
must consider the entire program development process when 
comparing languages. This is particularly true when the two 
operating systems differ as they do with Apple Fortran and Mi- 
crosoft Fortran. In particular, the aspects reviewed here in- 
clude documentation, operating environment, and program 
execution. 

In the following sections, the discussions of documentation 
and operating environment have been combined and treated 
separately for each language, while the comparisons of execu- 
tion speeds are lumped together. In addition, the introduction 
of a 6809 microprocessor board from Stellation Two, known as 
the Mill, prompted the inclusion of its effect on the execution 
speed of Apple Fortran. 

Requirements. Microsoft Fortran requires a 48K system 
with the Microsoft SoftCard. The documentation gives exam- 
ples for a one-drive system, but, as a practical matter, two disk 
drives are required for any serious development work using 
Fortran. In addition, the CP/M operating system (supplied 



162 



DECEMBER 1981 



with the SoftCard) is required. While not strictly necessary, an 
additional 16K of memory would allow a wider range of appli- 
cations to be run with Fortran. 

Documentation. The documentation for Microsoft Fortran 
comes in a three-ring binder and consists of two parts, the For- 
tran-80 User's Guide and the Fortran-80 Reference Manual. 
The first of these takes the user in a step-by-step fashion 
through the start-up procedures necessary to compile, load 
(link-edit), and execute a Fortran program. In this respect, it 
is a very good document. 

However, when running Fortran, you can't divorce your- 
self from the operating system, CP/M, and the documentation 
on it leaves a lot to be desired. This is especially true of the line 
editor supplied with CP/M. In fact, you'll probably want to sup- 
plement the supplied documentation on CP/M with some from 
your local computer store. 

The Fortran Reference Manual is just that, a reference 
manual. If you're familiar with Fortran and the reference 
manuals on larger systems, you'll like this manual. It is well 
laid out and has a reasonable index (not complete, but reason- 
able) . If you're a novice to Fortran or don't like the manuals on 
the bigger machines, you'll hate this one. The manual is def- 
initely not a learning guide and you would be well advised to 
purchase one of the books recommended in the User's Guide. 

There are some deficiencies in the Microsoft Fortran docu- 
mentation. The most notable of these deals with diagnostic 
messages for compilation, loading (linking), and rim-time 
execution errors. These messages give the user very little in- 
formation about what is wrong and none about how to rectify 
the situation. Also missing are discussions on more advanced 
features concerning the interaction of Fortran with the I/O 
routines and the operating system. From comments made in 
the documentation, it appears that some of this information (if 
not all) is available in the Assembly Language Development 
System (an extra-cost item), which includes Microsoft's mac- 
ro assembler and library manager. For programs with large 
numbers of subroutines, some sort of library management sys- 
tem is required. Otherwise you will be typing in every routine 
name used every time you link-edit your program. 

Operating Environment. As noted, the basic steps in 
developing a Fortran program include the use of an editor, 
compiler, and loader. As suplied by Microsoft, the operating 
environment consists of the CP/M operating system, the ED 
line-oriented editor, the F80 compiler, and the L80 loader. Un- 
fortunately, the most used piece of software in this set, the edi- 
tor, is the weakest from the user's standpoint. If you had never 
used an editor before, line or screen, then it's possible that you 
might actually like ED. However, for those who have been ex- 
posed to other editors, ED is poorly structured and a pain to 
use. In considering the overall cost of the system, you should 
probably include the cost of a better editor. 

As an operating system, CP/M is not the world's best; how- 
ever, unlike DOS, it is a real operating system and not just a 
language monitor. CP/M has all of the file utilities necessary 
to create and maintain your data and program files in an or- 
derly and consistent manner. One of the advantages of CP/M 
is that files written by one language can be read by another. 
Fortran files can be read by Basic programs and vice versa. 

The use of the compiler is straightforward and convenient. 
The entire compilation process is controlled by a single input 
command line. This line controls the generation and disposi- 
tion of both the object file and the source listing. An option is al- 
lowed in the compilation process that only checks for syntax 
errors and thus helps reduce the amount of time required in 
initial checkout. 

Link-80, the name Microsoft has given to their linking load- 
er, is only slightly harder to use than the compiler. Again, the 
execution is controlled by a single input sequence (this time it 
can be more than one line) , which means that you don't have to 
wait for the loader to supply it additional information. The ma- 
jor deficiencies in Link-80, as supplied, are the skimpy docu- 
mentation and the requirement that you name all routines 
loaded with your program. The latter problem can be rectified 



with the purchase of Microsoft's Library Manager. To date, we 
haven't tried to load any complicated programs or to chain two 
programs together, so our experience with Link-80 is limited. 

Fortran-80. Microsoft Fortran-80 is a subset of the 1966 For- 
tran standard along with some fairly common extensions, the 
most notable of which are the inclusion of the END= and 
ERR= clauses in I/O statements, the use of the literal form of 
Hollerith data (character string delimited by apostrophes), 
and additions to the declaration of data types, which include 
the byte type (poorly documented). 

Features of the language that only pertain to the Apple in- 
clude lo-res graphics routines, paddle and button interface rou- 
tines, a tone or note-generating routine, and direct cursor posi- 
tioning routines. 

The major restriction in Fortran-80 is the lack of the com- 
plex data type. The latter is quite common in Fortrans for mi- 
crocomputers (it's not included in Apple Fortran either) and 
will only be missed by a very limited audience. The features 
most missed are hi-res graphics, a generalized I/O routine that 
would allow the reading of any device, and free-field input rou- 
tines to allow for easy input of data from the console. The last 
of these items is a serious limitation of Microsoft Fortran and 
degrades the usefulness of Fortran on the Apple or any other 
microcomputer. 
Apple Fortran. 

Apple Fortran requires a 48K system with the Pascal Lan- 
guage System (including the 16K RAM card) and two disk 
drives. In principle, one disk drive will work, but in practice 
two are needed and three would be even better because of the 
disk space required for the system itself. Apple Fortran, as 
packaged and sold, is not a complete system and assumes that 
you have the Apple Pascal system (more on this later) . 

Documentation. The Apple Fortran manual is handsomely 
prepared and typeset in a spiral-bound volume, like all of Ap- 
ple's manuals. It isn't a complete manual, as it requires the 
Pascal Operating System Reference Manual to complement it. 
Moreover, it is poorly laid out and is difficult to read through in 
a logical manner. Material is hard to find and sometimes is in- 
adequately indexed, which makes it difficult to use as a refer- 
ence manual. 

Initial setup of Apple Fortran requires transferring some 
system files from Pascal disks to Fortran disks. The config- 
urations recommended in the manual are poor ones, as they 
leave the user with a minimal amount of disk space. Also, 
while the manual appears to lead the user through the process 
of creating a program from start to finish, the procedure out- 
lined will not work for any program of reasonable size. 

Even for those already familiar with the Pascal system, it 
isn't obvious how to proceed. There are more steps than are 
apparent and some fancy disk swapping is required to get 
lengthy programs compiled and linked. As noted, short pro- 
grams (whose text and code files fit on the boot disk) can be 
handled easily. 

An inherent part of program development is debugging and 
error handling. The manual contains extensive lists of com- 
pile-time and run-time error messages, but these are some- 
times cryptic. We have had error messages we never could ex- 
plain (nor could the folks at Apple) and wound up with pro- 
grams that never would compile. Oddly, these same program 
files, when uploaded to another computer system, compiled 
without a hitch. There is another set of error messages that 
aren't documented anywhere. These are similar to the seg- 
ment/procedure/byte error messages in Pascal, but they have 
no apparent meaning in Fortran. 

One final note on documentation: Fortran programs run 
under Pascal revision 1.1 must be modified with a program 
called Fortfix to compensate for some residual bugs. This is 
not documented in the manual, but Apple has attempted to 
spread the word through letters to registered Fortran owners, 
publication in Call A.F.P.L.E., and distribution by the Inter- 
national Apple Corps. 

Operating Environment. The Fortran operating environ- 
ment consists of the same UCSD Pascal Editor and Filer used 



DECEMBER 1981 



163 



in the Apple Pascal system. The \JCSD Editor is a good screen- 
oriented Editor that allows rapid entry and editing of pro- 
grams. The Editor can also be used as a word processor. The 
Filer has adequate file-handling capabilities and utilities for 
routine file saving and transfer. The system is sometimes in- 
convenient when bouncing back and forth between the Editor 
and the Filer. 

Program execution requires a three-step process once it is 
entered. The program must be compiled/debugged, linked, 
and updated (with the Fortfix program) to create an executa- 
ble code file. The Compiler and Linker are called from the 
command mode ; these files are peculiar to the Fortran sys- 
tem and are different from their Pascal counterparts. Their 
operation is somewhat complex when dealing with programs 
too large to fit on either of the system disks. This is where a 
third disk drive would be handy. Apple Fortran works slightly 
differently than Microsoft Fortran in that the Compiler pro- 
duces a pseudo-code (or p-code). P-code is a machine code for a 
pseudo-machine which is then interpreted by the Apple's 6502. 
This has the advantage of portability of user code, at the 
expense of being interpreted rather than compiled. 

The Compiler has a nice cross-reference feature that pro- 
duces an alphabetical list of program variables and refer- 
ences the line where they are called. This is helpful for both 
documentation and debugging. The Fortran language does not 
force variable declarations (strong typing) as does Pascal, so 
a mistyped variable name compiles without notice and can 
cause havoc later on when the program is run. But the cross- 
reference can call attention to spurious variables. For 
example, any variable used only once would be suspect and 
could be checked. The Linker is relatively fast (compared with 
the Compiler), but it creates rather large (twenty-six-block 
minimum) executable code files. 

Language. Apple Fortran is subset of Fortran 77 and has 
the features of the new standard. The principal extensions of 
the new standard are IF-statement constructs, character data 
types, and standardization of I/O. The new IF constructs per- 



mit logical IF, block IF, and IF-THEN-ELSEIF-ENDIF state- 
ments. These permit more fluent programs (without GOTO 
statements) that are consistent with modem structured pro- 
gramming practices. This can have a significant impact on 
program development time. Apple has also included special 
units (not in the standard) that provide Turtlegraphics and Ap- 
plestuff for hi-res graphics, music notes, and paddle controls 
in Fortran. 

The most noticeable items not included in the language sub- 
set are the complex and double precision data types. The very 
useful practice of passing subroutine names through calling se- 
quences via external declarations is not provided for. Most of 
the other items that are missing are minor and won't be 
missed when good programming practices are adhered to. 

Extensions. Apple Fortran program development can take 
advantage of the Mill, a 6809 microprocessor board for the Ap- 
ple. With the appropriate software (Pascal Speed-up Kit and 
Floating-Point Option) the operating system and program 
execution run faster because the instructions are routed 
through the 6809 instead of the Apple's resident 6502. The per- 
formance of the Mill-enhanced Apple is sufficiently different 
from that of the unmodified Apple that it warrants a separate 
category in the benchmark tests. 

Benchmarks. 

The use of benchmarks to measure the relative perfor- 
mance of computers and languages is quite common. Bench- 
marks are computer programs designed to test out different 
aspects of the machine, I/O configuration and languages. The 
only foolproof benchmark program is the specific software you 
intend to run. Then different machines and configurations can 
be compared. Any other benchmark is an approximation at 
best. In using other people's benchmarks, first try to define 
your own computing requirements so that the benchmarks are 
relevant to your needs. 

Benchmark programs fall into two categories: those that 
do useful calculations and those that do contrived calcula- 
tions. Programs of the first type are apt to have meaning and

relevance to the users. They usually aren't designed to make a 
particular product look good or to fit a preconceived notion. 
Contrived programs, however, have the advantage that they 
can be short, portable, and easy to test out on a variety of ma- 
chines. All the benchmarks in this article fall into the latter 
category. 

The first benchmark was chosen to test out the speed of the 
floating point routines used in Microsoft's and Apple's For- 
trans. This benchmark (from Tom Fox, "Report Card: Bench- 
mark," Interface Age, August 1981, pp. 74-82) was selected be- 
cause it has had good exposure and is not known to be biased. 
It has been used on a variety of machines to compare different 
Basics. Also, it is informative and interesting to see how the 
Apple stacks up against the competition and how Fortran com- 
pares with Basic. The program, shown in listing 1, computes 
the prime numbers that lie in the range from 0 to 1000. Neither 
the algorithm nor the coding of the routine is particularly good, 
and hence they tend to detract from the usefulness of this 
benchmark. The emphasis in this routine is on the speed of the 
floating-point divide routines. 

The results of the first benchmark are shown in table 1. We 
have broken the results into three categories ; they are the un- 
assisted Apple, which is referred to as "Native Apple" ; the Mi- 
crosoft SoftCard; and the Mill-enhanced Apple with the Pas- 
cal Speed-Up Kit software, referred to as the "Mill." 

Included with the Fortran results are timings for Applesoft 
and MBasic (supplied with the SoftCard) and Apple Pascal. 
These results give us an insight into where- the differences in 
speed are coming from. Most people recognize that the Ap- 
ple's 6502 microprocessor is faster than similar Z-80 chips. The 
relative quickness of Applesoft Basic, 32 percent faster than 
MBasic, demonstrates this fact. So why is the Z-80 Fortran 
faster than Apple Fortran? The answer lies in the fact that Mi- 
crosoft Fortran is a compiled Fortran while the Apple Fortran 
generates p-code, which is then interpreted. Hence, the 21.6 
percent difference in speed between the two Fortrans is main- 
ly due to the superiority of the software implementation and 
not the basic hardware differences. In fact, when we look at 
the next set of benchmarks, we will see that the relative close- 
ness of the timings in this benchmark probably indicates that 
the floating-point routines for the 6502 are well written. Inter- 
estingly, the Mill-enhanced Apple Fortran ran 28.7 percent 
faster than Microsoft's. This shows the superiority of the 6809 
microprocessor over the 6502 and Z-80 for floating-point calcu- 
lations. This conclusion was substantiated in an additional 
benchmark that made extensive use of all the floating-point 
arithmetic routines. 

The second benchmark in this study is designed to test a 
procedure that computers are frequently called upon to do, 
that is, sort numbers. This benchmark uses very little of the 
number-generating capabilities of the Apple. Instead, it uses 
the relational and comparative capabilities to put an array of 
numbers into their proper order. 

This benchmark also illustrates one of the advantages of 
using a language such as Fortran — the use of canned routines. 
In this case, it is the sorting subroutine, TSORT, which uses a 
tree sorting scheme. Routines such as this can be used as black

boxes to perform desired tasks, much in the same manner as 
we call the SQRT routine to find the square root of a number. 

The source code for this benchmark is shown in listing 2A. 
The basic method used was to load the real array A with one 
hundred numbers from 99.0 to 0.0 and then sort them by call- 
ing TSORT. The procedure was repeated one hundred times to 
get a good timing. The results are shown in table 2, column a. 

The results of this benchmark are somewhat surprising af- 
ter the results of the first benchmark. The Z-80 Fortran was a 
full five times faster (2.6 times for the Mill version) than the 
Apple Fortran. This result clearly shows the superiority in 
speed of compiled code over interpreted code. 

However, it wasn't certain that this benchmark was as fair 
and informative as it might seem. There are two factors that 
might influence or bias the results. Normally, large sorts re- 
quire a lot of disk I/O. The program was modified to write out 
the array onto a file outside of the main loop and to read it back 
in before each sort. The new program is shown in listing 2B. 

The results from this benchmark are in table 2, column b. 
The ratio of Apple Fortran to Microsoft Fortran was reduced to 
4.6:1, hardly a dramatic improvement. The second factor in- 
vestigated was the different ways in which the Apple stores 
real and integer numbers. Real variables require four bytes of 
storage compared to two bytes for integers. The benchmark 
was once again modified. This time, the sorted array was de- 
clared to be integer and the appropriate modification was 
made to subroutine TSORT. 

The results from this modification are shown in table 2, col- 
umn c. The execution times for both Fortrans were greatly re-

duced to 12.3 :1. This result indicates that the problem is not as- 
sociated with real numbers or four-byte fetches and is indeed 
due to the differences between compiled and interpreted code. 

The last benchmark in our series was taken from Jim Gil- 
breath, "A High-Level Language Benchmark" {Byte, Sep- 
tember 1981, pp 180-198) , in which it was run on a variety of ma- 
chines using ten different languages. Again this extends the 
range of interest beyond that of Apple owners. 

The algorithm is known as the Sieve of Eratosthenes; the 
program is shown in listing 3. The program finds all of the 
prime numbers in the range from 0 to 8191. The process is re- 
peated ten times in the program to obtain the accurate timing. 
A few minor modifications have been made to the Fortran pro-

The results from this benchmark are shown in table 3. They 
show that Microsoft Fortran is fifteen times faster than the na- 
tive Apple and ten times faster than the Mill-enhanced Apple.

Table 3. Sieve of Eratosthenes Benchmark. 



It's interesting to compare this algorithm with the prime-num- 
ber generator in listing 1. However, remember that the type of 
benchmark we're running is to compare the same algorithm 
using the two Fortrans, not to compare different algorithms. 

The main conclusions to be drawn from the execution times 
of these benchmarks are: 

1. Microsoft Fortran and Apple Fortran have comparable 
execution speeds for floating-point arithmetic. 

2. Microsoft Fortran is much superior in execution speed to 
native Apple Fortran in non-floating-point operations. 

3. The Mill-enhanced Apple outperforms the native Apple 
in all respects, and the SoftCard in floating-point operations 
(but not otherwise). 

It's almost always difficult to interpret the results of bench- 
marks of this type. First, execution speed is not the only cri- 
terion to use in evaluating different systems, and quite often is 
not even the most important. This is the case when the com- 
pute time is small between I/O operations. For example, if you 
are typing in data, it doesn't matter if the computation takes 
0.1 seconds or 0.5 seconds between entries. At the other ex- 
treme, if your job takes ten hours to run, you probably

shouldn't be using a microcomputer anyway. However, if your 
requirements fall somewhere in between, the best way to use 
these results is to construct a weighted average of floating- 
point and non-floating-point operations used in these bench- 
marks. 
Conclusions. 

It's by now apparent that both the Microsoft and Apple ver- 
sions of Fortran have certain advantages and disadvantages. 
The choice of which system to use will have to depend on your 
particular needs. Three factors that we consider to be the most 
important are program development time, proposed applica- 
tions, and system cost. 

Program Development Time. There is more to program de- 
velopment than just typing in statements. There are several 
points to consider: writing the program (Does the logic of the 
language flow? Is the program understandable and easy to 
document?) ; correcting and updating the program (Is the edi- 
tor working for you or against you? Is disk storage and re- 
trieval convenient?) ; and debugging the program (Is the com- 
piler giving informative messages? Is the documentation easy 
to understand?). 

Fortran 77 is clearly superior to its predecessors. In par- 
ticular, the new IF-statement constructs permit creation of 
more logical programs in a shorter amount of time (although 
we wouldn't want to quantify that statement). We haven't 
reached a consensus as to which operating system is superior 
since only one of the authors has access to CP/M. However, it's 
clear that the Pascal language system is a viable operating 
system, and it has the added advantage that Apple Pascal pro- 
grammers will find in Fortran no difference from the system 
they're already using. 

In both cases the documentation was found wanting and we 
recommend that an additional language reference manual be 
kept handy. Unfortunately, there are no second sources for 
compiler and run-time error messages. 

Applications. Choosing a Fortran for your applications re- 
quires two considerations: the first is whether the language 



supports all the features you need; the second is speed of 
operation. Each Fortran implementation has features that the 
other lacks ; these may be the deciding factor in your case. Mi- 
crosoft Fortran supports double-precision; Apple does not. 
Some scientific and engineering problems require double-pre- 
cision arithmetic, but most do not. Apple has taken advantage 
of the Turtlegraphics developed for its Pascal package and im- 
plemented them in Fortran. It's very nice to be able to see your 
results right away in multicolor graphics, and many printers 
will permit a dump of the hi-res screen. Microsoft Fortran sup- 
ports only lo-res graphics. Another important point is that Ap- 
ple's Fortran 77 supports character strings, which are a neces- 
sity in many applications, while character manipulations us- 
ing Microsoft Fortran are very laborious. 

But the real reason why most of us consider buying For- 
tran is speed. Here is where Microsoft's Fortran is superior to 
Apple's. In the benchmarks we ran, the Microsoft version ran 
from 1.2 to 15 times faster than the Apple. This, of course, is the 
difference between a compiler and an interpreter. 

However, if speed of floating-point operations is your ma- 
jor concern, you should consider the Mill. The Mill is a 6809 mi- 
croprocessor board for the Apple. With the appropriate soft- 
ware (namely, the Pascal Speed-Up Kit with the floating-point 
option) , the Mill can improve the Apple Fortran performance 
and even exceed that of Microsoft. The benchmarks show a 
clear advantage of the Mill-enhanced Apple when floating- 
point operations are the bottleneck in the computations. The 
Mill also works with the Editor and Compiler and actually 
speeds up their operation. 

There is a possibility that the Mill could work in conjunc- 
tion with Microsoft Fortran as well, but it hasn't been done. 
Anyway, although Microsoft Fortran is generally faster, the 
Mill-enhanced Apple Fortran may be superior for a broad 
range of scientific and engineering problems. Another consid- 
eration is that Microsoft Fortran is much faster at sorting and 
other nonnumeric tasks. 

To choose the system that's best for you, first consider the

featxires that are offered. Then give some thought to the fol- 
lowing: Are your programs development-time or run-time in- 
tensive? In other words, are you writing short programs with 
long run times or repeated use, or are you writing very large 
programs that are only run once or twice? If no decision can be 
made on the basis of these considerations, perhaps the system 
cost will be the deciding factor in your case. 

System Cost. There are many ways to configure your Ap- 
ple as a Fortran system. For the sake of comparison, we'll as- 
sume that you now have an Apple with 48K and two disk 
drives. Table 4 shows a comparison of three system configtira- 
tions based on manufacturer's suggested prices (although we 
took some liberties rounding off the figures). There may be 
other ways of configiiring the system. 

The cost of the Fortran systems ranges from $600 for the 
Microsoft SoftCard and Fortran through $700 for the Apple 
Language System plus Fortran up to more than $1,100 for a 



Mill-enhanced Apple. But these systems aren't limited to rim- 
ning Fortran, and we should see what else is included for the 
price. 

The SoftCard comes with a complete CP/M system and Mi- 
crosoft Basic. This opens up the entire world of CP/M to the 
Apple owner. The Apple Language System comes with the 
complete Pascal language and operating system and a 16K 
RAM card that works with other Apple programs as well (such 
as VisiCalc) ; it expands the Apple memory significantly. The 
Mill is sold with your choice of the Pascal Speed-Up Kit or a 
6809 assembler. The Mill permits concurrent use of both the 
6502 and 6809 microprocessors and opens up a whole new spec- 
trum of possibilities for the Apple. 

The choice is a difficult one and may well be colored by the 
equipment you already have. One of the things that made writ- 
ing this article enjoyable is that each author has chosen a dif- 
ferent route and each is quite adamant in his choice. Ji

"Let me be honest with you, Mister Simon — the boy has 
somehow managed to get inside the bank's computer system. I 
don't know how, but he opened a phony interest-bearing check- 
ing account. He transfers funds into the account and then out 
again. While money's in the account, it earns interest. Then he 
withdraws the interest. ' ' 

"I didn't know that was possible. " 

"It's not supposed to be possible. Maybe he used one of 
those home computers, I don't know. ..." 

It's easy to rob a bank. Mild-mannered, unassuming, boy- 
next-door lookalike Phil DeGuere has it all figured out. And it 
can be done, in theory, on an Apple. 

The scenario that began this article was taken from the 
first episode of Simon and Simon, a new television series on 
CBS. Although the events depicted were fictitious, DeGuere be- 
lieves similar incidents are happening more often than bank 
executives admit. 

DeGuere is a producer at Universal Studios in Hollywood, 
California, and his current project, Simon and Simon, is 
about a pair of brothers who go into the detective business. It 
stars Jameson Parker and Gerald McRaney. 

An Apple Joins the Underground. In that first episode, writ- 
ten by DeGuere, Terry, a fourteen-year-old boy, breaks the 
code in the computer system at a bank by means of his home 
computer, an Apple II. Whenever he needs school supplies, 
birthday presents, or parts for his computer, Terry just trans- 
fers money into his account, collects the interest, and trans- 
fers the original sum back again. 



So how did this pubescent bank robber break the code in the 
first place? "Just like all the other computer criminals are do- 
ing," explained DeGuere, who hopes banks will soon smarten 
up. DeGuere 's story idea was taken from a real-life incident at 
DePaul University where two college students managed to 
break into the computerized grading system by writing a sub- 
routine that tried every possible combination of letters until it 
found the correct password. 

"It might take many hours to run through eight million 
combinations, but computers don't get bored," says De- 
Guere. "Conceivably anyone can do this — even a fourteen- 
year-old boy." "But Terry's a good boy. He ends up getting 
caught and has to apologize and promise to return all the mon- 
ey he stole." 

End of story? Not quite. The financial advisor at the bank 
gets greedy, kidnaps Terry, and forces him to heist seven mil- 
lion dollars from the bank. Much fighting, gun shooting, and 
falling off cliffs ensues. But Simon and Simon manage to res- 
cue Terry and receive the Apple as a reward. That's Holly- 
wood, after all. 

"I'm toying with the idea of making the Apple a regular 
character on this series, and it would be easy to do since the 
story ended with the Apple in the hands of the Simon brothers. 
A couple of years ago I wanted to make a series starring a 
computer, but nobody took me seriously. I probably could sell 
it now." 

DeGuere was first introduced to computers in 1962 when he 
was attending Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. Off 
the beaten track on campus was an IBM computer, a monster 
machine that filled an entire room. Word got around campus 
that fun things were going on there after midnight.

"I discovered a lot of people loading the computer night af- 
ter night with paper tape to play Space Wars. So I started stay- 
ing up all night to join them." 

Back to Nature? That was in 1962. Eight years later, De- 
Guere was living in the Los Altos hills. There he was in- 
fluenced strongly by a bearded man who lived down the moun- 
tain in a log cabin. "Well, almost a log cabin. I'd see him every 
morning at the crack of dawn chopping wood for their fire- 
place and wood stove." 

Once in a while, DeGuere would travel down the mountain- 
side and help the modern day mountain man. DeGuere would 
usually manage to get himself invited for breakfast, which was 
prepared over a wood- burning stove by the woodsman's wife. 

"They had electricity, but no running water. That had to be 
carried in from a well." 

After breakfast, when a roaring blaze in the fireplace had 
sufficiently warmed the living room, the tall bearded moun- 
tain man shut himself inside to work. 

"You'd expect him to be making belts or pottery, right? 
Well, this guy had a computer terminal in his log cabin. He was 
a systems analyst for Stanford. It was the most amazing cul- 
ture shock I ever had." 

Looking back now, DeGuere realizes he was seeing a 
glimpse into the future — telecommuting — where even devout 
hermits could work out of their log cabins in the woods. 




Jameson Parker, left, and Gerald McRaney, the stars of Simon and Simon. After suc- 
cessfully dodging bullets and falling off cliffs, they're rewarded with on Apple com- 
puter. 

What a Super Christmas Present. Years passed. DeGuere 
left his own log cabin existence, got married, and took his pres- 
ent position at Universal Studios. On Christmas in 1979, Linda 
DeGuere presented her husband with an Apple computer. 

"I've always been a gadget freak and I've always liked 
toys, but I didn't have a clue what to do with this," he recalls. 

So he put it together. Years of experience hooking up 
stereos enabled him to hook up a microcomputer with no prob- 
lems. 

The big moment came to plug it in, and then "like God in a 
box it said Apple II on the screen," remembers DeGuere. Feel- 
ing as if he was communicating with some supernatural being, 
he typed "Hello" with shaking fingers. 



Coincidentally, he spelled hello wrong, and, when the ma- 
chine beeped and displayed "syntax error," "I thought, God, 
these things are amazing — they even correct spelling errors. 
From that point on I read the manual." 

DeGuere learned soon enough that he was destined for a life 
of computer mania. "I started writing programs and it wasn't 
uncommon for me to be sitting at the computer for twelve hours 
straight. My wife had to yank me away for dinner." 

Costarring Raster Blaster. He also discovered games and 
managed to wear out three sets of paddles (no exaggeration) 
playing Raster Blaster, which he calls "the best game on the 
market." 

The producer was so impressed with this game he decided 
to give it a feature role in that first episode of Simon and Si- 
mon. Hot on the trail of the boy bank robber, the detectives fol- 
low him from the automatic teller of the bank where he has 
just withdrawn some money, stolen, of course. 

Terry takes the loot and makes a getaway on his bicycle to 
the local computer store to buy an RS232 interface for his Ap- 
ple. Unknown to Terry, Rick Simon of the Simon and Simon de- 
tective agency is watching Terry's every move. Until Simon 
gets distracted by Raster Blaster. 

The character of Rick Simon is a study in human nature. 
Played by McRaney, Rick is a swaggering, cigarette-puffing 
cowboy type who is frequently distracted by women, food, and, 
in this scene. Raster Blaster. 

But it could happen to anybody. Rick Simon is trying to ap- 
pear inconspicuous in this store when he sees the flashing 
lights and colors of the pinball game on the screen of an Apple 
computer. He picks up the game paddles and becomes so to- 
tally engrossed in working the buttons that he doesn't see the 
boy escape. 

"I'm quite sure all the readers of Softalk will get a kick out 
of it. Certainly all the fans of Raster Blaster will," DeGuere 
says gleefully.

DECEMBER 1981 







Phil DeGuere, the master-mind behind it all, has better things to do than rob banks. 



Order out of Chaos. But won't an episode about computer- 
ized bank robbery give computers a bad name? 

"They already have a bad name. Everybody has seen com- 
puter errors on their bank statements or had telecredit's red 
light refuse their check. As for computerized bank robbing — 
that seems to be the bank's fault for not having adequate 
safety protection against the intrusion of electronic transfer." 

But DeGuere is thankful for computers, especially in his 
own job. "This is basically a chaotic and insane mess," he 
says, looking around. "Computers make the job possible." 

According to DeGuere, shooting a weekly hour- long televi- 
sion series can best be described as shooting twelve little 
movies, "and it takes a lot longer than a week to create it." 

DeGuere hsted the problems on his fingers: "The physical 
act of shooting an episode takes seven working days. We can 
only start that after we have a start on everything else. There's 
usually twenty parts to cast, we have to figure out the differ- 
ent locations for the shooting, and the script always has to be 
rewritten several times to suit the actors and director. And this 
all has to be done within the constraints of the budget." 

"TV series have always been chaos. It's like a snowball roll- 
ing down a hill. As time goes on it goes totally out of control." 

DeGuere seemed at a loss to demonstrate the avalanche, 
so a typical day at the filming of Simon and Simon did the 
job for him. 

A Visit to the Set. Mexican Street on the lot of Universal Stu- 
dios proved to be an intimidating place. It's hard not to get in 
the way there with dozens of people running back and forth, all 
with an emergency job to do. There's somebody to put a film of 
dust on the truck: somebody else to dust the lint off the actors, 
and still somebody else who's delivering hamburgers to the 



Why you need The Inspector. 



If you're serious about programming, you need 
to set all your utilities together in one place — 
insuk your Apple. The hispector comes on an 
Eprom that simply plugs into the D8 socket, or on 
a disk ready to merge with Integer Basic for 
automatic loading on boot. Either way, it stays at 
your fingertips, ready to call without disturbing 
your current program. 

The Inspector puts you in total control of both 
memory and disks. You can search forward 
and backwards, edit, read nibbles, 
map disk space, dump the screen 
to a printer, examine every secret 
of your Apple. Use The Inspector 
to repair blown disks, undelete 
files, input "illegal" commands, 




read and alter files, locate strings in memory or on 
disk. The uses are endless. The manual, alone, is an 
education. And it's Aways there when you need it. 

You need the most powerful disk and memory 
utility available for your Apple. You need the

hungry staff. There's another person whose sole responsibility 
seems to be yelling at everybody who's running madly back 
and forth. He's screaming now because the set doesn't look 
right to him. "There's not enough extras. Get a couple more 
drunks in there!" 

There's a break while the crew scatters off in every direc- 
tion to round up more actors. Jameson Parker, who plays A. J. 
Simon, is in the midst of all of this looking miserable — prob- 
ably not because the scene is going slowly, but more likely be- 
cause he has a bad case of the flu. But the show must go on— flu 
or no flu — since no one can replace Parker. 

Parker took advantage of the break to sit down for a few 
minutes and was willing to talk about computers. 

"I don't know much about them, but my wife wants to get 
an Apple computer. She manages me and says her job would 
be a lot easier if she had one." Parker let out a sneeze, blew his 
nose and continued. "You think with all this new technology 
they could invent a cure for colds." 

The drunks are in place. The man in charge of yelling has 
started again. "God, I've been through this so many times be- 
fore," he moans, pacing nervously in front of the cameras. 
"All right stand by. Quiet on the set. Let's try to get it right this 
time.'!.'" And the cameras start rolling. 

This time, everybody remembers their lines, nobody drops 
a prop, not even one unexpected airplane flies overhead. "All 
right cut!" shouts the director. Just in time. Jameson Parker 
bends over and lets out a giant sneeze. 

The Casting Couch Revisited. Computers might not have 
found a cure for colds or flu yet, but DeGuere has found they 
prevent a lot of headaches. 

From his office, DeGuere manages to keep a lot of hectic 
things from happening on the set. He's responsible for an eight- 
million-dollar budget on the show. Fortunately, computers pro- 
vide an access to quick information and easier manipulation of 
data. 

For instance, on the mini system in his office is a data man- 



agement system to keep track of actors. If he needs a three 
and a half foot dwarf to play a part, he can find one almost in- 
stantly via computer. 

When a script has to be revised over and over again, it 
saves a lot of secretarial labor to do it on a word processor. 
And Nielsen ratings are also at the producer's fingertips, via 
the source. "An insane mess, but it's possible," muses De- 
Guere. 

DeGuere believes that, besides saving the show, compu- 
ters can straighten out the world. "With union strikes, the di- 
minishing supply of oil, and crime in the streets, breaking the 
urban congestion of the cities has got to be the future— just like 
that guy in the log cabin demonstrates." 

Brave New World. "It's no longer necessary to bring ev- 
erybody together within the confines of the city limits to con- 
tribute to the economy. Telecommuting will make it possible 
for more of us to live in our log cabins in the woods." 

An insane mess, but it's possible. It's nice to think about. 
But get DeGuere theorizing, and he'll also reveal some inner 
behefs that computers can also make an insane mess. Or may- 
be it's just the plot of a future television program DeGuere 's 
fantasizing about. Maybe there's another Terry out there. Who 
knows? 

"The right person with a micro could bring the entire world 
to a standstill," DeGuere explains. "Just think. Someone with 
enough expertise could shut down the defense department's 
early warning system, short-circuit all the supermarkets' bar- 
coding computers, wipe out the air traffic controllers' comput- 
erized flight plans, and rob all the banks. It's farfetched, but 
it's possible." 

DeGuere 's eyes go a bit wild for a second, and then they re- 
flect astonishment. "You're looking at me as if I'm planning to 
do that!" he accuses and then smiles, a little bit too slowly. 

"Don't worry. I haven't got the time." 

Simon and Simon will be on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. Check your

Wouldn't You

RAM? 

PART 2 OF AN OVERVIEW 
OF RAM CARDS 

Bv JEFFREY mm 

Last month, we looked at the Apple Language Card and 
some of the other 16K RAM boards. With some powerful soft- 
ware to back it, the trend is now moving towards larger mem- 
ory expansion— such as the 32K board described in part 1. Be- 
yond that, there's a new entry in the field— the 64 KC card from 
Legend Industries. Using the latest, state-of-the-art, 64K mem- 
ory ICS, this board provides four times the storage of the Lan- 
guage Card for less than double the price. A Memory Master 
utility program is included with the board, and a Disk 
Emulator program is also available. 

The Hardware. Because it uses the higher-density 64K 
memory chips, the 64 KC board is no larger than a 16K board. 
Installation is the same as for a 16K board, involving the re- 
moval of one IC from the motherboard. The 64K chips actually 
draw less power than the 16s, although they use the +12 sup- 
ply. What this means is that you should evaluate carefully the 
total power requirements of the motherboard and all periph- 
erals so as not to exceed the Umits of the power supply. 

Like other RAM boards, the 64KC can be installed m any 
slot and will simulate a Language Card when in slot 0. In fact, 
the 64KC looks just like four 16K boards bank-switched into the 
same slot. One of the four banks is enabled by poking a value 
between 0 and 3 to location $C084. Of course, each of these 
banks contains two 4K sub-banks for the address range SDOOO- 
$E000 (see figure 1). , * 

The price of a 64KC is $349. But a considerable portion of 
this amount goes for the 64K memory chips, which are new de- 
vices and therefore relatively expensive. If past experience 
holds true, you can look for this price to drop as chip produc- 
tion increases. It seems only yesterday that 16K RAMs were 
selling for $25 apiece. Today they cost about $2 (in small quan- 
tities) , which is a 92 percent reduction in less than three years. 
By rights, the 64K board should replace 16K boards within a 
year. Don't think this is the end either— 256K RAM chips are al- 
ready in the works! As always, the key to these boards' suc- 
cess will lie in the software. 

Software. Two impressive programs are included with the 
64KC board. The first is a demonstration that loads eight hi-res 
pictures into the RAM card from disk. This process takes 
about 73 seconds. Then the images are sequentially read back 
from the RAM board into the hi-res screen memory for view- 
ing. This is accomplished by means of a simple machine-lan- 
guage, block memory move routine. Since the transfer is from 
RAM to RAM, the entire sequence can be displayed in one sec- 
ond. The speed of this technique could open up some new areas 
in animation or game displays. 

The second program is called Memory Master. Basically 
this program allows you to move DOS into one bank of the 64K 
board. Doing so frees up 8.5K of RAM as a short driver routine 
and the file buffers are left on the motherboard. Several other 
features are also added, including four new DOS commands. 
Running Memory Master is as simple as answering three 



THE 

GENERAL MANAGER 

THE SHORT CUT TO YOUR DATA PROCESSING NEEDS 



• Easy to use-The General Manager was designed to 
be the most user oriented data base program 
available for the Apple II. 

• Generates standard text files that can be used with 
your word processor, accounts receivable, or other 
business programs. 

• Supports Applesoft programs you write. 

• Complete tutorial and reference manual. 




• Instantaneous access to any info in your data 
base. 



Fully interactive data base-Information from one 
screen may be used as part of another screen or 
used to make comparisons or build totals on 
another screen. 



Change or modify your reporting files as your needs 
change without having to rebuild the data base. 



Some data base programs let you perform calculations so you 
can easily handle economic projections, sales forcasting, and 
cost accounting. Other data base programs give you a wide 
range of search and selection options so you can find the 
information you need to make daily decisions. Still others format 
the screen for easy data entry so anyone can use the data 
base. But now, one data base program PUTS IT ALL TOGETHER. 

THE GENERAL MANAGER is designed after large main frame 
programs. The hierarchial structure allows each screen display 
to interrelate with the total data base. You design your own 
screens, and then fill them in. It's just like working with a set 
of blank forms. Information from one screen can be auto- 
matically used in any other screen. Each entry can be used 
in complex calculations to figure costs, interest, payment terms, 
discount rates, recipe proportions, and many more. Data built 
on one screen can be easily used to make comparisons or 
build totals on another screen. 

THE GENERAL MANAGER will interact with other Apple 
programs. It can generate standard text files of the complete 
data base or selected fields, which can be used by word 
processors. You can use ONE data base for accounts receivable, 
customer billing, and by linking to a word processing program, 
generate form letters and mailing lists. You also have the 
ability to write standard Applesoft programs that can go into 
THE GENERAL MANAGER, access selected information and 
use that information for anything you want. 



THE GENERAL MANAGER is easy to use. Once your data base 
is created all data entry is self prompting. AND the creation 
of the data base is as simple as drawing up a blank form. A 
complete tutorial and reference manual leads you through 
the many uses of THE GENERAL MANAGER and presents a 
number of solid application programs. Plus you can change 
and modify your reporting files as your needs change without 
having to rebuild the data base. 

THE GENERAL MANAGER is designed to work FOR you. 
You mold it to your operation and it gives you the information 
you need, when you need it, in just about any format you 
want it. 

THE GENERAL MANAGER, a data base management program 
that finally BRINGS IT ALL TOGETHER for only $99.95. 

THE GENERAL MANAGER runs on any 48K Apple II or II Plus with single 
or multiple disk drives and is available at your local computer store or 
order direct by sending $99.95 plus $1.00 to cover shipping and handling

questions: What slot is firmware card in? What slot is 64KC 
card in? Which bank should DOS go into? 

Responses to the last two questions tell the program where 
to put DOS. The first question allows you to put an Applesoft or 
Integer ROM card in any slot and have DOS recognize it. This 
makes both languages immediately available without your 
having to load a RAM board from disk and/or give up one bank 
of the 64KC board. 

The only changes to DOS are that the init command no 
longer works and the catalog command now displays the num- 
ber of free sectors. The best part of Memory Master, however, 
is the new commands it adds to DOS: 

.F or .flipdos — This command allows you to switch between 
3.2 and 3.3 since both DOSs have been loaded into the 64KC. 
The command can be used at any time and does not disturb 
any program in memory. Thus, it's an easy way to move pro- 
grams from thirteen-sector disks to sixteen-sector disks and 
back. Like other DOS commands, this can also be executed in 
the deferred mode with the usual PRINT "control-D .F". 

.S or .showdos — This command will display a message 
showing which DOS is currently in use. 

.B or .bstat — This will give the starting address and length, 
in hex, of the last binary file bloaded. This information is 
necessary for transferring or examining binary files. 

.M or .monitor — Here's a quick way to get into the machine 
language monitor. It does the same thing as a Call -151, but 
it's easier to type. 

Disk Emulator. The Disk Emulator program uses from one 
to six 64KC boards to emulate up to three disk drives. Each 
board represents half a disk; thus, two boards are needed to 
emulate a disk. If you buy the two boards at the same time, 
this software is included; otherwise it sells for $50. 

Emulating a disk involves setting up one or more 64KC 
RAM boards to appear as a disk drive or drives (see figure 1) . 
Then DOS must be informed of any new drives. This is accom- 
plished by a set-up portion of the program that asks for the slot 
number of all RAM boards. Each pair can be assigned any slot 
number (0-7) and drive number (0-1) for recognition by DOS. 
As with Legend's other software, Applesoft/Integer ROM 
cards are supported in any slot. Executing Disk Emulator and 
configuring it for your system can also be accomplished by a 
Turnkey program that's supplied. This can be made the Hello, 
or greeting program, so that it will run automatically when the 
disk is booted. 

Normal Apple diskettes are formatted into 35 tracks, with 
the DOS image occupying the first three. This leaves 32 tracks 
for storage, including one for the directory. In DOS 3.3, each 
track contains sixteen sectors with each sector representing 
256 bytes. Thus 32 tracks X 16 sectors X 256 bytes = 131,072 
bjdes of data on one diskette. This works out to exactly twice 
the amount of memory on the 64KC board. Thus it takes two 
boards to hold all the data on one diskette. 

One of the easiest ways to use the Disk Emulator is with the 
special mount command. After the emulator has been in- 
stalled, you can issue a command such as .M1,S6,D1. This 



command will cause the entire diskette in slot 6, drive 1 to be 
copied into emulator #1. This takes less than 18 seconds and 
when it's done, a perfect copy of the disk will appear in RAM. 

Standard DOS commands can now be used to access and/or 
change the data at very fast speeds. Since there's no motor to 
speed up, head to position, or media to read, access can some- 
times appear to be immediate. You'll appreciate the speed 
when you catalog the emulated drive and see the results on the 
screen before your finger leaves the return key. Since access to 
the RAM-based, emulated drive is handled through DOS, al- 
most any program designed for disk use will work without 
modification. All of the typical disk utility programs, such as 
Disk Zap, and FID, will work normally, but a lot faster. 

An interesting illustration of the Disk Emulator's power is 
the Animals program supplied by Apple on the DOS System 
Master. This program uses a random access disk file to ac- 
complish a binary-tree search. After each question is pre- 
sented and is answered by the user, the disk starts up again to 
get the next question. This makes for a lot of disk action and 
thus a slow search. With the Disk Emulator, there's almost no 
delay between questions, so the search proceeds at a much 
quicker pace. Of course, more serious business programs or 
disk sorts can also take advantage of the extra speed. 

After changes have been made to the RAM image of a disk- 
ette, the entire image can then be transferred back onto the 
real floppy diskette with the update command. This is similar 
in syntax to the mount command. By the way, in case some- 
thing should go wrong and the emulator appears to discon- 
nect, you can reinitialize the Disk Emulator without destroy- 
ing any data in the RAM boards. 

If you only have one 64KC board, or install one in slot 0 to 
hold whichever Basic isn't in ROM, then it's not possible to 
hold an entire disk in RAM. Legend has taken this into account 
with their Special Format program. This program makes it 
possible to format disks in such a way that the disks only use 
those sectors that your system can mount and update. 

In Summary. With a plethora of 16K RAM boards, many" 
32K boards, and now a 64K RAM board, there can be little 
doubt that most Apples will venture beyond the 48K limit of 
motherboard RAM. Although there are other advantages, one 
of the key features of the Apple III and most of the new micro- 
computers is larger memory capacity. This may no longer be 
seen as an advantage when it becomes possible to put 256K or 
more on an Apple II. 

Although bank swapping is not the most efficient way to ex- 
pand memory, it does work. With the appropriate software, a 
great deal can be done. Multi-tasking operations such as print 
spooling (allowing the computer to operate normally while at 
the same time sending out data to the printer) may be possible 
with the added memory. 'Certainly, memory hungry pro- 
grams such as VisiCalc will be able to take advantage of extra 
space. Extended RAM may also find use in conjunction with 
other peripheral boards, such as video display generators or 
co-processors. 

To coin a phrase, "You ain't seen nothin' yet!"

Td Make Your Apple More Flexible 



Before the Apple II was reborn with 
autostart ROMs, Apple II Pluses, and In- 
teger Cards, a greater degree of consis- 
tency existed amongst Apples. In par- 
ticular, there was only one Monitor ROM, 
the chip labeled F8, containing the prim- 
itive I/O routines and operating system 
used when the computer is first turned on 
and when it's in Basic. 

Then came the autostart ROM and 
things changed. The autostart ROM of- 
fered definite advantages in turnkey

operation and improved cursor move- 
ment, but there was a price to pay. Gone 
were the single step, trace, and minias- 
sembler functions used by machine lan- 
guage programmers (who were at this 
point becoming a small minority of Ap- 
ple owners) . A change in the operation of 
the reset key made that key more versa- 
tile but, in the process, stripped away 
some of its power. The old reset could be 
counted on to return the computer to a 
known state; with the new Monitor, the 
reset key could be disabled or, worse yet, 
could cause the computer to hang up. 

If you've ever had to turn off the com- 
puter to regain control, losing any data 
that might be in RAM, you've probably 
been a victim of the autostart ROM. For- 
tunately, this doesn't happen too often 
and most people feel that the benefits of 
the new Monitor outweigh its shortcom- 
ings. In fact, since most Apple lis sold to- 
day are Pluses, many people are un- 
aware that things were ever any differ- 
ent. Rather than debate the pros and cons 
of these two ROMs, suffice it to say that 
there are both, and they aren't neces- 
sarily the same for each person. 

This article will show you some sim- 
ple, inexpensive hardware and software 
modifications you can make that will add 



flexibility to your Apple, whether it be a 
standard or a plus, with or without the 
Language System. 

The arrival of Applesoft/Integer ROM 
cards made things a little more compli- 
cated. Each language now had a differ- 
ent Monitor. This brings up the first hard- 
ware modification you can make. If you 
have a ROM board, remove it from your 
computer and examine the area just to 
the right of the 74LS09 chip at location B3 
(see photo 1). You should see a blob of 
solder within a circle labeled F8. This sol- 
der makes a connection between two 
semicircular pads on the circuit board. 
With this connection, the rightmost ROM 
on the card (labeled F8 at location A6) is 
active whenever the ROM card's lan- 
guage is in use. However, by removing 
the solder and thereby breaking this con- 
nection, you can select the F8 (Monitor) 
ROM on the motherboard to be active at 
all times. For example, with the auto- 
start ROM on the motherboard and the 
ROM card F8 connection broken, you can 
have the autostart features with both lan- 
guages. By placing a switch across the 
connection, you could gain access to the 
F8 ROM on the ROM board. 

Enter the Language Card. Next, Ap- 
ple introduced the Language System,

which included a 16K RAM board to re- 
place the ROM board (if you had one) in 
slot 0. The language card also contained 
an autostart ROM, which permanently 
disabled the Monitor ROM on the 
motherboard. Again, people discovered 
that they had to pay a price for the new 
features of the Language System. This 
time the price was the need to load the al- 
ternate Basic from disk and to give up 
the nonautostart ROM, if there was one, 
on the motherboard. If nonautostart 
operation was really needed, it was pos- 
sible to swap that ROM with the one on 
the language card, but that was a bur- 
densome chore at best. 

Fortunately, there's another way of 
dealing with the problem — hardware 
modification number two. Apple decided 
not to give you this option but, by adding 
a simple switch, you can gain access to 
both Monitor ROMs. This modification is 
shown in photo 2. It should cost less than 
a dollar and take about ten minutes — in- 
cluding the time for the soldering iron to 
warm up. The only parts required are an 
SPDT (Single-Pole Double-Throw) tog- 
gle switch and six inches of small 28 to 30 
gauge wire (the kind used for wire wrap- 
ping is ideal). A low wattage, fine-tipped 
soldering iron and rosin core solder 
should be used for all connections. 

Here is the exact procedure: 

1. Cut the wire into three two-inch 
lengfths and strip all ends. Connect one 
wire to each terminal of the SPDT 
switch. 

2. Remove the 74LS20 chip at loca- 
tion A5 on the language card. Locate pin 5 
of this chip and carefully bend it outward 
(see photo 3) . 

3. Connect the wire from the center 
(wiper) terminal of the switch to pin 5 of 
the chip. 

4. Connect one of the other wires to 
pin 7. This must be done very carefully; 
just tack-solder the wire to the top of the 
pin where it goes into the chip. Do this as 
quickly as possible so as not to damage 
the IC. Also, avoid getting any solder on 
the lower two-thirds of the pin, since it 
must go back into the socket. 

5. Carefully insert the remaining wire 
into the IC socket hole where pin 5 of the 
chip would normally go. For a good con- 
nection, the wire should go straight in 
and fit snuggly. 




Photo 3 

6. Continue by putting the IC back in- 
to its socket. Note that pin 5 no longer 
goes into the socket and indeed should be 
kept clear of the wire coming out of its 
hole. 

7. Rotate the switch a few times to 
twist the leads together and then glue the 
switch to the board as shown in the pho- 
to. If needed, you can add a small object 
between the switch and the board to act 
as a standoff ; this will allow the switch to 
be centered in the cutout of the Apple's 
case behind slot 0. Before mounting the 
switch you may also wish to check out the 
modification and verify that you've 
mounted the switch in such a way that it 
will indicate properly which ROM is ac- 
tive. With the switch up, the language 
card (autostart ROM) should be se- 
lected. 

Although this modification will cer- 
tainly void your warranty, you can re- 
store the board to its original state by 
simply removing the switch and replac- 
ing the IC with a new 74LS20. Note that 
it's possible the computer may hang if 
you change the switch while it is run- 
ning, but there's no danger of harming 
the computer, and most of the time you 
can make the switch without upsetting 
the system. 

Monitor in RAM. The preceding mod- 
ification takes care of selecting which 
Monitor ROM will be active when you're 
using the motherboard language. When 
you switch to the alternate Basic on the 
language card or other 16K RAM board, 
you'll normally find yourself with auto- 
start operation, no matter which position 
the switch is in. This is because the 
switch has no effect when the language 
card is active. In fact, neither the F8

Monitor ROM on the motherboard nor 
the one on the language card is enabled. 
Instead, the $F800-$FFFF' space of the 
RAM on the language card is being used. 
This space is loaded with an image of the 
autostart Monitor at the same time that 
Basic is loaded by the DOS 3.3 Hello pro- 
gram. This image is contained within the 
files INTBASIC and FPBASIC. 

Because the Monitor is stored in 
RAM, not ROM, it can be modified. This 
modification is accomplished by creat- 
ing two new files that will also load Basic 
into the language card but with the non- 
autostart Monitor. Actually, you'll only 
have to create one file. Which one de- 
pends upon whether you have an Apple II 
or Apple II Plus. 

Apple II. Throw the language card 
switch down to revert to nonautostart op- 
eration. If you have not made this modi- 
fication, temporarily remove the lan- 
guage card. Boot the 3.3 System Master. 
You should be in Integer Basic. Type the 
following: 

>BLOAD FPBASIC,A$2000 <cr> 
>CALL -151 <CR> 
.*3D0G <cr> 

Replace the System Master with 
another disk that has at least fifty free 
sectors, then type, 

>BSAVE FPBASiC,A$2000,L$3000 

and return. If this disk does not already 
have the language card loading program 
(called Applesoft on the System Mas- 
ter) , transfer it now. Your disk will then 
load Applesoft with the old Monitor when 
booted (make sure the greeting program 
is in Applesoft or else type FP after boot- 
ing). Don't forget to label the disk ac- 
cordingly. 

Apple II Plus. The first thing you must 
do is find a source for the nonautostart 
Monitor. Your source can be either an In- 
teger ROM card or perhaps a friend who 
has an old Apple. Insert the Integer card 
or use a standard Apple to achieve non- 
autostart operation. Then repeat the 
steps above but substitute INTBASIC for 
FPBASIC. The language card loading 
program you'll need is the one called Hel- 
lo on the System Master. 

The Language Card and DOS 3.3. 
Another feature Apple added with DOS 
3.3 was the automatic destruction of 
whatever is on the language card when a 
new disk is booted. Presumably this was 
done to ensure that any foreign program 
or data on the language card would not 
be mistaken for Basic. This means, how- 
ever, that it takes an extra fifteen sec- 
onds every time you boot. If this delay 
annoys you, then this next modification is 
a must. It is a small software change to 
the DOS and is accomplished with the aid 
of the Master Create program on the Sys- 
tem Master. It goes like this: 

>BLOAD MASTER CREATE <cr> 
>CALL -151 <cr> 
*080D:4C <cr> 
*800G <cr> 



*1BCD:20 <cr> 
*82DG <cr> 

If you have a disk zap program, an alter- 
nate way to modify DOS is to change byte 
CD of track 0, sector 9 to a $20. This mod- 
ification will cause the language card to 
be loaded when the computer is first 
turned on. Subsequent booting of any disk 
modified in this way will not reload the 
language card — unless the language that 
was on the language card has been 
wiped out by some other program. 

The Final Touch. Another tool for 
more efficient operation is the language 
card quick-loader. This program is sold 
under various names and its purpose is 
to load Basic into the language card 



much faster than the normal DOS 3.3. Hel- 
lo program does. That this is possible 
should not be a surprise; you see the 
same speed whenever you boot the Ba- 
sics disk. With this utility you can shave 
about thirteen seconds off the normal 
nineteen seconds that it takes to boot a 3.3 
disk and load Basic into the language 
card. 

All the hardware and software modi- 
fications presented in this article are de- 
signed to make your Apple more flexible 
and efficient. None will make a profound 
change in your computer. But all are 
simple, low in cost, and easy to per- 
form — making them well worth the time 
and money spent.

ARTSCI explains why some 
word processing systems 
are better than others. 



Let's begin with an easy to understand explanation of what a word 
processor is and how ARTSCI has created a professional system. 



A word processing system is simply 
an easier, faster and less expensive way 
to type. With a modern word 
processor, documents are entered on a 
video screen instead of paper. 

You can enter your first rough draft 
without concern about errors or 
spelling. Simply go back and insert 
letters, delete words and even move 
paragraphs with a few keystrokes. No 
document will ever have to be retyped. 

WORD PROCESSING 
AND THE APPLE II 

The APPLE 11 is the most 
expandable, inexpensive micro- 
computer available today. It can 
perform almost any task, including 
word processing. 

The standard APPLE II however, 
uses a 40 column video display. This 
display causes a serious word 
processing problem: How do you 
display a full sized 80 column letter? 
Most word processing programs 
available today do not solve this 
problem. 




THE MAGIC WINDOW 

ARTSCI has developed the MAGIC 
WINDOW word processing system 
that incorporates the full power of a 
professional word processor and solves 
the APPLE'S display problem without 
expensive hardware. 

The first feature of a professional 
word processing system is the ability to 
enter and edit data in a fast and 
friendly manner. The MAGIC 
WINDOW operates just like a 
standard typewriter. The electronic 
paper moves to the left across the 
video screen as you type. Almost any 
size document can be represented on 
the video screen. You can see the edges 



of the paper through this MAGIC 
WINDOW as you type 

The rule is: What 
you see on the screen ""SiSJ 
is what you'll get in 
print. However, 
if you print using 
proportional spacing, 
the result will look even 
better than the screen. 



This typewriter simulation, together 
with simple to use menu selection of 
functions and electronic editing 
abilities, creates the finest word 
processor available on the standard 
APPLE II. 

MAGIC SPELL 

The second feature of an advanced 
word processor is the ability to find 
and correct mistakes. The most 
common mistakes in most documents 
is the misspelled word. 

ARTSCI's MAGIC SPELL program 
will take any document you can create 
and find spelling errors. Over 14,000 
commonly misspelled words are known 
to MAGIC SPELL. You can also add 
new words to the vocabulary at any 
time.

The third feature of a professional 
' word processing system is the ability 
to alter a document by replacing 
names and other related data from 
mailing lists. 



Form letters, invoices, and almost any 
document can be individualized by 
replacing names, addresses or any 
other personal data anywhere in the 
document using ARTSCI'S BASIC 
MAILER. 

By using the BASIC MAILER you 
can take any mailing list and sort 
through the list by different criteria 
and print personalized letters with a 
few simple keystrokes.

It is not enough just to know an arbitrary selection of op- 
tions or commands when using any tool, program, or pro- 
gramming language. Equally important are the techniques 
with which the options are combined to achieve results. 

With time and practice you will develop your own skills at 
creating efficient machine language routines, but that process 
can be assisted by examining the techniques that others have 
developed in previous programming efforts. 

The intention of Assembly Lines has been, and will con- 
tinue to be, to provide a reasonable mix of programming tech- 
niques along with the usual ration of new commands. 

Relocatable versus Non-relocatable Code. There were, in 
an earlier issue, two print subroutines for the output of text to 
the screen or disk text file. The disadvantage of both routines 
was that they were not relocatable. To see what this means, 
consider the following program:

The first statement of this type occurs on line 11. The JSR to 
PRNT ($30D) will only work so long as PRNT is at $30D. If the 
routine were to be loaded into memory at $400, instead of $300, 
the routine would take the JSR to a block of nonexistent code 
at $30D. 

Likewise, the JMP on line 15 has the same difficulty as does 
the DATA,X statement on line 21. Any attempt to run the code 
at an address other than $300 will result in disaster. 

It should be noted, however, that JSRs and JMPs are not 
universally troublesome. The JSR COUT (SFDED) will 
execute properly no matter where the object code is located, 
since the reference is to a location outside the object code block. 

The general rule, then, is that any code whicn makes refer- 
ence to absolute addresses within itself will not be relocatable, 
whereas code that does not suffer from this limitation can be 
run anywhere in memory. 

The problem of relocatability may seem slight, since any 
given routine is usually designed to be put at a definite loca- 
tion—usually either at $300 or at the top of memory— and then 
protected via the Applesoft himem: statement. However, as the 
number of routines you use increases, you will encounter more 
and more conflicts between routines originally written to oc- 
cupy the same memory ranges. In addition, it is also occa- 
sionally desirable to append machine code directly to the end 
of Applesoft programs, where they will float up and down in 
memory at the end of the Basic portion of the listing, being 
automatically moved as lines are added or deleted. 

For these reasons, it is better in the long rxin to write code to 
run anywhere in memory when possible, thus avoiding future 
headaches about where to put everything. 

The remainder of this article will discuss the various ways 
of avoiding the use of absolute addressing, thus creating code 
that can be used anywhere in memory, regardless of the ORG 
statement used at assembly time. 

JMP Commands. This is an example of a common use of 
the JMP command to jump over a range of memory, here rep- 
resented by the FILL section. At the destination, EXPT, the 
bell routine is called as a trivial example of where a subrou- 
tine might be executed.

This program, as written, can only be run at the location 
specified by the ORG statement, in this case $300. Thus it is 
called nonrelocatable code. Machine code becomes nonrelocat- 
able through the use of any statements which involve abso- 
lute addressing. The most corhmon examples are the JMP and 
JSR commands, and the use of data statements, usually in 
print routines. 



0307: 60 

An alternative to this is the use of a forced branch 

statement, as shown in this example:

Notice that by clearing the carry, and then immediately ex- 
ecuting the BCC, the same result is obtained as when the JMP 
command was used in the earlier listing. 

The main caution to observe is that the jump is not made 
over a distance greater than 127 bytes, although most assem- 
blers will give an error at assembly time if this is attempted. In 
addition, since the carry is cleared to force the branch, rou- 
tines that set or clear the carry to indicate certain conditions 
may have compatability problems with this approach. 

Both limitations can be overcome by slight modifications to 
this listing. The first is by using the overflow flag, often repre- 
sented by a V. You should remember that the status register of 
the 6502 contains certain flags that are conditioned by various 
operations. These flags can be checked and appropriate re- 
sponse made, depending on their status. Examples of flags al- 
ready covered are the carry and zero flags. 

The overflow flag is another bit in the status register which 
is set either by the BIT command (the overflow flag is set to bit 
6 of the memory location) or by an ADC command. The over- 
flow will be set whenever there is a carry from bit 6 to bit 7 as a 
result of an ADC operation.

These details are mentioned only in passing at this point, 
and you need not be concerned if it is not entirely clear. The 
main reason for bringing it up is that the overflow flag is used 
much more infrequently than the carry and thus is a slightly 
more desirable flag to use when creating a forced branch. 

To make jumps over distances greater than 127 bji:es, a 
stepping technique can be used. This is done by creating a se- 
ries of branch commands throughout the code to facilitate the 
program flow from one part to another. It is generally not too 
difficult to find breaks between routines in which to insert the 
branch statements required for the stepping action. 

Both techniques are illustrated here:

Although only one step is shown here, any number may be 
used, depending on what is required to span the distance. 

Where Are We? Solving the JMP problem is only the begin- 
ning of the task. Very often it is important to know just where 
in memory the code is ciorrently being run. One example of this 
is the code present on the disk controller cards. Since the card 
can be put in one of seven slots, and since each slot occupies a 
unique memory range, some technique is required to answer 
the question. Where are we?

The success of this routine is based entirely on the predict- 
able nature of the stack and its function whenever a JSR 
is executed. 

The stack was briefly described in an earlier issue (June 
1981) . At this point a little greater detail is recommended. The 
stack is a reserved part of memory from $100 to $1FF. It is 
used as a temporary holding buffer for various kinds of infor- 
mation required by the 6502 microprocessor. Information put 
on the stack is always retrieved in the opposite order from 
which it was deposited. This is often called LIFO— last in, first

out. The analogy of a stack of plates was used earlier, but the 
time has come to examine what actually occurs. 

Whenever a JSR is done, the stack is used to hold the ad- 
dress to which the return should be made when the RTS is en- 
countered. The following diagrams illustrate this. Location 
$FF58 is a simple RTS in the Monitor ROM that will be used to 
set up a dummy return address. Before the JSR, the stack 
pointer is set to some arbitrary position in the stack. Upon ex- 
ecuting the JSR, the return address of $302 is put on the stack, 
and the stack pointer is decremented two bytes. Note that the 
stack stores the data from the top down, advancing the pointer 
as new data is added. When the RTS is encountered (immedi- 
ately in the case of $FF58) , the stack pointer is returned to its 
original position and the return made. 

Note that the address stored $302 is the last byte of the JSR 
command — or, put another way, one byte less than the ad- 
dress of the next immediate command following the JSR. 

Upon retxirn from the JSR, the stack pointer is transferred 
to the X register with the TSX command on line 13. Because 
the stack pointer is at the next available byte on the stack, this 
will also point at the high-order byte of the return address still

ly. In the meantime, consider this altered version of the Loca-

What we've done here is decrement the X register (line 14) 
immediately after the TSX statement, so the low-order byte of 
he address can be retrieved first. The INX is then later used to 
go back and get the high-order byte. The advantage of this sys- 
tem is that it makes adding an offset much easier

After calling the dummy return statement, a forced branch 
over the data section is done. This will have no effect on the ad- 
dress remaining on the stack. At CONT, we take the general 
procedure used in Locator #2, and add the CLC and ADC state- 
ments needed to add an offset to the address on the stack. What 
we need is the starting address of the ASCII data to be printed. 
Since the data starts at $306 and the address on the stack is $302 
(see earlier examples) the offset needed is #$04. 

This may seem arbitrary, but the value to add will always 
be #$04 if you always do the CLV, BVC $XXXX branch imme- 
diately after the return and follow that with the data to be 
printed. 

Once the actual address of the ASCII data has been calcu- 
lated, it is printed in the PRNT section by use of the indexed 
pointer at LOOP. 

JSR Simulations. You might get the impression from the 
above example that a tremendous code expansion takes place 
to accomplish the relocatability of a program. This is some- 
what true but depends on how you write the program. The use 
of CLV, BVC $XXXX only takes three bytes, whereas the JMP 
$XXXX it was replacing also used three bytes. 

The stack operations just discussed take a small number of 
bytes to implement but could become rather large if used 
many times. What is needed is a way to put the stack opera- 
tions in a subroutine. Unfortunately, the JSR is one of the non- 
relocatable commands.

This routine is very similar to the nonrelocatable JMP 
demo presented earlier, with the exception that the call to the 
BELL routine has itself been made a subroutine, headed by the 
label TEST. In this listing, TEST is followed by a dummy NOP 
statement, but we'll fill that in shortly.

This program is very similar to the Print #1 program, with 
two exceptions. First, #$03 is added instead of #$04 to the ad- 
dress on the stack. This is a subtle point worth mentioning, and 
you should review the listings until you feel comfortable with 
what is being done. Remember that the return address for a

5) Turn on the rocker switch and a built-in, red, ready light comes on. 6) You are 
all set to "COOL IT " This switch also turns your computer "off" and "on," 



JSR/RTS is always one less than the address you want to re- 
turn to. In the case of the DATA statement, we needed to know 
the exact address of the first character of the string to be print- 
ed. Hence the difference in the offset value used in each case. 

Once the offset has been added and the proper return ad- 
dress calculated, the FIX section uses the PHA commands to 
put these on the stack. Thus when the RTS is encountered, the 
program returns to DONE. Notice that we have seemingly vio- 
lated two general rules of machine language programming. 
The first is using the PHA commands without corresponding 
PLA statements, and the second is the use of an RTS without a 
calling JSR. 

Upon further thought, however, it should become apparent 
that the two counteracted each other and that an RTS is really 
equivalent to two PLAs. 

The converse of this is to use two PLAs within a routine 
called by a JSR, to avoid returning to the calling address. This 
is equivalent to using a pop command in an Applesoft subrou- 
tine called by a gosub — but all this will be discussed in a later 
issue. 

Having thus simulated the JSR command, let's put it all to- 
gether into a rewrite of the Print #1 routine that uses calls to 
subroutines to minimize the extra code required to make the 
routine relocatable:

This program will actually rewrite the address present on 
line 22 for the LDA DATA.X statement. The method is to use 
the address on the stack to calculate the address for the begin- 
ning of the ASCII string to be printed. It is this address that we 
will eventually want to put into the code at $30F.$310 to rewrite 
the data statement. , 

After calculating the address in lines 30- 39. the program 
stores the result in PTR. The FIX section then adds the length 
of the printed string plus 5 and uses this as the Y register off- 
set to point finally to $30F. The low and high order bytes are 
then written to the code and a return done to the actual PRN 1 

"^""■The example comes with many cautions. The value on line 
42 must be appropriate to the length of the string being print- 
ed A^o the orde?of the ENTRY. DATA, and PRNT routines 
was deliberately chosen to make the rewrite as easy as possi- 
ble Extreme care must be taken whenever constructing a pro- 
gram that alters itself, but the results can be very powerful 

If vou are inclined to pursue this, study this example well 
until you are very sure why each step was done. To venfy its 
versatility, you should assemble the code for this example and 
then run it at several different memory locations. After each 
run list the code from the Monitor and see how the statement 
on line 22 has been rewritten. It's really quite fascinating! 

Indirect Jumps. To round out this article, one more tech- 
nique will be discussed. Although the stepping method using 
the forced branching can be used to span large distances it 
can get rather inconvenient to have to keep inserting the step- 
ping points throughout your code. An alternate techmque is to 
use the indirect JMP command. 

In the indirect jump, a two-byte pointer is created that indi- 
cates where the jump should be made to. The added advan- 
tage of this command is that the pointer need not be created on 
the zero page, which already is in high demand for numerous 
other uses. The basic syntax for the indirect jump is:

The system is fairly simple, basically just using the stack to 
get a base address, and then adding whatever the distance is 
between the end of the JSR RTRN statement and the destina- 
tion of the JMP() . As with some of the other systems, though, 
this distance will change as code is added or deleted between 
the two points. Consequently you may have to change the 
values on lines 20 and 24 rather frequently to keep up with your 
code changes. 

It does, however, avoid the problems associated with many 
stepping points sprinkled throughout your code, as would be 
necessary using the other alternative. 

There is one bug in the use of the indirect jump that should 
be mentioned. It is present in the 6502 microprocessor itself 
and occurs whenever the indirect pointer straddles a page 
boundary. For example, if you used the statement JMP ($06), 
the destination would be retrieved from locations $06 and $07. 
However, if you were to use JMP ($3FF), the destination 
would be retrieved from $3FF and $300. The high-order byte is 
not properly incremented by the 6502. This is usually not a con- 
cern, though, since there are generally many alternate loca- 
tions for the destination pointer. 

In conclusion, then, certain techniques can be used to pro- 
duce code which is not restricted to running at a particular ad- 
dress in memory. Although a bit harder to construct initially, 
and slightly larger in terms of final memory requirements, the 
final product is much more versatile in its applications. 

If, in the course of your experimentation, you come up with 
more compact or more easily implemented approaches to this 
problem, please send your ideas to Assembly Lines, 11021 Mag- 
nolia Blvd., North Hollywood, CA 91601, so that they can be 
shared with the other readers of this column.

WE'RE BUILDING UP SPEED 




The race has just begun 

A recent article in "INTERFACE AGE" tested 45 of the most 
used BASICs on 48 different microcomputers. That article 
judged that if you are an APPLE owner writing programs in 
APPLESOFT, you have the nineteenth fastest BASIC/com- 
puter combination tested.* 

-THAT WAS BEFORE EXPEDITER II.- 

If you're an APPLE owner with EXPEDITER 11 writing 
programs in APPLESOFT, you can now have your BASIC 
program judged second in the same comparison - with a 
minimum of effort. You need only LOAD your program, BRUN 
EXPEDITER, then save your program. 

EXPEDITER II is a new programming utility which translates 
your APPLESOFT programs into machine language, usually on 
the first try. Problem spots in the code are flagged during 
compilation. The new compiled code supports all the features of 
APPLESOFT including HI-RES graphics, shape tables, LO- 
RES graphics, defined functions and DOS commands. 
EXPEDITER II is the only compiler to support global string 
variables easily. There is no additional BASIC syntax to learn. 
The only real difference you'll notice with the new program is 
that it's faster - usually two to twenty times faster. 

Other APPLESOFT compilers are available for the 
APPLE, but none have all the features of EXPEDITER II. 
EXPEDITER II, with its new MEMORY COMPRESSION 
OPTION can reduce your compiled program size by up to 50 
percent. (Remember: a machine language program is normally 
bigger than a BASIC program that does the same thing). It's also 
compatible with MMS II** to help you solve any memory 
problems you might encounter. 



We make your compilation process easier by providing a 
symbol table and address listings for each line of your BASIC 
program. EXPEDITER II even allows you to reserve areas for 
machine language subprograms or graphics. Debugging is 
facilitated by EXPEDITER lis support of the Applesoft TRACE 
command. 

We at ON-LINE SYSTEMS believe that the APPLE II is a 
powerful machine, and we're constantly trying to make it better 
and easier to use. Thats why we offer a full line of utilities written 
by some of the best programmers in the field. The only limits we 
feel the APPLE should have, are the limits to your imagination.

t\sc (nic:po lab 

from page 28 

perceived in them a basic honesty and a minimum of hype that 
she can appreciate. 

Looking at age differentials from a different perspective — 
not of the age of the persons working in the industry, but of the 
age of the average user — she sees a need for the microcom- 
puter industry to reach more of the over-thirty population. 

A Different Kind of Atmosphere. The programmers whose 
ambience Mihm has found so delightful are Hatlak and Ros- 
tenbach, the in-house technical gurus and the authors of Lan- 
guage Plus. The pair have known each other for some time, 
and in fact both worked for the Milwaukee Railroad in sepa- 
rate divisions. 

Micro Lab has ensconced them in their own facility, away 
from the hue and cry of more mundane commerce, so they can 
concentrate on the programmers' art. This facility does not go 
unappreciated. Hatlak commutes an hour each way to take ad- 
vantage of the tools, not the least of which is seclusion, pro- 
vided in what they affectionately term the skunk works. 

Hatlak is also more likely to be the one found there during 
the normal business hours, Rostenbach having the tendency to 
work asynchronously to the normal population. 

But the pair work closely as a team, with their strengths 
complementing each other. Hatlak is more the short-term 
project programmer, being able to zap out volumes of run- 
nable code in a short period. Rostenbach, by his own admis- 
sion, is likely to anguish for as much as two weeks over the 
code that he took an afternoon to write. 

Rostenbach is content with his method, feeling that his code 
when finished will meet his minimum criteria for acceptable 
programming, and his criteria are higher than most. In addi- 
tion, he believes he makes back some of that time because his 
code requires substantially less debugging than that written in 
speedier fashion. 

He Had the Time. The way Hatlak describes the team, Ros- 
tenbach is the theoretician and Hatlak is the pragmatist. In 
fact, Hatlak serves as an anchor for the team, handling most of 
the coordination of projects. 

Hatlak came to the Apple by way of 8080 home kits and the 
TRS-80. He pursued his programming hobby while operating a 
crane for the Milwaukee Railroad. His ability to make the Ap- 
ple hum the desired tune caused his programming services to 
be in demand in the Chicago area for consulting work on spe- 
cial applications programs, the biggest projects being in con- 
junction with audio- visual graphics. 

Eventually, Goldberg approached him about doing some 
consulting work for Micro Lab. Hatlak had three weeks of va- 
cation due and took them the first three weeks of this year. For 
him it was the best of both worlds, being paid by one company 
not to work while being paid by another for working at his hob- 
by. During that three-week stint at Micro Lab, Goldberg ap- 
proached him about staying on full-time. 

For the most part, Hatlak has been involved in the polish- 
ing of software developed outside the company and submitted 
for publishing. Those kinds of activities have provided him 
with insight as to which pitfalls to avoid in his own programs, 
but they've also kept him too busy to apply much of {hat new- 
gained knowledge. 

However, Hatlak had primary responsibility for writing the 
code for Invoice Factory, a program conceived and designed 
by Goldberg. 

Compile Not, Said He, It was Hatlak who discouraged Gold- 
berg from entering the compiler fray. Supported by Rosten- 
bach, he presented a scenario that predicted that the perfor- 
mance gains from compiled Applesoft would not be as signifi- 
cant as expected. In this view, the amount of RAM, the over- 
head required, and the very machine layout militated against 
an optimal compiler that would do preparsing and interpret- 
ing before delivering compiled code. 



Rostenbach pointed out that the expansion of code required 
to compile a tokenized language like Applesoft would limit the 
advantages of the compilers. 

This analysis paved the way for Language Plu^, written 
as a joint effort by Rostenbach and Hatlak. A compilation of 
machine language routines that can be integ^rated into Basic 
programs. Language Plus offers the tailored coding of assem- 
bly language for specialized functions as opposed to the more 
general- purpose, and therefore more voluminous and ponder- 
ous, coding of a Basic language. 

In contrast to Hatlak's fidelity to the Milwaukee Railroad 
for nine years, Rostenbach followed a more circuitous route to 
Micro Lab. He took several computer classes in high school, 
learning on a PDP-8. From. there, he took a computer opera- 
tor's position at the University of Iowa, where he was able to 
observe the hardware while monitoring some computer 
courses and taking others for credit. His assignment was the 
physics department, where Dr. James Van Allen presided. 

The Creativity-Qock Conflict. From the university, he went 
to work on the Milwaukee Railroad as a clerk but was trans- 
ferred to corporate headquarters data processing when his 
skills in that area were discovered. The constraints placed by 
big companies on creative individuals began to stifle him — 
particularly the requirement to work regular hours. Like 
many programmers, Rostenbach likes to continue writing 
code when it's flowing; breaking off an effort because it was 
quitting time was alien to his nature. 

Because he had no friends when he moved to Chicago, he 
began hanging around his local computer store — Data Do- 
main in Schaumburg. Eventually, owner John Clark offered 
him a job and he jumped at the chance. Rostenbach had fallen 
in love with the Apple at first sight. It was more powerful and 
more friendly than the mini he had learned on, and working at 
Data Domain would give him a chance to get intimately ac- 
quainted with the machine. 

After a year during which he handled mostly sales, he be- 
gan developing some software in anticipation that Data Do- 
main would venture into the publishing business. When that 
eventuality didn't come to pass, Rostenbach looked for green- 
er pastures. 

In association with Harlan Felt he developed the Emergen- 
cy Medical System Mobile Intensive Care data base manage- 
ment system for Loyola University. If you read ads in the pa- 
pers carefully, you may have heard of it. It was one of the pro- 
grrams featured in Apple's campaign a while back. 

Subsequent to completing that project, he tackled a bio- 
rhythm program for the Bally home arcade machine. His goal 
was to get an assignment writing for the coin-operated arcade 
machines. When that wasn't forthcoming, he was amenable to 
Micro Lab's offer. 

Micro Lab's commitment to user-friendly software and to 
customer support was what won Rostenbach over. He's firmly 
against locking software, but felt that the policies of providing 
a backup with the package and providing liberal updating pro- 
cedures were in concert with his general philosophy. 

Enter the Closet Youth. Like Hatlak, much of his effort has 
been expended in polishing other authors' efforts, but he's look- 
ing forward to the day when their presence will be more no- 
ticeable in the Micro Lab output. 

Micro Lab actually has a third programmer, David Sous- 
son, who's attending the University of Illinois as a freshman on 
a Micro Lab scholarship. Both Hatlak and Rostenbach have 
high praise for Sousson; they described a scene wherein they 
were explaining the intricacies of data base management sys- 
tems to the youngster. By the time they were halfway through 
their explanation, it was clear that Sousson had intuitively 
grasped the information and could anticipate what they would 
say next. 

As their warranty procedures and their treatment of Sous- 
son indicate. Micro Lab is a company that considers their im- 
pact on the persons with whom they come in touch. Of course, 
the other indication is the number of new products they've got 
for your Christmas stocking this season.

Soflalk Presents 
The Bestsellers 

VisiCalc showed its heels to the field again in October, 
dominating software sales throughout the country and outsell- 
ing the second strongest program, DB Master, by roughly a 
two-to-one ratio. , , , , 

The continuing strength of VisiCalc in the Apple market is a 
story so often told that it tends to become ho-hum. It should not 
be so. VisiCalc has validated the personal computer as a use- 
ful business tool, and it's the business user who's now flocking 
into the computer stores everywhere and queuing up for the 

product. , i i. 

The number of personal computers outstanding is not yet so 
great that they make a truly significant impact in any seg- 
ment of our society. So it would be hyperbole of the basest sort 
to declare VisiCalc the universal tool. But within that segment 
of industry that has taken to the desktop computer, VmCalc 
comes near to fulfilling that claim. 

As interesting in the month of October was the ascendancy 
of DB Master to the runner-up position. This marks the first 
time in the fifteen months of the Softalk Top Thirty listing 
that business products have been both first and second on the 
list With the Christmas buying season for entertainment soft- 
ware approaching, it's far too early to herald this result as 
proving that the Apple marketplace has matured into one of

business rather than hobby users. But the conclusion is ines- 
capable that all signs point in that direction. 

DB Master's strong showing indicates in a different man- 
ner the widespread use of the Apple for more serious endea- 
vors Its sales have not come at the expense of other data base 
competitors at all. Personal Filing System is showing consis- 
tent strength in the marketplace and Data Factory continues 
to hold its own. In addition, VisiFile from Personal Software 
and Data Reporter from Synergistic are making headway. 

Similarly, the widespread sales of word processors indi- 
cates that there's more cooking in the Apple market than ar- 
cade games. Apple Writer, the hobbyist's friend, continues to 
pace the field. But there's practically no difference in sales be-

WHTAI 1^ 



DECEMBER 1981 



The success of Personal Finance Manager in the retail out- 
lets after Apple's abortive attempt to market Special Delivery 
Software only by mail is another ratification of the impor- 
tance of the conscientious retailer to the thoughtful software 
buyer. 

There were few changes of any magnitude in the special 
lists that accompany the Top Thirty. 

The Word Processor Five expanded to six when Super- 
scribe II edged in front of Word Star and Supertext II. In the 
Business Ten, VisiFile replaced BPI Accounts Receivable. 

In the Home Ten, Data Capture U.O and Financial Manage- 
ment System II rejoined the list after brief absences. 

A change of some significance occurred in the Hobby Ten, 
when TASC, Microsoft's Applesoft compiler, took over the 
market from Hayden's compiler and Expediter from On-Line 
Systems. The folks at Sensible Software, while not often plac- 
ing a program in the Top Thirty, continue to make the Hobby 
Ten their personal domain. This month three Sensible entries 
made the list. 



Apple-franchlsed retail stores representing approximately 8.1 percent of 
all sales of Apples and Apple-related products volunteered to participate In 
the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early In November to ascertain their sales 
leaders for the month of October. 

The only criterion for Inclusion on the list was number of sales made — 
such other criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer 
retailer, and personal preference of the Individual respondents were not 
considered. 

Respondents in November represented every g-eographical area of the 
continental United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in 
the index number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. 
The index number is an arbitrary measure of relative strength of the 
programs listed. Index numbers are correlative only for the month in which 
they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index rating of 90 in one 
month represents equivalent sales to an Index number of 80 in another 
month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus-or-minus 5.2 percent, which 
translates roughly into the theoretical possibility of a change of 3.62 points, 
plus or minus, in any index number.

No new programs gfrabbed high positions in the entertain- 
ment breakouts, although new entries dot the lower rungs of 
each of the three lists. 

In the Top Thirty itself, only four programs were new to the 
list. Wizardry, in its first full month of release, came in elev- 
enth. Apple's Personal Finance Manager was also a newcom- 
er to the Top Thirty. 

Two new arcade games nudging into the lower ranks of the 
Top Thirty were Falcons from Piccadilly and Space Qiiarks 
from Broderbund. 

Poised just outside the Top Thirty and apparently ready to 
make a strong run through the Christmas season are Bug 
Attack from Cavalier, Snack Attack from Data Most, a.ndFire- 
bird from Gebelli. 

Business was mixed throughout the country in October. 
Some retailers found the market slow, with users waiting to 
get a full look at all the Christmas goodies before pliuiging. 
Other dealers noticed a continuing momentum building that 
promises a record-breaking holiday selling season. Even in the 
face of the country's economic difficulties, the Apple market 
continues to hold its own and expand. JM
