Picture this. Presentation-quality bar charts, line 
graphs, and pie charts. In black and white or color. On hard 
copy or a CRT. In seconds. 

That's PFS: GRAPH. The fastest, easiest, most econom- 
ical computer graphics software package you can buy. 

For the first time ever, computer graphics 
without computer programming. 

With GRAPH, all you do is enter your information and 
specify the kind of chart or graph you want. GRAPH does 
the rest. So instead of making a lot of complicated calcula- 
tions, you can make graphics. 

GRAPH is so straightforward, you can begin 
creating graphs and charts almost immediately. 
But it also has powerful capability you can stay 
with for years to come. 

For example, you can mix and match line and 
bar graphs, stack or compare up to four bar graphs 
simultaneously, even display as many as four 
graphs on the same set of axes. 

Software that pays for the system. 

Compared to hand-drawn graphics, GRAP: 
can save you enough money on your first set 6i 
overlays to pay for itself. And over the course of a 




few months, it could save you enough to pay for the 
Apple® computer system it works on. And that includes a 
Hewlett-Packard 7470A color plotter. 

It even works with VisiCalc® files. 

GRAPH is so flexible it allows you to work with raw 
data, other members of the PFS Series, or even VisiCalc files. 

No other computer graphics package gives you all this 
capability. Combine it with the beautiful simplicity of PFS 
for information management, and PFS: REPORT for infor- 
mation analysis, and you have a software family that works 
hard without being hard to work. 

So if you're thinking about making it in pic- 
tures, go see PFS: GRAPH. It's at your computer 
dealer now. And if they don't have it, ask them to 
contact Software Publishing Corporation, 1901 
Landings Drive, Mountain View, CA 94043.

CONTEST: 

The Great 
Name-the-Shape 

Table 
Game 



Well, summer's over and it's time for the 
kids to get back to school, grown-ups to get 
back to work, and everyone to get back around 
the television for weekend football excitement 
on the gridiron. 

And speaking of grids, look at the one on 
this page; pretty dull, isn't it? Now look at pages 
144 and 145 in this issue. What you see there are 
shapes of items you might find around the 
house, in your Apple, or pretty much any- 
where. Some of them are darn obvious, others 
are not so obvious. Aha! Instant contest. 

Your task this month is to figure out what 
in the world those shapes are. Study the silhou- 
ettes on pages 144 and 145. Each one has a cor- 
responding number on the dull-looking grid on 
this page. After deciding what the shapes repre- 
sent, write down your answers on a piece of 
paper numbered from 1 to 92. 

The person who correctly identifies the most 
shapes will win absolutely nothing. However, 
that person will be entitled to select $100 worth 
of Softalk advertisers' products for his Apple. 
In case of a tie, the random number generator is 



also back from vacation to help decide the win- 
ner. Have fun!

1st Class Main 
It does everything 
but lick the stamp. 




We've made a mailing list program worthy of today's 
remarkable microcomputers. It's called Ist Class 
Mail™ — but you can use it for anything you'd keep 
on a card file, like your car's servicing history or 
your address book. And it's not only the most flexible 
mail list/ utility data base you can buy — it's also 
incredibly easy to use. 

You create the label. 

Since you're not stuck with the same old name/ 
company/ street /etc. format, you can make the label 
look like what- 
ever you want. 
And with the 
new feature that 
lets you print right on your ' 
envelopes, you not only 

save time — you give your correspondence a very 
professional look. 

Super search and sort. 

1st Class Mail™ lets you search and sort in any of 
12 different categories. So you can organize your 
mailings by zip code 
(up to 10 digits), alpha- 
betical order, state, 
company, any way 
you want. Fast. 
And if you're using 
1st Class Mail™ iov 
another type of data 
base, like a record 
collection, you can sort by whatever categories you 
choose — from String Quartets to Rhythym and 
Blues. It's extremely flexible. 



Personalized entries. 

One of the ways we've made 
1st Class Mail™ especially "user 
friendly" is by letting you 
create your own headings for 
each entry line. So your 
computer speaks your language . 




ST CLASS MHIL 
r lIRM I El TEF lESl 
PPiNTED Lrt&EL FORMAT 





The form letter feature. 

1st Class Mail™ is compatible with 
many word processors, such as 
Screenwriter II™ Applewriter II™ 
Applewriter III]" Pie Writer,^" 
and WordStar /Mailmerge™ 
lust a few simple commands and 
you can combine your form 
letters with your mailing list for pro- 
fessionally formatted documents. 
All automatically. 

Automatic entry. 

If time is money, this feature 
translates minutes directly into 
dollars. It automatically includes, 
or searches for, particular categories^ 
in each entry you record. Repetitive 
typing and sorting becomes a push-button joy. 

The special message line. 

Now you can put a special message anywhere on the 
label — in a choice of type 
styles. Whether you're 
saying ATTENTION: 
SALES MAN- 
AGER or MERRY' 
CHRISTMAS! you 
can do it automat- 
ically. And right on the envelope. 

Stop by your Continental Software dealer. Or call us 
today to find out all about 1st Class Mail™ No matter 
what you're cataloging, from a household inventory 
for insurance purposes to a 25,000 person mailing 
list, 1st Class Mail™ is the best program you can buy. 

It's true, you still have to lick the stamp. 

But we're working on it.

CONTEST WINNERS: 

Creative Readers Stamp the Staff 



Apples in History. Good news and bad 
news. The good news is that June's History con- 
test proved beyond doubt that our readers are 
definitely well read. Contest entrants ranged 
from erudite to esoteric. The bad news is that 
So/talk's contest staff clubbed it out for hours 
and couldn't agree on a winner. So, rather than 
continue walloping each other with game pad- 
dles, we decided to let the readers decide. At 
least no one will get hurt that way. 

All of your entries were historically ac- 
curate; most of them were quite probable. Then 
there were some of you who went beyond 
that — the same crowd who probably found his- 
tory to be a fun subject in school. 

George Bass of Williamsburg, Virginia, sent 
in an illustrated copy of Bass's Semi-Familiar 
Quotations, highlighted by Queen Victoria's 
well-known statement: "We are not a Muse. We 
are very Sirius." Very punny; no fun intended. 
Bass made it through the first cut, but was not 
so fortunate the second time around. 

Another almost-made-it, Raymond Adams 
of Burbank, California, time-traveled back to 
hear the Egyptian pharaoh Cheops arguing 
with urban planners: "I don't care what the 
guys in engineering say, my Apple says we can 
save a bundle if we build it with just three 
sides." 

Mike Rubin from Getzville, New York, dis- 
covered that Abraham Lincoln programmed in 
machine language (try it out):

Some of you heeded no bounds and went on 
to find some rather grisly quips. 

C. Collier of Walnut Creek, California, tried 
to win credit toward a printer with his double- 
take entry, "Sorry, son, I'd really rather have 
the Apple." It's William Tell, of course. To this 
day, Collier is printerless. 

According to Robert C. Caplan, Vincent 
Van Gogh didn't go monaural for just some 
girl "I'd give my right ear to be able to pro- 
gram in hi-res graphics." 

For their cleverness and wit (and for sheer 
nerve), the above entrants will all receive a set of 
Official Softalk Write-Protection InvisiTabs. 

Your Turn. The finalists in the History con- 
test are, alphabetically, Kathy S. Berger, Cy- 
press, California; Patricia Fitzgibbons, Long 
Beach, California; Tim and Lori Gillespie, Lin- 
coln, Nebraska; Ganesh Gupta, Kansas City, 
Missouri; John Hillman, Waco, Texas; Ken 
Hogarty, Oakland, California; Brent Iverson, 
Boca Raton, Florida; Lauretta Jones, New 
York, New York; John D. Redfield, Forth 
Smith, Arizona; Michael L. Truese, Bayonne, 
New Jersey; and Susan C. West, Coolville, 
Ohio. 



Their entries are listed in a random order 
and are numbered. Just pick which one you like 
the best, based on historical truth, probability, 
wit, and general quality of method of meeting 
requirements. Send in your vote by October 15, 
1 982, to be included in the balloting. Be sure to 
include the name of the famous person you 
think is being quoted. 

Oh, and one more thing. This is a second 
chance to win something for your Apple. Every- 
one who casts a vote and correctly names the 
speaker will be crunched through the random 
number generator. The survivor of the RNG 
will win a $10 aedit toward Softalk advertis- 
ers' goods, or some Official Softalk Write-Pro- 
tection InvisiTabs, if you prefer. 

I f you think you can name all the speakers, 
list them. In case of ties, all entries that list all 
correct speakers (and name of work if applica- 
ble) will overwork the RNG to determine the 
winner of $50 worth of bonus prizes. 

Here are the finalists:

During programs I have made

rated copy of Bug Attack." 

3. "Boot it again, Sam." 

4. Once upon a midnight dreary, while I 

programmed, weak and weary, 
My Apple's plastic keyboard taking quite a bit of 
wear — 

While I nodded, nearly sleeping, suddenly there 

came a beeping, 
As of something loudly cheeping — cheeping in 

the cool night air. 
" Tis some small birdie," I muttered, "cheeping 

in the dark out there" — 
Quoth the Apple, "♦•♦SYNTAX ERR" 

5. "What is this strange apparatus, Mr. Spock?" 

"A primitive microcomputer, Captain, de- 
veloped on late twentieth century Earth. I be- 
lieve that they were called, 'Apples.' " 



"Isn't that a bit ironic, Spock? Wasn't the ap- 
ple considered to be the fruit of the tree of the 
knowledge of good and e-Wl?" 

"Indeed, Captain, but in this case, the apple 
became a symbol of the good. Due to its accessi- 
bility, the Apple became a part of every Earth 
household so that by the end of the twentieth 
century virtually all humans had mastered the 
computer. As all humans began to speak the uni- 
versal language of the computer, the old barriers 
of race and creed were broken down, and the 
precepts of the Federation were formed." 

"So without this ancient contraption, there 
would be no Enterprise." 

"Precisely, Captain, and speaking of the En- 
terprise, I estimate the time warp through which 
we passed to close in approximately 3.27 Earth 
minutes." 

"Let's be going then, Mr. Spock." 

"After you. Captain. Live long and prosper."

7. Back came he into his dwelling, his apartment in 

the city. 

Took he then his new-bought game-disk. 

Sat before his trusty Apple, 

Turned the switch they labelled, "power;" 

With his heart held in his jerkin. 

Set the tan machine to workin'. 

He put the disk right in the disk drive, 

In the disk drive quickly spinning. 

Watched he then the disk drive spin it. 

Watched for near unto a minute. 

Then he took his new-bought game-disk. 

Took it back to where he bought it, 

Took it back and got a refund. 

8. How do I use thee? Let me count the ways. 

I use thee to the depth and breadth and height 
48K can reach, when booting DOS 
For the ends of Labor and Ideal Fun. 
I love thee to the level of every day's 
Most Basic need, with my color CRT. 
I use thee with Screenwriter, as I compose 
sonnets; 

I use thee with VisiCalc, as I compute royalties. 
I use thee with the paddles and joysticks 
Of Spanish invader games, and hi-res graphics. 
I use thee with a Drive that will preserve my love 
On write-protected disks, — I use thee with the 
breath. 

Smiles, tears, of all my life! — and, with a new 

RAM board, 
I shall but use thee better at 64K. 
9. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and 
create, modify, and print my text, and then 
I can pray. Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt 
as light as a diskette straight off, and my trou- 
bles all deleted. So I booted my Apple Writer, all 
glad and excited, and set down and entered let- 
ters to write to Miss Watson telling her about 
Jim and where he was. 

But then I used Find and Search to recall

You got a late steirt looking for that summer job, and all you could find 
was a bciker apprentice position at the Automated Bakery Company. 
Simple enough, since the pies circ made by machine ... all you have to 
do is add topping and put the pies away when they come out on the 
conveyor belt. Shouldn't be too difficult of a summer, you think to 
yourself. . .

MICROBUFFER WIU 
SPEED UP ANY PROGRAM 
THAT REQUIRES PRINTING. 



MICROBUFFER ALLOWS YOU 
TO PRINT AND PROCESS 
SIMULTANEOUSLY 

Now you don't have to wait for 
the printer to finish before you 
can use your computer again. 

YOU CAN DUMP 
PRINTING DATA DIRECTLY 
TO MICROBUFFER. 

Unlike your printer, Microbuffer 
accepts data as fast as your 
computer can send it. So there's 
never a bottleneck. 

Microbuffer first stores the 
data in its own memory buffer 
and then takes control of your 
printer. This frees the computer 
ifor more productive functions. 

Additional output may be 
dumped to the buffer at any 
time and it will be printed in 
turn. 

THERE IS A MICROBUFFER 
FOR ANY PRINTER/COMPUTER 
COMBINATION. 

Microbuffers are available in 
Centronics-compatible parallel 
or RS-232C serial versions. 

FOR APPLE II COMPUTERS, 
Microbuffer II features on-board 



firmware for text formatting and 
advanced graphics dump 
routines. Both serial and parallel 
versions have very low power 
consumption. Special functions 
include Basic listing formatter, 
self-test, buffer zap, and 
transparent and maintain modes. 
The 16K model is priced at $259 
and the 32K, at $299. 

FOR EPSON PRINTERS, Microbuffer 
is $159 in either an 8K serial or a 
16K parallel version. The serial 
buffer supports both hardware 
handshaking and XON-XOFF 
software handshaking at baud 
rates up to 19,200. Both Epson 
interfaces are compatible with all 
Epson commands 
including GRAFTRAX-80 and 
GRAFTRAX-80 + . 

ALL OTHER PRINTER/COMPUTER 
COMBINATIONS are sen/ed by the 
in-line, stand-alone Microbuffers. 
Both serial and parallel versions 
are expandable up to 256K. The 
serial stand-alone will support 
different input and output baud 
rates and handshake protocol. 
The 32K model starts at $299, 
64K for $349. 64K add-ons for up 
to a total of 256K are just $179. 

When you think of how much 
time Microbuffer will save, 
can you afford to not have one? 



SIMPLE TO INSTALL. 

Microbuffer II is slot-independent. 
It will fit directly inside the Apple 
II in any slot except zero. 

Microbuffer for your Epson 
mounts easily in the existing 
auxiliary slot directly inside the 
printer. 

The stand-alone Microbuffer is 
installed in-line between virtually 
any printer and computer. 

MICROBUFFER FROM 
PRACTICAL PERIPHERALS. 

Practical Peripherals is dedicated 
to establishing new industry 
standards for product performance. 

The un-retouched photo at left 
has been enlarged to demostrate 
Microbuffer's exact workmanship 
and precise attention to detail. 
Specifications demand that each 
board undergo 36 seperate tests 
and inspections before it can 
leave the factory. 

Ask your dealer for a demostra- 
tion of the most practical, most 
successful new product of the 
year — Microbuffer.

Fastalk is your quick guide to popular, special- 
ized, or classic software. Programs appearing in Fas- 
talk must meet one or more of the following criteria: 
(1) equal or surpass in sales the least-selling program 
to appear on any of the current bestseller lists; (2) re- 
late to a specialized subject area and be in general dis- 
tribution (more specialized packages and areas will be 
included as Fastalk matures); (3) be new and of pro- 
fessional quality (such programs will be carried for 
one month only — after that, they must meet other cri- 
teria for inclusion); (4) stand out as extraordinary. 

Designation as a classic is noted by a bullet pre- 
ceding a program's title. 

Where opinion is expressed. So/talk has seen the 
software in question; the date of Softalk's review, if 
any, is given at the end of the item. 

Softalk may arbitrarily omit any package from 
Fastalk, whether or not it meets the foregoing criteria.

At 5pinnaKer Software, we make edu- 
cational games that are actually fun 

Because they're fun, your children will 
use them. Instead of letting them collect 
dust in the basement. 

And because your children use them, 
they'll be learning. And after all, isn't that 
what educational games are all about? 

Our games are educational, because 
you can't kid parents. 

As a parent you're probably very con- 
cerned with how much time your Kids 
spend playing mindless video games. 

5ure, they're fun. But they don't do 
much more than develop reflexes and 
hand-eye coordination. 5p 
games are different. 

All our games have true 
educational value. They 
help develop a child's 
learning skills. And that's 
something your kids can 
take with them wherever 
they go. 

Our games a re fun, 
because you can't kid kids. 

Kids like Spinnaker games for the 
same reasons they like roller coasters, 
going to the beach and ice cream 
sundaes. 

They're fun. Lots of fun. 5o much fun 
your kids will probably forget they're 
learning. 

Our games make the computer 
screen come to life. With colorful graph 
ics, animation and sound.

of our games are easy enough for Kids 
who've never even used a computer 
before. 

How do we make our games both 
educational and fun? 

lA/e're glad you asked. 

Educators and game programmers 
write our software.

the classroom and know how children

interest. 

Game programmers, because they 
Know how to have fun with computers. 
These programmers give our games the 
high resolution graphics, animation and 
sound that maKe them so entertaining. 

And right now, we're introducing four 
new games that can be played on the 
most popular computers, Apple,"" Atari,'"

ages 5-9 write their own 
stories and see them 
acted out on the screen.

children learn to write 
correctly and acquaints 
them with the Keyboard. 
Our SNOOPER TROOPS'" 
detective series gives your child mys- 
teries to solve. As a Snooper Trooper, 
your child will have to do some daring 
detective worK, including crawling 
through darK houses and talKing to mys- 
terious agents.

A 

communications 
package 
that's slightly 
easier to use 
than 

MICRO/TerminaL 




But 

a lot less 
functional* 

At MICROCOM we've made communicating with 

all kinds of computers easier and less expensive. Now, with 

MICRO/Terminai; users of Apple 117 Apple IH™or IBM® 

Personal Computers can easily access any in-house or 

remote database. Directly, with a minimum of effort. 

With MICRO/Terminal, communications set-ups 

and log-on routines are entered only once. From then on 

they can be called up automatically. A built-in editor lets 

you change part of a program without re-doing all of it, 

and you can edit off-line. 

Plus you can access your company computer and more 
than 1,000 commercial services. The price? Under $100. 
So that by comparison with other systems, anything else 
is like talking through a tin can. 
Just ask your computer dealer for more details.

DISCUSSION 



Something To Kro About 

In response to Edward Badasov (August Open 
Discussion), you were not the only one hooked 
by that enticing article about RobotWar in the 
January 1981 Softalk. Much like you, once my 
"Old Kro" could consistently beat Mover and 
Bottom, I felt the excitement of RobotWar be- 
gin to fade away. 

Fortunately, I was able to promote a Ro- 
botWar tournament, thanks to the monumen- 
tal efforts of Fay Popejoy, and the compassion 
of Ren Colantoni, owner of Computerama in 
Burbank, California. Only eight people re- 
sponded, but the fun we experienced during 
those seven hours of competition has sustained 
our interest in RobotWar to where our number 
has increased to fifteen. Plus, we have spon- 
sored two more tournaments on our own. We 
are now discussing plans to establish a formal 
RobotWar club. (See the article in the July issue 
of Softline.) 

Realizing that competition is what Robot- 
War is all about. I am personally sponsoring a 
postal RobotWar tournament in October 1982. 
Entry fee will be four dollars, which will pro- 



vide prizes and cover handling charges. First 
prize will be a box of ten 3M disks. All five fi- 
nalists will receive RobotWar T-shirts. All par- 
ticipants will receive copies of the elimination 
charts which will show scores of all robots at 
each step of the tournament. Best of all, every- 
one will have a copy of the winning robot (ob- 
ject code) transferred to their disk, so you may 
observe its moves on your own battlefield. We 
have exchanged robots at all of our club tour- 
naments and I believe it contributes much to- 
ward keeping the challenge of RobotWar ahve. 

If you are interested, send for a copy of the 
tournament rules and mailing instructions. 
Please enclose a self-addressed stamped en- 
velope. By the way, Edward, I don't believe that 
the robot your friend has, which goes to the cor- 
ner and shoots at everything it sees, would sur- 
vive an encounter with "Old Kro."

Q

to hi-res graphic adventuring sounds the death 
knell for pure text adventure games. The mighty 
tide of the consumer market has so dictated, 
and A.I. has been perceptive enough to try to 
ride the crest of the wave." 

This statement is wholly unwarranted. It 
would appear, in fact, that the mighty tide of 
the consumer market is demanding at least as 
many text adventures as hi-res adventures. In 
the Adventure 5 section of "Softalk Presents 
The Bestsellers" in the same issue, numbers one, 
four, and five were Deadline, Zork I, and Zork 
II, respectively, all from Infocom. All three are 
purely text adventures. It is clear that text ad- 
ventures are not yet dead. Indeed they will never 
die, for they have many inherent advantages 
over graphic adventures. 

The first of these advantages is the amount 
of detail a text game can give you in relation to 
graphic adventures. Our language is full of won- 
derfully descriptive words, all of which are 
available to the maker of the text game to 
describe any kind of scene he wishes. 

A second advantage of text adventures is 
how well the adventure can narrate action. In 
order for a graphic adventure to do this, anima- 
tion of some sort must be used. Yet what cur- 
rent animation technique could possibly relate 
the melting of the glacier or the actions of the 
Princess in Zork II with the same detail that 
game gives it? The simple answer is that there 
aren't any. Furthermore, how well action is 
described is important in making the adventure 
fun to play, for it is action that relates to you the 
results of your handiwork. Taking away action 
takes a lot away from adventures, and it is just 
this that hi-res adventures are doing. 

There is one other advantage that text has 
over graphics: It leaves more to the imagina- 
tion. Lx)oking at simple hi-res pictures (current 
microcomputers are incapable of anything but 
simple drawings) doesn't allow your imagina- 
tion to go very far, and this limits the picture of 
the adventure you have in your mind. Text, 
while giving more detail than is possible with 
graphics, still allows room for your imagina- 
tion to fill in all that isn't described. To me, this 
is the most important advantage of text over 
graphics. Since those who play adventures are 
likely to have active imaginations, it is impor- 
tant to allow them to be used. 

In sum, text adventures are not dead. The 
simpler formats may be dead, but the more 
complex adventures by Infocom are only at a 
beginning. As more people come to realize the 
increased gaming value text games like these 
can give, they will buy them. 
Steve Golowich, Amherst, MA 

Promethean Support 

Recently I went to a sale at my local computer 
store. Since I was in the market for a Prome- 
theus Versacard and a Hayes Smartmodem, 
and since they were on sale for about 10 per- 
cent off list, I decided to buy locally rather than 
mail order. 

When I got home and read the Versacard 
manual I discovered that this version (1.2) did 
not handle interrupts. I called the number in the 
manual and found that the Versacard I bought, 
although never used, is a couple years old and 
they are now up to version 1.41. 



Now for the good part. They agreed to up- 
date my Versacard to the current version at no 
charge. They also agreed to make up a cable for 
me to connect the Versacard to the Smart- 
modem for ten dollars less than the price quoted 
by my local computer store. I shippai my 
Versacard to them by UPS, and in less than one 
week I had back not my updated card but a 
brand-new Versacard. The card works perfect- 
ly and is a real bargain at their recently an- 
nounced reduced list price. Prometheus is to be 
commended for backing their product 110 
percent.

Reviving an Old Technique 

As a computer novice I rely heavily on my user 
manuals. PFS has the most understandable 
manual I have encountered. It contains pic- 
tures, examples, and caveats written in non- 
technical lingo. On the other hand, I find that 
Magic Window/ Basic Mailer does not have pic- 
tures or many examples and is very technical for 
me. In fairness to Artsci and Mr. Bill Smith, I 
want to say that they are extremely helpful each 
time I find it necessary to telephone. 

It was once said that years ago, when about 
ready to release a new kit, Heathkit Company 
would select at random a nonelectronic-type 
employee, of average intelligence. The em- 
ployee would be given the kit and instruction 
manual, and asked to assemble the kit and 
make notes at any point that was unclear or re- 
quired an assumption. Once the problems en- 
countered were corrected, the comoany felt the 
package was ready for the average user. This 
old technique might be very helpful to some 
software houses today.

Justice Is Served 

As a small businessman (law firm of four), I 
have found Super Checkbook III by Powersoft, 
Inc., to so adequately meet our needs that I felt 
its benefits should be worthy of consideration 
by others. The program provides a comprehen- 
sive checkbook register, easy sorting of and 
searching for checks by month or year to date, 
by category (secretary, deposition costs, and so 
forth), and by payee (court reporter, landlord, 
and so on). Although only of nominal assist- 
ance to us, the program quickly graphs cate- 
gories of expenses in bar graph form. The pro- 
gram is easy to use, and our secretaries experi- 
enced no difficulty mastering the instructions. 
Data errors are easily correctable. I recom- 
mend this program's use by individuals and 
small businesses. On a final note, I might add 
that Powersoft has been extremely helpful and 
cheerful in answering our questions both times 
we phoned, and such strong support is another 
reason to consider Powersoft products. 
Ted H. Gordon, San Rafael, CA 

A Lucky Break 

Several months ago, after reviewing the avail- 
able literature and coming up with naught, I got 
lucky and found a database system, called 
TDM, in a local store. It supports computa- 



tional manipulations of dates. For example, it 
can do 12/12/82 + 10 days = 12/22/82. It is 
easy to use by untrained clerks. TDM is menu 
driven and even has a command that memo- 
rizes menus for future recalls. It features com- 
puter overwrite data in the database during re- 
port generation. The program can also com- 
bine databases, and sort to at least five levels. 

After using the system in several applica- 
tions on the Apple II and III computers, I am 
still surprised Softalk has yet to review this sys- 
tem. It is still the only system that I am aware of 
that can be used for multiproject resource-con- 
strained scheduling and reporting applications 
where due dates need to be generated. I believe 
you could do your readers a service by review- 
ing this system and save them from the frustra- 
tion that I went through just to find it. TDM 
was developed by Pascal Systems of Menlo 
Park, California. Oh, did I forget to tell you that 
TDM means The Data Machine. It's certainly 
not the worst acronym around.

Not-So-Fine Print 

As a principal of Brielle Computer Inc., an au- 
thorized Apple dealer, we are dedicated to pro- 
viding extensive customer support to assure to- 
tal satisfaction, whether it be hardware, soft- 
ware, or service. We have received recent custom- 
er inquiries about the Target PlannerCalc, 
priced at fifty dollars, that is being extensively 
advertised by Comshare Target Software of At- 
lanta, Georgia. At the recent Comdex show in 



Atlantic City, New Jersey, we even discussed this 
program with a Target representative. He as- 
sured us that there was a version written specif- 
ically for the Apple II Plus. We ordered a copy 
for our store, and upon trying to run it we were 
surprised to find that buried on page five of the 
manual was a reference that a CP/M operating 
system was required. We thai telephoned Com- 
share Target Software to verify that this pro- 
gram represented as for an Apple II Plus did in 
fact require CP/M. The Target representative 
advised us that they would call us back with the 
information. Five hours later, having received 
no call, we again called Target. This time we 
were advised that the Target PlannerCalc was 
designed for use on an Apple II Plus that had a 
64K memory, a CP/M operating system, and 
an eighty-column display. 

A review of the PlannerCalc package and 
the literature sent with it contain no indication 
of any equipment modifications that are re- 
quired in order to use the software. This type of 
misrepresentation is a disservice to the cus- 
tomers that we try to support.

Always Darkest before the Dawn 

I bought my Apple III from the Computer 
Lines store in Bozeman, Montana, because at 
that time they didn't sell any other machines, 
and they provided service under an extended 
warranty. The salesman convinced me that I 
should get the III rather than the II since the 
cost of transforming the latter into an adequate 
word processor amounted to more than the III

would cost. I was also told that all Apple II pro- 
grams would work on the III in emulation 
mode, so I laid out for the computer, 

Amdex monitor, Silentype printer, blank disks, 
rolls of paper, and the Apple Writer III word 
processing package which, I was told, was iden- 
tical to WordStar 

My six week affair has been, as many af- 
fairs are, stormy. I found that Apple Writer III 
possesses fewer features than WordStar (hardly 
identical); we had to purchase Apple Business 
Basic to begin programming; and there is a 
dreadful paucity of software for the III, and 
where it exists, it is clearly out of our price 
range. All this, plus a particularly gruesome 
story of how, when I needed a past-deadline 
article printed letter quality, there was no print- 
er within a hundred miles to do the job, sums up 
the darker picture. 

On the bright side, my seventeen-year-old 
son has learned from scratch how to make 
graphics (in the II emulation mode — the 
mysteries of Apple III graphics continue to 
elude us); my daughter pokes around on it with 
a combination of grimness and delight; and my 
wife finds the ease of the Apple Writer III en- 
joyable while lamenting the fact that there are 
no page breaks on the program. 

Since we have had such little assistance from 
our local dealer (I was so meagerly instructed in 
the ways of computer usage that I inadvertent- 
ly erased the SOS. Kernel from the backup disk 
for the Apple Writer), can you recommend any 
helpful user groups or good reference sources 
for the Apple III? 
Michael Sexson, Bozeman, MT 

In addition to The Apple Three Newsletter 
from MediaWorks (see Marketalk News in this 
issue), a good resource is the Original Apple 
liters user group which publishes a newsletter 
called The Open Apple Gazette (Box 813, San

publishes Apple III Dimensions, which you can 
have free of charge by sending your Apple III se- 
rial number or warranty card to 10260 Bandley 
Drive, Mail Stop 3-E, Cupertino, CA 95014. As 
for the page breaks, just insert .ff on a separate 
line anywhere in the text. It commands a page 
break when the text is printed. A more sophisti- 
cated command is .ffx where x is a number This 
commands the printer to make a page break if 
fewer than x lines remain on the page. 

Beyond Compare 

I look forward to your magazine each month 
above almost all others because of your cover- 
age of the superior Apple III. In fact, I am let- 
ting several magazine subscriptions expire as 
their editors do not see fit to cover the Apple 
III. 

After an exhaustive comparison between the 
IBM jx; and the Apple III, I chose the Apple 
ni. It turned out the IBM pc needed sixteen 
slots to begin to compare with the III! Since the 
IBM pc comes with only five slots, the best 
thing I could discover about it was its name! 
But it appears a name is all that is needed, as the 
IBM pc winds up costing two thousand dollars 
more than the III. 

The graphics are better on the Apple III, as 



it has sixteen colors available in color high-reso- 
lution compared to only four with the IBM pc 
(see Creative Computing, December 1981, page 
37). Even the keyboard of the Apple III is far 
superior to that of the IBM pc. It is software de- 
finable at any time, and is arranged in a strictly 
traditional typewriter layout. The IBM pc has 
both shift keys out of place, and the return key 
is too far away. Want to change the keyboard 
layout to the Dvorak American Simplified? Just 
load a file supplied by Apple. 

The bench-mark test in Byte, January 1982, 
page 54, shows the IBM pc to be 20 percent 
faster than the Apple II on the average. The Ap- 
ple III runs 40 percent faster than the Apple II 
on the average, which means it runs 20 percent 
faster than the IBM pc on the average! 
)Print fre 197618. Try that on an IBM and 
you get only 61,404 or 64K at most, even with 
256K. And SOS, with its powerfial drivers, user 
friendliness, and management of memory and 
I/O, is so far superior to CP/M or IBM's copy 
of CP/M that it is laughable. There are no com- 
mands to learn with SOS! The Apple III is also 
the first RAM-based machine, meaning every- 
thing is software definable. If you want to up- 
date a language or operating system, just load in 
a different disk. 

The design that went into the III takes it 
about five years beyond IBM's copy of older 
systems. It is just too bad the III got off to a 
poor start, but Apple rebuilt it to be even more 
reliable than the Apple II. The fact that the Ap- 
ple IV will have a 6502B for I/O processing that 
can also emulate the Apple III should contrib- 
ute a lot to the growth of the III. Do yourself a 
favor and check out the born-again Apple III!

One Man's Insult, Another Man's Tool 

In the April Softalk I read the glowing report on 
The Home Accountant by Craig Stinson. I was 
very pleased with his report and comparisons 
on the various accounting programs. Based on 
that report, I bought The Home Accountant. 
Was I disappointed and angry that I had blown 
seventy-five dollars. Norman Wood stated it 
very well in his letter in July Open Discussion. 

I was unable to accomplish the abort on 
printout and was obliged to waste paper watch- 
ing a useless printout. Also, there was no choice 
of printout to hard copy or screen copy. To re- 
view a previous month's check listing, the read- 
out only provides a reconciled balance rather 
than a running balance. Another feature that is 
nice but aggravating is the auto entries, fouling 
up the attempt at continuous reconciliation by 
making the entries at the first of the month, 
whereas the bank makes an automatic with- 
drawal twice a month. The graph feature is 
great for the screen, but has no capability for a 
hard copy printout. The crowning insult came 
at the back of the manual with the warranty 
card and request for ten dollars for a backup 
disk.

a few comments about The Home Accountant, 
which he purchased as a replacement to The 
Personal Finance Manager. I did the same thing 
but was not as disappointed. Mr. Wood did not 
find a convenient way to delete entries, but af- 
ter a good look through the manual one would 
find that it is extremely easy to delete. His com- 
ments led me to believe that he had not proper- 
ly leamed how to use the program. As to his 
statement that The Personal Finance Manag- 
er is error-free and friendly, my father had his 
books spanning a year destroyed because of a 
bug in this program. I am fourteen years old 
and have no problem at all operating The Home 
Accountant, therefore I think it should present 
no great problem for anyone else. 
Rocci Cirone, San Jose, CA 

Thrice Wise 

I recently have gone through the pangs asso- 
ciated with creating a home financial system. 
The net result is I have had to enter my data 
thrice — twice in one system and once in an- 
other. My wife and I have learned a lot during 
this encounter of a third kind and I wish to 
share my experience. 

I worked with Home Accountant by Conti- 
nental Software and The Accountant by Deci- 
sion Support Software. Both packages include 
very good documentation. The major differ- 
ence is in completeness and understanding of 
the user's point of view. The Accountant in- 



cludes a complete example both in the manual 
and on the disk. This allows the user to get a feel 
for the system. Furthermore, the manual takes 
you step by step through a demonstration of the 
accounting package capabilities, including mak- 
ing changes. This was extremely valuable to us 
and helped us avoid making a lot of mistakes in 
the development of our own system. It even 
suggests using or changing the accounts in- 
cluded for your own system. In general. The Ac- 
countant provides for easier learning. 

There is a difference, I believe, in the type of 
user that would choose either of these pack- 
ages. Home Accountant is a closed or fixed 
package, whereas The A ccountant is more flexi- 
ble or open. Home Accountant allows the crea- 
tion of a budget, prints checks, and has a varie- 
ty of other excellent options, but it stops there. 
One cannot expand the applications beyond 
those clearly defined in the package. The Ac- 
countant is more flexible since it includes an in- 
terface program for transferring data to Visi- 
Calc. This means one can create budget spread- 
sheets, tax sheets, specialized reporting for- 
mats, and use real accounting data in the analy- 
sis. In many ways the The Accountant grows 
with the user. 

The two systems differ significantly in the 
number of allowable accounts, codes, and 
transactions. Home Accountant allows up to one 
hundred accounts, has a single code for taxable 
interest and a maximum of one thousand trans- 



actions pjer accounting period (usually one 
year). The Accountant allows for sixty-three ac- 
counts and sixty-three codes, plus it can handle 
two thousand to four thousand transactions. 
My wife and I have found sixty-three accounts 
more than adequate, and the abihty to code 
across accounts, in more ways than one, a solid 
advantage. I have found coding transactions by 
taxable interest, deductible, business related, 
and so forth extremely useful. Finally, one thou- 
sand transacfions comes too soon for us each 
year. 

Both packages take several seconds to move 
from one menu option to another; however, if 
one is interested in printing something or 
searching through the transactions, The Ac- 
countant is considerably faster than Home Ac- 
countant. 

Because Home Accountant includes more 
descriptive data on each transaction and does 
check writing, I thought it would be more us- 
able. For me, it was not. Both packages keep 
good books, but The Accountant really shines in 
the analysis area given its VisiCalc connection. 
It depends on one's own needs. 

The Accountant uses double-entry account- 
ing, but was able to bypass accounting jargon 
while keeping double-entry integrity. I appre- 
ciate its ease of data entry, flexibility, speed, and 
focus on the essentials of good accounting and 
financial analysis needs.

An Author Reviews the Reviewers 

I was pleased to see mention of Micro-Golf by 
Creative Computing in the article by David 
Hunter (July Softalk). As one of Micro-Golfs 
authors, I was happy that Mr. Hunter found it a 
fun game. What I find difficult to understand is 
his criticism that the game is not educational 
due to the fact that there is no choice of clubs. 
Mr. Hunter may be familiar with miniature golf 
players who are in the habit of dragging a sack 
of clubs around but we are not. Comparing Mi- 
cro-Golf to games modeled after the kind of 
golf played on fairways and greens is unfair. 
Micro-Golf may not be for the serious golfer, but 
it is a faithful simulation of miniature golf, and 
it has proven to be the type of computer game 
that people of all ages enjoy. Adults who fear 
the fast-paced action of shoot-'em-up style ar- 
cade games enjoy Micro-Golf where they can 
take all the time they want to plan the forces 
and angles found in miniature golf. Micro-Golf 
contains a machine language subroutine that 
makes for realistic ball movement and even al- 
lows users to create and modify their own 
courses. 

I can appreciate the job that reviewers face 
when trying to condense reviews of many pack- 
ages into a single article. I would, however, sug- 
gest that your reviewers be more objective in the 
future. Present the attributes of a package and 
let your readers decide. If you feel that criticism 
is necessary, you should be willing to do a more 
thorough job than is possible in thumbnail re- 
views. You should also allow the authors of 
criticized software to respond in writing.

Logo's Limits 

I have been a student of Logo for over a year. 
This summer, I taught a five-week course for 
junior high school students. I am convinced that 
Logo is a medium for teaching and learning 
without peer among currently available alterna- 
tives. I have also designed and conducted many 
workshops for teachers in Logo for Active 
Learning Associates and, more recently, under 
the auspices of the Santa Clara, California, 
County Office of Education. I am well ac- 
quainted with the documentation and support 
provided by all three sources of Logo for the 
Apple II. I offer these credentials to support my 
opinion that the review in the July issue by Roe 
R. Adams III of the three versions of Logo for 
the Apple II was sufficiently misleading to de- 
mand some sort of erratum. 

Mr. Adams's descriptions of Apple Logo 
and Krell Logo might well have been written by 
their respective promotion departments. There 
are no factual inaccuracies in these descrip- 
tions; neither is there any hint that there are any 
weaknesses to point out. I will mention a 
couple. 

For most users, there are two important 
weaknesses of the Apple Logo package. One is 
the gap between the introductory manual and 
the reference manual. However, this gap is well 
filled in the book by Hal Abelson, Apple Logo, 
available from Byte Publications. The other is 
the fact that Apple Logo files do not allow a 



user to store pictures as do both other versions. 
You can do a dump of the graphics screen by 
crashing Logo, but you cannot use graphics files 
in the Apple Logo system. 

Krell Logo offers a plethora of resources. 
Several items on the list of their extras, how- 
ever, appear more substantial than they are. 
The two technical manuals, for example, are 
identical to the ones supplied with Terrapin 
Logo (one of which, not incidentally, is a slight- 
ly different version of the aforementioned book 
by Hal Abelson). The free one-year subscrip- 
tion is to a newsletter yet to be published by 
Krell, not to a monthly newsletter published by 
the Young Peoples' Logo Association. 

Mr. Adams's description of Terrapin Logo, 
however, is actually quite misleading. The fact is 
that the Terrapin Logo package, of all three, of- 
fers the most comprehensive documentation 
and support for the novice to Logo. Of particu- 
lar note is that its extensive tutorial manual 
covers not only turtle graphics but also list proc- 
essing primitives and a host of useful tips about 
how to write simple programs in Logo. The 
utilities supplied by Terrapin are also particu- 
larly useful, such as the ones that allow the 
Logo editor to be used as an ordinary text edit- 
ing system. 

TTie bottom line is that any of these three 
packages is the best educational software avail- 
able on a microcomputer today. If I had felt 
your readers would have come to this conclu- 
sion on the basis of Mr. Adams's review, I 
would not have bothered to write this letter. 
David Greene, Pala Alto, CA 

DOStalkin' 

According to Mr. Kersey (June DOStalk), D$ 
= CHR$(13) CHRS(4) will prevent prob- 
lems caused by dangling semicolons in print 
statements. True. However, when writing to a 
sequential text file, the statement print 
D$" close" will cause an extra, null record to be 
written to the disk file. Depending on the appli- 
cation, this could be disastrous. When writing 
to a file, consider either not including a 
CHR$(13) in defining DS. or try call 41750 : 
print D$, which is equivalent to a DOS close 
statement for all open files (48K). The extra 
print D$ makes DOS happy. 
Jon Kreisler, Flushing, NY 

Regarding the June DOStalk Mystery of the 
Month, I have tested the call 42350 on both my 
Apple and a friend's, and it doesn't work as 
stated. It works on any disk that catalogs by the 
normal DOS command; but with the disks that 
don't catalog normally, it produces the "pro- 
gram too large" error. Could you provide any 
further information on this? 
Joe Staten, Colorado Springs, CO 

I would like to call your attention to a serious 
problem in the input commas routine in June 
DOStalk. Characters entered with this routine 
will not be the same as those entered using the 
normal Applesoft input. It is necessary to sub- 
tract 128 from the value obtained in the peek 
statement. Also, to work correctly, the 141 must

be changed to 13. 

It is not necessary to run through the entire 
for-next loop for every input. Why not just look 
at the number of characters typed up to and in- 
cluding the return? Here is your suggestion, 
written as a subroutine, incorporating my 
changes: 

10 CALL -657:IN$ = "": FOR Q = 512 TO 
767 : IN = PEEK (Q)-128 : IF IN = 13 
THEN Q = 767: GOTO 12 

11 IN$ = INS + CHR$(IN) 

12 NEXT : RETURN 

The jump from the for-next loop and the 
"nameless" next increase the speed of the sub- 
routine. 

James DeMay, Jr., Riverdale, MD 

In June DOStalk, there is a routine to input 
strings that contain delimiters. The explanation 
of this routine is correct, with an exception: 
since the call is a Monitor routine, all ASCII in- 
put will be shifted by 128. If any testing of the 
resulting input against normal Applesoft strings 
is needed within the program, the test will al- 
ways be unsuccessful, even though the two 
strings appear to be equivalent. The solution to 
this problem is to replace line 65 in Mr. Ker- 
sey's example program with the following: 

65 CALL-657:A$ = "":FOR X = 512 TO 
767:P = PEEK(X):IF P0141 THEN 
A$=A$+GHR$(P-128):NEXT X 

The subtraction of 128 from P shifts the ASCII 



value back to its normal unshifted value. 
Earle Kebbekus, Maplewood, NJ 

Bert's Backtalk 

To Jon Kreisler: Your point is well taken, al- 
though this would rarely cause a problem. In- 
stead of call 41 750 : print D$ why not just use 
print CHRS(4): ■'close'"! 

To Joe Staten: In a program, if the catalog 
command has been changed to another word, 
call 42350 should perform the catalog function 
where catalog will not. This requires normal 
DOS, of course. I have not tested call 42350 ex- 
tensively, so I can't guarantee its reliability in all 
situations. 

To James DeMay: Yes, subtract 128, but 
have a look at the program sent in by Earle 
Kebbekus, which I think is better. Also, I agree, 
it is not necessary to run through the entire for- 
next loop, and I don't. 

To Phillip Pocock (August Open Discus- 
sion): What you have encountered is a bug. 
Key-Cat looks at the eighth character on each 
line. If it is a space, Key-Cat assumes it is a file 
name. To fix this, avoid using a space in the 
eighth character position of your headings. 
Bert Kersey, San Diego, CA 

Stringing You Along 

Dr. Shuerger's Apple occasionally sits there and 
does nothing while using File Cabinet probably 
because it is doing garbage collection. This hap- 
pens in Applesoft Basic (which I believe File 
Cabinet is written in) when the space available 



for strings fills up. The Basic interpreter search- 
es through the string space and deletes any no 
longer referred to by a string variable. This is 
the price you pay for being allowed variable- 
length strings.

PIE lives. Hayden Software has just released 
PIE Writer, a considerably enhanced version of 
the A pple PIE Text Editor and Formatter. The

Using the Epson's emphasized print mode

me to explain the use of printer codes in A pple

When you are in the text editor of Apple 
PIE, type the following: Shift control-M (and 
be sure it is a capital M). Nothing will appear 
on the screen as with all control characters. 
Then type escape and you will see an upside

trol-M escape-S will set the expanded print 
mode, and so on. The E or S must be a capital 
letter. 

Take another look at your Apple PIE man- 
ual and look for the Quote function or shift 
control-M. Apple PIE 2.0 and PIE Writer 3.3 
both allow the insertion of printer control codes 
by means of shift control-M. If you have Apple 
PIE 1.0 you may not find it; I'm not sure. 

I certainly would not be without Apple PIE 
(or PIE Writer) and the Epson printer combi- 
nation. Also, the word processor is much en- 
hanced with the Videoterm 80-column board, 
the Softswitch, and Enhancer II from Videx. I 
might add that I use the shell function oi Apple 
PIE and create my own letterheads and store 
them on an automatic letter form. When I want 
to write a letter to Softalk, for example, I just 
load a shell; my letterhead and address are al- 
ready done for me. I just change the date and 
start typing the body of the letter. The Epson 
printer does a beautiful job on the letterhead, as 
the editor of Softalk could tell you. Good luck!

Short Work of a Short Routine 

In response to the paragraphs on alignment ap- 
pearing in April Open Discussion, I must say 
that the chap who wrote the short routine 
presented went out of his way and back again 
for the solution. I am in no way criticizing his 
efforts; it is obvious that a lot of thought went 
into figuring out this particular solution. The 
problem, however, is not nearly as complex as 
presented. 

The following two lines can be easily incor- 
porated into any Applesoft program and 
accessed via a gosub call. As presented below, 
the value to be formatted should be assigned to 
the variable A'^ before entering the subroutine. 
The formatted value then comes out of the sub- 
routine assigned to the string variable PUS. Of 
course, the user could change these to any vari- 
ables he cares to choose. The first line handles 
negative values and places a trailing negative 
sign. If you prefer a leading negative sign, sim- 
ply reverse PUS + "-" to "-" + PUS. Near 
the end of the second line the number 2 repre- 
sents the number of decimal places to the right 
of the integer portion of the value, and the num- 
ber 10 represents the desired length of the value.

Knocked for a Loop 

We have found what seems to be a small bug in 
Applesoft. In performing an iterative calcula- 
tion within a for-next loop, our program was set 
to exit the loop whenever sufficient accuracy 
was obtained. After it did this a few times we 
got an out-of-memory error message. The prob- 
lem, we discovered, is that the return address of 
the loop is saved in the stack, and breaking out 
without going through the next statement leaves 
it there. After about ten repetitions of this, the 
stack area is filled up. An easy way to avoid this 
problem is to set the index of the loop (I in the 
following example) to the upper limit of the 
loop and then goto the next statement. 

Wrong: 

200 FOR I = 1 TO UL 

210 IF< condition >THEN 240 

220 NEXT I 

240 more program 

Right: 

190 TEMP = UL 

200 FOR I = 1 TO UL 

220 NEXT I 

230 I = TEMP 

240 more program 

Note that the variable I is the loop index, UL is 
the upper limit of the loop, and TEMP is a tem- 
porary storage variable for the value of I.

Help! I have a big problem concerning turnkey 
commercial software programs. I have an Ap- 
ple II with an Indigo 16K RAM expansion 
card into which I load Applesoft by booting the 
system master disk. However, most turnkey 
commercial software programs require Apple- 
soft in ROM and not in RAM. If I try to boot 
the software program disk after I have booted 
Applesoft into the RAM card, an error will re- 
sult. 1 am in a sense rebooting a disk and eras- 
ing the Applesoft program in the RAM card. 
Since I have already spent money on the 16K 
RAM card and I do not wish to spend more on 
an Applesoft ROM card, my question is: Is 
there a way to run turnkey ROM Applesoft

programs on an Applesoft RAM expansion sys- 
tem without knowing the "innards" of the com- 
mercial software disk? 
Tom Batson, Santa Rosa, CA 

Watertight-Rope Walking? 

The Omega Software Company, which distrib- 
utes the Locksmith program, claims that their 
purpose in selling the program is not to have 
people pirate software, but only to back it up. 

My only question is: why does Omega sup- 
ply the parameters for copying programs that 
already supply backups or that have easily at- 
tainable backups? If a company supplies a 
backup and replacement copies free of charge, 
and Om^a still distributes the parameters for 
such programs, one wonders whether Omega's 
rationale really holds water. 
Geoffrey Ravnor, New York, NY 

We established a policy of not providing pa- 
rameters for programs that meet what we feel are 
certain minimum standards in the area of back- 
ups. We even sent letters to all the major soft- 
ware houses stating our policy and asking for 
comments. A few have answered, some posi- 
tive, some n^ative; most have not answered at 
all. Most of the vendors were really interested in 
attempting to resolve the problem, while a few 
were simply more interested in finding fault 
with us than facing the real issue. 

In order to abide by these standards. Lock- 
smith is currently being sold with a backup disk 
included in the original package. Also provided 
with Locksmith is a manual supplement in 
which there is a statement of Omega's policy re- 
garding backups and parameters. Incidentally, 
the rest of our software is sold unprotected. 
David M. Alpert, president. Omega Microware, 
Chicago, IL 

Omega's policy, as stated in the Locksmith 
manual supplement, is an agreement not to pub- 
lish "parms" for programs whose vendor provides 
replacement disks with the return of the original 
for five dollars or less within a short time after re- 
ceipt; or, in the case of business and utility pro- 
grams, if an archival disk is supplied in the orig- 
inal package. 

Back Up or Back OfT 

To Terry Bradley of Sirius, who says that 
the people who market nibble copiers are 
crooks, I say that they are providing a support 
to my rights as a purchaser and owner that 
Sirius and other companies that copy protect 
have thwarted. They do not mean to thwart it, 
but I am not obligated to respect their copy 
scheme either. 

It boils down to this: The publishers have a 
property right and I am obligated to buy from 
them rather than steal. Once I have bought, 
then I have a right to use what I bought without it 
being a time bomb. This means backup. The 
publisher has a right to copy protect if he wants, 
but the purchaser has a right to know that one 
of his rights as an owner is excluded. Do you 
advertise on the package that your software is 
copy protected, Mr. Bradley? Finally, if soft-

Right on to Locksmith and the nibble

ers have foreclosed. I'm sorry that some people 
abuse these tools and use them to steal, but they 
also have a legitimate use, the opportunity for 
which Mr. Bradley, among others, creates. I'm 
not going to be morally outraged by Lock-

Peter Fallon, Philadelphia, PA 
Ivory Tower Power 

Being an Apple owner and being in education, I 
want to state unequivocally that what our 
hobby needs most is more free public domain 
software — especially in the field of education. 
We in education are in the business of dissemi- 
nating ideas, methods of thinking, algorithms, 
and so forth, which by their very nature cannot 
be copyrighted or possessed in any way. No one 
can own the Pythagorean theorem! No one can 
own our language, or our history, or our 
science. There is a contradiction in principle be- 
tween public access to this knowledge and pri- 
vate ownership of the materials that communi- 
cate this knowledge. So, for example, when the 
order for textbooks is late arriving at the book- 
store, we quite readily photocopy whole chap- 
ters for our students to use. And we copy these 
chapters in class-sized lots — by the dozais. I feel 
exactly the same about software. 

Why do we in education make students buy 
books? Certainly they don't need the books to 
learn the material. The libraries, both school 
and public, have copies. And the teacher teach- 
es. I have all the material in my head and I do 
my best to present it in class. All the students 
really have to do is pay attention. But they can- 
not take me home and pick my brain at their 
convenience. If they do, they will have to pay 
me a fee for tutoring. The content is free; the 
convenience is not. That's why they buy text- 
books — so they can haul them around and 
peruse them when and if they wish. The same 
applies to software. The content simply cannot 
be protected. The convenience and ready ac- 
cess really is something worth selling. It is cer- 
tainly worth what textbooks of comparable 
content are going for in the current market, but 
no more. 

Yet, there is another issue involved A few 
big textbook publishers have an unhealthy 
stranglehold on the education of our youth. 
One particular biology text, for example, is used 
in over half our country's school systems. And 
that text, in the last few years, has watered 
down its treatment of evolution to an innocu- 
ous few pages, seeking the lowest common de- 
nominator and the big business. We do not 
want to allow a similar thing to happen in edu- 
cational software. 

Recently, Softalk began a regular column 
on educational software that is nothing more 



than one review after another of software that 
almost no one can afford to buy. These reviews 
end up being nothing but more detailed adver- 
tisements than the ads that the publishers ac- 
tually pay for. This is useless. It just helps me 
decide ahead of time which software I will 
bother to copy illegally whenever I get the op- 
portunity. What is needed is a column on edu- 
cational software that gives listings, that tells us 
where we can get something at a reasonable cost 
(say, under twenty-five dollars), and that helps 
the people in the classroom learn to program in 
order to take up the slack until the publishers 
leam what education is really all about. 
Ellis R. McDaniels, Williamsville, NY 

What's for Dessert? 

Why doesn't Softalk answer more questions di- 
rected toward it? It seems a lot of people write 
in with honest questions but are left with 
naught. Shortage of italic type? Also, why 
doesn't Softalk acknowledge the existence of 
Softline? You would think that such com- 
panion publications would exchange ideas. I 
had a brother once that I don't talk about 
much, but he didn't contribute near as much as 
Softline does. Tell me why. 

Regarding software piracy, specifically the 
protection of ideas: Since when were abstract 
ideas the subjects of copyrights or the breaching 
thereupon? I would think that a considerable 
amount of programming effort goes into mak- 
ing rip-offs of arcade games, even though the 
programmer doesn't show much ingenuity as 
far as the concept goes in doing so. Would I be 
infringing upon copyrights if I wrote a science- 
fiction— fantasy story? How about one with 
good guys and bad guys? Perhaps one where the 
good guys are aided by a couple of inept robots 
and the bad guy pilots a spherical planet 
destroyer. Do the robots need to be named 
R2D2 and C3PO to constitute infringement? 
Where does one draw the line? The fact is, such 
judgments are personal in derivation and have 
no place in a justice system based upon the cut 
and dry. If society itself would look upon such 
undertakings as Puck-Man and Missile Defense 
as the cheap (in concept, not quality) imitations 
that they are, said programs wouldn't make a 
profit. The truth is that consumers are just as 
guilty as the authors in that they promote such 
accomplishments. And as long as there's a buck 
to be made, such prostitution will exist and 
flourish. Enough said. 

Who does Kersey think he is, taking the 
credit whilst Snoopy does all the work? And no 
wonder he looks so puzzled! What kind of dial 
tone does he expect to get with the drive door 
closed? C'mon Bert, cerebrate! You guys at Sof- 
talk have the right idea by putting his column in 
back; that way, we have to digest everything else 
before getting to the dessert! What we need are 
more guys like him (maybe with a bit more hair, 
though).

Microstrangers on a Train. Nobody's out to make a movie out of 
the story of UCSD Pascal and SofTech Microsystems yet. But when the 
entertainment industry starts casting about for likely subjects slightly 
more upbeat than child abuse, rape, alcoholism, crime, and war, they 
may come to realize that today's hardware and software engineers are ev- 
ery bit the heroic pioneers that such legendary figures of science as Marie 
Curie and Leonardo da Vinci are. 

Nowhere is the point brought home quite as clearly as in San Diego, 
California, birthplace of the p-System. There assembled, in the mid-sev- 
enties, as unlikely a group of achievers as ever made a significant contri- 
bution to any science. Leader of the pack was Kenneth Bowles, a com- 
puter science instructor who had a whole passel of degrees from Cor- 
nell . . . but they were in electrical engineering. Gathered around him 
were a group of grad students, undergraduates, and even some graduated 
hangers-on who wrestled with Bowles's main concern — developing a 
portable language suitable for the classroom environment. 

Similar assemblages are commonplace on campuses throughout the 
world — academic gurus putting their charges through the paces on some 
pet project. The results of most of these efforts wind up being written up 
and extolled in academic journals with circulations bordering on three to 
four hundred and then dropping out of sight. So how did it occur that 
Pascal overcame its academic hobbles to become a major software de- 
velopment tool in the eighties? 

It's a two-part tale, the first half describing development activities at 

Opposite page: the p-team. President John Splavec (top left), brought more 
aggressive marketing approaches and a wider marl<et perspective to his new 
company. Al Irvine, vice president of engineering (top right), made the 
contact that brought the p-System to SofTech. Julie Erwin, vice president of 
marketing (bottom left), started with the system at UCSD and is still its 
foremost spokesman. Mark Overgaard, manager of advanced development 
(bottom right), was the grad student most responsible for implementing the 
p-Svstem design. 

Firmament 



the UCSD campus and the second part relating how SofTech Microsys- 
tems's stewardship has brought a mature product to the marketplace. 
Ken Bowles is the leading character in part one, with Mark Overgaard 
and Julie Erwin in supporting roles. 

Erwin and Overgaard carry over to the second half of the yam, 
where they're joined by Al Irvine and John Brackett and, just lately, by 
John Splavec. 

Outrunning the NSF and DOD. The whole thing started as an aca- 
demic exercise designed to fill a specific academic void. It was only after 



the fact that they realized what they had accomplished. And along the 
way, Bowles and his students achieved on a shoestring what the Nation- 
al Science Foundation and the Department of Defense had been spend- 
ing millions of dollars on. 

The felt need that drove Ken Bowles was the requirement for port- 
able instructional-based software. Each time the computer science de- 
partment changed hardware, it was a six-month or longer job to move 
the instructional software tools to the new system. These hardware 
changes were not infrequent because technology was bringing the cost 
and size of hardware down, making it more accessible for classroom pur- 
poses. But each change brought with it the attendant problems of con- 
verting the software. 

Pascal was drawing some attention in academic circles during the 
early seventies and Bowles saw in it the promise of becoming a portable 
language. Portability — the trait of compatibility with various proces- 
sors — was still not the buzz word that it's become today, but Bowles saw 
its necessity in the academic environment. 

Bowles and some of his advanced students began digging into the 
language to determine its potential. 

About that time, grad student Mark Overgaard came to Bowles's at- 
tention. Overgaard had earned the bachelor's degree in physics at a lib- 
eral arts college in Pennsylvania before attending graduate school at 
UCSD. 

Overgaard had caught the computer bug first as an undergraduate, 
when he helped a professor feed card decks into an 8K IBM 1130. He 
followed that up by working part time for the school in the data process- 
ing department. He was captivated by the computer, but entered grad 
school in physics because he felt computer science was not an end in it- 
self. Today he smiles somewhat shamefacedly while admitting "how 
wrong I was." 

Realizing his error soon after matriculating to UCSD, Overgaard 
focused his efforts on the computer science department. He wrote a pa- 
per on memory management and his professor suggested that he show it 
to Bowles. Bowles invited Overgaard to take a look at a bttle project he

had going — Pascal — and a team was bom: Bowles as chief architect and 
Overgaard as chief engineer. 

Bowles remembers Christmas of 1977 as the turning point. It was 
during that vacation that portability was proven, when programs com- 
piled from an LSI- 1 1 machine were run on an 8080-based Northwest Mi- 
crosystems machine. It was also at this point that the special genius that 
is Bowles came to the forefront. 

Another academician would have excitedly called his professional 
journal to proclaim the feat and offer a learned treatise on the project. 
Bowles called Byte magazine and was invited to write an article. As 
Overgaard remembers it, UCSD received more than one thousand in- 
quiry card responses from the article. A cottage industry was bom. 

Soon the computer lab was busy sending out information and copy- 
ing disks. At one time, nearly five hundred manufacturers or would-be 
manufacturers of computers were standing in line to get licenses. 

Directing much of this activity was Julie Erwin. Erwin had accmed 
credits toward a math degree at the University of Arizona before switch- 
ing to computer science at UCSD. She became a proctor for one of 
Bowles's classes and gravitated to the Pascal project. 

She became a staff assistant in computer science and, for the final 
eighteen months, was an integral part of the support group for the effort. 

North by Southwest. All this activity did not go unnoticed. Among 
the regular visitors were a couple of bearded, thong-wearing kids from 
northern California named Steve. They had a product called Apple and 
they'd sometimes hang out in the lab to check out the progress of the 
software. Wozniak and Jobs were later to be the only ones to negotiate a 
license directly from the university; all other early licenses were assigned 
to SofTech Microsystems. 

Later, UCSD's computer science laboratory was to be stocked com- 
pletely with Apple lis. 

But this activity was a mixed blessing for the university. While it es- 
tablished for all time the credibility of its computer science department, it 
also attracted the attention of the IRS. The Califomia university system 
and the IRS had a gentleman's agreement whereby the system could file 
an omnibus tax return for all its campuses. 

Ken Bowles's project looked like it had such profit potential that the 
IRS's representatives began making noises — perhaps they'd like each 
campus to file its own return so they could monitor the revenue from 
that and any other similar enterprises. Calif omia's Board of Regents was 
understandably unimpressed by such a proposal that would have raised 
its costs significantly. So it directed that Bowles follow one of three 
courses: Apply to the IRS for a special exemption, separate the Pascal ac- 
tivities from the university, or cease the project. 

Stopping a project that seemed to have such far-ranging implications 
for the microcomputer industry was anathema to all involved. Waiting 
up to eighteen months for an IRS exemption also seemed intolerable. So 
Bowles took the other route — he started courting possible trustees for the 
project. Both Bill Gates of Microsoft and Gary Kildall of Digital Re- 
search were approached. 

What the university wanted was someone with southem California 
operations and an understanding of and respect for software to become 
the trustee. 

Around that time, Al Irvine was mnning a small western branch of- 
fice of SofTech, a Massachusetts firm. Irvine was a mainframe man who 
had once headed software engineering operations for a division of Na- 
tional Cash Register. Unlike the jaded old man of the producer's script 
above, Irvine is a man of intense energy and wide-ranging interests. 

One of those interests was finding software tools to enhance the pro- 
ductivity of programmers. SofTech had similar interests, so Irvine, a con- 
firmed believer of the casual southem Califomia lifestyle, left Califomia 
to pursue productivity in Boston. Eventually, lifestyle won out over 
productivity, however, and Irvine announced his resignation to retum 
home. Instead, SofTech offered him the chance to set up a branch office, 
which is how a Massachusetts software concern happened to be in south- 
em California — Escondido, to be exact — when UCSD was looking. 

Irvine's retum to his preferred climes didn't dull his determination to 
find better software tools. And his attention was directed to the goings- 
on at UCSD, even though he was told that they wouldn't separate the 
language from the operating system. That seemed a tad quixotic to him.

To Catch 
a 

Language 



So what of Ken Bowles, the mastermind behind the creation of the 
pnSystem in the first place? 

First, he was put off by the conflict-of-interest rules of the state of 
California, which prevented him from working on the continuation of 
development once the product was under the auspices of SofTech. 

Second, he was put off by some of the design decisions and varia- 
tions introduced by such licensees as Apple. "It was painful to sit 
through two hours of debate about whether to follow a command with a 
comma or semicolon. From an engineering standpoint, it made no dif- 
ference." That experience soured him so much, he now calls himself "a 
fugitive from Pascal." 

So Ken Bowles, looking for the ultimate in programmer productivi- 
ty tools, took up Ada. Ada is a Pascal-like language, designed by Honey- 
well and adopted by the Department of Defense for government usage. 
All conventions and syntax in Ada are standardized and Bo^des has high 
hopes that the DOD will have the clout to keep it that way. 

He's chairman of the board of TeleSoft, a forty-man software devel- 
opment firm in San Diego spedaliidng in Ada. As well, he's still putting 
in half-time at UCSD, where his introduction to computer science class- 
es draw more than six hundred students per term. HI 

but he nevertheless placed a call to Bowles. 

Dial M for Micro. There's a lot to be said for being in the right place 
at the right time. Bowles and Irvine were acquaintances; and, when 
Bowles couldn't get Microsoft or Ehgital Researdi interested in southern 
California, his mind had turned to Irvine. Irvine's call couldn't have been 
timed better. 

The university and SofTech went into almost immediate negotia- 
tions. The final agreement called for Bowles and Overgaard to split their 
time for one year— half at the university and half at SofTech. Conflict-of- 
interest rules of the state of California prevented Bowles from devoting 
his time to SofTech Microsystems because he had overall responsibility 
for the agreement. 

SofTech formed a new subsidiary, SofTech Microsystems, to direct 
the activities relating to the p-System. Dr. John Brackett, then president 
of the parent company, felt the new company was so important that he 
stepped down to take the presidency of the subsidiary. 

Brackett and Irvine gathered a select few to join them at the outset. 
One was Erwin, who had earned her management stripes during those 
hectic days in the computer lab. To this day, she's responsible for the 
sales and marketing of the product. 

Apple signed their license for Pascal with the university just days be- 
fore SofTech and the university finalized their agreement. That Apple 
has moved Apple Pascal slightly away from UCSD Pascal standards is a 
source of regret at SofTech, particularly to Overgaard. On the other 
hand, Overgaard, Erwin, and Irvine agree that Apple's enthusiastic em- 
bracing of Pascal, as embodied by Apple software vice president John 
Couch's tub-thumping, was of significant importance in gaining the lan- 
guage standing in the commercial world. Bowles adds the name of veter- 
an industry pundit Carl Helmers as a major contributor to getting Pas- 
cal accepted. 

SMS assumed the responsibility for nurturing the p-System in 
June 1979. Most of the early days were spent getting the system running 
on various microprocessors. That's an ongoing effort and Irvine says it's 
still "magic everytime we get a new system running." Then the emphasis 



switched toward wooing various hardware manufacturers and software 
pubUshers. But very little emphasis was placed on end user sales until this 
summer, when SofTech took Apple on head-to-head in a battle for the 
affections of the installed Apple Pascal user base. 

The Man Who Knew Just Enough. That more aggressive stance can 
be attributed to new president John Splavec. Splavec, a Wisconsin na- 
tive, cut his management teeth at Informatics, where he was vice presi- 
dent and general manager of the applications product division. He also 
spent time as a marketing rep for IBM, so he's bringing a wide-ranging 
background in big systems to SofTech Microsystems. 

In addition to introducing broader-based marketing to SofTech, he's 
implementing stronger strategic planning. Part of that planning is 
strengthening the end user base. Splavec has high praise for the compa- 
ny's successes marketing to the manufacturers and for his predecessor's 
skill in preparing the company for the changing marketing strategies. 
Splavec's only been on the job four months, but the company was poised 
for the changes he's implementing; it's this readiness that has allowed 
them to react so rapidly. 

Now SofTech's turning their attentions to the retailers and con- 
sumers. And their pitch has been updated. Ken Bowles proved the con- 
cept of portability only five years ago. But now, SofTech's selling uni- 
versality. 

Erwin's as beguiling as any siren when you get her started on the ad- 
vantages of the p-System, and universality is her foremost song. She'll 
cite chapter and verse on all the microprocessors for which the p-System 
has been adapted and then launch into a laundry Ust of the manufac- 
turers who use those chips. With a list that runs from Alpha Micro to Ze- 
nith, the p-System does seem to approach universaUty. 

Universality is especially dear to SofTech because of another market 
they're now approaching. Splavec brought with him from Informatics 
awareness of the needs of the Fortune 1000 companies and good mar- 
keting tactics for serving that market. Splavec and Erwin both point out 
that with a universal operating system, executives and managers need not 
be tied to a particular brand of desktop computer, but rather can choose 
the best hardware for their particular needs with the assurance that the 
software will be there. 

The impression of universaUty is enhanced by the recent introduc- 
tion of the universal medium adapter. The universal medium adapter ad- 
dresses the different methods by which manufacturers communicate with 
disk drives. Widespread adoption of the adapter wUl simplify life for 
both the retailer and the software publisher by obviating the necessity of 
having tailored versions of the product for each hardware environment. 

Psycho Disks. When one disk serves all machines, retailers won't 
have to carry four versions of a product for four different machines, nor 
will the publisher have to provide distinct versions. 

For SofTech, this addresses their foremost goal, providing software 
tools to increase programmer productivity. Not only programmers, but 
also publishers and retailers, benefit from the economies. And end users 
of less widely adopted machines should benefit from having a greatly in- 
creased selection of software from which to choose. 

The p-System is not merely an operating system with a language at- 
tached, and Irvine, he with the wont to improve programmer productiv- 
ity, waxes eloquent on the reusability of software under the p-System. 
The modular nature of the language is such, he points out, that libraries 
of applications modules are already being offered as commercial prod- 
ucts. The buyer is able to insert portions of the library into programs as 
needed, saving the time otherwise spent re-creating the wheel. 

Erwin touts such additions to the system ax XenoFile, which allows 
CP/M programs to run on the p-System. SofTech also has native code 
generators that allow the programmer to develop certain high-perform- 
ance subroutines of his program in the assembly language of the indi- 
vidual machine. 

From the six persons who started with SofTech Microsystems in 
1 979, the company has grown to nearly one hundred employees. They 
had overrun their office space in San Di^o early on and had spread out 
to two other buildings. This month, they'll be moving into a 33,000- 
square-foot facility in Rancho Bernardo. 

Temporarily, that should provide room for a film crew as well, 
should the producer ever sell the script. Dl

No matter how you slice it, the only way you're 
going to know if a data handling program is 
right for you is by running it on your computer, 
solving your problems, your way. 

And the only database management sys- 
tem (DBMS) that lets you do that is dBASE II™ 

A DBMS like the mainframers have. 

Conceptually, dBASE II is a relational 
database management system, like the system 
IBM introduced on their mainframes last year. 

Practically, dBASE II is the most powerful 
DBMS made for a micro. It handles multiple 
databases on a single drive and simplifies every- 
thing from accounting to project management 
to monitoring rainfall on the Upper Volta. 

With a word or two, you CREATE data- 
bases, APPEND new data instantly, UPDATE, 
MODIFY and REPLACE fields, records and 
entire databases. Organize months worth of data 
in minutes with the built-in REPORT. Do sub- 
field and multi-field searches, then DISPLAY 
some or all of the data for any conditions you 
want to apply. 

And you've just begun to tap the power 
of dBASE II. 

Easy to look at^ easy to use. 

Input screens and output forms couldn't 
be easier — just "paint" your format on the CRT 
and what you see is what you'll get. 

You can do automatic calculations on 
fields, records and databases, accurate to 10 digits. 



And you can use dBASE II interactively 
for instant answers. Or save your instructions 
and automate your data handling with two words: 
DO Finances, DO Rainfall, DO whatever has 
to be done. 

Use dBASE II to help make your choice: 

Instead of asking you to pore over a 
manual, we'll let you try dBASE II free for 30 days. 

Send us $400 and we'll send you a copy 
of dBASE II that you can run on a 48k Apple with

some of the data I had about how good Jim in-

the current flowing past. I was a-trembling when 
I called that letter back up because I'd got to de- 
cide, forever betwixt two things, and I knowed it. 
I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, 
and then says to myself: "All right, then, I'll go

□ Inherit the Wind. Blooming out of the arid 
western flatland of Medicine Bow, Wyoming, is 
a wind turbine that looks like one of those over- 
sized sculptures by Claus Oldenberg. This one 
would be titled "Propeller on a Stick." While it 
looks a little funny from a distance, like a big 
pinwheel, up close it's awesome — 262 feet high, 
big as Godzilla. A helicopter looks like an in- 
sect in comparison. 

The WTS-4 (wind turbine systan) is a proj- 
ect of the Hamilton Standard division of United 
Technologies. Its fiberglass blades are sched- 
uled to start spinning at thirty revolutions per 
minute this September. The U.S. Department 
of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation is behind 
the building of the four-megawatt horizontal- 
access wind turbine. The first of its size in the 
world, it's the culmination of Hamilton Stand- 
ard's wind turbine activity, which has been un- 
derway since the early 1970s. 

The wind machine, with its expanded name, 
WTS-4 SVU (system verification unit), is part 
of an evaluation of technical and economic fea- 
sibility of wind turbines. Preliminary studies 
have indicated that wind turbines may be cost 
effective when coupled with existing hydroelec- 
tric installations. 

The heart of the WTS-4 SVU is a set of Intel 
Model 230 microcomputers. One is located in 
the base of the steel tower and one is in the na- 
celle, the house-sized box behind the blades. 
Completely automatic, the micros control the 
turbine's operation, firom making prestartup 
checks to diagnosing electrical faults and lubri- 
cating the system. Pitch control of the blades, to 
optimize energy capture, is one of their prime 
duties. Sensors in the nacelle send information 
on rotor speed and shaft torque to the 230s, 
which then adjust the angle and direction (into 
the wind) of the blades. 

Too much wind may spin the blades too 
fast, causing the generator to go out of syn- 
chronization. The 230s will feather the blades to 
a slow stop when this occurs, starting them back 
up again when conditions have stabilized. 

The WTS4 SVU turbine in Medicine Bow 
is an upgrade of a three-m^awatt unit being in- 
stalled in the town of Maglarp, Sweden. Both 
are built by Hamilton Standard. 

"Wind energy could represent up to 10 per- 
cent of new electrical energy resources in the 
next fifteen to twenty years," says Robert 
Gregoire, business development and marketing 
manager for Hamilton Standard. "Among the 
current alternative energy sources being consid- 
ered — solar, geothermal, and photovoltaic — the 
wind is preeminent." 

The Department of the Interior estimates 
that a wind farm of forty turbines could gener- 
ate four hundred million kilowatt hours of elec- 



tricity a year. Gregoire does some quick calcu- 
lating. "That's enough electricity to run ap- 
proximately fifty thousand homes." 




□ The Dope Syndrome. An interesting phe- 
nomenon occurs when you s&p a pure silicon ays- 
tal into a beam of neutrons from a nuclear re- 
actor. Most of the neutrons pass through the 
crystal as if it weren't there. But a few are cap- 
tured by atoms of silicon 30 (one of three sili- 
con isotopes commonly found in a sample), 
causing the silicon 30 to decay into phosphorus 
atoms. 

The process is called neutron transmuta- 
tion doping (NTD), and after the sample is re- 
moved from the neutron beam (and the radio- 
activity dies away) the result is a piece of silicon 
uniformly doped with phosphorus. The more 
phosphorus you add, the less electrical resist- 
ance there is and the greater the conductivity of 
the silicon. 

A resistivity of zero, where the flow of elec- 
trons in a material is completely unhampered, 
has been achieved in certain materials (dubbed 
superconductors) at very low temperatures. The 
problem of excess heat given off by the move- 
ment of electrons is virtually eliminated, and the 
size of computer circuits made with this mate- 
rial can be reduced dramatically. A computer 
equivalent in power to an IBM mainframe 
made with superconductors would be about the 
size of a Rubik's Cube. But these theoretical 
super supercomputers are a few years down the 
road. 

NTD will never completely replace today's 
industry standard, boron doping of silicon, for a 
number of reasons. 

"It'll be hard to convince the computer in- 
dustry that uniform phosphorus doping would 



be a benefit," explains John W. Farmer, senior 
research scientist at the University of Missouri \ 
in Columbia, Missouri. "The industry is com- || 
mitted to a certain technology and sees no need I! 
to change." j|j 

Another drawback is that NTD doesn't bring | 
resistivity down to the levels needed in mod- f 
em computer circuitry. Leaving the silicon in 
the flow of neutrons from the reactor long 
enough to reach those low resistance levels is 
not economically practical. 

Bad times in the nuclear research industry 
constitute another problem that won't go away 
easily. No new research reactors have been built 
since 1963, and conventional nuclear power 
plants are unsuited for the process because they 
are designed to produce steam rather than to | 
provide access to neutrons. Research reactors 
and commercial power reactors alike have a 
finite lifetime of perhaps fifty years. 

Neutron doped silicon is perfect for eleo- | 
tronic devices that handle high voltages or high 
currents in high-power machinery, like electric 
locomotives. One of the first applications of the 
technology went into electrical transmission 
lines in Europe. NTD at the moment seems 
more suitable for power control devices than for [ 
computers. j 

Nonetheless, Farmer believes that NTD ' 
may help in the development of high-speed 
large-scale integrated circuits. The density of 
components is so high that a very uniformly 
doped material is needed, and NTD is more re- j 
liable than traditional methods. i 

"From that point of view, neutron trans- 
mutation doped silicon is much better as a start- 
ing material," Farmer explains. 

At the moment, worldwide production of 
neutron transmutation doped silicon is around 
fifty metric tons a year. It is used mainly in Eu- 
rope and Japan. The University of Missouri in j 
Columbia is the only commercial source of the | 
material in the United States. They produce 
about twelve metric tons annually. 
□ Here's a Knocking Indeed! For more than 
three hundred years, calculus has held a preem- 
inent position in the mathematics curriculum. 
Deemed one of the finest achievements of the 
human mind, calculus has been the chamber- 
lain of science since the days of Francis Bacon. 

Discrete mathematics is knocking on the 
gate. Up to this time, freshman and sophomore 
mathematics students in college have been re- 
quired to take a year of calculus. Recently a 
growing number of mathematicians and com- 
puter scientists have started to push for a more 
balanced curriculum featuring courses in dis- 
crete mathematics, including logic, probability, 
and the methods by which things combine and 
are counted.

WU TA I 1/ 



SEPTEMBER 1982 



Calculus is the tool of continuous mathe- 
matics, which posits nature as a smooth, un- 
broken flow, exemplified by the movement of 
objects in space. Discrete mathematics at- 
tempts to define nature in terms of individual 
elements, like the leaves on a tree. Computers 
are discrete machines, dealing with individual 
countable things. 

Stephen White, director of special projects 
for the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in New 
York City, defines calculus's traditional role as 
a gatekeeper. Discrete mathematics may soon 
share that role. 

"There's been considerable discussion about 
it," White says. "People going into computer 
science are much more interested in discrete 
mathematics." 

Last month the Sloan Foundation spon- 
sored an invitation-only conference for mathe- 
matics educators at Williams College in Massa- 
chusetts. "It seemed that a general agreement 
was reached at the conference that changes 
would be made in the undergraduate curric- 
ulum," White reports. 

Gale Young, a mathematics instructor at 
the University of Wyoming in Laramie, at- 
tended the conference at Williams College. "I 
think at the very least there'll be an alternative 
track for teaching freshman mathematics," he 
says. 

"Now that computer science majors ac- 
count for a larger part of enrollment, we're able 
to listen to them. But it's not just those students 
that need early exposure to discrete mathe- 



matics. Students in engineering and the physi- 
cal sciences who expect to use computers should 
have experience with discrete mathematics very 
early." 

How soon might we expect this shift in em- 
phasis to become widespread? Ten years? "It'll 
be quicker than that. Has to be," explains 
Young. "It'll be more like five years, which is 
very quick for academia." 

One problem holding up the teaching of dis- 
crete mathematics at the freshman level is a lack 
of proper textbooks. Help is on the way from 
John G. Kemeny, who coauthored in 1955 with 
J. Laurie Snell and Gerald L. Thompson the 
first introductory-level textbook for discrete 
mathematics. Introduction to Finite Mathe- 
matics. The Sloan Foundation has given 
Kemeny, a professor of mathematics at Dart- 
mouth College, a grant to rewrite the book em- 
phasizing the link to computers. 

"There is now substantial support for a rec- 
ommendation that a group of us made twenty- 
five years ago that the introductory mathe- 
matics sequence should be partly calculus and 
partly finite (discrete) mathematics," Kemeny 
says in a recent Los Angeles Times article. 

Another leading supporter of giving dis- 
crete mathematics more emphasis is Antony 
Ralston, a mathematician and professor of 
computer science at the State University of New 
York at Buffalo. In the same article, he sums up 
the situation: "The rise of computers is chang- 
ing the face of the world not just in obvious 
ways, but in some significant intellectual ways. 



"The overwhelming number of new prob- 
lems that will come to mathematics to be solved 
come from areas related to computers and.com- 
puter science."

□ The Incredible Shrinking Computer. Don't 
be surprised if someday soon you have to wait 
outside a telephone booth while the person in- 
side communicates by modem utilizing a port- 
able computer. Panasonic, Sinclair, Quasar, and 
now Olympia USA are marketing miniscule but 
versatile computer systems that can be easily 
carried and used just about anywhere. 

The briefcase-sized Olympia Portable Com- 
puter (OPC) comes complete with a 6502 mi- 
croprocessor, a calculator-sized keyboard with 
sixty-five characters, a liquid crystal display 
panel, and an internal battery pack. Standard 
models come with 4K programmable memory, 
but the portable micro supports up to 52K of 
RAM and 64K of ROM. 

An acoustic modem and RS-232C interface 
are optional, though they seem crucial to the 
concept of a portable computer. More stand- 
ard features are a clock/ controller for keeping 
track of appointments and a file system for stor- 
ing information such as phone numbers. 

Some of the programs available for the 
OPC are Porta Budget, Porta Writer, and Porta 
Caic. Snap (a derivative of Forth) and Micro- 
soft Basic are available for programming appli- 
cations. The software capsules are ROM units 
that plug into the back of the OPC. Because of 
internal memory restrictions, it's only possible 
to access one capsule at a time. The software is 
authored by an outside company, Friends Ami. 

The OPC should be available in retail out- 
lets this month; the carrying case is standard 
with every unit. 

How well portable computing will catch on 
is not yet clear. The OPC has been received fa- 
vorably at several trade shows, including Com- 
dex in Atlantic City. But Panasonic and Qua- 
sar, which have had comparable products on 
the market for a few months, are apparently 
having trouble selling units. The portable mi- 
crocomputer may take a while to reach its po- 
tential in the marketplace. It's a revolutionary 
concept worth keeping an eye on. JM

Exploring Business Basic, Part 12 



In recent months we have been digging up 
uses for the various features of the console 
driver. While last month's four-way scrolling 
program was valuable, and even fun, there are 
other, far more typical ways that most applica- 
tions can use the console features. 

One of the most common of these is the use 
of data entry screens. Anyone who has pro- 
grammed has wished for easy ways to generate 
the data entry screens that are an inevitable part 
of any business application. Most program- 
mers sooner or later create or buy software to 
make that task easier. Not to be outdone, your 
fearless Basic columnist offers the following ten- 
der morsel. 

(Nope, not so fast; first the sales pitch. The 
program below is generally organized along the 
followLng lines: first, a skeleton program that 
performs a general data entry loop, presenting a 
screen with fields to be filled in; and second, a 
series of support subroutines that you can use to 
initialize a screen definition, present the screen, 
capture the data, and store it in a transaction 
file. In addition to these functions, the routines 
are designed to allow quite a bit of flexibility in 
adding features of your own design, especially 
edit routines on the data.) 

Okay, now that the orientation is over, 
here's the program skeleton: 



1 REM screen data capture program 
5 DIM name$(50,1),info%(50,2),

620 GET a$ 
630 CLOSE 
635 END 



That's a fairly meaty skeleton, but relative- 
ly straightforward. First, a word about the three 
arrays dimensioned in line 5. Since this is a gen- 
eral-purpose data entry routine, all the infor- 
mation about the data to be captured is con- 
tained in arrays in memory. 

NameS holds the name of each field to be 
displayed, along with any default values, in the 
format shown in figure 1. 

Info% is an array that contains information 
about how the field names and values are to be 
displayed, as shown in figure 2. 

The last array, input. req%. is considerably 
simpler. It is built during initialization, and con-

tains 1 if the field requires input, 0 if no input 
(titles and so on), and a — 1 if the field consists

Next, the program performs a gosub to an 
initialization routine at line 1000. This routine, 
in addition to filling the three arrays just men- 
tioned, also sets a number of constants and 
opens the data logging file, if indicated. The 
routine below uses initialization from data state- 
ments, but, as indicated, a "real" program 
would use files to contain the screen defini- 
tions.

from a file)

1095 RETURN 

Bargain Basement Logic. Of passing inter- 
est in this routine is the use in line 1017 of a logi- 
cal expression to put the index of the first field 
requiring input in the variable first.input. This 
could have been done nearly as easily with an ;/ 
statement, but there's a special on logic this 
week that seemed too good to pass up. First.in- 
put itself is used to determine whether pressing 
escape should mean stop inputting — or just 
start the current screen over. 

Of more than passing interest is a sample set 
of screen definitions that this program might 
process. Consider the following data state- 
ments as an example: 

1700 DATA 7 

1705 DATA "My First Screen"," " 
1707 DATA 117,0,0 

1710 DATA "Name and Address Entry"," " 

1715 DATA 1,30,0 

1720 DATA ":First Name: "," " 

1730 DATA 3,1,15 

1735 DATA ":Last Name: "," " 

1740 DATA 3,40,20 

1745 DATA "Address (free form)"," " 

1750 DATA 5,1,0 

1755 DATA ":"," " 



SEPTEMBER 1982 



1760 DATA 6,1,0 
1765 DATA ":State: ","CA" 
1770 DATA 8,1,-2 
1775 DATA "{","FY1982" 
1780 DATA 0,0,0 

The definition starts with the number of 
screen items (both displayable and not) and the 
next two lines are the general screen definition. 
Next comes a sample screen comment ("name 
and address entry") which line 1715 tells us will 
be positioned on row 1, beginning at column 30. 
The next field requires input (the leading colon 
indicates that), has no default value, and lives 
on row 3, column 1. Furthermore, it has a maxi- 
mum allowed length of fifteen characters. Line 
1745 is another comment, this one referring to 
the field directly under it and defined on lines 
1755 and 1760. Since this is a free-form field 
with no title (the colon is its only definition), it 
will extend the entire length of the line, a full 
eighty characters of input space. Line 1765 is an 
example of a field with a default value, and also 
one (as indicated in line 1770) that has a re- 
quired length of two characters. The last exam- 
ple, on line 1775, is a default field that will ap- 
pear in all output records. This is a useful op- 
tion for including fields, such as dates or head- 
ing data, that the user should not be required to 
type each time, but that may need to appear in 
the output for reference or for meeting another 
program's requirements. 

That about wraps up the initialization, leav- 
ing us with a set of screen and input definitions 
for a simple data entry screen. Now let's go 
back and look at the rest of the program main 
loop, starting with line 25. Here and through 
line 45 we create a starter screen, which could 
certainly be more elaborate if desired. For in- 
stance, you could prompt here for the name of 
the screen definition file instead of hard coding 
it as we did in this example. 

In any case, line 100 begins the program's 
main loop for data entry. The first routine 
called is the subroutine at line 1 500, which dis- 
plays the screen according to the definitions. It 
looks like this: 

1500 TEXT:HOME 

1505 FOR field= 1 TO items 

1510 field$=name$(field,0) 

1515 IF MID$(field$,1,1)=":" THEN 1550

AT LAST, 
PERSONALIZED 
LETTERS THE 
EASY WAY! 

In May, 1981, Blue Lakes started testing a 
new program that may very well revolution- 
ize the way letters are written. Letters are 
first entered on forms from within a Super- 
Database program that was specifically 
designed to handle personal information. 
The Database can then be searched by up to 
6 position searches simultaneously. It 
doesn't matter whether the searches are 
only part of a word, name, or code. The first 
name with a semicolon next to it Is a built In 
feature. 

You can sort all fields. You can even specify 
zipcode order and have labels, letters, and 
listings alphabetized by last name within 
each zipcode. Labels can even include cap- 
tions. 

Requires a 64K Apple with 2 disk drives. 
Works many times faster on any hard disk 
supporting Apple Pascal. Apple III version Is 
now available. 

A Free conversion program that converts 
Pascal text files into Messenger records is 
available if Purchased by Sept. 30th, 1982.

screen, one field at a time. This is accomplished 
in the subroutine at line 2000, and here's where 
things get a trifle tricky: 

2000 field = fieldnum 
2002 value$ = " " 

2005 IF input.req%(field) = 0 THEN RETURN 

2006 IF input.req%(field)<0 THEN 
value$ = name${field,1):RETURN 

Roll Up Your Sleeves. These first few lines 
are fairly obvious. Using the input. req% array, 
we can quickly determine if the field is one re- 
quiring only default processing or none at all. 
Note that the string ValueS will be used to con- 
vey the result of this field's data entry process. 
Once we determine that actual input must take 
place, then the real work begins, as shown be- 
low 

2008 row=info%(field,0) 

2010 start.window=info%(field,1) + LEN 

{name$(field,0))-1 
2015 field.len=ABS(info%(field,2)) 
2020 IF field. lenOO THEN end.window 

= start.window+field.len-1 :GOTO 

2060 
2025 test=field+1 

2030 IF test>items OR info%(test,0)>row 
THEN end.window=79:field.len=80 
-start.window:GOTO 2060 

2035 IF info%(test,0) = row THEN 

end. window= info%(test, 1 )- 1 :field.len 
=end.window-start.window+ 1;G0T0 
2060 

2040 test = test +1 

2045 GOTO 2030 

2060 WINDOW start.window.row TO 
end.window.row 

This routine sets up a field for data entry. 
Because of the console driver's powerful win- 
dowing capability, once the size of the field is 
determined it is possible to construct a cell on 
the screen for each data item that must be in- 
put. As you can see, this window definition is 
relatively easy if the field length is known up 
front. Lines 2025 through 2045 are designed to 
determine the actual field length available to a 
variable-length item, by looking ahead at what's 
next on the screen and adjusting accordingly. 
Once that is determined, line 2060 establishes 
the window in which data entry will take place 
for that item. Next is the printing of any default 
values, and the display (in inverse) of the field 
available for entry 

2065 line$ = MID$(blank$,1, field. len) 
2070 default$ = name$(field,1):IF 

defaults <> " " THEN SUB$(line$,1 , 

LEN(default$))=default$ 
2075 INVERSE:HOME 
2080 PRINT line$; 
2082 PRINT set.editS; 
2085 HPOS=1:point=1 

Of note here is the variable Set.edit, which is 
used to turn off all console options, leaving the 
program totally in control of cursor move- 
ment, wrap, scroll, and so on. Line 2085 then 
positions the cursor to the beginning of the field 
(remember that this is a window now) and sets 
up a pointer "point" to the first character of the 
field value (LineS). Now the fun really begins: 



2100 ON KBD GOTO 2200 

2105 NORMAL:PRINT MID$(line$,point, 

1);:INVERSE:F0R j= 1 TO 150:NEXT: 
PRINT MID$(line$,point,1);:FOR 
j=1 TO 150:NEXT:GOTO 2105 

This is our old friend the on kbd loop. In 
this case we are using the normal and inverse 
options (and the fact that we just turned the 
console "advance after printing" function off) 
to blink whatever character in Line string we 
are currently pointing at. For the purposes of 
this routine, you can equate LineS with what's 
seen in the window exactly. Of course, you hum 
around in the little loop in line 2105 until a key 
is pressed. That sends the program off to line 
2200: 

2200 OFF KBD 

2205 IF KBD<32 OR KBD>127 THEN 2270 
2210 SUB$(line$,point,1)=CHR$(KBD) 
2215 INVERSE:PRINT MID$(line$, 

point.l); 
2220 IF point<field.len THEN 

point=point+1 
2250 HPOS = point 
2255 ON KBD GOTO 2200 
2260 RETURN 

Funny Characters. After checking for con- 
trol or special function characters in line 2205, 
the typed character is inserted into the LineS 
string at the current cursor position, and the 
character is reprinted in inverse to be sure that 
the on kbd routine wasn't exited in the wrong 
state. Assuming that there is room in the win- 
dow, lines 2220 and 2250 update the pointer 
and advance the cursor to the new position. 
Then hnes 2255 and 2260 clean up and return to 
the blink routine, awaiting another keystroke. 
But what about those special characters? Wait 
no longer 

2270 IF KBD = 27 THEN escapecode = 1: 
POP:RETURN 

2275 IF KBD = 8 AND point>1 THEN 
INVERSE:PRINT MID$(line$, 
point, 1 );:point= point- 1 :GOTO 2330 

2280 IF KBD = 21 AND poinKfield.len 
THEN INVERSE:PRINT MID$ 
(line$,point,1);:point=point+1; 
GOTO 2330 

These lines check for escape and exit back to 
the calling level (the pop gets us out of the on 
kbd routine and back to reality). In addition, 
lines 2275 and 2280 process the cursor keys for 
left and right arrow, first reprinting the current 
character and then resetting the pointer. 

2300 IF KBD=13 THEN value$ = MID$ 
(lines, 1,point-1):line$ = MID$ 
(values, 1, field. len):GOTO 2320 

2305 IF KBD0141 AND KBD09 THEN 
2350 

2310 valueS=line$ 

2320 NORMAL:HOME:PRINT set.normalS; 
lineS; 

2325 POP:RETURN 
2330 HPOS = point 
2350 ON KBD GOTO 2200 
2355 RETURN 

These lines wrap up the routine once the 



user is satisfied that the field is complete. There 
are several options to signal completion. First, 
line 2300 processes the return key, discarding 
anything to the right of where the return key 
was pressed. ValueS is set to what's left, and 
LineS is redefined so that the actual data can be 
displayed in line 2320. Line 2305 processes the 
other option, full entry of whatever is in the 
window, no matter where the cursor is. As you 
can see, this occurs when either open-apple re- 
turn or tab is pressed. Set.normalS turns ad- 
vance back on, so that the value can be printed 
back into the window, this time with inverse off, 
to indicate that data entry is finished in that 
field. 

Whew! All of that excitement leads us back 
to the main loop, now at line 120, where the re- 
sult of the field call is analyzed. If escape was 
pressed, a further check is made to see if it was 
pressed during the first input field of the form. 
If so, that is the indication to terminate input of 
forms, and the program jumps out of the loop. 
If escape is pressed in any other field, process- 
ing starts over at line 105 with a clean slate. If 
the return was normal, with data for the field in 
ValueS, then there is an opportunity to do any 
additional processing required and then add 
Values to the accumulating Out.recS in the rou- 
tine at line 3000. After all the fields are proc- 
essed, lines 215 and 220 display it, and if the file 
logging option was set originally, the subrou- 
tine at line 4000 writes the result in a file. Here 
are simple examples of what these routines 
could look like: 

3000 IF LEN(value$) THEN out.rec$ = 

out.recS+valueS 
3005 RETURN 

4000 PRINT#2,recordnum;out.recS 
4010 RETURN 

Obviously, "real" data entry programs will 
have much more elaborate processing and edit- 
ing functions built in. This example was only a 
guide to how you might incorporate these tech- 
niques into your own programs. 

Try This One. Some things you might want 
to try in order to improve the program could in- 
clude expanding the info% array to contain 
more information about editing. (Such as: Is the 
data alphabetic or numeric? Does it have a fixed 
decimal place? Can it have a null value, or must 
some nonblank or nonzero value be used?) For 
fixed record layout output (like simulating rec- 
ords on a keypunch machine — yuck!) you 
might want to add fields to define where in the 
output record the value is to be placed (starting 
byte and length, for example). If you are reaUy 
clever, you can modify the routine to accept 
multiline fields. Remember, also, that there is 
nothing sacred about the beginning of the pro- 
gram either. The subroutines could just as easily 
be used within a completely different environ- 
ment to support your program's screen-han- 
dling needs. 

Final Last Challenge (Maybe). Last 
month's Last Challenge wasn't. It actually 
applies to this month's Third Basic, so look 
back and have fun. )l

SOFICfiRD 
Symposium 

by Gteg TibbettsI 




I iimiii 



Welcome to the third and final installment in our series on DDT. As 
you'll recall, last month we defined some changes to the Digital Re- 
search program Dump.Com that enabled us to provide hard copy output 
instead of screen output at the request of the user. The changes were 
made using only DDT, without reediting or reassembling the source file. 
We promised to demonstrate this month how to install those changes — 
and how to debug them if necessary. We also said that we had made sure 
it would be necessary. 

At the end of last month's column, we had identified the points at 
whidi we wctc going to replace the existing instruction with the J MP or 
CALL instructions that linked our new routines. Our first task this time, 
then, is to select a suitable place in memory in which to install the new 
routines. It's obvious that we must place the routines beyond the last 
program instruction, but we must also be sure to place them beyond the 
last address used by the program for the storage of data. Unfortunately, 
with most programs that you'll be modifying without the source file, the 
method for determining a safe location is a combination of program re- 
view and guesswork. In many cases you won't even have the luxury of 
knowing the true length of the program except to the nearest 128 bytes, 
since DDT always loads to the end of the last 128-byte disk file record 
shown in the record count byte in the disk directory. Whether a program 
ends 3 bytes within this last record or 103 bytes, the information present- 
ed by DDT will be the same. 

The Big Three. Data areas used by the program are usually of three 
types: single variables, auxiliary stack space, and buffers or tables (small, 
medium, and potentially large, respectively). Sometimes these areas im- 
mediately follow the end of the program. At other times they are far be- 
yond the last program instruction. This is the information you must 
discover. 

Many times, a thorough knowledge of what the program is designed 
to do can eliminate a lot of work. Reading or writing disk buffers, for ex- 
ample, suggests that memory is possibly being set aside to handle the 
buffers during transfer, modification, or both. When you have reason to 
suspect this is the case, it's usually easier to examine the code and find 
such memory usage. Once you've positively identified it, you can either 
place your new routines beyond the buffers or you can modify the buffer 
locations themselves so they begin beyond your new code. 

For the most part, starting at an even page number beyond the end 
of the program clears the small variables used as temporary storage and 
so on. Depending on the length of the new stack space (if any) set aside 
by the original programmer, they may also be cleared by starting at the 
next page of memory. You can easily tell whether you need to take the 
stack into account because the programmer will have had to use stack 
pointer manipulation instructions. It is easy to spot the new value being 
placed in the stack pointer (usually with an LXI SP,xxxx) and to use this 
value. Since stack storage is always down in memory (addresses decreas- 
ing) from the value of the stack pointer, the value becomes the effective 
end of stack space. 

From an examination of the code, we see that the new value being 



placed in the stack pointer is 02A2H. Note: This may differ slightly de- 
pending on whether you are working with the modified or unmodified 
versions and whether you have customized our earlier modifications. In 
any case, if we set the location for our new routines at the beginning of 
the next page (in this case 0300H) then we'll clear this area, as well as any 
miscellaneous variables that may follow the stack. 

Further examination of the program tells us that although disk ac- 
cess is definitely a part of Dump's operation, no special program buffers 
are maintained to manipulate the data. Only the standard CP/M buffer 
at 80H is used. The safest place to put our new routines, then, is at 
03(X)H. This is acceptable for Dump since it is not a large program nor is 
it space sensitive. But because one of the goals of programming is to be 
as efficient as possible, we should really try to cut it a bit closer. There- 
fore, we will use the value 02B0H. 

The code we will be inserting is reproduced here.

And the hex values for our question string would be as follows:

45,52,20,4F,52,20,53,2D,53,43,52,45,45,4E,3F,20,24 



We are now ready to install our routines. First, bring up DDT and at 
the same time load Dump.Com by typing 

DDT DUMP.COM 

Now begin installing the code by entering an A followed by the origin 
address; in this case, enter A2B0. Note: DDT does not require the H fol- 
lowing hexadecimal numbers but does require a 0 preceding all hex 
numbers that begin with letters. The lack of long error messages makes it 
difficult sometimes to tell exactly what you did wrong, so watch the en- 
tering of numeric values. DDT will respond with the address 2B0 and 
await entry of the mnemonic code. 

Our first instruction from the code given earlier is the JMP PRSTR 
(unless you are working with the unmodified version, of course), but 
DDT will not accept labels. For now, then, we'll just use JMP (XXX) and 
continue by entering the hex values for our message. Once done with 
that, we will come back and replace the 0000 with the correct address. 

When entering the string values (use the table given earlier), it's necessary 
to use the S command of DDT, since DDT will not accept pseudo 
ops like DB. So first get out of Assemble mode by typing a period on a 
line by itself and a return, then an S followed by the address that DDT 
said was next to be assembled; that is, the address shown when you typed 
the period. Continue entering the string values, following each with a re- 
turn, and when you're finished, enter a period to exit. 

Voila! The address that appeared when we typed the period is the 
value of PRSTR: use that value now with the S command to change the 
address field of the JMP instruction at 02 BOH. The address field is low 
byte first and begins at 02B1H, so you should be entering 

-S2B1 

028 1 00 D5 

0282 00 02 

0283 4F 

From now on, no more detailed help. 

Continue entering mnemonics from the list just given, using the label 
substitution technique we employed earlier when you run into labels not 
yet defined. Be sure you compute the two offset instructions (STA 
SKPIT-7 and JMP NTLWR-t-5) properly. These addresses should be 
those of the LDA 03 and LHLD 0F392H, respectively. Incidentally, the 
instruction that alters the value at SKPIT— 7 is known as self-modifying 
code since the program alters itself during execution. While this type of 
programming is not considered an acceptable procedure by many, it is 
widely used and quite often necessary to save space or gain speed. It can, 
however, make disassembly and debugging a nightmare at times. Final- 
ly, be sure to substitute the proper ASCII hex value for capital P at label 
NTLWR instead of doing it the way we represented it in the listing since 
DDT will not accept letter values. 

Pomp and Circumstance. Finished? Good. Provided you checked 
your work thoroughly, you have now earned the title of Apprentice As- 
sembler. Although an assembler does more than resolve label and ad- 
dress references, that is a major portion of its function. Not too bad, was 
it? Just to be safe, let's save our work to date by entering a control-C (be 
sure you are at the DDT minus sign prompt); then when the CP/M 



prompt returns, enter save 3 Newdimp.Com. 

Before actually linking routines into the original Dump code we are 
going to debug them. The first section will be our screen printing rou- 
tines. Get DDT and Newdump into memory as shown earlier and use 
the L command to verify that our routines are there and correct. When 
you encounter the string values, you'll see a long series of MOV instruc- 
tions. At this point, use the D command to display the ASCII values and 
verify this portion in that manner. 

Once you're convinced that all is there and complete, begin by using 
the G, for go, command. This command causes DDT to turn over exe- 
cution to the processor and to remain out of the picture so to speak. 
Execution proceeds at real-time speed and only returns to DDT if a Re- 
start 38 instruction takes place. This instruction causes control to pass to 
the address contained at memory location 38H. Because DDT patches 
its own recovery address into this location when initialized, control will 
return to DDT. 

Execute at Will. If an address is given following the G command, 
execution begins at that address. Another address separated by a com- 
ma (or a single address preceded by a comma) causes DDT to place a 
Restart 38 instruction in that second address. This makes the program 
execute until the second address is encountered, then return to DDT. In 
this case, we want to begin execution at the JMP PRSTR and stop before 
encountering the MVI C,01. Using the addresses associated with these 
instructions as aaaa and bbbb, enter Gaaaa,bbbb. You should get our 
message on the screen followed by the address bbbb and the DDT 
prompt. If you don't, try it again; and if you get the same result, recheck 
your code. When you get the proper response, proceed. 

Our second test is the input routine and printing of the carriage re- 
turn line feed combinations. For this we will use the go address of aaaa 
as before, but will change bbbb to the address of theCPI 60 instruction 
following the printing of our carriage return line feed sequences. Note that 
a G all by itself begins execution of the current value in the processor's 
program counter. 

When you execute this second section, you should get the screen mes- 
sage as before, but this time the cursor will be left at the end of the mes- 
sage and no return to DDT will take place. When this occurs, the pro- 
gram is awaiting your input. For test purposes, you may enter any single 
character, but remember that no return is required following your input 
character. Once you enter your input, it should appear (if printable) fol- 
lowing the message. Two carriage returns should be printed next, with 
the bbbb address and the DDT prompt printed after that. 

Everything in Order? Now that we have supposedly captured some 
input, we need to see what that input is in order to make sure the pro- 
gram has done what we expected. To do this, we need to examine the 
registers; we examine the registers using the X command for examine. 
When invoked, this command displays all of the register contents and 
provides a visual display of all the processor status flags, that is, a dis- 
play of the flag register. 

You'll notice also that the instruction located at the address indi- 
cated in the program counter is displayed at the far right. At this point 
you should see the ASCII value of the character you typed in the ac- 
cumulator. If you don't, then again something is wrong with your code 
or with the way you followed these instructions; try again. From now on 
we will want to be a little more careful since we will be manipulating the 
system itself (output vectors, and so on), so we'll begin using single steps 
rather than the go command. The next portion we wish to test is the code 
that discovers whether the input was lower case and, if so, converts it to 
upper case. First we'll need to put a lower-case value in the accumulator 
so we can test it. 

This is done using the X command also, but in this case, we follow 
the X command with the register or register pair we wish to alter, in this 
case the accumulator. The command, therefore, is XA followed by a re- 
turn. You'll see the computer print the register name and the current val- 
ue while it awaits your input of a new value. A return here leaves the con- 
tents unchanged, while a value followed by a return alters the contents to 
this value. For now, perform the XA command using a new value of 
61H. We can then use the T, for trace, command to cause one instruc- 
tion to be executed.

Wait, though; didn't we say that the current contents of the program 
counter would dictate which instructions were executed with G unless we 
specified an address? Yes, we did, and provided you have not done any 
further executions, or whatever, you'll find by using theX command that 
the program counter is still pointing at the address of our CPI 60 in- 
struction. If it were not, we could not use an address with the T com- 
mand, since any parameter used with it is interpreted as the number of 
instructions to trace, not the address to start. To alter the start address, 
we would have to use the X command with the letter P, for program 
counter. 

Dial X. You should now have the program counter set to the proper 
address, and can go ahead and do a single trace. When the trace is com- 
pleted, the same information should be displayed on the screen as when 
you entered the X command, plus an asterisk and the address to be exe- 
cuted next (note that this is the new address contained in the program 
counter). If you enter the X command again, the new contents of the 
program counter and the new instruction will be displayed, as will possi- 
ble changes in the flag register. 

Is the number following the C in the flag register now a 0? It should 
be, since this indicates that the carry flag was cleared during our last op- 
eration, meaning that the value in the accumulator was greater than or 
equal to 60H (and we made sure that it would be). In practice, of course, 
this would indicate lower case or some other high ASCII value. 

The program counter should now be pointing to the JC NTLWR in- 
struction. Do a T2 to execute both the JC and XRI instructions, then do 
an X and examine what has happened to the register contents. Is it what 
you expected? If you wish to check the operation of this code with an 
upper-case value, use XA and XP to alter the accumulator to the value 
you select and the program counter to point at the CPI 60 instruction. 
This time, try using the U, for untrace, command of the form U2 to 
bring you to the CPI 'P' instruction. 

Untrace differs from trace only in that it does not print the register 
and status information for each instruction, only for the last one exe- 
cuted. You may wish to continue experimenting with executing the code 
via single or multiple stepping and breakpointing up to NTLWR for 
various values input. 

Start Your Printers. To test the next portion of code, that is, our 
vector-swapping portion, you will have to have your printer hooked up 
and active. At some point in the test, you'll find that output has switched 
to the printer. There's no harm done when this occurs, since executing 
the routine a second time will change things back. It can be disconcert- 
ing, however, if you are not expecting it. 

One note of caution, though; do not under any circumstances exe- 
cute the RET instruction at SKPIT unless you have arrived there via a 
CALL instruction. The reason should be obvious, but we'll cover it 
anyway. 

Since we have not executed a CALL, no return address has yet been 
placed on the stack. When a RET is executed via DDT, therefore, it will 
obediently fetch the two bytes currently pointed to by the stack pointer and 
place them in the program counter. Obviously, this will be disastrous because 
these two bytes do not represent a valid program address, so be careful. 
Also, keep in mind that when using the trace command, what 
you see on the screen is the instruction you have just executed, not the 
one you are about to execute. The only command that shows you what 
you are about to execute is the X command. 

You may now execute the vector swap section of code using what- 
ever commands you think are appropriate. At least part of the code 
should be done using trace, however, so that you can stop and use the D 
command to examine memory and be sure the vectors are actually being 
swapped by the routine and that FLAG and FLAG2 are being proper- 
ly handled (that is, that FLAG contains FFH whenever the printer is in- 
voked and that FLAG2 contains the normal contents of address 
F3BBH). If this section is executed twice, FLAG2 will no longer be ac- 
curate, so it's a good idea to record on paper the original contents of 
F3BBH so you can place them into FLAG2 when you are through with 
this section. Again, be sure that you do not execute the RET instruction! 

Just One More Detail, Igor. All that now remains in our testing ses- 
sion is to try out the last few instructions. Obviously, we will not want to 
execute the CALL instruction immediately following FLAG2, so our 



first instruction will be the LDA FLAG. FLAG at this point should be 
FFH; if it's not, use the S command to alter it. The zero flag in the flag 
register should be cleared (should be zero); if it's not, use the X com- 
mand with Z to clear it. Now use trace to execute the LDA FLAG and 
JZ SKPIT instructions. 

Did trace do what you expected? It shouldn't have. Can you figure 
out why? Was the zero flag set or cleared when the JZ instruction was 
executed? Our purpose with these instructions was to check FLAG, and 
if it was nonzero, that is, if we had swapped vectors, then to reswap 
them. If FLAG was zero, that is, if we hadn't swapped vectors, then we 
wanted to skip the whole thing and just return. Why didn't the zero flag 
get set to one when FLAG was obviously not zero? 

The answer (which believe it or not we've discussed before) lies in the 
fact that unlike the 6502, neither the 8080 nor the Z80 alter the zero flag on 
register load operations. In order to get the zero flag to represent the con- 
tents of the accumulator, you must perform a logical or arithmetic oper- 
ation on the accumulator. The way we have done this in the past is by 
using a single byte instruction that has no effect on the value in the ac- 
cumulator. 

What we need to do, then, is to insert, using the A command, the in- 
struction ORA A immediately following the LDA FLAG instruction. 
With this instruction in place, the zero flag will properly reflect the con- 
tents of the accumulator and will tell us if FLAG is zero or nonzero. 
When inserting this instruction, you will have to move everything fol- 
lowing it down one byte. This can be done with the M, for move, com- 
mand, but it's just as easy in cases like this to reenter the four instruc- 
tions while in the Assemble mode. On your own now, use G, T, or U to 
execute these last few instructions with different values in FLAG. Con- 
tinue until you are satisfied that everything is working properly. 

Test Drive. If everything is okay, we're ready to link in the routines 
and go for a trial run. First, go to the beginning of the Dump program 
and, using L, find the LDA F3BB instruction we identified last month as 
the one we're going to replace. Those of you who did not see last month's 
column and are working with the unmodified Dump program will be re- 



placing the STA instruction immediately following the first MVI A,80H 
instruction encountered. If you are replacing this latter one, be sure that 
you have placed the STA instruction at the beginning of our new routine 
and that you have not inserted the LDA F3BB instruction just before 
SKPIT. In either case, when you find the appropriate instruction, use the 
A command to replace it with a CALL 02B0 (if you used a different ori- 
gin, be sure to use your address here). 

We link in our exit routine in exactly the same way, using the loca- 
tion we identified last month. Again, for those of you who did not see 
last month's column, replace a CALL statement towards the end of 
the original Dump program. Its location is determined by looking at the 
list output of DDT for the first part of Dump and finding what happens 
if the attempt to open the file to be dumped fails. Rather than repeat the 
entire lengthy process to find this out, look at the assembly listing con- 
tained on your SoftCard master disk. You will see the process by which 
Dump is terminated if the open-file attempt fails. The instruction we'll be 
replacing is the CALL in the exit routine immediately following the 
LHLD instruction. Be sure that the CALL you replace is duplicated 
where indicated in our new exit routine and then replace it using the A 
command with a CALL to the address immediately following FLAG2. 

That's a Wrap. This marks the end of our efforts and we should im- 
mediately save the entire program the way we did earlier by exiting DDT 
and using the CP/M save command. Before doing so, however, use the S 
command to make sure that both FLAG and FLAG2 are zero. Our rou- 
tine depends on FLAG being zero unless we change it. Once you have 
done this, exit DDT and perform the CP/M save command as follows: 

SAVE 3 NEWDUMP.COM 

Try your new Dump program by using it on itself or on any other 
convenient file. If it doesn't seem to work, go back into DDT and use the 
debugging techniques we demonstrated earlier to determine the prob- 
lem. If you followed the text faithfully, any problem you encounter 
should be something small. But in any case, the experience of finding it 
will go a long way towards increasing your mastery of this powerful tool.

□ The Agency for Instructional Television 

(Bloomington, IN), on the recommendation of 
U.S. and Canadian educators, has proposed a 
cooperative project between the two countries 
to develop instructional materials combining 
the use of microcomputers and television. Ac- 
cording to Saul Rockman, AIT's director of re- 
search, the project is designed to improve the 
problem-solving abilities of students in grades 
six through eight. Along with microcomputer 
and television materials, it will include instruc- 
tional print material, a teacher in-service train- 
ing seminar, and a series of policy studies on the 
use of microcomputers in education. 

"There are some striking parallels between 
the introduction of microcomputers into the 
classroom and the advent of school television in 
the 1950s and early 1960s," says Rockman. "It 
was felt that AIT, with thirteen years of experi- 
ence in cooperative television projects, could 
help develop instructional materials using both 
microcomputers and video programming. We 
hope the project illustrates the best of what edu- 
cation can do when agencies join together."

This month we are going to design and start to build our first major 
program, a utility that permits us to create and manipulate shape tables 
easily. We aren't using much new vocabulary this time. However, we are 
introducing a major new concept, that of the logical variable. 

Actually, any numeric variable can be treated as a logical variable. It 
works like this. If X is equal to zero, we call it false. If it is equal to any 
other value, we call it true. Take a look at these two examples: 

X = 5: IF X THEN PRINT "X IS TRUE" 

X = 0: IF NOT X THEN PRINT "X MUST BE FALSE" 

If X means, "If X is true (that is, not equal to zero) then . . ." it fol- 
lows that if not X means, "If X is false (equal to zero) then. . . ." Clear as 
mud. 

The Apple can also evaluate an expression logically. If the expres- 
sion is true, it will return a value of 1; if false, a value of 0. Try these 
examples on for size: 

X = 7: Y = 2: PRINT (X = Y), (X<Y), (X>Y) 
or even better 

A = B = C: PRINT A,B,C (Hint: think of this expression as: A = (B = C) 
and evaluate right side first) 

This is fun. Now that you have a sense of how logical variables work, 
let's get on with the heavy stuff — program design. We want to build a pro- 
gram that will permit us to draw shapes easily, examine them, and save 
them in a table if they look worth saving. We also want to avoid all that 
number crunching that we did last month. No point in straining our 
brains. 

Saddle Up the Four Horsemen. A moment of consideration suggests 
that what we really need are four miniprograms that work together. The 
first allows us to draw a shape on the screen; the second converts it into a 
shape table when we're finished; the third permits us to change its size, 
color, position on the screen, and angle of rotation; and the fourth al- 
lows us to save it, load in a new shape, or go back and edit it some more. 
If we break down the problem this way, each bite becomes more man- 
ageable and less intimidating. 

Let's take a whack at that first miniprogram by writing a routine 
that permits us to draw a shape on the hi-res screen. As it draws, let's 
have it save our actions in an array, which we can convert into a shape 
table when we are done. 

First things first. Of course, everyone remembers how to turn on 
page 1 of the hi-res graphics: 

10 HGR: POKE -16302,0 

HGRtilrns on page 1 of hi-res graphics (which we are going to use just 
in case there are still any of you out there who only have 16K of mem- 
ory in your computer). That poke may look a little unfamiliar, however. 
It's really the same as 49234, which we discussed in March and which

closes the text window at the bottom of the page. (If you subtract 65,536 
from an address, you get a negative number that works as well as the 
positive one.) We are going to use the negative versions in this month's 
column because the positive addresses introduced earlier are, unfor- 
tunately, not the ones given in your manuals. So, even though they are 
simpler to understand, they may be a source of confusion. For the rec- 
ord, figure 1 displays both sets of equivalent addresses: 

Next let's think about the array that we are going to be stuffing our 
instructions into. We could set it up as a one-dimensional array and keep 
sticking our instructions into it one after another. However, as you re- 
member from last month, all instructions are combined into pairs, which 
are then stored as a single number in the shape table. We can save our- 
selves some work in the second miniprogram if we store our instructions 
in pairs. 

Put on Your 2-D Glasses. One way we can do this is to create a two- 
dimensional array, two numbers wide by any number long. Then we will 
load our instructions two by two into this array until we are ready to 
continue. 

Let's call our array Vectr (short for vector since these are vector 
shapes we are storing) and reserve space for it in memory with a dimen- 
sion statement: 

20 DIM VEGTR(1,100) 

What this statement says is that we want to set aside enough variable 
space for an array containing 202 variables. Where do we get the 202? 
Well, computers don't count from 1; they count from 0. So when we ask 
to reserve space for an array with dimensions 1 by 1(X), your Apple goes 
to work like this: 



(0,0) 
(0,1) 
(0,2) 
(0,3) 



(1,0) 
(1,1) 
(1,2) 
(1,3) 



(0,100) (1,100) 

In other words, it sets aside a 2-by-lOl area, since the number 1 is the 
second number in your Apple's alphabet. If this seems strange, imagine 
how our habits look from your Apple's point of view. We could have 
made the array larger, but 100 seemed like a nice place to stop (if you 
want to draw really large shapes, you can always come back and change 
this later). 

Let's Make 'Em Talk. The next thing to do is set up some initial 
values for variables. We'll need a couple to tell us which value in our ar- 
ray we are filling next. Let's call the first Snum (for switching number). It 
will keep track of whether the value of the first array coordinate is 0 or 
1 and switch back and forth between them as we fill up the array. We will 
call the second variable Bnum (for byte number). Since it will keep track 
of the actual number of bytes we are going to eventually need for our 
shape table — which is the same as the second array coordinate — we 
know that this number will be somewhere between 0 and 100. 

We'll also need a couple to keep track of the X and Y coordinates on 
the hi-res screen (we'll want to set initial values for these somewhere near 
the middle of the screen). And we'll need one to remember whether we 
are in plot-and-move mode or in move-only mode. Let's call this last one 
Coir for color. If we set it equal to 3 when we are in plot-and-move mode 
and to 0 when we are in move-only mode, then it will represent the cor- 
rect color to plot on the hi-res screen at those times as well as a flag to re- 
mind us which mode we are in. 



SEPTEMBER 1982 



61 



The variable setup line could look like this: 

100 COLR = 3:X = 140:Y = 96:SNUM = 0:BNUM = 0 

Actually, you don't need to initialize variables whose starting value 
will be 0, since the starting value of all variables is assumed to be 0 until 
you tell your Apple something different. But it may help us to get organ- 
ized to think out which variables we will need in advance. 

Here We Go Loop de Loop. Next, we need to set up our loop. The 
loop needs to do four things. First, it has to read our commands from the 
keyboard. Second, it has to figure out what they mean. Third, it must 
draw whatever line we have asked for on the screen. And fourth, it has to 
save a record of our instruction in the array Vectr. 

Let's use the same input routine we used before, the live key routine 
that keeps checking the keyboard to see if a key has been pressed. If no 
key has been pressed, we will want to blink a dot on the screen so we can 
tell where we are in our drawing. Try this: 

120 HCOLOR= 3: HPLOT X,Y: HCOLOR= 0: HPLOT X,Y 
130 IF PEEK ( - 16384) < 128 THEN 120 

140 KEY = PEEK ( - 16384):KEY$ = CHR$ (KEY - 128): POKE 
- 16368,0 

As long as no key is pressed, line 130 will keep returning control to 
line 120, which first plots X,Y in white (Hcolor = 3) and then in black 
(Hcolor = 0). which has the effect of erasing the plotted dot. If we do 
press a key, then line 140 figures out which key it was, stores the charac- 
ter in KEYS, and clears the keyboard strobe. 

Next we move on to the problem of interpreting the key that has 
been pressed. Line 140 puts the keystroke into the string KEYS, which 
we can then compare against our different control codes. So the first 
thing we have to do is decide what our control codes ought to be. 

We can use the I,J,K, and M edit diamond for motion, and toggle be- 
tween plot-and-move and move-only modes with the X and C keys. In 
each case we can spot the key with an //statement: 

150 IF KEY$ = "I" THEN Y = Y - 1:BYTC0DE = 0 

If we press the I key, we want to move upwards on the screen. By 
subtracting 1 from the Y variable, the next time we plot X,Y (in line 120), 
it will plot one dot higher, since the smaller Y is, the closer you are to the 
top of the screen. We also want to set the variable Bytcode to 0, which is 
a value we will store in our array so we can remember this step. 

Other // statements will look similar 

160 IF KEYS = "J" THEN X = X - 1:BYTC0DE = 3 
170 IF KEY$ = "K" THEN X = X + liBYTCODE = 1 
180 IF KEYS = "M" THEN Y = Y + liBYTCODE = 2 
190 IF KEYS = "X" THEN COLR = 3 
200 IF KEYS = "0" THEN COLR = 0 
210 IF KEYS <> CHRS (13) THEN 120 

Now, if the control code we hit was one of the edit diamond keys, we 
want several things to happen. First, we want to change the value of X or 
Y, which we have done. Second, we want to store the command in our 
array before moving on to the next command. As we have written the 
code so far, the program will keep looping back to line 120 until we hit 
the return key (which is the same as character 13). 

Holler If It Goes Wrong. That isn't what we want to have happen, 
so let's change line 210 and add another line of code: 

147 BYTCODE = 999 

210 IF BYTCODE = 999 AND KEYS <> CHR$(13) THEN 120 

If we hit any of the four edit keys, Bytcode will be reset to a new 
value, and line 210 will no longer send program control back to line 120. 
So now we have a chance to save our new instruction in the array. First, 
however, we should add the instruction that ships us off to the second 
miniprogram: 



gin, the one that converts the shape array into a shape table in memory. 

Those who read last month's column will recall that there are eight 
commands that can be entered into a shape table. Half of them are plot- 
and-move commands; the other half arc move-only commands. The 
move-only commands are given numbers from 0 to 3, depending on di- 
rection; plot-and-move commands range from 4 to 7. Up to now the four 
values we have given Bytcode have ranged from 0 to 3. However, if Coir 
is equal to 3, it means that we are in plot-and-move mode, so we have to 
add 4 to the value of Bytcode to give it the correct value. That's pretty 
simple if you understand the concept: 

220 IF COLR = 3 THEN BYTCODE = BYTCODE + 4 

Now we're ready to save our value in the array: 

230 VECTR(SNUM,BNUM) = BYTCODE 

Next we have to change the values of Snum and Bnum so that we are 
ready to fill the next item in the array the next time we pass this way: 

240 SNUM = NOT (SNUM): IF SNUM THEN BNUM = BNUM + 1 

Look at all those marvelous logical variables! If anybody under- 
stood that line the first time they read it, they should be doing this for a 
living. Let's take a close look at how we are filling up our array. The 
starting value of Snum was 1. Each time that we encounter line 240, 
Snum becomes Not Snum. In other words, if it was 1, it becomes 0. If it 
was 0, it becomes 1. 

Lands a One-Two Punch. Now look at the second half of line 240. It 
says, "If Snum equals 1 then increase Bnum by 1." Very straightfor- 
ward. So look at what happens to our array each time we pass this line: 

SNUM BNUM VECTR(SNUM,BNUM) 

1 0 VECTR(1,0) First entry 

0 0 VECTR{0,0) Second entry 

1 1 ' VECTR(1,1) Third entry 
0 1 VECTR(0,1) Fourth entry 



215 IF KEYS = CHRS(13) THEN HCOLOR = 
1000 



0: HPLOT X,Y: GOTO 



When we press the return key, that indicates that we are finished 
drawing our picture. Line 215 will then erase our cursor from the screen 
and jump to line 1000, which is where our second miniprogram will be-

MOFTA 



SEPTEMBER 1982 



Gradually the array fills up. All that remains is to send the program 
back for another command and to clean up one little bug 

125 HCOLOR= COLR: HPLOT X,Y 
250 GOTO 120 

The reasoning behind line 250 should be obvious. However, line 125 
may only become so if you try to use the program before adding it. The 
problem is that your cursor is not leaving behind a trail of dots, whether 
you are in plot-and-move mode or move-only mode. Line 125 is de- 
signed to leave behind such a trail, but only if you are in plot-and-move 
mode. Try adding the line and see the difference. 

That's all there is to the first miniprogram. With it you can draw 
shapes on the screen and a record of your cursor movements is stored in 
the array called Vectr. Next we have to write a program that can take 
that array and turn it into a shape table, which can be poked into your 
Apple's memory. 

To Make a Moot Point Short. Let's assume for the sake of argu- 
ment that we are going to have only a single shape in our shape table and 
that we are going to poke it into page 3 of memory (the area that runs 
from $300 to $3FF, right below the text window). This makes our job 
much easier. As you may recall from last month, the first four bytes in a 
shape table with only one shape are always 1 , 0, 4, and 0. Therefore, the 
first lines of this section might be: 

1000 START = 768 

1010 POKE START.I: POKE START + 1,0: POKE START + 2,4: 
POKE START + 3,0: START = START + 4 

As you doubtlessly figured out, 768 is the decimal version of $300 
(just divide it by sixteen a couple of times to convince yourself). Next we 
want to set up a loop to poke our values one at a time into this area of 
memory: 

1020 FOR BYTE = 0 TO BNUM 

1050 NEXT BYTE 



Each pair of bytes is combined into a single number by taking the 
first number in the pair, multiplying it by 8 and then adding the second 
number (if this seems the reverse of what we did last month, keep in 
mind that we added the second number in each pair into the array first in 
this program). Then we poke the product into the appropriate spot in 
memory. 

1030 NUM = VECTR (0,BYTE) * 8 + VECTR(1 ,BYTE) 
1040 POKE START,NUM:START = START + 1 

Finally, we need to add a zero to the end of the table, and it is 
finished: 

1060 POKESTART,0 

This may not be easy to follow at first. In particular the use of Start 
as a shifting address and the use of the variable Byte to calculate the 
values to be poked into memory in line 1030 may be confusing. But look 
at those lines carefully and try them out with a few sample values. See if 
they don't make sense to you then. 

All Work and No Save. Next time we'll finish this program by add- 
ing the utilities that permit us to display this shape, manipulate it on the 
screen, and save it to disk or tape if we want to preserve it. In the mean- 
time, add the following lines so that you can use the program now 

2000 POKE 233, INT(START/256): POKE 232, START - (INT 

(START/256)*256) 
2010 TEXT : HOME : PRINT "THE SHAPE IS IN MEMORY" 

Line 2000 sets pointers to tell the Apple where the shape resides. 
We'll explain it in more detail next month. 

The commands we looked at last time — and indeed lines 40 through 
90 of last month's program — should give you a head start on using the 
shapes yourself. Note that the shape will remain in memory even if you 
type in or load another program. Try your hand at it and we'll compare 
notes next month. JM

For Cooling 



As soon as you move to 64K RAM or 
80 columns you need SYSTEM SAVER. 

Today's advanced peripheral cards 
generate more heat. In addition, the cards 
block any natural air flow through the Apple 
II creating high temperature conditions that 
substantially reduce the life of the cards and 
the computer itself. 

SYSTEM SAVER provides correct 
cooling. An efficient, quiet fan draws fresh 
air across the mother board, over the power 
supply and out the side ventilation slots. 




For Line Surge 
Suppression 

The SYSTEM SAVER provides essential 
pi-otection to hardware and data from 
dangerous, power surges and spikes. 

By connecting the Apple II power 
input through the SYSTEM SAVER, power 
is controlled in two ways: 1) Dangerous 
voltage spikes are clipped off at a safe 130 
volt RMS level. 2) High frequency noise is 
smoothed out before reaching the Apple II. 




For Operating 
Efficiency 

SYSTEM SAVER contains two switched 
power outlets. As shown in the diagram, 
the SYSTEM SAVER efficiently organizes 
your system so that one convenient, front 
mounted power switch controls SYSTEM 
SAVER, Apple II, monitor and printer. The 
heavy duty switch has a pilot light to alert 
when system is on. You'll never use the 
Apple power switch again!

The catalog is often the menu from which you or a user of your disk 
selects programs. It is like the table of contents of a book and should be 
maintained and presented in an attractive and orderly fashion. DOS does 
its best to keep things tidy, but it does have some quirks that are nice to 
know about. 

How File Names Are Stored. An initialized disk is divided mag- 
netically into thirty-five individual concentric tracks. DOS stores file 
names in the directory on central track 17. If you look at a high-mileage 
disk in just the right light, you can sometimes see the wear on this track 
through the oval hole in the disk sleeve. This track, like all of a 3.3 disk's 
tracks, is divided into sixteen sectors numbered 0 through 15. There are 
only thirteen sectors on a 3.2 disk, numbered 0 through 12. Track 17, sec- 
tor 0 contains a disk's VTOC (pronounced "vee-talk"), or volume table 
of contents. The VTOC is sort of a map of the disk, telling DOS where 
information about each file is stored. Each of the remaining fifteen sec- 
tors (1 through 15) of track 17 may contain up to seven file names. A 
disk may therefore contain a maximum of 105 (15 times 7) files. An at- 
tempt to save a 106th file will fail with a "disk full" error message — same 
as if you had tried to save more than the maximum 496 sectors on the 
disk. 

File Name Order. On a new 3.3 disk, the first seven files you save 
(actually save, bsave, or write) will have their names and certain infor- 
mation about the files stored on track 1 7, sector 1 5. Remember, we are 
only discussing file names here, and not the information contained in the 
file itself. File names 8 through 14 are stored on track 17, sector 14, 
names 15 through 21 are stored on sector 13, and so on, dowTi to sector 
1. Nice and orderly, right? Yes, but if you delete a file name, the next 
saved file's name will appear in the deleted file name's slot. In other 
words, DOS stores each new file name in the topmost available position 
in a catalog. If you have two or more files with the same name (made 
possible by renaming files), and you use that name in a DOS command, 
DOS will look no further than the first correct name it finds. 

Rearranging File Names. There are utilities on the market that will 
rearrange file names in a disk's catalog. Most give you the option of al- 
phabetizing file names; the better ones let you be a little more creative. 
Another popular option is the ability to undelete deleted files or file 
names that haven't been overwritten. 

One free utility, the Fid program on your System Master disk, lets 
you transfer files one by one from disk to disk. If your target disk, the 
disk you are transferring to, is blank (but initialized) when you start, you 
may transfer file names in any order you wish. 

You may want to insert several dummy file names in the middle or 
beginning of a catalog. As soon as your target disk has all of the perti- 
nent files transferred to it, delete the dummy files. Then you know that 
the next several files saved on that disk will appear in the catalog in the 
position of the deleted dummy file names. For example: 

CATALOG 
A 030 FILE #1 
A 044 FILE #2 
A 002 DUMMY-1 
A 002 DUMMY-2 
A 002 DUMMY-3 



A 022 FILE #3 
A 035 FILE #4 
A 020 and so on . . . 

If you create a catalog similar to the one above, then delete files 
Dummy- 1 through Dummy-3, the next files saved will appear in positions 
3, 4, and 5 in the catalog. An easy way to create or delete dummy file 
names is to write a short program. Type new or FP and enter. 

10 FOR X = 1 TO 3: REM NUMBER OF FILE NAMES 
20 PRINT CHR$(4); "SAVE DUMMY-";X: REM OR "DELETE 

DUMMY-";X 
30 NEXT X 

Secret File Names. Suppose you want to keep someone from run- 
ning one of your programs or examining one of your files. The easiest 
(and unfortunately best known) method is to include a control character 
as part of a file name. Control characters will not show on the screen as 
part of a file's name. As a test, enter a one-line program and type: 

SAVE P(control-P)ROGRAM (return) 

If you are new to this sort of thing, all you do is type save p. then 
hold down the control key while you type a p. then release the control 
key, type rogram, and hit return. When you catalog the disk, you will not 
see the control-P, only "program." An attempt to access Program with a 
load or save command, however, will result in a file not found message. 
As long as you remember what you typed, this is a useful trick. To re- 
name the file above, type: 

RENAME P(control-P)ROGRAM, ANYNAME (return) 

Here's another tricky kind of file name that's not real useful, but is 
fun. Type: 

SAVE H(control-J)E(control-J)L(control-J)L(control-J)0(control-G) 
(return) 

If you forget what control characters you have imbedded into your 
file names, or if you just want to do some snooping on someone else's 
disk, here is a program that reveals hidden control characters in cata- 
logs. It is a modified version of the program on page 151 of the DOS 
manual: 

10 REM CTRL-FINDER PROGRAM 
20 DATA 201, 141, 240, 21 

30 DATA 234, 234, 234, 234, 201, 128, 144, 13, 201, 160, 176, 9 
40 DATA 72, 132, 53, 56, 233, 128, 76, 249, 253, 76, 240, 253 
50 FOR N = 768 TO 795: READ A: POKE N,A: NEXT N 
60 POKE 54, 0: POKE 55,3: CALL 1002 

Running this program will reveal any invisible control character except a 
control-M (carriage return) as a visible inverse character. Control Finder 
will work not only with file names, but with any screen appearance of a 
control character. To prove it, run Control Finder and type:

with a beep and a well-deserved syntax error for typing this illegal 
DOS command (see July's DOS Mystery of the Month). With the Con- 
trol Finder program in effect, instead of the invisible but audible beep, 
you will get a visible, but inaudible, inverse-G. If you really hate the Ap- 
ple's beep, you could make the Control Finder Toutine part of your greet- 
ing program. To cancel the effect, type PR^ or hit reset (or pull the 
plug!). 

To have some more fun, change line 20 in Control Finder to: 
20 DATA 234, 234, 234, 234 

Now, even control-Ms (carriage returns) will appear in inverse. Catalog a 
disk and you'll see why an exception was made for control-Ms. All of the 
carriage returns have been nullified, making most screen layouts rather 
difficult to read! 

While no one's watching, fool around some more with the left arrow 
key, control-G, control-J, control-X, and other control characters and 
commands. Hit reset to return to reality. 

Invisible File Names. This trick won't foil the Control Finder pro- 
gram, but it sure will keep most people out of your files. First, hit reset to 
kill Control Finder's effect. Now save a program with this command 

PRINT CHR$(4); "SAVE A"; CHR$(8) (return) 

What you have done is save a split file name that is part normal charac- 
ter, A, and part control character, CHR$(8). CHR$(8) is the same as a 
backspace or control-H. A control-H is normally impossible to type di- 
rectly on the screen without backspacing the cursor, so we use its CHR$ 
(character string) equivalent. To save or otherwise manipulate a split file 
name, we need to use a CHR$(4) or control-D in front of the DOS com- 
mand. The same command could, of course, be executed from within a 
program. 

If you haven't already done so, catalog your disk and notice the in- 
visible file name that has been created. If you run Control Finder, you will 
see that the file's actual name is "A(control-H)". That's the letter A fol- 
lowed by a backspace. Since DOS adds spaces to any file name shorter 
than thirty characters, the actual file name is: 

A (backspace) (28 spaces) 

When you catalog, the letter A is actually printed on the screen, but is 
then immediately, if not sooner, erased by the first of the twenty-eight 
spaces! 

To erase the lock, file-type, and sector codes to the left of a file name, 
just add eight backspaces to a file name like so: 

H$ = CHR$(8): H$ = H$ + H$ + H$ + H$ + H$ + H$ + H$ + H$ 
(return) 

PRINT CHR$(4); "SAVE A"; H$ (return) 

Now the trailing spaces start at the far left of the screen, erasing every- 
thing to the right and producing a horizontal blank line in your catalog! 
You can use this feature as a nice spacer to dress up your catalogs or to 
separate file names by category. By the way, invisible file names will 
transfer just fine with Fid and other file-transfer utilities. To make more 
than one invisible file name in the same catalog, start each one with a dif- 
ferent visible letter. 

Inverse and Flashing File Names. Inverse and flashing file names are 
often used as decorative catalog headers. Such file names usually belong 
to empty files that are not meant to be accessed. The only way / know to 
access a file whose name contains inverse or flashing characters is from 
immediate mode (not from within a program) by typing the appropri- 
ate DOS command {load, for example) and then tracing over the name 
(see last month's column). 

The following trick will produce an inverse file name. First, save a file 
named File, and then type: 



PRINT " RENAME FILE,";: INVERSE: PRINT 
NORMAL 



INVISI-CALC 



After you hit return, you will see a DOS command on the screen made 
up of normal and inverse characters. Use escape-I to move your cursor 
up to the left of the word rename and trace over the command using the 
right arrow and repeat keys. Then hit return and let DOS do its thing. 
That's all there is to it! Notice how it is legal to start a file name with an 



inverse space, but not a normal space. Flash works the same way, as does 
any combination of flash, inverse, and normal characters. Please take it 
easy with the flashing file names, okay? A little goes a long way! 
I like to use this little flasher at the top of my catalogs: 

PRINT " RENAME FILE, COPYRIGHT {";: FLASH: PRINT "C"\: 
NORMAL: PRINT ") 1982" 

Trace over the resulting command and you'll get the picture. 

One More Thought about File Names. More and more people with 
noncomputer backgrounds are using computers these days (and I'm one 
of them). If you are creating disks to be used by the public, think about 
the file names that apjxar in your disks' catalogs; name them in English. 
Nothing is more confusing to a beginner than a file called Fil.obj3.rev. 
Computing is tough enough! 

DOS Mystery of the Month. Chris Volpe is full of Apple mysteries, 
and here's another one. Run this Applesoft program: 

10 PRINT CHR$(4); "OPEN CHANGER" 
20 PRINT CHR$(4); "WRITE CHANGER" 
30 PRINT "15 REM THIS IS A TEST" 
40 PRINT "16" 
50 PRINT CHR$(4); "CLOSE" 

After running the above program, you will have a text file called Changer 
on your disk. Now run this program: 



10 
15 
16 
18 
19 
20 



PRINT 
PRINT 
PRINT 
LIST 

PRINT CHR$(4 
GOTO 10 



■LINE 10" 
■LINE 15" 
■LINE 16" 



■EXEC CHANGER" 



The exec command in line 19 doesn't do its job, that is, change line 15 
and delete line 16. And if you're in need of a httle garbage, just try and 
stop the program with a control-C! If line 20 is removed, things work out 
much more predictably. Exec executes properly only if it is the last com- 
mand in a program. Has anyone out there seen any documentation that 
doesn't sidestep putting exec commands inside Applesoft programs (in- 
stead of at the end) so that they work?

THEJEPPSON 

nSASSENBLER 

FOR THE APPLE III 

Bv )OHn lEPPson 



Do seaets drive you crazy? Do mysterious code files evoke frenzied 
storms of curiosity? You need a disassembler. Here's how to unravel 
those streams of binary digits and reconstruct the assembly language list- 
ings from which they were produced. 

You will need peek and poke as described in the August issue of Sof- 
talk. This program uses peek and poke to pry into any portion of mem- 
ory you desire, and then disassembles the machine language code you 
find there. 

Illuminating Files. There are two distinct, but similar, tasks. First is 
the problem of disassembling code currently resident in the Apple Ill's 
memory. This will allow you to trace the code paths actually used in pro- 
grams and in SOS (pronounced "sauce"), the Sophisticated Operating 
System. The second task is disassembling code files, such as drivers and 
interpreters, on floppy disks. Files on disk usually contain a lot of stuff 
that's either omitted or reworked when the file is loaded into memory. So 
it is instructive to examine files as they actually exist on the disk. 

The disassembler program performs both of these tasks. It contains 
compiler options, which can be set to compile the program in two differ- 
ent ways. This means that the program produces two different exe- 
cutable code files, one for disassembling memory, the other for disk files. 
The sixth line of the main program listing reads i*$setc disk : = false *). 
This instruction creates a compile-time variable, disk, as described on 
page 107, volume 2, of the Apple III Pascal manual. In this instruction 
disk is created as a Boolean variable and is assigned the value "false." 
This assignment directs the compiler to include certain sections of text 
and to exclude others, thereby producing a "memory" disassembler. The 
resulting code file should be stored under its own distinct file name, such 
as M.Disasm.Code. By changing the compile-time variable assignment 
to Ttad(*$setc disk . = true *), and recompiling, you will cause the com- 
piler to include different sections of text. This time the result will be a 
"disk file" disassembler which might be stored under the file name 
D.Disasm.Code. 

What You Can't Do. As you are doubtless well aware, Apple III al- 
ready has a Monitor that has some of the facilities available in the Apple 
II Monitor. It does not contain a disassembler. It's true that it's possible 
to load a machine language disassembler while in emulation mode (or 
even, if you're clever, in Apple III native mode). You can then enter the 
Apple III Monitor and have a functional disassembler. But that ap- 
proach has many limitations, the worst of which is that once the Moni- 
tor is entered there is no way out again except to reboot. The Apple III 
Monitor is entered by simultaneously pressing control, open-apple, and 
reset. Its code runs on the Apple III ROM chip normally used for boot- 
ing. (There are rumors that the Monitor may be omitted from future ver- 
sions of Apple III.) 

There are other limitations as well. Since the Monitor code runs in 
ROM, which overlies the upper part of SOS, there is no way to look at 
those areas of SOS without hanging the computer. Also, I/O from the 
Monitor is possible, but only at the read-write-track-sector level. So load- 
ing files from disk for disassembly or saving results is beset by com- 
plexities of depressing magnitude. Finally, there is no straightforward 
means of integrating other procedures, such as search routines, into the 



Monitor environment. The disassembler program presented here is de- 
signed to overcome these limitations. It has no connection with the Ap- 
ple III Monitor, which we will henceforth ignore. 

How Does It Remember So Much? Apple Ill's memory is organized 
as a collection of 32K banks, so in a 128K machine there are four dif- 
ferent memory banks, each 32K long ($8000 hexadecimal). A 256K 
machine will have eight such banks. One bank is allocated for special 
treatment and is called the S or system bank. It belongs to SOS. The re- 
maining banks are user banks, numbered from 0 to 2 in a 128K machine 
or 0 to 6 in a 256K machine. 

This is a big memory. Too big, in fact, for the 6502 processor to han- 
dle directly. By itself the 6502 can address only 64K (65,536) separate lo- 
cations. That is the total number of different combinations of sixteen bi- 
nary bits, or of four hexadecimal digits. To provide access to all of Ap- 
ple Ill's memory you need a longer zip code, up to twenty binary bits. 
Those extra bits are provided by the Xbyte, named for the "extended ad- 
dressing system." 

The overall scheme is to slice up memory into 64K chunks and let the 
6502 processor work on just one 64K chunk during any single opera- 
tion. Since memory is organized in 32K banks, this means that the 6502 
can handle two banks at a time. The 6502 just looks for a location be- 
tween $0000 and $FFFF, a 64K range that you can think of as the 
6502's working space. These addresses are sort of a figment of the 6502's 
imagination. They don't actually represent particular bits of silicon wafer 
on the memory boards. The bank-switching mechanism, outside the 
6502, swaps various parts of physical memory into the address space the 
6502 is using. The Xbyte, and another register called the bank register, 
decide which parts of memory to use at any given time. 

Apple III actually has two different ways of combining memory 
banks into pairs: bank-switched addressing and extended addressing. 
Extended addressing is controlled by the Xbyte. If the Xbyte is $80 then 
the 6502 is presented with bank pair 0,1. If the Xbyte is $81, then the pair 
used is 1 ,2. In general, an Xbyte of $8n refers to bank pair n, n-l- 1 . In 
each case the 6502 has 64K memory locations to play with, but the ac- 
tual physical memory is different. Notice that a particular physical mem- 
ory location can have more than one address. For example, a location in 
the middle of bank 1 can be addressed as location $4000 with Xbyte = 
$81. This Xbyte refers to bank pair 1,2 where bank 1 "occupies" loca- 
tions $0000 to $7FFF. But exactly the same memory location can also be 
addressed as $C000 with Xbyte = $80. In this case we're referring to 
bank pair 0,1 where bank 1 "occupies" locations $8000 to $FFFF. The 
specified address will now be found at $8000 + $4000 = $C000. You 
may use whichever address is more convenient. 

If the Xbyte is $00, then extended addressing is turned off and you are 
in the realm of bank-switched addressing. In this case the 6502 looks at a 
bank pair made up of the S (system) bank and one of the user banks. But 
here there is a further complication. The S bank is split a little left of cen- 
ter and the user bank placed in the middle. The result appears in table 1 . 
This configuration is also called system bank addressing, and it is the 
way the 6502 looks at things most of the time. The bank register, loca- 
tion $FFEF of system bank (Xbyte = $00), determines which user bank 
is switched in at the moment. 

Program code actually runs using system bank addressing. The pro- 
gram code resides and runs either in S bank itself or in the switched-in 
user bank. You run along in one user bank for a while, and then change 
the bank register and run in another. But when the program, running in 
one bank, just needs to reach out and fetch a single byte of data from 
some other part of memory, then it's best to use extended addressing. 
With the appropriate Xbyte, extended addressing can access any byte in 
the machine. 

Looking at Memory. The function peek, used in the disassembler, 
requires both an Xbyte and a suitable 6502 address. It can get to any part 
of memory, but you must tell it where to go. So the "memory" disas- 
sembler has a procedure for entering Xbytes. The current Xbyte value is 
displayed at the top of the saeen. To change it, just press S (for set

Xbyte) on the keyboard and enter the new value. Table 2 lists the vari- 
ous meaningful Xbytes and the memory areas they represent. 

The "disk file" disassembler has slightly different requirements. Com- 
puters cannot deal with files directly on the disk. Apple III always reads 
files into memory and works on them there. The disk file disassembler re- 
quests the name of the file you wish to examine and loads it into mem- 
ory, up to a maximum of twenty-four blocks (24 blocks = 12,288 bytes 
= $3000). If the file is longer than twenty-four blocks you must look at it 
in pieces, twenty-four blocks at a time. To handle this situation the pro- 
gram asks you for the block number at which to begin the load. 

No Swearing, No Poking, No Xbyte. Once the file, or a suitable por- 
tion of it, is loaded into memory, you can look at individual bytes or dis- 
assemble sequences of bytes just as in the memory version. Simply use 
addresses $0000 up to the hexadecimal total number of bytes loaded. In 
other words, if the file loaded is five blocks long, and each block is 512 
($200) bytes, then the highest address is 5 * $200 = $0A00. The range of 
valid addresses, $0000 to $0A00, is calculated for you and kept on dis- 
play at the top of the screen. 

Some files, such as interpreters, are absolute code. Unlike drivers and 
assembly language modules, which have relocatable code, interpreters are 
designed to fit in a particular spot in memory. When you disassemble 
such files, you find that the file's program code accesses memory and 
jumps about using instructions with absolute addresses, such as LDA 
8FEF or JMP 9F25. To facilitate working with such files, you may set 
the disassembler's location counter to synchronize with the file's address 
scheme. Then if you see JMP 9F25 you can look at address 9F25 and be 
in the proper spot. To do this, the disassembler asks you to assign a start- 
ing address value to the file. If, for example, you reply with "7600," 
then a five-block file will have "valid" addresses $7600 to $8000 ($7600 + 
$0A00 = $8000). Again, the valid address range is kept in view at the top 
of the screen. 

Since the disk file version deals only with a limited range of ad- 
dresses, the Xbyte mechanism has no meaning and is omitted. Similarly, 
poking is not allowed in the disk file version since we are not dealing with 
the file itself, but only with a copy of the file in memory. In most other re- 
spects the two versions of disassembler are the same. 

Painless Operation. Operation of the disassembler program is de- 
scribed here mainly for the "memory" version, but the instructions can 
be taken to apply to the disk file version as well. The program operates 
much like the Apple II Monitor. All addresses and values are entered 
and displayed in hexadecimal. To examine a single memory location, just 
type in the hexadecimal address and press return. The program peeks at 
that location and prints its contents as a hexadecimal byte. To see more 
memory, just press return again. Repeated returns each yield the con- 
tents of an entire group of sixteen bytes all printed on a single line. This 
type of memory display, where bytes are printed as pairs of hexadecimal 
digits, is known, colloquially, as a hex dump. 

Since the Apple II Monitor caters to a forty-column screen, it can 
print only eight bytes to the line. But on Apple Ill's eighty-column screen 
there is plenty of room for sixteen bytes or more. In fact, since we do 
have plenty of room, those memory contents that fall in the range of 
printable characters (ASCII 32 to 127) are printed again, as characters, at 
the right of the screen. This is very convenient for locating strings. 

The procedure for examining larger blocks of memory is a bit differ- 
ent. An entire page of memory (256 bytes) may be displayed as a block 
by simply pressing P or by typing a hexadecimal address followed imme- 
diately by P and return (for example, FBOOP return). The location count- 
er is automatically updated so pressing P again will dump the following

memory page, and so on. The program always dumps an even page, so 
typing FB35P will still display the page of memory from FBOO to FBFF. 

In the memory version, the contents of memory may also be 
changed. Values may be poked into memory using the same format as 
with Apple II's Monitor. Just type in the hexadecimal address followed 
by a colon (:) and the new value. For example, the command 2FF5.vi/l 
will place the value "AA" in memory location 2FF5. As with the Apple 
II Monitor, it is possible to change a number of bytes (up to eighty-three) 
with a single command (for example, 2FF5:AA AC AE BO 82). When 
return is pressed the list of values will be poked into successive memory 
locations starting at the specified address. 

Pokers, Beware! Poking can actually be useful . . . occasionally. For 
example, the disassembler program has a user-defined procedure 
where you might wish to place routines for setting up and displaying 
graphics. You could then poke values into the graphics screen memory 
area as an aid in mapping the information storage scheme. 

Generally, however, poking is dangerous. When you're dealing with 
the Apple II Monitor, the Monitor program itself is running in read-only 
memory. Since you can't change ROM no matter how hard you try, the 
operating system and the program continue to run. With the Apple III, 
on the other hand, both the operating system and the disassembler pro- 
gram are in RAM. If you poke around in those areas, one of several 
things may happen. Sometimes the machine just drifts off into never- 
never land and becomes inert. Other times it dies horribly with "System 
Failure" plastered across the screen. In either event your only option is to 
reboot. Most disconcerting of all, poking may have no obvious effect 
whatever. That's when you really want to watch out. You've got a little 
time bomb in there somewhere just waiting for its chance to do you in. 

Generally speaking, of course, it's impossible to damage the hard- 
ware no matter what you do to programs in memory. When you reboot, 
all is forgiven and wiped clean. But this assumes the boot disk itself is un- 
damaged. That's where the real danger lies. It is said that piano players 
never injure anything but their fingers, and trumpet players their lips. 
Similarly, if you poke a few holes in the operating system, fate is sure to 
direct your little arrows straight to the code responsible for writing to 
floppy disks. The next time you write to a disk your damaged program 
will smear that disk's directory into an indecipherable mess. Since you're 
obviously a well-organized person, you'll have been working only from 
backup disks. So your original disks are safe and you can begin again. 
All you have lost forever is the work since your last backup, plus a few 
days that anger has deducted from your life expectancy. With an Apple 
Profile hard disk it's a bit tougher. After considerable practice, you can 
reformat the Profile and refill it from its eight backup floppies in little 
more than an hour. If you want to poke around, the best policy is to 
leave the hard disk turned off until you reboot. 

2001 Operand Oddities. The core of the disassembler program is the 
list command, which disassembles 6502 object code. It is almost exactly 
like its counterpart in the Apple II Monitor. Typing L, or an address fol- 
lowed by L, disassembles the next twenty 6502 instructions. Apple 1 1 pro- 
grammers will recognize the format: 

7A70: 68 PLA 

7A71: 85 FF STA FF

You'll find some oddities in the operand field, which are designed 
to comply with Apple III conventions. Instructions that employ indirect 
addressing use an at-sign (@) instead of parentheses. Thus LDA 
@ ADDR,X is Apple Ill's version of the standard 6502 instruction LDA 
(ADDR,X). In the absence of parentheses, preindexed and postindexed 
indirect addressing modes are distinguished only by the presence of X or 
Y, resfjectively. The at-sign is also used with indirect jumps, such as JMP 
@ADDR. 

Branch relative instructions such as BNE are followed by an arrow 
(->) and the computed address. The arrow isn't actually Apple III, it 
just seems desirable. 

The most significant change is in the BRK instruction. In Apple III 
the break instruction has been entirely dedicated to SOS calls. SOS calls 
invoke subroutines within the operating system that manipulate files.

Table 3. SOS calls. 



talk to drivers, allocate free memory, and perform many other complex 
tasks. SOS calls not only transfer control to the subroufine, they also 
pass information back and forth in the form of parameters. So SOS calls 
more closely resemble procedure and function calls of higher level lan- 
guages than the JSR instruction of assembly language. 

When the 6502 encounters a BRK instruction, it immediately trans- 
fers control to the interrupt system, which then leads directly into SOS. 
The interrupt is processed to determine its source, and if, indeed, the in- 
terrupt was generated by BRK, then the appropriate SOS call is exe- 
cuted. SOS goes back to the original code and picks up the next three 
bytes following the BRK instruction. Thus BRK has become, in effect, a 
four-byte instruction. The first byte is BRK (op-code $00). The second 
byte designates which of the thirty-six available SOS calls is desired. The 
third and fourth bytes contain a pointer to the address in memory of a 
data table in which parameter information has been placed and where re- 
sults are received. After the SOS call is complete, control is returned to 
the original code file at the next instruction beyond the four-byte SOS 
call. 

Is There a Beta Draft in Here? Table 3 lists the various SOS calls in- 
dexed by hexadecimal number. This is the number found in the second 
byte of the four-byte instruction. Each SOS call, in turn, has a required 
parameter list, and many have an optional parameter list as well. You get 
to the parameter list by following the pointer address given in bytes three 
and four of the SOS call. But at this point things get a bit complicated. 
Each SOS call demands a different length and format for its parameter 
lists. There is really no alternative but to look them up in the manual 
where each SOS call receives a couple of pages of description and infor- 
mation. "Ah!" you say, "the manual. What manual?" Why, the Apple III 
SOS Reference Manual, a voluminous document filled with all sorts of 
goodies. Does it exist? Almost. Even as you read this, a beta draft ver- 
sion of the SOS manual is circulating in limited numbers within Apple 
and in the hands of a few desperate others such as professional software 
vendors and students who have attended the Apple III Technical Work- 
shop. Beta draft is a happy expression that implies progress already made 
and the hope of progress yet to come. Indeed, inquiry reveals that Apple 
expects the SOS Reference Manual to be out and available later this au- 
tumn. 

SOS calls are not permitted just anywhere in a code file. SOS itself, 
SOS.Kernel, cannot use them at all. Neither can drivers or interrupt han- 
dlers. To do so would undoubtedly result in SOS calls calling them- 
selves, and SOS is not designed to be reentrant. But SOS calls are exten- 
sively used by interpreters, such as languages, by event handlers (maybe 
another time), and by assembly language modules such as invokable 
modules for Basic. And you may use them in your own assembly lan- 
guage modules. They are, in fact, the best and the only legal means of 
communication with files, devices, and other binary denizens of the out- 
side world. 

The disassembler normally displays its output on the console screen, 
but you can change that. Pressing letter O (for output) allows you to do 
direct hex dumps and disassembled listings to a printer or to a disk file or 
to any other device configured into your system. The first time you press 
O, you'll be asked for the path name of the device or volume to which 
output should be sent. This path name will then be displayed in the upper 
right-hand corner of the screen. Thereafter, every time you press O, the 
output destination will toggle back and forth between the console screen

and whatever destination you have specified. You may look around with 
the output directed to the screen. Then, when you find something inter- 
esting, you can toggle the output and save it on the designated device. 
But should you wish to change the alternate destination, you'll have to 
restart the program. 

The Sum of the Parts. The disassembler program is constructed in 
several parts. There is a library unit, Hexstuff, containing peek and poke 
and some utility procedures. A disk data file, Opcode. List, contains the 
text of the various 6502 instructions. And there is the program listing it- 
self The steps in construction are as follows: 

First type in and assemble peek and poke as listed in the August is- 
sue of Softalk. Save the resulting code file under an appropriate name 
such as Peek.Poke.Code. 

Next type in and compile the Hexstuff Intrinsic Unit. In addition to 
peek and poke, this library unit contains procedures and functions for 
converting back and forth between decimal and hexadecimal. There are 
also functions that split an integer (stored as a two-byte word) into its 
component bytes and a procedure called screen that offers a convenient 
means of sending control commands to the console driver. These proce- 
dures are of general utility and should prove useful in other programs 
you may write. The Hexstuff unit also declares a "free union variant rec- 
ord" type, which is widely useful for bit twiddling of variables stored in 
memory. When the Hexstuff unit has been compiled, use the linker to 
link in Peek.Poke.Code. The resulting code file is the library unit. 

The Hexstuff library unit should now be placed in the system library 
on the Pascal boot disk. It must be there when the main program is com- 
piled and executed. You place the unit in System. Library by using the 
Pascal utility program Library. Follow the instructions beginning on 
page 87 of the Pascal manual, "Program Preparation Tools." 

The next step is construction of the data file Opcode.List. This file 
contains the text of each 6502 assembly code mnemonic, the number of 
bytes in each instruction, and the format of the operand field for each in- 
struction. The disassembler uses this file as a look-up table to convert 
from the raw object code to readable assembly language text. The file 
really contains a lot of data. There are several ways this information 
might be put together and made available to the disassembler. The meth- 
od used is selected to have the fastest possible speed of execution and the 
least possible amount of typing. 

The Essential Op-Codes. Much of the required text information al- 
ready exists in the Pascal system file Opcodes. 6502, which may be found 
on one of the Pascal language disks. The Pascal assembler uses the infor- 
mation in this file to go "the other way," from assembly language source 
code to machine language object code. The program Make Opcode.List, 
a separate utility program, uses Opcodes. 6502 and other information to 
create the necessary data file, which it stores on disk under the file name 
Opcode.List. When you have typed in and compiled Make Opcode.List 
be sure that the file Opcodes.6502 is available. You can do this in one of 
two ways. Either change the source in the sixth line to the full path name 
where Opcodes.6502 is located or transfer that file onto your program 
disk. In the latter case be sure to set the Prefix to the program disk so 
Pascal can find the right file. Then run Make Opcode.List. The program 
takes thirty to forty seconds to execute, which seems endless since noth- 
ing is happening on the screen. But you only need to run it once. You 
now have the Opcode.List data file on your disk and you can transfer it 
to other disks as needed. Y ou'U never need Make Opcode.List again. It's 
a one-shot deal. 

If you're curious to know what the information in Opcode.List looks 
like, you can compile and execute Print Opcode.List. This utility pro- 
gram prints the data in a neat array on the console or Silentype or just 
about anywhere you desire. The program is supplied solely for that pur- 
pose and is not required or involved in construction of the disassembler. 

Finally, we are ready for the disassembler itself Type in the program 
and compile it. Note that the compile-time variable disk in hne six is 
false. This will compile the Memory version. Save the code file under the 

If you have questions about the program, please do not tele- 
phone. We are not experienced enough with the III to help you on

name M.Disasm.Code. Now get the text back up in the editor. Change 
only the assignment in the sixth line making disk : = true. Then compile it 
again. This time you get the disk file version, which should be saved un- 
der a different file name, D.Disasm.Code. 

All that remains is to be sure that the data file Opcode.List is avail- 
able when either of the disassembler code files is executed. It should be 
on the Prefix disk so Pascal will know where to find it. The disassembler 
loads Opcode.List in about one second during program initialization. If 
necessary, that disk may then be removed. You may, for instance, need 
the device for another disk containing a file you wish to disassemble. 

Don't forget about the user-defined procedure. As listed here it is 
empty, but it will accommodate all sorts of other programs including 
graphics applications, search roufines, and even the interface for assem- 
bly language modules linked to the system. There is plenty of room left in 
memory for almost any length procedure you might care to write.

CAN I CHOOSE HOW WIDE I WANT 
EACH COLUMN TO BE PRINTED? 

YES. You can even choose if you want 
certain columns shortened from the left 
or right. 

IF I MAKE A MISTAKE IN A COLUMN 
SIZE CAN I CORRECT IT? 

YES. Version 2.2 allows for easy 
editing/saving of your custom formats for 
re-use on similar models. 

IF I CHANGE THE WIDTH OF 
COLUMNS WON'T THAT ALTER 
REPORT HEADINGS THAT SPAN 
ACROSS THOSE COLUMNS? 

It would, but you have the option of insert- 
ing multi-line report headings which will 
be automatically centered to your report. 

HOW MUCH VISICALC MEMORY IS 
USED? 

NONE. It works on Visicalc's files while 
Visicalc is turned off. 

ANY COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS 
WITH EXPANSION BOARDS OR 
OTHER VISICALC ACCESSORY

NO. Nor do we foresee any problems with 
future products. 

I HAVE AN EARLIER VERSION

Inr the- Apple owner's dollars. W ith the introduction of the Z8(i 
card, chniees liet e\en liarder concerning what to purchase: 
Iherehire, we dedicate this book to you, the con-samer. We hope 
yoii w ill use it for a tiuidc and us a refereiKt' fo assist you in mak- 
inti intelliiicnt and infornied decisions when purchasing software. 

(;urreiitl\. the Apple Computer owner i.*; pre.sented with a 
hewiUlering selection of software from which to choose. On the 
one hand, this should pJea.se you in that, as the owner of probably 
the most popular [uicro^-eomputer in the world, you have a wide 
and rapidly grow inti selection of softv. are from which ia choose. 
On the other hand, this wide and growing .selection presents some 
problems. The \ ast majority f>f retail computer store staff people 
simi>lv just do not have the time to ade(|uately review each new 
piece of software that eome.'; in their store. The problem Is com- 
pounded if the new prt^am is an extensive or complicated one, 
such as an accounting package or a word proce.ssing system, or a 
comprehensive data ba.se management program. This docs not 
mean that store personnel do not want to give you the best st*rvice 
possible; it's just that it is an almost impossible task. If you pur- 
chase software through the mail, the risks that you assume, 
without a reliable i^uide to a.ssi.st you should be apparent. 

Other pitfalls aw ait the nhinforrned buyer. For instance, in too 
man>- cases \ ou cannot by the apfx-arance of the package whether 
the program re(piires Integer Basic or Applesoft Basic or whether 
it needs 16, 32 or 48K of RAM. It is also often difficult to teil 
when you purchase a program on tape whether it can be trans- 
ferred to disk or, if a disk program is purcha.sed, whether it can 
be coi)ied or not. 

Another area that can present problems to the buyer Is the 
similarity of software. A well-stocked computer store may 
possibly offer five different word proces.sing packages, four 
assemblers, ten different adventure type games and/or several 
mail list programs, (the choices seem endles.s); all of which have 
ol>vious ad\ antages and disadvantages as well as different prices. 

The goal of "The Book" is to eliminate as many of these poten- 
tial problem areas for the software buyer as possible. 

\A e w elcome any comments or criticisms from readers that will 
help IIS in reaching this goal.

INTERNATIONAL 
BUSINESS: 




W)PTAI V 



SEPTEMBER 1982 



Two employees with a small, California-based multinational hooked 
up an Apple in their home office and one each in their French and Brit- 
ish branches. Linked via modem to a relay-switching satellite, the com- 
puters successfully transmit and download data back and forth between 
the two continents. It formerly took similar information six to eight 
weeks each way to reach its proper destination. Now it's there in 
minutes. 

An international micro-to-micro transmission like this had never 
been tried before. In fact, the company's computer experts swore it 
couldn't be done. 

The same two men also connected an Apple to an IBM mainframe 
for downloading information. The loose-tongued IBM is unaware that it 
is chatting with a lowly Apple. 

The same experts theorized how this might be done — the cost would 
be about five thousand dollars in time and equipment. It actually took 
only a few hours to do and cost no more than a six-pack of beer. 

All this goes to show that if something can't be done or the cost is too 
high, these days you have two choices: you can either do without or go 
ahead and do it yourself. 

It's not a comfortable feehng always to be caught in between such 
choices. We're progressing in fits and starts; sometimes it seems hopeless 
and sometimes too good to be true. Modern technology has dragged us 
to the junction of risk and promise, and the world is being wracked by 
hesitation. 

In One Age, out the Other. We are once again crossing from one 
great economic age into another; this time from the industrial to the in- 
formational. We are the generations that know firsthand how things 
used to be as well as how things will be. As to how things are right now — 
well, everything's changing. 

"There is a certain relief in change, even though it is from bad to 
worse. ... It is often a comfort to shift one's position and be bruised in a 



new place," wrote novelist Washington Irving on traveling by stage- 
coach. America is traveling a different hard road today, an economic 
one, but the bruising is still the same. 

Research shows that half of America's work force was in the infor- 
mation and education business in 1976, according to The Futurist maga- 
zine. By the year 2000, this will be more like a sixty-forty spUt, with the 
odds-on favorite being information and education, and the rest being 
manufacturing and other employment. 

A systems revolution is upon us. 

The last time a similar revolution was noted to be underway was in 
1 880, when half of America's work force was in agriculture and the ex- 
tractive business and half was in manufacturing and commerce. The in- 
dustrial revolution was reshaping the nation. It peaked at its halfway 
point in 1920 when the shift in major resources went from energy to in- 
formation. By the time World War II rolled around, the situation had ex- 
ploded. New technologies were developing faster than anybody could 
implement them. 

The door to the computer communications age was quietly opened in 




1 940, according to Datamation magazine. A modified Teletype 26 key- 
board in New Hampshire was used to transmit data in a test over regu- 
lar phone lines to a relay calculator in New York. The calculator proc- 
essed the data and returned its response to New Hampshire, a neat trick 
at the time. It took twenty years for the computer to catch up to its 
own potential. 

Information Slicks. In 1962 the Rand Corporation, America's think 
tank, proposed an all-digital, computer-controlled defense system that 
moved computering from traditional time sharing to the concept of net- 
working in a big way. What pipelines are to the world's oil flow, net- 
works are to global information access. 

This radical rethinking by Rand launched a battle of communica- 
tions network satellites that has been raging now for twenty years. 

Networks like Telenet, Tymnet, Datapac, General Electric's Quick- 
Com, and Saponet are all in operation today, but there are no system 
standards, the technology remains underdeveloped, and at best they of- 
fer partial solutions to a chronic worldwide problem. 

It's a problem that's constantly plaguing America's multinational 
corporations. The daily international flow of information is the vital link 
between the home office and those in the field. It's no wonder a corpora- 
tion like Allergan, a division of SmithKline-Beckman, decided to take a 
couple of Apples and create a network of their own. 

Allergan is a small multinational compared to most, but its people 
are very progressive. The company began in Los Angeles when Gavin S. 
Herbert opened up shop in a room above his drugstore in 1948. Com- 
puters at the time were vacuum-tubed affairs, the transistor had just been 
invented, and operating systems were still five years away. 

House Full of Kids. In 1967 the company moved to their present na- 
tional headquarters in Irvine, California. Today they marshal more than 
sixty-eight subsidiaries, with offices and manufacturing plants world- 
wide, including Australia, Germany, Japan, Brazil, France, Italy, Mexi- 
co, and Great Britain. 

Allergan develops, manufactures, and markets products in two spe-

cialized areas — eye care and skin care. They produce prescription drugs 
to treat various eye disorders and nonprescription preparations to treat 
less severe conditions. Hard and soft contact lens users will be most fa- 
miliar with their lens-care packages. The skin-care division produces both 
prescription and nonprescription products that treat various dermato- 
logical problems. They also make a line of sun screens. 

Formerly more of a development company, AUergan was able to be- 
come an industry leader by acquiring compounds from other compa- 
nies. Now they are committed to doing more of their own research and 
development, with access to some of the foremost pharmaceutical re- 
search findings and facilities under their merger with SmithKline. 

Allergan is proud of their manufacturing capabilities — operators in 
their product-filhng rooms wear masks and gowns, working under asep- 
tic conditions that rival hospital operating rooms. 

Their employee policies are considerably enlightened, also. Their 
complex in Irvine includes tennis courts and a baseball diamond. They 
have a van-pooling program that allows seven employees to travel to and 
from work in a company van with the gas paid for by Allergan.

crudal; one can't exist without the other. The visionary-hacker interplay 
between these two "home-brewed, backyard hobbyists," as they have 
been called, seems to be what has made their "hobbying" so successful. 

The Way They Were. To see just how revolutionary the actual ap- 
plication of an Apple system network is, it helps to have an idea of how 
communications traditionally have been conducted between a multina- 
tional's home office and an international office in a foreign country. 

The basic problem with an international division is that it's located 
miles away from home. Sometimes it's just a small office when it's not 
connected to a manufacturing plant. The Allergan office in Great Brit- 
ain is located in the top half of a converted Victorian mansion. 

The company back home wants to know how things are selling and 
developing in the overseas market. They also want numbers. The flow of 
information is a major problem. Global data transmission is a jungle of 
competing systems and international regulations. 

Casparie explains how overseas information has been handled at Al- 
lergan in the recent past, mostly by regular mail. 

"Regular mail takes anywhere from ten to fourteen days from Eu- 




The company maintains an "open-door policy" to encourage the free 
flow of ideas and opinions within the corporation. It's easy to see how 
two employees could pitch the corporate heads at Allergan an Apple net- 
work idea and have them bite. The two employees that wound up spear- 
heading the network operation were Jim Casparie and Jerry Pickering. 

View from the First Floor. Casparie's and Pickering's offices are on 
the first floor in the huge brick Allergan complex. It's called the interna- 
tional floor; the people who work there must be fluent in two languages 
in addition to English. The offices are neat and spacious, and blow-ups 
of Allergan ads in foreign languages are prominent. There are plaques by 
the elevators that tell which country's flags are flying in front of the 
building on any given day, a salute to visiting field executives. 

Casparie is a marketing products manager, specializing in new prod- 
ucts. He met his Apple in 1980, using it for some personal hacking and 
consulting work between stints at Allergan. A native Califomian, he 
holds a master's degree in business and does career counseling at the 
University of California, Irvine. 

Pickering is a market research analyst with a degree in biochemistry. 
He also has an Apple at home and has done some consulting work with 
it. And he happens to be a registered nurse who spent two years in the 
army as a Green Beret. 

The two men make quite a professional, good-natured set of players. 
They share tons of enthusiasm for the potential of the Apple. They de- 
light in its ability to dazzle the big boys continually with amazing new ap- 
plications. They are a classic pair of Apple flyers. 

There is an unwritten law in the world of computer team-ups that de- 
crees that one partner be the visionary and the other be the hacker. If the 
visionary sees that Apples might fly, the hacker goes about finding a way 
to make them airborne. 

While it appears in reality that Pickering and Casparie have about 
equal amounts of both, Casparie seems to lean toward the visionary role; 
he specializes in fighting flak and red tape. Pickering seems to favor the 
hacker role; he does the trouble-shooting and debugging. Both parts are

rope. So the home office doesn't get to see or react to anything until two 
weeks after the fact. After the information goes through the finance de- 
partment (which takes from two to five days), is keypunched (one to sev- 
en days), then run through the IBM mainframe (one to seven days), the 
information finally gets to marketing — about four to six weeks after it 
was sent. The international division finds out if they did anything wrong 
four to six weeks after that. 

"This is the standard procedure with most American multination- 
als — gossip travels faster. 

"We might even be talking about something as simple as a one-line 
label change on a bottle of suntan lotion in Germany." 

Faster than a Speeding Bullet. Most companies can easily be sev- 
eral months behind in decisions based on this flow of information. The 
Apple system at Allergan is demolishing this informational jet lag. 

"We have taken a quantum leap from the Dark Ages with this sys- 
tem," says Pickering. 

He ran down some cost comparisons between existing international 
networks. "To send a five-page transmission, fifty-six lines per page, 
eighty characters each, would cost $112 if sent by telex at the 50-baud 
rate from here to Great Britain and take eight to ten hours. To send it on 
the Texas Instruments' TRT network would cost $17.80. To send it on 
an ITT lease line at 300 baud, with a batch of other messages, would cost 
$13.30 and also take eight to ten hours. On an ITT dedicated line sent at 
1,200 baud it would cost $3.32. 

"To send it on the G.E. system that we're using with the Apples costs 
only $1 .24 and it's instantaneous." And it is done with the ease and con- 
venience of making a local phone call. 

While all this sounds amazingly simple and even a little bit inevit- 
able, resistance to the project came in several different forms. Casparie 
and Pickering had to contend with interdepartmental priorities, interna- 
tional law, and hardware-software shortcomings. They were assigned the 



98 ^ 

task on a part-time basis, but they soon found they were working ridicu- 
lous hours and sometimes had to put their bread-and-butter jobs on the 
back burner. 

The go-ahead for the project was given in June 1981. Allergan got a 
new director of marketing, John Stewart, who was pro-Apple. It was 
Casparie and Stewart who initially hashed out the financing of the sys- 
tem. Their job also included convincing the president of the internation- 
al division, James Cavanaugh, that the Apple had what Allergan 
needed. 

About this time, the data processing department at Allergan took an 
interest in the Apple project. Data processing departments are where the 
mainframe honchos are ensconced. These are the experts with the de- 
grees in computer science and decades of experience. Anything with a 
chip in it is considered their turf. They were concerned that the Apple 
system would interfere with their eighteen months of work in Italy try- 
ing to get an IBM/ICL System 10 to work as smoothly as it did in Aller- 
gan's Canadian office. 

An Electronic Hammer. "We proposed the Apple along the lines of 
a management tool. We showed them how it wouldn't be in competition 
with their larger project. We were shooting for a small system on the lo- 
cal level, for the little guys out in the sticks," says Casparie. Still, it took 
them three months to get data processing's approval. 

"They couldn't believe the Apple was good for anything more than 
playing games," Casparie explains. 

"They said we were crazy, that it couldn't be done," a phrase Caspar- 
ie and Pickering were to hear endlessly at every corner they turned. It 
only served to fuel their enthusiasm even more. 

Pickering, with a broad background in Apples, was brought on as a 
consultant after all the project's approvals had been acquired. The se- 
rious technical research was begun. 

The Apple was always the favored choice of micro for the system. 
"You can walk in anywhere in the world and buy one," says Pickering. 
He had checked out the competition. 

"We looked at the Commodore, the TRS, the IBM pc, the Osborne,

you name it — even the Apple III. The Plus was the most versatile. It was 
able to handle all our hardware configuration needs. It is also serviced 
worldwide." 

Casparie mentions that the Apple Communications Card was found 
to be the only internationally flexible communications card. 

Modem compatibility in Europe became a major area of concern. It 
seems they don't reaUy have Apples there — they have European- 
manufactured Apples. Converters switch them from AC to DC, the Eu- 
ropean standard, and special cards in slot 7 connect the AC Apple to a 
DC monitor.

Casparie and Pickering's research led them to the conclusion that M&Ms are 
the most Apple-compatible candy. 

Europe; it has a worldwide distribution. But research led the Allergan in- 
vestigators to favor ASCII Express. It could almost do what they need- 
ed it to do; it would only require a few modifications. 

Later, Pickering and Casparie enlisted the help of ASCII author Bill 
Blue. He was able to create patches for them when "funny things" start- 
ed coming across the system in its initial trials. 

Road Show. In January 1982 the first Apples arrived at Irvine, and 
Pickering began to make the necessary hardware and software configu- 
rations. Casparie made travel plans. 

"I did all the startup programming in random access," says Picker- 
ing, "but it turned out we could only transmit files sequentially. So two 
days before Jim left, I was frantically reprogramming everything for se- 
quential transmission." 

Casparie left for Great Britain in April 1982. Three days later, the 
British Apple was up and running. Two weeks after that, France was 
linked up. 

"I left with a suitcase fuU of software packages and the ASCII and 
General Electric documentation," Casparie explains. "There was no time 
to look at everything, so I just took it all. There was no beta testing of 
this system; I just showed up and we rolled up our sleeves." 

The system didn't quite perform as planned with the first message 
sent. There was some data loss. Ten minutes after the initial transmis- 
sion, Pickering called Casparie about some stuck files. They were sweat- 
ing this out together; both were nervous. This was their moment of truth. 

"We were frantic," says Casparie. "The problem was the data-entry 
mode of the Quick-Com system. It took too much time to transmit and 
was overlapping. All we eventually needed to use was a 1 30-character 
straight dump mode, but that wasn't in the book. G.E.'s system was de- 
signed for straight transmission, not for downloading data files." 

Pickering recalls how that first transmission almost didn't get made. 

"Jim had taken our only copy of the G.E. book and I couldn't re- 
member my password — there are four levels of passwords to get on the 
system. I had to call their rep out here. I didn't know anything about 
their system. It was a real comedy of errors." 

One of the things they had to consider in designing the network was a 
multinational regulatory law called TBDF (transborder data flow). 



100 

Casparie explains: "The law considers data leaving a country as a lost 
resource. It must either be processed in the country or be nonvital infor- 
mation. That's why we signed on with General Electric — their Quick- 
Com network had been approved by the most countries. We had to or- 
chestrate the setup with them step by step. Nobody had ever used their 
system the way we wanted to. We were blazing a trail of our own over 
there. We turned out to be the first to make this kind of message switch- 
ing work on this scale." 

A Big Hit. When the system finally clicked, enthusiasm for Apples 
and the network snowballed throughout Allergan, especially at the man- 
agerial level. Casparie and Pickering had won over some very skeptical 
opposition. 

"The head of the British field office is an ultraconservative type, rigid 
against change and all that," Casparie relates. "He used to sit up in the 
attic and do all his figuring in longhand, using long division. When the 
Apple was put in, he didn't want to sit down with the rest of the staff and 
learn how to use it. 

"It turned out he came in alone at night and figured the thing out for 
himself," Pickering continues. "Of course, he fell in love. If the system 
took off he could keep his Apple, so he wanted to protect his invest- 
ment. He jumped on the bandwagon, started calling country managers 
all over the world. He really started stirring up the pot for us." 

The British staff was able to show off their Apple when they were 
visited recently by an area supervisor. Th^ were ordered to rebudget; the 
manager expected the calculation to take the usual two to three days. He 
would pick it up on his way back from Italy. Using VisiCalc, the British 
office was able to hand the recalculations to him at the end of the day, 
before he got on the plane. 

France was ready to go on the network before the network was even 
ready. "We were originally going to set up the system from the U.K. 
only, but it turned out our man in France had gone out and purchased 
an Apple on the q.t., so we included them too," says Casparie. 

"The head of our Australian operation is visiting here in Irvine right 



SEPTEMBER 1982 



now. He was sold on the system right off the bat. He wants to take five 
Apples back with him when he goes." 

Altogether about twelve of.Allergan's country managers want Ap- 
ples in their outposts, including Italy, where thelBM/ICL mainframers 
are still toiling away on their $100,000 system, trying to get a six-bit lan- 
guage to travel on eight-bit lines. 

Each field office on the Apple network requires about seven thou- 
sand dollars' worth of equipment to set up its end of the system. Each 
needs an Apple II Plus, a NEC or Apple III monitor, two disk drives, a 
Videx eighty-column card, a SoftCard, a Saturn 64K memory board, a 
Videx Keyboard Enhancer II, a Thunderclock, the best local printer (this 
was found to be the only equipment variable), a Quadram Miaophaser 
(for quick screen dumps), and, of course, a D.C. Hayes modem (in Eu- 
rope, nonacoustic modems must be hand wired to the phone). 

They've Just Begun. Now that the first links of the Apple network 
are in place and functioning, Casparie and Pickering already see it ex- 
panding into more than they had planned. 

"We want to start out simple, until everybody gets used to the Ap- 
ple. Right now we're using VisiCalc, PFS, and the Executive Secretary 
word processor to train people with. We hope to go up to CP/M and use 
WordStar worldwide," says Casparie. 

They eventually see graphics capabilities on the system, like trans- 
mitting advertising and labels for approval and changes. In time, they 
feel the system could handle camera-ready art; computer-generated 
images could go directly onto graphic arts film and then be printed. 

"This wall revolutionize the packaging and advertising business. 
Companies who are on the ball will have a real competitive edge," says 
Pickering.

COME TO 
THE FAIR 




Bv iin SALnoiii 

AltD DAVE FITZUtALD 

It's hot as blazes and a bit humid, as Tennessee is wont to be. Sun- 
burnt skin finds momentary relief beneath occasional maples, and a 
breeze from the sparkling lagoon wafts welcome relief to long queues of 
people. 

No one leaves the lines, despite the sun. No one even looks worn. To 
these visitors to the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee, standing 
in line is worthwhile: they're waiting for a peek at the future. 

That's what world's fairs are all about: countries and companies con- 
vening to show off what they can do and what they can almost do, 
what's just around the comer for all of us. They speak to the future and 
they celebrate the past, reveling in the can-do attitude that has brought 
humankind from leaf-nibbling foragers to Tang-sucking space walkers in 
the blink of a cosmic eye. 

Today, we measure our growth by our technological advancement; it 
is the measure of our copability in all areas of life but the arts. Just as we 
stand our children tall against the edge of a closet door to mark the 
march toward adulthood, we stack up our technology at a world's fair to 
benchmark just how far we've come since the one before. 

This time, between the last world's fair in 1975 and this one, our tech- 
nology in electronics and information advanced so fast that one entire 
genre missed its opportunity to stand in the sun. In 1975, there were no 
Apples. In 1982, they are so common, so accepted, that in their world's 
fair debut they aren't seen at all. The Knoxville World's Fair's Apples 
are workhorses, not peacocks. 

Dozens of Apples populate the areas backstage, running the exhibits 
that make this the most uniquely informative exposition since the first, 
the London World's Fair of 1851. Visitors actually use Apples, interact 



vnth Apples, through specially designed keyboards and divers screens; 
but the fancy keyboards merely transmit their input to the Apples in the 
wings, and the Apples answer for them — rather Uke Cyrano beneath the 
balcony speaking for Christian to Roxanne. 

The Apples share a purpose with all the people and products at the 
fair to enhance the meaning of the fair's theme, Energy Turns the 
World. 

Tokyo, Rome, Madrid — and Knoxville. Of all the places you might 
consider for a world's fair, Kiioxville seems an unlikely choice. Prior to 
the fair, its popular claim to fame was as that place through whkh ten 
million vacation-goers passed on their way to the Great Smoky Moun- 
tains National Park, the most visited park in the nation. Short of throw- 
ing tacks on the highway, Knoxville had been unable to lure these mo- 
bile Americans within its city limits. 

Not as often considered is that Knoxville, with its surroundings, has 
first dibs on the title of energy capital of the United States. It's the home 
of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation's largest public utility. The 
University of Tennessee, whose main campus borders the fair site, is an 
academic leader in advanced energy research for government and indus- 
try'. And nearby Oak Ridge harbors the National Atomic Laboratory, 
the world's leading nuclear research facility. 

Which Came First, the Chicken or the Egg? The answer, of course, 
is: the idea. In Knoxville's case, the idea sprang from the mind of one 
Jake Butcher. 

Knoxville's one hundred eighty thousand residents have seen their 
share of the inner-city decay that plagues most American cities; unem- 
ployment and shifting business populations have hit hard. Jack Butcher 
thought he saw a way to reverse all that. 

In a scenario that reads like a movie script, this rags-to-riches mogul 
pulled every conceivable corporate and political string to realize his vi- 
sion of a world's fair within the shadow of his United America Bank, 
Knoxville's largest — and one of five that Butcher owns. He and his co- 
horts believed the fair would provide the impetus and the financial op-

portunity to redevelop Knoxville's ailing central business district in one 
feU swoop. 

Ordinarily, today's world's fairs are financed by local municipal 
bond issues or other public funds. Not so in Knoxville. With his friends, 
Jake Butcher negotiated a thirty-million-dollar line of credit from a con- 
sortium of forty-three banks. The 1982 World's Fair is the first such ex- 
position funded totally by private-sector investment. 

The Way It Was. At first, world's fairs were mammoth spectacles. 
Designated as universal expositions, fairs were held in internationally sig- 
nificant cities such as London, New York, and Paris. With each partici- 

The Sunsphere (far left), theme structure of the fair, dominates the view of the 
site across the Waters of the World. The U.S. pavilion, The Energy Place 
(left), is the fair's largest national exhibit and a showcase of Apple-controlled 
videodisc displays. The Debate Wall (below), twenty video monitors

pating country funding and constructing its own pavilion, the evait at- 
tempted to showcase the total spectrum of human accomplishment. 

As the world became more diverse and complex, and just plain big- 
ger, mounting the world's fair extravaganzas became impossibly costly 
and unwieldy. The traditional metropolises balked at the prospect of try- 
ing to outdo Busby Berkeley but didn't want to undershine the previous 
host. World's fairs were in danger of extinction. 

Yet the benefits of the fairs to the cities that hosted them couldn't be 
denied. Smaller cities, needing the stimulation of economic activity the 
fairs inevitably caused, couldn't afford the traditional fairs, but they also 
didn't feel the need to compete with previous events. They lobbied for 
smaller, focused world's fairs. 

So the Bureau of International Expositions sanctioned a second cat- 
egory of world's fair, the specialized fair, a global event focusing on a 
particular aspect of human endeavor. 

In a unique partnership, local developers front construction funds 
and lease space to participants who share pavilions. Jobs are created, 
many of which last after a fair is over, and the new or revitalized build- 
ings are put to use in reenergizing the local economy. Like the extrava- 
ganzas of yesterday, a specialized world's fair can turn a city around. 

Childhood's End. The Knoxville World's Fair highlights world 
achievements in energy. Diverse potential solutions to the world's ener- 



gy problems abound in the pavilions. 

Displays stress conservation and efficient use of energy. Demonstra- 
tions of fuel-efficient cars, energy-efficient buildings, and labor-saving 
but low-energy appliances offer glimpses of a more energy-conscious fu- 
ture. And the renovation of a Victorian house on the fair site shows that 
we can tackle the problem without rebuilding our cities. 

More exciting are the displays of new technologies exploring differ- 
ent sources of energy. Windmills and solar collectors abound on the fair- 
grounds. Seeing one beside the other is like seeing the old world juxta- 
posed against the new; actually, both are part of the future. Indoor ex- 
hibits attest to the monumental effort industry is putting into developing 
methods of recovering and using uranium, deuterium, coal, and oil shale. 

Many exhibits at the World's Fair use Apples, but three of the larg- 
est pavilions use them in such quantity and so integrally that they merit 
closer looks. Follow now as we visit the United States pavilion, the pa- 
vilion of the America's Electric Energy Exhibit, and the Tennessee Val- 
ley Authority exhibit. 

The United States pavilion, The Energy Place, is the centerpiece of 
the 1982 World's Fair. The six cantilevered stories of the U.S. pavilion 
extend majestically over an edge of the three-acre Waters of the World, a 
beautiful reflecting pool created especially for the fair. Open-air bal- 
conies overlooking the lake give pavilion visitors a breathtaking view of 
the Sunsphere, the 266-foot theme structure of the fair. On the opposite 
side of the building, an I MAX theater presents the film Energy, Energy 
on a screen ninety feet wide and seven stories tall — the largest in the 
world. 

The Energy Place practices what it preaches: energy conservation and 
innovation. A network of computer-controlled sensors constantly moni- 
tors and adjusts the climate within the pavilion. This super-intelligent 
thermostat will even open the windows if the system determines that out- 
side air is the most effective way to keep the building within environ- 
mental standards. State-of-the-art insulation techniques and a 4,1 00- 
square-foot solar collector contribute to the building's energy efficiency. 

Escalators shuttle crowds to the top of the pavilion. Here, they begin 
a gradual descent down broad ramps through a series of displays that un- 
fold America's energy past, present, and future. Throughout the de- 
scent, visitors are afforded an unobstructed view of the entire pavilion 
from the railing-lined ramps and broad landings. Even the cavernous 
open space in the center of the pavilion is filled with energy-related items 
suspended from the ceiling by wire. 

The firm of Ramirez and Woods, eighteen-year veterans of exhibit 
design, brought together numerous historical artifacts, from Jefferso- 
nian bedwarmers to the first solar-powered airplane, to give concrete 
examples of the evolution of our diversified uses of energy. Artistic ex- 
pressions are also included to convey the elusive concepts relating to 
energy. 

The Energy Time Curve presents a three-dimensional view of our in- 
creasing demand for energy and our varied sources of it. Beginning with 
a six foot tall pedestal representing the use of steam and animal power in 
1 800, a succession of pedestals grows to more than twenty-seven feet, the 
tallest representing energy demands in 1980. This towering demand is 
now being met by a variety of sources, including nuclear and solar pow- 
er. A second artistic exhibit, Energy. The Neon Way, provides a similar 
dramatic graphic representation of energy supply and demand. 

While these historic and artistic displays are informative, they are 
static. But Ramirez and Woods didn't stop here and have incorporated 
interactive displays that advance the state of the art in exhibit design. 

Grown To Loan. Steve Gregory, cofounder of the New England 
Technology Group (NETG) and professor of computer graphics at 
MIT, began consulting with Ramirez and Woods in January 1981 . Their 
collective effort was intended to break new ground in the application of 
computer and interactive videodisc technology within exhibit design. 
Buttressed by the loan from Apple Computer of fifty computers, the 
U.S. pavilion is a resounding statement of the success of the collabora- 
tion between NETG and the exhibit design firm. 

"When we learned of the Apple computer loan, we were truly ex- 
cited," Steve Gregory recalls. "Having been in business for a while, we 
had occasion to work with the Apple for some of our clients. We found it 
to be a very flexible, capable, and reliable machine."

In fact, the pavilion demonstrates an evolving sophistication in 
NETG's application of Apple computers within interactive information 
retrieval and presentation. 

The most basic interactive display is a high-tech version of the "push- 
a-button, get-a-message" exhibit technique. The topic of the exhibit is 
"embodied energy," the energy it takes to produce a product rather than 
what it takes to use it. 

Backlit photographs of sixteen everyday products invite visitors to 
examine more closely the embodied energy used to produce each item. 
By touching the picture of a product, a visitor calls up a brief audio- 
visual presentation that explains how that item is made and the surpris- 
ing ways in which energy is essential to the process. 

An Apple computer controls access of specific segments of a laser 




videodisc. By issuing the videodisc a start and stop frame number, the 
Apple directs the rapid access of stored information much as it would 
with a standard disk drive. The difference is that the information is in- 
terpreted and presented by the videodisc player as an audio-visual mes- 
sage rather than being fed into the computer for traditional number- 
crunching. While the results are dramatic, the videodisc is actually noth- 
ing more than a sophisticated data storage and retrieval peripheral for 
the computer. 

A more innovative apphcation of the Apple is the use of touch-sensi- 
tive screens. These devices provide the ultimate in user transparency. The 
user's attention is not divided between viewing and keyboard operation. 
Instead, with a simple touch of a finger, the viewer controls the presenta- 
tion much like a wizard would cast a spell with the wave of a hand. 

The magical touch screen is a product of Biographies of Oak Ridge, 
Tennessee. This high-resolution screen, providing a four thousand-by- 
four thousand point grid, consists of a glass sheet coated with a trans- 
parent resistive substrate. The substrate is separated from a plastic cover 
sheet by tiny plastic beads. This cover sheet is sprayed with a transparent 
conductive coating of gold. 

A Touch of Glass. When the two layers are pressed together by a 
touch, an electric circuit is completed. A variable resistance calculation 
generates a unique (X,Y) coordinate. The Apple can as easily interpret 
this position coordinate as a key-tap signal from a traditional keyboard. 

The Energy Glossary stations are a step up the ladder of sophistica- 
tion in application of the touch screen-computer-videodisc configura- 
tion. For those visitors unfamiliar with the new terminology, a number 
of stations provide access to a Buck Rogers dictionary of five hundred 
energy terms used in the pavilion's exhibits. 

The viewer steps up to a monitor and touches a small horizontal scale 
at the bottom of the screen to access the dictionary. Where the scale is 
touched determines the direction and rate of speed at which the terms are 
scanned in the alphabetical master list. Moving forward through the list, 
a term materializes in a queue in the background of the screen. As each 
term's turn to be accessed approaches, it zooms into the foreground. 
Touching a term as it zooms past retrieves its definition. 

Definitions are presented in a variety of formats. The screen may 
simply fill with a concise definition in easy-to-read text, highlighted 
words indicating which words within the definition may be touched to 



access additional terms in a nested search. In other cases, a computer- 
generated graphic or still frame from a videodisc may be superimposed 
with text enhancement. More than one hundred different terms access 
short, explanatory video s^ments. In all cases, an Apple II Plus is con- 
trolling die system. 

The Energy Data Center allows visitors to consolidate and investi- 
gate their special interests in energy. Six personal-sized monitors with 
touch-screen controls allow individuals to interact with the system. Six 
seventy-two inch projection television sets act as slave monitors for each 
of the stations, allowing easy observation by nearby visitors. 

Unlike the glossary exhibit, the Energy Data Center deals ahnost ex- 
clusively in dynamic video and computer-generated graphic images. 
Rather than simply searching from a master list, the Energy Data sta- 



tions utilize sophisticated branching within an ongoing retrieval of 
information. 

For example, a monitor might show a speeding train rolling out of 
West Virginia. When a viewer touches a coal-laden car, the image freezes 
while computer-generated graphic information is superimposed. A band 
of images indicating related coal topics lets the viewer's fingers do the 
walking through a vast storehouse of information related to coal. 

As sophisticated as these various Apple-controlled exhibits are, 
NETG's crowning achievement at the U.S. paviHon is the Debate Wall. 
This exhibit demonstrates a mixture of old and new information presen- 
tation techniques. In presenting a diverse set of taped expert opinions on 
various energy-related issues, the exhibit uses multi-image audio-visual 
display. The new technological twist that has been added is audience 
control of when or even if a speaker's opinion will be heard. 

Meeting of the Micro Minds. A wall covered with twenty video 
monitors faces the seated and standing audience. A series of sound ef- 
fects, short comments, and visual images introduces the Debate Wall. 
Then one of thirty energy experts makes a leading statement, while his or 
her image is shown on fifteen of the twenty monitors. The debate has 
begun. 

While this initial comment is playing, the remaining five touch-screen 
equipped monitors display still images of possible follow-up speakers. 
Each of the five pictures is superimposed with an invitation to touch the 
screen to hear the pictured speaker respond. With each new comment, 
five additional carry-on choices are presented. Remarkably, the Apple- 
controlled videodiscs have enough opinion segments stored to take the 
discussion in literally hundreds of directions. 

Revealing the challenge involved in execution of this exhibit, Steve 
Gregory explains, "The most difficult exhibit from a hardware integra- 
tion standpoint was the Debate Wall. It features three Apples controlling 
ten videodisc machines, with each player capable of sending picture and 
audio into one of the twenty monitors. 

"Two of the Apples are what we call slaves," Gregory continues. 
"Each of the slaves is responsible for controlling five of the videodisc 
players. These slaves act under cues from the master computer." 

The master Apple also sends signals to a custom-designed switcher 
that channels all video output throughout the monitor network. The 
master also detects presses on the touch screens, which indicate the fol-

lowing speaker and statement to be retrieved from the videodisc

"The exciting thing about all the efforts that went into the World's 
Fair project," Gregory concludes, "is that we were able to extend our 
knowledge in the application of microcomputers to videodisc control 
and sophisticated graphics generation. New England Technology Crroup 
now has a full range of salable Apple-based laser-disc and enhanced 
graphics products and services." 

Such private-sector benefits are the just desserts of a job well done. In 
all probability, NETG and all those who contributed to the realization of 
the U.S. pavilion have given us the most uniquely informative and enter- 
taining exhibit in the entire history of the World's Fair. And Apples 
played a big part. 

Keys of the Kingdom. At 15,000 square feet, America's Electric 
Energy Exhibit is the largest corporate pavilion in the 1982 World's Fair. 
The $2.5 million twin-domed structure includes an AEEE exhibit, gener- 
al exhibition space for other participants, and a multimedia theater. 

The theme of the AEEE exhibit is: Electric Energy — Key to a Better 
Future. Some of the exhibits focus on ways that utility companies are 
working to meet the need for increased amounts of energy through both 
conservation and new and improved technology. Additional exhibits il- 
lustrate the contributions made by various energy sources and the cen- 
tral roles of coal and nuclear energy in meeting electrical demand. 



applied state-of-the-art microcomputer and videodisc technology to the 
AEEE project. 

"In each of the five interactive stations, the configuration is as fol- 
lows," Lowe explains, unravehng the mystery of the featureless white 
boxes that stand near each station. "Inside each box is a stock Apple II 
Plus, equipped with 48K RAM, one disk drive, and an Allen Communi- 
cations VMI card that controls a 7820-3 videodisc player." The key- 
boards are Lowe's custom design "which appears to the Apple as an RS- 
232 serial terminal communicating at 1,200 baud through a port in the 
VMI card. 

"It's a very straightforward set-up, really," says Lowe. "Basically off- 
the-shelf technology with the exception of the keyboard and a PROM I 
wrote to interpret the input from the keyboard to the Apple." The Ap- 
ple graphics are provided by Synergistic Software's Higher Text 
package. 

AEEE had a clear notion of the message it wanted to convey but was 
concerned that a comprehensive tutorial exhibit would disrupt the flow 
of visitors through its pavilion. Not wanting the Apple to function sim- 
ply as an on-off button for the sequential presentation of video seg- 
ments, Lowe turned to video game aesthetics to provide player and spec- 
tator interest. 

The Taste of Learning. When he learned that North American Phil- 
lips was going to have an Odyssey video game display at the pavilion, he 






Left One of two floating barges converted by the Tennessee Valley Authority to house its Apple-using 
exhibit, The Valley Adventure. Center: Main floor of a TVA barge exhibit. Behind the wall of displays, 
under the air outlet in the upper right, is housed the Apple computer control room that powers the Load 
Control Center. Right: Jay James, TVA manager of special projects, designed the barge exhibit. In 
addition, James did the actual programming of the Load Control Center simulation. 



Upon entering the vaulted cavern of the AEEE dome, visitors im- 
mediately find their attention drawn to a giant video screen suspended 
from the ceiling. The subject of this overhead station, one of four, is coal. 
The other stations spotlight nuclear energy, conservation, and supple- 
mental energy technologies. Just in front of each suspended screen, an 
angled tube juts out from the floor. Each tube is capped by a colorful, 
flat, touch-sensitive keyboard that controls the corresponding overhead 
display. 

The four stations encircle an exhibit highlighting the Clinch River 
Breeder Reactor, and a fifth keyboard, similar to the other four, con- 
trols the display of an eye-level monitor in the breeder reactor exhibit. 

Throughout the day, visitors position themselves at the keyboards 
and gaze at the monitors overhead. They are responding to the chal- 
lenge of answering a series of energy-related questions. With each an- 
swer a visitor gives, the computer-generated text display disappears and 
is replaced by a short audio-visual presentation (film or videotape) that 
clarifies and supplements the answer. 

In the course of the quiz, the display moves quickly and smoothly 
from computer text to video segment and back again. To those unfa- 
miliar with microcomputer capabilities, this is just another magical ex- 
hibit — no explanation needed; it simply works. But to anyone who 
knows about microcomputers, it's apparent that something exciting is 
going on. 

Boxing with Apples. Larry Lowe, a flight instructor, Apple enthusi- 
ast, and computer programmer, is the person who can best explain 
what's happening here. At the request of Roger Tierney, the exhibit de- 
sign and production expert in charge of devising the AEEE exhibit, Lowe 



knew it meant stiff competition for instructional quizzes that take on the 
average of eight minutes to complete. Three aspects of video gaming — 
scoring, the recording and display of high scores, and a character that 
eats the words of an incorrect answer — were incorporated into the quiz 
in order to give it more of a video game flavor. 

According to AEEE exhibit manager R. A. Evans, 'The reaction of 
visitors to the pavihon has been great! Quite frankly," confides Evans, 
who has only recently retired from a long career with the Department of 
Energy in Oak Ridge, "it amazes me because this energy stuff is old hat 
to me. But we get folks here from the Midwest and the North and they 
think this is the greatest thing since chocolate cake." 

As Evans sees it, people's enthusiastic responses to the exhibits can 
largely be attributed to the quality of the exhibits designed by Roger 
Tierney and his associates and the Apple Computer-run exhibits devel- 
oped by Lowe and Tierney. 

Judging from the volume of visitors taking the interactive quizzes 
daily, the AEEE exhibit certainly does grab and hold people's attention. 
Even so, Larry Lowe believes he has just begun to realize the potential of 
the computer in exhibit presentations. He's already looking ahead to 
1984 — in New Orleans. 

Valley Apples, For Sure! Moored on the edge of Fort Loudon Lake 
at the south end of the fair site, two converted river barges are home to 
The Valley Adventure, a fiftieth anniversary celebration of the Tennes- 
see Valley Authority. A significant part of FDR's master redevelopment 
plan for recovery from the Great Depression, TVA continues its part- 
nership with the region's people in managing and improving the Tennes- 
see Valley's resources in preparation for future energy needs.

Huge is a word that aptly describes the work of the TV A — and this is 
graphically communicated in the large exhibit by real pieces of equip- 
ment borrowed from the utility's hydroelectric and related facilities. Jay 
James of the TVA Information Office explains: 

"Management came up with the idea of using a couple of barges 
from our existing river fleet as the foundations for our World's Fair ex- 
hibit. The TVA is the United States's largest public utility involved in soil 
conservation, flood control, and energy production as well as economic 
and industrial development. This exhibit was a huge challenge." 

As manager of special projects, James was charged with devdoping 
the informational form and content of the two barges. Much of the con- 
tent in The Valley Adventure is conveyed via effective traditional media. 
Life-size sculptures of post-Depression unemployed wait in line to be in- 
terviewed for precious TVA jobs made available during the thirties. 
Audio speakers resound with historical radio broadcasts of the forties. 
Videodisc replays of relevant television news programs remind visitors of 
the increasing energy consciousness that has pervaded the last thirty years. 

"When it came to the computers," James begins, "I wanted to try to 
communicate a few of the things we have the most trouble explaining by 
traditional means. 

"People have great difficulty understanding the job we face in eco- 
nomically matching supply and demand. They need to understand that 
the costs of such resources as coal, oil, uranium, water, and gas vary rel- 
ative to each other and that the same amount of power can cost more or 
less depending on the mix of resources used to produce it. At the same 
time, they need to understand the impact of variable consumer demand, 
concepts we call baseload and peakload." 

To explain these concepts, James picked the brains of TVA power 
system operators. They analyzed the demand curve for the hottest day in 
August of last year, a day when the midday peakload could barely be 
met with all available power sources. They took the nameplate ratings of 
all components in the power system. With the help of TVA mainframe 
computer experts, James developed a simulation model that TVA op- 



The result of this effort is the Load Control Center exhibit, a princi- 
pal attraction at The Valley Adventure. Entering the chrome and multi- 
colored semicircle, the visitor is treated to an environment reminiscent of 
the bridge in Star Trek. What one might mistake for the viewscreen of 
the Enterprise is actually a large projection television that runs a two 
minute overview of the cost of energy sources and general instructions on 
how to play the Load Control game. 

On either side of the projection television are two player stations. At 
each station, a color monitor is recessed in a slanted panel above a ledge 
where four knob-topped levers protrude. Each lever is labeled either Hy- 
dro, Nuclear, Coal, or Gas Turbine. An extensive cable network runs 
from the Load Control Center beneath deck to the hidden computer 
room where lines tie the levers to the game I /O ports and the monitors to 
the video-out lines of four Apple II Plus computers. 

Poking the Peak Load. As the big-screen instructions are playing, 
the four stations present colorful graphics depicting each of the four 
power sources. Each player then gets a practice run on the system and 
the graphic pictures are replaced by a colorful bar-graph plot. 

At the top of the display, a bar creeps left to right reaching peakload, 
then recedes representing customer demand. The combined output of 
each of the four levers is depicted by a horizontal bar representing sup- 
ply which is displayed just below demand. Broad vertical bars climb up 
and down the screen as the player adjusts the power-supply levers. The 
use of hydroelectric power starts a blue vertical bar creeping downward; 
this represents the falling water level in the lakes as the dams are opened. 

At the conclusion of the practice run, players are given advice on how 
to run the system better. The screen is cleared and replotted with a mes- 
sage to get ready for a scored run. A full day's demand curve is com- 
pressed into a run that takes a little over a minute. The player anxiously 
manipulates the levers in an attempt to produce the most effective mix of 
energy resources to meet demand. 

The computer pauses while calculating at the end of the scored run. 
The player is then informed what the average customer's bill would be 





Left Levers in hand, visitors to the TVA Load Control Center attempt to minimize customer utility bills by 
manipulating the various sources of energy to meet electric demand. Center: Testing her energy I.Q., a

erators ran numerous times to determine accurate averages of how they 
ran the system best in real life. 

The Charge of the Light Bill. These simulations confirmed that opti- 
mal operation of the system matched TVA's current electric rate of 4.6 
cents per kilowatt hour. With an average residential bill of one thousand 
kilowatt hours, this results in a forty-six dollar monthly bill for the typi- 
cal customer. With numbers in hand, James knew he wanted an exhibit- 
cum-computer game that would quickly show that if you ran the energy 
system right, the average bill would be forty-six dollars and change. But if 
resources were mismanaged, the customer's bill would rise dramatically. 

The problem became how to present these numbers in a way that 
would catch people's attention without resorting to having Pac-Man run- 
ning around eating light bulbs. "That's when I turned to the Apple," 
James explains. "There was such a huge library of software available, in- 
cluding games. To be a successful communicator you have to pay atten- 
tion to your audience. In the name of the TVA, I forced myself to play 
countless hours of Apple video games." (Tough job.) 



under his or her resource management. This can either be a treat or a 
horror, depending upon how close the bill is to forty-six dollars. 

"I wrote the initial versions of the game in Applesoft," James recalls. 
"The simulation-model calculations worked but it was slow and, honest- 
ly, I'm not too good at handling graphics. So Sam DeLozier, our local 
Apple dealer at Eastern Computer, introduced me to Rob Scott, a 
Knoxville-area high school student. He's an Apple wunderkind. Scott 
helped polish the program, especially the graphics. 

"Sometimes I look at the Load Control game and think it isn't that 
impressive. You look at what the arcade manufacturers, software houses, 
even the bigger budgeted pavilions here at the fair are doing and ours 
doesn't seem like a big deal. Then I look down on the floor and see long 
lines of folks waiting to get at the game, kids getting back in line. Ten 
thousand people a day running the Load Control Center! 

"Then it hits me," James concludes. "This is the most powerful tool I 
have ever had to interact with people in all my time in exhibit work. And 
we're just scratching the surface." Jl

THE ANIMATEP APPLE 
WMiGraForth 

B¥ PHIL TUOdPSOn AtlD PAUL LUTUS 



SEPTEMBER 1982 



SOU A I 1/ 



113 



With the Animated Apple, Softalk introduces the limited series by a 
guest columnist outstanding in the subject field. The Animated Apple, an in- 
troduction to GraForth, is planned to have six parts. Selected because of the 
swift, widespread interest in the new language, the column is written by the 
author of GraForth, distinguished programmer and program designer Paul 
Lutus, and the person most closely involved with the technical implementa- 
tion of the language, Phil Thompson. 

Please note that you cannot execute the instructions in this column with- 
out a GraForth package, just as you cannot follow the Pascal Path without 
Pascal, SoftCard Symposium without a SoftCard, or the Third Basic with- 
out an Apple III. 

The promise of arcade-quality graphics is a powerful inducement to 
many to buy the Apple II. The high-speed shoot-'em-ups with color ani- 
mation and realistic laser blast sounds may only be games to some folks, 
but to others they are the stuff of inspiration. What creative souls can see 
those games without imagining what they could do with Apple graphics, 
if only they knew the techniques? 

The problem is that many have tried, but few have succeeded. At 
first, it was almost impossible to find the information necessary to create 
high-quality animation. Over the years of the Apple's existence, the open 
Apple allowed more and more discoveries. Soon, shape table utilities, hi- 
res character generators, and even 3-D graphics aids were available; but 
for most people, the initial stumbling blocks remain: machine language is 
too difficult to write and debug, and Basic is too slow. Now, however, 
there is an acceptable middle ground. 

Enter GraForth. GraForth was created as a fast, structured pro- 
gramming language containing all the graphics tools needed to produce 
real-time animation in both two and three dimensions. It includes all the 
favorite graphics tools: line, plot, and fill commands; character graphics; 
turtle graphics; 3-D graphics; even a music synthesizer for producing 
notes in several voices and sound effects. 

The language of GraForth is similar to Forth, which is known for its 
speed and flexibility and for its somewhat novel approach to program- 
ming. But, because GraForth is a language created specifically for graph- 
ics on the Apple, the Basic programmer won't have to start over; many 
commands are taken from Applesoft to make GraForth easy to learn. 
Home still clears the screen, htab and vtab still position the cursor, and 
plot and line are used in the elementary graphics modes. 

GraForth operates under DOS 3.3 and your completed programs are 
compiled to machine language and stored as standard binary files. It is 
faster than Integer Basic, Applesoft (even compiled), and Pascal. For 
comparison, counting to 32,000 in Applesoft {for I = I to 32000: next) 
requires thirty-five seconds; Integer Basic (for I = I to 32000: next I) takes 
an amazing forty seconds, and Apple Pascal (for I: = 1 to 32000 do;) 
requires twenty seconds. GraForth {32000 0 do loop) takes only three sec- 
onds. This is not meant to be a complete benchmark for the languages, 
as it tests only the simple for-next (do loop) construct. 

The graphics are as easy to use as the language is fast. Character 
shapes consisting of several redefined images may be drawn to the screen 
with one command. Three-dimensional graphics include color, perspec- 
tive, and shapes of almost unlimited complexity. And turtle graphics 
works at speeds that are high enough for game programming. 

In this series, we'll explore graphics on the Apple with emphasis on 
fast, smooth, 2-D and 3-D color animation. We'll give you examples, 
hints, and several sample programs to help you learn GraForth and 
eventually create your own impressive animations. 

For background, the ability to program in some high-level language 
such as Applesoft or Integer Basic is helpful. You should be comfortable 
with the Apple hi-res screen and graphics in general. Knowledge of as- 
sembly language or a structured language such as Pascal won't hurt, but 
it isn't required. A color monitor is a plus, as much of what we'll be 
doing is in color. 

Likes and Unlikes. GraForth is quite different from Basic or Pascal. 
Like Pascal it is a structured language, and also like Pascal it is com- 
piled, not to a pseudo p-code but directly to machine language. Like Ba- 
sic, GraForth is immediate; there is no separate compiler or linker to be 
invoked. 

Where GraForth is different from Basic or Pascal is in its use of 



stacks. Pascal and Basic also use stacks internally, but they hide them 
from the user. This is done so you can type something like: 

LET A = B + C 

The Basic interpreter is smart enough to translate this line into the prop- 
er sequence of machine language routines to get the job done. This type 
of algebraic notation was used to make Basic easy to learn. The price you 
pay is speed. Generally, the more work a compiler must do to translate 
your program into the language of the machine, the more it will use very 
general-purpose routines. These routines are not particularly optimized 
for the task at hand, therefore your program slows down. 

The tradeoff, then, has been simple. Use machine language when you 
want speed and a high-level language when you want understandable, 
easy-to-develop programs. 

Fortunately, these are not the only alternatives. A high-level lan- 
guage can be built that operates in much more harmony with the ma- 
chine for which it is generating instructions. This is the idea behind Gra- 
Forth and Forthlike languages in general. By learning to use the stack, a 
data storage area that computers can use efficiently, you can keep all the 
features of high-level languages you like and still write programs that run 
ten times faster than they would written in Basic. 

Understanding stacks is not difficult. In fact, if you have used a Hew- 
lett-Packard calculator, you are already familiar with Reverse Polish No- 
tation. This system is often used in mathematics because it eliminates the 
need for parentheses. RPN is implemented by using a stack in machines 
such as computers and calculators. With this system, all operands pre- 
cede their associated operators. What this means is that if you want to 
add the numbers 3 and 4 together, you would write it as 3 4 -I- rather 
than 3-1-4. This is most easily demonstrated using turtle graphics. 

Follow the Tail. Turtle graphics is a vector graphics system, similar 
in many ways to Applesoft's shape tables. What we mean by vector 
graphics is that the shape is drawn by a series of relative moves and 
draws. This allows us to design an image and draw it at any position or 
angle on the screen. Let's tie up some loose ends with examples of both 
RPN and turtle graphics. 

GraForth's prompt is the word Ready. When you've booted up and 
gotten the prompt, get the turtle commands from your GraForth disk by 
typing 

READ " TURTLE " 

Make sure to leave spaces on both sides of the quotation marks. The 
quotation mark is a GraForth command that says, "This is some literal 
text." Commands in GraForth are always separated by spaces. For this 
reason, they are often called words. Turtle is the name of the disk file con- 
taining the turtle graphics words. 

When the prompt reappears, we're ready to start. Type: 

TURTLE 

Imagine that you now have a turtle with ink on its tail in the center of 
your screen. Turtle is a GraForth word that erases the screen and sets a 
text window along the bottom four lines. It also selects the color white 
and positions our imaginary turtle in the center of the screen, facing the 
top. We can tell it to turn and move (relative motion) or we can tell it to 
turnto or moveto an absolute position. We can also tell it to lift its tail so 
that no line will be drawn (penup) or put it down again (pendown). 
Let's try this out. Type: 

50 MOVE 

Notice that the distance, 50, is specified before the command (move). 
Now let's command our turtle to turn to the right and walk another fifty 
units. 

90 TURN 50 MOVE 

Multiple commands can be placed on one line with spaces to sepa- 
rate them. Let's complete a square with the following 

90 TURN 50 MOVE 
90 TURN 50 MOVE 

You can see the advantage of turtle graphics over standard line drawing

already. With standard line commands, we would have had to calculate 
the actual X,Y coordinates of each comer of the square. Using turtle 
graphics, we only have to know how to make a square to plot one. 

In GraForth, every time you type a number, it is placed on the data 
stack. You can see this graphically by typing stack from the Ready 
prompt. Now type the following 

4 5 6 

Don't forget the spaces between the numbers. When you press return, 
you'll see a list of these numbers inside square brackets. This is a picture 
of the data stack. The stack display can be turned off again simply by 
typing stack. 

How do GraForth words use the stack? When we typed the number 
50, it was placed on the data stack. The turtle graphics word move then 
removed this number and used it as a distance to move the turtle. Most 
words in GraForth either use the stack for parameters or affect the stack 
in some way. 

Let's Do It Again. No language would be complete without looping 
structures, and GraForth has a large variety of them. One of the easiest 
and most useful is the ifo . . . loop construct. Very similar to the Apple- 
soft for-next loop, do . . . loops, can be used to repeat a group of words a 
predefined number of times. Here is a GraForth progr£un that will draw 
a square using a do . . . loop. 

TURTLE 4 0 DO 50 MOVE 90 TURN LOOP 

Again, notice that the four and zero precede the do. This loop will sim- 
ply count to four, each time executing the body of the loop that draws 
one side of the square. (Actually, it will count from zero to three, as the 
loop limit is not included in the loop; this is a Forth convention.) 

If you typed this line into your Apple II, you immediately saw a 
square drawn on the screen. GraForth compiled and ran your short pro- 
gram, and then promptly forgot all about it. Like Applesoft, GraForth 
has both immediate and deferred execution modes. 

In Applesoft, you write a program, and, while it's necessary to be 



within the language to run it, the language and your program are entire- 
ly separate entities. GraForth handles this differently. The distinction be- 
tween your program and the language itself is much less clear. Your Gra- 
Forth program actually extends the language. In other words, what you 
write is an addition to the language that specializes it for a given task. 
That task could be a 3-D space simulation, a maze game, or anything 
else you might like to write. 

GraForth comes complete with a long hst of words. These are the 
general-purpose commands that are useful in nearly any program. Some 
are also specific graphics commands for two and three dimensional 
graphics, others for music and sound effects. You can see this list at any 
time by typing list. Pressing control-C will stop the Ust; any other key will 
continue. If you have been staying with us so far, the list should look like 
this: 

Ready LIST 

TURTLE 

TURN 

TURNTO 

MOVE 

MOVETO 

PENDOWN 

PENUP 



These are the commands that you can use to write your programs. Your 
programs actually extend this list; each word you create is appended to 
the top. In fact, we already extended it for turtle graphics when we typed 

READ " TURTLE " 

The turtle graphics commands were read from the disk file called Turtle 
and added to our Hst of commands. This list is often called a dictionary or 
word library. Each word performs a certain task (like a subroutine in Ba- 
sic or Pascal), and the entire list is your program. 

Forget Me Not. Armed with this knowledge, let's create our own 



LOCK-IT-UP 5.0 

Copy-Protection System 
for the Apple II 

by Jeff Gold 



Lock-lt-Up 5.0 is a sophisticated copy-protection and 
duplication system for the Apple II Computer. It features 
several levels of protection which make standard diskettes 
uncopyable by even the most sophisticated nibble copy 
programs now available including Locksmith 4.1.

3.3environment will work underthe Lock-lt-Up system. 

• All sectors on the diskette can still be used. 

• Files can be loaded and/or saved to both the protected 
diskette or a normal diskette. 

• You can change and/or delete the names of any of the 
DOS commands. 

• You can require Autostart ROM. 

• You can autorun Applesoft programs so that even if a 
person can break out of your program, whatever they 
type will cause the program to execute again. 

• Save to tape has been disabled. 

• You can have your program clear memory and reboot if 
the reset key is pressed. 

• Our copy system supports up to 14 disk drives. 

• Complete data verification is available during copy

word. Earlier, we wrote a simple GraForth program to draw a square. 
Unfortunately, it was immediately run and then forgotten. We can create 
programs that are added to the word library by defining a new word. 
Here is the new GraForth word square. 

: SQUARE 
TURTLE 
4 0 DO 

50 MOVE 

90 TURN 
LOOP ; 

Notice that, except for the first and last lines, it is identical to our earlier 
program. We indented this one for clarity since a GraForth word defini- 
tion may extend over several lines. The first line is made up of two parts, 
a colon and the text square. The colon is a GraForth word that means 
"define a new word." The text square is the name of the new word being 
defined and is the name that will appear in the word library. Everything 
following the name square is the string of words that defines what the new 
word will do. Notice that it simply uses words that have already been de- 
fined to create the new word. ITie semicolon (;) at the end of the list says 
"end of definition." At this point the commands are compiled and the 
new word is added to the word library. We can see it now by typing list: 

Ready LIST 

SQUARE 

TURTLE 

TURN 

TURNTO 



and we can run it by typing run, which runs the top (last defined) word in 
the word library, or by typing the name of the word itself. 

Ready RUN 
Ready SQUARE 



Both words cause our square word to be executed, and we are returned 
to the Ready prompt. 

Some Homework. We've covered quite a bit this month. Before we 
leave, here is a new Turtle file you can type into the GraForth editor and 
save over the existing file (make sure you do this to a copy of your Gra- 
Forth disk, not the original!). With this version, animation is much easier 
because you can use pemp to move without drawing a line, pendown to 
draw, and unpen to remove an existing line. This allows you to erase en- 
tire shapes, similar to the use of xdraw with Applesoft shape tables.

$ HORSERACING $ 




The KEL-CO SYSTEM, developed by Dr. A.S. Kelsey, Professor of Matfiematics, and Mike Cox, an expert in horse race handicapping, has been 
available separately for Thoroughbred and Harness racing since the late 1960's and has increased in popularity as the technical presentation of 
it has improved. 

The in depth analysis of 10,000 races for each of Thoroughbred and Harness racing was conducted to determine which measurable variables 
were most predictive and which of the intangibles could be organized into a workable form. 

CANNELLA SALES CORP. NOW INTRODUCES TWO KEL-CO SOFTWARE PACKAGES FOR ANALYSING 

THOROUGHBRED AND HARNESS HORSES! 

THE PROGRAMS 

Because of Computer technology, a novice need only learn how to interpret the racing papers (clear instructions included) to operate these 
programs. You'll enjoy becoming a RallblrdI 



THOROUGHBRED PROGRAM (RS-5): Horses' ratings reflect 
True Class levels. The Program takes into account the levels of 
racing at all North American racetracks so that ratings always 
remain consistent; Fitness of the horse is also a major element

consideration of factors like Distance, Weight, Surface etc. 



TROT PROGRAM (RS-6): Horses' ratings are derived through the 
mathematical links among Speed, Finishes, Post Positions and Track 
Lengths. Adjustments are then made for Current Form, Class 
Changes, Driver Changes etc. This method can be used at any 
Harness racetrack for which normal past performance data is avail- 
able. 



INPUT/OUTPUT — The Programs operate on the basis of prompts where the user responds with material from the racing papers, and in some 
cases personal judgement. 

Results may be produced one horse at a time or for complete races; horses are rated, ranked and qualified on a list (screen copy or hard copy). 
Wagering guidelines for Straight-Win, Place, Show and Combination Bets, eg. Daily Doubles, Exactas — are given in the Programs. These rules 
are applied in accordance with the horses' ratings and qualifications.

SEPTEMBER 1982 





Special Psycliology witli 
Executive Secretary 



BV lOHATUAtl hlLLER 



The moment sexologist Bill Terrell laid eyes on the man he sensed 
this would be no ordinary case. The middle-aged machine shop super- 
visor who stood before him didn't fit Terrell's general client profile — ui> 
per income, college-educated, white collar. This guy was a soulmate of 
Archie Bunker. A married grease monkey in overalls, he had one whale 
of a problem. He was hearing sexual voices. 

"He had a fear that he was a latent homosexual," Terrell recalls. "He 
was hearing little voices in his head telling him that women were no good 
and his deduction was, 'If I think women are no good then I must like 
men.' " 

The man wasn't impotent and there was nothing in his background 
or present activities to indicate that he had homosexual tendencies. Since 
it was possible that his client might be overlooking or repressing some 
clue, Terrell referred him to a clinical psychologist who put him under 
hypnosis. But nothing new emerged. 

Telling Hands. Terrell was returning to square one when, during a 
subsequent visit, he noticed the man's hands. They were red and swol- 
len. They got that way, the worker explained, because he occasionally 
had them in a powerful machine shop cleaning agent. Could there be a 
connection between the cleanser and the man's sexual problem, Terrell 
wondered? Terrell had played hunches other times that he was stumped. 
When the examination report came back from the toxicologist, he had 
his answer. The cleaning agent was highly toxic and accumulating in 
such quantities in his client's system that it was easily capable of produc- 
ing the sexual hallucinations. 

An unusual case, to be sure, but representative of the methods em- 
ployed in sexual detective work by Bill Terrell — private sex counselor, 
sex educator, consultant, author, sauna store owner, and, out of organ- 
izing necessity, word processing Apple owner. 

Ten years ago, Terrell took the considerable risk of abandoning the 
nine-to-five ranks. At age forty-eight, with his wife's blessing, he re- 
turned to school to enter what was then the highly suspect calling of sex- 
ology. He earned certification as a sex educator and counselor and 
picked up the master's degree in public health along the way. 



Two years ago, buoyed by unexpected growth in his business inter- 
ests, he took the plunge into computers. In addition to his private coun- 
seling, he was teaching a popular course in human sexuality to nurses, 
lawyers, social workers, and other helping professionals at the Univer- 
sity of Minnesota. He and nurse/wife Kim were conducting weekend 
sexuality workshops for couples. By himself, Terrell was teaching 
another course at a local community college, doing consulting work for 
the Minneapolis Board of Education, working on two books, and han- 
dling bulk mailings for the sauna store. He was drowning in a sea of pa- 
perwork. So he leapt in head first, but it wasn't exactly a ten-point dive. 

Heavy Thinker. "Before I got a computer I was the kind of guy who 
didn't put anything on paper until I had worked it out in my mind. I 
didn't like the idea of going through nineteen different drafts. Now I try 
to write three hours a day. I sit down and write. Later, if it's no good, I 
can throw it out, or, if there's something good there, which happens too, 
I can edit it. I find that's a very motivating tool." 

It is July 1982. Terrell the Nontechnical is surrounded by his $7,500 
investment in new-found tools. They dominate the study in his town- 
house home in the Minneapolis suburb of Burnsville. The hardware: an 
Apple II Plus, two disk drives, a Hayes modem (microcoupler), a Bit 
Three eighty-column card, and a Missing Link board for his IBM Elec- 
tronic 50 printer. The software: an Executive Secretary word processing 
package (word processor, mail sort, speller); VisiCalc spreadsheet; Ap- 
ple Dow Jones access program; five or six word games; and a gin rummy 
program. 

A man who plays the market and changes careers in mid life ob- 
viously doesn't shrink from taking chances, but every gamble has its 
risks. He got burnt on word processing, which constitutes 75 percent of 
his computer use. First there was the thrice-told tale of service in the 
Service Age — a salesclerk who didn't know all he should about his prod- 
ucts. The same salesclerk at the recently opened store where Terrell 
bought his Apple also managed to sell him a DOS version of WordStar, a 
program, alas, that the clerk was unable to demonstrate. "I bought it 
blind," sighs a now wiser Terrell. "Then I found I didn't like it. I'm not a 



SEPTEMBER 1982 



computer-oriented person, and to sit down and decipher the documen- 
tation all by myself was a difficult job." 

Matchmaker. When a friend suggested Minneapolis-based Personal 
Business Systems, makers of Executive Secretary, Terrell found the per- 
fect mate. "One of the reasons I bought the program was because the 
demonstrator knew what he was doing, and the store offered an hour's 
free instruction with the package." The salesman spoke in plain English. 
His most complicated computer word was cursor. And Terrell, a com- 
puter pilgrim in search of a guru, was sold. 

Before Apple and Executive Secretary, Terrell wrote by hand. He'd 
knock out a first draft in pen and ink, give it to a secretary at the univer- 
sity for typing, and then initiate his final edit. "Now i do all that on the 
Apple and print out finished copies. It has speeded up things consider- 
ably." 

This has been particularly true in filing and retrieving the notes he 
works up on patient visits. "Quite often, I'll refer someone to a doctor — 
like I did in the case of the machine shop worker — and I'll send along a 
copy of the client's sexual history, if the client permits. It cuts down on 
the doctor's work and the patient doesn't have to go through the history 
a second time." Word processing has also been a tremendous timesaver 
in the preparation of lecture plans, curriculum redesigns, class handouts, 
and tests, which must be revised each term under university rules. 

More from Less. Speed and ease have been the bread and butter is- 
sues for Terrell, but the benefits haven't been limited solely to word proc- 
essing, thanks in large part to the versatility of the Executive Secretary 
program. "It has a lot of capability. I have mail merge, so I can do 498 
mail labels, sorting them by ZIP code. I've never been a good speller, but 
with the Executive Speller program, which has twenty thousand check 
words built in and file space for twenty thousand more, I can put the 
medical terminology I use into its dictionary." There are, in addition, 
those little extras that make his creative life less taxing. He can transfer 
files and enfire disks with relative ease to create backup copies, as is his 
habit. Using the program's abbreviation capability, he can punch in ac- 
ronyms of munchable medical terms and leave the typing to his IBM. 

"There's another thing," he says, continuing to count the ways. "You 
don't have to put in as many printer commands on Executive Secretary 
when it's on an eighty-column board as with other word processors. You 
just hit caret NR and it keeps everything from there on exactly as it's put 
on the screen. I can do all kinds of designs — center, justify, flush left, or 
flush right — and have it come out in type exactly the way it is on the 
screen." 

Tiny Troubles. But surely this word processing marriage has hitches? 
In the beginning, yes. The documentation, now much improved, pre- 
sumed more than it explained. An oversight in the labeling program 
documentation failed to mention the need to insert a period after a street 
name that followed a string of address numbers. An early version of the 
printer program capitalized everything after a colon, while the IBM 
printer indulged its own upper-case aberrations by capitalizing letters fol- 
lowing an M or W. John Risken, programmer of Executive Secretary, 
took care of the first; IBM, confirming the wisdom of a yearly service 
contract, corrected the latter. 

Those minor annoyances behind him, Terrell is at peace with his Ap- 
ple and Executive Secretary. They comfort him in his creative hours of 
need. It had been his custom, Terrell explains, to keep a tape recorder by 
his bedside just in case the muse interrupted his slumbers. 

Now, whenever the spirit moveth he shuffles into his word process- 
ing study to record his inspiration — secure in the knowledge he won't be 
disturbing his household. "Even if I accomplish nothing else," he says, "I 
at least can go back and get some sleep. 

"I saw this system as a tool by which to increase my joy in the qual- 
ity of my work and it has delivered." 

Back in the 1950s, Terrell's professional joy was wrapped up in in- 
dustrial photography. Taking advantage of the postwar boom in chemi- 
cal plant construction, he'd built up his own freelance business and by 
the mid fifties was supporting four other families as well as his own. He 
was doing it his way and ulcerating all the way to the bank. 

Too Perfect "I was the classic Type A personality," he recalls. "I 
had an airplane, a nice ranch-style home, two cars, chain-smoked cigars,

probably drank too much, and was making a helluva bundle of money — 
but my stomach couldn't stand it." His wife Kim couldn't either. It was 
his stomach and he'd have to do what he thought was right, she told him, 
but there was a caveat: "I don't want to be a rich young widow with four 
children; there's no demand for them." 

So Terrell sold the business, joined the corporate ranks as a photog- 
rapher for a subsidiary of Standard Oil of Indiana, gradually moved in- 
to public relations, and lived contentedly until the next crisis seventeen 
years later. The kids were gone. 

"We looked at each other and said, 'Who are you?' We were no longer 
involved in bang parents and we hadn't gotten much chance to know 
each other." The seed of a third career was planted when Bill and Kim 
Terrell sought counseling, but it would take another couple of years be- 
fore it flowered. Terrell would flirt momentarily with a marketing job for 
an industrial film company in Minneapolis and take another fling at free- 
lancing before realizing, in the midst of his gathering mid-life crisis, that 
what he wanted to do was get into something with more human orienta- 
tion. "I was looking for something where I could work more closely with 
people. And I was just gutsy enough to give sexology a whirl." 

Naked Dread. Terrell has never forgotten the incident. It happened 
about six years ago, soon after he started his private practice. He was 
puttering around his home office when he got a frantic call from one of 
his clients, a sobbing married woman, who, with her husband, had been 
in counseling several weeks. At the time, Terrell had a standing rule of 
only working with couples, but, under a fresh tempest of tears, he re- 
lented. 

Soon after the woman arrived, Terrell was called from the room to 
take a long-distance phone call. "I couldn't have been gone more than 
three minutes," he says today, still amazed. "She'd taken off all her 
clothes and was lying down on the couch; my heart was in my throat and 
I sort of gulped. It must have been panic. I tried not to show it; I sat 
down in my chair and said, 'Mrs. So and So, before the phone call came, 
we were discussing such and such,' and she started talking. We went on 
for what seemed an hour; finally she sat up on the edge of the couch and 
began to dress. And nothing was ever said about the clothes." 

Terrell, an Episcopal vestryman of long standing, did the right and 
professional thing, but such overtures can be a problem, and can even 
feed the public appetite for scandal. "A year rarely passes without a di- 
rect or pretty explicit offer from one of my students," says TerreU. "But I 
have a personal value system that says that's absolutely out." 

Bad Amateurs. What bums Terrell and like-minded members of the 
five thousand strong American Association of Sex Educators, Counse- 
lors, and Therapists (AASECT) are unscrupulous practitioners — all too 
often, self-serving sex therapists who are abusing professional standards 
in attempting to alter sexual behavior. "There were and still are a num- 
ber of people who see this as a method of satisfying their own voyeurism 
and unhealth as far as sex is concerned," he says bitterly. "I don't think 
there's a lot of this going on, but, unfortunately, we hear about the bad 
situations." 

Terrell attributes much of this abuse to the growing pains of a young 
profession and the failure of the states to enact licensing legislation. 
(AASECT accreditation, which Terrell has, is voluntary.) 

Although sex education has been around since the forties, it didn't 
catch on until the Me Generation seventies, when sex therapy hitched a 
ride on the self-improvement bandwagon. 

Logic argued that the purveyors of the new sexual wisdom would 
emerge from the heavily degreed medical ranks; instead, the new faith 
was advanced by another seventies creation — the paraprofessional like 
Terrell. 

Semi-Dark Ages. "Most of the physicians you'd normally go to 
back then were not well-trained in and not very comfortable with the 
area of human sexuality," Terrell contends. "It was only eleven years 
ago, a year after AASECT was formed, that a medical school first of- 
fered training in human sexuality to students." 

Doctors weren't much interested in the subject, an attitude reflected 
today in a still common doctorly oversight. "This is a practice I get kind 
of hacked about from time to time," he says, getting hacked. "There's a 
high blood pressure medication doctors prescribe, but they don't men- 
tion to the patients that impotence is a possible side effect." And the rea-

son they neglect to mention that little detail, Terrell adds helpfully, is be- 
cause they presume it's of little moment. 

The information Terrell dispenses — and that's principally what he 
does — seems very basic, yet it's surprising, he says, how little the word is 
getting around. He tells the story of a thirty-seven-year-old divorced 
woman with two kids who was deeply troubled by spending a weekend 
with a new suitor — but not because of sex. What disturbed her was 
naked bodies; despite eleven years of marriage, she'd never seen her hus- 
band in the nude. He'd go to the bathroom, don jammies and robe, hit 
the light, and crawl into bed. 

"The only sex they ever had was under the covers and in the dark. 
She was scared to death. Once she blurted it out and we talked about it, 
she b^an to laugh and see how foolish it sounded. That was the extent 
of the therapy. She needed somebody to give her permission." 

Opposites Attract. Terrell believes in a world where sex is natural 
and as gloriously varied as the people who engage in it. He also realizes 
that he lives in a world where guilt-ridden sexual pilgrims agonize over 
sin and performance. "There's this belief that you have to be superhu- 
man in order to be normal," says Terrell of his democratically inclined 
and statistically minded brethren. "What's normal for you may not be 
for me. That's one of the messages we try to get across in these classes: 
for people to accept themselves and their sexuality as their own individ- 
ual thing — as long as it's not harmful to them or their partners." 

The people who come to see Terrell and other therapists haven't en- 
tered the sexual promised land — at least not yet. They're still hung up on 
the here, not the after, but sexology is blazing research trails to smooth 
their libidinous journey. 

"Sex is a normal human function and you've got to learn to talk 
about it," he preaches. "If you don't get over that or find some way to 
accommodate it, you won't be able to talk to your own children without 
passing along the same sort of negative impressions." 

Amen. 31 



Olivieri's Outline 
of 

Word Processors 

by Peter Olivieri 



Did you ever stop to think how dependent you are on words? Con- 
sider the impact that newspapers, magazines, paperback books, person- 
al letters, textbooks, legal contracts, instruction manuals, dictionaries, 
encyclopedias, and family records have on your life. 

Word processors were developed to help people manage the 
enormous quantity of information they encounter every day — to help 
them "process" the words. With the arrival of the microcomputer, it be- 
came possible to give word processing skills to more people. 

Perhaps the first steps in acquainting yourself with word processing 
are to learn what a word processing system can do and to become com- 
fortable with the terminology often used to describe the various features 
of a word processing system. 

Over the course of a series of articles, we'll consider such things as: 
what a word processing system can do for you; what equipment makes 
up a good word processing system; what features are worth looking for 
in a word processing system; and what word processing packages are 
available for the Apple. 

What can a word processing system do for you? In the end, only you 
can answer this question. But if you write reports, are an author (or a 
frustrated one), do a lot of typing, or prepare lots of form letters — or if 
you'd like to provide a service that makes such skills available to

others — a word processor can simplify your life considerably. It's been 
demonstrated time and time again that once people have used a word 
processing system for their work, they seldom return to the "old ways." 

Consider some of the applications. Have you ever gotten a form let- 
ter that looks very much like one that's been written especially to you? 
Here's your name, there's your address — yes, it certainly resembles a per- 
sonal letter. 

Such letters are a very common application of word processing. To 
create letters of this sort, you enter and then store on disk the names and 
addresses of the people to whom you want to send the letter. Once you 
have saved these, you can update the list as often as you wish. 

Your next step is to type one copy of the original letter. In places 
where you'd like a person's name to appear, you type a code word (per- 
haps the word "name") and do the same for any other pieces of infor- 
mation you have about the person that might eventually find their way 
into your letter. The letter itself is then saved. You can then issue a com- 
mand from your word processing machine that will merge the list of 
names with this original letter and print out a personal letter to each of 
the people on your list. The speed at which this can be done is much 
faster than you could achieve by typing each letter separately and, of 
course, each letter is error-free. 

Let's Get Personal. A similar application can be found in the offices 
of many attorneys. Attorneys are often called upon to draw up a con- 
tract that consists 90 percent of standard material and only 10 percent of 
material that must be tailored to a particular client or situation. If the 
contract is resident on a word processing system, the attorney can quite 
easily recall it, enter the data that is relevant to the current client, and 
then have a personalized contract printed. 

Authors are another group that can make good use of word proces- 
sors. Mind you, a word processor does not make you a better author. 
But it certainly can increase your productivity and make you more ef- 
ficient. 

Goodbye, Pencils. Suppose you've just written a twenty-five page re- 
port only to discover that you have to add a lengthy paragraph in the 



middle of page 2. If you're working at a typewriter, your only alternative 
is to retype page 2, along with every page that follows. But if you had 
done the report on a word processor, you could easily make the inser- 
tion, have the computer "push down" all of the subsequent material, and 
then get a fresh printout of your document. Indeed, a word processing 
program can number your pages automatically, specify margins, indent 
paragraphs, print headings and footnotes, and so on. It may even check 
your spelling. And when you're done, the perfected version of your work 
still resides on disk, ready for further changes or to be stored in your per- 
manent archives. 

The advanced features of many word processing systems allow you 
to do the following kinds of things. 

1. You can search through a document for every occurrence of a 
particular word or phrase (this feature is useful if you're creating an in- 
dex of your document). 

2. You can find every occurrence of a particular word or phrase and 
replace it with a different word or phrase. 

3. You can have special control over a printer that is interfaced with 
your word processor. This allows you to print subscripts and super- 
scripts, underscores, centered titles, and nicely aligned tables, and also 
enables you to make use of various other formatting features. 

4. You can program a specific key on the keyboard to provide a 
special sequence of commands that you would normally have to enter 
one at a time. 

5. Some word processors can be linked together to form a network 
in which documents and data can be shared. 

6. Some typesetters are experimenting with linking word processors 
to their typesetting machines. 

Perhaps this list of applications has begun to give you some idea of 
the kinds of services that a word processing system can provide. You can 
probably think of many others. 

Next month we'll talk about equipment a particular system might 
consist of and how to use it. We'll also discuss some of the word proc- 
essing features you may want to consider. □! 



You Can't Tell the Players 
\^thout a Scorecard 

Unfortunately, Softalk can't keep you up to date on all the pennant races. But in the great game of micro- 
connputer journalism, we're trying to touch all the bases. 

Each month Softalk will satisfy your personal computing needs, whether you're a novice or an experi- 
enced Apple user. From peeking and poking the Apple III in the August issue (they said it couldn't be 
done) to our new ongoing educational column, The Schoolhouse Apple, we're trying to bring you the best 
magazine possible devoted entirely to the Apple computers. 

The best part is, it's free to new subscribers for a trial period. If you've never received Softalk and you own 
an Apple computer, send in your name, address, and Apple serial number. We'll start sending you Softalk 
free of charge. To do this, please use the enclosed postage paid card. 

If you've been receiving Soffa//c already, you've gotten or will get soon a notice for paid subscription. Con- 
sider wisely. 

Those of you attending Applefest in Minneapolis, September 16-19, are invited to visit with us for a spell. 
Come by the Softalk booth where there'll be sample copies, of Softdisk, an interactive monthly magazine 
on diskette, available for viewing and purchasing. You can also pick up Roger Wagner's majoropus on as- 
sembly language programming at the beginner's level, Assembly Lines: The Book.

Unless otherwise noted, all products can be assumed to run on either Apple

ROM Applesoft can be met by RAM Applesoft in a language card. Many 
Apple II programs will run on the Apple III in the emulator mode. 

Zork III. By Marc Blank and Dave Liebling. A Softalk reviewer recent- 
ly reported the ringing of the death knell for the text adventure. This re- 
view is out to prove that he was hearing things, and Zork III is the ideal 
example for making the point. Zork III, along with its Zorkian prede- 
cessors and the recent mystery hit Deadline, is very much alive and 
totally text. 

When there are no more computerists who pleasure in intelligence 
and erudition, when there are no gamers with imagination, when there 
are no users who enjoy good prose, then those who are left may hear 
such a bell toll. For now, we can revel in Zork III. 

The Infocom team improves with every outing — and they started at 
the top. Zork III is filled with well-written descriptions of imaginatively 
delightful and curious places. The grandeur of the ancient high-arched 
aqueduct system, shining in stolen sunlight; the damp, swirling mists of 
the Land of Shadow; the brilliance of the pit of fire, two hundred feet in 
diameter, its depths and heights lost in turbulent smoke and sunlike 
flame — all these are far more graphic than any depiction yet achieved by 
an adventure with graphics. 

Realize that the Zorks are essentially a trilogy chronicling the history 
of a great lost empire that once flourished underground. It was a realm 



that reached some level of achievement before its demise, having created 
entire aqueduct systems and hollowed-out mountains. It had great banks 
and businesses and a royal government, complete with crown jewels. It 
also had a Royal Puzzle. 

Most of these achievements exist only in ruins now, and much has 
been lost completely. Grues menace the remains — gruesome predeces- 
sors of gruds and far more discreet in that they never show themselves. 
For many years the empire has been little more than a testing ground for 
adventurers and a home for a few seldom-glimpsed eremites. 

And, of course, a prime mover. No? Yes, indeed. Someone had to 
give Blank and Liebling their inspiration, fill them in on the story. If you 
are clever enough, and good enough, and sensitive enough, you may 
meet this being in Zork III. 

When you begin Zork III, you do not know your goal. That's one of 
the problems you must solve. Careful observation and constant relating 
of information will determine how well you'll solve this one. 

What you will know is that the total score you are after is seven. 
That's all. 

Two things are most unusual about the scoring system in Zork III. 
Each point is given for having behaved properly in a situation or toward 
a puzzle; it is not given for solving the puzzle or for knowing what you've 
done. You can earn all the points and not know how you did it. The 
true lover of logic and adventure will not be satisfied until those points 
are understood; all the evidence is there. 

And, indeed, when you've gained all the points, you aren't through. 
You still have to prove yourself with one of the hardest, yet most clearly 
logical, puzzles in adventuredom. 

Zork III, like all Infocom adventures, is not a word game. The vo- 
cabulary is extensive for an adventure, and if you use a word Zork 
doesn't know, it tells you which word is the problem. Niggling over 
words is not the point; logical problem solving is. And you need not be 
afraid to use erudite words; if the word fits the situation, 2tork probably 
knows it. 

Although plot is not its forte, Zork III has a theme, morals, and 
meaning. It's a masterpiece of logic that demands that you think. No ad- 
venturer — or game-enjoying thinker — should be without it. n(T 
Zork III, by Marc Blank and Dave Liebling, Infocom (55 Wheeler Street, Cam- 
bridge, MA 02138; 617-492-1031). $39.95. 

Transend. A unique feature of the Transend communication pro- 
grams is that you can enter at any level and then upgrade to the more so- 
phisticated packages by paying only the price difference and a $20 up- 
grade charge. Another nice feature is the inclusion of a backup copy. 

Transend I turns the Apple into an intelligent terminal with file 
transfer capabilities and a limited editor. The entire system is based on 
numerous menus that guide you through setting up the system and 
executing the desired operations. The first task you are asked to perform 
when initially running the program is to set up the hardware configura- 
tion and system parameters. On the hardware side, Transend supports 
over twenty-five various communications, printer, modem, eighty- 
column video, and clock-calendar interface cards. 

Transend has the capability to redefine any or all character codes. 
This can be done for either input data or output data. It will also sup- 
port lower case on an unmodified Apple. The forty-column screen can be 
set up to display either upper case or lower case as inverse characters. 

Finally, Transend also offers the unique capability of controlling the 
high-order bit of all data passed through it. This bit is normally not used 
with text transmission, but special functions such as binary transfers, 
graphics, and transmissions to certain systems may require control of this 
bit. It can be preserved as entered or forced either high or low. Further- 
more, you can specify this action for both incoming and outgoing data as

well as to the printer — all separately. 

Transend has many other advanced features, including data com- 
pression and decompression to reduce transmission time. TheX-on/X- 
off protocol is also supported for compatibility with some remote sys- 
tems, and makes it possible automatically to save the contents of the cap- 
ture buffer to disk when it becomes full. Transfer-rate protocol is also 
fully supported by either full-duplex echo-back, nulls after carriage re- 
turn, or delay between characters. With all of these options, it should be 
possible to communicate and send files to almost any remote computer 
system. 

While Transend I will only send text files, Transend 2 allows trans- 
mission of any DOS 3.3 files, including those created by VisiCalc. When 
communicating with another Tmnsend-equipped Apple, verified trans- 
missions (using a CRC-16 error-checking code) are possible. This means 
that the receiving computer can check the validity of the data it gets and 
signal the sender if it spots an error. The transmission computer will then 
attempt to send that block of data again until it arrives correctly. 

Transend 2 also lets you create a transmit list for multiple-file trans- 
mission at one time. A transmission-time estimator is included to inform 
you of the approximate connect time needed at the various baud rates. 
The main menu lets you select what type of operation to perform; each 
selection takes you to a different submenu with choices to further define 
the task. When making selections on these menus, the program will 
usually ask for confirmation on each command. However, an expert 
mode can be selected to disable this and speed up operation of the 
program. 

Transend 3 will reportedly add further capabilities in the area of elec- 
tronic mail. Unattended operation is supported by adding a clock-calen- 
dar card to the system, and scheduling the time for outgoing messages to 
be sent. Incoming mail is automatically logged and saved to the disk. 
Several other features of the electronic mail system are: automatic re- 
dialing at periodic intervals, password file protection, predefined text for- 
mats, and multiple addresses at one telephone number. 

The program can maintain a mailing list with up to one hundred 
mailbox phone numbers and local mail stops. Mass mailing of a single 
document to multiple users should also be possible by the creation of an 



appropriate list. The scheduler will sort and schedule mail flow accord- 
ing to user-defined priorities. Incoming correspondence can be received 
automatically and sorted by recipient. With the appropriate password, 
recipients can display, modify, or print their mail. 

Transend 3 will also add a full-featured text editor and a personal ap- 
pointment scheduler. The Detached Mailbox option allows non-Tran- 
send users to send electronic mail to the system. This could significantly 
lower the overall cost of a complete system because some stations might 
not require the purchase of their own Transend 3 package. 

All in all, the Transend series appears to be very well-written and easy 
to use. The documentation is excellent, even though the program hardly 
needs it; in most cases, the numerous menus, displays, and prompts 
make the program self-documenting. The program also gets an A -I- for 
error handling — improper keyboard entries are not allowed and the old 
reset key cannot disrupt the program. 

Until October 1, SSM is offering free membership in the Source in- 
formation utility with the purchase of any Transend package. That's al- 
most like getting Transend / for free. Now there's an offer that's hard to 
beat! m

The Snapper. By Dave Sanders. This game from the folks who brought 
you Word Handler would have been better named "The Sleeper." One 
can play it for a while and be quite bored, but given half a chance it be- 
comes a most engrossing diversion. The cover is somewhat misleading, 
asking, "Can You Survive the Snapper?" when, in fact, you are the 
Snapper. Your job is to eat blots, avoid the whirlers, and, for God's sake, 
stay away from the gamma-field! 

The game is played on a somewhat haphazard grid, which contains a 
number of blots. There are two types of blots scattered about, red and 
blue, which increase in value every time you snap one up. However, you 
don't really get any points for consuming them until you reach a base, of 
which there are four on the grid. To prevent you from reaching the base, 
there are the whiriers and the gamma-field. The former whirl about the 
grid, consuming parts of it as they go, thus rendering it substantially 
more difficult to reach base. The gamma-field seems like nothing more 



APPLE SPEAKS 
INTELUGENTLY! 



The people who dared to teach Atari to talk are again 
challenging the microcomputer establishment with the 
VOICEBOX Speech Synthesizer for Apple. This low cost intel- 
ligent peripheral can speak thousands of words unassisted, 
generated directly from its firmware ROM dictionary lo- 
cated on its plug-in card. This means that speech, with 
variable intonation and speed, can be used in any of your 
apple programs without ever having to bother loading a 
disk. And, in case you want to expand your dictionary to 
include unusual words or words in foreign languages, you 
can easily define them with our 64 phonemes and store 
them by the thousands on one of the six special dictionaries 
provided for on our disk. 

In addition your VOICEBOX for Apple can be easily coded to 
sing on key with uniform barlengths and you can store 
(record) your songs on disk, retrieving and modifying sec- 
tions whenever you want. With the disk system, you'll also 
enjoy an educational random sentence generator and 
graphic speech animation! The VOICEBOX for Apple will 
run on 32K Apple II with Applesoft or Apple II Plus systems 
equipped with sixteen-sector disk drives. VOICEBOX for 
Apple comes with loudspeaker and disk. The Alien Group 
also makes a less expensive VOICEBOX for Apple with all 
features (including expandable disk dictionary), but ex- 
cluding firmware ROM and singing capability. Speaker is 
optional on this unit. 




For Atari users, 
the VOICEBOX for 
16K and up Atari 
plugs directly into the 
serial port. No extra cables are 

needed and no speaker is needed since the speech comes 
directly over your TV monitor. This unit has all speech syn- 
thesis features except singing and firmware ROM. 
AL-3001 VOICEBOX for Apple, With firmware ROM, singing 
capability and speaker $215.00 
AL-3501 VOICEBOX for Apple. Without firmware ROM,

than a collection of pick-up sticks run amok — any contact with these 
moving refugees from a toothpick factory results in annihilation. 

After you've wolfed down ten blots or so, a ring appears in the cen- 
ter of the screen. The ring increases a multiplier at the top of the screen 
by one, which in turn determines the value of the blots you have eaten 
once you return to base. Furthermore, getting the ring will cause the grid 
to be redrawn, undermining all the hard work performed by the relent- 
less whirlers. After every five rings an extra life is awarded. 

Got that? Simply put, one must avoid the bad guys while scarfing up 
blots and grabbing rings whenever possible. An occasional return to base 
helps rack up the points. There is a timer displayed at the top of the 
screen just to heighten the tension. At higher levels of play the interval is 
inaeased. And just to complicate things even further, the grid itself 
changes! At higher levels some of the grid lines switch from purple to 
blue, representing "slicks." Such pathways enable the Snapper to travel 
at a much higher speed, but preclude its turning off onto a side path un- 
til the end of the slick has been reached. Should you double back on the 
slick upon reaching the end, then you are able to turn onto another line. 
At the highest level of play, life in the fast lane takes over and the entire 
grid becomes slicks. However, mere mortals should not worry about ever 
facing this hazard. 

In the interest of a slightly longer game, the folks at SVS have 
thoughtfully provided us with limited shields that enable you harmlessly 
to cross paths with the whirlers but not with the gamma-field. The shields 
only last for a couple of seconds, though, and are usually employed too 
late. 

The Snapper is truly a game of strat^y, despite first appearing to be 
simply a game of reflexes. In order to really get anywhere, you must 
figure out when to go for blots and when to head for base, as well as 



which blots to go after and in what sequence. Each time you return to 
base, the blots are redrawn (although the grid remains as the whirlers left 
it until a ring is captured) and the level of difficulty increases. Thus the 
longer you stay afield, the higher that round's score will be, and the more 
you get to play at the easier levels. Failure to get the rings at the low 
levels ensures a rapid demise at the higher levels, yet the longer you stay 
away from base, the more dilapidated the grid gets and the harder it is to 
get home. In short, you constantly have to make quick decisions, and all 
wrong decisions bring about even tougher dilemmas. Not many games 
play that way . . . only the good ones. DA

Cytron Masters. By Dan Bunten. With much fanfare, Strategic Simula- 
tions has introduced the Rapid Fire line, four battle simulations de- 
signed to satisfy popular demand for fast-paced games without betray- 
ing their strategy roots and traditions. Galactic Gladiators is a somewhat 
traditional tactical (rather than strategic) game, but Cytron Masters is a 
new concept altogether. 

The premise behind this game is like that behind RobotWar by Muse. 
That is, humanity has advanced to a stage where conventional war be- 
tween human combatants is either threatening to race survival or con- 
sidered abhorrent by a more enlightened society than our own. Either 
way, the culture has chosen to accept robot warfare and abide by its out- 
come as a substitute for the more destructive alternative. (Apparently, 
simply abolishing war leaves a void in diplomacy and also eliminates a 
lot of good games.) 

Coming from the author of Computer Quarterback, it is interesting 
that Cytron Masters is comparable, albeit superficially, to football. Your 
role in the warfare is described as manager, but is similar to the position

of a coach. You are not represented by any particular character on the 
battlefield. 

The actual combatants are Cytrons, of which there are four standard 
types. Each behaves in a simple, preprogrammed way. Mines explode on 
contact with any enemy unit. Bunkers are simply moving walls. They 
have the strongest defenses, but no offensive capabilities. They are used 
to draw fire from other units or to defend power centers or the com- 
mand center, the enemy's principal objectives. Commanders don't at- 
tack either, nor do they defend very well. They are communication de- 
vices, relaying your orders to the units around them. Shooters have the 
most complex behavior. They shoot at the nearest enemy unit within a 
certain distance. All of them move about as ordered, in one of four 
directions, or halt. 

The word Cytrons is short for cybernetic electronic devices. As the 
American Heritage Dictionary defines cybernetics as "the theoretical 
study of control processes in electronic, mechanical, and biological sys- 
tems," this is a particularly apt name. Control processes are the essence 
of what makes Cytron Masters unique. 

Your control over the proceedings (and your opponent's control, 
whether you compete with the computer or a friend) comes under the 
category of deployment. Like the Joint Chiefs of Staff, you needn't worry 
about the individual shots fired. You control the larger picture: what types 
of Cytrons to create, where to position them, when to defend, and how 
to attack. You give commands through the paddle controls, using a to- 
tally menu-driven format. 

Despite your executive status, don't expect to be able to sit back in 
your armchair and occasionally issue an order. This is a real-time simu- 
lation, and speed is essential. Though the Cytrons act on their own, they 
do so in a thoroughly mindless way, without any thought of tactical ne- 
cessities. You command them either individually or by relaying orders 
through the commanders. The manual strongly advises against using too 
much individual control. It is much faster to organize attack groups effi- 
ciently — perhaps a phalanx of mines, followed by a phalanx of bunkers, 
then some shooters and a commander — and relay orders. The manager 
who reacts to situations before they become crises will be victorious. 

Because Cytrons are rather easy to destroy, they have to be replaced 
from time to time. The number of power centers you hold determines 
how fast you can build replacements, so it is a good idea to capture the 
enemy's power centers and to defend your own properly. You can place 
newly created units anywhere on your half of the field, so it is a good idea 
to position the locator once and place the Cytrons in groups. This is also 
a time saver compared to individual placement. 

Your last option is to use missiles. These are nonstandard Cytrons 
that you guide with the paddle. When a missile is launched, all other ac- 
tivity on the field stops. The other player can launch antimissiles by way 
of defense. Whenever a missile explodes, the Cytrons immediately 
around it are automatically destroyed, whether friend or foe. These are 
powerful weapons, but must be used sparingly, as they take a lot of 
power. 

Dan Bunten has made sure that Cytron Masters is easy to learn by 
providing a brief but complete manual. There is also a superb tutorial 
program that interactively explains how to play the game, providing 
practice with the menus as it explains each option and letting you prac- 
tice with the missiles, which take arcadelike coordination to operate. 

Cytron Masters gets a high rating in playability, intelligence, and ex- 
citement. DD

Snooper Troops: The Granite Point Ghost. By Tom Snyder. When mi- 
crocomputers began, the people who bought them were mostly pro- 
grammers either by profession or by hobby. Naturally, many among 
them were science-fiction buffs, and certainly science followers. Early 
games tended to be set in space — or in medieval dungeons, the other fad 
of serious gamesters. 

Now the microcomputer has spread to encompass all sorts of peo- 
ple; there is no one who cannot find good use for a computer. And the 
spread of the micro's popularity is testified to by a newcomer to the gam- 
ing field, the mark of popular appeal that spans all walks of life: the 
mystery. 



The second major entry into the mystery field for micros comes from 
a brand-new company called Spinnaker, and — now, adult gamers, don't 
quit reading — it comes in the form of an educational game. The Granite 
Point Ghost. It is intended to be the first of a line of mystery games in 
which the solvers are called the Snooper Troops. 

Although the Snooper Troops format is definitely educational and 
worthy of a place in every fourth-grade through eighth-grade classroom, 
it's also great fun. Guaranteed, parents who buy Snooper Troops for 
their kids will burn the midnight oil solving it after the kids are bedded 
down. And, unlike so many educational programs, the kids won't need 
encouraging to play it during the day. 

Snooper Troops is a mystery in hi-res color. It takes place in the tiny 
town of Granite Point, Wherever, which you must map. As a member of 
the Snooper Troops, you get to drive around town in your Snoopmo- 
bile, getting statements from suspects, making phone calls (from booths) 
to informers or to the infamous Mr. X, and even snooping in — that is, 
searching — the suspects' homes when they're away. 

The mystery is more structured than it would be for general adult 
use. Each suspect has three clues to give; each home yields three more 
clues when searched; and each phone contact (other than Mr. X) has 
three clues to give. In addition, there are special message clues you get at 
Snooper Troop headquarters through the computer Snoopnet; often you 
must hurry back to get them before they go off the air. And there are 
clues Mr. X will give you if you call him at the number he gives on the 
precise day he says. The clues are numbered, and you must keep track of 
each with its number. 

Besides the general learning involved in deductive reasoning and or- 
ganizing how to go about solving the mystery, several touches add to the 
educational value of Snooper Troops. To extract information from the 
phone contacts, you must suggest subjects to them; you're given three 
words for each suspect, but you may not use the exact word you've been 
given. You must give another word that hints to the informer what 
you're looking for. Only when you fmd the correct related word will you 
get the real clue. Other information and other clues help direct you to

the correct word if you have trouble. 

Searching the houses is a whole game in itself. The houses are as- 
sumed to be dark when you search them, and you have a flashlight. But 
if someone is home or arrives home and you use the flashlight, you'll be 
caught. When you enter the house, the screen shows the layout of the 
house only in walls; the locations of clues are shown by question marks. 
You must move to a question mark and take a picture with your Snoopv 
matic camera, then get out without being caught. The only harm in be- 
ing caught is having to start that search over again — which means wait- 
ing again for the day of the week that suspect is apt to be out. 

There are many homes in Granite Point but only eight house sus- 
pects. It is fun that you can search the other homes as well, if you like. In- 
stead of finding evidence such as ticket stubs or important papers, you 
catch photos of such things as "a box of corn flakes and a bunch of 
bananas." 

When you believe you know who is making all the mischief — haunt- 
ing an old mansion to scare the new owners away — you can make an 
accusation. Then you'll find that you have to eliminate every other sus- 
pect by identifying the clue that exonerates each. Then you must name 
the means and motive of the guilty party. No cinch, but educationally 
thorough and thoroughly fun. 

Incidentally, drive carefully. If you don't, you and the Snoopmobile 
may end up spending time in the tow yard. 

Snooper Troops is a breakthrough in educational programming: it is 
enjoyable, colorful, of trade quality, and an excellent educational tool.

When you first boot the disk you will see four program options, each 
a separate function that a VisiCalc user might need. The first option is 
Label Splitter. With this option you can take any label column in a Visi- 
Calc file and convert it to any number of columns, giving them any col- 
umn width larger than two. This can be a godsend for anyone who wants 
to set up a model with a lot of text and doesn't want to go through the 
hassle of entering the text into each individual cell. In VisiCalc, you en- 
ter your text into the cells in one column, entering each row of text into a 
single cell. Then you run the Label Splitter option and it automatically 
splits your text into individual cells. You even have the option of having 
the text split into noncontiguous cells (that is, putting it into columns A, 
C, F, and AA). 

Formula Reader is the second option. It allows you to see any or all 
of the formulas, numbers, and labels in a specified VisiCalc file dis- 
played on a monitor or printed on a printer. If you have ever tried to fig- 
ure out what you were doing in a VisiCalc file and had problems be- 
cause you could only see the formula or expression in one cell at a time, 
you have been waiting for this option. Print a hard copy, showing cell lo- 
cation with the formulas, values, and labels, and then go back to your 
VisiCalc model and you will find it much easier to untangle your model. 
Unhappily, this doesn't prevent you from tangling it in the first place! 

Print File Reader does exactly what the name implies. It also permits 
you to look at or print any "print to disk" file. Some people might use 
this option fairly often, but most probably won't, because if you are 
printing a file to disk you will probably be loading it into another pro- 
gram anyway. If you have forgotten what files are on a disk, you can use 
this option to see what your files are. You could also use this option to 
examine any files you made with the Variable Width Reader option. 

This may be the most useful option. You can selectively prepare a re- 
port format that allows you to specify which columns you desire print- 
ed, as well as individual column widths for those columns you print. Once 
you have developed a format, you can save it to disk and use it the next 
time you want to print the same report. This handles one of the most 
glaring limitations of VisiCalc — lack of individual column widths and 
the ability to print selected columns. You could, for example, print col- 
umns A, B, G, and R, each with an individual column width. Unhappi- 
ly, it won't let you specify the order of the columns to be printed. It 
would be nice to print G before column A sometimes. As with the other 
options, you have the choice of printing your report on a printer or dis- 
playing it on the monitor. It will even give you the option of entering and 
changing a report heading. 

One thing about the operation of this program is very inconvenient. 
If you are using more than one of the options in succession, you con- 
stantly have to change from the program disk to your data disk and 
back. It would be nice if it allowed you the option of putting the data 
disk in drive two and leaving the program disk in drive one.

Marauder. By Rorke Weigandt and Eric Hammond. Decades back, 
science fiction was about rocketing heroes shooting their way through 
the cosmos. Technology was seen as a triumphant solution to all man's 
ills and a great way to get around the galaxy. 

A lot of those early science-fiction notions are dated now, even 
quaint. So how come everybody still wants to be rocketing heroes shoot- 
ing their way through the cosmos? 

Some things never change. And space shoot-'em-ups like Marauder 
continue to have that never-changing appeal. 

There are two scenarios to Marauder; two completely different 
games that are thematically linked. The first scenario pits you against a 
city defending itself. You are the rocket invader trying to crack the city's 
defense shield and knock out their guns. They are hurling indestructible 
fireballs, magnetic air mines, and squiggling missiles at you. They also 
have two to four piercing lasers that cordon off your sky — sort of a 
booby-trapped Fourth of July. 

The object of your mission is to poke enough holes in their shields to 
be able to knock out their defenses. Shut them down completely and you 
can dive right into the second scenario. Easy enough on the first level of 



SEPTEMBER 1982

difficulty, but there are nine total and that ninth one is a doozy. Crack- 
ing the hide on that shield and dodging the fireworks at the same time is 
a real skill tester. 

Your rocket drops you off at the maze entrance to the second 
scenario. You get an overhead view of yourself doing a fast clip through 
a labyrinth full of enemy aliens that only appear when you get too close. 
They'd just as soon kill you as look at you, and that's not so bad. Some- 
times just their looks can kill. The corridors of the mazes are wide 
enough for you to dart around and avoid the tracks of their bullets. 

The object is to get to the bottom maze where the power center is lo- 
cated. Score a direct hit on the glowing fireball and the roof caves in. The 
maze starts to fill up with tiny squares and you have just enough time to 
high-tail your way back out. 

You have a choice of playing the two scenarios separately or sequen- 
tially on either keyboard or joystick. 

And in the future, when you get called up to be a rocketing hero 
shooting your way through the cosmos, tell them you cut your teeth 
playing Marauder. Somebody will understand. HP

Personal Inventory. By Gaynor C. Benson. Database management sys- 
tems have been the subject of a lot of discussion lately because of their 
ability to organize and relate many subjects. A full DBMS can be viewed 
as a higher-than-high-level language whose variables are entire collec- 
tions of data and whose commands allow powerful associations to be 
made between different collections. 

Unfortunately, to make use of most database management systems, 
some training in database concepts and organization is required. Many 
people probably fail to use this tool simply because they are unsure how 
it is used or how it can be used in their particular application. 

Personal Inventory is not a DBMS; instead, it is a set of customized 
file managers for recording and relating information in seven specific 
subjects (magazines, technical subjects, books, computer programs, 
house items, jewelry, and tools). The advantage of this approach to man- 
aging data is that the work of setting up the database is already done. 
This is convenient and eliminates the need for previous database experi- 
ence. However, this is not the program to use if the information to be 
stored and related is not included in the list of seven subjects or if any- 
thing other than simple searches on the subject is needed. 

The list of subjects seems just right for the novice home user, some- 
one trying to find uses for their new computer, and this is probably the 
market for which this product was designed. 

To use Personal Inventory, you must select a subject and set up a disk 
for that specific subject. The program has a built-in routine to initialize 
new disks; the process is simple and self-explanatory. Once the disk is 
prepared, all operations are selected from a menu, which provides for en- 
tering or editing data and printing or displaying all or part of this data. 

A nine-page manual covers all operations; it does a good job of lead- 
ing the novice user through the steps necessary to begin a new subject 
disk and enter or retrieve data. A nice feature is that the program stores 
entered data immediately on disk, so power failures and other problems 
can't destroy your data. And if you make a mistake, it's simple to edit 
any data item. 

Personal Inventory takes advantage of a second disk drive but doesn't 
require it. With a printer, you can make hard copy lists. )RH

prises (Box 62366, Sunnyvale, CA 94088). Backup disk included. $59.95. 

Phaser Fire. By Salt City Software. The latest in a slew of new offerings 
from Gebelli, Phaser Fire is a masterful graphics display in search of a 
gripping game. 

The player controls a ship at the bottom of the screen. The mission is 
to defend the Star Portal and prevent any of the enemy from slipping 
past. The enemy comes in the form of waves of bombers that either drop 
bombs or launch rockets at you. While the rockets are indestructible and 
must be avoided at all costs, the bombs float gently downward and can 
be detonated with a blast from your phasers. The bombers, of course, are 
eminently mortal. 

Once all the bombers in the initial wave have been obliterated, as in- 
dicated on a monitor in the upper left corner of the screen, you must then 
enter the Star Portal and try to pass through. This involves guiding your 



ship down a long, narrow tunnel which has broken lines every so often. 
You must pass through the gaps in the lines while avoiding a sentry that 
zips along these hnes, trashing anything in its path. Successful naviga- 
tion of the portal brings you to a new, faster, and larger wave of bomb- 
ers bent on your destruction. Et cetera, ad nauseum. The only variation is 
that after the first wave, rocket-launching saucers appear and either dash 
across the screen or actually descend and pursue you. The pursuit in- 
volves landing and then scooting at you. There is a way to avoid de- 
struction at the hands of an earthbound saucer, but Gebelli won't tell 
and neither will we. 

Unfortunately, that's all there is to Phaser Fire. The 3-D effect of the 
graphics is wonderful, the animation smooth and flickerfree, and all is 
quite colorful. But we've seen this before; bits and pieces from a number 
of different games all appear here in a game that is all reflex and no 
strategy. A good show for the coin-op, hand-eye coordination crowd, 
but not much her for the thoughtful gamer. DA

Wordrace. By Paul Coletta. Wordrace is a demanding educational game 
that will tax your vocabulary to the limit. It can make use of a Votrax 
speech synthesizer. 

A word and six possible definitions appear on the screen simultane- 
ously as the countdown begins. You know the word! You scan the list 
frantically to find the corresponding definition. (Why is it you can al- 
ways find the definifion immediately when it's your opponent's turn?) F! 
It's definition F. You make a wild stab at the keyboard with your fore- 
finger; to heck with touch-typing. You got 438 points out of 600. Where 
did all the fime go? 

Your opponent has bigger problems. She doesn't know the word. 
She's guessing, but if she guesses wrong, she loses points. F again. She 
lucks out: 500 points! 

Wordrace offers three levels of play. There's a beginner's game: a 
fourth grade finalist in a spelling bee should know 50 percent of the 
words. There's a regular game: the average college student should know

Real Estate Analyzer II. By James E. Howard. Designed to perform de- 
tailed cash flow and return-on-investment analysis, with an eye toward 
making the maximum profit possible consistent with the minimum ex- 
posure to loss. Real Estate Analyzer II attempts to point out those in- 
vestments that will use the least cash possible while maximizing the use of 
appropriate legal and tax strategies. It does not do this in an automatic, 
push-button manner; rather, it is a powerful tool that helps you to ar- 
range logically the large amounts of givens and variables present in any 
real-estate transaction into a manageable format. This lays the founda- 
tion upon which to perform the many "what if?" calculations necessary to 
determine what best fits your personal investment objectives. 

The program not only points you toward a better path but also gives 
you a valuable education in the logic of real-estate investment. Quite a 
deal for the money, and some or all of the purchase price is tax-deduct- 
ible, depending on your personal tax standing. 

The program's two strongest features are its ability to compare two 
or more dissimilar properties and to forecast the net return on your in- 
vestment. It can also target the point at which an investment changes 
from excellent to average. 

With the documentation under your belt, the program is very easy to 



use, and the documentation is extremely helpful. 

Howardsoft supports this program well. All registered owners are 
notified of any updates or upgrades. New versions, such as might occur 
because of a major change in the tax laws, are made available at a frac- 
tion of the purchase price with the return of your original disk. 

This is a professionally written piece of software designed for profes- 
sionals. But anyone interested in buying investment property today 
would benefit from a package such as this one. RiR

Quadrant 6112. By Justin and Amanda Fisher. At the controls of a 
small scout ship equipped with lasers and three heat-seekers, you must 
defend your quadrant against a seemingly endless onslaught of aliens. 
Sound familiar? 

Quadrant 6112 does, in faa, add a few twists to the traditional alien 
shoot-'em-up, and therein lies its saving grace. You must think as well as 
react in this game. 

From Sensible Software, better known for their Apple utility pro- 
grams. Quadrant 611 2 is an arcade game of deceptive simplicity. You pa- 
trol a quadrant surrounded by an impenetrable force field, on the look- 
out for invading aliens. The aliens sneak into the quadrant via two star 
gates, which are squares in the middle of the area you are patrolling. You 
cannot shoot into or enter the two star gates, yet you will see the aliens 
appear there before they enter normal space and try to demolish you. 
There are four distinct types of alien ships, along with the occasional ap- 
pearance of an exceedingly lethal alien commander. 

You must try to eliminate all the aliens by means of the two weap- 
ons at your disposal — lasers and heat-seekers. The lasers fire at the push 
of paddle button 0^ and you are equipped with an unlimited supply of 
energy. The heat-seekers will destroy everything in normal space, which 
means on the screen but not within the two star gates, at the touch of the 
space bar. However, you have only three such devices and no means by 
which to replenish your supply. 

The aliens come at you in waves. At first they merely try to collide 
with you, and you can take your time shooting them as long as you avoid 
their erratic movements. By the second wave, however, they begin shoot- 
ing back, and each new type of alien is a better shot than its predeces- 
sors. Finally, the alien commander shows up, near the end of each wave, 
and he's out to dispatch you in very short order — unless, of course, you 
get him first using your heat-seekers or ridiculously fast reflexes. The 
commander rarely misses both shots and collision attempts. 

Your mission involves more than just shooting aliens, though. You 
must also patrol the quadrant. This involves traveling the perimeter and 
completing laps, for which you receive bonus points that are tallied at the 
end of each wave of aliens, or posthumously. In order to earn any ships 
beyond your initial three, you must destroy all four waves of aliens and 
have completed at least one lap per wave. 

Between completing laps, outmaneuvering the aliens, avoiding the 
commander, choosing when to use heat-seekers, and keeping your ship 
under control, Quadrant 6112 keeps you on your toes. It is not an easy 
game in which to rack up points, and the action can be blindingly swift. 
Its only discernible weakness is ho-hum graphics. Due to the size of the 
various objects, however, it's a weakness that is understandable and easi- 
ly forgiven. The speed and excitement of the game more than make up 
for the lack of graphic sophistication. Anyway, most of the time you're 
too busy to notice. DA

Prom-It EPROM Development System. The Prom-It EPROM Devel- 
opment System from MPC Peripherals Corporation includes a powerful 
programming board that doubles as a PROM expansion board. Person- 
ality modules allow the Prom-It to work with a large variety of devices. 
Completing the system is an easy-to-use, menu-driven program that con- 
trols all aspects of the EPROM programming process. 

The Prom-It circuit card contains two dip switches and one lever

2516/2716 (2K byte PROMs), and one each for 2532 and 2732(4K byte 
PROMS). The Prom-It only programs single-supply (5 volt) EPROMs. 

From the main menu you can initiate any of the operations by enter- 
ing the number that appears in front of it. Selecting option 1 causes a 
complete check of the EPROM to see if it is blank. Option 2 causes the 
contents of the EPROM to be checked against the data present in the 
RAM buffer (the exact location and length of this buffer are set from op- 
tion 8). Actual EPROM programming occurs within option 3. A run- 
ning indicator shows during programming so you know the program is 
working. 

The next four options deal with transferring data to and from the 
temporary RAM buffer. This is the area of RAM that must contain an 
exact image of the data to be burned into the EPROM. 

Option 8 sets all the parameters necessary for the rest of the system. 
The buffer RAM starting and ending addresses are defined here. Also, 
the EPROM start address is determined; this can be specified by either 
an absolute address in the range $C800-$D7FF or by a relative offset 
from the start of the EPROM ($0000-$OFFF). 

After performing any option, you're returned to the main menu. This 
simple command structure is easy to use and fairly bomb-proof. 

In addition to being a powerful and versatile EPROM programmer, 
the Prom-It is a very useful software and hardware development tool 
due, in part, to a hardware decoding scheme that maps the first 256 bytes 
of the EPROM ($C800-$C8FF) into the SCnOO peripheral I/O space. 
This is a common technique used on many boards to interface through 
the Apple's built-in Basic I/O commands. When designing firmware for 
your own peripheral card, you can use the Prom-It's mapping scheme to 
emulate the finished board. Of course, the necessary hardware mapping 
circuit must be duplicated on your board. 

All in all, the Prom-It EPROM Development System is a fine prod- 
uct. The documentation consists of a thirty-page manual that's fairly 
complete and simple. Considering the nature of the product and its prob- 
able users, this is more than adequate. )M

Queen of Phobos. By Paul Berker and Bill Crawford. Queen of Phobos 
is a unique animal. It's a hi-res adventure, but the graphics — unusual, 
well-done line drawings, not color — are used for a scenario that would 
do fine as a text adventure, and not for their own sake. Indeed, if the 
graphics were the only draw for Queen of Phobos, you wouldn't be read- 
ing about it in these pages. 

The Queen of Phobos is a space wreck: the hulk of a huge passenger 
transport abandoned in space. It's said that a very valuable enchanted 
mask was left on the wreck and your people have sent you after it. 

Unfortunately, other people have similar ideas; you are not alone on 
the ship. The other pursuers of the mask, called looters (what, then, is 
our hero?), are apparently stymied and hang around just hoping some- 
one like you will do the job so they can steal the mask. One of them 
blows up your transport ship soon after you come on board, which is in- 
tended to be a sufficient excuse for you to do them all in. 

A whimsical touch is in the identities of the characters and the idio- 
syncratic susceptibility — or lack of it — they have to the weapons you find 
about the ship. In any case, you must find the ways to do them in before 
you can get away with the mask. Save often. 

There is a giant maze of triangular staterooms that is enough to dis- 
courage the hardiest adventurer. The answer? Ignore them. Don't bother 
with the staterooms. Ain't no action there anyway. Investigate all the rest 
of the ship and solve the problems you're confronted with there. The 
staterooms will take care of themselves. 

Occasionally, a sequence is animated — quite well and without dis- 
rupting the generally static humor of the graphics. 

No object in Queen of Phobos is not useful, although some jobs can 
be done by any of two or three objects. The puzzles are generally logical 
although few are complex — which doesn't mean they're easy. There are a 
couple of places that seem like dead ends. Do something else for a while; 
when you return, the solution may just come to you. 

Queen of Phobos offers several evenings of pleasurable, if frustrating, 
diversion for the adventurer. flCT

The Magic Keyboard. By Phil Wershba. Have you ever wondered why 

the keys on the Apple, as well as most typewriters, are laid out the way 
they are? This layout is commonly referred to as the QWERTY key- 
board, after the beginning of the typewriter's top row of letters. Bebeve it 
or not, this configuration was actually designed to slow down the typ- 
ist — thus reducing jamming of the keys on early typewriters. Despite at 
least forty years of technology rendering it unnecessary, the QWERTY 
design remains the standard. 

Like many outdated standards, the QWERTY keyboard won't be re- 
placed easily, if ever completely. Several more efficient designs are sur- 
facing, however. Making a strong bid for popular acceptance is the 
Dvorak keyboard; it's been proven to increase typing speed dramatical- 
ly. Touch-typing is much easier for beginners to learn on this key- 
board because letters are placed more logically; the vowels, for example, 
are all in the home row of the left hand. With the possibility of such a 
layout someday becoming the new standard, it's fun to find that you can 
have it on your Apple today — with the abihty to toggle back to 
QWERTY in an instant. 

There are several devices available for the Apple that allow you to 
redefine the keyboard, but only the Magic Keyboard gives three different 
layouts at the flick of a switch. 

The Magic Keyboard comes with a selection of seven standard key- 
boards and eight possible numeric keypad configurations. (Only two of 
each set are available at a time.) This selection is accomplished by setting 
six dip switches on the main board. 

Some of the alternate arrangements available with the Magic 
Keyboard include the Dvorak and the American Simplified keyboard. 
Another set puts the keys in alphabetical order across the keyboard. 
There are even two layouts optimized for one-handed operation, and 
there are three sets of colored key cap decals to indicate the keys' new 
functions. 

Among the keypad arrangements available, there is one especially de- 
signed for hex. Sixteen keys in rows of four allow numbers 0 through F. 
Installation of the Magic Keyboard requires some disassembly of the 



computer, but this is adequately outlined in an eight-page manual. Sev- 
eral photographs help illustrate how this piggyback module is inserted 
between the keyboard connector and its corresponding socket on the 
motherboard. Another flat cable connects the module to a special switch 
unit. This unit is affixed on the computer just to the right of the reset 
and return keys with double-stick foam. The switch unit contains 
one slide switch, a momentary push button, and a small LED indicator. 
The slide switch selects between the normal Apple QWERTY keyboard 
and one alternate layout. Momentarily pressing the other button causes 
the keyboard to take on one of the numeric keypad arrangements. The 
red LED also lights to indicate this function. 

The keyboard mapping is accomplished in an EPROM so you can 
design your own layout if you have access to an EPROM programmer. 
The company will also provide this service for $20 per keyboard. The 
standard unit does not provide control characters with the alternate key- 
board; this can be accomplished, however, by making a small modifica- 
tion to the Magic Keyboard. Two wires are added which must be con- 
nected to the Apple keyboard. This also makes it possible to have true 
upper and lower case entry using the shift key. The only trade-off for 
this function is that it reduces the number of alternate keyboards that can 
be contained in PROM down to three. 

The Magic Keyboard is a handy device for anyone who needs to re- 
define the layout of the Apple keyboard. The numeric keypad function is 
not as smooth as an external unit, but it costs less and remains attached 
to the computer. Since many people will only require one alternate set, 
the full keyboard modification may give an added bonus of true shift key 
operation. 

The sixteen-key hex keypad arrangement is a joy for machine lan- 
guage programmers. Itl

about the one who went to market, the second who stayed home, the 
third who had roast beef, and so on? 

And certainly no one can forget those immortal stars. Miss Piggy, 
Porky Pig, and Arnold Ziffle (the last two retired and living off their re- 
siduals). These are the glamour pigs: they've shed their mud packs to find 
fame and fortune; raised themselves out of the mire; no longer driven to 
the stockyards, but to and from the studios. 

Pigs don't live in styes, nor do they appreciate the fact that twisted 
American entrepreneurial minds turned their bathing habits into the 
commercialized sport of mud wrestling. Those squeahng little hocks o' 
ham are furious! They're out to get anyone trespassing on their turf. So 
pull up your suspenders and get ready for a real run around the Pig Pen. 

The game's author has equipped the program to be played with ei- 
ther a joystick or keyboard. In the keyboard mode, you select the keys 
for directional movement prior to the start of each game. 

Play b^ins with a skinny little man running around a maze inside a 
pigpen, leaving behind him a trail of white dots, accumulating points as 
he tries to lure the little fatties in the vicinity of those ever-menacing 
"power dots." With the little man in full power, the roles reverse, how- 
ever. The sows become elusive ghostly pig-heads, scampering off in dif- 
ferent directions while the little man gives chase. 

Take heed. These piqued porkers are not to be outdone! Frequently, 
they ride piggyback on one another hoping to confuse the player. And 
both opponents have the advantage of escapeways as each maze changes. 
More often than not, these swine use the escapeways as a strategic 
distraction. 

After playing Pig Pen several times, you devise your own strategies 
against those chubby little mucksters, one of whom can incorporate the 
trail of dots left behind as you make your way through the maze. Run- 
ning back over the established trail allows you to escape more rapidly. 
Therefore, it may be advantageous to secure a trail all the way around 
the maze to ensure a quick exit from the pursuing piglets. 

The most excitement in these maze games comes from being able to 
outmaneuver opponents and still maintain the calm determination re- 
quired to move from one screen to the next. Pig Pen provides the chal- 
lenges; you provide the spirited competition. 

Oh yes, don't forget the ear of corn that pops up during the game. 
It's worth a thousand points on your score. You can't miss it. It looks 
like an old-fashioned broadcast microphone. '>HP

Performer Printer Format Board. If you have an Epson printer con- 
nected to your Apple II, then you may be interested in a new board 
called the Performer. This board is like a "plug-in program," and it en- 
hances text and graphics capabilities. Though similar to software prod- 
ucts, the key to this program is that it is contained in EPROM. This 
means that it does not have to be loaded into memory from disk. In- 
stead, the program can be instantly run with just a few keystrokes. Once 
initialized, the driver routines remain "connected" and can be activated 
at any time. 

As soon as you call your Performer, you'll see a menu from which 
you can set seventeen parameters that will affect the printed output. For 
example, you can select normal, italic, expanded, compressed, or en- 
hanced printing — and various combinations. The number of lines per 
inch, columns per line, lines per page, and total page length can also be 
changed. Page numbering, titling, and dating are options as are video on- 
off, primary-secondary page select, and normal-inverse graphics. 

When you escape back to the operating system, the firmware is still 
connected through the output hook, although the system will appear to 
operate normally. You can then toggle the printer or dump the text screen 
or graphics screen immediately. Another toggle takes you back to the 
menu. Unfortunately, all commands must be entered while in the im- 
mediate mode. No information is given on how to change parameters 
from within a program, although this should certainly be possible. 

The Performer is designed to work with the TYMAC PPC-100 paral- 
lel printer card, which Micro- Ware also distributes. It should also func- 
tion, to varying degrees, with other interface cards. Probably the most 
outstanding feature is its low cost, which is not much more than similar 



programs that require loading from disk. 

The Performer should make a welcome addition to any Apple-Ep- 
son system that still has at least one empty slot. WhUe not as elegant as 
some of the newer, full-featured printer interface cards, the Performer 
represents a reasonable alternative for people who already have a printer 
card. Versions are also available for other graphics printers. in

Mouskattack. By John Harris and Ken Williams. Remember thos 
three blind mice that got their tails cut off with a carving knife? Well, 
they've returned to get their revenge in this enjoyably frustrating new 
game from the author of Jawbreaker. And a ravenous rodent called Su- 
per Rat keeps helping them out. 

Mouskattack is a maze game in which you lay pipe through the cor- 
ridors as you travel. Sometimes you have to go back over a section 
you've completed to make a connection you missed. Two cats and one 
rat trap at a time are available to you. Picking up a kitty and placing it 
where you don't want the rodents to come keeps them away. You can 
also pick up the traps and set them where you want. If you run over a 
trap with a mouse in it, he's a goner; otherwise he's eventually able to 
wriggle free. 

Sometimes the mice have too much freedom. When you exit the 
maze at any of four points, the mice can chase you off the screen and nip 
you in the wrenches before you get back. These are also fast mice. Each 
time they bop you, it's back to square one, next round (there are three 
per game), and it's excruciating if you've almost got all your pipe laid 
down. That's why it's called the rat race. 

You'll want to get plenty of sleep before you play Mouskattack. If 
you stop at any point in the maze — hoping you can nap with a kitty for a 
while — the magnetically inclined mice will box you in until kitty goes 
kaput and you'll be a goner too. 

As to that big cheese. Super Rat, he's definitely a rodent to run 
from. The traps can hold him but cats are his culinary meow.

Peachy Writer. By Carl Rutledge. Have you ever looked at your Apple 
and thought, "I don't need a fancy word processor, but it would be nice 
if I could use this system as a typewriter once in a while"? If so (and if 
your system already includes a disk drive and a printer), this may be just 
the program you're looking for. 

It's a word processor reduced to the absolute minimum, with the em- 
phasis on ease of learning. The manual calls it a "text editor," but it's 
more than that. It includes a text editor, all right; but it also has disk 
management routines (store, retrieve, delete, and catalog), a printer for- 
matting menu, and a useful help file. Not bad for less than thirty dollars! 

Needless to say, it has some weaknesses — it's awkward to work with, 
it looks funny on the screen, and it prints very slowly; but "weakness" is 
relative. Compared to several systems that cost ten times as much, 
Peachy Writer is weak. But considered as an answer to the question, 
"What is the least that an intelligent, careful person could get by with, if 
he didn't have to use it very often?" Peachy Writer is a well-chosen set of 
compromises. 

The system's main problems derive from limitations of the Apple dis- 
play — the lack of lower-case characters, and the forty-character line 
length. Dr. Rutledge has provided some neat tricks for working around 
these limitations, but he couldn't get rid of them entirely. 

The lower-case problem is taken care of by having everything print in 
lower case, unless preceded by a slash mark (/). The solution to the forty- 
character line problem is similar — simple and effective, but somewhat 
odd-looking on the screen. If you set the system up for a line length of 
more than forty characters, each line will be folded in such a way that it 




ends on the right margin: thus if you set for a sixty-five character hne, 
each typed line would begin fifteen characters in from the left margin and 
extend for two lines on the screen, ending the second line at or before the 
right margin. Three different tab commands are available. 

The editing commands are the familiar Apple left and right arrows 
and escape-IJKM (or escape-ABCD), plus commands to examine, de- 
lete, insert, or modify selected lines. 

Finally, one quite sophisticated feature: the system supports a wide 
variety of printer control characters, embedded in the text. This includes 
both true control characters (which display as inverse, for editing) and es- 
cape sequences. 

In short. Peachy Writer is a simple but effective "text management 
system": a set of routines that manipulate the existing capabilities of your 
Apple in order to produce text, either on disk or on paper. It's not quite a 
"word processor," from the professional writer's point of view, but it's a 
handy tool for the nonspecialist who only occasionally wants to produce

Keno Master. By Ed Magnin. Keno Master comprises one and two 
player versions of the venerable game of keno, based on the rules of the 
game as it is played in the casinos of Las Vegas, Nevada. 

For those who might be unfamiliar with the game, keno is a bingo- 
type game in which eighty numbered balls are tumbled in a wire cage; 
twenty are then removed at random. Meanwhile, you choose up to fif- 
teen numbers on a playing card or, in this case, your display screen. The 
object is to preselect as many of the drawn numbers as possible. Victory 
results when you are correct in a qualifying percentage of your chosen 
numbers. For this you are paid according to a schedule that the com- 
puter displays for you on command. If you bet one dollar and chose ten 
numbers, you would be paid $180 if seven of your numbers appeared 
among the selected twenty. However, if only five of your picks are cor- 
rect, you receive only two dollars. 

This version of the game is clear and straightforward with on-disk, 
easy-to-follow instructions. In fact, it addresses its mathematical points so 
well that it could serve as an appealing method of introducing younger 
household members to some harder-to-teach mathematical concepts 
painlessly. For its price, this could be the educational software invest- 
ment of the year. 

The game keeps track of the amounts you have won and lost. It also 
has a provision to repeat your previous bet, for those who like to play a 
pattern of favorite numbers over and over without having to reenter the 
information each game. 

An inexpensive, fun game that clues you in on why the world has 
played keno in one version or another since 1530. RIR

Wine Cellar. By Bryan Ehlers. Apples have been from outer space to un- 
derwater, so it only seems natural that sooner or later they would appear 
underground — or at least as far below as your wine cellar. 

That's what this simple, easy-to-use database is for organizing the 
vintages and varietals of your wine collection. It can handle up to 372 
varieties of wine, each of which may be associated with as many as 
32,767 bottles of the stuff, or 2,730 cases. That's a lot of grape juice! 

More than just a dry Hsting, this inventory program uses symbols to 
designate availability, drinkability, and rating of your stock. It has a wild 
card capability that lets you list Zin for Zinfandel and still come up with 
all the information you need. You can also print out a copy of your cel- 
lar's contents on any eighty-column printer. 

Information can be entered for each particular wine under winery, 
varietal, vintage, region, number of bottles, month, year, price of pur- 
chase, and current value. There is also room for a personal comment on 
each one. 

One-key commands let you look at the scrolling contents of your cel- 
lar, drink those contents (actually, delete any bottles you have con- 
sumed), add or edit any information as the wines age, and gather overall 

statistics — like how many bottles of Pinot Noir you have left after that 
last soiree. 

Wine Cellar is a custom-tailored inventory program that can be used

MACHINE LANGUAGE SPEED 
WHERE IT COUNTS... 



IN YOUR PROGRAM! 



For the first time, Amper-Magic makes it easy for people who don't know 
machine language to use its power. Now you can attach slick, finished machine 
language routines directly to your Applesoft programs in seconds! And interface 
them by name, not address! And pass parameters directly, just like with Applesoft 
commands! 

You simply give each routine a name of your choice, perform the append 
procedure once, and the machine language becomes a permanent part of your 
BASIC program; no more separate BLOADing programs! (Of course, you can 
remove any subroutine if you want to.) 

Any number of relocatable machine language routines can be attached to an 
Applesoft program and then called by name. We supply over 20 machine language 
routines on the disk. You can enter more from magazines. And more library disks 
are in the works. Some routines on this disk are: 



Binary file info 
Delete array 
Disassemble memory 
Dump variables 
Find substring 
Get 2-byte values 
Gosub to variable 
Goto to variable 



Hex memory dump 
Input anything 
Move memory 
Multiple poke decimal

Print hex $ 
Print string 
Print w/o word break 



Remove characters 
Restore special data 
Search string array 
Speed up Applesoft 
Speed restore 
Store 2-byte values 
Swap variables 



These routines and more can be attached and accessed easily. For example, to 
allow typing of commas and colons in a response (not normally allowed in 
Applesoft), you simply attach the Input Anything routine and put this line in your 
program: 

XXX PRINT "PLEASE ENTER THE DATE. : & INPUT,DATE$

PACE. By Robert Stoldt. PACE stands for prompt, accurate cost es- 
timator, a flexible system that can produce custom-designed take-off 
sheets for a wide variety of business applications in almost any industry. 

The PACE system begins by giving you the third degree. You must 
tell it the cost items you use to produce your product, the standard unit 
of measure, the cost and source of each item, price volatility (so that the 
system will know how often to expect a price change, after which it will 
let you know if a price you are using might be outdated), your overhead, 
fixed costs, discounts on materials, volume discounts, labor costs, sub- 
contractor overrides, taxes, and any other cost that might be associated 
with the production of your goods and services. Thank goodness, you 
need input these things only once. 

The program is diverse in its scope and very usable. It produces what 
its title promises: prompt, accurate cost estimates. 

The documentation is well-organized and complete and gets you up 
and running in a hurry. High Technology offers a tdqjhone software hot- 
line to help with any technical questions that may arise. 

If the success of your jobs depends upon the ability to respond quick- 
ly and accurately to a call for bids and other price estimates, this pro-

The Flockland Island Crisis. By Kevin Bagley. And now, one of those 
golden classics from last June that will live in our hearts forever, and the 
winner of the Association for the Advancement of Questionable Taste in 
Computer Game Hype Creativity Award for 1982. O nostalgia. 

TTie recent emergence of the television docudrama caused a stir in 
some circles, with the charge made that the hybrid form provided nei- 
ther reliable fact nor edifying fiction. Such is the case here. As a game, 
Flockland Island is pretty limited; so is its value as a socio-historical curi- 



osity — ^the game has little to do with actual events. (The historical refer- 
ence for Choplifter is readily guessed from just looking at the screen; with 
Flockland, you'd never know.) 

This is the only game in recent memory that requires two players; 
the one-player mode is a thoroughly losing proposition, though the 
documentation doesn't address the subject either way. 

Enemy ships approach from either side of a long, skinny land mass 
and attempt to remove chunks of it while you attempt to manipulate 
your two mobile shore defense batteries to prevent them from doing so. 
The animation is of the can't-move-and-shoot-at-the-same-time variety, 
and with two players the frustration this situation evokes is heightened as 
the two of you attempt to execute five separate move-and-shoot com- 
mands simultaneously. 

The game's strongest points are its swift capitalization on current 
events and its propulsion of microcomputer games into some headlines.

games on one disk — for the price of one disk. 

Of course you're asking why they weren't released on four disks. 
Aren't they good enough? The answer is yes, yes, yes, and maybe. Per-

THE BASIC 



Solution 



Sequenfial text files are a very useful method of data storage if you 
can get around the idiosyncrasies of the input statement. 

We deal with text files through the DOS commands open, write, read, 
close, and a few others we won't discuss here, as well as through the Ba- 
sic commands input, print, and get. The last three are familiar to most Ba- 
sic programmers but will be used differently in this application. 

Enter program A. 

Lines 60 and 70 aeate and write to a text file called Test on your disk. 
Note when you run the program that none of the data in A$(X) prints 
out on your screen. That is because when write is in effect, print sends 
things to the disk instead. 

Program B uses the input statement to retrieve data from file Test. 

Now run this program. There is a problem, no? Only part of the ex- 
pected text file was printed out, along with some really unattractive "ex- 
tra ignored" messages. This is the fault of the input statement, which uses 
commas as separators for data. The same thing would have happened 
had this been a normal input statement, that is, one requesting data from 
the keyboard. If it only asks for one string and you include a comma, it 
takes your input as two strings and tells you "extra ignored." 

This is a problem in text-file input. The type of material you are like- 
ly to want in a text file will tend to contain commas (and colons, which 
will also cause an error). To get around this, we can use the get com- 
mand to take data from the file instead. Get is able to take any ASCII 
character as input — even commas, escapes, returns, and control charac- 
ters (but not reset) — without problems. So add program C to program B. 

To explain briefly, line 120 accepts characters from the file, one at a 
time. Line 140 builds the string and echoes it to the screen. Line 150 
checks for the ASCII value 13, which is given by the return key. This in- 
dicates the end of the line of data. 

Now change line 40 in program B to gosub 100. When you run this 
program, you'll find that it goes slower, but it returns all the data you put 
into the file. This is a preferable situation, but we can do better still. 

Shorter and Faster. There is a way to get the input statement to ac- 
cept commas and colons. You simply have to enclose the whole string in 
quotation marks. In normal input statements this solution is often ig- 

10 A$(1) = "FOUR SCORE AND SEVEN" 

20 A$(2) = "YEARS AGO, OUR FOREFATHERS" 

30 A$(3) = "BROUGHT FORTH ON THIS" 

40 A$(4) = "CONTINENT, A NEW NATION. . ." 

50 A$(5) = " —ABRAHAM LINCOLN" 

60 PRINT CHR$(4); "OPEN TEST" 

70 PRINT CHR$(4); "WRITE TEST" 

80 FOR X = 1 TO 5 

90 PRINT A$(X) 

100 NEXT X 

110 PRINT CHR$(4); "CLOSE TEST" 

Program A. A simple text file writer. 

10 PRINT CHR$(4); "OPEN TEST" 

20 PRINT CHR$(4); "READ TEST" 

30 FOR X = 1 TO 5 

40 INPUT A$: PRINT A$ 

50 NEXT X 

60 PRINT CHR$(4); "CLOSE TEST" 

70 END 

Program B. A reader of text files. 

100 REM INPUT ROUTINE 
110 A$ = " " 
120 GET 1$ 
130 I = ASC(I$) 

140 A$ = A$ + 1$; HTAB 1: PRINT A$; 
150 IF I = 13 THEN 170 
160 GOTO 120 
170 RETURN 

Program C. Input routine using get. 



ByWm.V R. Smith 



nored to avoid requiring the user to enter the extra punctuation. The 
computer, however, can put the quotation marks in easily. 

Go back to program A and change line 90 to print CHR$(34); AS; 
CHRS(34). The use of CHR$(34) is, of course, the only way to get the 
computer to print out the quotation mark. Run the program to re-create 
the file Test. Now, change line 40 in program B back to the way it was. 
You won't be using the input routine again, but you might want to keep 
it to experiment with. It won't harm the program, in any case. Now, when 
you run the newly restored program B, you will see that our data was re- 
trieved from the disk at a greatly augmented rate. 

This application has its uses for those who typed in BasiCalc from 
our July issue. That version of the program used a variation on the slow- 
moving get-type input routine for loading files from the disk. Changing 
the following two lines of the program should speed up your data read- 
ing a lot. 

5200 PRINT CHR$(34); A$(Y,X); CHR$(34) 
5630 INPUT A${Y,X) 

But That's Not All. Unfortunately, if you have already saved any 
spreadsheets the old way, these modifications will make the files incom- 
patible. Not an insurmountable problem: you can use BasiCalc to con- 
vert the file by the following method. 

1. Load the old BasiCalc pro-am. 

2. Type in the new line 5200. At this point leave 5630 as is. 

3. Run. 

4. Use the slash key to get the menu. Select the load option and type 
in your spreadsheet's file name. BasiCalc will load the file in the 
old method. Confirm that the file loaded as you expected it to, 
with everything intact. 

5. Now select the save option. As an extra precaution, use a differ- 
ent file name, so the old file won't be overwritten. BasiCalc will 
save the file using the new save routine, and your file will be com- 
patible with the faster loading method. 

You can convert any number of old files in this way. When you are 
finished, break out of BasiCalc and change line 5630. To be safe, save 
your new version of BasiCalc under a new file name too. 

And we have more good news for people who typed-in BasiCalc. 
Some of our readers have discovered bugs in the ampersand and at-sign 
options. As you recall, the ampersand key was supposed to do row or 
column summation. Unfortunately, it didn't work in summing rows. The 
at-sign key, which was supposed to clear an answer cell, didn't work at 
all. And finally, any entry or equation that resulted in the display of a 
negative noninteger (like -5.2) produced some very interesting results. 
Try it! Then correct it. Changing the following Unes will fix problems. 

640 SF$ = "": IF A1 < 0 THEN SF$ = "-" 

641 WA = ABS (A1):A3 = INT (WA):A1 = (WA - A3) + 
1.001:H$ = SF$ + STR$ (A3) + "." + MID$ ( STR$ (A1),3,2) 

660 FL$ = STR$ (A1):A1 = VAL ( LEFT$ (FL$,CW(X))): RETURN 
805 P=1 

2104 IF A=64 THEN 2256 
2109 IF A > 43 THEN 2255 

2256 AA$ = " ":IF A$ = CHR$(64) THEN 

A$(Y,X) = LEFT$(AA$,CW(X)): GOTO 2260 

Note that the string in 2256 is a number of spaces. This should be at 
least equal to the largest column width you might want to set. The de- 
fault width is eight, so you want at least eight spaces there. Many thanks 
to the readers who pointed out and corrected these errors. 

There is also good news for early BasiCalc disk purchasers. We have a 
new version that contains all the changes we just talked about. It also has 
a twelve-screen tutorial on how to use BasiCalc. So if you sent for our 
disk early, and your version doesn't have the tutorial, you can exchange it 
for one that does. Send no money, but you must return the old disk so 
that we know you paid for it in the first place. -!■

An Army helicopter lifts from the parking lot of an extremely rural 
U.S. Post Office and flies into hostile territory on a mission of mercy. On 
the ground below, enemy tanks fire futile volleys at the chopper as it 
moves toward its goal. Soon, it spots the captives, who signal it in des- 
peration. It lands, inadvertently crushing one of the erstwhile victims, 
and the survivors madly scramble aboard. A few must remain behind. 
Another tank arrives to harass the rescue operation, but the copter lifts in 
time, sprays the tank with explosive shells, and returns to friendly terri- 
tory, where the first batch of grateful beneficiaries disembark. A few turn 
back to wave to the hero, who is already off to give further succor to the 
remaining hostages. 

The Hi-Res Challenge. And all this action occurs on a computer 
screen. Who would have believed it in 1976? The minis and mainframes 
that were prevalent then — and the ones still used today by universities 
and corporate giants — while unquestionably faster and more powerful 
than today's ubiquitous micros, just don't lend themselves to this sort of 
use. Indeed, the easy access to high-resolution graphics was a major fac- 
tor in securing Apple's supremacy in the home computer market. It put 
the personal in personal computer and set standards that Atari and IBM 
are only beginning to challenge years after Apple's inception. 

Don't misunderstand: the graphics in this popular game were not 
easily achieved. The current standard for arcade games requires of the 
next crown prince of programming a complex understanding of 
assembly language, the hi-res memory layout, and bit-mapped graphics. 















146 



SEPTEMBER 1982 



However, this arcane knowledge is necessary only for the speed of 
animation an arcade game requires. The hi-res images — the colors and 
the detail — are within the grasp of any moderately competent Applesoft 
programmer who knows where to look. The uses of such visuals are as 
numerous as the individuals who would use them. If you have ever 
wanted to put more on the monitor than the few scant letters, numbers, 
and punctuation marks allowed by ASCII, read on! 

Unfortunately, Apple only went halfway in giving you these marvel- 
ous graphics techniques. They provided a means for reading hi-res 
shapes from a table and drawing them on the screen in various sizes, 
colors, and angles. Great! Only problem is, they barely provided any 
means at all for creating these shape tables. Nor did they provide any 
shapes with the machine, or even with the DOS System Master, which 
wouldn't have been difficult. The procedure for creating shape tables de- 
scribed in the Applesoft manual is, in its complexity of execution, not un- 
like writing Basic programs by entering the hexadecimal tokens for the 
keywords directly into the Monitor. Possibly worse. If you have already 
learned the method from the manual, forget it; there are better uses for 
your unique genius. If you haven't, don't bother; there are now several 
utilities available for this purpose. 

Inner Workings. By way of circumlocution, before we continue, 
here's a clear, but not very complete, description of how a shape table 
works. The table acts as a series of instructions, though it is actually 
closer to being a data table. Nevertheless, there are eight possible in- 
structions shape tables are allowed to contain. They are:

This assumes that the scale is one and the rotation is zero. At higher 
scales, plotting a point becomes drawing a line, but that is something you 
can discover on your own. Note you can only go in one of four direc- 
tions with a single instruction. To do a diagonal line or a curve, you have 
to mix directions. 

We're going to look at three of the available packages — AccuShapes, 
by Accent Software; Higher Graphics II, by Synergistic Software; and 
Apple Mechanic, by Beagle Bros — and discuss what makes a good shape 
utility as well. Consider what kinds of capabilities a really good shape 
utility should have. Pay attention, aspiring geniuses, because no pro- 
gram on the market is perfect. There may be room for one more shape 
utility if it's good enough (though that isn't a promise). 

You the Artist; Apple the Brush. A shape maker's primary function 
is to allow you to design shapes and use them in your programs. All of 
these programs do this, of course, but the different ways they do it are 
important. The easiest to write (but the hardest to use) will have you en- 
tering the shape point by point in the same sequence it will go into the 
table. This makes it hard to get the shape right in the first place, and even 
harder to correct one that's wrong. You will have to design any shape 
more complicated than a rectangle on graph paper first. Higher Graphics 
handles the shape generation phase in this way. 

Accu-Shapes has the best method of shape generation. You design 
the shape in low resolution and the program compiles the table 
semiautomatically. This means that you can guide it through the con- 
struction process without having to tell it every step, if you like. Creating 
the shape in lo-res introduces a unique problem: because the lo-res pixel 
is wider than it is tall, the shape looks taller than you expected when you 
draw it in hi-res. A ecu-Shapes allows you to correct this distortion easily 
with its powerful — and unequaled — shape-editing option. With a few 
quick keystrokes you can make the shape longer or shorter along any 
horizontal or vertical axis. 

Apple Mechanic handles shape design somewhat differently. You 
design the shape in hi-res, but you have a simultaneous display of the 
shape as it will look in normal scale and the shape in a triple scale, which 
makes it easy to keep track of the cursor and pay attention to detail. This 
also means no distortion problem. Unfortunately, while you can design 
the shape on the screen before telling the program the exact steps to use 
to draw it, the tracing procedure is entirely manual and so a little slower 
than with Accu-Shapes. 

To varying extents, all three programs allow you to look at old 
shapes while creating new ones. Higher Graphics allows you to see as 
many shapes as you want. The others only allow one other shape to be 
displayed at a time, but they also allow you to trace over all or part of that 
shape, an option that you may find more valuable. If, for instance, you 
wanted to create a hi-res chess set, you could trace over the base of the 
rook shape you already designed to save effort when designing the knight 
and bishop shapes. 

Diamonds Are a User's Best Friend. The keys used for cursor con- 
trol should ideally be placed in a usable diamond formation on the key- 
board. Accu-Shapes uses W, A, D, and X to move the cursor. These keys 
form a convenient pattern around the S key, which is used for scrolling 
the picture. In contrast, Higher Graphics uses U, D, L, and R, which by 
their scattered keyboard positions can slow down the design process a 
lot. Apple Mechanic uses the arrows and the A and Z keys, which may be 
the easiest configuration. 

Next, because a table can have more than one shape, there ought to 
be a way to rearrange the shapes in the table. Ideally, the first shape in 
the table should be the shape you use most often. If the most-used shape 
changes as you develop your program, you should be able to rearrange 
the table with as little fuss as possible. Flexibility is the key; a good shape 
maker won't punish you for changing your mind. 

Accu-Shapes allows you to do this by a complicated process of re- 
trieving a shape into a hold area, inserting it in the table where you want 
it, and deleting it from its original location. Higher Graphics, in this 
respect the best of the three, comes with a shape-shuffler program that al- 
lows you to set up tables by taking shapes from any number of other 
tables and putting them in any order you like. The only way that Apple 
Mechanic allows resequencing is through retracing a shape in a new loca- 



HTWEN'T YOU HEARD 
OF THUNDERCLOCK PLUS 7 





If you want to put 
yoiir Apple® to work — around the 
clock — Thunderclock Plus is the solution. Just plug it 
in and your programs can read the month, date, day of 
week and time — down to the second — in any of Apple's 
languages. So your Apple can do any number of tasks 
for you automatically. In the office, the lab or at home. 

Most good software packages for business, data base 
management, communications and time management 
are made to read Thunderclock Plus. (It's compatible 
with DB Master,* Micro- Courier** and VisiDex^, to 
name a few). So no matter how you use your Apple now, 
Thunderclock Plus can make it a more versatile 
and efficient tool. 

For example, with business or communi 
cations software, your Apple can auto- 
matically access a data base or send elec- 
tronic mail when the rates are lowest. 

In addition, Thunderclock Plus can 
organize your disk files. Our optional 
DOS-DATER™ software upgrades the 
regular DOS on your disks. So every 
time a program is saved or a file is modi- 
fied, the time and date, to the minute, 
are stored in the CATALOG with the file 
name. Now you can instantly know 
exactly when your files were last updated. 



Thunderclock Plus 
can even give you a sense of 
security. Or just make your life a little easier. With our 
X-10 interface option and a BSR X-10* Home Control 
System, your Apple can turn on your lights, water your 
lawn . . .whatever you desire, according to schedules you 
create. It comes with our menu-driven SCHEDULER 
software. So it's easy to design and modify schedules 
that can run in the "background" while you have 
"hands-on" use of your Apple. 

Thunderclock Plus comes with a one-year warranty. 
Powered by on-board batteries, it runs accurately for up 
to four years without battery replacement. 
So now that you've heard of Thunderclock Plus, isn't 
it time you put your Apple to work — 
around the clock? See your dealer 
for a demonstration or contact us.

tion. This is tedious and is an unfortunate deficiency in the program. 

You the Programmer. Furthermore, if we are to consider the pro- 
gram a utility at all, you have to be able to load your shapes easily from 
Basic. You don't want to have to jump back into the shape maker when- 
ever you want to use the shape. All of these programs save the table into 
a binary file and let you bload them and poke the table address into the 
pointers. On the surface, that would seem to make all of them equal. The 
fact is, loading a binary file is not a simple process for the beginner, so 
the explanation that the manual provides at this point should be clear 
and complete. 

In this respect. Higher Graphics strongly favors Integer Basic pro- 
grammers. Integer is a faster language than Applesoft, so wdth the hi-res 
routines that Higher Graphics provides, this package is probably better 
suited to animation if you have Integer. But more people use Applesoft, 
for good or ill, and the Higher Graphics manual fails to explain how to 
set the pointers to the shape table from Applesoft. 

The other two programs both ignore Integer Basic. Accu-Shapes ex- 
plains how to set the table pointers from the Monitor but refers you to 
the Applesoft manual for doing it from within a program. Apple 
Mechanic explains it all very well. In fact, though Bert Kersey's manual 
modestly claims, "Heck, I can't teach you everything" his manual with- 
out question comes the closest to doing so. It has by far the best docu- 
mentation of the three, explaining how to use shape tables in every con- 
ceivable detail. It is the easiest manual for a beginner to use, yet it con- 
tains information that an expert can benefit from. 

Each of the packages has other features and limitations that ought to 
be considered. Accu-Shapes has no other function but to create shapes, 
although it is definitely the best at that. It has an excellent shape-display 
method, showing up to fifteen shapes at a time with no overlap. By con- 
trast. Higher Graphics shows shapes either one at a time, with scale and 
rotadon options, or fifty at a fime, with no considerations to prevent 
large shapes from running over each other or off the screen. Apple 
Mechanic neatly displays the whole table of twelve shapes (the maximum 
it allows) on one screen with no overlap. 



All of the packages have a set of demonstration shapes. 

Higher Graphics has a screen-creator program, which allows you to 
use shapes and an Etch-a-Sketdi-type drawing routine using paddles or 
joystick. You can then save the screen to disk for use in your pro- 
grams — as a title page, for instance. 

Apple Mechanic comes with a plethora of other utilities, some re- 
lated to shapes and graphics and some not. One of these is a full-charac- 
ter font editor with a few example fonts for your use. These fonts con- 
tain much larger characters than those available with the DOS Tool Kit. 
There are also two programs provided that use these fonts. One is for 
creating hi-res pictures to store on disk, and the other is for merging with 
your programs to give them the same ability. There is also a facility for 
analyzing shape tables: viewing them at different scales, colors, and rota- 
tions and looking at disassemblies of tables. 

Apple Mechanic also contains the utility Byte Zap, which allows you 
to examine and alter any disk byte by byte. Although this is unrelated to 
shape tables, it has its uses. With it, you have access to parts of the disk 
that were previously closed to you. You can look at the catalog sectors, 
and even examine and change DOS commands and error messages. 

Parting Words to the Wise. None of these programs is perfect. All of 
them lacked two features that would be extremely useful. One is the 
capacity to manipulate and edit shape tables generated by other pro- 
grams. This wouldn't be too difficult a feature to incorporate, as a shape 
table can remain in memory even after the program that loaded it is 
gone. 

The other feature we looked for but didn't find was a facility for 
creating Applesoft subroutines to poke the table into memory rather 
than load it from disk. Aspiring shape maker programmers should try to 
include features like these.

The Schoolhouse Apple 



It's September — the beginning of a new 
school year. Fittingly, the September install- 
ment of Schoolhouse Apple marks the debut of 
an exciting new feature — James H. Muller's 
series of tutorials on the Logo programming 
language. 

This month's column also features news 
about a development that will have real impact 
on computer science education in the years 
ahead and more company capsules. 

So let's get started. 

Jumping the Gun. What will high school sen- 
iors be doing in May of 1984? If everything 
moves along as scheduled, twelfth-graders who 
have done the appropriate course work will be 
attempting to pass an advanced placement 
examination in computer science. Those who 
succeed will receive college credit for their work. 

Advanced placement examinations are not a 
new development. The College Board, the New 
York City-based organization that develops the 
tests, has offered AP exams in English, math, 
history, biology, chemistry, physics, and for- 
eign languages for the past twenty-five years — 
and in art and music for the past ten. But an A P 
exam for computer science is real news. Coming 
at a time when educators are concerned with es- 
tablishing standards for computer science in- 
struction, it's bound to affect what high school 
students learn about computers. 

Students who take AP examinations have 
usually prepared themselves by taking one or 
more special high school courses. These cours- 
es are designed to cover material outlined in a 
detailed course description issued by the Col- 
lege Board. 

Once the College Board decides to offer an 
AP test in a particular subject area, a commit- 
tee of educators begins the difficult task of de- 
termining what knowledge and skills the exami- 
nation should test — and what a course for 
teaching this material to high school students 
might look like. An important aspect of this 
process is determining what first-year courses at 
representative "target colleges" are like so that 
high schoolers really will be doing equivalent 
work. 

Harlan Hanson is the College Board's direc- 
tor of advanced placement tests. After discuss- 
ing the notion of a new mathematical sciences 
option with some colleagues, Hanson assem- 
bled a group of "curriculum coordinators" to 
assess the possibilities. 

The group was to consider whether to de- 
sign an AP course in linear algebra, probabil- 
ity/statistics, or computer science. The commit- 
tee strongly recommended computer science 
and gave reasons not to offer courses in the 
other two subjects. 



Bringing a small group of high school and 
college educators together under the chairman- 
ship of Professor Stephen Garland of Dart- 
mouth College, Hanson asked the educators to 
act as if they were a development committee 
and see how far they could get in developing a 
serious first-year college course. 

The formal course description is now near- 
ly ready and will be issued this fall. This means 
that courses to prepare students for the AP 
exam are likely to begin in the fall of 1983. Why 
the delay? Well, before the high school courses 
are taught, many teachers will be going back to 
school. 

The committee devising the AP course de- 
cided that students must know Pascal in order 
to pass the advanced placement test. The com- 
mittee's feeling is that Pascal is the only struc- 
tured language commonly available for testing 
students' programming methodology. This 
means that instructors who have been teaching 
their students Basic, Fortran, or some other 
programming language have busy times ahead. 

The College Board will be helping member 
schools set up Pascal institutes next summer. A 
mock course has already taken place at Carle- 
ton College in Northfield, Minnesota. 

Two possible approaches have been consid- 
ered. The first is to offer teachers an accelerated 
AP course of the type they will need to teach in 
order for their own students to pass the AP test. 
The second is to have an experienced advanced 
placement teacher come in and talk about what 
he or she teaches and why. Although the sec- 
ond approach would seem to be a valuable one, 
there may not be enough experienced advanced 
placement teachers who know Pascal to meet 
the demand. 

Harlan Hanson stresses that the advanced 
placement course and exam are not cast in 
stone. This is just meant to be a beginning, "an 
opening up of the machinery of the AP pro- 
gram to computer science." Although Pascal is 
the language of choice right now, it's possible 
that additional languages may be acceptable 
later on. 

The next step in the process is for mock 
examinations to be administered at cooperat- 
ing test-site colleges. This will enable the Col- 
lege Board to assess whether the kinds of test 
questions being asked are useful, representa- 
tive, fair, and appropriate when measured 
against what colleges are actually covering in a 
first-year course. In addition, there will be an- 
nual revisions to the exam based on feedback 
from colleagues. 

In a future column, we'll tell you about the 
computer science course description and about 
educators' reactions to it. 



More Software Sources. Now here's some 
background information on half a dozen com- 
panies that create educational materials for the 
Apple market. 

The Learning Company, 4370 Alpine Road, 
Portola Valley, CA 94025; (415) 851-3160. 

Founded earlier this year, the Learning 
Company develops educational software for use 
by children of ages three through thirteen. 
Rather than seeing the computer as a teaching 
tool that's best used for drill and practice, the 
Learning Company emphasizes the computer's 
potential as a tool to help children learn con- 
ceptual thinking. Suitable for use in home and 
school, the programs are interactive and use 
graphics and music to help retain learners' 
interest. 

According to Jack B. Smyth, president of 
the Learning Company, programs are designed 
to "expand a child's potential for creativity 
through logical thinking." Before release, pro- 
grams are tested in a variety of settings, includ- 
ing elementary and nursery schools, learning 
centers, museums, and homes. 

The company's products include Moptown

and Magic Spells, two programs from Ad- 
vanced Learning Technology and available 
through Apple's Special Delivery Software. 
These programs draw on the earlier work of 
Ann Piestrup, the educational psychologist who 
founded Advanced Learning Technology in 
1979. Kestrup is the Learning Company's 
founder and chairman of the board. 

Juggles' Rainbow, Bumble Games, and Bum- 
ble Plot are three programs of more recent vin- 
tage that relate to one another and are intended 
to be "building blocks" of learning that guide 
youngsters through progressively more dilRcult 
material as they are ready for it. Juggles' Rain- 
bow teaches children ages three through six the 
concepts left, right, up, and down, as well as in- 
troducing them to using the computer. In Bum- 
ble Games, children ages four through ten learn 
such things as how to understand charts and 
graphs, how to describe locations on a map, 
and how to do basic computer graphics. Bum- 
ble Plot, designed for learners ages eight to thir- 
teen, brings in positive and negative numbers 
and encourages learners to build on the infor- 
mation they acquired through playing Bumble 
Games. 

Mathware, 919 14th Street, Hermosa Beach, 
CA 90254; (213) 379-1570. 

This company gets its name from the Math- 
ware Basic Math System (reviewed in Softalk, 
May 1981), a five-disk system for teaching math 
skills to children in grades three through eight. 
Formerly a part of Math City, a math tutoring 
service based in Palos Verdes, California, Math- 
ware became a separate software development 
company in April of this year. 

Written by mathematician Bob Essertier, 
the Mathware system comes in both classroom 
and home versions. It can be set to varying lev- 
els of difficulty. In addition, the difficulty level 
changes within the lesson as learners demon- 
strate the ability to handle more challenging 
problems or the need for simpler ones. Topics 
include addition/subtraction, multipUca- 
tion/division, fractions, decimals, and ra- 
tios/percentages. 

Essertier especially enjoys developing CAI 
materials, but for the last year and a half, he 
and partner Tom Brock, a former secondary 
school principal, have been working on a com- 
prehensive administration package for schools. 
The system, now going through extensive test- 
ing at three school sites, requires a hard disk 
and can accept information from individual 
computer stations hooked up through the Om- 
ninet system or from a central computer. 

The three modules that have been created so 
far — Basic Data, Attendance, and Current 
Scheduling — all share the same data files, as will 
a fourth module. Future Scheduling. The sys- 
tem has been set up so that schools will be able 
to establish their own data fields. And, accord- 
ing to Essertier, they've paid special attention to 
the complicated legal requirements with regard 
to attendance. 

Reader's Digest Services, Pleasantville, NY 
10570; (914) 769-7000. 

Reader's Digest Services is the personal 
computer publishing division of the Reader's 



Digest Association. According to corporate and 
public affairs associate Bruce Trachtenberg, 
"Programs carrying the Reader's Digest logo 
will be as easy to use as possible," structured so 
that users don't have to spend a great deal of 
time learning to use them. The company's plan 
calls for documentation to be brief and clearly 
and simply written. 

Programs in the company's educational 
software series are known as Edu-Disks. The 
first one, released by the company earlier this 
year, is a mathematics assessment and rein- 
forcement package developed under contract by 
Cybertronics International (Morristown, New 
Jersey) for children in grades one through sev- 
en. It features pretesting and posttesting and 
specific exercises designed to improve learners' 
math skills. 

Two new Edu-Disks are scheduled for re- 
lease in late fall of this year. The first is Prob- 
lem-Solving Strategies, a program for learners 
ages ten and up that teaches logical thinking 
and decision making through programmed 
exercises in graphing, diagramming, and cre- 
ative number lines. The second package is the 
Vocabulary/ Language Arts series being de- 
veloped by Prentice Associates (Boston, Mas- 
sachusetts). The three animated word-game 
programs included here are designed to in- 
crease learners' vocabulary skills. 

Recently, Reader's Digest Services an- 
nounced the finalization of a two-year agree- 
ment with Apple Computer by which the Di- 
gest Company will develop and market Apple- 
compatible educational software. Apple will 
provide technical information, computer train- 
ing for Reader's Digest personnel, access to 
computers, and marketing support. 
Southwest EdPsych Services, Box 1870, Phoe- 
nix, AZ 85001; (602) 253-6528. 

The programs created by this eighteen- 
month-old company draw on the expertise of an 
educational psychologist, a programmer, and 
content experts in various subject areas. South- 
west EdPsych Services president Marley Wat- 
kins is the educational psychologist, Larry 
Johnson is the chief programmer, and practic- 
ing teachers are the program consultants. 

Watkins bought his Apple about three and 
a half years ago, intending to write statistical 
programs that would help him in his research. 
Following through, Watkins did write some sta- 
tistics programs and, along the way, discovered 
some of the other things the computer made 
possible. The result was the formation of South- 
west EdPsych Services. 

The company's education programs in- 
clude The Math Machine and The Spelling Ma- 
chine, both designed primarily for elementary 
school children. Intended as supplements to 
classroom instruction, the programs feature in- 
dividualized lessons to help students learn at 
their own pace, color graphics and sound as 
learning reinforcement, and immediate feed- 
back. Both programs come with manuals that 
can be used by teachers and parents and a rec- 
ord keeping system to track learners' progress.

this fall. 

In addition to two educational games, Spell- 
ing Sorcery and Math Wars, the company of- 
fers Cactus Grade Book, a menu-driven grade- 
book system designed with the novice comput- 
er user in mind. 

Spinnaker Software Corporation, 26 Brighton 
Street, Bemont, MA 02178; (617) 484-8444. 

This brand-new company intends to mar- 
ket learning games that are especially intended 
for use in the home. The company principals, 
Bill Bowman and David Seuss, believe there is 
far too little software for the home that success- 
fully combines educational value and entertain- 
ment. 



Several programs are scheduled for release 
by Spinnaker this fall. Face Maker is a "soft- 
ware toy" for first-time computer users ages five 
through eight. This program introduces chil- 
dren to menus and symbols, and gives them the 
opportunity to communicate with the comput- 
er via the joystick. Face Maker teaches how the 
computer can be used to create and manipulate 
graphic images and enables children to write 
very simple programs to animate the faces they 
create. 

Story Machine, a learning game for chil- 
dren ages five through nine, teaches children to 
communicate with the computer via the key- 
board and helps them develop the ability to 
write sentences and paragraphs using words 



taken from a supplied list. The computer ani- 
mates the sentence or paragraph that has been 
created and the animated sequence is accompa- 
nied by appropriate sound effects. 

The Granite Point Ghost, the first scenario in 
the Snooper Troops interactive mystery series 
(created by Thomas Snyder, author of the 
Search Series for McGraw-Hill), should be 
available now. Computer users who attempt to 
solve the mystery of what happened to the old 
Cable mansion on Thursday, April 6, will ac- 
quire note-taking and mapping skills. They'll al- 
so be called upon to devise information-gather- 
ing strategies, to screen, classify, and relate in- 
formation, and to develop and test out their 
hypotheses. 

Terrapin Update. The Terrapin Logo pack- 
age (reviewed in the July issue) contains two 
disks, not one. The second disk is a Lx)go util- 
ities disk. 

Hal Abelson's Logo for the Apple II is now 
part of the package in book form. Registered 
owners of the original Terrapin Logo package 
will receive the book and a new tutorial 
automatically. Dl

Most adults grew up with the idea that math 
is a computational system of adding, subtract- 
ing, multiplying, and dividing numbers. In 
school, math was a series of tables and formu- 
las, memorized along with other subjects such 
as spelling, states and capitals, foreign language 
vocabularies, and historical dates. W'hile teach- 
ers may have had good intentions, little was 
done to teach students how to think. 

Maybe this is why the language Logo has 
been misunderstood by so many adults. They 
see it only as a series of graphics commands that 
allow young children to draw geometric shapes 
on the computer. Just as they don't perceive 
mathematics to be a universal problem-solving 
language, they don't perceive or appreciate the 
flexibility and lack of inhibiting constraints in 
Logo. 

Logo has a deceptively simple premise. If 
you want the computer to do something for 
you, you simply teach it how. Preschoolers use 
Logo to teach the computer to scribble while 
college students use it to gain a better insight in- 
to Einstein's theory of general relativity. Logo 
users can dabble in anything from circles, 
squares, rectangles, and triangles to vector 
analysis, solid geometry, curved space, and 
Newtonian dynamics. 

But what makes Logo so special — so differ- 
ent? For one thing, it makes you think!

Logo can be likened to the game of chess. 
Players can learn and use the basic moves at a 
very young age. But a number of lifetimes can 
be spent learning the virtually infinite variety of 
combinations of moves that make up opening, 
middle, and end-game strategies. 

The primitive commands of Logo can also 
be learned very quickly. But exploring the va- 
riety of combinations — not only of the Logo 
primitives, but of user-defined Logo proce- 
dures — can take another variety of lifetimes. 

Let's take a short look at the game of 
chess — and at Logo. 

The pawn in chess is the foot soldier, ca- 
pable mostly of moving forward one step at a 
time. On its first move, however, the pawn may 
move two spaces. And to capture another piece, 
it can only move diagonally. 

In Logo, this can be represented by a sim- 
ple procedure. 

TO PAWN 

MAKE "KEY RC 

IF .KEY = "1[F0RWARD 2] 

IF :KEY = "F [FORWARD 1] 

IF :KEY = "L [LEFT 45 FORWARD 1] 

IF :KEY = "R [RIGHT 45 FORWARD 1] 

IF YCOR = 8 [QUEEN] 

SETH 0 

PAWN 

END 

This procedure and the one that follows tell 
a pawn how to move. If you enter a one, the 
turtle moves forward two steps, in that this is 
the first move. Thereafter, moves are made with 



the F key. To capture, you can move the pawn 
diagonally forward left or right. After each 
move, the heading of the pawn is turned back to 
0, to keep it moving up the screen. 

Should the pawn reach the other side of the 
board, at square 8, the player can exchange the 
pavm for any other piece. In this case, we have 
selected a queen. Of course, all of the condi- 
tional procedures could be written to select any 
piece. However, for the sake of an example, the 
queen was selected. 

TO QUEEN 
MAKE "KEY RC 



IF :KEY 
IF :KEY 
IF :KEY 
:KEY 
:KEY 
:KEY 
;KEY 
:KEY 
SETH 0 
QUEEN

"R [SIDERIGHT] 
"L [SIDELEFT] 
"N [DIAGUPLEFT] 
"M [DIAGURIGHTl 
"X [DIAGDNLEFT] 
"Z [DIAGDNRIGHT] 



The queen poses another problem in that it 
can move more than one space at a time. The 
first lines of both procedures — PAWN and 
QUEEN — ^tell the computer to make the vari- 
able KEY equal to the input from the key- 
board. Where the pawn can only move one 
space at a time, writing the procedure to ac- 
complish that type of move requires a defini- 
tion for that single key input. 

With the queen, however, inputs for both 
direction and the number of spaces are re-

THE LOGO LANGUAGE

computer language that is fun to use.

creative, structured thinking in children. 

— Teachers, students, and even mature programmers

quired. Thus, the input from the keyboard 
needs to call another procedure to define the 
distance. For example: 

TO DIAGUPLEFT 
MAKE "DISTANCE RC 
LEFT 45 

FORWARD :DISTANCE 
SETHEADING 0 
QUEEN 
END 

Similar procedures can be written for all of 
the directions by simply changing the second 
line to face the turtle in the proper direction. 

An interesting element of this series of pro- 
cedures is the use of procedures to call them- 
selves and other procedures. Logo offers this 
global type of capability wherein a defined pro- 
cedure can be used to communicate with an- 
other procedure or itself through input and out- 
put functions. 

Another interesting aspect demonstrated 
here is the interactive nature of Logo. Any of 
the defined procedures can be run indepen- 
dently by simply entering the name of the pro- 
cedure. PAWN, QUEEN, DIAGUPLEFT, 
and all of the other direction procedures be- 
come new Logo commands that can be used 
within the hypothetical chess game or to pro- 
vide a scribbling procedure for preschool chil- 
dren. To do this, however, might require cre- 
ating some additional procedures to draw 
curves. 

Apple Logo has arc and circle procedures 
written into a STARTUP file on the disk sup- 
plied. Of course, it is possible to write your own 
procedures that will allow a youngster to draw 
curved lines and circles. Here's one example of 
such a procedure. 

TO C 

MAKE "KEY RC 

REPEAT 360/;KEY [FORWARD 1 
RIGHT :KEY] 

In this case, the youngster enters a C and a 
number — the higher the number, the smaller 
the circle. 

One of the other interesting features of Logo 
not demonstrated here is the capability of using 
not only numbers and character strings but al- 
so lists and procedures as variables. This gives 
you far more control over how the computer 
will interpret and use the language. 

At the Young Peoples' Logo Association 
learning center in Richardson, Texas, young- 
sters have developed some increasingly com- 
plex procedures that draw jjeople, that use two 
and three dimensional drawings, and that play 
complex word and graphic games. Most im- 
portantly, working with Logo has taught them 
to think, to use the computer for what it can do 
best — compute — and to allow them to do what 
they can do best — imagine. 

As Einstein said, "Imagination is more 
powerful than knowledge." If you want to find 
out just how powerful, try your hand at Logo.

As a serious computer user the 
biggest investment you will make in 
your data management system is 
time. And you can't afford to re- 
invest that time when your need for 
information expands. You need 
database management software that 
is easy to get started on and that 
anticipates the inevitable— growth. 



TPG, The Program Generator, 
can be used to generate highly effi- 
cient user-structured inquiry, input, 
edit and file update applications 
programs without programming. In 
a program produced with TPG, up 
to 16 different TDM data files can 
be open and accessed simultan- 
eously, with up to 17 different user- 




modem 



' TDM can easily handle very large 
files, and includes the most versa- 
tile and powerful free-form report 
generator available for the Apple II, 
Apple III and IBM-PC. It provides 
simple reporting procedures in 
spite of its power and rapidly pro- 
duces complex reports. When the 
inevitable happens and your re- 
quirements change, you can easily 
redefine and restructure an exist- 
ing database. 

With TDM you can combine any 
two databases to create a third. 
You can retrieve data and update 
files from remote locations. There 
are no rigid restrictions for report 
titles and headings. You can use 
GOSUB statements and labelled 
paragraphs. IF . . . THEN . . . ELSE 
statements can be nested 16 levels 
deep. TDM lets you sort once to 
produce any number of reports in 
the same sequence.

As a business manager planning 
for growth your need for more and 
more information is inevitable. Your 
software should be chosen because 
it can handle the inevitable. 

With the TDM /TPG Software Sys-

Tools of the Craft, Part 15 

Heartiest congratulations go out to anyone 
who answered last month's challenge: to design 
and build the procedure IntegerOutput, which 
generates the character representation of an In- 
teger value and deposits that character se- 
quence into a specified output file. This data 
conversion procedure complements Integerln- 
put, presented last month as an example of the 
mechanisms that underlie the predeclared stan- 
dard procedure Read. IntegerOutput, of course, 
represents the type of process that goes on in the 
bowels of Write. Here's a version of Integer- 
Output that uses only the Pascal language fea- 
tures and programming techniques that we've 
studied so fan

THEN

Write(OutFile, Chr(Digit + Ord('O'))); 

END 

(* ELSE, the digit is a "leading zero" that 

should be ignored. *); 
(* Remove the leftmost digit *) 
Source := Source MOD PlaceValue; 
(* Now, have PlaceValue reflect that of the 

NEW leftmost digit; get ready to look at that 

position. *) 

PlaceValue := PlaceValue DIV Base; 
UNTIL (PlaceValue < 1); 
(* We only need go as lov,' as the "ones' 
place." *) 
END (* IntegerOutput *); 
BEGIN (TestlntOut) 
WriteLn; 

FOR I := Maxint DOWNTO -Maxint DO 
BEGIN 

lntegerOutput(Output, I); 
WriteLn(Output); 
END; 
WriteLn; 
END (TestlntOut). 

How It Works. First, IntegerOutput emits 
the minus sign, if necessary. Once this is done. 
Source's possible negativity is irrelevant, and so 
the parameter is transformed into its own abso- 
lute value (magnitude) in order to simplify suc- 
ceeding calculations. Remember that modify- 
ing the value of a regular parameter within a 
procedure or function is permissible and does 
not affect the value that is stored in the corre- 
sponding actual parameter (in this case, the 
global variable I). Regular parameters are, as 
we've learned, true local variables that are ini- 
tialized by Pascal with the values of their asso- 
ciated actual parameters at the time of the pro- 
cedure or function call. 

The strategy for displaying the character 
representation of Source is a simple one: we 
know that no Int^er in Apple Pascal consists of 
more than five digits, so we arrange to scan 
through each possible digit position, moving 
from leftmost (most significant) to rightmost 
(least significant). Displaying the entire number 
is simply a matter of extracting and displaying 
the character that corresponds to the digit value 
in each position. 

It turns out that, rather than "extracting" 
each digit as we need it, it's easier to keep "slic- 
ing" the leftmost digit from Source and dis- 
carding it when it is no longer required. To 
make this possible, we declare and use the vari- 
ables Digit, which will hold each digit value in 



turn, and PlaceValue, which arithmetically 
identifies the leftmost remaining digit position 
in the ever-shrinking Source. Initially, Place- 
Value is set to HighPlace, or the leftmost pos- 
sible digit position. 

To "slice off' the leftmost remaining digit in 
Source, we assign to Digit the value (Source 
DIV PlaceValue). Suppose Source is greater 
than or equal to PlaceValue. Then Digit would 
be left holding a nonzero value. If Source is 
smaller than PlaceValue, Digit would contain 
zero. 

To discard the leftmost digit and prepare to 
"slice away" its neighbor to the right, we com- 
pute (Source MOD PlaceValue) and assign that 
value back to Source. Then, we compute (Place- 
Value DIV Base) and make that the new Place- 
Value. The process is repeated until PlaceValue 
is less than one. Note that the rightmost pos- 
sible digit position is being examined when 
PlaceValue contains one, so the display loop 
should certainly terminate after that iteration. 
As a matter of fact, both PlaceValue and Source 
will contain zeroes at the termination of the dis- 
play loop. 

Incidentally, what do you think would hap- 
pen if the loop continued for one more itera- 
tion, past that in which HaceValue contains one? 
If you're curious, rewrite the REPEAT-UNTIL 
loop's terminal condition to be "(HaceValue < 
0)", then recompile and execute. If anything bi- 
zarre happens (and it should), follow any direc- 
tions that the Pascal system writes on your 
video screen. 

And a Zero Shall Lead Them. The display 
strategy described above doesn't mirror In- 
tegerOutput perfectly; indeed, it includes a sub- 
tle quirk that IntegerOutput does not. Simply, 
unless special measures are taken, all values of 
Source will be displayed with the same number 
of digits (five, in keeping with the declared value 
of HighPlace). Thus, 32767 would be displayed 
correctly, as 

32767, 

but 23 would be displayed in a more awkward 
form, as 

00023, 

and so on. To prevent IntegerOutput from dis- 
playing these unnecessary "leading zeroes," we 
use the variable FoundNumStart, which is set 
True during the rightward digit scan whenever a 
nonzero digit is encountered. (Its initial value is 
False, and it is left untouched if a digit position 
contains a zero.) By examining the IF-condi- 
tion that guards the writing of a digit to Out- 
File, you can see that all nonzero values are dis- 



160 



\i SEPTEMBER 1982 



played, while zeroes are generally displayed 
only once FoundNumStart becomes True. 
Note that the IF-condition also ensures that the 
least significant digit will always be displayed, 
whether or not it is zero and regardless of the 
value of FoundNumStart. This guarantees that 
at least one digit will be displayed for any 
Integer, including zero itself 

Trouble in Paradise. There is a potentially 
serious limitation built into IntegerOutput as 
presented above. Certainly, the procedure will 
compile and execute in the Apple Pascal sys- 
tem. In fact, it will function properly for all 
valid Source values and OutFile destinations. 
But, theoretically, it works only for those In- 
teger values in the range —99,999 to 99,999, due 
to the declared value of the constant High- 
Place. This restriction doesn't limit the Apple 
Pascal programmer, of course, since the largest 
valid Integer magnitude is 32767. Thus, In- 
tegerOutput is more than a match for any pos- 
sible Integer value in Apple Pascal. However, 
it's just like Apple to keep improving the Pascal 
system, so some future release of Apple Pascal 
may permit you to work with a substantially ex- 
panded range of Integer values. The method of 
data conversion discussed, which works for Ap- 
ple Pascal 1 .0 and 1.1, may not necessarily work 
for the "enhanced numerics" of this hypotheti- 
cal future Pascal system. To take advantage of 
the new system feature, you would have to 
modify the constant HighPlace such that its new 
value would be the power of 10 that is less than 
or equal to (but not greater than) the new larg- 
est Integer magnitude (as 10000 is to the cur- 
rent largest magnitude, 32767). 

Write your programs and routines in as gen- 
eral a form as possible so that you will find it 
easy to modify them, when necessary, to ac- 
commodate data values that you did not (or 
could not) foresee in the original design. To re- 
spond to a change in the range of Integers avail- 
able on any given Pascal system, you need 
change only one constant in IntegerOutput. 
That's not bad! But recall the complementary 
procedure, Integerlnput, which we studied in a 
previous issue. In its original form, Integerln- 
put is capable of converting any stream of input 
digits into an Integer. It does not have to be 
modified at all if the system's capabilities 
change. 

Can we write a version of IntegerOutput 
that, like Integerlnput, is immune to reason- 
able evolution of the Pascal system? Yes, if 
we're willing to put up with some redundant 
"scanning" of the parameter Source. The trick 
is to initialize PlaceValue to reflect not the maxi- 
mum, but rather the actual number of digits in 
Source before control passes to the display loop. 
To do this, you must insert another loop into 
IntegerOutput prior to the display loop, one 
that "prescans" Source and sets PlaceValue ac- 
cordingly, as in the following version of the pro- 
cedure:

(* Display it *) 
Write(OutFile, Chr(Digit + Ord('O'))); 
(* Remove the leftmost digit *) 
Source := Source MOD PlaceValue; 
(* Now, have PlaceValue reflect that of the 
NEW leftmost digit; get ready to look at that 
position. *) 

PlaceValue := PlaceValue DIV Base; 
UNTIL (PlaceValue < 1); 
{* We only need go as low as the "ones' 
place." *) 
END (* IntegerOutput *); 
BEGIN (TestlntOut) 
WriteLn; 

FOR I := Maxint DOWNTO -Maxint DO 
BEGIN 
lntegerOutput(Output, I); 
WriteLn(Output); 
END; 
WriteLn; 
END (TestlntOut). 

As you can see, by modifying IntegerOut- 
put into a more general form we are able to sim- 
plify it as well. The new version of the proce- 
dure eliminates not only the constant HighPlace 
and the Boolean variable FoundNumStart, but 
also all the expressions that were concerned 
with the suppression of "leading zeroes." In the 
original IntegerOutput, HighPlace was used as 
an arbitrary guess as to the number of digits in 
Source. FoundNumStart, and the expressions 
that used it, were means by which the proce- 
dure could recover from a high first guess and 
avoid displaying zeroes for unfilled digit posi- 
tions. The new method guarantees that the dis- 
play will always commence with Source's true 
leftmost digit, because the position of that digit 
is determined prior to the display process, not 
during it. 



There are those who might look at the 
"double scan" of Source in the second version 
of IntegerOutput and decry the procedure's 
"lack of efficiency," believing that performing 
so many extra arithmetic operations just to de- 
termine the actual size of an Integer is very 
wasteful of the computer's resources. On the 
other hand, you should realize that input and 
output operations (such as Read and Write) are 
perhaps the slowest in any computer's reper- 
toire. Generally speaking, both the Apple's 6502 
cpu chip and the p-machine simulator per- 
form arithmetic much more quickly than an 
I/O device can accept or deliver data. Thus, the 
"cost" of a few extra arithmetic operations in 
IntegerOutput is negligible when compared to 
that of putting out a single character using 
Write. In other words, nobody waiting for out- 
put should even be aware of the extra, prelimi- 
nary scan, so it doesn't hurt to use it. 

Even though the addition of the preliminary 
scanning loop does not noticeably degrade the 
performance of IntegerOutput, you may still 
wonder if it is possible to display the character 
representation of an Integer after scanning the 
number only once. In fact, we can do this by 
employing arrays, strings, or recursion. Arrays 
and strings are data structures that we will be- 
gin to study this month. Recursion is a pro- 
gramming method in which a procedure or 
function tackles a large problem by dividing it 
up into two or more similar, more easily man- 
aged parts, then calling "clones" of itself to han- 
dle each subsidiary part. We won't study recur- 
sion for some time; you'll learn how to pro- 
gram IntegerOutput recursively when the time 
comes. Alternative versions of IntegerOutput 
that use strings and arrays will be presented 
shortly. 

The Case of the Phantom Procedures. Be- 
fore we finally conclude our initial discussion 
of input and output, let's reflect upon the per- 
haps startling fact that Read, Write, and the 
"parameterized" versions of ReadLn and 
WriteLn do not actually exist (at least, not in the 
way that your own procedures and functions 
do). While processing your program, the com- 
piler translates calls to these "anomalous" pro- 
cedures into one or more calls to appropriate 
(and "invisible") data conversion procedures, 
similar in design and function to Integerlnput 
and IntegerOutput. For example, the call 
"Write(IntVall, IntVal2)" (where IntVall and 
IntVal2 are Integer expressions) might be trans- 
lated into the two successive calls, "IntegerOut- 
put(Output, IntVall); IntegerOutput(Output, 
IntVal2)". Similariy, "Read(Keyboard, Real- 
Var, IntVar, CharVar)" might expand to "Real- 
Input(Keyboard, RealVar); IntegerInput(Key- 
board, IntVar); CharInput(Keyboard, Char- 
Var)". 

You are not permitted to call the actual pro- 
cedures and functions that underiie Read and 
Write; indeed, you are not even supposed to 
know that they exist. They, and their similarity 
to procedures that we have developed here, are 
raised only to give you a feel for how the Pascal 
system actually functions and to assure you that 
the system, while complicated, is something that

someone who has both patience and a deter- 
mined desire to know . . . someone like you, 
perhaps? 

Could You Use Arrays? Suppose you want 
to compute the sum of five input numbers. The 
program below shows one way of attacking the 
problem, using only three variables. 

PROGRAM 
Addlnp; 
CONST 
lnputQuantity= 
5; 

FieldWidth= 6; 
VAR 
ValNum, 
Newint, 
Sum 
ilnteger; 
BEGIN (* Addlnp*) 
Sum := 0; 

FOR ValNum : = 1 TO InputOuantity DO 
BEGIN 

Write('Please type value #', 
ValNum:FieldWidth, ': '); 
ReadLn{lnput, Newint); 
Sum : = Sum + Newint; 
END: 

WriteLn('The sum of ', 

InputQuantityiFieldWidth, 
' input values= ', 
Sum:FieldWidth); 
END (* Addlnp*). 

Here is a typical session with Addlnp; note 
that the numbers to the right of the colons are 
supplied by the user, and the symbol < CR > 



signifies a press of the return key: 

Please type value # 1:2<CR> 
Please type value # 2: 4<CR> 
Please type value # 3; 1<CR> 
Please type value # 4: 5<CR> 
Please type value # 5:3 <CR > 
The sum of 5 input values= 15 

If you change the value of the constant In- 
putQuantity, you change the number of values 
that Addlnp will accept and sum. Note that, 
given this program's structure, only three 
variables are ever needed to sum any number of 
input values. Now, let's change the rules of the 
game. Let's require the program to display not 
only the sum of the input data, but also the in- 
put values themselves. Immediately, the prob- 
lem grows thorns. In order to display all the in- 
put values, the program must remember each 
one! For five Integers, the easiest way out (so 
far) is to declare five separate Integer variables, 
one to store each input datum. 

PROGRAM 
Addlnp2: 
CONST 
lnputQuantity= 
5; 

FieldWidth= 6;

CASE ValNum OF

ReadLn(lnput, Newlnti); 
2: 

ReadLn(lnput, Newlnt2); 
3: 

ReadLn(lnput, NewlntS); 
4:

5: 

ReadLn(lnput, Newlnt5); 
END (* CASE ValNum *); 
END; 

(* Generate a single line thus:

WriteLn('The sum ', 

Newlnti :FieldWidth,

Newlnt3:FieldWidth,

Newlnt5:FieldWidth,

); 

END (*Addlnp2*). 

What would be necessary if we wanted to 
modify this second version of Addlnp to han- 
dle even larger amounts of input — say one hun- 
dred Integers, or one thousand? You are abso- 
lutely correct! The programmer would spend an 
insufferable amount of time entering repeti- 
tious instructions. Are you thinking: "But loops 
are supposed to save us from drudgery! We 
know how many input values we need, and Val- 
Num indicates the particular one that we're get- 
ting at any given instant. Can't Pascal use Val- 
Num to find, automatically, the right Newint 
for each datum?" No, the declarations of New- 
int 1 through NewlntS do not permit this. On 
the other hand, if you express these five vari- 
ables as an array, you can do exactly what you 
have in mind. 

Birds of a Feather. An array is a collection 
of variables, all of which share not only the 
same type, but also the same name. Each indi- 
vidual variable in the array is an element of the 
array. Because one identifier refers to all the ele- 
ments in an array, you must append extra iden- 
tification to the array name in order to specify 
an individual element, just as you must include 
more information than merely a street name in 
order to identify a particular building. This ex- 
tra "addressing" informafion is called an index 
(also, a subscript). An index is nothing more 
than an expression that evaluates to an Integer 
or enumerated value. This value is taken as the 
"address" of a single element within the array. 

When referring to an array element, you 
place the index between square brackets im- 
mediately after the array name. Thus, if the in- 
dex for a particular element of the array X is 47, 
then X[47] refers to that single element (and to 
no other). If an Integer variable InxBase con-

tains the value 3, then X[3*InxBase+2] names 
the same array element as Xfll]. Note that 
every time an array element is accessed, an in- 
dex must be computed. 

It may not be immediately obvious, but Ap- 
ple II keyboards generate both the left and right 
bracket, albeit with some difficulty. To type the 
left bracket, you must hold down the control 
key and the K key simultaneously. For the 
right bracket, press both shift and M, together. 
The proper strategy is to press the control or 
shift key first, hold it down while you tap the 
appropriate letter key, then release it. You've 
probably been doing this all along; still, even 
those who are experienced with keyboard work 
will sometimes let their fingers get ahead of their 
thoughts. 

While indices are most usually Integer num- 
bers, they need not be. In fact, values taken 
from any enumerated type, whether built into 
the Pascal language or defined by the program- 
mer, may be used as array indices. Thus, Inte- 
ger, Boolean, and Char values are all eligible, as 
are values from types Color and WeekDay, 
which we invented for our own purposes in past 
issues. Only real numbers are forbidden to act 
as indices, and this has never bothered any pro- 
grammer of my acquaintance — to the best of 
my knowledge, nobody has ever been able to 
make use of, say, the 3.1415th element of an 
array. 

How To Ask for Arrays. Of course, arrays 
must be declared, just like all other variables. If 
you want an identifier to name an array, the 
type you give it must specify an array structure. 
Figure 1 gives the syntax diagrams for an array 
type descriptor. Such a definition may be used 
directly, in a VAR declaration, or associated 
with a type identifier of your choice in a TYPE 
declaration. (The type identifier alone may then 
be used to stand for the entire array specifica- 
tion in subsequent TYPE and VAR declara- 
tions.) 

The key elements in an array type descrip- 
tor are the index descriptor and the element type 
descriptor. The index descriptor specifies the 
values that may be used to index the array and, 
by implication, the number of elements in the 
array. For instance, the declaration "Test: AR- 
RAY [Boolean] OF Real" describes an array 
containing two Real-number elements, 
Test[False] and Test[True], while "Test2: AR- 
RAY [1024..3071] OF Char" creates an array 
of 2,048 single characters. According to the defi- 
nition of Test2, the array contains no such ele- 
ments as Test2[10], Test2[1023], Test2[3072], or 
Test2[4000]. The only legal index values for 
Test2 lie in the range 1024..3071. 

As you can see from looking at the railroad 
diagrams in figure 1, the index descriptor may 
be a single identifier that encompasses an entire 
enumerated type of subrange type, an explicit 
subrange specification, or an explicit enumera- 
tion. Notice that this forces the upper and low- 
er bounds on array indices to be defined, di- 
rectly or indirectly, as constant values. In other 
words, the size of an array is fixed in its decla- 
ration; an array may not "grow" or "shrink" 
during program execution (although we will

learn techniques for simulating such behavior in 
months to come). 

The element type descriptor designates the 
data type that is shared by all the elements in 
the array. An "ARRAY [1..10] OF Char" con- 
tains ten single-character elements, while an 
"ARRAY ['A'..'Z'] OF Boolean" contains 
twenty-six separate True or False values. 

Only files are not permitted to be array 
elements in Apple Pascal. (This is an arbitrary 



restriction that doesn't apply in all versions of 
the Pascal language.) Variables of all other data 
types are suitable as array elements. In particu- 
lar, a single element of an array may itself be an 
array, which in turn includes arrays as ele- 
ments, and so on. Such an array is said to be 
multidimensional because two or more in- 
dices are required to specify a single, indivisible 
datum. Although detailed coverage of multidi- 
mensional arrays must wait until next time, note

THE NORMAL EXPECTATIONS 
OF SMALL BUSINESS 



All too often our normal 
expectations for small business 
financial reporting are "logically 
abnormal". We limit our finan- 
cial reporting activity to satisfy- 
ing the needs of the IRS. Kept 
hidden in most fmancials is val- 
uable information waiting to be 
found to assist us in managing 
our business more profitably. 
Our normal expectations dictate 
that the cost and difficulty of 
organizing and reporting such 
valuable information will pre- 
vent its access. 

Likewise, most general ledger 
systems for the Apple II invari- 
ably restrict themselves to assist- 
ing us in satisfying the IRS . . . 
and not much more. 

ACU=LEDGER, a newly in- 
troduced Financial Manage- 
ment System, represents a dra- 
matic departure from the ''norm" 

ACU= LEDGER simultaneously 
addresses: 

= General Ledger Requirements 

(IRS. etc.) 
= Product Profitability Analysis 

(Job Cost) 

(with automatic proration of 

'overhead burden') 
= Financial Budgeting, Forecast- 
ing, and Modeling 
= Automatic Depreciation 

Scheduling/ Posting (including 

A.C.R.S.) 
= Instantaneous, upon demand 

(on line) inquiry 
= Two Accounting Months 

"open" simultaneously 
= Full Year's detail entries 

retained on the current file 



Moreover, ACU^LEDGER al- 
lows you to describe your vi- 
sion of your environment (em- 
phasizing Marketing, Opera- 
tions, both, etc.). You can even 
describe your environment em- 
phasizing one aspect, period- 
ically re-organize to emphasize 
another, produce the manage- 
ment reports, and switch back to 
the original 'profile' — or stay 
with the new! 



All of this is done within an 
integrated, logical universe (no 
costly redundant input for "Bud- 
get vs. Actual" Reporting, etc.). 
In fact, your bookkeepers' skills 
will improve because they use 
AGU^LEDGER (many book- 
keepers' present difficulties are 
directly traceable to a problem 
in finding the "logical thread" 
that holds the current system 
together). 



ACU=LEDGER's logical struc- 
ture is easily matched by its 
technical sophistication, viz.: 

= Produces many times more 
reports than competitive systems 
(up to 289 unique P&L's. daily if 
you choose) 

= Stores many times more entries 
than any competitive system 

= Has multiple techniques for 
most functions (may use any or 
ail of 4 methods to post entries) 

- Extremely efficient — One test 
"closed" one day's 3.440 
"entry-sides" in IVi minutes! 



ACU^LEDGER is so versa- 
tile that it can be operated in a 
very restrictive manner (mini- 
mal skill level); or it can be 
operated utilizing all of its 
advanced features (or any- 
where in between). Migration 
from one level to another can 
be effected as you become 
familiar with ACU^LEDGER; 
and comfort can be taken in the 
recognition that as your needs 
change, ACU=LEDGER can 
change with you.

that the syntax diagram in figure 1 includes ex- 
plicit provision for specifying more than one in- 
dex in an array declaration. 

Examine the following array type and vari- 
able declarations and work through the syntax 
diagrams to convince yourself that each, in fact, 
obeys the rules of Apple Pascal. (Several decla- 
rations specify multidimensional arrays. Which 
ones, and how many dimensions do they have?)

Even though it contains constituent vari- 



ables that may be accessed separately, an array 
is a complete, individual entity in its own right, 
and may be treated as a whole. Thus, using a 
single assignment statement, you can assign 
values to individual array elements (for 
example, "Newint [1] := 5"), or you can assign 
the entire contents of one array to another (for 
example, "Newint := Oldint"). Of course, two 
arrays must be identical in size and type of ele- 
ment or the Pascal compiler will prevent whole- 
sale assignment of one array to the other. As we 
amble down the Path, you will have plenty of 
opportunity to become familiar, and comforta- 
ble, with the dual nature of arrays. 

To supplement our discussion with an 
executable example, here is Addlnp3, which 
uses an array to bring simplicity back to the 
summation problem: 

PROGRAM 
Addlnp3; (* Uses arrays *) 
CONST 
lnputOuantity= 
5; 

FieldWidth= 6; 
VAR 
ValNum, 
Sum 
:lnteger; 
Newint 

:ARRAY[1 ..InputOuantity] OF Integer; 
BEGIN (* Addlnp3 *) 
Sum : = 0; 

FOR ValNum := 1 TO InputOuantity DO 
BEGIN (* Get a new Integer *) 
Write(Output, 

'Please type value #', 
ValNum;FieldWidth, '); 



ReadLn(lnput, Newlnt[ValNum]); 
Sum := Sum + Newlnt[ValNum]; 
END; 

(* Display the input values and summation *) 
Write(Output, 'The sum of '); 
FOR ValNum := 1 TO InputOuantity DO 
BEGIN 

Write(Output, Newlnt[ValNum]:FieldWiclth); 
IF (ValNum < InputOuantity) 

THEN 
Write(Output, '+') 

ELSE 

Write(Output, '= '); 
END; 

WriteLn{Sum:FieldWidth); 
END (*Addlnp3*). 

Remember that, for every access to Newint, 
an index must be computed. This implies that, 
for every loop iteration, the index to Newint is 
recomputed to conform to the current contents 
of ValNum. As ValNum changes, Newlnt's in- 
dex values change, and so a different element of 
Newint is affected for each iteration. 

Once more, we have programmed our way 
into a comfortable situation where, in order to 
change the number of input values to be 
summed, we need only modify the value of a 
single constant, InputQuantity. 

"There are dimensions other than the one 
we know." While that may or may not be a true 
metaphysical description of the universe, it cer- 
tainly applies to arrays in Pascal. Next time, in 
keeping with the spooky holiday season, we'll 
discuss these extra dimensions and much more 
as we proceed further into the realm of arrays, 
records, and strings. 3M

somehow focus on the 
individual. 

Edu-Ware focuses on the 
needs of the individual 
learner. Use its Computer 
Based Instruction (CBI) to 
achieve specific learning 
objectives: 

Accelerate — Gifted 
students need 
opportunities to advance 
beyond their classmates. 
Edu-Ware helps them 
follow their own pace and 
ensures continuing 
motivation. 

Remediate — Deficiencies 
in core skills sometimes 
limit a learner's success 
in an entire subject. 
Edu-Ware can be 
fine-tuned to the 



individual's abilities in 
distinct skill areas; give the 
right feedback at the right 
time; alleviate frustration. 

Reinforce — Learners 
sometimes run into hurdles 
in their work which they 
need help to bridge. For 
them Edu-Ware's benefits 
are 1) precise definition 
of skills taught in each 
system and 2) a patient, 
non-threatening approach. 

Refresh — At one time or 
another, nearly everyone 
wants to brush up on skills. 
Edu-Ware offers adults 
and young learners alike 
an effective way to review. 
Edu-Ware helps solve 
learnin g needs each step of 
the wa y . . . because some 
learners require a helping 
(animated) hand or carefully 
monitored instruction, while 
others are prepared to 
manage their own learning. 

For young learners, 
ARITHMETIC SKILLS™ uses 
high resolution displays and 
minimum text to establish 
basic math skills — addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, 
and division.

EDU-WARE. Because solution means more than' keeping them busy. 



The Learning Manager 
Systems in FRACTIONS and 
DECIMALS let specific 
parameters (i.e. number or 
subject of test problems, 
sequence, sound effects) be 
tailored to the individual. 

The ALGEBRA SERIES, 
a sequence of five 
independent packages, 
together comprise a 
first-year algebra course. Its 
learners have already 
acquired basic math skills. 
Selecting to work in one or 
more "learning styles," each 
individual is encouraged to 
achieve an increased level 
of self-management. 

Edu-Ware can make the 
difference in Lan g ua g e Arts. 
Often that difference means 
adaptability to a wide range 
of learners. 

Teachers participating in 
an MECC evaluation of 
COMPU-READ reported: 
"Students liked the 
programs . . . they really had 
to concentrate. It was 
surprising how even the 
youngest children stayed on 
task. '* COMPU-READ is a 
tool for improving reading 
speed and recall because it 
works with the reader (child 
through adult), matching 
pace to performance. 

COMPU-SPELL teaches 
spelling by positive 
reinforcement. With 
Data Levels 4-8 it will 
accommodate up to sixty 
learners, yet gives each 
individual vocabulary suited 
to his or her needs. 
COMPU-SPELL with the 



Adult/Secretarial level 
becomes a tool for 
mastering words common in 
business, industry, and 
college. 

Edu-Ware hel ps you to 
prepare , whether for the 
college board or the 
business world. 

Word attack skills are 
tools of analysis which give 
you an edge on mastering 
vocabulary, deciphering 
new or unfamiliar words, 
and taking tests. SAT and 
PSAT** WORD ATTACK 
SKILLS are tutorials which 
give college-bound students 
that edge. 

New tools called 
Interactive Simulations™ — 
Demonstration aids 
learning, especially in 
subjects like Earth Science 
and Physics. 

RENDEZVOUS accurately 
simulates, in 3-D animation, 
the orbital flight of a space 
shuttle craft. It will 
demonstrate exact systems 
of ballistics and orbital 
mechanics or the 
disorienting effects of 
inertial space. Use it to test 
the limits of learners' (over 
13) physics understanding, 
mathematical judgment, 
and perceptual skill. 

Learning companions for 
the ver y youn g. Children 3-6 
are taking their first steps 
toward "computer literacy." 
With animation and 
easy-to-read, high 
resolution graphics, 
Edu-Ware's "BEEs" make 
learning comfortable and 




fun without forfeiting 
carefully managed 
instruction. 

Children work intently 
with SPELLING BEE AND 
READING PRIMER, 
discovering basic concepts 
about words, spelling, 
and reading. Capturing 
attention, COUNTING BEE 
introduces young learners 
to numbers. 

Walk into your local 
computer dealership and 



ask for a demonstration 
of Edu-Ware. You'll see 
the difference.

fast, four-way shooting action. You're a space station in the middle of 
the screen, with alien ships blasting at you from north, south, east, and 
west. Keyboard controlled. 

Third out of the chute is Space Race. You control rocketships trying 
to get from the cones of two volcanos at the bottom of the screen 
to an escape hatch at the top. Hundreds of anxious, radar-crossed bats 
mess up your right of way. This doesn't have the necessary primal charge 
of the others. Paddles only. 

Finally, in Mine Sweep you control a nozzle blasting through a 
screenful of mesh, trying to clear it all away. Every time you think you've 
almost done it, a little weaving bug knits up a new batch of strands. The 
time keeps ticking away. Engrossing and impossible; a frustrator. Key- 
board, joystick, or paddle controlled. 

Four different games, most with reconfigurable keyboard controls, 
and each with its own challenges. What to do with all the money you 
save? Invest in a set of paddles or a joystick if you don't already have 
one. flF

Client Management System II. By David J. Kalmick. The Client 
Management System II is a new and very complete law office billing and 
management control package that offers ease of use and great flexibility 
both in billing and in the number, type, and format of the many useful 
reports it is capable of generating. 

The program has three major functions. First, it prepares prebills and 
monthly statements. The statements may be printal on your company 
letterhead, on preprinted accounting forms, or on plain paper for extra 
uses such as audit or file copies. The system has separate functions for 
regular hourly billing, the billing of cases taken under contingency, and 
the billing of trust accounts. The billings are normally done on a regular 
month-end cycle but it is very easy to issue interim statements or to set up 
your own billing cycle. 

Second, the program prepares more than a dozen management re- 
ports, including Aged Accounts Receivables, Alphabetical Case Recap, 
Case Control Reporting, Case Histories (for single or multiple cases), 
Total Fees Billed by month, quarter, and entire year, showing fees billed, 
costs advanced, standard, contingency, and trust account income and 
unearned income. Total Fees Billed by each attorney, paralegal, and sec- 
retary. Financial Case Recaps, and several reports containing general 
ledger information showing current and cumulative totals for fees, cost 
advanced, and payments received, as well as hours spent this month, av- 
erage hourly rate charged, and total balances due. 

The last function is a unique and comprehensive docket schedule and 
critical-dates calendar. One of the unusual features is that the program 
can keep track of dates many years into the future, avoiding the year-end 
scramble to transfer dates from one calendar to another. In practice, 
daily ledger sheets are prepared by the computer showing what appear to 
be three-by-five-inch ledger cards. If the critical date is less than one week 
away, it will be printed one per sheet. If less than two weeks away, they 
are printed two per sheet; those further in the future are printed three per 
sheet. This system makes it possible to determine at a glance the urgency 
of each date. Each of these "cards" lists the day's date and the critical fu- 
ture date with the client's name, the names of the senior attorney and the 
responsible attorney, the matter to be taken care of, and the location and 
time at which ail is to take place. Finally, at the bottom of the card in let- 
ters five times normal size are printed the number of days and weeks un- 
til the critical event will take place. These cards are printed on the sheets 
three weeks before the critical date. On the actual date, the word Today is 
printed in these giant letters! 



Compu-Law has fully licensed the Apple Pascal System programs so 
that you need only have a RAM card to have full Pascal capabilities. 
This includes the ability to format and initialize the many disks needed 
for the operation of this program from within the program itself— a very 
convenient feature typical of the practical thought that went into the sys- 
tem during its two and a half years of development and testing. 

Once the operation of the system is mastered, it is normally possible 
for a firm with up to ten people with billable time to enter all the neces- 
sary information in about four hours, depending on the total number of 
transactions and expenses. The system is set up so that it is a simple mat- 
ter to enter all the necessary information. 

The documentation is quite lengthy and detailed, but it is badly 
planned and organized. Despite the more than two hundred pages allot- 
ted to documentation, there is no hands-on tutorial. 

Some of the terminology is disturbing. In a two-drive system, drive 
one is referred to as the program drive and drive two is referred to as da- 
ta drive one. This could cause problems: the system, when configured as 
suggested in the manual, uses about thirty disks; in a large, busy office 
the disk storage could easily require more than a hundred disks and fre- 
quent disk swapping. After you become familiar with the system, these 
problems lessen. 

With the original purchase of the program, Compu-Law or your 
dealer will have one of their experts spend up to a full day with you to 
help install the system and train an operator in its basics. After this, they 
make themselves available for telephone support as necessary. 

But the critical program disks cannot be copied and no backup disks 
are available. Worn-out or damaged disks will be replaced by mail with- 
in twenty-four hours for $35 or by Express Mail for $45. 

In short, while the system is very well conceived and executed, it is 
too complex and storage-intensive to be easily used on the suggested 
floppy disk system, except by smaller firms and storefront offices. For 
larger practices, the system should only be considered in conjunction 
with a high capacity hard disk storage system. 

The program is written in Apple Pascal. Its compiler-generated 
UCSD Pascal code makes the program very fast, with little or no time 
wasted waiting for processing. The program is entirely menu-driven and 
self-prompting, which makes operator training relatively easy despite the 
flawed manual discussed earlier. R)R

The Curse of Crowley Manor. By Jyym Pearson. As part of Scott 
Adams's decision to add hi-res graphics to all of his adventures, Pen- 
guin's graphics have been added to this "Other-Venture" production. 

The Curse of Crowley Manor, an intermediate-level adventure, stars 
you as Inspector Black of Scotland Yard. The scene is set in London, 
1913. It starts with a telephone call telling you there has been a grue- 
some murder at the Crowley estate. Your job is to uncover the hideous se- 
cret of the manor and to bring the killer to justice. Drawing heavily on 
the occult and demonology, this adventure has several challenging 
sections. 

• One's powers of deduction and observation are constantly tested. 
Overiooking any one minor clue will cost you your soul in the end game, 
where one battles the forces of Hell itself! Dead bodies and signs of de- 
monic influence abound. If you are lucky, a friendly wizard will provide 
aid and guidance in your quest. One last warning: Be careful or you may 
be eaten alive! RRA

nection people, who seem to have a penchant for simple programs that 
perform a needed task in a simple manner. 

The operation of the program is transparent to the user. The Disk Di- 
rectory Dater modifies DOS to automatically date stamp a file name in 
the catalog listing whenever a file is saved or rewritten to the disk. To- 
day's date is also displayed in place of the words "disk volume" at the 
top of the catalog screen. 

The program is so well-designed as to be near-unbombable. The date 
that is placed in the program name is not significant to the running of 
that program. For example, Hello may be run by just typing run hello 
without the date. If you add the date to the run command it will still 
work. If your program name is more than twenty-one characters long, it 
will be truncated to twenty-one characters — but you can choose to type 
the whole name, the first twenty-one characters, the first twenty-one 
characters and the date, or the whole name and the date — and the pro- 
gram will run like a piece of cake. If a file is saved with the same name, 
the date will be changed to the current date. 

If you have a clock card that uses the standard Mountain Computer 
Apple Clock format, this program will save a program named ClockVmA 
will automatically read your clock upon boot-up, reset the date for you, 
and then run the Hello program of your choice. If you want to manually 
set the date in either case, you need only type in§b and you will be asked 
to type in the desired date. The program will then update itself without 
further input from you. 

All this is very nicely done without removing any DOS commands to 
make room for the Dater routines. 

In these days of increasing paranoia concerning piracy and other sub- 
legal distribution schemes, the Telephone Software Connection has a re- 
freshing attitude. 

All TSC software, when ordered by mail, comes on high-quality Ver- 
batim disks and is completely unprotected and listable. Most of the pro- 
grams are self-documented in a clear and concise manner. 

The only constraint in the use of Disk Dater is the requirement that 
the system be booted with a DOS master disk before merging the Dater 



with your disk's DOS. For obvious reasons, you should not attempt to 
use this program on disks that have any kind of copy protection or 
alterations to DOS. 

If you do any amount of programming, and like to keep track of 
when a particular version of a program was saved without resorting to 
changing the name of each version, this routine would be a timely in- 
vestment. RIR 
Disk Directory Dater, by Leighton Paul, Telephone Software Connection (Box 
6548, Torrance, CA 90504; 213-516-9430). $25. 

Bez-Off. By John Besnard. Bez-Off i?, another entry in the burgeoning 
genre of game anthologies, an innovation of these economically worri- 
some times whereby you get several games for the price of one — some of 
which may even be pretty good. 

The basic idea in Bez-Off is that you get one try at three different 
games rather than the usual three tries at one game. 

All three scenarios continue the ongoing affair between Apple gam- 
ers and the insect world. The segment that lends the name to the game is 
similar to Fly Killer, a freebie of a few years back from the Tokyo Baked 
Apple user group, in which you manipulate your floating bug bomb 
against an increasing moth population, with killer dragonflies appearing 
at about level ten; here, the pests are bees. The stomp-'n'-squish con- 
tingent is represented by a stream of ants, a sugar cube, and a floating 
hiking boot. Avoid the scorpion. A spiderweb game with a floating pair 
of scissors appears to be unique unto itself. 

Aside from their thematic unity, the three are not closely related, but 
the score is cumulative. After you finish one, you have your choice of go- 
ing to one of the remaining games. They are all of the no-win type, with 
the denouement of each an inevitable capitulation before superior num- 
bers of inferior life forms; a sound ecological lesson. 

The graphics are straightforward, neatly avoiding all opportunities 
for gross sensationalistic effects.

it copy anything . . . and I mean anything — his Beatles records, his dog, his 

friends' homework, his worst enemy's worst enemy, and his Cheryl Tiegs

At Witts End 

Dear Witts: What you need is another man. When your husband 
leaves to get a beer, go to the computer and dial the Sauce. When you're 
connected, call up Spouse.Net, and you'll see a dozen or so names and 
resumes. If a temporary arrangement will be sufficient, call for 
Swap.Net. That one has thousands and thousands of names, and I'm 
sure you'll find at least one who's compatible. 

Dear Appley: Me and my friends are into Wizardry. Last night. Tom- 
my — he's a level six gnome — snuck into where the computer is and created 
maybe a hundred new characters, gave all their money to his character, and 
then deleted them. Now he has twenty thousand more gold pieces than we 
have. Is that fair? ^^^^^^ ^^^^.^ ^^^^^ 

Dear Greech: You ask about fairness? I call it murder one! Call your 
local district attorney's office immediately. He should get at least the 
death penalty for this — if not much more. 

Dear Appley: My boot disk drive is making an awful lot of clacking and 
grinding noises. Is there something wrong with it? Concerned 

Dear Concerned I think it's okay. My hair dryer does that, too. 

Dear Appley: Here's an Applied Advice I think your readers should 

know about. As you know, the Apple's game paddles are both exactly alike. 

They're both right-handed, so you can't have one in each hand. However, if 

you turn the left one around so the cord is facing you, then you can have one 

in your left hand as well as in your right and still push the buttons with your 

thumbs. , , J ,,, 

Ms. J. Nybble 

Thanks to you, Ms. Nybble, and to all the rest of you for keeping 
those letters rolling in. Here are a dozen more of Dear Appley's Applied 
Advices: 

1 . Always have an initialized disk in your boot drive when you turn 
on your system. If you don't, someday you'll want to save a program 
you've written and find you can't because DOS was never loaded. 

2. For the same reason, always have at least one blank initialized 
disk on hand to save files onto. And label it so you know that it is initial- 
ized. A good idea is to have one with the label "Working Disk" to use for 
temporary storage of anything you're working on. Because disks don't 
last forever, every so often reinitialize it to erase it completely, transfer to 
it some permanent files that you rarely refer to, store it, and break out a 
new one for the working disk (and initialize it immediately). 

3. If you know you're going to be printing the output of your pro- 
gram, put the command PR#1 in the program itself rather than hoping 
you remember to do it from the keyboard. This saves an awful lot of con- 
trol-Cs or resets and also a lot of swear words. For the same reason, put 
PR#0 at the end of the program to turn off the printer so you don't mess

up your output with keyboard commands or syntax error. 

4. You probably have found out already that game paddles are good 
for only about one trip around the sun, but don't throw your old ones 
away. You can get replacement buttons at your neighborhood Radio 
Shack, but the 1 50K ohm variable potentiometer turned by the knob is 
almost impossible to find (except maybe in Silicon Valley). If one of 
yours goes, cannibalize the good one out of an old set and solder it in 
place of the bum one in the new set. If you've already clipped the wires to 
get the old one out, don't worry. Both paddles are wired exactly the same 
way, so you can open up the other one and copy its wiring. 

5. If your Apple hangs when someone turns on the washing ma- 
chine, a surge protector may solve the problem. If it hangs on hot sum- 
mer days, it may be overheating. Try one of the fans that clip on the side 
vent holes. They are reasonably priced and are available at most dealers. 
At least one of the auxiliary fans comes without a switch. When the manu- 
facturer was asked why, he said, "Just buy a terminal strip, put it on the floor, 
and plug evoything into it — computer, monitor, fan, printer. Then you can 
turn everything on all at onoe with your foot." It's not a bad idea. They are 
convenient if you're not also using your monitor to watch "M*A*S*H." 

6. Before writing a program, even a little Hello program for initial- 
izing a disk, always type new to erase whatever is already in memory. If 
you don't, you may be surprised months later. For instance, suppose the 
residual program creates or writes data to a text file named Printer. Lat- 
er you save on this disk another file also named Printer. When you boot 
the disk, you may find that what you thought was an innocent Hello pro- 
gram has destroyed your efforts. 

7. Always check a disk's catalog before using the rename command. 
Although you can't save two different programs on the same disk with 
the same name (the second would replace the first), you can end up with 
both if you rename one of them. 

8. No matter what you see people in computer stores do, never, nev- 
er, never (well, hardly ever) open or close a disk drive's door if the light is 
on and the disk is spinning. Not only could this destroy all the informa- 
tion on the disk, but you may clamp the spindle on the doughnut in- 
stead of in the hole. 

9. Always put a write-protection tab on your original disk before you 
copy it. If you have one drive, you may get mixed up as you swap disks 
back and forth twenty-seven times to copy twenty-seven files. If you have 
two, you may hit the wrong slot or drive numbers. If you're going from 
your only copy of your just-written adventure-game-to-end-all-adven- 
ture-games to a backup disk with nothing but a Hello program on it and 
accidentally go the wrong way, you'll have two initialized working disks. 
Got a write-protection tab on the working copy of your System Master? 
No? How many times have you initialized it and had to recopy it? 

10. You know that when you're writing a program you should al- 
ways number your lines by tens to leave room for additional lines if you 
need them later ( when you need them later). What numbers should you 
pick for those additional lines? If you add only one line, choose the one 
ending in five — five, fifteen, twenty-five, and so on. This leaves four 
unused numbers both above and below for still more lines. If you need 
two lines, using numbers ending in three and seven will leave you with 
two above and below and three in between. 

1 1 . Speaking of hne numbers, when you're writing a program, you'll 
probably want to use one line number for every statement so that you 
can branch to that statement later if you need to. When you're done, you 
may want to pack your program using colons to put several statements 
that won't cause branching problems on the same line. Example: 10 X = 
100, 20 Y = 25 converted to 10 X = 100: Y = 25. You can do this with- 
out retyping by using escape (once) to gain control of the cursor, copy- 
ing the first line with the arrow key, adding a colon (:) at the end, con- 
tinuing your copying to include all the blanks between the first line and 
the second line to indicate that it's all one line, deleting the second line's 
numbers with the space bar, and then copying the rest of the second line 
with the arrow. You'll then have to delete the old second line by typing 
its number. 

12. When you clean your disk drive heads don't scrub the pressure 
pads by mistake. Remember that the Apple drives have their heads on 
the bottom side of the disk, not the top.

Buttonwood Apples first appeared in Softalk in the September 1981 
issue. Although only a year has passed, both the software industry and 
the availability of investment applications programs have expanded at a 
rate that belies time. 

One year ago, the major investment software packages for the Apple 
could be counted on one hand. Today, there are at least twenty packages 
available. Some software houses are nearly matching the breakneck pace 
at which arcade games materialize for the Apple. 

As investors, we stand both to benefit and to lose from this rapid 
growth. If publishers sacrifice the quality and support of their products 
in an attempt to get products to market too quickly, investors will be- 
come wary of new offerings and will not purchase as many. Since this 
will shrink the potential of the market, fewer new products will be 
created. If, however, the new software packages are given the attention to 
detail they require, investors will have a greater variety of reliable tools to 
choose from. 

Apples first found their way into investment management as elec- 
tronic filing cabinets. Used with available databases, they helped to or- 
ganize information for individual investors and for some forward-think- 
ing investment professionals. 

Charted Waters. The first investment programs took the form of 
technical charting or portfolio management. Charting is a time-consum- 
ing, exacting task that requires not only market knowledge but artistic 
ability, while portfolio management and accounting demand accounting 
skill. These programs have enabled the Apple to serve these needs. 

Newer programs for the Apple perform sophisticated options anal- 
ysis, momentum studies, and other complex analyses. In the past, these 
techniques were the province of larger computers. As such, these tools 
were not readily available to individual investors unless investors sub- 
scribed to service bureaus or patronized full-service brokerage firms that 
provided these calculations. The costs to the investor for these services 
were high. 

The off-the-shelf software now available for the Apple can perform a 
majority of the calculations required by even the most sophisticated 
investor. 

Data retrieval via telephone lines from large databases ensures that 
accurate and timely information is available to the investor for input in- 
to these sophisticated analytical tools. For those investors who cannot 
justify the expense or the equipment needed for electronic data retrieval, 
almost all packages allow entry directly from the Apple's keyboard using 
resources such as the daily newspaper and Barron's Market Laboratory. 

What Goes Up? As the cost of hardware continues to fall, computer 
power will be within the reach of more investors. Software prices will be 
influenced by public demand and by authors' expectations as to the 
prices their products can command. 

As in any new industry, the marketplace is searching for an equilib- 
rium point. What prices, levels of service, support, and quality will con- 
sumers demand for software products? 

As investors and users, we will be the ones who will shape the mar- 
ketplace for these products. Our needs, and our desire to get our money's 
worth, will define and mold future investment packages. 



Focus on Software. This month Buttonwood Apples features the 
Computing Investor Software Series from the Computing Investor (29-A 
Estancia Drive, Marana, AZ 85238; 602-6834444). 

Hardware required 48K Apple II with 16K RAM card or Applesoft 
card; 48K Apple II Plus. Printer is optional. 

Data Entry: Manual only, no modem facilities. 

Backup policy: Copiable. 

The Computing Investor Software Series was created by Rod Packer, 
the author of the recently released Investor's Computer Handbook from 
Hayden Book Company. The series consists of eight programs. 

Quickfolio is a sample portfolio evaluator (available to anyone who 
sends in a blank 5 '/4 -inch disk). The program will yield the portfolio's 
total worth, dollar gain and loss, and percentage gain and loss. 

Fotofolio produces a picture of your portfolio's status. Several meas- 
urements are analyzed and plotted in color or black and white.

Each chart has a status display that shows the results of each meas- 
urement. The presentations available are portfolio gain or loss; relative 
worths for each security; annualized gain or loss; tax-holding times for 
capital gains treatment; percentage attainment of your price goals for 
each security; and a portfolio summary report. 

Quotepro is a quote base manager, similar to a rudimentary database 
system. You enter weekly quotes in eighths or in decimal. Quotepro then 
builds a full-year quote disk to display any stock's quote stream as a 
quarterly-oriented "quote calendar" and point and figure charts are 
scaled in week-of-the-year form. 

Chartpro is the technical charting module of the series. Data is en- 
tered manually. Chartpro utilizes high, low, close, and volume informa- 
tion. The charting routines generate a price-volume chart on the hi-res 
screen. Trend line, trailing average, and other technical calculations may 
be performed. The package allows you to obtain specifics of the secu- 
rities being viewed, such as exact price and volume, by using one of the 
twenty keystroke commands available (explained in the help screen). 

Gaining Momentum. Momentum-M is an equity momentum moni- 
tor. Using weekly price information and buy-sell points that you specify, 
Momentum-M calculates weekly price changes relative to each stock's 
prior movements. The program calculates support and resistance lines 
and is used as a buy-sell decision aid. 

Transactor provides the investor with a stock account status report. 
You enter the specifics of a buy or sell order and the module then deter- 
mines your portfolio's inventory status, calculates a running cash bal- 
ance, and builds lists for tax records. 

Stocksheets is a database manager that creates a "stocksheet" or re- 
port on each security you enter. The program is self-prompting for data 
such as price-earnings ratio, net income each quarter, and so on. You 
may store your notes and opinions of each company by ticker symbol. 

Vector-S computes support and resistance lines based on the move- 
ment of each security. The program may be used as a predictive trading 
model. Color animation is used to show momentum of the securities 
being examined. 



All the programs in the series may be purchased as one package or as 
various sets. The complete series costs $299. Each collection of pro- 
grams has a special name that indicates the type of investor for whom it 
is considered appropriate. 

The Technical Investor includes Quotepro, Chartpro, and Stocksheets 
and retails for $149. The Weekend Investor is comprised of Fotofolio, 
Quotepro, and Momentum-M , and is $99. The Investor's Aide, which con- 
sists of Transactor and Stocksheets, is also $99. The Small Investor's 
Sampler is Quickfolio and Fotofolio and sells for $49. 

Sylvia Porter They're Not. The intent of the author of the programs 
was to provide tools that would help small investors do a better job of 
managing their money and portfolios. The series was not designed to 
help you pick stocks from the entire market, but to aid you in selecting 
stocks from your "known" list. 

Dr. Packer warns investors not to rely on the buy-sell recommenda- 
tions of Vector-S or Momentum-M. He envisions these programs as an 
aid to the investor, not as a substitute for individual judgment. It's a 
good idea to heed this advice whenever dealing with investment software. 

The programs were designed with the nonprofessional investor in 
mind and will be reviewed in that light. 

Each module has help screens that contain the majority of the docu- 
mentation for each program. Technical sheets are provided that clarify 
the specifics of a program and highlight some of its features. The combi- 
nation of the on-screen documentation and the technical sheets pro- 
vides only a minimal explanation of the modules and a guide to their 
operation. 

For the sake of simplicity, we'll review each module separately. Since 
investors can obtain the Quickfolio module by sending a blank disk to 
the author, we won't review Quickfolio here. 

Fotofolio is designed to be used by the small investor as a visual rein- 
forcement aid. The statistics mentioned earlier are projected first as bar 
graphs and then in tabular form. The author's intent is to help you 
"visualize" your portfolio's performance. The bar graph technique does 
indeed highlight stock performance.

SEPTEMBER 1982 



Mix and Match. The bar graphs are not scaled on the vertical axis; 
this makes absolute comparisons between securities difficult, although 
relative comparisons clearly stand out. For those investors who find 
charts more pleasing than numbers or visual displays easier to under- 
stand than tables, Fotofolio is a valuable tool. 

Quotepro can be difficult to use. The technical notes that accompany 
this program consist of a script that walks you through step by step. The 
procedure is not complicated but is difficult to understand nonetheless. 

The program is designed to provide you with a database of quotes on 
your securities. After this information has been stored, you may retrieve 
it either as a quarterly oriented "quote calendar" or as point and figure 
reversal bar graphs. The point and figure reversal bar graphs indicate 
breakouts in a stock's movement. To interpret these graphs, you must be 
well versed in the underlying analytical theory. Without a solid back- 
ground, these charts can very easily be misused. 

The Chartpro module produces high-low-close-volume charts on the 
Apple's hi-res screen. The charts are nicely drawn and easy to read. 
When you're unsure about which command to use, press the H key (for 
help, as in the other modules) and a screen listing all the available com- 
mands will appear. 

The program is easy to use. Stock quotes are easy to enter, and the 
charting routines are fairly rapid. 

Mommtum-M retrieves its information from the Quotepro module. 
The program quantifies relative movements of your securities. How this 
is done is not made clear. Scores are displayed for each security, but their 
actual importance or interpretation is not fully explained. This program 
apparently has been used successfully by the author, but neither the tech- 
nical sheet nor the on-line documentation is explicit enough about the 
program's computations. 

Transactor provides an excellent system with which to organize and 
file information on the status of your trading account. The program does 
not have the facility to recognize short sales or interest on a credit bal- 
ance, but this will not affect the majority of investors in any appreciable 
way. The program has good error trapping. The left and right arrow keys 



are used to drive the program's menu, which is simple to read and un- 
derstand. It is a straightforward, well-executed program for portfolio in- 
formation management and cash balance reporting. 

Stocksheets is basically a tailored database for stock information. 
You are prompted for various characteristics about the stock in ques- 
tion. Stocksheets saves the information and also has areas for your per-, 
sonal comments. The data entry is structured but not difficult. When 
you're entering new data, the program does not clear the screen; this 
makes reading and checking of data entries difficult. 

If you don't have a database program, Stocksheets can be of value as 
a diary of a company's activities. 

Sound Foundations. Vector-S is a price-momentum indicator that 
uses animated graphs to show support, resistance, and breakouts of 
equities. The technical foundations of the program are sound, but some 
people may find the program difficult to use. The menu structure is con- 
fusing, and after a few commands have been executed the screen is lit- 
tered with information from previous commands or operations. 

The graphics are interesting, although a high-low-close chart using 
color for emphasis, coupled with data in tabular form, would be even 
more useful to the investor. 

Dr. Packer has devoted considerable energy to the creation of the mi- 
crocomputing investor series. The programs reflect his investment style 
and strategy. Unfortunately, the documentation that accompanies the se- 
ries does not fully explain the operation or use of the programs. A good 
technician is likely to find some of the modules useful and interesting but 
must be willing to expend significant time and effort to gain an under- 
standing of the program's operation and results. 

The people at the Computing Investor are more than willing to pro- 
vide information or advice on their programs by telephone or by mail. 
The buyer should be prepared to take advantage of these channels con- 
sidering the programs' present documentation. 

In summary, the Computing Investor Software Series fulfills its intent 
of providing an integrated series of programs that give the small investor 
a useful analytical tool.

Mind Your 




BV PETER OLIYIERI 




Welcome to the fall season and to our September installment of 
Mind Your Business. There is much to talk about this month, so let's get 
right to it. 

Business User Group. The mail from readers who are interested in 
being part of our business user group is quite heavy. It's particularly nice 
to note how willing members are to share with one another their positive 
and negative experiences. 

Some of you may recall a plea from a regular reader, Gary Griffis, 
about interfacing the NEC Spinwriter with the Apple Serial Interface 
card. Dr. Helge Gunther of Webster, New York, who once faced a simi- 
lar problem, sent along a solution. 

Gunther reveals that the secret to interfacing the Apple II Plus with 
the NEC Spinwriter is the replacement of the PSA PROM chip (as 
recommended in the addendum to the Apple Serial Interface card book- 
let). With the PSA PROM installed, the NEC printer works very well. It 
has an ETX/ACK protocol, mark parity, full duplex, and fast printing 
speed. 

If you wish to interface the Apple III with the NEC Spinwriter, the 
process is a bit more complicated. The printer does not operate with the 
cables and modem eliminator that are supplied with the Apple III. (It 
will work with XON-XOFF protocol, but Dr. Gunther wanted to use 
the same one as with the Apple II.) It was therefore necessary to have a 
special cable prepared. The following diagram for the cable was pro- 
vided by Tom Landry at NEC Information Systems. 

To Printer (female) Apple III (male) 

1 > 1 

2 - -- > 3 

3 - > 2 

7 > 7 

Pin Number 5 5 

6 6 

8 > 8 

20 20 

Note that pins 5, 6, S, and 20 are bunched on both ends before 
connecting. 

The printer should be set to 7 bit, odd parity, 1,200 baud, full du- 
plex; and the protocol for using the RS-232 driver should be configured 
to ETX/ACK protocol as listed in the Apple III Standard Device Driv- 
ers Manual for the Qume Sprint 5 printer. 

One nice feature with this configuration is that if you've forgotten to 
turn on the printer, or if the printer is in local mode when printing in- 
structions have been sent to it, you can correct the setting on the printer 
and a control-F will get you going without losing a single character. This 
particular setup allows you to use the printer with either the Apple II 
Plus or the Apple III. All that's needed is a rocker switch to transfer back 
and forth from mark parity to odd parity. 

While this explanation may be a bit technical for some readers, it just 
fills the bill for those who are having problems with interfacing. Some- 
times the only way to get information about how to solve a problem is to 
get the answer from another user. Contacting vendors and dealers is not 
always the most successful way to go. Your hints, peeves, rages, and 
other experiences using the computer are well worth sharing; they may 
provide some much needed information to another user. 

Find Your Business. Jeff Lambert, president of Photronics Corpora- 
tion in Pennsylvania, writes to underscore how vital it is for users to be 



able to locate immediately data on compatibility of hardware and soft- 
ware. Of course, the strengths of certain hardware and software need to 
be documented also. 

Ideally, a telephone-accessible database containing legitimate com- 
plaints and reviews of products should be established. Dealers, vendors, 
and magazines cannot convey the same information about a product as 
can someone who has "walked into the desert" with it! Lambert hopes 
that other readers share his feelings and can either suggest a forum for 
the exchange of information or will actively support any such forum that 
might be developed. As one step toward addressing this problem. Mind 
Your Business wall devote space to the business user group and will share 
information users send in. 

Several thousand of you responded to the Olivieri's Inquisition a few 
months back. What a great resource. To get the ball rolling now, we'd 
like to ask those of you who have had experience using a word processor 
or printer to answer the following questions. 
If you are using a word processing program: 

1. Which word processing program are you using? 

2. How much did it cost? 

3. What hardware is needed? 

4. What are its strengths? 

5. What are its weaknesses? 

6. What general comments do you have about word processing 
(hardware or software oriented)? 

7. Do you have any questions for other readers "about word 
processors? 

If you have a printer. 

1. Which printer do you own? 

2. How much did you pay for it? 

3. What interface card do you have? 

4. What are the printer's strengths? 

5. What are its weaknesses? 

6. What general comments do you have about it? 

7. Do you have any questions for other readers about printers? 
When you finish, send your response to Softalk B.U.G. (Business 

User Group), Box 60, North Hollywood, CA 91603. For a mere twenty 
cents you can be an active member of the group. Your replies to these 
questions will provide valuable information to other users; besides, it's 
quite likely that sometime in the future someone else will reply to ques- 
tions that are of particular interest to you. 

Financial Modeling. One of the most important aspects of any busi- 
ness is managing the financial side of things. Even if you have a strong 
background in finance, this can be a complex and difficult task. 

In the course of running a business, it's often necessary to consider a 
variety of financial options and then to select the one that best suits the 
company's goals and objectives. This process can call for a good deal of 
quantitative analysis and the building of models that represent the finan- 
cial aspects of any organization. If these models are well constructed, you 
can use them often and ask various "what if?" questions that will help 
you evaluate different financial strategies. 

Most managers who have to make these kinds of decisions greatly 
value any support they are given. Software systems that provide this kind 
of help are sometimes called decision support systems. Such systems aid 
judgment instead of simply trying to computerize it. This approach 
evolved at about the same time as the concept of time sharing on large 
computers and gave users the opportunity to develop and use financial 
models interactively.

SEPTEMBER 1982 



With the arrival of microcomputers, similar power is becoming avail- 
able to interested users at a significantly lower cost. One such system, 
available from Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, is called Micro- 
DSS/ Finance. (Note that the letters DSS, for Decision Support Soft- 
ware, appear in the tide.) Micro- DSS / Finance rqjresoits a sophisticated 
financial modeling package for the microcomputer. Addison-Wesley 
plans to develop a Micro-DSS series for managers and professionals. 

Perhaps the best way to illustrate what this type of package will do is 
with an example. If you are somewhat familiar with financial modeling, 
you'll immediately recognize the power of this system. If you're new to 
the concept, then what follows will be an excellent tutorial on some of the 
characteristics of such models. We'll consider some of the more ad- 
vanced features of the package later on. 

Let's look at an example from the DSS /Finance package of the anal- 
ysis of alternative investments. 

Financial Modeling Example. Joan Perkins, owner of Perkins Real 
Estate, plans to retire next month at the age of seventy. She intends to 
keep the house she owns (debt free) and to convert all her other assets, 
valued at $320,000, to cash. 

To supplement her guaranteed pension of $14,000 per year, Perkins is 
thinking about purchasing a ten-year annuity with an 1 1 percent yield. 
She is also considering investing $150,000 in a money market fund. The 
current yield on the fund is 13.7 percent, but she feels that interest rates 
wall drop to 12 percent next year and that they will stabilize at 1 1 percent. 

Perkins would like to know both her dollar income and her real in- 
come over a ten-year period, assuming that inflation is around 9 percent 
per year. Her question is whether she'd be better off putting all her cash 
assets into the money market fund or into the annuity. 

Many of us, provided we had a litde help (and luck and time), could 
solve this problem using pencil and paper. Let's look instead at how a 
program might be written within the DSS/ Finance package to come up 
with some answers more easily. The program will be explained in more 
detail after the listing. Refer now to figure 1. 

The first number at the beginning of each line is a line number. We'll 
use these numbers to reference different lines as we explain their 
meanings. 

Lines with a C at the beginning represent comments that can be in- 
serted into a program. When a number appears at the start of a line (af- 
ter the actual line number), it refers to a row. 

Look at line 5. This line says that row 2 of the model will be labeled 
"cash" and will contain cash amounts. This same principle applies to 
lines 6, 9, and 10, which are labeled "pension," "investment in money 
market fund," and "interest rate," respectively. Since no values have 
been given yet, they will have to be input to the model later. 

Line 11 contains a calculation. It says that row 6 will be labeled

6: 11 = 1, 9% 

7: 13=10,15,20,25 
Figure 2. Data file for alternative investment analysis. 



"INT INCOME-MMF". The values in that row are to be calculated as 
follows: 

Row 4 times row 5 divided by 100. 

Look at the formula and see how this is typed. Remember that the 
calculation is to be done for all columns in the table (ten years, in this 
case). 

Line 14 also has a calculation in it. It says that the "investment in an- 
nuity" will be the result of row 2 minus row 4 for the first column only. 

Lines 15 and 16 deal with a special built-in function in DSS /Finance. 
This function requires two lines. The first line gives the appropriate pa- 
rameters for the annuity. Thus, line 16 says to use the parameters in row 
8 against the values in row 7. The function requires that four parameters 
be placed in row 8. These are the interest rate as a percentage, the num- 
ber of payments, the starting month, and the number of payments per 
column (year). You'll see how this looks when the data is listed and the 
final reports are shown. 

Line 16 uses another built-in function that allows you to compute the 
net present value of the numbers in row 12 at each discount rate con- 
tained in row 13. 

Preparing the Data. The data can be entered into the model inter- 
actively or as a data file. Figure 2 contains the data for our alternative in- 
vestment analysis model. 

The information in the data file relates directly to the original prob- 
lem statement. 

Line 1 says that the value in row 2, column 1 is 320,000. 

Line 2 says that row 3 has ten values of 14,000 (the pension). 

Line 3 says that all columns get a value of 150,000. 

Line 4 gives the interest rates for the money market fund. The first 
value is 13.7 percent, the next is 12 percent, and the rest of the values are 
11 percent. 

Line 5 gives the four annuity parameters described earlier: a rate of 
1 1 percent for 120 months, beginning in month 1, with twelve payments 
per year. 

Line 6 gives the inflation rates. They start at 1 percent and then in- 
crease at the rate of 9 percent per year. 

Line 7 gives the different discount rates required by the present value 
formula. They are 10 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent, and 25 percent. 

One very nice feature of the DSS/ Finance model is a special com- 
mand called worksheet. This command causes the system to print out a 
worksheet that contains a listing of all the values that must be input to 
the model to make it work. The values are clearly labeled and are fol- 
lowed by blanks. This allows you to send the worksheet (the request for 
input data) to someone who has little knowledge of or experience with 
computers. After this person has completed the worksheet, it can be re- 
turned to whoever is running the actual model. 

Getting Some Answers. A few simple print commands now allow 
you to print out a variety of reports. Figure 3 shows three such reports 
much as they would look when printed. 

It's not often that such a detailed and lengthy example finds its way 
into this column. But in this case an example seemed the best way to il- 
lustrate what kinds of things this particular package can do. If you're in- 
terested in the subject of financial modeling, invest some time in trying to 
«ee how most of this model works. It may give you some insight into how 
you might put it to use in your own setting. 

Micro-DSS / Finance requires an Apple II with 48K, the Language 
System, two disk drives, a monitor, and a printer (preferably one with 
132 columns). 

Bag of Tricks. Now for some specifics about DSS/ Finance. 
The program is designed to build and run models and to generate re- 
ports and graphics. 

It can perform financial calculations automatically, including pay-

back, net present value, interest expense, and tax loss carry-forward. 

Functions for lag, spreading, and cumulative value are built in. 

Simultaneous equations and matrix manipulation can be done easily. 

The program can handle tables of up to 13,000 cells. 

The program facilitates the design of extensive, customized reports, 
as well as the speedy generation of "quick and dirty" reports. 

Reports can be "turned sideways" so that rows are columns and vice 
versa. 

Files of results can be saved and used as input to other models. 

Automatic Financial Calculations. Discounted cash flow can be cal- 
culated for finite or infinite streams of cash flows at single or multiple 
rates. Included are features for net present value (NPV) of a finite cash 
flow stream, net present value of a perpetual cash flow stream, NPV at 
multiple rates, internal rate of return of perpetual cash flow streams, and 
pay back period for a cash flow stream. 

Depreciation is calculated using straight line, declining balance, 
double-declining balance, or sum-of-the-years'-digits method. Options 
include residual value of assets and automatic switch-over to straight line 
in the optimal year. 

Tax calculations include computation of the amount of a loss car- 
ried forward and the appropriate tax rates. 

Lxjan amortization includes functions for interest, principal paid, re- 
maining balance on a loan, and total payments. 

Graphic displays of reports include pie charts, bar charts, and line 



graphs. A special plug-in device allows you to conduct a "slide show" of 
your graphics. This device plugs into the game port and is also used as a 
copy-protection feature. 

The DSS/ Finance documentation is outstanding. It is professionally 
done and easy to use. At times it does read like a sales promotion piece, 
but it is nonetheless very thorough and complete. In addition, a user hot 
line is provided to assist users. 

Ouch. Now for the bad news. The cost of Micro-DSS/ Finance is 
$1,500! For those of us who are used to considering packages that range 
in price from $29.95 to $250, this is very steep. 

While many users will feel this is too high a price, the model is ex- 
tremely powerful. If you are at all involved in financial modeling, you 
must seriously consider DSS/ Finance. It is indeed less expensive than it 
would be to use a larger mainframe package. In any case, if you are in- 
terested, consider purchasing either the User Reference Manual for Mi- 
cro-DSS /Finance ($35) or Introducing Micro-DSS /Finance ($10) first 
and giving it a thorough look. 

If the DSS/ Finance package seems to be right for you, it may be one 
of the better investments you make. It is not as fast and powerful as its 
mainframe predecessors, but it is very impressive. 

Continuing Support. Once we've bought a product — in particular, a 
software product — all of us like to know how to use the package to its 
fullest. A variety of newsletters and user groups formed around particu- 
lar programs have surfaced to offer this kind of information and con- 
tinuing support. 

Intercalc is one such user group. Intercalc is the largest independent 
user group specializing in the uses of VisiCalc-type programs. The group 
also publishes Spreadsheet, a bimonthly newsletter, Intercalc members 
receive many valuable tips, applications, product reviews, and complete 
templates developed by the organization's founders. In addition, mem- 
bers contribute their ideas, tips, concepts, and programs. Members also 
receive special discounts on related products. 

The majority of Intercalc's membership is from the business com- 
munity and includes Fortune 500 companies. Big Eight accounting firms, 
advertising agencies, brokerage houses, computer manufacturers, small 
businesses, colleges, doctors, and lawyers. Membership dues are $25 per 
year and represent a good investment. 

Whether you're a novice or an expert at using VisiCalc, you really 
should have Spreadsheet. Each issue contains great tips and actual ^pli- 
cations. You can even share some of your own uses (and be paid for your 
contribution). 

A Yearling. About a year ago. Software Arts, the creators of Visi- 
Calc, introduced a publication of their own called SA TN (Software Arts 
Technical Notes). The objective of this bimonthly publication is to show 
all VisiCalc users how to use the program more effectively and exten- 
sively. Articles cover such things as detailed applications, tutorials, points 
of clarification, and information on the use of specific VisiCalc 
commands. 

Upcoming issues of SA TN are scheduled to include articles about ex- 
changing data between VisiCalc and other programs using the DIF for- 
mat, political forecasting models, interfacing with word processing pro- 
grams, and more. If you're interested in subscribing to SA TN, send $30 
to Software Arts. 

In both of the above instances, you might ask to see a sample issue 
before deciding whether to subscribe. But, based on the issues we've seen, 
the total investment of $55 is a wise one for any regular user of VisiCalc. 
Continuing professional and technical support is absolutely essential to 
the success of any business product — and that means success from the 
viewpoints of both user and vendor. 

Finale. Well, that brings us to the end of another month. Thanks for 
reading along; we hope something discussed here was helpful to you. The 
Inquisitions are nearly done, the word processing series is progressing, 
and the Apple III review will be coming up soon. Take care and have a 
good month. Hi

Mark Pelczarski credits David Durkee as coauthor of this month's 
Graphically Speaking. 

Although most graphics are done in machine language for speed, 
there are some interesting effects that can be created easily and quickly in 
Applesoft Basic. 

Explosions. Using Applesoft shape tables, you can do a fast, good- 
looking explosion. First, use the shape maker from two issues ago to 
create a somewhat random shape like the one shown in figure 1. Make it 
somewhat small, as we will be scaling it larger. Also, be sure that your 
starting point is somewhere in the middle of the shape so that it stays cen- 
tered when we increase the scale. Name this file. Shape. 

Now use the routine in listing 1 to create an explosion at location 
X,Y. The routine first draws the shape you created in scale 1, erases it, 
draws it in scale 2, erases it, and so on until it reaches scale 7. Along the 
way, it varies the hcolor from one to seven, adding color to the effect. If 
you use this routine on a background you want to keep, use xdraws in- 
stead of draws, and skip the hcolor commands — draw will clobber what- 
ever was there. 

Lasers. The hplot command can be used to create a quick laser ef-

feet between any two points. It helps to have a set source for the beam. 
The two bottom corners are favorites in many games because they give 
the impression that the user is really in a spaceship. That is what we will 
use here. Unfortunately, there is no hplot command with the features of 
xdraw, so any fancy background will be hurt by this effect. 

Now, of course, these two effects are just dying to be used together, 
which is why we used the odd line numbers. Listing 3 is a routine that in- 
corporates both into a laser blast followed by an explosion sequence.

Last month we provided a primer on animation using random paths, 
preset paths, and joystick and keyboard control. As an addition to those 
methods, listing 4 is a program that actually simulates the natural move- 
ment of a common object: a bouncing ball. You'll need a new shape for 
this program, as illustrated in figure 2. Name your new shape file, Ball. 

Lines 10 through 70 set things up. The main loop, lines 100 through 
190, follows this sequence: 

1 REM XF.YF ARE BOUNCE FACTORS 

2 REM XM.YM ARE MOMENTUM 

3 REM GF IS THE GRAVITY FACTOR 

4 REM X,Y IS STARTING LOCATION

270 YM = SGN (YM) * ( ABS (YM) - ABS (YM) / YF) 
280 GOTO 170 

Listing 4. 



Line 110 draws the shape at X,Y. 

Line 1 20 updates the shape's location by adding the momentum fac- 
tors, XM and YM. These are preset in line 60 and updated in various 
places throughout to account for gravity and bouncing. 

Lines 130 through 160 check to see if the ball has hit a wall. If it has, 
the routines from lines 200 through 280 reverse the direction of move- 
ment and simulate the loss of energy that occurs when a ball bounces. 

Line 170 is the gravity factor. 

Line 180 erases the shape. Note that the more instructions you put 
between drawing and erasing a shape, and the less you put before the 
next draw, the less your shape will flicker. Using smaller shapes also 
helps minimize this problem. 

Line 190 goes to the beginning of the loop. 

The Effects of Entropy. Take a look at line 220. This is where the ob- 
ject loses some of its momentum in bouncing. ABS (XM) / XF is the 
fraction of the energy that is lost. If you make XF smaller, the object will 
lose more energy with each collision. However, if you make it a negative 
number, it will gain energy! 

The preset values for this variable and others are located in lines 60 
and 70. Try changing them and seeing how each affects the physical laws 
in the little world on the hi-res screen. The remarks in lines 1 through 4 
explain what each controls. 

Now, the only trouble with this is that it goes on forever unless you 
use control-C to get out of it. This is the reason that we numbered the im- 
portant parts of the laser and explosion routine starting at 300. If you just 
add those lines 300 through 370 onto the listing 4 program, and then add 
these two lines, you get a neat way out that demonstrates aptly how to 
use such a subroutine in a larger program. 

185 KB = PEEK( - 16384): POKE - 16368,0:IF 
KB > 127 THEN 300 

380 FOR DL = 1 TO 500: NEXT DL: HOME : TEXT : END 

That's all for now. In the next few installments we'll be offering a Ba- 
sic hi-res character generator and machine language graphics routines to 
use from Basic programs.

Everyone's Guide to Assembly 
Language, Part 24 



Last month we looked at a routine to simulate the SCRN(X,Y) func- 
tion of Integer Basic. The notion of inquiring about points on the screen 
is closely related to this month's topic, the collision counter. 

The collision counter is a one-byte memory location on page 0 of the 
Apple's memory. Its value is a function of the Applesoft hi-res graphics 
routines specifically related to shape tables. The purpose of the collision 
counter is to keep track of any "collisions" between a shape being drawn 
on the screen and any previously drawn screen images. The collision 
counter is located at SEA (decimal 234) and is affected only by the com- 
mands draw and xdraw. 

Some Experiments. To illustrate the behavior of the collision count- 
er, we'll first need a shape table to experiment with. The one given here is 
probably the simplest one possible — a single dot. 

To enter it into memory, go into the Apple's Monitor by typing in 
call —151, and then type in: 

300: 01 00 04 00 04 00 
E8: 00 03 

This will place the table in memory at location $300 and set the point- 
er at $E8,E9 to point to the table. 

The first two bytes of the table (01 00) indicate the number of shapes 
in the table, which in our case is just one. The next two bytes (04 00) give 
the offset from the beginning of the table ($300) to the start of the actual 
shape data ($304). The next two bytes (04 00) are the actual bytes of data 
for the shape itself. In this example the shape table is a single move of one 
position up the screen. 

You may wish to review the information on shape tables in your Ap- 
plesoft manual (1978), pages 92 to 96, for more details on shape tables. 

The first experiment is to verify that we have in fact installed a us- 
able shape table. This is most easily tested by putting your Apple into 
Applesoft Basic and typing in: 

HGR : HC0L0R = 3 : ROT = 0 : SCALE=1 

The screen should clear. You can now type in: 

DRAW 1 AT 100,100 

A single dot should appear on the screen. You can change the scale to 
three by typing in: 

SCALE=3 

Test this by typing in: 

DRAW 1 AT 100,100 

A vertical line of three pixels should appear. If all has gone well so 
far, you can now try a third experiment. The purpose of the experiment 
will be to see how the collision counter reacts with various combina- 
tions of drawing colors, background colors, shape drawing commands, 
and the previous condition of the collision counter. 



Clear the screen with hgr again, and try this sequence of commands, 
noting for each one what the conditions of the screen and collision count- 
er are before and after the command. (Note that references to "color" in 
this article will be in terms of "white" and "black" as would be seen on a 
black-and-white monitor. If you have a color set, the dots will appear as 
single color dots — as explained in previous issues.) 

HC0L0R = 3 : POKE 234,0 : DRAW 1 AT 100,100 : PRINT PEEK(234) 
('0' should be printed along with a white dot on the screen) 

DRAW 1 AT 100,100 : PRINT PEEK(234) 
(T, white dot) 

DRAW 1 AT 100,100 : PRINT PEEK(234) 
('1', white dot) 

HCOLOR=0 : DRAW 1 AT 100,100 : PRINT PEEK(234) 
('0', dot erased) 

DRAW 1 AT 100,100 : PRINT PEEK(234) 
(T, no dot) 

If you try all the various combinations, you should be able to replicate a 
chart something like this:

With the scale at one, we did a series of draw and xdraw commands. 

The first column shows the value of hcolor for the draw or xdraw 
command. The second column shows which command we used. The 
third column shows what background color was present when the shape 
table was drawn. 

The headings C=0 and C= 1 refer to the status of the collision count- 
er before the draw or xdraw. The entries in each column show the value 
after the command is executed. The last column shows whether the re- 
sulting dot is white ("on") or black ("off). 

The conclusions to be "drawn" from this chart are: 

1 . If a draw is done, the resulting dot will be consistent with the 
hcolor used. The collision counter will increment one unit for each dot 
on the screen that is already at the same "color" as the dot being drawn. 
That is, if white is your hcolor, the collision counter will count the num- 



194

ber of white dots the shape hits. If your hcolor is black, the collision 
counter will return the number of black dots the shape draws over. This 
allows you to use a light background and dark shapes and still have ev- 
erything work! 

2. If xdraw is used, the current hcolor has no effect. Xdraw always re- 
verses the background dots. For a black background, xdraw will incre- 
ment the collision counter for only those dots turned "on." If the back- 
ground is white, the collision counter will be set to zero only if all dots are 
turned "off." 

3. The previous state of the collision counter has no effect on the fi- 
nal value after the draw or xdraw. This means that no preconditioning or 
initializing is necessary in a given routine. 

Draw versus Xdraw. Before proceeding further with the collision 
counter, it is important to take a moment to clarify the distinction be- 
tween the two shape table commands draw and xdraw. 

Draw is very direct in that it basically does an hplot in whatever the 
current hcolor is, using the specified shape. As mentioned eariier, the col- 
lision counter simply adds up the total number of collisions with existing 
dots in the same "on" or "off state as the hcolor being used. 

Moving shapes using draw is done by first drawing the figure, and 
then either reversing the color by setting hcolor to black and then doing 
another draw, or using xdraw to accomplish approximately the same 
thing. 

Xdraw, on the other hand, uses the EOR (exclusive or) function to 
actually reverse the bits on the screen where the shape is to be drawn. 
What this means is that a fixed color as such is not used. Rather, each bit 
on the screen in the desired shape pattern is reversed from its current 
status. By following this with another xdraw, the screen is restored and 
background figures are not erased. 

Principles of Animation and Collision. Any hi-res game or simula- 
tion is basically just a simulation of reality in which a screen image suc- 
cessfully mimics the behavior of an object in the real world. The primary 
things to be simulated are generally motion and collisions. Both aspects 
have been discussed in earlier issues, particularly with regard to the idea 
of simulating convincing motions. 

In the past programs, the positions of the objects were used to deter- 
mine whether it was time to bounce the object off a wall or off another 
object. In this sense, we can say that collisions were predicted rather than 
detected. The collision counter gives us a way of detecting collisions with 



objects on the screen whose current position may not be known. This 
takes on practical significance when you may not want to keep track of 
all the things flying about the screen, as is quite possible in many game 
scenarios. 

Putting all this together, we come up with the following general ap- 
proaches: 

1 . Draw a figure. Check the collision counter for nonzero values to 
detect a collision. Draw with black or xdraw to erase for the next move- 
ment. Background figures will be erased when using this technique. 

2. Xdraw a figure. The collision counter should equal the number of 
dots in the figure (that is, a constant value) if there is no collision with ex- 
isting images. Xdraw again to erase. The collision counter should return 
to zero if no previous collision was made. This will leave background 
images intact, but figures drawn will have a "harlequin" appearance as 
they pass over background images. See the demonstration program for 
an example of this. 

The Scanner. The following two demonstration programs are called 
The Scanner because they are reminiscent of the classic radar screen 
sweep pattern. 

The first program uses the xdraw,xdraw system of redrawing the 
image, and as such, is nondestructive to other images on the screen.

"I can do nothing for the man who will not bring me his problems." 

More than two thousand years ago the Chinese philosopher Confucius taught his simple truths about life 
in pointed stories and clever aphorisms. But with all his wisdom and wit, Confucius could only help those 
willing to help themselves. 

For the post two years, the novice assembly language programmer has found wisdom in the writings of 
Roger Wagner. Unfortunately, not everyone has been able to follow Wagner's work from the beginning. 



Now you can help yourself to become a better assembly programmer with Assembly Linest The Book, a 
compilation of the first fifteen installments of Wagner's "Everyone's Guide to Assembly Language," pub- 
lished in Soffalk from October 1980 to December 1981. 

Complementing the fifteen updated and expanded columns, Wagner has added new material to benefit 
the novice and experienced programmer alike. Five appendices, an index, and an introduction help 
make Assembly Lines: The Book one of the best treatments of the subject. 

$19.95 gets you more than 270 pages of graphs, listings, and exercises. Assembly Lines: The Book is 
available at finer computer stores across the country or directly from Soffalk. If you order from SoHalk, 
please add $1.50 for shipping and handling.

to the maximum (255 = far right). 

Now activate the routine by typing in: 

CALL 28672 

Experiment with different paddle values, slowly increasing the radius 
with paddle zero until the scanner intersects the vertical line. You should 
at that point hear a number of clicks from the speaker as the lines cross 
each other. 

Let's see how the program actually works. Line 27 starts the actual 
code by jumping over the data for the shape table. This is the same one- 
dot shape table you entered earlier in this column. Lines 32 and 33 ini- 
tialize the HCOLOR to 3 (white), although for this program that is ac- 
tually not necessary. Lines 34 through 39 set our value for rotation to 
zero (to be used later), and set the pointer $E8,E9 to point at our table at 
$7003. 

Now here's the tricky part. In general we want to store two positions 
for the line we'll draw. The first is the old position (where it was last 
drawn) and the second is the new position where the new line will be 
drawn. You'll recall we developed this technique in earlier articles on the 
moving dots as a way of minimizing the screen flicker. 

For the simple dots, it didn't really matter if on the first pass through 
the program we erased a dot that wasn't really there. In this case, though, 
it does matter since using XDRAW will cause an image to appear if one 
wasn't there already to erase. 

This is solved by using a one-pass flag that will tell the program to 
skip over the ERASE routine on the first time through. Lines 41 and 42 
initialize this flag to T. 

Lines 44 through 47 use HPOSN to prepare for the later use of the 
shape tables. Line 49 increments the value for rotation on each pass 
through the loop. This causes the revolving of the line. Wrap-around 
when RT reaches 255 happens automatically, so no checking for out of 
range errors is required. 

Lines 50 through 55 get the value for scale from paddle zero, which 
corresponds to the eventual length of the plotted line. Note that a special 
check is done to avoid scale being set to #$00, since Applesoft treats this 
the same way it treats 255. This makes the paddles a little more friendly 
to the user. 

On the first pass through, FLAG will be equal to 1 , so the test on line 
58 will fail. It will then be decremented to 0 to clear the flag, and the 
forced branch to PLOT will be executed. 

The routine for drawing the shape is very similar to routines in pro- 
grams presented in earlier articles. The main difference in this routine is 
our use of the routine XDRAW ($F661), which is used the same way the 
DRAW routine was used before. 

Once the PLOT section is completed, a wait is done at lines 85 
through 88 by using the WAIT ($FCA8) routine as a function of paddle 
one. 

Notice that on successive passes through the loop, FLAG will equal 
zero, and so ERASE will always erase the old position before PLOT 
creates the new one. RT ($07) and SCL ($08) are used to hold the new 
values for rotation and scale, respectively. 

As for the actual collision detection, because we are using the 
Xdraw,Xdraw method, we will use method 2, which says that the colli- 
sion counter should return to zero after the figure is erased. We use this 
fact to check on lines 67 and 68 for a zero value collision counter. If the 
counter is not zero, the speaker is clicked that number of times before the 
program does the next plot. 

In practice the speaker is a little undependable since the frequency of 
the clicks is so high. You may wish to experiment with different delays in 
the CLK loop, as is done in the sound routines. You may prefer the cur- 
rent method for this demo because of the intuitive nature of the clicks, 
but musical sounds can also provide some interesting insights into the 
process. 

The usual hgr equivalent from this routine has purposely been left 
out to allow you to alter the screen with hplot and other Applesoft com- 
mands before running the scanner. Another interesting variation is to 
type in: 

HGR: HCOLOR = 3:HPL0T 0,0: CALL 62454 



The screen should clear to all white. Now activate the scanner by typ- 
ing in: 

CALL 28672 

Now the clicking will depend more directly on the length of the line, 
although some interesting variation can be observed depending on the 
angle of the line as well. While you're reading along you might ponder 
why that would be, considering the screen would seem to be clearly uni- 
form in the number of dots the line is intersecting. 

Once you've entertained yourself sufficiently with the first program, 
try this second variation, one that uses the Draw,Xdraw method. Here 
the point of interest is that the scanning line erases anything it touches, 
and so leaves a visible trail of where it has been when activated against a 
solid white background.

In this routine, the first variation is in the use of DRAW (versus 
XDRAW) on Hne 77. In addition, because we are now using the 
Draw,Xdraw method, the collision counter detection now goes after the 
initial creation of the image as is done by PLOT. In terms of program- 
ming then, the changes are minor. It is interesting to note, though, how 
differently the screen behaves. 

It is most instructive to start by typing in: 

HGR: HCOLOR = 3: HPLOT 0,0: CALL 62454 



The call 62454 is the routine that clears the hi-res screen to the last 
hcolor plotted, so we'll take advantage of it to fill the screen with dots for 
our Draw,Xdraw scanner to detect. Make sure the paddles are set to zero 
for paddle zero and 255 for paddle one. Then activate the routine by typ- 
ing in: 

CALL 28672 

As you eventually sweep out all possible angles and radii, you'll no- 
tice that not all screen locations can be reached from a fixed point. This is 
because of a limited number of rotation positions (as opposed to a con- 
tinuous 360-degree motion) and also the line nature of the screen dis- 
play. 

By looking carefully you can see that there are more point intercep- 
tions, and thus collisions and clicks, at the near vertical, horizontal, and 
forty-five-degree positions than angles in between. This tends to give a 
modulated sound to the clicks as the "beam" scans when running the 
first program against a white background. 

The Possibilities. Once you understand the idea behind the coUision 
counter, it can be very useful in both arcade game— type software and 
other simulations. You'll probably be able to imagine all sorts of novel 
ways of applying this technique in your own programs. 

Next month, we plan to give nongraphics enthusiasts a break and 
look a little more into some areas of machine language programming 
that we haven't covered yet. 

See you then! 



A Note from Roger: Our discussion of hi-res graphics from assem- 
bly language will wrap up with the old year. We'd like your input on 
where to go next. What would you like Assembly Lines to cover?

RE&^WTTH 



BV )OE SHELTOn 



This month we are going to discuss an important feature of Visi- 
Corp's newly introduced VisiCalc Advanced Version and learn how to 
build templates that can accomplish the same thing with a regular ver- 
sion of VisiCalc. 

VisiCalc Advanced Version. VisiCorp announced VisiCalc Ad- 
vanced Version for the Apple III at the National Computer Conference in 
June. The Advanced Version is the most powerful version of VisiCalc avail- 
able. 

One new command, providing powerful and useful new capabilities, 
stands out in the Advanced Version. It is the Keystroke Memory com- 
mand. This command can execute a series of VisiCalc commands with a 
single keystroke (all right, three keystrokes if you count /K). The poten- 
tial uses for Keystroke Memory are varied, and, as people begin to un- 
derstand and use it, its range of uses will probably increase dramatically. 

One of the main advantages of Keystroke Memory is that it allows 
you to consolidate data from different templates into a single template. 
The Advanced Version doesn't magically consolidate information, how- 
ever. Instead, it uses the Data Interchange Format (DIF) as the vehicle 
for consolidations. Other modeling tools, such as A.p'p\Q's Senior Analyst 
and Microsoft's MultiPlan. use tags to specify which data is to be con- 
solidated. The use of tags for consolidations is very flexible because data 
can be pulled from a file without requiring that the models have a spe- 
cific format. But the problem with employing tags is that users still have 
to be very familiar with the operation of the software. 

VisiCorp has chosen to do consolidations in such a way that users 
don't have to be familiar with the more complicated aspects of VisiCalc. 
The idea is that data will automatically be interchanged through DIF 
files using Keystroke Memory. DIF can be even more useful, because it 
enables you to transfer data to different Visi-series products as they be- 
come available on the Apple III. VisiSchedide for the Apple III, for ex- 
ample, also announced at the June conference, uses DIF. 

Now Comes the Hard Part. The problem (and it is either a simple or 
a complex one depending on your knowledge of VisiCalc) is that the 
original template designer must design the template to be able to handle 
data transfer through DIF. After all the templates have been completed 
(and the templates don't have to be in the same format), the Keystroke 
Memory command allows consoHdations to be accomplished by almost 
anyone. The user simply boots VisiCalc Advanced Version, presses /K 
and a specified key, and the consolidation begins. The user is prompted 
to insert the correct disks and the rest of the consolidation is automatic. 

While DIF has been available for a couple of years, this is the first 
time it will be easy for users to take advantage of its capability. As Visi- 
Calc Advanced Version gains in popularity, no doubt many templates will 
be created that use this method of consolidation. Apparently anticipat- 
ing preparation for this, VisiCorp announced Business Forecasting 
Model, a series of templates for the DOS 3.3 Apple II version of Visi- 
Calc. These templates are designed to enable consolidations of informa- 
tion into income statements, balance sheets, and financial-ratio analysis 
templates using DIF. If you own VisiCalc III, you can convert these tem- 
plates to your version of VisiCalc using the information contained in last 
month's column. 

Consolidations don't require the Advanced Version. So even if you 
don't have an Apple III you can use DIF files to consolidate informa- 
tion. The only stipulation is that you must have a version of VisiCalc that 
contains DIF capability. If you want to check your version, pressing /S 



will show a # in the list of options. The # symbol is the DIF save-load 
command. 

If your version doesn't have DIF, there is still a simple method for 
doing consolidations. Those of you with thirteen-sector Apple II Visi- 
Calcs or the original VisiCalc III Version I.O can use the normal Visi- 
Calc file consolidation method. Note: If you have a DOS 3.3 Apple II 
version of VisiCalc and plan to use DIF, make sure that you have a ver- 
sion other than 193B. Version 1938 will have problems with DIF trans- 
fers. If you do have version 193B, contact your dealer to see about ob- 
taining an upgrade. 

Which Method Should You Use? There are advantages and disad- 
vantages to each method of consolidation. DIF consolidation permits 
smaller files to be sent for consolidation. Efi'ectively, the DIF file is noth- 
ing more than the information displayed on the screen. That means that 
if the input model uses any formulas to generate the data (for example, 
10 percent growth per month), the data (numbers) and not the formulas 
will end up in the consolidation template. For most consolidations, that 
is desirable. But if you want to take the information presented and do

"what if?" calculations (after all, what's VisiCalc foi?), you won't, for ex- 
ample, be able to change the growth percentage rate and see the effect 
without rebuilding each input model to include formulas. If you need to 
"what if?" clearly the normal VisiCalc file method is necessary. 

The normal VisiCalc file method requires that each input model be in 
exactly the same cell coordinates as it is in the consolidation template. 
That has a major implication. If the input model is below the consolida- 
tion template, it will be a larger file than the consolidation template and 
will consist mostly of blank space. This is because the file size is partly de- 
termined by the number of rows and columns that exist to the left and 
above the bottom right of the model. The DIF method allows the input 
model to require only the space necessary for the actual model. 

Choose a Method and Try It! If you aren't going to use the DIF 
transfer capability, complete the DIF consolidation model until you have 
tested and saved the consolidation template and then go to the section in 
this article on building a model using normal VisiCalc files. If you are go- 
ing to use DIF, start in this next section. As always, it will be easier and 
more fun if you boot VisiCalc and try things out as we go along. You'll 
also need a formatted or initialized disk on which to save files. 

Building a DIF Consolidation Model. In order to consolidate infor- 
mation, we are going to build two types of templates. The first type of 
template is comprised of the models that have the information to be con- 
solidated. We will refer to these as input models. A company's area sales 
forecasts from the sales managers of different regions are an example of 
an input model. 

The second type of template is the consolidation template. This is the 
template that a company's sales office would use to consolidate area 
forecasts into a single sales forecast. In this article, we'll build two input 
models. But first we'll build the consolidation template. 

Our consolidation template will include a sales forecast and a reve- 
nue forecast. The sales forecast will be a consohdation of the separate in- 
put model forecasts for unit sales. The revenue forecast will be based on 
the total unit sales multiplied by a specified retail price. Our forecast 
will be for one year (January through December) and will include three 
items (or products). Set up the forecast and revenue sections as shown in 
figure 1. (In order to make the directions for the inout templates easier to

understand, start the Item 1 row in C6 for the Unit Sales chart, and in 
CI 5 for the Revenue chart.) 

Next, enter the two regional (Area) forecasts input models shown in 
figure 2. 

The Area forecasts in figure 2 are the locations to which the DIF files 
will be transferred. After we have completed and saved the consolida- 
tion template, we will delete the consolidation forecasts (figure 1) and use 
the Area forecasts as the input models. For simphcity, we will save both 
input models in one file; but normally each Area template would be used 
independentiy. If that sounds confusing, remember that the Area fore- 
casts are the input models that contain the data we are trying to consoli- 
date and would probably come from different people. It is also impor- 
tant to note that we could have as many input templates as memory and 
space permit. 

Presto, Chango. The two input models shown in figure 2 point out an- 
other interesting thing about using VisiCalc for consolidations. The in- 
put models don't have to be in the same format as the consolidation tem- 
plate; they don't even have to be in the same format as each other. Hav- 
ing them in different formats does complicate the initial model building, 
as you will see. Once the model is completed, the format of the individ- 
ual input models makes no difference. 

The ideal format for the input models is to design each to have the 
same format as the consolidation template. That way, any rows or col- 
umns (Items or months in our example) added to the input models can 
easily be added to the consolidation template. The formulas in the con- 
solidation template can easily be added through replication. 

Furthermore, the labels applied to each row and column can be dif- 
ferent in the individual templates. In an input model, a cell can be la- 
beled the intersection of a month and a product name, while in the con- 
solidation template the consolidated data can be labeled anything ap- 
propriate. 

For simplicity's sake, format all the data cells in the unit and the reve- 
nue forecasts for integers. That's easily accomplished by entering /FI in 
an individual cell and then replicating it through the remaining cells in 
the templates. 

Now comes the difficult part. As we said earlier, having two differ- 
ent layouts for the input models will cause the formula entry to be a bit 
more complicated. Move to cell C6, the intersection of Jan and Item 1 in 
the unit forecast section. We want to add the data in the equivalent ceU 
coordinates for Jan and Item 1 from Area 1 and Area 2 input models. 

In our example, the formula in the first cell is -I-B26 +G26. Cell 
B26 is the January forecast for Item 1 in the Area 1 forecast and G26 is 
the equivalent cell in Area 2. To continue the example, Item 1 Feb is 
+ Bn+H26. If the input models had been the same format as the con- 
solidation model, you would have had only to enter the first formula and 
then to replicate it (using relative reference) into the remaining cells. If 
you'd like to make the remainder of our example easier, change the Area 
1 model to the same format as the Area 2 model before proce«iing. Then 
finish entering the remaining formulas in the sales forecast section. 

Next, the Total Sales cells will sum the values in each column. Enter 
the ©SUM formula (that is, @SUM(C6...C8)) and replicate it (with rela- 
tive reference) across the Total Sales row. 

Next, in the Revenue section, we want to take the unit sales figure for 
each month for each Item and multiply it by a retail price. In our ex- 
ample, the Jan Item 1 Revenue cell has the formula 12*C6. Jan Item 2 is 
15*C7 and Jan Item 3 is 13*C8. Complete the Revenue section follow- 
ing the examples above. You can use the replicate command (with rela- 
tive reference) again to speed up the process. If you want the prices to be 
variables, you can have a section in your model where you enter the in- 
dividual costs. Then, instead of having the formulas be a value multi- 
plied by a cell coordinate, the formulas will be the cell coordinates that 
you already have in the formulas muhiplied by the cell coordinate 
containing the prices. Remember, if you replicate these formulas, you 
will use relative reference and No Change (for the costs). 

We need a Total Revenue row next. Replicate the formula in Jan To- 
tal Sales across the Total Revenue row (need we say using relative refer- 
ence again?). All of the cells should display 0 until we enter values in the 
input models. 

The next step is to test the template to ensure that our formulas are

accurate. First, save this template under a file name like CONS.TEMP

sults, double-check the formulas in the suspect cells. (Don't forget to save 
the file again if you make any changes.) 

If you're going to do consolidations using normal VisiCalc files, now 
is the time to go to the section entitled, "Building a Consohdation Model 
Using Normal Files." 

For DIF users, it's now time to prepare the input models. This part is 
going to be easy! For this example, we will keep these two input models 
in the same file. Once you understand how to break them out of the con- 
solidation template, you can easily separate them into different files if 
you want to. 

Delete rows (/DR) until the label Area 1 is in cell A3. Save the file. 
This is all it takes to make our sample input template. If you want to save 
individual input templates, delete the columns containing the Area 2 
model and save the Area 1 model. Reload the original input template 
containing both Area 1 and Area 2 and delete the columns containing 
the Area 1 model. Save the Area 2 model and you're ready to do a con- 
solidation using individual input models. 

Consolidating the DIF Model. The first step in consolidation is to 
enter information into the individual Area models. You can enter either 
random information or growth formulas in the cells. For example, you 
can enter a value in the Jan cell, enter 1.1* (the Jan cell coordinate) in the 
Feb cell, and then replicate the value in the Feb cell (using relative refer- 
ence) into the Mar through Dec cells. 

Next, move the cursor to the cell containing the label Area 1 . Press 
/5#5 AREAl{rQi\xm). Move the cursor to the lower right cell of the Area 
1 model (Dec Item 3) and press return twice. Do the same thing for the 
Area 2 model, using a different file name than you used before, and you

are ready to do a consohdation. 

Reload the consolidation template (CONS.TEMP or CONSOLI- 
DATION TEMPLATE) and move once more to the cell with the label 
Area 1. Press /S#L AREAl (return return). You have now consolidated 
the Area 1 model. Press .' and see the result in the consolidation area of 
the template. Remember that you must start with the cursor on the cor- 
rect Area label whenever you load your DIF files. Load the Area 2 
model (using /S#) and see the completed results. You now have a con- 
solidated template. If you want to learn how to consolidate using nor- 
mal VisiCalc files, read the next section. 

Building a Consolidation Model Using Normal Files. If you have 
completed, tested, and saved the consolidation template (including the 
Area models), you are ready to prepare it for consolidation. The first 
thing we must do is separate the Area models. These are the input 
models. This is done in a slightly different way than in the DIF method. 
Rather than deleting rows or columns to remove the consolidation part 
of the template, blank out (/B) all the cells in the consolidation part of 
the template. You can do this easily by replicating a blank cell through- 
out the cells you want to be blanked. Do not delete any rows or columns. 
It is important that the input models remain in their exact cell locations. 
Otherwise, the consolidation won't work. 

After blanking out all of the consolidation part of the template, save 
the Area model template. If you desire individual Area models, you can 
then blank the Area 2 part, save it, load the combination Area model, 
blank out Area 1, and save the Area 2 model. You now have two indi- 
vidual Area models. 

This method of consolidation is simpler than using DIF. Load, enter 
sales data, and save the separate Area models. You might want to use 
growth formulas in the forecast cells (see the section, "Consolidating the 
DIF Model") so you can see that the consohdation doesn't affect the for- 
mulas. 

Load the consolidation template (again, CONS.TEMP or CON- 
SOLIDATION TEMPLATE) and then, without clearing the consoh- 
dation model, load (in the normal /SS fashion) the remaining Area mod- 
els. You now have a consolidated model. 

Designing Templates for Growth. The two or three files you have are 
all you need to do many different consolidations. You can change the ti- 
tles in the models for different applications. If you decide that you need 
more Items or more months, the easiest way of getting them is to take the 
consolidation template, add the new rows or columns, test the model, 
and break out the individual input models. 

In some instances, the data to be consolidated is really only a part of 
the consolidation template. The consolidation template may do many 
different computations, in the range of which the input model is only a 
small factor. That relationship really doesn't affect the process of design- 
ing the template. The input model should be designed as a physical part 
of the consolidation template and should be tested; only then should it be 
separated from the template. You can, of course, try to develop the indi- 
vidual templates in separate files, but then the only way to test them is ac- 
tually to consolidate. If they don't work, then make your changes, save 
the files, and try another consolidation. 

Also, the input model might be a part of a larger template. In this 
case, as you probably know by now, the input model should fit the for- 
mat (cell locations) for both the original and consolidation templates. 

Once you understand how to build consolidation templates, you will 
begin to find many instances in which information from certain tem- 
plates can be used in other templates. Consolidations are often the quick- 
est and easiest way to accomplish that. If your consolidations are com- 
plicated because they require too many steps, look closer at VisiCalc Ad- 
vanced Version. Once you know how to consolidate your information, 
the Advanced Version will do most of the work for you! 

Templates Revisited. Last month we discussed how to convert Visi- 
Calc templates that were designed for use on different Apples. Purchas- 
ing VisiCalc templates is one of the fastest ways to begin to realize value 
from VisiCalc. A future column might be the perfect forum in which to 
discuss some of the templates available today. If you know of any com- 
pany selling (or giving away) VisiCalc templates for any Apple Comput- 
er version of VisiCalc, please write to Softalk and let us know. If re- 
sponse is sufficient, you'll see an article or review on templates in a fu-

Without question, the most important peripheral for most computer 
owners is the floppy disk storage system. When you consider the alter- 
native, the tape recorder, it becomes clear why the vast majority of Apple 
owners have at least one Disk II. 

Because of the high demand for these units, many outside manufac- 
turers are now offering Apple-compatible disk drives. In fact, many of 
these drives are superior to the Disk II in storage capacity, speed, and re- 
liabibty. Even the Apple disk controller card has been improved by 
several companies. 

Disk Basics. When it was introduced, the Disk II floppy disk sys- 
tem, like the Apple itself, represented a radical departure from the design 
of the time. Gone were the usual LSI controller IC, the sector hole de- 
tector, and the constant disk rotation when the drive was not in use. 
Even the head-load solenoid was eventually removed, lowering drive cost 
as well as the noise generated during operation. 

If all of this is Greek to you, maybe reviewing a few basic principles 
of how the floppy disk works will help. This month's column focuses 
mainly on a hardware description. For a further understanding and a 
complete overview of the disk operating system software, refer to a trea- 
tise such as Beneath Apple DOS from Quality Software. 

The Disk Medium. As you may already know, a floppy disk is some- 
thing of a cross between recording tape and a phonograph record. As 
with the recorder, information is stored magnetically on a thin piece of 
Mylar film. Rather than using a long, narrow strip of "tape," the stand- 
ard floppy is an eight-inch diameter disk that can be rotated like a rec- 
ord. The Disk II and other drives we will be discussing are technically 
classified as minifloppies because they use the smaller 5 '/4 -inch format. 

Information is stored on this film base by spinning it past a writing 
head so that data is laid out on a circular track. The head moves in and 
out to write on many different tracks. Tracks are somewhat like the 
grooves on a record, only each track is concentric; that is, the tracks do 
not continually spiral inward. A better analogy may be to an eight-track 
tape player, in which the head moves up and down to play back the dif- 
ferent tracks. 

How does the head actually read and write data on the disk? The

secret lies in a thin coating of magnetic particles that are spread onto the 
surface of the Mylar. These particles are suspended in a substance that 
allows them limited movement, yet keeps them from falling off the disk. 
The coating is referred to as the oxide. 

Each particle is like a tiny magnet; therefore, it will act like a com- 
pass under the influence of a magnetic field. That is, if the field is strong 
enough, these particles will turn themselves so that they are aligned with 
the field. 

On a blank or erased disk, each particle will be pointing in a com- 
pletely random direction (figure la). After passing over the head while it 
is writing, however, the particles in that track will be aligned in one of 
two directions, depending upon the flow of the electric current through 
the head (figure lb). The direction of current flow determines the direc- 
tion in which the particles line up. By changing the current's direction, 
we can write our desired information as a series of magnetic fields. After 
the particles have passed by the head and are no longer influenced by its 
field, they remain locked into their last orientation until acted upon by 
another magnetic field. Therefore, we have achieved our goal the per- 
manent storage of data. This is the basis for all magnetic recordings, 
whether of music, digital data, or television pictures. 

Reading data back from the magnetic media is also quite simple. As 
the aligned particles move past the head (which is now being used as a 
pickup device), they set up their own magnetic fields, which extend into 
the gap of the head. Whenever there is a change in the particles' orienta- 
tion, or flux reversal, a small voltage is induced into the head (figure 2). 
This voltage can be amplified and conditioned to resemble exactly the 
data signal originaUy recorded. Figure 3 shows how this is accomplished. 

Packing It In. With binary digital data, an important consideration is 
how much data can be stored on a given disk. In this discussion, we're 
going to make numerical claims about the performance of disk drives in 
several areas. 

These numbers by no means represent the actual expected limita-

Above, our first collection of Apple-compatible drives. Starting from the 
penthouse on down: the Disk II made by Apple Computer; the Model 3101 
by Lobo Drives; the Super Drive by Fourth Dimension; the A2 and the A40 
drives, both by Micro-Sci; the Apple-Mate by Quentin Research; and the

tions at any given time. Instead, tiiey are relatively standard figures that 
give a considerable margin of safety to ensure reliable operation. Thus, 
for example, when we say that a disk can hold 25,000 bits per track, it 
may be true that we could store as many as 50,000 bits in some instanc- 
es. But after allowing for disk and drive variations, environmental fac- 
tors such as temperature, humidity and dust, and wear and tear, it may 
be that the lower number is the limit we can approach and still have a 
reasonable chance of recovering our data without error. 

The total amount of data that can be stored on one disk depends up- 
on two factors: the number of tracks and the number of bytes per track. 
The number of tracks used is determined by the accuracy of the posi- 
tioner and the track recording width. The Disk II and its equivalents all 
use thirty-five tracks. While most drives for the Apple are physically ca- 
pable of reaching one or more extra tracks (moving closer to the disk's 
center), many manufacturers are now using the popular forty-track 
drives. Of course, changes must be made to the DOS in order to use the 
extra tracks. 

Both thirty-five and forty track drives use a standard track density of 
48 TPI (tracks per inch). This means that the head only moves about ¥4 
of an inch from track 0 to track 34. Seventy and eighty track drives 
achieve their greater density by packing the tracks closer together, at 
ninety-six TPI. Obviously, this requires a very accurate positioner and a 
head with a narrower field. 

The number of bytes that can be recorded per track also depends up- 
on a number of factors. First, a certain constraint is imposed by the disk 
material itself. This has to do with the density of the magnetic particles, 
or how many there are on a given area of the disk. It takes many parti- 
cles in alignment to represent either of the magnetic states; therefore, the 
density of particles really sets a limitation on the density of flux changes. 
At the same time, the read-write head has a limiting factor of its own. 
This relates to the size of the field it creates when writing and responds to 



when reading. The drives we will be discussing are typically rated at 
about 5,500 FCI (flux changes per inch). 

Keeping in Sync. Given this limitation on the number of flux 
changes per inch, the number of bits per track depends upon the track 
length and the number of flux changes required per bit. The first figure is 
easy to calculate. Since we must assume the "worst case" conditions, we 
use the innermost track dimension, which turns out to be a circle of 
about 1.54-inch radius. Using two-pi-R, the circumference formula, this 
translates to 9.68 inches. 

The number of flux changes per bit is determined by the type of re- 
cording format used. Since the data is stored serially, that is, one bit at a 
time, by a mechanical device whose motion is not extremely precise, it 
must be sent asynchronously. This means that some extra clock pulses 
are added to the data so that when reading, the playback circuits can 
later synchronize with the data stream coming from the head. Several dif- 
ferent techniques have been developed for this function. 

Recording Format. Before trying to understand the recording tech- 
nique used by Apple DOS, it is helpful to examine the standard format 
that was used by most other manufacturers when the Disk II came out. 
A typical 5 W -inch floppy disk system might have consisted of a Shugart 
SA400 drive, a controller interface designed around an LSI controller 
IC, and a disk operating system such as CP/M. The system might have 
used hard sectoring, in which the beginning of each block of data was 
indicated by the presence of a sector hole in the disk. This hole was de- 
tected by a simple lamp-photocell arrangement located on either side of 
the disk. Another sectoring scheme, called soft sectoring, might also have 
been employed. This technique signifies the beginning of each sector by 
writing a special series of bits, sort of a road sign, to the disk to mark the 
address of each location. 

The actual recording technique used is known as double frequency 
(FM) NRZI modulation and is characterized in figure 4. A bit cell is de- 
fined as the space between two clock bits. The absence or presence of a 
pulse within each cell determines whether it represents a zero or a one. 
With this technique a "zero" is written by one flux reversal and a "one" 
is written by two reversals within each bit cell. 

Given the previous restraints on flux density, the standard single den- 
sity recording was set at 25,000 bits per track. This works out to 2,581 
bits per inch on the inner track. Since each bit takes a maximum of two 
flux reversals to record, this translates to 5,126 flux changes per inch, 
which is well within any disk's capabilities. After accounting for the sec- 
toring information and safety gaps, this allows about 80K of storage per 
disk. 

However, using one clock pulse per bit is quite inefficient. All that is 
required for read synchronization is that a pulse be received every so 
often. If the data ones recorded on the disk could provide this pulse, we 
could eliminate the clock pulses. Without clock pulses, however, there 
must be some guarantee that there will not be a long string of zero bits. 
Such a string would be read back as a long space without any pulses. If 
long enough, it could cause the read circuits, or data separator, to be- 
come unsynchronized. 

Thus, the data to be stored must first be translated into a series of 
legal codes that can be written to the disk. This is the function of a rou- 
tine in DOS. There is a similar function to restore the data when it is read 
back from the disk. With DOS 3.3, eight-bit data is first transformed in- 
to one of thirty-two different codes. This allows six bits of the original 
data to be represented by the eight-bit code. With this technique, known

as group code recording (GCR), six bits of data can be represented by 
only eight flux changes instead of the twelve previously required. That's a 
50 percent improvement! 

Apple Innovations. By stretching things a little farther, DOS 3.3 is 
able to place more than one hundred forty-three thousand bytes of data 
per disk. This is accomplished with a flux density of approximately 5,460 
FCI. The only penalty for this increased storage capacity is a similar in- 
crease in the complexity of the storage system. 

Whereas the previous single density format lends itself to a simple 
hardware interface (usually contained within one chip), the GCR format 
requires extensive software overhead to perform disk operations. Apple 
felt that the computer would be tied up anyway during disk operations, 
so they placed many of the typically hardware functions in software. 

Another example of this is in the control circuits for the head posi- 
tioner. By using software, Apple was able to design a faster positioning 
medianism. Instead of moving the head at a constant rate like its pred- 
ecessors, the Disk II accelerates the head as fast as possible until it is 
halfway to where it needs to go. Then the head is decelerated at the same 
rate until it finally comes to a stop at the desired location. Since several 
different positioners are used by the drives under consideration, we will 
now look at these mechanisms. 

Head Positioning Mechanisms. The function of any head position- 
ing mechanism is to move the head to a precise location under the disk. 
This selects which track the head will access. Almost all disk drives use a 
stepper motor to perform the actual movement. Unlike a normal motor 
that spins freely when a voltage is applied, a stepper motor only turns in 
small increments, or steps, according to changes in the voltages applied 
to its coil. 

Each possible position of the motor's shaft corresponds to one track 
on the disk. The Apple Disk II and all "fully compatible" drives use a 
ninety-six TPI, or seventy-track, stepper motor. This means that the step- 
per motor can position the head to within 1 /96 of an inch. The standard 
head, however, makes a recording whose track width is greater than this. 
Thus Apple's disk operating system only uses every other position, or 
phase, yielding a forty-eight TPI or thirty-five-track drive. Many soft- 
ware protection schemes make use of these in-between positions, or half- 
tracks: therefore, to be completely "Apple compatible," a drive must 
have this ninety-six TPI compatibility. 

The magnetic head within a drive sits in a small carriage that rides 
along a metal rail. This keeps the head tangential to the disk recording 
(just like those straight-line tracking phonograph turntables). Linking the 
carriage to the stepper motor is usually accomplished in one of three 
ways: by means of a plastic cam, a lead screw, or a metal band. 

The least expensive approach is to attach a small plastic disk, or cam, 
to the stepper motor. Molded into the top of this disk is a spiral groove. 
A small ball bearing attached to the carriage rides in this groove. Thus, 
as the cam rotates, the head moves in and out. With this type of coup- 
ling, there is a significant amount of sloppiness, or play, and this limits the 
accuracy of the head positioning. By the way, it is this plastic cam that 
causes most of the noise (especially those squeaks) when the head is 
changing tracks. 

Another limitation of cam drive is the time it takes to step from track 
to track or over multiple tracks. For reliable operation, the carriage 
should have at least thirty-five milliseconds to move one track. Because 
of this, Apple DOS has a built-in delay routine that waits forty msec, for 
track-to-track stepping. Even with DOS's clever accelerate/decelerate 
positioning software, this yields an average access time of about two hun- 
dred msec. 

Other Head Positioners. Many of the newer drives have now gone 
to a lead screw-type positioner. This works on the same principle as the 
bench vise and monkey wrench. The stepper motor drives a worm gear 
that runs parallel to the motion of the head. 

Riding on this gear, or lead screw, is an assembly connected to the 
head carriage. As the screw turns clockwise, for example, the carriage 
moves toward the inner disk tracks. The lead screw positioner provides 
more accurate alignment of the head and allows all forty tracks to be 
used reliably. It can also move faster, cutting the track-to-track access 
time down to fifteen to twenty-five msec. 

Of course, to take advantage of the extra tracks and faster seek rate, 



patches must be made to the DOS. These patches can stir up some diffi- 
culties of their own, however. For example, when you have a mixture of 
standard Apple drives and enhanced drives on the same system, the stand- 
ard drives will undoubtedly experience problems (such as I/O error) un- 
der the "improved" DOS. 

Another problem with the patches is that they may conflict with 
other modifications to the DOS. The biggest annoyance may be that 
most of your favorite programs, which use their own modified DOS for 
protection, cannot take advantage of the drive's extra capabilities. But 
even under standard DOS, these improved drives should perform as well 
as standard drives, if not better. 

Another mechanism, the band positioner, has found its way into at 
least one of the Apple-compatible drives. This type of positioner offers 
even greater accuracy and speed by providing an almost direct coupling 
between the stepper motor and the carriage. 

Essentially, the carriage supports a long, narrow metal band that 
loops around a drive pulley exiting from the stepper motor. The special 
shape of the band allows a small screw to fix the band securely to the pul-

and Micro-Sci's controller. 



ley to prevent slippage. With virtually no mechanical constraints to slow 
it down, the band positioner can achieve track stepping in less than five 
msec. 

Beyond the three types of positioners already described, there are 
more exotic techniques such as the voice coil positioner, which provides 
motion in the same manner as the cone of a loudspeaker. This can over- 
come even the shortcomings of a stepper motor, but only at a much high- 
er cost. The advantages of these techniques are questionable for the 5 '/4- 
inch floppy format. 

The Contenders. For purposes of this overview, we evaluated several 
of the disk drives currently available for the Apple. A Dymek alignment 
disk and disk sf)eed program were used to check quality control on the 
subject drives. Current measurements were taken and overall drive noise 
was evaluated. Finally, we looked at the length of the connecting cable 
and whether it was shielded or not. This may prove important in 
multidrive systems, especially where you have an interference problem. 
All the drives we evaluated are styled to match the Apple and include 
beige cabinets. 

Apple Disk II. The Disk II, a thirty-five-track cam-positioned drive, 
is essentially a stripped-down version of a Shugart SA400 or equivalent. 
All Disk lis now come with a shielded cable about twenty inches long. 
Current retail price of a drive, without controller, is $525; with control-

Lobo Drives Model 3101. The Lobo drive is an exact replacement 
for the Disk II. It uses the same type of drive mechanism, a similar 
analog board, and works equally well with an Apple disk controller card 
or Lobe's own 3.2 to 3.3 switchable boot controller. An interesting fea- 
ture of the Lobo products is that one pin of the disk cable connector is 
keyed to a cutoff pin on the controller connectors, making it impossible 
to plug the cable in backward. 

Unfortunately, you can still connect the cable missing an entire row 
of contacts; powering up the computer under this circumstance is guar- 
anteed to blow a chip on the analog board. The Lobo drive comes with 
a thirty-inch unshielded cable and is priced at $385. With the 13/16 sec- 
tor controller the price is $455. 

Interface Inc. Drive. An Apple-compatible drive available from In- 
terface Inc. uses an upgraded forty-track version of the SA400, the 
SA390. For those with an appetite for variety, this drive comes with a 
case in one of eight different colors. The price is also quite attractive: 
$325 for a single drive (with a thirty-six-inch unshielded cable). It uses a 
standard Apple controller card. 

Micro-Sci A2 and A40. The A2 drive from Micro-Sci is another 
Disk II replacement. It rated very well in our alignment test and sells for 
$479. This includes a twenty-eight-inch unshielded cable. 

The A40 is a forty-track, band positioned drive that is not Apple 
compatible without a special controller card (used by the seventy-track 
Model A70) that comes with various utilities on disk. These utilities are 
mainly used to modify DOS, Pascal, and CP/M to take advantage of the 
extra tracks and faster seek rate (five msec). The A40 is the fastest drive 
we tested. Other utilities are provided to modify FID, CopyA, and 
other Apple utilities to perform correctly with the extra tracks. A com- 
plete user manual is included that details all operations with both stand- 
ard DOS and modified DOS. 

The Micro-Sci controller card can handle two drives and includes a 
jumper to select either thirteen-sector or sixteen-sector boot code. The 
prices for the A40 (with twenty-six-inch unshielded cable) and controller 
card are $449 and $100 respectively. 

Quentin Apple-Mate and Fourth Dimension Super Drive. These two 
drives are almost identical. Both use the Siemens FDDlOO-5 forty-track 
drive with a lead screw positioner. Although these drives offer greater 
capacity and faster operation, neither manufacturer includes the DOS 
patches necessary to take advantage of these .features. Some other fea- 
tures of the Apple-Mate and Super Drive are disk-protection systems 
that prevent the drive doors from closing unless the disk is fully inserted 
and motor stall sensors that can prevent a burnout if the disk jams. 

Track zero switches silence the drives during recalibration, adding to 
their overall smooth and quiet operation. Of course, some people may 
miss all that racket that the other drives make; at least you know when 
they're working, especially when they run across an I/O error. 

The Apple-Mate is a very fine drive at a reasonable price of $379. It 
uses a twenty-two-inch shielded cable that will plug into any Apple 
standard controller card. The Super Drive retails for $329. The Apple- 
Mate and Super Drive both carry one-year warranties. Either would be a 
good choice for an add-on drive. 

Rana Systems Elite One. The Elite One is the first in a series of flop- 
py disk drives from Rana Systems. Looking a bit different from the rest 
because of its larger size, it is still stylishly designed to match the Apple. 
The only disadvantage in its greater height will be for those who use an 
Apple stand to hold their drives and monitor. The Rana drives will not 
fit into the small shelf. 

The extra size gives the drive a place to put two small LEDs that indi- 
cate disk activity and write-protect status. A small touch switch next to 
the write-protect indicator also allows you to protect the disk manually 
without having to remove it and place a tab over the notdi. A small jump- 
er inside the disk can be set to have the drive come up unprotected (like 
a regular drive) or protected when the computer is first turned on. 

Inside the Elite One there may be either a Siemens, MPI, or Tandon 
drive assembly. No matter which is used, the drive offers fast and accu- 
rate head positioning, forty-frack opCTation, and automatic power-down 
of the analog circuits when the drive is not being accessed. Another real 
plus is the small loose-leaf user manual that comes with the Elite One. 



This manual is quite comprehensive and includes sections on the hard- 
ware and software. 

Although the Elite One can be connected to any Apple controller, 
Rana also makes its own controller card. This, too, is a rather unique de- 
vice. It can control up to four drives (with simple patches to the DOS); it 
automatically selects the booting code for either thirteen or sixteen sec- 
tor disks; it offers improved data separation; and it incorporates power re- 
duction features. This last claim was confirmed by our current measure- 
ments: despite its overwhelming increase in circuitry, it drew only 190 
milliamperes from the -1-5 volt supply, as compared to 270 miUiamperes 
for the Apple controller. 

The Elite Enhancer disk contains several utilities to modify DOS 
for the Elite drives. Rana has solved the problem of mixed drive types by 
including a drive table within the DOS itself. This table is configured ac- 
cording to the type of drive(s) in each slot. When the modified DOS tries 
to access any disk, it first checks this table and then uses the proper seek 
delays for the type of drive. Of course, if you change any drives around, 
you must reconfigure the DOS to match. While this special DOS still has 
some limitations, it presents a most reasonable solution to the maximum 
use of mixed drives. The Elite One is priced at $449; the four-drive con- 
troller is $135. Extended warranties can also be purchased on either item. 

In Conclusion. The disk drive market for the Apple II is just begin- 
ning to heat up. Apple Computer has always been in a good position to 
supply the first drive to most users. Now, however, the improved fea- 
tures and lower prices of outside vendors are attracting the first-time 
buyer as well as the add-on shopper.

Softalk Presents Tlie Bestsellers 



The following letter was received from Ernie Brock, product man- 
ager at Sirius Software, and speaks for itself: 

"Your May Top Thirty list is in serious error. For that month, Bandits 
outsold Kabul Spy ( number 25 on your list) 24 to I but does not appear on 
the list. Through the end of May, total sales o/ Bandits were 1.4 times the 
total sales of Kabul Spy, which is pretty amazing considering Kabul Spy 
came out two months before Bandits. Minotaur and Kabul Spy were both 
released the same month and have sold equal numbers of copies every month 
since then, but Minotaur never appeared on the list. In the month of May, 
Flywars, Cyclod, Lemmings, Gorgon, and Jellyfish all outsold Kabul Spy 
by factors from 2 to I up to 4 to I , but did not appear on your list. I have 
sales receipts to verify the quantities. If you continue publishing the Top 
Thirty list as it is, you should bill it as Softalk's favorite thirty, not as the 
top thirty sales leaders. It is irresponsible journalism to represent this list as 
being based on actual sales figures. 

"As you are probably aware, the Top Thirty list is being quoted by pub- 
lishers in pitches to lure new authors, by distributors and retail owners to 
determine what products to order, by venture-capital groups to decide what 
companies are good investment risks, and by end users to determine what 
products to buy. Ultimately a product will sell on its merits, but with the 
vast number of new products currently available in the Apple market, your 
list is leading many to support products that are inferior or outdated. 

"I suggest that if you are serious about reporting on the best selling soft- 
ware, that you hire an independent accounting firm to audit actual sales.

The record industry has Billboard, the TV industry has the Nielsens, and ra- 
dio has the Arbitron report. All these are provided by independent, repu- 
table accounting firms. Since Softalk is one of the major voices of the soft- 
ware industry, I believe it is your responsibility to provide a more accurate 
reporting of software sales." 

The letter raises questions ranging from definition to methodology. 

The primary question is: At what point in an individual unit's life 
does it become a sale? To a software publisher like Sirius, it's a sale when 
the product is shipped to a retail store or a distributor. To a distributor 
like Softsel, it's a sale when it's shipped to the retail outlet. To the retail 
outlet, it's a sale when the unit passes into the hands of the end user. Sof- 
talk adopts this latter definition. 

Any other method leaves open room for obvious misinterpretations. 
In the case of Sirius itself, distributors have standing orders for x amount 
of each new entertainment product the company releases. Should we 
then assume that every product put out by Sirius Software finds equal 
favor in the marketplace? Clearly not, nor would anyone be justified in 
drawing that inference. 

In the case of distributor sales, those sales represent the expectation 
by the retailer that they can sell a given product at a certain level. Should 
we then draw the inference that they did? Empirical evidence tells us that 
such an inference would be false. 



Two cases in pwint are relative to the controversy. First consider Drag- 
on Fire from Level- 10. They claimed to have shipped nine thousand 
pieces in their initial release, and we have no reason to doubt them any 
more than we have reason to doubt the ratios cited in the letter above. 
Should Softalk then have reported Dragon Fire as the number-one sell- 
er? It was not, nor did Softalk so report. Parent company Dakin-5 was 
forced into bankruptcy by just such overshipping. 

DB Master from Stoneware is another case in point. When Stone- 
ware first started delivering DB Master in quantity, they would ecstati- 
cally relay to Softalk the huge numbers being shipped. As the weeks, and 
then months, went by without the Softalk poll reflecting those numbers, 
it became a matter of speculation as to whether Stoneware was inflating 
their shipping figures or the poll was not properly capturing the sales. 
Neither was the case. In the third month after Stoneware started ship- 
ping, the end users started buying. In effect, the pipeline was three 
months long. Incidentally, Softalk's poll results reflected Stoneware's 
claims almost unit for unit after taking into account that three- 
month lag.

The marketplace can best be viewed as a pipeline, with publishers 
pouring product into the supply end, distributors providing the energy to 
move the product through the pipe, the retailer controlling the spigot at 
the consumer end, and the end user being the ultimate object of all that 
expended effort. The length of the pipeline is measured in units of time as 
opposed to units of distance. 

In the best of all possible worlds, the pipeline would be instanta- 
neous; that is, a product moved fi-om a publisher's wardiouse would be a 
product in an end user's hands. Not only is that not true, it is not true 
that a product in a distributor's hands is a product in the dealer's hands. 
During the very poll in question, a Chicago retailer was questioned about 
why he wasn't moving a certain product that was heading the lists of 
West Coast retailers who used the same distributor. His response? "We 
haven't received that yet." The lag time for the distributor to serve his 
midwestern accounts mth this product was three weeks. In this case, the 
time differential meant that some stores were reporting sales of the item 
in May while other stores were not. 

A very realistic scenario would be that the publisher finished the 
product in April, shipped to the distributor in May, but some of his peak 
sales were not reflected in the marketplace until June. Such a product 
may show up as fifteenth on the chart for two months, whereas had all 
the sales been in one or the other of the months, it would be number two 
or three. A weaker product might not show either month, although the 
sales lumped in one month might have rated a bottom rung on the Top 
Thirty. 

Another variable is shelf life. Once moved to the dealer, how long 
does the product sit before being purchased? Shelf life is both a positive

and a negative nieasiireinent. If the product never sells, such as Dragon 
Fire, shelf lite is the kiss of death. But if the product, or the product line, 
is so reliable that the deiiler is willing to order more than a couple of test 
units, then shelf life is a positive measurement of the market's view of 
that product or product line. Companies that benefit from their reputa- 
tion are Sirius and Strategic Simulations, among others. Dealers know 
products from these compiuiies will sell, and therefore buy in larger 
quantities, in essence stockpiling against future sales. 

Companies without that kind of reputation sell in smaller quantities 
to the dealer. But there is no inference there that the end user is more 
enamored of one product than the other. The fact that the dealer has ten 
copies of Kabul Spy and three of Queen of Phobos is not an indication of 
popularity. If, at the end of the month, the dealer has eight copies of 
Kabul Spy and no copies of Queen of Phobos, Queen of Phobos did bet- 
ter. Sirius did better than Phoenix even though Queen of Phobos did bet- 
ter than Kabul Spy. Is that confusing enough? 

In the case of Bandits, very few of the more than one hundred retail- 
ers polled mentioned the program for May, although many more com- 
mented on how well it was doing in June. Sirius's pipeline is apparently 
longer than they realize. 

The letter writer is in error in assuming that independent accounting 
firms have any relationship to any of the measuring devices he cites. Bill- 
board clearly states that they generate their own data. Interestingly

enough, they do not consider only sales, but also radio play. Nielsen and 
Arbitron are independent companies, but neither is an accounting firm. 

In the music industry, the authentic measuring stick is the Recording 
Industry Association of America. The RIAA certifies records platinum 
or gold, depending on their sales. The RIAA depends on the sales data of 
the various distributing companies for its data; as a result, its certifica- 
tions became a laughingstock, represented by the phrase, "He shipped 
platinum and returned gold." In record parlance, this means the distrib- 
utor cajoled retail outlets to accept a million units, but had to take back 
five hundred thousand. 

In an effort to reestablish the credibility of their certification, RIAA 
now waits six months to conduct a sales audit on any title to ensure that 
the returns have been properly logged in. 

There are two lessons to be learned from the RIAA experience: First, 
that moving product is not the same as making sales. Second, that music 
business executives were not above using misleading data for their own 
purposes. Why should we grant software publishers higher human at- 
tributes? 

The question of Nielsen and Arbitron is even more interesting. Both 
measure television audiences, and it is a little-known fact that there was a 
fairly wide discrepancy between what they reported for local Channel 7 
news and Channel 4 news in Los Angeles. Depending on which service 
you subscribed to, you'd find Channel 7 way ahead or Channel 4 win- 
ning a neck-and-neck contest. At stake were millions of dollars of ad- 
vertising revenue. One of the channels even threatened a lawsuit to pre- 
vent what they considered erroneous information from being dissem- 
inated. It never came to that, and the disparity in reported results has

since narrowed, but to hold either of these companies up as a paragon of 
polling techniques is not pwrhaps as realistic as one might believe. 

The Softalk poll is conducted with similar methodology to the music 
polls conducted by Variety. A statistically representative sampbng of 
dealers — large, medium, and small — from all geographical sections of 
the country are polled. Whereas none of the information sources cited 
above admit to error or document their methodology, Softalk each 
month documents what percentage of sales is represented by the results 
and what probable margin of error may exist in the calculations. 

What use any person might make of the poll results is for that per- 
son to decide. We would venture to state that any person who made busi-

dangerously oversimplifying the market and inviting disaster. The Sof- 
talk poll does not predict what will be; it only states what was. 

Softalk believes its poll to be well-grounded fundamentally and as ac- 
curate as any methodology extant. It takes into account a far larger pro- 
portion of actual results than any other poll of its kind in any other in- 
dustry. It is not perfect; any results reported from partial sampling will be 
flawed. But to ignore such marketplace realities as shelf life and length of 
pipeline ignores fundamentals. 

The results for the month of July were pretty much status quo. Chop- 
lifter widened its lead over VisiCalc for the first place and there was other 
minor shuffling in the first ten places. 

PFS rose to third. Wizardry went up a notch to fourth. Screen Writer 
II dropped two spots to fifth, Snack Attack jumped to sbcth, Home Ac- 
countant dipped a peg to seventh, Apple Writer II slipped into eighth as 
the only newcomer to the first ten. Knight of Diamonds dropped to ninth, 
and DB Master was tenth. 

The strength of the Wizardry concept is shown by the basic game's 
strength vis a vis its own scenario. Now that the initial buying splurge on 
Knight of Diamonds has been spent, Wizardry has reclaimed the title as 
the most popular fantasy game in the Apple market. 



We think our new 
mailing list program 
is the best in the world. 
And we're not alone. 



1st CLASS MAIL. By Bob Schoenburg and Steve Pollack. 
Here's a pair of authors who may be software's answer 
to Irving Wallace. Wallace is the bestselling author who 
hears the murmuring of general populace and caters to 
their desires. Bob Schoenburg and Steve Pollack seem 
to have the same trait. 
Consider. 

The pair brought out Home Money Minder, a 
perfectly respectable home finance package. Then they 
listened to the user feedback. The result was Home 
Accountant, one of the phenomenal success stories of the 
first half of 1982. 

Around the same time Home Money Minder hit, the 
team also tested the market vi^ith The Mailroom. 
Mailroom never was the success of HMM, but the authors 
used the same technique — listen to the users and in- 
corporate all the good ideas. The result is 1st CLASS 
MAIL — a program that, incredibly enough, manages to 
live up to its double-entendre name. 

All of the above is not to accuse Schoenburg and 
Pollack of putting out the programming equivalent of 
stalking-horses to do their market research for them. 
Their original efforts do stand on their ovwi merit. They 
just pale next to the sequels. 

1st CLASS MAIL is so well thought out and so easy 
to use that other pubUshers who call their programs ' 'user 
friendly" should bow their heads in shame. 

SOFTALK got an early release of the program sans 
documentation. Yet a rank computer illiterate was able 
to apply the program to two separate uses with relatively 
little trouble. This is high praise indeed: that a novice 
operator could use a powerful program with no more 
than the screen menus. 

The program allows for twelve fields, clearly more 
than the traditional name and address of a mailing label. 
The implication is that the software can be put to other 
innovative uses as well. The built-in ability to sort and 
filter on any field or combination thereof enhances the 
chances that users will find multiple applications for 
the program. 

Continental Software will actually be publishing 
four versions of the program.* The one already in release 
is for the Apple II using floppy disks. A hard-disk ver- 
sion will follow. Both versions are pending for Apple III 
as well, awaiting the development of a rapid binary sort 
subroutine. 

1st CLASS MAIL is a first-rate program for special- 
ized data base applications.

SEPTEMBER 1982 



The other salient feature of the top ten is the presence of Apple Writer 
II. Apple Computer has been running a promotion in which Apple 
Writer II is bundled with the system at a cost saving to buyers. If the 
bundled software units were to be counted, Apple Writer would have 
been far and away the leader in July. As it was, the promotion also 
served to fuel sales of separate units of the program, although some re- 
tailers reported requests that Apple Writer be replaced by other word 
processors. 

The infusion of Apple Writers had a generally depressing effect on the 
rest of the word processing market, as evidenced by Screen Writer's dip. 
One exception was Word Handler, which actually climbed into the Top 
Thirty for the first time. Word Handler benefitted when Screen Writer 
was off the market for refurbishing and it's clear that Silicon Valley Sys- 
tems won't relinquish that momentum without a fight. 

Joining Word Handler as first-time entries to the Top Thirty were

Transcend from SSM and PFS: Graph from Software Publishing Cor- 
poration. Reentering the Top Thirty was Data Capture 4.0. 

SSAfs marketing strategy brought Transcend into the market more 
rapidly than would normally be expected of a communications pack- 
age; the company is bundling the software with a Source membership. 
That bundling enabled the program to edge out Data Capture 4.0 as the 
leading communications package. Southeastern Software's package had 
previously had a stranglehold on this segment of the market. 

In general, there was a slight resurgence in the marketplace in July, 
although entertainment software sales were still not too perky. This poll, 
the twenty-fourth conducted by Softalk, marks the first time that there 
were not at least ten arcade games in the Top Thirty. Part of the reason 
may be the lack of discretionary income of families during an economic 
downturn, and part of the reason may be the increasing use of Apples in 
dedicated business environments; but most retailers are blaming a glut of 
product so great that buyers are having great difficulty distinguishing be- 
tween the packages. In many cases, retailers report that this has resulted 
in the buyer postponing a decision or buying a different type of enter- 
tainment software. 

Unfortunately for the adventure programmers, theirs has not been

No matter who you are, your computer will 
become a more efficient tool, as you become

can help. Dramatically. 

But don't just take our word for it. 

Infoworld magazine had this to say 
about Lightning Software's Hi-Res MasterType: 
"MasterType is an excellent instructional 
typing game. We had fun reviewing it, and 
we highly recommend it to those who 
want to learn typing in an unconventional 
but motivating way." 

Infoworld also went on to rate Master- 
Type as Excellent in all categories. 

Good news for Atari owners!

on July 1st. Watch for it!

the alternate selected. For the second straight month, no adventure game 
ranked in the Top Thirty. The evolution of that genre at present is indi- 
cated by the absence of Sierra On-Line's (On-Line Systems) product 
from any position on the Adventure 5 list. Infocom, with their three text 
adventures, and Sirius, with their first two hi-res adventures, have dis- 
placed the once seemingly invincible line up from On-Line. 

The Coarsegold CTOwd didn't even rate runner-up position. Quality 
Software's AH Baba tracked sixth in July. On-Line's in no danger of go- 
ing south, however. Cannonball Blitz and Marauder )omed Screen Writer 
on the Top Thirty, General Manager gained the Business 10 Hst, and Lisa 
2.5 attained the Hobby 10 list. 

As with the Top Thirty, the specialty lists saw little change. The Great 
Plains Hardisk Accounting Series supplanted Denver's Executive Ac- 
counting System in the Apple III list. The Fantasy 5 list saw Wizardry 
and Knight of Diamonds change places with the other three programs 

Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 6.2 percent of the sales of 
Apples and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in August to ascertain their sales leaders for the 
month of July. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was number of sales made — such other cri- 
teria as quality of product, profitability to the computer retailer, and personal prefer- 
ence of the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in August represented every geographical area of the continental 
United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index 
number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is an 
arbitrary measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are correla- 
tive only for the month in which they are printed: readers cannot assume that an index 
rating of 50 in one month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in an- 
other month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus-or-minus 5.3 percent, which translates roughly 
into the theoretical possibility of a change of 4.03 points, plus or minus, in any index 
number.

holding their own. The same five programs remained in order on the 
Strategy 5 list, but th^ were joined by Rendezvous, which slipped into 
third place. 

In the Business 10, VisiDex joined General Manager as a new entry 
and the BPI General Ledger package edged out VisiFile for sixth. The 
rest of that list remained the same. The composition of the Word Proc- 
essor 10 list was the same, but the order was significantly different. Word 
Handler jumped to fourth, PIE Writer rose a notch to fifth, and Execu- 
tive Secretary rose to sixth. Dropping down were Sensible Speller to sev- 
enth. Magic Window to eighth, and SuperText to ninth. 

Transcend vaulted into third in the Home 10 list. The surprise entry 
was Electric Duet, Paul Lutus's two-voice musical program from Insoft, 
which gained seventh. There were no new programs gaining the Hobby 
10 list, although three programs that had previously been listed regained 
the charts. They were Penguin's Special Effects, Sierra On-Line's Lisa 
2.5, and Synergistic's Global Program Line Editor. 

If the market continues to fight off the summer doldrums and builds 
to a big holiday selling season, the amount of product available will ulti- 
mately be a blessing. Otherwise, it'll be tight belts for some software pub- 
lishers come winter. Di
