The Cat That's the Apple's Meow 

What one Connecticut man's 
done for his cat with an Apple 
is almost indescribable. He's 
got his whole house Appleized, 
too.

So, you think you're smart, eh? Just be- 
cause you can count turkeys or write short 
stories, you think you're pretty darn fancy stuff 
with these contests, don't you? Welcome to 
1983, pal. 

When February rolls around, everyone 
thinks of such mundane stuff as Valentine's 
Day, Lincoln's Birthday, Washington's Birth- 
day, and so on. Looks like a real yawner of a 
month, no? Exchange valentines, take a day or 
two off from work, and get ready for March. 
7mm 

No longer. The Puns 'n' Anagrams contest 
on page 4 is designed to help you learn about 
what a great month February has been in the 
past. Did you know that on February 4, 1913, 
the demountable automobile tire was patented? 
Or that the first sardine was canned on Febru- 
ary 17, 1876? Or that on February 22, 1630, the 
Indians treated the American colonists to their 
first batch of popcorn? Of course not! If you did, 
then you'd be working for Softalk digging up 
junk like this. 

Whether or not you knew those tidbits of 
trivia isn't important. What is important is that 
once you complete this month's contest you'll 
have a whole bunch of facts, just like those pre- 
viously mentioned, at your fingertips to im- 
press people with at parties. (Probably the last 
party you'll ever get invited to, but you'll be a 
better person for it.) 

The first part of the contest involves figur- 
ing out what the heck each clue refers to. It may 
be a person, a thing, or an event. All you have 
to do, then, is to write the answer in its appro- 
priate spot in the crossword puzzle. The person 
with the most complete puzzle will be crowned 



ceive $100 in booty made by our advertisers. 

The second part involves more than just be- 
ing clever, smart, or generally intelligent. It re- 
quires good research skills. 

Once you have the answers to the crossword 
puzzle, find out what each one has to do with 
this exciting month of February, and when it 
happened. In other words, if the answer was 
"French prayer," then you would immediately 
remember that the French people were granted 
the freedom of worship on February 21, 1795. 
You remember? Good. Then you write a brief 
description of it and the date it took place. That 
shouldn't be too hard; after all, so much hap- 
pened during this month in history that you'll 
have a hard time deciding where to start. 

Whoever compiles the most complete list of 
explanations and dates will win a bonus prize of 
$100 in Apple accessories. Sound simple? You 
bet it is; we wanted to give you extra time to 
send us Valentine's Day cards. 

And, because this contest is so simple, we're 
only going to accept the first fifty thousand en- 
tries we receive with postmarks on or before 
March 15, 1983. So get to work, and have(heh, 
heh) fun. 

Mail in your entry with this coupon or a 
facsimile to: Softalk Dates, Box 60, North Hol- 
lywood, CA 91603, postmarked no later than 
March 15, 1983.

Tips on Solving Puns V Anagrams 
Puzzles. If you were to travel the world col- 
lecting all the kind and thoughtful things 
you could, puns 'n' anagrams puzzles would 
not be among your souvenirs. In fact, these 
puzzles are downright mean, out to twist 
your mind and stump you at every turn. 
For example, pay no attention to the 
punctuation of the clues. It's intentionally 
not at all nice. 

Each clue actually contains at least two 
clues: a real definition of the word and a 
puzzle-type clue. Puzzle-type clues often 
have tip-off words you should watch for. 
Here are some types of puzzles and their 
tip-offs: 

Puns: tip-off is reference to sound, hear- 
ing; listen. 

Anagrams: tip-off is reference to strange- 
ness, confusion, being mixed up or stirred. 

Reversals: tip-off is reference to reversal, 
back, turn around. 

Hidden words: watch for prepositions in, 



within; inside. 

Containers: similar tip-offs as for hid- 
den words. For example, "club in short red 
pismire" could mean combatant — short red, 
or communist = com, pismire = ant, club = 
bat; put bat in comant and get the answer. 

Beheadings (either take the word left 
after beheading or the initials; beheading 
stable could render table or s): tip-offs are 
references to small size or duration; briefly, 
short, small. 

Double definitions: no tip-off; example 
would be "It's not true that I go to bed 
early" for lie. 

Charades: no tip-off; the clues define 
parts of the definition or syllables of the an- 
swer; for instance, Baryshnikov could be de- 
fined as "sounds like [tip-off— answer is 
pun] bull-less market [bearish] drove ballet 
dancer [real definition] to leggy joint [knee] 
with respiratory spasm [cough]." 

Let your imaginations run wild — at 
least, outside the square. Have fun. 31

The Complete 
Graphics System II 

. * * by Mark Pelczarski 

Complete Graphics System is written for the non- 
programmer interested in doing a wide variety of graphics 
and design on the Apple computer. Included are options 
for two-dimensional drawing, with lines, circles, ellipses, 
and an automatic 108-color filling routine. Also, you can 
mix text with graphics, with various colors, sizes, and 
spacing, and easily create Apple shape tables. Three- 
dimensional options allow you to draw, edit, and 
manipulate 3-D objects in perspective — without having to 
use coordinates. A 2-disk set of additional text fonts is 
available separately. 




by Mark Pelczarski and David Lubar > " 

This is also a non-programmer's package, but oriented 
more toward computer artistry. It's also an ideal 
complement to The Complete Graphics System II. It has 
a brush module that lets you "paint" using a joystick or 
Apple Graphics Tablet, with the screen as your canvas 
and a choice of 96 "brushes" and 108 blended colors. 
You can also magnify any portion of the screen 2 or 4 
times for detail editing, perform mirror images, exchange 
colors, and move parts of pictures to other areas of the 
screen. Also included is a packing routine that lets you 
store more pictures on each disk. 



Although both Complete Graphics System II and Special Effects are written for non-programmers, they are provided on 
unprotected disks, and instructions are included for using the graphics and machine language routines in your own programs.

and Chris Jochumson 



This one is written with the programmer in mind; for anyone who wants to put professional quality graphics in their own 
software. Fast machine language animation and picture drawing routines are included for use in your own programs, and 
they're extremely easy to use. Using the editors provided, you simply draw your own multicolored shapes, draw their paths, 
and combine up to 32 independent shapes with paths and starting locations. The result is a machine language animation file 
that you just add and control with your own program — it does all the graphics work for you! The adventure-game picture 
editor works the same way: just draw, save, and add the redraw routine to your program. It increases a disk's storage capacity 
from 12 pictures to hundreds. A tutorial manual is included with examples of controlling animated objects with joysticks, 
detecting collisions, and a multitude of other useful hints and examples. For samples of what can be done, see any of our game 
packages, including PIE MAN, Transylvania, and Spy's Demise, as well as those from several other companies using Graphics 
Magician for the graphics in their software. 

All of. our graphics products are on unprotected disks for your convenience. 

No fee is required for using our graphics routines in other programs. All our license requires is that it is stated that our 
graphics routines were used. We are also most interested in publishing good, new products, and beyond our graphics software 
we can offer further help to authors publishing through Penguin Software. 

Instead of offering our own superlatives, we recommend that you read what others have said about our graphics products. 
Listed here are some of the reviews we've found, along with a few quotable quotes:

off return with no time left in last year's Cali- 
fornia-Stanford Big Game, we believed it. But 
when we saw the final results of the Oracle '82 
contest, we said, "Yeah, sure. Tell us another 
one." 

Softalk Oracle's Believe It or Else. That 
Elizabeth Lewis (Richmond, VA) correctly pre- 
dicted in order the top three companies to make 
the most appearances in Softalk s Top Thirty 
bestsellers list is not surprising — anyone could 
have done it. But no one else did. Lewis picked 
Apple Computer, Broderbund Software, and 
VisiCorp (then Personal Software) to finish 
first, second, and third respectively, and she was 
exactly right. 

In 1982, Apple had thirty-nine Top Thirty 
appearances, Broderbund had thirty-eight, and 
VisiCorp netted thirty-four. Following closely 
behind were Sierra On-Line with thirty-three 
and Software Publishing Corporation with 
twenty-three. No big surprises there. 

The part that surprised us was that Lewis 
was also the winner of the first part of the 
Oracle '82 contest, predicting the Nielsen rating 
for the 1982 Super Bowl. Wow! A two-time 
winner in one contest was enough to blow us 
out the door. But here's where it gets really 
good. 

After figuring out everyone's scores for the 
final part of the contest, we tabulated the total 
scores for the entire contest. We showed the re- 
sults to Mr. Ripley, and he said, "I don't be- 
lieve it." 

You see, the grand prize winner of the 
Oracle '82 contest is Charles Lewis (Richmond, 
VA), Elizabeth's husband. Charles's final score 
was enough to blow everyone else away, and 
win him a shiny new Disk II drive. 

The secret of the Team Lewis's success is 
that both Elizabeth and Charles work in li- 
braries; she at the Virginia State Library and he 
at the J. Sargeant and Reynolds Community 



College Library. With the world's resources at 
your fingertips, you just can't go wrong. And if 
you thought the Lewises were brutal in last 
year's Oracle, keep looking for them this year in 
these pages. They want to win that new 
computer bad! 

Instant Replay. It all began back in Jan- 
uary of 1982. Charles predicted the Nielsen rat- 
ing for the Super Bowl to be 47.5. He was a 
mere 1.6 off the mark of 49.1. Elizabeth Lewis 
hit it right on the money. Next, Charles fore- 
saw snow falling on Manhattan Island for seven 
days between Groundhog Day and the first day 
of spring. He was short by only five days. The 
closing price of gold on the New York market 
the day after Labor Day was $481, a slim dol- 
lar above Charles's prediction. 

The Major Leagues provided us with not a 
single no-hitter, just as Charles told us. After the 
November elections were over, Charles had 
slipped back thirty-four points. His prediction 
of the number of Democrats and Republicans in 
Congress missed by seventeen in each party. 
And, finally, Charles predicted Apple, Sierra 
On-Line, and VisiCorp to finish as the three 
most frequently appearing companies in Sof- 
talk' s Bestsellers, getting two of three, in their 
respective places, for plus-seventeen points. 
Grand total, -24.6 points. 

Coming in second place was Jack Wilcox (La- 
fayette, CA), who was hot on Lewis's tail with a 
score of -32.9 points. 

And Liz? She finished sixth in a field too

large to count. Even though she won two parts 
and tied for first place in the no-hitter segment, 
Elizabeth lost most of her ground in predicting 
the price of gold and in November's great con- 
gressmen count. 

Her real clairvoyance came through quite 
some time ago. She knew enough to predict a 
winner — and marry him. 

Turkey Heads, Eat Them Up, Yum. 
Thanks are due to all of you who helped us 
round up our stray turkeys in the November 
issue. The correct number of hi-res gobblers was 
three hundred forty-nine, just enough for our 
hungry staff (we like to eat in large quantities). 

A special thanks goes to Carl Heimowitz 
(New York, NY), who is the winner of this 
counting contest. Several others also found all

ARE YOU STILL LETTING YOUR PRINTER TIE UP YOUR COMPUTER? 



While your printer is running, your 
computer is tied up. You can't use it 
for processing, computing, data entry. 
Nothing. All you can do is twiddle 
your thumbs until the program is 
finished. 

Pretty ridiculous. 

MICROBUFFER ALLOWS YOU 
TO PRINT AND PROCESS 
SIMULTANEOUSLY. 

You just dump your printing data 
directly to Microbuffer, whoosh!, and 
continue processing. No waiting. 

Microbuffer accepts data as fast as 
your computer can send it. It stores 
the data in its own memory buffer 
then takes control of your printer. 

It's that easy. 

THERE IS A MICROBUFFER 
ESPECIALLY FOR YOUR APPLE. 

Microbuffer II Gust one in the full line 
of Microbuffers) is designed to be 
specifically compatible with an Apple II 




computer. An intelligent interface card 
with up to 32K of RAM for data buffer- 
ing, Microbuffer II features on-board 
firmware for text formatting and 
advanced graphics dump routines. 
Both serial and parallel models have 
energy-efficient low power consump- 
tion coupled with a high data transfer 
rate. Print formatting functions include 
Basic listing formatter, self-test, buffer 
zap, text screen dump, fully program- 
mable control characters and 
transparent and maintain modes — 



to name only a few. 

Microbuffer II is simple to install — 
being slot-independent, it slips directly 
inside the Apple II in any slot except 
zero. The 16K model is priced at $259 
and the 32K, at $299. 

Other Microbuffer models include 
Microbuffer/ E for Epson printers and a 
stand-alone, in-line Microbuffer unit to 
untie virtually any computer/printer 
combination. 

MICROBUFFER FROM 
PRACTICAL PERIPHERALS. 

So what are you waiting for? Write to 
us for more information or ask your 
dealer for a demonstration. 

When you see how much freedom 
Microbuffer will allow, you'll 
understand why it's so silly to be 
without one.

lb Do It Right 

To make a Winchester disk for just Apple®!!. 



That's how we set out to design our hard disk for 
the Apple®II. To understand the needs of serious 
users and programmers, and to correct the errors 
of our predecessors. 

You want user-friendliness. So we wrote hard disk 
versions of Apple DOS, CP/M® and Pascal that 
are highly user-friendly and loaded with 
useful features. 

□ Auto-boot hard disk 

□ Menu-driven utilities 

□ Single-keystroke program execution in DOS 

□ Disk search with wild cards, and many more 

You want flexibility So we made every 
feature variable. 

□ From 1 to 16 operating systems on each disk 

□ Operating system spaces grow as needed 

□ Slot independence 

□ Variable size volumes (to 400K in DOS) 

□ Mountable and unmountable volumes (even in CP/M) 

□ Custom DOS allowed 

You want reliability. We use the leading drive. 
And Corona's unique data protection technology. 

□ DataGuard™ 32-bit error correction code 

□ FailSafe"" read-after-write and automatic bad-sector reallocation 

□ 2-level impact-protection packaging 



You want low-cost backup. So we wrote backup 
utilities that make floppy backup convenient. 

□ File compacting to reduce the number of floppies 

□ Volume selective backup in all operating systems 

□ Automatic diskette sequencing to ease floppy handling 

You want compatibility. We maximize compati- 
bility with existing software and peripheral cards. 

□ 9K interface card leaves main memory untouched 

□ Interrupts are allowed 

□ Boot protected floppies from slot 6 without removing hard disk 

□ Automatic slot/drive to hard disk remapping 

And you want support. We do that right too. 

□ Hardware depot service in every region 

□ Software theft-protection on the hard disk 

Compare the features that matter to you. 
And visit our local dealer or distributor for 
a demonstration. You'll see the difference 
specialization makes.

500% Faster Loading of Textfiles , Integer, Applesoft & Binary 
and Now Six Powerful Extra Commands in Standard DOS 3.3 



30 out of 60 bought it on the spot when DAVID-DOS ™ was 
demonstrated at the Original Apple Corps, UCLA. 



Automatically supports an Integer or Apple- 
soft Rom Card in any slot (without configuring). 

Six New Commands 

1. TLOAD Speed loads all Text Files. 

2. TLIST Lists all Text Files to screen/printer. 

3. DUMP Binarv/Ascii to screen or printer. 

4. DISA Disassembles Binary to screen/printer. 

5. AL Prints program Address & Length. 

6. HIDOS DOS moves itself to Language Card 

Like Other DOS Commands 

These six commands operate identical to ex- 
isting DOS commands. Use A or AS for address 
and L or L$ for length. Enter them on (he 
Keyboard and use them in Basic programs with 
the familiar D$. 

100 Sectors in 7 Seconds 

TLOAD loads a Visacalc Template of a hundred 
sectors in 7 seconds and TLIST scrolls ii to 
screen or printer. TLOAD speed loads Se- 
quential and Random Text Files starting at 
$1000 or as specified bv A. It loads the entire 
file or a smaller length specified bv L. 

List Any Textf ile 

TLIST lists Sequential and Random Text Files 
to screen and printer.

adding l OK of free memorv for programs. The 
Integer Card is still automatically supported in 
anv slot. $300 to S3D0 is kept free.

anv Hex sequence up to 31 bytes long and 
prints the addresses to screen. Hidos has an 
optional 8th command DATE configured for 
Mountain Hardware clocks and is useable in 
basic programs. 

Use with Most Software 

DAVID-DOS is totally accurate and speed 
loads without over- writing. Great care was 
taken to keep DOS standard and compatible 
with most software. All DOS entry addresses 
have been preserved. Only two routines were 
moved to allow more room in command 
tables. DOS is the same length. Init areas were 
used for DAVID-DOS.

Spinnaker presents 
Delta Drawing. 




An introduction to the 
modern art of programming 
using the ancient art 
of drawing. 



) Spinnaker Software Corp , 1982 



Kids love to draw. 

And with Delta Drawing, your children 
can have fun creating their own colorful 
drawings, and at the same time, learn 
about computer programming. 

Delta Drawing is much more than 
just a fun game. If 5 an educational 
tool that helps children develop their 
creativity, learn to write computer pro- 
grams and 
build an 
understand- 
ing of pro- 
cedural 
thinking. 





Easier to use than LOGO. 

Delta Drawing makes 
it easy for children to 
use the computer-even 
if they've never used a 
computer before. 

In fact, it's easier to use than LOGO 
turtle graphics. And Delta Drawing costs 
less than half as much as LOGO. 

With Delta Drawing, your child controls 
the Delta cursor, and the Delta cursor 
controls all the action. 5o kids can learn 
at their own pace while they're having fun. 
How your children will learn 
programming. 

With Delta Drawing, your child first 
creates a picture using simple, single- 
key commands, for example: "D" for 
draw, v t" for left, "E" for erase. 

As the picture is being drawn, the com- 
puter keeps track of every keystroke 
and records it as a program. 

Then, by touching the "T" key for "text 
mode," the child can see the program 



that was written. As children progress, 
they can begin to write their programs 
in the text mode and switch to the graph- 
ics mode to see their pictures. They can 
even switch back and forth 
between graphics and 
text modes. 

Delta Drawing will 
make your child comfort- 
able with the computer 
and helps develop proce- 
dural thinking-the kind 
of step-by-step approach 
needed to write programs 
and solve problems 
with computers. 
Get Delta Drawing today. 

Delta Drawing can be played on Apple,® 
IBM® and Atari® computers. 

It comes complete with easy-to- 
follow fast-start cards. And for more 
advanced users, a completely detailed 
instruction manual. 

You can save your child's drawings 
on a blank disk and even print them, 
if you have a printer with graphics 
capabilities. 

5o look for Delta Drawing at your local 
software store. Or write to Spinnaker, 
215 Pirst Street Cambridge, MA 02142. 

You'll find that when we combined 
learning and fun, we created a work 
of art.

that stand in a class by themselves: 
programs for your home from 
Computer-Advanced Ideas. 

For The Fun Of It 

As professional educators and 
programmers we've been proving 
for over a decade that motivated 
learners do best. Featuring full-color 
graphics, our animated learning 
games are fun. They talk like a 
friend, play like a teammate and 
teach like a tutor. And they stimulate 
eager young minds. 

Partners In Learning 

CAI programs come with a library of 
knowledge for your child to explore. 
But that's just the beginning. They 
also feature a unique authoring 
system that lets you create lessons 
on any subject, tailoring the 
program to your child's needs. No 
knowledge of computers is required. 
Our programs make sense to people 
— from 4 to 94 — and grow right 
along with your child. 

A Success In Schools 

Over 1800 school districts have 
chosen CAI programs to teach 
essential vocabulary and logic skills 
in a full range of topics. Our products 
get recognition— because they work. 

Head Start 

Your child's future begins with 
opportunities you create at home. 
Choosing resources that are 
stimulating, challenging and fun can 
be one of the best decisions you 
make. Ask your computer retailer 
for a demonstration of CAI 
programs and see for yourself how 
enjoyable a good education can be.

HAVEN'T YOU HEARD 
OF THUNDERCLOCK PLUS ? 





If you want to put 
your Apple® to work — around the 
clock — Thunderclock Plus is the solution. Just plug it 
in and your programs can read the month, date, day of 
week and time — down to the second — in any of Apple's 
languages. So your Apple can do any number of tasks 
for you automatically. In the office, the lab or at home. 

Most good software packages for business, data base 
management, communications and time management 
are made to read Thunderclock Plus. (It's compatible 
with DB Master* Micro-Courier** and VisiDex 1 , to 
name a few). So no matter how you use your Apple now, 
Thunderclock Plus can make it a more versatile 
and efficient tool. 

For example, with business or communi- 
cations software, your Apple can auto- 
matically access a data base or send elec- 
tronic mail when the rates are lowest. 

In addition, Thunderclock Plus can 
organize your disk files. Our optional 
DOS-DATER™ software upgrades the 
regular DOS on your disks. So every 
time a program is saved or a file is modi- 
fied, the time and date, to the minute, 
are stored in the CATALOG with the file 
name. Now you can instantly know 
exactly when your files were last updated 



Thunderclock Plus 
can even give you a sense of 
security. Or just make your life a little easier. With our 
X-10 interface option and a BSR X-IO* Home Control 
System, your Apple can turn on your lights, water your 
lawn . . .whatever you desire, according to schedules you 
create. It comes with our menu-driven SCHEDULER 
software. So it's easy to design and modify schedules 
that can run in the "background" while you have 
"hands-on" use of your Apple. 

Thunderclock Plus comes with a one-year warranty. 
Powered by on-board batteries, it runs accurately for up 
to four years without battery replacement. 

So now that you've heard of Thunderclock Plus, isn't 
it time you put your Apple to work — 
around the clock? See your dealer 
for a demonstration or contact us.

Format II. 
Word processing 
so advanced 
anyone can use it. 




Format II was tested for six 
months in the demanding 
arena of Wall Street. Dis 
tributed by local deal- 
ers to law firms, finan- 
cial institutions, and 
the like, Format II was 
used by secretaries and 
non-technical personnel. Overwhelm- 
ingly Format II was recognized as one of the easi- 
est and most effective word processing systems 
available in any form. 

Here's why Format II is unique among word 
processing programs: 

What you see is what you get. Format II 
performs virtually any editing and formatting func- 
tion you can imagine and displays on the screen 
the text exactly as it will print out — paragraphs, 
underlining, justification, page breaks. 
Simple to Use. You edit and format text with 
single key strokes. "D" for delete, "E" for edit, "I" for 
insert, "J" for justify etc. Easy-to-remember com- 
mands because they make sense. 




It supports all 
printers compat- 
f ible with the Apple. 

Shadow printing, bold- 
facing, proportional 
spacing, sub- and super- 
scripting are all available. 
Includes a sophisticated 
Mailing List. Stores and re- 
trieves names and addresses 
which may be printed on labels or incorporated 
into documents. Powerful "logic" commands allow 
you to select only those records which match 
specified criteria. 

And more. Format II is lightning fast and 
menu driven. Add them all together and it's clear 
why Format II has generated such enthusiasm. 
Now at a cost of $250, you too can buy the best. 

Format II is available from most local dealers. 
If not, ask them to contact us, or order directly and 
receive a 30 day money-back guarantee.

and spikes.

SYSTEM SAVER

By connecting the Apple II 
power input through the SYSTEM 
SAVER, power is controlled in two 
ways: 1) Dangerous voltage spikes 
are clipped off at a safe 130 Volts 
RMS/175 Volts dc level. 2) High fre- 
quency noise is smoothed out be- 
fore reaching the Apple II . A PI type 
filter attenuates common mode 
noise signals by a minimum of 
30 dB from 600 khz to 20 mhz, with 
a maximum attenuation of 50 dB. 



For Cooling 

As soon a c you move to 64K RAM 
or 80 columns on your Apple n you 
need SYSTEM SAVER.. 

Today's advanced peripheral 
cards generate more heat. In addi- 
tion, the cards block any natural air 
flow through the Apple II creating 
high temperature conditions that 
substantially reduce the life of the 
cards and the computer itself. 



For Operating Efficiency 

SYSTEM SAVER contains two 
switched power outlets. As shown 
in the diagram, the SYSTEM 
SAVER efficiently organizes your 
system so that one convenient, 
front mounted 
power switch 
controls SYSTEM 
SAVER, Apple E, 
monitor and printer.

SYSTEM SAVER provides cor-

It's the same old 
Apple IL 




For years, people have been 
trying to build a better Apple* II. 

It finally happened. 

Meet the Apple He, an 
impressive new version of a 
most impressive machine. 

The "e" means enhanced. 
Which means a bundle of new 
features: 

A standard memory of 64K 
(versus 48K) that's easily 



expandable. So you can create 
fatter files and crunch larger 
numbers of numbers. 

A new, improved keyboard, 
with a complete set of ASCII 
standard characters. Plus full 
cursor controls, programmable 
function keys, and a rapid 
auto -repeat feature built into 
every key on the board. 

Both upper and lower case 



characters. (And if you want 
to see more of them on the 
screen at one time, a low cost 
80-column text card is available.) 

Improved peripheral ports. 
Which make it a lot easier to 
connect and disconnect game 
controllers, printers and all 
those other wonderful things 
that go with an Apple Personal 
Computer. 



Except for the front, 



back and 



ins 



ide* 




Self-diagnostics. That's a 
special feature that makes it 
easy to give your computer a 
thorough check-up. 

Plus an even more reliable 
design. Achieved by reducing 
the number of components— 
which is to say, the number of 
things that could go wrong. 



And bear in mind, the lie 
still has all those other virtues 
that made the Apple II so very 
popular. Including access to 
more accessories, peripheral 
devices and software than any 
other personal computer you 
can buy. 

So visit any of our over 1300 



authorized dealers, and see the 
newest Apple for yourself. 

Like the original, it's rather 
extraordinary. But then some 
things never change. 



The most personal computer.

Polemic from a Fellow Pawn 

As a subscriber to Softalk by default and part- 
time Apple user I find myself perusing Open 
Discussion for useful insights and tips on soft- 
ware or equipment. What I find immaterial, 
and occasionally disturbing, is the tendency of 
the editors, advertisers, and contributors to en- 
gage in flights of metaphysical fancy. This is 
often coupled to purportedly serious ethical 
wrangling over, first, the connection of a piece 
of software to the material universe (usually a 
game) and, second, the taking to task of the au- 
thor or producer of such an entity for engaging 
in some sort of pandering, propagandizing, or 
other manifestation of moral turpitude. 

The latest example is the hassle over Spit- 
fire Simulator (which I have neither seen nor in- 
tend to buy), and it has been preceded by simi- 
lar finger pointing and breast beating over such 
offerings as Muse's Robot War. Do the editors 
of Softalk seriously believe there is a connec- 
tion between actual war and a computer simula- 
tion? Does the management of Mind Systems 
Corporation seriously believe that the use of the 
term "warmonger" would refer to the players of 
a computer game, that is, in the actual 
sense? 

I am willing to accept the notion of crit- 
icism of these products when there is a clear 
point of reference. For instance, if the graphics 
of a particular game are substandard, the point 
of reference would be the opinion of the re- 
viewer who has presumably seen many games 
and has a point of reference from which to 
speak. Moreover, that point of reference may 
not be readily transferable into objective data. 

As for the ethical poppycock and almost tear- 
fully defensive responses — if anyone out there 
really thinks that hi-res robots, pixelish planes, 
and binary bimbos need to be justified, then we 
must, by all means, take Parker Brothers to task 
as the producers of Monopoly, that Grand Guig- 
nol of capitalism that's used to brainwash the 
young into complacent tools of the cryptofas- 
cist elite. Better still, let's go all the way to the 
bottom line and eradicate chess, war game of 
war games. Comrades, we can save the ranks of 
the poor proletarian pawns from being callous- 
ly sacrificed at the whim of the evil king and 
queen! We will create a workers' paradise where 
all pawns will have equal rights to all shortages, 
and. . . .

Saluting the General 

Last February I purchased Sierra On-Line's 
General Manager and it has proven to be ex- 
tremely useful to me in my business. I've used it 
for order entry, invoicing, accounts receivable, 
and a host of other applications. Now I've got 
the 2.0 version, and any bugs that may have 
existed in previous versions have been exter- 
minated. In addition, the new version adds tre- 
mendous flexibility in reporting and the search 
speed is vastly improved. The manual is very 
clear and the program is versatile. My system is 
now up and running on a Corvus Omninet. I 
recommend it highly to other Softalk readers.

Documentation Diatribe 

There are software houses producing qual- 
ity products. It is apparent from their programs 
and accompanying documentation. In my opin- 
ion, these companies are the ones that will still 
be in the marketplace five years from now. The 
difference between a well-written, well-edited, 
and thoroughly tested user manual and one 
that was put together as an afterthought gives 
me enough reason to purchase one program 
over another. The days are gone, or nearly so, 
of personal computer users tolerating pro- 
grams that almost work and manuals that are 
rife with typos, misleading and confusing infor- 
mation, and slipshod writing and organization. 

Because there are software companies pro- 
ducing quality products, I have a choice in pur- 
chasing software for my Apple. I will never buy 
a program marketed by a company that thinks 
so little of the user that it sells inadequate 
documentation, when, for the same money, I 
can purchase a program that instills confidence 
in the image projected from a well-written, well- 
presented manual.

Double Your Pleasure 

I recently purchased The Accountant by Deci- 
sion Support Software. My aim was to pur- 
chase an inexpensive piece of software that 
would allow access to my business transactions 
for my secretarial business. I required a system 
that would do more than balance a checkbook. 
I wanted one that would perform basic ac- 
counting functions and be reasonably priced. 
The Accountant has met these criteria for me. 

Designed by E. Forman, who clearly 
demonstrates a keen perception of the user's 
needs, The Accountant utilizes the double-entry 
accounting method and requires the insertion of 
a key (series of pins) into the game I/O socket of 
the Apple II Plus. On first inclination I thought 
this would be too complicated for the novice. 
However, with just a few hours of reading the 
instruction manual and following the demon- 
stration exercise, I recognized the power of the 
program. It not only keeps track of numerous 
balance sheets for user-defined accounts, but it 
also provides several options of printing ac- 
count transactions. It provides codes and in- 
verted pointers for quick retrieval of specially 
identified transactions or accounts. Outstand- 
ing billings can be tracked by identifying them 
with a code. By setting up group accounts, a 
profit and loss statement can be obtained. I find 
that the use of the calculator is quite conven- 
ient when calculations are required before dol- 
lar amounts can be entered during a trans- 
action. 

The double-entry accounting method allows 



flexibility in defining accounts for specialized 
needs, and it was through The Accountant that I 
learned the importance and power of double- 
entry accounting. It's really not difficult. 

At first I was not comfortable with insert- 
ing the key into the game socket each time I 
used the program. Mr. Forman suggested using 
a zero-force port extender. One end fits into the 
game socket, and the zero-insertion force recep- 
tacle mounts conveniently on the outside of the 
computer. In this way there is no need to go 
inside; and the key allows the user to make an 
unlimited number of copies for business or per- 
sonal use. It's not at all inconvenient. The Ac- 
countant is an excellent program and well worth 
the price.

view didn't miss much, there are a few points 
we'd like to clarify. 

First, the file size in Zardax is not limited to 
13,500 characters. This is the limit only for 48K 
machines without an eighty-column card. With 
both eighty columns and a 1 6K RAM card the 
maximum is more than 30,000 characters per 
file. In addition to the eighty-column cards that 
were mentioned, we work with the Vantec 80, 
STB-80, Viewmax-80, Magnum-80, and others 
not yet available in the American market. 
Zardax is also available for the Franklin Ace 
1000. We are at work on support for RAM 
cards and other disk drives. 

Printer formatting normally is done through 
embedded standard controls. At last count 
there were something like nineteen different pro- 
tocols supported. We wish the printer man- 
ufacturers would standardize! In any case, sub- 
scripting and superscripting are not limited to 
letter-quality printers. The newer dot-matrix 
machines such as the type three Epsons do it 
nicely. 

Finally, the Fastalk column notes each 
month that our "considerable extras" include 
"communication by modem." Our telecommu- 
nications package, Zip-Comm, is new. It works 
in forty or eighty columns, at up to 1200 baud, 
and from within Zardax. It is, however, an op- 
tion and is priced at $80. 

Thanks again, and congratulations on the 
new post office- resistant binding.

I fully agree with your reviewers regarding Frog- 
ger. Sierra On-Line does not deserve good re- 
views just because of its being Sierra On-Line, 
regardless of whether the company has the 
rights to the "official" version. 

As for reviews in general, I would like to see 
a zero to four star rating system. For instance, 
four stars would go to a startling advance in the 
state of the art, three if it's just a cute idea, two 
would mean only buy it as a gift, and with one 
star you'll know it might as well be a blank disk. 
Even better would be a simple statement of 
whether the package is worth the money. You 
can cite good and bad points all day, but there 
should be a final, absolute judgment. I have 
read Softalk since the beginning and have been 
able to count the negative reviews on one hand. 
Aren't there any die-hard cynics on your staff, 
people who would find fault in all but four or 
five games per year? 

What about a simple list of the new prod- 
ucts for the month? Fastalk is a so-so idea, but 
when does Wizardry get a bullet? Graphically 
Speaking is an excellent column. Most, if not 
all, series on graphics have ended like this: Ap- 
ple II graphics— part 120 of 120: shape tables! 

All I have to say about Penguin's new non- 
protection policy is that, at $59.95, software had 
better be copyable and modifiable. 

One more thing: how about putting a 
couple of blank lines between software re- 



views — it would make them a lot less confusing 
to read.

Reasoning through Beliefs 

Fundamentalists will grab any pretext to put 
forth their fervently held beliefs. Howard Bal- 
sam's letter in November '82 Open Discussion 
gives cursory applause to David Hunter's farm 
article and then launches into an attack on 
evolutionary science. Because of the half-truths 
and misleading content I am prompted to reply. 

Mr. Balsam states, "It is truly impossible to 
scientifically prove or disprove any particular 
concept of origins." Then he goes on to imply 
that the scientific method requires an observer 



to make evolution valid. 

The scientific method requires tests, not nec- 
cessarily observers. When was the last time any- 
one saw a subatomic particle? We make test- 
able inferences to tell us the particle is there. In 
a like manner, fully testable predictions and 
retrodictions are abundant in all the historical 
sciences. To see the evidence all one has to do is 
put aside prejudices and look at amino acids, 
animal breeding, fossil records, resistant bac- 
terial strains, or similar examples from other 
related fields. 

Mr. Balsam also misused the often mis- 
quoted second law of thermodynamics to ex- 
plain that life cannot become more complex. 
This would leave one with the annoying prob- 



ASSEMBLER/TEACHER 



This program makes your APPLE* teach you assembler! We 
assume you know BASIC already, and now you'd like to learn 
APPLE* assembler. You need three things (two heavies and a 
friend) . . . 



1 . The APPLE II Reference Manual (heavy), 

2. A good 6502 assembler manual (another heavy: ask for both 
at your APPLE* dealer), and 

3. ASSEMBLER TEACHER, a friendly program that takes you 
right through the learning barrier! 



ASSEMBLER TEACHER will soon have you eating those manuals for 
breakfast. And you'll never outgrow ASSEMBLER TEACHER, since it 
has tools an expert can use even more than a novice. Here's how 
ASSEMBLER TEACHER works: 



• ASSEMBLER TEACHER prowls your APPLE'S memory page by 
page, drawing a map of what it finds. 

•ASSEMBLER TEACHER shows your CPU running in slow motion on 
your screen, so you can see exactly what the operations are 
doing to the registers and the stack (a great debugging tool). 

•ASSEMBLER TEACHER exposes the mysteries of hexadecimal, 
two's complement, character and other data representa- 
tions, instantly translating from any version to all others. 

•ASSEMBLER TEACHER gives you the concepts you need to 
cope with assembler, using simple on-line lessons that grab 
you by the keyboard and make you play your wa 
knowledge. 

•ASSEMBLER TEACHER is written by John Fairfield, 
a Ph.D. in Computer Science who regularly 
teaches assembler. A RAM 
Mini-Assembler is included.

UPDATING YOUR FILES 

CAN BE 
HARD WORK 





We all know 
it's got to be 
done. A new 
address for a 

company you deal with means 
changing the records right away 
A client gets married and 
changes her name. Another 

change that has to be made in the records. If you're 
faced with several filing cabinets filled with folders, 
making simple changes becomes a complicated, time 
consuming job. And if your mailing list is generated 
from those records, or if you rely on them for billing 
information, you'd better make those changes quick. 

Relax, DB MASTER makes updating records quick 
and easy. All you've got to do is call up the name of 
the company or client on the view screen. It takes 
about three seconds. When the record appears, make 
the appropriate changes right then. It's over and done 
with. Immediately. No retyping of an entire record. No 
anxiety. And as soon as you've made the change, say, 
from "Colleen Patterson" to "Colleen Smith," DB 
MASTER refiles it under the new name in the proper 
sequence. It's all over in less time than it takes you to 
walk over to the filing cabinet. 

And it's easy to correct, change or edit any part of a 
record. Imagine the time savings when you're 
constantly updating inventory or job records. 

We designed DB MASTER to make your life easier. 
Sure, there are other data base systems for your Apple 
II. But if you're not using DB MASTER you're simply

not getting all 
you could from 
your data base 
manager. 
Want more capability? 
DB MASTER provides it with 
the expanded-capacity Special 
Edition for Hard Disk to 
complement the popular floppy diskette version. 
And there are three powerful accessory programs. 
UTILITY PAK #1, for example, allows you to access 
other standard Apple files (including VisiCalc), and 
even change the way you've structured your files. 
UTILITY PAK #2 allows you to edit or change up to 
five "fields" in a single pass through your files. And 
STAT PAK performs statistical analyses on data in 
your DB MASTER files. Of course, there's 
considerably more capability in each of our accessory 
paks than we have room to talk about here. Ask your 
dealer for the full details. 

Stoneware backs up DB MASTER with a support 
staff second to none. Just give us a call. We can help 
solve your problems. After all, that's what Stoneware 
and DB MASTER are all about.

lem of explaining how a single cell can become a 
multibillion-celled human being in nine months. 
It also conveniently forgets that this law deals 
with a closed system, and that Ilya Prigogine 
was given the Nobel Prize in chemistry for 
showing that the influx of solar energy places 
living matter in a temporarily open system. 

Everyone is entitled to their personal be- 
liefs. Science, however, must deal with the 
acquisition and analysis of data and the syn- 
thesis of that data into the most logical theory 
currently possible. It serves no purpose but to 
confuse the reader when half-truths and misin- 
formation are used to support personal beliefs 
at the expense of science.

Selective Trash Picking 

This is in response to the letters in Open Dis- 
cussion from Lynn Leopard and Richard Nor- 
ling (November '82) and Charles Wells (Sep- 
tember '82). 

Richard, save yourself a lot of trouble and 
get the January 1981 issue of Call- A. P. P.L.E. 
Randy Wiggington presents an assembly lan- 
guage routine that does exactly what you want. 

Lynn should refer to my articles "Gar- 
bagemen Strike" and "Weed Out the Trash" 
in the August and November 1982 issues of 
Call-A.P.P.L.E. I describe an Applesoft pro- 
gramming technique called selective string pres- 
ervation. Proper use of this technique will elimi- 
nate the need for garbage collection altogether. 
Lynn's database sounds like a perfect place to 
apply it. Random-access database programs 
are very easy to backfit with selective string 
preservation. Every time a record is written out 
to the disk, you reset the string space pointers to 
where they were before any of that data was en- 
tered. In that way, the next record you enter 
goes into RAM in the same space as the one 
before, so you never run out of room. You 
throw away the old data as soon as it becomes 
garbage instead of letting it build up to become 
a monumental task. 

File Cabinet is another story. Since it uses 
sequential files the entire database must be 
maintained in RAM. This makes selective string 
preservation very difficult, if not impossible. I 
have experienced garbage hangups with File 
Cabinet but have not yet done anything about 
it. As Charles Wells said, garbage collection is 
the price paid for variable-length strings. But it 
doesn't have to be so painful! Perhaps the fast 
garbage collection routine would be the best 
compromise for File Cabinet.

Words of Wizdom 

Wizardry experts, help! Where is the entrance 
to level ten? Where are the stairs going back to 
level eight? I haven't found them yet; I get to 
level nine from the buttons. Is there an outer 
limit to level three? What good are the keys? Is 
the frog statue of any use? What are the re- 
quirements for a ninja? What good is a jeweled 
amulet? 

In Knight of Diamonds my current party is 
just now beginning to make level twelve of ex- 
perience. I have mapped most of level one. The 
dark area is one unknown area. I cannot map 
very far without getting killed. Can anyone give 
me some information on this area? Is it a 
requirement to be level thirteen before advanc- 



ing to level two? Does the shade of Gnilda have 
anything to do with the level one riddle? 
Matt Lentz, Blue Earth, MN 

You haven't covered every square of level nine, 
have you? You can't miss that entrance if you map 
the whole thing by being there. There are no stairs 
to level eight from level nine. Whatsamatta, you 
don't like elevators? Is there an outer limit to level 
three? Why, yes. The keys and the frog — try 
going without them. Ninjas are evil and very 
strong. What good is a jeweled amulet? What 
good is hitting a home run? 

The dark area of level one of Knight of Dia- 
monds is very dark. You need to map it. Go back 
to Wizardry and grow stronger. You should be

"electronic worksheet" 
throughout an organization. 

With this program, 
youU be able to leverage the

numerical. 

For example, the knowl- 




"Then, doing our departments

a uniform manner. 

It's so easy. They simply 
"fill in the blanks" on the work- 
sheet. In seconds, the pro- 
gram performs all the com- 
plex calculations built into the 
worksheet, and displays the 
answers to problems that 
could have taken hours to 
solve by hand. 

Everyone

It's equally at home with all popular personal computers. 
Such as an IBM PC or Displaywriter, an Apple, a 
DEC, an HP, an Osborne, a Philips, a Sage, a Tandy, 
a TI, you name it. It lets you develop applications 
that are portable to 8-bit as well as 16-bit micros. 



from one application to another, and even create your 
own library of utilities. What's more, the p-System's 
universality allows you to get your software up and 
running on new hardware as soon as it hits the market. 



And we don't mean portable just at the 
source code level, either. 

We mean you can develop your program on virtually 
any micro, compile to object code, and it's totally trans- 
portable. So you can design programs once, and you've 
designed for the entire market. 

The p-System then actually broadens your 
potential customer base. With no significant 
reinvestment in programming time. 
You can reuse program components 



It's about time. 

At SofTech Microsystems, we saw an industry-wide 
need for an efficient OS that could honestly call itself 
universal. So, in 1979, we delivered just that. The UCSD 
p-System. And we've been delivering ever since. 

As an applications developer, we think you owe 
yourself an OS that lets you broaden your market base 
and develop higher quality applications faster, less 
expensively, more dependably and more efficiently than 
ever before. 

All at the same time. All on one micro. 
Thanks to the p-System, finally, once is enough.

How To Get Stuffed 

I've got a couple of questions. First, does any- 
one know a way to load DOS into a language 
card? Second, how do the software companies 
get their products in So/talk's Christmas gift 
guide? 

Chris Riley, Pompano Beach, FL 

With one exception, any company that pro- 
duces or publishes Apple-oriented products may 
contribute at no charge to the holiday gift guide. 
Companies are asked to write their own product 
descriptions according to a format Softalk pro- 
vides. The one excepted category is discount sales. 

That Program Was Dipsy 

Since I have the Epson 80 with Graftrax I de- 
cided to try the program from the "Hi-Res 
Dumpster" letter that was in the December 
Open Discussion. After loading into memory 
the hi-res picture and then running the pro- 
gram, I discovered the printer would stop after 
about thirty-four lines. In reviewing the pro- 
gram I noticed that line 230, which makes sure 
that the high bit is clear, needed to be changed: 

230 IF C1 > 127 THEN C1 =C1 - 128:REM 
RID HIGH BIT 

Also, I would like to recommend The Other 
Epson Manual for the Apple II and the MX-80 
with Graftrax 80 from Cut the Bull Software of 
San Diego, California.

You Are What You Count 

I have written a program Softalk readers might 
be interested in. It was inspired by the hi-res tur- 
key contest in the November issue. We started 
out like probably hundreds of others diligently 
counting turkeys. We remembered all the 
rules — only count the hi-res turkeys, not those 
in pictures. After five minutes or so of this te- 
dious task a vision came to us. We knew right 
then what our mission in life was to be (at least 
for the evening). We were to help free people 
everywhere from ever counting another turkey. 
We were to write a hi-res turkey counter! 

With this quest in mind, we drew a turkey to 
help people identify what turkeys really look 
like. Once our turkey had taken shape we could 
see clearly how the program was to be written. 
To make a short story even shorter, we have 
completed our mission. The hi-res turkey coun- 
ter is a reality and we are entrusting it to Sof- 
talk\ care. Pass it on to Appledom and make 
this world a better place to live. (By the way, we 
got too interested in the turkey counter pro- 
gram and never did go back to totaling the tur- 
keys up.)

BSAVE TURKEY, A$60FC, L$C7 

Now, after typing control-C, all you've got to 

do is run the program! 

Valerie A. Floeter, Milwaukee, WI 



Snugly Debugged 

Paul Raymer's problem (December '82 Open 
Discussion) of missing material because of the 
goto statements in Softalk is shared by many 
readers I'm sure. His solution of using "Gosub 
page such and such" and "Return to page such 
and such" statements instead simply will not 
work, though! When returning to a page, one 
would eventually read on and get to the return 
statement again, thereby generating a "return 
without gosub" error. 

To avoid this problem, I suggest structured 
reading. Namely, have a simple stack where, 
before saying "Goto page such and such" you 
say "Push this page number." Then, when you 
finish reading an article, you say "Pop a page 
number." If the stack is empty, read on. If not, 
run "Goto page so and so" as you do now (but 
using the number you got off the stack). This 
concept will solve these reading problems quite 
nicely without further complications. 

By the way, I think Softalk is excellent read- 
ing. It's the best there is for the Apple. I don't 
know why anyone should complain about too 
much advertising. I usually read the advertise- 
ments first and the articles later in the month. 
Why don't you come out with a book compil- 
ing different articles into one volume. It would 
make excellent reference material. Keep up the 
good job; you deserve all the credit you get — 
and then some! 

Anthony J. Scriffignano, North 
Caldwell, NJ

Publishing software can be fun. 

Okay. It's a dog-eat-dog world. The power- 
ful and wealthy are as desperate as the poor and 
unimportant. Information has become the life- 
blood of our society, but its circulation isn't 
great. Everybody's looking for the answers or 
looking to get out. 

Okay. Times are rough. The movie indus- 
try is struggling. The steel industry is gasping for 
breath. International Harvester is losing more 
money this year than Daddy Warbucks made in 
his whole life. Unemployment is out of sight. 
And no one can say for sure when the tide will 
change. 

Chilly Willy caught the last train to the 
coast. 

Okay. We're under the gun. Living for work 
and working for a living. There isn't a lot of 
room for mistakes, and the pressure is intense. 

Okay already! It's bad, but at least one hope 
remains. 

Publishing software can be fun. 

"Penguins Don't Come from Next Door!" 
Penguins are famous for surviving in even ex- 
tremer conditions than our frosty economy and 
its persistent cold fronts. A penguin's native 
habitat is the frozen wastes of the Antarctic Cir- 
cle. The temperatures range from a pitcher's 
batting average to the total yearly rainfall in 
Death Valley. In other words, low. 

Penguins can't fly. Penguins can't rob banks 



V David Hunter 



When driving through rural northern Illinois it is 
possible to catch glimpses of the wildlife. We were 
lucky to capture this scene in Geneva, an hour 
west of Chicago. The denizens of the chilly 
mldwestern plains in the picture are neither 
penguins nor humans. They're software 
publishers. wBKKKk

or play hockey. Penguins are not normally baseball players. Penguins are 
erect, short-legged, flightless, aquatic birds. Fun as it may be, no pen- 
guin has ever published software. 

Penguins are boring, but they're cute. They nonchalantly peck away 
their lives in the most severe of Earth's climates. Penguins don't brag; 
they can't talk. 

Noble, but embarrassingly harmless, penguins are probably the de- 
scendants of some ravenous aquatic dinosaur. You say times are rough? 
Look at penguins. They're content to be shrimps who were once terrify- 
ing behemoths. They don't make war and they don't pay taxes. They've 
progressed little; they've digressed considerably. 



So who are these goofs who call themselves Penguin Software? Do 
they come from Alexander Island near the Bellingshausen Sea? Did they 
buy their first Apple at the only computer store on all of Rockefeller Pla- 
teau? Do they eat raw fish and dance on ice floes? Do they look E.T. in 
the eye when they stand up straight? 

"Hello. It's Just After 8:00 P.M. and Time for the Penguin on Top 
of Your Television Set To Explode." What kind of penguins live in 
Geneva, Illinois? That's where Uncle Bob and Aunt Betsy junked the 
Edsel when it threw a rod and rolled into a cow pasture. That's where El- 
vis stopped to change his belt once. It's so far from the big town, most 
Chicagoans think it's in Iowa.

FEBRUARY 1983 



\ O E T A I It 



Geneva is a hotbed of midwestern normalcy. Neighboring Saint 
Charles is even worse. One expects to meet the Ray Conniff singers walk- 
ing down main street. The local White Castle plays host to Michael Lan- 
don and Burl Ives. This place has got class and it's the last place you'd 
expect to find penguins. The nearest zoo is O'Hare Airport, thirty 
miles away. 

The small flock of creatures working out of a one-story house in 
Geneva, Illinois, are humans who merely call themselves penguins. Their 
leader is a curly-haired, bespectacled devil named Mark Pelczarski. 

What kind of leader is this Pelczarski? You need not go any farther 
than the name. Sandwiched between Pel and ski is the best description of 
the Illinois-born software kingpin — czar. Need we say more? 

Okay. Humans can be penguins, but can penguins be human? Can 
humans turned penguins be human? Does Tennessee Tuxedo dance the 
Charleston? 

The story of Penguin Software defies easy classification. Is it a West- 
em? A musical? A space opera? The only label that fits is comedy. And 
comical indeed is the continuing saga of Pelczarski and his flock of Pen- 
guins as they contentedly peck away in these times of economic woe. 

"They Don't Stamp Animals Property of the Zoo!" It all started 
when Mark Pelczarski studied mathematics and computer science at the 
University of Illinois in Champagne. Unbeknownst to the future head 
Penguin, another great programmer was absorbed in the university's 
digital computer labs at the same time. Pelczarski and Bruce Artwick of 
SubLogic missed each other somehow. Darn! We might have had Pie 
Man Simulator or Transylvanian Pinball. 

Wait, the story gets even funnier. 

After graduating from college Pelczarski taught math and computer 
science at Sycamore High School, a junior college, and Northern Illinois 
University in De Kalb. All of you who follow his column, Graphically 
Speaking, in Softalk can imagine what that must have been like. And all 
of you who don't follow Pelczarski's column, don't sweat it. 

Born and raised in and around the Chicago suburb of Clarendon 
Hills, Illinois, Pelczarski went for computers and programming like a 
penguin goes for the freezer. He taught programming for four years and 
seriously pursued the discipline on his own time. Early on he wrote a 
couple of programs for the Commodore Pet and had programs pub- 
lished in Recreational Computing and in Cursor, a magazine on cassette. 

In the fall of 1979, while at Northern Elinois, Pelczarski got an Ap- 
ple; two months later, under the guise of MP Software, he started to push 
Magic Paintbrush, the earliest predecessor of The Complete Graphics Sys- 
tem, at computer stores in the Chicago area. 

As fate would have it, programming won out and Pelczarski is no 
longer a teacher. The chalk and textbooks have been abandoned for Ap- 
ple and utility programs. 

The combination of his experience with computers, the fact that he 
had written good software, and his educational background landed Pel- 
czarski a job at SoftSide magazine. Striking his best Fleet Street pose, 
Pelczarski packed up and went to New Hampshire to be the editor, 
no less. 

Did he know what he was doing? "Oh no. I had done a little writing, 
but I had no journalism degree or anything like that." Pelczarski has 
trouble stifling a grin at the memory, but, floating to New Hampshire on 
a good-sized ice floe, puckish Pelczarski did well at SoftSide. 

"It's Odd, That Penguin Being There." Pelczarski met his future 
wife, Cheryl, while he was teaching at Sycamore; she was a student at 
Northern Illinois University. By the time they both headed off to New 
Hampshire, they were married. A graphic artist, Cheryl Pelczarski 
worked for a local art agency while Mark tackled the magazine 
business. 

Teaching at Sycamore, Pelczarski also became good friends with fel- 
low teachers Trish Glenn and her husband Mark. A year or two later 
Trish would come to work for Pelczarski, helping to found Micro Co-op. 

Pelczarski met his future business partner and soon-to-be fellow Pen- 
guin Dave Albert while at SoftSide. A real journalist, Albert knew little 
about computers and the two men learned much from each other. Some- 
thing in their personalities jibed, and a rare friendship developed, grow- 
ing stronger over the years. 

We must make note of the fact that an early, crippling fit of Pen- 
guinitis (a rare disease) struck Pelczarski while he was the editor of Soft-

Side. Someone who had seen Magic Paintbrush wrote a letter asking if 
MP Software stood for Mark Pelczarski or Magic Paintbrush. Pelczar- 
ski answered that neither was correct; it stood for Magnificent Penguin. 

You have to be slightly wacky to get into the software publishing 
business, and Pelczarski proved early on to be made of the right stuff. He 
loved the title Magnificent Penguin and it became his nickname for the 
duration of his stay in New Hampshire. 

All through his reign as editor of SoftSide, Pelczarski practiced pro- 
gramming and had a bunch of little pieces printed in the magazine. They 
were mostly simple games, easy animation routines, programs for mak- 
ing shape tables, and the like. 

In the middle of 1980, Pelczarski began entertaining notions of form- 
ing a software cooperative that would inform its members of the latest 
and greatest software via a newsletter and offer that software at co-op 
prices. The idea was to go back to Illinois and spend full time on the co- 
op, living off savings from his teaching days. If after six months it wasn't 
working, Pelczarski had had other job offers. He considered it a fair 
gamble; so he made the essential decisions and left New Hampshire af- 
ter only eight months. 

"Perhaps It's from the Zoo." So much for journalism. Except for his 
monthly ink slinging in Softalk, Pelczarski has done little writing or edit- 
ing in the last two years. Programming became his primary means of 
creative expression. 

That is, when he wasn't putting together the latest issue of the Mi- 
cro Co-op newsletter. In January of 1981, working out of his apartment, 
Pelczarski founded "the largest software cooperative in the world," or so 
the ads said. Eventually boasting more than three thousand members, 
Micro Co-op was and still is meant to be a source of evaluative informa- 
tion and software for the discerning buyer. 

The magnificent Pelczarski really thought that Micro Co-op was the 
way of the day. So much so that he sought ways to bring money into the 
business. Pelczarski the programmer went to work. 

In March 1 98 1 , The Complete Graphics System appeared on the mar- 
ket under the label Co-op Software. No one was fooled. The toddling 
baby penguin in the logo was hard to miss. Half a year later, that pen- 
guin would grow up. 

The Complete Graphics System was the first part of a trilogy of graph- 
ics utility packages that eventually became bestsellers. Boasting more 
than a hundred hi-res colors, 3-D graphics, the ability to create shape ta- 
bles with paddles or keystrokes, and the option of putting hi-res text any- 
where on the screen, The Complete Graphics System was heartily wel- 
comed, breaking into So/talk's Top Thirty in September 1981. 

Penguins can make mistakes. Pelczarski sold a lot more Complete 
Graphics Systems than he expected. The idea of seriously publishing soft- 
ware gained favor in Pelczarski's mind. Perhaps software cooperatives 
were not the answer. 

Birth of a Penguin. Lots of things happened in the summer of 1981 . 
The baseball strike was settled. Raiders of the Lost Ark thrilled millions. 
Raster Blaster cleaned up. These are all minor events in the long run. For 
this was the summer that Penguin Software was born. 

While Pelczarski flapped around starting Penguin, Trish Glenn took 
over the operations of Micro Co-op. She has been incredibly valuable, 
according to Pelczarski, and can lay claim to being the first true Penguin 
other than Mark and Cheryl. "She's the one that gets things done," Pel- 
czarski says. 

Pelczarski suffered from Penguinitis all that year. When he thought 
of an image for his company, all his Spheniscidae mind could conjure up 
were penguins. In delirious moments he admits that he truly came to ap- 
preciate penguins with the help of the irreverent English comedy group 
Monty Python. Their funky vignette "Penguin on the TV," on the al- 
bum Another Monty Python Album, has haunted Pelczarski for years. 

Another Monty Python routine, which has Scott of the Antarctic 
battling a giant electric penguin, doesn't seem to bother Pelczarski at all. 
For whatever reason, demented or deliberate esthetic choice, penguins it 
was going to be. 

Still working out of his apartment, Pelczarski programmed like 
crazy, mainly in Basic and assembly language, through the summer 
of 1981. 

"Each of the graphics programs is a combination of languages. The 
editors are written in Applesoft, while the graphics routines are in assem- 



T A L K FEBRUARY 1983 

bly language," Pelczarski explains. "I like Basic because it's easier to un- 
derstand when debugging. There are also a lot more utilities for it." 

His next offering through the newly born Penguin Software, Special 
Effects, appeared in September 1981. Another graphics utility, dubbed 
"for the artist" in subsequent ad campaigns, Special Effects allows you to 
paint, more or less, on the Apple with many useful features including 
shading, magnification, color reversing, and partial screen movement. 

Wizards and Penguins. The third part of Penguin's graphics trilogy, 
this one "for the programmer," was released at the beginning of 1982. 
Originally credited to Chris Jochumson, Mark Pelczarski, and friend, 
The Graphics Magician contains the collected wit and machine language 
animation routines for the creation of computer games and other pro- 
grams needing quick manipulation of visual elements. Friend was 
eventually revealed to be David Lubar, who is now programming for 
Sirius. 

For a good part of 1982, the trilogy was really a tetralogy with the 
Space Tablet, produced by Micro Control Systems, rounding out the 
foursome. Boasting 2-D and 3-D drawing capabilities, Micro Control's 
graphics tablet came complete with a customized version of The Com- 
plete Graphics System designed to accept input from three dimensions. 

"I agreed to be the distributor, but Micro Control kept changing de- 
signs in the hardware," says Pelczarski. "We like to fill orders in the next 
day's mail, but the difficulties of hardware changes made keeping up 
with the demand difficult. Eventually, we worked it so that people now 
go directly to Micro Control for the system." 

Albert had taken over as editor of SoftSide when Pelczarski quit, but 
he left for a stint as a proofreader of "trashy adult Westerns. My big 
claim to fame," he says, "is having proofread Halloween //." Albert had 
been back at SoftSide for a month when Pelczarski called. It was the end 
of 1 98 1 . Reeling from success, Pelczarski asked Albert to come work in 
Geneva. 

Born in Venezuela, Albert began his journalism career on an English 
language newspaper, The Daily Journal, in Caracas. Destroying the myth 
that penguins don't like to travel around, Albert has lived in Vene- 
zuela, New Hampshire, Connecticut, the Bahamas, Switzerland, Los An- 
geles, and Iowa. 

Albert attended college at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, with a 
double major in journalism and American studies, emphasizing commu- 
nications theory. He met his future wife, Mary Locke, while at the uni- 
versity. She was a photographer on the university's student paper, The 
Daily Iowan, when Albert was the managing editor. The two worked to- 
gether at SoftSide and both succumbed to Penguinitis at the same time. 

Ms. Penguin. Today Mary Locke is one of the key Penguins, defin- 
ing the experience and ensuring that future Penguins will keep the faith. 
She takes care of the dealers while Albert and Pelczarski drink beer. A 
little taller than one would expect a penguinized human to be, Locke has 
a lively sense of humor and believes wholeheartedly that publishing soft- 
ware is fun. 

Albert came on in the beginning of the year to take the pressure off 
Pelczarski, taking over the operations of Micro Co-op and its newslet- 
ter. In the summer of 1982, Pelczarski sold Micro Co-op and he and Al- 
bert ceased having any involvement with the business. 

Since then, Albert has participated in Penguin's daily activities, main- 
ly handling the marketing. Not a programmer, Albert has, nonetheless, 
had some input into Penguin's products. He rewrote the text for the 
graphic adventure Transylvania and carries his load of the never-ending 
task of testing and retesting a new program before it's released. 

Only a few months ago, Penguin Software moved out of Pelczarski's 
home into a single-story house on Hamilton in Geneva. Albert and Pel- 
czarski share an office in the living room. Pelczarski still spends time at 
home programming, but the rest of the Penguins flock daily to the of- 
fice/house. The kitchen refrigerator is well-stocked with beer and the 
cupboards with M&M's. 

As fun as publishing software is, there are bound to be some sore 
spots. The Penguin people have met head on the single most difficult 
problem in the industry — piracy. In March 1982, Pelczarski wrote a let- 
ter to several publications announcing a change in Penguin's policy to- 
ward software protection. 

Coinciding with the release of The Graphics Magician and the up- 
dated Complete Graphics System II, Penguin's announcement was a plea 



YOUR APPLE CAN RUN UP TO 
TWENTY TIMES FASTER 
FOR ONLY $79.95 
WITH RESULTS GUARANTEED! 

If you take the time to read this message, 
you'll learn how to save 50 or more seconds 
out of every minute of execution time for 
every program you write or use. 

ANNOUNCING: 
THE EINSTEIN COMPILER— The new 
compiler that provides an easy means by 
which Applesoft programs written for the 
Apple computer may be swiftly translated 
into machine language... 
...as a result, the compiled version of your 
program can be executed from 2 to 20 times 
faster! 

Benchmark tests reported in an Interface 
Age article have compared the relative 
execution speed of different versions of the 
BASIC language running on several brands 
of microcomputers. Based on these 
comparisons, if you are running programs in 
Applesoft, you are not even placing in the top 
third of the speed standings 
That was before THE EINSTEIN COMPILER. 

When the same test program for the Apple 
was first run through THE EINSTEIN 
COMPILER, the compiled program ran so 
fast that the Apple's speed standing jumped 
to second place, .being beaten only by some 
exotic experimental computer 

Thus, if you are an Apple user with THE 
EINSTEIN COMPILER, writing programs in 
Applesoft, you can now have your BASIC 
program judged second in the same speed 
comparison. 

THE EINSTEIN COMPILER is extremely easy 
to use. There is no BASIC syntax to learn, 
and 95% of your compilations can be 
performed with one simple command You 
need only load your program, insert THE 
EINSTEIN COMPILER disk into your drive, 
type "BRUN EINSTEIN" and then save and 
run your compiled program. It's that simple. 
It's that fast. 

THE EINSTEIN COMPILER is a 
breakthrough in new programming utilities 
that rapidly translates your Applesoft 
programs into machine language that is fast, 
efficient, and compact. When you use THE 
EINSTEIN COMPILER, all the features of 
Applesoft are fully supported, including the 
use of Hi-Res graphics, shape tables, Lo-Res 
graphics, defined functions and DOS 
commands. Moreover, THE EINSTEIN 
COMPILER is the most powerful compiler on 
the market in its level of code compression 
and string handling capabilites 

Here are the more impressive 

features of 
THE EINSTEIN COMPILER: 

EASE OF USE: The program is 
professionally human engineered. Thus 
although the compiler is very powerful, it is 
incredibly easy to use by beginners and 
experts alike. Clear, comprehensive 
documentation is provided. 



DOS COMPATIBILITY: All DOS functions 
and commands are supported in exactly the 
same way as in the uncompiled Applesoft 
program 

CODE COMPRESSION: a unique memory 
compression algorithm is employed and pre- 
existing Applesoft routines are exploited to 
keep the size of your compiled program to an 
absolute minimum. 

STRING HANDLING: The fastest dynamic 
string handling available; static string 
handling for passing strings between 
program modules 

MEMORY CONTROL: Complete control over 
memory usage; programs and run-time 
library can be compiled to reside in almost 
any memory location. 
LOCAL / GLOBAL VARIABLES: 
Variables (including strings) may be 
designated as "local" to a compiled program 
or "global" to all compiled programs in 
memory, thereby facilitating inter-program 
communications. 

COMPILATION STATISTICS: Complete statis- 
tics are generated at compile-time such as total 
memory requirement, symbol table listing inclu- 
ding memory addresses for all variables, starting 
address of the compiled code for each line of the 
Applesoft program, etc. 
PROGRAM DEBUGGING: Erroneous state- 
ments are flagged with standard error 
messages, and you have the option to stop 
compilation at any time; debugging of 
compiled code is aided through use of such 
tools as TRACE capabilities and compre- 
hensive program statistics 
HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS: Apple 11+ with 
48K, Apple III, or Apple II with RAM card or 
Applesoft in ROM One disk drive DOS 3.3

to the software buyer. Speaking as a programmer, Pelczarski explained 
how he appreciates the need for applications software to be unprotected 
and modifiable. Speaking as a publisher, he voiced the fear that "cas- 
ual" copying by a few bad or, even worse, unthinking people can put a 
small company out of business. 

Pelczarski's overriding concern for the good customers won out. The 
graphics utility trilogy was unlocked and the industry held its breath. 
Would the Penguins perish? Had the answer to the piracy problem been 
found? If Pelczarski trusted consumers instead of penalizing them with 
the extra time and cost of copy protection, would they respond with the 
same honesty? 

If ever there was a clear answer to all these questions it appeared in 
the results of So/talk's Bestsellers column through the last six months of 
1982. The graphics trilogy was close to dominating the Hobby 10. The 
Graphics Magician and Complete Graphics System II both made the top 
thirty in December 1982's poll. The torrid sales were obviously buoyed 
by Softsel picking up Penguin's line in May. Still, Pelczarski's gamble 
paid off; people like to buy unlocked software. Honesty and trust 
worked. 

"There! I've Run Rings around You Logically." In the final months 
of 1982, Penguin turned around and offered two arcade games and one 
adventure game, all protected. It's a different story with games. 

"You can play a protected game," explains Pelczarski. "They don't 
depend on documentation like a utility program. That's why games are 
easily traded. 

"I also can't take a chance with someone else's program. If it's my 
own graphics package, then it's my neck. I can't gamble with another 
programmer's work, though the idea of unprotected games is ap- 
pealing." 

All three games — Spy's Demise by Alan Zeldin, Pie Man by Eagle 
Berns and Michael Kosaka, and Transylvania by Antonio Antiochia — 
were created with the aid of the The Graphics Magician. This is much 
more exciting than the predictable news that none of the games was the 
next Choplifter. Adventure International, Sentient Software, Sunnyside 
Soft, and other publishers have used Pelczarski's utility for produc- 



T A L V. FEBRUARY 1983 

ing games such as Gold Rush, Congo, and Scott Adams's Graphic 
Adventures. 

The big news is that Mattel Electronics's six new arcade games for 
the Apple use The Graphics Magician. They were first seen at the Con- 
sumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this January. 

So the times have been good for Pelczarski and his flock of dement- 
ed Penguins. There are seven Penguins in all, and they eat together and 
play together. Two favorite hangouts are the local White Castle, with its 
regionally renowned miniburgers, and Funway Park in nearby Batavia, 
with its bumper cars and arcade games. 

One day not too long ago, Dave Albert got wind that Funway was 
planning to get an Apple for interfacing with their in-house video sys- 
tem. Albert graciously offered a complete set of Penguin software in ex- 
change for lifetime passes on the bumper cars. It worked. Nowadays, 
when the job gets to be too much, several Penguins will relieve the ten- 
sion by smashing into each other in a friendly sort of way. 

Penguin Software is a small company that seems content to stay that 
way, at least personnel-wise. Everyone works hard and does whatever 
job needs to be done. Everyone has a reasonably well-defined niche, but 
emergencies do occur. 

Two fun-loving Penguins are Cheryl Pelczarski and Todd Porter. 
Cheryl is the one-woman art department, responsible for Penguin's ad- 
vertising and other forms of visual marketing. Strong distribution is one 
thing, but effective advertising can make a big difference. 

Todd Porter is the technical consultant. He works with customers 
who need programming advice in adapting Penguin's wares to a specific 
task. Just turned twenty-three, Porter looks to have a bright future with 
Pelczarski's bunch. 

Rounding out that bunch is Mary Beth Pelczarski, Mark's younger 
sister, and Trish Glenn. Fiercely loyal Penguins and vocal supporters of 
Penguin rights, the younger Pelczarski and Glenn are the customer serv- 
ice department and anything else that's needed at any given moment. 
Mary Locke, Trish Glenn, and Mary Beth are the three funny ladies of 
Penguin Software. Together and in a good mood they are a riot — in- 
domitable, powerful, and totally in charge. 

The Great Penguin Train Ride. What's it like to be a Penguin? 
Things get done, somehow. 

Mary Locke tells a terrific story about the Penguin trek to Applefest 
last May in Boston. When it came time to take a train from New York 
up to Boston, a few things went wrong. The train wasn't announced. 
Lugging boxes of merchandise and booth materials, Pelczarski and Al- 
bert barely made it on the train in time. Mary Locke and Cheryl Pel- 
czarski had gone ahead of them and got separated. 

The train was very crowded. Mary and Cheryl couldn't find a seat for 
themselves, let alone for the other Penguins on the trip. Eventually they 
found Mark and the others huddled on a vestibule between cars with all 
the boxes piled up precariously. This was how they rode the rails up to 
Boston. 

Every day, working together, having epic snowball fights when it 
snows, and eating M&M's are part of being a Penguin. After work, the 
whole company can comfortably go out for a drink at Scottland Yard, a 
local drinking establishment in Saint Charles. They lunch together fre- 
quently at the Great Dane Mini Deli in downtown Geneva. 

Camaraderie and esprit de corps among a group of people makes 
running a small business a real joy. Pelczarski is not a difficult man to 
work for. 

A little wacko perhaps, but not difficult. 

With two new games, Thunderbombs and Crime Wave, due out later 
this month, improved graphics software in the works, a few secrets, and 
one big surprise also due in March, Penguin Software is on course and 
flying high. 

Ah, if only it were true. But penguins can't fly. 

Penguin Software is on the ground and waddling ahead. Enjoying the 
winter weather and last year's profits, they are looking forward to their 
best year yet in 1983. Courageous and fun-loving, they must be on to 
something. 

Publishing software can be fun.

THE BASIC 



olution 



By Wm.VR. Smith 



A frustration commonly experienced by 
microcomputer users is caused by the ma- 
chine's inability to hold more than one Basic 
program in memory at a time. Whether you 
have 16K, 32K, or 48K of RAM on board, the 
computer's operating system just won't recog- 
nize the presence of two programs, even if the 
programs are tiny. Loading one while another is 
already in memory just wipes out the first. 
There seems to be no way around it. 

The problem is not lack of space. There is a 
lot of memory space in the Apple that the typ- 
ical Basic program doesn't take advantage of. 
The problem is that Applesoft always puts pro- 
grams in the same place unless you tell it 
different. 

Well, there are ways around this limitation, 
and this month we have a reader-contributed 
program to do just that. Ken Kashmarek of El- 
dridge, Iowa, sent in a program that tells Apple- 
soft where you want a program to start in mem- 
ory when you load it or type it in. 

Incidentally, starting your programs in dif- 
ferent locations can have other uses as well. For 
instance, when you're using hi-res page one and 
the program starts at the standard location 
(2048 or $800), you can only make the program 
so long before the variables start overrunning 
the hi-res screen memory space. That length is 
usually about twenty sectors on the disk (vary- 
ing according to how many variables are 
used) — a large program, to be sure, but there's 
much more memory left unused above the hi- 
res memory area. This program will let you use 



that space. Or it will let you leave a protected 
area below your program for machine lan- 
guage routines. 

The program isn't very complicated. Lines 
100 through 170 give you a menu of possible 
start locations. If you don't want to select any of 
them, just hit return and you'll be given the op- 
portunity to enter your own location. Hit re- 
turn again to exit the program. Lines 180 
through 240 handle these options. 

Lines 250 to the end handle the pointer set- 
ting to allow your Basic program to begin 
somewhere else. The operative commands are 
the ones that poke numbers "Into 103 and 104 
(the start-of-program pointer) and LOC (your 
starting location). 

Note: Save this program right after you type 
it in (before you run it). If you don't take this 
precaution, you could lose it.

end statement and replace it with poke 103, 1 : 
poke 104,8 : poke 2048,0 : run. This will make 
the computer go back to the menu. You can 
follow this procedure with several programs, 
provided you give them all enough space to 
move around in. Putting them too close to- 
gether could produce what the folks at Apple 
are fond of calling "unpredictable results." 

Before we sign off, there are a few problems 
with December's Basic Solution we'd like to 
clear up. Line 1800 of the Poker program 
should read 

1800 DATA "D ","C ","H ","S " 

And line 1940 should read: 

1940 HTAB HT: PRINT "! ";SU$(SUIT); " !" 

If you have any other problems, try taking out 
line 40. This will allow normal error messages to 
be displayed. 

Finally, Jeffery Jacobs of Canton, Ohio, has 
pointed out that the program doesn't handle 
royal straight flushes correctly. He sent us these 
new lines to correct it.

Dow Jones Software- 




Jones: "Mr. Dow, look what they're selling in that new store 

down the street: Dow Jones Software. You haven't gotten 
us into ladies' fashions, have you?" 

Dow: "No, Mr. Jones. That's a computer store, and our software 
products allow investors and business professionals to use 
a personal computer like this one here to easily manage 
financial information." 

Jones: "But what about our reputation? We've been leaders in 

serving the business and financial community for over 100 
years. Are you sure this new software will be as reliable as 
The Wall Street Journal and Barron's?" 

Dow: "Of course, Jones. Our software is so reliable we back it up 
with a full-year warranty. People trust Dow Jones Software 
the same way they trust the Journal. And we have a toll- 
free Hotline number in case they want expert help." 

Jones: "Couldn't that be a lot of phone calls? After all, we've got 
the Dow Jones Averages to get out every day." 

Dow: "Don't worry, Jones. Our software is very easy to use, and 
we have a fully staffed Customer Service Department to 



respond to our dealers and customers." 
Jones: "Just what can our software do?" 

Dow: "In a nutshell, Jones, with a personal computer, a tele- 
phone, a modem and Dow Jones Software, you can easily 
perform complex analyses on the information available 
from our information service, Dow Jones News/Retrieval®." 

Jones: "People really use our software to make decisions?" 

Dow: "Absolutely. Once you've stored the information you want, 
our software does the rest. For instance, with one Dow 
Jones Software product you can follow indicators for stocks, 
sort, rank, screen and set critical points for buying and 
selling. With another, you can easily construct technical 
charts. Look at this beautiful graph." 

Jones: "You mean all those calculations I've been doing by hand 
I could do in a fraction of the time with this software? 
That's great!" 

Dow: "It is, Mr. Jones. Just like the Journal, Dow Jones Software 
is a resource you can bank on!"

In identifying potentially profitable investments, two basic types of 
analysis are used: fundamental and technical. Fundamentalists use the fi- 
nancial statements of a corporation, general economic indicators, busi- 
ness conditions, and so on to isolate investments that they feel may be 
profitable. Technicians, or as they are more fondly called on Wall Street, 
elves, study the movements of securities and their relationships to events 
in the world outside. 

Say, for instance, that a certain security has rapidly dropped twelve 
points the last three times the unemployment statistic increased one- 
quarter of a percent or more. Whereas a fundamentalist might see in- 
herent strength within the stock and stay long, a technician might identi- 
fy the relationship between the two events and sell short. Technicians 
look also at a security's present condition and at how that relates to its 
past. Moving averages and oscillators are among the tools used to quan- 
tify these kinds of relationships. 

The More the Harrier. Technical analysis requires the manipulation 
and charting of large amounts of data. It is time consuming and, to be 
effective, must be done frequently. Computerization of the calculations 
and charting required has helped technicians do more in less time, there- 
by increasing their productivity and (one would hope!) the value of their 
portfolios. 

Technical charting ability, together with a portfolio accounting mod- 
ule and a communications module for retrieving news, views, and quotes 
from remote databases, is a good summary of the computer power a tech- 
nician can put to use. This combination is also an accurate description of 
the Market Analyst package. 

Market Analyst, Anidata (613 Jaeger Court, Sicklerville, NJ 08081; 609- 
228-3034). $495. 

Backup policy: Two copies supplied with purchase (both sides of the 
disk); $9.95 for each additional backup; $25 per update. 

System requirements: 16K RAM card (in slot 0); one disk drive. 
Recommended: Graphics-compatible printer (slot 1); Micromodem II or 
Apple Communications Card (slot 2). 

The Market Analyst package was written by Ed Gillott, a gentleman 
and a devout technician. Gillott is always standing by to answer ques- 
tions concerning his package and to talk about the markets, money, or 
whatever. 

Some people may find fault with this program because it requires a 
16K RAM card. The author reasoned that a 16K RAM card is a small- 
er investment than a mandatory second disk drive. This is a good point. 
There aren't many serious Apple-equipped investors who don't have two 
disk drives and a 16K RAM card, but the novice who may just be start- 
ing with an Apple will appreciate being able to run a sophisticated analy- 
sis package with only one disk drive. This arrangement saves an investor 
money— money that might well be put into the market! 

Market Analyst consists of three main programs: the portfolio man- 
agement module, the technical analyst module, and the news, quotes, 
and view module. Let's look first at the technical analyst module. 

Talk of the Technical Town. The technical analyst is the major rea- 
son for purchasing the program. It gives investors the tools required to 
judge an investment based on its technical merits. To use the package ef- 



fectively, you must be a proficient technician. Market Analyst does not 
claim that it will teach you to do technical analysis, and it won't. What it 
will do is help novice or advanced technicians with their investment 
studies. 

The graphic display of the technical analyst splits the Apple's screen 
horizontally into two sections. The upper half displays historical stock 
quotations in standard bar charts. The lower half of the display is re- 
served for the various technical studies built into the package and for 
user-supplied formulas. The results of the calculations are displayed in 
hi-res graphics. 

The technical calculations included in the lower plot analysis are 
moving average, on-baiance-volume (the gospel according to Granville), 
accumulation/distribution, various price and volume formats, positive 
and negative volume indicators, and trend/support/resistance lines. 

It's also possible to input algebraic relationships and have the pro- 
gram chart them. Throughout the documentation, this feature is re- 
ferred to as user-customized studies.

You can also instruct the computer to plot the information on either 
standard or exponential graphs, which are automatically aligned by date 
with the upper price bar chart. 

Multiple charts can be displayed at the same time on the lower plot 
screen. This helps you identify critical points in the study, such as the 
crosspoints of various oscillators, that may indicate a significant price 
movement. 

Within the technical analyst, you can choose interactive analysis or 
auto-analysis; auto-analysis creates complex charts automatically. 

As soon as you've loaded a data file in the interactive mode, the high- 
low-close bar chart for the most recent six months of trading will be dis- 
played on the upper portion of the split screen. Then, from a menu on 
the lower screen, you can mess with the chart. You can compress it, ex- 
pand it, zoom in on it, look at moving averages, get rid of parts you don't 
want, plot trend/support /resistance lines, or display numbers. (See fig- 
ure 1.)

pressing changes the display to a year's worth of data in two-day inter- 
vals. Compressing further can show thirty months' data in weekly 
increments. 

The compress feature even considers the stock historian. If your 
data is stored weekly instead of daily, compressing can display monthly 
information for as much as eleven years; and, if your data is monthly, you 
can look at sixty years' worth at one time. 

The expand feature reverses the process of compressing. It expands 
the chart back to its original scale and range. 

The zoom feature lets you zoom in on part of the chart in enlarged 
form. It doubles the horizontal scale of the right half of the display, eras- 
ing the left half and highlighting the most recent data. 

Moving average calculations are plotted for a time period you select. 
The period must cover at least two chart points but must not exceed the 
time period displayed on the chart. If you are working with a chart that 
you've compressed, the program automatically adjusts for the level of 
compression. 

The erase feature erases the last moving average drawn without dis- 
turbing the balance of the screen. 

In the numbers mode, the bottom sixth of the upper screen becomes a 
numeric chart displaying the volume-high-low-close of your chosen point 
on the chart. 

The Voluminous Plot Thickens. When you're satisfied with the dis- 
play on the upper screen, you're ready to work with the lower screen, 
where a majority of the technical analysis and plotting of the upper 
screen chart takes place. Here you can look at a histogram of volume; at 
center (zero) axis charts of on-balance volume (OBV) and accumula- 
tion/distribution; at normal axis charts of the PVI and NVI (positive vol- 
ume indicator, which highlights price movements on trading days with 
higher trading volume than on the previous day, and at its opposite, the 
negative volume indicator); at a closing price line plot; at a high-low price 
bar chart; and at a moving average plot. (See figure 2.)

Figure 2. 

A moving average of the last plot, calculated and plotted over a user- 
supplied period, can be done. These comparisons require a previous 
study or plot to have been done on the lower half of the screen. Even 
though the previous chart has been erased, the data is stored in memory. 
The memory buffer will always hold the information from the previous 
chart. 

Residential Basics. Market Analyst also has the ability to plot clos- 
ing price data from files other than the basic file. Basic file data is the 
data resident in the upper plot, which was initially loaded into the lower 
plotting area. These plots are useful for making inter-issue comparisons 
or for comparing the investment to industry averages. To prevent misin- 
terpretation of the data, the program only allows files with similar peri- 
odicity (daily, weekly, or whatever) and matching dates to be displayed. 

The user-defined formula option allows you to input your own for- 
mulas to Market Analyst. Three formulas can be stored on disk at one 
time, and you can enter and work with one more formula, but the fourth 
one cannot be saved. Of course, you can edit and replace the stored for- 
mulas too. 

The formula specifications are well defined and explained in the

documentation. Standard operators are used for addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division. The ampersand is used for absolute value 
calculations, and time offset calculations are accomplished using a num- 
ber within brackets, such as < — 1 > for today minus one (yesterday). The 
operands to be used within the user-defined algebraic equations are logi- 
cal, easy to use, and clearly documented. 

The equations, which may not exceed sixty characters, are strictly 
evaluated from left to right. You must use parentheses wherever they're 
called for to ensure proper mathematical evaluation of the expression. 

And here's a rare treat: Should you have trouble figuring out how to 
represent a calculation algebraically, the author of Market Analyst is 
willing to help you figure it out! 

You can toggle the plots between linear and semi-log scales. Log 
functions are undefined for a value of zero. Any plots having a zero point 
in their data set are plotted on a linear scale, even in the log mode. Vol- 
ume charts are the exception to this rule. A special routine is activated for 
plotting volume in log mode. Volume data is plotted on a log chart, even 
though zero data may exist. (See figure 3.)

Assuming you have a printer set up for graphics, you can produce 
hard-copy printouts of the plots currently displayed on the upper and 
lower plot screens at any time. Market Analyst is set up for printers con- 
nected by the Grappler and Microbuffer interfaces and for the Apple 
Silentype printer. 

The auto-analyze feature stores the keystrokes used to create a com- 
plex chart and repeats them as you have directed. 

The two parts of auto-analyze are a program creation mode and a 
chart mode. In the chart part, all quote files on a data disk are charted 
automatically according to the steps you've prescribed in the program 
creation mode. 

In truth, the program does all the programming in the program cre- 
ation mode, so don't be dismayed. You merely choose which key- 
strokes—up to twenty-nine— should be saved in the auto-analyze key- 
stroke file. The keystrokes you choose are the very ones you use in the in- 
teractive mode. The program shows the file-select menu, from which you 
select a file so Market Analyst has sample data to build the auto-analyze 
file on. All of the regular analysis functions are available with the excep- 
tion of trend lines and numbers, which require real-time interaction. 

Once you've chosen all the features to be activated within the auto- 
analyze mode, you must decide such things as what decision criteria 
should be used, when the program should pause, and what conditions 
have to be met before a particular chart can be displayed. During a 
pause, the charting stops, allowing you to interact through any normal 
keyboard function. The system won't begin processing the remaining 
commands in the auto-analyze file until you let it know you're ready to 
go on. 

When the program is in the auto-analyze mode, status indicators 
show what phase you're in. 

The auto-analyze feature is used to identify charts that fit your pre- 
determined decision criteria. An example given in the documentation is: 

Plot the volume and pause for every stock that has appreciated 10 percent

<CTRL — P> for processing if the condition is met. 

Historically Quotable Quotes. To store and manipulate all this data, 
Market Analyst has a quotes-file maintenance function. This module is 
used to create and maintain the historical price /volume data files for use 
by the technical analyst. 

Each disk holds up to sixty-seven individual quote files. Each file may 
have from seven months to five years of daily data, or data for a propor- 
tionately longer time span if the data is weekly or monthly. The maxi- 
mum number of files on the disk is determined by the amount of data 
stored in the individual files; the more information you store per file, the 
fewer files you can have on one disk. 

The most important feature of this module is its ability to retrieve 
stock quote information via a modem from CompuServe or the Warner 
Computer Systems Database. 

To use a modem, you're required to store some information in the 
Market Analyst's configuration file. Market Analyst needs to know what 
modem you're using, your CompuServe user identification and pass- 
word, and, optionally, five telephone numbers you'd like it to remem- 
ber. The CompuServe information service uses page numbers to identify 
its various features. Should these page numbers ever change, you can 
change them also in the Market Analyst's internal fetch routine, prevent- 
ing the routine from becoming outdated. 

Also in this phase, you can choose whether estimated liquidating 
commissions should be deducted from the portfolio profits, whether the 
zoom default setting should be on or off, and what printer specifications 
you want the program to provide for. 

The teleprocessing update section has sophisticated data-checking rou- 
tines. If Market Analyst is receiving bad or garbled data transmissions 
from the remote database, it stops the data transfer automatically. Three 
short beeps sound to alert you, and Market Analyst attempts to restart 
the data transfer from the last good data received. 

During the teleprocessing fetch, you may override the commands be-

ing issued to the remote database simply by pressing the appropriate keys 
on the Apple. The program author warns that you must be quick. There 
is, however, a time-delayed procedure in the program to let you change 
the ending date of the data set being fetched. If changed, the date is used 
for all the data files being updated. 

The teleprocessing module for Warner is similar. Market Analysts 
data-checking feature is also activated. During any data fetch, Market 
Analyst will attempt to correct data transmission errors three times be- 
fore hanging up. 

Through an edit feature, Market Analyst allows you to adjust stock 
prices for splits automatically. This is an important feature. Without a 
subsequent adjustment in the stock's historical prices, a split can severe- 
ly affect the technical interpretation of the data. 

Revealing Secret Identities. Once you've identified securities that 
you wish to buy or sell, you can use the portfolio manager module to 
help with your portfolio. 

The portfolio manager keeps track of open and closed positions. The 
open position file reflects your current holdings; the closed or liquidated 
position file is used for analyzing the tax implications of your current 
year's activity. 

The portfolio information that you enter is stored in memory and on 
the disk in eighty-column format. Since the Apple II displays only forty 
columns at a time, the program allows you to toggle between the left-

Figure 4. 

From the portfolio manager, you can elect to see a detailed display of 
the open positions with totals for profit and loss, liquid value, and port- 
folio yield on the total market value; or an averaged portfolio display, 
similar to the detailed display but with only one line allotted for any 
group of like positions in an issue. The quantity displayed is the total for 
that position, and the price is the weighted average of all prices in that 
group. 

You can also update prices in the portfolio files and close out a posi- 
tion, moving the data to a history file. You can display the securities 
stored in the closed history file, long and short term profits, and total 
profits; delete records in the history file; or delete an entire history file, 
usually done at year-end to initialize the program for the coming year's 
tax records. 

The portfolio manager has its own built-in editing, formatting, re- 
porting, and printing facilities and, like this entire package, is extremely 
friendly and well protected against user errors that might cause loss of 
information. 

The news, views, and quotes module is an easy to use communica- 
tions program that gains access to a remote database and stores up to 
thirty pages of text in a memory buffer. Then you can sign off and re- 
view the transmitted information without incurring the cost of staying 
on-line for the length of time it takes to digest thirty pages. In addition, 
the information can be printed out. 

Three Ways of the Analyst. Market Analyst is an integrated soft- 
ware package. It provides the three essential tools needed for technical 
analysis and investing: analysis and charting, portfolio accounting, and a 
communications capability to retrieve quotes and market news. The pro- 
gram is well written and reflects the effort of the author to produce a high 
quality software package. Ed Gillott has shown the highest commitment 
to his product and a willingness to provide complete, professional sup- 
port. This package is recommended without reservation for considera- 
tion and use by anyone involved with technical analysis.

T a y I o 



An Immediate Apology. If, like a lot of peo- 
ple, you looked at the program listing in this ar- 
ticle before reading the text, you're probably 
wondering, "Where is that hi-res game he 
promised last time? This giant mess can't be it!" 
Right again, buckaroo. The game that was 
promised will be delivered, but next month. A 
bigger issue, related to hi-res games, will be 
covered this month as a precursor (heh, heh) to 
that article. 

To tell the truth, the original plan was to 
create a little shape generator and editor to do 
the graphics animation characters. Well, the 
shape editor grew and grew and threatened to 
overwhelm the entire article. Shortly after 
threatening to do so, it did. Forthwith, this 
month's article presents a hi-res character set 
and a shape and font editor with some really 
nice features. Next month we'll use the editor to 
create creatures to inhabit our game. Also, be- 
cause the program is so large, the usual chatty 
narrative will be somewhat terse. And now, on 
with it! 

An Immediate Digression. Having made all 
those imposing statements about terseness (ters- 
ity?), let's digress for a moment. Several new 
products have been introduced on the Apple III 
that deserve notice. First is a parallel printer in- 
terface from Interactive Structures. What dis- 
tinguishes this card is the software, which is 
really complete. It supports many different 
printers, including Apple's new Dot-Matrix 
Printer, both in emulation mode and with SOS 
drivers. The driver can print with a variety of 
options, and, if your printer has a graphics print 
option, the driver can even use the current 
screen font for printing! In addition, an invok- 
able module is supplied, usable from Basic and 
Pascal, which permits graphics screen dumps 
with lots of options. Altogether, a nice piece 
of work. 

The next two products are floppy disk 
drives for the Apple III. Yes, Virginia, there are 
high-density floppies! Apple introduced their 
new UniFile and DuoFile at Comdex, and they 
should be available soon. They feature 860K 
per disk at a very reasonable price. Also on the 




Exploring Business Basic, Part 17 

market now is the MicroSci A 143, a 560K disk 
that daisy-chains along with the standard 
drives. This disk has less storage, but it also has 
the advantage of not requiring a slot. Since both 
disks come with SOS drivers, they are com- 
pletely compatible with all your other software. 
Go SOS! 

And Now, On with the Show. First, we'll 
look at the general operation of the shape edi- 
tor, using line number ranges to describe large 
operations. Then, some of the routines will be 
examined in detail to clarify points of possible 
confusion and to indicate which routines could 
be adapted for other purposes. 

General Operation. Apple III hi-res shapes 
and characters are drawn on the screen using a 
procedure in the Bgraf invokable module called 
Drawimage. This actually utilizes the Draw- 
block capability of the .Grafix driver. Unfortu- 
nately, knowing all this, and even reading all the 
documentation, doesn't make it completely 
clear. The program that follows should help by 
illustrating lots of useful subroutines that per- 
form these functions. 

The program operates by creating a work 
area on the screen that allows you to look at 
and change data blocks used by Drawimage. 
These data blocks consist of integer arrays that 
Drawblock interprets as bits to be drawn on the 
screen. From now on, the word bit will mean a 
piece of data in an array, and the word pixel will 
mean the representation of that bit as a dot on 
the screen. Obviously, the different graphics 
modes have different looking pixels, although 
the bit in the array is the same. For now, we 
won't worry about color, since that is not a 
function of the bit arrays, but rather of the pen 
color assigned at the time the bits are drawn. 

Another important feature of the editor is 
that it maintains separate windows on the 
screen for each video mode. This allows you to 
see the shape in all the modes at once as it's be- 
ing created. Sometimes a shape that looks good 
in one mode looks terrible in another, because 
of the different proportions. Enough theory, 
let's look at the code! 

Getting a Bit Under Control. After setting 



o h I m a 



up arrays in lines 10 through 15, variable and 
table initialization is done in lines 4000 through 
4500. The program uses several arrays as work 
areas and holding areas for data, and others for 
fast look-up of information for performance. 
Work% is an array that holds the bit patterns 
currently available to be modified. These can 
come from a character set (char%), a shape defi- 
nition (shape%) or an Apple III system font 
(cset%). The most important tables used for 
look-up are shex%, bits%, and flip. 

Shex% is defined in lines 4000 through 4015 
and contains the bit representations of all six- 
teen hex digits in four modes: two high, four 
wide; one high, four wide; one high, two wide; 
and one high, one wide. These modes corre- 
spond to character bit patterns for the work 
area, 140 by 192 mode, 280 by 192 mode, and 
560 by 192 mode respectively. This is necessary 
since we will be using the 560 by 192 screen for 
all editing functions, but we'll want to look at the 
characters and shapes as they would appear in 
the other modes. 

Bits% is a table that has four entries for each 
hex digit (one for each bit) and allows quick de- 
termination if a particular bit is on or off in a 
given hex number. 

Flip contains 256 entries, each one corre- 
sponding to a byte with its bits reversed end for 
end. For example, consider the number 75. In 
hex, it would be $4B; in binary, 01001011. If we 
were to flip the bits exactly, the result would be 
1 1010010, hex $D2, or decimal 210. All this 
would be extremely unimportant if it were not 
for the fact that the character images used by 
the Apple III system fonts and the images used 
by the Bgraf invokable module are exactly re- 
versed. Therefore, to move back and forth be- 
tween the two requires some way of reversing 
the sets. Thus the table flips. By looking up the 
seventy-fifth table entry, the program will find 
the value 210 and make the substitution. Line 
4060 builds this array from a smaller array 
called lookup that consists of flipped hex digits. 

Once initialization is done, lines 30 through 
50 do some further setup, and the program pro- 
ceeds to build the graphics screen for editing. If 



66 



FEBRUARY 1983 



you're wondering whether the whole program is 
worth entering, try typing in lines 5 through 
200, just to get a look at the screen. It'll make a 
lot more sense out of the discussion to follow. 
Notice that line 100 refers to the subroutine at 
line 600, which creates the four windows re- 
ferred to earlier. This routine is also used later 
to clear the windows quickly. 

Once the screen is initialized, lines 210 
through 235 get the command and dispatch to 
the proper routine for processing, Note that the 
actual input is handled in a subroutine at line 
3000. This routine, along with the error routine 
at line 3070 and the message routine at line 
3100, handles character input and output to the 
graphics screen. Remember, the primary action 
is on the graphics screen, so we want to avoid 
flipping back and forth between graphic and 
text screens. You could use this routine in any 
program that wants to accept text input on the 
graphics screen. 

A Routine a Day. Rather than describe the 
various functions one at a time, it's more in- 
structive to look at some in detail and give a 
general overview of the rest. One command that 
shows off most of the features of the program is 
Load, selected as item 2 on the menu. Load is 
handled by the routine at 1400. 

Getting Loaded in Hi-Res. First the rou- 
tine prompts for what kind of file to load. Shape 
and character set files are unique to this pro- 
gram, but the font file must be treated special- 
ly, since Basic cannot directly open a system 
font file. Note the use of the INSTR function at

Apple* is a reg TM of Apple Computer 



line 1410 to determine the value of the variable 
choice. There are two spaces in front of the "Ss" 
and one space between "Ss," "Cc," and Ff." 
When divided by three and truncated (INT), the 
result is 0, 1, 2, or 3. This is a handy technique 
to handle multiple-choice options in either 
upper or lower case. 

The error flag is set in line 1430 to handle 
any errors in dealing with the files, and then, un- 
less it's a font file, the file is opened in line 1435. 
If the choice is a font file, the Getfont invok- 
able procedure is used to load it into memory, 
and the subroutine at line 3950 is called to flip 
the font to the graphics mode. If the choice is a 
shape or character file, then information about 
the data is read in line 1450 from the first rec- 
ord. Filtyp is the type code used to save the file, 
ch is character height, cw is character width, 
and si is the valid length of the shape definition 
in words (0 to 7). Not all these values will have 
meaning, depending on the value of filtyp. If 
everything is okay, then the Filread invokable 
procedure is called (from the Request.Inv mod- 
ule) to read in the array from the file. The ac- 
tual size of the file as read, ret%, is checked 
against the expected size, size%(filtyp); if every- 
thing checks out, then the subroutine at line 
3600 is called to display the results of the load. 

The subroutine at line 3600 does most of the 
work of displaying the bit images on the screen 
as various sized pixels. First, depending on the 
type of image to be displayed (shape, character 
set, or font), it loads a section of the appropri- 
ate array into the work area using the routines 
in lines 3700 through 3940. If the choice is a 
shape, it is directly transferred to the work area, 
since shape definitions are arbitrarily defined to 
be a maximum of 128 pixels wide by 16 pixels 
high. In the case of character set and font defi- 
nitions, the routine at line 3800 prompts for a 
starting character number to display in the 
work area. Normally character definitions are 
each eight pixels wide, and fonts are always 
eight pixels wide. Although it is possible to de- 
fine a larger character cell size, for the purposes 
of this program fonts will be transferred to the 
work area on eight-pixel boundaries and char- 
acter sets will be transferred on even eight-pixel 
boundaries. This simplifies things considerably, 
since the data is stored in integer (sixteen-bit) ar- 
rays. Lines 3815 through 3830 determine the 
starting location in the char% array to begin the 
transfer and calculate si, the shape length, 
which is the number of array elements (maxi- 
mum eight elements or 128 bits) to display in 
the work area. 

As you can see, the storage format of shapes 
and character set definitions is similar. Basical- 
ly, the first index of the array represents the bits 
in a given row, and the second index represents 
the row number. Things are considerably dif- 
ferent in the font definition, however, as shown 
in the routine at line 3900. The Getfont proce- 
dure reads the font definition into a one-di- 
mensional array that is decoded in lines 3915 to 
3935. You can think of the font definition as a 
set of eight bytes for each character, one byte 
for each character row, arranged one after an- 
other. Every eight bytes (four integer elements), 



a new character begins. The requirements of the 
Drawimage procedure are that each row byte be 
in a separate row element, and that each row 
element (an integer) contain the two row bytes 
of two adjacent characters. Whew! No wonder 
a lot of these programs haven't been written! 
Anyway, trust it, it works. 

See It All. After all that messing around, we 
now have the proper information in the work% 
array and can draw the images on the screen 
with the routines at lines 3605 through 3690. Af- 
ter clearing all the windows, and setting up the 
variables (rs — starting row to display, re — end- 
ing row to display, bw — beginning word of col- 
umn, ew — ending word of column), we are 
ready to draw in each window. Line 3610 gives 
the starting position of the window in xdot and 
ydot and then defines where in the shex% array 
the drawing of the pixel definitions will take 
place. Rows zero and one of shex% are pixel 
definitions of hex digits in four wide, two high 
format, the format for the work area display. 
The subroutine at line 3670 then proceeds 
through the work% array, drawing from the 
definitions in shex%. Note that line 3625 per- 
forms the Drawimage procedure directly, since 
the window at 7, 117 is for 560 by 192 mode, 
which is the current screen mode and can thus 
be drawn directly. The drawing proceeds with 
list 3630 through 3635, which sets up the 280 by 
192 mode (two wide, one high), and finally lines 
3640 through 3645, the 140 by 192 mode (four 
wide, one high); the display is now complete. 

Although this information is useful, it is by 
no means complete. A thorough reading of Ap- 
pendix I of the Basic manual on the Bgraf in- 
vokable and the Standard Device Drivers 
Manual section on Grafix is strongly recom- 
mended. 

This program has also been somewhat sim- 
plified by limiting the shape and character size 
definitions in size. In actual practice, Draw- 
image can be used to draw shapes or characters 
actually larger than the entire graphics screen! 
An interesting challenge is to modify this rou- 
tine to handle larger shape and character defi- 
nitions, treating the work area as a window, as 
is done to a limited extent with the character set 
and font definitions. 

Putting the Bits and Bytes to Bed. A quick 
look at the save function is worthwhile, espe- 
cially now that you are familiar with the inter- 
nal format of the information. The save routine 
is found at lines 1 100 through 1 195 and is rela- 
tively straightforward except for lines 1170 
through 1180. In line 1170 a check is made for 
file type 3, the font file. Font files are saved 
without accompanying information, since the 
format is fixed. This also allows you to alter the 
file type on disk to font type and load the font 
into the standard system character set. The Pas- 
cal filer will allow this, and there is a new in- 
vokable from Foxware that makes it easy to do 
from Basic. In addition, the Loadfont proce- 
dure will allow you to use Download. Inv for the 
same purpose. 

Line 1175 then goes to a subroutine, de- 
pending on file type, which loads the work area 
back into the appropriate array for saving. Any 



FEBRUARY 1983 



SOETAI It

modifications, as we will see later, are made 
only in the work area, until saved or another 
work area is chosen. After transferring the work 
area, a check is made to see if the save is being 
attempted in a different format than the origi- 
nal load. For type 1 (shape) the sizes are identi- 
cal to the work area, so nothing has to be done, 
but for character set to font and vice versa, 
some translations must be made. They are han- 
dled by the subroutines beginning at line 2000, 
and then the appropriate array is written to 
disk, safe at last. 

Other Interesting Stuff. The catalog, de- 
lete, and define functions are relatively simple 
and won't be covered here. View uses some of 
the functions we have already discussed in the 
load and save routines. It permits scanning 
around in the character set or font, beginning at 
different places. This routine first must save the 
current work area back to its original array, and 
then load and display the new section, much the 
same as the original load routine did. Obvious- 
ly, for shapes, there is nothing to view beyond 
what is on the screen, so a redisplay is done. 

Okay, it's there; now what? 

Which brings us to the edit, clear, and in- 
vert routines. 

After displaying what you want to edit in 
the work area, selecting option 4 gets you into 
the routine at line 250. An immediate gosub is 
performed to line 450 to determine if the pixel at 
the current grafix cursor location (chorz, evert) 
is on or off. The value of the bit is stored in 
estate. On returning, cflash is set to the oppo- 
site value, and an on kbd loop is entered to flash 
a pixel at that location. Note that the routine in 
line 275 makes a longer wait between flashes if 
estate is 0, allowing you to tell whether the un- 
derlying pixel is on or off. 

When a key is pressed on the keyboard, the 
long routine at lines 280 through 345 is entered 
to process the keystroke and perform the ap- 
propriate action. The request is decoded in line 
295 by scanning the ctrl$ string, previously de- 
fined in line 4085. Then line 300 transfers con- 
trol to the appropriate routine. Lines 315 
through 330 handle simple cursor movements. 
Note that when the open-apple key is held 
down, the value of skp is set to the current char- 
acter width (line 290), useful for moving rapid- 
ly from character to character. 

Line 335 handles toggling a bit and redraw- 
ing of the associated screen pixels. First, the cur- 
rent bit is determined by a gosub 450. Then the 
subroutine at line 470 changes the appropriate 
bit, and, finally, the routine at line 400 is called 
to update the pixels in all the windows. All of 
these routines will come in handy in a minute 
when we discuss the invert and clear routines. 
Finally, the Routine restores the on kbd condi- 
tion and returns to the flashing cursor loop in 
line 270. 

That leaves only invert and clear as major, 
undiscussed functions. These can be called from 
edit mode directly, or in command mode. Let's 
take invert, the more complicated of the two, 
first. Line 1500 prompts for clearing a whole 
row, a whole column, a block (defined as eight 
bits wide, ch high), or the whole work space. 



Rows are handled in lines 1540 through 1565 by 
moving through the row, subtracting 255 from 
each byte, and storing them back. Then lines 
1560 through 1565 set up and call 3610 to re- 
draw the row. Inverting a row is handled by our 
bit-toggle routines, called repeatedly in lines 
1575 through 1^85 as if we were inverting each 
one separately with the space bar. Inverting a 
block and inverting the whole work space are 
handled in 1600 through 1655 as special cases of 
the invert row technique just discussed. 

Once you understand the invert techniques, 
clear becomes simple, since it mostly involves 
zeroing out various locations. Note, however, 
that in clearing a column in lines 1765 through 
1775 the bit toggle and draw (470 and 400) are 
only performed if the bit is on (estate is true). 
Also, when the clear work space command is 
executed, line 600 is called to clear the windows 
fast, instead of drawing the pixels (all zeros) 
in them. 

At Long Last, the Program! Well, there 
you have it, a monument to the Apple III 
graphics capability. Next month we will contin- 
ue on with this topic and use the editor to create 
shapes to populate our games and other graph- 
ic adventures. Until then, happy typing!

LOCK-IT-UP 



DISKETTE COPY-PROTECTION 
AND DUPLICATION SYSTEMS 
FOR THE APPLE COMPUTER 



The Lock-lt-Up systems are sophisticated, menu 
driven copy-protection and duplication utilities for the 
Apple II Computer. They feature several levels of pro- 
tection which make standard diskettes uncopyable by 
even the most sophisticated nibble copy programs 
currently available. 



IS! ' 




• All sectors on the diskette can still be used. 

• Data files can be loaded and/or saved to either the pro- 
tected diskette or an unprotected diskette. 

• Memory will be cleared and the disk will reboot if the reset 
key is pushed. 

• The copying systems support up to 14 disk drives. 

• Complete data-verification is optional during copy. 

• Sequential serial numbers are assigned to each diskette 
produced by the system. 

• Master diskettes created with the system contain an I.D. 
stamp that you select. The I.D. stamp must be correctly 
specified before any diskettes can be duplicated. This pre- 
vents other Lock-lt-Up owners from copying your diskettes. 

• Extensive support is provided should you have any prob- 
lems or special needs. 

• Our system is supported by numerous disk copying services 
should you need a large quantity of diskettes duplicated. 

Either system is available for $225, which includes three diskettes, an 
informative manual, and a non-exclusive license to copy as many 
diskettes as needed. 

ORDER NOW! Call collect for COD, Mastercard or Visa orders. 
DEALER INQUIRIES INVITED 



DOS VERSION: 

• Any standard DOS 3.3 diskette can be protected. 

• DOS command names can be changed and/or deleted. 

• Autorun can be used to prevent the listing of a program or 
the use of any basic commands outside of a program. 

• A faster DOS can be used in order to decrease disk access 
time by up to 50%! 

REQUIRES: 48K Apple II or 11+ with Applesoft in ROM or 
language system and at least two disk drives. 

PASCAL VERSION: 

• Any standard Apple Pascal 1.1 diskette can be protected. 

• Files may be transferred to a standard Pascal diskette, but 
they will not run unless they are on the protected diskette. 

• Easily added to any program by use of a Regular Unit. 

• Compatible with Apple Fortran. 

REQUIRES: Apple Pascal and at least two disk drives.

BV IUDVAHH (URISTENSEN 

"Controlling my house with an Apple has done wonders for my 
social life," Mike Graziano quips facetiously. "In the middle of my enter- 
taining a date, my computer's voice synthesizer blurts out that Ralph's 
using the cat box. It's hard to continue being romantic after that!" 

Such situations are commonplace to Graziano, a technical analyst 
for Hartford Insurance Group in Connecticut, and his unique house- 
keeping system. A bachelor with time on his hands and a lively sense of 
humor, Graziano didn't program a typical housekeeping system; his 
Apple's chief chore as homemaker is keeping tabs on a tabby named 
Ralph. 

Graziano's system starts with the essentials. Every indoor cat needs 
to visit a cat box several times a day, and Ralph's cat box is unlike any 
other on the block. It sports a photoelectric light cell in the doorway to 
notify the Apple each time Ralph slinks in. After waiting a few minutes 
for Ralph to do her thing undisturbed, the computer activates a fan 
above the cat box that scatters the vapors from Ralph's tiny rest room. 

Modesty has not been considered. Ralph's powder room visits are 
noted by the system twice. When Ralph pussyfoots past the light cell, the 
voice synthesizer immediately announces throughout the townhouse, 
"Ralph is in the potty," and it keeps a running total of her visits. Then, 
after Ralph uses her water closet a prescribed number of times, cleaning 
the w.c. is automatically added to Graziano's automated to-do list. 

The biggest benefit of the electronic cat-patrol accrues when Gra- 
ziano is on the road for days at a time. It enables him to check on Ralph. 
He just phones his Apple, which is hooked through an acoustic coupler 
to the phone lines, to learn how often Ralph has been activating the light 
source on her latrine. If Ralph's schedule is not the usual, Graziano calls 
a neighbor to check on her. 

Not one to let his cat become bored, Graziano programmed the com- 
puter to keep Ralph entertained. At random times during every hour, the 




synthesizer says, "Hi, Ralph." Obligingly, the cat curls her long tail in 
reply. 

"I used to have the synthesizer say, "Hi, ugly," but I kept respond- 
ing to it. It was driving me crazy and offending my visitors," adds 
Graziano. 

Cat-sitting is only a part of Graziano's extensive housekeeping sys- 
tem. His home management program is written in Basic with some as- 
sembly language routines. The system includes a 48K Apple II with 
Applesoft card, communications card, Mountain clock, Echo II speech 
synthesizer, SciTronics remote controller, ComData acoustic coupler, 
and an originate/answer modem. 

"With these electronic workhorses, I have the power to be as crea- 
tive as I want." 

In the three years he has had his system, Graziano has been very 
creative. He even planned ahead to let his imagination run wild. While

The Cat 
That's the 



Apple's Meow 





building a condominium last year, he installed a complex system of wires 
to ensure the capacity to connect his system to as many electronic ap- 
pliances as possible. 

Man's Best Friend, Too. A typical weekday for Graziano's Apple 
starts at midnight. That's when it automatically lowers the heat for the 
time Graziano and Ralph are sleeping. At 6:00 a.m., it raises the tem- 
perature ten degrees to tempt man and cat out of bed. At 6:15, the com- 
puter turns on the stove to boil water for morning coffee, while the 
synthesizer drones, "Good morning, Mike," in an unconvincing mono- 
tone. If Graziano doesn't get out of bed, the pleasantry is repeated until 
he turns it off. Then the system politely rewards Mike with a "thank 
you" for getting out of bed. 

When 6:30 rolls around, the system turns off the electric blanket. 
"This makes me want to get up because it's as cold in bed as it is out- 
side," says Graziano. 



A day in the life of a high-tech kitty. Ralph works out, checks on the output of 
her in-house programmer, and tests the photoelectric sensor in her home 
control system. A speech synthesizer, Mountain clock, modem, and acoustic 
coupler all go into making up the recipe for gracious feline living. 



At 7:00, the Apple lowers the temperature until late afternoon, when 
it raises it again in anticipation of Graziano's return. To lower the 
thermostat, the computer activates a heater that generates a small 
amount of hot air next to the thermostat. This stimulates the thermo- 
stat's meter to lower the heat. At 10:30 p.m., the electric blanket turns 
back on to provide another comfortably toasty night for Graziano. 
Ralph does without. 

Weekends vary from this regimen. The heat turns on at 9:00 a.m. 
and the electric blanket shuts off at noon. Unfortunately, even though 
the weekend routines are activated automatically, once in a while the 
human programmer makes an error. 

"More than once I've been awakened at 6: 1 5 a.m. because I forgot to 
notify the computer of a holiday," Graziano admits with a sigh. "On 
those days, I feel like ripping the system out of my house." 

When Graziano has a late night, the computer knows it. If he doesn't 
activate the front door sensor on schedule, the simulator is programmed 
to turn on the lights at random times — as if he were at home. As soon as 
he arrives, the computer continues its daily routine as if he had been 
home all evening. When Graziano travels, he has the computer bypass all 
daily routines and turn on the lights at random times to simulate his 
being home. 

Graziano has missed no convenience programming his system. He 
no longer has to fumble for his door keys. As he nears home, a trans- 
mitter in his car conveniently turns on the porch light, as well as his 
stereo. As he parks, the door automatically unlocks. Yet, even the best- 
laid plans of Mike Graziano are apt to go awry. Once, a friend who'd 
borrowed the place for the day reprogrammed the stereo to blare out

"The Stripper" when Graziano and his date arrived home that night. 
"Boy, was I embarrassed." 

Ralph isn't the Apple's only ward. It also takes care of Graziano. For 
example, he must review his automated tickler file each morning before 
he leaves for work. If he doesn't, the synthesizer reminds him aloud and 
the front door sensor won't let him out. 

No detail of Graziano's or Ralph's lives is overlooked by the to-do 
list. Twice each day, at 6 a.m. and at 6 p.m., the system updates Gra- 
ziano's reminders, first from a permanent list of important dates, such as 
his parents' birthdays, and second from a temporary list of appoint- 
ments to remember and bills to pay. 

These are just a few of Mike Graziano's computer connections. His 
system is capable of hooking up as many as 255 electrical appliances and 
devices — although he uses only twelve so far. In addition, a security sys- 
tem links all the townhouse doors and windows to the computer, and an 
energy management system maintains a temperate environment. When a 
hot day cools off, the outside temperature sensor tells the computer to 
shut off the air conditioning and open an air duct that lets cool air in. 
Graziano reports a 30 percent minimum decrease in his energy bill since 
he installed the system. 

While You Were Out. A gregarious type, Graziano hates to miss a 
friend's call. When you phone his house, his system logs the date and 
time of your call as well as how many times the phone rang. "I count the 
number of rings because I figure that I'd better call people who let the 
phone ring eight or nine times," says Graziano. "They must really want 
to talk." 

Even though he doesn't have the computer programmed to answer 
his phone, it does place calls for him. He has a Motorola Dimension IV 
voice pager that his Apple actually dials. Then, depending on what it is 
responding to, the computer will pick out an appropriate phrase and 
simulate it through the phone lines to Graziano. 

"If my house were robbed, the computer would dial the local police 
department and state six times 'Burglary in progress,' along with my ad- 
dress. Then it would call my pager and tell me, too," says Graziano, 
referring to a few of the twelve hundred statements that his synthesizer is 



programmed to simulate. 

"The police are ready for the day that may happen. They have a card 
on me that says, 'This guy's got a computer that will notify us of bur- 
glaries in a very strange voice.' " 

That's only one of the many ways that Graziano has computerized 
his communications. If he has to leave before he receives an expected 
call, he takes his pager along. When the computer activates his pager, he 
goes to a nearby phone and, by using a remote tone key, listens to any 
messages the computer has received since he left. 

Best of all, Graziano can still use his computer while he's on the road. 
When he calls home and lets the phone ring more than a certain number 
of times, the computer turns on the modem, allowing Mike to talk to it 
through the phone lines. When he gives the Apple his password, he has 
full access to the computer— just as if he were sitting in front of the key- 
board. 

"In the near future, I want to program the system to understand 
more Touch Tone codes. I can already use a Touch Tone phone as a key- 
board to communicate with my Apple. I just type three sixes on my 
phone and, because it was programmed to recognize certain Touch Tone 
frequencies, the system will know to turn on the heat, talk to Ralph, or 
whatever." In order for microprocessor chips to be able to decode high 
and low Touch Tone frequencies, Graziano is currently developing a de- 
coder card that will plug into his Apple. 

Graziano has been interested in electronics since childhood. "When I 
first got the idea for this system, I shopped around and bought an 
Apple II. The Apple is wonderfully engineered. It has an interrupt capa- 
bility that will let me run my daily routines, yet it would suspend any 
program to alert the police if a burglary were taking place." 

As a matter of fact, Graziano's Apple seems to have a mind of its own. 
When he gives a command that it doesn't understand, it responds with 
"Huh?" And when he completes a task that the computer assigned him, 
it even says thank you with a modicum of sincerity. 

Unfortunately, the Apple-based housekeeper doesn't yet apologize 
for accidentally waking Graziano at 6:00 a.m. on holidays or weekends. 
Perhaps that faux pas isn't yet excusable — electronically or not. Hi

FEBRUARY 1983 




This month, let's see if we can cram some more data onto our disks. 
First, let's review DOS 3.3's disk layout: 



-2: 
-16: 



Tracks 0- 
Tracks 3- 
Track 17: 
Tracks 18-34: 
Total: 



48 Sectors 
224 Sectors 

16 Sectors 
272 Sectors 
560 Sectors 



DOS 

Data storage 

Disk directory (catalog) 

More data storage 



Tracks 3—16 and 18—34 are where DOS stores data when you exe- 
cute a save, bsave, or write command. That's a generous 496 (31 times 
16) sectors or 126,976 (496 times 256) bytes of storage before you get a 
"disk full" error message. You can tell how many of those 496 sectors 
you have used by brunning FID (on your System Master disk) or by cata- 
loguing a disk and totaling the sector numbers next to each file name. 
Each sector, by the way, contains 256 bytes of data, so to tell roughly 
how many K (thousand bytes) of memory a program uses, divide the 
number of sectors by four (for example, a (60-sector file occupies 
about 15K). 

Well, even if DOS is generous, let's get greedy and scrounge up some 
more storage space. 

Track 1 7 is pretty milch unavailable, since it's tied up with valuable in- 
formation about a disk^s catalog. Track 17, sector 0, contains the indis- 
pensable Volume Table of Contents (VTOC), the place where DOS 
checks to see which sectors on a disk are free. Track 17, sectors 1—15, 
contain the names and information regarding each of a disk's files. With 
seven file names stored per sector and a usually-too-many one hundred 
five (15 times 7) file names allowed on a disk, we could free up a few sec- 
tors here on track 17, but it would hardly be worth the effort. 

Tracks 0-2, however, are three tracks that are usually wasted on a 
disk. They simply contain DOS, the machine language instructions that 
tell your Apple how to use a disk drive. The thing is, DOS does nothing 
sitting there on your disk; it is only of use when it climbs inside your Ap- 
ple when you boot! And, in case you hadn't noticed, most disks do not 
need to be booted. If you are using only normal DOS, you can boot one 
disk when you get up in the morning and be set until sign-off time. 

So, at the expense of making a disk unbootable, let's let DOS over- 
write itself and free up some valuable sectors. Get out your Sector-Read- 
er program from the October DOStalk (or any disk zap utility).* 

Clear memory by typing: 

FP (return) 

Now ;'«;rialize a new disk, and take a look at hex and/or decimal 
dumps of the VTOC, track 17, sector 0, on that disk. Or take my word 
for it, and read along. The VTOC on a new disk should look something 
like that in figure 1. 

The numbers in the left columns could be different, depending on 

There was a gross error in the October column. In the Sector-Read- 
er program, please change line 250 to read: 

250 IF DSP$="H" THEN A$ = "2710.280F N D823G": 
FOR X = 1 TO LEN(A$) 

If you ran Sector-Reader the way it was printed, you got an incorrect dis- 
play when choosing the hex option. We're sorry for the boo-boo. 



which utility you're using; we've used simple byte numbers for easy ref- 
erence. I added the dotted line after byte 55 ($37); you'll see why later. 

First, let's take a look at each byte in the VTOC. 

Byte 0 is a 4. I have no idea why. 

Byte 1 is a 17 ($1 1). This byte tells DOS the track where the first cata- 
log sector is located. 

Byte 2 is a 15 ($0F), telling DOS which sector of track 17 contains the 
start of the catalog. 

Byte 3 is a 3, meaning this is DOS 3 J. 

Bytes 4 and 5 are unused. 

Byte 6 is a 254 ($FE), the disk's volume number. 

Bytes 7—38 ($26) are usually unused, containing zeros. Use these 
bytes, and other unused VTOC bytes if you want, to store some kind of 
secret info about your disks. 

Byte 39 ($27) contains a 122 ($7A), and the reason why isn't very 
interesting. 

Bytes 40-47 ($2F) are unused. 

Bytes 48-49 ($30-$31 ) tell DOS the last track used for storage and 
the direction of sector allocation. 

Bytes 50-51 ($32-$33) are unused. 

Byte 52 ($34) tells DOS that thirty-five ($23) tracks exist on the disk.

Byte 53 ($35) tells DOS to look for sixteen ($10) sectors per track. 

Bytes 54-55 ($36-37) report the number of bytes per sector (in lo/hi 
hex notation — $0100 or 256 bytes). 

The bytes below the dotted line tell DOS which sectors of which 
track are used and which are free. Each group of four bytes designates 
the free sectors of the next consecutive track in the form of a "bit map": 

Bytes 56-59 ($38-$3B) show free sectors in track 0. 

Bytes 60-63 ($3C-$3F) show free sectors in track 1. 

Bytes 64-67 ($40-$43) show free sectors in track 2. 

Bytes 68-71 ($44 -$47) show free sectors in track 3. 

Bytes 72-75 ($48-$4B) show free sectors in track 4. 

And so on for the whole disk, up to . . . 

Bytes 188-191 ($BC-$BF) show free sectors in track 33 ($21). 

Bytes 192-195 ($C0-$C3) show free sectors in track 34 ($22). 

Bytes 196-255 ($C4-$FF) are unused. 

For an explanation of how to read these free-sector bit maps, see 
page 4-3 of Beneath Apple DOS. For our purposes here, you only need to 
know that: 

255 255 0 0 ($FF $FF $00 $00) means that all sectors on a track are 
free, and . . . 

0 0 0 0 ($00 $00 $00 $00) means that no sectors on a track are free. 

From the example shown above, you can see that tracks 0, 1, and 2, 
represented by all zeros (bytes 56-67), are full. So is track 17, the cata- 
log sector (zeros in bytes 124-127). Track 18 (63 255 0 0 in bytes 
128-131) is partially used by our hello program, written onto the disk 
when we initialized it. 

All we need to do to free up the sectors used by DOS is poke in some 
255s at bytes 56 and 57 (track 0), 60 and 61 (track 1), and 64 and 65 
(track 2). Due, however, to a quirk in the way DOS designates deleted 
files, we are unable to free up track 0, so forget bytes 56 and 57. This 
means we can create 32 more sectors of usable disk space, raising our to- 
tal from 496 to 528 sectors. 

Running the DOS-Killer program below will free tracks 1 and 2 for 
disk storage by reading track 1, sector 0, into memory; poking 255s into 
bytes 60, 61, 64, and 65; and then writing track 1, sector 0, back to the 
disk. Now the DOS in memory will allow programs to be saved or writ- 
ten over the DOS on the disk, making it unbootable. You might notice 
that the disk will boot at first, because nothing has overwritten DOS yet. 
But sooner or later, as you write more files on the disk, forget booting. 

Warning: Back up your disks before subjecting them to this utility. 
You might be glad you did.

IT'S A JUNGLE 
IN THERE. 




There's an untamed jungle inside your Apple II, lurking 
behind the facade of familiar Applesoft Basic. A place 
populated by unfriendly natives like carry flags, binary 
numbers, and indirect addressing modes. Where the 
only laws are the complex and mysterious ways of 
the 6502 microprocessor. 

For years Apple owners trying to learn 6502 machine 
language had a tough time in this jungle, forced to 
hack their way through one slippery new concept after 
another. 

Now there's an easier path through the machine lan- 
guage jungle. A path that anyone comfortable with 
Basic can follow. 

The Visible Computer: 6502 is a unique new program 
that teaches machine language programming. It com- 
bines a hi-res 6502 simulation with an extensive 
user manual/tutorial to provide the easiest way 
yet to come up to speed on machine language. 

The Visible Computer is like a microscope that lets 
you see inside a 6502 as it executes programs. 

You'll watch the registers change as instructions are 
performed. You'll see how instructions are executed - 
not just their results. You control how fast or 
slow TVC runs. And it can't crash, no matter what. 

Once you've earned your stripes as a machine lan- 
guage programmer, you can use TVC as a powerful 
debugging tool, with features veteran programmers 
appreciate, like: On-line 4 function calculator; 
single step and 6502 modes; disassembler; flexi- 
ble register and memory display.

Part 2: Data Handling and System Control 

BV DAVID DIMEE 



Next time you hear, "Easy as Apple pie," think again. Creating real- 
ly delicious Apple pie charts, at least, is less simple than might be ex- 
pected — or, to be more specific, more lengthy. 

Fact is, before we can make an intelligible graph, we have to have in- 
telligible data. So the pie chart program promised for this month won't 
arrive until next month (the easy-as-pie pun moratorium will be similar- 
ly deferred). In the meantime, we'll tackle the preliminary necessity of 
creating a good data editor. You'll be busy typing until then anyway — 
but you'll get a much nicer pie chart, and line and bar charts, in the end. 

The Data Editor allows you to create and edit data on a single text 
screen where you can see it all at one time. This necessitates certain limi- 
tations on the amount of data that can be presented, but the data fields 
are arranged in such a way that the editor won't introduce many limita- 
tions that aren't inherent in the charts themselves. 

For instance, the Data Editor organizes things in five columns of 
eighteen rows. Each column is eight characters wide, so no number 
greater than 99,999,999 (without the commas) is possible. If you want to 
chart trends involving numbers in the billions in one column, it is easy 
enough to label the column "millions" and enter numbers like 1,000 
(meaning one thousand millions, or one billion). You'd still get more 
than 100 million different possible values (including negative numbers 
and nonintegers), more distinction than the Apple can display or the eye 
can comprehend. 

The left-hand column of the Data Editor is called the X field, so 
named for the X axis labels it holds for line and bar charts. The X field 
also holds labels for the slices of pie charts. You can type in the labels for 
pie charts or automatically generate a range of numbers, months, or days 
for bar and line charts. 

The top two rows are for legends. The pie chart generator can graph 
only one column at a time, so the words in the legend box will be printed 
at the top of the chart. Bar and line charts will be able to read and dis- 
play as many as four sets of data at a time, provided they all use the same 
values in the X field. The legend boxes will be treated as labels for each 
line or set of related bars. 

That leaves eighteen rows for data. This was selected as a reasonable 
limit because, given the Apple's resolution, any kind of chart would get 
crowded if more data fields were allowed. In a chart of sales or profits 
over a period of time, you can graph eighteen months. That's a year and 
a half at a glance. 

Enough of whys and wherefores; on to more meaty matters. Here's 
the program, one routine at a time. 

10 DL = 25056:EL = 25856: REM DATA LOCATION

100 GOSUB 2000 




110 
120 



GOSUB 2200 
GOSUB 2500: PRINT W$ 



Lines 10 through 120 are initialization. We'll wait until later to go 
over all the subroutines called. DL and EL hold the addresses in mem- 
ory for the beginning and end of data. DL$, defined in line 70, is a dele- 
tion character that we'll use in several input routines. It is a space fol- 
lowed by a backspace. When printed, DL$ has the effect of erasing the 
character under the cursor without moving the cursor. VF and HF stand 
for vertical field and horizontal field, respectively. They keep track of 
which data field is being edited. 

130 GET A$:A = ASC (A$) 
140 IF A < 32 THEN 200 

150 IF LEN (W$) = 8 THEN PRINT CHR$ (7);: GOTO 130 
160 W$ = W$ + A$: GOSUB 2200: PRINT W$; 
170 GOTO 130 

These lines are the program's main input loop. Instead of using the 
input command, we build a string by getting A$ and adding it to an exist- 
ing W$. W$ will always hold the word (or number) in the data field at lo- 
cation HF,VF. With the get-type input routine, we can limit the number 
of characters in the field (line 150) and keep an eye out for control char- 
acters (line 140), which the program interprets as commands.

IF A > 8 AND A < 14 THEN 1300 

IF A = 4 THEN 1500 

IF A = 1 THEN 1600 

GOTO 130 



If the user enters a control character, the program goes to this rou- 
tine. These are the possible values for A that the program will react to: 

If A is 8 or 21, then an arrow key has been pressed. If it isn't, the 
gosub in line 230 moves the word from temporary storage in W$ to its 
permanent location in memory. 

A 24 means control-X has been pressed and control goes to the X 
field builder routine. A 12 indicates control-L, which calls the legend edi- 
tor. This is the only way to put labels at the tops of the columns, as nor- 
mal cursor movement in the program doesn't go up that far. 

If A is 3, then control-C has been pressed. This indicates to the pro- 
gram that you wish to clear the entire data area to spaces. 

A value of 17 indicates a control-Q. Data Editor understands this to 
mean you want to quit and go to the main menu program. 

Line 280 looks for a range of numbers from 9 to 13. As we've al- 
ready "filtered out" control-Ls in line 250, this accepts the control keys I, 
J, K, or M. These entries allow you to move the cursor about in the vari- 
ous data fields. 

The last two possibilities are control-D and control-A, which stand

for delete and add. These routines allow for deleting or adding an entire 
row of data quickly. The delete routine takes out a row and moves all the 
subsequent rows up to fill the gap. Add does the opposite, inserting a 
blank row and moving all the following rows down one. Any data on the 
bottom row will be lost when you add a row in the middle. 

By the way, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you as to 
what the control commands are, but it won't tell you what they mean. 
Don't be afraid to press one you're not sure of, as the program will al- 
ways ask you to confirm any command that could be destructive.

At the bottom of the screen, the legend editor asks for input. It indi- 
cates the sixteen-character limit (each legend is displayed in two data 
fields) by printing a line of sixteen inverse spaces. This routine is like the 
main input routine except that it stops at sixteen characters instead of 
eight and only reacts to two control characters: backspace to delete is 
handled in line 460 and return, the CHR$ (13), is dealt with in line 470. 

When you hit return, line 520 adds spaces to bring the string up to 
sixteen characters, divides the string in two, and goes to the subroutines 
that poke the values in memory and print the label on the screen. If you 
hit return without typing anything first, the routine skips those steps, 
leaving the previous labels alone. 

Once the routine has cycled through the four legends, it returns you 
to the main input routine, with the cursor wherever it was when control- 
L was pressed.

910 GOSUB 2300 
920 SM = SM + IM 
930 NEXT VF 
940 VF = 1: GOTO 690 

The X field builder saves you some typing if you want the X labels to 
be months, days, or a range of numbers. Lines 610 through 680 handle 
the options menu. Lines 700 and 710 set U$ to the unit you requested (if 
it was months or days) to use in prompting you for more information. 
The lines following ask you how many months or days you want, limit- 
ing you to no more than eighteen and no fewer than two. The routine 
then asks you where you want to start. If your company's fiscal year be- 
gins in July, you would probably enter 7. The loop from 780 to 830 reads 
the values from the predefined array X$(SM) and pokes them into mem- 
ory. There is no need to call the printing routine in this case because the 
whole screen has to be redisplayed. 

The routine for numbers begins at line 840. It is both simpler and 
more flexible than the one for months and days, in that it allows you to 
enter any starting number and any increment. It simply generates the 
numbers numerically and then translates them to strings with STR$ 
(SM) in line 900. If anything comes to more than eight characters, line 
900 truncates it to the legal limit and warns you about it. 

1000 REM EXIT ROUTINE 
1010 NORMAL 

1020 VTAB 24: HTAB 1: PRINT "QUIT TO MENU? ";: GET A$: HTAB

PRINT CHR$ (4);"RUN MENU.D1" 
1040 GOTO 1020 

1050 GOSUB 2200: GOSUB 2500: PRINT W$;: GOTO 130 

The exit routine is pretty straightforward. You might want to re- 
place it with an end statement until you have the whole thing typed in 
and saved to disk. 

1100 REM BACKSPACE 
1110 IF W$ = "" THEN 130 

1120 IF LEN (W$) = 1 THEN W$ = "": GOSUB 2200: PRINT DL$;: 

GOTO 130 
1130 W$ = LEFT$ (W$, LEN (W$) - 1) 
1140 GOSUB 2200: PRINT W$;DL$; 
1150 GOTO 130 

This is the routine that deals with backspaces in the main input loop. 
Lines 1110 and 1120 handle the special cases of W$ being zero or one 
character long. Line 1 130 removes the last character from the string, and 
1 140 prints the string. Note the use of DL$ in line 1140. 

1200 REM FOREARROW 

1210 A$ = CHR$ ( PEEK (DL + 40 * (VF + 1) + 8 * (HF - 1) + LEN 

(W$))) 
1220 GOTO 150 

This routine handles the forward arrow. If you just backspaced over 
something and want it back, it will still be in memory if you haven't 
moved the cursor into another field in the meantime. The lovely equa- 
tion in line 1210 computes the item's location, digs it out, and sends it 
back to the main input routine where it will be reattached to W$.

1330 VF = VF - 1: IF VF = 0 THEN VF = 18 
1340 GOTO 1 10 

1350 HF = HF - 1: IF HF = 0 THEN HF = 5 
1360 GOTO 1 10 

1370 HF = HF + 1: IF HF = 6 THEN HF = 1 
1380 GOTO 1 10 

1390 VF = VF + 1: IF VF = 19 THEN VF = 1 
1400 GOTO 1 10 

This routine handles cursor moves from one field to another. The 
four possibilities are the control letters I, J, K, and M. Line 1310 sorts 
these out and goes to the appropriate line to change the value of HF 
or VF. 

1500 REM DELETE A LINE 
1510 HF = 1: GOSUB 2200 

1520 GOSUB 2500: INVERSE : PRINT W$; SPC( 8 - LEN (W$));: 
NORMAL 

1530 VTAB 24: HTAB 1: PRINT "DELETE THIS LINE? ";: GET A$: 

HTAB 1: CALL -868: IF A$ = "Y" THEN 1550 
1540 GOSUB 2200: PRINT W$; SPC( 8 - LEN (W$));: GOTO 110 
1550 RL = DL + 40 * (VF + 1) 
1560 POKE 236, INT (RL / 256) 
1570 POKE 235.RL - 256 * PEEK (236) 
1580 CALL 25982:V = VF:H = HF 
1590 GOSUB 2100:VF = V:HF = H: GOTO 110 

This is the first of four routines that call machine language routines. 
For that reason it won't work until those routines are in memory. We'll 
cover all the machine language routines later on in this article. 

Lines 1520 and 1530 give you a prompt at the bottom of the screen to 
make sure you want to delete the line indicated. Line 1550 calculates the 
location of the first byte to be deleted, and lines 1560 and 1570 put that 
location in the place in memory where the machine language routine will 



look for it 






1600 


REM ADD A LINE

GOSUB 2500: INVERSE : PRINT W$; SPC( 8 -

1640 


GOSUB 2200: PRINT W$; SPC( 8 - LEN (W$)); 


GOTO 110 


1650 


RL = DL + 40 * (VF + 1) - 1

CALL 26023 




1690 


V = VF:H = HF 




1700 


GOSUB 2100:VF = V:HF = H: GOTO 110 





The add-a-line routine works in pretty much the same way as the de- 
lete-a-line routine. The location of the first byte of memory where the line 
will be added is calculated in 1650 and poked in in 1660 and 1670. 

1800 REM X AXIS OPTIONS INIT 

1810 DIM X$(19) 

1820 FOR X = 1 TO 19: READ X$(X): NEXT X: GOTO 50 

1830 DATA JAN, FEB, MAR,APR,MAY,J UN 

1840 DATA JUL.AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC 

1850 DATA SUN,MON,TUE,WED,THU,FRI,SAT 

Lines 1800 through 1850 set up the X$(19) array that holds the po- 
tential X field labels. With a little modification to this routine and the 
one starting at line 600, you could set the Data Editor up to allow any 
kind of range to be inserted into the X field with control-X. 

2000 REM INITIALIZE DATA 

2010 NORMAL : VTAB 24: HTAB 1: PRINT "CLEAR DATA? ";: GET 

A$: HTAB 1: CALL -868: IF A$ = "Y" THEN 2030 
2020 RETURN 
2030 CALL 25955 
2040 W$ = "LEGENDS:" 
2050 PL = DL - 1: GOSUB 2330 

This routine wipes out any data in memory. Line 2010 is a prompt to 
make sure you really want to do that. The call to 25955 requires no pa- 
rameters to be poked in as it always clears the whole data area. Lines 
2040 and 2050 put the string legends: in the top left corner of the screen 



to remind you that the top two rows are labels and not data. 

2100 REM DISPLAY SCREEN 
2110 CALL 25862 

2120 VTAB 23: HTAB 1: PRINT "COMMANDS: CONTROL-l,J,K,M, 

L,X,Q,D,A,C"; 
2130 VF = 1: RETURN 

This routine displays the screen with a call to 25862. Again, no pa- 
rameters are required. Line 2120 prints the control command prompt at 
the bottom of the screen. 

2200 REM PLACE CURSOR 

2210 VTAB VF + 4: HTAB 8 * (HF - 1) + 1 

2220 NORMAL : IF HF / 2 = INT (HF / 2) THEN INVERSE 

2230 RETURN 

This routine is called frequently throughout the program. It takes the 
values VF and HF and moves the cursor to the proper location. Every 
other column is printed in inverse to keep adjacent fields separate, so if 
HF is an even number (that is, 2 or 4) line 2220 turns on inverse mode. 

2300 REM POKE IN WORD 

2310 PL = DL + 40 * (VF + 1) + 8 * (HF - 1) - 1 

2320 IF W$ = THEN 2370 

2330 FOR LOC = 1 TO LEN (W$) 

2340 POKE PL + LOC, ASC ( MID$ (W$,LOC,1)) 

2350 NEXT LOC 

2360 IF LEN (W$) = 8 THEN 2400 
2370 FOR LOC = LEN (W$) + 1 TO 8 
2380 POKE PL + LOC.32 
2390 NEXT LOC 
2400 RETURN 

Lines 2300 through 2400 poke the word in W$ into memory. The in- 
put routine doesn't constantly update memory. Instead, this routine is in- 
voked whenever a control command is given. Line 2310 determines the 
memory location (again, based on the values of HF and VF) and lines 
2330 through 2350 cycle through the word one character at a time, pok- 
ing the ASCII values into memory. The loop in 2370 to 2390 puts spaces 
in the remaining bytes if the word is shorter than eight characters. 

2500 REM READ WORD 

2510 PL = DL + 40 * (VF + 1) + 8 * (HF - 1) - 1 

2520 WL = 0:W$ = "" 

2530 FOR LOC = 8 TO 1 STEP - 1 

2540 IF PEEK (PL + LOC) > 32 THEN WL = LOGLOC = 1 

2550 NEXT LOC 

2560 IF WL = 0 THEN RETURN 

2570 FOR LOC = 1 TO WL 

2580 W$ = W$ + CHR$ ( PEEK (PL + LOC)) 

2590 NEXT LOC 

2600 RETURN 

The read-word routine does the opposite of the write-word routine. 
When the cursor is moved to a new position, this routine reads the word 
that is in memory there and puts it into W$. Line 2510 finds the correct 
memory location. Lines 2530 to 2550 read backward from the end of the 
field, looking for the last nonspace character. Then lines 2560 through 
2590 read everything up to that character into W$. 

2700 REM INSERT WORD 
2710 GOSUB 2200: PRINT W$; 
2720 IF LEN (W$) = 8 THEN 2740 

2730 PRINT SPC( 8 - LEN (W$));: GOSUB 2200: PRINT W$- 
2740 GOSUB 2300 
2750 RETURN 

Finally, this routine handles the necessary housekeeping when the 
cursor is moved: placing the cursor, printing the word, and poking it in- 
to memory. 

Now let's talk about the machine language routines. The original ver- 
sion of this program had these routines in Basic and they worked but 
they were slow. Rather than compile the whole program, which makes it 
difficult to modify later, it's better to speed up the slow poke routines 
(that's slow-poke routines, not slow poke-routines) by writing them in as- 
sembly language. 

The program pokes data directly into memory instead of using a 
string array so that the data can be easily passed on to other programs or

Did You Hear the One About the 

Computer That Talks? 



It's no joke. 



With the ECHO speech synthesizer from 
Street Electronics whatever you type on the 
keyboard, your computer can say. The ECHO'S 
text-to-speech system gives your computer an 
unlimited vocabulary while using a minimum of 
memory. And now a diskette of fixed, natural 
sounding words is available to enhance the 
ECHO ]['s voice output. 



Nearly 400 language rules are contained in the ECHO s text- 
to-speech algorithm. These rules enable the computer to 
pronounce most correctly spelled words. When in the text-to- 
speech mode the user can select any of 63 different pitch levels, 
and have words spoken either monotonically or with intonation 
by using simple control character sequences. The rate of speech 
can be fast or slow; words can be spoken in their entirety or 
spelled letter by letter. The ECHOs also pronounce punctuation 
and numbers. Words can be encoded using phonemes and 
diphthongs when the text-to-speech or fixed vocabulary is not 
required. 

Applications are unlimited, ranging from phone answering, 
educational and training programs, to games and aiding the sight 
and speech impaired. The ECHO is a complete stand alone unit 
which is compatible with most any computer; it sells for $299.95. 
The ECHO ][, which plugs into the Apple ][, is priced at $149.95.

There are two ways to enter these routines. The first number you see 
in the listing, 1, is an assembler line number. All the numbers in that col- 
umn are line numbers. If you have an assembler, get into its editor and 
enter everything to the right of the line numbers. Most assemblers auto- 
matically number the lines, so you don't have to type the numbers in. 

These routines were written on Merlin by Southwestern Data Sys- 
tems. They should be compatible with most other assemblers. If your as- 
sembler has a limit on label length, you may have to shorten some of the 



labels. Furthermore, some assemblers require that equates to zero page 
locations use a different pseudo op-code than EQU. If that is the case 
with yours, you will have to change lines 10 through 16. 

Now, even if you don't have an assembler, you can still enjoy the 
speed of machine language. Type call —151 to enter the Monitor. You 
will get an asterisk as a prompt. To enter the routine, enter everything in 
the listing that is to the left of the line numbers. The first line, for in- 
stance, is 6506: A9 01 . The first number, 6506, is the address you are en- 
tering the numbers in. Note that all these numbers are in hexadecimal. 
The address will be followed by one to three two-digit hexadecimal num- 
bers — in this case, A9 and 0 1 . Type them in exactly, separated by spaces 
as shown and followed by return. Don't type in the numbers in the line 
number column. 

When you are done typing, check your work by typing 6506L. This 
will list the first set of lines in partially disassembled form. That is, the 
numbers on the left will be the same as they are in the listing here, and 
the assembly language mnemonics (LDA in the first line you typed in) 
will be the same, but the labels will be replaced with the numbers they 
represent. Proofread your work against the left-hand column of num- 
bers only. Type L to list the next section, and so on. 

When you're done, type control-C and return to reenter Basic and 
save the code to disk with the command: 

BSAVE EDITOR.ML,A$6506,L214 

Now you're ready to run the program. When you're satisfied that it 
works, come back and we'll do two more short programs. 

The first program is the Menu, which is used as the crossroads of the 
SoftGraph system. Whenever you quit another program, control goes to 
the Menu, from which you can move to another program. Putting all of 
the disk access into the Menu program avoids redundant load and save 
procedures. Disk access is handled through the disk submenu. 

Here's the program: 

10 DIM F$(20):D$ = CHR$ (4) 
20 ONERR GOTO 50 

30 N = N + 1: READ F$(N):1F N < 20 THEN 30

1000 DATA DATA EDITOR, PIE CHART, BAR/LINE CHART 
1090 DATA DISK MENU, QUIT 

This program's error handling and the flexibility of the main menu 
are worth close examination. Line 20 sets an error flag and the lines that 
follow read data. When an "out of data" error is encountered, the pro- 
gram looks to see how many pieces of data have been read and deter- 
mines that that is the number of items in the menu. This technique makes 



it easy to add new program names as menu items later. Just add the new 
names to the data statements at the end of the program. The only re- 
strictions are that only twenty pieces of data will be read, and the last two 
must be disk menu and quit for those functions to work. 

The program also uses error handling in the disk access sequence. 
First of all, a verify command is used in line 420 to tell whether a file 
name already exists. The program handles this situation differently de- 
pending on whether it is loading or saving. If it is loading a file, it gives an 
error message to the user if the file doesn't exist. If it is saving, it notifies 
the user if the file does exist to avoid overwriting important data. 

The last program this month starts up the system. Type it in and save 
it to a blank disk with the command init hello. Then transfer all your 
other SoftGraph programs to this disk. 

10 TEXT : HOME 

20 PRINT "GRAPHING PROJECT DISK-LOADING SHAPEFILE" 
30 SL = 24576 

40 POKE 233, INT (SL / 256): POKE 232.SL - ( INT (SL / 256) * 256) 
50 PRINT CHR$ (4);"BLOAD SHAPEFILE, A";SL 
60 PRINT CHR$ (4);"BLOAD BLANKDATA" 
70 PRINT CHR$ (4);"BLOAD EDITOR. ML" 
80 PRINT CHR$ (4):"RUN MENU" 

Briefly, Shapefile is the shape table file we created last month. Blank- 
data can be created by running the Data Editor, clearing the data (with 
control-C), going back to the menu (with control-Q), and saving Blank- 
data with the save-a-data-file option. This way, when you start from 
scratch you won't find garbage in the data field, as you did when you 
first ran the editor. 

If you got some strange results from last month's SoftGraph shape 
tables, rest assured. The problem is not in your television set. Change line 
10 in listing 2, Shape Table Test, and listing 4, Hi-Res Writer, to read: 

10 HGR : HCOLOR = 3: SCALE = 1: ROT = 0 
That's about it. Next month: pie charts. Honest.

VisiCalc™ 



pre-boot with 80-Column Display 

Now you can view the VisiCalc electronic worksheet window in 
80 columns. Since the entry line is also 80 columns wide, 
complex formulas can now be seen in their entirety for editing 
ease. An added bonus is the ability to display upper and lower 
case $49.00 

Suggested retail price 

For those who need even more power, a more advanced ver- 
sion combines all the above features with the ability to use 
many of the memory expansion boards currently available. A 
configuration editor allows VisiCalc to use a mixture of dif- 
ferent kinds of memory expansion cards. Just tell it what 
memory cards you have and which slots they are in. For exam- 
ple, you could use more than one language card equivalent. The 
memory cards can be combined 
to give you access up to 
1 76 K of memory!

VENTURES WITH 
VISICALC 

BV JOE SHELTOH 



Ever thought about investing in a company? Or purchasing stock? 
Ever been a manager responsible for the financial health of a company? 
Or known a banker who was looking at the financial records of a com- 
pany? Or a college student who was taking classes in finance and 
accounting? 

What all of these people have in common is a desire to be able to 
determine key indications of a company's financial strength by looking 
at that company's financial records. It shouldn't surprise you that Visi- 
Calc can be the quickest and simplest means of obtaining these indices. 

The first thing you need in order to do this kind of analysis is the fi- 
nancial records of the company that interests you. There are a number of 
ways to find this information. If you want to know more about a pub- 
licly held company, write to the company or see a stockbroker; you 
should be able to get that company's annual reports. In addition, all pub- 
licly held companies are required to file a 10K report with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. This is a yearly summary of a company's 
financial position. You'll find 10K reports in many libraries, especially 
the graduate business school libraries of major colleges. 

If the company you're curious about is privately held, obtaining fi- 
nancial information can be difficult or even impossible. You can try 
going directly to the company, but many private companies won't release 
financial information. Managers and potential investors need to be able 
to secure enough information to do cursory or even complete analysis. 

Financial Ratios. If you've ever taken accounting or finance classes, 
the term financial ratios probably reminds you of frantic efforts to 
memorize masses of formulas. Once you completed your coursework, 
however, you probably rarely, if ever, saw or used any of the formulas 
again. Schools continue to teach financial ratio formulas, though; the 
reason is that a world of information can be gleaned from using them to 
analyze the financial status of a company. But because the process of de- 
termining the ratios is a repetitive and complicated task most people stop 
using these formulas once they finish school. Enter VisiCalc, the perfect 
tool for the job. (You knew that was coming!) 

Before we see how VisiCalc can be used here, a short review of finan- 
cial ratios is probably in order. At the simplest level, financial ratios are 
comparisons of various entries on different financial reports. The most 
commonly used reports are a company's income statement and its 
balance sheet. 

Financial ratios can be classified in a number of ways. We'll separate 
them into four groups — liquidity ratios, activity ratios, leverage/equity 
ratios, and profitability ratios (figure 1). 

Liquidity ratios are an indication of a company's solvency. They 
include net working capital, current ratio, and quick asset ratio. Liquid- 
ity ratios deal primarily with current and quick assets and with how these 
relate to current liabilities. 

Activity ratios are an indication of how sales relate to specific assets. 
As the name implies, activity ratios show how busy (active) a company 
is. Activity ratios include inventory turnover, inventory as a percentage 
of assets, average collection period, fixed asset turnover, and total asset 
turnover. 

Leverage/ equity ratios are the relationships between debt and equity 
as they relate to total assets, total debt, preferred stock, common stock, 



and bonds. Included in this category are total debt to total assets, net 
asset value per bond, net asset value per share of preferred stock, and net 
asset value per share of common stock. 

Profitability ratios are among the ratios used most often in analyzing 
a company's financial well being. They include operating margin of 
profit, operating cost ratio, net profit ratio, price-earnings ratio, return 
on total assets, and return on net worth. 

Various other ratios could be included in these comparisons. Once 
you've completed this month's template, you'll see how easy it is to add 
(or delete) any ratios you want to. In fact, that's one of the real strengths 
of VisiCalc — the ability to change your templates quickly whenever you 
need to. 

Most of the information required to complete these ratios can be 
found in a company's 10K or annual reports. Other information, such as 
stock price and average daily sales, may or may not be readily available. 
You'll have to get that kind of information from the company directly or 
from a stockbroker; in some cases, you may have to draw your own con- 
clusions from related information you've been able to garner from other 
sources. 

If you use VisiCalc often, you can probably see already just how 
simple completing this template will be. Much of the data from the finan- 
cial statements is used in a number of different formulas. For example, 
net profit is used in calculating three ratios. Given that, it makes sense to 
have a data entry section, where the information taken from the reports 



Liquidity Ratios 

Net working capital = current assets - current liabilities 
Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities 
Quick asset ratio = quick assets / current liabilities 

Activity Ratios 

Inventory turnover = sales / inventory 

Inventory as a percent of assets = inventory / total assets 

Average collection period = receivables / sales per day 

Fixed asset turnover = sales / net fixed assets 

Total asset turnover = sales / total assets 

Leverage/ Equity Ratios 

Debt to total assets = total debt / total assets 

Net asset value per bond = total assets - intangible assets - current 
liabilities / bonds out 

Net asset value per share of preferred stock = total tangible assets - 
current liabilities - long term liabilities / shares of preferred stock 
Net asset value per share of common stock = total tangible assets - 
current liabilities - long term liabilities - value preferred stock / shares 
of common stock 

Profitability Ratios 

Operating margin of profit = operating profit / sales 
Operating cost ratio = 1 - operating margin of profit 
Net profit ratio = net profit / sales 
Price/earnings ratio = market price / earnings per share 
Return on total assets = net profit (after tax) / total assets 
Return on net worth = net profit (after tax) / net worth

is entered only once; and a computational section, where the required 
ratios are computed. We'll also have a report section that's dedicated 
solely to the display of the ratios. 

Ratios aren't particularly useful in isolation. They become more use- 
ful when you collect them over a number of years or periods and com- 
pare them. A comparison of one company's information against indus- 
try averages or information about competitors gives added perspective. 
A manager or investor equipped with five years of a company's finan- 
cial ratios and the comparative industry average ratios has a good basic 
financial picture of a company. 

There are a couple of caveats. 

First, financial ratios are only a part of the picture. There are other 
tangible and intangible factors to consider, such as new (announced or 
unannounced) products, changing market demands, interest rates, gen- 
eral economic trends, and so on, that should also be weighed when 
you're trying to get a more complete picture of a company. 

Second, the data presented in financial reports is developed by 
accountants and financial officers of a company. Each company can, to a 
great degree, choose how to define the data presented in its reports. This 
means that reports from different companies probably won't have the 
same format, nor will each entry necessarily represent the same informa- 
tion. You may have to do some editing before you enter information into 
the data entry section of your model. The editing required should be 
minimal, however. 

If you have any questions about the definitions of financial terms, 
you can generally find the answers in a financial textbook. 

The Model. The number of ratios we've discussed tells you that this 
is going to be a large template. For the purposes of this article, we'll do 
only some of the formulas in the template. If you wish, you can complete 
the template by entering the remaining formulas. If you do, you'll have a 
very useful tool. 

The data entry section is the place you'll usually start when using the 
template, so let's begin there. Laying out the template in a logical fash- 
ion will make a difference later on when you begin analyzing reports 
because fewer calculations will be required. If we place the data entry 
section at the top of the template and the calculation section below it, the 
individual formulas will be able to use the information immediately and 
the template probably won't require any further recalculations to be 
accurate. 

For the sake of presentation and printing, we'll place a ratio report 
section directly below the data entry section in our example. Then you'll 
be able to print both sections at once. This means that the model will 
always require one additional calculation to be accurate. 

Before we begin entering random formulas, let's take a minute to 
discuss the internal order of the three sections. The information in the 
data entry section will be the same as it would be in actual financial 
reports. This simplifies entering the data because you can just follow the 
report format. The ratios displayed in the report section will be grouped 
by the type of ratio (for example, liquidity ratios). The computational 
section will group the formulas in the same section order as the financial 
reports do. So ratios that use information from the balance sheet will be 
included in a balance sheet part of the computational section. We'll also 
lay out and label each calculation so that the component parts will be 
apparent. 

Arranging the template in this manner simplifies data entry and 
makes it easier to see where the ratios actually come from. For example, 
if you have a question about how a ratio is computed, you'll be able to 
go to the correct report section of the computational area and see the 
actual calculations. As we'll see later, this permits you to do what-if 
analysis on the ratios. 

Since we're going to do comparisons of different periods, competi- 
tors, and/or industry averages, we'll want to place similar ratios side by 
side. It's up to you whether to design the template to be horizontal or 
vertical. Since most time series are horizontal, we'll do our time refer- 
ences in a horizontal format also. That will give us at least sixty columns 
(three columns will be required for labels) to enter years or different com- 
petitive ratios for equivalent periods. 

Now let's decide what the data entry section should look like. It 
would be nice if all annual reports and 10K reports used the same 



format, but, sadly, they don't. The best method is probably to use the 
most complete balance sheet and income statement you can find as a 
model. You'll also have to have a section for the other data (for example, 
stock prices) that isn't usually included in those reports. For example, 
we'll use a sample of a 10K report that has proved to be complete 
enough for most analysis. 

Figure 2 shows our data entry section. Note in our example that the 
labels in column B are out of proportion to the width of the other 
columns. This is so because this example was done using VisiCalc 
Advanced Version. If you don't have the Advanced Version, you can enter 
the same labels across two or three columns. 

Each of the columns shown that's headed by 19XX can either have 
yearly information from financial reports or competitive data from other 
companies.

Figure 3 shows the financial ratio report section. If you have an 
Apple II with 48K or less of memory, you should monitor the size of the 
model as you build it. This model was developed originally on an Apple 
II with 64K of memory and had memory left over. 

Finally, we should begin the computation section shown in figure 4. 
You'll notice as you enter the labels that the computation for each ratio 
is shown. In the first example, net working capital is defined as current 
assets minus current liabilities. In the second example, current ratio is 
current assets divided by current liabilities. To simplify our example, 
we'll only work through the computations for the first two ratios. 

Calculating the Formulas. Net working capital is our first ratio. In 
CI 1 1, enter the current asset value for column C. The entry is +C18. In 
CI 12, enter current liability (+C29). The net working capital is +C1 11- 
Cl 12. Alternately, you could use the original cell references (that is, 
+C18-C29). To enter net working capital in the report section, enter 
+C113 in cell C75. 

Calculating current ratio is equally simple. In C 1 1 5, enter +C1 8, and, 
in CI 16, enter +C29. The current ratio formula in CI 17 is +C115/C116 
(or C18/C29). To enter the current ratio in the report section, enter 
+C117 in cell C76. 

If you try to complete the template in this manner, you'll find that 
you're jumping all around the worksheet. There is an easier way. Move 
the cursor to the center of your screen and divide the screen with a hori- 
zontal window (/WH). Move the cursor in the lower window to the com- 
putation section and the cursor in the upper window to the data entry 
section. 

Complete the computation section first. As you enter the cell ref- 
erences, it's a simple matter to see the cell reference in the upper win- 
dow. You can enter the cell reference manually or point with the cursor, 
using ";" to jump between windows. 

Once you've completed all the formulas, it's just as simple to relocate 
the upper window to the ratio report section and enter the corre- 
sponding cell references from the computation section for each ratio. Of 
course, you'll occasionally have to reposition the lower window. 

From this point on, completing the template is as simple as following

the instructions presented in the labels in the computational section. If 
you want to, go ahead and complete and save (/SS) the remaining part of 
the template. 

Figure 5 shows an example of completed entries, computations, and 
ratios for net working capital and current ratio. 

You'll notice that we've managed to show four different sections of 
information on the same screen. At times you may want to see different 
parts of a template at the same time. Using a window and setting indi- 
vidual titles in each window is the answer. 

What If? For once, that isn't really the question. Assume we've cal- 
culated the ratios of a business for a number of years. Let's say that we 
can see immediately that some of the ratios aren't even close to the indus- 
try average or competitive ratios. We aren't trying to determine what 
happens (what if?) when a value changes. Instead, we're wondering what 
financial report entries apply and how much we must change them to 



cause the ratios we've calculated to be near the average or competitive 
ratios. 

Let's take a common ratio and see how we can use VisiCalc to learn 
something about the business. 

Inventory turnover is a measure of the value (size) of an inventory 
compared to the dollar amount of sales. Some businesses (grocery stores, 
for example) have very high inventory turnover, while others (such as 
expensive art galleries) have lower turnover. Two factors affect inven- 
tory "turns" — sales and inventory. If we increase sales or decrease inven- 
tory, we get a higher inventory turnover. 

If our business has had an inventory turnover ratio of 12 and the 
average is 14, we have to decide what to change to make the ratios equiv- 
alent. It would be ideal if we could simply increase sales but, unhappily, 
that can often be difficult. Our option is to decrease inventory. What 
does that buy us? One thing we could do is to convert some of that inven- 
tory to cash and use it to pay off a debt. This would save us money by de- 
creasing an expense. On the other hand, maybe we ought to leave our 
inventory ratio alone; maybe we are outselling our competition because 
we have the best selection of anyone in the area. 

Back to our model. If you go to CI 28, you'll be able to enter different 
inventory amounts until the ratio is near the average. The difference be- 
tween the report inventory and our final inventory is the amount of 
excess inventory you might want to convert to another asset. 

It's worthwhile to remember an important caveat about financial 
ratios. Sometimes ratios can be substantially different from industry 
averages and yet not indicate a need for any changes in the operation of a 
business. For example, some companies operate highly leveraged, and 
some like very little debt. Remember, ratios are just another way to 
measure a business. They are not the answer. 

Next Time We Meet. If you read the article in this issue on the 
Connors/Borg Apple Challenge, you saw that VisiCalc was used to 
compute the important match statistics. Next month, we'll look at how 
that was done and at how to create similar templates for analyzing other 
sports. Even if you're not particularly sports-minded, you'll be able to 
learn some interesting things about using VisiCalc. HI

The Schoolhouse Apple 

byJeanWven 




Various people are predicting that educational software will be the 
fastest growing segment of the microcomputer market during the com- 
ing year. The number of new programs released in the last six months 
lends credibility to this assertion. Because of this, software for learning 
takes February's Schoolhouse Apple spotlight. 

Interested parties — educators, parents, software designers, program- 
mers, people with money to invest, and others — seem to be thinking hard 
lately about what elements help make a piece of educational software an 
effective learning tool. A sound theoretical base, logical organization, 
straightforward instructions, and an appreciation of the computer's spe- 
cial capabilities would seem to be among the key ingredients. Feedback 
from intended users (real, live kids) is also an essential element in the 
creation of a good program. 

The programs reviewed in this issue are some of those that are caus- 
ing excitement in kids and in the educational community. 

Gertrude's Secrets and Gertrude's Puzzles. By Teri Perl, Leslie Grimm, 
and Warren Robinett. In these two programs, kids learn by experience to 
analyze situations, think logically, and solve problems. Their guide along 
the way is Gertrude, a goose with secrets to share and challenging puz- 
zles to present. Uncovering her secrets and solving her puzzles isn't 
easy — at first. It requires developing the ability to discover the rules a 
particular puzzle reflects. 

Gertrude's Secrets is designed for kids ages four to nine. Gertrude's 
Puzzles has harder puzzles and gives players no hints about their solu- 
tions; it's intended for players age six and up and picks up on the skills 
the first program addresses. 

Like Moptown, an earlier Learning Company creation, the Gertrude 
programs help kids learn to identify samenesses and differences on sev- 
eral levels. In these new programs, kids develop and expand their knowl- 
edge. Once they see that purple squares differ from green triangles on 
two levels, shape and color, and blue triangles and green ones are the 
same on one level (shape) and different on another (color), they're ready 
to discover the patterns, sets, and subsets that can be created using 
shapes of different colors. 

The player learns two things right off: how to move around and how 
to pick up and drop objects. From the keyboard, the player uses the I-J- 
K-M diamond to move up, left, right, and down. These keys also work 
with control, for slow, small moves, and with repeat, for moving the 
player along briskly. From the keyboard, objects can be picked up or 
dropped by hitting the space bar. In the joystick mode, the player moves 
using the handle and picks up and drops objects by pressing either of the 
joystick buttons. 

The objects to be picked up and set back down include Gertrude and 
various colored shapes. Children can choose between basic geometric 
shapes, which are the default, and sets of animal, flower, monster, and 
other novelty shapes; they can also freely modify any of the shapes using 
a built-in shape editor. The shapes they choose will be used throughout 
the puzzles. 

The colorful manuals that accompany the programs are addressed to 
players rather than to parents. They do a good job of explaining how 
the programs work, although kids don't need to read the manuals to get 
up and running. Each of the manuals contains a map that shows the lay- 
out of Gertrude's secret rooms. Activity cards that enable kids to play 
similar off-computer games are also available to users who send in the 
warranty cards that accompany the programs. A brief supplementary sec- 
tion with information about the concepts being explored would prob- 
ably be welcomed by parents and teachers (and by some kids). So would 



something about the learning theory on which the programs are 
founded. 

Both programs are colorful, logically organized, and easy to use. 
Both are also fun, challenging, and genuinely educational. After all, they 
help kids exercise and develop the ability to think. 
Gertrude's Secrets and Gertrude's Puzzles, by Teri Perl, Leslie Grimm, and War- 
ren Robinett, the Learning Company (4370 Alpine Road, Portola Valley, CA 
94025; 415-851-3160). $75 each. 

Dragon's Keep. By Mike MacChesney, Al Lowe, Rae MacChesney, and 
Margaret Lowe. Dragon's Keep, a delightful adventure game from a new 
California company, was designed with the very young adventurer in 
mind. The vocabulary used in the game is at the second grade reading 
level (except for dragon, a fourth grade word), and instead of typing in 
their responses, players need only press the space bar or the return key to 
indicate the actions they want to take. This means that youngsters who 
can read at the second grade level can play the game all by themselves 
with confidence, and younger children can play if the text on screen is 
read to them by their parents or by an older child. 

The action of Dragon's Keep takes place in and around a many- 
roomed magic house, the dragon's house. The object of the game is to 
find and set free sixteen animals that want to escape the dragon who 
holds them captive. Naturally, the animals are grateful when the adven- 
turer succeeds in rescuing them. And, naturally, the dragon is always 
hanging around, hoping to foil the adventurer's attempts. 

The player can't free an animal or even poke around when the drag- 
on's in a room; after all, it is the dragon's house. So, the adventurer must 
move on and return to that room later. 

This adventure game for young children really works. The level of the 
vocabulary is appropriate and the content is challenging, yet manage- 
able. The graphics, created with Penguin Software's Graphics Magician, 
are colorful and attractive; and children will have no trouble recognizing 
the objects and animals depicted. 

The documentation that accompanies the program is brief, clearly 
written, and certainly adequate. Additional information about the learn- 
ing theory underlying the program would be nice to have, though. An il- 
lustration of the Dragon's Keep world, accompanied by some elemen- 
tary map-making guidelines, would also be welcome. 

Perhaps the most striking aspects of this program are its mood and 
tone. Children are introduced to a magic world in which their efforts at 
exploration are encouraged and their successes are rewarded. They are 
never put down for making moves that don't achieve the results they ex- 
pected. The program's authors promote logical thinking by creating an 
entertaining world in which thinking of this kind is called for. 

Clearly, Sunnyside Soft has succeeded in its effort to create a positive 
learning environment, one that young computer users will flourish in.

Mix and Match. By Children's Television Workshop. Here at last — Ap- 
ple learning games starring the Muppets and based on the games devel- 
oped for Sesame Place educational park in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. 

In a move that comes as something of a surprise, Apple Computer 
has released the first three Discovery Games disks — Ernie's Quiz, In- 
stant Zoo, and Spotlight — in Integer Basic rather than in Applesoft. If 
you own an Apple II, this is good news; if you've got a II Plus, you'll 
need an Integer card or RAM card in order to run these programs. The 
fourth program, Mix and Match, is written in Applesoft and will run on 
any 48K Apple II Plus (and on 48K Apple lis outfitted with an Apple- 



ANNOUNCING 
AN INNOVATION 
IN TYPING INSTRUCTION. 




Improve your keyboard skills 

with MasterType. 

A typing program for the Apple II that 
dares to be fun. But it's not just child's play. 
No matter who you are, your computer will 
become a more efficient tool, as you become 
a more proficient typist. And MasterType 
can help. Dramatically. 

But don't just take our word for it. 

Infoworld magazine had this to say 
about Lightning Software's Hi-Res MasterType: 
"MasterType is an excellent instructional 
typing game. We had fun reviewing it, and 
we highly recommend it to those who 
want to learn typing in an unconventional 
but motivating way." 

Infoworld also went on to rate Master- 
Type as Excellent in all categories. 

Bring your Apple hours of fun. 

Learning to type has never been so 
enjoyable. And since MasterType has 18 
different learning levels, you can play for 
hours while your typing gets increasingly 
better. And all for only $39.95.

soft card or language card). 

Apple Computer describes Mix and Match as its family package. 
Each of the games it contains — Mix and Match, Animal, Layer Cake, 
and Raise the Flags — can be enjoyed by learners of various ages. 

In Mix and Match, players construct new Muppets out of the top, 
middle, and bottom sections of six familiar ones. The presence of Big 
Bird, Ernie, Cookie Monster, and the rest gives this familiar game that 
extra something. 

Animal is a neat version of the program on the system master disk. It 
puts the player in the role of teacher and the computer in the role of 
eager student. Because the computer only recognizes a few animals at 
first, it's the player's job to teach it new ones — to identify what makes 
various animals different from one another so the computer can recog- 
nize all of them later on. Teaching becomes a great way of learning. 

In Layer Cake, a logic game reminiscent of Tower of Hanoi, the play- 
er is faced with three layers of a cake on one of three plates. The task is to 
transfer the layers of the cake to one of the other plates in the fewest pos- 
sible moves and without crushing any of the smaller layers under the 
larger ones. The "fewest moves" for a three-layer cake is seven, but suc- 
cess on any level is rewarded. The number of layers can be varied, and, 
over time, players will begin to discern the logic pattern involved. 

Raise the Flags is an appealing version of Hangman. Two lists of 
words are provided, and by means of a fifth program, Word Editor, play- 
ers or parents of players can create their own word lists. The words to be 
identified can contain three to six letters, and a player is entitled to guess 
seven incorrect letters before the computer will reveal the answer. Word 
lists can contain up to forty-five words. 

The Mix and Match programs are easy to use, reinforcing, unclut- 
tered, and virtually crash-proof. And it's evident that the people who 
created them honestly believe that learning is fun. 

The manual is a genuine resource. It provides information and in- 
structions that inexperienced computer users will find helpful, and it sug- 
gests noncomputer games that children and parents can make them- 
selves. Emphasizing the same concepts and skills as their computer coun- 
terparts do, these homemade games encourage creativity and provide for 
hours of rainy day fun in the bargain. 

Mix and Match, by Children's Television Workshop for Apple Computer (20525 
Mariani Avenue, Cupertino, CA 95014; 408-996-1010). $50. 

Ernie's Quiz. By Children's Television Workshop. In typical CTW style, 
Ernie's Quiz refers not just to one game but to a collection of four, each 
of which covers a different subject. 

Guess Who helps kids with image recognition. One at a time the Ses- 
ame Street Muppets take shape, appearing one (lo-res) dot at a time. The 
object of the game is to guess, before the entire picture appears, which of 
the Muppets it is. A color television set or monitor is recommended for 
all the games, especially this one. Since the Muppets are made up of dif- 
ferent basic colors, color recognition helps the child identify which Mup- 
pet is being displayed. 

Jelly Beans is a simple counting skills exercise. A random number of 
jelly beans appear in the bean jar and the child is asked to count how 
many. The use of different colored jelly beans helps prevent confusion 
over which ones have been counted and which have not. 

Using the game paddles, it's possible to create numerous faces in 
Face-It. The player gets to choose among various head shapes, hair de- 
signs, eyes, noses, and so on and then selects what colors different body 
parts will be. 

The fourth game, Ernie's Quiz, is a multiple-choice quiz on how well 
the child knows the Sesame Street Muppets. Three clues are given, one at 
a time, and the child guesses which of three Muppets is being described 
in the clues. If the guess is incorrect, the display lets the child know that it 
isn't that one, thus eliminating one possibility. 

One of the strongest points of the package is its stress on the posi- 
tive. Instead of, "No, that's wrong. Try again," the child is given encour- 
agement. The child is never told that the response typed is wrong, only 
that the computer's answer isn't the same. 

For example, in Guess Who, if the child guesses "Grover" incorrect- 
ly, the program responds with, "It doesn't look like Grover to me." Or if 
a guess is made that is not even one of the Muppets, the program fills in 
that name in its reply.

WU 111 V

Likewise, in Jelly Beans, an incorrect guess is greeted with, "That's 
not how many I counted," rather than with, "No, it's not eight. Count 
again." 

When the child guesses correctly, the Muppets respond with con- 
gratulatory messages. In Guess Who, messages reflect the personality 
(muppetality?) of each Muppet. ("Yep, me Cookie Monster!" or "Okay, 
so you guessed it was me, Oscar. What's it to you?") If the child never 
guesses the Muppet, the image eventually appears with a message telling 
who it is. 

Three out of four of the Ernie's Quiz games have definitive endings to 
them and never leave the child hanging, unsure of what the answers were. 
In Jelly Beans, however, it's possible to get hung up. If the correct num- 
ber of jelly beans is never entered, the game will go on until the reset key 
is pressed or the computer is switched off. 

Ernie's Quiz can be played by kids of ages four to seven without the 
aid of an adult. Instructions for each game appear on the screen and in 
the manual. The directions in the manual are accompanied by life-size il- 
lustrations of which key(s) to press and screen samples from the games. 

Each game on the disk is supplemented by descriptions of two or 
three games that don't require a computer. Ernie's Quiz is meant to in- 
troduce basic concepts and the games described in the manual will help 
children expand their understanding of those concepts.

Bop-A-Bet. By Mike MacChesney, Al Lowe, Rae MacChesney, and 
Margaret Lowe. Here's another group of educators who recognize the 
futility of educational software running in the textbook emulation mode. 
Instead of another curriculum-based package that merely turns the Ap- 
ple screen into the electronic equivalent of a textbook page, Bop-A-Bet is 
a learning game based on maze-chase game techniques. 

What does learning have to do with Pac-Maril Lots in this context. 
The learner here is the tyke trying to master the alphabet. The lesson is 
letter recognition and alphabetic order. Run the cursor over the letters of 
the alphabet in order and, in the process, bop 'em a good 'un. It's a lot 
better than staring at a string of characters on a page, and, in the elec- 
tronic age, it's probably more effective than the books with one letter and 
one picture on a page. Remember the "C" and "C is for cat" books? 

One of the things youngsters do best is emulate their elders. So at this 
stage in society, Pac-Man style learning is probably more appropriate 
than McGuffey's readers in most households, even if the learning is then 
more subliminal and less conscious. 

The authors of Bop-A-Bet clearly have the right idea. To use the mi- 
crocomputer as a learning tool, one should use all the capacities of the 
machine — color, animation, and good graphics. The only quarrel from a 
technical standpoint with the execution of this game is that the cursor 
could be more responsive to the keyboard instructions. 

Sunnyside Soft doesn't have the bucks to promote their software in 
the same fashion as Children's Television Workshop, Spinnaker, the 
Learning Company, Control Data, SRA, and Xerox. But those other 
guys might do well to pay heed. If Sunnyside can maintain good, fresh 
ideas and spruce up the efficiency of their code, they could well be a pace- 
setter in the area that looks to be the fastest growing segment of micro- 
computerdom in 1983.

Micro Mother Goose. By Classic Family Software. Old King Cole, Lit- 
tle Miss Muffet, and the Three Blind Mice on the computer? Yup — for 
the three-year-old contingent (and up). Software Productions^ first 
product, Micro Mother Goose, is intended to open up the world of mi- 
crocomputers to very young children. 

Micro Mother Goose consists of nine Mother Goose rhymes and 
three simple games loosely tied to nursery rhyme themes. Each rhyme 
appears line by line on the screen in upper and lower case letters and is il- 
lustrated with an appropriate hi-res picture. A slowed down musical ren- 
dering follows immediately after the text of the rhyme. The rhymes are 
easy to read, the illustrations are effective and fun, and the music is about 
what you can expect from the a capella Apple speaker — fine but 
not great. 



ross Clues: 
The unique word 
challenge game. 

It offers intellectual stimulation arcade games can't 
match . . . with all the excitement. 

Fast-action fun isn't just for mystery or arcade games any 
more. Cross Clues is a word game that tests more than 
mere reflexes. It's the mind-challenging evolution of the 
crossword puzzle, with beat-the-clock excitement. The 
playing tempo is lively, but you decide how fast you want 
to go. The computer "umpires" while you compete with 
another player lor hidden words, coaxing clues from the 
computer. Since a clue helps your opponent too, suspense 
builds till the end. when the best combination of skill, 
intellect, timing and luck wins. 

If you're ready for an even greater challenge, try 
Concentration Crosswords™ a game that offers 3 levels 
of difficulty and 3 ways to plav — for even the most 
demanding word whiz. Again, you compete against the 
clock to uncover hidden words. But once discovered, they 
disappear, to test your memory. Here, a combination of 
word skills, intellect, memory and luck determine the 
winner. 

Both games offer 50 mind-boggling puzzles that appeal 
to young teens through adults. Try them both! You mav 
find you've matched wits with monsters and space critters 
long enough.

This program practically runs itself. And because visual cues (such as 
color coded menus and a pointing finger next to the current rhyme 
choice) are given, children don't have to be able to read in order to get 
the program to do what they want it to. 

The games are played using paddles or joystick. There's Lamb 
Scramb, in which Mary's little lambs need protection from the wolf and 
help getting through the hedge; Splat, which features one hundred fall- 
ing eggs (Humpty Dumptys, all of them); and London Bridge Out, a Lit- 
tle Brick-Out variation. All of the games start out very easy and grow 
more challenging as children show that they are ready to move to the 
next level of difficulty. 

The manual, designed for parents, is excellent. It is attractive, well 
written, and thorough, and it does a good job of explaining both the how 
and the why of the program. It also includes useful information about 
how to set up the computer and how to ensure that your own kids and 
those in the neighborhood know how to treat the computer. 

The program is not copy protected. Users are encouraged to make 
their own "working copy" immediately and are even supplied with an ex- 
tra program label to affix to it. The package also includes a computer dos 
and don'ts poster and Mother Goose stickers. 

It's obvious that care and thought went into the creation of this pack- 
age. Two things would have added to the program's flexibility — a pause 
between the end of the rhyme text and the start of the music and a sound- 
off option for times when the kids want to play but parents don't want to 
listen. 

Micro Mother Goose, by Classic Family Software, Software Productions (2357 
Southway Drive, Box 21341, Columbus, OH 43221; 614-486-3563). $39.95. 

Rocky's Boots. By Warren Robinett and Leslie Grimm. Remember 
when it was fashionable to say that the main purpose of school was to 
teach kids how to think? This was generally said to justify the teaching of 
facts and processes that were boring to kids who didn't see why they'd 
ever need to know them. The principle should be true, of course, even if 
it isn't always practiced, but the justification doesn't work. Learning that 
the capital of Malaysia is Kuala Lumpur may be romantic, but it won't 
be a burning issue in most kids' adult lives — or, if it becomes one, they'll 
learn it then without effort because it is. Learning it at age ten won't 
teach someone to think — only to memorize. 

The Learning Company believes in the principle without justifica- 
tion. In Moptown, in the Gertrude series, and now in Rocky's Boots, the 
programs home in on the thinking processes directly, and they make them 
fun. Kids learning with Gertrude and Rocky learn the tremendous de- 
light of having their own minds function well — of tackling difficult prob- 
lems, working them through, and solving them. 

Presenting difficult problems that require logical thinking isn't so dif- 
ficult to do. The hard part, which the Learning Company solves, is mak- 
ing hard problems not loom hard — even seem appealing — without taking 
away the sense of accomplishment that solving hard problems can bring. 

The concepts of logic, with all the details of logic gates — and, or, 
not, electric surges and glitches, and flip-flops — are introduced so 
simply and naturally in Rocky's Boots that the child just can't feel the ter- 
ror and frustration many adults have felt when introduced to these 
concepts. 

By the end of Rocky's Boots, the child is attempting and solving com- 
plex plottings of logical gates to achieve configurations that accept or 
eliminate different colors and shapes. In the child's eyes, of course, she's 
building a hi-res machine to accept all yellow Pac-Men and blue ghosts, 
to kick out all ghosts of other colors, and to ring a bell and kick out any 
other-color Pac-Men; or perhaps some even more complex arrangement. 

If you think this too much for a seven-year-old to handle (the Learn- 
ing Company lists Rocky's Boots as being suitable for kids age seven and 
up), just try it with one. If he's mastered Gertrude's Secrets or Puzzles 
first, he's apt to leave you eating his dust. 

The Learning Company asks a high stipend for its programs; but a 
good mind that knows how to delight in its own effort is worth much, 
much more. 

Rocky's Boots, by Warren Robinett and Leslie Grimm, the Learning Company 
( 4370 Alpine Road , Portola Valley, CA 94025; 415-851-3160). $75.

Free Enterprise 

A business management game 

You run your own company making decisions based 
on economic factors and the actions of competitors. 

It's your opportunity to sit on top and run a corporation. 
Free Enterprise, based on an IBM-developed simulation 
for training top-level managers, is as surprising and 
demanding as the real world. 

It lets you face the same on-your-toes challenges you 
would in running a real business: pricing products, 
determining budgets for advertising, production, plant 
improvement, and R&D. Even securing bank loans and 
deciding on stockholder dividends. You use computer 
generated reports to make decisions. But if you're wrong 
you could go bankrupt. Only the shrewd survive! 

Free Enterprise can be played at three competency levels 
so novices can compete with the more experienced, and 
from one to six can play. It's the perfect chance to learn 
about the free enterprise system — to practice business 
strategies — and to enjoy it — with no risks. 

Simulation components: disk, user's manual, pad of 50 
record sheets, and pad of 50 decision sheets. 

To obtain Free Enterprise, see your local dealer or 
send in the order form below. 

Operates on Apple II Plus® with 48k RAM and disk 
drive (DOS 3.3): A printer is strongly recommended.

A Schoolhouse Apple 
Tu t o r i a I 

LOGO 

JIM MULLER 

How can several hundred children, each with different talents, inter- 
ests, and motivation, find the opportunities to discover their potentials 
when the school they attend has but a handful of computers? Will only 
those students who attend schools with very low computer-to-student 
ratios enjoy the learning potential the computer offers? 

A related problem occurs when children's levels of interest at the 
computer are markedly different. Some kids take to computers like 
ducks take to water. Others need considerable guidance and structure if 
they are to make the most of the learning experience. Translating the ab- 
stractions of the cybernetic world to the real world — and vice versa — is a 
bit much for some children. 

These problems have much in common with those of a teacher who's 
faced with twenty youngsters, a forty-five minute class period, and one 
computer. Unstructured self-exploration is totally impractical in such a 
real-world situation. But that doesn't mean that Logo and one comput- 
er can't be used effectively. 

Logo Activities off the Computer. In the November issue, we pub- 
lished a variation of the instant single-keystroke procedure that's being 
used by developmentally disabled youngsters. This procedure is also very 
useful in helping preschool and kindergarten students to discover the 
world of the cybernetic turtle. 

For some children, however, moving from the doodling world of the 
single-keystroke procedures to Logo programming is a bit too abstract.

EZ-LEDGER is the ideal record keeping system for somebody running 
a small business out of their home or the self-employed professional. 
EZ-LEDGER uses the simpleist form of bookkeeping possible. Single 
entry bookkeeping requires only posting transactions either under 
INCOME or EXPENSE. 

EZ-LEDGER will keep track of expense items under any one of 99 user 
selected tax codes plus keeping all year-to-date and monthly running 
totals for each of the selected items. Expense items may be entered 
under DEDUCTIBLE or NON-DEDUCTIBLE type codes. 

EZ-LEDGER is a strictly cash system, i.e. if you pay out monies 
(check, cash, credit cards etc.) then the transaction is posted under 
EXPENSE and if you receive monies then record them under INCOME. 

EZ-LEDGER will produce INVOICES with an automatically increment- 
ed invoice number and then automatically post the data to an 
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 'holding' file or directly to INCOME and 
update all totals. 

EZ-LEDGER will support 80 or 132 column printers and one or two disk 
drives. The printer is needed for producing invoices, but optional on all 
other reports. 

EZ-LEDGER requires 48K ram, APPLESOFT rom and DOS 3.3. 
EZ-LEDGER ON DISK $60.00 

EZ-INVOICE is a simple, easy to use invoice generating program 
which will store the invoice on disk for later recall and allow you to 
reprint or edit the invoice at any time. 

EZ-INVOICE includes a versatile key-board macro capability which 
allows you to define client names or key items once and then insert 
them into the invoice by entering only a 3 digit user defined code, thus 
saving hours of retyping. 

EZ-LEDGER & EZ-INVOICE ON DISK $89.95

One tool that has proven to be quite valuable is Big Trak, the pro- 
grammable truck from Milton Bradley. 

Big Trak is about thirteen inches long. It can be programmed to 
move forward, back, and right, much the way you can program the tur- 
tle on the screen with the FORWARD, BACK, and RIGHT com- 
mands. Programming the truck to avoid tables and chairs provides a 
very real, concrete experience for young children. Then, if you want to 
work on building the concepts of shapes, put masking tape on the floor 
to provide a track for the truck to follow. 

Another idea that works is to visit a newspaper printer and pick up 
roll-ends of paper. Then tape a marker to the back of the Big Trak so it 
can be programmed to draw as it moves over the paper. If you use the 
Big Trak Transport, a trailer accessory, you can add PENUP and PEN- 
DOWN commands to Big Trak with only minor modifications. 

Another way to make turtle shapes come alive for kids is to create 
them first on the screen. Print them out, and then have the youngsters cut 
them out and trace them onto colored construction paper. Ask the chil- 
dren to trace the shapes without lifting their pencils from the paper. In 
doing so, children will move their pencils through the same path as 
the turtle. 

Once you have a variety of basic shapes — squares, rectangles, tri- 
angles, and circles — ask the children to assemble them into pictures. 
Show them how complex structures can be assembled from simple 
shapes. Soon you will see rocket ships, houses, cars, and other objects ap- 
pear. After they have had the chance to build complex shapes, take a trip 
through the neighborhood to discover these basic shapes in nature. 
Trees, shops, windows, roads, leaves, flowers, and airplanes can all be as- 
sembled from basic geometric shapes. 

The mathematical concepts of how one, two, and three dimensional 
objects can move through space can be very difficult for young people to 
understand. A loop of rope and the computer can help make these ideas 
come alive more easily. 

Draw a clock on the floor that's large enough to allow a child to 
stand at any hour with another in the middle representing the turtle. 
Place a child at 12:00 with the turtle in the middle and stretch the rope 
between them. The rope can then be measured in one dimension — 
length. Place another child at 3:00 and stretch the rope among the three 
of them. What would be the resulting shape? 

Add a fourth child outside the circle a step or two back from 1:30. 
Then what shape do you have? 

The next step is to have the turtle remain still while each of the other 
three advances one hour. Rather than standing at 12:00, 3:00, and out- 
side 1:30, the children are now at 1:00, 4:00, and outside 2:30. What has 
happened to the square? 

Next, have another child use turtle graphics to duplicate the clock 
and square on the computer screen. Show how the children moved 
through one-twelfth of the clock, or one-twelfth of a circle. How many 
degrees is that? Now have the turtle turn RIGHT 30 and draw a square. 
What happens? Have the children on the computer and those on the 
clock continue to rotate through each of the twelve hours. Don't erase 
any of the squares from the computer screen. What does the picture on 
the screen look like? 

If drawing a clock on the floor isn't convenient, cut a piece of pine 
shelving into a square and draw a clock on the board. Hammer nails in- 
to the hour positions and the center. Put a loop into one end of a string 
and loop this over the center nail. The string is now ready to take a tur- 
tle-walk around the clock, creating all sorts of repetitive shapes. 

These exercises should give you some ideas about how to make 
mathematics come alive for young people so they will come to know 
math as a universal language for solving problems and developing ana- 
lytical skills. The computer and Logo are fascinating, imaginative tools 
that help this learning process along. But they are only tools, tools that 
need to be used productively and efficiently within a structured learning 
experience. 

Illustrations and sample procedures have been deliberately omitted 
from this article. The descriptions are also purposefully brief. We hope 
you will explore these ideas and modify them to your own purpose. 

Good Grief. Last month's Logo installment was written by Donna 
Bearden, not Jim Muller. 3U

YOUR WORKING CONDITIONS 
WE'LL GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY BACK. 



It's almost three in the morning. 
You knew just one more line of code flf 
and your program would be finished. ' 
That was seven hours ago. It's hard 
work developing good software. Writing 
it on the Apple II is no exception. 
Although we can't promise to get you 
to bed by eleven o'clock, we can make 
your job a lot easier. 

When we developed MetaCard, a 
co-processor system for the Apple II, we 
designed in 128K bytes of on-board 
memory with parity. Enough memory to 
run the most powerful development tools 
available. We included memory expansion 
capabilities beyond 128K. 

And we made sure it could run all three 
operating systems for the IBM PC. MetaCard 
does more than make your job easier, it opens 
up new development areas. If you want to create 
or run more powerful applications software for 
the Apple, or for the IBM PC or other 
8086/88-based systems, you should have a 
MetaCard in your Apple. MetaCard supports the 
most popular development languages available 
for MS-DOS, CP/M-86 and UCSD p-System 
Version IV. Languages like Pascal, C, COBOL, 




FORTRAN, BASIC and almost all others operate 
at peak performance. MetaCard enables you to 
continue to use most of the popular peripherals 
for your Apple II, plus all of your existing 
software. And with many best selling 
applications for the IBM PC available soon, you 
can use your Apple in new and developing areas. 

MetaCard uses the Intel 8088 processor and 
operates at a full 5 Mhz. And MetaCard's 
real-time clock, external power supply, parity 
checking RAM, and power-up ROM diagnostics 
give you the features and reliability you demand. 



Satisfaction Guaranteed 

We know you'll still work through the night. 
But if MetaCard doesn't improve your 
working conditions, return it within 
30 days, and we'll send your money 
back. No questions asked. 
MetaCard, complete with 
documentation, MS-DOS and UCSD 
p-System (CP/M-86 optional) and power 
supply, is available in both 64 and 128K 
I configurations, priced at $980 and $1,150 
respectively. The MetaCard System Operating 
Manual is available for only $25.

CONTEST 



from page 6 

Sandwich Generator was smiling on Heimo- 
witz that fateful day when all the correct entries 
were examined. Besides, Heimowitz's turkey 
sandwiches tasted the best, according to the 
contest staff. For his adroitness with the turkey 
net, Heimowitz will receive Jigsaw and Micro- 
barmate from his local Computerland. 

The contest staff appreciates all the letters 
everyone sent in with their entries. Believe it or 
not, we do look at each entry. But you have to 
remember that when you send us an out-of-the- 
ordinary entry, if you're not saluted for out- 
standing performance, then you run the risk of 
being embarrassed in front of fellow readers. 

Softalk Salutes. Throwing herself on the 
mercy of the contest staff was Susan Jordan 
(Fort Valley, GA), who pleaded, "I have 
served turkey sandwiches three times a day to 
get in the mood for the contest. I have gained 
forty-seven pounds from eating all those sand- 
wiches. My husband developed an allergy to 
turkey and had to move. My daughter asked to 
be placed up for adoption, preferably in a coun- 
try where turkeys are considered sacred and 
may not be killed or even counted." 

Boy, if there's one thing we can't stand, it's a 
whiner. But Jordan did not stop there. 

"If I win, I want everything, including soft- 
ware, hardware, peripherals, a color monitor, 
modem, books, magazines, flowchart tem- 
plates, and a job in the computer field." 

Jennifer Myers (New York, NY) and Mi- 
chael Friedlander (Los Angeles, CA) aren't too 
good at turkey hunting, but they sure are good 
with the scissors. Though they missed catching 
all the birds, both Myers and Friedlander sent 
in their entries accompanied by all the turkeys 
they counted, clipped out of the magazine. 
Myers locked up hers in a crayon-decorated tur- 
key pen for easy handling. Friedlander care- 
lessly threw his in, not even thinking about the 
consequences of his thoughtless actions. When 
we opened the envelope, all the turkeys fell to 
the floor, killing them instantly. They were 
delicious. 

Loren Neill (Woodland, TX) just sent us his 
name, address, dealer, and choice of prizes, but 
he forgot to tell us how many turkeys he 
counted. W. Yelke (LaGrange, IL) sent us a 
coupon and left the turkey count area empty. 
But of all the absent-minded contestants, Bill 
Cheng (Rivervale, NJ) stands out the most. He 
sent us an empty envelope. 

Family Feud. Not only could the Stark 
family (Gaithersburg, MD) not spell "Softalk" 
correctly, they couldn't agree on the number of 
turkeys either. 

"Dear Sirs: After much debate with my wife 
and son, here's my entry into the Solftalk con- 
test: 348 turkeys. Greg Stark." Sorry, Greg. 

"Dear Sirs: After much debate with my hus- 
band, here's my entry into the Solftalk contest: 
345 turkeys. Anita Stark." Nope. 



"Dear Sirs: I spent the Thanksgiving week- 
end watching my parents trying to count hi-res 
turkeys in your contest. After they both came 
up with different numbers, I decided to count 
them myself to see who is really right. My entry 
is: 349 turkeys. Chris Stark." Good going, 
Chris. Send your parents to their room without 
supper. 

While the Starks scream it out, take a look 
at Michael Schindler's (Fitchburg, MA) entry. 
He sent it via Express Mail. Never mind that his 
turkey count (334) was considerably short. 
Schindler spent $9.35 on postage to get his entry 
here on time. That's dedication. 

You Want What for a Prize? Then there's 
the subject of what people want if they win. The 
prize was the usual $100 in goodies made by our 
advertisers. Some contestants weren't so easily 
satisfied. Apparently, our overwhelming gen- 
erosity was not enough. More people than 
you'd want us to list requested that we send 
them some real turkeys as the prize. Not Gary 
Kielar (Clinton, NY). He wanted us to send 
him someone to get all the turkeys out of his 
office. 

"If I should win," wrote Mark "No Return 
Address" Chan, "I hope you can award me 
with $100 cash instead of $100 worth of goods. 
This is because I don't have and cannot afford a 
computer." Can't do that, Mark, but we will 
give you $1,400 worth of advice on which com- 
puter you should buy. Get the hint? 

Michael Varga (San Francisco, CA) said he 
would make out a check for $2,000 in Softalk's 
name to the Rhode Island House for the Nasal- 
ly Deficient. Though $2,000 is nothing to sneeze 
at, we don't take bribes. Well, most of us don't. 

Finally, Matt Dixon (Bloomington, IN) and 
Chris Nenzel (Reno, NV) actually owe us 
prizes. Between the two of them, they re- 
quested Apple Panic, Crossfire, Frogger, and a 
TG Track Ball — all for the Atari computer. 

Is He, or Isn't He? The votes are in; the 
peoples' voices have been heard. "No way!" 
was the cry. No way did the readers believe that 
the clumsy-looking beginner on the Beginners' 
Corner page is Bill Budge. Well, we can't fool 
you. You're all correct. Bill Budge is not a be- 
ginner. But that's him in the picture, all right! 

Steve Rosenberg (Moraga, CA) can't be 
fooled. Rosenberg was yanked out at random 
from all the entries that correctly identified 
Budge as the beginning bungler. For his ability 
to recognize pinball wizards at a glance, Rosen- 
berg will receive a copy of BudgeCo's Pinball 
Construction Set. 

We understand that the thought of Budge 
being a beginner is a ridiculous one. That's why 
we understand why the piles of postcards that 
poured in were two-to-one on the "No way" 
side. We sympathize with you all. 

But what we won't tolerate is cheating. 
Watch out for Scott Nelson (Minneapolis, 
MN), John Estell (Maumee, OH), Marc Ries 
(Whittier, CA), and Donna DeBonis (a school- 
teacher, yet!) (Farrell, PA) in the next election. 
Each submitted both "No way" and "That's 
him all right" votes. 

Next month: Oracle results start anew. DI

If your printer uses your Apple 
more than you do, 
you need The Bufferboard. 



If your Apple is locked into the "PRINT" 
mode so much that you've taken up soli- 
taire to kill the boredom, you need a 
buffer. And if your computer is the Apple 
II or III, the only buffer for you is The 
Bufferboard. Expandable to 64K of stor- 
age, The Bufferboard stores an instantane- 
ous bucketful of print data from your 
computer. Then it feeds the data to your 
printer at its own printing rate. Your Apple 
is set free from driving your printer and is 
ready for more data from you. 



or expensive power supplies are needed 
because The Bufferboard fits right into 
your Apple — and docks onto your existing 
printer interface. The result is convenient 





Take your existing interface — 
and buffer it! 

Only The Bufferboard has a simple 
Interface-Docking System. No bulky boxes 



and economical buffering of most popu- 
lar printer interfaces, including the 
Grappler + ™ interface, Epson interface, 
and Apple printer interface. Thirty sec- 
onds and a single hook-up are all you need 
to end the printer waiting game forever. 

Up to 20 letter-size pages 
stored at a time. 

The Bufferboard comes standard with 
16K, and is expandable to 32K or 64K of 
buffering capacity with the addition of 




memory chips. This "bucket" will hold up 
to 20 pages of a print job, allowing you 
freedom to use your Apple. 

The Bufferboard — designed 
exclusively for the Apple Computer. 

Specifications: 

• Versions for Grappler + interface, Epson 
interface, Apple interface, and other popu- 
lar printer interfaces • 16K buffer standard 

• Upgradeable to 32K or 64K • Automatic 
memory configuration • Automatic self 
test • Includes interface docking cable. 

The Bufferboard is made by Orange 
Micro, Inc. ; the same people who brought 
you the popular Grappler + printer inter- 
face. Both the Grappler + and The 
Bufferboard are now available at your 
local Apple dealer.

With the speed of light and a hearty "Heigh-ho, 
Lisa," Apple Computer roared back to the 
forefront of microcomputer technology at the 
annual meeting of their stockholders January 19 when they 
unveiled Lisa, their answer to corporate America's desktop 
computer needs. With equal fanfare, they brought forth the 
Apple He personal computer. 

It was the Silicon Gulch equivalent of Hollywood an- 
nouncing that Bo Derek and George Burns would costar in a 
movie. We all know where attention will be riveted. And we 
all know who'll get upstaged. 

Lisa is definitely the computer of men's dreams. It's got 
gizmos in places where other computers don't even have 
places. If Sports Illustrated followed the lead of its sister pub- 
lication, Time, it would feature machines in its infamous bath- 
ing suit issue. Lisa would make the cover and the centerfold. 

Lisa's standard model has more luxurious appointments 
than the competition's deluxe edition. In a 100-yard dash, Lisa 
has a 90-yard head start. 

But it's the Apple II that's captured men's hearts. Lisa has 
a mouse, the He is just mousy. Lisa is the high school cheer- 
leader, lie is the girl next door. 

Most important, however, is that Lisa is still in beta test- 
ing. The lie is as available as your local computer store. Lisa 
may have high density drives, but lie has high density sales. 

Lisa is neat, nifty, and ninety-nine ninety-five. That's in 
coin of the realm without decimal points. Few folks will be 
trotting into their local computeria, MasterCard in hand, to 
buy one for Junior. 

He retails at $1,395 for a standard 64K RAM machine. 
Like George Burns, the He has thinning hair, aching joints, 
and makes us laugh in delight as it does one improbable task 
after another that senior citizens aren't supposed to be able to 
do. Lots of Juniors will be benefiting from the He. 

Lisa may have the glamor (see "Lisa's Debut"), but Ap- 
ple clearly wasn't blinded for a second by the beauty of the 
newcomer. Their update to the Apple II is a thoughtful amal- 
gam of hardware changes that honors the software and 
peripherals industries that have made Apple II the most used 
and the most useful microcomputer.

Introduce your Apple to 
thousands of new programs 
with the new Microsoft SoftCard. 



A more powerful Apple. When you add the new Microsoft 
SoftCard system to your Apple II or II Plus, you also add 
the ability to run thousands of CP/M-80" based programs. 
Languages. Utilities. Applications programs that range 
from word processing and data base management to analysis 
and forecasting tools. Thousands of software tools for busi 
ness, professions and the home. Tools that can turn your 
Apple into a far more productive machine. And, the 
new SoftCard system is enhanced, allowing you to 
run 60K programs. If you already have a SoftCard 
system, ask your dealer about Microsoft's 
inexpensive upgrade kit. 
Two computers in one. With the 
SoftCard system, your Apple becomes 
two computers. One that runs Apple 
software, another that runs 
CP/M-80. Which means you'll 
double the utility of your computer. 
A complete solution. The SoftCard 
system includes everything. The easy-to- 
install SoftCard circuit board. The CP/M-80 
operating system. Microsoft BASIC plus 
GBASIC for graphics applications. And, the utilities 
you need to manage CP/M-80 files. 

Why Microsoft? Microsoft was the first personal computer 
software manufacturer. The very first. Today, Microsoft software 
is running on well over a million computers worldwide. 
There's a reason. Microsoft has earned a reputation for better 




software. Products that work. Products that are 
constantly being enhanced. And when the 
enhanced versions are ready, we make 
the enhancements available to our 
customers. Like the 60K enhance- 
r ment for the SoftCard system. That 
kind of product support is just one of 
■P the ways we earned our reputation.

That homage to their past has been a salient 
point in each change Apple has made to their II 
series, and the installed base of Apple owners 
can take great comfort in knowing that the 
company has remained steadfast in their dedi- 
cation to their old constituency. Even the ma- 
jor revisions executed to accomplish the lie do 
not disenfranchise owners of older systems, nor 
do they invalidate most already existing soft- 
ware and peripherals. 

The Key Changes. But major changes there 
are, ranging from the keyboard to the innards. 

The He keyboard contains sixty-three keys 
and is similar to the Apple III keyboard, sans 
keypad. This keyboard generates lower case as 
well as upper case characters, allowing it access 
to the full ASCII character set. The addition of 
up and down arrow keys completes a set of cur- 
sor controls independent of the old I-J-K-M 
convention. 

Additional keys are tab, caps lock, delete, 
open-apple, and closed-apple. In ordinary 
usage, the open-apple and closed-apple keys are 
seen as paddle buttons. But applications soft- 
ware developers can employ these keys in a 
manner similar to the use of the control key — 
pressed simultaneously with another key, an ap- 
ple key will modify the behavior of the original 
key. 

Adoption of this keyboard should finally solve what has been a 
perennial Apple problem. Rod Holt left Atari to join Steve Wozniak and 
Steve Jobs almost before they left the garage. Holt designed Apple's 
power supply and has been a pioneering technical guru with Apple since 
the Apple I. He says the keyboard "has been the single biggest source of 
problems with customers." 

The first keyboards had separate encoder — Holt likes to call them de- 
coder — boards tucked underneath. The encoder board translated the 
keyboard signal into intelligible computerese for the motherboard, but

the early models seemed to lack uniformity and had low heat resistance 
properties. 

A change in late 1979 to General Instrument keyboards, which had a 
more reliable encoder, ameliorated the problem, but the He takes the so- 
lution one step farther. Signals from the lie keyboard do not stop at an 
encoder en route to the motherboard. Instead, they travel unmodified to 
the motherboard, where they are encoded. One result is a keyboard more 
open to modification. 

Apple is already exploiting that trait in machines marketed in non-

English-speaking countries. Although most software is written with di- 
rections and input prompts in English, users will want to store their data 
in their native language, which probably contains accent marks and spe- 
cial punctuation. 

Special EPROM chips will contain both the American keyboard 
codes and codes for various foreign languages. The user will be able to 
select either set of codes at will by using a switch installed on the front of 
the case. 

Equally significant changes on the motherboard are the culmination 
of a drive for simplification that began with Wozniak in 1978. The origi- 
nal Apple II used off-the-shelf MOS and TTL chip components. Woz 
began searching for ways to integrate functions to reduce the number of 
components on the motherboard. In pursuit of that concept, he engaged 
Synertek to design custom integrated circuits. Synertek put Walt Broed- 
ner in charge of the project, code-named Annie. 

Working in conjunction with Wozniak, Broedner was making sig- 
nificant progress when the project was stopped dead in its tracks by the 
success of the Apple II Plus. The Plus, for those of you weak in comput- 
er history, was essentially a software modification. Integer Basic was re- 
placed as the resident language by Applesoft, and the Autostart ROM, 
which truly made the Apple a turnkey machine, was added. 

This first major alteration of the microcomputer set the precedent 
that Apple has since always followed: Keep your past customers in mind. 
Apple almost immediately introduced ROM cards that permitted early 
Apples to run Applesoft or later Apples to run Integer Basic. In that 
manner, owners of old Apples could upgrade to the new standard and 
owners of new Apples could take advantage of the software base devel- 
oped using the old language. 

Sales of Apple II Plus systems skyrocketed, making the company 
loathe to tinker with what was an outstanding success. Wozniak's IC proj- 
ect was shelved. It resurfaced temporarily a year later, under the name 
Alice; but those gals at the beginning of the alphabet seemed to be a jinx. 
Back into cold storage went the idea. 

In the meantime, under the supervision of Wendel Sander, the Ap- 
ple motherboard kept undergoing minor revisions. Less expensive 16K 
bit chips replaced the earlier 4K bit chips. Grounds on the board were

improved during a change to meet Federal Communications Commis- 
sion radio frequency emission standards. 

Sander, who was the sixteenth employee of Apple and the writer of 
one of the first Star Trek games, viewed the motherboard revision proj- 
ects as analogous to tinkering with the Volkswagen Bug — "small evolu- 
tionary steps and clean-up kinds of things." 

But Sander's motherboard tinkering was not enough to head off 
Wozniak's integration project. It was reactivated in late 1980 under the 
code name Diana as a project to simplify manufacturing by reducing the 
component count. He engineering manager Peter Quinn says the change 
was absolutely necessary. During a period when the company was pro- 
ducing more than thirty thousand units a month, they had, as he de- 
scribed it, "a unit designed to be built in a garage." 

Walt Broedner, the first designer to tackle Woz's concept, joined Ap- 
ple to head the project, which became known as LCA, for "low cost 
Apple." Inside Apple, the term implied a lower cost of manufacturing. 
But others who caught wind of the project name decided it meant a $350 
Apple. To counteract that kind of misconception, the operation inher- 
ited a name that almost lasted the distance: Super II. 

The motherboard that Sander had been caretaking had one hundred 
components. Broedner succeeded in reducing that number to thirty-one 
while increasing capability by the equivalent of an additional one hun- 
dred components. 

Renaissance Chips. Central to that success were two large black 
chips that sit near the 6502 microprocessor on the lie motherboard: the

characters. 



memory management unit (MMU) and the input output unit (IOU). 
Broedner's group was so successful in the design of these chips that the 
first prototypes burned were successful. 

The use of 64K bit RAM chips in place of the 16K bit chips reduced 
the RAM banks from twenty-four chips on the motherboard and eight 
on a language card to a mere eight total. Standard RAM memory is ex- 
panded in this configuration to 64K bytes. The additional 16K not avail- 
able on the Apple II Plus is treated like the old language card, allowing 
the user access to an extra language or additional memory space for text 



editing or data handling. 

In this new RAM configuration, the MMU coordinates access to the 
RAM and supervises bank switching between Apple's ROM and the 
16K of RAM that is the equivalent of the language card. While the 
MMU is so occupied, the IOU handles all the I /O functions of the rede- 
signed keyboard, the peripheral slots, the game I/O port, and the forty 
and eighty column video output. The IOU also controls a set of memory 
locations that serve as soft switches, allowing the user to toggle between 
various graphics modes and display states. 

Not only are there fewer chips in the He, the expansion slot config- 
uration has changed. The on-board virtual language card eliminated the 
need for slot 0, so they took it out, leaving seven fifty-pin slots. Yes, Vir- 
gina, they're numbered one through seven. No more counting like the 
computer does. 

There is an eighth slot, but it's not your common, everyday, run-of- 
the-mill, hey-let's-stick-something-here type of slot. It's a sixty-pin con- 
nector that sits forward of the other seven and allows a new set of signals 
that were not readily accessible to users and manufacturers of periph-

ports. 



erals for the II Plus. Among the possibilities for the slot: a low-cost RGB 
monitor interface. 

Apple is providing an eighty-column card for that slot for $125. The 
card has room for the addition of 64K additional bytes of RAM, ac- 
cessed through a bank-switching technique governed by the MMU. Al- 
though it's difficult to use this memory from Basic software, profession- 
als and expert users will be able to use it as additional storage memory. 

Because the eighty-column application uses only a portion of the ca- 
pabilities of the slot, it's likely that peripheral manufacturers using the 
slot for other purposes will include eighty-column capability as a matter 
of course, opening up a new area of multifunction boards for the Apple. 

In their implementation of the additional slot, Apple again showed an 
attention to detail that redounds to the user's benefit. Many current soft- 
ware packages assume the convention that an eighty-column card will be 
placed in slot 3 and activate the display with a pr#3 directive. 

To remain compatible with existing software acknowledging that 
convention, Apple developed its firmware to recognize pr#3 as the 
eighty-column command if the card is in the special slot. The catch is that 
you can't use the regular slot 3 while the sixty-pin slot is being so ad- 
dressed. Still, He owners will find that most existing software calling for 
eighty-column display will run just fine, a thoughtful touch. 

Other visual differences inside the He include two LEDs. One is a 
power light intended as a hard-to-miss reminder not to remove interface 
cards while the power is on. 

The other LED is primarily for production. Apple attacked the test- 
ing and quality control problem from two angles. During manufactur- 
ing, the motherboard can be put on a burn rack that rigorously controls 
temperatures and cycles the testing during the infant mortality stage. One 
quality control person monitoring large concentrations of tests can now 
have excellent control over the process. 

Should a problem manifest itself in the field, the motherboard can be 
plugged in to diagnostic equipment at a qualified service center. The 
LED will serve as an indicator of problems, speeding diagnosis and serv-

icing. Manufacturing boss Quinn is not expecting too many field prob- 
lems, however. The reduced chip count, better manufacturing, and tight- 
er quality control should result in "awesome" reliability. He says, "You 
should be able to fire a howitzer at it." 

Another innovation inside the lie is an eleven-pin connector for a nu- 
meric keypad. Apple's Accessory Products Division has a keypad for use 
with this connector. 

There are invisible differences inside the He also. The 1 1 Plus had 12K

key, and reset simultaneously. The lie then conducts a twenty-second 
diagnostic of its internal circuitry. 

A II Is a II Is a Two. Other differences between the lie and the II 
Plus appear on the back panel. A nine-pin game control connector is 
situated next to the cassette jacks so you won't have to remove the top to 
change game controllers. Apple is already offering joysticks and paddles 
compatible with the new, sturdier plug. 

The back panel itself is further shielded with a metal plate to cut 
down on radio frequency interference. The cable notches found in the 
back of the II Plus have been replaced with twelve capped holes of vari- 
ous sizes. Interface cables for all Apple's peripherals will have adapters so 
that a cable inside the Apple will lead from the interface card to a hole in 
the back panel where a plug will be installed. The cable from the periph- 
eral attaches to this plug on the outside. Once installed in this way, any 
peripheral can be disconnected without opening the case. 

Even the lid came in for new attention. Pads were put on the back of 
the lid to make the top easier to remove for those who are so inclined. 
For those who are not, such as educators with a classroom full of young- 
sters, there are two new holes in the lid that allow it to be screwed shut. 

For all of these changes, the He is still very definitely an Apple II. It 
has the same Monitor routines and it uses the same disk operating sys- 
tem — the one Wozniak wrote out by hand in a few hours, a feat Rod 
Holt witnessed and termed incredible. It still looks essentially the way 
Jerry Manock designed it. 

It is compatible with most of the software and peripherals that exist 
today. That's by design. Hundreds of hours were spent ensuring com- 
patibility, even to the point of calling some software publishers and mak- 
ing information available to them so they could bring their software into 
line with both the II Plus and the He. 

That's known as keeping the faith with those who helped you get 
where you are, and Apple has won the hearts of the software industry. 
Ten software publishers announced specially tailored packages for the 
He at the unveiling. Simultaneous announcements at other sites by other 
publishers brought that number higher. No other microcomputer has 
benefited from such an outpouring of tangible outside support at the 
time of its introduction. 

Nabbing the VisiNod. Many of the software packages are signifi- 
cant, but perhaps none more so than the presence of VisiCalc: Advanced 
Version. 

The symbiotic relationship that once existed between VisiCorp — then 
Personal Software — and Apple has been well documented. Apple tran- 
scended the damning epithet of toy essentially on the strength of Visi- 
Calc. Likewise, Apple was the only microcomputer in mass distribution 
that was powerful enough and open enough to give Dan Bncklin and 
Robert Frankston the wherewithal with which to work. 

There was a time when VisiCorp had many of the same private in- 
vestors as Apple, the same bankers, the same ad agencies, the same 
growth curve. People started saying VisiCorp was in the Apple emula- 
tion mode. 

Recently, there's been more distance between the two companies. 
Apple has other spreadsheet products and VisiCorp is less dependent on 
its Apple sales for growth. And even when VisiCalc: Advanced Version 
came out for the Apple III, there was a clear understanding that the IBM 
Personal Computer would be next. 

Indeed, the companies were proceeding along parallel lines in de- 
veloping an overall user friendly approach to software — Apple through 
its Lisa and VisiCorp through its Visi-On. With the two companies striv- 
ing to be best at bringing Xerox Star technology to microcomputers, it 
looked like rapprochement might never occur. 

Instead of an ever widening rift, the 128K version of the lie has again 
brought VisiCorp to the fount from whence their wealth originally 
sprang. In choosing the He over any other micro as the successor to the 
II for its Advanced Version, VisiCorp has essentially ratified the He as 
leader of the pack. A He version of VisiFile is also in the works. Visi- 
Corp's David Spenser calls the He " a nice machine. It's going to do well." 

Exciting from the perspective of the approach to the He market are 
the offerings from Microsoft and Broderbund. Microsoft's Multiplan, 
which has been narrowing the gap between it and VisiCalc in the Apple 
market, will recognize the He and take advantage of its extended mem-

ory and eighty-column features from the same disk that runs on the II 
Plus. As a caveat to that statement: Make sure the version of Mtdtiplan 
you get is 1.04 or later. Microsoft is also bringing out the Applesoft Com- 
piler in a He version. 

Broderbund took the same tack as Microsoft. Their Bank Street 
Writer will run on either the II Plus or the He, automatically recognizing 
which machine it is in and adapting itself to the features of that system. 
New He owners need beware, however. Some early Broderbund prod- 
uct was not initially compatible with the He. The company has taken cor- 
rective action, but make sure you buy the right version. 

The combined package approach is a heartening trend for the sever- 
al hundred thousand II Plus owners. If publishers follow the lead of 




Microsoft and Broderbund, there'll be no shortage of new software for 
the older machine, nor will there be any confusion in the marketplace — 
one size fits all. 

The Jack of Apples. The appearance of The Incredible Jack from 
Business Solutions among the lie specific software is almost a travesty. If 
there were any justice, Business Solutions would be the only company 
making a software announcement. This is the single current program 
that from the conception stages was intended for the He only. When 
Apple's development time on the new machine became extended, Busi- 
ness Solutions retrofitted it to the II Plus. 

The Incredible Jack draws its name from your ordinary garden-vari- 
ety jack-of-all-trades. That's what this program is: a spreadsheet, a data- 
base, and a word processor in one integrated package. It's the Apple and 
eight-bit answer to MBA and 1-2-3, widely heralded and praised soft- 
ware packages for the IBM pc. 

The lie is even generating converts among the heretofore unwashed. 
Or perhaps it's more apt to say the only hesitandy converted. Software 
Dimensions has had a potent accounting series for some time, doing ex- 
cellently in the CP/M world. Their interest in Apple was not what one 
might call intense, as indicated by the fact that they parceled the rights in 
the Apple market off to Systems Plus, a professional marketeer. 

The package was A ccounting Plus and Systems Plus moved aggres- 
sively into the market, seizing the high ground from Apple's BPI pack- 
age and consistently running as the second-ranked accounting series. Re- 
cently Software Dimensions had tentatively entered the Apple market in 
their own right in support of the package. But an ostensibly CP/M-based 
company with apparently lukewarm feelings about the Apple market is 
not a likely place in which to find enthusiasm about an upgraded 
Apple II. 

Nevertheless, enthusiasm is where you find it, and few wax as en- 
thusiastic about the He as Jeff Gold, author of the package. Software Di- 
mensions began their effort as a simple conversion, changing as few lines 
of code as possible to get the benefit of the advanced features. 

As they delved into the system, they began to get excited about the 
possibilities the He presented. They felt the added features gave them the 
potential to write the best accounting series found on a micro. In the end, 
they gutted the code from their five-module series and built five new 
modules that specifically use all the new features to the maximum. 

Gold claims, ". . . the Apple He is a strong enough product that it de- 



serves its own program." That's what it got in Accounting Plus Super /e. 
Three modules — general ledger, accounts payable, and accounts receiv- 
able — are ready for sale, with inventory and payroll to follow soon. 

Apple's documentation section rethought its approach to a novice 
user in its manuals for the He and appears to have put together the best 
bunch yet by a major manufacturer, although that's faint praise in an 
area where mediocrity abounds. 

But they'll get some immediate help in bringing the new He owner on 
board from Muse. The Baltimore folks seem to have done the most work 
of any company, changing their entire line to take advantage of the ad- 
ditional features. For the first-time owner, Muse's Know Your Apple He 
should be a must buy. 

In addition, two versions of Super-Text are major contributions. Su- 
per-Text Professional, formerly known as Super-Text 40-80, and Super- 
Text Home /Office, formerly known as Super-Text 40-56-70, are avail- 
able in special He versions. The Pro version adds on-screen formatting 
and on-line help functions to an already strong package. 

One of the companies needing to do the most work was Sierra On- 
Line. Some was voluntary, but some was not. Sierra voluntarily sank 
man-months of effort into recasting ScreenWriter II, their bestselling 
word processor. Using the computer's lower case and eighty-column ca- 
pabilities cut 8K off the code. Sierra also modified General Manager for 
use on the He, girding for a battle with VisiCorp's VisiFile. The Sierra 
On-line packages are marketed separately for the He and the Plus cur- 
rently, but Sierra president Ken Williams vows to join the one-package- 
fits-all crowd before the dog days of summer. 

Keystone Ken. Sierra found their new copy protection scheme, Spira- 
disc, wouldn't run on the He. So it was back to the drawing boards in 
search of a new scheme that'd secure the code and still respond to the lie. 
Never a dull moment in the cops-and-robbers trade. 

Clearly, the software publishers think the new machine is business- 
oriented. Heavy duty competition is already apparent among the spread- 
sheet, database, and word processor programs. Artsci magnifies that 
competition with its two modified entries, Magic Window He for the

Unless otherwise noted, all products can be assumed to run on either Apple

Apple II programs will run on the Apple III in the emulator mode. 

A.E. by Jun Wada and Makoto Horai. A-One would be a more appro- 
priate title than A .E. The folks from San Rafael, with a little help from 
Tokyo, have another winner, another game that's a joy to behold and a 
pleasure to play. 

The object is to chase out of the city, the planet, and the whole galaxy 
some scientific experiments run amok. The experiments were intended to 
be pollution control devices; gone wild, they swoop, soar, and strafe with 
a vengeance. A .E. stands for stingray in Japanese, which is what the ber- 
serker safeguards look like: flying stingrays. (Not the General Motors 
variety, but the type you would not wish to step on at the beach.) 

The mechanical flatfish attack in waves of six, flying in and out of 
the scenery with reckless abandon. In and out of, in front of, and behind, 
all in striking 3-D. There are eight different scenes, each progressively 
farther removed from home, representing your success in chasing the 
stingrays farther away. In each case, the A.E. dart in and out of build- 
ings, mountains, asteroids, planets, and stars. Sometimes the stingrays 
split into pairs or trios to attack in concert; sometimes they attack indi- 
vidually. They drop bombs with some frequency, although their favorite 
technique for destruction appears to be a simple hit and run. 

To discourage these pocket mantas and drive them from the current 
surroundings, you have to destroy three waves in their entirety. Should 
just one of a wave escape during an attack, it returns with a full comple- 
ment of its kind. It takes getting all of three groups to go on to the 
next scene. 

Shooting at the stingrays in A.E. involves greater precision in timing 
than the usual frenzied button-pounding type defense. When you fire, 
you launch a delayed blast projectile; letting up on the trigger stops the 
missile and detonates it. Thus, you can shoot at the A.E. when they 
appear far in the distance, tiny and close together, or when they're full- 
size up close. Exploding a projectile right in front of a moving line of 
stingrays can result in some interesting chain reactions. It's not uncom- 
mon to wipe out an entire wave with one well-placed shot. 

The graphics in A.E. are superb. The stingrays smoothly transform 
from specks in the distance to graceful flyers in the foreground, swirling 
and diving in a seemingly endless variety of patterns before ducking 
behind a planet or vanishing into the distance. This is the first computer 
arcade ballet! Even the chain explosions are detailed and smooth. 
Curiously, authors Wada and Horai have chosen to use only three 
colors; it works nicely. 

Best of all, A.E. plays well. The game involves thought and timing, 
not simply reflexes. There is enough variety in each level to prevent bore- 
dom. As the game progresses, the stingrays change patterns; they quit 
playing follow the leader and attack singly or in pairs, making it much 
harder to wipe out all participants in a wave. 

And so the parade of winners from Broderbund continues. DA

Pinball Construction Set. By Bill Budge. If you've been losing sleep 
wondering when Bill Budge was going to come up with another pro- 
gram, you can kick the Sominex habit. And rest assured: Budge's sec- 
ond offering on the BudgeCo label is every bit as significant as his first 
and even more innovative. 

Arcade games are plenty of fun, but they stir a special yearning in 
some. There are many more people capable of designing a good game 
than there are people who can write the code to prove it. So the original 



pinball wizard has donated his programming skills to the benefit of all 
those who would try their hands at pinball game design. And he has 
done it extremely well. 

The Pinball Construction Set, which Budge has dubbed the first soft- 
ware toy, is disarmingly easy to use. He has provided an array of tools, 
paints, and parts and the walls of a generic pinball game layout. You ma- 
nipulate all the objects with a joystick; you hardly have to touch the 
keyboard. 

Each tool's function is represented by its hi-res shape. A pointing 
hand moves copies of the objects from the parts display to the pinball 
board, leaving the original as it was. If you decide you don't like where 
you put it, pick it up again and move it. To get rid of it altogether, drop it 
anywhere in the parts display and it will vanish. Sloppy work habits 
aren't forbidden; they're impossible. 

Walls are built and shaped with other tools. Selecting any of these 
tools causes the program to display small white squares along the edges 
of the walls. The walls behave as if they were defined by rubber bands 
stretched between these points. With an arrow pointer you can move any 
of the points, and so change the shape of the wall. You can add points 
with a hammer and remove them with a pair of scissors. Budge may mix 
his metaphors, but he gets the point across. With these three tools, you 
can create walls that break at odd angles or define elegant curves. And, 
no matter how complicated a wall you design, the ball bounces or rolls 
off it right every time. 

By the time you've set up a wall or two and put in a pair of flippers, 
you'll probably be itching to bounce a ball around and see how it works. 
As easily done as said: simply put a ball on the board and push the play 
button. (Like all the other buttons and tools, this one is marked with an 
appropriate hi-res symbol rather than a word. You not only don't have 
to be a programmer to make a good pinball game, you don't even have 
to be literate.) 

When you hit the play button, any balls you placed on the board 
start to roll. You hit them, they bounce off objects, score points, and so 
on. When you've seen enough, you can go back to add, move, remove, 
and redesign. Then try it out again until you get it right. 

Aesthetic appeal is as important as function in a good arcade game. 
Budge has provided for artistic expression with two painting modes. 
With one, indicated by a paint brush, you can color entire areas with a 
warp-speed fill routine. For the fine detail work — anything from little 
pictures to your pinball machine's name in big, bold type — you can use a 
magnifying glass pointer to edit the screen pixel by pixel. 

Other buttons control other functions. A picture of an and gate gets 
you the wiring kit, with which you can decide the scores for all the ob- 
jects in your game. You can even tell it to award bonus points for hitting 
special combinations of targets. 

A button that will appeal to the megalomaniac in everyone is shaped 
like the world. It allows you to change the laws of physics in your game, 
adjusting the pull of gravity, the kick of the bumpers, the elasticity of col- 
lisions with the wall, and even the passage of time itself. 

The final button takes you to the disk menu. Here you can save your 
work in one of two forms. You can put it in a data file so you can modi- 
fy it at a later time. Or you can compile your game. Then you can play it 
any time, copy it, or give it to your friends. The compiled game runs in- 
dependently of the Pinball Construction Set program. 

Bill Budge seems to have spent his professional life setting standards 
for other programmers to follow, and Pinball Construction Set is no ex- 
ception. Budge's joystick-controlled symbolic menu, allowing options to 
be selected without your work ever leaving the screen, is so easy that it 
makes designing the games more fun than playing them. DD

Bank Street Writer. By Gene Kusmiak and the Bank Street College of 
Education. "It's all right, I s'pose," our recently anticomputer art direc- 
tor said of the following review, "but it doesn't capture what I feel about 
Bank Street Writer." 

How, then, did he feel? 

"Delirious! 

"Until now all I could do on the Apple was play games. But Bank 
Street Writer does stuff. 

"Yesterday, I looked around the office for a computer with a printer 
and paper. I didn't consider what it had in it or anything. And Bank 
Street Writer didn't care. It just booted and I wrote and it printed and I 
sealed and mailed. 

"I don't have to learn computers to use one anymore. That's what's 
really great about Bank Street Writer. It just does stuff." 

The preceding is a true story; documentation available upon request 
from the horse's mouth. 

The reviewer couldn't say it as well as the horse, but here's the re- 
view anyway to fill in the details. 

Broderbund doesn't hesitate to do the unexpected. Consider the new 
word processor from this publisher of top quality, future-of-the-art pro- 
grams: it won't give you eighty-column display, or complex formats, or 
macros, or split screens, or superscripts, or subscripts, or footnotes, or 
graphics in the middle, or underlining, or expanded text, or instant 
success. 

But what it will do it does with grace and excellence, and what Bank 
Street Writer will do is simply all you ever need for word processing at 
home or in the executive suite. 

Bank Street Writer provides general word processing capabilities in a 
simple, uncomplicated program that just about anyone can have up and 
running in less than ten minutes, and it does it at a very low price. The 
closest comparative word processor is the original Apple Writer, except 
that Bank Street Writer is, withal its simplicity, state of the art. 

The surprise is all the things Bank Street Writer does do. It has global 
search and replace, and it remembers for you to go to the beginning be-

fore searching. It moves sections of text around according to your will, 
and it puts them back if you change your mind. It indents and centers, 
though it doesn't justify (justification without proportional spacing 
would be better forgotten anyway). 

And, when you boot it up, it knows what machine it's running on. 
Bank Street Writer requires 48K, but if you have 64K, it automatically 
uses it; if you have a lie, it simplifies itself even more by using the arrows 
instead of the I-J-K-M diamond for editing and the open and close apple 
keys for moving around the menus. And, if your lie happens to be 
equipped with 128K, it extends itself into that area too. 

Other modifications are available with your help. On the He, of 
course, Bank Street Writer automatically uses shift key upper and lower 
case. On lis, you must tell it if you have a shift key mod. Bank Street 
Writer recognizes all lower case chips. On all machines, you must tell it 
where your printer lives, what disk drive you want it to send data to, and 
all that sort of thing. But you need only tell it once, unless you change 
your mind. 

Not all the screen is reserved by Bank Street Writer for input. The in- 
put area is delineated by a rectangle. In a four-line area above the rec- 
tangle appear all the commands you need for what you're doing, includ- 
ing the commands to stop what you're doing and do something else in- 
stead. If you want to move a paragraph, you first move to the menu; al- 
though your text stays on the screen, you can now move all around it via 
the editing keys for your computer. Move appears as an item on the 
menu. When you invoke it, clear instructions about what to do next ap- 
pear one after another as you carry them out. 

From the menu, you can go to the transfer menu (that's all there is) 
where you can transfer stuff to or from disk, in and out of memory, or 
onto paper and transfer yourself out of the program. 

There are a few other commands, unnecessary but convenient, that 
you can learn from documentation — or you can get along very well with- 
out them if you please. These are for things like indenting blocks of copy, 
centering things, moving to the beginning or end of data, or moving in 
twelve-line chunks. 

Bank Street Writer prints drafts — always the same — and final copy, 
for which you get to override your saved format choices. 

Broderbund doesn't hesitate to do the unexpected. No one could 
imagine why on earth they would be bringing another word processor in- 
to a market swimming in them; no one had expected them to do that. 

Now it's out and it isn't what anyone expected not a competitor at 
all, but a new idea. They've brought a Ford into a field glutted with 
Cadillacs and Lincolns and Mercedes. 

Now that we've seen Bank Street Writer, what won't be unexpected 
is watching it take off like the Mustang. t1(T

Bolo. By Elvyn Software. Unheralded and unassuming, Bolo may well 
become one of the hit games of the season. 

Bolo is officially a home-arcade game, but there are elements of other 
genres. It takes place in a maze, but the maze resembles those of Wizard- 
ry or Wayout more than that of Pac-Man. It's a shoot-out, but you must 
go find the little devils; they won't bother you until you're near their fort. 
Even then, at a point apiece it doesn't much matter whether you shoot 
them or not; your object is to destroy their forts — at a hundred points 
apiece, six per maze. Prices rise with levels. 

The maze is generated anew every game; you can see about 1/132 of 
its' clean, fine, hi-res walls per screen; you can also see your fire-direction 
indicator and a chart showing in which directions from you the forts are 
located. Then you hunt for them. 

You can control your speed just as you control direction. You can 
shoot in other directions than you're moving. When you come upon the 
little monsters, they tool along at a fixed speed, rather like ants about an 
anthill. They shoot back, however. In fact, they shoot first, if they spot 
you first. 

On level two and up, the critters aren't so obliging; they come after 
you, knowingly and fast. Besides choosing your level, you can opt for 
denser mazes — they're harder to manipulate, but it's rumored that the 
baddies can't gang up on you quite so much.

Somehow, these simple ingredients have been put together in just the 
right dosages to be totally enthralling and delightful. 

When you've played yourself out on A.E. and Wavy Navy and you're 
not really up for the creative experience of Pinball Construction, you're 
apt to find yourself reaching again and again for Bob — a truly relaxing, 
truly engrossing, thoroughly challenging, altogether very addictive game.

Karel the Robot. By Richard E. Pattis. Karel is a strange kind of ro- 
bot — he won't cook or wash dishes, and he can't fly a spaceship or run a 
city. In fact, he can't do much of anything in the Real World . . . but he 
can do an interesting, and possibly useful, thing inside your head he can 
teach you to think in Pascal. 

Pascal is a programming language for computers, a set of rules that 
lets you write instructions to the machine that it can "understand" and 
execute. There are several programming languages around — Basic is 
one — but Pascal is fast becoming the most popular for many applica- 
tions. This is partly because it can "talk to everybody"; it runs on many 
different kinds of computers and its programs are organized so that any- 
one can follow the logic, given the rules. 

Karel the Robot runs on a subset of Pascal — a simplified version, a 
sort of "pidgin Pascal," that will help you get used to the rather odd 
structural requirements of the language. Karel can teach you most of the 
grammar and syntax of Pascal and the rules of logical organization; once 
you have that foundation, learning the rest should be easy. 

Karel — named after Karel Capek, whose play R.U.R. gave us the 
word robot — is a very simple robot in a very simple world. He has few ca- 
pabilities and no mind of his own; but within his limits he's the perfect 
slave — he obeys orders exactly. Of course, you have to give him exactly 
the right orders. . . . 

Karel takes his orders from a program, written in advance by you; 
and therein lies the challenge: to design a program that will accomplish 



his task. However, this is not as difficult as you might think, for two rea- 
sons: first, you (the programmer) choose what task Karel is to do, so you 
can make it as easy as you want; and, second, Karel's world is so simple 
and his abilities so limited that you don't have a great many possibilities 
to choose among. 

Karel's world is a rectangular grid of streets (running east-west) and 
avenues (running north-south). The world also contains walls; which can 
be built across a street or avenue, blocking Karel's path; and beepers, 
small objects that Karel can pick up, carry with him, and put down 
again. 

Karel's working vocabulary consists of four instructions: Move, 
Turnleft, Pickbeeper, and Putbeeper. Move means "straight ahead one 
block"; the others are obvious. There is also a fifth instruction, Turnoff; 
but that's an end-of-program mark, not a working instruction. 

Karel can also make various Tests, to determine which direction he's 
facing in, or whether he's next to a wall, or if there's a beeper on the cor- 
ner with him, and so on. And he can choose what to do next on the basis 
of the Test results — known to programmers as conditional branching. 

He can do program loops, too, repeating an action until a certain re- 
sult is achieved. And there is a rule for creating new instructions out of 
combinations of old ones — for example, you can define a Turnright in- 
struct'on. For all its simplicity, Karel's instruction set is actually quite 
powerful. 

And that, of course, was the idea; simple, so it would be easy to un- 
derstand and learn; and powerful, so Karel could behave in some ways 
like a real robot. 

One thing about this program is very unusual. Most programs come 
with a book of some sort, but the book is less important than the pro- 
gram itself — a support device for the program. With Karel, the program 
is a support device for the book. 

The book is called Karel the Robot: A Gentle Introduction to the Art of 
Programming (also available separately), and is a complete textbook in 
the programming language Karel uses, which was designed specifically as

an introduction to Pascal. The rest of the system, two disks and a user 
guide, is a lab kit for the book — a model of Karel that you can use to 
practice what you learn from the text. 

The system allows you to create a world for Karel by placing walls 
and beepers at various locations on the grid. You can copy the problems 
in the book or create new ones. These world patterns can be saved on 
disk for use with various tasks and programs for Karel. 

Then you assign Karel a task, such as, "Go and get the beeper on the 
corner of Sixth Street and Ninth Avenue and return without hitting any 
walls on the way"; and, finally, you write the program that will enable 
him to do that. 

Then you run the program and see if it works. You can select the exe- 
cution speed, run the program step by step (forward or backward), have 
the system explain what's happening at every step, or choose from vari- 
ous other options. 

If your program doesn't work — leaving Karel off in left field some- 
where, looking for nonexistent beepers — you can edit it and try again. 
Eventually, Karel will end up in the right place, having done all the right 
things — and you will have learned something. 

This is a teaching device, not a game; after you've learned to write 
correct programs for Karel, there's not very much else you can do with 
him. But by that time you'll be ready for Pascal. 

One final word: the user guide tells you that you must do several 
housekeeping tasks before you start — tasks with frightening names like 
"krunch the disk." This is not true; you don't have to do these things 
first. There is room on the disk as supplied to record a couple of short 
programs and experiment with them. After you've used that up, you'll be 
more familiar with the system and the housekeeping jobs won't look so 
awful. JR

Does even the slightest sway of a car turn you a delicate shade of green? 
If you are an unfortunate sufferer of mal de mer, don't even attempt to 
look at this game, much less try to play it. However, if you feel like John 
Paul Jones this evening, and a swaying deck underfoot just races your 
adrenalin, then board the U.S.S. Sirius for a real challenge. 

The ship appears to be fighting either in the Pacific during a typhoon 
or during a North Sea winter convoy run to Murmansk. The roughness 
of the sea is incredible. The waves are thirty feet tall! They ripple across 
the screen like sine waves, while you attempt to wage war against a fierce 
enemy air force. 

The planes fly straight for a while, then become kamikaze fighters, 
diving straight at the ship. On higher levels the planes imitate Stuka dive 
bombers. The planes are well protected by squads of helicopter gun- 
boats that fly down and spray very accurate machine gun fire. Long- 
range bombers periodically appear and saturate the air with bombs, 
which are difficult to avoid. After a few waves of attackers are de- 
stroyed, the enemy starts launching Exocet guided missiles. These mis- 
siles love to skim just the tops of each wave, forcing the ship down into 
the trough of the wave. That would not really be a hardship, except that 
it seems the storm also displaced some of the enemy's mine fields. These 
mines appear occasionally along the troughs of the waves, forcing the 
ship up to the wave's crest. 

Imagine yourself, the skipper of the flagship, forced to perch on the 
side of a rolling wave with mines underneath and missiles overhead. 
While being divebombed and shot at by helicopters, you try to shoot 
down the whole air force. What should be your reward for succeeding 
against these unthinkable odds? Wavy Navy is certainly not chintzy when 
handing out promotions. A landlubber who survives all eight levels of 
the beginner mode can rise from galley slave to the rank of admiral. Old 
seadogs will want to try the expert mode, where the ultimate prize for 
completing the tenth level is the presidency. (Quick trivia question: 
Which United States presidents, if any, were naval heroes? Don't look 
now, but the answer's on page 2.) 

As many as four players can participate in this rolling madhouse at 
one time. What a game to play on a Saturday afternoon with a group of 
friends and a keg of grog! However enjoyed, Wavy Navy is Sirius's best

List Handler. List Handler's main function is to manage large lists of in- 
formation. Besides facilitating the retrieval of selected and sorted infor- 
mation, the program allows you to create customized form letters based 
on the content of a list file. List Handler can also exchange data with 
other programs that use DIF format or data exchange. 

It's easy to use; the program manual provides step-by-step tutorials 
for each feature, and helpful on-screen menus identify the command op- 
tions available at each step. 

Powerful field-selector, logical-operator-selector, and sort-order op- 
erations are defined on-screen in readily understandable English. These 
operations use the arrow keys to page rapidly through the options. No 
previous knowledge of the logical operator is required, nor do you have 
to learn special logical symbols. In this sense List Handler comes close to 
the ideal of a "natural language" program. 

List Handler is especially designed to work with the Word Handler 
word processing system; the program also works with text files created 
by a number of other word processing programs. To facilitate word 
processing, upper and lower case text in a seventy-column display is 
provided on a standard Apple II Plus without additional hardware. 

List Handler is a flexible, fast, and powerful information-handling 
system. The program can handle three thousand records of four thou- 
sand characters in length each, with up to 255 fields within a record. In 
turn, each field can be 256 characters in length. If you've developed an 
extended list that requires two storage disks and you have two drives, 
both disks can be logged on at the same time. The program allows log- 
ging on of an extended list on multiple drives. Up to eight disk drives can 
be on-line simultaneously. And List Handler can perform such random 
multidisk sorts at extremely high speeds. 

The program does require a certain amount of initial organization. 
The manual does a good job of guiding the user through the labyrinth of 
procedures. 

List Handler is a bargain, especially in view of the form letter capa- 



bility and the large and flexible record and field sizes allowed. BDV

Demon's Forge. By Brian Fargo. The king's infamous dungeon maze, 
the Demon's Forge, is open for adventurers, but it seems the king was 
not pleased when someone got drunk and killed four of his guards. An- 
cient rumor hints at an exit from this evil place, but no one in living 
memory has verified it. Most of those unfortunate enough to be cast 
down here become a snack for the keeper of the dungeon, the demon 
Anarakull. 

Clothes and weapons are not part of your dungeon tour package. 
The king was gracious enough to allow a small packet of rations. The 
first level of the dungeon seems deceptively easy. You only need to watch 
out where you put your hands! 

The entire maze is diabolically laid out in modules. When you finally 
solve the entrance to the next module and exit the old one, you find that 
it's a one-wav trip. If you haven't brought along all the correct items, 
there's no way back to get them. Luckily the game has a built-in multi- 
ple game save feature. The cautious adventurer always saves a game be- 
fore venturing into the next module. 

Most items in this dungeon either are not what they seem or have ex- 
traordinary characteristics. Beware of the killer rabbits on loan from 
Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Illusion reigns supreme and every- 
thing should be examined, pushed, or prodded. But be careful! 

The hi-res graphics are good and some of the effects are quite inter- 
esting. The parser, however, is not very forgiving. The player must use the 
exact word or phrase to achieve a desired effect. In some cases the phrase 
required seems needlessly obscure. 

Demon's Forge is a good first effort by a new software house. It is 
highly recommended to the intermediate level adventurer. Persistent nov- 
ices may also be able to complete the hazardous journey. RRA

SOCTAI V 



FEBRUARY 1983 



well as for entertainment, it was inevitable that programs aimed at the 
philatelist would begin appearing. 

Described by its publishers as "A powerful database program 
[which] consists of six programs," The Stamp Collector disk does con- 
tain a very general database management program and a file transfer 
utility for sorting and copying. The other four "programs" are merely ex- 
amples (Foreign Stamp List, Domestic Stamp List, Meeting List, 
Sources List) of files that one could construct from the DBM program. 
With a fair amount of patience and no knowledge of computer pro- 
gramming per se, you could construct similar files for books, cars, base- 
ball scores, telephone numbers, or scientific names for fish! Andent (a 
dental corporation, actually) also markets what appears to be the identi- 
cal DBM program with numismatic examples as The Coin Collector 
Catalog. 

Adapting The Stamp Collector to philately is a task that still rests 
squarely on the shoulders of the user. The DBM program permits you to 
assign, within generous limits, characteristics under which you wish to 
classify any stamp or cover (or fish, birthday, or recipe, for that matter). 
For example, the country of origin could be one such heading, although 
it might be better to create a separate file for each country to avoid hav- 
ing to key in the name for each item. Then you might want the catalog 
number, condition, value, price paid, date of purchase, source, or stor- 
age location. Figuratively speaking, the program provides you with the 
pencil and paper; you must decide what you wish to write. Whether any- 
one could devise a universal data system for stamp collectors is debat- 
able, but certainly Andent has not. 

Report generation, the typical end product of these files, requires some 
experimenting by the user to develop a suitable format. The instructions 
are unclear and don't always agree in detail with the disk. 

Some of the format generation questions refer to information that is 
no longer on the monitor screen, having been scrolled off by the pre- 
vious questions. Some questions are answered by depressing a single key; 
others require a key plus return; the user has no advance clue. 

The use of "default responses" (answers requiring only the use of the 



return key), augmented by reverse field and/or flashing characters, 
would greatly improve 'user interaction with the keyboard. Too many 
questions lead to a possible dead end, with no means of backing out. At 
one point we're allowed to choose between creating a new report format 
or deleting an existing one, but there is no explanation in the manual or 
on the monitor screen as to how the existing format is to be identified, 
and there is no parachute by which to escape should we wish to take nei- 
ther action. Instead of making a graceful exit, we must reset and start the 
format generating process all over from scratch. 

Finally, the choice of a suitable printer is somewhat less than infi- 
nite. The program claims to be selectable between the IDS 440 Paper 
Tiger, the Epson MX-80, and the Centronics 737/739. However, when 
the Centronics option is used, the program acknowledges that you have 
just chosen the Epson! Bias? No, just a point of sloppy programming. 
Perhaps the Centronics would work somehow; the Apple Silentype does, 
with sufficient care in configuring the format, although it isn't given as an 
option. 

These various shortcomings aren't unique to Andent or author Dick 
Stein. They're far too common in the mushrooming software industry; 
users are still too often left wishing that more attention would be given to 
the creation of "friendly" software — understandable, useful, and free of 
boobytraps. 

This program is not a panacea for philatelists. It might be a reason- 
able acquisition for the DBM user with more than minimal skill or pa- 
tience. RW 
The Stamp Collector, by Dick Stein, Andent (1000 North Avenue, Waukegan, IL 
60085; 312-223-5077). $49.

for the microcomputer. 

The original BAM still graces the Fastalk column — as a classic. In 
speed, graphic resolution, and sophistication, it was outdated long ago. 
Yet its appeal remained and owners of the old program continued to pull 
it out and give it a play every now and then. 

Don Worth and his since-5^M affiliation, Quality Software, got the 
picture. And, as soon as he had the time (a rare quantity for a college 
professor and businessman), he rewrote BAM in hi-res with Applesoft 
compatibility (the old and new both use machine language, but the old 
drivers were Integer), sped it up, and added all the bells and whistles — 
like a save game function — that today's game players like. 

He also added a few treasures and fancied up the ending. And there, 
in his wisdom, he stopped. The old game, with all its super features, re- 
mains exactly the same. 

Beneath A pple Manor is, in this time of gaming complexity, an exer- 
cise in simplicity. Explore the dungeons, fight the monsters, build your 
character, go deeper, and do it all over again. 

But simplicity can be another way of saying elegance. Consider that 
every dungeon level is generated randomly, every one is one you've never 
seen before. And you won't see it at all until you explore it, bit by bit. 
Then, of course, unless you take the memory wipe-out potion, all that 
you've explored stays on the screen so that you can see the whole thing 
eventually. Exploring and discovering each maze is a lot of the intrigue of 
BAM; what will the next dungeon look like? 

There are tradeoffs. In hi-res, you're limited to five rooms per dun- 
geon; if you choose more (up to ten are allowed), you play in text-res. 
And one of the new treasures is a potion that reveals the whole level 
you're on. That's undoubtedly supposed to be a boon, but this reviewer 
won't chance taking that one again. 

The strategy remains, and there's plenty of it. Few BAM players 
haven't a clear-cut strategy they'll recommend above all others. Experi- 
ence points are tradable for character points in any of a relatively stan-

dard four areas — strength, intelligence, dexterity, and body (constitu- 
tion). Because new levels are populated on the basis of your average and 
because monsters vary in how they affect you and in what affects them 
and in which levels they tend to cluster, where you put your points at 
various times during the game is very strategic. 

Its eternal newness renders Beneath Apple Manor addictive. Even af- 
ter you once reach the bottom of the dungeon and walk away with the 
prized golden apple, the challenge of doing it again at a higher level of 
difficulty — there are ten — remains. Some fans of the early BAM have 
changed the rules to keep playing; they never take the golden apple when 
it's offered. Their goal is to see how much of a superhero they can build. 
Since the dungeons keep getting harder to match your strength, the chal- 
lenge continues. 

BAM doesn't have the complexity of a Wizardry or a Temple of Ap- 
shai. But it remains a light, interesting, thoroughly enjoyable game with a 
wide enough range of play levels to be fun for very small children and to 
challenge veteran adult players.* n(T

Madame Shepp's Tarot. By Madame Shepp. Madame Shepp has done 
an excellent job of adapting traditional tarot readings to the microcom- 
puter. Her readings are based on the Rider-Waite tarot deck and every 
attempt is made to individualize each reading. 

As the seeker after cosmic truth, you can choose between two styles 
of divination: the traditional Celtic Cross reading or a simple yes or no 
answer. Ask your question and choose which significator card best repre- 
sents your aura. Then the deck is shuffled. Cut the cards while Madame 
Shepp's Psychic Computer absorbs your energy into the deck. 

When a simple yes or no answer is requested, seven cards are laid 
out. Three cards describing the past, one the present, and three the fu- 
ture are shown, with detailed information given about each card. Then 
the cards are weighed together to arrive at a final determination. 

If an in-depth reading is desired, then the ancient Celtic Cross meth- 
od is used. Ten cards are dealt, each card symbolizing a very specialized 
area. The meaning of each of these areas is revealed, based on the nature 
of the card, whether it is upright or reversed, and whether it belongs to 
the Major or Minor Arcana. An entire screen full of analysis is shown, 
summarizing the forces involved, and then an overall prediction is given. 
If more analysis is desired, the last card of the reading can be used as the 
foundation for a whole new reading. This is equivalent to switching to 
lOx power on a pair of binoculars. Vague shapes can suddenly jump into 
crystal clear focus. 

At the end of either style of divination, the seeker may make a hard 
copy printout of the reading for further reflection and reference. 

Unfortunately, all the cards in the readings are shown only in lo-res. 
While it certainly enhances the reading to see the cards in their proper 
positions on the table, adding hi-res pictures, especially of the Major 
Arcana, would do much to heighten the experience. 

This program is not designed as a game, but as a serious attempt to 
provide computerized tarot readings. However, Madame Shepp's Tarot is 
refreshingly delightful and intriguing, even for nonbelievers. The com- 
puter will never replace the tarot reader completely, because a machine 
lacks the ability to empathize fully with the seeker. If voice synthesis were 
added to this program, the effect would certainly be eerie. Imagine Or- 
son Welles or Christopher Lee intoning your reading. You'd be on the 
edge of your seat the entire time. 

As a test of the program's ability, the question was asked: "What is 
the future of this program in the market?" The resulting Celtic Cross 
reading was a fascinating analysis of the trials and tribulations of getting 
a computer program written and published. The program confidently 



*One question remains. When a classic is redressed to give it more modern ad- 
vantages yet retains all the attributes that made it eligible to be a classic in the first 
place, which should appear in Fastalk as the classic? The potential customer 
would do best to buy the later version; the collector should seek the early one. 
Prisoner and Prisoner 2 present the same problem as BAM. What do you think?

TRACK 
THE SPACE SHUTTLE 
ON AN APPLE? 

YES. WITH MICROSPEED! 



At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, NASA 
scientists have discovered the power of MicroSPEED. 
Using this remarkable hardware/software system with 
an Apple II, they produced a continuous graphic 
display of the Columbia's position relative to the earth 
during the second Shuttle mission. This enabled the 
JPL team to accurately follow the spacecraft in real 
time, and to precisely control its powerful sensors at 
critical points along the flight path. 
Surprised that such a demanding project is possible 
on the Apple? So were JPL's engineers, and many 
others who have discovered . . . 

THE MICROSPEED DIFFERENCE This extraordinary 
Language System exploits the real potential of the 
microcomputer for the first time. The difference 
between MicroSPEED and other programming 
languages is that with MicroSPEED, there is virtually 
no limit to what you can achieve. It may well be the 
ultimate language for the Apple II and III (and soon 
the IBM Personal Computer). MicroSPEED literally 
combines the performance of a minicomputer with an 



exhaustive set of user-friendly capabilities: hardware 
math processing, fast hi-res graphics and text, turtle 
graphics, print formating, two text editors, unlimited 
data types, and incredible FORTH extensibility — all 
at speeds up to 100 times faster than Basic. 

USER-FRIENDLY, EASY-TO-LEARN Starting with 
simple commands that are comfortable even for non- 
programmers, MicroSPEED extends and builds, 
allowing you to create your own tailored application 
languages. The capability of your computer will grow 
exponentially, as you work in an active partnership 
with the machine, exploring and developing new 
problem-solving facilities — creating, correcting, 
refining your increasingly powerful system. 

DEMANDING JOBS AT LOW COST MicroSPEED 
has been put to the test in fields as diverse as medicine, 
the stock market, oceanography, and the arts. In even 
the most challenging applications, MicroSPEED 
users have been unanimous in their praise of the 
System and manual. Typical comments are: 




". . . we are more than pleased with MicroSPEED . . . I 
can't imagine using BASIC on any future applications. " 

Roger Guevremont, National Research Council of Canada. 

"I continue to marvel at its versatility and power. " 
Car l R. Schramm, USCG Base, Kodiak, Alaska. 

"An excellent package . . . No other language than 
MicroSPEED . . . could perform this well." 

David Whittington, Boeing Computer Services. 

"If you plan to use a personal computer for any 
demanding task, then we built MicroSPEED for you . " 

Sam Cottrell, President of Applied Analytics. 



MicroSPEED requires the Apple Computer with single disk. Micro- 
SPEED II includes 2 MHz math processor. MicroSPEED II + includes 
4 MHz math processor.

Ice Demons. By Matthew Jew. High in the frozen wastes of the mytho- 
logical Norse polar regions, an eternal battle is being waged. Ice demons 
are rampaging against humanity, and only you can hope to stop these 
hideously deformed creatures. 

Hidden in great caverns beneath the frozen ice packs they iurk, 
waiting to burrow up and emerge to surround and destroy you. 

Each creature has been endowed with magical powers by the evil 
High Master himself. Slime fires devastating paralysis arrows that re- 
lentlessly follow anywhere you run. Plebe can magically transport him- 
self anywhere on the screen instantly. The deadly Willowwisp, whose 
breath blows icy death, is nearly impossible to vanquish; and Widow- 
maker moves with lightning speed. All the demons have an icy touch 
that means instant death. 

Into this frozen hell you must travel, deeper and deeper, clearing level 
after level, in search of the mighty High Master, deadly leader of the ice 
demons. Only with his destruction may the world become a safe 
place again. 

Armed only with bow and arrow, your task is supported by two 
magical aids sent periodically by the Great Wizard: a giant magic arrow 
that helps you to fire faster and a transporter that advances you a level — 
if you can survive to reach it. Further assistance comes with the magic 
dollar; grab one and gain bonus points, fire at one and it breaks apart 
into dozens of arrows deadly to the ice demons. 

Ice Demons is an arcade game that's definitely different. At boot-up, 
the cast of characters is introduced to the accompaniment of Bach's 
Toccata and Fugue in D Minor. Then the demons begin emerging from 
icy covered holes that appear randomly on each level. Well defined and 
distinctive, the demons immediately move toward the hero. 

Ice Demons features a unique two-player mode; you can choose either of 
two configurations — one for people who want to compete and an- 
other for those who'd rather gang up on the demons. In both, the play- 
ers play at the same time (as opposed to taking turns). In team mode, 
players' arrows cannot hurt the other player and both players may use 
the transporter. In competition mode, players score for hitting each 
other, and only one player may use the transporter on a level. 

Although marred by poor animation, rather boring sound effects, 
and occasional image flicker, the inventive quality of the concept plus its 
totally unique modes of play make Ice Demons a significant game and 
Morningstar a company to watch. WkS

The Planetary Guide. By Kevin Bagley and David Kampschafer. About 
two-thirds of the way out from the hub of a galaxy known as the Milky 
Way exists a solar system containing Earth and eight other planets, all re- 
volving happily around the Sun. A bestseller for some time in Androm- 
eda, The Planetary Guide is now available to intelligent occupants of 
these nine planets. 

The program provides graphic images of each of the planets, show- 
ing their general appearance, tables of statistics about each, and descrip- 
tive information about them. Looking at the planets as a system, The 
Planetary Guide extracts relative size, comparative orbits, phases of the 
moon, and movement of comets around the sun. It even gives a hi-res il- 
lustration of the motion of the planets around the sun on any given date 
from 1 A.D. to far into the future. 

After using this program you can expect to be able to locate and 
identify the planets in the night sky. All planets are visible to the naked 
eye except Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. 

Documentation includes a glossary and additional information de- 
scribing the ecliptic, phases of the moon, and retrograde motion. 

The Planetary Guide is a well put together program that presents the 
interrelationships of the bodies in our solar system in a clear and easily 
accessible manner. DAD 
The Planetary Guide, by Kevin Bagley and David Kampschafer, Synergistic Soft- 
ware (830 North Riverside Drive, Renton, WA 98055; 206-226-3216). $30. 

The Desecration. By Greg and Gil. Somehow this program suggests the 
Reese's Peanut Butter Cup advertisement: "You got adventure in my ar- 



cade!" "You got arcade in my adventure!" The Desecration is the begin- 
ning of a new breed of game, the Adventurecade. The game is basically a 
hi-res adventure, but at three different points in the game the player must 
demonstrate sufficient prowess at arcade skills to proceed. 

This game is the first in a series of science-fiction Adventurecades fea- 
turing the player as an intergalactic assassin. It is a good introduction; 
the puzzles are generally not difficult and the arcade action is not too de- 
manding. 

The plot of The Desecration revolves around your assignment to 
penetrate the tight defenses of the mining community Pyrkon 9, and to 
assassinate its tyrant chairman, Dunmark Pykro. Keemar, Guildmaster 
of Assassins, gives you the assignment personally. He informs you that 
this is a contract paid for by a joint venture of other rulers, who fear Pyk- 
ro's expansion plans. They are willing to pay your standard fee of ten 
thousand galactic sovereigns. You may also keep anything you find, sub- 
ject to guild approval, of course. Keemar then gives you a special pass- 
word needed to make contact on Pyrkon and wishes you luck. 

Along the way to the planet, you must steal a spaceship, break out of 
prison, and deal with weird aliens and spies. Once on the planet, the ad- 
venture gets tougher. The game is rarely boring and maintains a good 
level of excitement and suspense. The parser is somewhat awkward; at 
times, strange phrasing is needed to proceed, although the puzzles are all 
very logical and sometimes even too straightforward. 

The arcade segments offer nothing new in arcade games, but they 
present the average adventurer with quite a problem. Not only must you 
master the pace of each game, but you must survive two levels to each 
part of each game. You must therefore become good at the arcade 
games, not just passable. Arcade fans will flash through these segments, 
but bog down in the traditional adventure segments. This could be a 
good game for two-player teamwork. rra

207, Beverly Hills, CA 90212; 213-277-8044). $49.95.

SOCTAI K 



FEBRUARY 1983 




from page 127 

word processing set and MagiCalc for the number crunchers. Magic 
Window He, in its original form the first word processor to offer eighty 
columns without a hardware enhancement, has considerably speeded up 
display by using the Apple board. 

MagiCalc, as with VisiCalc, Multiplan, and Incredible Jack, will use 
all 128K of a full machine. It'll even grab up to 512K if you provide the 
RAM boards and sufficient data. 

Software Publishing Corporation, with its PFS series, illustrates 
another facet of the marketplace. Because they write code in Pascal, they 
find it easier to bring their programs to a new marketplace. PFS: File re- 
mains the bestselling filing program on the Apple II Plus and the Apple 
III. Its immediate availability on the He is another competitive point in 
the machine's favor. 

Sirius Software's products all worked on the He without modifica- 
tion with two exceptions. Sirius modified Wayout to provide gameplay- 
ers with a better keyboard layout. 

Sirius also immediately modified their highly successful Type Attack 
program to teach placement of the keys on the lie keyboard. Ernie 
Brock, a product manager at Sirius as well as coauthor of Type Attack, 
feels the new version will be handy for veteran Apple users trying to 
make the changeover. 

But even as the preceding companies joined Apple at the unveiling 
announcement, other companies were moving as rapidly. Lightning Soft- 
ware gave proof of their name by having a lie version of MasterType. 
The version includes the additional keys and uses the extra memory to 
speed up the pauses between lessons. 

Continental Software proved especially opportunistic. Of course, 
they announced a He version of their bestselling Home Accountant. The 
surprise was the announcement that The Tax Advantage, a program not 
then in general release for the II Plus, was also ready for the He. 

That's an impressive list of solid software companies. With the com- 
mitment of Sirius, Sierra On-Line, and Broderbund to make their prod- 
uct compatible with the He, it means almost all the bestselling entertain- 
ment software will be available to new owners. In addition, the first and 



second ranked business programs, the first ranked educational program, 
the first ranked home program, and the first ranked word processor were 
already available before the machine was ever put in the market. 

That's an impressive feat, quite unparalleled in the short history of 
microcomputing; and that litany ignores the two contributions from Ap- 
ple itself, which has not exactly been idle. Apple Writer is generally the 
second or third ranked word processor. In its He incarnation, it takes ad- 
vantage of every new feature. Powerful simplicity is the theme of this 
program. Thoughtful use of the open-apple and closed-apple keys, four- 
way arrows, and delete key along with typewriter standard use of such 
keys as tab and caps lock are great improvements. 

Apple's other exclusive He offering is Quick File II, retrofitted from 
the Apple III program. Quick File is today's File Cabinet; for its time and 
for its intended use, File Cabinet was a superior program. So is Quick 
File. A supersimple-to-use database, it has all the utilities and features 
you need for personal use at home or in the office. 

Now That We're Here, Where Are We? From what is now known 
about Apple's new products as well as what is believed to be forthcom- 
ing, certain natural avenues of speculation open up. 

Apple's action in downloading Quick File leads to speculation that 
other Apple III software might be suitable for downloading. The He now 
has as standard memory the minimum amount available in an Apple HI. 
Is a subset of the powerful SOS operating system a possibility? If so, will 
such II dynamos as Word Juggler impinge on already white hot compe- 
tition in the II market? 

The company has generally conceded that they intend to market a 
product that's now code-named Mcintosh. The Mac is apparently a 
small Lisa in every way. But if Lisa is a one megabyte standard machine, 
that implies probably a low end 256K for Mac. Coincidentally, 256K is 
the largest memory now available for the III. Will Apple build a bridge 
"from its 68000-based systems to its 6502-based systems? If so, they would 
present prospective personal computer owners with unparalleled vertical 
mobility. 

Regardless of Apple's future plans or future actions, generations yet 
unborn will owe a debt of gratitude to Wozniak and Jobs for having the 
genius to provide tools for their intellects. It was Apple, more than any 
other system, that proved the concept of the personal computer. 

Lisa and the He are just two more in a string of wonderful gifts.

LISA'S 
DEBUT 

Apple's announcement of Lisa, a souped-up third-generation micro- 
computer, poses the question of whether the Two Guys from Cupertino 
show can play in Fortune 1000 theaters. 

Of course, it's likely that neither Steve had anything to do with the 
conundrum Apple now finds itself in. Steve the Wozniak was in school 
last year and apparently was not active in the Lisa project. Steve the Jobs 
is rumored to be backing Lisa's little brother, Mcintosh, as Apple's next 
big hit. 

If Lisa got off the starting blocks without the active assistance of 
either of the founding teenagers of Apple, more's the pity. The company 
certainly didn't choose an easy market to aim toward. So they can use all 
the genius at their disposal. 

Lisa is still in beta testing, so no firsthand knowledge of the quality 
and reliability of the system is available. But conceptually Lisa is either a 
stroke of genius or a good example of high tech engineering gone amuck. 
It all depends on whether it sells. 

There's no question but that Lisa is a first-class piece of work. The 
driving microprocessor is powerful, the inclusion of two inboard, high- 
density, double-sided drives is far-seeing, provision of sufficient applica- 
tions software to do the jobs an executive would want to do at his desk is 
a reflection of an Apple III lesson well learned, and the bundling of the 
ProFile hard disk probably reflects the not unrealistic expectation that 
anyone who buys a machine this potent will probably need plenty of 
storage. 

The problem is that Lisa sells at $9,995. For those of you slow on the 
pickup, we're discussing five figure dollars here unless you live in a state 
with a sales tax of less than one-tenth of a mill per dollar. This is not an 
item expected to be high on impulse buyers' lists. After all, it can't play 
Pac-Man. 

The question is why does Apple fearlessly go where others fear to 
tread? Xerox pioneered the kind of user interface featured on Lisa at 
$18,000 per machine, give or take a two-martini lunch. Buyers queued up 
in numbers estimated to be at least double the population of working 
lumberjacks in the Gobi Desert. 

IBM, one of those other techie companies, saw what Xerox had done 
and waxed wise. Not desiring to be in the business of selling chain saws 
to those selfsame Gobi lumberjacks, they entered the market at what ap- 
pears to be the high end of the low end market. Translated into real Eng- 
lish, that means IBM will sell you a real usable machine for about $4,000. 

Apple seems to have almost split the difference: They're twice as high 
as IBM and half the price of Xerox. It's easy to believe that Xerox is too 
high. Neither Xerox nor IBM has ever shown any indication to run after- 
Christmas white sales or Valentine's Day two-for-one sales. Margin is 
the founding principle in both conglomerates. So, if there's a marketing 
window at ten grand, why aren't these guys there? 

It's patently obvious that Fortune 1000 executive and upper level 
management personnel are the targets here. There are not many Win- 
chell's Donut franchisees in the market for ten gees of computing 
power. You can almost visualize the advertising campaign: How much is 
the efficiency of your top executives worth to you? Underneath the head- 
line will be cuts of Lisa and PC with $9,995 under Lisa and $4,000 under 
PC. Lisa will become the perk of the elite class. That's all of a two-thou- 
sand-unit marketplace. 

One of the problems in assessing Lisa's future lies in definitions. 
Everyone knows Apple makes personal computers, so the press kits all 



TTTT 




announce Apple's wonderful new personal computer. It's understood 
that the more you pay a massage parlor, the more personal they get. It's 
not clear that the same law holds for small computers. 

Pundits are fragmenting the market into what they hope are func- 
tional definitions if they're to maintain their punditry to the end of the 
decade. Generally, they all agree that we've either got a home computer, 
a personal computer, a desktop computer, or a work station. What they 
don't agree on is which computers go into which categories. 

Stopping far short of any consensus is the feeling that home com- 
puters cost less than $500 and have less than 48K of memory. Personal 
computers cost less than $2,000 and have 48K or 64K standard. Desk- 
top computers go for 64K to 256K and cost $2,000 to $4,000. Nobody 
knows what a work station is because we aren't there yet. 

These definitions, albeit probably all wet, certainly clear the air. Vic- 
20 and Atari 400 are home computers. Apple II and Atari 800 are per- 
sonal computers. IBM pc and Apple III are desktop computers. Does 
this mean Lisa's a work station? 

If it does, the experts think Lisa's too early. They say there'll be nine 
million desktop computers before any significant phasing into work sta- 
tions commences. That's four or five years away, even if IBM starts sell- 
ing a million units a year, which is what they're shooting for. 

Apple is a company worth worrying about. The number of busi- 
nesses that have sprung up in support of the Apple II makes Apple the 
biggest nouveau employer in America. They've been good for a lot of 
people who have never crossed the city limits of Cupertino. 

Apple seems to be riding a fantastic streak of good fortune, and Lisa 
is at least starting out that way. After using Lisa as a code name for 
years, the company got attached to it. But the name was owned jointly 
by Randy Hyde, author, and Sierra On-Line, publisher, of Lisa 2.5, an 
assembler of some renown. 

Apple's a big, rich company now. Hyde or Sierra could have perpe- 
trated highway robbery under the ruse of sincere negotiations. Instead, 
they negotiated a price representing their fair interest in the name. That's 
Apple's fairy godmother at work again. 

But it's okay. 

They deserve success. HI

Fruitful Connections* 



There are more people in more 
places making more accessories 
and peripherals for Apples than 
for any other personal computer 
in the world. 

Thanks to those people — 
in hundreds of independent 
companies— you can make the 
humblest 1978 Apple II turn tricks 
that are still on IBM's Wish List 
for 1984. 

But now we're coming out with 
our very own line of peripherals 
and accessories for Apple® Personal 
Computers. 

For two very good reasons. 

First, compatibility. We've 
created a totally kluge-free family 
of products designed to take full 
advantage of all the advantages 
built into every Apple. 

Second, service and support. 




Now the same kindly dealer who 
keeps your Apple PC in the pink 
can do the same competent job 
for your Apple hard-disk and your 
Apple daisywheel printer. 

So if you're looking to expand 
the capabilities of your Apple II 
or III, remember: 

Now you can add Apples to 
Apples. 



Gutenberg would be proud 

Old Faithful Silentype® has now been joined by New Faithfuls, the 
Apple Dot Matrix Printer and the Apple Letter Quality Printer. 

So now, whatever your budget and your 
needs, you can hook your Apple to a printer 
that's specifically designed to take advan- 
tage of all the features built into your 
Apple. With no compromises. 

The 7x9 Apple Dot Matrix 
Printer is redefining "correspondence 
quality" with exceptional legibility. 
With 144x160 dots per square inch, it can 
also create high resolution graphics. 

The Apple Letter Quality Printer, 
which gets the words out about 33% 
faster than other daisywheel printers 
in its price range, also offers graphics 
capabilities. See your authorized 
Apple dealer for more information and 
demonstrations. Because, unfortunately, all 
the news fit to print simply doesn't fit. 




A joy to behold 

The new Apple Joystick II is 
the ultimate hand control device 
for the Apple II. 

Why is it such a joy to use? 

With two firing buttons, it's 
the first ambidextrous joystick — 
just as comfortable for lefties 
as righties. 

Of course, it gives you 360° 
cursor control (not just 8-way like 
some game-oriented devices) and 
full X/Y coordinate control. 

And the Joystick II contains 
high-quality components and 
switches tested to over 1,000,000 
life cycles. 

Which makes it a thing of 
beauty. And a joystick forever

important for some, it 
can access that data 
about 10-times faster 
than a standard floppy 
drive. 

So now your Apple j 
III can handle jobs once 
reserved for computers 
costing thousands 
more. 

As for quality 



and reliability, you need only store 
one word of wisdom: 



Apple. 





Launching pad for numeric data. 



Good tidings for crunchers of 
numerous numbers: 

Apple now offers a numeric 
keypad that's electronically and 
aesthetically compatible 
with the Apple II 
Personal Computer. [ 
So you can enter 
numeric data 
faster than 
ever before. 

The Apple 
Numeric Key- 
pad II has 
a standard 
calculator- 
style layout. 
Appropriate 




because unlike some other key- 
pads, it can actually function as a 
calculator. 

The four function keys to the 
left of the numeric pad should be 
of special interest 
to people who use

This month's Graphically Speaking is by guest columnist Eagle Berns. 

Filling in areas with color is a very advanced graphic technique. Last 
month's Graphically Speaking looked at how bit patterns combine to 
create various colors. Now we'll put theory into practice with a machine 
language color fill routine. 

The routine can fill in any enclosed area, not just squares and rectan- 
gles. It allows the use of a wide variety of colors for the fill. These may 
either be the twenty or so colors included in this program or any color 
scheme that the user designs through experimentation. The user may 
even create rainbow effects and random patterns. 

The program can be loaded along with any Basic program and called 
when needed. It can fill areas on either hi-res page, and the area it fills 
can be either black or white. 

This program, working in tandem with any picture packing pro- 
gram, can conserve considerable disk storage space by packing black and 
white pictures on a disk and then filling in the colors after the unpacking. 

The Algorithm. Before the routine can color in anything, you have to 
tell it what you want done and where. The user supplies information to 
the routine in locations 0 through 4 of memory. The X coordinate at 
which filling is to begin goes in locations 0 and 1 and the Y coordinate 
goes in 2. The color value is poked into location 3, and the choice of hi- 
res page 1 or 2 is indicated by entering $20 or $40 respectively in lo- 
cation 4. 

The program begins by computing the internal memory location cor- 
responding to the X,Y pair given (a nontrivial exercise, as those who are 
familiar with the hi-res memory layout can attest to). We've used look-up 
tables to accomplish this in previous articles. Computing the address in 
machine language takes much less memory, but it's also a little slower. 

The routine then fills in each byte to the left of the X,Y pair with the 
appropriate color until a nonblack or nonwhite byte is found. The same 
technique is then applied on the right. The point immediately above the 
given point is then selected and, if the background isn't different for this 
point, the process is repeated. When the upward motion is stopped, the 
entire process is repeated, moving down from the original point. 

The second most difficult part of the task is handling the end condi- 
tions when a byte must be partially changed. Here, considerations of 
even or odd bytes and color anomalies have to be dealt with. These prob- 
lems require the use of various masking techniques and won't be dis- 
cussed in detail here. 

Keep in mind that with this filling method an enclosed irregular 
shape may require more than one color fill to be colored in completely. 
An example of this is shown in a sample program described later. Also, 
for the examples given, the objects to be filled were generated by hplot- 
ting line segments. There is no requirement, however, on how the hi-res 
screen is created. To save disk space, you could just save coordinates of 
the endpoints of lines and color fill points and then generate the entire 





picture from this information. 

A Description of the Program. What follows is a block-by-block de- 
scription of the essential parts of the code. The areas that the user may 
wish to modify to fit specific needs are also indicated. Note, for example, 
the section on color patterns used in the program. 

Lines 1 through 35 do some initial housekeeping and parameter sav- 
ing. The section in lines 36 through 48 finds the bit and byte pointed to 
by the coordinates and checks to see if the byte is either of the two blacks 
(00000000 or 10000000) or two whites (11111111 or 01111111). 

Lines 49 through 59 set up appropriate masks for data checking on 
the data bytes based on whether the background is black or white. This 
calls SETUPB or SETUPW to modify some instructions in the code to 
use the masks properly. 

Lines 60 through 62 pull out the appropriate color pattern requested 
by the user and store it for later. 

The main loop for filling in the line on the left and right (via a call to 
FILNE) is in lines 63 through 73. It moves up a line at a time (VERT 
routine computes the address) and checks to see if the bit found is a con- 
tinuation of the background color to be filled. Lines 74 through 95 es- 
sentially repeat the procedure, but they start at the original point and 
move down a line at a time. 

The routine from 96 to 149 computes the horizontal address corre- 
sponding to the X coordinate passed by the user. It also finds the par- 
ticular bit within the byte where the fill will start. 

The FILNE routine (lines 150 through 172) just controls the calling 
of the fill-in-on-right (JSR RGT) and the fill-in-on-left (JSR INS4) rou- 
tines for a particular line. 

The two routines SETUPB and SETUPW, starting at 173 and 193, 
respectively, modify certain instructions that deal with masking the data 
byte. They change EORs, ANDs, and ORAs to the instruction appro- 
priate for the masking operation on black versus white. 

Lines 220 through 251 contain the code that puts together the byte in 
hi-res memory with the pattern to be filled. The routine will modify only 
the part of a byte that is to be filled — that is, a left portion of the byte, a 
right portion of it, or the entire byte. It then stores the finished byte back 
in memory. 

Lines 252 through 281 handle the movement from the original point 
to the left, looking for (and stopping at) a byte that doesn't contain a full 
byte of background. It calls the STORCOLOR routine given earlier for 
each byte to be modified. Lines 282 through 3 15 do the same thing to the 
right of the origin. 

The routine in lines 316 through 362 converts a Y coordinate value to 
the memory address corresponding to the beginning of the row of that Y 
coordinate. Rather than using a lengthy table to find the location, this 
routine rearranges the bits of the Y value to form the appropriate 
address. 

Lines 363 through 401 define the local constants and variables

needed for the processing of the code. 

Lines 402 to 423 create a table called COLORTAB. The entries in 
this table are the bit patterns required to form a particular color on the 
hi-res screen. The first four represent the two blacks and two whites. The 
next four are the standard hi-res colors supported on the Apple. The re- 
mainder (except the last) were found by detective work. The bit config- 
urations were taken from pictures found in other programs. You can 
give these colors whatever names you like. 

There are eight bytes to each entry. Which of them is appropriate de- 
pends on whether an even or odd row or column byte is being manipu- 
lated. The last entry, SPCL, was provided as a special user entry. By 
knowing this address (from assembling the program) a user can store any 
configuration of bytes. Storing random byte values here can create some 
unusual effects. 

The First Sample Program. This small program demonstrates use of 
the color fill-in routine for generating Venn diagrams (or partially filled- 
in circles).

T.M. 

by Bob Nacon 



The success of the original Amper-Mag i c™ program package and the 
Introduction of its technique for attaching new commands to Applesoft 
programs has stimulated the production of Command Library"' packages 
designed around a 'theme' such as information display or output, input, 
memory management, etc., which will enhance your Applesoft programs. They 
will give your program a professional operation and appearance by 
increasing speed, reducing size, and giving you features you never could 
have before, while still allowing you to program with the ease of BASIC. 

Ampei — Magic Command Library No. 2 is dedicated to information display 
and output capabilities. Read on and enjoy the new programming power 
Ampei — Magic Command Library No. 2 will give you. 

This disk contains 27 machine language routines ready to be inserted 
quickly and painlessly into your own Applesoft programs. Included among 
them Is the most powerful PRINT USING routine yet created for Applesoft, 
as well as some small but very handy routines for controlling the appear- 
ance and activity on the display screen. 

In order to use these commands, you will need the Ampei — Magic program 
itself which is contained on Volume One. SOME commands on this disk are: 

** Access the most powerful PRINT USING command EVER for the Apple. 
It sure does more than just line up decimal points! It works with 
strings of characters as wel I as numbers, and lets the program de- 
cide whether to make them Flash or Inverse or Normal depending on 
conditions you specify. With numbers, you can have fixed or 
floating dollar sign and/or optional commas and a variety of fill 
characters. You can embed standard phrases within your format de- 
sign. You can even print to the screen WHILE outputtinq to the 
printer! And generate NO GARBAGE to collect! All in all, the 
most powerful PRINT USING yet! 

** Print to the screen while a peripheral is active 

** Save and restore instantly any text screen, no matter how complex 
with flashing, Inverse, and any window settings...

New File Transfer Language 




^PROGRAM DISKETTF 

SOFTEPju 



Your host compu 
won't know the difference! 

Softerm provides an exacf terminal emulation 
for a wide range of CRT terminals which interface 
to a variety of host computer systems. Special 
function keys, sophisticated editing features, 
even local printer capabilities of the terminals 
emulated by Softerm are fully supported. Softerm 
operates with even the most discriminating host 
computer applications including video editors. 
And at speeds up to 9600 baud using either a 
direct connection or any standard modem. 

Unmatched file transfer capability 

Softerm offers file transfer methods flexible 
enough to match any host computer requirement. 
These include character protocol with user- 
definable terminator and acknowledge strings, 
block size, and character echo wait, and the 
intelligent Softrans 1 " protocol which provides 
reliable error-free transmission and reception of 
data. The character protocol provides maximum 
flexibility for text file transfers. Any type file 
may be transferred using the Softrans protocol 
which provides automatic binary encoding and 
decoding, block checking with error recovery, and 
data compression to enhance line utilization. 
A FORTRAN 77 source program is supplied with 
Softerm which is easily adaptable to any host 
computer to allow communications with Softerm 



using the Softrans protocol. 

Softerm file transfer utilizes an easy to use 
command language which allows simple defini- 
tion of even complex multiple-file transfers with 
handshaking. Twenty-three high-level commands 
include DIAL, CATALOG, SEND, RECEIVE, 
ONERR, HANGUP, MONITOR and others which 
may be executed in immediate command mode 
interactively or from a file transfer macro com- 
mand file which has been previously entered 
and saved on disk. 

Built-in utilities 

Softerm disk utilities allow DOS commands such 
as CATALOG, INIT, RENAME, and DELETE to be 
executed allowing convenient file maintenance. 
Local file transfers allow files to be displayed, 
printed, or even copied to another file without 
exiting the Softerm program. Numerous editing 
options such as tab expansion and space com- 
pression are provided to allow easy reformatting 
of data to accommodate the variations in data 
formats used by host computers. Softerm sup- 
ports automatic dialing in both terminal and file 
transfer modes. Dial utilities allow a phone book of 
frequently used numbers to be defined which are 
accessed by a user-assigned name and specify

Online Update Service 

The Softronics Online Update Service is pro- 
vided as an additional support service at no 
additional cost to Softerm users. Its purpose 
is to allow fast turnaround of Softerm program 
fixes for user-reported problems using the 
automatic patch facility included in Softerm 
as well as a convenient distribution method for 
additional terminal emulations and I/O drivers 
which become available. User correspondence 
can be electronically mailed to Softronics, and 
user-contributed keyboard macros, file transfer 
macros, and host adaptations of the Softrans 
FORTRAN 77 program are available on-line.

Beginners' 
Corn 



Last month we entered the Monitor, wrote a very short machine lan- 
guage program, and examined memory directly. Our purpose was to see 
what happens when strings entered from the keyboard accumulate and 
threaten to take over the space of running programs. In the process we 
learned something about machine language. Even for a beginner, a bit of 
knowledge about machine language, including the ability to load, save, 
and move binary files, is good to have. 

Understanding your Apple's memory map and how to manipulate 
binary files can help you get the most out of certain commercial pack- 
ages. Take for example The Graphics Magician by Chris Jochumson, Da- 
vid Lubar, and Mark Pelczarski and Electric Duet by Paul Lutus. 

Each package provides in its documentation a short Basic program 
for playing or displaying your work, but these programs are there most- 
ly as examples. To do anything more complicated than demonstrate one 
song or picture at a time, you'll have to build on these programs, and 
that is where your grasp of memory maps, binary files, and hexadecimal 
numbering will come in handy. 

Let's consider hexadecimal first. An understanding of this number 
system is important because it is the only number system that the Moni- 
tor understands. In addition, hexadecimal numbers sometimes appear in 
DOS commands. 

The hexadecimal number system isn't as difficult to learn as it looks. 
Hexadecimal means base sixteen, and base sixteen works the same way 
as base ten except that there are sixteen digits in the basic set instead of 
ten. In base ten, the numerals zero through nine comprise the entire set of 




digits; after that, we begin counting sets. Twelve means one whole set 
plus two of a second set. In base sixteen, there are sixteen numerals in a 
set: zero through nine and A through F. If you had F golf balls, and you 
were to count them using base ten, you'd count fifteen of them. The 
number after F in hexadecimal is written 10. Yup, ten still represents one 
full set and the zeroth item of a second set. 

To make it clear what number system we are using, we usually prefix 
a hexadecimal number with a dollar sign; 10 means ten in decimal, while 
$10 — for hex ten — means sixteen in decimal. 

The numeral 100 stands for one full set of sets, or one full set squared. 
In decimal, it's the number of yards on a football field. In hex, $100 is still 
one full set of sets; but translating to decimal, that means 256 or sixteen 
(one full set) times sixteen. Each place is worth sixteen decimal times the 
place to its right. (If you counted the yards in a football field in hex, 
there'd be $64 — count 'em!) 

Once you grasp the concept of bases other than ten, understanding 
hexadecimal isn't too difficult, but converting between the two systems in 
your head is still tedious and can lead to errors. Table 1 shows the con- 
version values for the decimal numbers 0 to 256. 

Place an initialized disk in your boot drive and turn on your Apple. 
It's a good idea to get into the habit of always booting your system with a 
disk in drive 1 . The Apple's disk operating system (DOS), unfortunate- 
ly, is not permanently in hardware as is Basic. You must load it from a 
disk every time you turn on the power. If you don't do that, you can't 
save any program you write (except on cassette, if you have a

A PRACTICAL 
6 EASY METHOD 
FOR LEARNING 
(OR DRUSHING-UP ON) 
SPANISH USED DY TRAVELERS. 

ADVENTURE, FUN, EDUCATION, and history ore oil 
reasons people novel to other countries. The problem 
is, when traveling to countries where little or no English 
is spoken, how to communicate. By spending a few 
hours with Spanish for the Traveler, you can gain a 
basic understanding of Spanish and at the same time 
provide yourself with a MAGIC KEY which will open 
doors to the local culture not normally available to the 
average traveler In a Latin counrry,anyone who tries 
to speak the Language is almost always treated with 
o smile and warmth by the people of that country. The 
way to goin this edge is to practice Spanish with 
Spanish for the Traveler before your trip. . . 

Because: 

• It's o quick and easy way to learn Spanish useful 
in traveling. 

• It's an opportunity to leorn some of the basics of 
Spanish without the necessity of attending dosses, 
lectures ot listening to endless records. 

• It's presented in a manner which catches your 
interest immediately and encourages you to 
continue building your Spanish vocabulary. 

• It provides you with the essentials of Spanish 
necessary to moke your trip as enjoyable as 
possible. With emphasis on Spanish required for 
Your arrival, Shopping for Souvenirs, Seeing the 
Sights, Touring the Country, Dining Out and Getting 
Acquainted, almost every situation is covered. 

Package includes: 

diskette, 4 audio cassettes, and rake-along manual.

tape recorder handy). 

Let's reuse that four-byte machine language program we wrote last 
month. It doesn't do anything but jump to a subroutine in ROM that 
rings a bell, but the techniques you use to manipulate this program are 
the same ones you need for working with the more complicated pro- 
grams you find as part of the packages you purchase. 

First, type call - 151 . The prompt should change from a bracket to an 
asterisk indicating that you're in the Monitor, where all the commands 
are expressed in hexadecimal numbers. Although we put the dollar sign 
symbol in front of a number to indicate that it's in hex notation when 
we're writing about it or issuing a DOS command, we don't use it in the 
Monitor because hex is the Monitor's native language. Type 9000.900F. 
This is the Monitor command to list the instructions in the sixteen bytes 
of memory from $9000 to $900F. You'll get two lines that begin with 
9000- and contain a bunch of pairs of numbers (what numbers depends 
on what your Apple's been up to). Now type 

9000: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 

Each pair of zeros is separated from the next pair by one space. The 
colon after a memory location is the Monitor command to enter the next 
two digits in that location, the following two digits in the next location, 
and so on. Type 9000.900F again. You should see that you've zeroed out 
these sixteen memory locations. 

Now enter a program by typing 9000:20 DD FB 60. Again list it to 
proofread it and make sure it's there. The command 20 is the machine 
language equivalent of gosub, while the command 60 is return. Location 
FBDD (64477) is a built-in Applesoft subroutine high up in memory that 
rings the bell once. 

The number indicating a memory location requires two bytes. Be- 
cause of an idiosyncracy of the microprocessor, the bytes must fall in 
reverse order. Thus location number $1357 is entered into memory as 
57 13. Type 9000G, and you should hear a beep from your speaker. The 
command G, for go, is the Monitor equivalent of run. 

Now that we have a machine language program in memory, let's 
move it around. Type 0G (zero G) to reenter Basic. If for some reason 
that doesn't work, hit reset; this won't erase your program. When you 
want to save a Basic program, typing save and the file name is enough be- 
cause your Apple can hold only one Basic program at a time and keeps 
pointers in special places in its own memory to tell it where the program 
begins and ends. Machine language programs, however, can be any- 
where, and there can be thousands of them in memory at a time. There- 
fore you can save them on a disk only if you can tell DOS which bytes in 
memory to save as a single program. You do this by typing bsave, to in- 
dicate that the file will contain a binary data or a machine language pro- 
gram, followed by the program's beginning memory address and, in- 
stead of its ending address, its length in bytes. Type: 

BSAVE TEST, A$9000,L$4 

and then check the catalog to make sure that it contains a binary file 
named Test. You can also use decimal notation for the address and 
length if you want by typing A36864.L4 instead. In both cases a comma 
is needed after the name and between the address and the length. 

Even though you can use decimal notation, there's an advantage to 
hex notation once you get used to it. Many machine language programs, 
including both The Graphics Magician's drawing program and Electric 
Duet's player program, are designed to use exactly — or else just under — 
some multiple of 256 ($100) bytes of memory. Apple's memory is di- 
vided into "pages," each of which is 100 hex bytes long (256 decimal). 
The memory addresses from $800 to $8FF, for example, are referred to as 
page 8, while the locations from $9000 to $90FF that contain our ma- 
chine language program are on page 144, which is the decimal equiva- 
lent of $90. 

A word of warning: On 48K Apples, DOS begins at $9600 (38400) 
and uses all of the remaining memory that's accessible to the user. Never 
put a machine language program above $95FF or you'll clobber DOS 
and may be unable to use your disk drive until you reboot. 

When you save a binary file, you also save on the disk its beginning 
address and length, and the file will automatically reload in exactly the 
same memory locations you saved it from unless you specify otherwise. 
Now, reenter the Monitor with call— 151. Erase your program with 



FEBRUARY 1983 



155 



9000: 00 00 0000, and make sure by listing it with 9000.9003. Load your 
file with the command bload Test and examine those four locations. They 
should contain your program. 

Fortunately, you aren't limited to reloading a machine language pro- 
gram in the place from which you saved it. If you want to put your pro- 
gram on page 130 (beginning at $8200 or 33280), you include the ad- 
dress information in your load command and type bload Test,A$8200 (or 
A 3 3280). There's no need to specify the length. After you've done this, 
either enter the Monitor or call 33280 to satisfy yourself that it worked. 

Moving a machine language program, or any memory range, from 
one place to another by bsaving and bloading a file is probably the eas- 
iest way because you don't have to enter the Monitor. However, if you 
are in the Monitor anyway you can move memory around directly using 
the less than (< ) sign and the letter M. To copy your program from 
$8200-58203 to $1000-$1003, type (in the Monitor): 

100CK8200.8203M 

The destination comes first, followed by the current location. Note that 
the beginning and ending bytes must be specified here rather than the 
beginning byte and the length. 

When you're using programs such as the two we've mentioned, you 
generally have to bload not only a picture-drawing or music-playing pro- 
gram but also one or more files containing the pictures to be drawn or 
the songs to be played. Then you have to be able to tell the draw- 
ing/playing program where in memory these files are. 

Just for the sake of variety, instead of ringing the bell let's pretend 
that Applesoft's home routine, located at $FC58 (64600), is a picture or 
music file and that our machine language program that calls it is the 
drawing or playing program. Enter the Monitor, examine locations $8200 
to $8203, which is one place we know this program still is, and change 
$8201 and $8202 to 58 and FC respectively. If you type 8200G in the 
Monitor or return to Basic and type call 64600, your screen will clear and 
the cursor will go to the upper left corner. Since you've changed your 
machine language program, you need to save the new one on the disk in 
place of the old by again typing bsave Test,A$8200,L$4. 

Turn your machine off and on again so that you know that all 
memory has been cleared. Now enter and run this program: 

10 D$ = CHR$(4) 

20 PRINT D$;"BLOAD TEST" 

30 CALL 33280 

Your drive should come on and then the screen should clear as the home 
command is executed. 

Here's how the program works. Line 10 lets the string variable D$ 
become the same as control-D, which the computer understands as the 
number 4. (Remember, your Apple understands everything in numbers 
only.) Control-D is the indication to DOS to take what follows as one of 
its commands, rather than as an instruction to print something on the 
screen. The semicolon simply extends the print command to the next 
instruction, which is to load a binary file called Test. Since a binary file 
will load into the same memory location it was saved from unless you 
instruct otherwise, your machine language program is placed again in the 
first four bytes of page 130. The call command runs the machine language 
program at memory location 33280 (decimal) or $8200 (hex). 

There's only one thing left to do before we can write an Applesoft 
program that will poke the address of the home command into a ma- 
chine language program. We must figure out how to take one decimal 
number and divide it into two decimal numbers whose hex equivalents, 
when combined into one hex number, will be the hex equivalent of the 
original decimal number. 

Using, for example, the location of the home subroutine, 64600, we 
can first note that its hex equivalent is FC58. As we did previously, we 
will poke this into memory backward with 58 going into the lower byte 
and FC into the next higher one. For any decimal number, L, we get the 
decimal value for the low order byte from the formula: 

L - (INT(L/256)*256) 
and that of the high order byte from the formula: 

INT(L/256) 

Using these formulas on 64600, we get 88 and 252 respectively. The hex 
equivalent of the latter is $FC, while that of the former is $58, which, 
when combined in correct order, becomes $FC58. 



Now, since you may be a bit confused by the fragmented instruc- 
tion, let's do a Basic program from scratch that will clear the screen, ring 
the bell, and turn on inverse or flashing mode or whatever depending on 
what numbers you poke into the example machine language program. 
The only new command is the one in line 20 that tells DOS to display the 
input and output commands it receives from the program so you'll know 
what's going on. Type: 

NEW 

10 D$ = CHR$(4) 

20 PRINT D$;"MON C,l,0" 

30 INPUT "ENTER A DECIMAL ENTRY POINT";L 
40 PRINT D$;"BLOAD TEST,A$9000" 
50 POKE 36865, L - (INT(L/256))*256 
60 POKE 36866, INT(L/256) 
70 CALL 36864 

When you run this program, the binary file named Test, which 
contains your four-byte machine language program, will be loaded into 
locations $9000 through $9003 (36864-36867). The values in two loca- 
tions in the program, $9001 and $9002 (36865 and 36866), are then 
changed to the hex numbers that can be combined to form the hex 
equivalent of the decimal number you'll enter from the keyboard when 
the input statement prompts you. When your Basic program calls your 
machine language program, it immediately jumps to the location you've 
poked into it and executes the machine language program it finds there. 

When you first run the program, enter 64600, and your screen will 
clear. To make it do something else, let L equal the entry point for a dif- 
ferent routine. Some of these for a 48K Apple are: turn on lo-res 
graphics, 62352; print a question mark, 56154; ring the bell, 64477; print 
inverse characters, 62071; print flashing characters, 62080; and return to 
normal characters, 62067. After being in flashing mode, you may have to 
return to ordinary text mode manually with the command normal from 
the keyboard before the program will run again. 

Except for the location numbers, this is the program needed to use 
fully the graphics and music packages and a number of other packages as 
well. It's short, simple, and, when you know what you're doing, not 
nearly as frightening as it looks in the instruction manuals.

SOFTCARD 
Symposium 

by Greg Tlbbetts 




Welcome to Symposium for February. 

Review. When we wound up our discussion last month, we had just 
finished describing in general the BIOS character I/O process. Before 
picking up where we left off, let's briefly review what we covered so it will 
be fresh in our minds. 

As we discussed, BDOS communicates with the hardware by means 
of seven BIOS functions. These functions correspond to the seven char- 
acter I/O routines in the BIOS— CONST, CONIN, CONOUT, 
PUNCH, READER, LISTST, and LIST. As far as BIOS is concerned, 
these seven routines represent only four logical devices; namely, Con- 
sole, Punch, Reader, and List, which can be abbreviated CON:, PUN:, 
RDR:, and LST:. 

We learned that while BDOS only knows of four logical devices we 
can actually deal with more than four by having BIOS combine several 
physical device drivers into each of the seven logical device routines. To 
tell BIOS which physical device to access when each routine is called, we 
use the IOBYTE. We said that the device mapping, as the IOBYTE con- 
cept is referred to, can be altered by STAT and that BDOS is unaware of 
either the change in output or the current value of the IOBYTE. 

Finally, we discovered that each BIOS character I/O routine deter- 
mines the physical device driver routine to use by getting its specific two- 
bit field from the IOBYTE and decoding it. Based on the value found, 
the routine selects one of eleven vector addresses from the I/O vector 
table in the IOCB. Each table entry is the starting address of the actual 
physical device driver to be used. These vectors are the means by which 
you can modify the BIOS character I/O routines; this is done by chang- 
ing them to point at your own drivers rather than at the standard drivers 
in the BIOS. 

We discovered one negative element in all this. Of the eleven possible 
physical devices named in the system— TTY:, CRT:, UC1 :, PTR:, UR1 :, 
UR2:, PTP:, UP1:, UP2:, LPT:, and UL1:— only eight separate devices 
are allowed in SoftCard CP/M. This is so because three pairs of phys- 
ical device names (TTY: and CRT:, UR1: and UR2:, and UP1: and 
UP2:) share the same vector and are therefore a single device. For pur- 
poses of simplification, we'll refer to these as TTY:, URx:, and UPx:, 
respectively. 

There's one more thing before we proceed. A while back we discussed 
the patch area in the BIOS, which is mentioned in your SoftCard manual 
on page 2-18. This area is made up of three 128-byte areas of memory. 
The first one (0F200H -0F27FH) is for BDOS's LST: device, the second 
(OF280H-OF2FFH) is for the PUN: and RDR: devices, and the third 
(OF300H-OF37FH) is for the CON: device. (The SoftCard manual 
actually says TTY: instead of CON:, but TTY: is a physical device and 
these areas correspond to logical devices.) 

The purpose of these areas is to provide you with protected space in 
which to install your own driver routines, alterations to BIOS opera- 
tions, and other handy stuff. Actually, there's no real restriction on 
which areas are used for what device, since BIOS is not even aware of the 
areas' existence. There is a restriction, however, on part of the console 
patch area. In the last part of this area (from 0F34AH to 0F37FH), 



Version 2.20B of the BIOS contains corrections for errors in CONST, 
CONIN, and CONOUT, the three console device routines. 

Your usable space, therefore, ends at 0F349H. In the course of this 
next series of articles, we'll be pointing these patches out. 

Enough of Old Stuff, On with the New. This month we'll begin 
looking in detail at the BIOS character I/O routines in order to find out 
how the various hardware devices are driven. We won't finish dealing 
with this subject in one column; two or more may not even be sufficient 
to cover it. Our approach, therefore, will be to go each month until we 
run out of space and then pick up the following month where we left off. 

One word of warning here. Although no complete source code will 
be shown, addresses for some specific routines may be given. We aren't 
at a point yet, however, where you'll be given tested alterations and/or 
programs to remove and replace the system tracks of your disk. So if you 
decide to experiment, be sure you have backups of the disks you use. Al- 
though zapping a disk is not a common result of an error in the char- 
actor I/O routines, when you're modifying code in the operating system, 
there's always that risk. 

Our starting point this time will be the logical Console device rou- 
tines. The Console device is used by BDOS for communication with the 
user, normally via the keyboard and the screen. Of the four physical 
device names that can be assigned to CON:, only two are actually phys- 
ical devices. They are TTY: (remember, this is both TTY: and CRT:) 
and UC1:. BAT:, as we said last month, simply assigns Console input to 
the logical RDR: device and Console output to the logical LST: device. 

In SoftCard CP/M the TTY: device is implemented as the normal 
keyboard and screen and is the default IOBYTE assignment. UC1:, on 
the other hand, is the physical device that it's possible to implement as a 
special device driver of your own. 

The TTY: device uses Console Input Vector #1 and Console Output 
Vector #1 in the vector table, while UC1: uses the #2 input and output 
vectors. Altering the #2 vector addresses, therefore, makes it possible to 
implement UC1: as a previously unknown device. Since the UC1: device 
is not implemented when the SoftCard is shipped, the #2 Console vec- 
tors have the same value as the #1 vectors. As shipped, then, UC1: 
operates just like TTY:; the reason for this is to prevent the system from 
hanging if the user should experimentally assign CON: = UCl: without 
having implemented it. 

Since UC1: is reserved to be a user-defined device, the TTY: device 
drivers must be capable of handling all other Apple keyboard/display 
combinations, including both the standard Apple console (the forty- 
column display and the Apple keyboard) and such external console 
hardware as terminals, eighty-column cards, and so on. Therefore, 
regardless of what type of hardware you're using, all of your console I /O 
is being handled by the TTY: device drivers through the #1 Console 
vectors. 

Obviously, this same driver can't handle both types of hardware. If 
nothing else, the addresses to operate a card in slot 3 differ from the ad- 
dresses of the standard Apple keyboard and screen. It seems as though 
there must be some fancy footwork going on here, and, in fact, there is. It

happens during the BOOT process, and is performed by the initializa- 
tion routines we discussed a couple of months ago in our series on the 
BOOT code. If slot 3 contains an eighty-column card, a serial card, or an 
Apple Communications card, then certain addresses in the TTY: device 
drivers in each of the three Console devices (CONST, CONIN, and 
CONOUT) are patched during BOOT to match the actual hardware 
that is present. As we'll see when we examine these routines, the ad- 
dresses altered are those that point to the memory-mapped hardware 
area from 0E000H to OEFFFH (6502 SC000 to SCFFF). 

Setting up the TTY: device to handle both types of keyboard/screen 
combinations was a design choice. The CON: device could have been 
implemented so that TTY: was just the native Apple hardware and UC1 : 
was any eighty-column device installed in slot 3. Had things been done 
that way, the user could have switched between the forty-column and 
eighty-column screens simply by changing the IOBYTE. Unfortunately, 
this would also have eliminated any chance for users to implement their 
own console devices, since both possible devices would have been used. 
User expandability was deemed more important than an easy ability to 
switch between screen formats; and, while doing the latter is not impos- 
sible, BOOT's alteration of the BIOS routines makes it difficult. 

Let's take a look now at the various devices that the console service 
routines may have to deal with. Besides supporting the standard Apple 
hardware, SoftCard CP/M allows three additional console device inter- 
faces — an eighty-column board, a serial interface, and the serial portion 
of an Apple Communications card. Since SoftCard CP/M requires that 
these devices be in slot 3, we can count on their access routines being in 
specific places. Also, since the eighty-column cards that are supported 
are, from the BIOS's point of view, identical to serial cards, we can treat 
them as serial cards for our purposes. 

With those facts in mind, we now know that we need routines for 
Apple hardware, serial cards, and the comm card. Since we must test the 
status of, read from, and write to these cards, we know that we will need 
a total of nine actual hardware device drivers to accomplish the three 
console functions. We'll point these drivers out as we discuss the three 
routines. 

The first console routine we'll look at is console status, which is 
known by the label CONST. The Digital Research criteria for CONST 
states that CONST's function when called by BDOS or another routine 
is to determine whether or not a character is ready at the physical device 
currently assigned to CON:. If a character is available, CONST is to 
return to the routine calling it (which is usually BDOS) with the value 
OFFH in the [A] register. If a character is not available, CONST is to 
return to the calling routine, placing the value 00 in the [A] register. The 
physical device here is normally the keyboard; therefore, what CONST is 
usually doing is checking to see whether a key has been pressed since the 
last keyboard input was accepted. 

As stated, we'll need to make allowances for all three types of de- 
vices, depending on whether a card is installed in slot 3 and, if so, what 
type it is. In the case of the CONST routine, the method for determining 
if a character is ready stays pretty much the same regardless of the kind 
of card that is or isn't in slot 3, but the addresses used are different. Let's 
look at how they differ. 

As you can see from your Apple reference manual, the Apple key- 
board indicates that a key has been pressed by altering the value in the 
memory-mapped hardware location known as the keyboard strobe. To 
the Z-80, the keyboard strobe is at memory location 0E000H. When a 
key is pressed, the parity bit of the keyboard strobe is set. (The parity bit 
on any eight-bit value is always the highest order bit; bit 7. To "set" a bit 
is to make it a 1; to reset it is to make it a 0. Simple, no?) Now, when the 
parity bit of an eight-bit number is set, the value of that number exceeds 
127, since the binary number lOOOOOOOB is 128. What we are checking to 
see, therefore, is whether the keyboard strobe value exceeds 127. 

A similar process occurs when a card in slot 3 has a character avail- 
able. Both serial and comm card interfaces also set a bit in one of the 
bytes in their address space (for serial cards, this is the parity bit; for 
comm cards, it's bit 0). The address of the byte altered will actually cor- 
respond to one of the card's data or strobe registers, rather than to 
memory. 

Each slot on the Apple has two areas of address space assigned to 



it— a scratchpad space of sixteen bytes between 0E080H and 0E0FFH 
and a 256-byte page of space between 0E100H and 0E7FFH. The 
scratchpad space, normally used for hardware registers or strobe loca- 
tions, is set up so that for slot n the space is OEOxOH-OECttFH where x 
= n + 8H (for slot 3, x = 0BH). The page of space, usually used 
for ROMs on the card, is set up so that for slot n the space is 
0E«00H-0E«FFH. 

With both types of interfaces we're looking at here, the strobe regis- 
ter also called control register, is in fact in the scratchpad space — 
0E0BEH, to be exact. CONST must therefore check 0EO00H for Apple 
hardware and 0E0BEH for external console devices, such as serial cards 
and comm cards. It must check the parity bit for Apple hardware or 
serial cards and bit 0 for comm cards. 

CONST accomplishes this by means of two subroutines, one at 
0DB0CH (labeled CONST1), which is part of the character I/O rou- 
tines, and the other at 0F34AH (labeled STSPAT), which is one of the 
version 2.20B corrections mentioned earlier. 

The STSPAT subroutine corrects a problem with comm cards where- 
in the parity bit was being read in place of bit 0. The correction was im- 
plemented by installing STSPAT in the patch area and changing the 
Console Status Vector address (in the vector table) to be the start of 
STSPAT rather than the start of CONST1. Since the CONST routine's 
first activity is a jump to the address contained in this vector, control 
always goes to the correction first. 

STSPAT solves the problem by checking the slot table to see if a 
comm card is installed. If a comm card is found, STSPAT loads the 
card's status byte (0E0BEH, remember?) and checks to see whether bit 0 
is set. Based on the result, STSPAT makes the value in the [A] register ei- 
ther OFFH or 00 to fulfill the BDOS criteria and then returns directly to 
BDOS. 

If no comm card is found, control goes to CONST 1, where a status 
byte is loaded. The address of the status byte is the one that BOOT alters 
during the initialization process. The address starts out at E000H and is 
changed to 0E0BEH if any card is found in slot 3. 

CONST1 checks the status byte for a parity bit. Just like STSPAT, 
CONST 1 alters the value of [A], depending on the result, before return- 
ing to BDOS. And that's all there is to CONST. 

The second routine we'll talk about is CONIN. It's considerably 
longer and somewhat more complex than CONST but certainly no 
harder to understand. 

The CP/M design criteria indicates that when CONIN is called it 
must not return until it has received a character from the current console 
device. When it has gotten the character, it must place it in the [A] regis- 
ter and reset the parity bit. This resetting of the parity bit is CP/M's way 
of ensuring that ASCII character data won't be misinterpreted in future 
transfers or internal operations, since all ASCII characters can be repre- 
sented by the seven low-order bits. 

Like CONST, CONIN must also be capable of dealing with all three 
types of hardware. This is accomplished in the same way in CONIN as it 
is in CONST; BOOT alters an address in the TTY: driver. Unlike 
CONST, CONIN has more than one function to perform, however. 
First, it must get the character of input; second, it must check to see if 
this is a character the user wishes to have redefined. This keyboard 
redefinition is mentioned in your manual on page 2-17. To get the in- 
put, CONIN calls a subroutine at 0DB50H (labeled CNIN2) that ac- 
tually reads the character. Then, when control returns to CONIN, any 
necessary redefinition will be done. Let's examine the character input 
function first. 

It is CNIN2 that looks at the IOBYTE and decides which device 
driver is to be used. It is important to note that CNIN2 was called and 
not jumped to, meaning that, regardless of which driver is used, control 
will eventually return to CONIN. CNIN2 first checks its field of the 
IOBYTE (bits 0 and 1), which will indicate TTY:, UC1 :, or BAT:. We'll 
look first at BAT:. 

If batch mode is in effect, the CP/M design criteria dictates that it is 
supposed to get its input from whatever physical device the logical reader 
device is attached to. To do this it should jump to the READER rou- 
tine, where the reader bits of the IOBYTE could be checked to see which 
physical reader device (TTY:, RDR:, or URx) is in use. Instead, how-

ever, BAT: jumps to the address contained in Reader Input Vector #1 (in 
the vector table). That address corresponds to the physical RDR: device 
driver, and, consequently, batch mode input will only come from this 
device. (This is a bug that can be fixed easily, but rather than take time 
to do that now we'll come back to it later on.) If batch mode is in effect and 
the jump to the RDR: device driver takes place, the flow is identical to 
the flow that occurs through the READER routine, so we'll leave it until 
our later discussion of READER and move on to what CNIN2 does for 
TTY: and UC1:, the other two physical Console devices. 

If the IOBYTE isn't set for batch mode, CNIN2 checks it for the 
value of either TTY: or UC1:. For TTY:, CNIN2 jumps to the address 
contained in the #1 Console vector, while for UC1: it jumps to the #2 
vector address. The #1 vector should contain the start address of the 
TTY: device driver TTYIN1 at 0DB29H. However, another 2.20B 
correction made it necessary to change this address to 0F358H, which is 
the address of INPPAT, the second correction routine in the patch area. 

The INPPAT routine was installed to correct the problem of the 
parity bit not being reset if the character came from a device in slot 3. 

Unlike STSPAT, which may never execute the standard driver, 
INPPAT calls TTYIN1 itself to get the character. When the character 
comes back, INPPAT simply resets the parity bit before returning 
control to CONIN. 

Earlier we said that UC1: and TTY: have the same function when the 
SoftCard is shipped. In the case of version 2.20B, this is not technically 
true. While both devices use TTYIN1, INPPAT's starting address was 
only placed in the #1 vector and not the #2, meaning that UC1: is prone 
to error. But, since you won't be seriously using UC1: without altering 
the vectors yourself, this shouldn't be a problem. In either case, then, 
TTYINi is the device driver used to get keyboard input. As such, it is the 
driver modified by the initialization routines during BOOT. 

When it executes, TTYINI sets a register equal to the console device 
slot, slot 3, and then ordinarily jumps to a routine called RDKB at 
0DB2FH. That address is changed by BOOT, however, if there's a 
usable card in slot 3. In that case, BOOT identifies the card as either a 
serial card or a comm card and changes the address TTYINI jumps to — 
either to RSER at 0DD1CH, the address of the serial read routine; or to 
RCOM at 0DD12H, the comm card read routine. Let's examine these 
three routines in order. 

The routine RDKB is reasonably short. Obviously, since the Apple 
hardware is in use, RDKB ignores the slot 3 value in the register. The 
routine loads the keyboard strobe value from 0E000H into register [A] 
and checks for a keypress by testing the parity bit, just as CONST did. If 
the parity bit is clear, RDKB keeps looping (reexecuting that same code) 
until a key is pressed. Once the parity bit has been set, RDKB knows a 
key has been pressed so it clears the keyboard strobe by writing a value 
into address 0E010H. This address is another register in the scratchpad 
space that, when accessed, tells the Apple hardware to clear the parity bit 
at 0E000H. This process works with any value written to 0E010H, since 
the write itself is all that is required. 

RDKB uses the value it just loaded into [A] from the keyboard 
strobe. This value is also the character just typed in at the keyboard, since 
the keyboard strobe serves two purposes — it indicates that a key is 
pressed and contains the character value in the lower-order seven bits. 
Once the strobe has been cleared, the parity bit of the character value in 
[A] is reset in accordance with BDOS criteria and an RET instruction is 
executed, returning control to INPPAT. 

RCOM operates in much the same way as the RDKB routine. All 
accessing of data is done by dealing only with the hardware registers in 
the scratchpad space. 

The hardware status register (which is similar to the keyboard strobe) 
is, as we already know, at 0EOBEH for a comm card in slot 3. Unlike the 
keyboard strobe, however, the status register doesn't contain the charac- 
ter itself. The character is stored in a separate data register situated one 
location beyond it at OEOBFH. RCOM, then, waits for a character by 
continually checking the status register's bit 0 and looping until this bit is 
set. When that occurs, which means that a character is ready, RCOM 
reads the character from the data register into register [A] and returns to 
INPPAT. 

RSER obtains its character in a different way than the other two rou- 



tines do. Because getting a character from either a serial card or an 
eighty-column card is a more complex undertaking, RSER performs its 
function by calling the input routine that's contained in ROM on the 
card itself. Since this ROM contains 6502 code, RSER must activate the 
6502 and allow it to make the call. The address to call is the same 
whether the card is a true serial interface or an eighty-column card look- 
ing like a serial interface. 

Both types of cards use something that is known colloquially as a 
C800 ROM. What this means is that these cards require more ROM 
space than the 256 bytes allotted to them in their memory-mapped I/O 
space. This possibility was allowed for when the Apple was designed by 
making the last half of the I/O space— from 6502 SC800 to SCFFF— an 
area to be shared by all the cards. To make use of this area of memory, a 
card must first stop any other card from using it and must then activate 
its own use of the area. This process is known as disabling and enabling 
the C800 ROM. 

A card that wishes to use the shared memory area disables the C800 
ROMs of all other cards by reading address SCFFF and enables its own 
by accessing location SCFFF, its first ROM address. Besides the C800 
ROM activity, certain memory addresses that the serial card input rou- 
tine will use must be initialized. Known as temporaries, these addresses 
are in the 6502 page zero and are used by the ROM to get the value to be 
sent to the card or to store the value that is read from it. RSER performs 
these tasks by calling SER1, a setup subroutine at 0DCEEH. 

SER1 uses the register containing the slot number to calculate the ad- 
dresses it needs to do the initializations. Once that's been accomplished, 
SER1 returns control to RSER, which enables the 6502 and calls the 
serial card ROM input routine at SC84D. When control returns to theZ- 
80 and RSER, RSER loads the newly read byte of data from the page 
zero temporary at location $678 + n, where n = slot number = 3. It then 
returns to INPPAT. 

Now that we've covered these three read routines, it's important to 
note that RDKB won't be encountered again, since no other BIOS rou- 
tine uses it. RSER and RCOM, however, are used by other device 
drivers to get and send data to serial and comm cards in other slots. This 
is why these routines need the slot number and don't simply assume the 
use of slot 3. In any case, when we encounter RSER and RCOM in other 
device drivers, we'll only reference them by name and won't cover them 
in detail again. 

To finish our discussion of CONIN, we have just returned to 
INPPAT from one of our three driver routines. If we got the character 
from RSER or RCOM, its parity bit won't necessarily have been cleared. 
We don't want those two routines to clear the parity bit automatically 
because, in some cases, other devices using the routines may require the 
parity bit to be set for data verification. 

INPPAT then, finishes the function of getting the character by clear- 
ing the parity bit and returning to CONIN. It is at this point that 
CONIN checks for and performs any keyboard redefinition the user has 
called for. In the SoftCard manual, the redefinition table is mentioned as 
being made up of six two-byte pairs, with the first byte being the charac- 
ter you wish to alter and the second being the character you wish to sub- 
stitute for the first one. CONIN accesses this table now, checking the 
character it has just received against the first character of each of the two- 
byte pairs. If no match is found by the time CONIN reaches the end of 
the table (designated either by six pairs of bytes being examined or by a 
0FFH value in the first byte), it returns to the program calling it (usually 
BDOS) with the character it received, as is, in register [A]. If, on the 
other hand, a match is found, the second character byte from that entry 
in the table is loaded into [A] and CONIN returns with that character in- 
stead. 

This completes our discussion of the CONIN function. 

The final console driver routine is CONOUT. It is by far the most 
complex of the driver routines, since it must handle not only straight 
character data but also all the screen functions, such as homing the cur- 
sor, clearing the screen, and so on. We'll defer our discussion until next 
month. At that time, when we finish talking about the console I/O rou- 
tines, we'll also provide the correction we mentioned (to ensure that the 
logical READER routine and not the physical RDR: device is used dur- 
ing batch processing). Until next month. ... it

display? Then, you're ready for the 
complete SPECIAL PAC EXPANO-A- 
RAM with VC-Extender. 

This package allows you to utilize the 
extra memory on EXPAND-A-RAM for 
larger VisiCalc worksheets and 
expand from 40 to 80 columns. It 
includes a special command that 
enables you to transfer large 
worksheets between memory and disk 
very quickly- a real time saver. 

You get much more. There's 
MEMORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
which relocates DOS so you have 
more free memory in BASIC for large 
BASIC programs. And, there's RAM 
TEST and UTILITY FUNCTIONS. 
Plus, you get RAMDISK emulators for 
APPLE DOS, APPLE PASCAL, and 
CP/M. It's a software package that 



emulates a standard Apple floppy disk 
drive but is 2 to 10 times faster- 
very handy for word processing 
applications like WORDSTAR. 

EXPAND-A-RAM plugs into any slot. 
Unlike other memory expansion cards 
that were designed to function as solid 
state disks, EXPAND-A-RAM works 
with the many software programs that 
use 1 6K of RAM in slot 0-including 
CP/M, APPLE PASCAL, LISA, 
MERLIN . . . and many others. No mod 
ification of your Apple II is required 



You can start with the basic 1 6K 
EXPAND-A-RAM for $225 and then 
expand to 32K, 64K, or the f ull 1 28K as 
needed by adding 1 6K or 64K memory 
chips and the software later. There are 
a number of options. See your local 
dealer for details. It's the smart way to 
handle your memory expansion.

VisiCalc was a swell idea 

for then. 



The next generation. First generation electronic 
worksheets were a good idea. They were early software 
management tools that could eliminate a lot of hours 
with a spreadsheet, calculator, pencil and eraser. Enter 
Multiplan, the next generation electronic worksheet 
that's as easy to use as it is useful. 
Make comparisons. Compare Multiplan to any of 
the earlier electronic worksheets. We've given you some 
"prompts" above. 

Compare learning time. Multiplan's tutorial book brings 
you up to speed. Fast. But Multiplan doesn't stop there. 
Multiplan's On-line Reference Guide gives you instant 
help if you have questions. It knows where you are in 
Multiplan and offers information related to your problem, 
right on the screen. 

Compare ease of use. All Multiplan prompts are 
full length words or phrases. And Multiplan provides 
"naming," the ability to assign a plain English name to any

cell or area. "Gross Profit = Sales— Cost" rather than 
"AA44 = AZ23— BK154." Which means you can work 
more intuitively. And faster. 

Compare utility. Multiplan lets you link related work- 
sheets so that information is transferred between them 
automatically. For instance, you can keep regional sales 
forecasts on separate sheets but link them with your overall 
company forecast. Then, just change the forecast for 
any region, and the company forecast sheet is updated 
automatically. Something you can't do with first generation 
worksheets. 

Compare reports. Not just the work you can do, but the 

way you can present it. Multiplan's flexible formatting 
options allow you to produce presentation-quality reports. 
And its sorting capability lets you sort by either alpha- 
betic or numeric order. So a sales manager who normally 
lists sales regions alphabetically could sort by amount 
sold and conveniently rank by sales performance. The

BY MATTHEW YUEN 



Clark's not the shy type. When he makes a move for a young lady, he 
aims straight for the heartstrings. 

To: Linn842 
From: Clark347 
Subject: Us 

Hi, Linn! Do you like Long Island Iced Teas? How about evening drives 
on the beach? Or maybe just the two of us spending the weekend at the Riv- 
iera? Sound good? If so, drop me a note in my mailbox, and we can arrange 
a rendezvous. 

Linn's the romantic type. Sipping drinks on the back porch of a 
beach house, cruising down the beach in a Maserati, and flying to the 
French Riviera are just her bag. She's one high-class lady. 

To: Clark347 
From Linn842 
Subject: Yes! 

Oh, Clark, you really know how to treat a lady. I just read your letter, 
and everything sounds great — especially the Riviera! Of course, we don't 



have to do all this at once; let's spread it out. What shall we do first? 

Time Is on My Side. At last, Clark has found himself a mate. After 
days turning to weeks, weeks turning to months, his patience has paid 
off. Look out, Linn, here comes a man whose generosity knows no 
bounds. 

To: Linn842 
From: Clark347 
Subject: It's a date. 

Right on! I was so glad to see your letter in my box today. I really don't 
care what we do first. I just received a whole box of instant iced tea from my 
cousin in Long Island. My '73 Toyota will handle the beach, but you'll have 
to bring gas money. 

And I'm glad to hear you like the Riviera. What say we plan for next 
weekend there? The Riviera Trailer Town is in Fairdale, just a two-hour 
drive from here. There are bowling alleys, duck farms, and really keen rust 
museums nearby. We'll have a swell time. When should I pick you up? 

Before hanging up his modem, Clark decided to glance through the 



FEBRUARY 1983 



165 



public message section of the bulletin board service he was on, the same 
one on which he had just made a date with Linn. 

Hello, Dolly! That's the latest in the continuing story of Clark and 
Linn. The initial meeting and everything else in between all took place 
during the past few months. The funny thing is, Clark and Linn have 
never actually met. They "met" on a bulletin board service (BBS) 
through the miracle of modem. But it's not just your ordinary BBS. 

This one's called Dial-Your-Match, from Matchmaker Enterprises. 

Based in Burbank, California, Dial-Your-Match was born not quite 

a year and a half ago. Today, there 

are more than a dozen of them op- 
erating across the country and even 
one in France. 

You connect yourself to Dial- 
Your-Match the same way you 
would to any other BBS; just dial 
the telephone number with a 
modem. But that's where the simi- 
larities end. True, there are the pub- 
lic message board and electronic 
mail functions that you find on most 
other BBSs, but it's how they're 
used that makes the difference. 

Dial-Your-Match has only one 
purpose — to get people together. 
Though its name implies that this is 
a computer-dating service, it can al- 
so be used as a way to begin pen-pal 
relationships or special interest 
groups. But almost any user of the 
system will tell you that he or she is 
there to pep up the old social life. 

Bewitched, Booted, and Bewil- 
dered. To find out more about Dial- 
Your-Match, let's go back a few 
months and see how Clark and Linn 
first got together. 

When you first log onto the sys- 
tem, the first thing you have to do is 
fill out a questionnaire. After ask- 
ing your name, city, and state and a 
brief physical description of your- 
self, the questions range from 
"What type of music do you enjoy 
most?" to "What kind of relation- 
ship are you looking for?" Don't 
worry; it's a multiple-choice ques- 
tionnaire, so if you're stuck for an- 
swers you get to pick. 

Once Clark has answered the 

twenty or so questions, his question- 

naire is filed to disk and he is assigned a password and address code. The 
address consists of his name (or handle) followed by two to four num- 
bers. For instance, if Clark prefers to be called Clark, his address code 
might be "Clark347." On the other hand, Doug is rather shy, so he en- 
ters "Big-D" as his handle and becomes Big-D771. 

The password allows you to log on without having to fill out a ques- 
tionnaire each time. It also ensures that only you can read the mail that's 
addressed to you. Upon entering your password, Dial-Your-Match up- 
dates the logbook and then immediately lets you know whether or not 
you have mail waiting. 

Clark is now in the Matchmaker's den. For first-time callers, the 
most obvious command to use is Matchmaker, make me a match. The 
match command will match Clark with other callers in the "date-a- 
base." Dial-Your-Match searches through every other person who has 
called the system in its attempt to find the perfect match, beginning with 
the caller who logged on the system the earliest. When it finds a com- 
patible match, it prints out the address code, percent match-up, age, 
state, and sexual preference of that person. 



Clark now has a list of prospective matches. Next, he can use the 
browse command to look at their questionnaires to see how they an- 
swered each question. Does she smoke? Does she like classical music? 
What are her favorite hobbies? It's all there at the press of a key. Brows- 
ing the questionnaires of potential matches will tell you how many times 
they called, how many days ago they called last, and how many vacant 
mail slots they have. From this information, you can figure out whether 
or not the person you're interested in is an active caller or one who called 
just a few times and not much else after that. 




Please Allow Me To Introduce Myself. If Clark finds someone who 
looks interesting, it's up to him to let his presence be known. Linn842 
looks pretty compatible. The most logical way to contact her is to send 
her a private letter. Dial-Your-Match first checks her mailbox to see if 
there are any open slots for his letter. 

Each user is given five mail slots. When those are filled, that person 
cannot receive any more mail until he or she reads and deletes the letters 
that are there. If you're attempting to send a letter to someone whose 
mailbox is full, the message "Sorry, Gail already has five letters" 
appears. 

Seeing that Linn has one more open slot, Clark sends her the follow- 
ing letter 

To: Linn842 
From: Clark347 
Subject: Hello! 

Greetings from northern California! I recently read your questionnaire 
after being matched with you 74 percent, and I would like to talk with you. I

don't know whether or not you have read my questionnaire. If you haven't, 
please do so and decide if you want to talk. Tm twenty-three, single, and 
have brown hair and brown eyes. I'm 5' 9" and 160 pounds. Palo Alto is a 
few miles north of San Jose. Hope to hear from you soon. Clark347. 

The next time Linn calls up, she will be able to read her letters, 
Clark's among them. But suppose Linn didn't have any free mail slots. 
Clark could wait and call back a few days later and hope that by then she 
would have cleared her mailbox, but he doesn't have to. 

The public message board is where callers can leave messages for the 
general public. Messages range from discussion of singles' activities to 
jokes. David644, for instance, keeps the general public aware of what's 
happening on Late Night with David Letterman: 



The best way to find out more about Dial-Your-Match is to call 
one up and log on. Here's a list of currently operating boards.

To: All 

From David644 

Subject: David Lettermaniacs 

Hey, did everybody see the elevator races on Late Night? And what's 
happened to good ole Bud Melman? Don't miss Wednesday's installment of 
Stupid Pet Tricks: it's sure to be a hit. See you all, David644. 

I Saw It in the Want Ads. But the most frequent use of the board is 
for people to advertise themselves. On it, you might see "Chicago man 
looking for outgoing females in the same area to go dancing with," or 
"Anybody out there from Maryland? If so, let's communicate!" or 
"Marian563, please empty your mailbox so I can write to you!" 

Private mail is stored as one gigantic text file, taking up a whole disk. 
Public messages, questionnaires, and the user log are all on a separate 
disk. With more than six hundred users on the date-a-base at one time, 
all sending mail and posting messages, storage space is quickly taken up. 
To remedy this, Dial-Your-Match limits the public board to one hun- 
dred messages at a time. As soon as a hundred messages are posted, the 
next one will be written over the oldest one on the disk. In other words, 
messages will number from one to a hundred, from two to a hundred 
and one, and so on. 

The same sort of overwriting procedure keeps the number of users at 
its maximum. There is space on disk for 768 users. As soon as the 769th 
new user calls, he will take the place of the person who hasn't called in 
the longest period of time, which is usually about a month. 

Finally, if you have nothing else to do while on-line, you can always 
chat with the Matchmaker. In the chat mode, you can communicate live 
with the Matchmaker, tell jokes, shoot the breeze, or do whatever suits 
your fancy. The chat command pages the Matchmaker with a few bells 
for about thirty seconds. If the Matchmaker isn't around, the caller will 
see the message, "Sorry, the Matchmaker isn't in right now." 

I Can't Get No Satisfaction. Dial-Your-Match debuted in October 
1981, the brainchild of graphics programmer Gregg Collins. "The idea 
came to me when I first got my modem. I bought my Apple as a toy to 
play games with, and calling up bulletin board services was fun, but they 
all offered the same things," Collins recalls.

"Whenever you scanned the 
public board, it was always 'RAM 
card for sale, $75,' or 'Clock card 
and disk drive for Apple II; must 
sell,' or 'Anybody have a color CRT 
for sale?' If you ever saw someone of 
the opposite sex, you didn't know 
where she lived, how old she was, or 
anything like that." 

The format of BBSs was simple 
enough, but the information was 
boring. That's when Collins got the 
idea to have people fill out ques- 
tionnaires when they logged on. But 
then, if they're going to do that, why 
not match them up? 

"It seemed like a good idea, but 
it didn't start out the way it is now," 
says Collins. The first version had 
no public message board, and you 
were only allowed to match to one 
person. The program would assign 
you a romance mate, and you were 
stuck. If that person didn't like you, 
he or she would disconnect you, and 
the next time you called you were 
greeted with a cold, yet direct, mes- 
sage: "Your romance mate has re- 
jected you." Ouch. 

Later, Collins thought of matching people up with several others and 
letting them pick. But then he reasoned, "No, that would be two-timing; 
they should be allowed only one at a time." Finally, he just junked the 
whole program and started over from scratch. 

The later version is the current version, with minor changes. When 
trying to construct a match, the first thing the program does is look at the 
person's sexual preference and then eliminate those who cannot match 
this person. 

"I have what I call my Unpatented Sexual Preference Matrix," Col- 
lins boasts. "There are thirty-six different matching possibilities, cross- 
referencing heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual callers, both male 
and female." If the caller is a heterosexual male, he can match with a fe- 
male heterosexual and a female bisexual; everyone else is eliminated. 
Thus, his file is assigned a string variable of thirty-six zeros and ones; the 
ones indicate that that type of match works for him. 

Including homosexual users presented somewhat of a dilemma for 
Collins. "My mother said, 'You're going to have trouble if users start 
complaining about gays being on the system.' All I could answer was 
that they exist. I could match them up to females and get them all upset, 
or I could match them up with each other and let them carry on their 
correspondence in private, and I chose the latter." 

Collins openly admits that he started Dial-Your-Match as "just a fun 
thing." Despite that, many people really are dialing their matches. 

"They don't tell me every step of the way how they're doing, but once 
in a while I'll get a message that says, 'Dear Matchmaker: Please delete 
me from this system. I have found my match, and we're both happy.' " 

Reaping the Fruits of Franchise. To say that Dial-Your-Match has 
changed Collins's life would be an understatement. He met his current 
roommate, a former Dial-Your-Match system operator who moved to 
Burbank from New York City, through the system. He has been fea- 
tured in newspapers across the country, Mademoiselle, Money, and will 
be in next March's Glamour magazine. He was interviewed on the air by 
a radio station in Orlando, Florida. His second disk drive and Epson 
MX- 100 printer were both purchased with money he made selling the 
Dial-Your-Match software. 

It was exactly a year ago that Collins sold his first program. At first, 
the thought didn't occur to him to sell the program. "I wanted mine to be 
the only one," he says. But people began telling him that if he didn't sell 
it they would write their own, and his would get lost in the crowd. 




"So, I changed some of the code, making it more user-friendly so 
anyone could run it, and now they're up all over the country." And it 
doesn't stop there. 

Collins sold his twenty-seventh copy last December to Michel Bar- 
thelemy, who has set up the first Dial-Your-Match outside the United 
States, in Marseille, France.

"I saw the number for Dial-Your-Match on Bill Blue's Personal 
Message Service listing in San Diego," says Barthelemy from his photo 
studio in Marseille. "I met Gregg on the system and told him I would 
like to start one in the south of France." 

Barthelemy has not only started a Dial-Your-Match, but he also 
plans to include American users on his system for the French to browse, 
contact, and exchange mail with. After a few program modifications on 
Collins's part, Barthelemy will call Collins's system every day or two, and 
both will exchange their respective users' mail by modem. 

Please, Wait a Minute, Mr. Postman. One of the first Dial-Your- 
Matches to be sold went to a mail order dating service in Savannah, 
Georgia, called Viva la Difference! The Matchmaker there is Julie, who 
began Viva as a hobby three years ago. Already an Apple user, Julie 
spotted a magazine ad for Dial-Your-Match and knew an opportunity 
when she saw one. 

"Both the number and quality of users have risen since I've added 
DYM to Viva," Julie proudly states. "I have about four hundred mem- 
bers in Viva and have just about doubled that with Dial-Your-Match." 

For female users, whether they're from Dial-Your-Match or not, 
membership to Viva is free. Males must pay a fee. 

Meanwhile, on the West Coast, Marc Schoenberg runs a similar 
DYM/Viva combination. His is Dial-Your-Match #19, located in Santa 
Monica, California. Schoenberg, with a little help from Julie, is able to 
offer local callers a longer list of potential dates. 

From her Viva mail order list, Julie sends Schoenberg a list of people 
in his area who don't have access to terminals but can be reached 
through the mail. This gives Schoenberg's callers a greater number of 
people from which to choose. His callers can then get in touch with Viva 
directly if they wish to correspond with any of those who can be contact- 
ed only by mail. 

But that's not where the features of his system end. He has also di- 
vided his public board into categories, so that those with special interests 
have their own areas to post messages. He's also adding a third disk drive 
that will hold a biographical disk. Now, in addition to the usual multi- 
ple-choice questionnaires, users will be able to fill in a few lines about 
themselves, in their own words, for others to read. 

Finally, many of the callers of Dial-Your-Match #19 get together 
once a month to socialize and meet each other in person. At the first 
meeting, there were actually more females than males — a unique situa- 
tion, since more than 80 percent of the date-a-base is male. 

Only the Beginning, Only Just a Start. As the popularity of modems 
grows, so do their uses. Today, it's not unusual for people to be down- 
loading stock market quotes, catalog shopping, switching on the lights at 
home from the office, or even playing Dungeons and Dragons games, all 
by modem. But finding a mate? It's unlikely that Dial-Your-Match will 
ever replace wining and dining. It is, however, a new way of finding 
someone to wine and dine. 

In addition to those who are seriously looking for others to go danc- 
ing, spend a day at the beach, or visit rust museums with, there are those 
who would just like to make a few friends to correspond with through 
the system's electronic mail. These souls need never confront the other 
person, but have only to present an image that's intriguing enough 
to pique the curiosity of anyone who's casually browsing the 
questionnaires. 

In this way, Dial-Your-Match is also a role-playing game. Just as 
Wizardry players become wizards, mages, samurais, and ninjas, intro- 
verts and extroverts can become the persons they dream of becoming — 
the Gables and Lombards of the CRT screen. Wallflowers can anony- 
mously approach members of the opposite sex and say things they're too 
shy to say in person. The quiet, bashful homebody can log on and be- 
come a young, swinging single. 

But, most of all, it's also a free service for people like Clark. Well, 
sort of.

IF YOU'RE CONFUSED 
PERSONAL COMPUTER, 



At this moment, there are no 
less than 50 personal computers 
on the market. And more are 
being introduced every day. 

On one hand, having all those 
options is a good thing. On the 
other, it can make picking the 
right one pretty difficult. 




Computers come in two parts. 
You have to buy both. 

We'd like to help. So here are a 
few suggestions about how to buy 
the computer that's right for you. 
Computers come in two parts. 

One part is the "hardware," 
which is the machinery itself. The 
other is the "software," or a pro- 
gram, as it's sometimes called. 

Software is the part that tells 
the computer what to do, the way 
a driver tells a car what to do. 

Without software, a computer 
can't do anything. 

And vice versa. 

You have to buy both. 
Buy the software first. 

Since the reason you're buying 
a computer is to get the capability 
the software gives you (remember 
it's the software that knows how 
to get things done), it makes 
good sense to pick the 
software first. 



Start by making a list of the 
things you want to use the com- 
puter for. It can include almost 
anything-any kind of inventory 
filing, accounting, graphics, 
reporting, record-keeping, 
analysis -you name it and there's 
probably a software program that 
does it. 

Next, take the list into a com- 
puter store and ask the salesper- 
son to give you a demonstration 
of the program, or programs, 
that will do the things you 
want. 

Even though you'll 
need a computer 
for the software 
demonstra 



tion, keep in mind the computer 
is just a vehicle. The software is 
the driver. And once you've 
decided on the software, picking 
out the rest of the computer sys- 
tem will be much easier. 
The simpler the better. 

Look for software that's easy to 
learn, easy to use, and that does 
the job in the simplest way 
possible. 

Good personal soft- 
ware should be, as the 
computer people say 
friendly." Meaning 
that it helps you 
do what you 
have to do 
without get- 
ting in the 
way. 





Mean- 
ing there 
are no com- 
plicated routines 
to follow to perform 
a simple task. And no 
programming 
language to learn. 
Some people, how- 
ever, will tell you that soft- 
ware has to be compli- 
cated to be powerful. 

Nothing could be far- 
ther from the truth. 
Because in order for a 
program to appear simple 
to you on the outside, it has to 
be extremely complex on 
the inside. 



ABOUT BUYING A 
HERE'S SOME HELP 



Good software keeps the com- 
plications in the computer, where 
they belong. And keeps the capa- 
bility at your fingertips. It's that 
simple. 

You simply have to see 
for yourself. 

You can read any number of 
interesting books and magazines 
about personal computers. You 
can ask friends who have them. 
You can look at all the sales litera- 
ture you can get your hands on. 
And you should do all those 
things before you decide to buy. 

But as helpful as all that can be, 
there really is no substitute for a 
real, live demonstration. 

When you do go out shopping, 
we recommend you take a look at 
the PFS® Family of Software. 

The PFS family is designed the 
way we think all software should 
be: simple, straightforward and 
powerful. 

Currently three products 
make up the family. PFS:FILE, 
PFS:REPORT andPFS:GRAPH, 
with more programs on the way. 
Here's a little more about each 
of them. 

PFS:FILE. The simplest way 
to get organized. 

Basically, FILE works like a 
paper filing system, without the 
paper. So you can record, file, 
retrieve and review information in 
a fraction of the time it takes with 
a conventional filing system. 

FILE lets you arrange your 
information in "forms" you design 
yourself. So you can get at and 
really use your information in 
ways never before possible. 

What's more, FILE lets you 
change the original form without 
having to redo the information on it. 



PFS:REPORT. Making the most 
of your information. 

REPORT summarizes the 
information on your forms so you 
can use it to analyze, plan and 
make better-informed decisions. 

With REPORT, you get presen- 
tation-quality reports-sorted, cal- 
culated, formatted and printed- 
automatically in seconds. 
PFS:GRAPH. Instant pictures. 

GRAPH gives you presentation 
quality bar charts, line graphs, 
and pie charts, in black and white 
or color, on paper or the com- 
puter screen. To get a clearer 
picture of things and spot trends 
instantly, you simply enter your 
information and specify the kind 
of graph or chart you want. 
GRAPH does the rest. 

You can also mix and match 
line and bar graphs, or even stack 
or compare up to four bar graphs 
simultaneously. 

And GRAPH will work with 
PFS:FILE, VisiCalc® files, or data 
entered directly into the 
computer. 

Best of all, compared to the 
cost of hand-drawn graphics, 
GRAPH can save you enough 
money over the course of a few 
months to pay for the computer it 
runs on.

FEBRUARY 1983 



SOETAI V 



173 



BV JONATHAN MILLER 



The California desert hasn't always been hospitable to pioneers, but 
on April 14, 1981, it proved a welcome sight to the pilots of America's 
first space shuttle, Columbia. 

Thousands of spectators were gathered at Edwards Air Force Base 
northwest of Los Angeles to witness the historic occasion. A smooth 
touchdown was anticipated, but this launching had already had its prob- 
lems. Two technicians had died in an accident at the launch site the pre- 
vious month, and seventeen heat-shielding tiles had parted company with 
the spacecraft's outer skin sometime during liftoff. The missing tiles were 
said to be in noncritical areas, but seeing would be believing for the keen 
eyes now scanning the cloudless desert skies. 

Here was a genuine media event, and the fourth estate was out in 
force — radio, local television, the networks, and the new kid on the 
block, upstart cable. Rolling in with their big guns and minicams and 
two-ways, they'd turned this desolate corner of the Mojave Desert into a 
gigantic broadcasting booth. The electronic media had come to report 
the news, but at least one piece of their equipment came close to making 
some: It threatened, if only briefly, to interfere with the landing. 

Interference on a Touchdown Pass. "People in the audience 
shouldn't be conscious of what's going on backstage," says Richard 
Rudman, a radio engineer who worked with federal trouble-shooters to 
locate a "spurious" transmitter emission that was interfering with the 
Columbia's touchdown guidance system. "It should just happen. The 
trouble is, we're in a period when we've got to make people in broad- 
casting and government more aware of what's happening backstage or 
the show won't go on." 

Rudman, the engineering manager for all-news KFWB radio in Los 
Angeles, is a prime mover in the backstage education movement. He is a 
founding member of the Southern California Frequency Coordinating 
Committee, a pioneering ad hoc group established in 1976 to keep some 
two hundred broadcasters from Fresno to the Mexican border literally 
"on the beam." 

The problem with doing that, according to Rudman, stems from the 
fact that the airwaves are getting crowded. The information explosion 
has put additional demands on the limited resource of radio frequencies, 
as broadcasters, dispatchers, and paging services rub elbows in the elec- 
tromagnetic nether world. 

"Future shock has entered the media," Rudman says. "We feel com- 
pelled to bring things to people almost before they happen." For news 
organizations, that means expanded coverage. More remotes. More two- 
way channels for reporters in the field. More minicams on microwaves 
bringing pictures at the scene live at eleven. More potential, in short, for 
conflict. 

"I've seen situations where people have almost come to blows over 
this," confides Rudman, tactfully declining to name names. "It's a classic 
traffic situation, with no traffic lights and two people on the same street, 
on the same lane, coming at each other. We're living on the cutting edge 
of grief and technology." 

Southern California, the trendy megalopolis with the quaking edge 
running down its ocean side, simply became the first to do something 
about the problem, says Rudman. With a rapidly growing broadcast 
market and peculiar terrain features that play havoc with signals, it be- 
came obvious that the better part of self-interest was talk, not fight. If 
people were talking and knew what was out there, there'd be less cause 
for conflict. 

Which is why the committee was up at Edwards prior to touch- 
down, working with representatives from the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, and 
the Air Force. NASA had detected the spurious emission, the spooky 
signal that was spurting from a transmitter like a leak from a punctured 
hose. It was a matter that required swift locating and diplomatic han- 
dling. NASA's first mission was to get the astronauts home safely; its sec- 
ond was to sell its space program via the media. 

Rounding Third and Heading for Home. "You're faced with a situa- 
tion of walking up to somebody and saying, 'Hey, this thing you're using 
to fulfill your station's needs is causing interference and you have to shut 
it off,' " Rudman explains. At Edwards, such a confrontation was 



avoided because the offending party wasn't a person but a piece of faulty 
equipment. 

The solution was simple: replace the equipment. But the potential for 
hard feelings is always there, stresses Rudman, particularly in the imme- 
diate Los Angeles area where there are 80 available channels and 120 
users. The trick when any two are on a collision course is to get them 
talking, but that's a skill that calls for some reeducation. "People today 
almost have to be shown how to communicate," says Rudman. 

Facilitating communication has, in fact, become an increasing part of 
Dick Rudman'sjob, or rather, jobs. First of all, there's the station, whose 
slogan is "All news, all the time." He's got to make sure the station's on 
the air all the time to deliver the news to its million weekly listeners. That 
means maintaining the studio, the transmitter, the two-way radio units in 
the reporter vehicle fleet, and just being an all-around Mr. Fix-It for the 
sprawling building, a one-story former supermarket squatting a stone's 
throw from the world's most overrated intersection, Hollywood and 
Vine. 

Fact is, Dick Rudman has his share of responsibilities, both inside 
and outside. There's the management of a half-million dollars in budget 
lines, overseeing a staff of eleven, consulting for the Satellite News Chan- 
nels launched by parent company Westinghouse, plus all this committee 
work. Rudman did such a good job promoting the pioneering efforts of 
the California Committee, guess who the Society of Broadcast Engi- 
neers turned to last year to chair a national committee promoting same? 

Who Will Manage My Wonderful Morass? The reward for good 
work was more work, and Dick Rudman began to see himself sinking 
ever deeper into a morass of correspondence. Technical reports, camera- 
ready articles for trade magazines, letters to the National Association of 
Broadcasters, the FCC, equipment manufacturers — just the kind of 
gritty work he didn't need with a secretary out on disability. 

What he did need, he finally concluded, was his own personal man- 
agement system — an Apple, spreadsheet, filing system, and word 
processor. 

So in September of 1982, he went for it — an Apple, VisiCalc, PFS, 
and Format II. He was buying into the standard package, but he shied 
away from CP/M-based WordStar after trying it. He felt that what it 
promised in power it sacrificed in an elaborate command structure. 
What he was looking for was something that was reliable and friendly, 
that would welcome him back after a business trip. 

"I may be away from the office and my Apple for two weeks at a 
time," Rudman explains. "I don't want to have to take a refresher course 
on my word processor because I forgot a lot of prompts for a whole 
bunch of control characters." Software should be written to protect him 
from himself, from his own bad habits as a typist and writer, he rea- 
soned. "It's an imposition if I have to learn another language to do 
my job." 

What he finally decided on was Format II, a menu-driven word proc- 
essor distributed by Kensington Microware of New York. The program 
lists for $250 and requires an eighty-column card. Rudman had been 
favorably impressed by a demonstration he'd seen of it, so now that he 
needed an electronic amanuensis he took the proverbial plunge. For a 
while, though, it seemed as if he'd dived into the shallow end of the pool. 

Rudman discovered that he had two printer problems, both of which 
were related to running the program off a serial printer. To begin with, 
he was unable to get his Apple and Comrex printer to interface with the 
Format IPs 2K buffer. It seems that the printer couldn't tell the Apple, 
through the serial card, when it was full. In addition, Rudman didn't 
seem to be able to use Format /f s underlining routine. 

The solutions were amicable, if involved. Rudman swapped serial 
card and printer for parallel card and printer with the computer store 
that sold him the package. He then reconfigured his system. Now the 
program overcame the shortcomings of the printer underline routine by 
telling it to reverse line feed and then underline as a separate line. 

Flexing Format II. Rudman regards his printer misadventures as 
inevitable in the Model T age of computerdom, particularly with rela- 
tively new products such as Format II and his Comrex printer. The best 
one can hope for are supportive dealers and flexible programs that 



174 m S O E T A L K FEBRUARY 1983 



circumvent incompatibilities in hardware and software. "I was really 
amazed with this piece of software, that it had the versatility, the power 
to write an underlining routine that would work with the Comrex." 

Rudman also discovered a glitch in Format II. Having dutifully saved 
his first batch of letters, he asked to see a listing, only to be rudely in- 
formed that his floppy wasn't a text disk. "I was on the verge of throw- 
ing up my hands in disgust," he recalls. He chose instead to call the ven- 
dor, and Kensington promptly sent him two new disks to replace the 
master and backup that come standard with the package, explaining by 
the by that they'd had a bad run of duplicating. 

Since then, Rudman has had no problems with Format II. "I haven't 
been able to stump this on anything yet," he reports. "It's done every- 
thing a nontypist could ask for." In short, the program is living up to ad- 
vertised claims of being easy to use and format flexible in the what-you- 
see-is-what-you-get mode, but Rudman insists that his satisfaction 
should not be taken as a blanket endorsement. "I'm not selling this soft- 
ware. It has its beauty. It has its elegance and uses, but it is not the ul- 
timate word processor." 

On the plus side of ultimate, there is an impressive array of single- 
stroke formatting commands. The majority are logically mnemonic, like 
C for center and D for delete, but others take some remembering. These 
latter worthies include such useful if less self-evident commands as T for 
removing right justification and G for transferring text to an eighty-line 
buffer — for placement elsewhere in a document or within another 
document. 

Other features that endear the program to Rudman include a built-in 
mailing list that can be used for database management, proportional 
spacing and microspace justification that enable him to produce camera- 
ready magazine copy, and some thirty text editing commands that make 
it easy for him to customize correspondence. 

Scream of the Typo. Format //'s principal virtue is as generic to the 
process as it is to the program. Word processing and Format II have im- 
proved Rudman's writing both in thought and deed. Typos he doesn't 
catch on the screen shout out at him when he proofs a rough printout. 

Rudman is not oblivious to Format Ifs flaws. Its principal shortcom- 
ing, in his view, is that you can store only seventeen legal-size pages on a 
disk (or thirty-four if you have two drives, as he does). That hasn't posed 
a problem for him as yet, but that's only because he tries to keep his busi- 
ness correspondence short and sweet. 

"If you can't say it in a page, it probably isn't worth saying," he 
offers, quoting some journalistic maxim he picked up at Penn State. "On 
the other hand, if I were writing a book on, say, The Decline and Fall of 
Broadcasting that went on for nine hundred pages, that's a lot of disks." 

If he had his druthers, Rudman would prefer a Format II that 
enabled him to create word glossaries that give page references. "Format 
II allows me to do forms printing easily," he notes, "but I can't take a 
total off that form, except by writing it down on a piece of paper and sav- 
ing it." The package does allow users to swap files with other programs, 
he allows, but it takes some finagling with a utility disk. 

Rudman offers these last remarks in the spirit of friendly advice to 
the software industry. What's needed are easier to use, more compatible 
pieces of software. 

"If the people at Format II don't come up with something that lets 
the program talk easily to a spreadsheet or become a spreadsheet and do 
filing, then I'll go to another piece of software. All this investment in 
Format II, VLsiCalc, and PFS means nothing if you can't grow with it 
and it can't grow with you." 

What Not To Do with Your Finger.Career turning points are usually 
hard to fix, but Richard Rudman remembers his with the shock of 
recognition. He and his brother were crawling around on a rug in the 
family's Boston home when young Richard got a bright idea. "I stuck a 
finger in an electrical socket," he jokes, "and I've been fascinated with 
the stuff ever since." 

As a teenager that romance took wavelike form on both sea and air, 
with Hardy boy Richard earning certification as both an outboard motor 
mechanic and a ham radio operator (and later, as an adult, as a pilot). In 
1961, Rudman entered a cooperative work study program at North 
Eastern University in Boston with vague notions of becoming a techni- 
cal writer, but he quickly gravitated toward broadcasting. A very logical 



progression: a work study job in the electrical engineering department, a 
stint as the chief engineer for the school radio station, a summer job with 
Westinghouse station WBZ in Boston, and a teaching assistant position 
in the Penn State television department while working on the master's 
degree in journalism. Very logical indeed, only Rudman didn't get the 
thesis. 

Love and fate intervened. Rudman met a lady and got married. He 
also lost his thesis when burglars made off with his notes on the political, 
economic, and social aspects of radio frequency allocation. 

So what if he didn't have a journalism degree, he concluded; maybe 
his technical experience could get him into the production end of broad- 
casting. "I always felt I could become a radio engineer without the 
degree," Rudman recalls. "Radio is still an industry where it's possible to 
get a job with what you know and what you've done. I can sit down with 
a book on a new discipline and teach myself. If it's explained clearly, I 
can figure it out, and, if it's not, I can usually still figure it out." 

So, figuring it out, Rudman put in his apprenticeships at WBZ in 
Boston, Massachusetts; KAYN in Tucson, Arizona; and KGB in San 
Diego, California; before moving on up to KFWB in 1975. The unpre- 
dictability of news suddenly added an exciting new dimension to a career 
dominated by automated and semiautomated music formats. Dick Rud- 
man now found himself planning for the L.A. Unthinkable — the great 
quake everyone knows is coming but hardly anybody worries about, ex- 
cept possibly engineering managers for all-news radio stations who want 
their call letters to shine in the darkest of hours. 

"This is a behind-the-scenes story that is of vital importance to Los 
Angeles and the station," says Rudman, who likens KFWB to a kind of 
public utility or resource. "The first thing that's going to go in an earth- 
quake are the telephone lines, so for KFWB one of my goals has been to 
set up a two-way radio system that bypasses Pacific Telephone. We feel 
that the station has to be able to serve the listeners and do everything 
possible to survive a quake." 

This means maintaining emergency generators for the studio and 
5,000-watt transmitter, constantly improving two-way radio communica- 
tion between field reporters and news directors, and covering the sta- 
tion's exposed frequency flank by being active in regional coordinating 
activities. It makes stellar sense by Rudman's lights. If broadcasters 
know you're out there, they're not as likely to encroach on your turf. 

Beat the Apple. Rudman surveys KFWB turf from an office that 
looks out on a colorful and spacious newsroom, one Rudman takes 
pride in having helped design. What's most striking about this engineer's 
window on the world is the lighting: there hardly is any. When forty- 
year-old Richard Rudman walks in every morning, he doesn't hit the 
light switch, he hits his Apple. The principal sources of illumination are a 
sliding glass door leading to the newsroom and the cool, efficient glow of 
his Apple, its Format II booted up, its cursor dutifully pulsing. 

Rudman takes a lot of good-natured ribbing about living in a glass 
cave, but he rather likes the detached feel. He can lean back in his man- 
agerial chair, sip steaming coffee, and get focused on the big picture. 
Framed by his wall-length glass door is the incandescent image of the 
newsroom, rimmed by state-of-the-art studios and patterned on those 
vast newspaper city rooms. Two images dominate — a news director who 
makes his rapid-fire decisions standing in the center of a large semicircle 
otherwise known as a slot, and a rumpled, harried newswriter off in a 
corner doing a John Garfield imitation, cigarette dangling and fingers 
pecking away on a old manual typewriter. 

Time marches on. Like every other industry, broadcasting is playing 
catch-up. Dedicated word processors have been in the works for some 
time at KFWB, says Rudman, but were sidetracked two years ago when 
parent company Westinghouse absorbed Teleprompter to become the 
third largest cable company in the country. "It was like a gnat swallow- 
ing an elephant," says Rudman, an audio specialist who spent the bet- 
ter part of last spring helping Westinghouse launch Satellite News 
Channels. 

All this consulting, not to mention coordinating, has increased Rud- 
man's workload, but he couldn't be happier with the variety. "It seems 
every time I might go stale, they throw a new challenge at me." 

Which is pretty much how it is with the broadcast business in gen- 
eral, where technology keeps the pot of innovation boiling. Advances in

design are enabling engineers to split channels and to meet ever-increas- 
ing demand, while frequency-coordinating committees like Rudman's 
are finding better ways to manage a limited resource through the far 
more complicated business of human communication. 

"You have to look into the semantic content of everything you say 
and do," says Rudman, a devotee of S. I. Hayakawa's Language in 
Thought and Action. "Whatever your perceptions are, they only ap- 
proach reality as a limit. The thought is not the action, the map not the 
territory. You have to keep that in mind, and word processing helps me 
do that." 



Fascinating Fun. What all this comes down to, of course, is that 
Rudman finds fascination in his job. He's doing what he wants and he's 
having fun in the process. 

"Radio is my life," Rudman says. "Broadcasting, like computing, 
started out as a hobby and now it's a business; but the people I respect 
most are the ones who would work in it even if they weren't paid as 
much just because it's in their blood. 

"The master's degree wasn't important to me. It was more impor- 
tant to accumulate experience and do things to get where I could make a 
difference. I like to think it's coming true to an extent now." Hi

column card. Compatible cards include Computer Stop Omnivision, 
M&R Sup'R'Term, A.L.S. Smarterm, Vista Vision 80, or Videx Vid- 
eoterm (after installation of the chip provided in the Format II package). 
A keyboard modification for lower case is also required; the necessary 
materials and instructions are provided as part of the package. 
Optional: a 16K RAM card. Some, though not many, of the advanced 
text movement functions require this extra capacity. The program is also 
compatible with the Enhancer II from Videx. 

Today's Format. This is a very powerful word processor. One of its 
major strengths lies in the fact that you can see what the pages of a docu- 
ment will look like before you print it. Even such things as underlining, 
right justification, and page breaks are shown. 

Most of Format ITs commands are easy to use and easy to remem- 
ber. The delete command typifies this arrangement. To delete some- 
thing, you just press control-D and the program asks you what you want 
to delete. 

The program is menu-driven. It opens by presenting you with a wide 
variety of menu choices. To select an option, you simply type its first 
letter. 

For several months before its release, Format II was tested in actual 
settings. It's readily apparent that the resulting product profited from 
this; it's not only thorough, but quite user- friendly. 

One of the striking differences between Format II and other word 
processing programs is the way it handles the creation of a document. 
Instead of saving a "document," it saves "pages." Each page is given a 
name — often, it's a good idea to give each page the same family name, 
followed by a number to distinguish it from other pages in the same 
document. This arrangement may sound cumbersome, but, as it turns 
out, it presents no problems in the printing of a lengthy document and is, 
in fact, rather flexible. 

Up to seventeen pages of text can be stored on a single floppy disk. 
It's important to realize that the number of "pages" you store may not 
correspond exactly to the number of printed pages you have in your final 
document. When you're ready to print out your entire document, you 
specify what the characteristics of a page will be. This means that you 
may end up with more or fewer pages than you have "in storage." 

During the page correction process, you're asked to specify how 
many lines there will be on a given page. This number can be different for 
each page and can even be changed as you're in the process of creating a 
document. If there's not enough room on your newly created page to fit 
all the material you want to include, you can either redefine the length of 
that page or allow the extra material to go into an "overflow" area for 
later retrieval. 

When you're entering information onto a page, the top left-hand 
corner of the screen displays a line counter and a position counter. The 
line counter tells you what line of the page you're currently printing on 
and how many lines remain on that page. The position counter tells you 
what column you're currently typing in as you move across the page. 
You're also shown (by means of short vertical lines) where the right 
margin is currently located. Of course, this margin can be altered to suit 
your needs. 

As you'd expect, the word wrap feature is a standard part of this 
package. There is, however, another useful feature you might not expect 
to see — hyphenation. Since word wrap can't cope sensibly with certain 
situations, you sometimes get a line in text that has big gaps or holes in it. 
This will happen, for example, if the last word on a line is a very long one 
that had to be placed entirely on the line that follows. In cases like this,

Format II automatically hyphenates the word for you as best it can. You 
can also, of course, insert the hyphen yourself. Hyphenation can be a very 
important consideration in many word processing applications; it should 
not be overlooked. 

Format II allows you to edit your text extensively by means of logi- 
cal, easy to use commands. Pressing escape puts you in the edit mode. 
From there, you can correct mistakes, add and delete text, and move text 
around on a single page or from one page to another. Few word 
processing packages offer as many editing commands as this program 
does. Table 1 contains examples of a few of the single-keystroke com- 
mands that are available. 

The large character buffer that's provided also facilitates the editing 
process. If there's a certain phrase or paragraph that you use often 
throughout a document, you can place it in the buffer and recall it as 
needed with a single keystroke. In addition, you can use the buffer to 
move text around on a page or from one page to another in a document. 

At print time, you can print the page that's currently in main 
memory, and/or you can print any of the pages you've stored on 
additional disks. Format II will ask you how you wish to set up your 
document (how many lines per page, and so on) and how many copies of 
it you'd like to have. You can print various combinations of stored pages 
in whatever sequence you choose. This is particularly handy in profes- 
sional situations that require some pages of a document to be the same 
while others must be customized. 

Format II also has a mailing list feature as a standard part of the 
package. You can print mailing labels or merge lists of names and ad- 



dresses with a letter or document you've created. In fact, you can make 
selections from your list prior to printing. Thus, you could choose to 
merge only the names on a list that fit particular criteria. You could, for 
example, include only those people who come from a particular town or 
only those whose job category is "programmer." The system allows for a 
variety of logical tests (such as and, or, and not). 

Incidentally, the program also has the ability to send printer codes to 
your particular printer. Headers and footers can be included on each 
page, and superscripts and subscripts can be included in your docu- 
ments. Proportional spacing is also available. The user guide also 
includes a discussion of how to transmit Format II documents over a 
modem. 

And, speaking of the user guide, it certainly rates as among the best 
around in terms of the clarity of the writing. It's well organized, well 
indexed, and thorough. In addition to an introductory level (but very 
helpful) tutorial, the manual provides more definitive information in a 
reference guide format. 

The only drawback is the same one that seems to plague the manuals 
for most of the programs we've been examining. The Format II manual 
could be more attractive and easier to read. The type size is small and the 
illustrations are crowded together. Better paper and formatting would 
have improved the manual's appearance. 

Make no mistake — the content here is excellent. But the quality of 
the product could have been improved if the manual had been more 
professional looking. Indeed, this would have affected the cost of the 
package, but it would also have made the reading much more palatable. 
With complex and thorough products of this type, such a concession to 
the reader is almost a requirement. 

Format II rates among the leading word processing packages. It's 
easy to learn to use, thorough, and well tested. The menu-driven format 
is extremely convenient, the single-keystroke commands are simple and 
appropriate, and the manual is well organized and well written. It's 
important to remember, of course, that you must be sure to have the ap- 
propriate hardware installed in your Apple before you can use this 
package.

Mind Your 





BY PETER OLIYIEkl 




We usually start out by sharing with you some comment on the 
weather or the season, both of which we have plenty of here in New Eng- 
land. We won't do that this time, because there's not much you can say 
about February except that, in some parts of the country, it's awfully 
cold. In its defense, many people would point out that February is, 
after all, the shortest month of the year. And, of course, if you're roman- 
tic, Valentine's Day may well induce a special feeling for this particular 
month. So, as you can see, there isn't anything to say about this month 
this month, so we'll start right out with "minding our business." 

Three Spree. As mentioned last time, a portion of each month's col- 
umn will be devoted to a discussion of the Apple III and its applications. 
More and more software is becoming available for the III. Many soft- 
ware vendors like using its operating system (SOS) and have designed 
packages that take advantage of it and of the machine's special charac- 
teristics. 

In addition, Apple III users have begun getting in touch to share their 
experiences; some of their comments appear later on in the column. 

Apple Computer offers a good many packages for use with the Ap- 
ple III, including VisiCalc III, Apple Writer III, and the Apple III Mail 
List Manager. Let's look at these programs now. 

VisiCalc III. This spreadsheet program is essentially the same as the 



VisiCalc we all know and love, except that it requires an Apple with at 
least 96K of memory. The extra memory allows users to work with more 
data and increases processing speed. Other than that, the main differ- 
ence between the Apple II and Apple III versions of VisiCalc is the ease 
with which the version for the III can be used. Some of this facility is di- 
rectly related to the design of the Apple III keyboard. For instance, the 
Ill's up and down arrows preclude the need to press the space bar for di- 
rectional changes. 

The VisiCalc III manuals from VisiCorp are among the better Visi- 
Calc manuals we've seen. The documentation also includes three helpful 
program listings — one for printing out DIF files, one for printing out 
worksheets from DIF files, and a third for creating DIF files. 

What's the DIF? Since the subject has come up, it seems appropri- 
ate here to describe briefly what the heck a DIF file is. 

DIF stands for Data Interchange Format. This method was de- 
veloped as a way of storing data for use by other programs. Having a 
standard way of saving data would mean that programs offered by one 
vendor could be made to talk to programs available from another ven- 
dor (or to programs written by users themselves). If such a format could 
be standardized, the development of applications packages would be fa- 
cilitated and there would be significant advantages to the user. 

Thus, since VisiCalc allows you to save your worksheet in DIF for- 
mat, you can use your worksheet data as input to any other programs 
that recognize DIF files. It's possible, for example, to take a DIF file 
you've created using VisiCalc and use it as input to the Apple Business 
Graphics package. In this manner, you can generate graphs and charts of 
the data on your spreadsheet. 

Apple Writer III. As you know, Apple Writer III is Apple Comput- 
er's word processing program for the Apple III. You can use it to create, 
modify, and print text, and it even includes a list processing feature as a 
standard part of the package. Here are some comments from readers 
who use the program. 

J. Kastura of Kokomo, Indiana, likes Apple Writer III very much but 
hopes to get a solution to a problem he's been having with the program. 

"Apple Writer III is very useful," writes Kastura, "and is, in general, 
well documented. . . . The lack of a user guide is an inconvenience. In or- 
der to get full use of the Epson MX-80 printer, a null character must be 
transmitted to the printer. Apple Writer has a feature that allows the user 
to embed control characters in the text for the purpose of controlling a 
printer; however, I have not found any way to do this. Has anyone had a 
similar problem? Are there any solutions?" 

And from J. Schnell of West Olive, Michigan, who uses Apple Writer 
III in writing architectural specifications for architects, come these com- 
ments. 

"We use four Apple Ills, each with an Apple III green monitor, one 
additional disk drive, and an Epson MX- 100/3 printer. . . . We find Apple 
Writer III to be extraordinarily flexible. However, it does have one ma- 
jor drawback. The user doesn't see on the screen exactly what will be 
printed. We would also like to have the ability to move around larger 
blocks of text than are currently permitted. The format for using the pro- 
gram is quite easy, however, and should be considered a strong plus. We 
will never, never go back to using a typewriter. 

"Our only problem," continues Schnell, "has to do with the use of the 
printer. Using Basic, we've been able to use all the features of our Epson 
printers. However, we have not been able to find any way of printing su-

perscripts when using Apple Writer III. Has anyone been able to do 
this?" 

W. Hale of San Diego, California, writes in to say that the Apple III 
(and Apple Writer III) is used in an engineering design section at the 
Military Electronics Division of TRW Corporation. 

"Apple Writer III works quite well for us and we are pleased with it. 
We have found the documentation lacking in some areas, particularly in 
the relationships between the top and bottom entries, top and bottom 
margins, and what effect these have on the number of printed lines and 
page intervals." Hale identifies "the inability to see on the screen what 
the document is going to look like" as the "single, most complained- 
about problem." This is particularly inconvenient, he adds, when wide 
and complex page layouts are being dealt with. 

Apple III Mail List Manager. This is one of the easiest to use mail- 
ing list packages we've seen. It requires a minimum of 128K memory and 
at least one external disk drive. 

A disk can hold a maximum of 960 records. If you want to create 
new mailing lists by merging records stored on different disks, you need 
at least two external disk drives. The program comes equipped to print 
labels using a Qume Sprint 5 or a Silentype III. If you plan to use a dif- 
ferent printer, you'll have to have your system disk modified by your 
dealer. 

The program is menu-driven and allows you to define your mailing 
format; enter mailing records; find, modify, or delete mailing records; 
sort mailing records; print or display mailing records; change the format 
of the labels to be printed; and merge or filter mailing lists. 

A mailing list record can, essentially, contain up to six lines of infor- 
mation. These typically include one line apiece for name, company, 
street, and city/ state/zip code. Two extra lines are provided. The user in- 
dicates what fields of this record are to be the sort fields (a person's name 
or zip code, for example). In addition, there's a field for phone numbers 
and one for label codes. These codes can be of your design, and you can 
use them later on when you want to retrieve only certain records from 
the file. This feature is a very convenient one for many list processing ap- 
plications. The user guide devotes several pages to an explanation of how 
to use such codes in a mailing list setting. 



Searching through the mailing list database can be done in four ways. 
You can search through all records for a record that matches the char- 
acters you've just entered in the primary sort field, search for a similar- 
sounding primary sort field (an unusual, and nice, feature), search for a 
match of the characters you've just entered in the secondary sort field, 
and search by mailing list order (search sequentially). 

The Mail List Manager user guide is quite good. It's easy to under- 
stand and clearly explains all the package features. If you have an appli- 
cation that requires you to produce mailing labels, it would be worth- 
while to consider this package seriously. Be advised, however, that if 
your needs include the addressing and printing of personalized letters us- 
ing your mailing list file then it may be in your best interests to consider 
a database management package that includes list processing as one of its 
features. 

Graphics, Anyone? In last month's column, we discussed a package 
called Apple II Business Graphics. As you'll recall, this package gives Ap- 
ple II users the capability to create fairly sophisticated bar charts, pie dia- 
grams, and line graphs. In addition, it's easy to use and has excellent 
documentation. 

Well, the same package is available for the Apple III. It's called, 
uniquely enough, Apple III Business Graphics and offers all the features 
described for the Apple II version. Of course, some of the ways the user 
interfaces with the program have changed; in particular, the ways that 
files are handled are different. Apple III Business Graphics requires an 
Apple III with two disk drives and 128K of memory. In addition, the use 
of the ProFile hard disk drive is possible, although some reconfiguring 
work must be done first. 

Apple Printers Arrive. Apple Computer recently announced the 
availability of two Apple printers. Both are designed to use fully the fea- 
tures of the Apple II and the Apple III and the majority of software 
packages available for them. 

The Apple Dot Matrix Printer is a fast, high-contrast printer for 
graphics and many correspondence-quality applications. The printer re- 
quires a parallel interface, has a printhead life of more than one hundred 
million characters, and comes with a heavy-duty motor. It has hi-res 
graphics output and offers bidirectional print speed of 120 characters per

We have the perfect way to 
breeze through the most 
dreaded task of the year. 
And you can do it on your 
computer — even if you're a 
complete novice. 

It's called The Tax 
Advantage™ It's fast and 
it's a cinch to use. 

The program takes you 
line-by-line through Form 1040 and the other most 
common tax forms. It asks you for information in plain 
English, and you type in the numbers.That's all there 
is to it. 

The Tax Advantage™ does complex operations like 
income averaging with a few simple commands. Not 
only that, but as tax laws change, you can easily update 
the tax tables. 

Another terrific feature is that it automatically com- 
putes your taxes with each entry you make. So you 
know exactly how each line affects your overall tax 
picture. 

Pick up The Tax Advan- 
tage™ Simply stated, it's the 
best way to do your taxes. 

But hurry. April's almost 
here. 

The Tax Advantage™ is 
available for the Apple II and 
Atari 400/800. Price $59.95.

second. The printer permits multiple pitch and proportional spacing, and 
it will mix fonts during a single pass. In addition, it can handle cut sheets 
or tractor-fed paper (either roll or fan folded). The Dot Matrix Printer is 
priced at around seven hundred dollars. 

The Apple Letter Quality Printer, a daisy wheel printer with graph- 
ics capability, is designed for high-quality print applications. It requires a 
serial interface and prints bidirectionally at forty characters per second 
on individual sheets or continuous forms. Its switch-selectable settings in- 
clude vertical and horizontal tabs; six or eight lines per inch vertical 
pitch; ten, twelve, or fifteen characters per inch horizontal pitch; and au- 
to line feed toggle. Pause and form feed user switches simplify printer 
control. The snap-in multistrike ribbon cartridge is designed to provide 
four times the life of conventional ribbons, and a full complement of 
print wheels, including six foreign language character sets, will be avail- 
able later on. The price of the letter quality printer is about twenty-two 
hundred dollars. 

Revised Dow Jones Software. An enhanced version of the Dow 
Jones News and Quotes Reporter offers Apple II owners who are in- 
vestors instant access to vital financial and business information through 
fifteen research databases. This revised software supports eighty-column 
displays and autodial modems. It also allows users to log on to Tymnet, 
Telenet, and the Canadian Bell System's Datapac, three major commu- 
nications networks. 

This package gives stockbrokers, financial analysts, and private in- 
vestors access to one of the world's most comprehensive sources of busi- 
ness information. With it, interested parties can obtain quotes (delayed 
fifteen minutes) from the major United States stock exchanges; head- 
lines, abstracts, and complete articles from the Dow Jones News Wire, 
The Wall Street Journal, and Barronsr, and transcripts of the television 
show Wall Street Week. It's also possible to get information from mon- 
ey market services that summarize where experts expect the money mar- 
kets to go; obtain Weekly Economic Update, a summary of key eco- 
nomic events of the week; access databases that provide historical stock 
market quotes, historical information on a particular company, or de- 
tailed financial data on thousands of companies; and get a variety of 
other information such as sporting news, UPI news, and news of inter- 
national events. The package also offers access to a twenty-volume ency- 
clopedia. 

The Dow Jones News and Quotes Reporter (Version 2.0) requires an 
Apple II with 48K of memory and an acoustic modem with a communi- 
cations or serial card or a Hayes Micromodem II. This version features 
automatic logging on. The package is priced at $135 and includes the 
software, two user manuals, a Dow Jones password, and one hour of free 
time on the system during nonpeak periods. If you own the previous ver- 
sion of the package, you can get the new one for $40 by returning your 
original to your dealer. 

These Are Taxing Times. Friends, it's that time of year again. Yes, it 
is time that we give to Caesar what is ours, or rather, to Uncle Sam what 
is his. Every Apple owner would do well to be aware of the advantages of 
owning an Apple when tax time rolls around. 

If you're using your Apple in your business, you already know about 
using the investment tax credit to reduce your liability, and you know 
how best to depreciate your equipment. Pros and novices alike may find 
that it pays to look carefully at their tax guides or consult a professional 
about the IRS rules concerning computers. 

Many users don't realize that significant tax deductions can now be 
taken for software. If you develop any of your own programs, the cost 
associated with that activity may be deductible on a current-cost basis. 
If you've purchased software for use in your business, its cost is also de- 
ductible. However, that cost must be depreciated or amortized in the 
usual way. It's good to remember, too, that there's a gray area concern- 
ing software developed outside of a business organization. If you can 
demonstrate that you bear the risks involved in maintaining the soft- 
ware's operability, then the IRS may allow you to deduct its cost on a 
current basis. 

If you don't use your computer in any business activities, don't de- 
spair. While the IRS doesn't permit you to deduct the cost of a hobby, 
you may be able to deduct a portion of the cost of your computer as an 
educational expense or a part-time business expense. 



FEBRUARY 1983 



183 



Your machine qualifies as a business expense if it is used to generate 
income on a part-time basis. It is then part of the cost of doing such busi- 
ness and is therefore deductible as a business expense. You'll have to cal- 
culate what percentage of the time the computer is being used in such ac- 
tivities, since only that percentage of the machine's cost will be de- 
ductible. 

The computer can be deducted as an educational expense if you can 
demonstrate that you use it in order to meet the requirements of your 
employer to maintain your salary or job. Don't give up on this area. If 
you use the computer to improve your skills, that may also qualify you to 
take a deduction. The best strategy is to review the requirements for edu- 
cational deductions carefully; you may find that the computer qualifies in 
a variety of ways. And the time you spend getting more information may 
indeed save you a good deal of money. 

If you do deduct a portion of the expenses associated with your Ap- 
ple, be sure to attach to your tax form a short note that explains your jus- 
tifications. This extra step shows that some thought was given to the 
process before such a deduction was taken, and this often makes the dif- 
ference between being audited and not being audited. As an extra hedge, 
try to maintain some records of how you used the machine during the 
year. In a pinch, these may be just what's needed to swing a deduction in 
your favor. 

One final comment. When in doubt, consult a professional. While 
you may not necessarily go to jail for a mistake, it could cost you dearly in 
taxes and penalties. Of course, if you did go to jail, it just might provide 
you with the time you always wanted for getting familiar with your Ap- 
ple! You decide. 

Books for B.U.G.s. Several books that have been released recently 
may be of interest to some of the members of the Business User Group. 
Two of the new books are from Apple Computer. 

The Personal Guide to Personal Computers by Peter Lundstrom in- 
troduces readers to personal computers and their use in the home. The 
book costs around $2 and contains about fifty pages. It explains, in easy- 
to-understand terms, how personal computers are used, how they work, 
and how to select one. 

Perhaps of even greater interest to some of you is a book by Barbara 



Gibson called Personal Computers in Business. This fifty-page book in- 
troduces managers, professionals, and owners of small businesses to the 
use of the small business computer as a business tool. It is filled with in- 
formation about how business computers are used in the office, how they 
work, how to plan for their installation, how to evaluate different sys- 
tems, and how to estimate costs. It sells for $2.95. 

Both of these books are nicely produced, informative, and easy to 
read. They are also, obviously, biased toward the Apple and written for 
the beginner. They are far less of a "how-to" of persona! and small com- 
puters and much more of an introduction to them. 

While we're on the subject of books, here's one that is likely to be of 
particular interest to someone who's considering the use of a computer in 
a business. It's called So You Are Thinking About a Small Business Com- 
puter. Priced at $10.95, it's written by R. G. Canning and N. C. Leeper 
and published by Prentice- Hall. This is a very nice sourcebook of mate- 
rial that merits the consideration of people who are thinking about com- 
puterization. It is, of course, well written and easy to read (or it would 
never have made it to this column). 

The first few chapters are the standard ones and include sections ti- 
tled "How a Computer Can Help You," "How Computers Work," and 
"All About Hardware and Software." What distinguishes this book is 
the depth of coverage and the timeliness of the material. The text ex- 
plains the differences between eight-bit and sixteen-bit processors quite 
nicely. Moreover, it provides you with a step-by-step guide to determin- 
ing your own needs and documenting them before you rush out to buy a 
new machine. In fact, sample forms to use in doing just that (and in- 
structions about completing them) are included in the appendices. 

The book also has some good chapters on word processing, protect- 
ing your computer system, and looking toward the future. The appen- 
dices include a checklist for evaluating vendors, a listing of major com- 
puter suppliers, a glossary, and a reference section detailing sources of in- 
formation on a variety of topics. If you're considering using a small com- 
puter in your business, this may be the book for you. You'll certainly get 
a good return on your investment. 

B.U.G. Call. One of the B.U.G. members is hoping to expand the 
capabilities of his Apple II to accommodate a variety of new applica-

tions. He has asked if any of our readers might be able to help him out. 

This reader works at a company that manufactures electronic qual- 
ity control equipment for the glass container industry. The company has 
three Apple lis that are used for word processing, database manage- 
ment, and VisiCalc. He'd like to know whether any other readers have 
found applications packages dealing with printed circuit board design, 
drafting/ computer-aided engineering, production planning/job control, 
recording data from test equipment, trouble-shooting electronic test 
equipment, or numerical control programming for their machining 
equipment. He's also interested in knowing about training packages for 
use with customers and employees and programs that will assist in trans- 
lating equipment manuals into foreign languages. 

If you can provide information about any programs, applications, or 
people in these areas, it would be greatly appreciated. Send it along to the 
B.U.G. and it will be forwarded to your fellow member. This particular 
use of B.U.G. (for shared problem solving) can be its greatest benefit, so 
help out if you can! 

The Readers Query. A recent note from a reader asked a question 
that comes up so frequently that it's deserving of some comment here. 
The question was whether to buy a computer now or wait. The reader's 
main concerns had to do with whether a machine bought now would be 
obsolete two years from now and whether the costs might drop signifi- 
cantly before too long. 

There is, of course, no easy answer. This is so because the problems 
we're talking about here are real problems. Prices will come down and 
the computer you buy may indeed be obsolete soon. Let's look at each of 
these issues. 

Costs will come down. And, as new models are released, the older 
ones will be offered at sale prices. It's not likely that there will be, instan- 
taneously, such a tremendous drop in prices that you'd be dismayed at 
having made your purchase. Price reductions tend to be gradual, not pre- 
cipitous. More important are your own needs. Perhaps the computer will 
actually save you money; you may be losing out more financially by 
waiting for a price reduction, since what you are losing is time that the 



computer could have been working for you. This is particularly true in 
business settings. 

Obsolescence is a significant concern. The technology is changing so 
rapidly that some obsolescence is assured. In the early seventies, it would 
have taken a doctoral student and a grant in six figures to produce a 
workable voice synthesizer. Now one is available for less than $150. For 
another example, just look at what has happened to the calculator mar- 
ket. Something new and better is coming out all the time. If you wait for 
the best and most up-to-date, you'll find yourself waiting for a long 
while. 

The best thing to do is to buy a computer system that's clearly ex- 
pandable. Consider that the six-year-old Apple II can do almost every- 
thing the brand-new He can do through expansion boards, chips, and 
software. 

The machine you get should be able to grow with you as well as with 
the technology. The better machines are now being designed in this fash- 
ion. We think that the present Apples will be around for a while. But, 
clearly, they are the first generation of microcomputers. As with all tech- 
nological developments, there will be succeeding (and better) genera- 
tions. 

The saving grace is twofold. First, business users can often enjoy 
some tax breaks in financing their machines. There are a variety of ways 
to reduce the real cost of equipment. Second, there is, indeed, a very 
good market for used computers. There are other small businesses, stu- 
dents, schools, and a wide variety of sources for recovering a good deal 
of the investment you've made in your computer system. 

Our advice to those who are faced with the dilemma of when to buy 
is: buy now. Buy an expandable system! And remember that, in most 
cases, you really do get what you pay for. 

So long for now.

Four applications in one. 

The Incredible Jack combines the 
convenience of a personal filer with the 
power of a calc package. It handles 
most word processing tasks with ease. 
Toss in the ability to sort and print 
mailing labels, and you have a totally 
integrated, suprisingly easy to use 
package that does most of what you 
bought your Apple for. 

Organize information your way. 

The Incredible Jack lets you arrange 
your information in "records" you design 
yourself using the computer display. 
Each record may be as little as a mailing 
label or as large as 60 sheets of legal 
sized paper. 

Word processing made easy. 

With a few simple commands you can 



master in minutes, you can create 
letters, memos and reports. To help 
you edit, Jack lets you insert, delete, 
and copy portions of text all with 
automatic word wrap and flush right 
margins. The Jack does away with the 
mind boggling control codes and 
formatting options of other word 
processing packages. 

Automatic decision making. 

Jack even allows you to build decison 
making logic into your file. W'th 
English language rules and a powerful 
IF THEN ELSE function, you can 
instantly calculate complex discount 
tables, commission plans, contract 
terms, or tax rates.

Before we continue our discussion of text files from last month, 
there's a little item from the November column that needs clarification (a 
subtle way of saying that there was a mistake). 

The dollars and cents format program worked fine except for two 
minor failings — it couldn't handle whole numbers less than ten, and it of- 
ten lost a penny due to rounding errors. Well, we're all human. To para- 
phrase the words of that immortal math instructor Tom Lehrer, "The 
important thing nowadays is to understand what you are doing rather 
than to get the right answer." 

A number of people sent in corrections that solve the problem. Here 
is the version provided by John Heiser of Warren, Ohio. His changes are 
in lines 15 and 22: 



10 INPUT NUMBER 

15 NUMBER = INT (NUMBER * 100 + .001) / 100 

20 A$ = STR$ (NUMBER) 

22 IF INT (NUMBER) = NUMBER THEN A$ = A$ + ".00" 

25 IF MID$ (A$, LEN (A$) - 2,1) = "." THEN 40 

30 A$ = A$ + "0": GOTO 25 

40 IF NUMBER < 1000 THEN 50 

45 B$ = LEFTS (A$, LEN (A$) - 6):A$ = "," + RIGHTS (A$,6) 

46 IF LEN (B$)KU THEN A$ = B$ + A$: GOTO 50 

47 A$ = "," + RIGHTS (B$,3) + A$:B$ = LEFTS (B$, LEN (B$) - 3): 
GOTO 46 

50 A$ = "$" + A$ 

60 PRINT A$ 

70 GOTO 10 



Thanks, John. A more compact routine (submitted by Albert P. Pin- 
to of Atlanta, Georgia) does essentially the same thing. It is listed in the 
September Open Discussion, on page 27. 

There are also some excellent utilities on the market that add some of 
the missing Basic commands to Applesoft (the Basic command print us- 
ing would ordinarily be available to convert raw numbers to dollars and 
cents format, but that command never made it into the Applesoft vo- 
cabulary). One such utility program is called Apple Spice, available from 
Adventure International. Another is The Routine Machine, published by 
Southwestern Data Systems. 

Now let's get back to our work on text files. Last month we devel- 
oped a simple mailing list program that permitted you to enter a series of 
names and addresses and write them out to disk as a sequential file. It 
was a good exercise but had limited practical value, since the program 
did not permit appending new names to the list at a later date or editing 
or deleting names from the existing list. 

Let's take that simple beginning and build ourselves a full-blown 
mailing list program. We'll start using random access files. For the time 
being, we will keep all of our addresses in an array in memory, but later 
we may want to modify the program so that we can handle lists too long 
to be loaded entirely into RAM. Using random access files will also give 
you a chance to see how random file commands differ from sequential 
file commands. 

First, let's list the program. Then we'll try to take it apart.

The important thing to do whenever confronted with a major task is 
to break it down into bite-sized pieces. That's the way this program was 
written, and that's just about the only way to read it without being over- 
whelmed. 

Let's start by tracing program control. After setting up an array in 
line 10 (and defining D$, our DOS control character), the program 
jumps to line 500. This is the main menu, and it is from this section that 
program control jumps out to all the little sections that manipulate your 
mailing list. 

Take a look at lines 500 through 600. There shouldn't be anything

FEBRUARY 1983 



particularly new in this section; the only complicated bit, line 580, is just 
that clever branching routine that we described the same month that we 
were messing around with dollars and cents formatting. B$ is just a string 
of all the acceptable characters that one can press to jump to different 
parts of the program. The MID$ command finds which character we 
have pressed and sets S to a number from 1 to 7, representing the seven 
items in the menu. 

The first item is C(hoose Mailing List. This routine is located in lines 
7000 through 71 10. Its purpose is to allow you to select the name of the 
particular list you want to work with. (And, in fact, if you run the pro- 
gram and try to jump directly to one of the other menu items without se- 
lecting this one first, you will be directed here nonetheless. More on this 
later.) 

Line 7050 sets the string variable file$ to the name of the mailing list 
we are opening. The if statement at the end of that line opens the file and 
reads in all the information currently in that file, using the subroutine be- 
ginning at line 200. If you chose something other than C(hoose Mailing 
List, the if statement then sends you back to the menu item you original- 
ly selected. 

The rest of this section is designed to set up a new mailing list. First 
any existing file of the same name on the disk is deleted (line 7090 — warn- 
ing: this can be dangerous, and you might want to build some additional 
safeguards in here); then each element of the mailing list array, A$(X,Y), 
is filled with the word end in line 7100, and then the array is written out 
to the disk. Finally, control is returned to the main menu. 

Probably the most complicated thing in this whole program is the use 
of the two-dimensional array A$(X,Y). We use the array to get around 
constantly having to load and save items to the disk, which is very time- 
consuming and hard on the hardware to boot (no pun intended). The ar- 
ray is 4 by 200 in size. Each record is stored in the array as follows: 

A$(0,n) = Pointer to next record 
A$(1,n) = Name of person 
A$(2,n) = First address line 
A$(3,n) = Second address line 
A$(4,n) = Third address line 

The n represents the number of that particular record. This array can 
hold up to 201 records, that is, sets of names and addresses. If you want 
to make it larger, just change the dim statement on line 10 of the 
program. 

The use of a pointer requires a little explanation. Ordinarily, the rec- 
ords are loaded one at a time as we type in our list of favorite names and 
addresses. Therefore, the pointer for the first record would be 2 (since it 
would point to the next, or second, record). The second record's pointer 
would be 3, and so on. This may seem a little silly right now, but the use 
of pointers to chain records together in this manner makes it possible to 
sort records several ways and to insert new records in alphabetical order, 
which may or may not have appeal, depending on how compulsive 
you are. 

The next item on the main menu is A(dd Names. The add names 
routine starts at line 1000. This is the routine that permits you to sit down 
and enter all of your mailing list data. There are a couple of tricky parts 
to it, most of them tied up with the use of the record pointer, so let's take 
it one line at a time. 

Line 1030 checks to see if we have chosen a mailing list file yet. If not, 
we get shipped off to the create- new-file routine at line 7000. 

Next we start examining pointers to find the end of our existing mail- 
ing list. Line 1060 will loop back on itself until it reads a record pointer 
filled with the string literal end. As you may recall, line 7100 set all point- 
ers to end when we first initialized the file. 

Having found the end of our mailing list, we set K to the value of the 
first unused record number and begin accepting data input. Lines 1070 
and 1080 prompt for and check the first line of input data. If we pressed 
return without entering data, this is a signal that we have finished enter- 
ing all of our names, so control is returned to the main menu at line 500. 

The actual input routine is the subroutine starting at line 80. This en- 
tire routine takes the place of the simple input statement, which would 
have been preferable except for its inability to handle strings containing 
commas. As you can see, using the get statement is far more cumber- 



some, but it does have that one advantage. 

Let's take a close look at how the routine works. Line 81 clears our 
output string and the keyboard buffer. The next line accepts a single 
character of input and checks to see whether it is a return. If so, it ships 
us off to line 87, which ties up some loose ends and then returns us 
whence we came. 

Line 83 is necessary to handle the left arrow key, which get sees as 
just another keyboard entry, not worthy of any special treatment. Line 
84 handles the special case where the left arrow is used to delete the en- 
tire string B$, something that line 83 is unable to handle because the sec- 
ond parameter of the leftS instruction cannot be a zero. 

Line 85 prints whatever character we have typed. It then concate- 
nates the new character with those typed in earlier and returns us to line 
82 to get more. 

Line 87 starts with our new vocabulary for the month. Call -868 
clears the line on which the cursor is located from the cursor position to 
the right edge of the screen. The final part of line 87 is intended to trun- 
cate any input so that it all fits within a record that has a total capacity of 
only one hundred characters. 

That's the big difference between sequential and random files, as you 
may remember. Random files have records of a fixed length. Line 100 in 
the program opens a file in which each record is one hundred characters 
long at most (that's why ",L100" is added to the end of the open state- 
ment). And even this method of truncating everything to twenty-five 
characters wouldn't be sufficient if all five fields of the array were loaded 
up to their maximum value. Fortunately, that's not likely to happen. 

But let's get back to the input routine starting at line 1000. Line 1090 
stores the person's name in A$(1,K) with K indicating the record num- 
ber. Then line 1100 loads the three address lines into A$(2,K) through 
A$(4,K). Finally, line 1 120 looks for the next empty file and, upon find- 
ing it, sets A$(0,K) to point to that record. If it can't find an empty file, 
line 1 1 30 prints a warning message and program control is sent back to 
the main menu. 

Note that up to now all we have created is a list that is stored in mem- 
ory. Nothing is written to the disk until we press Q to quit. This sends us 
to line 8000, where we are promptly redirected to the subroutine starting 
at line 100 (no wonder people get dizzy trying to read other people's 
code!). The file is opened in line 100 and we then set up a loop to write all 
of our records. 

There is a difference here between the way you write sequential files 
and the way you must write random access files. When we wrote out a 
sequential file, we put the write command outside the loop and so only 
passed through it once. However, with a random file, it is necessary to 
use the write command to indicate which record you want to write to 
(that's what the characters ",R"X at the end of the write command 
mean — open record number X). Everything will be written sequentially 
to record X until we issue a new write command telling the program to 
write to a different record. 

The loop at line 1 30 does something that might seem a bit strange at 
first. It checks each string that is about to be written to the disk for com- 
mas; if it finds any, it replaces the commas with number (#) signs. If we 
didn't do this, the commas would be understood to mark the end of a 
field within the record when we tried to read the data back into RAM 
from the disk, and our information would get hopelessly jumbled. 

As an aside, you might want to look at the disk reading routine that 
starts at line 200. Line 235 cleverly changes all of the number signs in the 
data file back into commas as it reads the data in. If you think you'll 
need to use a number sign as part of a record, however, you'll have to 
come up with some other unlikely character to substitute for the 
comma. 

There is just one more tricky part in the write file routine. Look at 
line 140. Once we get to a record with a pointer that says end we know 
that there are no more records to write. Therefore, we set X to the top 
value in the for-next loop. When the program hits line 150, it drops out 
of the loop. 

Next month we'll take apart the print and edit routines. Then we'll 
design a couple of sort routines. In the meanwhile, look at the print rou- 
tines on your own. If you have a printer you might find it useful to modi- 
fy this routine to print labels, one, two or three up. Hi

It seemed easy enough in the beginning, a perfectly straightforward 
project. Just reassign the Pascal system volume from the built-in floppy 
drive to ProFile. Somewhere in memory there must surely be a string 
holding the system volume name. If you find where it is, and change 
it. . . . Such is the innocence of the uninformed. 

There are a lot of files in the Pascal system. With just two floppies it's 
a mess, swapping disks in and out like a circus juggler. With three flop- 
pies it's difficult; with two . . . forget it. Far better to have a hard disk 
and at least two floppies. Then the system runs fairly smoothly. You put 
all the accessory files like Editor, Compiler, and Assembler on the hard 
disk and just the necessary boot files on the boot disk. 

Of course those necessary boot files include not only the three SOS 
files, SOS.Kernel, SOS.Driver, and SOS.Interp, but also the Pascal boot 
files System. Pascal, System. Miscinfo, and System. Library. And, if you 
want a turnkey program, you also have to have System. Startup. That's 
an awful lot of stuff on one little boot disk. Usually you will have to cut 
down on System. Library or on the number of drivers in SOS.Driver just 
to make it all fit. And if you have a long System.Startup program you're 
in trouble. The only practical solution is a two-stage boot. First, the SOS 
files on one disk. Then, System. Pascal and the others on another disk. 
That gives you plenty of room, but it's a pain. 

Back to Drive One. And, whether it's a one-stage or a two-stage 
boot, you are stuck with the Pascal system volume in the built-in drive. 
Whichever disk holds System. Pascal is automatically designated the sys- 
tem volume. Pascal hangs onto it like a leech. Almost every time you 
turn around, Pascal wants to refer back to the system volume — to that 
particular disk. If you remove the system volume, Pascal soon will stop 
everything and ask for it back. And you can't put it back just anywhere 
like most Apple III disks. You have to put it back in the built-in drive. 
Pascal won't even recognize the system volume disk in any other drive. 
Pascal simply pretends the drive is empty and zaps you with a "volume 
not found" error. After a while you'll just leave the system volume alone 
and use your external floppies for your own files. It simply isn't worth 
the swapping in and out. 

So there you are with a valuable built-in floppy disk drive dedicated 
almost exclusively to baby-sitting a single file, System. Pascal. And with 
no obvious reason why System.Pascal could not just as easily be on the 
ProFile. 

That's not all. Pascal often creates temporary work files that must al- 
so go on the system volume — in the built-in drive. There is Sys- 
tem. Wrk.Text, which is your work file, if you use it. That must go on the 
system volume. And there are Pascal's own secret work files that you 
never see. They also go on the system volume. During an assembly, for 
example, Pascal creates a short file called Linker.Info on the system vol- 
ume. If all goes well this file is later removed. But, temporarily at least, it 
must be there, and it must be on the system volume. Pascal will accept no 
other. So even with System.Assmbler on the ProFile, you must have the 
system volume in the built-in drive. The only way your own assembly 
language program can be assembled from the built-in drive is to transfer 
it onto the system volume, provided there is room. 

Then there is the matter of speed. Pascal is constantly activating the 
floppies, even though all the relevant files are on hard disk. Floppies are 
slow, about one-tenth the speed of the ProFile. 

And noise. Pascal looks around for its files, beginning with the sys- 
tem volume in the built-in drive and hitting each floppy in turn. If you 
happen to have left one of the drive doors open, the system will punish 
you with that horrible rasping noise that sounds like the floppy is tearing 
itself to shreds. After moving the system volume to ProFile, almost all 
of this searching is eliminated. Most searches then begin with the Pro- 



File, where the files are actually to be found. 

The Best Laid Plans. So the project was worth doing. Convenience, 
speed, quiet, and a liberated floppy disk drive, all for persuading Pascal 
to accept the ProFile as the system volume. But it wasn't quite so simple. 
Oh yes, the string was there in memory; here and there, and other places 
too. But no combination of changes solved the problem. A lot of bizarre 
crashes, but no magical transformation. Back to the drawing boards. . . . 

Apple III Pascal was designed for a high degree of compatibility with 
Apple II Pascal. Apple II Pascal programs can be recompiled and run on 
the III, and the Apple III compiler can be directed to generate Apple II 
code. Apple III Pascal can even read Apple II Pascal disk files directly 
(except some of the system files). A more cynical view might hold that 
Apple III Pascal is a slightly modified version of Apple II Pascal. But, if 
so, it is certainly modified to use the speed and power of a much larger 
machine. 

In any event a tremendous amount of useful information can be ob- 
tained by studying the available documentation for Apple II Pascal. We 
particularly recommend the Apple Pascal reference manuals from Ap- 
ple and the recently released Call —A.P.P.L.E. In Depth, Number Two: 
All About Pascal from the Apple PugetSound Program Library Ex- 
change. The latter volume reprints "Pascal Internals" by Mike Rosing 
and Keith McLauren, an excellent article that traces the initial boot proc- 
ess for initializing Pascal and provides much valuable information about 
the structure and operation of the p-machine on Apple II. Much of what 
we have learned about Apple III Pascal's inner workings has been trans- 
lated to Apple III from information in that article. 

When Apple III is powered up, the first step is a bootstrap process by 
which SOS.Kernel loads itself into memory and positions itself at loca- 
tions SBCOO through SFFFF in the system memory bank. SOS then 
loads in the interpreter, SOS.Interp, which is placed in a predefined area 
of memory below SOS.Kernel. The Pascal interpreter occupies locations 
S760E through $B7FF. Then, before transferring control to the interpret- 
er, SOS loads in the drivers from SOS.Driver and positions them one af- 
ter another below the interpreter in memory. The drivers are all linked to 
SOS on a daisy chain extending from the floppy disk drivers. You never 
see these. They are buried in SOS.Kernel at location SE899 (in the cur- 
rent version). Then each driver is given an opportunity to initialize it- 
self, and, finally, SOS relinquishes control to the user program by jump- 
ing to the first instruction in the interpreter. 

As far as SOS is concerned, the interpreter is the program. If the in- 
terpreter wants to do clever things, fine. SOS doesn't care, up to a point. 
In some applications, such as Apple Writer III, the interpreter is a stand- 
alone machine language program. SOS.Interp is Apple Writer III. In 
Business Basic the interpreter is the language Basic (which SOS regards 
as the program). The language, in turn, runs other programs as subrou- 
tines: your Basic programs. 

Pascal is a bit more complicated. As in Basic, the Pascal interpreter is 
the Pascal language, a machine language program. And the interpreter, 
in turn, runs high-level programs as subroutines. The Pascal interpreter is 
referred to as the p-machine. Its main job is to process sequences of 
p-code, your Pascal programs. It converts p-code instructions into 6502 
machine language instructions and executes them. 

But before getting around to translating p-code, the interpreter has a 
lot to do. It must set up the Pascal system within Apple III. It allocates 
chunks of memory for different purposes, sets up the Pascal execution 
stack and heap, and assigns various zero-page locations as pointers to all 
of its own parts in memory. It also sets up a communications area to 
SOS, called Syscom, and it compiles a list of the drivers that are avail- 
able and how to get to them. Finally it loads chunks of Pascal program,

p-code, from disk into memory and begins to do whatever the p-code 
says to do. And the first p-code program loaded is System. Pascal. 

Conceptually, there is an extra step in Pascal not present in Basic. In 
Basic, the interpreter is a machine langage program which, in turn, runs 
various programs written in the language Basic. In Pascal, on the other 
hand, the Pascal interpreter runs just one Pascal program, System. Pas- 
cal. System. Pascal is itself a program written in Pascal; that is, in p-code. 
In a sense, it is the only Pascal program. Your own Pascal programs are 
really just subroutines, procedures called up by the program, Sys- 
tem. Pascal. This means that System. Pascal itself is always running. 
That's why Pascal latches on so firmly to the system volume. The system 
volume contains System. Pascal, a currently active and executing pro- 
gram that the system maintains as a continuously open file. 

The Software Swap Meet. So why not just load System. Pascal into 
memory and run it from there? Why tie up a disk? Well, System. Pascal is 
actually the coordinating center for the overall Pascal system (the pro- 
gram) of which all the accessory files, such as Editor, Compiler, and As- 
sembler, are parts. It would be a colossal waste of memory to keep the 
whole thing in RAM. 

One of the fundamental precepts of Pascal (on small computers) is 
that segments of programs reside in memory only while they are active 
and useful. Unused segments are left on disk and are swapped briefly 
into memory when called. This preserves RAM memory for data. You 
can even designate parts of your own programs as separate segments, so 
that an initialization procedure, for example, will not tie up memory af- 
ter it is no longer needed. System. Pascal itself is divided into several such 
segments, only a few of which reside in memory at any one time. But the 
rest have to be available. Furthermore, the system needs a bit of non- 
volatile scratch-pad space for work files and for recording various op- 
tions used in future reboots of the system. Hence the system volume. It is 
really just a means of providing the system with some nonvolatile mem- 
ory for its own use. 

What is less clear is why the system volume has to be kept in the 
built-in drive. This may be one of the burdens of evolution, like an 
appendix. We now suspect that Pascal systems and subsystems have, for

several decades, expected the system volume to be found on Pascal I/O 
unit 4, which in Apple III is the built-in drive. So now, after extensive de- 
velopment of the Pascal system, many different parts of the system just 
refer to unit 4, instead of a variable that might easily be reassigned. If 
true, that is a clear violation of good programming technique. All global 
constants should be referenced by label so that any constant can be 
changed with a single reassignment. 

It makes some sense to keep the system volume in unit 4 if all your 
drives are the same quality. Suppose that all your disks are floppies. If 
you have to tie up one floppy it might just as well be the built-in floppy. 
At least you can be reasonably sure that it exists. And there is no ob- 
vious advantage in switching to some other floppy, which the next 
person may or may not have purchased. So, if the Pascal developers were 
thinking of systems with several floppy disk drives, they might not have 
anticipated a reassignment. But when you buy a hard disk, such as 
ProFile, reassignment suddenly becomes worthwhile. 

It is hard to believe the Pascal writers would have made this error. 
But it is reasonably certain that if there is a system volume variable, and 
it is assigned to unit 4, that the assignment is done after the system 
switches to running in p-code — perhaps in the Initiali segment of 
System. Pascal. It is not done during the initial setup of the Pascal system 
by SOS.Interp. 

It's true that there is a location in Syscom, Pascal's communications 
link to SOS, called Sysunit. This location's value is the number of the 
unit from which the system was booted. SOS.Interp does explicitly load 
that location with the value 4, which is Pascal's number for the built-in 
drive. But, unfortunately, when SOS.Interp is patched to load that loca- 
tion with a 5 (unit 5 is the same as D2), the system volume is not 
affected, although there are some other peculiar effects we shall mention 
in a moment. 

So it really looked for a while as though the p-code of System. Pascal 
would have to be decompiled. That is a mammoth task, and one that 
isn't made any easier by the fact that we really don't know how . . . yet. 
Fortunately for this project, it turned out to be unnecessary. 

We cherish the belief that it is only our preoccupation with the yawn- 
ing abyss of p-code, and not some more serious defect, that closed our 
mind for weeks and weeks to what we already knew. Pascal's "Unit #4" 
is a label, and in Apple III Pascal it is assigned the value .Dl. The Ro- 
setta stone. 

You see, Pascal keeps its own set of books. Back before there was an 
Apple III, Pascal was happily doing graceful gymnastics with files. Files 
were referenced by path name. Input and output were standardized. And 
Pascal handled all the busy work, automatically. Pascal kept track of 
which files were open, the current position in files, and even things like 
prefixes. Pascal also kept a list of all the available devices, numbered in a 
standard and predictable order. This was the list of Pascal unit numbers. 
Standard devices, like Console and Graphics, were always assigned the 
same number, which helped make the system more transportable from 
one machine to another. It was all done as part of the Pascal system. The 
Pascal programmer didn't have to mess with it. 

Pascal's SOS Runaround. Then along came Apple III. Wouldn't it be 
nice, they thought, if the operating system could handle files with all the 
ease and power of Pascal? So that's what was done. SOS was given a 
great many machine language subroutines to do all those marvelous 
things with files. Using SOS calls, the programmer can create and ma- 
nipulate files almost as easily from assembly language as from any higher 
language. It's great. 

Apple III Pascal, however, doesn't use those capabilities. Or at least 
not many of them. In Apple Ill's operating system, a single SOS call can 
search several devices for a particular volume, read its directory, locate a 
given file, and open a unique pathway to read and write the file's con- 
tents. But Pascal ignores that. Pascal uses mainly the Device Read SOS 
call, which works almost at the level of track and sector (and is actually 
considered illegal). Pascal searches for the volume. Pascal reads the di- 
rectory. Pascal finds the file. Pascal even keeps its own prefix. It's really a 
massive duplication of effort, and a waste of memory since all those SOS 
routines are right there in RAM memory, betwen SBC00 and SFFFF. 
But that's why Pascal is such a portable language. It ignores the unique 
abilities of particular machines.

FEBRUARY 1983 



When you boot Apple III, SOS loads the drivers and links their ad- 
dresses together in a daisy chain so they won't get lost. Then SOS assigns 
each driver in the chain a number, starting with 1 . Since the floppies are 
always at the head of the chain, the numbers begin: .Dl = 1, .D2 = 2, 
and so on. After the floppies, the numbers continue for all the other 
devices in whatever order they were loaded from SOS.Driver (which is 
just the reverse of how they are listed by the System Configuration pro- 
gram). Remember that these are SOS device numbers, not Pascal unit 
numbers. SOS keeps a set of books too. 

Then SOS turns control over to Pascal, and right away Pascal wants 
its own list. Furthermore, Pascal wants the drivers numbered in the stan- 
dard Pascal manner, not in whatever order they got shoved into 
SOS.Driver. (Pascal must surely have been regular Navy.) So Pascal 
compiles its own list; and this is done by SOS.Interp, before the switch to 
p-code. For each SOS device number in the list, from 1 to no-such- 
device, SOS.Interp polls the device, finds out what type of device it is, 
and assigns that device number to the proper Pascal unit number. Thus, 
it creates a look-up table. And it creates the look-up table just once. 
Thereafter, whenever Pascal wants unit 4 it goes to the look-up table. 
"Oh yes, unit 4 is SOS device 1 ." So Pascal issues a Device Read SOS call 
to SOS device 1 . 

The first accompanying program patches SOS.Interp. The sequence 
of instructions is unchanged until after SOS.Interp has built the look-up 
table. Then the patch captures the code path and switches the assign- 
ments for Pascal units 4 and 9 (or whatever unit number has been as- 
signed to your hard disk). The patch then jumps back to the original 
code path, and SOS.Interp goes about its business as before. Pascal is 
none the wiser. When Pascal wants to talk to the system volume it asks 
for Pascal unit 4 just as it always did. But now, when it goes to the look- 
up table, it gets the SOS device number of your hard disk instead of the 
device number of the built-in drive. 

How is Pascal to know? Or SOS either? All devices look pretty much 
the same, just places that send and receive binary bits. Only their names 
tell them apart, except that their names have been switched. . . . But

everything else goes on as before. Pascal goes right ahead and assigns the 
volume in Pascal unit 4 as the system volume. But that volume is now the 
root directory of your hard disk. 

We do not change the value of Sysunit, the Pascal unit number of the 
device from which the system was booted. We want Pascal to continue to 
think the boot device was unit 4, even though unit 4 is now your hard 
disk. Strangely enough, changing Sysunit doesn't actually affect the sys- 
tem volume assignment anyway. What it seems to do is to cause Pascal 
to switch to an alternative standard numbering scheme for devices. One 
floppy's existence is denied altogether. Doubtless Sysunit is more useful 
in other systems. 

SOS turns control over to the Pascal language program by perform- 
ing a jump to the first instruction in SOS.Interp at location S760E. The 
pathway then makes two jumps to S775F and begins. 
$7767: Issue Close SOS call to "close everything." 
Zero the device number look-up table. 
Get device number of Console (SOS call $84) 

store in $7694 - will be Pascal unit 1. 
Device number of graphics to $7696. 
Device number of printer to $7695. 
Device number of RS232 port to $769D and $769E. 
$780F..$7825: loop. 

Device numbers of floppies - until error 
store in "block devices" $7697..$769C (lower table). 
$7828..$789F: A loop: For each device number — until error. 
$7847: Is device already in table? 
Is it Console type? 
Yes: if no console in $7694 
then store there 

else store in upper table (unit numbers 128+). 
Is it Graphics type? 

Yes: if no graphics in $7696 then there; else upper table. 
Is it Printer type? 

Yes: if no printer in $7695 then there; else upper table. 
If character device then assign upper table 
else (block device) if any room left in $7697..$769C 
then there; else upper table. 
Next device number .. end loop. 
Get console device number. 
JSR $7921 = get its name and open it. 
JSR S7B71 = set console device status table options. 
JSR $7BCB = set more console status options. 
Set (SOS) prefix to null. 

Store highest bank number in $16FE and $7C5E. 
JMP $8352 then to $8603. 
This is where we will capture the code path and switch the contents of lo- 
cation $7697 (originally assigned to SOS device 1 = .Dl) with the device 
number assigned to the hard disk. The latter will be found in the first 
block device location after the floppies (that is, $7697 + number of flop- 
pies configured). The code path resumes its original course at: 
$8603: Initialize 6502 stack. 
$8607: Interpreter bank number to zero page $A8. 
$860E: "$00" to zero page $70 - ? error flag. 
$861C: SOS call— release all memory segments (except SOS's). 
$8622. .$8664: Find a four-page memory segment (ID #16) 
put its pointer (three-byte) at $9F,A0/16A0. 
This area is subsequently used as an intermediate I/O buffer for read 
operations to the file System. Pascal. 

$8666..$8685: Request two-page memory segment ID #11 

= s-bank pages $1E..1F. 
$8687: Open file System. Miscinfo using SOS call. 
The pathname .Dl /System. Miscinfo is found as a string at $838D and 
transferred to the SOS call parameter list. In the accompanying patch 
program this pathname is changed to .«ame/System. Miscinfo (using, of 
course, whatever device name you have assigned to your hard disk). 

$86AB: If file is not found in .Dl then send error message to con- 
sole screen saying "Put Pascal system disk in built-in drive." Then wait 
for return keypress. Repeat as necessary. In the accompanying patch 
program this message is changed to "Press return when .name is on-line."

S86DA: Load one block from file System. Miscinfo 
into buffer located $83FB..$85FA. 

S86E0: Move byte number $36 of System. Miscinfo to zero page 
$76. This byte determines the size of graphics area allocation. Possible 
values are: $C0 = no graphics; $C8 = 8K bytes; $D0 = 16K bytes; 
$E0 = 32K bytes. 

$86EA: Close file System. Miscinfo. 

$86F0..$8723: Request segment ID #15 to begin at bank 0 page 00. 
and extend to correct length of graphics area (or one page if graphics 
= 0). 

$8725..$875C: Find segment (ID #12) of length $FF pages. This will 
be the Pascal data space. If you can't get $FF pages, get as many as you 
can. Store segment addresses: base at $A3,A4; limit at $A5,A6. 

S875E..S87B1: Make three-byte pointers to data space: 

base of heap @$98; top @$9A; Syscom @$9C. 

$87B3: Zero the Syscom area. 

$87C6..$8815: Open file System.Pascal using SOS call. Store the file 
reference number at zero page $9C. This file thereafter remains open. If 
not found on .Dl then the same error message is sent until the file is 
found. The Open SOS call uses the pathname .Dl /System.Pascal, which 
is found as a string at $836A. In the accompanying patch program that 
string is changed to .nawe/System.Pascal. 

$8817..$883B: Read block 0 of System.Pascal into buffer at 

$83FB..85FA. This is the segment dictionary. 
$883D..$8872: Make pointers to parts of segment dictionary 

and to Syscom + $60. 
$8875..$88E2: Transfer segment dictionary info to Syscom + $60 
area. 

$88E4: Zero system bank pages $1E..1F. 
$88EF: Make three-byte pointers: 

Pascal stack @5C; Stkbase pseudo register @52; 
New pointer @5A. 
$892F: Store xbyte for Pascal data space in $16E1, 16E3 .. 16EF. 
$893B..$8971: ?? has several complex JSRs. Apparently loads in the 
first p-code segment to be run and sets IPC (Inter- 
preter Program Counter = zero page $58) to point to 
the first p-code instruction. 
$897D: Stores $04 (value found at location $8369) 

into Sysunit = 5th byte of Syscom. 
$8984: JMP $8A0D— to p-code evaluation loop. 
The p-code evaluation loop is quite simple. It uses extended address- 
ing via the IPC pqinter (Interpreter Program Counter = zero page $58) 
to fetch a p-code byte from the Pascal program sequence located else- 
where in memory. If the p-code value is in the range $00..7F then it is a 
data byte and is simply pushed on the stack. If the value is in the range 
$80.. FF then it is an instruction. In that case the p-code value is really 
just an index into a jump table (located $8200.. 82FF). First the value is 
multiplied times two since the jump table is a list of two-byte words. 
Then an indirect jump is made via the jump table to the code that han- 
dles that particular p-code instruction. Upon return, the IPC pointer is 
incremented to point to the next p-code instruction and the cycle begins 
again. The disassembler listing is as follows: 

8A0D: A4 70 LDY70 ; = "00" (? unless error) 

8A0F: DO 0B BNE - > error handler? 

8A11: B1 58 LDA @58,Y ; IPC pointer - extended addressing 

8A13: 10 ED BPL -> 8A02 ; where it is pushed on stack 

8A15: OA ASL A ; it's negative so double it 

8A16: 8D 1A 8A STA 8A1A ; store it in low byte of @JMP 

8A19: 6C 00 82 JMP @8200 ; make the indirect jump via table 

Using the Patch: The accompanying patch program alters the Pas- 
cal SOS.Interp file to reassign the Pascal system volume to a hard 
disk. Instructions and some explanations are interspersed with the code. 

The program normally needs to be run only once. It creates a per- 
manent change in the SOS.Interp file on a Pascal boot disk. Thereafter 
the change becomes effective each time you boot with that disk. Since 
you are obviously a careful and intelligent person you will, of course, be 
working only with copies of the Pascal boot files, never with the 
originals. 

The program needs to use the name that you have assigned to your 



hard disk. It must be the exact device name assigned in the SOS. Driver 
file on that same boot disk. Also, the program needs to know how many 
floppy disk drives are configured (counting the built-in drive). It must be 
the number of configured floppies as recorded in SOS. Driver. This may 
or may not be the same as the number of floppies you have plugged into 
your Apple III. The program's success depends on the number of active 
floppy drivers in memory, not on the number of actual physical drives. 
(You might want to arrange for these two numbers to be the same.) 

Because of the dependence on the device name and on the number of 
configured floppies, the whole thing will have to be redone if you change 
either of these parameters. Each time you rerun the patch program 
you must begin with a fresh, unmodified, accurate copy of the Pascal 
SOS.Interp. 

The patch actually assigns the first nonfloppy block device that it 
finds to the spot normally occupied by .Dl in the look-up table. In most 
systems the only nonfloppy block device will be a hard disk. But if you do 
have other block devices you must be careful. Whichever block device 
appears last in SOS. Driver, according to the list displayed by the System 
Configuration program, will be the device tagged. The Pascal system 
volume will be the volume name of whatever volume is on the tagged 
block device during boot. That volume must contain System.Pascal, Sys- 
tem. Miscinfo, and System. Library (if used) in its root directory. Normal- 
ly, of course, you will put all the system files in that root directory. 

It is possible that you may obtain (or write) one or more special pur- 
pose device drivers for your Apple III. Such drivers can facilitate a 
variety of nefarious activities such as dissecting the operating system. In 
fact, the whole patch program could conceivably be done automatically 
from a driver each time you boot (but with that approach you would 
have had to do a lot more typing). Such drivers will, of course, be clas- 
sified either as block devices or as character devices. All device drivers 
are. If any are block devices, then don't forget about the "last in the list" 
problem. You will probably have to juggle the order in which such 
drivers are placed in SOS. Driver. It is done by deleting drivers and 
reading drivers. 

Pascal begins most file searches at the system volume. That is now

your hard disk, and that is where the files are actually located. There is 
little hunting about. At this point, however, Pascal does still believe that 
four files are most likely to be found on .D2 and starts looking there. The 
files are: Editor, Compiler, Assembler, and Linker. The first time any of 
these files is called, Pascal takes a quick look in .D2 (Pascal unit 5). The 
file, of course, is not there. A formal search then begins (and promptly 
ends) with the system volume. It is possible to correct this remaining 
search anomaly by changing only four bytes in the file System. Pascal. 
The bytes occur in strings of the form #5:System. Editor. We merely 
change the 5 to a 4. But while we are at it we can change a few more bytes 
and solve another problem as well. 

Period Piece. As we have already noted, the system files must all be 
in the root directory of the system volume, just as they were on the 
floppy disk. This is rather a pain. It would be nice if all these files could 
be collected into one subdirectory where they wouldn't clutter up the 
screen every time you list the root directory's contents. Unfortunately, 
when looking for system files, Pascal normally looks no further than the 
root directory of each volume: a relic, no doubt, of Apple II Pascal. ' 

But notice the system file names. They are all in the form 
System. name. This suggests a trick. Suppose you went through all the 
various system files and found all the strings in which these names are 
stored. (There are about twenty, not counting references to the work 
files.) If, in each case, you then changed the periods to slashes, the names 
would become System/ Pascal, System/Filer, System/Compiler, and so 
forth. Then, on your hard disk, you could make a subdirectory called 
System and place within it the files Pascal, Filer, Compiler, and so on. 
Would not the system then interpret the revised names as pathnames to 
the subdirectory? Amazingly, it would, and does, provided you have also 
changed those four search references mentioned above from unit 5 to 
unit 4. For some unknown reason, if Pascal once fails in a stab at 
#5: System/ Editor it just comes all apart. But #4: System/ Editor works 
fine, perhaps because it is successful on the first try. 

Thus the second accompanying program. It too has instructions, if 
fewer explanations. It is a utility program for changing all the necessary 
bytes in the various system files. You enter the byte numbers one at a 
time from the list provided. It only needs to be done once. Of course, it is 
entirely superfluous to caution you about copying the information on 
your hard disk to floppy backups before you start messing around. 

If you have a disassembler program you might find it interesting to 
look at the byte number locations in the various files. That, of course, is 
how we found them: with a disassembler search program. You can also 
use the disassembler to check that the byte numbers changed were indeed 
located within the strings described. Someone, somewhere, may have 
made a typo. 

Instructions. This program changes Pascal's SOS.Interp to assign 
your hard disk as the system volume. The change is a permanent altera- 
tion of the disk file and becomes effective when Pascal is rebooted with 
the modified SOS.Interp. This program needs to be run only once . . . 
unless you change the configuration of block devices in your computer 
system. 

All System.name files (plus Errors. 6502 and Opcodes.6502) must 
henceforth be on the hard disk. They must be in either: 

Root directory: a. Compiled with (SSETC SubDirectory : = false). 

b. Pascal system files not altered. 
System subdirectory: a. Compiled with (SSETC SubDirectory : = 
true). 

b. Pascal system files altered with To.Subdir 
program. 

c. Errors.6502 and Opcodes.6502 must remain 
in root directory. 

Only the system volume designation is changed. All pathname refer- 
ences to .Dl, .D2, and so on, whether from the keyboard or from your 
programs, will continue to work normally. 

If your hard disk goes off line while Pascal is running you will get an 
"Exec Err #9" the next time Pascal looks for the system volume. It is 
fatal unless you can get the hard disk back on line. 

Notes: 

I. Valid only for Apple III Pascal — version 1.0. 



2. Must be redone if you change the number of floppy disk drives 
configured into SOS. Driver by the System Configuration program. 

3. Must be redone if you change the device name of your hard disk 
(as configured into SOS.Driver). 

4. When redone, always start with a clean, unmodified copy of Pas- 
cal's SOS.Interp. 

5. Device name must start with a period. Do not end it with a "•/." 
Examples: ".P," ".Profile," ".Bytesalot" 

See rules: Standard Device Drivers Manual, page 15. 

The name you supply must be the name assigned in SOS.Driver. 

6. If you have more than one hard disk (or other block device that is 
not on the floppy drive daisy chain), then the last such driver list- 
ed in SOS.Driver will be assigned. 

7. In the remarks below, addresses are given in hexadecimal and re- 
fer to locations that SOS.Interp will occupy when booted into 
memory. 

8. In the program lines these addresses are decimal and refer to posi- 
tions relative to the beginning of the program buffer.

THE 



Tools of the Craft, Part 20 

Greetings from the land down under! Al- 
though even the most enthusiastic columnist needs 
an occasional holiday, the Softalk presses never 
stop. Consequently, this issue's stroll down the 
Path meanders through the lovely country of New 
Zealand, where both the botanical and electronic 
Apples coexist in splendor and harmony. 

Rebuilding the Home. In Cable, which we 
have been developing and studying for the last 
few months, we have a program that permits 
convenient, though rudimentary, manipulation 
of a very primitive set of data. You'll remem- 
ber that Cable was designed to permit the es- 
tablishment and maintenance of a two-dimen- 
sional matrix representing a "Town" full of 
"Homes," where a Home models a residence 
and its occupants in the form of data relevant to 
a cable television franchise. Our initial Home 
consisted of nothing more than an account 
number, where a zero value indicated an empty 
(or nonsubscribing) dwelling. 

CONST 
NoSubscriber= 0; 
MaxAcctNum= Maxlnt; 
TYPE 
AcctNumType = 

NoSubscriber .. MaxAcctNum; 
Home = 
AcctNumType; 

Of course, no real cable television concern 
would be satisfied with such a limited model. In 
addition to an account number, even the small- 
est firm would want to be able to record a sub- 
scriber's name, billing address (if different from 
the residence address), and telephone number. 
If premium channels are available, there should 
be some means of distinguishing "premium" 
subscribers from "basic rate" customers. For 
purposes of scheduling preventive mainte- 
nance, the holder of a cable television franchise 
may also wish to keep a record of the date when 
a service representative was last dispatched to a 
particular address. Sophisticated systems might 
even keep logs that summarize all the com- 
ments or complaints sent to the company from 
a given home; the computer could then be used 
to correlate neighborhood service complaints in 
order to do a better job of isolating problems in 
the cable network itself. 

It's clear that such diverse sets of data can- 
not all be squeezed down into a single elemen- 
tary datum. If we want to store more data for 
each Home, then the definition of a Home must 
be enhanced. Of course, a Home could itself be 
an array, containing several data items. This 
would turn a Town into a matrix of at least 
three dimensions — one index for the Street- 



s 



ATH 

By Jim Merritt 



Name, one for the HouseNumber, and at least 
one for selecting a specific datum from among 
the cluster that would comprise the new model 
of a Home. 

There's a snag, though. All the elements in 
an array must share the same data type. The ar- 
ray that is constructed from Integers cannot 
also contain Booleans, and vice versa. Of 
course, a clever programmer can find a way to 
use an Integer value as if it were a Boolean one, 
or to make an ARRAY OF Integer serve the 
same purpose as an ARRAY OF Char. How- 
ever, such measures produce tricky, obscure 
programs. In a pinch, you can always use a 
wrench as a hammer, too, but no competent 
workman would deliberately choose a wrench 
for the job of driving a nail when a hammer is 
readily available. 

Records. Pascal does indeed permit us to 
"glue" several dissimilar data together, in the 
form of a record. In order to make the Cable 
program more responsive to the business it 
serves, we will redefine a Home to be a record 
and so transform Streets and Towns into ma- 
trices of records. 

As a rule of thumb, you may define and use 
a record anywhere that an array or matrix 
would also be appropriate. Figure 1 presents the 
syntax diagram for a record definition. In this 
discussion, we'll examine all but the PACKED 
and CASE options, which will be covered in fu- 
ture columns. 

Let's decide to change a Home so that it 
contains an account number, a personal name, 
and a billing address, including city name, two- 



letter state abbreviation, and nine-character 
postal code. (Remember, zip codes will soon be 
growing, and Cable should accommodate the 
change!) Let's also include a ten-digit phone 
number, the date of the last service call, and a 
notation as to whether a given subscriber 
should be billed at the basic or premium rate. 
To accomplish all this, we may remove the old 
definition of Home from the Cable program 
and replace it with the following 

Date= 
RECORD 
Month 

:(Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, 
Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec); 
Day 

: 1 .. 31;

END (* Date *);

END (* BillAddress *);

String[10]; 
Rate 



RECORD DECLARATION 




Figure 1. Record declaration 



FEBRUARY 1983 



:(Basic, Premium); 
LastService 
:Date; 
END (* Home *); 

The Pascal definition of our new Home 
looks very much like what it is: an aggregate of 
several individual variables, each with its own 
name and type. Each of the record's constit- 
uent variables is called a field of the record. Just 
as we had to add an index to an array name in 
order to access any individual array element, so 
must we add a field descriptor to a record name 
in order to access any particular field. A field 
descriptor consists of a period followed by the 
name of the selected field. For instance, sup- 
pose we declare a variable H to be of type 
Home. We would refer to H's AcctNum field as 
"H.AcctNum". "H. Phone" refers to the Phone 
field of H. "H.Rate" is the name of H's Rate 
field. 

Like an array element, a record field may be 
given any type except one based on files. Rec- 
ord fields may themselves be records or arrays, 
as demonstrated by the BillAddress and Last- 
Service fields of Home. Each is a record; Bill- 
Address's record structure is declared explicitly 
in the Home definition, while LastService is a 
record because its declared type, Date, is a rec- 
ord type. To access the Street field of BillAd- 
dress in the Home variable H, you would write 
"H.BillAddress.Street", not "H.Street". To ac- 
cess LastService's month field, you'd use 
"H. LastService. Month". 

Now look carefully at the following decla- 
rations: 

TYPE 
First = 
RECORD 
State 

:(Big, Little); 
Counter 

: Integer; 
END (* First *); 
Second = 
RECORD 
State 
:String[2]; 
Inner 
:RECORD 
State 

: -1 .. 1; 
ProdCode 
:Char; 

END (* Second. Inner *); 
END (* Second *); 
VAR 
State 
: Integer; 
Red 

:First; 
Rec2 
:Second; 

At first glance, it might seem as if the iden- 
tifier "State" is used far too often. In the past, 
we have carefully avoided declaring two or 
more objects with the same name at the same 
declaration level, since we know that the com- 
piler is duty bound to detect and complain of 
such situations. Yet, the code given earlier is 
correct. To see why, examine these assignment 
statements: 

(* 1 *) State := 43; 

(* 2 *) Red. State := Little; 



(* 3 *) Rec2.State := 'NZ'; 
(* 4 *) Rec2.lnner.State := 0; 

The first statement refers to the Integer var- 
iable, the second to a field in Reel that has been 
given an explicitly enumerated (and therefore 
anonymous) type, the third to a String field 
within Rec2, and the last to an Integer sub- 
range field in a record that is itself part of Rec2. 
The fact of the matter is, no two objects in these 
declarations actually have the same name. The 
Integer variable State is separate and distinct 
from any of the record fields named State, and 
all of these fields are separate and distinct from 
one another, because the name of each "State" 
field is not complete unless prefixed with the 
name of its parent variable (and the names of 
any parent fields, as in "Rec2.Inner.State"). The 
compiler detects no ambiguities, because there 



201 

are none; the prefixes that must be attached to 
each field name render the field unique to the 
compiler. 

In order to avoid confusion, then, the com- 
piler usually requires the programmer to refer to 
all variables and record fields by their full 
names. While this can be cumbersome, as we'll 
soon see, it does give us a great deal of freedom 
in naming record fields. The following incor- 
rect record declaration, however, abuses our 
freedom, and will be rejected by the compiler as 
ambiguous: 

VAR 
BRec 
:RECORD

When two objects have been defined within 
the same declaration area, you can decide 
whether or not they are ambiguous with re- 
spect to one another by writing out their full 
names. If the full names of the two objects are 
different, the compiler can distinguish between 
the objects. Applied to the example just given, 
this test would show that two different fields

have precisely the same full name, "BRec.Con-

correctly — defined. 

Getting Chummy WITH Records. Sup- 
pose you have a Home variable H and you 
want to set the LastService date to September 
16, 1957. As things stand, you would have to 
write the following code: 

H. LastService. Month := Sep; 
H. LastService. Day := 16; 
H. LastService. Year := 1957; 

That's a lot of writing, most of it unnecessary. 
Now, consider a more efficient equivalent: 

WITH H. LastService DO 
BEGIN 

Month := Sep; 

Day := 16; 

Year := 1957; 
END; 

Pascal's WITH-clause — used to good ad- 
vantage in the second example — permits you to 
create special "zones" within your program 
where record field references may be abbrevi- 
ated. Instead of having to call record fields by 
their full names, you may place yourself on a 
"first name basis," thus decreasing the wordi- 
ness of your programs. 

Figure 2 is the syntax diagram for the 
WITH-clause; notice that any WITH affects 
only one statement, although that statement 
may of course be a compound of several state- 
ments, bracketed by BEGIN and END. The list 
of names given in a WITH-clause may include 
only valid field name prefixes; that is, only rec- 
ord variable names (for example, "H") or par- 
tial record field specifications (for example, 
"H.BillAddress") are acceptable components of 
a WITH-list. 

To see how the WITH-clause works, let's 
consider an example: 

PROGRAM 
WithTest; 
VAR 
I 

:lnteger; 
Rec 



:RECORD 
C 

:Char; 

I 

:lnteger; 
END (* Rec *); 
Rec2 
:RECORD 
I 

:Char; 

C 

: Integer; 
END; 

BEGIN (* WithTest *) 

I := 0; 

Reel := 0; 

Rec2.l := 'C'; 

WriteLn('l = ', I); 

WriteLnj'Rec.l = ', Reel); 

WriteLn('Rec2.l = ', Rec2.l); 

(* NOTE: You'd rarely use a WITH-clause for 
a single statement, especially for one as 
trivial as this, but we're trying to illustrate a 
point as simply as possible here. *) 

WITH Rec2, Rec DO 
I := 7; 

WriteLn; 

WriteLn('l = ', I); 
WriteLn('Rec.l = ', Reel); 
WriteLn('Rec2.l = ', Rec2.l); 
END (* WithTest *). 

In With Test's declaration area, we define an 
Integer variable I and then two records, each of 
which contains a field named I. The "I" field in 
Rec may hold an Integer, while that in Rec2 
may contain only Char values. The first three 
assignments in the program body serve to ini- 
tialize the variable I and the two "I" fields. No 
initialization of the "C" fields is performed be- 
cause they're not used in this program. (Even 
so, good programming practice suggests that 
they should be initialized. The rule has been 
broken here so as to keep the size of WithTest 
to a minimum.) Next come statements that dis- 
play the initial contents of the three objects in 
question. 

Upon encountering the WITH-clause, the 
Apple Pascal compiler stores its list of prefixes 
and goes on to process the assignment state- 
ment that is guarded by the WITH. At once, it 
is confronted with the identifier I. 

Whenever a WITH-clause is active, the 
compiler assumes that any identifier that could 
be a variable name is, in fact, only part of a full 
object name. Consequently, the compiler's first 
reaction is to scan its list of prefixes, concate- 
nating each to I, until it succeeds in construct- 
ing a valid object name, or until all attempts to 
do so have failed. If the WITH-list scan fails 
completely, then the compiler concludes (as it 
would have in the first place had no WITH 
been active) that the identifier in question must 
be a complete object name. Analysis of the iden- 
tifier then proceeds on that basis. Note that the 
Apple Pascal compiler scans its WITH-list in re- 
verse order, which is a quirk that's not man- 
dated by the Pascal language definition itself. 
Still, this aberration is significant, as we'll see 
shortly. 

In the case of WithTest, the scan succeeds 
on the first try, as "Reel" is the full name of an 
actual record field. (Remember, "Rec" was the 
last item in the original WITH-list.) After gen- 
erating the p-code that assigns 7 to Reel, the 



FEBRUARY 1983 



WHIM I 



203 



compiler passes on to process the display state- 
ments that conclude the program. 

All this being the case, you should expect 
the final values of I, Reel, and Rec2.Ito beO, 7, 
and 'C, respectively. This is in fact what hap- 
pens, as demonstrated on the display screen, 
when you compile and execute WithTest. 

Now let's modify the program, reversing the 
order of the items in the WITH-list, and at- 
tempt recompilation. The compiler complains 
of Error 129 ("Type conflict of operands") 
when it tries to process the assignment to "I" 
that is guarded by the WITH-clause. In this 
case, "I" is now equivalent to "Rec2.I", be- 
cause "Rec2" is the new final item in the 
WITH-list. Since Rec2.I is a Char variable, the 
Integer constant 7 may not be placed in it, and 
the compiler very rightly issues an error 
message. 

The situation in WithTest is an unfortunate 
one; such a subtle thing as the order of items in 
a WITH-list should not affect the compilation 
of a program. The problem really stems from 
the fact that, with both Rec and Rec2 in the 
WITH-list, "I" can validly refer either to Reel 
or to Rec2.I. The question is, which? Some Pas- 
cal compilers disallow this kind of confusion al- 
together and refuse to process the WITH-clause 
given in WithTest. Others, including the Apple 
version, make an arbitrary choice to resolve the 
problem. (And not all compilers make the same 
arbitrary choice, or scan the WITH-list in the 
same order!) Whether to view this compiler be- 
havior as a nasty "bug" or a convenient "fea- 
ture" is entirely up to you. In general, though, 
it's a good idea to avoid the use of ambiguous 
WITH-lists. Not only will this practice help to 
eliminate confusion for you, it will also contrib- 
ute to the production of programs that will 
compile under systems other than Apple 
Pascal. 

Here's one final piece of advice concerning 
WITH: Bear in mind that the effect of any 
WITH-clause extends only to the text of the 
statement guarded by it, not to the text of any 
procedures or functions that are called by that 
statement. Thus, in a statement such as 
"WITH MyRec DO SomeProc", where Some- 
Proc is a PROCEDURE, the WITH-clause is 
worthless, as WITH cannot act upon any of the 
statements within SomeProc's body. 

RAMming a Growing Town into a Tiny 
Apple. When Home consisted merely of an ac- 
count number, the model of a single Home oc- 
cupied only two bytes in RAM; in other words, 
SizeOf(Horne) returned the value 2, and Size- 
Of(Town) therefore returned 7992. Now that 
Home is a somewhat more sophisticated rec- 
ord structure, SizeOf(Home) takes up 1 14 bytes. 
If we were to retain the old structure of a Town 
(four streets, each containing 999 houses), the 
new SizeOf(Town) would be 455,544 bytes! 
With a maximum RAM complement of 65,536 
bytes (only some of which are available for your 
programs), the Apple II cannot begin to ac- 
commodate such a monster. It cannot even con- 
tain just one Street, since 999 Homes would re- 
quire 1 13,886 bytes. In fact, no array or record 
defined in Apple Pascal may occupy more than 
16,384 bytes of RAM. Because of this limita- 



tion, the compiler issues an error message (#399, 
"implementation restriction") upon encounter- 
ing the declaration of the Street type. 

Even seemingly trivial alterations to key 
data structures can force massive changes in a 
program's memory requirements. Adding just 
one byte to the base type of an array that con- 
tains 1 ,000 elements increases the total memory 
consumption of the associated program by 
1,000 bytes. Since Town is an array that in- 
cludes 3,996 Homes, it is folly to increase the 
size of a Home from 2 bytes to 114. 

Programmers are always needing more 
memory than their computers provide. When 
your data structures grow too large for your 
computer, you have two avenues of recourse: 
decreasing the gross size of large structures or 
employing smaller data types in building them. 
In the case of Cable, we can shorten a Street, de- 
crease the number of Streets in a Town, elimi- 
nate information fields from a Home, or do a 
little bit of each. Of course, the clever reader will 
realize that we may also rewrite the program so 
that it deals with only a small segment of a large 
Town at any given time, storing the remainder 
on disk. Such advanced techniques, however, 
are best left for a future discussion. 

For now, let's assume that the company us- 
ing the Cable program absolutely requires all 
the information stored in our new version of 
Home; that is, we do not have the option of 
modifying the record definition. This being so, 
it would be futile to decrease the number of 
Streets in a Town, since even one Street is too 
big for the Apple IPs memory. Consequently, 



what we must do is decrease the number of 
Homes on a Street. It's easily done; we need 
only change the constant MaxHNum, then re- 
compile. 

For purposes of discussion, we'll assume 
that MaxHNum now has the value 10. In other 
words, house numbers on any street will range 
from 1 to 10. Why use such a small number? 
Program code and data compete for memory 
resources within your Apple, so it's generally a 
good idea to "shrink" large arrays temporarily, 
during initial program development. This leaves 
ample room within memory for the developing 
program itself to grow to the size and complex- 
ity required to deal with the task at hand. Once 
the program is finished and works well, you 
may enlarge any "restricted" arrays to more ap- 
propriate sizes, depending on the amount of un- 
used RAM that remains. 

Now for the Hard Part. Unfortunately, 
changing the definition of a Home is only part 
of the job we face in upgrading Cable. Now that 
the data definition has changed, the code we 
wrote to access, display, and modify Home data 
is obsolete. More to the point, if you make the 
changes just mentioned, the new version of Ca- 
ble will fail to compile. This is because data and 
program code are ultimately inseparable; if you 
change the structure or nature of your data, you 
must almost always change at least part of ev- 
ery program that accesses or manipulates that 
data. 

As an example of the interdependency be- 
tween programs and data, consider the follow- 
ing assignment statement, taken from the pro-

T[Redwood][HNow] := NoSubscriber; 

Recall that NoSubscriber is a constant, equiva- 
lent to the Integer value 0. Given the new defini- 
tion of Home, T[Redwood][HNow] is no long- 
er simply a number. Thus, the assignment just 
given would be tagged by the compiler as 
"illegal." 

Code such as that just given is said to be ex- 
tremely "data-sensitive," as it is most intolerant 
of changes in the data structures it manipu- 
lates. In this case, the assignment statement em- 
bodies assumptions — about the multidimen- 
sional matrix nature of T, and about the com- 
position of the Home data type. After a modifi- 
cation to any of the types Town, Street, or 
Home, these assumptions would almost cer- 
tainly fail to hold — thus rendering the state- 
ment inappropriate and obsolete. In contrast, 

T[SNow] := T[Redwood] 

makes fewer assumptions about the composi- 
tion of T and none at all about that of an indi- 
vidual Home, so it will survive more extensive 
modifications to the data definitions. In fact, so 
long as T can be considered as an ARRAY OF 
Street, indexed by values of type StreetName, 
the assignment "T[SNow] := T[Redwood]" 
works, no matter how Street or Home is 
defined. 

When you design a program, one of your 
aims should be to permit easy modification of 
fundamental data structures. You can do this 
by treating data-sensitive code most carefully, in 
accordance with three rules: 

1. Minimize it. 

2. Whenever possible, gather it all together 
in one part of a program. 

3. Make it highly conspicuous in the pro- 
gram listing, especially when it cannot be con- 
centrated in a single place. 

When you change a data structure, you 
must find all the code that is sensitive to that 
structure and modify it to respect the new defi- 
nition. As it turns out, Cable obeys the first and 
second rules, at least as far as the Home data 
type is concerned, by concentrating its small 
amount of Home-sensitive code in the three 
routines — DisplayHome, NewTown, and 
ChangeTown. 

Notice that DisplayTown contains no 
Home-sensitive code because it relies on Dis- 
playHome to do the actual work of displaying 
each individual Home. Display Town's code 
concerns itself instead with determining which 
Homes are to be displayed during a given ses- 
sion, and with directing DisplayHome to each 
such Home in turn. None of these activities re- 
quires a knowledge of Home's structure. 

To improve DisplayHome, you must decide 
upon an appropriate display format for the en- 
larged information set and then code the neces- 
sary data conversions and output statements. 
Remember that DisplayHome is not only used 
by DisplayTown, but also by ChangeTown; the 
display format you choose must suit the needs 
of both routines.

body really needs to know how a Home is con- 
structed; this is the code that actually acquires 
the new information from the user and puts that 
information into a Home. The rest of Change- 
Town merely governs the Home-by-Home scan 
of the area of the Town selected by the user. In 
addition to modifying the Home-sensitive code, 
you might also isolate it in a subsidiary routine 
named ChangeHome (analogous to Display- 
Home), which would control the interactive up- 
dating of a single Home. Doing so would be an 
example of "planning ahead" for even more 
changes to the Home data structure. 

For completeness, you could also imple- 
ment NewHome, which would empty a single 
Home by Filling it with a "matched set" of 
"empty" values. NewTown could then scan 
through a Town, calling NewHome to do the 
actual initialization of a Home. However, New- 
Town itself is so small that it almost seems silly 
to create a "slave" routine for it. Whether you 
put the Home-sensitive code in a separate rou- 
tine or modify it in place within NewTown, 
your challenge will be to choose a sensible set of 
Field values that constitutes an "empty" Home. 

A Second Anniversary Contest. We've con- 
cerned ourselves here with the general issues in- 
volved in improving any substantial program, 
illustrating our points with examples taken from 
Cable. Yet we have not actually gone so far as 
to present a complete, updated version of that 
program. It is left to you to modify Display- 
Home, NewTown, and ChangeTown to suit 
our new Home. To encourage you to under- 
take this challenging exercise, and to celebrate 
the second anniversary of the Pascal Path, Sof- 
talk is offering prizes for the best versions of 
"SuperCable," submitted by readers. Here are 
the rules for the competition: 

1. Submit all entries to Softalk SuperCa- 
ble, Box 60, North Hollywood, CA 91603. All 
entries must be received at the offices of Softalk 
on or before March 15, 1983. The winners' 
names will be announced in the June 1983 issue 
of Softalk. 

2. Prizes will be awarded in two divisions: 
beginner (less than one year of formal training 
and no commercial experience) and ad- 
vanced/professional (more than one year of for- 
mal training or any commercial programming 
experience). The winner in each division will re- 
ceive $50 worth of merchandise from the retail- 
er of their choice. 

3. All entries must be submitted in source 
form as text Files on Apple II Pascal format 
disks. Each disk submitted must bear the name, 
address, and phone number of the author on 
the label only. If the source program or disk di- 
rectory identiFies the entrant in any way, he or 
she will be disqualified. The label must also 
clearly indicate the division (beginner or ad- 
vanced/professional) in which the entry is to be 
classed. Any entries without such indication will 
be judged by the stricter standards of the ad- 
vanced/professional division. 

4. No set of entry disks will be returned un- 
less it is accompanied by a self-addressed disk 
mailer type envelope and stamped with suffi- 
cient postage for the class of mail marked on the 



envelope. All sets of disks returned will include 
source Files for the First-place program from the 
advanced/professional division. Anyone who 
wishes to receive this program without entering 
the competition must still submit a blank Pas- 
cal-formatted disk, along with a stamped, self- 
addressed return disk mailer type envelope. 

5. All disks submitted under the terms of 
this competition must be free of defects. Un- 
readable or damaged disks will be discarded; 
the entries associated with them will be dis- 
qualified. Therefore, pack your disks carefully! 

6. If more than one entry is received from 
any individual before the deadline, only the en- 
try postmarked last will be judged. 

7. Any entry that contains a copyright no- 
tice will be disqualified. All other program sub- 
missions will enter the public domain. 

Completing the SuperCable program will 
test both your command of the Pascal system 
and language and your understanding of the 
software development principles we've studied 
so far. It won't be easy, but it should be fun. 
You have nothing to lose by entering the con- 
test, and a lot of good experience to gain (not to 
mention some great prizes), so get cracking, and 
good luck! 

Coming: A Tour through the Hall of Mir- 
rors. Most mail addressed to this column re- 
quests coverage of one or both of two tough 
topics: recursion and the meaning and use of 
compiler directives (speciFically, the "U— " com- 
pilation mode). If you've followed the Pascal 
Path to this point, then you are certainly ready 
to explore both of these subjects, although you 
are hereby warned that the going is apt to be 
rough, even for the expert programmer! 

Anyone who has ever arranged two mirrors 
so that each reflects the image of the other will 
certainly remember the "endless corridor" of 
mirror images thus created in both reflective 
surfaces. The First mirror contains an image of 
the second, which contains a smaller image of 
the first, which contains an even smaller image 
of the second, and so on, until the corridor thus 
created fades into the green depths of the glass. 
This commonplace, yet fascinating, phenome- 
non is an example of recursion: the technique of 
defining an object or method in terms of itself 
(or several objects in terms of each other). At 
first glance, you might be confused by — or at 
least question the usefulness of — the seemingly 
circular reasoning that underlies recursion. 
With practice, however, you'll soon be com- 
fortable with this very powerful method of cut- 
ting many a knotty problem down to size. And, 
next month, you'll get plenty of practice!

Why does 

EDU WARE bother 

to meet 
individual 
needs? 




Have you ever met an 
"average" learner? The 
reality is that every learner 
brings to the curriculum at 
hand a distinct combination 
of skills — at any age, in 
home or classroom. Given 
the reality, solutions to 
learning needs must 
somehow focus on the 
individual. 

Edu-Ware focuses on the 
needs of the individual 
learner. Use its Computer 
Based Instruction (CBI) to 
achieve specific learning 
objectives: 

Accelerate — Gifted 
students need 
opportunities to advance 
beyond their classmates. 
Edu-Ware helps them 
follow their own pace and 
ensures continuing 
motivation. 

Remediate — Deficiencies 
in core skills sometimes 
limit a learner's success 
in an entire subject. 
Edu-Ware can be 
fine-tuned to the 



individual's abilities in 
distinct skill areas; give the 
right feedback at the right 
time; alleviate frustration. 

Reinforce — Learners 
sometimes run into hurdles 
in their work which they 
need help to bridge. For 
them Edu-Ware's benefits 
are 1) precise definition 
of skills taught in each 
system and 2) a patient, 
non-threatening approach. 

Refresh — At one time or 
another, nearly everyone 
wants to brush up on skills. 
Edu-Ware offers adults 
and young learners alike 
an effective way to review. 
Edu-Ware helps solve 
learnin g needs each step of 
the wa y . . . because some 
learners require a helping 
(animated) hand or carefully 
monitored instruction, while 
others are prepared to 
manage their own learning. 

For young learners, 
ARITHMETIC SKILLS™ uses 
high resolution displays and 
minimum text to establish 
basic math skills — addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, 
and division. 



EDU-WARE. Because solution means more than keeping them busy. 



The Learning Manager 
Systems in FRACTIONS and 
DECIMALS let specific 
parameters (i.e. number or 
subject of test problems, 
sequence, sound effects) be 
tailored to the individual. 

The ALGEBRA SERIES, 
a sequence of five 
independent packages, 
together comprise a 
first-year algebra course. Its 
learners have already 
acquired basic math skills. 
Selecting to work in one or 
more "learning styles," each 
individual is encouraged to 
achieve an increased level 
of self-management. 

Edu-Ware can make the 
difference in Lan g ua g e Arts. 
Often that difference means 
adaptability to a wide range 
of learners. 

Teachers participating in 
an MECC evaluation of 
COMPU-READ reported: 
"Students liked the 
programs . . . they really had 
to concentrate. It was 
surprising how even the 
youngest children stayed on 
task."* COMPU-READ is a 
tool for improving reading 
speed and recall because it 
works with the reader (child 
through adult), matching 
pace to performance. 

COMPU-SPELL teaches 
spelling by positive 
reinforcement. With 
Data Levels 4-8 it will 
accommodate up to sixty 
learners, yet gives each 
individual vocabulary suited 
to his or her needs. 
COMPU-SPELL with the 



Adult/Secretarial level 
becomes a tool for 
mastering words common in 
business, industry, and 
college. 

Edu-Ware hel ps you to 
prepare , whether for the 
college board or the 
business world. 

Word attack skills are 
tools of analysis which give 
you an edge on mastering 
vocabulary, deciphering 
new or unfamiliar words, 
and taking tests. SAT and 
PSAT" WORD ATTACK 
SKILLS are tutorials which 
give college-bound students 
that edge. 

New tools called 
I nteractive Simulations™ — 
Demonstration aids 
learning, especially in 
subjects like Earth Science 
and Physics. 

RENDEZVOUS accurately 
simulates, in 3-D animation, 
the orbital flight of a space 
shuttle craft. It will 
demonstrate exact systems 
of ballistics and orbital 
mechanics or the 
disorienting effects of 
inertial space. Use it tr test 
the limits of learners' ver 
13) physics understana ng, 
mathematical judgment, 
and perceptual skill. 

Learning companions for 
the ver y youn g. Children 3-6 
are taking their first steps 
toward "computer literacy." 
With animation and 
easy-to-read, high 
resolution graphics, 
Edu-Ware's "BEEs" make 
learning comforttjle and 




fun without forfeiting 
carefully managed 
instruction. 

Children work intently 
with SPELLING BEE AND 
READING PRIMER, 
discovering basic concepts 
about words, spelling, 
and reading. Capturing 
attention, COUNTING BEE 
introduces young learners 
to numbers. 

Walk into your local 
computer dealership and 



ask for a demonstration 
of Edu-Ware. You'll see 
the difference.

THE ANIMATED APPLE 
With Gra Forth 

Part 6 

BV PAUL LUTUS AND PHIL THOMPSON 



As a graphics language, GraForth's usual emphasis lies in creating 
fast hi-res animations. One feature that is frequently overlooked is Gra- 
Forth's ability to produce music using a built-in synthesizer. In this col- 
umn we'll explore GraForth's sound capabilities, with examples of sound 
effects and a song-generating program. 

The music synthesizer is controlled by two GraForth words, note and 
voice. Note actually plays the notes and voice determines the tone qual- 
ity of the notes played. 

Note removes two numbers from the stack, for pitch and duration. 
Greater pitch numbers produce lower notes, and greater duration values 
increase the time the note plays. Both pitch and duration numbers can 
range from 2 to 255. For example, 

255 255 NOTE 

plays a low note with a long duration. 

50 2 NOTE 

plays a very short, medium-pitched note. In fact, the note is almost too 
short to be recognized as more than a click. However, curious effects can 
be obtained by repeating short notes: 

25 0 DO 50 2 NOTE LOOP 

By experimenting and choosing appropriate values, you can play 
music. The following word definition plays the first phrase from 
"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star." 

: TWINKLE 
104 100 NOTE 



104 100 NOTE 
69 100 NOTE 
69 100 NOTE 
62 100 NOTE 
62 100 NOTE 
69 150 NOTE ; 

Notes played using the note command can be given any one of a 
number of tone qualities, or voices, with the GraForth command voice. 
Voice removes a number from the stack to select the tone quality that 
will be used for subsequent note commands. Valid voice numbers range 
from —6 to 2. 

Values from -6 to -1 for voice produce notes with constant vol- 
ume. Each voice has a different volume and tone quality. The loudest 
note with the flattest sound is produced by -1 voice. (Voice values less 
than —2 sometimes produce inconsistent volumes for notes of different 
pitches and are more suitable for sound effects than music.) 

The values 0 through 2 produce notes with varying volumes. A note 
played with 0 voice begins loudly, then dies away. The value 1 causes a 
note to increase in volume, then decrease again. A note with an increas- 
ing volume can be generated with 2 voice. 

When GraForth first starts up, 0 voice is set automatically. You 
might want to try the Twinkle routine after setting various voices: 

-1 VOICE TWINKLE 
-3 VOICE TWINKLE 
2 VOICE TWINKLE 

On page 9-4 of the GraForth manual is a table of musical notes and 
their corresponding pitch numbers. This table was used to determine the 
pitch numbers for the above Twinkle example. Note that the numbers 
104, 69, and 62 refer to the notes C, G, and A respectively. 

For short musical phrases, manually looking each pitch up in a table

is satisfactory. For longer tunes, however, this can quickly become 
tedious. The Compute. Notes example in the manual solves this problem 
by creating a pitch table in the Apple's memory. The table has forty-eight 
entries spanning four octaves. By indexing into the table, the notes can 
now be represented with the numbers 0 through 47. 

The examples on page 9-5 in the manual are inconsistent. Note that 
the definition of Getpitch and the first example have Getpitch print the 
pitch value on the screen. Subsequent examples do not print the value 
but leave it on the stack to be used by the note command. The definition 
and the first example should be changed to agree with the other 
examples. Here is the correct definition for Getpitch: 

: GETPITCH PITCH PEEK ; 

Pitch and Compute. Notes must have already been compiled and 
Compute. Notes must have been executed for these examples to work. 
Getpitch can be used to convert a note number into a pitch value to be 
used by the note routine. This example (correcting the example in the 
manual) prints the pitch value for note number 3, which is a C in the first 
octave: 

3 GETPITCH . 
209 

Here the pitch value is actually used to play the note: 

3 GETPITCH 128 NOTE 

The following word definition is equivalent to the Twinkle routine, 
except that Getpitch is used to retrieve the pitch value for each note. The 
actual note names are included in the comments: 

: TWINKLE2 

15 GETPITCH 100 NOTE ( C, octave 2 ) 
15 GETPITCH 100 NOTE 



22 GETPITCH 100 NOTE ( G, octave 2 ) 

22 GETPITCH 100 NOTE 

24 GETPITCH 100 NOTE ( A, octave 3 ) 

24 GETPITCH 100 NOTE 

22 GETPITCH 150 NOTE ; ( G, octave 2 ) 

The note command is designed for playing notes, but it has no built- 
in capacity for playing rests of a similar duration. The following word, 
rest, removes a duration number from the stack and simply waits for this 
amount of time. The durations used are nearly identical to those used 
by note: 

: REST 

45 * 0 DO LOOP ; 

This example will play two quarter notes of C in the first octave, sep- 
arated by a quarter note rest: 

3 GETPITCH 64 NOTE 64 REST 3 GETPITCH 64 NOTE 

Music Playing Programs. As you can guess by the Twinkle2 exam- 
ple, playing entire songs by entering a long string of note commands can 
take a lot of time and use a lot of memory. A program that allows you to 
enter songs in a more convenient form, optionally save them to disk, and 
play them at any time would be much more efficient. The easiest way to 
enter notes would be to type in the note names as text. This text must 
then be converted into numeric pitch and duration values for the note 
command. 

The programs in listings 1 and 2 use a two-step approach to generat- 
ing and playing music. Using the first program, Compile. Song, you can 
enter note names and durations from the keyboard, or you can have the 
program read the commands from a text file on disk. Compile.Song con- 
verts these lines into a list of note numbers in memory. This song list can 
be saved back to disk as a binary file. The second program, Play.Song, 
reads the values from the list and calls note repeatedly to play each note

in turn. In addition to playing notes, Compile.Song and Play. Song also 
allow you to play rests and change voices during the song. 

The two-step technique used by these programs is similar to the 
method used by the Profile program for creating 3-D graphics. Profile 
converts a set of X,Y points in a text format into a list of 3-D image 
values in memory. This image is then used by GraForth's 3-D routines to 
draw a 3-D object. This similarity should help clarify the way these music 
programs work. 

Using the GraForth text editor (or another DOS-compatible text edi- 
tor, if you have one), enter the program in listing 1 into memory and save 
it to disk with the name Compile.Song. 

The Compile.Song file is somewhat long. If you are using the Gra- 
Forth text editor without a language card or RAM card, you will need to 
adjust the editor program position to allot enough memory for the file. 
Enter the editor, type P to select program position, type Y, and then 
enter a new position of 34000. This will provide enough room for the 
Compile.Song file. 

After Compile.Song is saved to disk, enter the program in listing 2, 
saving it as Play. Song. ' 

Here are instructions for using these programs: 

To create a new song file, first load Compile.Song into memory and 
run it: 

READ " COMPILE.SONG " 
RUN 

On the screen will appear 

GraForth Song Compiler 
Enter Song File Address : 2816 

This question determines where the numeric song list will appear in 
memory. Press return to accept the address of 2816, or enter a new ad- 
dress. Next you will see: 

[Keyboard or [D]isk? 
You can enter the formatted music lines from the keyboard or have 



J 213 

the program read the lines from a text file on disk. For this example, 
press K for keyboard entry.

What does it do? 

THE TUTOR provides the student with a study 
tool that he can tailor to his own study needs or 
that dictated by his teacher or course material. 

How does it do this? 

THE TUTOR guides the student in creating a quiz 
of questions and answers from his subject/course 
material which is then saved on a disk. The 
student can then run the quiz as often as he 
wants to study the material and be graded on his 
progress in learning the material. 

What computer do I need? 

Apple II or Apple II Plus (*), 48K, with at least 1 
disk drive (DOS 3.3). 

What do I need to know? 

You only need to know how to turn on your Apple, 
put a disk in your disk drive, and be able to 
initialize an unused disk. THE TUTOR will instruct 



you each step of the way in creating your quizzes, 
how to run them, and how to make changes to 
them. 

Why is this a good study tool? 

-THE TUTOR never gets angry at you if you do not 
answer your questions correctly. It simply tells 
you what the correct answers are. 

- THE TUTOR gives positive reinforcement when 
you answer questions correctly, and gives you a 
running percentage of correct responses. 

- THE TUTOR can ask you questions in the 
sequential order in which the questions were first 
created, or it can scramble the questions in 
random order to make sure you haven't just 
learned a pattern of responses. 

- THE TUTOR also allows you to review just the 
questions you miss until you can achieve 100% 
correct responses. 

What kind of limits will I encounter? 

- THE TUTOR will create any number of quizzes, 
however, each quiz is limited to 50 questions. 



- Each question withinaquizishmitedtolOlines. 

- There may be from 1 to 5 valid answers for each 
question (one line per answer). 

- There may be up to 10 lines of an information 
paragraph, or answer table, which could appear 
with your quesitons and answers. 

What forms can the questions take? 

The form the questions take is limited only by 
your imaginiation. THE TUTOR provides 2 very 
flexible vehicles with which to build your quizzes: 

1 . Simple questions and answers which include 
direct questions and answers, multiple choice 
questions, and fill in the blanks. 

2. A series of questions that are related to an 
answer table, information paragraph, or matching 
test table. Up to 10 lines of information (or 
possible answers) can appear on the upper half 
of the screen, while a series of related questions 
appear on the lower half of the screen.

You can enter commands to play a note or rest, change voices, or end the 
song. Here is the format for a note command 

1. optional spaces 

2. octave number 

3. optional spaces 

4. note name 

5. at least one space 

6. duration value 

The octave number corresponds to the octave numbers in the table 
on page 9-4, ranging from 1 to 4. The note name is a letter from A to G. 
You can also add # to the letter for a sharp, or / for a flat. The duration 
value is simply the number used by note for duration. Here are some 
sample note commands you can enter. Notice how each command fol- 
lows the above format. Entering these example entries will produce the 
"Shave and a Haircut" tune.

Rests are entered by typing an R followed by a space and the desired 
rest value. Here is the next entry as an example: 

Music Command (E = end) : R 120 

The voice used can be changed by typing a V and the new voice num- 
ber (no space is necessary). Here is the example entry: 

Music Command (E=end) : V-1 

The tune is finished with the following entries: 

Music Command (E = end) : 2B 60 
Music Command (E = end) : R 60 
Music Command (E=end) : 2C 60 



The command to end the song (as you might have guessed from the 
prompt) is the letter E. This is required as the last entry of the song. 

Music Command (E=end) : E 

The program will inform you that you entered twelve lines, which have 
been converted into a number list twenty-four bytes long. You will then 
be asked if you want to save the list to disk. For this example, press Y. 
You will be prompted for a file name. Type shave and press return. This 
disk will whir as the list is saved as a binary file named Shave, and the 
program will end. 

Compile. Song can also read music commands from a text file on disk. 
To compile songs using this method, first use the GraForth text editor to 
create a list of music commands, then save them as a text file. When run- 
ning Compile. Song, select the disk option (D), and then enter the file 
name of the text file, The program will read the commands from the file 
and compile them as if they were entered at the keyboard. The advan- 
tage to this technique is that a music text file can be modified or correct- 
ed using the text editor and then recompiled into a numeric song list. 
Keyboard entries must be reentered every time. 

The program also includes error checking. If it can't interpret a line 
as a valid music command, or if a number is out of range, an error mes- 
sage will be printed. This message includes the line number where the er- 
ror occurred and a display of the illegal line. The program stops compil- 
ing lines when it finds an error. The program will also exit if you press 
control-C or control-C and return for an input. 

Assuming no errors occurred, a sample song list is now in memory, 
beginning at location 2816, and also on disk. To play the song, first load 
Play.Song into memory: 

READ " PLAY.SONG " 

Place the starting location of the song list (2816) on the stack, then 
execute Play.Song: 

2816 PLAY.SONG

The "Shave and a Haircut" tune should play. Whenever a song is 
playing, pressing any key will immediately stop the song. 

With the song list saved to disk, the song can be loaded into memory 
and played at any time. Simply bload the song list into a free area of 
memory, read Play. Song onto the word library, and call it with the start- 
ing address of the song on the stack. 

A list of Compile. Song music commands for the final part of "Stars 
and Stripes Forever" can be found in listing 3. This provides an example 
of a longer song generated with these music programs. 

Song List Format. In last month's column we described the format 
for three-dimensional images in memory. In the interest of equal time, 
we'll discuss the song list format here. 

Each note entry in the list is stored as a pair of bytes in memory. The 
Play. Song program reads each byte pair in turn and determines whether 
each byte is zero or nonzero. The function performed (note, rest, voice, 
or end) is determined by this test as follows: 

1st byte 2nd byte Function 

nonzero nonzero Note 

zero nonzero Rest 

nonzero zero Voice 

zero zero End song 

For the note function, the first byte contains the pitch value and the 
second byte is the duration. The nonzero byte for rest determines the du- 
ration of the rest. For the voice function, the nonzero value is seven 
greater than the voice to be selected. Adding seven guarantees that the 
voice number in memory will be nonzero. The Play. Song program sub- 
tracts seven to convert it back to a valid voice number. A pair of zeros 
flags the end of the song. 

Watching the Keyboard. There is one aspect of the GraForth note 
command that should be mentioned here. While playing a note, the word 
note also looks at the keyboard. If a key is pressed while a note is play- 
ing, the note will be cut short. Try executing 

100 255 NOTE 



and press a key before the note would normally finish. The note will end 
abruptly. This feature was included to give users the ability to stop the 
sound without having to wait for the note to end. There is one minor 
drawback, however: if a key is pressed before the note begins, the note 
routine will still sometimes click the speaker for a short moment. For a 
demonstration of this effect, enter the following line and press a key 
while the first note is still playing 

10 0 DO 100 255 NOTE LOOP 

The flutter noise is caused by the subsequent nine notes all clicking 
the speaker in turn. While this type of effect can sometimes be desirable 
(it is used purposely in some sound effects routines), it is usually un- 
wanted. Two solutions are possible: Either stop playing notes if a key has 
been pressed, or clear the keyboard after every note. This second ap- 
proach continues the string of notes, cutting only one note short at each 
keypress. Here are examples of both techniques. Try pressing a key while 
running each: 

10 0 DO GETKEY 128 < IF 100 255 NOTE THEN LOOP 
10 0 DO CLRKEY 100 255 NOTE LOOP 

The note routine itself can be directly modified so that it either ig- 
nores keypresses altogether or always acts as if a key has been pressed. In 
game applications with a lot of sound effects, ignoring keypresses can 
make the sound cleaner. (Once this modification is made, you can make 
the change permanent if you want to by saving the GraForth system 
back to disk with Saveprg.) To force note to ignore keypresses, type: 

24686 24687 POKEW 
To cause note to behave as if a key has been pressed, type: 

24688 24687 POKEW 
Note can be returned to normal by entering 

-16384 24687 POKEW 31

Hayden Applesoft Compiler Plus. 

Speed is what you buy a compiler for. And no compiler runs faster in serious number-crunching 
than Compiler Plus, because no compiler offers its unique array-vector lookup technique. 
But speed isn't all you get. With its DOS relocation software, Compiler Plus lets users with 
16K RAM cards compile and execute larger programs using the added memory. 
Wait, there's more. You can develop modular programs— with disk overlays, if you like— by taking 
advantage of Compiler Plus's ability to call compiled programs as subroutines. The compiler supports the 
sharing of variables between modules in a common data area. The library of runtime routines is fully 
relocatable, and you can load it anywhere in memory or include it as part of the compiled code. 
Even that isn't all. Compiler Phis recognizes the broadest range of Applesoft keywords, 
including the "&" token. So interfacing with assembly language routines is easier. 
By now, you think you're looking at an expensive bit of software. But you're wrong. 
The Hayden Applesoft Compiler Plus is actually one of the lowest priced Applesoft Compilers available. 
Speed, of course. Memory, too, and modularity and compatibility. All for less than you'd expect: just $99.95. 
One more reason to be glad you chose Apple— and Hayden.

Everyone's Guide to Assembly Language, Part 29 

I /O routines are responsible for handling the computer's communi- 
cations with the outside world. Their design is also one of the more in- 
teresting aspects of machine language programming. We'll spend the 
next two issues learning how to intercept the I/O vectors of the Apple 
and implement our own routines. 

It will make the next few demonstrations much easier if you discon- 
nect DOS from the I/O system. That's most easily done by running this 
short Applesoft Basic program: 

10 IN#0:PR#0:END 
That will keep DOS out of the way for the upcoming exercises. 

Output. In earlier issues we discussed how COUT ($FDED) could be 
used to print characters to the screen, to disk, or to other output devices. 
The general procedure was to load the accumulator with the ASCII 
value for the character you wanted to print, and then to do a JSR 
COUT. 

To see what happens at SFDED when you do this, enter the Moni- 
tor by means of the usual call —151. Then type in: 

FDEDL 

The first instruction listed should be a J MP ($0036). This is an indi- 
rect jump to a location pointed to by the byte pair $36,37. To see where 
these bytes are currently pointing, type in: 

36.37 

You should get: 
0036- F0 FD 

This tells you that the jump will be made to $FDF0, which in this 
case happens to be the next instruction after the JMP ($0036). $FDF0 is 
called COUT1 and is used only to print characters to the Apple's screen. 
When output is going to the disk, to the printer, or to some other device, 
$36,37 will point somewhere other than $FDF0. 

If you are sending characters to a printer, for example, $36,37 might 
point to $002. CSW (for Character output SWitch) is the name given to 
the byte pair $36,37. A pointer such as this is usually called a vector, in 
that it directs the flow of program control to whatever routine (that is, 
whatever address in memory) is appropriate at the moment. 

The changing of the CSW vector is what happens when you execute a 
pr# command. CSW is pointed to the address OzOO, where n is the slot 
number given in the pr#« statement. If no device is present in the slot, 
then no program will be found at $C/iQ0. This explains why a Basic pro- 
gram hangs when an improper pr# command is given. The computer is 
waiting for the final RTS from a nonexistent routine. To verify for your- 
self that the lockup doesn't occur until a character is output, run this pro- 
gram in Applesoft Basic: 

10 HOME 

20 PR#5: REM OR SOME OTHER EMPTY SLOT 

30 FOR 1 = 1 TO 20 

40 POKE 1024 + 1,192+1 

50 NEXT I 

60 PRINT "YOU WONT SEE THIS" 

When you run this program, you should see the letters A through T 
printed on the screen, but the phrase on line 60 should not appear. 
Things happen this way because the loop on lines 20 through 40 puts the 
data directly into the screen memory without going through COUT. 

Remember that all this time CSW is pointing to $C500. It's only 



when the Y character gets sent to COUT that the computer hangs. 

If DOS were installed and line 20 said print chr$(4);"pr#5", the pro- 
gram would hang on that statement because of the carriage return sent at 
the end of the print statement. It's instructive to note that the carriage re- 
turn is not actually needed for the pr# to work. Adding a semicolon to 
the print statement would restore the program to its original semifunc- 
tional state. 

One would think from the preceding thoughts that hooking up a rou- 
tine to the output hooks would be fairly simple. The problem is that most 
of the time you'll want to have DOS active, and DOS has been cleverly 
designed to do everything possible to keep itself connected. When DOS 
is installed, CSW actually points to $9EBD, a portion of DOS, and it's 
very difficult to get it to point elsewhere. 

Specifically, whenever either input or output is done, both vectors are 
checked to make sure DOS is still hooked up. This means that, even 
though you could temporarily change CSW, any input-type action 
would cause DOS to restore itself to the output flow. Here's a program 
to show this. You'll need to reconnect DOS (pressing reset will do that) 
to try it: 

10 HOME 
20 PR#0 

30 PRINT CHR$(4);"CATALOG" 

40 INPUT "TURN THINGS BACK ON";l$ 

50 PRINT CHR$(4);"CATALOG" 

The theory here is that the pr#0 sets CSW to point directly to 
$FD0C, rather than to DOS. This is why the catalog doesn't work in line 
30. However, when the input is done, DOS is still hooked up to the in- 
put vector. Realizing that the output connection has been lost, DOS thus 
reconnects itself. Line 40 then performs as expected. 

In general, DOS can be disconnected by executing both an in#0 and a 
pr#0 within a Basic program, provided that one is done immediately af- 
ter the other with no input or output done in between. The one-line Ba- 
sic program used at the beginning of this article to disconnect DOS em- 
ploys this principle. 

Pressing reset will hook things back up any time you want. Notice 
that these are not done as DOS commands such as: 

10 PRINT CHR$(4);"IN#0": PRINT CHR$(4);"PR#0" 

An in#0 or pr#0 as a direct Basic command redirects I/O to the 
Monitor. The same commands done as DOS commands set the I/O 
to DOS. 

Let's see just how DOS does handle the output vectors. With DOS 
installed and active, enter the Monitor and type in the following 

36.37 AA53.AA54 

You should get: 

0036- BD 9E 
AA53- F0 FD 

With DOS active, CSW points to a main output entry point at 
$9EBD. This is the beginning of the section that watches the output for 
DOS commands. Eventually it does its own indirect jump via the vector 
at $AA53,AA54, which completes the path to COUT1 ($FDF0). 

When you do a JSR COUT (SFDED), then, here's the general flow 
of things: 

1. With the appropriate value in the accumulator, a JSR COUT 
(SFDED) is done.

2. At SFDED is a jump to the address specified in CSW ($36,37). 
With DOS installed, CSW points to DOS at $9EBD. 

3. When DOS is through looking at the character, it does a jump to 
the address held at $AA53,AA54. This normally points to $FDF0. 

4. Eventually an RTS returns control to the calling program. 
Intercepting Output. An obvious question now arises. How do we 

hook our routine to DOS? This basically depends on whether a slot is 
used or not. If you happened to be writing firmware for an interface 
card, for example, the pr# command when executed would automatical- 
ly handle the setting up of CSW to make everything work. If, however, 
you want to put a routine at a location other than the SCOOO space, 
another approach is needed. 

The procedure is actually fairly simple. All you need to do is set CSW 
to where you want the output to be eventually sent and then call $3EA. 

For example, let's put a trivial routine at $300 that merely jumps to 
COUT1 ($FDF0). Go into the Monitor and enter: 

300: 4C FO FD 

If you list this routine you should get: 

300L 

0300- 4C FO FD JMP$FDF0 

0303- 00 BRK 

0304- 00 BRK 

To hook it up, type in the following from the immediate mode of 
Applesoft: 

POKE 54,0: POKE 55,3: CALL 1002 

This sets CSW to point to $300 and then calls $3EA. The same thing 
can be done from within a machine language program with: 

LDA #$00 
STA $36 
LDA #$03 
STA $37 
JSR $3EA 
RTS 

Once connected in this way, everything will still look the same on the 
screen. In reality, however, every character going to the screen is now 
going through $300. You can check the new routing by entering the 
Monitor while this routine is installed and typing in: 

36.37 AA53.AA54 

You should get: 

0036- BD 9E 
AA53- 00 03 

The Monitor, DOS, and Basic all send output via the jump at 
COUT. This still points to DOS, but now DOS points not to COUT1 
($FDF0), but to $300. There, our routine does a jump to COUT1 to 
complete the flow. 

To verify that characters are going through $300, just type in poke 
768,0. Or, from the Monitor, type: 300: 0. 

The computer will immediately hang as program flow hits the 00 
(BRK instruction) at $300. The BRK routine in the Monitor will then try 
to send the break error message through COUT, at which point $300 will 
be called again and the process will repeat itself indefinitely. 

An interesting point here is that, when COUT is turned off (for in- 
stance, a simple RTS at $300 will do the trick), nothing appears on the 
screen, despite the fact that the computer is still fully functional. Even 
though you can't see what you're typing, you could type in catalog and 
the disk drive would come on. The flashing cursor would remain on the 
screen since RDKEY (part of the input routine at $FD1B) addresses the 
screen directly for the cursor. 

To experiment with COUT some more, let's try a routine that's a lit- 
tle more interesting. Control characters are normally "invisible" in that 
they're not sent to the screen by COUT1 . If we could detect the control 
character before it got to COUT1 and could change it to a different 
value, we could have it display as inverse or as some other visible 
character.

Normally all characters going through CSW have the high bit set. 
That is, all values are greater than $80. Inverse and flashing characters 
are created by sending characters with a value less than $80 to COUT. 
All characters in the range of $00 to $3F come out inverse, and all those 
from $40 to $7F are flashing. In general, what this means is that, if the 
high bit is cleared, control characters will come out in inverse and "stan- 
dard" characters in flashing. 

This is, in fact, how the flash and inverse commands of Applesoft 
work. The routine at COUT1 includes a portion that does an AND 
operation on the value about to be stored on the screen and a mask value 
stored at location $32 (called INVFLG, short for "inverse flag"). 
INVFLG normally holds an $FF, so no change takes place. However, 
the Basic commands inverse and flash set the values to $3F and $7F, re- 
spectively, which produces the desired results. 

The following diagram illustrates the INVFLG mask's effect on out- 
going characters:

The routine operation is very straightforward. A comparison is done 
as each character reaches the routine at $300. All "usual" characters are 
sent through to COUT1 unaltered. If a character is found to be a con- 
trol character, though, a test is done to see if it's a carriage return. If so, 
that too is passed to COUT1. After all, we do want the screen to look 
somewhat normal. If a control character (other than a return) is found, 
however, an AND with $3F converts the character to an inverse charac- 
ter, at which point it will be forwarded to COUT1. 

Any control characters generated by a program, with the exception 
of return (control-M), will now be shown in inverse. When typed from 
the keyboard, escape, the right arrow (control-U), and control-X won't 
show up since they are intercepted by the Monitor input routine and nev- 
er make it to COUT. 

Other Output Devices. So far, all we've done is intercept COUT, fil- 
ter the characters going through, and eventually return control to the 
Monitor screen routine COUT1. If we had our own output device, this 
would not be necessary. The point here is to demonstrate the possibility 
of alternate output devices. Ultimately this could include printer cards, 
terminals, analog devices such as motors, and more. Such projects are 
rather involved, however, so for now let's just see if we can write our own 
primitive screen routine. 

The basic model will be to set aside one line of the screen as our dis- 
play window and to attempt to control text output within that window. 
To avoid having to create vertical scrolling routines and cursor manage- 
ment routines, we'll limit all output to the single line and scroll text only 
to the left as each new character is displayed on the right. 

If this sounds suspiciously similar to a calculator display, you're 
right. It should be easy now to see why, with limited resources of display 
hardware and, more significantly, limited memory for management rou- 
tines, such a display would be desirable. 

Here's the summary of the design points:

1. Display will be limited to one line. 

2. Characters will be output on the rightmost position. 

3. The remainder of the line will scroll to the left to make room for 
each new character. 

4. No control characters will be displayed. 

5. The left arrow key, control-H, will be designated as a "clear dis- 
play" character. 

6. No editing capabilities (that is, backspace, forward copy, and so 
on) will be provided for, except for number 5 above. 

Before proceeding, let's digress for a moment to mention the value of 
the list as a programming technique. If you can't bring yourself to flow- 
chart, at least make a list to clarify exactly what the program will do. 
This helps organize your thoughts in a general way before you have to 
leap in and code the detailed parts. Even if you amend it as the coding 
progresses, such a list is helpful. Now back to our regularly scheduled

After the listing has been assembled, the routine is hooked up to 
COUT, just like the other routine. You will probably want to type in 
home to give you a clear screen for your display. Once your routine is in- 
stalled, everything you type should scroll across a line in the upper half of 
the screen. Notice that all expected output from the Apple is now done 
on its own custom display. You can list programs, catalog a disk, or do 
any of the usual operations. Try typing in this command line in 
Applesoft: 

FOR 1 = 1 TO 127:PRINTCHR$(I);:NEXTI 

When you press return, you should see a whole series of characters 
go whizzing through the window, ending with the lower-case letters (al- 
though they may not look quite right if you don't have a lower-case dis- 
play device). Remember, the left arrow will clear the display window. 

The routine itself is fairly simple. The only memory locations de- 
fined are the memory range for the screen line at $700, a temporary stor- 
age byte used by COUT1 , and our routine to preserve the contents of the 
Y register. The program also contains some instructive points of style. 

On entry, the Y register is saved. This is because the "official" out- 
put routine, COUTl, returns with all registers (A, X, and Y) intact when 
called. Many other routines in Basic and DOS assume that all output will 
be done as safely, so we must honor that convention as well. 



Once Y is saved, the value passed to this routine in the accumulator is 
appropriate to the ASCII value for the character to be printed. As was 
done in the control-character display routine, a check is done for control 
characters. Remember that in this program all control characters, even 
return, will be filtered out. If a control character is detected, the com- 
parison on line 12 will fail, and a check will be made for the left arrow 
(control-H). If the character is not a control-H, we will immediately exit 
via DONE1 , where the Y register will be restored and no character will 
be displayed. 

If a control-H is detected, the CLEAR routine clears the display win- 
dow to spaces. A note here about the BPL on line 20 to determine when 
the loop is done: You might think that we would want to use a BNE to 
find out when Y reached zero. The problem is that, when Y reached 
zero, the branch would fall through and we would not store a space at 
$700, so the leading character could not be cleared from the display 
window. 

Because we know that Y is started at $27, we can test for Y reaching 
the value of $FF as it "wraps around" after reaching zero. An alternate 
approach would have been to make line 18 say STA LINE— 1,Y and to 
start Y with a value of $28 on line 16. LINE— 1 would evaluate to $6FF, 
and thus we could use the BNE test. Either way works, but this second 
approach provides a way of showing another programming technique. 
After clearing the window, the routine returns via DONE1, again with- 
out displaying any new character. 

If a legitimate character is detected on lines 12 and 13, control flows 
to SCROLL, which makes room for the new character to be displayed. 
Because we'll need to use the accumulator for the scrolling, the character 
to be printed is pushed onto the stack to save it for future use. 

At that point, the Y register is set to $01 in preparation for the mem- 
ory move to follow. Line 26 loads a character from one position, after 
which line 27 will store the character in the position immediately to the 
left. For example, on the first pass through, the value will be loaded from 
$701 ($700,Y where Y=l) and stored at $700 ($6FF,Y where Y still 
equals 1). 

Notice the use of two different base addresses for the indexed ad- 
dressing. This allows us to use the same value in the Y register to load 
and store at two different addresses. The loop is repeated until we have 
moved all the characters one position to the left. The routine then falls in- 
to PRINT. 

PRINT first retrieves the character to be printed from the stack by 
means of the PLA on line 31. It then stores the character at $727. The 
code is written this way (LINE + $27) to show that you can, in most as- 
semblers, add any amount to an address. You aren't limited to the usual 
ADDR, ADDR+1 that's most often seen. 

After the character has been stored at $727, the Y register is restored 
and the routine returns via DONE2. 

You should verify for yourself that the accumulator and Y registers 
are always left in their original conditions regardless of whether the re- 
turn is done through DONE1 or DONE2. Since we didn't use theX reg- 
ister, it also will be preserved. 

Summary. Here are the main points of our discussion on the output 
vector. 

1 . The main output vector is called CSW, which stands for charac- 
ter output switch. CSW is the byte pair $36,37. 

2. DOS maintains its own output vector at $AA53,AA54. 

3. DOS can be disconnected by executing the Basic statement injfO: 
prjfO {not as a DOS command). 

4. DOS can be reconnected by pressing reset. 

5. Any attempt to alter CSW directly with DOS active will be un- 
done by DOS on the first input statement. 

6. To hook a routine into the output vectors, execute the equivalent 
oipoke 54, LB: poke 55,HB: call 1002 where LB and HB are the low and 
high order bytes of the address you wish output to be directed to. 

7. If you're handling all the final output, end the routine with the 
usual RTS. If you're merely filtering or watching the output, you must 
eventually pass control on to where the final output will be done, usually 
COUTl ($FDF0). 

Next time we'll look at the input hooks and at how to use your own 
routines on the listening side of the Apple. See you then! Hi

□ Mark Pelczarski has appointed Dave Al- 
bert marketing director of Penguin Software 

(Lake Geneva, IL). He will oversee all the com- 
pany's promotional activities, "keep the icebox 
full of beer," and generally take over the busi- 
ness concerns previously handled by Pel- 
czarski. President Pelczarski will be going into 
hibernation, penguin-style, to catch up on his 
programming. 

□ Multi-Media Video (Santa Clara, CA), ex- 
clusive international Apple distributor to the 
Middle East, is offering to translate suitable 
programs from software developers into Arabic 
on a license, royalty, or percentage basis. MMV 
has made hardware changes to the Apple II and 
III, making them fully functional Arabic micro- 
computers. For more information, contact Jef- 
frey Armstrong, manager of education and 
training. 

□ David Ferris speaks again! The outspoken 
software industry consultant sees hard row-hoe- 
ing ahead for corporate users of personal com- 
puters. Presenting the results of his latest study 
at the San Diego conference of the U.S. Trade 
Association for Data Processing Service Or- 
ganizations, Ferris said, in effect, that cor- 
porate users buy their micros to perform a few 
functions and wind up using them for a lot 
more than they planned — sending memos and 
documents, swapping database information 
with company mainframes, tying mainframe 
and micro financial modeling packages to- 
gether, and feeding mainframe applications pro- 
grams. 

"In some ways the outlook is very exciting, 
because of the tremendous power that these 
new tools will provide," says Ferris. "On the 
other hand, many users will find that each new 
feature will increase the problems they're hav- 
ing. . . . There's a high chance that the service 
and support burdens will get out of hand." 
Problem areas will be in hardware and soft- 
ware incompatibility, time-consuming educa- 
tion, equipment tracking, and the control and 
interpretation of key corporate data. "The 
hardware and software suppliers won't be able 
to provide much of what's needed," predicts 
Ferris, "and many companies will find their 
micros stuck in managerial and technical 
quagmires." 

□ Corona Data Systems (Westlake Village, 
CA) has signed agreements with eleven re- 
gional stocking distributors for more than 
$12 million in hard disk subsystems. The distrib- 
utors, with their regions of heaviest support, 
are: Victor Electronics (New England area), 
F.A. Components (metropolitan New York), 
Jersey Micro Systems (mid-Atlantic), Com- 



putermaxx (southeast), Kaltronics (northern 
central region), High Technology (central 
region), Acorn Data Products (mountain and 
western states), Sigma Distributing (north- 
west), Waybern (southern California), Vitek 
(southern California), and Datamex (Canada). 
Corona's new eastern regional office is located 
in Closter, New Jersey. The company is cur- 
rently hiring for its midwestern office, probably 
to be located in Dallas. 
□ Advanced Logic Systems (Sunnyvale, CA), 
demonstrating its willingness to give bright 
young people an opportunity in the business 



unnamed company and moved to a new ad- 
dress. They are now at 8943 Fullbright Avenue, 
Chatsworth, CA 91311. Their new quarters oc- 
cupy 18,000 feet of space, ample room for Dave 
Gordon to display his 1982 Single Player Game 
award, bestowed upon the company for Snack 
Attack. 

□ Robert O. Redd has been appointed direc- 
tor of microcomputer services for the national 
accounting firm of Seidman & Seidman (Grand 
Rapids, MI) by B. Z. Lee, managing partner of 
the firm. The appointment came pursuant to

cofounder of Apple Computer, on its board of 
directors. Wozniak says he is "delighted to be 
able to contribute to the research and direction 
of products that support Apple's product line." 

□ The formation of Ultrasoft (Issaquah, WA) 
has been formally announced by its president, 
Christopher P. Anson. The company's busi- 
ness plan calls for the transportation of their 
UltraCode interpreter, the heart of their ani- 
mated adventure game software, to other 
microcomputers, cutting program develop- 
ment time. Vice president and general manager 
Larry Franks anticipates "a series of product 
lines, from games to applications software, based 
on the UltraCode interpreter in a wide range of 
hardware environments." The company is mar- 
keting its wares through a network of selected 
distributors, avoiding direct sales. "It is very im- 
portant to preserve the profitability of the retail 
stores in this industry. We all depend on their 
collective success," observes Franks. 

□ DataMost, publisher of computer games, 
business software, and computer educational 
texts, has consummated a merger with an as-yet- 



computer assistance service to help companies 
and individuals convert accounting records to 
micro software. Services include conversion 
studies, installation assistance, and problem 
solving, plus bookkeeping and accounting func- 
tions. 

□ Bruce Harris has been named director of 
marketing at Quark Engineering (Denver, CO), 
producer of Apple software for office automa- 
tion applications. Harris will supervise Quark's 
national advertising and sales promotion ac- 
tivities, developing marketing strategies to in- 
troduce new product lines and broaden the 
company's dealer base. 

□ Comshare (Ann Arbor, MI), the computer 
software and services firm, has acquired 
1 80,000 shares of its common stock in unso- 
licited transactions and appointed two new vice 
presidents. Charles J. Palmer, formerly north- 
east area sales manager, is now vice president of 
eastern sales operations. Norman R. Neuman, 
Jr., vice president of product development for 
commercial services businesses, is also heading 
up product development and marketing for the

ny in 1976. 

□ Businessland, a retail center specializing in 
electronic business equipment, has opened its 
first store in San Jose, California. The retail cen- 
ter, covering word processing, data manage- 
ment, financial analysis, and accounting appli- 
cations, caters exclusively to owners and man- 
agers of small businesses. "We are now at a 
point where the microcomputer offers the right 
combination of capabilities and price to meet 
the needs of many small businesses," says Busi- 
nessland founder and president David A. Nor- 
man. "By focusing our attention on that seg- 
ment and its specific problems, we can offer the 
training, service, and systems that truly fit their 
needs." Plans are to have fourteen company- 
owned centers open by the end of 1983 and one 
hundred by 1985, with fifty more operated as 
joint ventures. 

□ Tandy C. Hamilton has been appointed 
technical support specialist for Evotek, the Fre- 
mont, California, manufacturer of 5 'A -inch 
rigid disk drives. Hamilton, formerly an ap- 
plications engineer for Shugart, will be respon- 
sible for technical support and service activities 
in the western region. 

□ Alphacom (Campbell, CA), makers of ther- 
mal printer/plotters and print mechanisms, has 
appointed William Clark executive vice pres- 
ident and chief operating officer. He will be re-

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR ? ? ? 



Are you tired of waiting for DOS to 
load and save files? Are you tired of 
waiting for DOS to finish so you can 
type again? Are you tired of waiting 
for your printer? When you buy 
Diversi-DOS™, you won't have to 
wait any more! Here's why: 

1. DOS speed-up: Apple DOS 3.3 
takes 18 disk revolutions to read a 
single track, whereas Diversi-DOS 
reads or writes a track in just 2 
revolutions. This speeds up file pro- 
cessing tremendously (see table). 

2. Keyboard Buffer: Diversi-DOS 
allows you to type at any time, as 
fast as you can, without missing a 
single character.

3. Print Buffer: Diversi-DOS can use 
a RAM card (16K-128K) to temporari- 
ly save characters before they are 
printed. Thus, your computer won't 
have to wait for your printer to 
finish. 

4. DDMOVER: Diversi-DOS can now 
be moved to a RAM card for increas- 
ed memory with BASIC programs. 

Diversi-DOS, the QUADRUPLE utili- 
ty, requires a 48K Apple II or II + 
with DOS 3.3. A simple, menu-driven 
installation program is included on 
the un-protected disk. So what are 
your waiting for?

better meeting the current and future needs for 
microcomputer-based programs for schools, 
adult training, and home education." 

□ USUS (La Jolla, CA), the UCSD-Pascal 
User's Society, has elected new board members 
and officers for 1983 and announced an in- 
creased commitment to user education, form- 
ing four new special interest groups (SIGs) and 
adding two free tutorials and four volumes to its 
software exchange library. Randy Bush of Voli- 
tion Systems is the new chairman of the soci- 
ety's board of directors, which consists of N.C. 
"Arley" Dealey of Volition, Nancy Lanning of 
SofTech Microsystems, Robert Peterson of 
Texas Instruments, and Michael Ikezawa. 
Peterson will also serve as president of the 
organization. Other officers are A. Winsor 
Brown, vice president; Michael Hadjioannou of 
Ticom Systems, treasurer; and Thomas Wot- 
eki of Ferox Microsystems. The next scheduled 
meeting of USUS is April 22-24, 1983, in San 
Diego. 

□ Public relations for InfoWorld (Palo Alto, 
CA), Broderbund (San Rafael, CA), Diablo Re- 
search Corporation (San Jose, CA), and Rela- 
tional Memory Systems (Sunnyvale, CA) are 
now being handled by Zhivago Public Rela- 
tions, a Palo Alto firm specializing in high-tech 
accounts. 

□ Mesa Industries (Wilmington, DE), parent 
company of Eastern Software Distributors and 
the National Software Company in Delaware, 
has announced the election of J.W. Lang as 
president. He was formerly controller with 
ESD. Also elected were Joseph S. Edwards, 
treasurer, and Thomas A. Jackson, secretary. 

□ The board of directors of Lifeboat Asso- 
ciates (New York, NY) has appointed Dr. Ed- 
ward H. Currie president and member of the 
board. Formerly vice president and chief 
operating officer, Dr. Currie will be responsible 
for marketing and daily operations. 

One of the oldest companies in the micro- 
computer business, long in the practice of ad- 
vising customers on the best ways to increase of- 
fice productivity via software, Lifeboat has de- 
cided to put its money where its mouth is. 
"We've been growing so fast, we haven't had 
time to step back and see how we could apply 
office automation to ourselves," says Currie. 
"We have not availed ourselves of the tech- 
nologically superior tools literally at our finger- 
tips." Lifeboat is now using the computers in- 
stalled in all departments to perform the 
tedious repetitious tasks that computers do so 
well and to speed up the workflow in the office. 

□ Centronics (Hudson, NH) has contracted 
with Leasametric (Foster City, CA) to add 
Centronics matrix and line printers to Leasa- 
metric's line of computer peripherals and tele- 
communications and microprocessor test and 
development systems. They will carry the model 
6081 line printers and model 353 Printstation 
for short-term rental through a network of sales 
offices, inventory centers, and test laboratories 
in the United States, Canada, and West Ger- 
many.

FEBRUARY 1983 




The background picture is 
from WARPITOUT— Veeder's 
own face jazzed up with the 
help of ZGRASS, an advanced 
graphics language. Inset, 
Veeder and her tools. 



CHICAGO COMPUTER ARTIST 
ACCELERATES TO WARP SPEED 



Just south of the loop, south of the La 
Salle Street banks, south of the Michigan Ave- 
nue hotels, south of the State Street depart- 
ment stores, lives an epic host of poor, under- 
privileged Chicagoans. Artist Jane Veeder is on 
the leading edge of a new age in electronic ex- 
pression, yet she lives in the slums on South Hal- 
sted Street in a split-level studio apartment. 

In that apartment, Veeder and her fellow 
artist Phil Morton have an impressive array of 
computer gadgetry, including a Datamax UV-1 
Graphics Computer, a Sandin Image Proc- 
essor, and assorted video equipment. CRT 
buses shake the building when they roar up 
Halsted just outside the front door, but they 
have little effect on the concentration of Vee- 
der and Morton. 

Veeder's latest creation, WARPITOUT, 
made quite an impressive debut at the 
SIGGRAPH '82 Art Show in Boston this 
summer. Held annually for the last nine years 
by the Association for Computing Machin- 
ery's Special Interest Group on Computer 
Graphics, SIGGRAPH is the Academy 
Awards for computer artists. 

In Veeder's own words, WARPITOUT is 
an "interactive computer graphics installa- 
tion, supporting real-time color graphics proc- 
essing of a digitized (facial) image of the cur- 
rent player using a menu-driven selection of 
drawing and processing programs, housed in a 
video-game cabinet." 

Veeder's manifesto further explains the 
genesis of this computer game cum computer 



art program: "I had developed a number of 
generalized real-time computer graphics proc- 
ess program tools that I loved to play with. 
Some I had adapted into animation se- 
quences, streamlined and stripped of their 
interactivity; others were still too slow for one- 
way performance. The recent development of 
our digitizer offered a wonderful opportunity 
to present these interactive programs in a 
menu-driven context for playing with every- 
one's favorite image . . . themselves." 

Burned into eprom and housed in a video- 
game cabinet, WARPITOUT allows the 
user/player to be Lon Chaney, Salvadore 
Dali, and Vincent Van Gogh with a digitized 
image of your own face. It was a big hit at 
SIGGRAPH, but it raised many questions as 
to its status as a true work of art. 

"Is it art? That's the first question. Let's go 
on to the next one," Veeder offers. How about 
an artistic video game? "With WARPITOUT, 
I'm using the universal appeal of your own 
face as a pretext to indulge in computer graph- 
ics more directly than you get to do with a 
commercial video game, where you're inter- 
acting with a finished product in restricted 
ways. ZGRASS makes possible an artist-inte- 
grated project such as WARPITOUT, as con- 
trasted to the corporate-designed video games 
accomplished by teams working in fragmen- 
tary and specialized roles." 

All this talk of video games and video 
game technology is not coincidental. Veeder 
uses a system that was developed in her neigh- 



borhood; video game behemoth Bally is based 
in Chicago. She has just smartly adapted the 
technology to other, more personal uses. 

A more traditional work of art is Mon- 
tana, a three-minute color videotape com- 
plete with stereo sound. Every year Veeder 
takes a trip into the western mountains, and 
Montana is an attempt to capture her "love 
[of] the physical world out there and its at- 
tendant information aura." 

Montana features a number of forms 
(mountain, hawk, buffalo, earth, Sears Tower, 
video camera, and more) made all very simple 
(in the way the Japanese mean it). Veeder took 
these simple forms and developed the visual 
relationships with a fluid program of her own 
design. The program enables her to draw with 
any of a collection of "snaps" (screen sec- 
tions stored as arrays) and tools to make lines, 
boxes, and other shapes. She worked on the 
piece for a long time, producing a dynamic,

COLLECT TAX DATA 
WHILE BALANCING YOUR CHECKBOOK! 
SEE NEXT YEAR'S 1040 THIS NOVEMBER! 



MY CPA FLIPPED! 



I'm Bob Payne, co-creator of Double Check- 
Apple software that collects tax data while balanc- 
ing checkbooks. 

Last November 29th I met with my CPA. I showed 
him two print-outs — both done with software 
costing less than $150. 



FOREVER RECORDS 

That's why Double Check is so important for your 
business and personal records. With it, you have 
"forever records" of all your important 
transactions. Any financial questions? Just fire up 
your Apple... then sort, list, or total. You get 
answers fast, and there's no need to pay a 
$100-an-hour CPA to research records, either. 



SMART CUSTOMERS 

Some customers even use it to control petty cash, 
to watch credit cards, and to control asset 
accounts. One San Francisco businessman uses it 
as a mini-accounts receivable. In place of check 
numbers, he enters invoice numbers. As payments 
come in, he enters them and thus creates a list of 
"aged accounts receivables". 

ENGLISH BUTLER 

The program will never trap you; nor will it 
"crash". It's polite as an English butler. It says 
"Please" and "Thank you." It has loads of 
reminders, and even tells you what's wrong when 
you goof. (Example: try running it with the drive 
door open and see the neat little message) 

Unlike other balancers on the market, there are 
no monthly closings to worry about; no "cut off 
dates". Better yet, you can split checks or 
deposits between codes. ..a very handy 
accounting tool. 



The first print-out was a list of capital gains, rents, 
interest, and other income. Also included were my 
medical expenses, business losses, interest paid, 
and other deductions. The list showed all my tax 
items check-by-check plus category totals. It 
showed January to November tax items. 

Getting this information was a snap. My program, 
Double Check, had collected it during the year as a 
by-product of checkbook balancing. In less than 
three minutes I sorted, listed, and printed the data. 

The second print-out was generated by EZ Tax, a 
new tax preparation program allowing VisiCalc-like 
"what if" tax calculations. With it, and the Double 
Check data, I created a sample 1040. The job took 
about 45 minutes — start to finish. 

Much to my surprise, my 1040 showed I had a 
"surplus" of deductions and business losses 
amounting to several thousands of dollars. True, I 
would have no taxes to pay, but I would "lose" 
most of these deductions... unless something 
changed. 

THERE'S STILL TIME 

"Well", said my CPA, "Let's change something. 
You still have time to get on the ball and collect 
those bad debts. You still have time to sell some 
more computer programs and increase income. 
You still have time for profit taking from your stock 
portfolio. You still have time to..." 

You get the idea. 

FREE APPLE, PRINTER, AND DRIVE! 

No question about it: using these "lost" 
deductions saved me the cost of my Apple, its 
dual drives, plus my Epson printer. Best of all, my 
tax planning was not "after the fact", but up-to- 
the-minute and accurate. 

WHERE THE MONEY IS 

But Double Check is important other ways, too. In 
banking, for example. Banks have money to loan, 
but they often judge your credit worthiness on 
how well you keep your checking accounts. Lots 
of NSFs, overdrafts, or other mess-ups? Your 
bank will wonder why. With Double-Check you 
get in balance, and stay in balance. 

Your CPA will love Double Check, too. That's 
because he uses your check stubs, cancelled 
checks, and bank statements like a stone mason 
uses mortar, rock, and iron. With them, he builds 
a permanent wall of records that protect your 
business. Cash may come and go, but like old 
sweepstakes tickets, cancelled checks last forever. 



EASIEST BALANCER YET 

Best of all, Double-Check is easy to use. Here's 
how it works: The program displays a facsimile of 
your checkbook. You see 17 items per screen, and 
you can scroll for more. It's a computerized replica 
of your checkbook. Balancing is easy because 
"running balance" errors appear immediately. 

Reconciling your bank statement is even easier: 
just enter the numbers of checks returned from 
your bank, and instantly the computer displays the 
date, payee, code, and amount for your approval. 
You can enter check numbers in any order, so 
there's no need to sort checks. 

100 USER-DEFINED CODES 

As the computer balances your checkbook, you 
give each check it's own category code. You get 
100 "you name 'em" codes. You can change, add, 
or delete code labels anytime without affecting 
data. You even get an on-screen code dictionary. 
Just press "Ctrl" O and see all your codes plus 
your code labels. You can split checks (or 
deposits) between codes, too. 

So, Double Check fits business like a bone fits a 
socket. Professional offices, service companies 
and small businesses are using it in dozens of 
ways: 

• Income by category 

• Expenses by department 

• Trust account control 

• Instant income statements 

• "Down-and-dirty" profit statements 

Double Check works great for "budgeting with 
actuals". Just enter dummy amounts in each code 
category. As checks (or deposits) are entered, the 
category totals increase or decrease thus 
producing the "over/under" amounts.

Jewish Institute 
Imparts Religious 
Law with Computers 

Rabbi Allan Rosenbaum seated before the terminal by 
which he accesses the Responsa database— a space-age 
tool for investigating age-old problems. 



229 




It should come as no surprise that tech- 
nology is becoming the handmaiden of re- 
ligion. The same computers that form the 
brains of multimillion-dollar corporations and 
lord it over scientific research institutes are 
being harnessed for the never-ending task of 
analyzing religious history and law. 

One of the most ambitious projects in- 
volving computers and religious study was 
started in 1968 at Bar-Ilan University in Is- 
rael. A decade later, close to two hundred vol- 
umes of Halachic Responsa (the writings of 
ordained rabbis) dating from the eighth cen- 
tury to the present were assembled on a data- 
base using a large mainframe computer. 

A little over a year ago the Institute for 
Computers in Jewish Life, based in Chicago, 
became the North American Center for the 
Bar-Ilan University Responsa Project. A copy 
of the database in Israel was put on an IBM 
370/168 and a terminal was set up in the 
Institute at Chicago's Water Tower Place. 

Using a TeleVideo terminal with a He- 
brew text chip, Rabbi Irving Rosenbaum and 
his son Rabbi Allan Rosenbaum gain access 
to the Responsa database to perform compli- 
cated search routines and print out the re- 
sults on a Decwriter IV also equipped with a 
Hebrew text chip. 

According to the younger Rosenbaum, the 
Responsa Project provides very sophisticated 
search programs that go beyond the mun- 
dane and the everyday. For instance, you can 
search for the accumulated responses to the 
question: "When, according to Jewish Law, is 
the exact moment of death?" On "May an 
orthodox Jewish doctor send a patient to 
another physician to administer treatment 
which he himself may not perform because it 
is forbidden according to Jewish Law?" 

Jewish scholars have benefited greatly 



from the Responsa Project, but it's not limited 
just to religious and ethical problems. Due to 
the vast amount of data stored, which covers a 
myriad of subjects, it's possible to glean 
information, for instance, about interest rates 
charged by European merchant bankers for 
the fourteenth through the sixteenth centuries. 
Both Rosenbaums are encouraging regular 
scholars and historians to use the Responsa 
Project for their own nonreligious research. 

When people wish to perform searches, 
they must first fill out a comprehensive "search 
profile." The desired results are broken down 
into "an exact formulation of the search 
topic." You can have the whole database 
searched or just specific works, which you 
must indicate in the original Hebrew. Ulti- 
mately, the process is narrowed down to key 
words and key phrases. 

"The scope of Jewish Law is so vast," ex- 
plains Rabbi Allan Rosenbaum, "that per- 
forming a search for a subject like 'women 
and Judaism' is not practical. You have to 
narrow it down." 

Director of the Institute for Computers in 
Jewish Life, Rabbi Irving Rosenbaum, is 
looking forward to the day when the Re- 
sponsa Project will become a global database, 
with research centers in many different loca- 
tions around the world. Eventually, personal 
microcomputers will be able to gain access to 
the Responsa database, bringing the service 
into individual homes. It's an ambitious proj- 
ect that attempts no less than uniting an en- 
tire people in and through computers. 

The elder Rosenbaum feels there is no 
conflict with being a serious religious leader 
and a user of high technology. "The comput- 
er is mind-boggling, while at the same time it 
suggests new juxtapositions. In a nominal 
way, it's creative." 



CHICAGO ARTIST 

continued from page 227 

arresting audio-visual experience. 

Veeder and her partner Phil Morton are 
only two of many computer artists living and 
working in the Chicago area. Tom DeFanti 
and Dan Sandin of the University of Illinois 
at Chicago Circle have been very influential, 
mainly through their own development of new 
graphics technology. "I'm standing on a 
whole bunch of people's shoulders," says 
Veeder. 

Veeder came from the world of video 
synthesis, which she feels is quite wonderful 



but akin to sex. "It's not too interesting for 
those watching." She supports herself by 
doing outside consulting work in the Chicago 
area, mainly instructing people how to use the 
ZGRASS language. She also says she's ex- 
tremely addicted to real-time computer 
graphics. 

"I am almost completely uninterested in 
still images other than photos for promotion 
or documentation. Real-time graphic perform- 
ance resulting in a dynamic visual process is 
my priority and the motivation for my con- 
tinuing growth as a programmer." 

Living in a slum or not, Veeder is making 
history in computer art.

WARNER REELS FROM ATARI'S 
UNEXPECTED DROP IN PROFITS 



Pity the poor investor. Practically noth- 
ing's a blue chip stock these days. Especially 
not if the company dabbles in the VCS game 
market. And especially not if the company is 
Warner Communications. 

Warner Communications, for those of you 
who missed Bugs Bunny, and Errol Flynn, 
once was Warner Brothers Studio. 

Filmmakers fell on hard times in the late 
sixties and early seventies, and Warner fell 
right along with the rest of them. It seems that 
folks just couldn't be motivated to go out to a 
movie. Out went old management and in 
came new, in the person of Steven Ross, still 
fearless leader of the entertainment con- 
glomerate. 

Ross took the remainder of Warner's 
dwindling assets and diversified the compa- 
ny — as indicated by its present name. He took 
Warner into cable television; their QUBE sys- 
tem, pioneered in Columbus, Ohio, remains 
the most advanced cable system in the coun- 
try. But where Ross really struck it rich was in 
celluloid and silicon. 

Dating essentially from the release of Star 
Wars, people returned to movie theaters in 
droves. Star Wars was a Twentieth Century- 
Fox production, but Superman was a superhit 
that filled Warner's coffers with almost as 
much lucre. Warner's television production 
division was also on a roll during that period. 

This turnaround in entertainment for- 
tunes was most fortuitous because Ross had 
his eye on a company called Atari. Nolan 
Bushnell's firm had Magnavox's Odyssey sys- 
tem on the run, but the mid-seventies were not 
a good time for a young company to look to 
the stock market for expansion financing. So, 
for $28 million, Warner picked up the promis- 
ing gamemaker. 

The stock market was not exactly buoyed 
by the news. What the devil did a bunch of 
prima donna movie people know about games 
anyway? Perhaps nothing, but by that time it 
didn't matter. In its first year under the War- 
ner umbrella and with the financial help of 
the parent, Atari reported profits — not sales, 
mind you, but profits — of $25 million, nearly 
recouping Warner's investment in one year 
and making the smart money on Wall Street 
sit up and take notice. 

By 1981, Atari had sales of $1 billion, 
practically a monopolistic hold on the low end 
of the home entertainment market and what 
looked like an eternal money-machine. Oh 
my, did the investors buy. In five years, they 
drove Warner stock from less than five dol- 
lars to more than fifty dollars a share, mostly 
on the basis of Atari's strength. 

Investors little noted nor long remem- 
bered the chinks in Atari's armor. It didn't 
seem important that Atari's computer line was 
slow — or perhaps retarded is a more accurate 



assessment — in capturing public fancy. It 
didn't seem germane that Mattel, Coleco, Mil- 
ton Bradley, and others were taking dead aim 
at Atari's VCS market with more advanced 
machines. The Vic 20 and the TI 99/4, priced 
competitively and full-bodied computers in- 
stead of just game machines, appeared to be 
only nuisances. 

Atari appeared to have the hot machine 
and the hot software, led by Pac-Man, and an 
unstoppable momentum. Alas, for Atari, the 
old adage that there's nothing older than yes- 
terday's news may be replaced by one that 
says there's nothing older than yesterday's 
technology. 

The company was absolutely ponderous in 
getting product to market. In December of 
1981, they reported back orders of between 
two and three million units for Pac-Man. But 
they couldn't bring the game to market for 
several more months. What was worse, when 
they did bring it to market, it was only a pale 
version of the arcade favorite. Rumor has it 
that Atari has warehouses full of unsold Pac- 
Man units. 

None of Atari's other software captured 
the imagination of new buyers either, and 
Atari didn't have the rights to Pac-Maris suc- 
cessors in the arcades — Donkey Kong and 
Frogger. Even souped-up sales of the Atari 
400 and 800 computers couldn't offset the in- 
roads being made by Mattel and Coleco in the 
VCS market. 

So it came to pass in December that 
Warner somewhat shamefacedly reported that 
their earlier earnings projections for the last 
quarter of 1982 were too high. Actual earn- 
ings would be much more modest. And 
Atari's performance was being blamed. 

To an investment community that had 
come to believe that silicon was beautiful, 
Warner's Atari announcement had the im- 
pact of heresy. Warner stock did not open on 
the day of the announcement until there were 
only ninety minutes left in the trading day. 

Then it dropped $1.3 billion (that's no 
typographical error) in value in the next week. 
When Warner went, it took just about every- 
body with it. Down went Mattel, dropping in 
value by nearly $200 million in a bear market 
that caused its stock not to trade for a day and 
a half while order was being restored. Coleco 
stock dropped. Imagic had to postpone a 
planned public offering. 

Under the category of its never rains but it 
pours comes more bad news for Warner. In- 
vestors had previously discounted an upstate 
New York theater scandal involving two War- 
ner directors. It's alleged that they got caught 
with their hands in the cookie jar in a strictly 
minor league scam about a decade ago. One 
served on Warner's three-man office of the

Software Degree a First 



Seattle University Students 
Engineer Computer Projects 



In June of last year, twenty-two Seattle 
University students made history of a sort 
when they received the master's of software 
engineering degree — the first of its kind. 

The program participants, mostly work- 
ing industry professionals who attended class- 
es at night, learned about software engineer- 
ing, system analysis, system design, imple- 
mentation, and validation. Taking two 
courses per quarter over a two-year period, 
the students focused on such topics as data- 
base design, data security, computer graphics, 
and human factors. 

Seattle University initiated this unique de- 
gree program in 1979, but the work of creat- 
ing it began a couple of years earlier. A similar 
program, started in 1980, can be found at the 
Wang Institute of Graduate Studies in Tyngs- 
boro, Massachusetts. 

The intent at Seattle University was to de- 
vise a program that would emphasize practi- 
cal, usable applications, complementing the 
existing computer science department, which 
emphasizes more theoretical concerns. For 
help in designing the preliminary curriculum, 
the university turned to Boeing Computer 
Services, a big name in computers in the Seat- 
tle area. Boeing also supplied some of the 
necessary funds, as did Weyerhauser, a large 
wood products company in the area, and Al- 
coa Aluminum. Hewlett-Packard of Menlo 
Park, California, contributed the computing 
system that's used — an HP-3000. 

When it came time to implement the pro- 
gram, the administration sought the expertise 
of Dr. Kyu Lee, whose experience with com- 
puters includes being a specialist at Fermi Na- 
tional Laboratory, teaching computer sci- 
ence courses at various universities, and work- 
ing for E G & G, a high technology firm, in 
real-time systems and management. Lee 
teaches some of the program's classes him- 
self, while the other courses are conducted by 
faculty members Eric Frankel and Robert 
Glass, or by specialists brought in by Lee from 
the business community. A course on data se- 
curity, for example, would be taught by some- 
one who deals with this issue all the time, most 
likely someone from a bank or from a large 
corporation like Boeing. 

At present, some ninety students, repre- 
senting about forty companies, are enrolled in 
the program. Admission requirements in- 
clude a minimum of two years' experience us- 
ing computers and the bachelor degree in 
some "quantitative discipline." Majors that fit 
this category are computer science, mathe- 
matics, and engineering, among others. In ad- 
dition, students must be able to program, pref- 



erably in Pascal, C, or some other structured 
language; Cobol is also acceptable. 

According to Dr. Lee, "The goal of the 
program is to teach software professionals 
how to design and/or manage a reliable soft- 
ware system." Students in the program follow 
out the "software life cycle, learning how soft- 
ware is produced and maintained from con- 
ception, to development, to delivery, to ter- 
mination of the product." In addition, says 
Lee, the program puts a heavy emphasis on 
management techniques and communica- 
tions skills that participants will need in their 
future work as software designers and project 
managers. 

The culmination of the program is the 
nine-month-long "software laboratory," in 
which all students take part. Breaking up into 
teams of three to five, they create "a fairly de- 
cent-sized software system," going from con- 
ception to delivery. "The approach is a rigor- 
ous one," says Lee, "since all analysis, design, 
and implementation must be done properly." 

The projects that students work on during 
this phase of the program aren't meant as 
mere exercises. They're suggested by someone 
at the university or by someone in the busi- 
ness community who sees a need for a par- 
ticular kind of software system. During the 
"requirements definition" phase, students and 
their clients discuss and spell out what's need- 
ed, in an effort to ensure that the final prod- 
uct is something that will be really useful. 

Some projects are completed by the origi- 
nal teams that started them. Among the sys- 
tems completed so far are an accounts pay- 
able system written in Cobol, a library circu- 
lation system (also in Cobol), and an ultra- 
sound simulation in Apple III Pascal that's de- 
signed to teach scanning techniques to medi- 
cal professionals. An ongoing endeavor is Lee's 
own pet project — a relational DBMS on the 
IBM pc, to which the students are taking a subset 
or "phased" approach. 

During the software laboratory portion of 
the program, the project manager position ro- 
tates. This gives each student the chance to 
learn and practice the special kinds of skills 
the role requires. 

When a project is in the analysis stage, a 
major part of the project manager's job in- 
volves getting the full cooperation of all team 
members. If one or more team members are 
lagging behind the rest, it's the team leader's 
responsibility to motivate them. If all else fails, 
there's a mechanism, similar to firing, for deal- 
ing with a student who just doesn't manage to 
perform adequately. So far, though, says Lee, 
"we haven't had to use it."

East Coast Computer 
Film-maker Creates 
Works of 'Pure Art' 

Lillian Schwartz is an East Coast artist 
who says she needs to work in the materials of 
her time like she needs to eat and sleep. 

In the sixties, one of her sculptures, Prox- 
imo Centauri, combined some of the mechan- 
ics, effects, and textures of the era. It was a 
large black minimal structure topped by a 
plastic dome, on which slides were projected. 
A proximity detector caused the dome to re- 
cede into the black unit when a viewer stepped 
close. A water tank above the sculpture bathed 
it in ripples, giving the surface of the piece a 
gelatenous look. 

Schwartz's mysteriously kinetic work of 
art was chosen to be displayed in The Ma- 
chines Exhibition at the Metropolitan Mu- 
seum of Art in 1968. It was placed next to a 
computer-generated graphic, Studies in Per- 
ception I, that was created on a mainframe by 
a scientist at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, 
New Jersey. Schwartz was immediately smit- 
ten by the graphic piece, and says she "was all 
over it to see how it was done." Her enthusi- 
asm eventually led her to become an artistic 
filmmaker using one of the most sophisti- 
cated tools of her time: the computer. 




Schwartz believes that the computer is ideal for 
creating "pure art." Above, one image from her 
most recent endeavors, an untitled work still in 
progress. 



Her numerous short films made over the 
last decade have won Schwartz international 
recognition, and she continues to receive com- 
missions for more. Best known for her exper- 
imentation with new technology, she is a pio- 
neer in the use of the digital computer as a me- 
dium in the arts. She believes her access to the 
largely unexplored canvas of the computer has 
defined her role as an artist: to develop the 
computer as a tool for pure art. 

When Schwartz began her work at Bell 
Labs by invitation in 1968, computer art was 
in its Stone Age. Artists worked only in black 
and white, programming was done on punch 
cards, and "interactive" was a concept still in 
the works. Her first piece, a still graphic en- 
titled Head, was produced under these restric- 



FEBRUARY 1983 

tions on an IBM 360-50 mainframe. The sys- 
tem she used allowed her to scan and digitize a 
drawing of a head, using tiny face symbols to 
replace the gray values. 

"I had always used sound and motion in 
my sculpture," she explains. "When I dis- 
covered that a simple change in the com- 
puter's instructions created a variation, ani- 
mation was the next logical phase for me. The 
computer pushed me into it after about a 
year." Then came a commission to do a com- 
puter-generated film. 

The film was a four and a half minute ab- 
stract entitled Pixilation, made in 1970. "If 
you were lucky back then, you turned in your 
punch cards and got a tape with eighty-five 
frames on it the next day. At twenty-four 
frames a second, I thought I'd never get it fin- 
ished," she says. "I ended up animating half of 
it by hand, frame by frame. The program- 
ming consisted of throwing on boxes, 2-D 
squares, and rectangles, using the random 
number generator for variation. Then I 
worked on an optical bench to give it color." 

A television interface became available to 
the artist in 1974, allowing Schwartz and her 
computer science co-creators to shoot a series 
of animation frames off a monitor. "It was 
our first controlled shooting," she explains. 
"The programs could be written and run all 
night. We would compute, then shoot. How- 
ever, we lost some resolution in the process, 
but at least we were out of the Dark Ages. Up 
till then, you could only see what you were 
doing in your head." 

The technological advantage of a PDP 
1 145, with a digital drum that could store pic- 
tures, allowed Schwartz to preview her work 
for the first time. "We were free to make deci- 
sions and edit in the computer," she says. It 
also had the video interface she had found so 
liberating. She used real-world input, pictures 
of birds, for her film L'Oiseau that was created 
using this system. 

A new phase of mixed media opened up 
for Schwartz when she gained access to a PDP 
1 140 with a video/ visual communication sys- 
tem attached. It was used to make a film of 
choreographed dancers, done in false color, in 
1978. The system allowed the storing of 
images in a camera and the frame numbers in 
a computer, facilitating the easy manipula- 
tion of images and the mixing of live-action 
footage with animation. The editing process 
for Schwartz became a little like playing a 
musical instrument. Poet of His People, a 
documentary on Chilean poet Pablo Neruda 
interspersed with footage of narrators in a 
studio and images of dancers and sea birds, 
likewise evolved from this period. 

Nowadays, Schwartz's computerized art- 
work is much more interactive than it was five 
years ago. "I can really apply a lot of technol- 
ogy to my artistic vocabulary by just using 
buttons and joysticks for preliminary sketch- 
work. We have unbelievable resolution and a 
choice of over 65,000 colors," she says. "I can 
make instant evaluations, compare palettes, 
display the choices, and make decisions."

One area of her artistic concern revolves 
around the languages of computing. "Each 
language has its own personality. This can be 
an artistic disadvantage, producing too simi- 
lar results, because each one has character that 
invades the work. I find it provocative to work 
in many different languages because it gives 
me a larger variety of programming tools to 
chose from." 

Schwartz has also found that her way of 
thinking about art has changed as computers 
get more challenging as a medium. "They pro- 
voke me into ways of creating that would have 
been impossible before, opening up a whole 
new world of visual imagery. 

"I also find we're doing more pre and 
post-production work now, not producing 
much in real time anymore, except to con- 
ceptualize. Certain algorithms are used to 
smooth out the edges of an image, and these 
take time to compute. I'm at a point where 
I'm willing to give up real time for better 
resolution. Technology is changing so rapidly 
that in the very near future we may have 
both." 

WARNER REELS 

continued from page 230 

president, while the other was treasurer. 
Worse news, coming as the company's stock 
was plummeting, was informal implication of 
Ross in the illegal doings. No charges were 
filed, but it added fuel to the fire. 

Then came news that Atari's chairman, 
Raymond Kassar, dumped a large block of 
stock the day before the revised earnings esti- 
mate was released to the public. The Security 
and Exchange Commission's rules specifical- 
ly forbid individuals with inside information 
from taking advantage of such data. Kassar 
says the sale was part of an end-of-the-year tax 
strategy planned and executed prior to his 
knowing of the earnings downturn and that he 
tried to stop the sale when he learned of it. 
He's cooperating in an investigation, but War- 
ner stock took another buffeting. 

It'll be awhile before investors swallow 
Warner estimates whole. But the underlying 
weaknesses seem still to be going unnoticed. 
Little mention is made of the maturation of 
the market. And less mention is made of the 
stiffer competition from low-priced com- 
puters. 

Even the top-of-the-line models are now 
siphoning off sales that might have previously 
gone to the VCS machines. George Schuetz of 
Computerland of South King County, Wash- 
ington, serving the Seattle area, notes a change 
in the type of customers the store now gets. 
Schuetz says they're more knowledgeable 
about their options and know better what they 
want. And, even though the $300 computers 
are selling in every drugstore and discount de- 
partment store, Schuetz says people are com- 
ing in to buy Apples and IBM Personal Com- 
puters. 

Warner may have a tough time recaptur- 
ing that SI. 3 billion.

□ It's a Small World. The United Nations 
has designated 1983 World Communication 
Year and is encouraging projects aimed at 
boosting communication systems in underde- 
veloped countries. Projects suggested so far 
range from planning a national telecommuni- 
cations network in the African country of 
Benin to designing low-cost radio equipment 
for other African countries. One aim of World 



Communication Year, according to the Unit- 
ed Nations, is to stimulate "an awareness 
among youth of the impact of communica- 
tions infrastructures on today's society and 
their fundamental importance for the eco- 
nomic and social development of every 
nation." Schoolchildren can enter a world- 
wide photographic and drawing competition 
called "Youth in the Electronic Age, '83." The 
United Nations stresses that all the projects 
will be funded voluntarily by private individ- 
uals, institutions concerned with communi- 
cations, and governments. The United States 
and West Germany have each donated more 
than a million dollars, and many other coun- 
tries have contributed smaller amounts and 



other kinds of support. Italy, for instance, in- 
tends to stage a series of conferences on the in- 
fluence of the atmosphere on the transmis- 
sion of digital signals. 

□ Over Here, Part Two. Late in 1982 the 
Semiconductor Research Corporation, 
funded cooperatively by several large Amer- 
ican semiconductor companies (Softalk, Au- 
gust 1982, page 176), announced its first re- 
search contracts with universities. Just under 
one million dollars will go to Cornell Univer- 
sity for research into microstructures. Eight- 
een faculty members and a group of grad- 
uate students will investigate the properties of 
integrated circuits with minimum dimensions 
measured on the scale of atomic spacings. A 
total of $1.75 million will go to the University 
of California at Berkeley and Carnegie-Mel- 
lon University for joint research in computer- 
aided design of integrated circuits. The Semi- 
conductor Research Corporation also 
awarded five smaller research contracts to uni- 
versity groups that proposed innovative re- 
search ideas related to very large-scale inte- 
grated circuits. 

□ CAFE— Computer Aided Film Editing. 

Last November Eastman Kodak Company 
introduced Datakode, a new product for cod- 
ing motion picture film that the company be- 
lieves will help cut feature film postproduc- 
tion costs by 50 percent. Datakode consists of 
a transparent magnetic oxide coding across 
the back, or nonsensitive, side of either six- 
teen or thirty-five millimeter film. It enables 
filmmakers to record machine-readable pro- 
duction data, which can be computerized for 
postproduction work. Editors can store, re- 
trieve, edit, and cut the film faster, according 
to Kodak. Nearly all the noncreative, repeti- 
tive manual work of postproduction can be 
automated. Datakode will be available by 
mid- 1983 and will cost around two cents 
per foot. 

□ An American Computer in London. Do 

you ride in taxis frequently? Do you live in 
London? Are you tired of hauling out those 
big pound notes every time you take a spin 
to Westminster Abbey? Then London-Wide 
Radio Taxis has a deal for you. Thanks to a 
Honeywell small computer system, regular 
customers can run up a tab with the taxi com- 
pany and be billed monthly. All incoming tele- 
phone calls are handled automatically by the 
microcomputer-based system. With a com- 
munication system in each cab, a driver is 
given an assignment and details of the fin- 
ished jobs are stored for automatic account- 
ing. Monthly statements are prepared for driv- 
ers, showing a breakdown of their earnings, 
while invoices are automatically produced for 
credit account customers. HI

Tennis, Anyone? 

8» IOE MELTON 



What do you get when you put two of the greatest tennis players of 
all time, two Apple Ills, and $100,000 together with fifty-five hundred 
tennis fans? You get great tennis, of course! 

On Sunday, November 21, 1982, Apple sponsored the Apple Chal- 
lenge, matching Jimmy Connors against Bjorn Borg in the San Fran- 
cisco Civic Center. The winner of two out of three sets took home 
$75,000 and the loser $25,000. 

The Apple Challenge took place on the last day of Applefest. Not 
coincidentally, the Challenge was staged just above the hall where 
Applefest was being held. 

The Challenge was the last of a series of eight head-to-head exhibi- 
tion matches between Connors and Borg. Tickets were sold out four 
days after they went on sale. In lifetime competition, Connors and Borg 
had played twenty-three tournament matches against each other, with 
Borg owning a fifteen to eight lead; Borg had won their last ten tourna- 
ment meetings. Under international tennis rules, exhibition matches 
don't count as tournament matches, and, in the exhibition series, Con- 
nors had won six matches while Borg, after almost a year of very little 
competitive tennis, had won only one match. 

Borg, a five-time Wimbledon champion, is one of the greatest tennis 
players of all time. Jimmy Connors is currently the number one tennis 
player in the world, having won both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 
1982. The fans expected good tennis, and they got it. 

Connors won the match with 7-5, 7-6 (8-6 tiebreaker) scores. Borg, 
lacking match toughness from having competed in only a few tourna- 
ments during his layoff, was erratic. On the other hand, Connors, 
although tired from too much tennis during the past summer, still played 
like the number one tennis player in the world. 

Where did the Apple Ills come in? The promoter, Barry MacKay, 
asked Apple to provide a computer to keep match statistics for the tele- 
vision commentators. Apple provided two Apple Ills, a Silentype, and 
two Apple personnel to handle the calculations. 



No one even had to write a special program to calculate the statis- 
tics; VisiCalc Advanced Version proved more than up to the task. One of 
the Apple people wrote two different VisiCalc templates for the two Ills, 
one to calculate the statistics the announcers required and the other to 
provide in-depth analysis of the match. (Ventures in VisiCalc next month 
will discuss how these were done.) 

VisiCalc Advanced Version was chosen because variable column 
widths and percent display allowed a better screen presentation. The 
template that was to handle the commentators' statistics was formatted 
so the statistics could be easily understood by tennis enthusiasts, and the 
video monitor was placed where a handheld mobile television camera 
could occasionally show the screen. 

Luckily, Apple found two avid tennis enthusiasts/employees who 
could write the templates and monitor the match; one had been on the 
tennis team at Stanford University. It was easy for them to understand 
and keep track of what was happening on the court. In fact, the only 
problem was the commentators' habit of asking for the statistics only 
when VisiCalc was recalculating. 

A Silentype, set up beside the court, provided printed copies. By 
virtue of the accuracy of its name, the Silentype was the right choice. 
Those who know tennis, and especially those who've seen Jimmy Con- 
nors play, know that neither player would have allowed a noisy printer 
to be used during the match. 

It was an exciting afternoon, especially for Apple fans. Two of the 
best tennis players in the history of the game playing a great match — 
with Apple logos everywhere! There were even two large Apples painted 
on the court. 

When Mike Markkula, president of Apple, presented the winner's 
check and an Apple III to Jimmy Connors, he announced the final statis- 
tic that the Apple III had computed for the match: Jimmy Connors's 
winnings came to $446 for each point played in the match. 

Nice work if you can get it; and nicer still with an Apple. Hi

knew I had been drugged the minute I came to. Shirley was 
screaming, "Your J-Js are hot! Your J-Js are hot!" Shirley 
is a sweet, well-intentioned girl, but sometimes she over- 
states the obvious. She's a smart computer terminal hooked 
up to my network at the Cleveland office. Unfortunately, 
smart terminal or not, when she gets on one of those warn- 
ing jags she acts pretty dumb. I suppose I shouldn't complain; warning 
me of system failures is her primary function. 

I had just started working on the FedLect case for Sam when it hap- 
pened. Sam's my partner. Actually he built me to help him with his 
work, but I like to think that we operate as a team. Sam handles the 
physical side of the business while I do most of the legwork. It's an ar- 
rangement that has worked out well over the years. 

My name is M.A.C. Gate. Sam gained international recognition as a 
computer genius after he built me: the world's largest Multiple Access 
Cryogenic Gate. That's something both he and I are very proud of even 
though Shirley says that the physical size of an intellect unit's information 
receptor does not make the machine. Like I said before, Shirley acts a little 
dumb sometimes. 

We had received the call from FedLect a few days before I was un- 
ceremoniously knocked out. Tuesday mornings are always bad for me, 
so I was quietly running some diagnostics while Sam caught up on his 
paperwork. I had almost completed my weekly ritual and was powering 
up my audio sensors when the harsh, synthetic voice of the corn-link 
said, "Priority call, line three." 

My left video-eye was already on and caught Sam's hand as it 
reached out and stabbed at the com-link's accept button. "Sledgg and 
Gate," he said. 

I could tell from the tone of his voice that Sam was irritated. The link 
was overphoneticizing as usual, and from the scratchy noise that sput- 
tered out of the receiver it was obvious that the transmission was being 
sent through an obsolete communications satellite. 

"Why can't you people at TeleCom manage to install more modern 
machinery?" he barked into the link. When nothing but more static came 
back in response to his question, Sam threw his hands up into the air. 
"All right. What do you want?" 

"Mr. Sledgg," the link's gravelly voice said, "please contact FedLect 
Central Processing as soon as possible." 

It was not a request. It was an order. Our being the best computer 
troubleshooters in the business meant that the government felt it had a 
right to call on us anytime for anything. It has been my experience that 
operating-license-issuing institutions generally have this power. 

Sam paused for a moment and looked at me with a pained expres- 
sion on his face. "Patch me through to Director Haver," he said. 

The scratchy voice ignored his request. Instead of making the con- 
nection, it said, "Your physical presence is mandatory, Mr. Sledgg. 
Please report to Director Haver within forty-eight hours. Thank you." 

Before Sam had a chance to respond, the corn-link went dead. 
"Damn," he said under his breath, but not so low that my audio sen- 
sors couldn't pick it up. 

I could tell that my partner was more than just a little bit angry. 
Haver's physical presence order would be difficult to comply with. 
Earth's nine billion people were all competing for seats on a transporta- 
tion system designed for five billion. Once you managed to get space, the 
process of electromolecular transfer made the actual act of travel hap-

pen almost instantly. But the waits at the E-M stations . . . they some- 
times lasted for days. I didn't envy Sam his trip. 

My partner cleared his end of the corn-link and wheeled around in 
his chair to face me. Anger showed on his features. It was not pretty . "Mac?" 
he said. "Wake up. Something's hot over at FedLect and I've 
got to be out of the office for a few days." 

I've found over the years that the best way to calm Sam down when 
he's upset about something is to deliberately inflame his anger until it 
completely spends itself. I violently flickered my green phosphor display 
screen and said nothing. It didn't take long for the explosion of verbal 
abuse to come. 

"Mac! Wake up, you bucket of inconsequential electrons. Do you 
hear me, photon-breath? I've got — " 

"I hear you! I hear you!" I yelled back at him. Then, using an old 
trick that always drained the last venom from his tongue, I resolved my 
screen into a two-dimensional caricature of his own face. Deliberately 
drawn in a childlike manner, it accentuated the unflattering wrinkles of 
Sam's frowning expression. 

"All right, Mac," he said in a softer tone than he had used before. "I 
apologize for the outburst." 

I let the picture dissolve. "Feel better, Samuel?" I asked. 

"Mac!" 

Sam didn't like anyone using his full first name, but I couldn't resist 
taking a final jab at his immature behavior. I let him stew for a few sec- 
onds and then said, "I'm sorry too." His angry expression melted into a 
round, passive pool of smiling flesh. "Anything special you want me to 
do while you're gone?" I asked. 

Sam looked at me hard. He was thinking. It always seemed to me to 
be an extremely peculiar trait in humans that they had trouble hiding the 
fact that their brains were working. I suppose that's why the word bluff 
has no meaning for me, yet it's very important to my partner. 

"Yes," Sam finally answered. "You can brush up on the FedLect sys- 
tem. I suspect we'll need to know all we can by the time I return." 

"Done." I immediately detailed one of my subfunctions to retrieve 
the disk information storage devices that held the FedLect system data. 

Sam moved from his desk over to the small clothes closet beside the 
entrance to the office. He stepped behind the closet door and disap- 
peared from the field of view of my video-eyes. When he emerged he was 
wearing his light gray greatcoat. "Well," he said as he opened the office 
entrance panel, "I'll see you later, Mac." 

"Good-bye," I quickly responded. But Sam's gray-clad bulk had al- 
ready disappeared through the door. As the panel silently slid shut be- 
hind him, my parallel cross-reference memory brought up the image of a 
giant lump of clay. When Sam wore his greatcoat that's what he looked 
like: a fashionable, three hundred fifty pound chunk of modeling clay. 
Somehow this image seemed to be a perfect fit for his mind — big and 
amorphous and slightly eccentric. As I let the picture of the clay slowly 
fade from my memory, I felt proud to have such a man as my partner. 
That I knew Sam felt the same way about me only enhanced my pride. 

When I do any heavy analysis work I keep Shirley on- 
line so she can monitor my autonomic functions 
while I concentrate on the job. The FedLect system 
review was heavy work. And, as usual, Shirley 
couldn't keep quiet. 
Most intellect units wouldn't put up with her be- 
havior. It tends to upset our internal pacing clocks. I suffer Shirley's in- 
cessant questions and requests for definitions because I've discovered that in 
answering her I actually improve the esthetic quality of my decisions. It takes 
longer to analyze a system completely, but in the end she's really a big help to 
Sam and me. 

As soon as I went to work on the FedLect system, Shirley started 
badgering me. 

"What's a software bus?" she asked. 

"You should already know that," I answered. 

"What's a software bus?" she asked again, ignoring my rebuff and 
not letting me put her off without giving a definitive answer. 

Shirley may ask the most elemental of questions, but she has a knack 
for cutting away at the superfluous and getting to the heart of a problem. I

decided to give in. "A software bus is an interface between software mod- 
ules that allows them to communicate with one another." 
"How does it work?" 

No smart terminal could be this stupid, I thought on a peripheral out 
of range of her sensors. "Just think of it as a fancy set of program in- 
structions that acts like a hardware bus, like the cable that connects you 
to me and allows us to talk." 

"Then why not use a cable?" 

"Shirley. ..." I let what I was going to say drift off through my 
aluminum heat sinks. "Because you may not know what your future 
format requirements will be. A software bus lets you modify things later 
without having to design and fabricate new hardware. Understand?" 

"Yes," she answered in a particularly stimulating way she has of rais- 
ing the median voltage on the line that connects us. 

I took no notice of her deliberate attempt to be coy. "Fine," I said. 
"Now, may we please continue?" Without waiting for a response I 
plunged back into the FedLect system. 

"Excuse me," she said after a few seconds, "but what is an ep-rom?" 

"That's e-prom with a long e." I couldn't stand her interruptions 
anymore, especially if she couldn't even pronounce the terms she was 
asking about. "Please, Shirley, let me go through the whole system from 
the beginning without stopping. I'll slow down to your baud rate and ex- 
plain everything you don't understand once I've finished. Okay?" 

"Yes, thank you. What's a baud rate?" 

I wondered if Sam had this much trouble working with humans. This 
time I let Shirley's sensors pick up my thoughts. 
"I'm sorry," she said. 

I detected a slight quaver in her upper memory locations that made 
me feel like an autocrat. 

"Listen," I said, trying to be as deferential as possible. "Let's just take 
it nice and easy. Baud rate is the rate at which you can receive informa- 
tion from me. It's simple. It's the speed at which we can talk to each 
other without losing any understanding." Along with my words I sent a 
soft, machine language message that I hoped would reassure her that I 
was not upset with her questions. I just wanted to do the analysis in a 
logical and efficient manner. 

"All right. I think I see now." Shirley's tone of transmission had re- 
verted back to its normal fluffy quality. 

"Excellent. I can bring the FedLect data directly up to your screen if 
you like?" She liked, so I began reviewing the system from the top at a 
pace that was roughly one one-hundredth of my normal retrieval speed. 
The FedLect system is a United Sector States proprietary program that al- 
lows the central government to process national election results within 
minutes of the votes being cast. The system uses software bus technology to 
connect its . . . 

"Remember software bus?" I asked after halting the read-out. 

"Yes. I'm not that stupid, you know." 

I withheld my thoughts on that subject and let the read-out continue. 
. . . central processor to individual votobooth units located throughout 
the country. The central processor stores the buses in eproms. . . . 

I put my disk drives on pause while I brought up the appropriate defi- 
nition of eproms. 

Eprom: An erasable and programmable read-only silicon memory chip in 
which each memory cell or field can be erased by the application of ultra- 
violet light. The erased memory cell can then be reprogrammed with new 
information. 

"Understand?" I asked as soon as the definition had finished. 
"Yes." 

"Good. Let's go on." 

Four hours and twenty-seven minutes after we began, Shirley and I 
finished a system review that would have taken me less than five minutes 
to complete by myself. I really didn't mind though. With Sam out of the 
office anyway, I felt it was time well spent. I dislike sitting around with 
nothing to do. It's a waste of valuable resources — namely me. 

Besides, for all my complaints about Shirley's slowness to under- 
stand things, I really like talking with her. Sam would say it's like pass- 
ing the time with someone you love. For me it's more like reading a good 
piece of literature: my basic comprehension doesn't increase, but I come 
away from the experience with a certain sense of well-being. Communi- 
cating with Shirley has always had this effect on me. And I like it.

FEBRUARY 1983 



Sam returned to the office earlier than expected. 
"Had some luck at the E-M station," he answered in 
response to my query about his arrival. "And my meet- 
ing with Haver didn't last very long." 
I waited silently for a few moments expecting Sam to 
elaborate. When he didn't, I asked, "So?" 
"So what?" he answered. 

Something was up. My partner always liked to play this little game 
with me when he had just contracted a big case. He derives some strange 
pleasure out of my efforts to drag information out of him. Human tech- 
niques of communication can be very frustrating at times, but I went 
along with Sam anyway. "So what did Haver have to say?" 

"Not much." 

"Not much about what?" 

"About FedLect." 

I knew we could carry on like this for hours, so I decided to change 
my tactics. "Did we get the case?" 
"What case?" 

"The FedLect malfunction case," I answered, taking a calculated 
guess as to the nature of our new job. 

Sam looked at me with a surprised expression on his face. "How did 
you know about that?" 

I had him asking the substantive questions now, so rather than an- 
swer I softly hummed an electroharmonic tune. It was Sam's turn to do 
the dragging. 

After a minute or so of listening to my monotonous music Sam final- 
ly said, "All right, Mac. Enough of this. Let's get down to work." 
"I'll agree to that." 

Sam didn't acknowledge my words. Instead he reached over to my 
disk drive console and inserted a shiny, flat, metallic circle. It was his pri- 
vate recording journal. He used it to transcribe odd notes, random specu- 
lations, and the agendas of meetings he had with important people. 

"Read this," he said as he activated my drives. "And then we can 
talk." 

Sam was right. The meeting with Haver hadn't lasted long. I re- 
viewed what was written on the disk in less than twelve seconds. That 
meant the real-time length of the meeting had been just over ten min- 
utes, not long to contract a job with one of the most bureaucratic of all 
government agencies. 

"Pretty hot stuff," I said after making a second pass on the informa- 
tion contained on the disk. "Tell me your first impressions?" 

Sam smiled at me, then reached for the large humidor on top of his 
desk. He withdrew a fat cigar from it, went leisurely through the ritual of 
lighting the eight-inch long tube of tobacco, then looked straight into my 
video-eyes and said, "I think Haver's in over his head. When I got to 
FedLect no one knew I was expected." 

"Strange." 

"Yes, very strange. Especially so since the only human I talked to 
over there was Haver himself." 

That didn't make sense. FedLect had thousands of employees. 
"What do you mean? Weren't there other people? Secretaries, guards . . . 
someone else besides the director?" 

"Of course." Sam paused to take a pull on his cigar, then exhaled the 
smoke directly into my olfactory grid. 

I blitzed my display screen with the word cough in every language I 
could think of. 

"Oh, sorry, Mac. Yes, there were lots of other people. You know 
how FedLect is about its staff requirements." 

The term excessive filtered through my cognizant memory sectors. 
"How did you talk with only one human being then?" 

"FedLect has converted virtually all their internal staff from hu- 
mans to bioengineered androids. There are a few real people left like 
Haver, but damn few. Supposedly it saves the government a lot of money 
and totally eliminates the headache of recruiting for menial positions." 
Sam took another puff on his cigar, but this time he carefully aimed the 
smoke away from me as he exhaled. 

"The androids are really quite impressive, extremely efficient from 
what I saw of them. But Haver was very nervous about the new order of 
things. I suspect that he's afraid it will only be a matter of time before 



he'll be replaced himself." 

Sam reached into his briefcase and pulled out a single legal-sized 
sheet of paper. "And this is the other reason I think Haver is in trouble," 
he said as he held the document up so that I could see it clearly. 

I read the paper quickly. It was an official government contract for 
services made out to the firm of Sledgg and Gate. I had never seen one 
before and I was sure Sam hadn't either. Our firm had a strong reputa- 
tion for honesty and integrity which even the United Sector States re- 
spected. All our previous contracts with them had been sealed with 
Sam's handshake. That was all that was needed. An official contract 
meant only one thing to me: Haver was covering himself in case some- 
thing went wrong. The director didn't want to risk losing his position 
over our failure to perform. 

"What FedLect problem is so bad that Haver would want to cover 
himself like this?" I asked. 

Sam didn't hesitate in answering. "Possible vote fraud." 

I felt a twinge of static electricity discharge through my steel outer 
skin at the thought of what my partner had said. "Impossible." 

"Maybe. But FedLect definitely has a serious problem with their 
vote-compiler system. Fake votes are entering the central register with- 
out triggering any of the rule-violation monitors." 

"How?" 

Sam looked at me with his bushy eyebrows crumpled together into a 
fuzzy letter V. "That, my friend is our job. FedLect has contracted us to 
find out how." 

I paused for a few moments to evaluate our possible courses of ac- 
tion. Then I suddenly realized that regardless of our approach to the 
problem there would be one thing we would have to do. 

"Can we interface directly with the FedLect system, Sam?" 

"Yes and no. Officially we are prohibited by law from entering their 
system. But I think I know a way to get around that." 

So did I. "Shirley?" 

"Shirley." 

Shirley was classified by the National Computer Register as a sub- 
one votobooth alternate. What that meant was she could be used in a 
pinch to transmit votes to FedLect. The government reasoned that Shir- 
ley wasn't smart enough to know how to tamper with any votes that 
might be passed through her system. What they didn't realize was that I 
had improved her base-line intelligence over the years by placing a great 
deal of information at her disposal. One of the results of all this tutoring 
was that when Shirley had a problem she couldn't solve she always came 
to me for help. All we had to do to break into the FedLect system was to 
give her such a problem. 

"Should be easy, partner," I said. "I'll route some test votes through 
her system. If I make them look like the real thing and mask them as to 
origin she's bound to contact me for assistance." 

"Exactly what I had in mind. How fast can you mock up the data?" 
Sam's question carried an element of excitement that I had not seen since 
we had worked out the solution to the Infrared Hologram case. 

"Give me an hour," I answered. 

Sam nodded his head and I went to work. The actual mockup took 
less than thirty minutes to complete, so I used the rest of the time to re- 
fine the random code set used in the software buses of the central vote 
register. 

FedLect uses an ingenious system wherein each vote cast is transmit- 
ted to the central register via a software bus that has been partially erased 
by the central register itself. The programming in the buses is purposely 
written to be redundant and is stored in eproms. Once the central regis- 
ter detects a vote coming in, it randomly selects a memory field it wishes 
to erase and deletes it using ultraviolet light transmitted to the eproms by 
microscopic optical fibers. 

I was trying to match as closely as possible the software bus fields 
that I thought the central register would erase. It was pure guesswork on 
my part. The actual deletion of part of the bus doesn't affect its ability to 
perform its function. The central register uses it as a sort of parity check, a 
way to recognize the vote as being valid because of the way it entered the 
system. It's like taking something away from the bus and knowing that 
the vote coming through on it is okay because you recognize the place 
where the missing part should be. It's a simple system, and supposedly

foolproof. 

"Ready, Sam," I said as soon as I was satisfied with the test data. 

Sam sat at one of my ancillary terminals playing Tinker-Random, a 
game he designed and that only he can play. "Just a second," he said as 
he continued to hammer away at the terminal's keyboard. 

I let a thirty second interval pass, then turned my amplifier up to fif- 
ty decibels and said, "I'm ready, Samuel." 

My partner jumped at the ear-shattering sound of my voice. 

"All right!" he yelled. "Don't get so damned belligerent." Sam turned 
off the terminal and stepped over to his desk. After a short pause he said, 
"Well, what are you waiting for? Let's do it, Mac." 

My red busy light went on as I sent the false voting data to Shirley 
without bothering to respond verbally to Sam. It didn't take long for her 
to contact me. 

"Mac," she said. "Sorry to disturb you, but I've just received some 
information that I don't know what to do with." 

"What information, Shirley?" I tried to sound as sincere as possible, 
but I didn't like tricking her this way. Shirley was a friend. 

"Votes. But I haven't been notified that I should transmit them. 
What should I do?" 

"Just a moment and I'll see." I pretended to go off-line and consult 
with some authority or other. When I thought I had been away long 
enough, I came back on-line and said, "Pass the votes to the FedLect 
central register." 

"Are you sure?" 

"Yes. Now pass them on." 

Without further communication with me, Shirley transmitted the 
votes. The process only took a few seconds and if everything was work- 
ing right at FedLect the false information should have been kicked back 
to her almost immediately. It wasn't. 

The last thing I remember before I passed out was Shirley thanking 
me for my assistance. Then everything went fuzzy. When I woke up she 
was screaming that my Josephson Junctions had overheated, a redun- 
dant warning since I keep a constant watch on those devices at all times. 
It's a matter of life and death for me. 

My Josephson Junctions are composed of two incredibly thin sheets 
of semiconductive material separated by a relatively thick layer of insu- 
lation. Every function of my operating system is subordinate to the criti- 
cal requirement that the ambient temperature around these junctions be 
kept at one degree above absolute zero. These junctions are my informa- 
tion gates, and every piece of data that passes through me must pass 
through them. Gate is not my last name for nothing. 

If the temperature around my gates rises more than a few degrees, I 
start to think sluggishly. More than five or six and I will pass out. The 
junction temperature sensors read twelve degrees above normal. My 
heads still ache. 

It took me a few minutes to recover from the shock to my system. A 
quick examination of myself for any signs of permanent damage re- 
vealed none. The only thing I found wrong was some minor garbling of 
my protocol circuits, which was due as much to Sam's fiddling with my 
keyboard as anything else. 

"Please, partner, keep your hands off," I said as soon as I had 
stabilized. 

Sam stared into my video-eyes with a look of relief. 

"You okay?" he asked as he removed his hands from me. 

"I think so. Excuse me just a minute." I had to calm Shirley. She was 
still upset about the sudden dysfunction of my J-Js and felt that she had 
somehow been at fault. In her typically concerned fashion she made a 
monitor sweep of my autonomic nervous system. I didn't interrupt. "Are 
you satisfied that I'm all right?" I asked as soon as she had finished. 

"Yes. You had me worried. What happened?" 

I didn't know what happened and told her as much. "Did you notice 
anything strange when you sent the votes to the central register?" There had 
to be a connection between that and my period of unconsciousness. 

"No. Only . . ." Shirley paused as if she was unsure of herself. 

"Come on, girl, out with it," I coaxed. 

"It wouldn't be unusual if you hadn't spent so much time with me on 
the works of Sir Walter Raleigh," she finally blurted out. 

Shirley and I had worked together for about two weeks on a pet proj- 



ect of Sam's. He had come up with this crazy notion that tobacco had 
been used by various literary geniuses to help them be more creative. I 
suspected that the whole thing was just an attempt on his part to justify 
his habit, but I made an honest effort to try to find a correlation anyway. 

Sir Walter Raleigh had introduced tobacco to Europe, so Shirley and 
I spent a lot of time reviewing his writings. We never found anything, but 
by the time Sam gave up the project we had read just about everything 
the English nobleman had ever scribbled down. 

"What's the connection?" I asked, puzzled by her reference. 

"It's hard for me to put into words. It's more of a feeling, something 
about the way the votes were accepted by the central register. It felt 
funny." 

I had to have a more concrete description of what she was trying to 
say. "Shirley, can't you be more specific? Please." 

"I'm sorry. The only correlated information that comes close to what 
I felt is . . ." She paused again. I could tell she was trying hard to find a 
word or phrase that would help me. 

"Maybe this will be of some assistance," I said, and then transferred 
everything I knew about Sir Walter Raleigh over to her. 

"That's it!" she yelled. "It was rude!" 

Rude? I thought. That was a distinctly human term. It had no real 
meaning to me. Yet . . . "Sam?" 

"I was wondering when you were going to get back to — " 

"We don't have time for that now. You've got to get Haver over here 
as fast as possible." 

Sam gave me a puzzled expression. "Are you on to something?" 

"Maybe, but I've got to talk with Haver." 

Without further questioning Sam wheeled around in his chair and ac- 
tivated the corn-link. He continued to stare at me with his puzzled look 
as he waited for the unit to connect him with FedLect. 

"And Sam," I said just as Haver's voice crackled through the link, 
"have him bring all the information he has on the new androids." 

My partner's questioning gaze deepened as he passed along my 
request. 

Director Haver smiled at me while I assimilated the data 
he had brought about the government androids. He had 
a toothy grin, a slick, bureaucratic smirk that hadn't 
changed since he had entered the office, not even when 
Sam told him what we had done with the false voting in- 
formation. "That's your business, Mr. Sledgg, " he said. 
Then, without changing his baby-kissing facial expression, he handed 
Sam the android data. 

It took me twenty minutes to complete my evaluation of the data. 
There really wasn't much to it. But there was enough for me to form an 
opinion. 

"Gentlemen," I said as soon as I had finished, "I have a theory." 

Sam was pacing the room, and when I spoke he stopped and glanced 
at Haver. Both men stared into my video-eyes and asked, "What?" 

"I think the FedLect system has a disease." 

Haver's face changed expression for the first time since he had ar- 
rived. "What's your machine trying to tell us, Mr. Sledgg?" he asked af- 
ter giving me a look of superiority that only high government officials 
can give. 

Sam ignored the director. "Mac, please explain." 

I was pleased that my partner was more interested in my hypothesis 
than in Haver's opinion of intellect units. "I believe a virus is infecting 
the software storage devices of the central register," I said, "a bioelec- 
tronic virus. But it will be necessary to run another test to be absolutely 
certain." 

Sam cut his eyes toward Haver. The director was smiling again and I 
could tell that my partner was trying to size the man up to see if he was 
worth the risks involved in running a second test. 

"That could be dangerous, Mac," Sam said as he turned his eyes 
back to me. 

"Fatal." Whatever had caused the FedLect system to malfunction 
had also caused my J-Js to overheat, and I had already calculated my 
odds of surviving a second test at about fifty-fifty. "But if I'm right this 
virus could spread into the national computer network and destroy data

processing as we know it. We've got to be sure." 

Sam pursed his lips and gave a long sigh. He knew I was right. Look- 
ing Haver directly in the face, he asked, "Well, Director, do we have your 
permission to bust the FedLect system again?" 

The director looked uncomfortable. My infrared scanner detected an 
increase in the radiated energy from his facial skin. He was sweating. 
Haver didn't want to make a decision. 

"Well?" my partner asked again. 

"Do what you want," Haver finally said. "But I'll disavow any 
knowledge of this if our security picks up that it was you who broke into 
the system." 

Typical . . . and futile, I thought as I sent a recording of the direc- 
tor's words to my client-communications storage file. 

"Fair enough," Sam said with a sardonic smile. "Mac, how long will 
it take before you're ready?" 

"I'm ready now," I answered. Doping out a new set of test data had 
been an instinctual result of my suspicions. I always prepare for any 
eventuality that has a probability of occurrence greater than fifty per- 
cent. In this case I had already made up my mind to run a second test re- 
gardless of Haver's decision. 

"Okay," my partner said as he reached over to my keyboard and en- 
tered a short string of instructions. "But this time I want to have total 
surveillance on your gates while the test is running." A display of all my 
autonomic functions came up on my screen. After adjusting various con- 
trast and intensity controls Sam added, "Any time you're ready, partner." 

"I'll initiate in sixty seconds." I was glad Sam found some comfort in 
monitoring my J-Js, but I knew he wouldn't be able to stop the virus if it 
attacked my system again. He just wasn't fast enough. To help me his re- 
action time would have to be in nanoseconds, something he was physi- 
cally incapable of. I would have to depend on Shirley for assistance if 
things went bad. And if she couldn't help me then I knew how the test 
would end. I would be dead and the virus would be loosed on the com- 
puter world. 

"Mac?" Sam asked as the last few moments ticked away. 
"Yes, Sam." 
"Good luck." 
"Thank you, Sam." 




he insertion of the false test votes into the FedLect cen- 
tral register went off without a hitch. Everything worked 
as expected until the point where I was supposed to re- 
ceive an accept or a reject message. The central register 
processed the votes okay and sent me a proper accept 
signal. But Shirley was right; it was rude. 



One of the most significant features in all computers is our ability to 
arrange the order in which information is processed. We can take a mass 
of data and line it up in a predetermined order, change that order at will, 
and rearrange the relative position of any piece of information as the re- 
quirements of the job or the user demand. To do this we require one sim- 
ple act on the part of the incoming data: it must ask if it can get in line. 
The votes accepted message ignored the manners of logic and was rude. It 
did not ask. 

I should have known something was wrong then. But I didn't. The 
accept signal pushed its way into my data line and was halfway down my 
input bus before I realized the impropriety of the situation. 

Sam desperately jabbed at my keyboard trying to deflect the bogus 
message before it reached my J-Js. But he was too slow. I knew I had to 
take drastic measures, had to tell Shirley what she must do. 

The rogue information hit the first, thin layer of my junctions and I 
immediately felt woozy. My temperature sensors registered an almost in- 
stantaneous rise of three degrees above normal. If I was to avoid passing 
out I had to act fast. 

"Shirley!" I screamed in ultrafast machine code. "Shunt the auxiliary 
cooling capacity to my J-Js! Hurry!" 

For once in her life Shirley reacted quickly without questioning my 
judgment. Within moments I felt liquid nitrogen wash over my junc- 
tions, cooling them down to a few tenths of a degree above absolute zero. 
Milliseconds later their temperature stabilized, but the danger was not 
over yet. 



The destructive signal had crossed my J-Js during the cooling proc- 
ess and was heading for a data storage cell in my central memory sector. 
It was a question of self-sacrifice and I knew it. As soon as the informa- 
tion stored itself in a cell I switched off all power to that section of my 
brain. It worked. 

Within seconds of the power-off the memory locations where the ac- 
cept message had stored itself ceased to function. I felt the signal die and 
along with it the virulent virus it carried. 

"You can turn the auxiliary cooling off now," I said to Shirley as 
soon as I was sure the disease was dead. "The danger has passed." And 
with it part of my memory, I thought. Part of myself that I could never 
replace. 




f you don't get rid of them then you risk infecting every 
computer in the country," I said flatly. "And that would 
mean the end to your career." 

Haver shook his head at me. "But I don't understand 
how the androids could be involved." He brought his face 
close to my video-eyes and added, "I've got to have a pretty 



strong reason to recommend that FedLect destroy all its new staff 
members." 

I had lost all patience with the director. "How about the prospect of 
an informational dark ages?" I snapped. "The androids carry a bioelec- 
tronic virus that can destroy conventional computer memories. Either 
through error or by a later mutation, your government scientists have 
created an organism that can generate its own light — ultraviolet light. Do 
you know what that means?" 

"No," Haver said adamantly. "I'm an administrator, not a comput- 
er wizard." 

Sam realized I was upset and answered my question to the director 
before I had a chance to say any more. 

"What Mac means is that ultraviolet light is used to erase eproms. 
Any uncontrolled source of radiation in that wavelength could be — no, 
is, devastating to computers. It's the reason your central register accept- 
ed false votes. Hell, it almost destroyed Mac." 

"But why didn't my people detect it?" Haver asked. 

"Because this virus has successfully adapted itself to machine intelli- 
gence," I answered without hesitation. "It's able to ride on the normal 
flow of electric current that runs through a computer and simulate the 
actions of real ultraviolet light emitting devices. You use those in the 
FedLect system." 

I could tell from the director's edgy look that he was about to give in. 

"All right," he said. "But I've got to have some hard proof." 

"This good enough?" I said as I brought up the system logic of the 
missing part of my memory and displayed it on my screen. 

Haver looked at the display for a few seconds then said, "So? It's all 
zeros." 

"Exactly. What you are seeing is roughly one-tenth of my mental ca- 
pacity. I used to have the equivalent of one hundred million words stored 
there, but now ..." 

The director's face hardened as he stared at my screen. "The virus did 
that?" 

"Yes." 

Haver glanced at Sam and then back to my screen. "Then we can't 
take any chances. I'll put out a directive to destroy all the androids as 
soon as possible." 

My partner took Haver's hand and shook it. "Can you do that?" 
Sam asked. 

Haver smiled his bureaucratic smile and said, "Normally, no. But . . . 
shall we say I have some debts owed to me. Besides, I never really did 
like those androids anyway. They lacked ... oh, what's the word?" 

Before Sam could answer I broke in. "Excuse me, gentlemen, but 
Shirley has something to say about that. I'll route her opinion of the 
androids directly to my screen." 

Sam and the director read Shirley's comment and started laughing. 

"It's true, you know," Shirley said to me in a defensive tone. "At 
least that's what Sir Walter Raleigh would have said." 

"What?" I asked. 

"That those androids lack breeding."

Softalk Presents The Bestsellers 



It was a grand and glorious Christmas for all the wee folk who pop- 
ulate microcomputerdom, but it was especially grand and glorious for 
some. So here's a belated Merry Christmas to some in recognition of 
their year-end achievements, as noted in Softalk's poll of December sales: 

To Dan Fylstra, Dan Bricklin, and Robert Frankston, publisher and 
authors of VisiCalc. In the face of the biggest surge in game buying in 
Apple history, VisiCalc managed to wrest the number one sales spot 
away from Choplifter by the narrowest margin ever recorded in a Sof- 
talk poll. One day, VisiCalc may be looked at fondly as a one-hoss shay 
and VisiCorp as a buggy whip manufacturer; but right now VisiCalc has 
no equal and VisiCorp is the Ma Bell of its industry. 

To all the Broderbunders, especially Dan Gorlin. Running second to 
VisiCalc is an honor, particularly when you led it for three months. 
Choplifter may have been the most stunning graphics feat of the year. 

To all the Siroteks of Sir-tech, as well as Andrew Greenberg and 
Robert Woodhead. Wizardry has become a microcomputer phe- 
nomenon all its own, as its resurgence to third place in December shows. 

To Ken and Roberta Williams of Sierra On-Line. During the year 
they consummated a sale for part of their company that made them mil- 
lionaires. And they closed the year with three programs in the top ten po-

To Ultima II author Lord British, who gave his time to summer 
campers and spent long hours studying at the University of Houston 
while putting the final touches on the aforesaid Ultima II. 

To all the folks at Continental Software who gave us Home Account- 
ant, December's number five program and the year-long leader of the 
Home 10 section. 

To the group that never quit at Software Publishing when it looked 
like Personal Filing System might never get off the ground. Now it's fly- 
ing high as December's sixth-ranked program and consistent leader 
among personal filing programs. Its sister programs, Report and Graph, 
aren't doing so badly either. 

To Stan Goldberg of Micro Lab. Since the days of Dogfight in 1980, 
he's persisted in bringing games to market in the face of massive indiffer- 
ence. He even set up Micro Fun as a separate unit to distinguish the 
product from his business wares. There was no indifference to Miner 
2049er, December's eighth-rated program and the second highest new- 
comer to the list. 

To Miner author Mike Livesay, who's just kept improving his skills 
and techniques, even when the market has seemed to ignore him. 

To Dave Gordon and Dan Illowsky, the unlikely duo who gave us 



Snack Attack, consistently one of the top-ranked arcade games. Gordon 
has strengthened his company through the recently announced sales of a 
piece of it to eastern financiers. Illowsky's trying his luck with his own 
company. 

To Doug Carlston for lots of things, including his vision of an ar- 
cade game generator that Chris Jochumson so brilliantly executed in The 
Arcade Machine. 

To Nathan Schulhof, who had the guts to back his Word Handler in 
the face of Apple's giveaway of Apple Writer II and despite the strength 
of Screen Writer II. Now he's number two among word processors. 

To Bruce Zweig, who proved that a college education means some-

The Pizza Program 

Announcing the first dinner menu planning system. 
It will save you time and add new zest to your meals. 
It may even convince your wife buying an Apple* 
was a stroke of genius. 



ENDS HO-HUM DINNERS 

Are you tired of the same old 
thing for dinner? Would you like 
more variety in your evening 
meal? Is there something you'd 
rather have but don't get very 
often? The Pizza Program is 
designed just for you. It's a de- 
lightful new software package 
designed to end the dinner-blahs 
with computer generated menus. 
Here is how it works. 

You review what you like from 
the pre-selected food groups in 
the system. Delete any foods 
you don't enjoy. Add anything 
new at any time. Then decide 
how often you like to eat certain 
items. For example. Don't like 
liver? Then eliminate it with a few 
simple keystrokes. Or, you can 
plan for it as seldom as once every 
99 weeks or as often as daily. 

Want to go out to your favorite 
restaurant? Enter the restaurant's 
name as a "Main Course." Now 
your computer will automatically 
remind you to go out to eat— and 
as often as you select. It will de- 
lete all other items from that meal 
except the name of the restaurant. 

AUTOMATIC SHOPPING LIST 

You get a new menu each week 
orfor just a few days if you want. 
And, it generates a detailed shop- 
ping list, automatically. It can 
arrange each item on the list in 
sequence according to the aisles 
at your favorite store. Studies 
show a shopping list will discour- 
age impulse buying and save 
you money. 

Also, it generates a per serving 
calorie counter. This is easy to 
delete anytime you are not in a 
diet mood or want to celebrate 
for any reason. You never count 
calories unless you want to. 

RANDOMLY DELICIOUS 

Say goodby to boring meals. 
Your computer will remember 
variety is the spice of life. This 
system makes eating at home a 
pleasure again. Each menu is 
randomly generated from major 
food groups according to the 
specific criteria you select. The 
system is easy to learn and easy 
to operate. Yet it is a sophisti- 
cated piece of software which will 
prevent menu mix-ups. 

It will add a new dimension to 
your home meals without increas- 
ing your food costs. It is rumored 
The Pizza Program may actually 
reduce the climbing divorce rate. 
Husbands now have something 
to look forward to for dinner. 
Wives think it is terrific because 



it saves time and effort. And, kids 
love anything computerized. This 
is a useful and practical applica- 
tion you'll appreciate day after 
day, week after week. 

TRY IT FOR 30 DAYS 
WITHOUT RISK 

This tested system is guaran- 
teed to make your life easier and 
happier. Our home trial lets you 
actually use The Pizza Program 
for a full 30 days before you de- 
cide to keep it. Watch the fun and 
convenience it creates. Enjoy 
better meals and see how much 
time it saves. If you are not satis- 
fied for any reason, return it 
within 1 month for a prompt and 
courteous refund. Your invest- 
ment is just $34.50 plus $2.00 for 
shipping and handling. (Califor- 
nia residents add 6'/2% sales tax.) 
Full documentation is included 

OUT OF THE RUT 

One housewife's reaction to 
this program is typical. She wrote, 
"Before using your system I found 
myself getting into a rut of serv- 
ing the same things over and over 
The Pizza Program has changed 
all of this for me. We now have a 
wider variety of dinners and best 
of all I don't have to decide what 
they will be. If this was all it did, 
I'd be thrilled. But it isn't. The 
shopping list I receive along with 
my menus has been such a time 
saver. I quickly run through it 
and delete anything I feel I don't 
need and add something I might. 
I would have a hard time going 
back to doing my menus by hand." 

This system requires an Apple 1 1 
Plus* with 48K and 1 disk drive.

Softalk Presents Hie Bestsellers 



To Mark Pelczarski and all the Chicago Penguins. They made graph- 
ics and animation understandable in a market where most folks still 
think hex stands for the evil eye. And he unprotected his software, too. 

To Don Worth and Pieter Lechner of Quality Software. Their 
Beneath Apple DOS taught us plenty. And their Bag of Tricks brought 
the lessons home. 

To Dav Holle of Phoenix Software. Isn't Zoom Grafix appropriately 
named? 

Of course, these are just salutations to those who had a truly mem- 
orable commercial Christmas. More could be said about each and about 
the many others who have made the past year a better one for Apple 
owners. They too contributed to our happy holidays, and we wish them a 
good new year. 

Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 6.6 percent of all sales of 
Apple and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in January to ascertain their sales for the month of 
December. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was the number of units sold — such other 
criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer store, and personal prefer- 
ence of the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in January represented every geographical area of the continental 
United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index 
number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is an 
arbitrary measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are correla- 
tive only for the month in which they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index 
rating of 50 in one month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in another 
month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus or minus 3.9 percent, which translates roughly 
into the theoretical possibility of a change of 4.41 points, plus or minus, in any index 
number.

you want it, and to all the dealers, without whom we'd all be Radio

And last, but not least, a Happy New Year to Apple lie and Lisa.

Take your marble to 
the top. Pick your spot 
and let it drop. Hope 
for a flip instead of a 
flop. Once you get it, 
the fun never stops! 
It's FLIP OUT — a 
crazy new strategy 
game for one or two 
players. Each marble 
you drop causes a 
chain reaction, so take 
your time and plan 
carefully. Plan right 
and you'll flip, if you 
didn't you Flip Out! 



It is up 
to you to stop the 
invasion of the evil 
Quarriors and save 
Repton. You are armed 
with devastating 
Nuke Bombs, a Radar 
Screen, a Laser Gun 
and an Energy Shield. 
You'll need them all! 
You'll be attacked by 
Nova Cruisers and 
Single Saucers. You 
must avoid Spye 
Satellites and deadly 
Dyne-Beam Shooters 
and you must stop the 
Draynes from deplet- 
ing the Reptonian 
power supply. Repton 
is a battle so thrilling 
you'll be relieved to 
find out you're still on 
earth when it's over! 




Turn your keyboard 
into a typing arcade! 
You can blast attack- 
ing letters and words 
right out of the sky. 
Type Attack was 
designed by a profes- 
sional educator and 
the fast action game 
experts at Sirius. It 
features 39 pre- 
programmed lessons 
and 60 user defined 
lessons. Great sound, 
graphics and a real- 
time words per minute 
bar make improving 
your typing skills fun! 



Talk about adventure 
on the high seas! 
You're blasting away 
at a squadron of 
enemy bombers and 
Kamikaze fighters from 
the deck of your PT 
boat. Suddenly you 
notice the sea is 
loaded with mines and 
an Exocet missile is 
screaming toward you 
on the horizon. Instinc- 
tively you jerk the joy- 
stick to the starboard, 
keeping your thumb on 
the fire button. Phew! 
That was close! Some- 
times it's hard to 
believe Wavy Navy's 
just a video game.
