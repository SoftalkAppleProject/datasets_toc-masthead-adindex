Software aftists? 



TO MAKE THE FIRST BASKET- 
BALL PROGRAM that feels like the 
real thing, it helps to start with two guys 
who know what the real thing feels like. 

Enter Larry Bird and Julius Erving. 
Bird — the hustler, the strong man, 
deadly from outside. Erving —The 
Doctor, maybe the most explosive 
player in the history of the game. 

We talked to them, photographed 
them in action, studied their moves and 
their stats and their styles. Then we 
set out to create on computer disc an 
event which may never happen in real 
life. We put the two of them together 
on a dream court of light, for an elec- 
tronic afternoon of one-on-one. 

It wasn't easy. When 
they talked, we listened. 
When they criticized, 
we made big changes. 
When they gave sug- 
gestions, we took them. 

And it shows. This 
thing is absolutely un- 
canny. You actually 
take on all the skills and 
characteristics of Bird 
or The Doctor — their 
own particular moves, 
shooting abilities, even 
strength and speed. 

You'll meet with 
fatigue factors, hot and 
cold streaks, turn- 
around jump shots, 
and 360 -degree slam 
dunks. But there's some whimsy in 
here, too — a funny referee, a shattering 
backboard, even instant replay. 

It's called Julius Erving and Larry Bird 
Go One-on-One.^You're Bird. Or you're 
The Doctor. And that's the last deci- 
sion you'll have plenty of time to make. 



How we got this years hottest sports game out of 
two rather inexperienced designers.

.nnouncing 
the first computer 
music program that 
actually sounds like 



music 



LET'S FACE IT Up till now, music 
programs for your home computer 
have all sounded, well, pretty lame. 
There were the ones that resembled 
little electronic music boxes, remem- 
ber? And then there were those that 
sounded like so many burps. 

Enter Music Construction Set.™ It's 
the first music program that really 
makes use of the power of that ma- 
chine you've got. If you're a serious 
student, this means you'll be able to 
work with an intricacy and range of 
sound quality you've never heard be- 
fore on a computer. And if you know 
nothing about music, you'll find some- 
thing even more important. Namely, 
that this thing is simple enough to 
be a lot of fun. 

Take a good look at this screen 
because it, you, and a joystick are the 
whole story here. 

That's you at the right end of the 
staff of notes — the little hand. Move 
the joystick, and you move the hand. 
Use it to carry notes up to the staff 
Lay in rests, signatures, clefs, then point 




to the little piano in the lower right 
and listen, because you'll hear the 
whole thing played back. 

Move those little scales in the mid- 
dle up and down to vary the music's 
speed, sound quality, and volume. Use 




the scissors to cut out whole measures, 
then use the glue pot to paste them 
in somewhere else. Got a printer? 
Great. Print the score out and show it 
off to your friends. 

But what if you're not up to writing 
your own stuff yet? No problem. 
There are twelve pieces of music al- 
ready in here, from rock 'n roll to 
baroque. They're fun to listen to, and 
even more fun to change. (Apologies 
to Mozart.) 

The point is, the possibilities are 
endless. But if you're still skeptical, 
visit your nearest Electronic Arts dealer 
and do the one thing guaranteed to 
send you home with a Music Con- 
struction Set in tow. 

Boot one up. Point to the piano. 
And listen.

esof ... 



This month's contest is very simple. What 
follows is an adventure game, just the way it 
would appear on the screen. To make things 
easier, we've taken the liberty of providing all 
the right commands to get you through the 
adventure as quickly as possible. 

"Well, heck," you're probably thinking, 
"what's the challenge?" 

The challenge is to read through the short 
adventure and figure out what the player was 
doing— in other words, what the adventure was 
about. Once you figure that out, write down 
what you think the adventurer was doing and 
send it in. That's it! All you have to write is 
something like, "The adventurer was ..." fill- 
ing in the blank with a sentence or two. If 
necessary, you can follow that with a brief ex- 
planation of why you think that's what the ad- 
venture was doing. Then give the adventure 
game a name, such as "Danger in Uh-oh 
Land," or whatever suits your fancy. 

Just a few rules. First, all entries must be on 
8 '/2 -by- 11 -inch paper. No larger, no smaller. 
You shouldn't need to use more than one sheet 
of paper, but if your entry is more than one 
page, then all pages must be stapled together. 
Your name, address, and phone number must 
be printed on each page of your entry. You can 
use a facsimile of the coupon on this page, but 
it's more important that you write all the infor- 
mation on the entry. 

A prize of $200 to be spent on Apple ac- 
cessories made by Softalk advertisers will be 
awarded to the person who figures out correctly 
what the task of the adventure was. In the case 
of a tie, the snooty random number generator 



(RNG) will send its butier to pick a winner by 
random drawing. All decisions are final (it 
figures). 

Bonus! A special bonus prize worth $50 will 
be awarded to the contestant who turns in the 
most imaginative entry, right or wrong. So even 
if you can't figure out what this adventure was 
about, you still have a chance to win. Any entry 
that gives a description of what was going on, as 
long as it is consistent with the action in the 
advenmre, is eligible to win this bonus prize. 

Entries must be postmarked by February 15, 
1984. No exceptions. 

Does this sound like just the kind of January 
fun that will kick off the new year right? Better 
believe it. So, get adventuring, figure out what 
the heck was going on, and send in your entry 
soon to Softalk Adventure, Box 7039, North 
Hollywood, CA 91605, postmarked by the day 
after Valentine's Day.

ed only for the Apple II, II+, Me, and Franklin computers, the

lot more and costs only $1 19.95. 

At the push of a button, Transtar's innovative new 4-color dia- 
gonal ribbon will print up to 7 colors and more than 30 shades 
in a single pass. 

The 315 is precision-built to exacting standards by Seikosha, 
the most experienced company of the famous Seiko group- 
recognized worldwide for quality and dependability. In fact, 
one of the nicest things about Transtar's 6-month warranty 
on parts and labor is that you'll probably never use it! 

Innovative, inexpensive, dependable, easy: the Transtar 315. 
Color printing has never looked so good! 

Only $599.

You are in a large room. Aluminum artifacts 
lie strewn about. 

> South 

You are at the east end of an east-west 
hallway. 
>West 

You are still in the hallway. There is a door 
to the south. 

> South 

You are in a small room. 

> Describe room 

There are some ceramic bowls here. An 
odd-looking container lies against the southern 
wall. Four transparent bottles sit on a shelf. 

> Get bowls 

You have no need for the bowls . . . yet. 

> Examine bowls 

There is a large one and a smaller one. They 
seem to be made of some blend of kaolin, 
feldspar, and quartz. 

> Examine container 

It seems to be made of organic compounds. 
Inside it are three unidentifiable objects. 

> Examine objects 

The composition of the objects seems totally 
alien. Chemical analysis reveals that the objects 
are composed of a derivative of the Linaceae 
family of plants. 

> Take container 
Taken. 

> Examine bottles 

The bottle on the left contains white, blue, 
and red crystals. The two bottles in the middle 
contain smaller, white crystals. The bottle on 
the right contains a liquid thick as syrup.

> Open door 

You are in the middle of a long north-south 
hallway that stretches very far in both direc- 
tions. 

> North 

You are in the hallway. 

> North 

There's a T intersection here, with a cor- 
ridor leading off to the east. 
>East 

You are in the corridor. There's a huge door 
to the left, with a panel next to it. 

> Describe panel 

It has one button. There is space for another 
button, but it looks like the space was never 
used. 

> Press button 
The door opens. 
>East 

The door closes behind you. There is a door 
here with a panel of two buttons— one green, 
the other yellow. 



> Press green 

The door opens long enough for you to pass 
. . . and then closes. 

> Press yellow 

The door remains shut. Suddenly, the floor 
shakes slightly as though there were a small 
quake. 

>Help 

Try pressing a button. 

> Press yellow 

Strange. For some reason, the door opens 
this time. 

> Go door 

The door shuts behind you. It's very dark 
here; it seems like you're in a small north-south 
corridor. A pungent odor fills the air, which is 
damp. 

> North 

You can hear some loud machinery behind a 
red door. Next to that is a smaller, brown door 
with a sign that reads "Authorized Personnel 
Only!" 

> Open door 
Which? 

> Brown 

Can't you read?! Besides, you can't because 
it's locked. 

> Open red 

The red door is opened 

> Enter room 

The room is totally dark. The sound of 
machinery grows to an almost deafening level. 

> Light torch 

That's an instrument of old adventure 
games. Besides, you don't have a torch. 

> Take inventory 

You have the following: 
A container with some objects made of plant 
derivative in it 
Five small disks 
Seven large disks 

Some sticks with sulfuric substance on the 
ends of them. 

> Rub stick 

How primitive. Try feeling around the 
doorway. 

> Feel doorway 

Aha, a light switch! Flipping it on floods the 
room with light. 

> Examine disks 

They bear some alien inscriptions; differ- 
ent sized disks have different inscriptions. 
However, some of the inscriptions appear on all 
the disks. 

> Read inscriptions 

Though it's all alien, you translate some of it 
as references to ancient religions. 

> Examine room 

Against the west wall are some small doors 
with panels of controls next to each door. Along 
the east wall are similar doors, except that those 
doors open outward. The doors, though they 
appear too small for you to fit through, do not 
appear to be locked. 

>West 

You are in front of some small doors that are 
about waist-high.

Inside the door is a compartment lined with

CONTEST 

WINNERS: An Apple Awarded; 
A Trickster Treated 



A Chicken in Every Pot. That's what 
economic recovery was all about back in the 
thirties. After things got better, Americans went 
beyond having chickens in a pot; two cars in 
every garage became the symbol of success. 

Paul Shanberg (Moraga, CA) isn't counting 
chickens or cars these days; he's counting com- 
puters—his computers. As the winner of the 
Oracle '83 contest, Shanberg received a brand- 
new Apple lie as his prize. Already the owner 
of an Apple II Plus, Shanberg isn't sure yet of 
his plans for the second computer. 

"My son David is in college, and Jeff will 
be in college next year." Paul Shanberg hasn't 



decided who will inherit the II Plus or the He, 
but the decision lies somewhere between the 
toss of a coin and pistols at twenty paces. 

Contest historians might remember that 
Shanberg was a two-time winner in the Oracle 
'81 contest. Though he didn't win any parts of 
the Oracle '82 or '83 contests, winning the big 
prize at the end of this one seems to have made 
up for his absence. Here's how he did it: 

For the first part of the year-long contest, 
Shanberg predicted that on January 25, 1983, 
Apple would armounce the release of the Apple 
He. The announcement came on January 19, 
giving Shanberg a score of minus six points. 



Next, he predicted that Virginia, UCLA, Iowa, 
and Memphis State would all make the Final 
Four in the NCAA Basketball Tournament. 
None of those teams made it. 

Shanberg's big break came when Ben Kings- 
ley, Meryl Streep, and Gandhi won Academy 
Awards for best actor, actress, and picture re- 
spectively. Ten points for each, plus twenty 
bonus points for getting all three brought Shan- 
berg's score up to forty-four. 

Shanberg kept up with the field when Ken- 
tucky Derby time rolled around. Though he 
predicted correctly the sex of the winning horse

Care ! 

We always have you, the 
customer, in mind when developing 
our software and our policies. 
Penguin Software was the first to 
publicly promote unprotected, 
copyable, listable, and modifiable 
applications software. We were the 
first to offer top-quality 
entertainment software at the 
unheard of price of $19.95. But most 
of all, our care shows in the 
software we release. You don't have 
to fight through the documentation 
and you don't have to wrestle with 
the programs. They are written and 
designed with you, the customer, in 
mind. We're on your side. We'll 
always be.

Aichenbach, Bavaria - Agent 
0019.95, Freddie Pinto, 
affectionately know as 'The Spy" to 
his admiring fans, has once again 
left the comforts of an 
administrative post to do what he 
does best: Terrorizing terrorists and 
cracking codes. 

0019.95's spokespenguin, 
Maynard, told the press that his 
client was winging his way to 
Central Europe as a tourist, bent on 
studying the architecture of 
medieval castles. But inside sources 
informed this reporter that there is 
more to this jaunt than simple 
tourism. The rumor mill has it that 
the sinister Dr. X. Tortion has come 
out of retirement for one more fling 
at international blackmail. The Dr., 
readers may recall, was last seen 
attempting to obliterate Outer 
Mongolia by dumping E.T. 
cartridges on it, an undertaking 
which he lamentably failed to 
achieve. 



Hi 



Ask 
Adelie 



Dear Adelie 

Every time I try to write a program 
that other people are going to use, 
it's always so tedious making sure 
that it won't bomb when they type 
weird things, putting in help 
screens, and making the screen look 
halfway decent. And then, when I 
have to sort things, it's always so 
slow because I don't know any fast 
sort routines in BASIC. Now my 
girlfriend won't talk to me because 
I'm always stuck at the keyboard 
trying to get the programs right, 
and my dog just sits around lifeless 
and bored while watching my 
sort routine take 3 hours. My boss 
says I better shape up, the landlord 
wants to kick me out, my tennis 
game has gone down the tubes, my 
car has a flat tire, my sofa 
exploded, the refrigerator melted . . . 



. and 



id on 



Dear On and On . . . 



Can't help with the sofa, but we 
passed your letter on to the 
Professor von Rockhopper of the 
Institute for Amiable Applications 
Software, and he suggested a new 
program called Short Cuts, an 
unprotected utility from Penguin. 
With it you can easily add machine- 
language sorts, customized input 
and print routines, and a wealth of 
other helpful features to Applesoft 
BASIC, making your programming 
life a lot easier. P.S. Plug in the 
refrigerator. P. P.S. The sofa?

SNAFU 



Nanuk, Pengolia (PNS) - The tiny 
nation of Pengolia discovered a 
slight hitch in its defense systems 
yesterday when it experienced an 
attack by a swarm of unidentified 
robots. 

When its defense team, known as 
Minit Men, leapt into action (and 
the Huey choppers purchased from 
American Army-Navy surplus 
stores), they discovered that the 
particle beam generators guarding 
the base were more of a nuisance to 
them than to the invaders! At last 
report desperate Pengolian pilots 
were dropping like flies at the hands 
of their own defense weapons! 
Between the mutating robots and 
the haywire security systems the 
situation looks desperate if not 
hopeless. The last transmission 
received from Pengolia contained a 
worldwide appeal for volunteers 



Answer to Trivia 

They are among over thirty 
companies that publish arcade, 
adventure, or educational software 
created with the aid of The 
Graphics Magician. And now, the 
new version of The Graphics 
Magician is available on several 
different computers, with the added 
bonus that you can transfer 
graphics files between the different 
systems. No more redrawing 
pictures in order to have them run 
on a variety of micros!

Fastalk is a quick guide to popular, specialized, 
new, and classic software. When you need a particu- 
lar kind of program or just want to see what's new, 
Fastalk is the place to look for fast answers. 

If a program has been reviewed in Softalk, it car- 
ries the issue date of the review in italics at the end of 
its listing, and the capsule description given reflects 
the published review. 

A new software entry, which must be of profes- 
sional quality to be included, is designated by a check 
mark preceding its name. A new entry loses its check 
mark after its first appearance and drops out of 
Fastalk after one to three appearances (depending on 
genre) if it fails to gain popularity. 

A bullet preceding a title indicates a program that 
Softalk has designated as a classic, based on its ability 
to stand up over time, its significance for its time 
(breaking new ground or introducing a new genre), or 
its archetypal qualities. 

Other entries in Fastalk are there either by virtue 
of current activity (the programs are selling at least as 
much as the least-selling entry on any of the bestseller 
charts) or because they are representative of the best 
of programs for a special interest or need (such as 
card games or non-Basic-specific language terminal 
programs). 

Softalk may arbitrarily omit any package from 
Fastalk, whether or not it meets the foregoing

Make beautiful music. Everyone loves 
music. And anyone who has ever hummed 
a tune can write one, now. Scarborough has 
taken the universal language of music and 
developed a software program that makes it 
fun and easy to write songs for budding 
composers of any age. 

Even those who don't recognize a single 
note can be composing songs in 15 minutes. 
Simulated piano roll graphics and on-screen 
commands serve as a guide every step of 
the way — from scales and rhythm to more 
complex musical forms and theory. 

With Songwriter, composing songs is as 
simple as "do-re-mi." Write a song, change, 
delete or add a note, change tempo and 
teach the computer to repeat musical 
motifs. Even save compos i tions to p la y b a ck 



through the computer or your home stereo. 
For added fun, there is also a library of 28 
popular songs to listen to and experiment 
with, as well as a series of educational 
activities for adults and children. 

Songwriter is like a word processor for 
music that will bring the whole family back 
to the computer, again and again — because 
Songwriter encourages experimentation 
and makes the whole process fun. Isn't that 
why you bought a personal computer in the 
first place? 

Every kid has a song in his heart. (So does 
the "kid" in every parent!) Help yours 
express it with Songwriter.

Be quick on the draw. PictureWriter is 

magin! Cmatft any shapft or pattftrn, 

instantly. Fill areas with glowing colors and 
even hear pictures set to music. 

PictureWriter brings out the artist in any- 
one. With this program, your child can 
create his or her own picture gallery and 
watch the computer redraw the pictures like 
magic on the screen. PictureWriter also 
includes a library of masterpieces by other 
"picture writers" that can be colored, edited 
and redrawn. 

Like all Scarborough programs, Picture- 
Writer encourages experimentation and 
continually challenges the child to explore 
new avenues. And all the while, Picture- 
Writer subtly develops the child's familiarity 
with the fundam e ntals of step by step com- 
puter programming. 

Getting started is simple. The built-in 
tutorial zips the artist into the program 
quickly and keeps him or her creatively 
occupied for hours. 

The possibilities are endless with Picture- 
Writer. In fact, children find it so captivating 
that parents will probably want to doodle 
with it, too. And why not? 

You can't stay an adult forever.

Videoterm" The Best Selling 80-column Card For Apple® 



By the end of 1982, the Videoterm had outsold all other 80-column cards two to one. Today, the 
Videoterm continues to be the standard for the Apple ][ and Apple ][ plus. This is the ideal 
80-column card for word processing, spreadsheets, and other business applications. 

With the Videoterm, you can display your text with a 7 x 9-dot matrix which provides 
upper and lower case letters with true descenders. The single-wire shift mod is 
also supported. The Videoterm will list both Integer and Applesoft BASIC pro 
grams using all 80 columns without splitting keywords. The popular ESCape 
sequence editing capabilities and a stop-list function using Control-S 
are supported. If you install the Videoterm in Slot #3, it will automat- 
ically be used by Pascal and CP/M, since these operating systems 
recognize the Videoterm as a standard video display terminal 

Apple He Kit 

This kit contains an OPTIONAL Videoterm firmware and a rede- 
signed Softswitch for the Apple lie. This OPTIONAL firmware is for a 
BASIC programmer and includes: NORMAL, INVERSE, HOME, and lower- 
case entry of BASIC commands. 

The Videoterm has no trouble keeping up with 1200 baud modems during normal printing or scrolling. The Videoterm is 
not compatible with cards plugged into the auxiliary slot of the Apple He. For this situation, we recommend the 
UltraTerm display card. 




Videoterm Utilities Disk 

The six programs on the Videoterm Utilities Disk will complement the creativity of the 80-column screen. This disk con- 
tains: 

GRAPHICS TEMPLATE — Create a business form in 80 columns 
SCROLL UTILITY PROGRAM— Set a window in 80 columns PASCAL DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS 
FONT EDITOR— Create new character fonts VIDEXGRAPHICS— Provides MID-RES Graphics in Pascal 

READ SCREEN— Read characters from screen locations MID-RES GRAPHICS— Graphics in 80 columns 



Alternative Characters 
n 9 



Spanish 

§rtr I O 

i N 



French 

£a**9§'eiie 



The Videoterm comes with ASCII 
standard character set. There is a 
second socket for an alternate 
character set. You may choose 
from foreign languages, inverse, 
underline, APL language, symbol 
(math and Greek), and line drawing 
graphic character sets. 



Soft Video Switch 




The Soft Video Switch knows 
whether it should display 40 or 80 
columns or Apple graphics. It does 
the tedious work of video-switching 
so you don't have to.

Inc. VIdeotIrm is a trademark of Videx, Inc. 



Switchplate 



Some programs 
(especially those that 
use Run-Time Pascal) 
write directly to the 
40-column text page and 
do not use standard 
video-switching pro- 
tocol. For these pro- 
grams, the Switchplate 
allows you to easily tog- 
gle to the 40-column 
video output.

Time for your computer to make the telephone con- 
nection - with an intelligent, full 21 2A 300/1 200 
baud modem - with a real time clock/calendar - 
and with the capability to expand into a com- 
plete telecommunications system. It's time for 
PRO-MODEM 1200. Much more than just a phone 
modem. 

When you're on-line, time is money. PRO-MODEM 
telecommunication systems help you save. By 
monitoring the duration and cost of your phone 
calls. And by sending and receiving messages, 
unattended, at preset times when the rates are 
lower. . .with or without your computer. 

Compare the $495 PRO-MODEM 1 200 with any other 
modem on the market. For example, you'd have to 
buy both the Hayes Smartmodem 1200 plus their 
Chronograph for about $950 to get a modem with 
time base. 

PRO-MODEM 1200 is easy to use. A convenient 
"Help" command displays the Menu of operating . 
command choices for quick reference whenever 
there's a question about what to do next. Extensive 
internal and remote self-diagnostics assure that the 
system is operating properly. Some of the other 
standard features include Auto Answer, Touch 
Tone and Pulse Dialing, and Programmable Intelli- 
gent Dialing. 



PRO-MODEM does more. It lets you build a full tele- 
communications system with features like Auto 
Dialer, Incoming and Outgoing Message Buffering, 
Business/Personal Phone Directory, Program- 
mable Operating Instructions, a 12-Character 
Alpha-Numeric Time and Message Display, and 
versatile PRO-COM Software. PRO-MODEM com- 
mands are Hayes compatible so you can use most 
existing telecommunications software without 
modification. 

There's much more to the PRO-MODEM story. See 
your local dealer for complete details. He'll show 
you how to save time. And money.

Retail Report 

I always like to stir up a little controversy, and 
I'm getting pretty tired of the piracy debate, so 
maybe I can start a new one: Can anyone think 
of a good computer store? 

Here I am, in the Boston area, the center of 
East Coast high tech, and I can't find a com- 
puter store worthy of my patronage. Here's 
what I find in the typical computer store: carpet, 
paneling, about five computers set up, ten 
books for sale on a shelf, and four or five sales- 
people having coffee in a back room or sitting 
hunched over one of the computers ignoring 
everyone. When one of these "experts" finally 
comes to my assistance, I almost always find 
that he or she knows less about Apple hardware 
and software than a high school student in a be- 
ginning computer class! 

But the real topper is when you find out that 
they don't deal with the "home market." Their 
business is with businesspeople only (read: peo- 
ple who have more money to spend than 
brains — and it's usually someone else's money). 

I even had one salesperson admit that there 
was no profit in dealing in nonbusiness prod- 
ucts! Well, they certainly won't make any profit 
off me. 

There is another kind of computer store. 
This one has racks and racks of software— 
almost all games — for every kind of computer 
you can imagine. There is no hardware at all, 
except for a few joysticks and trackballs. And 
behind the counter (if you can get his attention 
away from his current game of Wizardry) is a 
pimply faced teenager who speaks only assem- 
bly language with a Martian dialect. Not much 
help when you need a printer ribbon or an 
eighty-column card. 

When someone wants to know who my com- 
puter dealer is, I just make something up. I do 
almost all of my dealing by mail order. They al- 
ways have the best prices, and shopping around 
is much easier. What about service or personal 
attention? With the stores in my area, I'd do 
better asking the mailman! 

Actually, I am very grateful for Call 
-A.P.P.L.E. and their hot line. They've gotten 
me through difficult problems in the time it 
would take most computer salesmen to figure 
out how to dial the number! Unless someone 
manages to come up with a computer store with 
a decent stock of hardware and software and an 
intelligent staff willing to deal with "little peo- 
ple," I guess I will remain a recluse, coming 
out only to look in the mailbox for my latest 
order. 

Scott E. McCullough, Wakefield, MA 



Shared Perspectives 

While I may not be in a position to speak with 
authority, my eleven years as a professional in 
the computing industry has given me some per- 
spectives on copy protection that I would like to 
share with readers. 

Copy protection for business software is ab- 
surd to me. What the software house needs is an 
agreement whereby they will have legal re- 
course, if necessary, to protect their invest- 
ment. Capitalists (read: business people) under- 
stand and (for the most part) respect licensing 
agreements. Why risk a legal snarl over what is 
typically an inconsequential amount of money 
(less than $5,(X)0?). 

Copy protection for game software is 
another matter. Any copy protection scheme 
can be broken; all you can do is make sure that 
it is not cost-effective to break. To do so re- 
quires some work with the computer manufac- 
turers to get some hardware that will help do 
this. One approach would be a hardware identi- 
fication number built into a custom, proprietary 
USI device along with other circuitry required 
for operation of the microcomputer. 

The operating system for purchased pro- 
grams would have to be modified to hold the 
code of the authorized machines. Starting to get 
complicated? Could a hacker still copy and run 
the software? Yes, on both counts. Maybe try- 
ing to recover the so-called lost revenues due to 
pirating is not cost-effective. But at least the 
above approach would allow honest people to 
back up their programs with multiple copies. 

Hackers and pirates have been getting some 
national attention lately. What do you do with 
them? Prosecute the ones with criminal intent 
and hire the ones who are doing it for the chal- 
lenge! We have done things when we were 
younger that bordered on the illegal or im- 
moral. As a retired hacker, I can understand 
someone who enjoys the challenge of breaking 
the copy-protection on a game disk. It can be 
more challenging than the game. Let's harness 
that creative energy and put it to productive use! 

Despite appearances, I do not agree with 
piracy. I believe software houses must pros- 
ecute organized piracy such as is found in 
some computer user groups. Piracy of software 
is a criminal act, and those selling pirated goods 
are professional criminals by definition. Soft- 
ware houses should boycot magazines that pub- 
lish advertisements for copymg sortware and 
hardware. Distribution agreements should guar- 
antee that dealers handling your software will not 
sell software for making copies. The display of 
a copy program next to your program lends an 
air of respectability to pirating. Licensing 
dealers to create backup copies for customers 
would also help, if the price was reasonable. 

In closing, hats off to Infocom for using the 
"dongler" and not messing with disk copy pro- 
tection, and to Penguin for not bothering to do 
anything. You have gained the respect of the 
honest users. 

Jeff Muchow, Dublin, CA 



The Analogy Examined 

I don't pirate software, yet 1 remain impartial 
about the software piracy debate. 1 am replying 
to Rudy J. Stricklan's paternal letter (September 
Open Discussion). Mass production of Ferraris 
lowers the cost per unit only to a point— labor 
and expenses prevent further price reduction. 
However, the labor and materials expenses in- 
volved in the communication of information— 
which is what happens when you copy a disk- 
are minimal. The analogy fails on this. The 
software piracy issue, should it ever be re- 
solved, will be clarified by neither such logical 
failure nor such emotional catharsis as Mr. 
Stricklan offers us. 
Ken Sherwood, Reading, PA 

An Expert Beginner 

The September Softalk has finally goaded me 
into booting up the old word processor. First, 
Fastalk no longer lists The Accountant by Deci- 
sion Support. Then, in Open Discussion, Herb 
Abelson adds one more voice to the chorus 
wailing over the limitations of the top-selling 
Home Accountant by Continental Software. 

I am a user of The Accountant, and as a rela- 
tive novice to computers and home financial 
management, I have been deeply impressed 
with both the ease and effectiveness of the pro- 
gram. I researched software while saving up the 
money to pay for my He, and at the time it was 
clear that Home Accountant and most of the 
other family finance programs are just too limit- 
ing and authoritarian. In fact, I would suggest 
that, despite its sales, the Home Accountant 
"emperor" is at best underdressed. It's as- 
tounding to me that most of the literature on the 
subject doesn't make this more clear, but I sus- 
pect it's because most reviews are generally 
based on brief usage; the assets and liabilities of 
most financial tools only become obvious with 
prolonged use. 

Another reader wrote that The Accountant is 
excellent, but not suitable for beginners. Well, 
I'm not an authority on much, but on being a be- 
ginner I'm an expert. This program gently guid- 
ed me into organizing my records so that I now 
understand where my money is going so quick- 
ly. And, unlike other programs. The Accountant 
is flexible; I was able to guide it into accepting 
my "system" of bookkeeping, and Decision 
Support is tolerant of dumb questions. That 
alone may justify the price. 

No, no— you can't make me sign off without 
adding my two cents to that huge pile of pennies 
known as "The Great Pirating Controversy." I 
suspect that program copying falls somewhere 
between taping phonograph records and shop- 
lifting. In both cases, one is acquiring some- 
thing without paying for it. In both cases, oth- 
er consumers will often have to pick up part of 
the tab. But the amount of harm being done var- 
ies drastically. 

Possible solutions certainly aren't in short 
supply. For example, a small users 's fee could 
be tacked on to the price of new disks, or copy 



40 

programs, or even computers. (Is he crazy?) 
The revenues would then be distributed among 
the software sellers who don't protect their pro- 
grams. But I recognize that such ideas are po- 
litically and operationally impractical. 

There probably isn't a fair, short-term solu- 
tion. In the long run, I'm just ignorant enough 
to believe that as the technology changes (and 
specifically the media by which programs are 
distributed) someone will develop a reasonably 
effective way of charging for software use. 

In the meantime, software designers and 
distributors will continue to try earning the 
maximum margin of profit, and copiers will 
continue to avoid paying for programs when- 
ever possible. It's part of the inevitable (and 
hopefully temporary) price we pay for being 
members of a species that has the ambition and 
brains to dream up computers and software in 
the first place. 
Henry Tenenbaum 

Specialized Rewards 

I recently received Softalk in the mail, and one 
thing caught my eye right away. This magazine 
is all about computers. Even the ads are all 
about computer- related products. It sure is nice 
to see a thick computer magazine that does not 
contain cigarette, whiskey, or car ads— just 
computer goodies! Softalk, I salute you; keep up 
the great work!

Printer Publications 

As Epson America's publication manager, I'd 
like to comment on the October article on the 
MX printer by Bill Parker. 

First, I'd like to express our appreciation for 
the extensive coverage of our printers in Sof- 
talk. We want our users to get the most out of 
their printers, and Mr. Parker's long-term ac- 
quaintance with the printers, as well as his 
clear, straightforward writing style, surely help 
achieve that objective. There is one problem 
with long-term acquaintance, however. Old 
friends may not notice when you change. 

Until the autumn of 1982, Epson produced 
its user manual through outside contractors. 
Thus, the MX Printer Manual, as is noted on its 
title page, was published not by Epson but rath- 
er by David A. Lien's Compusoft Publishing. 

To serve its users better, last fall Epson 
America created an internal publications depart- 
ment, fully staffed with professional writers and 
editors. Our charter is to make Epson's user 
manuals for the U.S. marketplace match the 
high quality of our hardware and software prod- 
ucts. 1983 has been a year of rapid growth in 
documentation, paralleling the growth in the 
product line. Epson hardware manuals (and 
some software manuals) now include such user 



JANUARY 1984 



aids as indexes, technical summaries in appen- 
dixes, quick-reference cards, and introductory 
material explaining how to fmd what you need 
in lengthier manuals. 

One of our first publications was the FX-80 
Printer User's Manual by David A. Kater. 
Manuals are now being revised to include the 
wider models , FX- 1 00 and RX- 1 00 respectively .

Reinking the Problem 

I received my October issue of Softalk and have 
been working long hours on the contest (Trick 
or Treat). I have thirteen more items to find. 
This contest makes a person read every word; I 
guess that's one of your tricks. There is one ad- 
vantage to this: Even though I may not win the 
contest and may wind up with a dog-eared 
magazine, I am learning more about my com- 
puter. 

When reading Bill Parker's Hardtalk, I 
found the topic of Epson ribbons very interest- 
ing. That's my only gripe with my Epson 
MX80F/T (Graftrax 80), the ribbon's ink 
doesn't last very long. I've had my Apple II 
Plus set up since March 1982 and would have 
had to buy six ribbon cartridges. As frugal as I 
am, after the first cartridge's ink gave out, I 
knew that wasn't going to work. 

I found the ribbon itself wasn't wearing out, 
so I decided to reink the ribbons myself. I talked 
to the owner of a local ComputerLand, inquir- 
ing about ink. He stated he didn't know if there 
was a special ink sold for that purpose. I had 
some ink I used for rubber stamps, and asked 
him if that would work. His answer: "I don't 
know!" I didn't want to mess up my only rib- 
bon cartridge, so I decided to buy a new one. It 
was my luck that he didn't have one in stock, 
but he had an old one he said I could have. That 
started my reinking days. 

Here's how it's done: Remove the top lid 
with a pocketknife (being careful not to break 
off the guide pins). With an eyedropper, drip a 
steady line of ink over the ribbon in the tray. 
(You will find the ribbon is wound accordian 
style; don't disturb the ribbon.) Drip only one 
steady line; replace lid. Set aside for at least a 
week, turning the exposed ribbon into the car- 
tridge with the small knob every few days. The 
ink will distribute itself evenly. I have two rib- 
bon cartridges now, so I reink the cartridge 
when I replace the old one with my spare. That 
way it's ready when I need it. Be careful not to 
overink the ribbon, or you will have to blot the 
excess off. I used a folded paper towel, rotating 
the ribbon with the small knob (don't open the 
cartridge when doing this). I've reinked each 
ribbon three times so far. The ribbons are in ex- 
cellent shape and there have been no ill effects 
to my printer. I clean and lube my printer when 
I replace the ribbon.

copy of DOS Toolkit available, so I looked else- 
where for my lower-case character set. I found 
the complete Apple III set on the Basic disk that 
comes with Business Basic. By copying the 
"standard" font to a newly formatted disk and 
using the Trackmover program to copy track 1 
to $1000, the character set can be found at 
$1200. Lower-case characters will begin at 
$1308 and end at $13D0. The same font can 
also be found in the console driver, somewhere 
early in the disk depending on what else is on 
the disk. 

This brings up the possibility of using any of 
the fonts supplied with Business Basic for the 
emulation disk. Just copy the font to a blank 
disk with the aid of Trackmover. It can be found 
in $1200 with the CHAREDIT program. Con- 
versely, the other fonts can be patched into the 
console driver so they can be used without the 
use of the Download. inv invokable module. 

The lower-case emulation disk does not 
work with some commercial software, such as 
VisiCalc II. And when using it with Apple Writ- 
er II, the shift and alpha-lock keys do not work, 
but upper case could be generated with the 
escape key. Some copy-protected software must 
have a lower-case filter installed. 

I did not attempt any of the game paddle 
routines, as I use the Micro-Sci board with Ap- 
ple n game paddles. I did try to increase mem- 
ory with modifications to the lower-case emula- 
tion disk and DOS but could not detect any 
increase in memory with the FRE(O) statement 
in Applesoft, nor by any other method. Any 
suggestions along this line would be helpful. I 
hope to try some of the exotic emulation modifi- 
cations in the future. 

The Trackmover program seems to have po- 
tential in modifying SOS in other interesting 
ways, and I am looking forward to articles 
along this line in the future.

I think I might be able to shed some light on

"Syncopation in 3/3 Time" (June '83). I've 
made several interfaces for use of the 
MM58167 clock chip in the Apple II using both 
the 6520 PIA and the 6522 VIA. 

The 58167 "go" command, as Jeppson 
mentions, sets the counters from faster than a 
minute (seconds, tenths-of-seconds, and so 
forth) to zero. What he failed to mention, and 
what National Semiconductor's documentation 
also omits, is the fact that the minutes counter is 
incremented (by 1) if the tens-of-seconds count- 
er contains a 4 or 5 when the "go" address is 
referenced. Thus, while the "go" command 
supposedly permits starting the clock at a 
known time, it is easy to end up a minute off. 
Addressing the counter reset address with the 
proper data on the data lines is a surer way of 
zeroing the counters faster than minutes, as 
there is no danger of unintentionally increment- 
ing minutes. 

While it is legal for several of the fixed-in- 
terval interrupts to be active simultaneously, the 
effect is the same as if only the highest-fre- 
quency interrupt is active. The interrupt is 
specified at 10 Hz, a 100 Hz interrupt can be 
obtained in the "alarm clock" interrupt mode

— Here is what one of o\ir users, a Washington D.C. 
channel 4 newscaster wrote to Soltalk 

As a computer novice and accounting illiterate, I set out to make a home 
finance program my first major software purchase. I fear Softalk's 
Fastalk column led me astray. 

The Home Accountant is called "thorough and powerful." The 
Accountant is more expensive and gets modest descriptions like 
"simple-to-use" and "a sleeper." The choice should be obvious. 

In fact, I believe The Accountant (the more expensive program) is so far 
superior as to justify the cost. It gives the user credit for brains but will 
handhold you through a remarkably effective double-entry system. That 
part might scare people off. In fact, it makes this program more 
enjoyable, as well as being educational and practical, but not more 
difficult. The documentation and tutorial are excellent, and Decision 
Support Software gives excellent user support.

by writing "don't care" states into all latches 
except thousandths-of-seconds. If any number 0 
through 9 is written to that latch, an interrupt is 
generated every time the counter and latch 
match, which happens 100 times each second. 

The problems encountered with the reset 
registers are probably the result of timing in- 
compatibilities between the 6502 microproc- 
essor and the 58167 clock chip. The 58167 was 
designed to work with 8080 and Z-80 type sys- 
tems. Those processors put data on the bus 
much earlier than the 6502 on a "write," and 
permit "wait" states on write cycles. Thus 
proper data is available when the reset registers 
are addressed, and the 58167 can stop the proc- 
essor entirely until that data has been latched 
internally . 

In a 6502 system, the address is valid up to 
600 nanoseconds before the data becomes valid. 
Thus the 58167 could very well be responding 
to invalid data at the reset addresses. 

One solution to the problem is to use both 
ports of the interface adapter to interface the 
clock chip. Drive the clock's data lines with the 
A port and the address, read, and write lines 
with the B port. The data to be written to the 
clock can then be latched in the A port before 
the address is written to the B port. The timing 
differences between the 58167 and the 6502 can 
be easily accommodated in this manner. 
F. Kuechmann, Vancouver, WA 

Ill's Allowance 

The October Softalk had an excellent article by 
John Jeppson on writing a spooler for the Apple 
III. However, John made one incorrect state- 
ment. He said that all Apple III word processors 
prevent you from printing to a block device so 
that you cannot print to disk without using his 
special character driver. Apple Writer III does 
allow you to print to disk if the file you are 
printing to already exists. Try it. Simply save 
the file to be printed using the normal Apple 
Writer III save command (for example, 
".d2/printfile"). Then change the print destina- 
tion to this same name. Type control-P followed 
by "PD.d2/printfile". Finally, print the file as 
normal (control-P NP). You will then have an 
ASCII file on disk that is a print image, all 
ready for the spooler. Be sure to delete "print- 
file" before printing a smaller document to 
disk. For some reason, Apple Writer ///doesn't 
reset its end-of-file pointer when it prints to 
disk. As a result, the rest of the old, larger file 
will still be treated as part of this new file.

Preteen Turtle Tales 

I am twelve years old. My dad and I have been 
learning GraForth and love it. When we got our 
computer, my dad wanted me to learn to pro- 
gram instead of playing the great adventure and 
other games. We borrowed Apple Logo and 
used it for a couple of weeks. At first it seemed 
neat to draw pictures, but that got boring fast. 
Then my dad heard about GraForth and bought 
it through the mail because our computer store 
didn't carry it. We discovered that GraForth 
had turtle graphics just as good or even better 
than Logo. We also discovered that GraForth 
allows you to make beautiful music and allows 
very, very fast animation with characters and 



three-dimensional objects. It's so exciting, I'm 
thinking about writing my own arcade game! 

It is strange that Logo is on the Bestsellers 
list when GraForth has turtle graphics just as 
good and easy to use. Although the turtle graph- 
ics of GraForth is as easy to learn as Logo turtle 
graphics, I must admit that I required my dad's 
help for the neater things of GraForth. 
David Anders, Logan, UT 

Pictures and Praise 

Can anyone tell me whether Apple Logo pic- 
tures can be printed without a graphics card, 
and if so, how? Inasmuch as I have a graphics 
dump program (Printographer), all I need to 
know is how to get the picture onto disk as a 
picture rather than as a procedure. 

I'll also take this opportunity to second 
Thomas E. Militello's praise of The Spread- 
sheet 2.0 (November Open Discussion). Any- 
one interested in knowing more about The 
Spreadsheet 2. 0 can read the review of Magi- 
calc on page 181 of the same issue. Circumstan- 
tial evidence indicates that The Spreadsheet 2. 0 
is a generic version of Magicalc. 

Here's some more praise— for The Account- 
ant, by Decision Support Software. I tried both 
The Accountant and Home Accountant, then 
bought The Accountant, which I found to be 
faster, more powerful, and easier to use- 
superior in every way except for packaging and 
price. It costs twice as much as Home Account- 
ant, but it's a much better value. 

Many letters to Open Discussion praise 
companies that support their products. These 
testimonials are nice to see and potentially val- 
uable to readers, but it's good to bear in mind 
that much of this praise goes to companies 
whose support was needed because their prod- 
ucts failed to perform as expected. It's good to 
deal with a company that supports its products, 
but I'd rather deal with a company whose prod- 
ucts don't need support.

Hamming It Up 

Any computer-using educator who is a ham ra- 
dio operator and would like to start a Computer 
Educators Round Table should contact me, 
Wayne Ayers, at Culver City Middle School, 
4601 Elenda Street, Culver City, 90230. Or 
listen for us on Sunday afternoons, 1:00 p.m. 
PST at 7240 -t- or -. 

The Round Table will be an informal net- 
work through which we will discuss such things 
as hardware and software, how to set up a com- 
puter lab, staff in service, how to win over re- 
luctant staff members, curriculum develop- 
ment, textbook selection, lab security, and how 
to encourage people from all subject areas to 
make use of the computer lab. I do not claim to 
have all the answers; it is my hope that we can 
learn from each other.

Print School 

In response to Tim Johnson's letter in the No- 
vember Open Discussion: Our school has a 
Dynax DX-15 printer with an Apple He, but 
with an Epson parallel interface. We also have 
two Apple DMPs with the Apple interface. The 
Dynax/ Apple/Epson system works almost per- 



fectly with Apple Writer lie or the older Apple 
Writer. The all-Apple systems do not. Our Ap- 
ple dealer has informed us that a chip in the 
interface is bad and he will replace it as soon as 
the chips have been received from Apple. I 
don't know if this is an isolated case or a com- 
mon problem with the Apple interface, but it 
might be worth checking. 

Also, Mr. Johnson should make certain he is 
accessing the special print features of the Dynax 
correctly. The procedure that works with Apple 
Writer He is control- V, escape, code symbol, 
control-V, space. The double-print code symbol 
is F, shadow print is W. Use the & code symbol 
with the above sequence to clear and return to 
the normal print mpde. 

We have had the Dynax for about five 
months and have been very pleased with it. Its 
only disadvantage seems to be that it is rela- 
tively slow for a printer. For us, its advantages 
far outweigh this disadvantage. 
Bruce Faitsch, Guilford, CT 

Hash Bash 

1 am writing in response to the letter from Roy 
C. Bennett (October Open Discussion). Yes, I 
have had Screen Writer //trash some files, and 
yes, I discovered a cure. 

The best solution is to buy a second disk 
drive. The program uses the output file disk as 
virtual memory (that means they're making the 
computer think it has more RAM than it does by 
using the disk as RAM). This allows you to 
write files that are larger than the 48K in your 
machine (the program itself uses some of this). 
To avoid hash, just assign the output file to 
drive 2 and save all your files to drive 1 . If you 
don't want to make that investment, you will 
have to do a little more work. 

Never use the "s" command by itself; as- 
sign a file name as well. Also, do not save to 
your output file; choose another name for the 
finished document. It's safer if you save your 
document to a different disk entirely. This 
means that when the program asks if you want 
to save a file to the disk in S6,D1, you answer 
with "N." You will have to shuffle disks a bit 
as the program checks the virtual memory files 
for data and returns to the save disk with what it 
finds, even if there is nothing there. 

The addition of a second drive is by far the 
smartest choice. As well as making the time you 
spend computing more enjoyable, it will make 
this program even more useful. 
Donald Walker, Chicago, IL 

This is directed to Roy C. Bennett, whose 
Screen Writer II files turn into hash, and to oth- 
er users of that powerful but sometimes temper- 
amental word processor. My earliest and most 
vivid memories of Screen Writer II are of the 
night my wife and I were late to a party at her 
boss's house because, just as we were about to 
leave, 1 had eleven pages of a research article 
turn into hash. I very nearly sent the whole 
thing back to Coarsegold on the spot, but since 
calling Sierra On-Line and taking their advice, I 
haven't lost a single file. 

I hated to admit it, and you will too, Roy, 
but they're right when they say most scrambled 
files are due to user error. True, a really good 
system would be more forgiving of user error,

but if you follow the instructions Sierra On-Line 
gives you, you'll do okay. There are only four 
commands: 

Keep your files small. Screen Writer II can 
use disk space as virtual memory to allow you 
to input a file longer than your Apple's memory 
space, but don't do it. Watch the sectors-left in- 
dicator and start another file when you get more 
than about thirty sectors long. You can easily 
link files for sequential printing with the .af (ap- 
pend file) embedded command. 

Keep your file rationalized. Heavy editing 
puts a load on a linked list system, so enter a z 
from the command line periodically during edit- 
ing. Takes literally five seconds. 

Never save to your output file. All my text 
disks contain a file called "Dummy," which is 
always the output fde and which stays in drive 
2. When I'm ready to save, I use the sfile- 
name,dl command. With a single drive system 
you can do the same thing and put your saved 
file on the same disk as the output file — or say 
no when asked if you want to save to the disk in 
drive 1 and follow the prompts exactly. 

Occasionally, in spite of all precautions, you 
may get the dreaded "Warning! During the at- 
tempt to save, your output file was deleted. 
Save your fde to another disk!" message. Don't 
panic, just repeat the save and answer N when 
asked if you want to save your file to the disk in 
the drive, then follow the prompts. 
Steve Cramer, Athens, GA 

Regarding Roy Bennett's hashing of text files 
when using Screen Writer II (October Open 
Discussion), I have used the program for about 



a year with this same setup on my computer at 
home (Apple n Plus, one disk drive, 16K RAM 
card, and no eighty-column card). At times, I 
had the problem he reported. Files already on a 
disk would be more or less damaged with seg- 
ments from a file I had worked on more recent- 
ly. I could edit these damaged files or print 
them out; it was just that parts of them were 
overlaid with newer material. The overlay 
material would typically be several lines long, 
and there might be several overlays in a file a 
few pages long. 

Recently, I haven't had any trouble as long 
as I've observed the simple rule of not taking 
the text disk out of the drive when Screen Writer 
is in the editor mode. (Of course, I have to have 
my input file there to start with, and I must 
make sure I have enough room remaining on the 
disk for my output file.) I also do not make mul- 
tiple saves (to more than one output file name) 
of a given file that I am working on. The other 
things Mr. Bennett mentioned don't seem to 
make any difference in my setup. I use the sim- 
ple "S" save command; I have worked with 
long (90- to 110-sector) files, and sometimes 
my disks get quite full. 

I do all of my Screen Writer text file 
transfers from disk to disk using Fid. I make 
text backups that way before and after using 
Screen Writer. It's a little more work, but I've 
been rewarded with clean files. 

As an aside, I think Screen Writer II is a 
marvelous piece of software for someone like 
me with a minimal system. More recently, I got 
an Apple lie, two disk drives, and an 
eighty-column card for my office. I bought 



Screen Writer II for this system also. I have on- 
ly compliments for the support Sierra On-Line 
has provided in helping me configure the pro- 
gram for the lie. Twice, in response to my 
phone calls, they've mailed information imme- 
diately. Now I look forward to Screen Writer 
He so I can compare it to WordStar. I think both 
are fine word processors, working under differ- 
ent constraints and in different price ranges.

Sweet Frustration of a Cat Lover 

Being a Mockingboard owner (Sound/Speech 
I) and a soon-to-be modem owner, I found my 
interest piqued by a few of the letters in Octo- 
ber's Open Discussion. 

I think Steve L. Richter hit the nail on the 
head when he said that programming the 
Mockingboard has been "an exercise in frus- 
tration." The sound synthesis, albeit excellent, 
is simply too complex for the average user. 
Maybe Sweet would consider writing a pro- 
gram that uses the Mockingboard in the same 
way Electric Duet uses the Apple speaker and 
is as easy to use. The speech, however, has 
been blissfully easy. Just check the text-to- 
speech algorithm manual. It contains a simple 
program to produce almost any word in the 
English language. The manual states that a 
small portion of the speech section of the board 
is set aside for pitch but is unused because of 
the board's natural voice inflections. Can I ac- 
cess this portion to change the voice's pitch and 
make it "sing?" If so, can anyone tell me how? 

I can sympathize with David V. Luzi, who 
asked about which modem to consider buying.

JANUARY 1984 



I considered three modems before settling on 
the one I'm waiting for now. They were the 
Prometheus Pro-Modem 1200, the Novation 
Apple-Cat II, and the Hayes Micromodem He. 
The Pro-Modem has everything: a timeclock, 
300/1200 baud, a mailing list, and specialized 
buffers. Well, I don't really need all of that 
stuff. Ditto for the Hayes modem. I would be 
paying a lot for extra features I'd probably 
never use. I decided on the Apple-Cat II mainly 
because of its wide variety of down-to-earth 
features like phone list, autodial, its many 
memory functions, the ability to print out data 
as it comes in, and the unattended answer 
mode— all for a very low price. Also, the Cat is 
the only modem I know of that can be expand- 
ed into an answering machine and a lawn 
gardener, just to name a couple of applications. 
It may or may not be able to switch over to 
another line, as described by Lewis S. Leclerc, 
Jr. , but you could certainly leave a message for 
incoming callers with the other number and 
give them the option to leave their names and 
numbers for return calls. May I suggest you 
check with Novation or Hayes; with some of 
the modems I've seen, almost anything is 
possible! 

There are a few things I'd like to know about 
the Apple-Cat II that aren't made too clear in 
the documentation. The manual states that you 
can control your computer from any remote 
Touch-Tone phone and tell it to turn on the 
sprinklers, dim the lights, turn on the VCR, 
and record the Three Stooges Filmfest— stuff 
like that. What hardware or software does this 
require? In an advertisement I read a while 



ago, it was stated that Novation was consider- 
ing using a Votrax speech chip in its auto- 
answer mode so that you could have it say 
anything you wanted and then record the 
response on tape. Well, I have the Votrax chip 
in the form of Mockingboard. Does anyone out 
there know a way to wire the two together to 
create a complex answering machine with a 
computer voice? 
Bear Braumoeller, Orinda, CA 

Effectual Sounds 

To use the Mockingboard Sound/Speech I with 
the sounds from the demo disk in a Basic pro- 
gram, one needs to follow several steps. The 
routines on the demo disk that the user will need 
are the Primary Routines file, the Table Access 
Routine file, and the Psgtable.obj file. The user 
must bload all three of these files into memory 
with his or her own Basic file. The way the 
Mockingboard works is that the Psgtable.obj 
file contains the sound data, which in turn is 
read and stored in the Mockingboard by the 
Table Access Routine file and the Primary 
Routines file. The sound is also executed after 
the reading and storing. The advantage is that 
the sound execution requires a fraction of com- 
puting time (or, in a higher sense, microproces- 
sor time), yet the sound can continue as the Ba- 
sic program goes on to do other things. It's like 
getting somebody else to do your homework for 
you so you can do better things. The only tricky 
parts are poking in the sound table addresses 
and calling the sound subroutine. An example 
follows that outputs a gunshot with the 
Sound/Speech I board: Bload Primary 



Routines, Table Access Routine, and 
Psgtable.obj. 

CALL -28672 
CALL -28637 
POKE 8,0 
POKE 9,137 
CALL -32748 

This routine can be used in any Basic program 
and, of course, the files only need to be bloaded 
once at the start of the program no matter how 
many sounds are used. The first two calls do 
some setup work with the routines that needn't 
confuse or interest anyone except assembly lan- 
guage programmers who want to know more. 
The two pokes poke the addresses of the gun- 
shot sound data into the data table. The last call 
finally executes the sound. Each sound in the 
table is sixteen bytes long, and the sound table 
starts at 35072 decimal or $8900 hex. It is easy 
to see that the gunshot takes bytes 0—15 on the 
table and that the second sound, the train, uses 
bytes 16 - 3 1 . In simple English, this means that 
a new sound starts every sixteen bytes. 

Here is a list containing some of the sounds 
on the sound demo program: 

GUNSHOT-00 
TRAIN- 16 
HELICOPTER -32 
EXPLOSION -48 
OCEAN -64 
SWISH -80 
PUMP-96 
CLOCK- 112 
GENERATOR- 128

grams, follow the procedure for the gunshot, 
but poke the number listed after each sound into 
memory location 8. Some sounds on the demo 
are combinations of certain sounds, such as the 
machine gun, which is simply a string of gun- 
shots in succession. With this method, you can 
put any sound on the demonstration table into 
your own program. These methods are for the 
Sound/Speech I board in slot 4. The principles 
are the same for the other Mockingboards, but 
some of the locations and tables are at different 
locations. The Mockingboard is a great periph- 
eral device, and I highly recommend the pur- 
chase of a Sound/Speech I board. 
Chris Wheaton, Los Altos Hills, CA 

Direct Address 

Perhaps I can help some readers who use the 
Hayes Smartmodem. The D.C. Hayes Smart- 
modem doesn't accept commands like most mo- 
dems. It must be addressed directly by the 
RS-232 serial port. There is a way to have the 
ASCII Express: The Professional program auto- 
matically dial a phone number until a connec- 
tion is made, using its powerful macro feature. 

How to use macros to auto dial a phone 
number with the Smartmodem 1200 isn't in the 
program's manual from Southwestern Data 
Systems. Of course. Southwestern Data 
Systems cannot be expected to be experts on all 
the modems used with the program. D.C. 
Hayes wasn't aware of how auto dialing could 
be done, either. The following is a sample 
macro that will auto dial a number until a car- 
rier tone is detected. 

When you boot up ASCII Pro, you will im- 
mediately be in the terminal mode. This is 
because the Smartmodem is addressable only by 
the RS-232 serial port, and the terminal mode is 
how you talk to the Smartmodem. The D (dial) 
command available in the ASCII Pro doesn't 
work with the Smartmodem because you are 
always in the terminal mode. 

From the terminal mode, press control-Q to 
enter the command mode; press U to update 
macros; press D to display macros; press O to 
select macro ^; and type ?AT D T 534-1547' 
RT"ATH ' LO. 

It would be a good idea to use all capital let- 
ters. In fact, the Smartmodem requires that the 
AT be in caps. Macro number 9 should be left 
blank or be your log-on procedure. You can re- 
peat the macro above for each phone number to 
which you want to have access. 

Let me explain what the above macros 
mean: 

?— this slows down the macro. It seems that 
the Smartmodem doesn't work right after the 
first attempt if the macro isn't slowed down. 

AT— this is the command that tells the 
Smartmodem to get ready to accept a command. 

D— this is the command that tells the Smart- 
modem to dial a number. 

T— this is the command that tells the Smart- 
modem to use touch-tone dialing. 

534-1547— this is a sample phone number. 
You can have as many digits as you like, and 
dashes are ignored by the Smartmodem. 

'—this character sends a carriage return to 
the Smartmodem. A carriage return is some- 
times necessary to send a command to the 
Smartmodem. One exception to this is the com- 



mand /A, which doesn't need a carriage return. 

(Space) — this character begins a conditional 
clause. 

Before we go on, let me point out that the 
Smartmodem outputs certain messages. Two of 
the messages are of interest to us for use with 
this conditional macro. If the Smartmodem gets 
a carrier signal, it responds with "Connect." If 
the Smartmodem gets a busy signal, it responds 
with "No Carrier." The last character of these 
messages is what the conditional macro looks 
for— the T or the R. 

RT9 — these are also part of the conditional 
clause. The R is the character, if encountered 
last, that will continue on with the rest of the 
macro. In this example, the rest of the macro is 
to link back to the macro or to restart. The T is 
the character, if encountered, that transfers con- 
trol to macro number 9, which right now is 
nothing. In other words, if you are connected, 
the macro halts. 

(Space)LO— the space is the character indi- 
cating the beginning of a command sequence. 
The L is the link command. The O is the macro 
being linked to. 

Bulletin boards are getting harder and hard- 
er to reach. It is important for a modem to be 
able to redial a number until a carrier tone is 
detected. Without the powerful macros of 
ASCII Pro, a user has to retype the dial se- 
quence or the A/ sequence repeatedly until a 
connection is made. It is a shame D.C. Hayes 
didn't give the Smartmodem the smarts to auto 
dial a number until it connects. But they aren't 
alone. Few, if any, modems have this capability 
within their firmware. 
Nick Anis, Jr., Fullerton, CA 

Reader to Reader 

To T.A. Reif (August Open Discussion): You 
can get your Epson FX-80 (and Gemini) to 
underline letters and words by typing escape-1 
to turn it on and escape-0 to turn it off. (For 
some reason, the Gemini wants escape-® [a 
control-®] instead of the 0.) I'm sure this will 
work with the MX-80 as well. You can do this 
with Apple Writer in the control-V mode or, 
more easily, with a glossary file into which 
you've previously inserted all the control char- 
acters you need. By the way, you can't enter the 
control-® with the control-G glossary define 
sequence. You must clear memory, load your 
glossary file as a regular text file, insert your 
characters, then save it normally. When you 
then load it as a glossary file (control-Q5 file 
name), all your commands will be there. 

To Evans Harrell (August Open Discus- 
sion): The problem you're having with chang- 
ing type fonts is similar to the one I had some 
time ago. This may work for you. In order to 
change fonts with my Centronics, the command 
(in my case, an escape control-Q or other simi- 
lar command) must appear as the first character 
after a carriage return. If you have a left margin 
set that is anything other than .ImO (with the 
paragraph margin also set to .pmO), the com- 
mand is not the first character on the line. The 
spaces you asked Apple Writer to insert at the 
beginning of each line are there before your 
command. To fix, issue an . ImO as the first four 
characters on a line, go to the next line, and 
issue your controI-I80N command. This pre- 



JANUARY 1984 



eludes mixing type fonts on the same line. How- 
ever, you can still use single-width, dou- 
ble-strike print intermixed on the same line. Ap- 
ple Writer's, internal underline command works 
with no printer I've seen. Perhaps Paul Lutus 
can shed some light on this. 

To Leanna M. Cole (August Open Discus- 
sion): My Centronics printer needs a con- 
trol-ISON (or 132N, whatever the case may be) 
command; otherwise all its output will be forty- 
column. This is true for word processing, pro- 
gram listings, and printing from inside a Basic 
program. That infamous control-I is not just to 
turn off the screen for us Centronics users. To 
insert control characters with Apple Writer II, 
merely hit control-V, then your characters, 
holding control where necessary, then hit con- 
trol-V again to terminate. 

I would like some way of dumping graphics 
on my Centronics. The machine came with a 
boffo demo program including two hi-res 
screen dumps, but I'll be darned if I can find out 
how to take graphics I've drawn and dump 
them. Zoom Grafix doesn't cope with Cen- 
tronics 739 printers, and the local Centronics 
office doesn't have a clue. Don't tell me it can't 
be done, for I can send you a copy of the printer 
demo done in my presence on the machine I 
now own. 

David W. Sigetich, Markham, Ontario, Canada 

Reader Paul CuUen's problem (October 
Open Discussion) might be solved by the ma- 
chine language graphics dump routine con- 
tained on the demonstration disk that comes 
with the Apple Dot-Matrix Printer. The disk 
and program are not locked. I haven't tried that 
routine on an NEC printer (I have the Apple 
printer), but the two machines are extremely 
similar and the Apple program may work. 

I can sympathize with Roy Bennett (October 
Open Discussion). I have recently been having 
the same problem with file scrambling in my 
Screen Writer II program. I think I may have 
identified the source of the problem. I had no 
troubles even with extremely full disks, prior to 
that time I began using Diversi-DOS, a modified 
DOS that features very fast program and file 
loading. I tracked a problem I was having with 
Home Accountant back to Diversi-DOS, and I 
am pretty sure that it is at the root of my prob- 
lems with Screen Writer II as well. My experi- 
ence in this regard should be a warning to all 
Apple owners: Use any nonstandard DOS with 
great caution, especially with locked commer- 
cial programs. The file-handling techniques may 
not be compatible and you may encounter file 
damage that will take you weeks to recover 
from. 

Reader Alan Smolen's problem (October 
Open Discussion) is probably due to the printer 
control card. The control card is still expecting 
a maximum line length of eighty characters 
even though the control-O command to the 
printer has set it to handle a 1 32-character line. 
Adding control-I 132N to the setup string 
should take care of the problem if he has an Ap- 
ple printer card, though some other cards may 
require a different sequence. 

Louis Leclerc's proposal (October Open 
Discussion) seems unnecessarily complicated. I 
can understand why he would want to divert af-

To John Flikeid: The NEC 8023A manual was 
first written in Japanese and then translated into 
English. (That's worse than translating Basic 
into machine language.) All of the printer com- 
mands to change fonts start with an "ESC," 
followed by the individual command to change 
that font. A one-line program illustrates how to 
change from pica to elite font: 

1 0 PR# 1 ; PRINT CHR$ (27); CHR$ (69): 
PR# 0 

In this case (69) sets the elite font mode. Other 
values are as follows; condensed = (81); pica 
= 78; proportional = (80); enhanced or bold = 
(33); clear enhance = (34); underline = (88); 
clear underline = (89); double width or enlarge 
= (14); clear double width = (15); '/^-inch line 
spacing = (65); '/g-inch line spacing = (66); 
normal ASCII characters = (36); Greek = 
(38); and graphic = (35). Whew! Note that 
after you select enlarge, enhance, or underline, 
you have to turn off or clear that mode to go 
back to the mode you were in before you in- 
voked it. 

Your Dip switches on the NEC should be set 
as follows: SW 1 — 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8 should be 
"open"; SW 2 — 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 should be 
"open." You'll notice these switches under the 
front panel at the right-hand side. Zoom Graph- 
ics, Image Printer II, or the Printographer will 
all dump graphics to the printer, but you still 
have to bload the picture. All these programs 
show you how to do this easily. 
Ron Moos, Birmingham, AL 

To John Flikeid: The folks at NEC have pre- 
pared a special manual to help Apple owners 
use their printer, which incidentally is virtually 
identical to the Apple Dot Matrix Printer and to 
a C. Itoh model; both are versions of a TEC 
(Tokyo Electric Company) printer. All I had to 
do was call the Elk Grove, Illinois, office and 
ask for the manual. They have been very helpful 
in correcting a few interfacing problems that 
should no longer exist if you use an intelligent 
interface card. 

One thing to note about the manual is that 
the Dip switch settings might be better set an- 
other way. I have to use my printer on both an 
Apple II Plus and an IBM PC. The switch set- 
tings I use are good for both: SW 1—2,6, and 
7 closed; SW 2 — 2, 6, and 7 closed. All I do to 
print graphics images is put them on the hi-res 
screen and use my Grappler's normal graphics 
screen dump command. That should solve John 
Flikeid's problem, but I can't help Paul Cullen, 
who drives his printer with an Epson APL 
board. 

There is an excellent article in Creative 
Computing magazine's September 1983 issue 
that describes ways of using the NEC 8023A 



from Basic. This article by Susan Glinert-Cole 
is applicable to Apple owners.

to print my files with my Epson FX-80 I came 
upon the same problem as Sean Roberts re- 
ported in the October Open Discussion. So I 
looked in my trusty operator's manual and 
found out that I needed to switch DIP pin 2-4 to 
"on," which gives an automatic line feed. Now 
I can print all of my files with no problem. 
Mike Laus, Birmingham, AL 

If PFS:File is always printing on the same line, 
then that is correctable in the print options 
menu. Exact instructions are in the manual. If 
the problem is that the tail end of a line is print- 
ing on its beginning, then I have two solutions. 
The problem is that the printer is returning the 
carriage before PFS tells it to; therefore PFS 
doesn't advance the line. Solution one: Ab- 
breviate—you have too much information on 
that line. Solution two: Change the print com- 
mand to T. This will allow PFS to print the in- 
formation as text. 

Michael J. Marsh, Santa Ynez, CA 

Perhaps I can help Sean Roberts and Alan Smo- 
len (October Open Discussion) with their 
PFS.File problems. 

First, the PFS programs assume that your 
printer automatically sends a line feed after each 
carriage return. If you are getting overprinting, 
try using the "L" option (instead of the default 
"P") when asked for an output device in the 
PFS programs. I have had no problems at all 
with an Epson MX-80 printer with Graftrax-I- 
and Grappler-I- interface, or with an Apple Si- 
lentype printer. 

Second, to use printer control codes with 
PFS.File (or PFS:Report), you must set up your 
printer before booting the PFS disk. The 
PFS.Report manual includes a program to do 
this. With particular reference to Alan Smolen's 
problem, control-O turns on compressed print 
with the Epson but does not reset the default 
eighty-character right margin, which in my case 
is controlled by the Grappler interface card. To 
remedy this, I use control-I 132N to set the mar- 
gin at 132 characters. This control code may 
differ for other printer/interface combinations. 

I hope this will help you.

Twin Trouble 

I have a partial answer to the question asked by 
Sean Roberts (October Open Discussion). He 
tried to use the print function on PFS.File; his 
printer would not advance a line and all the in- 
formation was printed on the same line, with 
each overlapping. When you load PFS: File and 



JANUARY 1984 



the menu appears, type control-L. The message 
"set for printer without auto-linefeed" will ap- 
pear. Unfortunately, when I use this my infor- 
mation comes out garbled. The letters are all 
changed. I have a Gemini lOX printer and 
would appreciate any help I could get to solve 
this problem.

A Reconnection 

I recently made one of the wisest purchases of 
my life, an Apple lie. With my purchase I was 
surprised to find a six-month trial subscription 
to Softalk. It has been one of the most beneficial 
parts of my entire investment. I find myself 
reading it thoroughly from cover to cover, and 
in the two months that I have been receiving it I 
have benefited immensely. 

With the Amdek Color-I Plus monitor and 
Apple lie eighty-column text card combination, 
I found Jerry Van Cleeffs suggestions (October 
Open Discussion) about making text more legi- 
ble in the eighty-column mode very useful. 
Since I use this mode quite often when writing 
programs, I have found his short program to be 
very helpful. As a beginner, I was alarmed 
when I included his program lines in one of my 
programs and then discovered that I could not 
use any DOS commands without getting a syn- 
tax error. After a little work, and some help 
from a patient salesperson at my Apple store, I 
figured out the problem: As written, his lines 
were disconnecting DOS! To correct this prob- 
lem, I changed the program as follows: 

10 D$ = CHR$(13) + CHR$(4):REM 

CARRIAGE RETURN AND CONTROL-D 

20 PRINT D$;"PR#3":REM ACTIVATE THE 
80-COLUMN CARD 

30 PRINT CHR$(15):REM TURN ON 
INVERSE 

40 PRINT CHR$(12):REM CLEAR SCREEN 
TO WHITE 

The effect on the screen is the same, but with 
the change in line 10 you will not deacti- 
vate DOS.

Garden- Variety Pokes 

May I bring readers' attention to the fact that 
Matt Offenbacher's peeks and pokes can be 
found in almost any chart or computer book, or 
even your normal everyday Peeks & Pokes 
Chart from Beagle Bros. Moral for Matt: Don't 
go poking -49384,0 around where you 
shouldn't peek - 16336 unless you want some- 
one calling — 155 when you're not waiting. 
Bo Rutledge, Dallas, TX 

In the October Open Discussion, Matt Offen- 
bacher wrote about poke 214,255, which will 
rerun the program in memory no matter what 
you type. This causes you to have to reboot a 
disk to get rid of it, and that isn't always handy. 
Is there a poke that cancels this one? 
Stephen Pace, Midland, TX

Looking for a Way 

I had an Apple n Plus that I was using quite ex- 
tensively with Apple Writer II and VisiCalc. I 
was considering buying an eighty-column card 
to augment these programs. After checking and 
comparing the various costs and features, I 
decided instead to sell my Apple II Plus and buy 
an Apple lie with an extended eighty-col- 
umn card. 

Now I find out that I can't use the eighty- 
column feature with either of these programs. If 
the eighty-column card is activated, I get forty 
letters separated by forty spaces. I understand 
that the Videx eighty-column preboot won't 
work either, as it was designed for the Videx 
eighty-column cards. There should be some 
way to access this card with these two pro- 
grams. Can someone help me with this?

Knowing the Score 

I am writing to find out if anyone knows of a 
program that will enable me to print out music 
scores. That is, a program with which I can ac- 
tually write music (the clef, the bars, and the 
notes) to the screen and then print it. 
Randal J. Givens, Brussels, Belgium 

Dissertation Dilemma 

While working on my dissertation I found that 
a printout from a dot-matrix printer would be 
acceptable. However, the placement of page 
numbers and footnotes was a problem using 
Apple Writer II with a NEC 8023-A printer and 
Grappler Plus interface card. My departmental 
adviser preferred the use of Campbell's Form 
& Style, with the placement of footnotes at the 
bottom of each page of text, a 1.5-inch line 
separating the text from the footnotes, and one 
line of space between each footnote. The foot- 
note problem was solved by the use of the foot- 
note brackets enclosing a 1.5-inch line of 
dashes followed by the first footnote, then a 
return enclosed in the same symbols, followed 



JANUARY 1984 



by the next footnote and another return enclos- 
ed within the brackets, and so forth. If the foot- 
note was longer than the length of the normal 
text line (sixty spaces), it was necessary to 
break the footnote into sixty-space segments to 
avoid printing into the margins; each segment 
was enclosed within the usual brackets. The 
text was first printed to the screen using the 
print destination "0" setting to determine 
where to insert the 1.5-inch line segments and 
the returns between footnotes that occurred on 
the same page. 

If another reader has been able to determine 
how to place page numbers one inch in from 
both the upper right-hand comer and right mar- 
gins, I'd appreciate knowing how this is done. 
Also, the printing of superscript numbers with 
the above-described printer/interface combina- 
tion was something of a problem for me.

To Be Compatible 

I am interested in adapting an IBM PC-type disk 
drive (such as a Tandon TM 100-1) to work on 
an Apple He computer. What I want to do is use 
the same IBM-compatible disk drives on both 
my Apple system at home and on my IBM PC at 
work. I am not necessarily interested in using 
all of the storage capacity of the IBM-PC -type 
disk drives, just in achieving Apple U compati- 
bility. If anyone knows how this can be 
achieved or where I can buy a board that will 
allow me to adapt a Tandon TM 100 drive to an 
Apple n, please write and let the world know!

by Christopher Cerf 

It takes most ordinary mortals less than five minutes of conversation 
with Dr. Ann Piestrup, chairman and founder of The Learning Com- 
pany, to realize two ftmdamental truths about her: They'll believe vir- 
tually anything this woman says, and, if she wants to lead them some- 
where, they'll probably follow. 

When she's talking about the use of microcomputers to provide learn- 
ing environments for children— a subject she cares about with missionary 
zeal— it becomes instantiy clear how her combination of charm, energy, 
inventiveness, and her desire to do something truly important have, in 
just a few short years, made her and her Menlo Park, California, firm an 
irresistible force in the software industry. 

' 'The theme of our product is that it allows children the power to dis- 
cover things for themselves," she enthuses. "We want to give them a 
chance to learn in an exploratory way." Those familiar with such TLC 
products as Rocky 's Boots and Gertrude 's Puzzles will know what she 
means by "exploratory." These innovative programs permit kids (and 
adults, too) to roam around a "world" of rooms presented graphically 
on the computer screen, fmding simulated objects that can be manipu- 
lated, moved, and combined in fascinating ways. 

The Exploring Spirit. Indeed, as Ann Piestrup, who converted to 
Catholicism as a fifteen-year-old and subsequently spent several years as 
a nun in Washington State, reminisces about her almost accidental entry 
into the computer world, it seems obvious that her life has been every bit 
as "exploratory" as the software her company produces. 

"The day I decided that the computer business was for me, I'd barely 
heard of microcomputers," she confesses. "After leaving the Sisters of 



Saint Joseph, I'd worked a long time as a teacher, often in poverty areas, 
and I'd earned a doctorate in educational psychology from the University 
of California at Berkeley. Through it all, I'd collected a closetful of edu- 
cational materials. Many of them were cleverly designed, but somehow 
they didn't seem to inspire kids to learn. I'm afraid I was getting a bit dis- 
couraged. 

"One night, a computer-programmer friend, George Rothbart, vis- 
ited me and my husband, Mel, for dinner and told us about micros. Until 
then, I'd thought of computers as huge machines used primarily for sta- 
tistics. I'd had no idea that they could produce pictures— in color no 
less!— and music, or that they could be made compact and relatively in- 
expensive, or that people could program them to be simple enough for 
young children to use. But as George talked, I became convinced that 
computers could really make a difference in the way kids learn." 

From that point on, there was no stopping her. She immediately be- 
gan preparing a grant application for funds to create an educational com- 
puter game in which "preschool children could learn such concepts as 
height and depth and left and right without ever being wrong. I decided 
on a preschool program because I had a preschooler." A few weeks 
later, as 1979 was drawing to a close, Piestrup submitted her finished 
proposal to Carolyn Stauffer at the Apple Education Foundation, which 
was still so new that it didn't yet own one of its namesake's computers. 
Did the foundation's lack of resources faze Ann Piestrup. "Hardly!" she 
laughs. "They might not have owned an Apple, but at the time we made 
our proposal, I'd barely even seen one!" 

Piestrup 's solution to her lack of computer literacy was a quick visit

to ComputerLand of Los Altos, where she instantly befriended the 
store's owner, Sarkis Kasougian, and his associate, Steve Negretti. 
Within minutes, the pair had given Piestrup her first glimpse of Apple 
graphics ("Now I knew I was onto something!") and had become true 
believers in her cause. 

Other converts were soon to follow. The board of the Apple Educa- 
tion Foundation— which consisted of such computer luminaries as educa- 
tor Arthur Luehrmann of the Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley and 
businessman Tom Whitney— approved the proposal and awarded 
Piestrup an Apple and $1,0(X). Luehrmann also introduced her to one of 
his colleagues, Joyce Hakansson, herself one of the true pioneers of chil- 
dren's software. Hakansson promptly proceeded to get Piestrup together 
with Barbara Jasinski, who combined computer science experience with 
a public relations post at the firm of Regis McKenna (which just hap- 
pened to handle the Apple account). Jasinski and Piestrup hit it off imme- 
diately and, at a table at the Stanford Coffee Shop ("Our first office!" 
remembers Piestrup), the two began mapping out the design for their 
first Apple program. Juggles ' Rainbow. 

"The key to our design was a storyboarding technique Barbara and I 
worked out," Piestrup explains, holding up a chart covered with dozens 
of brightly colored boxes. "Because we plotted everything so carefully 
in advance, we were able to create a game that was not only extremely 
playful, but also structured, guided, and sequenced." 

As the work on Juggles' Rainbow progressed, Piestrup's Pied 
Piper— or, more accurately, "Pied Piestrup"— routine continued 
unabated. She talked Stanford University into allowing her to use its ex- 
perimental Bing Nursery School, where her daughter Sarah was a stu- 
dent, as a research facility. As a result, she found herself with twenty- 
two kids on whom to try out her ideas. She also succeeded in persuading 
an old friend. Dr. Alice Chiang, to program Juggles' Rainbow. "Alice 
was a consulting programmer for IBM," Piestrup explains, "but, 
luckily, they allowed her to work with us on the side. Alice also provided 
us with her back room, which immediately replaced the Stanford Coffee 
Shop as our official office." 

And what kind of programmer was Alice Chiang? "Incredible!" says 
Ann Piestrup. "In fact, I had to learn to withhold concepts from her until 



(8 keypresses) 



they were fully developed, because if I didn't, she'd have my half-baked 
ideas up and running on the Apple before I even realized she'd begun 
working on them!" 

Meeting a Visifriend. At about the same time, Piestrup and Barbara 
Jasinski met Dan Fylstra, founder of Personal Software (now VisiCorp). 
Fylstra gave them a copy of a new program called VisiCalc, which, he 
suggested modesdy, might help them plan the business side of their new 
venture. Of course, it's one thing to own VisiCalc and another to know 
how to use it to work out a detailed financial plan. So another acquaint- 
ance, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs, was soon persuaded to construct a 
spreadsheet model for the development and marketing of Juggles ' Rain- 
bow. Thus armed, Piestrup and Jasinski officially founded a new com- 
pany, which they decided to call Advanced Learning Technology. 

But one project — and no income— a company does not make. So, hav- 
ing heard that the Department of Education was soliciting proposals 
for computer-assisted instruction projects, Ann Piestrup decided to 
apply. "I'd never written a government grant proposal before," she 
says, "but I read the directions. And, with the help of a word processing 
specialist I hired using the weekend grocery money, I wrote up a request 
for funds to create playful 'logic and geometry programs for second- and 
third-graders.' " But, for once, luck was not with her. The application 
was accepted but tabled, and Advanced Learning Technology was forced 
into a state of suspended animation. 

Ann Piestrup was undaunted. "My father told me that Babe Ruth had 
not only the highest batting average but one of the highest strikeout aver- 
ages," she explains. "He just got up to bat more often than anyone 
else." She submitted a new proposal, and this time she was successful: 
She acquired $130,000, enough to fund the conpany's program develop- 
ment work through 1981. 

Since her grant committed her to teach mathematical concepts, and 
because she desperately needed another hand (Barbara Jasinski had by 
this time involved herself in another educational software venture), 
Piestrup now recruited a Stanford-trained expert in mathematics educa- 
tion. Dr. Teri Hoch Perl. Perl, who, in addition to her research and 
design responsibilities, is currently directing TLC's efforts to convert its 
Apple products to run on other machines, brought with her a budding en-

thusiasm for computers. Even more important, she knew— to use Pie- 
strup's phrase— "the meaning of the word product. And, above all, she 
understood that our program had to be fun, as well as educational." 

Adventures in Learning. Just as Teri Perl was becoming Advanced 
Learning Technology's second full-time employee, an event occurred, a 
few miles south in Sunnyvale, that was to have enormous significance in 
the history of the young firm: Warren Robinett, the creator of Atari's 
Adventure game, strolled into the offices of Dan Fylstra's Personal Soft- 
ware and presented the plan for an adventure game based on a graphics 
utility program he'd developed for the Apple. 

Personal Software, which by this time was primarily in the business 
of marketing "productivity" software, had no immediate use for such a 
game. But the company was greatly impressed by Warren Robinett's 
work and, perhaps, by his reputation. (Robinett had achieved notoriety 
in the programming community when, after being refused an on-screen 
credit for his work on Adventure, he succeeded in concealing his initials 
in one of the game's secret rooms.) And so it was that one of Fylstra's 
associates, Mitch Kapor, called Ann Piestrup and suggested that Robin- 
ett was someone she should meet. "Yes," Piestrup smiles, "it was the 
same Mitch Kapor who later achieved fame— and fortune— as the father 
of Lotus Software. Well, he may not have been the father of our com- 
pany, but he was certainly its godfather." 

Piestrup is hardly exaggerating, because Warren Robinett's graphics 
editor turned out to contain some of the most exciting educational soft- 
ware ideas that she— or anyone else— had ever encountered (one Apple 
executive later pronounced it "the VisiCalc of education"). It allows the 
programmer to trace out a world of up to sixty-four rooms, each of 
which can be connected to any of the others through doorways left in the 
room walls. Objects can then be drawn and animated with a 
joystick— objects that can easily be assigned a starting location, 
characteristic movement, and color with just a few taps on the keyboard. 
The result: Programs in which the user can move his or her cursor from 
room to room, picking up, dropping, connecting, and disconnecting ob- 
jects by merely pressing the fire button or the space bar. 

Foundation and Empire. Robinett's utility was just the tool Ad- 
vanced Learning Technology needed to create the kind of playful logic 
games the fledgling company had promised in its National Science Foun- 
dation grant application. And Warren Robinett eagerly accepted Ann 
Piestrup's invitation to join ALT as a full-time software engineer. "I'm 



essentially a game designer at heart," he explained at the time. "My pri- 
mary goal is to make fun programs. But vida) games don't have any in- 
trinsic worth. The kind of games I'm interested in are problem-solving 
games that have some broad educational value." 

Over the ensuing months, Robinett, Piestrup, and Perl created a 
series of games to fulfill their NSF obligation— games such as Logic Ar- 
cade, in which kids were asked to fill rooms in the game with the proper 
combinations of different-colored squares, triangles, and circles; and 
Logic Gate Adventure, which, in its early versions, encouraged players 
to design simulated computer circuits with the goal of preventing a flock 
of hungry ducks from eating the cursor. 

Child-testing of Logic Gate Adventure had not progressed very far 
before the ALT group realized they had produced something special. 
"The game contained material that's usually not presented until the sec- 
ond year of college," Ann Piestrup says. "But we began to see that kids 
seven years old and younger had little or no trouble understanding it." 

As a result of such success, Piestrup was suddenly faced with a diffi- 
cult decision: Should she accept the venture capital that Tom Whitney, 
her old friend from the Apple Education Foundation— now with Melchor 
Venture Management— insisted on thrusting at her? She would need the 
money if she wished to modify Logic Gate Adventure and her company's 
other offerings into products that could reach a broad audience of home 
consumers. "But," she explains, "my interest was not so much business 
as education, and I was nervous about having investors to be accountable 
to. If we became a real company, I wondered, would we still have the 
freedom to play in research?" Nonetheless, she made the plunge, and in 
January 1982 Advanced Learning Technology accepted $300,000 as 
capital, moved into new offices in Portola Valley, and changed its name 
to The Learning Company— TLC for short. 

Warren Robinett shared Piestrup's anxiety about "losing control of 
the direction of the company." On the other hand, his assessment of the 
new setup was not entirely negative ("We might get rich," he observed) 
and he agreed to continue his work on Logic Gate Adventure. Gradually

ing Company as a leading producer of educational computer programs. 

Serendipitous Saga. If by now you've gotten the impression that 
serendipity has played more than a casual role in the saga of The Learn- 
ing Company, that impression will be greatly strengthened by the story of 
Leslie and Cori Grimm and how they came to play an integral part in the 
firm's success. Leslie Grimm, a teacher at the Monta Loma School in 
Palo Alto, was chatting with a fellow faculty member, one day in early 
1981, about the Apple computer she had recently bought. She was par- 
ticularly excited about a story program she had begun creating with the 
aid of her ten-year-old daughter, Cori, who, it seemed, had developed 
quite a facility for drawing computer pictures using Color Sketch, an art 
program provided free on the Apple-DOS Master Disk. A third teacher 
at the school happened by and, overhearing Grimm's conversation, took 
the liberty of interrupting. "Pardon me for eavesdropping," said the 
teacher, "but what you're saying is terribly exciting. You should call my 
friend Ann Piestrup right away!" 

As a result, Grimm set up an appointment with Piestrup to look at 
fragments of programs that eventually turned into such Learning Com- 
pany standbys as Bumble Plot, Moptown, and Magic Spells. Piestrup was 
delighted, not only with Leslie Grimm's ability to combine play and 
learning in her programs, but with the charm and professionalism of 
Cori's graphics, which have since earned the youngster a feature article 
in the Children's Television Workshop's 3-2-1 Contact magazine and a 
role in creating many of TLC's new programs. 

"Cori's getting famous," says her mother proudly. "But she's only 
one of the many kids who've been contributing to our projects. My older 
daughter, Cindy, has done crash tests on many of our games, relentlessly 
searching for bugs. Then there's Shaun Gordon, a high school student who 
lives near my house, who got a part-time job with us doing odd program- 
ming assignments and turned out to be one of the most creative game de- 
signers we've ever found. And Ann's nephew, Mike McCormick, has 
done some nice work, too, using Warren's utility." 

Leslie Grimm herself has done "some nice work" with Warren's 
utility— to say the least. In fact, her best-known game, Gertrude 's Se- 
crets, in which a "go-getter goose" named Gertrude presents kids with 
colored puzzle pieces that can be manipulated on the screen, was 



developed with the graphics editor and has been a bestseller for months. 
Grimm is also responsible for the highly acclaimed How To Move 
tutorials that introduce kids to many of TLC's most popular offerings. 

When Warren Robinett recently left his full-time position with the 
company to write a book and pursue his dream of creating an adventure 
game in which players could "build machines to combat monsters," the 
chief designer's mantle fell to Leslie Grimm. To fill Robinett's shoes on 
the technical side, veteran programmer Pete Rowe joined The Learning 
Company as manager of research and development. 

"It seems like everywhere I've been since 1979— meetings, computer 
fairs, whatever— I've run into Ann Piestrup or Teri Perl," explains 
Rowe, who had spent the last few years running his own consulting and 
programming business. Computer Aided Instruction. "Finally, the urge 
to come here and be part of a unique creative team like this became 
irresistible. 

"What I like most about TLC is the energy of the people. They have 
an incredible amount of team spirit. No one's building empires here; 
everybody's concerned." And, as if to prove his point, he cuts short his 
remarks and dashes off to the reception desk, where he's promised to fill 
in for an employee facing an emergency trip to the dentist. In his 
absence, Leslie Grimm is free to talk about the enormous impact Pete 
Rowe has had on her work. 

"I suffered a ruptured disk recently," she explains, referring to a 
spinal injury, not the destruction of one of her stored programs. "Until 
an operation finally straightened me out, I was forced to spend a lot of 
time lying down. I was sure my back problems were going to keep me 
from finishing Reader Rabbit, a kids' word game I've been developing. 
But Pete was able to make me a detachable keyboard for my Apple that 
let me program while I was lying flat on my back. In addition, he's 
shown me all kinds of programming tricks. In fact, whenever I come up 
with a problem I think is unsolvable, I just bring it to Pete. He usually 
just shrugs and says something like, "Oh, this is trivial," and in a few 
moments, he has^ me back in business." 

Learning Company Components. As essential as Pete Rowe has be- 
come to The Learning Company, the firm made an even more significant 
addition early in 1983 when Marcia Klein, vice president of the con- 



Ann Piestrup and her daughter Sarah play the soon-to-be-released Learning Company program Pot 'o Gold

sumer clients group at Regis McKenna, left that post to become president 
of TLC. Klein, who took over responsibility for TLC's public relations 
soon after meeting Ann Piestrup in 1981 , also was in charge of the Apple 
account. "The Lisa was introduced on January 19, and I was deeply in- 
volved in the launch right up to the last minute," says Klein. "I guess 
it's a measure of my excitement about TLC that I started here the very 
next day, January 20!" 

"Marcia brings us the one essential thing we've always lacked," says 
chairman Ann Piestrup, "a deep knowledge of the marketing side of the 
business." And, with a valuable assist from Shivonne Byrne, a Regis 
McKenna colleague who joined her in making the switch to TLC, Klein 
also seems to have brought some order to the company's rapid, but hap- 
hazard, growth. Among her accomplishments thus far: orchestrating a 
redesign of TLC's packaging; engineering a smooth move of the com- 
pany's offices to larger quarters in Menlo Park; negotiating a ground- 
breaking agreement with Simon and Schuster that will expand the com- 
pany's distribution into bookstores; and, most important of all, putting 
the corporation solidly in the black for the first time in its short history. 

Says Frona Kahn, who was hired away from Atari in 1981 to help 
TLC child-test its games and now heads a Marcia Klein-inspired effort to 
market the company's products directly to educational institutions: 
"Before Marcia arrived, we were a bit light on the business side of 
things. Ann, Warren, and Leslie are all geniuses in their way, but let's 
face it, creative people don't like to go to staff meetings. Now our devel- 
opment group wUl have the time to concentrate on what they do best." 
Teri Perl puts it even more directly. "Running a small company is a lot 
of junk," she says. "There will be more freedom in our work now." 

What impelled Marcia Klein to give up her successful— and secure- 
job at Regis McKenna to come to TLC? She had this question hurled at 
her recently, as she and Shivonne Byrne emerged from a frantic, nonstop 
round of meetings with dealers, sales representatives, distributors, and, 
rumor has it, a venture capitalist or two. 

"Why did I do it?" she repeated, shaking her head to achieve the 
maximum effect. "I don't know; tell me again, Shivonne, tell me why I 
did it!" But then she laughed— a laugh that made it clear that Marcia

son, Warren Robinett; front row: Rita Levinson, Teri Perl, Leslie Grimm. 



Klein knows exactly why she chose to join The Learning Company. 
"This place is really magical," she remarks, "very much like Apple was 
at the beginning. But the personal computer industry is maturing fast, 
and only products that are positioned properly are going to be able to 
succeed. That's where I'm confident I can make a difference. What the 
software world needs now is consumer marketing." 

These words inspired one listener to suggest that Burt Bacharach and 
Hal David should collaborate on a new tune based on Marcia Klein's 
philosophy: "What the World Needs Now Is Consumer Marketing!" 
TLC's new president smiles at this suggestion, amused at her own en- 
thusiasm. But one thing seems unmistakable: Impossible as it may seem, 
Marcia Klein is every bit as excited about the future of The Learning 
Company as is Ann Piestrup. And it's hard not to marvel at the potential 
power of these two women, and their talented colleagues, to change- 
profoundly and permanently— the face of American education.

The Nonprogrammer's 
Programming Primer 

The best thing about a record player is that 
you don't have to know a thing about music in 
order to listen to records. You don't even have 
to know anything about music to enjoy music. 

Computers are like that; you don't have to 
know RAM from ROM, bit from byte, or chips 
from DIP in order to enjoy them. Programming 
is the stuff that makes computers go, and for 
most of us it's something that until now has best 
been left to those who are competent at it. As 
long as there's someone else to program com- 
puters, we don't need to know how to program 
in order to enjoy them. Video games are proof 
of this. 

As with music, however, the more you do 
know about how programs are constructed and 
what separates the junk from the good stuff, the 
more you can appreciate a good program. This 
month, we're going to take a look at program- 
ming the Apple, beginning with some hows and 
whys of Basic. 

In case the idea of programming causes 
panic, high blood pressure, and general hyster- 
ia, rest assured that we're not going to learn 
how to program, but rather how to input pro- 
grams into the computer— programs already 
written by someone else. 

Language Barriers. When planning for a 
vacation, it's often advisable to learn a few 
words or phrases in the native language of the 
country you're going to visit. Consider the 
plight of Klondike Putz of Middletown, 
U.S.A., who is vacationing in France: 

Klondike: Excuse me, pal. Can you tell me 
how to get to the Eyeful Tower? 

Jacques: Comment? Repetez, s'il vous plait. 

Klondike: "Ray pay tay?" What kinda lan- 
guage is that? Look, I just want to find the Eye- 
ful Tower. 

Jacques: Excusez-moi, monsieur, mais je ne 
comprends pas I 'anglais. 

Poor Mr. Putz is in trouble here. He knows 
what he wants, and Jacques has the information. 
But unless one of them learns how to speak the 
other's language, nothing will happen. This 
isn't new to Klondike, though. Back home, he 
used to have the same problem with his Apple. 
When he first got it, he switched it on and typed 
Soup is good food. With the same indifference 
as Jacques, the Apple responded with beep and 



?syntax error. 

Well, it didn't take long for Klondike to fig- 
ure out that his Apple wasn't going to learn to 
speak English, so he decided to learn to speak 
the Apple's language. After poring through 
book after book, Klondike learned that the Ap- 
ple speaks only one language: machine lan- 
guage. "Rats! Nothing on Earth resembling a 
human can possibly understand machine lan- 
guage," he thought. However, further reading 
brought enlightenment. 

In the world of programming, there are low- 
level languages and high-level languages. Low- 
level languages are those closest to what the 
computer understands, such as machine lan- 
guage. High-level languages are those that re- 
semble the way people talk and are easier for us 
to understand. Basic, Pascal, Fortran, and Logo 
are examples of high-level languages. 

Basic seemed like a language Klondike 
could handle. After all, Blaise Pascal was some 
French mathematician, and Klondike wasn't too 
good in math. Besides, he knew that Pascal was 
used mostly for writing business-type pro- 
grams, and being a rust repairman he didn't 
have much of an interest in business. Fortran 
got its name from /ormula rrawslation, which 
reminded Klondike of the horrifying days of 
high-school electronics and basic engineering 
(both of which he failed miserably). And Logo? 
Well, that's an introductory language for chil- 
dren, and Klondike was too proud to risk fail- 
ing to learn a language his kids had already 
mastered. 

So Basic it was. Klondike pulled up his 
chinos and got to work. An hour later, he quit. 

He quit because, as easy as Basic is to learn 
and use, Klondike just couldn't get the hang of 
it. (Don't let that be discouraging. Klondike 
was real dumb. His whole reason for visiting 
France was so he could learn how to make 
"real" French fries.) However, he did get as 
far as realizing that he didn't need to understand 
Basic in order to type in program listings he 
found in books and magazines. 

Klondike See, Klondike Do. One of his fa- 
vorite books was Programs in Basic for Numb- 
skulls Who Think French Fries Come from 
France. It consisted of nothing but Basic pro- 
gram listings along with descriptions of what 
each program did. Entering programs into the 
computer was simple enough for Klondike. All 
he had to do was type exactly what was shown 



BY ilATTHEW lUEfl 



in the book. Here's the first one: 

10 CLEAR : TEXT : HOME 
20 PRINT "When you're a Jet" 
30 PRINT "You're a Jet all the way" 
40 PRINT "From your first cigarette" 
50 PRINT "To your last dying day." 
60 END 

This program does nothing but print a few 
words on the screen. As we said before, almost 
no knowledge of Basic is required to type this 
program in. Klondike typed in each line as it ap- 
peared on the page, starting with the number at 
the beginning of each line and pressing the re- 
turn key at the end of the line. To run the pro- 
gram, all he did was type run. 

Unfortunately, Klondike was a pretty lousy 
typist. Here's what the program printed on the 
screen when it was run: 

When you're a Jeep 
You're a net all the day 
Fron your fist coggrattte 
To your Ixtd dbngng dqyey. 
7SYNTAX ERROR IN 60 



What went wrong? Though he was sure he had ! 
copied exactly what was in the book, Klondike 
examined his program by typing list and press- 
ing the return key. This is what he saw: 



10

PRINT ■ 
ENDD 



: TEXT : HOME 
When you're a Jeep" 
You're a net all the day" 
Fron your fist coggrattte" 
To your Ixtd dbngng dqyey." 



Well, it looks like the program ran exactly 
as it should have. All misspellings in Klondike's 
program listing appear when the program is 
run. The ? syntax error in 60 refers to the end 
statement in line 60. Basic recognizes end as 
signifying the end of a program, but endd is to- 
tally foreign. That's why Klondike got an error 
message. As for correcting the program, there 
are several ways. 

The first would be to start over. But for peo- 
ple like Klondike, that would mean running the 
risk of misspelling words again. Besides, it's a 
lot of typing. 

The second way involves using the arrow 
keys to move the cursor over and duplicate most 
of what is already in the program listing. When 



JANUARY 1984 



69 



you type something at the Basic prompt, the 
cursor indicates where the message ends. For 
example, catalog will bring up the disk's cata- 
log, and if we move the cursor back so it's over 
the / in catalog, it still says catalog on the 
screen; when we hit the return key, however, 
the command sent to the computer is cata. 

This is because the cursor looks in only one 
direction— backward; it can see only what it has 
passed, not what is in front (to the right) of it. 
So when we type catalog, it sees catalog. When 
we move the cursor back to the /, it sees only 
what is in back of it: cata. 

The cursor is also like a pencil in some 
ways. When we write, we lift the pencil off the 
paper to start a new word or write on a different 
area of the paper. If we didn't lift the pencil, 
we'd end up drawing lines all over the place. 
(Don't laugh; Klondike did this when he was 
a kid.) 

The Great Escape. On a computer, in order 
to move from one place to another without leav- 
ing a trail of unwanted characters, we have to 
get out of the "write" mode. This is where the 
escape key comes in; it lets us escape from 
"writing" so we can move the cursor around. 
There are four keys that move the cursor— I, J, 
K, and M. You'll notice that they form a dia- 
mond on the keyboard, and for good reason. I is 
for upward movement, J for moving to the left, 
K for the right, and M for going down. 

Normally, hitting these keys puts letters on 
the screen, so we have to get into the escape 
mode first. This is done by hitting the es- 
cape key once (it's the key marked "ESC"). 
Now we're in the escape mode, even though 
everything looks the same. In this mode, prac- 
tice moving the cursor around by using the I, J, 
K, and M keys. Yes, it is possible to use the M 
key to move the cursor down indefinitely (caus- 
ing everything on the screen to scroll out the 
top), but using the I key to move up doesn't 
bring it back. The I key moves only as far as the 
top of the screen. 

Hitting any key besides I, J, K, or M on the 
Apple n Plus will put things back into the nor- 
mal mode. On the lie, any key besides I, J, K, 
M, and the arrow keys takes you out of the 
escape mode and puts you back in the typing 
mode. 

Okay, escape works. Now what? Let's re- 
join Klondike and his editing travails at the key- 
board. Amazingly enough, line 10 is perfect. 
But by line 20, he started getting a little tired. 
Jeep should have been Jet. Since that's the last 
word in line 20, he decides to use the arrow 
keys to duplicate everything in front of that be- 
fore he makes the change. Let's follow along. 

First, he types list to display his program. 

10 CLEAR ; TEXT : HOME 

20 PRINT "When you're a Jeep" 

30 PRINT "You're a net all the day" 

40 PRINT "Fron your fist coggrattte" 

50 PRINT "To your Ixtd dbngng dqyey." 

60 ENDD 

Next, he hits the escape key to get into the es- 
cape mode. Then he uses the I key to move the 
cursor up to line 20. There, one touch of the J 
key moves the cursor from the 0 in 20 over to 
the 2 in 20. 



Klondike taps the space bar to get himself 
out of the escape mode and then uses the right 
arrow key to run the cursor over line 20 to the 
second e in Jeep. After he changes the second e 
to a t, he types a quote mark to close the print 
statement, and then he hits the return key. Now 
he types list 20 to look at line 20 so he can see 
his change: 

20 PRINT "When you're a Jet" 

Laboriously, Klondike carries out similar 
procedures for each line until he has them all 
correct. 

The Ambitious Mr. Putz. Let's suppose he 
gets real ambitious one day and tries to combine 
all the words into one sentence instead of break- 
ing them up. Typing very carefully, he comes 
up with: 

10 PRINT "When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all 
the way, from your first cigarette to your 
last ding day." 

Rats! It was perfect up until the second to last 
word. Assuming the above line hasn't scrolled 
off the screen, Klondike can use the escape 
mode to move up and the right arrow to go over 
the whole thing until he gets to ding, which he'll 
change to dying. 

Even if the line has scrolled off the screen, 
Klondike can still list line 10 to edit it. This is 
what he gets: 

10 PRINT "When you're a Jet, you 
're a Jet all the way, from 
your first cigarette to your 
last ding day." 

As before, he uses escape-I and J to get to the 
beginning of the line, and then he traces the line 
with the right arrow key, until he gets to ding, 
which he corrects. But when he runs this little 
program, the results are a bit confusing. 

When you're a Jet, you 're a 
Jet all the way, from your f 

irst cigarette to your last 
dying day. 

The cause of all this confusion is in the way 
Applesoft lists things. For reasons of its own, 
Applesoft doesn't use up all forty characters per 
line on the screen when it lists programs. In- 
stead, it breaks up program lines into seemingly 
inconsistent batches. The result is that there are 
several unused spaces on the screen. 

Look at the way it listed line 10 in the one- 
line program. The line that begins with 're a Jet 
is indented. When Klondike used the arrow key 
to copy everything in line 10, it copied all the 
blank spaces in the indentation. That's why all 
those blank spaces appear between you and 're a 
Jet when the program is run. 

You Can Take the Hard Way. As usual 
with computers, there are two ways to get 
around this problem— the hard way and the easy 
way. The hard way is to go over the first part of 
line 10 in the usual manner. Then, when the 
cursor gets past you in the first you 're, use the 
escape-J to "lift" the cursor up and move it 
back to the beginning of the second line, begin- 
ning with 're a Jet. Continue this for each part 



of line 10 until last dying day. 

What a pain. Don't do it this way. 

The easy way is to do a bit of fiddling with 
Apple's memory. Clear the screen with the 
home command. Now type poke 33,33. This 
command displays program listings in thirty- 
three columns instead of the usual forty fthe 
first 33 indicates the memory location; the sec- 
ond 33 indicates the number of columns you 
want the Apple to use in displaying its output). 

Now when Klondike types list, line 10 will 
appear without any extra spaces, and he can edit 
the line by using the arrow keys without any 
problem. 

To get out of the thirty-three-column mode 
and back into forty columns, type: 

POKE 33,40 

This puts the value of forty (the number of col- 
umns we want) into memory location thirty- 
three. (For some real fun, try poking various 
numbers into location thirty -three. Poke 33,1 
does some really strange stuff, as does poke 
33,90. Don't worry; the grinding noises coming 
from the disk drive can't damage the disk— we

Why, It's Almost Human. One of the nice 
things about Applesoft is that it can tell where 
one "word" ends and the next begins. This is 
known as parsing. 

Parsing means breaking a sentence into its 
parts and explaining the function of each part.

A teacher 
for the Apple 

Meet Lee McFadden, your personal guide to 
the Apple //e. Soflalk Magazine has 
praised Lee's audio cassette tapes as "a 
superior way to learn about an Apple." And 
Apple itself chose them to train its own 
field sales reps. 

The reason? FlipT rack's carefully 
sequenced cassette lessons let you learn in 
the most natural way possible — by sitting 
down with a knowledgeable friend. Even if 
you have never touched a computer, in just 
3 step-by-step sessions you will learn to: 

• Use each special key and essential 

command 

• Load and run programs 

• Save programs and data 

• Copy programs and diskettes 

• Protect and modily programs 

• And much more! 

In short, you will be able to use existing 
programs with confidence, as you enter 
your own data, organize your files and 
understand the principles of what you and 
your computer can do. If you later decide to 
take up programming, you'll have the solid 
background necessary. 

A Proven Teaching Approach 

With interactive FlipT rack cassettes, you 
learn by doing. No reading required. You 
learn at your own convenience, at your own 
pace, on your own computer — like having a 
personal tutor "talk you through" each 
procedure. 

You work directly with Apple's own 3.3 
System Master and Sample Programs 
diskettes, trying the commands and 
programs you want to master, and seeing 
the results. No secondhand simulations. 

Best of all, the patented FlipT rack format 
of the tapes lets you choose the subjects 
that interest you, covering as much or as

Basic does something similar to what we type in 
at the keyboard; it finds words that it knows and 
inserts breaks between those words. 

For example, suppose we type the following 
line: 

10 I DON'T WANT TO GROW UP; I'M A 
TOYS R US KID 

When we list it, it will appear on the screen like 
this: 

10 IDON 'TWANTTOGROWUP;l'MATO 
YSRUSKID 

Yecch. What a mess. That's because we recog- 
nize it as an advertising slogan; but Applesoft, 
not having watched too much television, sees it 
as an Applesoft command. The words on, to, 
and gr are recognizable to Applesoft, so it puts 
spaces in front and in back of those words when 
it finds them. And where it doesn't recognize 
any words, it closes spaces up. That's why / 
don 't want becomes Id on 'twant; the only set of 
letters Applesoft recognizes is the on in don 't. 
So, it just separates on from the rest and glues 
everything else together. 

What this means for people like Klondike 
Putz, who want only to be able to copy pro- 
grams from a printed page into the computer, is 
that almost all spaces can be ignored when typ- 
ing in programs. We can type the line: 

10FORZ = 0TO4:VTAB22:INPUTA$: 
PRINTA$:NEXT 

And when we list it, it will come out as 

10 FORZ = 0TO4: VTAB22: INPUTA$: 
PRINT A$: NEXT 

The only time we have to pay attention to 
spaces is when they occur between quote 
marks, usually in print and input statements. 
This is because characters between quote marks 
are ignored by Basic's parser. In other words, 
whatever appears in the quote marks of a print 
or input statement will appear exactly that way 
when the program is run. So if Klondike gets 
carried away in ignoring the space bar, the line 

10 IFX = 5THENPRINT"l'maToysRUskid," 
will list as 

IPX = 5 THEN PRINT "I'maToysRUskid," 
and it will say 
I'maToysRUskid. 

when the program is run. 

Quote marks are just as important in Basic 
programs as they are when quoting politicians 
(however, Basic programs can't sue you). 

Why, It's Almost like Word Processing. 
Inputting programs is much like inputting data 
for almost any applications program, whether 
it's a word processor, spreadsheet program, or 
database management system. First, it's impor- 
tant to save your work frequently. Nothing 
short of fingernails on the chalkboard can match 



the agony of accidentally losing data after hours 
of hard work. Actually, there are no such things 
as accidents in programming. They're more ac- 
curately described as caused disasters. 

For instance, last Tuesday Klondike spent 
an hour and a half inputting The Bunny Hop. 
Then, as he went to get a nice cup of Bosco, he 
tripped over the Apple's power cord, discon- 
necting it and causing an hour and a half of data 
entry to be lost. An hour and a half's work for 
Klondike amounts to just twenty lines of Basic 
code, but that's not the point. The point is that 
all this could have been avoided. 

To begin with, the power cord shouldn't 
have been out in the open where someone could 
trip over it. Just as important, at the rate Klon- 
dike types, he should have been saving his pro- 
gram to disk every two lines or so. That way, if 
data in memory were lost, he would have had at 
least some of the program on disk. Now he has 
to start all over. 

Inputting Basic programs is also similar to 
using applications programs in that it's possible 
to edit your Basic listing at random spots, just as 
you can update information in applications pro- 
grams. Basic allows you to input lines in any or- 
der you wish because it puts them in the correct 
order for you. When Klondike was inputting 
The Bunny Hop, he began with line 100. Later, 
he realized that the program listing started on 
the previous page with lines 10 through 90. No 
problem. He later input 10 through 90, and Ba- 
sic put them at the beginning of the program, 
where they belong. 

Ever Wonder? While looking at Basic 
listings, you might have noticed that lines are 
usually numbered in increments of ten (10, 20, 
30 . . . 120, 130, 140 . . .). This is to make 
programs easy to edit. Suppose Klondike fin- 
ishes inputting The Bunny Hop and decides he 
needs another line between 550 and 560. No 
problem. He can add the line by beginning it 
with any number between (but not including) 
550 and 560. Basic puts the line w)iere it be- 
longs—between 550 and 560. 

Numbering program lines in steps of ten 
isn't a hard and fast rule; it's just a generally ac- 
cepted practice. Programs that you think will 
undergo much revision might be numbered in 
increments of 50 or 100. When the program is 
finished, it's good practice to have all the line 
numbers increment by the same number, gener- 
ally ten. 

If you've done a lot of revising, you can re- 
number the entire program by running a pro- 
gram on the System Master called Renumber. 
Then when it goes back into Applesoft, issue 
the following commands from the Applesoft 
prompt: 

LOAD filename 
&FIRST 10, INC 10 
SAVE filename 

Filename refers to the program you want to re- 
number. &First 10 tells Renumber that you 
want the new renumbered program to start with 
line number 10. Inc 10 tells it to increase each 
line number by an increment of ten. When you 
list your program now, you'll see it start with 
line 10 and increase each line number by ten. 
Of course, you can have it start with any 



number and increment by any number you 
want, but starting with line 10 and increasing by 
10 is the conventional way of doing it. Renum- 
ber does a lot more than just this, and it's all 
fully explained in the Renumber Instructions 
program, which is al.so on the System Master 
disk. 

Save the Bunnies. Saving programs is a 
relative easy process. The format for the save 
command is 

SAVE BUNNY HOP 

The only thing to pay close attention to is the 
choice of name you give a program. File names 
can be almost anything you want, as long as 
they start with a letter of the alphabet. Some 
nonletter characters work, but letters of the al- 
phabet are usually the way to go. 

File names can be as short as one character 
or as long as thirty. Whatever you name a pro- 
gram, be sure it's different from any other pro- 
gram already on the disk. Saving a program 
with the same name as an existing program will 
indeed save your program; however, it will also 
wipe out the program on disk that used to have 
that name. 

No fair using commas in file names. This is 
because when DOS sees a comma, it thinks 
that's the end of the file name, and that what 
follows are disk and slot specifications. Con- 
sider some of Klondike's examples: 

SAVE BUNNY HOP, D2 

SAVE BUNNY HOP, S5 

SAVE BUNNY HOP, S4,D1 

BSAVE BUNNY.PIC, A$2000,L$2000 

The first one tells DOS to save Bunny Hop to 
disk drive two, while the second one says to 
save it to the disk in slot five. 

The third example instructs DOS to save the 
program to slot four, drive one. The last one is 
a little different. It bsaves a binary file, which 
starts at a hexadecimal memory address 
(A$2000) and runs for a specified length 
(L$2000). 

That's why commas are out of bounds for 
file names; DOS thinks that everything after the 
comma has nothing to do with the file name, but 
rather with how to save the file. 

Whew! In a nutshell, that's the bare bones 
of how to input Basic programs from listings. 
It's a relief to know that we don't have to be 
computer whizzes to input programs that some- 
one else has written. 

If you were crafty enough to copy off your 
neighbor's test paper in school, then copying 
Basic listings from a book or magazine should 
be a cinch. Most of the things we covered here 
are just meant to make things easier in case 
something goes wrong. 

There's no rule that everyone with a com- 
puter is obligated to learn to program, just as 
there aren't any federal laws saying that anyone 
who buys a stereo system is obligated to learn to 
create music. But if the urge to become comput- 
er-lingual strikes, then go for it. Basic is really 
an easy language to understand, even if you 
can't program in it. 

After all, not everyone who speaks English 
can write a novel, or even a short story. Right, 
Klondike?

FROM RESEARCH 
Br ALBERT (UU AHD BOB (UhHinCS 

Two recent developments from Cupertino demonstrate that Apple 
hasn't forgotten its first business computer, or that computer's users, in 
the mad rush to introduce new machines. A new Apple HI team, formed 
last July by directive of new Apple president John ScuUey, will provide 
more far-reaching support for the installed user base of the Apple III than 
has heretofore been available. Apple has high hopes that this group, a 
strong influx of new software, and the upgraded Apple HI Plus released 
last month will make the Apple III the computer of choice for more small 
and middle-sized businesses. 

The new team, called the Apple III Personal Business Systems 
Group, is fully responsible for supporting the Apple HI product line. It is 
independent of other departments at Apple, answering directly to Ken 
Zerbe, Apple vice president of finance. Previously, Apple HI product 
support and development was handled by the same group that was in 
charge of the Apple H, and the II overshadowed the HI. The new, in- 
dependent group will be able to get things done for the Apple HI without 
the delays that come with having every decision filter up and down 
through the ranks. 

The group is composed of eight marketing, sales, and engineering 
specialists — the most experienced Apple HI people in the company. The 
task before them is no trivial one: competing with IBM for a rapidly en- 
trenching business computer market. The long-predicted shakeout has 
arrived, and Apple doesn't want the HI to become one of the shaken. 

To keep a computer alive in a competitive market, the manufacturer 
must walk a tightrope, balancing the users on one side and the developers 
on the other. Potential customers must be convinced that the machine 
will be supported, and that the software base will continue to grow and 
improve. Third-party software developers must be convinced that the 
user base will continue to grow — that there will be a viable market for 
their products. The tricky part for Apple's new group is to appease and 
convince both of these factions at the same time. 

Easy as One New Three. The introduction of the Apple IH Plus 
should help convince developers that Apple intends to stand behind the 
HI. It should also persuade new customers that the Apple HI is a living, 
breathing product without dispossessing the current user base — another 
neat trick. The Apple HI Plus is an advance over what came before, but 
it is not as significant an advance as the Apple He was over the Apple H 
Plus; it won't leave older users behind. 

The Apple HI Plus has a handful of new features, only two of which 
will be unavailable as upgrades to the older Apple His. Those features 
that current owners won't be able to get for their machines are a delete 
key and additional radio frequency interference shielding to meet FCC 
standards. The established user base can breathe a gigantic sigh of relief: 
The presence or absence of RFI shielding will have no effect on future

hardware or software compatibility. Software developers will be aware 
of the missing delete key on older Apple Ills; most likely, they will 
assign its function to some other key on the keyboard. For instance, the 
latest version of Apple Writer III will use the backslash key as an alter- 
nate delete. 

What's the Plus? The Apple HI Plus wiU come with 256K of RAM 
(this has been the standard configuration of new Apple Ills for about six 
months), a clock-calendar chip, user-switchable interlacing for higher 
resolution graphics and text on the Monitor III, a built-in port for the 
Silentype printer, and an accessory kit with tutorial disks and new 
manuals. There is also a new version of the operating system, SOS 1.3, 
which will come with the new HI Plus. 

All of these things are available for the Apple IH, some even as free 
upgrades. The clock chip, which allows all versions of SOS to time- 
stamp and date-stamp files, will be free, as will SOS version 1.3, which 
has been available to Apple III owners from Apple dealers since last 
summer. The memory upgrade and the Silentyjie interface (although not 
a built-in one) have been available all along, of course. The screen inter- 
lacing will be available to Apple EH owners for less than $100. 

The screen interlace is an interesting development. What it means is 
that the Apple Hi's current vertical resolution of 192 pixels will be effec- 
tively doubled. Text and graphics are transmitted to the monitor by 
means of what is called a raster scan. That is, acting on a signal from the 
computer, the monitor passes an electron beam across the screen, scan- 
ning each of the 192 screen lines in sequence, and turning dots on and 
off. This scan happens so fast that our eyes can't distinguish the rapidly 
flickering dots from a solid image. Interlacing changes the raster scan 
from a one-step to a two-step process. That is, it provides a 384-line 
resolution by first scanning the 192 odd-numbered lines and then scan- 
ning the 192 even-numbered lines. 

At the moment, the screen interlace gives the user more solid text 
characters and little else. A lot could be built from this development, 
however. The Lisa, for instance, depends on its very high resolution 
display for its advanced use of icons and windows. The higher your 
resolution, the more you can put on the screen. 

Hi, Mickey! AppleMouse III is a new product for the III that will 
most likely be put to use in conjunction with the screen interlacing to pro-

duce some very Lisa-like effects. The mouse has been hailed as one of 
the most natural user interfaces currently available for small computers, 
and the flexibility of the SOS driver system should allow the Ap- 
pleMouse HI to be integrated into new software and updated versions of 
existing programs in short order. 

Of new software, there will be plenty. Apple says that more than 
three hundred sixty developers are currently working on Apple UI prod- 
ucts. One company showing real promise is Haba Systems, which has a 
number of new programs for the III. One of these programs is an in- 
tegrated spreadsheet, database manager, and word processor called /// 
E-Z Pieces. Such integrated packages usually allow data transfer among 
the three applications, as well as easy access to the functions of one ap- 
plication from within another. If a package is extremely well integrated, 
all three applications may actually be running at once. Considering the 
great success of Lx>tus Development's 1-2-3, a similarly integrated pro- 
gram on the IBM PC, the appearance of such a program on the Apple HI 
is great news, but not a great surprise. 

Haba Systems also has Habanet, Habadex, and Habatel. Habanet is a 
hard disk management system, like Quark's newly updated Catalyst 2.0. 
These programs allow you to copy programs onto a hard disk and call 
them up from a central menu. These aren't just sophisticated menu pro- 
grams: They even let you copy protected programs onto the hard disk. 
Considering that much of the professional software used on the Apple EI 
is protected, these programs make a hard disk significantly more 
valuable to the Apple HI owner. 

Habadex and Habatel are telephone accounting management pro- 
grams. They maintain lists of phone numbers, perform automatic phone 
dialing, and beep at preset times to remind the user of appointments and 
meetings. Once run, they can sit in the computer in the "background," 
waiting to be called by a clock interrupt. Habadex is geared to a single 
user, while Habatel is set up for multiple-line phone systems like those 
used in hotels. 

Other Apple HI products now arriving or on the way include database 
management systems such as Keystroke and AppleFile III, and a wide 
range of communications software, such as an emulator for the IBM 
3270 communications protocol. On the hardware side, a twenty- 
megabyte hard disk and a tape streamer hard disk backup unit are coming 
from Mountain Computer, and a 512K memory upgrade is coming from 
Macrotech. Apple has dropjjed its Unifile and and Duofile high-density 
disk drives for now, but high-density drives should be coming soon from 
other manufacturers. 

It's Your Serve. The Apple HI Personal Business Systems Group has 
been working with developers to help bring about these products for the 
Apple HI and the new Apple IH Plus. They've also been working to pro- 
vide support directly to the user. The first two of a series of regular mail- 
ings went out to registered Apple HI users last October and December. 
The purpose of these mailings was to announce new products and 
developments for the Apple HI from Apple and other vendors. 

Apple is also sponsoring Apple Serve HI, a support program far more 
revolutionary (as in "computer revolution") than mere mailings. Apple 
Serve HI is a network service that Apple will provide free of charge to all 
Apple HI owners, at least for the next three months. After the initial 
period, Apple Serve EQ will probably be available at a discounted rate, 
subsidized by Apple. 

Operated through a major established network, Apple Serve HI pro- 
vides an electronic mail service and a bulletin board system for exchang- 
ing hardware and software tips, user group locations and meeting infor- 
mation, and general interest news. In addition, the Personal Business 
Systems Group will act as editor-in-chief of an electronic newsletter on 
Apple Serve HI to supplement the news mailings. The on-line letter will 
contain more up-to-date news on Apple HI products, services, upgrades, 
and places to get them. 

Apple IH users are a pretty loyal bunch, and for good reason. The 
Apple HI is a well-designed machine with a lot going for it, and SOS is 
an unusually flexible operating system. Nevertheless, the machine has 
suffered from a lack of software from developers, and of support from 
Apple. At the dawn of a new generation of computer and software tech- 
nology, the Apple HI could have died of neglect. That would have been 
a tragedy. It has never been Apple's way to sweep out the old as it ushers 
in the new, because older computers are also computers that have been 
tested, and that have earned the confidence of the user. With a new Ap- 
ple HI support group, Apple seems to be acting in character again. i

I have a problem. I acci- 
dentally discovered this 
while playing around with a way to save text 
screens in a manner similar to saving graphics 
screens. This question is directed especially to 
expert machine language programmers. 

In order to convey my predicament with the 
greatest of proficiency, I must first ask all of 
you first-aiders to start up your Apples. Next, 
boot a normally initialized disk and load a Basic 
program. Make sure the disk has a minimum of 
ten free sectors. Now type bsave any file name, 
A2024,L$7FF. Clear the memory by typing 
new. Next, type blood file name. Make certain 
that you bload the same file name that you 
bsaved. Now type list. With any luck, the Basic 
program that you loaded before typing the bsave 
command has been retrieved. In order to make 
sure that it happened, I asked you to clear the 
memory. So, by analogy, what we have done 
here is save a Basic program as a binary file! 
And the interesting part is that, regardless of the 
Basic program's longevity, it'll be saved with a 
catalog register of ten! Hence, it'll take only a 
fraction of the time to load and save it. 

Now for the disappointing problem: After 
bloading the binary Basic file (don't get con- 
fiased), why won't it run properly? After all, if 
it will list properly, it should also run properly. 
In my experiments, about 99 percent of the time 
the first two or three lines ran the first time I 
typed run, but what of the remaining lines? Fur- 
thermore, consecutive attempts failed entirely. 
Any help in finding an explanation for this 
problem would be greatly appreciated. Khur-

THIN 



Shouldn't you be spend- 
ing your time working 
on "normal" programming instead of trying all 
sorts of strange things to annoy your Apple and 
keep magazine columnists up all night? Now 
that you've gone and stirred things up, let's see 
if I can untangle them well enough to give an 
explanation (or at least confuse everyone 
enough to keep them busy for another month). 

In solving any problem, one of the first steps 
is to isolate what the truly relevant aspects are. 
In this case the most important pointers are: 

Beginning of Basic program: $167,68 
End of Basic "envelope": $AF,BO 
Beginning of variables: $69, 6A 

We'll also keep in mind the following facts: 
1 . 2024 decimal ($800 hex) is just one byte 



before the address ($801) of the beginning of 
most (99.9 percent) Applesoft Basic programs. 

2. The Bsave Filename, A2024,L$7FF 
command saves eight "pages" (256 bytes per 
page) of binary data from memory, starting at 
location 2024. 

3. When a program is listed, Applesoft 
starts at the beginning-of-program pointer and 
translates data stored in memory into the listing 
you see on the screen. Important secret: Apple- 
soft does not stop listing at the end-of-program 
pointer but rather only when it encounters a line 
number link field equal to zero. 

(If you're unfamiliar with the link fields that 
Applesoft uses in each line of a Basic program, 
see the January 1982 Assembly Lines in Softalk. 
In general, the essence of the idea of link fields 
is that in memory, each line number actually 
begins with a two-byte address of the location of 
the next program line in memory. The list func- 
tion uses these links to go from line to line and 
stops when the address indicated by the link 
field is zero.) 

First, so we can all agree on what Basic pro- 
gram we're talking about, let's use this one as 
our test program: 



10 
20 
30 



FOR 1 = 1 TO 10 
PRINT I 
NEXT 



Before going any further, let's go into the 
Monitor and see what the important pointers say 
about how Applesoft views this program. Enter 
the Monitor by typing call — 151 . When you get 
the asterisk prompt (*), enter: 

67 68 AF BO 69 6A 

You should get: 

67- 01 

68- 08 
AF- ID 
BO- 08 

69- ID 
6A- 08 

This tells you that the Basic program is stored 
from $801 to $8 ID in memory. Notice also that 
variables are stored starting at the end of the 
program, $8 ID also. Reenter Basic by typing a 
control-C. 

Now, following your instructions, we'll 
bsave this program by typing: 

BSAVE FILENAME, A2024, L$7FF 

What happens here is that a block of memo- 
ry from $800 to $FFF ($800 -l-$7FF = $FFF) is 
saved to disk. In our experiment the program is 
much shorter, so we're saving a lot more data to 
disk than necessary. But no matter for the mo- 
ment. 

A memory map of things is pictured in 
Figure 1. 

When you then type in new, the computer, 
in unsuspecting innocence, resets the program 
pointers back to the smallest range possible — 
namely, a program three bytes long consisting 
of the two bytes zeroed out for the link fields (so 
that a list command produces nothing on the 



JANUARY 1984 



77 



screen), and a third byte that we will find out 
about when someone writes a letter requesting 
more information. 

You should now reenter the Monitor and list 
the pointers again for confirmation:

to disk 



-$69 6A 
-$AF BO

S81D, beginning ot variables

See Figure 2. 

At last — the coup de grace! You bload the 
data back into memory to end up with Basic data 
overlaid where the "null" program previously 
resided. See Figure 3 below.

Even after the bload, you can confirm that 
Applesoft does not really recognize the new 
program's memory requirements by examining 
the pointers again and noting that they have 
not changed. 

When you list the program, Applesoft in its 
ignorance starts listing the contents starting at 
$803, and since the index fields are in order it 
can at least list the text of each line. 

Unfortunately, when you run the program, 
as soon as the first variable is defined, Apple-

ning-of-variables pointer location and thus 
scrambles a portion of the program. 

You can confirm the variable-related nature 
of this problem simply by defining a variable in 
the immediate mode, without running the pro- 
gram. For example, after the bload, the pro- 
gram should list normally. Then type in X = 1 . 
The program will now list as: 



22538 

20 PRINTI 

30 NEXT I 

The 22538 is a garbage line number created 
by the variable data for the value 1 being written 
into the program space. 

There are a number of possible variations 
here. If no variables are defined, the program 
will run fine all the way to the end. If the first 
variable definition occurs early in the program, 
the variable table will write past the point cur- 
rently being executed in the Basic text as in the 
example above, and the program will immedi- 
ately crash. A third possibility is that the pro- 
gram will define variables late enough in the 
listing so that the variable table will damage on- 
ly the lines that have already been executed at 
the begiiming of the listing. If this happens, the 
program will continue to run, even though it is 
gradually eating itself up as new variables are 
defined. Because gotos and gosubs scan the en- 
tire listing on many occasions, these will also be 
affected by the deterioration of the listing. 

The other possibility not mentioned so far is 
that the program might have been longer than 
ten sectors. In that case, the variable overwrite 
problem will remain, in addition to the question 
of how an apparently longer program can still 
be stored in ten sectors. The source of the illu- 
sion here is that for a long program, even after 
the new command, the data in memory past lo- 
cation $FFF is still there. When you bload the 
data back into memory, the two pieces are 
linked back together even though the program 
pointers are not changed. To verify that you 
have not really saved the entire program to disk, 
turn off the computer after the bsave, and then 
turn it back on to do the bload. You should find 
that the end of the program has now been lost 
and possibly has been replaced with garbage at 
the end of the remaining listing. 

I hope it is now clear why the file is always 
ten sectors long. The bsave is always the same 
length, and what you're saving is really not 
related to the length of what you see listed on 
the screen with the list command. 

For those who may be wondering why eight 
pages of memory take up ten sectors on the disk 
when a page of memory is exactly the same size 
as a disk sector, remember that it takes an extra 
sector on the disk for the track-sector list for the 
file (8-1-1=9), and that DOS adds a few bytes 
of its own to the file so that we just barely over- 
flow onto the extra sector on the disk (9 -I- 1 = 
10). 

P.S. As long as we're both up this evening, 
think about this: With the program bloaded as 
before, immediately after the new statement, 
type in del 0,1. Now go into the Monitor and 
examine the program pointers again. Hmmmm.

The Schoolhouse Apple 

by Jock Root 




Steve Wozniak knows quite a lot about computers — he's one of the 
men who designed the Apple and wrote much of its original software— 
and he's interested in education. As a result, he worked on the Kids Can't 
Wait program, which (with some help from the California Legislature) 
has put nearly a thousand Apples into California's schools. We spoke to 
him recently about the future of computers in the classroom; he had some 
interesting things to say. 

The most immediate problem is cost, of course— or, to look at it from 
another angle, availability. However, that will change with time (as it did 
with the digital wristwatch or the ball-point pen). There will come a time 
when every student will be able to spend several hours a day with a com- 
puter (via a terminal or something similar), and in order to be ready for 
that time we need to start writing new kinds of software. 

The Ideal Learning Situation. From the student's viewpoint, the 
ideal situation would be to have one teacher all to himself during a whole 
course. That teacher would be immediately available all the time to help 
him whenever he had difficulty; even when teacher and student weren't 
interacting directly, the teacher would be observing the student, noting 
which material he had trouble with and planning teaching strategies to 
help him understand those areas. 

This situation would also be ideal from an educational standpoint— 
and not just for the student. The teacher would be able to apply aU her 
skills and attention to one subject, and she could really begin to teach— 
instead of just reading lectures, giving tests, and trying to stay in control 
of an unruly mob. 

Unfortunately, as long as there are more students than teachers, this 
will not be possible. 

Technology Today. Modem technology is helping in several ways. 
Educational TV and videodiscs are bringing information to more and 
more people , and computers are exploring the possibilities of interaction . 

Videodiscs and TV can present information in attractive and in- 
teresting ways. When you reach that many students at once, the relative 
cost per student is low, and it becomes practical to do fancy and elaborate 
presentations. This can be a very effective way to present information; 
but as Wozniak points out, that's not the same thing as teaching. 

The problem is, there is no feedback— the program cannot respond to 
the student's actions. The material is recorded (or broadcast) and must be 
exactly the same for each student; it will make a point and then roll 
blindly on, whether you understood the point or not (or it will repeat the 
point over and over, boring you stiff). 

A computer can provide the missing interaction. It can change the 
flow of material, depending on your answer to each question it asks, and 
it can keep a record of what you had trouble with, as well as what was 
easy for you. Then it can provide extra review, and different teaching 
techniques, for the difficult stuff— letting you skim through the stuff you 
found easy. 

But there is little software available now that actually does this for 
more than an hour or two's worth of material at a time; there's nothing 
that can handle a whole semester's coursework. Most of today's teaching 
programs are not at all sophisticated; as Woz puts it, in most classrooms 
the computer is no more than a fancy exerciser. 

Worse than that, today's computers are too scarce and too expensive: 
Only a few students have any access at all, and most who do are restricted 
to a few minutes a week. The kind of interaction we want ideally requires 
several hours a day— that is, one computer (and software library) for 
each student. 



The Computer as Teacher. What we need is a "teacher" pro- 
gram—a program with significant artificial intelligence capabilities that 
could interact with the student as a real person would. Wozniak thinks 
this is very important. The program should have an actual "personality" 
that reacts with the student— not necessarily a "human" personality, but 
the personality of an intelligent being devoted to helping the student 
learn. This program, which we'll refer to here as Teacher, would ad- 
minister a library of "course" programs, making selections on the basis 
of a student's current needs and keeping record of progress on several 
levels. 

Most of the program's interaction with students would be in ques- 
tion-and-answer form: either about the course material being run, or be- 
tween-course sessions on more general topics. A "general conversa- 
tion" might go something like this: 

"How am I doing, teacher?" 

"You're doing fine here, Nancy, but you're not very good at subtrac- 
tion yet. Shall we do some more of that now?" 

Teacher would be able to understand a wide variety of inputs, even

allowing for misspellings and bad grammar (which it would make note of 
for future correction). It would also have a call it could recognize from 
within a "course" program, so the student could talk to it at any time. 

Whenever a student talked to the program, teacher would have 
available a record of all past student- TVac/j^r transactions (in suitably 
edited and cross-referenced form). It would be familiar with the way 
each student expressed himself and would be able to "read between the 
lines"— to determine what was meant in ambiguous situations, and to 
help students make themselves clear. This would likely have a significant 
positive effect on motivation: students would probably try harder for a 
teacher who understood and appreciated them as individuals. 

On the subject of motivation, Wozniak thinks the current interest in 
game-oriented teaching programs is exaggerated. Such programs can 
provide motivation for students to run them, but that's not the same as 
motivation to learn the assigned material. Students are quite capable of 
learning for the sake of learning— if the material is presented well. As 
Woz puts it, "I just don't think that Nature made us that way, that we 
have to be tricked." 

It goes without saying that Teacher would also be too smart to be 
conned in the way a sharp student might try to con a human teacher. Its 
designers would be picked from our best teachers and would thus know 
all the tricks. 

Teacher would keep track of all kinds of things, such as which quiz 
questions the student got wrong within a course (and even which wrong 
answers were chosen, if that's useful information) and which subject 
areas and teaching techniques proved most difficult— and even the time 
she asked, "Teacher, what's the real difference between men and 
women?" 

Any information that would prove useful in shaping students' educa- 
tion would be available to the human teachers overseeing the process, 
enabling them to observe a clear and detailed picture of student progress, 
and to design review sequences and educational strategies to reinforce 
weak areas and challenge strong ones. Also, this information could pro- 



tect the human teacher from being unduly influenced by first impres- 
sions, personality quirks, and the like. 

Technology Tomorrow. By today's standards, of course, this would 
be impossibly expensive, requiring one computer per student full-time, 
or at least one very intelligent terminal per student, and an elaborate net- 
work system. In terms of technology, we would need at least three things 
to make it possible: increased system complexity, vastly increased on- 
board memory (plus more and faster mass-storage capabilities), and a 
factor-of-ten reduction in costs. 

However, we're moving closer to all of that right now. Integrated cir- 
cuits are being designed that put most of the functions of the Apple into 
a single chip. When they get into production, they will provide a con- 
siderable reduction in cost (or a vast increase in complexity for about the 
same cost). 

Silicon memory is perhaps the most dramatic cost-shrink area in com- 
puters today: 64K machines for $300 are commonplace, and the price is 
continuing to go down. By the time we get the software written, we'll 
probably be able to put Teacher on a one-megabyte ROM chip for about 
five bucks. We already have the mass-storage capability in hard disks or 
videodisc data storage— it's just impossibly expensive. That will change, 
with time. 

We're moving in the right direction, Wozniak believes— but we're 
still a long way away. Most school systems today would be hard put to 
spend a couple of hundred dollars per disk, even for a perfect system (if 
one were available). And the hardware alone, for the system we've 
described, would easily cost ten times that (never mind the software, 
which hasn't even been written yet). 

It may take as long as ten years, but we're moving toward the place 
where each student can have a teacher all to himself. Not a human 
teacher, of course— but a teaching program designed by the best human 
teachers that can concentrate all its "attention" on that one student— 
surely a better deal than the estimated 5 percent of a teacher's attention 
that most students currently receive. Dl

(This article contains excerpts from Polyspi Inspi, a booklet of math activities 
on and off the computer, published by Martin-Bearden.) 

Have you ever looked closely at string art designs? Circles, ovals, 
and intricate patterns are created with multicolored threads. If you study 
the design carefully, or, better yet, do one yourself, you'll discover that 
the curves are actually created by straight lines crossing back and forth at 
different angles. 

With a little imagination and clear thinking, we can probably figure 
out a way to teach the turtle to create curves from straight lines and then 
use those procedures to make intricate string art patterns on the screen. 

Look at the ARCH procedure below: 

TO ARCH :SIZE :ANGLE 
IF :SIZE < 5 [STOP] 
FD :SIZE 
BK :SIZE -5 
LT :ANGLE 

ARCH :SIZE -4 ANGLE 
END

Experiment with each of these procedures and other variations. Com- 
pare what happens when you use the same inputs in the various pro- 
cedures. Try lots of inputs, large and small, and make notes on what 
happens. 

Try repeating the same procedure and inputs several times to create a 
circle. Here is ARCH 85 6 repeated seven times: 




In this example, the turtle will go forward a certain amount, go 
backward that same amount minus 5, and turn left a specified amount. 
The recursive line tells the turtle to subtract 4 from the input for SIZE. 
Each time the procedure is repeated, the SIZE is reduced by four. 

The conditional line tells the procedure to stop IF SIZE <5. If you 
define the procedure with a conditional line that says IF SIZE < 0 
[STOP], you will end up with a tail at the end of some of your designs 
(depending on which inputs you try). Follow the procedure through step 
by step and you'll discover why. Suppose we give the command ARCH 
57 10. Each time the recursive line is reached, the computer will subtract 
4. Thus, SIZE will go from 57 to 53 to 49 to 45 . . . to 9 to 5 to 1 . Sub- 
tracting 4 from 1 will result in SIZE < 0, so the procedure will stop. But 
let's look at what happens when SIZE is 1. The turtle will go FOR- 
WARD 1 and then will go BACK 1 -5, or -4. Going BK -4 is the 
same as going FD 4, which results in the tail. 

Try some variations of the ARCH procedure; for example, increase 
the angle by various amounts. Here are a few variations. Try others. 

TO ARCH1 :SIZE ANGLE 
IF :SIZE < 5 [STOP] 
FD :SIZE 
BK :SIZE -5 
LT ANGLE 

ARCH1 :SIZE -5 ANGLE + 1 
END 




By defining procedures with the turtle mrning to the right instead of 
the left, you can put the right and left procedures together to make 
mirror-image designs.

END 

Suppose you took one of the procedures and rotated and repeated it 
enough times to make a certain polygon, say a square or a pentagon or a 
hexagon. Let's try a square first. Using ARCH.SQ, we could make a 
square by repeating the procedure four times and rotating 90 degrees be- 
tween each rotation. Look at the following procedure: 

TO SQUARE :SIZE :ANGLE 

REPEAT 4 [ARCH.SQ ShZE ANGLE LT 90] 

END 

Experiment with SQUARE, using lots of different inputs. Compare 
what happens with large and small inputs for SIZE and ANGLE. 

Write a procedure to put four SQUAREs together. Once again, ex- 
periment with lots of numbers. Some very interesting things begin to 
happen as you rotate and repeat figures. Here are a couple of examples 
using CROCHET. 

TO CROCHET SIZE :ANGLE 

REPEAT 4 [SQUARE SIZE ANGLE RT 90] 

END 




CROCHET 50 10 



CROCHET 50 50 

Using one of the ARCH procedures, let's define a hexagon. We 
know that to draw a hexagon the turtle must turn 60 degrees for each 
corner. So the ARCH. HEX procedure could be defined as follows: 

TO ARCH. HEX :SIZE :ANGLE 

REPEAT 6 [ARCH.SQ :SIZE :ANGLE LT 60] 

END 

To put three hexagons together, we could define another procedure: 

TO HEXES :SIZE ANGLE 

REPEAT 3 [HEX :SIZE :ANGLE RT 120] 

END 




HEXES 55 75 

There's another way to make hexagons. We can put six triangles 
together. Let's define a triangle with ARCH.SQ and then make a hex- 
agon. First the triangle: 

TO TRI :SIZE :ANGLE 

REPEAT 3 [ARCH.SQ :SIZE ANGLE LT 120] 
END

Introducing the newTopo^ world's first personii 



I invented Topo for you— 
whether you think of yourself as 
a programmer, robot hobbyist, 
or futurist." 




NOLAN BUSHNELL 

Founder of Atari and Androhot; 
father of the personal robot 



"A lot of Apple® owners are sure to 
appreciate all that Topo stands for, and 
all the things he can be programmed 
to do. They should get our first 500]' 




robot, available In a limited Signature Edition 



AN EXTENSION OF YOUR 

COMPUTER. AND T^ENT. 
AND IMAGINATION. 
One day, when there is a robot in 
every home, most people will ask them- 
selves, "Wliy didn't I?" 

A few others — mostly today's 
creative programmers and educators — 
wiU say, "I'm glad I did!" 

Androbot invites you to help shape 
technological history by being one of 
the first to own and command Topo, 
the world's first personal robot. 

TOPO CAN WALK. . .T\LK. . . 

SING AND MORE. 
ALL AT YOUR COMMAND. 
You program Topo's movements and 
speed via joystick or keyboard com- 
mands. You teU him what to say to you, 
your family, students, or guests. In 
English, Spanish, Japanese— almost 
any language on earth. 

Movement is programmed on a 
system of degrees and centimeters, 
displayed on your screen. Text-to- 
speech synthesis is adjustable for pitch 
and volume. 

TOPO'S INNER ELECTRONICS 
MAKE HIM VERSATILE 
AND EXPANDABLE. 
Three 8031 microprocessors ser\'e as 
Topo's "brains!' Two industrial-grade 
rechargeable batteries give him energy 
for hours of activity His battery monitor 
provides voltage protection. 

Topo's edge-mounted plug-in card 
cage system contains one board for 
motion control and another for two-way 
communication. 

Six additional slots will accom- 
modate the numerous optional func- 
tions available soon, such as touch

JANUARY 1984 




□ Apple Computer (Cupertino, CA) has an- 
nounced the March debut of a disk drive system 
that will enable Apple U computers to run IBM 
software. The Rana 8086/2 will create Apple 
compatibility with IBM's MS-DOS operating 
system while retaining the ability to run pro- 
grams based upon Apple operating systems. 
The new hardware, a plug-compatible coproc- 
essor and dual disk drive, uses an 8086 micro- 
processor, with a double-sided drive providing 
360K storage per drive. The coprocessor will 
provide 256K memory expandable to 512K. 
The product will be produced by Rana Systems 
(Chatsworth, CA), a manufacturer of Apple- 
compatible disk drives. "The Apple II is an 
open system, so we can take advantage of any 
standard that increases the value of the product 
to its users," said John Cavalier, vice presi- 
dent and general manager of Apple's personal 
computer systems division. 

Apple has recently reversed a long-stated 
position by dropping the dealer price on the Ap- 
ple He by 4.8 percent and the dealer price on the 
Apple He starter system by 11.6 percent. In an 
announcement to dealers made on November 
16, Apple lowered the dealer price of an Apple 
He to $895 from $940, a $45 drop, and the price 
of the basic system, including disk drive, video 
monitor, eighty-column card, and 64K, to 
$1,145 from $1,295, a cut of $150. Apple 
Treasurer Charles Berger said the move was 
triggered by the desire to give dealers greater 
flexibility during the Christmas season. Other 
factors included a desire to spur Apple He sales 
and to make the Apple more competitively 
priced in the wake of IBM's introduction of 
the PCjr. 

Apple also announced a pricing program 
that will allow schools to purchase Apple prod- 
ucts at a 30 percent discount. In addition, if five 
units of the same product are purchased, Apple 
will contribute a sixth unit free. The Apple He 
Starter System will be available at a discounted 
price but is not included in the six-for-five of- 
fer. The program, which is called "Investment 
in Education," began November 1 and will 
continue until February 28, 1984. The discount 
will be available to all U.S. public and private 
schools, from elementary through college lev- 
els. The program covers most Apple hardware 
and software products except the Lisa and its 
software. Apple Computer is also wrapping up 
a holiday promotion that has provided a free 
$1,400 rebate package to everyone who pur- 
chases an Apple He or Apple III computer. The 
promotion, which will end January 15, features 
a package of rebate certificates and premium of- 
fers for more than ninety home and business- 
oriented products produced by Apple and other 
hardware and software developers. The cer- 



tificates range in value from $3 to $100, with 
the total value of the package equaling $1,400. 
To receive rebates, buyers send the certificates 
and proof of purchase to a redemption com- 
pany. Checks are sent directly to purchasers. 
The certificates are valid through July 31 , 1984. 

□ Simon and Schuster (New York, NY) is 
making a foray into the world of personal com- 
puters with two new divisions: electronic pub- 
lishing and computer books. The divisions were 
formed specifically to develop, market, and dis- 
tribute software and books for personal com- 
puters. The electronic publishing division— 
which will publish its own software and distrib- 
ute software developed by other companies- 
has already signed several distribution agree- 
ments including an agreement with The Learn- 
ing Company to publish their entire educational 
software line. Other plans include the develop- 
ment of a game based on Star Trek, a joint effort 
with Henson Associates to develop educational 
games based on the Muppets, and development 
of an adventure game series based on Douglas 
Adams's bestseller. The Hitchhiker's Guide to 
the Galaxy. The division will be headed by 
president Frank Schwartz and vice president 
of sales and distribution Alvin Reuben. In addi- 
tion, James Korenthal has joined the division 
as vice president of technical services. Simon 
and Schuster's book division, which will pub- 
lish A Loving Computer by InfoWorld columnist 
John Dvorak, has scheduled twenty titles for re- 
lease by spring and plans a comparable number 
of new releases each season. The division will 
be headed by publisher and editor-in-chief Rob- 
ert Eckhardt, who was previously senior editor 
of Simon and Schuster's trade division. 

□ CompuServe (Columbus, OH) has an- 
nounced a pilot program that will add advertis- 
ing and direct marketing to the CompuServe 
videotex service. The program, scheduled to 
start this month, will give major advertisers and 
direct marketers their first opportunity to par- 
ticipate in a national test of CompuServe adver- 
tising. "We feel it's time to really test the ad- 
vertising potential of the videotex medium," 
said Jeffrey Wilkins, president and chief ex- 
ecutive officer of CompuServe. "Experiments 
are fine up to a point, but the local experiments 
being carried out in a couple of isolated areas 
around the country are not practical measure- 
ments of videotex advertising on a national 
scale." The pilot program, which will last for 
four months, is designed to test the degree of 
advertising acceptance among CompuServe's 
subscriber^ CompuServe customers can place 
on-line orders for merchandise and specify de- 
livery and payment information through their 
computers. Types of advertising used in the pi- 
lot prograni will include spot advertisements, 



one or two lines of text positioned on select 
menu pages; Adformation, advertiser-sponsored 
databases of in-depth product descriptions; and 
electronic catalogs, databases that identify prod- 
ucts and provide brief descriptions. 

□ Great Plains Software has moved. Their 
new address is 1701 Thirty-eighth Street S.W., 
Fargo, ND 58103. Their new phone number is 
701-281-0550. 

□ Bantam Books (New York, NY) has an- 
nounced the formation of a new division, Ban- 
tam electronic publishing, which will be re- 
sponsible for creating a line of software 
products and developing independent computer 
book-publishing projects. Kenzi Sugihara, 
former director of the electronic publishing 
division at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, has 
joined Bantam as director of the new division. 

□ Susan Goldberg has been appointed vice 
president of Micro Lab (Highland Park, IL) 
and will be responsible for the firm's advertis- 
ing, public relations, and marketing. She 
previously served as corporate secretary and is 
the wife of Stanley Goldberg, Micro Lab's 
founder and president. Micro Lab has also an- 
nounced the formation of MicroHome, a new 
division that will produce software designed for 
home use. The first program in a line of what 
the company terms "lifestyle enhancement prod- 
ucts" will be a word processor. Home Writer. 

□ Steven Goldsworthy has joined Sorcim 
(San Jose, CA) as vice president of engineering. 
In his new post, Goldsworthy will oversee de- 
velopment of the company's software products. 
He previously served ten years at Hewlett- 
Packard, where he was a software engineer and 
research and development manager. 

□ Spinnaker Software (Cambridge, MA) has 
announced that it has received $5 million in 
financing from the Hilman foundation of Pitts- 
burgh and the GE Pension Fund. The proceeds 
of the financing will be used to "expand our 
already aggressive marketing and sales efforts, 
to build up the technological capacity to do 
translations from one computer to another, and 
to fund the working capital demands of a com- 
pany that is growing 25 percent each month," 
said Spinnaker chairman William Bowman. 

□ Larry Dunlap, president of the new video- 
games-via-cable service The Games Network 
(Los Angeles, CA), has announced the appoint- 
ment of David DeJean as chief operating offi- 
cer. DeJean will be primarily responsible for 
financial management of the company but will 
also work in sales and marketing. He previously 
served as director of the Times Mirror Videotex 
Services. 

□ Microsoft (Bellevue, WA) has announced 
the formation of Microsoft Press, a new 
microcomputer book-publishing division. The 



division, which expects to publish thirty to 
thirty-five books in its first year, will have its 
books distributed exclusively by the electronic 
publishing division of Simon and Schuster. The 
new Microsoft division will be headed by gen- 
eral manager and publisher Nahum Stiskin, 
who was formerly president and publisher of 
Autumn Press. 

□ The Great American Software Contest, 
sponsored by Talmis (Oak Park, IL), was can- 
celed due to lack of participation. The contest 
offered programmers the chance to win $30,000 
and was designed to bring together hundreds of 
talented software authors with more than two 
hundred fifty software publishers. Instead, only 
thirty-six programmers responded. Talmis at- 
tributes the contest's failure to a dearth of dedi- 
cated programmers and says they plan to revise 
their projection that the home computer would 
infiltrate nearly 50 percent of American house- 
holds by 1988. "In planning the Great Ameri- 
can Software Contest, we hoped to unearth the 
talented people working in their garages. What 
we learned instead is that the talented people are 
already out of their garages," said Jeanne 
Dietsch, Talmis 's president. 

□ Steve Cochard has been named vice presi- 
dent of Southwestern Data Systems (Santee, 
CA). Cochard was previously an engineering 
supervisor at Bechtel Power Corporation. 

□ Ashton-Tate (Culver City, CA) has an- 
nounced the appointment of Charles Babbitt as 
the firm's executive vice president and chief op- 
erating officer. Babbitt, who will oversee 
Ashton-Tate's operations division, was previ- 
ously with the business services division of 
Computer Sciences Corporation. 

□ Thomas Towers, former VisiCorp market- 
ing vice president, has joined Knoware (Cam- 
bridge, MA) as president and chief executive 
officer. Knoware, an educational software pub- 
lisher, has also announced the appointment of J. 
Robert Hipps as vice president and chief finan- 
cial officer. Hipps previously served as vice 
president and treasurer of General Signal Cor- 
poration. 

□ Monogram, a division of Tronix Publish- 
ing (Inglewood, CA), has hired Frank E. 
Mullin as director of software development. 
Mullin, who designed Tronix's program Dol- 
lars and Sense, previously worked at TRW, 
where he was a project manager with the De- 
fense and Space Systems Group. 

□ Several employees of McTyre-Charles As- 
sociates, a computer advertising and marketing 
firm, caught the entrepreneurial spirit while 
working with their clients and have formed their 
own software publishing company — Magnum 
Software (Chats worth, CA). During coopera- 
tive efforts with Datamost, Sierra On-Line, and 
Quality Software, the employees became fasci- 
nated by computers, said Magnum's president 
Bob McTyre. McTyre and his group raised 
funds for the company and, with the help of Da- 
tamost's Dave Gordon and Sandy Wiviott, lo- 
cated distributors and went into business. So far 
it has been very enjoyable, McTyre says: "I 
started out in TV in the early days and was al- 
most ashamed to take my paycheck, it was so

Educational Software That Works 



We believe that children have an innate 
curiosity ... a natural desire to learn, to 
discover, to understand. Our software was 
designed with this in mind. Even 
traditionally tedious subjects like math, 
reading, and vocabulary building are easily 
mastered. Why? Because our software 
makes children want to learn. And when 
they want to learn, the results are 
FANTASTIC! 

We know our software WORKS because we 
developed and tested it in the classroom. 
Let our software WORK for your children 
too! 

For the Apple and IBM PC*

It's that time of the year again, the time when kids put away their 
holiday gifts and get their little keisters back to school. It's the time of 
the year when we make two- week efforts at keeping New Year's resolu- 
tions before we give them up, telling ourselves that resolutions are for 
the weak-willed. It's also the time of the year when we look back on the 
past year and reflect. 

Hmm. What was the biggest change in our lives? What events made 
the biggest headlines in the news? And what was the best dam piece of 
software that came out in the Apple marketplace? Sure it's important. 
What had a bigger direct effect on our lives last year— a program we 
bought or the launching of a space shuttle? 

While last November's space shuttle mission was a landmark in the 
history of space exploration, the new word processor that simplified life 
one hundred-fold for a writer is more important— to the writer, anyway. 
Such software gems deserve recognition, and that's where you get to 
help. 

For the past three years, Sqftalk readers have voted for their favorite 
programs, and the industry has listened. Business programs, home appli- 
cations, educational software, utilities, and, of course, games. They're 
all eligible to be selected as the most popular program of the year.

JANUARY 1984 



99 



Though the quality of a program (a subjective judgment, to be sure) is 
important to consider when voting, the "best" program isn't necessarily 
the most popular. While someone might use a three hundred-dollar 
spreadsheet wonder program that does everything but fry eggs, that same 
person might rather be playing a cheaply made adventure game. 

So, we're not asking you to vote for what you think were the ten best 
programs released in 1983, but rather for your favorite programs. There 
are spaces on the ballot for you to list your ten favorite programs in order 
of preference. It's important to list them in order, because votes will be 
weighted. That means a program receiving three first-place votes will 
carry more "weight" than a program receiving five tenth-place votes. 
Just because a program receives more votes doesn't mean it will win; 
high rankings also play a part. 

There's another blank on the ballot; it's there for your favorite pro- 
gram of all time. Maybe it'll be the same as your favorite this year; 
maybe not. Maybe it'll be the same one you voted for last year; maybe 
not. Wizardry won last year as the favorite all-time program. Will it take 
the honors again? Or can something unseat the champ? 

In addition to the voting, we're interested in hearing what you think 
about various programs — the dogs as well as the winners. Anybody with 
money can run a flashy ad campaign for a program— including full-color 
magazine ads that sing and dance about why you should buy the pro- 
gram — instead of telling you what it does. Reviews of programs don't al- 
ways do justice to them — good or bad. Sometimes reviewers, in the opi- 
nion of the user, will completely miss the point or be so far off base that 
it looks like they took a bribe. 

Or you may feel that one of your favorites is underrated. Tell us 
which programs you think ought to receive more applause and why. 
Software producers get some of their best input from polls like this. The 
readers speak, and the software makers listen. 

Here's how the voting works. 

Any program released between October 1, 1982, and December 31, 
1983, are eligible for the voting. The reason for the overlap is to include 
programs that were released at the end of 1982 but weren't out long 
enough to be noticed by the consumer marketplace. 

To make things easier for everone, please use the enclosed ballot card 
that's obnoxiously sticking out between these pages. Just fill in your 
choices and drop it in the mailbox, postmarked by February 15, 1984. 

Only one ballot per person can be accepted. If two or more ballots 
with the same votes are sent in by one person, only one will be counted. 
Ballots from the same person with different selections will fly straight 
into the nearest forest fire and be forgotten. Ballot-box stuffers, you have 
been warned! 

If there are two or more persons in your household who want to vote, 
or if some overzealous voter already ripped the ballot from the maga- 
zine, then write your choices on a piece of paper with your name, ad- 
dress, and comments and send it to Softalk Vote, Box 7039, North 
Hollywood, CA 91605, postmarked by February 15, 1984. 

Votes will be counted by a privileged few on the Softalk staff. Nick 
and Bud's Accounting (est. 1983) will supervise to make sure there's no 
cheating (or ballot-box stuffing). The results will be locked safely away 
in Softalk' s safe-deposit cupboard, and the winner will be announced at 
the West Coast Computer Faire, where the author and publisher of the 
winning program will get all dressed up to receive the award for the 
Most Popular Program of 1983. If flying out to San Francisco just to find 
out who won doesn't sound inviting (it should, though), you can always 
read the results in the April issue. 

Any professional software released between October 1, 1982, and 
January 1, 1983, is eligible for your vote. This list, made up of programs 
whose sales were trackable in the past year, is intended only as a memory 
jogger; it is not comprehensive— it's even possible that a package or two 
released before the eligible date could have snuck into the list; others 
may have been unwittingly omitted. Repeat: the programs you vote for 
need not be on this list. The list is only intended to get your memory 
cranking. Have fun reminiscing, and may the best product win!

String Is in the Air 



At the close of last month's installment three exercises were offered 
as a way to sharpen your programming skills and put the principles 
discussed in the column to use. We'll look at two of those exercises here. 
If you did them yourself, your solutions probably won't look exactly like 
the ones shown here. If they work, however, they are probably just as 
good. In fact, they may be better. 

There are several criteria for deciding what solution to a program- 
ming problem is best. It depends on what you need. The most important 
consideration is that it work. After that, it's worthwhile to consider 
whether it works fast enough for your liking, how efficiently it uses 
memory (the easiest measure of this is the program's catalog sector 
count — the number next to its name and file type when you catalog the 
disk), and how easy it is to understand and, if need be, modify. So don't 
worry if your answers don't look like our answers. 

Friday's Child. Let's consider first the suggestion for how the Fri- 
day program from last month might be improved. Load Friday. 2 from 
your Floating Point disk. Here is what it looked like when last we saw it: 

10 DIM ND(12), FF(12) 

20 FOR M = 1 TO 12: READ ND(M): NEXT M 

30 FOR M = 1 TO 12: READ FF(M): NEXT M 

40 FOR M = 1 TO 12 

100 FOR D = FF(M) TO ND(M) STEP 7 

110 PRINT ■■Friday ";M; "/";D; ■'/83" 

120 NEXTD 

125 NEXTM 

130 END 

200 DATA 31 ,28,31 ,30,31 ,30,31 ,31 ,30,31 ,30,31 
210 DATA 7,4,4,1,6,3,1,5,2,7,4,2 



5 YR = 1984: FF = 6 

This will tell the program that the year is 1984 and the first Friday of 
the year is dated the 6th. Those of you who know anything about 
magazine lead times are aware that this article was written well before 
the beginning of the year, before any 1984 calendars were within easy 
reach. (Kindly refrain from pointing out that 1984 calendars were in the 
book and stationery stores as early as last August. Some people like to be 
surprised on Christmas.) 

So how was the first Friday determined? Simple: We just took the 
date of the last Friday of December (30), added the number of days in the 
week (7, for a total of 37), and subtracted the number of days in Decem- 
ber (31, leaving a difference of 6). You may have thought, "Count for- 
ward on a 1983 calendar from the last day of December until your finger 
hits Friday," but can you translate that to Basic? You can figure out the 
first Friday of the year for the computer, but the task at hand is to get the 
program to determine the first Friday of each month after January. Try 
finding an Apple that can read a calendar. 

Math Imitates Life. Now try our way. You will find that after the 
next D in line 120 has fallen through, the value in D will be the date of 
the last Friday of the month plus 7 (the step defined in line 100). Half the 
work is done. Now all we have to do is subtract from D the number of 
days in the previous month. Until we hit line 125, the variable M conven- 
iently will be pointing to the month we need, and we'll have the number 
of days in each month safely recorded in ND(M). So all we need is a line 
like: 

123 FF = D - ND(M) 



Some of you may have a renumbered version with the line numbers 
changed and the data statements following the read statements, based on 
the final exercise with Renumber. We'll be using the numbering from the 
older version, as shown, so if you saved the newer one you'll have to ad- 
just the line numbers used in the example accordingly. 

The Perpetual Calendar. The problem, you may recall, was to 
modily Friday. 2 to calculate the first Friday value (FF) for each month 
instead of reading all the values into an array . This calculation would be 
based on a knowledge of the date of the first Friday of the year and the 
number of days in each month. A crucial consideration, especially this 
year, is that the number of days in February is different in a leap year. 
Fortunately, there's an easy, mathematically oriented way to determine 
whether a given year is a leap year— see if it's evenly divisible by four. 
More on that later. 

Let's start by putting in the necessary information for this year. Add 
this line: 



Exactly like it in fact. Pretty swift, huh? Now let's get rid of the stuff we 
don't need. There's nothing more embarrassing than showing someone 
your major programming opus, having him ask what line 30 does, and 
having to admit that it doesn't do anything but that it was a necessary part 
of the program three versions ago. 

Most of the now obsolete portions of the program deal with the array 
variable FF(12). (Here and in the future we'll refer to an array variable 
by a combination of its name and, in parentheses, either its dimensions or 
its most common index variable. This style will help you distinguish an 
array variable from any simple variables of the same name.) Some 
references to the FF array should be eliminated and some should be re- 
placed with the simple variable FF that we've just introduced in lines 5 
and 123. 

To start with, let's delete lines 30 and 210. These lines used to read 
the data into the FF(12) array. Not anymore. Next, we must change the 
remaining lines that refer to FF(12)— 10 and 100— like so: 



JANUARY 1984 



105 



10 DIM ND(12) 

100 FOR D = FF TO ND(M) STEP 7 

Finally, line 1 10 should be changed to reflect the fact that the year is 
now also a variable: 

110 PRINT "Friday "; M; '7"; D; '7"; YR 

Now the only problem with the program is that February has twenty- 
nine days this year, not twenty-eight. This brings us back to our defini- 
tion of a leap year, which states that a year is a leap year if it is evenly 
divisible by four. This is another case of learning to think about familiar 
concepts in mathematical terms. You don't have to be a mathematician to 
do this; you just have to think a little. What does "evenly divisible by 
four" mean? Consider the following examples: 

10/4 = 2.5 11/4 = 2.75 12/4 = 3 13/4 = 3.25 

Which of the numbers from 10 through 13 is "evenly divisible by 4?" 
The answer is 12, since 12 divided by 4 equals 3. No decimal point. The 
mathematical word for a number with no decimal places is an integer. 
Now you may recall from two months ago that we have a function we can 
use to turn a number into an integer: INT. Can we use this to our advan- 
tage? Sure thing— try this out in your head, with N equal to the numbers 
from 10 through 13: 

IF N/4 = INT (N/4) THEN... 

Which number will pass that test? You guessed it: 12, because twelve is 
evenly divisible by four. 

Now that we have our test, we'll include it in the program so it will 
set the number of days in February equal to twenty-nine if it's a leap 
year. In Basic, that would be: 

30 IF YR/4 = INT (YR/4) THEN ND(2) = 29 

Adding this new line won't change the data in the data statement. 
There's no need to do that. What it will change is the data that has been 
read into the ND(12) array by line 20, which is why we put the test for a 
leap year in line 30. 

There you have it. The program now looks like this: 

5 YR = 1984: FF = 6 
10 DIM ND(12) 

20 FOR M = 1 TO 12: READ ND(M): NEXT M 

30 IF YR/4 = INT (YR/4) THEN ND(2) = 29 

40 FOR M = 1 TO 12 

100 FOR D = FF TO ND(M) STEP 7 

110 PRINT ■■Friday "; M; ■■/"; D; ■■/"; YR 

120 NEXTD 

123 FF = D - ND(M) 

125 NEXTM 

130 END 

200 DATA 31 ,28,31 ,30,31 ,30,31 ,31 ,30,31 ,30,31 

This revised program will give an accurate list of the Fridays in any 
year (unless they change the calendar on us), provided you give it correct 
data for the year and the first Friday of the year in line 5. Save this pro- 
gram as Friday. 3. 

The First Sign of Strings. The other problem from last month that 
we'll discuss now is the bubble sort routine. But first we'll look at some- 
thing more interesting to sort than an array of random numbers: an array 
of words. We've hinted tantalizingly at the existence of string variables; 
here we'll begin to look at some solid facts. 

In an earlier column, we defined a string as a series of characters 
or as a series of characters between quotes. Both definitions are ac- 
curate—consider the following one-liner: 

100 PRINT ■■This is a string." 

As you can see, in this context the characters we refer to as a string are 
indeed between quotes. When you run this program, however, you will 
find that the string will be printed on the screen without the quotes. The 
quotes are what are known as delimiters: They serve to separate strings 
from commands. Delimiters are used primarily when you are giving the 
computer information, such as a string, in a line of Basic. When the com- 
puter gives you back information in the form of a string, it will rarely be 
surrounded by delimiters. 



Certain other characters are sometimes used as delimiters. In the data 
line (line 200) of the Friday program, for instance, each piece of data is 
delimited by commas. In this case, it isn't necessary to surround each 
item with a pair of commas, just individual adjacent items. In a way, the 
word data and the return you typed at the end of the line serve as the 
beginning and ending delimiters. 

A string variable is a variable that can hold a series of characters in- 
stead of a number. It is named by the same rules as those that govern 
naming a numeric variable except that the name always ends with a dol- 
lar sign, which in this case is usually pronounced string. So A$ would be 
pronounced A-string and NAMES would be pronounced name-string. 
The basic string variable assignment command functions as the simplest 
form of the numeric variable assignment: 

100 LET NAMES = '■Fred Flintstone" 

where the let is optional. A string can be as long as 255 characters. 

Like numbers, strings can be added together. This isn't like adding 
two numbers together, although the statements look alike. What actually 
happens when strings are added to each other is that one is concatenated, 
or linked, onto the other. It's like attaching two Lego bricks together. 
Add these lines after line 100 above, run the program, and see what 
happens: 

110 TITLES = "Mr. " 

120 PRINT TITLES + NAMES 

130 NAMES = TITLES + NAMES + '■, esq." 

140 PRINT NAMES 

150 END 

As you can see, strings can be added together in print statements or 
assignment statements. In a print statement the plus sign between two 
strings acts like a semicolon, causing the two strings to be printed right 
next to each other. You can also use a semicolon in such a case, or you 
can use a comma to make the strings tab into the three preset columns on 
the Apple text screen. Notice the space following the period in the string 
in line 1 10. This space becomes part of the string so that when Mr. and 
Fred Flintstone are concatenated, there will be a space between them. 

String variables can be used in many of the same situations in which 
numeric variables can be used. As we've seen, you can add them 
together (after a fashion) and print them. No other arithmetic operations 
can be performed on them, but there is a whole slew of specialized string 
functions for reading part of a string, counting the characters in a string, 
changing numbers to strings and back again, and converting strings into 
the actual codes used to represent them inside the computer. We'll look 
at those next month. For now, let's concentrate on how the things you 
already know apply to strings. 

You can input a string variable just as you would input a numeric one. 
For instance: 

100 INPUT '■Type your full name: "; NAMES 

The user doesn't need to put the string between quotes when answering 
the prompt. By the way, although "Type your full name: " is in quotes 
in this example, you can't replace it with a string variable like so: 

100 PROMPTS = "Type your full name: " 
105 INPUT PROMPTS; NAMES 

In this situation, Applesoft wouldn't print out PROMPTS in line 105. It 
would allow you to type in a string, but it would assign it to the variable 
PROMPTS, not to NAMES. Then there would be a syntax error when it 
tried to handle the semicolon. 

A program can ask for two strings in one statement, but the names of 
the strings must be separated by a comma, not a semicolon, like so: 

105 INPUT PROMPTS, NAMES 

The user must respond to this request by supplying two strings separated 
by a comma; otherwise, the computer will ask for more by prompting 
with two question marks. 

This brings us to a limitation on entering strings through the input 
statement; in a response to an input prompt commas can't be part of the 
string because the comma says to the input statement, "That's all for this 
string, now here comes another one." For example, with this input: 

100 INPUT "Enter your name— last name first: "; NAMES 



106 



WUTALI/ 



JANUARY 1984 



if the user types: 
Flintstone, Fred 

the computer will respond "extra ignored" and put only "Flintstone" 
into NAMES. 

By the way, if a program asks for numeric input and the user types a 
string, Applesoft will prompt for the data to be reentered. Nevertheless, 
it's always a good idea when using the input command to use a prompt 
that makes clear the kind of input expected. 

Strings of Great Value. What else can string variables be used for? 
Well, they can't be used as the index for a for-next loop or an array var- 
iable. They can be put into an array, however, and they can be compared 
with one another in an if-then statement. And all of the relational opera- 
tors work: = , <, >, ><, <=, and > = . So how do you tell if "as- 
paragus" is greater than "eggplant"? Obviously, the computer can't 
make a value judgment, but it can determine alphabetic sequence. And 
that leads us to our sorting routine. 

But first we need to make the list of things to sort. This routine allows 
the user to enter as many as twenty words. That maximum isn't hard and 
fast: If you type in 50 every place in the program where it says 20 (lines 
10, 20, and 40), you'll have upped the limit to fifty. (Note: Don't change 
the line number in line 20.) 

10 HOME : DIM W$(20):NW = 20 

20 FOR N = 1 TO 20 

30 INPUT W$(N) 

40 IF W$(N) = "" THEN NW = N - 1 :N = 20 

50 NEXT N: PRINT 

60 PRINT NW;" WORDS ENTERED.": PRINT 

The input loop is structured so that the user can break out of it at any 
time by hitting return to signal to the program that the list is completed. 
When you simply hit return as a response to a string input, the string 
created is empty (this is called a null string), and it can be tested for with 
a pair of empty quote marks, as shown in line 40. Notice that there must 
be no space between those quote marks; "" and " " are two different 
things to Applesoft.

The variable NW stands for number of words. When we get out of 
the input loop we want to be sure that NW equals the number of words in 
the array W$(N). In line 40 NW is set to N — 1 because the last string 
entered (the Nth string), the null, doesn't count. If a full twenty words 
are entered, line 40 will never be executed, so NW will still be 20, as it 
was preset in line 10. 

N is set to 20 in line 40 so the program can get out of the loop legally 
if the user hits return. It would have been possible to exit the loop with a 
goto 60 in the same place as the N = 20, but that's a bad way to exit 
loops. Under some circumstances it could lead to mysterious out-of- 
memory errors. 

Rethinking For-Next. Resetting the index variable in the middle of 
the loop is perfectly acceptable, however. The statement forX = 1 to 10 
does not require that the loop be executed ten times; it merely states that 
X is incremented each time and that the loop will not be exited until X is 
greater than 10. 

Line 60 verifies for us that the word count is correct. 

Just to be sure that the list is where we expect it to be, let's "play it 
back." This task requires a much simpler loop: 

70 FOR N = 1 TO NW 
80 PRINT W$(N) 
90 NEXT N: PRINT 

Now we want to sort the list. The algorithm for a bubble sort, along 
with a detailed flow chart, was presented in the first installment of this 
column last September. Here's a brief recap: 

Starting with the first item on the list, W$(l), and continuing through 
the next to last, we compare each item with the item that follows it. We 
want the item with the least value (that is, the earliest item in alphabetical 
order) to head the list and the rest of the items to follow in ascending 
order. If in comparing adjacent items we find a lower numbered item 
with a greater value than a higher numbered item— if W$(N) > W$(N + 
1) — then we swap the values of the two items. 

Capture the Flag. If upon the completion of a pass through the list 
no swaps have been made, we know that the list is in the correctly sorted 
order. Only when we can do one full pass without having to swap any- 
thing do we know for sure that the list has been sorted. If any swaps have 
been made, we can't be sure that the list has been sorted, so we must go 
through the list again. 

You may wonder how the computer is supposed to know if swaps 
have been made. Of course it can't know unless we tell it. Applesoft has 
no intrinsic way of checking to see if any if-then condition was true or 
false the last few times through, so we use a flag. 

A flag in Applesoft is just a variable used to indicate that something 
happened or didn't happen. Usually, it has one of two possible values: 1 
or 0. By standard conventions, a value of zero means that the condition 
or event being checked for didn't happen; a value of one means it did. 

Practically, this means that we set the variable, which we'll call 
FLAG for instant recognition, to 0 at the beginning of the loop. If the if- 
test passes, part of the result of that test will be to set FLAG to 1 . FLAG 
may be set to 1 many times during the execution of a loop. It doesn't mat- 
ter if one or ten swaps are made, FLAG will still equal 1 when we come 
out the other end. 

But you can see all this for yourself Here's the routine: pay special 
attention to how FLAG operates in lines 110, 130, and 150. 



100 REM SORT THE LIST 

110 FLAG = 0 

120 FOR N = 1 TO NW - 1 

130 IF W$(N) > W$(N + 1) THEN FLAG 
W$(N):W$(N) = W$(N + 1):W$(N + 

140 NEXTN 

150 IF FLAG = 1 THEN 110 



1:TEMP$ = 
= TEMPS 



The other variable of somewhat obscure purpose in this routine is 
TEMPS. Since there is no command in Applesoft to swap the values of 
two variables (there is a swap command in some other dialects of Basic), 
we first save the value of one of the variables in TEMPS, let that variable 
equal the other variable, and then put the value of TEMPS into the other 
variable. It's as if you had two jars, one containing vinegar and the other 
containing turpentine, and you wanted to put the vinegar in the mrpentine 
jar and the turpentine in the vinegar jar without mixing the liquids. The 
only way you can do it is to pour one of the liquids into a third container

first. Like FLAG, TEMP$ isn't a special command or reserved word, 
it's just a conveniently named variable used for temporary storage. 

What's in a Name? You can make up these convenient variable 
names yourself, but you have to be aware of two things. The first is that 
a variable name can't be a command name, nor may it contain any com- 
mand names. Even though you don't know all the command names yet, 
there is an easy way to test whether a variable name contains a command: 
Type it into a line and then list the line. If you tried to use the word to- 
morrow as a variable name in a for-next loop, it would look like this 
when you listed it: 

500 FOR TO M OR ROW = 1 TO 10 

To and or are reserved words— that is, words that Applesoft reserves 
for command names— so you would have to think up some other name 
for your variable. 

The second thing to consider is that Applesoft recognizes only the 
first two characters in a variable's name. This means you can't name a 
variable MOTHER and another variable MOVE in the same program. 
You can, however, have an MO and an MO$; string variables are never 
mistaken for numeric variables in Applesoft. 

All the program has to do now is show us the sorted list. This is the 
only real way we can be sure the sort routine works. Just repeat the print 
routine shown earlier, this time assigning higher line numbers. 

160 REM PRINT THE SORTED LIST 
170 FOR N = 1 TO NW 
180 PRINT W$(N) 
190 NEXTN 

There are ways to avoid having identical lines appear twice in the 
same program. For instance, you can omit these last lines and enter: 

160 GOTO 70 

instead. But now we're in an infinite loop, because after printing the 
sorted list the program will feel compelled to sort it again and again 
because of the unconditional goto. How about if we use one of those flag 
variables to tell the program that we've already sorted the list and that 
we're finished? Try this: 

95 IF F1 = 1 THEN END 
160 F1 = 1: GOTO 70 

omitting lines 170 through 190. 

Programming with Pasta. This previous approach will work, but be 
warned that it leads to madness. This kind of programming logic is called 
spaghetti logic because it tends to develop very tangled loops. The pro- 
gram is okay now, but after a few more changes like this, you won't be 
able to keep track of which variable means what. This makes it hard to 
find bugs. Next month we'll go into a nice, structured way to call the 
same routine from different places in the program. Save this program as 
Sort. 1 so you'll have something to work with next time. JM 



GLOSSARY 

Concatenate: To put together. With strings, to add two strings is 
to concatenate one string to the end of the other. 

Delimiter: A marker that separates things. The standard string de- 
limiter is the quotation mark, which appears at both ends of 
strings that appear in Applesoft programs. The standard data 
delimiter is the comma, which must only appear between two 
elements of data. This convention is used with both strings and 
numbers in data statements and in user response to input state- 
ments. 

Flag: A variable used to indicate that a certain event happened or 
didn't happen. Usually, a value of zero indicates that the event 
didn't happen and a value of one indicates that it did. 

Null string: An empty string; a string containing no characters. 
This is the normal starting condition of a string variable. It can 
also come about when a string input statement receives only a 
return or in an assignment statement like A$ = "" with noth- 
ing between the quotes. 

Reserved word: Any of the words that Applesoft reserves for ex- 
clusive use as command names. These words may not be used 
in or as part of names of variables.

Bridging the Communications Gap, Part One 



Okay, we brought the personal computer home, plugged it in, 
whizzed through the Apple Presents . . . Apple disk, and learned to use 
various applications programs. Financial modeling, checkbook balanc- 
ing, and word processing are somewhat easier (or harder) now that we 
have an Apple to help (or hinder) us . 

Next, we got a modem and connected ourselves to the telephone 
lines, opening up a whole new world. Why, now it's possible to use the 
company computer at work from the privacy of home. We can even ex- 
change programs, text files, VisiCalc DIF files, and so on with offices in 
different parts of the country. 

Unfortunately, it's not that simple. 

Communication protocol must be established before two machines 
can talk with each other. We've already looked at terminal programs and 
how they work. This time, we'll define some more terms, look at why 
some computers can't exchange information, and finally, consider a 
possible solution to that communication barrier. 

Etiquetteman to the Rescue. Part of communication protocol in- 
volves setting up rules about which computer says what to whom, when, 
and how. The same rules exist in human communication. For instance, 
it's a generally understood rule that if two people are talking, each 
should take turns and not interrupt the other. 

In a classroom situation the accepted behavior is that students 
shouldn't talk unless called on by the teacher. These kinds of rules are set 
up to avoid the possible confusion that could arise if more than one per- 
son were to speak at a time. 

In telecommunications, the rules are stricter, since any deviation 
from standard behavior is sure to confuse things. A prime example is the 
mess that ace newspaper reporter Scoop Cromwell got himself into last 
week. Scoop was on assignment in Idaho covering the Late Great Potato 
Bash. When he got his story, he went back to his hotel room, typed it up 
on his Apple, and got ready to transmit the story by modem. 

(The paper Scoop works for doesn't have the facilities to receive his 
story, so the plan was that he would send it to Lois, who has an Apple at 
home, and she would take the story down to the newspaper.) 

He dialed the telephone. It answered. He used the transmit command 
of his terminal program to send his text file. Scoop could see the text 
print across his screen as it was being transmitted, so he assumed 
everything was going hunky-dory. 

After the file had finished transmitting, he called Lois to make sure it 
all got there. She told him that either he was a horrible typist or else the 
file got scrambled along the way. Scoop tried to resend the file, but the 



results were the same: Everything on the receiving end was garbage. 
Uh-oh. 

Scoop examined the phone line connection to make sure it was 
secure. He then asked Lois if her Apple was working properly. He 
checked the power cord on his own machine, he checked the phone line 
for excessive static, and he checked the test file for discrepancies. It 
dawned on Scoop how many imaginary problems there can be when one 
really hasn't the faintest idea what the real problem is. He finally gave up 
and dictated the story to Lois, who was no good at shorthand. 

Let's take a look at what could have gone wrong. 

If we were to grab a chunk of computer data being sent over the 
phone, the bits would look something like this: 

001010010111011110010011001000101 

and would not make very much sense even to the computer. But wait! 
Computers communicate over the phone in bits, which are represented 
by Is and Os, don't they? Sure do. And those are Is and Os, aren't they? 
Sure are. So what's the problem? 

The problem is that the computer sees this string of bits the same way 
we see something like WImtsthatinfheroadahead. Without proper spacing 
and punctuation, we might interpret the sentence as What's that in the 
road ahead? or as Miat's that in the road? A head? The difference in 
meanings is clear, which is why punctuation (or intonation when we 
speak) is so important. 

A Bit of Variety. Within the Apple, eight bits is a byte. No more, no 
fewer. But when the Apple starts talking to other computers by phone, 
the number of bits in a byte can vary, because the eighth bit isn't as im- 
portant when data moves through telephone lines as it is when informa- 
tion is traveling around inside the computer. (Remember, it takes only 
seven bits to create a character. The eighth bit is used by the Apple to 
define how the character is displayed on the screen; in communications, 
the eighth bit doesn't matter.) 

So, bytes en route from one computer to another can be of seven or 
eight bits in length. Right away, it's easy to see one of the problems 
Scoop had with his data transmission. If his Apple is configured to send 
seven-bit bytes, the capital letter A will be represented as 1000001, 
which equals sixty-five in binary (sixty-five is the ASCII code for the 
capital letter A). In eight-bit form, A would be 01000001, which still 
equals sixty-five, but with an extra zero in front. 

Lois, on the other hand, might have her Apple set up to recognize 
eight-bit bytes. Thus, if Scoop's Apple wants to send the word Idaho, it 



JANUARY 1984 SQPTALK^ 109 



sends the following seven-bit bytes, each of which stands for a letter in 
the word: 

1001001 1100100 1100001 1101000 1101111. 

The Apple, not knowing and not caring where one byte ends and the next 
one begins, will transmit Idaho as one string of bits, like this: 

1 001 001 1 1 001 001 1 00001 1 1 01 0001 1 01 1 1 1 . 

No problem so far. But when Lois's Apple receives them, it reads the 
string eight bits at a time: 

10010011 10010011 00001110 10001101 111 

(The final three bits represent the first three bits in the next byte.) 

Obviously, the combinations that result are not the same. In fact, on 
Lois's Apple, those eight-bit bytes translate as control-S, control-S, 
control-N, and control-M, all of which are invisible. So, one of the first 
things computers have to agree on is the number of bits per byte. 

Here It Comes, There It Goes. Another source of confusion could 
lie in stop and start bits. A start bit, usually 0, tells the receiving com- 
puter that the following bits (seven or eight, depending on the configura- 
tion) form an ASCII character. After that character is sent, one or more 
stop bits may be sent to indicate the end of that character before the 
beginning of the next. Stop and start bits act like spaces between the 
words on this page or like a good, strong ahem before the beginning of a 
speech. 

Sometimes an extra bit is added to a seven-bit character for the pur- 
pose of detecting errors. This is called a parity bit. Systems can be set up 
to use even or odd parity for error detection. In odd parity, the sending 
computer counts the number of Is in an ASCII character. The ASCII 
character A, represented by the byte 1000001, has two Is in it. If there 
isn't an odd number of Is, then a parity bit equal to 1 is tacked on the end 
of the character, making the number of Is odd. If, when the character ar- 
rives at the receiving end, it has an even number of Is, there has been an 
error during the transmission. 

The same goes for even parity; if the number of Is in the character is 
odd, an extra bit equal to 1 is slapped on to make an even total. 

This method of error detection is not foolproof, though. Suppose 
we're using odd parity; if two bits in a character are changed, the number 
of Is will still be odd when it reaches the other end, and the receiving 
system will assume the character has arrived intact when it really hasn't. 
The same goes for even parity— if two or even four bits are changed, the 
number of Is in the byte will still be even. 

It's not hard to eliminate all this confusion about the number of bits, 
odd or even parity, and start and stop bits. Most terminal programs pro- 
vide options to configure your system the way you like it, or to conform 
to another system's setup. Thus, system mismatching, like Scoop and 
Lois's situation, isn't a big problem (a cursory glance at the program's 
documentation later told Scoop what he was doing wrong, and Lois 
kicked him for being unprepared). 

More Headaches. The real problem in computer communications 
has always been the inability of dissimilar computers to communicate 
with each other. Setting up two Apples with the same terminal programs 
running on each end makes file transfer a breeze. But what if we're 
working with an Apple at home, and the company computer is an IBM 
Personal Computer? 

These two machines have different microprocessors and different 
operating systems. In short, they don't speak the same language. Even if 
both machines are running their respective versions of the same terminal 
program, verified file transfer is still impossible because the computers 
are different. 

At a lesser extreme, suppose that the company you work for finally 
buckles under pressure and trades the IBM for an Apple with CP/M. 
Unless the Apple at home also has CP/M, the two Apples still can't ex- 
change information even though they're both Apples, because the 
operating systems are different. What to do? 

Until now, there wasn't anything that anybody could do. If Fudd Cor- 
poration's Chicago branch needs to send sales forecasts to Fudd's 
Poughkeepsie branch, modem transmission seems the way to go. But if 
Chicago is using an Apple while Poughkeepsie is using an IBM, then the 
only way to send the information is through an express delivery service 
of some kind. You just can't force an Apple to exchange information 
with an IBM. 



Now, there is a solution. 

Entering a New Era. Imagine the most perfect communications 
package. It includes a modem, telephone connection, and communica- 
tions software. Not only that, but the software allows you to exchange 
files with computers that are different from yours. This solves the prob- 
lem Fudd encountered. Now, the two offices can swap information, even 
though their computers are virtually foreign to each other. 

This is Era 2. 

Appropriately named. Era 2 is a package from Microcom that could 
be part of the biggest step in computer communications since the in- 
troduction of the modem. The modem allowed computers to talk to each 
other; Era 2 allows them to exchange more than just text information. 
And it does so error-free. 

Era 2 consists of communications software, a 1200-baud two-board 
modem, documentation, and a telephone cord. That's not much more 
than most communications packages consist of, but it's the details that 
make the difference. 

First, the 1200-baud modem plugs inside the Apple. That's right— no 
bulky modem sitting on the desk; it all fits inside. 

Second, the software lets the Apple communicate with another Apple 
or with any other microcomputer that uses the same protocol as Era 2 
(more on this protocol in a bit). 

Third, you can use Era 2 to make your Apple "look" like a main- 
frame terminal to remote mainframes. 

Fourth, the price is good. The total cost of the package is $429. When 
you consider that most 1 10/300-baud modems cost between two hundred 
and four hundred dollars, and that most 1200-baud modems are in the 
neighborhood of seven hundred and nine hundred dollars, $429 isn't 
such a bad deal. And the price includes the software. 

What's the catch? At press time. Era 2 wasn't available, but we will 
scrutinize the package in a few months. For now, let's look at what it's 
supposed to do. 

Era 2 is compatible with Bell 212A or 103, both of which are almost 
standard in the microcomputer world. It's certified by the FCC and can 
accommodate full or half duplex transmission. It provides auto-answer, 
pulse, or tone dialing. So far, it looks like any other system. Now for the 
differences. 

To begin with, three of the most popular mainframe terminals are the 
DEC VT52, DEC VTIOO, and the IBM 3101. Era 2 lets the microcom- 
puter behave like any of them. 

Next, remember the problem with Fudd Corporation? That's no 
longer a problem. Era 2 will be available for the Apple lie and IBM PC, 
XT, and PC;> computers. Don't be surprised if it also becomes available 
for other, yet-to-be-developed computers. That includes 68000-based 
computers from Apple, if you know what we mean. 

Keys to the Era. What makes Era 2 work is the Microcom Network- 
ing Protocol (MNP), around which Era 2's software is based. A logical 
conclusion would be that a computer using Era 2 software will function 
only with other systems equipped with software using the same protocol, 
MNP. (After all, that's the key to error-free file transfer. An Apple 
that's using ASCII Express: The Professional will perform verified file 
transfer only with another Apple that's also using the same terminal 
program.) 

Such a conclusion is not entirely correct. Era 2's software does per- 
mit file transfer between computers, as other terminal programs do. But 
only if both systems are using Era 2 can files be transmitted in virmal 
format— which we'll get to shortly — with data transparency (text or 
binary files), flow control of information, and error correction. Well 
now, other than the fact that we have Apples talking with IBMs and other 
microcomputers, nothing about Era 2 seems like too big a breakthrough. 
So far. 

MNP is already being used in several of Microcom's modems; the 
1200-baud modem that comes with Era 2 is no exception. Currently, Era 
2 is a package deal— you can't buy the modem or the software 
separately — because right now, the Era 2 software works only with the 
Era 2 modem. This might change, however, according to Microcom. 

If Microcom is the only company that incorporates MNP in its soft- 
ware, there doesn't seem to be much reason for excitement. 

The news is that Microcom isn't the only company using MNP. Far 
from it. 

In July 1983, Microcom decided to take a big step toward setting 
some sort of standard in the telecommunications world. It began licens- 



110 ^ S 1^ T A L K JANUARY 1984 



ing MNP to outside software developers to incorporate into their own 
software. You might recognize some of the companies who signed up 
right away: Apple Computer, VisiCorp, Lotus Development, Dow Jones 
Information Services, GTE Telenet, MCI Communications, and British 
Telecom (Great Britain's version of AT&T). This isn't just some pass 
ing fancy. 

VisiCorp is incorporating MNP in its VisiOn software, Lotus 
Development's 1-2-3 will include it, and GTE's plans are to make MNP 
part of its Telenet network system. The outlook for retailers seems 
positive. If software publishers add MNP to their products, it won't mat- 
ter what computer a person owns; the software will still run on that 
computer. 

So, if MNP is such a great thing, where has it been all these years? 
Actually, MNP has been available to Apple III and TRS-80 Model 3 
users for quite some time in the form of Micro/Courier, Microcom's 
electronic mail program marketed by Apple and Radio Shack for their 
respective computers. For Apple He and IBM PC, XT, and VCjr owners. 
Era 2 is available. IBM customers can also purchase the Personal Com- 
munications Manager, an MNP-based electronic mail package marketed 
by IBM. This means that an Apple lie running Era 2's software can 
exchange files with an Apple HI or TRS-80 Model 3 running Micro/ 
Courier, or with an IBM using Era 2 or the Personal Communica- 
tions Manager. 

Whether you have the desire to communicate with any of these other 
machines isn't the point. The point is that it's possible. Let's take a look 
at how MNP works. 

The Incredible MNP of All Trades. In a capsule, this is what MNP 
is about: 

It can be used on any existing microcomputer system. It's also flexi- 
ble enough to accommodate microcomputers that have yet to be de- 
veloped. 

MNP is independent of any microprocessor, personal computer, or 
operating system. For example, a 6502-based computer running DOS 
can exchange files with a 68000-based or 8088-based computer that's 
running CP/M, Pascal, or the Unix operating system, or any combina- 
tion of microprocessor and operating system. 

Communication can be synchronous or asynchronous. Various baud 
rates can be used, and communication can take place on leased or dial-up 
lines or in local-area networks, such as within a single office. 

MNP is structured so that improvements can be made, and the newer 
version won't prove imcompatible with earlier versions. 

Now let's consider each of these elements in a little more detail. 

Any Computer? The best way to illustrate how MNP fits into the 
scheme of things is to imagine an English-speaking person trying to talk 
to a person who speaks Lishneg, an imaginary language that is sort of 
like English, except that everything is sideways. For example, the 
sentence Give the bone to the dog would translate into Lishneg as Nebo 
teh vegi to dog teh (Bone the give to dog the) . 

Not only are some of the words scrambled, but the structure of the 
sentence is altered as well. In the Lishneg version, the direct object (the 
bone) comes first, followed by the verb (give), with the indirect object 
(the dog) at the end. In this case, the preposition (to) is in the same place. 
Computers have similar differences among them. Sometimes the dif- 
ferences are small, other times vast. 

Now imagine a translator facilitating the communication between the 
two people. Unlike a dictionary, which translates words of one language 
into words of another, this translator translates ideas from one language 
to another. The difference is that a dictionary indicates what each word 
means; it's up to the person reading the dictionary to figure out what the 
entire sentence (idea) means, even though the grammatical structure may 
be different. 

In our example, the Lishneg speaker would look up Give the bone to 
the dog and come up with Vegi teh nebo to teh dog. which means nothing 
in Lishneg. Going the other way, the English speaker would translate the 
Lishneg sentence as Bone the give to dog the. What a mess. 

Here's where the translator comes in. The translator takes the English 
sentence, changes it into the image of a person handing a bone to a dog, 
and then changes that image into Lishneg words that express the idea. 
Let's call this a virtual translation. 

Virtual translation breaks a sentence down to its bare bones and 
transforms it into a sentence using different words and different formats. 
In a sense, virtual translation translates ideas and emotions, rather than 



the words that express them. 

To see how this applies to MNP, replace the English and Lishneg 
speakers with Apple and IBM computers, and replace the translator with 
MNP. Microcom describes the communication between machines as 
"exchanging files using a virtual file format," which is similar to the 
translation of ideas instead of words. 

Because MNP translates files in a virtual format, it is able to work 
between any two microcomputers, no matter how different they are. 
Just as the English-Lishneg translator doesn't have either of the two 
languages as a native tongue, MNP wasn't "raised" under the rules of 
any one microprocessor, computer, or operating system— it's indepen- 
dent. MNP favors no computer over another; it translates files. Period. 

Future Computers? Now wait a minute, how can we be sure MNP 
will work on computers that haven't been developed yet? Well, we can't, 
but Microcom seems to think it will. The company's confident that MNP 
will accommodate future machines because of the way it's structured. 

MNP is based on the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, 
which is something like a multistory building. The OSI model consists of 
seven layers, each of which supports the layer above it but can work in- 
dependently of the others. MNP has only four layers, three of which cor- 
respond directly to OSI and one that incorporates two of OSI's layers. 
Two of OSI's seven layers aren't currently present in MNP. 

In MNP, the first layer's function is to handle the connection and 
disconnection between systems. The second layer guarantees accurate 
data transfer for the layers above it. Data can be sent in blocks for file 
transfer or in a stream, which provides an interactive link to public net- 
works such as the GTE Telenet. 

The third and fourth layers of OSI provide network functions, which 
aren't needed in MNP yet, since MNP is currently for communications 
between two computers only. However, these two layers can be added to 
MNP if necessary in the future. 

MNP's layer three (OSI's layer five) determines whether translation 
services are needed. If the setup consists of identical systems, no 
translator is needed. For dissimilar machines or systems, MNP brings in 
the concept of virtual files that we discussed earlier. To personify, it's at 
this level that MNP pokes its head in the door to ask if the com- 
municating systems need something to help them talk to each other. 

In the case where a translator is needed, MNP translates the original 
file into a virtual file before it is sent. When the file reaches the receiving 
end, it is translated from the virtual format into the format the receiving 
computer requires. 

Translations, then, are done at each end, which is why microcom- 
puters that haven't yet been developed can be added to a network without 
changing the way MNP affects existing computers. 

The fourth layer of MNP (OSI's seventh layer) is the application 
layer. This one handles the actual file transfer between systems. 

Interior Decorating. The layered structure of MNP means that 
changes can be made to individual layers without changing the overall 
structure of MNP. It's sort of like remodeling a floor of a multistory 
building; changing the furniture around or adding new furniture can 
enhance a floor, while the floors above and below it remain unaffected. 

In a similar fashion, layers can be added without adverse effects. If 
Microcom decides to add layers in the future, then the earlier versions of 
MNP will still be able to work with the newer versions that have more 
layers; this is because everything in the earlier versions still exists in the 
newer ones. 

But Will It Sing? Though MNP has already been endorsed by Apple, 
VisiCorp, Lotus, and other industry giants, its success as a standard re- 
mains to be seen. We should note that the use of a Microcom modem is 
not required to exchange files error-free between dissimilar systems; 
MNP, not the modem, is what makes it possible for different kinds of 
computers to communicate. Thus, whether you have a Hayes, Novation, 
Microcom, Universal Data, or Fudd modem makes no difference. 

Microcom isn't the only company trying to make the telecommunica- 
tions and microcomputer industries walk its way. 

Imagine a file transfer program that allows dissimilar computers to 
exchange files error-free, as Era 2's software does. Now imagine such a 
file transfer program working on Apple, IBM, DEC, Texas Instruments, 
Hewlett-Packard, Kaypro, Altos, Burroughs, Sperry Univac, and more 
than thirty other computers. Wouldn't that be a blast? 

Blast (blocked a5-ynchronous fransmission) is a new communications 
package that does all this. Stay tuned.

Breaking the 
Floppy Barrier- 



An Introduction to Apple's ProDOS 



By TOh WEISUAAI^ 



The Apple n is, above all else, flexible. It rides the space shuttle and 
it plays arcade games. It talks to other computers, big and small; it con- 
trols industrial machinery; it helps first-graders learn. 

Along with its flexibility, the Apple has plenty of power for applica- 
tions such as word processing and financial modeling. And since all its 
power is dedicated to a single user, the Apple's response time is usually 
faster than that of larger, multiuser computers. 

More powerful than a locomotive, faster than a speeding bullet, able 
to leap tall competitors in a single bound ... is there anything an Apple 
II can't do? 

Wei!, there used to be. And it was a major weakness. The first thing 
most people expect from a computer is the ability to organize large 
amounts of data. But keeping even moderately sized inventory, mailing 
list, or accounting files on an Apple has always been very difficult. 

Apple Crates. The Apple II, remember, was born in a garage. Its 
designers' primary goal was to develop a computer that individual people 
could afford to own; one of the things they clearly could not afford in 
1976 was high-capacity computer storage devices. Thus, the primary 
storage device used with early Apples was the cassette tape recorder. 

Later, the built-in flexibility of the Apple was called upon to support 
floppy disks. A disk operating system was developed, modified a few 
times, and ultimately named Apple DOS 3.3. In short order it became the 



most widely used disk operating system in the world. 

DOS 3.3 was optimized for 5 '/4 -inch, single-sided floppy disks and 
for individual, nonprofessional computer users. It remains the best disk 
operating system anywhere for computer systems using one floppy 
drive. 

But the fimes, they keep a-changin'. Nowadays, high-capacity disk 
drives are no novelty. And nowadays, using ProDOS, the Apple II's 
newest disk operating system, the flexible little Apple can quickly and 
easily handle files containing more than sixteen million characters of in- 
formation. This is the equivalent of more than 114 DOS 3.3 disks in a 
single file. 

The floppy barrier has been broken. What people will do with Apples 
now will truly amaze us all. 

"Say, Where Can I Get ProDOS?" ProDOS will be released this 
month in two forms. Purchasers of the Apple lie will find ProDOS and 
its manuals packed with new disk drives. They will also find a DOS 3.3 
System Master disk— but no DOS 3.3 manuals. For those who have 
already purchased an Apple II Plus or He, ProDOS master disks and 
manuals will be available in a separate package. DOS 3.3 will also be 
packaged and sold this way. 

At the same time, Apple will begin to ship its ProFile hard disk, 
which until now has been available only for the Apple HI and Lisa, in a 




JUST BECAUSE YOU PICK AN APPLE, 



DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO 
BUY THE WHOLE ORCHARD. 



The only thing more innportant than 
having your printer compatible with 
your personal computer is having it 
compatible with you. 

Which is why mixing an Okidata 
printer with your Apple computer is 
more like mixing apples with apples 
than you'd think. 

More Printers. More Printing. For 
instance, Okidata gives you eight high 
performance printers to choose from. 
Apple only gives you four. We give you 
two-color capabilities on some models. 
They give you basic black and white. 
With Okidata you can get three print 
modes. With Apple, you re stuck with 
one. Our speeds go up to an incredible 
350 cps. Theirs stop at 1 20. 

As for quality, our correspondence 
quality rivals the best daisywheels. And 



at up to 80 cps. Their letter quality 
printer is a daisywheel but moves along 
at only 40 cps. We also give you a full 
year's warranty on our print head. They 
give you 90 days. And we bring you the 
lowest warranty claim rate in the indus- 
try: less than '/?%. 

And More: Personal Touch & Plug n 
Play. With Okidata s Microline 92, 93 
and 84 printers, you can get Personal 
Touch. A downline loading software 
package that lets you print personalized 
characters, customized symbols and 
typefaces, even foreign languages. From 
Apple, you only get the hardware. 

Of course all Okidata printers are 
compatible with Apple computers. But 
now, all Okidata Microline printers in-

package for use with the Apple II. 

Apple released early versions of ProDOS to software developers last 
summer. A few developers have already released commercial software 
for the Apple based on ProDOS, and there is lots more to come. 

The Four Musketeers. With the addition of ProDOS, there are now 
four major operating systems available for the Apple II series of com- 
puters. The others, besides DOS 3.3, are the Apple Pascal operating 
system and CP/M. 

Each of the four has its own unique method for storing data on disks. 
This means that data stored on a disk by one operating system cannot be 
used by another without some kind of conversion program. 

However, ProDOS is completely file-compatible with SOS, the Ap- 
ple ni's operating system. This means that Apple III disks can be used in 
an Apple II running ProDOS, and vice versa. It also means that Apple lis 
and Ills can use the same data files on a single hard disk. Since Apple is 
infamous for having products that are not only incompatible with what 
other computer manufacturers offer but even with each other, let's hope 
this sudden compatibility is an indication of things to come. 

Unlike Apple's earlier change from thirteen-sector to sixteen-sector 
disks (DOS 3.2 to DOS 3.3), which necessitated the replacement of a 
firmware chip, using ProDOS requires no changes to Apple's disk drive 
or controller card from the current standard. ProDOS and DOS 3.3, as 
well as Apple Pascal and CP/M, can be used interchangeably on the 
same system. The system you operate under depends on what you boot 
or start up your computer with. 

Like Apple Pascal and CP/M, ProDOS requires 64K of RAM memo- 
ry. That means it requires a 48K Apple n Plus with a 16K RAM card or 
a stock Apple lie. DOS 3.3, on the other hand, works with as little as 
16K of memory. 

The Dual Nature of ProDOS. When you look at the catalog of a 
bootable ProDOS disk, as we will do here, you always find a file called 
ProDOS. This is the central core, or kernel, of the ProDOS operating 
system. When ProDOS is active, this kernel resides in the language card 
area of the Apple's memory. The entire 16K of memory in this area is re- 
served for the ProDOS kernel. 

The ProDOS kernel cannot interpret commands you enter at the 
keyboard or those used inside Basic programs. It does, however, have a 
complete, well-designed, and well-documented machine language in- 
terface. 

The job of turning your commands into machine language calls is 
done by system programs. ProDOS comes with several system pro- 
grams. Filer allows you to copy files and disks. It combines the functions 
of DOS 3.3's Fid and Copy A programs and the init command. Convert is 
used to convert ProDOS files into DOS 3.3 files, and vice versa. It's like 
DOS 3.3's Muffin. 

By far the most important ProDOS system program, at least to Ap- 
plesoft programmers, is the one called Basic. system. 

Basic. system is treated as a part of ProDOS in Apple's manuals. You 
will probably make friends with it more quickly, however, if you think 
of it as a separate system program that extends and enhances the abilities 
of Applesoft Basic. 

Not only does Basic. system provide the link between Applesoft and 
the ProDOS kernel, but it enhances Applesoft itself. On the other hand, 
Basic. system doesn't work at all with Integer Basic. 

Basic. system can also be used to execute ProDOS commands from 
assembly language. However, Basic. system itself takes up as much 
memory space as all of DOS 3.3 (this may give you a feel for its power 
with Applesoft). Consequently, most assembly language programmers 
will probably not use Basic. system, learning instead to use the ProDOS 
machine language interface directly. 

For the most part, Basic. system commands are compatible with DOS 
3.3 commands. This means it is relatively easy to convert Applesoft pro- 
grams from DOS 3.3 to ProDOS. However, a few of the DOS 3.3 com- 
mands have been deleted, some new commands have been added, and 
many commands have been enhanced. 

Here's a complete rundown of the command differences between 
DOS 3.3 and Basic. system: 

Out With the Old ... Six standard DOS 3.3 commands are missing 
from the ProDOS Basic. system. They are init, int, fp, maxfiles, mon, 
and nomon. 

Init is not a command, because the ProDOS kernel doesn't know how 
to initialize disks. Filer can do it, however. Apple has also given the 



source code for a machine language initialization program to software 
developers, so good commercial software can still include the ability to 
initialize disks. 

Int and fp are not needed, since Basic. system does not support Integer 
Basic; since the language card is used by the ProDOS kernel, there is no 
place to load Integer Basic on the Apple II Plus and lie. 

Also note that although ProDOS will run on older Integer Basic Ap- 
ples, Basic. system will not. This is because Applesoft isn't available and 
can't be loaded into the language card. However, system programs that 
do not require Applesoft (such as Filer and Convert) run just fine on 
these older Apples. 

The maxfiles command is not needed. Basic. system keeps one 
general-purpose buffer open at all times, allocating and deallocating 
other buffers automatically as needed. Up to eight files can be open at 
once if enough memory is available. 

The mon and nomon commands are not supported by Basic. system. 

. . . And In with the New. Basic. system includes eight new com- 
mands not included in DOS 3.3. They are cat, flush, store, restore, dash, 
fre, create, and prefix. 

Cat is a new, additional version of the catalog command; it returns a 
forty-column catalog showing each file's name, type, length in blocks (a 
block is 512 bytes, equal to two DOS 3.3 sectors), and a date showing 
when the file was last modified. An asterisk in front of a file name in- 
dicates that the file is locked, just as in DOS 3.3. Figure 1 shows a 
typical forty-column catalog.

ProDOS file names can have a maximum of fifteen characters. They 
must start with a letter. They can include only letters, numbers, and 
periods. Spaces and other punctuation marks are not allowed in ProDOS 
file names. Basic. system accepts commands in lower or upper case, but 
in file names small letters are automatically converted to capitals. 

ProDOS has many more file types than DOS 3.3. A complete 
description of ProDOS file types will be presented later. 

Note that, as indicated earlier, the files ProDOS and Basic. system ap- 
pear in a disk's catalog. If a disk will be used only for data storage and 
not for booting, however, these files can be left off the disk, thus creating 
more room on the disk for data. This procedure is more difficult with 
DOS 3.3, since DOS isn't in a file but hidden in special tracks on 
the disk. 

The fully spelled-out catalog command returns an eighty-column 
catalog display that shows, in addition to the information shown by cat, 
the time the file was last modified, the time and date the file was created, 
and its length. If the file is a binary file, the eighty-column catalog also 
shows its loading address; if it's a text file, its record length is shown. If 
you do a catalog on a forty-column screen, the lines wrap around and 
become nearly unreadable. On an eighty-column screen, Basic. system's 
catalog looks like the sample shown in figure 2. 

Time stamping of files requires a Thunderclock card from Thunder- 
ware. If no clock is available, the date can be set with a utility program 
that comes with ProDOS. If the date isn't set manually and no clock is 
available, the date field will say <no date> , as shown on the first three 
files. Other clock manufacturers will no doubt devise ways to get their 
clocks to work with ProDOS too. 

Flush is another of the Basic. system commands not in DOS 3.3. It 
forces any data located in a disk buffer to be written to the disk. Close 
also does this, but flush does it without closing the file. 

Store quickly saves the current values of an Applesoft program's 
string and numeric variables. A new type of file, VAR, is used for 
holding this kind of data. The restore command reloads saved variables.

As they are reloaded, the variables overwrite all current variables and 
their values. The commands are quick and much easier to program than 
the standard procedure of saving variables in a text file. These new com- 
mands will be much loved. 

The "dash" command, executed by typing a dash or minus sign, is 
an intelligent run command. It will run, brun, exec, or do whatever is 
needed to execute a file. It must be used to run the programs in system 
files such as Filer and Convert. When used, it looks like this: 

-FILER 

The three other new Basic. system commands— /r^, create, and 
prefix~wi\\ be discussed later. 

Parameter Pandemonium. Almost all of the remaining commands 
are enhanced in some way under Basic. system. Some of these 
enhancements involve new parameters or new uses for standard DOS 3.3 
parameters. 

For example, the A (address) parameter can be used under DOS 3.3 
with bload, brun, and bsave. However, under Basic. system it can also be 
used with the in# and pr# commands to redirect input or output to a 
machine language program rather than to a slot. For example, the 
command: 

PR#A$300 

will send output to a machine language routine residing at byte $300. 
When a character is to be printed, its ASCII value is put in the ac- 
cumulator, and the routine at $300 is called. 

Similarly, the B (byte) parameter can be used with Basic. system's 
bload, brun, and bsave commands. Under DOS, B can be used only with 
read and write. Use of the B parameter causes the file to be loaded or 
saved the specified number of bytes beyond its beginning. 

The bload, brun, and bsave commands also have a brand-new param- 
eter under Basic. system: E (end). It is an alternative to the L parameter 
used with binary files under DOS 3.3. The E parameter is used to specify 
the end of a memory range rather than the length of the range. For exam- 
ple, both of the following are valid Basic. system commands; both save a 
high-resolution picture from graphics page two. The first tells Ba- 
sic, system to save $2000 bytes of memory starting at location $4000. 
The second says to save the memory image beginning at $4000 and end- 
ing at $5FFF: 

BSAVE PICTURE, A$4000,L$2000 
BSAVE PICTURE,A$4000,E$5FFF 

In addition, the L and E parameters can be used when bloading files 
under Basic. system. Under DOS 3.3, the L parameter is used only with 
bsaves. If used with bload or brun, the parameters make Basic. system 
load only a part of a binary file. If the B parameter is also used, the por- 
tion loaded can be anywhere within the binary file. For example, let's 
assume that a file called Pictures contains four high-resolution images. 
These can be loaded one at a time into graphics page one with the follow- 
ing four commands: 

BLOAD PICTURES, A$2000,L$2000 

BLOAD PICTURES,A$2000,B$2000,L$2000 (or ,E$3FFFJ 

BLOAD PICTURES,A$2000,B$4000,L$2000 

BLOAD PICTURES,A$2000,B$6000,L$2000 

The run command comes with a new parameter in Basic. system: @ 
(at). This parameter allows you to start a program running at some line 



other than the first one. Typing run Happy,@400, for example, starts ex- 
ecution of the designated program at line 400. 

The @ parameter can also be used with the chain command. Unlike 
DOS 3.3, Basic. system allows you to chain Applesoft program files. 
This means you can load pieces of an Applesoft program over the top of 
one another without destroying the values in any existing variables. This 
allows the creation of very long programs that won't fit in memory 
all at once. 

Another new parameter is F (field). Under DOS 3.3, the position 
command uses the R (relative field positon) parameter to skip over fields 
in a file. Basic. system still supports the use of R with position, but this is 
just for the sake of compatibility with DOS 3.3. Neither the connmand 
nor the parameter is necessary with Basic. system. The F parameter 
replaces R as it was used with position, and the fact that F can be used 
with the read and write commands makes position unnecessary. 

The final new parameter is T (file type). This parameter can be used 
with the create command, which will be discussed later. It can also be 
used with bload, bsave, and open. By using the T parameter, you can 
bload any type of file directly into memory. Likewise, you can bsave an 
image of memory into almost any type of file, and any type of file can be 
opened and read as if it were a text file. 

A Command Performance. In addition to the enhanced parameters, 
a new Basic. system commands are enhanced in other ways as well. We 
have already spoken about catalog's eighty-column display, chain's 
ability to handle Applesoft files, and open's automatic allocation of file 
buffer space. 

Basic. system's append command works with random access files. 
Like open, it will also work with other file types when the T parameter is 
used. Under DOS 3.3, append opens a file and moves the file pointer to 
the end of the file. Basic. system's append command not only does this, 
but also issues an automatic write. 

Basic. system's verify command hasn't been enhanced. In fact it's 
been downgraded. It doesn't verify the integrity of a file as the DOS 3.3 
verify command does. Instead, it simply verifies the existence of a file. 
This is how most people have always used the command anyhow. 

You Take the High Road and I'll Take the Low Road. A very 
significant difference between Basic. system and DOS 3.3 is the method 
each uses to identify commands within programs. With DOS 3.3, it is 
necessary to print a return followed by a control-D and the appropriate 
DOS command. DOS 3.3 watches the characters passing through the 
output link and responds to this particular combination. 

Basic. system uses a similar approach but implements it in a complete- 
ly different way. Basic. system begins by turning on Applesoft's trace 
mode. Each time Applesoft executes a new command, it sends the line 
number it is working on to Basic. system. Basic. system then looks at that 
command to see if it is print. If it is, Basic. sytem looks further to see if 
the first character to be printed is a control-D. If so, it assumes that a 
ProDOS command will follow. 

There are several implications to this new technique. First, control-D 
does not have to be preceded by a return. This makes programming Pro- 
DOS commands much easier than DOS commands. 

Second, the popular technique of defining D$ as a return plus a 
control-D doesn't work. If you do this, the first character printed will be 
the return, and Basic. system will assume that the print statement is not a 
DOS command. 

The third implication of this technique is that the Applesoft trace and 
notrace commands work with Basic. system. These commands cause 



117 



great confusion when used with DOS 3.3 because they tend to prevent 
the execution of DOS commands. 

The fourth implication is that, if you ever disconnect Basic. system 
from the input/output links by accident (using pr# or in# as a Basic com- 
mand rather than a D$ ProDOS command), you will know it im- 
mediately—your program will begin to trace all over your display 
screen. 

The fifth implication is that Applesoft programs run slightly slower 
under Basic. system than under DOS 3.3. The following little program, 
for example, runs about 7 '/2 percent slower under ProDOS (60.4 seconds 
for ProDOS as opposed to 56.1 seconds for DOS 3.3): 

10 BELLS = CHR$(7) 

20 PRINT BELLS 

30 FOR 1= 1 TO 50000: NEXT 

40 PRINT BELLS 

50 END 

Basic. system makes up for its slower program execution speed by 
refining the Applesoft garbage collection routines. Under Basic. system, 
Applesoft programs don't lock up for long periods while obsolete 
character strings are eliminated from memory. Garbage collection is 
handled by Basic. system rather than by Applesoft, using new, more effi- 
cient routines. 

Consequently, even though Basic. system's line-by-line execution of 
Applesoft is slightly slower than normal, the total execution time of pro- 
grams that use strings may in fact be faster than with DOS 3.3. 

Basic. system's garbage collection happens automatically as needed. 
It can be forced with the new command fre. This command is used like 
this: 

1010 PRINT DS;"FRE" 

For most applications, however, Basic. system's garbage collection is so 
much improved that forcing it with the fre command is not necessary. 

Early versions of Basic. system also included routines for au- 
tomatically clearing Basic programs out of the high-resolution graphic 
pages. This is something that you have to do yourself under DOS 3.3. 
Unfortunately, the same now goes for the programmer using Ba- 
sic, system. The routines outgrew their allotted space during testing and 
debugging and had to be eliminated. 

Basic. system includes two features that will appeal to programmers 
who want to enhance Applesoft with machine language routines. First, 
Basic. system has a defined protocol for "hiding" machine language 
code within Basic. system. Hidden code can't be overwritten and de- 
stroyed by Applesoft. 

Second, Basic. system can be extended easily by means of additional 
commands and includes a defined protocol for adding such commands. 
Apple used this feature to provide a help command for use with ProDOS 
and Basic. system. The help package is included on ProDOS master 
disks. 

The ProDOS Inner Sanctum. Until now, the features we've looked 
at have been characteristics of Basic. system, the new system program 
that unites Applesoft with ProDOS. Now let's look at the characteristics 
of ProDOS itself as compared to DOS 3.3. 

Several significant differences are immediately apparent. ProDOS 
handles files much more quickly than standard DOS 3.3, and it matches 
the speed of the enhanced versions of DOS 3.3 offered by several soft- 
ware companies. 

As mentioned earlier, DOS 3.3 is optimized for floppy disks. Pro- 
DOS is optimized for high-capacity hard disks but still works well with 
Apples having two or more floppy drives. ProDOS was designed to work 
with storage devices as large as thirty-two megabytes (32,768K bytes; 
33,554,432 bytes) per volume. A single ProDOS file can be as large as 
sixteen megabytes. 

No storage devices currently available for the Apple are that large. 
Apple's own ProFile hard disk has a five-megabyte capacity. Hard disks 
from other manufacturers are available in 10-, 15-, and 20-megabyte 
sizes. 

ProDOS includes a defined interrupt protocol. This makes routines 
using interrupt signals from peripherals easier to write and install. Like 
DOS 3.3, however, the amount of time it might take ProDOS to respond 
to an interrupt is unpredictable, since an interrupt request will be ignored 
while a floppy disk is being accessed. 



ProDOS supports a much wider variety of file types than DOS 3.3. 
ProDOS file types are identified by three letters rather than the single- 
letter system of DOS 3.3. Ten ProDOS file types have been defined, 
with eight more reserved for user definition. The file types are listed in 
figure 3.

Changing with the Times. The most significant difference between 
DOS 3.3 and ProDOS is in the area of file structure. DOS 3.3 was 
designed to work well with disk drives that use removable floppy disks. 
The typical DOS 3.3 user has one or two floppy disk drives and ten to 
one hundred disks. 

The user tells DOS 3.3 which disk he wants to use by selecting it 
from his library and inserting it in a drive. The simple fact that it is in the 
drive is indication enough to DOS that this is the disk the user wants to 
access. 

ProDOS, on the other hand, works best with drives that don't have 
removable disks. Each drive is considered to be a volume and is given a 
name. The user tells ProDOS which drive he wants to access by using 
its name. 

When ProDOS is used with drives having removable disks, the drive 
becomes a moving target. Since each disk in one's library is supposed to 
have a different name, the name associated with a drive changes every 
time a new disk is slipped in. Thus, ProDOS users with floppy drives can 
specify which disk should be accessed by putting it in the drive, 
but usually must specify it again by name. This redundancy can be 
bothersome. 

Under DOS 3.3, each floppy disk has one catalog, or directory. It can 
hold up to 105 file names. This system works well on small floppy disks, 
although it gets very difficult to find individual files if a directory in- 
cludes more than thirty to forty file names. 

Imagine the difficulty one would have finding a file on a high- 
capacity hard disk if all files appeared in a single directory. ProDOS 
avoids this problem by allowing each volume to have many separate 
directories. In addition, each volume has one root directory, which can 
hold up to fifty-one files. 

Some of the files in the root directory usually hold other directories. 
A special filetype, DIR, is used to indicate files that hold directories. 
Directories other than the root directory can be of any length. Just as the 
system programs ProDOS and Basic.system can be found in files, all 
ProDOS directories are also files. Not only do they appear as file names 
when you enter the cat or catalog commands, they can also be opened 
and read just like other types of files. 

One directory can be a fde inside another directory, which is a file in- 
side another directory, which is a file inside another directory, and so on. 
The number of directory levels you can squeeze out of ProDOS is 
64— far beyond the number needed in any real application. 

The actual name of any particular fde on a ProDOS volume starts 
with the name of the volume it is on and includes the names of all direc- 
tories one must pass through to get to the file. The name indicates the 
path ProDOS must take to find the file. Thus, under ProDOS, files have 
path names. 

Slashes are used to separate the different directory names within a 
path name. A file called tue, in a directory called week] , in a directory 
called jan, on a disk called to. do, for example, has the path name 
/to.do/jan/weekl /tue . Figure 4 shows how you might find tue in a vol- 



118 




ume's directories. Take note of how a path name is used with the catalog 
command. 

A path name can be up to sixty-four characters long, including 
slashes. As you can imagine, it can be rather tedious to type in long path 
names, particularly if all the files you want to deal with are in the same 
subdirectory. Because of this, ProDOS allows you to set a prefix. A 
prefix points to a specific directory. After setting a prefix, you can refer 
to files in that directory, or that can be reached from that directory, using 
a partial path name. 

Basic. system includes a prefix command that can be used either to set 
a new prefix or to find out what the current prefix setting is. In figure 4, 
you could set the prefix to /to.do/jan/weekl . After that, any file in the 
last directory shown can be called using only its name— just as if it were 
a DOS 3.3 file. 

The major difference between a directory file and other types of files 
is that directories cannot be written to — ProDOS takes care of making all 
changes to directories. As we mentioned before, though, directories can 
be opened and read just like any other file. Another difference between 
directory files and other files is that a special command is used to create 
directory files. Under Basic. system, this command is create. Create can 
also be used to create other types of files by using the T parameter. The 
standard commands open, save, and bsave will also create files just as 
they do under DOS 3.3. 



JANUARY 1984 



The system of directories and subdirectories that ProDOS uses is 
known as a hierachical fde structure. This kind of structure is ideal for 
large-capacity storage devices. It can also be useful for organizing files 
on smaller devices, such as floppy disks. In some cases, the additional 
complexity of specifying a volume name or setting a prefix can be a mad- 
dening waste of time for floppy disk users. On the other hand, having 
received a proper path name, ProDOS will find the right disk no matter 
what drive it is in, so there are advantages and disadvantages to a hierar- 
chical system. 

A Tale of Two DOSs. Compared to ProDOS, DOS 3.3 continues to 
be the easier operating system to use on systems having a single floppy 
drive. (The ProDOS Convert utility requires at least two drives, for ex- 
ample.) DOS 3.3 uses far less memory than ProDOS, works with Integer 
Basic, and allows Applesoft to execute slightly faster. Apple users have 
tons of experience with DOS 3.3, volumes of documentation have been 
written about it, and virtually every commercial program for the Apple 
uses it. It continues to be a viable alternative to ProDOS. 

ProDOS, on the other hand, is an exciting new development from 
Apple. It is an ideal operating system for people with high-capacity stor- 
age devices such as hard disks. It is an ideal operating system for 
database applications, providing Applesoft programmers with many 
new, valuable features. As Apple users become more accustomed to it, 
absolutely astounding things are bound to happen.

With 3M diskettes, your computer never forgets. 



3M diskettes remember everything, every time. Because at3M, 
reliability is built into every diskette. We've been in the computer 
media business for over 30 years. And we've never settled in. 
We're constantly improving and perfecting our product line, from 
computer tape and data cartridges to floppy disks. 
3M diskettes are made at 3M. That way, we have complete control 
over the entire manufacturing process. And you can have complete 
confidence in the reliability of every 3M diskette you buy. 
Look in the Yellow Pages under Computer Supplies and Parts for 
the 3M distributor nearest you. In Canada, write 3M Canada, Inc., 
London, Ontario. If it's worth remembering, it's worth 3M diskettes. 




3M hears you. 




We added another head 
so you won't have to buy another disk. 

That's the beauty of a double sided head. A 
floppy disk which allows you to read and write on 
both sides. For more storage, for more information, 

for keeping larger records, 
and for improved perfor- 
mance of your system. 
That's what our new Elite 
Two and Elite Three offers. 
It's the first double headed 
Apple® compatible disk 
drive in the industry. And of 
course, the technology is 
from Rana. We're the com- 
pany who gave you 163K 
bytes of storage with our Elite One, a 14% increase 
over Apple's. And now with our high tech double 
sided heads, our Elite Two and Three offers you two 
to four times more storage than Apple's. That's 
really taking a byte out of the competition. 

We put our heads together 
to give you a superior disli drive. 

We designed the Elite Three to give you near 
hard disk capacity with all the advantages of a 
minifloppy system. The double sided head oper- 
ates on 80 tracks per side, giving you a capacity of 
652K bytes. It would take AVz Apples to give you 
that. And cost you three times our Elite Three's 
reasonable $849 pricetag. 



Rana's double sided heads give Apple 
II superior disk performance power 
than second generation personal com- 
puters such as IBM's. 



It takes 4V2 Apples to equal the capacity 
of our superior Elite Three. 





The Elite Two offers an impressive 326K bytes 
and 40 tracks on each side. This drive is making a 
real hit with users who need extra storage, but 
don't require top-of-the-line capacity Costwise, it 
takes 2V2 Apple drives to equal the performance of 
our Elite Two. And twice as many diskettes. Leave it 
to Rana to produce the most cost efficient disk 
drive in the world. 

We've always had the guts to be a leader. 

Our double sided head may be an industry 
first for Apple computers, but nobody was surprised. 




They've come to expect it from us. Because Rana 
has always been a leader We were the first 
with a write protect feature, increased capacity 




Your word processor stores 5 times as many pages of text on an Elite Three 
diskette as the cost ineffective Apple. 

and accurate head positioning. A first with attrac- 
tive styling, faster access time, and the conve- 
nience of storing a lot more pages on far fewer 
diskettes. We were first to bring high technology to 
a higher level of quality 

So ask for an Elite One, Two, or Three. 
Because when it comes to disk drives, nobody 
uses their head like Rana.

JANUARY 1984 




Back in 1979, Ken Williams was developing 
a Fortran compiler for the Apple n and Roberta 
Williams was just discovering the original Ad- 
venture from Microsoft. 

By 1980, Roberta had convinced Ken to pro- 
gram an adventure she would write, an adven- 
ture with a new twist— graphics. 

With an initial investment of $1,200, Ken 
and Roberta Williams formed On-Line Sys- 
tems. They produced Roberta's first hi-res 
adventure game. Mystery House, in their Los 
Angeles home. Within a year. Mystery House 
had grossed an unexpected $167,000 in sales. 
Bolstered by their success, the Williamses took 
off for the wilderness, relocating in Coarsegold, 
California, on the edge of Yosemite National 
Park, with their sons, D.J. and Chris. 

When Softalk first featured the company in a 
February 1981 Exec, three On-Line programs 
had already made it to the Top Thirty. One was 
Roberta's second hi-res adventure, Wizard and 
the Princess, a long-running bestseller that has 
sold more than sixty thousand copies. At that 



time, the company's only other products were 
graphic utilities, but Williams soon broadened 
its scope to action games (Crossfire, Mouskat- 
tack. Jawbreaker), word processing {Screen 
Writer), database management {The General 
Manager), and more ambitious adventures, like 
the twelve-disk-sided micro-epic Time Zone, 
which took Roberta Williams more than a year 
to write. 

Upon incorporating, the company changed 
its name to Sierra On-Line. The staff of four at 
the time of the Exec has increased to more than 
a hundred people full-time, scattered over four 
separate buildings. Sierra On-Line posted reve- 
nues of approximately $10 million in 1982, 
making it one of the largest independent pub- 
lishers of home computer software. 

"Building Sierra On-Line has been a real 
learning experience for Ken and me," says Ro- 
berta, who's working on her sixth adventure. 
"Things were going so fast for a while that we 
didn't have time to think about it all. I think I've 
grown a lot as a person; I've learned that you 





Above, adventuress extraordinaire Roberta Williams reflects on how much she's grown as a person in 
the process of building Sierra On-Line into the successful company it is today. 



have to change if you don't want to fall flat on 
your face." 

As On-Line grew, the business took more 
and more of Ken Williams's time. Soon there 
was no time left for the programming he loved 
and did so well. The company by then could af- 
ford to hire programmers, but Ken missed 
working with the computer, and the product 
missed his touch. An influx of venture capital 
seemed to increase the administrative load 
rather than ease it, and Ken Williams decided to 
fire himself. He hired a new chief operating of- 
ficer from outside the company, a man he had 
once worked for and whose abilities he ad- 
mired. Dick Sunderland came into a company 
that had grown like a wildflower in the sun; like 
a wildflower, it was rangy and disorganized. He 
set out with a flourish to correct all this. 

But the task was greater than supposed. Pio- 
neers are properly wedded to their creations; 
it's hard to see them controlled by others and let 
them be. Ken Williams hired Sunderland so he 
could program. Instead, he fretted. And, in be- 
tween, he and Roberta traveled to promote On- 
Line's products. 

The situation couldn't last, and it didn't. 
Rumors of trouble at On-Line raged through the 
industry; concern for the couple crept into thou- 
sands of phone calls. On-Line was on the way 
down; On-Line was in trouble. What was the 
matter with Ken Williams? Where was his geni- 
us, his incisive business sense? But few could 
reach him, and to those who did he wasn't say- 
ing much. 

Finally, after nearly a year, industry phones 
buzzed with a new message: "The age of op- 
pression at On-Line is over," went the much re- 
peated quote from one of On-Line 's top execs. 
Sunderland was out and Ken and Roberta 
Williams were in — as copresidents. 

With the long-predicted shakeup in the mi- 
crocomputer industry just beginning to claim 
real victims, it's too soon to say for certain that 
Sierra On-Line has regained a solid footing in 
time; but the year-lost relaxation in Ken Wil- 
liams's demeanor and the once-again enthusias- 
tic plans of brother and marketing veep John 
Williams promise a return to the pioneer spirit 
of the old On-Line— a good direction to go. 

Often the changes that success brings are not 
easy to accept; other changes are more than 
welcome. When the Williamses couldn't find a 
suitable home in the area they liked, they de- 
cided to build. Ken's only stipulation was that 
he have a raquetball court— the rest he left up to 
Roberta. Says Roberta about the resuh, "I think 
we overdid ourselves a bit." 



JANUARY 1984 



Situated on five and a half acres on the Fres- 
no River, the ten-thousand-square-foot two- 
story home is rustic, featuring lots of wood in- 
cluding hand-hewn beams, all cedar siding, and 
fireplaces of natural river rock. The front door 
is flanked by stained-glass windows depicting 
characters from the adventure game Dark Crys- 
tal. Stained-glass images of other Williams ad- 
venture characters appear throughout the house. 

In the past year. Sierra On-Line has expand- 
ed its product line beyond the Apple market. 
Recent and upcoming products are aimed at 
Atari, IBM, Commodore, and Coleco comput- 
ers as well as Apple. 

In the works is an adventure based on the 
characters from the "Family Circus" cartoon 
strip. Other cartoon-strip-based scenarios, li- 
censed from Sidney Development Corporation 
(Canada's largest developer of packaged soft- 
ware), feature the characters of "B.C." and the 
"Wizard of Id," developed by award-winning 
cartoonist Johnny Hart. 

Since Softalk's Exec, Sierra On-Line has also 
begun a growing commitment to educational 
software. Nancy Anderton, Sierra On-Line's 
manager of educational publishing, is enthusias- 
tic about the new ways computers allow con- 
cepts to be presented. Anderton says the com- 
pany's philosophy is that educational software 
should give skills learning and entertainment 
equal priority. She sees drill and response or 
flash-card-type programs as a waste of the com- 
puter's potential for teaching. 

Earlier this year, Sierra On-Line acquired 




an educational product line developed by Sun- Above, Ken Williams once fired himself so he could spend more time programming. Now he's back 
nyside Soft. Included were Dragon 's Keep and sharing the copresidency with his wife Roberta.

Troll's 7 ale, two vocabulary-controlled junior 
adventure games for kids at first-grade and 
second-grade reading levels, and another pro- 
gram, Bop-A-Bet, which teaches the alphabet. 

The preschool Learning with Leeper, Sierra 
On-Line's first educational release developed 
in-house, stresses math, reading, and writing 
readiness skills and requires no adult supervi- 
sion. This game won a CES Showcase award 
and was dubbed educational game of the year by 
Electronic Games magazine. The learning ap- 
proach taken in this product continues in 1984 
with Learning with Fuzzy Womp, now being 
field-tested with preschoolers. 

Sierra On-Line is also moving into the area 
of creative play, in the form of story-construc- 
tion-kit-type programs. The first offering of this 
kind will provide the tools for children to create 
their own stories with graphics and text that can 
be saved to disk. 

Sierra On-Line's next goal is to make a dent 
in yet another relatively unexplored area — what 
Ken Williams refers to as "home productivi- 
ty." The cornerstone of this new line is Home- 
word, an easy-to-use word processor for people 
who don't require the complex features of a 
program like Screen Writer. Homeward' s most 
distinctive feature is its use of icons. Other 
icon-based programs, planned to interface with 
Homeword, are Homeword Filer, a database 
management system, and Homeword Speller, a 
dictionary program. 




With Sierra On-Line's first national televi- 
sion advertising campaign having begun on 
MTV, Ken and Roberta Williams are now very 
aware of the volatility of the industry they have 
helped shape. In the new age — with the Wil- 
liamses sharing the leadership of their no-long- 
er-tiny company— they believe they can survive 
and prosper. Says Roberta, "All you can do is 
your best." And On-Line's best has always 
been pretty damn good. 

In May 1981, Softalk visited the Apple Edu- 
cation Foundation. Formed in August 1979, the 



foundation has provided hardware grants to in- 
dividuals for developing educational software. 
In the past, the foundation also disseminated in- 
formation about quality software through the 
Journal of Courseware Review. The foundation 
activities were overseen by Carolyn Stauffer 
and Peggy Redpath, with the help of area assis- 
tant Jo Plato. Today, the work of the foundation 
continues, but with changes in administrative 
staff and in the program's emphasis. 

Since its inception, the foundation has pro- 
vided 170 grants. The approach of giving small 
seed grants to single developers stimulated the 
growth of educational software development. 
Now that the educational software market is 
flourishing, the approach has changed. As of 
the current yearly grant cycle, about a dozen 
grants, each consisting of thirty computer sys- 
tems (including printers and modems), will be 
awarded to colleges and schools collaborating 
on teacher training programs. The foundation is 
looking for programs that explore how micro- 
computers can teach others, through program- 
ming or drill and practice. The use of model 
simulations and the notion of microworlds are 
two promising areas. 

Grant proposals submitted to the foundation 
are reviewed by an advisory board. Each year a 
set of guidelines is published for those wishing 
to submit proposals. Individuals or institutions 
may contact the foundation directly through Ap- 
ple to obtain a copy of the guidelines. 

Directing the foundation for the past year 
has been Barbara Bowen; before joining the 
foundation, she consulted with and helped train 
educators and dealers on the use of Logo in the 
classroom. Bowen is responsible for monitoring 
grantees and evaluating proposals for submis-

System Saver didn't become the 
Apple's mmiber one selling* 
peripheral by being just a fan. 



What made over 100,000 Apple' owners fall in 
love with System Saver? The answer is simple. 
It's the most versatile, most convenient, most 
useful peripheral ever made for the Apple. 

System Saver filters out damaging AC line 
noise and power surges. 

70-90% of all microcomputer malfunctions can be 
traced to power line problems* * Problems your 
System Saver guards against. 

Power line noise can often be interpreted as data. 
This confuses your computer and produces system 
errors. Power surges and spikes can cause severe 
damage to your Apple's delicate circuitry and lead 
to costly servicing. 

System Saver clips surges and 
spikes at a 130 Volts RMS/175 
Volts dc level. A PI type filter 
attenuates common and 
transverse mode noise by a 
minimum of 30 dB from 600 
kHz to 20 mHz with a max- 
imum attenuation of 50 dB. 
You end up with an Apple 
that's more accurate, more 
efficient and more reliable. 

SYSTEM SAVER 




System Saver makes your Apple more 
convenient to use. 

No more reaching around to the back of your Apple 
to turn It on. No more fumbling for outlets and cords 
to plug m your monitor and printer. System Saver 
organizes all your power needs.

at- 




It functions as a multi-outlet power strip with two 
switched outlets. Plus System Saver offers the 
ultimate convenience; a front mounted power switch 
for fingertip control of your entire system 



System Saver lets your Apple keep its cool. 

Today's advanced peripheral cards generate heat. In 
addition, the cards block any natural air flow through 
the Apple He creating high temperature conditions 
that shorten the life of the Apple and peripheral cards. 

System Saver's efficient, quiet 
fan draws fresh air across 
the mother board, over 
the power supply and 
out the side ventilation 

slots. It leaves your Apple cool, calm and running 

at top speed. 





So if you want to keep 
damaging heat, line noise and power surges out of 
your system for good, pick up the only peripheral 
that's m use every second your computer is m use. 
The System Saver. You'll soon come to think of it as 
the piece Apple forgot.

Buttonwoo 



Apples 



BV I^EH LAHDIS 




Recently, a friend and fellow investor suggested that Buttonwood Ap- 
ples might have a worm in it. His feeling was that the tutorial section 
we 've been offering recently may be too elementary for many of the col- 
umn 's readers. Bearing that possibility in mind, we 'd like to have your 
help in refining the focus of the column. 

The aim, of course, is to make Buttonwood Apples as informative and 
useful as possible. So if there is an advanced topic you 'd like to see 
covered in the tutorial section, we 'd like to hear about it. Or, if you have 
fourul the tutorial sections of the last few months helpful, let us know that 
too. Address your responses to Buttonwood, Box 60, Norih Hollywood, 
CA 91601. 



This month's tutorial section is short and to the point. We're simply 
going to mention one of the most popular and respected books on basic 
investing ever published: How To Buy Stocks by Louis Engel and Bren- 
dan Boyd. It's published by Bantam Books and costs $3.95. 

How To Buy Stocks probably has more investment value than any in- 
side tip you'll ever get. Whether you're a beginning, intermediate, or ad- 
vanced investor, you'll very likely enjoy this book and learn a great deal 
from it. 

This month's review spotlight focuses on another informational prod- 
uct of sorts, Teleware's Teleminder. 

Teleminder, Teleware (Box 729, 28 Bloomfield Avenue, Pine Brook, 
NJ 07058; 800-225-0076, in New Jersey 201-882-0466), $195. 
Backup policy: Ninety -day warranty; replacements, $30 each. 
System requirements: 64K Apple II Plus, lie, or III, two disk drives, 
printer, Hayes Micromodem or Smartmodem. 

Teleminder is a superb program that turns the Dow Jones 
News/Retrieval Service into a ftilly automated electronic clipping serv- 
ice. The Dow Jones log-on and retrieval products we've examined in the 
past have required the investor to man the keyboard throughout the con- 
nection period, entering instructions and requests. If the information you 
wanted took fifteen minutes to retrieve from Dow Jones, you had no 
choice but to spend fifteen minutes at the keyboard. Teleminder cuts that 
fifteen minutes down to two and requires only 1 percent of the effort 
other programs demand. 

Because it is written in Pascal, Teleminder requires the same rigid 
placement of peripherals (printer interface card in slot 1 , serial interface 
or modem controUer card in slot 2) that is called for in other Pascal pro- 
grams. When the program disk has been placed in the first drive and an 
initialized data disk in the second, the investor is greeted by a system 
parameter or initialization screen into which a Dow Jones password, 
local Telenet or Tymnet access number, choice of modem, and a printer 
setup string (if required) are to be entered. Once the system parameters 
have been saved to the data disk, the master menu appears. A vertical 
line down the middle of the display divides this menu screen into two 
sections. The left side of the menu screen contains the program's menu 
choices; the right side shows the files (called lists) stored on the data 
disk, along with their status (active or inactive— more on file status 
later). 

From the main menu, you can create a list, change (edit) a list, and 
delete a list. From here you can also specify timed execution or no clock 



(immediate execution). Communications and utilities options are also 
available from the main menu. 

The create-a-list function allows the investor to build a list of up to 
eighteen stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, treasury issues, and news 
categories. Each list must be assigned a unique name (for example, 
Hitech, Bluchp; the only restriction is that the name of a list cannot be 
longer than six characters). If the investor attempts to use a name that has 
already been used, the program stops, displays a mesage at the bottom of 
the screen, and starts the naming process again. This makes it impossible 
to give two lists on the same disk the same name, thereby preventing 
potentially costly user errors. 

Once a list has been given a name, the cursor moves automatically to 
the first symbol entry point. The symbols used in Teleminder are the 
ticker tape symbols used to identify securities on Dow Jones. (A com- 
plete list of these symbols appears in the Dow Jones Information Services 
Directory and is retrievable on-line from Dow Jones by entering the ap- 
propriate symbol at the system prompt.) The program does not check the 
validity of symbol entries, so if you've entered an incorrect symbol you 
won't know it until you log on to Dow Jones. The program will attempt 
to fetch information for that symbol and fail. At this point, Dow Jones 
will return a "symbol in error" message, which the program displays. 

Teleminder prompts the investor to specify the type of security the 
symbol represents — S for stock, B for bond, O for option, M for mutual 
fUnd, T for treasury issue, and I for news category. The program checks 
for errors at this entry point and rejects any other symbols the user 
offers. 

Next, the investor is asked to supply the earliest date for which 
Teleminder should fetch information. This date is referred to as the "ac- 
cess date." One of the first queries sent to the system at log-on is a re- 
quest for the current date. Dow Jones responds by sending the current 
date and time. Teleminder then checks the access date and fetches all 
news stories from that date to the present, after which it updates the ac- 
cess date by changing it to the current date. From this point on, the ac- 
cess date reflects the last date on which the news stories list was updated. 

The user must answer yes or no to four Teleminder parameters. 
These determine what will happen once the Dow Jones connection has 
been made. 

The first parameter is news. In response to a yes answer from the 
user, the program fetches the news stories listed for all stocks and news 
categories in the investor's file. 

The second parameter is quotes. If the investor answers yes to this 
prompt, quotes are retrieved and printed for all lists of stocks, bonds, op- 
tions, mutual funds, and treasury bills (in other words, for everything ex- 
cept the news categories). 

The third parameter is print. Answering yes here gets the investor a 
complete printout of the news stories retrieved during the current ses- 
sion. The printing of retrieved stories is done as soon as the quotes have 
finished printing. 

The fourth and final parameter is headlines. Saying yes at this point 
informs Teleminder that you want to see only the headlines of the Dow 
Jones stories, rather than the whole stories. Why see only headlines? 
Because retrieving an entire news story can take a fair amount of time, 





DOS, CP7W PASCAL 

The only communications software 

you'll ever need! 



Softerm 1 

The Complete, Upgradeable Package 
for Home or Business Use 

Softerm 1 is a powerful and flexible terminal emula- 
tion program that operates on an Apple" II, II Plus, 
or lie to provide basic terminal communications to 
a variety of host computers, timesharing services, 
and information services such as The Soume^'^ 
CompuServe " and the Dow Jones News/ Retrieval " 
It operates full or half-duplex at speeds up to 
9600 bps using either a direct connection or any 
standard manual or auto-dial modem. Features in- 
clude user-defined keyboard macros, built-in phone 
book for automatic dialing, terminal mode line 
capture simultaneously to print or disk, copy screen 
to print or disk, and terminal status display. 

DOS, CP/M, and PASCAL 
File Compatibility Combined In 
a Single Program 

Softerm 1 incorporates an advanced file manager 
which provides compatibility with DOS 3.3, CP/M, 
and Pascal disk formats for all file operations 
including file transfers. And at speeds up to 5 times 
faster than standard Apple DOS! Built-in disk utili- 
ties provide INIT CATALOG. RENAME, and DELETE 
commands for all disk formats. Wildcard match char- 
acters can be used whenever filenames are entered. 

Local file transfers allow DOS, CP/M, or Pascal 
files to be displayed, printed, or even copied to 
another disk. For example, a file on a CP/M for- 
matted disk in Drive 1 could be copied to a Pascal 
formatted disk in Drive 2 providing a complete 
format conversion capability. Numerous editing 
options such as tab expansion and removing 
unwanted characters allow easy reformatting of 
data to accommodate the variations in data formats 
used by host computers. 



IVIulti-Protocol 

File Transfer Capability 

Softerm 1 offers file transfer methods flexible 
enough to match any host computer requirement. 
These include the character protocol with user- 
definable characteristics to provide maximum flexi- 
bility for text file transfers to any computer. The 
CP/M User's Group standard XMODEM protocol 
may be used for binary file transfers with systems 
using the CP/M operating system. The intelligent 
Softrans protocol can be used to transfer any type 
file and provides automatic binary encoding and 
decoding, error detection and automatic retransmis- 
sion, and data compression to enfi^nce line utiliza- 
tion. A FORTRAN 77 source prdgram is supplied 
with Softerm 1 which is easily adaptable to any 
host computer to allow comrtiunications with 
Softerm using the Softrans protocol. Specific host 
computer versions of the Softrans FORTRAN pro- 
gram are available on request. 
Softerm file transfer utilizes an easy to use com- 
mand language which may be executed interactively 
or from a macro command file which has been 
previously entered and saved on disk. Twenty-three 
high-level commands include DIAL. CATALOG, 
SEND RECEIVE ONERR. MONITOR HANGUP, and 
others. A SCHEDULE command even allows file 
transfers at a specific date and time. 

Softerm 2 

The "Choice of Professionals" 

Softerm 2 includes all features of Softerm 1 and 
provides an exact terminal emulation for a wide 
range of conversational and block mode CRT ter- 
minals. Special function keys, sophisticated editing 
features, even local printer capabilities of the ter- 
minals emulated are fully supported. In fact, your 
host computer won't know the difference! All of the 
following emulations are included in Softerm 2 and 
the list is growing...

and time in this case really does mean money. Once you've scanned the 
headlines, you can use Teleminder' s communications module to retrieve 
the news stories you want to see. If you respond affirmatively to both the 
news and headlines parameters, the headlines response overrides news, 
and only headlines are fetched. 

Once the symbols, list type, and parameters have been chosen, the 
list-building process is complete. Teleminder automatically saves the 
completed list to disk, then redisplays the main menu screen. The name 
that the investor gave the list now appears on the right-hand side of the 
screen, and the list's status becomes inactive until the user specifies 
otherwise. 

Dow Jones retrieves symbols and news for active lists only. Tele- 
minder will remember the status of each list when the investor finishes a 
session. The next time the program is used, it boots up with the lists in 
the same status as they were at the end of the previous session. 

Editing lists is simple and straightforward. The change-a-list com- 
mand can be used to edit any part of any list or to change one's responses 
to any of the four parameter queries. 

The delete-a-list command erases from disk the list that the user 
specifies, along with any information pertaining to it. Since this com- 
mand does away with a list forever, the user is asked to confirm this 
choice. 

The next two menu choices — timed list and immediate execution — are 
essentially the same. The only difference between them is that the timed 
list execution command takes advantage of either a California Computer 
Systems card or a Thunderclock card in an Apple II to begin the 
Teleminder retrieval sequence automatically, whereas immediate execu- 
tion is begun by the investor. In either case, Teleminder dials the local 
access number, logs on to the system, gets the information it was in- 
structed to retrieve from each active list, logs off, and then sends the in- 
formation out to a printer, to disk, or both. 

Watching Teleminder in action is a pleasure. The program runs 
smoothly and makes excellent use of its time on Dow Jones. It even 
keeps a record of how much time was spent on-line, making it possible 
for the investor to calculate the cost of retrieving information. 

Teleminder' s communications capability turns the Apple into a 
semidumb, semismart terminal. It logs you on to Dow Jones automatical- 
ly and asks you whether you want to go into the database, the news 
database, or one of the other Dow Jones databases. If you choose news, 
you're prompted to supply the appropriate symbol or category code. 
Teleminder then collects headlines for the symbol or category you've 
specified. It continues to collect headlines until it has retrieved all of 
them or run out of memory in which to store them (there's room in 
memory for about fifty-five headlines— about five pages of Dow Jones 
information). 

If you want to retrieve more than five pages of information on a topic, 
you must specifically request that additional pages of headlines be 
retrieved. To retrieve the news stories themselves, you must key in the 
two-character Dow Jones identifier displayed on the headline. 
Teleminder will then get that information from Dow Jones and either 
display it on-screen or print it out. 

Pressing control-Q from within the communications module brings 
up the quotes entry screen. Up to five quotes can be retrieved at one 
time. When the appropriate symbols have been entered, Teleminder for- 
mats the screen to display the quotes; retrieves and displays the high, 
low, close, and volume information; and calculates the amount of change 
that's occurred since the previous close. 

To accommodate eighty columns of Dow Jones information on the 
Apple's forty-column screen, Teleminder flips between the first forty 
columns of data and the second, rather than wrapping the data around on- 
screen. This feature keeps display screens neat and easy to read; you just 
have to remember to flip the screens. An on-screen reminder that there 
are indeed more than forty columns of information to look at would be 
nice here. 

In terminal mode, Teleminder provides access to any Dow Jones 
database and prints out any information retrieved. An 8,800-character 
buffer stores the captured information while the investor is on-line; this 
information can be printed or cleared out later on. Unfortunately, the 
buffer captures not only the information from the databases but also the 
information requests themselves. An editing feature or instructions on 
how to use a utility program to edit out this machine talk would be a good 
addition. 



Like most of the programs we've examined, Teleminder provides for 
basic file creation, system maintenance, and housekeeping from within 
its utilities module. System configuration, printer setup, data disk for- 
matting, backup, and optional clock-time setting are all handled 
from there. 

Teleminder also offers four unique utilities. The first of these allows 
the investor to print, erase, or display on-screen any news story or 
stories that have been saved to disk. The second can be used to print out 
the most recent set of quotes that have been stored on disk. The third 
utility, print headlines, permits the investor to print out the most recent 
set of retrieved and stored headlines. The fourth allows you to transfer 
quotes to a data disk, thus facilitating the creation of a historic quotes file 
containing up to a thousand quotes per disk. 

Though it's easy to build a historic quotes file using Teleminder, it's 
not quite as simple to take advantage of one. More specifically, if you're 
using some other Dow Jones quote-based program, such as a technical 
charting program or portfolio accounting system, Teleminder' s 
news/headline retrieval abilities still work fine, but you can't expect to 
use the quotes you've retrieved via Teleminder'' s quote-fetch option— 
they are not compatible. Fortunately, Teleware has come up with a 
remedy for this serious drawback. 

The remedy is TelePak 1, a utility program priced at $30. TelePak 1 
takes the historic quotes files and makes them usable with Dow Jones 
software, 1-2-3, Multiplan, and VisiCalc. (An option in the system con- 
figuration section that would automatically execute the quotes transfer 
routines would be a real plus. This way, an investor couldn't forget to do 
the transfer and lose the data that was stored in the daily quotes file when 
Teleminder was used again.) 

It's safe to say that Teleminder is an exceptional program for any in- 
vestor. If you want to use Teleminder to create a historic quotes file that's 
compatible with technical charting or portfolio accounting programs, 
you'll need to purchase TelePak 1 as well, but if you're interested only in 
news/headline retrieval capabilities, the original program is all you need. 

All in all, Teleminder merits the Buttonwood Apples seal of approval 
for its appealing program design and superior documentation.

CONGRAYULATIONS! 

Well, pilgrim, it seems you've made it to 1984 
intact despite everything the world could throw at 
you. That's no mean feat these days, but you prob- 
ably don't need to be reminded of that. Or of what 
George Orwell predicted, or of what the govern- 
ment may have in store for us. Just forget you read 
that. Relax. Put your feet up. Comfy? Good. . . . 

What we're going to do now is work through 
some of those little problems that are bothering 
you so you can concentrate on the better things in 
life. Let's see now. . . . Remember last year's of- 
fice party? You swore you'd never do that again 
. . . Well, don't worry. Even if you do, nobody will 
notice, and even if they do, they probably won't 
remember. They didn't last year, did they? What 
else? Ah! New Year's resolutions right? You're go- 
ing to quit smoking again, cut down on your drink- 
ing, start working out regularly, lose weight, learn 
how to play racquetball, take more interest in local 
affairs, and stop watching Three's Company if it 
kills you. It probably will. 

Just kidding. Those are all wonderful aspira- 
tions, and we're behind you— puffing and pant- 
ing—all the way. But now it's time to talk of finer 
things, of drives and DOS and nesting loops, of 
variables and strings. Mostly about Softalk, 
though. 

That's right. Softalk. Probably one of the best 
things ever to happen to you. But you knew that all 
along. Well here's something maybe you didn't 
know. Softalk is getting better. Impossible, you 
say? Well, perhaps, but check this out: 

Starting in January, Softalk will be available to 
Canadian subscribers the same way it is to 
Americans, including the free trial subscription for 
new subscribers who send their Apple serial 
number and address to our Canadian Subs 
department. 

Also in January, Softdisk is going to start 
publishing our program listings on disk so you 
don't have to worry about spraining your button- 
pushing fingers while keying in our micro master- 
pieces. See their ad on page 226. 

Not bad, huh? And we're not even going to 
mention all the other goodies we have in store for 
you. Some of life's greatest pleasures come in the 
form of pleasant surprises. 
Softalk. We do it all for you.

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? 

Are you tired of waiting for DOS to load and save 
files? Are you tired of waiting for DOS to finish so 
you can type again? Are you tired of waiting for 
your printer' When you buy DIVERSI-DOS", 
by Bill Basham, you won't have to wait any more! 
Here's why: 

\. DOS speed up: Apple DOS 3.3 takes 18 disk 
revolutions to read a single track, whereas 
DIVERSI-DOS reads or writes a track in just 2 
revolutions. This speeds up file processing 
tremendously (see table). 

2. Keyboard Buffer: DIVERSI-DOS allows you 
to type ahead, as fast as you can, without missing 
a single character. 

3, Print Buffer: DIVERSI-DOS can use a RAM 
card (16K 128K) to temporarily save characters 
before they are printed. Thus, your computer 
won't have to wait for your printer to finish. 

4 DDMOVER: DIVERSI-DOS can now be 

moved to a RAM card to increase the available 
memory in a BASIC program. 

DIVERSI-DOS, the QUADRUPLE utility, 
requires a 48K Apple II, 11+ or e with DOS 3.3. A 
simple, menu driven installation program is 
included on the un protected disk. So what are 
you waiting for?

THE FIRST OF ITS KIND 

LETTERWRITER 



Typing a letter is not the job for a Word Processor The power you need is not there, and the power you don't is getting in your way 
slowing things down. To type a letter nnore efficiently than on a typewriter you must have a program designed for that specific pur- 
pose. You need LETTERWRITER. To our knowledge that is the first program that has been fully designed to meet the requirements 
of letter typing. It is therefore also the best, and we are willing to guarantee that with LETTERWRITER you can outperform any other 
software in typing a normal letter no matter what the price. Read the specs below and you will understand why we are so confident! 



FORMATTING 

All vertical and horizontal spacing can be set for any style of 
business or personal letter This means that you can concen- 
trate on the typing and forget tabs and linefeeds, everything 
gets to the right place by itself. 

TEXT ENTRY & EDITING 

Because LETTERWRITER is self-formatting, and complex 
tables or other structures as a rule are not part of letters, text 
can be entered in a dump fashion, much the same way as a 
dictation to a secretary Full editing features are of course in- 
cluded, but there is no need to "see what you get" as you 
know that already from setting the formatting. An 80 column 
card is totally unnecessary Another advantage is that typing 
and editing is in the same mode and doesn't require any 
switching. 

OPERATION 

LETTERWRITER is an easy program to master with all com- 
mands available to the user always explained on the screens. 
After reading the manual for 15 minutes you should be ready 
to start, and the first perfect letter should come out from the 
printer in another 15 minutes. This is possible only because 
LETTERWRITER is designed not to be a sophisticated Word 
Processor but an efficient tool for producing letters. 

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS 

Apple II + or He with 48K and 1 disc drive. 



NAME & ADDRESS FILE 

Time and efforts are often wasted on looking up correct spell- 
ing of the name, and accurate address. LETTERWRITER has 
therefore an accumulative file for more than 400 records, 
which can be accessed directly A search typically takes 2 
seconds, and can be alphabetical, numerical or any combin- 
ation. As there is no re-typing involved the name and address 
IS always correct. 

STANDARD PHRASES 

Certain parts of letters involve a lot of repetitive typing. It is 
therefore useful to have a selection of phrases to call up. With 
LETTERWRITER you make your own phrases and signing 
patterns, to be used for different types of letters. 

OTHER FEATURES 

Name and address on letterhead or envelope or both; Left 
and right justification, underlining and dummy spaces; Coun- 
try in address format; Mail-Merge with manual selection; Util- 
ity programs for making back-up disk copies and purging 
Name file, and more. 

INTRODUCTORY OFFER 

LETTERWRITER is presently available at selected software 
dealers or directly from I NNOVA Systems for the special price 
of $45.00. At this low price it is a standard complement to any 
Word Processor and an obvious choice for those only inter- 
ested in letter typing. Still hesitating? Now about our guaran- 
tee! Should you for any reason not be satisfied with LETTER- 
WRITER and return the program disk within 15 days, we will 
refund your money provided the disk has not been copied.

COMPRESS/EXPAND 

A IMUST FOR ANY SERIOUS PROGRAMMER 

Most Apple* picture files take up to 34 
disk sectors of storage. This limits the 
number of pictures that can be saved on 
one disk. The SANSOFT PLUS COIVIPRESS/ 
EXPAND system allows you to process any 
standard picture file and compress it into 
a much smaller file that requires less disk 
space. Some pictures can be compressed by 
as much as 90% requiring only a few sec- 
tors depending on picture complexity. Since 
less sectors are used. Pictures load faster 
requiring less disk time. A small routine 
requiring less than 256 bytes can be load- 
ed into anyone of several locations and be 
called from your programs allowing amaz- 
ing results as your high quality pictures 
appear in less time with NO loss of quali- 
ty. This program comes on an unprotected 
disk that can be copied and backed up.

lalk about Ibmorrow 



JANUARY 1984 



145 



COMPILED By Tonny cear 



At the end of 1981 , Softalk asked a number of people at the forefront 
of the Apple world to look into the future and share with readers what 
they saw. Many of them told of things that seemed surprising and far- 
fetched at the time. In retrospect, it seems even more surprising that 
many of the things that were pondered then have already become 
realities. 

It's a couple of years down the line now. Once more, Softalk has ven- 
tured to ask the cogniscenti of Appledom to become seers. But seers 
usually speak only of what will be— our voices speak also of the 
challenges we face right now. 

The points of view are various. Each individual offers a unique 
perspective on the changes taking place in the microcomputer world. 
Note well, for these are the movers and shakers— together they will 
shape the way those changes take place. 

Certain themes appear to emerge. A new breed of computer is on the 
horizon— one that many will be able to relate to more easily, one that can 
respond more like a person, and one that won't cost any more even 
though it offers more. Along with that will come some stiffer 
competition— the bigger, more powerful companies will try to eclipse 
many smaller ones. We're warned to hold on for the dreaded industry 
shakeup. 

But, from all this, standards will evolve that will make it easier for 
creative programmers to reach the growing number of users and the 
expanded vertical markets. There's concern over the effectiveness of our 
education establishment to teach the skills that will enable our boys and 
girls to play an effective part in our increasingly information-processed 
society. 

Finally, there are dreams of games yet to be written, fantasies we have 
yet to create, for which the technology is barely within our grasp. Like a 
partially rendered connect-the-dots picture, the future takes shape 
through imagination. 




Stan Goldberg 

Up to now the software industry has provided real creativity, a lot of it 
from companies that operate like cottage industries. Now the creative 
people who started out on their own must find environments they can ex- 
ist in while still being creative, without having to be party to more estab- 
lishment-type companies that might crush their creativity. That's going 
to be a big challenge. Without question, many small companies will go 
out of business. The distributors in this industry have preordained it by 
the way they have chosen to define their margins. The actions of the re- 
tail industry people have set the stage for the massive shake-up that we're 
seeing now. As a result, we'll be seeing fewer software products on the 
market, but the ones we'll see will be of higher quality. 

Schools in the inner city are not doing all they should to introduce 
their students to computers. They must, if our society is to be viable and 
remain strong economically. This is an area in which the microcomputer 
industry might be able to do some good, a way we could pay back society 
for giving us the possibilities for making a good living, a way to show 
our gratitude by helping in these areas. It's our responsibility as citizens, 
and it's also the responsibility of the schools and die people in the irmer 
cities, to make their needs known. Back in the early sixties, all of us 
growing up felt that tomorrow was going to be better. In the last twenty 
years we've lost that feeling. The population as a whole doesn't think 
that tomorrow is going to be better. I think computers can give us a 
chance to rekindle that old American dream, but I don't think it's going 
to be easy. 




Bruce Artwick 

Christmas 1983 kind of marked the end of an era for what I call the 1977 
class of computers, such as the Apple, the Atari, even the Commodore 
64— the simple one-megaHertz 6502 type of machines of the 48K to 64K 
range. Toward the middle and end of 1984, we'll see a new class of com- 
puter with five to ten times the processing power and with graphics dis- 
plays that are much better. 

We can expect to see more in the way of custom large-scale integra- 
tion, especially in the area of graphics controllers that bring high perfor- 
mance at a low price. I don't think that especially means thirty-two-bit, 
but high performance sixteen-bit and also custom graphics chips. We 
will see chips that will have built-in spectre generators and shading 
devices. 

I think a few upcoming machines from Apple are going to fall in the 
thousand-dollar price range and those will start coming out next year. 
But Apple n is not a dead machine. It's going to find its place a little fur- 
ther down the price scale because performance- wise it's not going to be 
able to compete with the newer machinery. A lower-priced version that 
is rumored to be in development— a repackaged Apple II with not as 
many or no expansion slots, and more custom LSI, a smaller package 
selling for about $600 or $700— might happen in the coming year. 

I think it's Apple's goal to develop something vastly superior to their 
old model, and then have it be in their product line for many years. In- 
stead of making a lot of little changes along the way, Apple would rather 
take gigantic steps all at once, and I think that's a good approach. 

In software especially for entertainment, the emphasis is going to be 
on more depth ratiier than on speed: better graphics, more sophistication 
in game strategy, and much better sound. A lot of game designers are 
having problems when faced with a new machine because all the tricks 
they use to make their regular games go so fast aren't needed. The ques- 
tion is not how to squeeze all the processing power and memory out of it, 
but what to do with the processing power available. Games that give you 
a big world inside the machine to explore are more possible with lots of 
memory and processing power. 




John ScuUey 

I think one of the important trends will be the thirty-two-bit processors. 
It has started with Lisa, the first really affordable thirty-two-bit-processor 
microcomputer. Apple will have other products, too, at lower price 
points. We expect that other people will also have thirty-two-bit 
processors. 

We believe that the thirty-two-bit-processor products are probably 
going to be the standard for the rest of this decade, particularly with the 
business market. They may very well play an important role in the 
consumer market too, because of the power of thirty-two-bit hardware 
and the amount of firmware we're building into our products. 

Something new that is going to be important with thirty-two-bit prod- 
ucts that hasn't been apparent with eight- or sixteen-bit products is that 
the application environment will reside on top of the operating system. 
And the application environment will have all the hooks in it that pro- 
grammers need to develop their own programs, but it will allow them to 
develop programs with greater simplicity. We think this will probably 
open up a whole new range of software opportunities, both in the busi- 
ness market, in colleges, in schools, and at home. 

The Apple n will be an important mainstream product for at least an- 
other four or five years. We're spending a lot of time and money to keep 
it up to date, bringing to it many of the things we're developing with our 



146 



JANUARY 1984 



higher performance products. 

The fact that the computer industry is going through a shake-out right 
now isn't surprising. Every other large, fast-growing consumer-based 
industry has gone through a shake-out of some sort. I expect that the 
shake -out is going to take a lot of the volatility out of the industry. While 
there are virtually hundreds of different vendors offering personal com- 
puters, there really are very few that are offering significant 
breakthrough products. 

We're going to support the MS-DOS option with Lisa over the next 
year, and recently we authorized the development of an MS-DOS acces- 
sory by Rana Systems that will work with the Apple II. We want to pro- 
vide gateways for people who want some level of compatibility between 
Apple and IBM products. But we don't really believe that's where the 
market is going to take us over the next couple of years. The technology 
isn't frozen; it moves very rapidly. 

We think Apple's role m the industry is to be the prime innovator 
technology. It's a role that IBM doesn't need to play because of its size; 
it can wait and see how successful Apple is and decide whether it wants 
to participate in a market, as it did with personal computers in the first 
place. Apple wants to play a very major role in determining what the op- 
erating standards are going to be for thirty-two-bit personal computers, 
because there we can be active— rather than reactive in trying to catch up 
in the sixteen-bit world. 




Gene Sprouse 

It's coming down to a race with very few horses in it. Certain compro- 
mises that IBM made in the Junior will make that machine less desirable 
for a lot of people, so I don't think it's going to hurt Apple, but it could 
hurt a lot of other people. 

Still, the PCjr will bring respectability into the market. I don't see 
this development as ominous at all; they're going to open the market for 
everybody. They're going to make us more legitimate. 

The only thing that will come close to an operating standard will be 
IBM's. I think it's a crummy standard, but it exists: MS-DOS will be- 
come a standard whether you like it or not. 

In software you're going to see more and more of the big players 
coming in. Many smaller entrepreneurial specialty software houses will 
be bought by the big guys. You'll see that all over the place, all the en- 
tertainment companies— RCA, CBS, Milton-Bradley— are buying up 
many small software businesses. Once the controlling companies get 
large enough, innovation will be stifled and quick reactions to the market 
will become difficult to get because more layers of bureaucracy will 
exist. 

Computers will cut down a heck of a lot of commuting because a fair 
amount of people will be working at home. Telecommunications is going 
to become a bigger and bigger thing, especially with computers in the 
home. 

I think the next rage is going to be home-controlled robots. A robot 
that does the floors will open the market. Homes will have to be designed 
for robots. Designers will include circuitry in the walls, plugs, and other 
things to permit other kinds of control with or without the robots. 




Scott Adams 

I think there's going to be a bit of an industry shakedown in hardware. In 
the future we may only have five brands of machines to choose from. It 
looks pretty obvious that the IBM PCjr is going directly to the Apple He 
market. IBM's going to give Apple a definite run for the money with that 
machine. It's already happened as a matter of course that IBM has set a 
standard in the industry. Eighty percent of business software being writ- 



ten today is MS-DOS-compatible. 

Once the giant steps in, it sets the standard. I think that's good for the 
industry. It makes it harder for others to retain an individual image, but 
the more standards there are the easier it is to bring out software. 

Apple is starting to become the Cadillac of machines, but less and less 
of the market share is carrying it. 

Twenty-five or thirty years from now computers will be completely 
accepted. They'll be just another tool, like pencils, paper, or calculators. 
The computer is going to be the equalizer, bringing people to the same 
information level. You can go out and buy a Vic-20 now for eighty dol- 
lars, the TIs sell for fifty dollars. I think computer power will be afford- 
able by all. 




Bill Budge 

Computers are obviously going to get more powerful in the next five 
years. I personally would like to build huge programs that actually do 
useful things. The home is the perfect place for larger expert systems be- 
cause there you want a program that doesn't require a lot of knowledge 
to use. 

There's certainly a trend toward building plug-ins for the Apple 11. 
Right now the Apple II is sort of useful, but it's got a life span. There are 
some things being developed now to make sure the Apple will still sell, 
but as manufacturers can build better systems cheaper this may change. 
They'll have to do things to upgrade the Apple 11 because of all the soft- 
ware out there. People will stop writing software for the Apple II at a 
certain point when it becomes impossible to get a better word processor 
or a better database. People will be migrating to other computer systems, 
to more powerful machines. Within five years, everyone who has an Ap- 
ple II now will have a Macintosh; it's better. 

In twenty years, modems will be built in with color graphics. There 
will be peripherals like you can't imagine. The only reason the mouse 
exists is because you can't tell the computer what you want it to do. In 
twenty years, you'll just talk to your computer. Your whole desk will be 
a screen. You'll be able to write on it, type on it. You'll be able to see a 
whole document laid out in pages. The screen will be really big or hori- 
zontal, or maybe even like a whole wall at an angle. 




Bob Christiansen 

Things will continue to be good for software people; no matter how hard 
the times get for hardware people, software will always be in demand. 
And people who are coming out with small computers are going to have 
a lot of trouble. 

The influence of the Apple II and He will probably drop off 
dramatically in 1984; Apple's best hope is that the Macintosh will do 
well. Obviously, the Lisa hasn't come up to expectations so far. I hear a 
lot of enthusiastic things coming out of Apple, and those of us who are 
Apple-wise certainly hope that Apple continues to do well. They've been 
one of the best companies for recognizing and appreciating efforts of 
third-party software and peripheral manufacturers. Continuing that at- 
titude will go a long way toward Apple's succeeding with whatever hard- 
ware it comes out with. That attitude is one of the main reasons Apple 
has been so successful. 

With an overall decrease in computer anxiety and other phobias and 
fables about computers, more people will be coming into the market. 
This will help create a much better vertical market. The game market 
will pretty much go to the larger companies and you'll get poorer games 
in general as a result. On the other hand, several games will be better. 
There will always be a place for very good versions of the more 
sophisticated computer games. Playing games over modem, games with 



JANUARY 1984 



147 



really sensational graphics and quick response, is a very natural and 
likely way for the technology and general game market to improve. 

I think the computer's impact on our daily routine will be gradual 
rather than an overnight phenomenon. Until a younger computer-wise 
generation starts to run their own households, it will be very difficult for 
the public to accept shopping or communicating by computer. 

I'm not sure computers are going to contribute a great deal to our 
ability to communicate, but they will allow us, perhaps, if we choose, to 
conrmiunicate in a more effective manner. 




Mark Simonsen 

The general trend for the future will be smaller, faster, and cheaper on 
everything. 

We'll see more memory in microcomputers generally. Pretty soon 
128K is going to look like 64K does now. Bit-mapped text screens like 
on the Lisa will become more of a necessity too. There probably won't 
be such a thing as a text screen per se. There will be higher resolution 
monitors like on the Lisa. You'll also be able to have color at every 
pixel, unlike the way the Apple n now works. Whatever somebody will 
dream up and integrate into any of the other new computers, somebody 
else will develop a board that you can put in your Apple n to closely ap- 
proximate that new feature. 

If it's not possible to run Apple II software on the Macintosh, 
somebody will certainly write an emulator for it. 




Mark Pelczarski 



With the Apple, the trend will continue toward much more friendly 
software— very easy to use for a person who doesn't know anything 
about computers. I think we'll see easy-to-use, Lisa-type stuff on the 
Macintosh and the Apple lie. That's going to be the biggest trend in 
terms of software. 

I tend to think that Apple's in a real good position. I have had no bet- 
ter dealings with any computer vendor than with Apple. And I think the 
IBM machines are very disappointing compared to what they could have 
been. If you compare the Apple machines and the IBM machines, the 
Apples are far superior and more advanced technically. 

Every computer is going to be hooked up to a phone within ten years, 
easily. There'll be a lot of local networks all over the place, and probably 
networks of networks. Being able to communicate with people and leave 
messages and get special interest groups together via networks would be 
a way for p)eople to get interested in solving a problem, to get together to 
share information and work together. 

Right now computers are a significant new toy. They're very useful 
in a small business or for people who work free-lance for one reason or 
another. But most people don't need computers. When we get to the 
stage where there's a lot of networking involved, electronic mail and so 
forth, then you start adding a lot of new capabilities that people wUl ac- 
tually be able to use. 



Paul Warme 

Software development is significantly behind hardware development. I 



don't think we've tapped the potentials of even the least powerful com- 
puters. 

As the market develops we'll see an increased concentration on spe- 
cialized software. Right now most software is very general, and because 
it's general it's not as easy to use. As we concentrate on specific applica- 
tions, the software can be tailored more to the user and it will become 
easier to use. The breadth of users will increase, but there will be more 
users who have less experience. 

The limiting factor in using a computer now is the rate of input and 
output. I think that voice input will become a major form of input in the 
near future, but even that will be limited by speed of input; so various 
forms of shorthand will arise. First, these may take the form of short 
vocalized sound cues, grunts, or whistles. 

Some people will become virtuosos in using sounds to input com- 
mands to a computer; they'll be able to do so very quickly. Consequent- 
ly, there'll be a desire for an even closer linking of the computer to the 
human brain. In the long term, computers will be directly connected to 
certain nerves— already we've learned that it's possible to control artifi- 
cial limbs by tapping some of the nerves in the arm. 




Ron Unrath 

I think there are enough users now in the marketplace that it will be cost- 
effective to reduce prices, and we'll see a general trend of prices coming 
down across the board. 

In the next few years a good deal of the work force will be working 
out of their homes on microcomputers hooked to companies via telecom- 
munications. Telelinks to banks, grocery stores, shopping centers, and 
department stores will proliferate dramatically. The bottom line is that 
we'll be able to do more than ever from the comfort of our own homes, 
via the computer. 

Widespread computer use is certainly going to start in the upper in- 
come groups, just as television did in the fifties. But it will filter down as 
prices drop, and we'll see it spread into more and more homes.

Ed Zaron 

The big issue to me is the marketing situation. A hot technical product 
can still make it these days, but not unless you have a couple of million 
dollars behind you to help market it, as is the case with Lotus's 1-2-3. 
The big battles this year have to do with getting shelf space and trying to 
capture the market at the level of the mass merchandisers as well as the 
independent retail stores. 

There hasn't been enough emphasis on using the computer as a com- 
munications device in the home. Telecommunications is going to be a 
very important area. 

Andy Thompson 

There will be a great sophistication of software. Lisa is the prototype. 
There'll be much more intelligent information processors, database pro- 
grams, and engineering programs and more sophisticated data input rela- 
tional query systems and user interfaces. 

Users will be more able to describe exactiy what they want computers 



148 



S O F T A L l< 



JANUARY 1984 



to do. Data entry will be much closer to the way people think or talk. 
Preprocessors will be able to figure out what users want from simple dic- 
tionaries of natural language input statements. We will see more intelli- 
gent data entry tools in general. 

The technology for voice recognition is around, but I don't think it'll 
come around in a big way in 1984— although it will by 1985. Who 
wouldn't rather talk to a machine than type to it? 

The computer will become an absolute necessity as opposed to simply 
a convenience. I also think we'll see an increasing trend toward people 
doing their work outside of the traditional business environment. People 
with jobs based upon knowledge and access to knowledge bases won't 
need to be organized around large corporate environments. 

The thing about predicting the future is that some of the things that 
seem outlandish will come true, and other things that seem straightfor- 
ward may never occur. 




Bert Kersey 

I'd like to see typesetting become as cheap as word processing. I also 
wish floppy disks would die in favor of some more practical medium, 
something more durable that you can throw around and not worry about, 
like we do paper. I'd like to see a grammar checker built right into the 
microcomputer, and printers with switches on the outside for enhanced 
type or different fonts. I'd like to see 2-D movies in books, and animated 
advertisements. You could flip through a magazine, and looking at an ad 
would be like looking at a movie. 




Terry Bradley 

In the long run there has to be a cheaper way of getting software, 
especially entertainment software, into the hands of the end user. One 
way would be through systems that use a master computer with all the 
games on it. The customer could ask for a game and it would be 
manufactured on the spot. The documentation could come off of a 
printer. 

It's claimed that every fifty years we make as much progress in tech- 
nology as the whole planet has made in its entire history to that point. 
Many times a product is outdated as it's coming off the drawing board. 
Atari, when it produced the 600, found itself with a machine already sur- 
passed by existing technology. 

Standards are starting to emerge in personal computing. When we fi- 
nally settle on two or three hardware standards, we'll start to see soft- 
ware being standardized. Five years ago, this would not have been desir- 
able. Standardizing an infant industry early cuts off any real growth. But 
where would the light bulb industry be if they never started standardiz- 
ing? Where would the automobile and tire industries be if they hadn't 
started standardizing? 




Steve Wozniak 

Within the next year or so a lot of standards will have to evolve. The 
swing these days is toward IBM because people know that will be a for- 
sure standard— in operating systems, for one. Technology now makes it 
doubtful that the most efficient standard was chosen even for things like 



the RS-232 connection. It may be that printers are standardizing, becom- 
ing Centronics-compatible, and it might take several years for these is- 
sues to evolve fully. 

Obviously anyone that sees or uses the Lisa/Macintosh user interface 
style realizes that it will be the only choice for computers by the end of 
the decade. And this is a good direction for the Apple n to be in— it's 
happening already with the use of a lot of hi-res screens, even for text in 
different fonts, treating the screen as bits rather than characters, and with 
windowing. It's more efficient. 

One problem we've got is that there are about twenty video modes in 
the Apple lie. In the Lisa or Macintosh there's one video mode and it 
does everything. That's a level of simplification that becomes very af- 
fordable when RAM costs come down. You really will want the one 
video mode and just have graphics and text all on the same screen. 
Performancewise the eight-bit machine would just be running those high- 
speed versions of the processor as a way to get higher performance. 

For nearly ten years, the cost of the typical system that the end user 
wants has remained about constant, but the functions have gone up. It's 
pretty obvious that the prices of microcomputer systems aren't going to 
go up in the next year to two years, but by two years from now 256K wUl 
be the standard in every single micro. 

Taking a look at the major peripherals on the lie that are doing well 
gives a good idea of the directions it could go in. First there's higher 
speed, like the Saturn accelerator board provides, better eighty-column 
capability, and some built-in accessories. In the Apple EI line we ought to 
head toward things like speech, music generation, all the arcade 
boards— but I don't think sprites are needed just yet. 

In ten years we'll be able to have the equivalent of the Apple II for 
maybe a couple of hundred bucks. In other words, we won't be spending 
more than a couple of hundred bucks per student. There is no way to 
imagine a thousand-dollar computer per student, because today there is 
nothing available that's near a thousand dollars for students. 

We could actually get by okay without too many computers in school. 
I hate to say it, but the computer is not the only key or the only way to 
live your life. Only a small segment of jjeople will have to talk very well 
to computers, and they'll be largely computer programmers and develop- 
ers. Other than that, we should be able to get the basics in school. Will 
computers make IQs go up? I have doubts, it's not clear to me. 




Doug Carlston 

The future is reasonably foreseeable, at least in the short run. Computers 
are going to be used for a pretty predictable set of uses, mainly because 
computers aren't really that novel an idea— they've been around for a 
hundred years. What we will experience is a change in their level of 
penetration into our lives. 

One thing that isn't happening and isn't likely to happen in a major 
way is people working at home and using the electronics to communicate 
with the workplace. People will use electronic mail to the extent that they 
previously used the regular mail. They'll live in remote places if they're 
oriented to living in remote places. Most people don't find that choice 
particularly appealing; they want a workplace. The suggestion that mi- 
crocomputers will be changing the cities because people are going to 
move out of the urban environment is probably a lot of bunk. 

In a lot of ways the most dangerous consequence of the computer's 
evolution is the segregation of the population into classes based on an 
ability to control their envirormient. People who understand computers 
will have an enormous advantage over people who don't. People who 
can control computers will have an even greater advantage. More and 
more substantive work is being processed by computers, and people who 
are uncomfortable or unfamiliar with them are being excluded from the 
work marketplace in job after job. That creates an enormous barrier, but 
not a novel one. The same thing happened with literacy when ours be- 
came a written society. People had to be able to read to hold major jobs; 
the illiterate found themselves at an increasing disadvantage. That was 
the initial impetus for mass education. It became apparent that if you 



JANUARY 1984 



149 



couldn't have reading skills you were at an enormous disadvantage in the 
marketplace. Computer literacy is of a different kind, but it works the 
same way. 

The computer revolution is novel only in one respect: in this country, 
and in this country alone, you find that an enormous percentage of the 
successful software programmers are self-taught. And it's because the 
school system is incapable of teaching them. In other countries it's rea- 
sonable to expect to get a computer education through the school system. 
Apparently, that's not a reasonable expectation in the United States. 

We aren't turning out a large number of people who have the basic 
tools to understand the computer revolution and make proper use of it. 
Americans are always looking for an easy way to do things. Learning 
higher math, for example, involves a lot of hard work. Even if you find 
a way to make it a little easier, it's still going to be a lot of hard work. To 
the extent that sugar coating and shortcuts are valued as solutions, people 
are going to be misled; they'll expect these simplifications to make hard 
subjects easy, and hard subjects are never going to be easy. Even if you 
understand the principle behind finding areas under curves, you're still 
going to have to learn how to do it technically. Understanding the prin- 
ciples behind some technique gives you a framework for organizing in- 
formation, but there is still an enormous amount of straight information 
you have to learn to do it. 




Bob Clardy 

During this last year I have seen people buying micros who had never 
before considered getting one. They are people who have no interest in 
progranmiing whatsoever. The era of the user has really hit. Two or 
three years ago if you bought a computer you probably had it in your 
mind to do programming. Now people that are strictly users are buying 
them. As a result software will get easier, simpler, and more idiotproof. 

This is going to change the industry— it's already begun. The ads 
aren't aimed at the hobbyist anymore; they're aimed at the users who 
don't want to know much about their systems. 

At the same time there's more effort to get computer literacy into the 
high schools and grade schools. This effort is noble, but it hasn't been 
very successful so far. It's disorganized and schools don't seem to have 
any idea where they can get good educational software. 

We're becoming an information society, an information-processing 
society. The schools aren't preparing enough kids well enough for the 
large number of jobs that wUl require working with computers. 

Education is getting better, but it's still way behind where society 
itself already is. An enormous number of people in our society are al- 
ready converted to being information processors. We no longer make 
products; we massage information and put it back out there. Hopefully 
the schools, the newspapers, and the magazines will catch up with this 
information distribution problem. 



John Victor 

The school market has pretty much taken itself out as a viable market for 
educational software. There's no way a vendor can make money selling 
to the schools. The people who have a chance of making any money are 
selling educational software to home users. This means the manufac- 
turers themselves have to encourage educational home use of the com- 
puter rather than institutional use. In the long run schools are going to 
have to use the same home software everybody else is using, set up not 
with the classroom in mind but with home use in mind. 

Eventually, this will mean that schooling will be more like home 
education. The classroom method of instruction is probably the least ef- 



fective method we have at our disposal. Schools— and parents— are 
wedded to it from blind tradition. Schools aren't given much choice in a 
lot of cases, politically, to break out of it. 

There are two conflicting theories. If you define your educational 
objectives sufficiently, the better your definition the more rigid your 
educational system is going to be. In the B.F. Skinner approach, you're 
essentially teaching kids to memorize and have very clearly defined ob- 
jectives. On the other side is the Dewey approach, with very vaguely de- 
fined objectives; education is almost accidental. There's always going to 
be a conflict in education between those two poles. 

The conventional wisdom in the computer industry is way over on the 
Dewey side. We're getting educational products that have very poorly 
defined educational objectives. I term these products fluffware. Whether 
they teach anything is a very serious question. For people to know 
they're getting somewhere, there has to be a better definition of what's 
being taught. That's going to push it back, to some extent, toward the 
Skirmerian approach. 

We'll still see both approaches. Nobody wants to get tagged with the 
label "drill and practice," because drill and practice is currently 
anathema. But if you're transmitting a set body of knowledge, like the 
rules of algebra, having people discover a rule of algebra by accidental 
play is a time-consuming process. It can better be taught straight out. 
The discovery approach works well for certain kinds of things; it does 
not work well for straight transmission of factual information— a pro- 
grammed instruction approach. You could teach the ground rules of, 
say, international relations by programmed instruction. Then you could 
use simulation to teach the process. To have the student learn both the 
ground rules and the process by simulation is very inefficient. 




Virginia Lawrence 

I have great fears for women in computing. We all know that if you have 
a boy, he has a friend for life in the computer. Girls are not signing up 
for computer classes and computer camp. I think that's simply because 
ads are showing more girls than boys now. Parents should start pushing 
girls into it a little more or they will be left behind. 

It's very hard to reach the homes to get the parents to encourage girls, 
or even to think it would be as important for a girl. I would like to see 
enough computers in schools so girls could learn programming, along 
with a feeling for what they could program. Girls should not necessarily 
just be pushed along with the boys in the same direction. 

If some computer work could be made compulsory in every school, 
computers might be a step toward solving problems that separate the 
classes. 




Roger Wagner 

There's a misconception on the public's part about how much they know 
about computers and how much they need to know. People draw analo- 
gies to things like cars and stereos, saying that computers should be as 
easy to use. What they forget is that high schools put sixteen-year-olds in 
driver's training for a semester. But with computers, some people either 
see them as a threat or they want to understand them instantly. They for- 
get that they don't comprehend anything in life instantly. If you want to 
learn Spanish, is it really a universal injustice that you have to spend two 
years to learn how to speak it? Is it the fault of language teaching that it 
hasn't been reduced to a five-minute process? Over the next fifteen 
years, when all the people now learning to use computers in school grow 
up they'll look back at magazine articles about how hard the stuff was to 
use and they just won't comprehend it.

Warren Robinett 

I think one reason personal computers have been so popular is that they 
provide an interaction that is a function of how much sensory stimulation 
is possible in a short period of time. That's one reason that video games 
are so attractive to kids. When you cut out the colors you cut out a lot of 
that. This is just based on my gut feeling about what's wonderful and 
what's not. Color is important. 

I'm interested in interactive graphical simulation. I think that phrase 
sums up what graphic video games and a lot of other personal computer 
programs are all about. I include VisiCalc and word processors under 
that umbrella. 

VisiCalc is a graphical simulation. It's a simulation of two things: It 
has a space larger than the screen, so you can get rows and columns that 
continue off the screen; and it's a simulation of a network of equations. 
Word processing is a simulation of a typewriter combined with scissors 
and paste. And just about every video game you can name is a simulation 
of something. 

Interactive graphical simulation describes the most important, the 
most interesting, and the most successful microcomputer programs and 
video games of the past five years. And there are still unexplored realms 
to be simulated that will prove to be just as exciting, if not more so. 

It seems that video games are ready to branch out into things like sat- 
ire, for instance. If people want to make games about subjects like nu- 
clear war, I think they certainly should do so. Games should be free to 
put forth different views on a subject. It's like literature where we 
presumably arrive at some sort of balanced opinion by letting different 
people state their cases, and judging which is the most meritorious. I am 
violently opposed to censorship in any form. 




Joel Billings 

I look forward to the day when one can just get on a network and play 
games with people, and that's maybe five years away. I'd see that as a 
real innovation in game playing, to be able to start playing the majority 
of computer games against other people instead of just against the 
computer. 

There's no doubt that there's a glut in the marketplace of certain 
kinds of items. Only a very few people will be competing in the area of 
strategy games. Those that will be competing are coming in from tradi- 
tional board game companies. Our market is going to continue to grow 
because we're going to grow in direct proportion to the number of com- 
puters bought by war gamers and strategy gamers. Whenever these peo- 
ple buy a computer, they're going to switch over and start playing com- 
puter games, and game boards are in trouble. We still have a long way to 
go before everybody has a home computer. 

I certainly hope American manufacturers figure out what the Japa- 
nese have figured out: To standardize their hardware. I don't see it hap- 
pening, though. Americans are too individualistic to standardize on one 
system. From the software end it's really a disadvantage. We spend half 
of our resources converting ideas that've already been executed on one 
computer to run on another machine. With standardized hardware, that 
talent could go into making better games, better products. 



become something that appeals to the higher sensibilities of man, his 
aesthetic values. I see them as being like interactive movies. Imagine tak- 
ing the visual impact of a Kubrick film, adding the complexity of a 
Dostoievsky novel, putting that with the attraction of a real-life situation. 

I could foresee the development of a kind of home video cubicle that 
integrated a lot of different functions. It would provide a connection be- 
tween user and machine as much like the real world as is technologically 
possible. For example, it could have stereo optical effects with parallax 
so that when you turned your head everything would change as it does in 
real life. 

Once a hardware unit like this becomes accessible to everyone, we'll 
also use it for other things, like learning to find your way through a 
strange city; it will become a very powerful educational tool. Ultimately, 
if an interface is developed to coimect these machines directly with the 
human brain, what we'll have is a controlled reality by consensus, rather 
than reality by reality. That's just what everyone wants: The perfect user- 
to-machine input, perfect knowledge for everybody, instant access to in- 
formation, and instant control over the enviroimient. It might end up that 
the simulated reality will become so appealing that people will stop being 
so concerned about actual reality. This computer medium that was 
originally intended to control the environment may eventually wind up 
replacing the environment. I don't necessarily advocate this, but from a 
programmer's point of view it's certainly a titillating prospect. 




Dan Gorlin 

Computer games will become more meaningful to more people. As they 
become more interesting, they'll get closer to other fine art forms and 



A 

Mike Berlyn 

We'll see attempts to get software to work more the way a person 
thinks. This will have a lot of ramifications. If we're wrong about the 
way we think that people think, it could be disastrous for the computer 
interface. Windowing is heading in a different kind of interfacing direc- 
tion than we've had before, trying to get things as close to a human level 
as possible. That's good, but it's only the first step. I think we're going 
to see software that thinks and understands and knows about the person 
who's using it. 

We're developing the capability now of doing things that allow games 
to transcend their traditional boundaries. I think the computer, used 
thoughtfully as a participant in a game, can be absolutely mind-boggling. 
The thrills, excitement, and emotional reactions one gets from living can 
be experienced through gaming now or in the future. 

Computers are like pets, you know; at some point everybody's going 
to have one to interact with because they're cute. And they can do stuff. 
When people start treating computers as pets or as surrogate friends, a 
new, broader, stronger idea of what a game can be will come into play. 

Think what kind of environments could result— computerized en- 
virorunents in which you could exist for years, games in which you're 
doing things you could only do on the computer. 

Picture yourself sitting in an overly large chair that wraps around 
you. You close your eyes and the chair actually stimulates your nervous 
system. It makes you think, and see, and experience being on a roller 
coaster. Are you there or aren't you? Think of the places that you could 
go, the adventures you could have. 

The real question in everyone's mind is, when are these things going 
to start to think? With more memory, faster processors, and more so- 
phisticated programming techniques, we'll end up with awareness in the 
computer. Everybody's pushing for it, and it's going to be here soon.

In the words of the Peelings II

I have seen for people who do a lot 
of work with mailing lists, form let-

An easy to follow manual. 
Essential to any good program is a

describes the Format II manual. 
"All in all, it is one of the best word

Put it all together. Then add 
features such as support of hard

The Mad Poet. By Michael North. The Mad Poet is an unpretentious lit- 
tle program that entertains by randomly generating couplets and il- 
lustrating them with interesting and colorful patterns. The results are 
haiku-like computer poems, often nonsensical, usually humorous, and 
occasionally profound. These are accompanied by truly obnoxious sound 
effects that only detract from the program. If your Apple is hctoked up to 
a printer, you can even print your favorite poems for posterity. 

The best way to enjoy The Mad Poet is to boot it up when you need to 
unwind, turn off the sound effects (unless a headache is your idea of 
relaxation), put on some music, and turn off all the lights. A soothing fog 
of poetry and colorful designs will lull you away from your cares. 



Unfortunately, mad poetry is a passive entertainment. While you can 
stop the program at any couplet that demands further contemplation, you 
don't have the option to stop it and add a couplet of your own and be 
madly poetic too. Sometimes one of The Mad Poet's couplets cries out 
for a witty rejoinder or an enigmatic addendum, and it is frustrating not 
to be able to put one up on the screen. 

Oh yes— if you don't have a color monitor, forget the whole thing. 
The Mad Poet loses its muse on monochrome. 

The Mad Poet is copy-encouraged. The publisher urges anyone in- 
terested to copy the program and mail in $14.95. A shining example of 
the honor system keeping overhead low. TZ

represented by the game board. Well, maybe Fortress isn't quite that 
simple. Both you and your opponent can either build new fortresses or 
strengthen existing ones, and at a single stroke turn your opponent's 
position into a shambles. It's kind of like playing a game of chess where 
the pawns can suddenly become rooks or knights. 

Fortress may just be the first strategic board game designed solely for 
a microcomputer. Yet it is distinguished by more than this. It employs a 
sophisticated artificial intelligence capability that enables the computer 
players to "learn" from their mistakes and to grow in both capability 
and competence. Just like a human opponent, your computer adversary 
will study your tactics and style of play and learn from the experience! A 
few games of Fortress can change your whole relationship with your Ap- 
ple. Remember H.A.L., from Arthur C. Clarke's 2007? 

Fortress requires that you learn only a handful of rules, yet it pro- 
vides hours of challenging play. The game begins with a famous Welsh 
battle song, "Men of Harlech." SSI has even thoughtfully included the 
words in case you want to sing along. Players may then select their op- 
ponents from among five unique computer characters, or they may 
choose someone of the human persuasion. Each computer opponent 
possesses a distinct style of play. The Squire is a rank novice, eager to 
learn, while Count Vauban is a sophisticated and capable opponent. Sir 
Galahad, Genghis Khan, and Lord Maginot round out the list. In addition 
to selecting an opponent, the player may alter the length of each game in 
the tournament, copy or create new computer opponents, and even elimi- 
nate the sound effects for more sedate play. For a unique challenge, com- 
puter players can be created, trained, and matched up by their human 
coaches for an all-computer tournament! 

Fortress is played on a 6 by 6 grid, with players issuing commands 
through the computer's keyboard. Players alternate placing their hi-res 
fortresses on squares of their choosing. At each turn players may place 
additional fortresses on the board or strengthen existing fortresses. A 
"zone of control" represented by matching-colored flags extends out 
from the four comers of each fortress. Conflicting "zones of control" 
from adjacent fortresses effectively cancel each other out while friendly 
adjacent fortresses combine their strength in attack or defense. Each 
player tries to gain as much territory or board space as possible within 
twenty-one moves. Players win territory and game points by staking out 
unoccupied territory or successfully attacking their opponent. Isolated 
enemy castles may be attacked, placed under siege, and when out- 
numbered, destroyed and removed from the board. To assist Fortress's 
human players in recognizing impending danger, a fortress under siege 
raises its drawbridge. Should you find yourself at a loss for your next 
move, there's even a "kibbitz" command to enable the computer to sug- 
gest a possible move. At the conclusion of each game, points are totalled 
and it's on to the next round in the fifteen-game tournament. At the end 
of each tournament the players may review their tournament history and 
record the tournament play to disk while updating their computer oppo- 
nent's learning routines. 

Combining the elegance of a simple, easily learnable game with real 
strategic sophistication and an opponent who learns. Fortress provides 
fast-paced play, considerable challenge, and not a few surprises for 
board game enthusiasts. Willi

MegaSpell. There's good news for people who, for whatever reason, are 
using MegaWriter. It's MegaSpell, a spelling checker that complements 
MegaWriter. 

Megahaus could have saved itself some money by eliminating 
MegaSpell's manual. The program is so simple to use that it barely needs 
one. That's the strong point of MegaSpell, which lives up to the company 
motto: "We make computers work easier." 

MegaSpell consists of two disks— a program disk and a forty- 
thousand-word dictionary disk that can accommodate ten thousand more 
words. Anyone who can use MegaWriter, as difficult and slow as it is, 
will be able to master MegaSpell with relative ease. The formats and 
commands of the menus in both programs are the same. 

Here's how it works. First, it makes a list of all the words used in a 
document. Then it checks the list against words found in its dictionary, 
making note of words that don't appear in the dictionary. Finally, it dis- 
plays words one at a time for you to correct or skip. 



Words are displayed by themselves and in the context of sentences 
and paragraphs, making it easier to figure out if they're really misspelled 
or not. For example, MegaSpell will flag the word Mon. as being mis- 
spelled, since it doesn't appear in its dictionary. However, if the word is 
being used as an abbreviation for Monday, then it is correct as used. At 
this point, the user can skip the misspelled word (leave it uncorrected) or 
ignore it (tell MegaSpell that the word is supposed to be spelled that way 
and not to bring up any more occurrences of the word). If the word is in- 
deed misspelled, MegaSpell offers the option of correcting either a 
specific occurrence of the word or all occurrences. 

A few words about disk drives: Be sure to have at least two of them. 
If MegaWriter is difficult to use with just one drive, MegaSpell is nearly 
impossible. The disk that holds text files resides in drive 2, while the 
program and dictionary disks take turns being swapped in and out of 
drive 1. 

It's not clear what dictionary Megahaus used in creating the diction- 
ary disk. How much confidence can you have in a computerized spelling 
checker that doesn't have "mainframe" or "microcomputer" as part of 
its vocabulary? And what can you say about a spelling checker that 
boasts knowing how to spell "super-cali-fragil-istic-expi-ali-docious," 
then misspells it? It's a trivial point but a possible indication of how thor- 
ough (or unthorough) the program's designers were. 

Yes, there are spelling checkers with fifty-, eighty-, and one hun- 
dred-thousand-word dictionaries, but they cost up to twice what 
MegaSpell costs. And as is true with most spelling checkers, it's not 
possible to compare MegaSpell to any others, since most are tailored to 
specific word processors. For its low price, forty thousand words on a 
disk seems about right. Just be prepared for the program to see some cor- 
rectly spelled words as misspelled. 

The dictionary disk can be expanded; it allows you to add up to ten 
thousand words of your own, a feature that will come in handy to anyone 
who frequently uses jargon — lawyers, doctors, and computer pro- 
grammers. 

Simplicity is a good word to describe MegaSpell. The accompanying

Practical Accountant. By North Forty Software. Ideally suited for 
small businesses, the Practical Accountant is deceptively simple to learn 
for such a powerful package. It is designed for use with a 64K Apple and 
two disk drives. The program's only visible drawbacks are minor incom- 
patibilities with the hardware. The program will only work with an Ap- 
ple brand 80-column card on the Apple He and will not support any kind 
of 80-column card on other Apples. And while the program was de- 
signed to take full advantage of the two apple keys on the He, these keys 
do not always work, and the user must resort to control characters. 

These are minor inconveniences, however, compared to the pro- 
gram's capabilities. With two disk drives the user can maintain approxi- 
mately six hundred transactions in the cash record, the system that ac- 
cepts income and expense data. And with four disk drives (the maximum 
allowed), the number of recorded transactions can be quadrupled. 

The Practical Accountant is based on accrued single-entry accounting 
and records every single transaction, even if cash doesn't actually change 
hands. Regardless of the order in which you enter records, the program 
automatically organizes them into chronological order. The report 
generator then allows the user to sort the records in a variety of ways; 
records can be incorporated into a multitude of reports including cash 
flow reports, reconciliations, listings, and tax reports. 

Each record can also be posted to a chart of accounts. This chart 
enables the user to categorize transactions or group similar records to- 
gether. This is an excellent feature that can be extremely flexible. There 
are countless uses for it, since the chart of accounts is comprised of both 
categories and subcategories. The maximum number of categories is fif- 
ty, while there are as many as three hundred subcategories available. Ex- 
amples of ways in which the chart of accounts can be used are to list all 
sales generated by a particular salesperson, to generate reports regarding 
a specific customer or group of customers, and to maintain individual 
vendor information. Because of the accounting method it utilizes, the

Practical Accountant also makes bank reconciliation a simple matter that 
saves a lot of time. 

The Practical Accountant is an excellent program for figuring taxable 
income and deductions. Using the same method as the chart of accounts, 
tax items can be categorized and subcategorized. And because the user 
enters items as they occur throughout the year, the only work necessary 
at tax time is printing a report. 

The Practical Accountant can also maintain payroll. It generates 
checks and categorizes them as payroll transactions or bill-paying trans- 
actions, and also handles credit card transactions. In addition, the Practi- 
cal Accountant can edit records one at a time or globally. 

With all the program's capabilities, you might wonder if it wouldn't 
be easy to get lost in the depths of the Practical Accountant. Fortunately, 
this is not the case. The Practical Accountant is menu-driven, straight- 
forward, and easy to learn. Options are frequently displayed on the 
screen to guide the user to the next logical step. Some familiarity with ac- 
counting procedures helps in the utilization of this program, but you 
don't have to be a CP. A. in order to use it. 

In addition, the two-section manual is well written and well designed. 
The first half, "Before You Start," leads the beginner through every as- 
pect of the program in a surprisingly easy-to-read and easy-to-follow 
text. The second section, "Reference Guide," is an excellent informa- 
tion source when you want to find the answer to a specific question 
quickly. Software manufacturers and publishers should take note of the 
Practical Accountant's manual; it sets a high standard that readers and 
software users will surely appreciate. Quite simply, the Practical Ac- 
countant is an excellent, multi-faceted software package for the novice or 
expert. PRO

Regatta. By Joe DeMuth and Eric Peterson. Racing a small sailboat can 
be challenging. It takes strategy, knowing when to tack, when to reach, 
and when to run with the wind. It takes patience, putting up with the 
wind's vagaries. And it takes nerve; at any moment you may be thrown 
into the water. (A sailor who has never been dunked probably hasn't 
been out much.) DeMuth and Peterson have created a program that cap- 
tures all these aspects. 

One player starts a race by selecting a course. There are four to 
choose from, and the last is much more difficult than the first. Each 
course is quite pretty, consisting of a lake drawn with sharp, assembly 
language graphics. You can choose light or heavy winds. Go boating by 
yourself or compete with another player. The sail is controlled from the 
keyboard, while the tiller can be controlled by either keyboard or paddle. 

Your boat sets out from a dock. You have about ten seconds to adjust 
your sail before the race starts. Then you're off, racing around the 
buoys, trimming your sails to take advantage of every shift in the wind, 
trying to avoid the shore and the menacing shoals that lurk just out of 
sight. At the bottom of the screen there are different indicators to 
measure the direction and speed of the wind, the position of the sail and 
tiller, and the heel of the boat. (This last is often in a horizontal position, 
meaning that you're in the drink.) There are time penalties for running 
around, hitting a buoy, or capsizing your boat. 

At the end of the race, the program tells you your finishing time. A 
slow time includes the message, "Blame it on the crew." A record time 
gets you, "Good sailing. Captain!" and is saved to disk. 

Regatta is a simple, well-designed game, and a good simulation. Old 
salts will enjoy it; lubbers will find it a useful introduction. Fi

Factor Blast. By Joe DeMuth. Math is a subject considered to be more 
than a litde dry by most kids. After all, it's difficult to relate linear equa- 
tions to anything in the real world when you're in junior high school and 
your biggest concern is how not to be seen with your parents. 

Factor Blast is an excellent example of how to make students want to 
study a dry subject. The game combines color graphics, animation, and 
sound with the challenge of playing against a computerized or human op- 
ponent. That competition provides a strong incentive for learning about 
factors and prime numbers. As it says on the package, "Math skill is 
your most effective weapon." 

The program opens with simple menus providing options for three

difficulty levels, penalties for missing factors, keyboard or paddle con- 
trol, sound, and a one- or two-player mode. After you select your op- 
tions, a grid of numbers appears along with a tripod-mounted radar dish, 
a scoreboard, and a billboard. The first player positions the cursor over 
one of the numbers on the grid, and the dish blasts the number, adding 
that amount to the player's score. This done, your opponent is required 
to blast the factors of the number selected by the first player. If the cho- 
sen numbers are correct, the second player's score increases by their 
total. Thus, there is a need for strategy in selecting the numbers to be fac- 
tored. Selecting the number twelve, for example, may result in one's op- 
ponent gaining seven or eight points, while selecting forty-eight may re- 
sult in a gain of more points. Players looking to gain the maximum 
number of points while keeping their opponent's potential for points to a 
minimum will have to factor in advance the numbers they select. This is 
especially important when playing against the computer, as the latter 
never misses a factor and always gets the points. 

Numbers that have been blasted do not return. This only makes the 
game more challenging as it progresses, since the most desirable 
numbers are taken early. The overall strategy required for the game is a 
combination of looking several moves ahead as in chess, and considering 
all posible factors of any number. For this reason, students playing Fac- 
tor Blast have found it expedient (and fun) to memorize the prime 
numbers up to one hundred and the factors of each number through one 
hundred. Playing Factor Blast repeatedly results in memorization, as 
well as enhancing the student's ability to perform mental calculations. Of 
course, these benefits aren't gained without effort, but the game does 
provide the incentive and the technique. HAB

Alphabet Zoo. By Dale Disharoon. This program, part of Spinnaker's 
Early Learning Series, is really two in one. First, it's a computer 
alphabet that can help little kids match letters with sounds. In this option, 
called ABC Time, the computer draws a hi-res picture, shows a letter in 
upper and lower case, and then flashes a word that begins with that letter 
on-screen. The child's only computer interaction is pressing a key to 
speed up the orderly procession through the alphabet; the program will 
otherwise go on to the next letter after several seconds. In succeeding cy- 
cles through the alphabet, the picture varies, although four times in a row 
"X" stood for x-ray and "Q" for queen. (Maybe it's sacrilegious even 
to suggest it, but, just once, could "A" not stand for apple?) 

The second purpose of the program is to teach school-age tykes to 
spell the words describing the creatures, people, and objects encountered 
in ABC Time. It does this by involving them in two maze games, 
playable by one or two, which are much more challenging than they ap- 
pear at first. Both are quite engaging. 

The computer begins by drawing a maze on the screen with a picture 
in the center. Scattered throughout the maze are letters that make up the 
word associated with the picture. In Letter Game, the player, 
represented by any of six animated vegetables, searches and pounces on 
the first letter of the word. Getting the letter right causes the word to 
print on the screen. Additional first letters are worth ten points; choosing 
incorrect ones costs the same amount. 

Movement through the maze is controlled by letters used as direc- 
tional keys; plump baby fingers might have trouble with this. You can 
move around extra quickly by jumping on a "hyperspace" dot, but 
there's no telling where you'll reappear. And you do so at your own risk, 
as the letters will also move around at random. 

The Spelling Zoo is similar in play. In this one, you must find in or- 
der all the letters that spell the name of the object shown. This task re- 
quires more literary ability, but the letters compensate by holding still. If 
you can't complete the word, it will not appear in its entirety. 

In the Letter Game you can use all caps, no caps, or a mixture; Spell- 
ing Zoo employs lower case only. The Letter Game is always timed; 
Spelling Zoo can be used with or without a time limit. Both are arranged 
in six levels of difficulty corresponding to the relative familiarity of let- 
ters and the varying lengths of words to be spelled. Although the maze 
pattern changes every five turns, it stays at a relatively constant level of 
difficulty. 

The sound used in Alphabet Zoo is a definite plus. All three games 
make clever use of the Apple's naturally tinny voice by trilling snippets 
by classical composers such as Bach and Handel, both of whom wrote 



music for the metallic-sounding spinet. Unfortunately, there is no sound- 
off option. 

The quality of the graphics, while generally excellent, is uneven. 
Sonrte objects, such as a vest and a needle and thread, are difficult for 
even an adult to recognize. Others, particularly a blue-and-white zebra 
and a lavender rose, are imaginatively and attractively reproduced. 

The theme of animals, as stated in the title, is not completely carried 
out when considering the program as a whole. Most of the words and 
pictures are of familiar beasts, but interspersed among them are ar- 
chetypal grownups— kings, nurses, jugglers — and objects, including a 
few in questionable taste— it's hard to appreciate "D is for dice" and "B 
is for bomb" in software intended for three- to eight-year-olds. 

The spelling-game aspect of this package is reasonably good; howev- 
er, those interested in turning their kids on to an electronic ABC may do 
better elsewhere. IP

The Grabit Factory. By Bob and Carolyn Box. Sifting the good from 
the mediocre in educational software is confusing. All manner of 
characters, from bears to clowns, perform on monitors all across the 
country. All claim to be the perfect instrument through which 
mathematics, English, and other essentials can be taught to our children. 
Unfortunately, not all of these software offerings come up to the hype 
projected by their advertisements. 

One common problem area is the child's interaction with the com- 
puter. Often, the student must commit too much time to learning the 
combination keypresses or other commands necessary to interact with 
the software. 

This certainly is not the case with The Grabit Factory, which can be 
controlled with only a joystick and the escape key. A mathematical pro- 
gram for ages five to eight, The Grabit Factory offers simple but enter- 
taining graphics with definite "kid" apf)eal.

senting addition, subtraction, and number recognition. To select the 
desired subject, the child simply lowers the crane to the correct block 
and carries it to the work area. Then the mechanic who opened the day 
appears and oils the crane, affording faster operation. 

Number recognition consists of the student selecting a number from 
the conveyor belt that corresponds to a number revealed in the screen's 
upper right-hand comer. The same procedure is used for single digit ad- 
dition and subtraction problems. And there's no need to worry over what 
might happen should an incorrect key be pressed. The program is com- 
pletely error-trapped. Pressing the escape key removes the child from the 
current study area and redisplays the menu. 

The Grahit Factory may also be run without sound, allowing the child 
to use the program on Saturday mornings without disturbing a sleeping 
Mom and Dad. Kids should be able to manage this program's operation 
with little coaching from their parents, encouraging good, independent 
study habits. With The Grabit Factory, young students can improve their 
math abilities through continued reinforcement of number recognition, 
addition, and subtraction, and Mom can feel confident she bought a pro- 
gram that delivers what it claims. This educational program's a grabber, 
any way you look at it. HCL

lose them all before reaching the end. The caverns are deadly, and their 
dangers take many forms. You might be glomped by a monster (there are 
dozens), or you might be bitten by a snake (these look rather like the 
"worms" from Space Invaders). Even if you avoid all your enemies, 
you will find it distressingly easy to run into a cavern wall or a force 
field. And if nothing else destroys you, your ship will probably run out 
of fuel. 

Of course, it's not entirely one-sided. Your ship is fast and maneu- 
verable, and the joystick gives excellent control, for what it's worth. 
Your guns fire in three directions simultaneously, and there are fuel 



JANUARY 1984 



dumps scattered along the way. Finally, to distract you from the tedium 
of being destroyed, there is some novel scenery provided by sharp, col- 
orful graphics. 

Unfortunately, the game isn't all good news. There is no pause 
feature, and the sound can't be turned off. High scores cannot be saved. 
Worst of all, you can get killed in some ways that are very frustrating in- 
deed—for example, when the cavern scrolls by faster than your ship can i 
maneuver. To top it off, the fire button on the joystick is also used to 
position your replacement ships. Unless you're careful, you can lose a 
series of ships to the same deathtrap. 

While it has its drawbacks. Cavern Creatures certainly delivers the 
goods for the shoot-'em-up fan. Despite its faults, it is probably worth 
the price Datamost asks for it. FJ

Super Bunny. By Vic Leone. Ancient myths and legends gave us heroes 
like Beowulf, Odysseus, Joan of Arc, King Arthur, Robin Hood. 

Comic books afforded an even greater proliferation of heroes, from 
Superman and Spiderman to The Hulk. But we still didn't have any com- 
puter heroes— until now. 

Mightier, faster, stronger, and hoppier than any before him comes 
Super Bunny, a Datamost creation designed to fill the void. It all started 
with a horrendous attack on Buimyville by a fearsome horde of wolves, 
snakes, and other beasts that left few fluffy inhabitants alive. Those that 
managed to escape lived as best they could in burrows hidden deep be- 
neath the ground. 

Into that environment was bom one called Reginald. He seemed dif- 
ferent somehow. During his postpubescent years Reginald was surprised 
by a vision of Lapinus, ancestor of all rabbits. Special carrots were given 
to Reginald along with a warning that they be used sparingly. Each carrot 
will give our hero superpowers, enough to destroy any enemy, but they 
only last for a limited time. 

As did Clark Kent, Reginald had to keep his carrot power a secret. So 
to you, the player, befalls the task of helping Reginald become Super 
Bunny. Upon booting the game, a delightful title screen and credits scroll 
up and lead into a short graphic moment in which Reginald eats the car- 
rots and becomes a superhero. Then it's into the play, which is a lot more 
difficult than first appearances might suggest. 

Reginald awaits your assistance in a cave. In order to become Super 
Bunny, he must reach the right side of the screen, where a gremlin holds 
the special carrots. To accomplish this, Reggie must hop across five 
rows of elevators. Naturally, the elevators don't all move in the same 
direction. Some move up, others move down, and several are occupied 
with dangerous beasts who have already proven their hostility by con- 
suming most of Reggie's kinfoLk. 

The elevators are not the only impediment to getting at the carrots. 

Chances are good that just as Reggie is about to pounce from a mov- 
ing elevator onto the gremlin, the little nitwit will move. In this case, a 
miss is as good as a mile; if you lose a "Reggie," you must start again 
from the left side of the cave. 

Once a few of those carrots have been ingested, however, watch out! 
Super Bunny can hop from elevator to elevator, bopping those hungry 
hostiles right out of action. Time is of the essence; during first-level 
play, each carrot lasts for only forty-five seconds. The sixth and highest 
level only affords the player twenty seconds of activity as Super Bunny. 
Movement from elevator to elevator is also critical. Players garner 
points by hopping as close to the elevator floor as possible. A slight mis- 
calculation, and Reggie has lost that particular round. The third and fifth 
levels are especially tough, because Reggie's ears have grown. 

The game awards bonus points according to the speed with which 
Reggie manages to cross the cave and obtain his carrots. Levels three and 
six provide a bonus bunny. And, of course, the higher the level attained, 
the more points you receive. In order to win those points, you must play 
a mean game; elevators seem to approach the speed of light, and the an- 
tagonistic animals become even more hostile. 

So punch out those parasites and cream those critters! Help Reggie 
save his bunny brothers from total annihilation. Just take on Super Bunny 
and you can become a hero, tQO, hopping your way to fame and for- 
tune. HCL

The Eating Machine. By Barbara S. Thome. The Eating Machine is not 
a science fiction robot that devours Cleveland. This is a system designed 
to teach the analyzing and planning of meals. The program was created 
by four nutritionists whose qualifications range from a professorship in 
nutrition at the University of Pittsburgh to a nutrition advisory post with 
the county health department in Pittsburgh. 

The Eating Machine is packaged with two disks; one is a program 
disk and the other is for storing data. After indicating your sex and age 
group, a calorie range is provided for the user. A lo-res happy face 
smiles at you at the start of the program. This face comes to be a familiar 
sight as you progress through the program. 

More than five hundred foods are listed in the program's database, 
from which the user indicates what was consumed on a given day. The 
face will smile at you if you manage to stay within your indicated calorie 
limit. If you exceed this, the smile is gone— replaced with a disconcert- 
ing frown. 

Bar graphs are also incorporated into the program, indicating the 
nutritional values of protein, vitamin A, and vitamin C found in the foods 
consumed. A second bar graph reveals the levels of calcium, iron, and 
sodium in the indicated foods as compared to the recommended daily 
allowances for these nutrients. The Eating Machine also uses bar graphs 
to show what percentage of your total calories came from proteins, car- 
bohydrates, fat, and alcohol respectively. 

The program summarizes your inputted data in addition to listing 
foods high in the nutrients you seem to be lacking. For example, if you 
are low in vitamin A, the program tells you about a food group high in 
that vitamin. You can average your calories by a single day, several 
days, or a week simply by using your personal file. 

The Eating Machine's database may also be customized by adding ap- 
proximately two hundred foods to the installed database of five hundred. 

Entries may also be deleted or changed. If you want the nutritional 
analysis of a particular recipe, this information can be displayed or 
printed. 

Unfortunately, the data obtained through The Eating Machine cannot 
be saved to disk, thereby depriving you of a running record of your nutri- 
tional history. A printer will give you a hard copy of the data, but the 
manual warns that a complete printout may take as long as thirty min- 
utes. Answers to the program's questions require a "Y/N" response 
rather than the customary "remm" input, which might take some getting 
used to. 

One positive note is the well-written documentation that helps make 
the program easy to use as well as to understand. The less than state-of- 
the-art graphics might be crude, but the lessons contained within this 
nutritional program are certainly interesting and educational. Here's to 
your health! PIL

Street, Baltimore, MD 21201; 301-659-7212). $49.95. 

The Net worker. It lets you communicate with other computers by phone 
and doesn't cost two arms and a leg. 

Not much more needs to be said. Other modems give you the same 
thing the Networker offers, and they usually cost three times as much. 

This modem supports touch-tone dialing; it communicates at 300 baud, 
the most common speed in low-priced modems; and terminal software 
is included. The software allows you to transfer text files to other Apples 
and to transfer any DOS file error-free to another modem. If it sounds 
like the Networker offers the same features as most other modems, that's 
because it does. But for far fewer bucks. 

Much of the hardware has been eliminated here by excluding a dialer. 
The modem plugs into any phone jack in the wall, and your phone plugs 
into the modem. To call a remote system, it's necessary to dial the number 
on the telephone (not on the modem) and then flip an external switch that 
plugs into the modem. It's a lot easier than it sounds. The point is that 
all dialing is done with the telephone. This means you can't use any redial 
functions of other terminal programs to keep dialing a number until you 
get connected. 

There's no hefty manual to muddle through; all instructions for using 
the modem and the accompanying software are included in a pocket-sized 
sixteen-page booklet. It's obvious that Zoom Telephonies intends this 
modem for nontechnical users who know what they want and don't want 
to spend a lot of time learning how to do it. Opening the box, installing 



the modem, and making the first call takes no more than about ten minutes 
for even the greenest of novices. 

Companies like Hayes Microcomputer Products, Novation, and 
Microcom will be around for a long time producing sophisticated, expen- 
sive modems. For someone on a limited budget, though. Zoom Telephonies 
puts out the perfect modem. Pound for pound, feature for feature, and 
chip for chip, it's an unbeatable bargain. flTy

The Operator. This is a full-featured direct-connect modem at a very, 
very affordable price. Designed to emulate electronically the popular 
Apple Communications Card, The Operator is fully compatible with 
standard communications software including ASCII Express: The Profes- 
sional, Data Capture, Modem Magic II, Term Exec, Transends I, II, and 
///, VisiTerm, and Z-Term. 

Despite the deceptively low price. The Operator, produced by The 
International Modem Exchange, is remarkably full-featured. The user 
may transrrtit or receive data at 1 10 or 300 baud. The modem supports 
both full and half duplex modes and rotary, Touch-Tone and key-set 
phones may be used with the system. Even auto answer with a disconnect 
capability has been included. And to make the deal a little sweeter. The 
Operator includes a surprisingly capable communications package called 
The Connection. The Connection is entirely menu-driven and simple to 
use with an extensive on-screen help section. The program includes a 
utility to assist users in creating their own automatic log-on procedures 
for electronic bulletin boards and another utility to help transfer text files 
from your Apple to another system, anywhere! The authors have even 
thoughtfully provided preconfigured auto-log-on procedures for the 
Source and CompuServe. 

Installing and using The Operator is straightforward. The modem 
may be placed in any slot except 0 but most modems including 
T.I.M.E.C.O.R.'s expect the traditional slot two. Next, the switch plate 
that turns the modem on or off, and selects originate or answer mode is 
placed in the rear of the Apple. Finally, the cables are connected and 
your Apple is in communication with the world. The Operator's com- 
mand functions are both simple to use and remember. And an on-board 
ROM enables a series of control sequences to convert lower-case trans- 
missions to upper case for Apple's without lower case, exit the terminal 
mode, change duplex, or simply hang up the phone. Unfortunately, The 
Connection supports only Apple's 80-column card on the lie, and won't 
support any brand of 80-column card on an older Apple. 

A word or two is in order concerning support from the manufacturer. 
In short, it is responsive and quite impressive. The first modem obtained 
for this review did not function properly after several frustrating hours. 
However, a quick telephone call to the enclosed support number pro- 
duced a courteous and knowledgeable technician who diagnosed the 
problem, apologized for the inconvenience, and offered to exchange the 
defective modem at no charge. And all of this on a Saturday! Combined 
with an impressive six months warranty, T.I.M.E.C.O.R's customer 
support is fast, polite, and professional. Enough said. 

If this remarkably full-featured modem package has one serious flaw 
it's in the documentation, or more precisely the lack thereof. The manual 
consists of nine 8 by 1 1 pages printed with a dot-matrix printer and is sta- 
pled at the top. The manual's introduction claims that "while primarily 
intended for the avid Apple user, it is clear and precise enough to aid the 
novice computerist enter the world of communications." Really? In nine 
pages? An expanded manual typeset with clear, extensive documenta- 
tion, examples, and pictures or diagrams would go a long way toward 
enhancing the value and utility of this package. 

In spite of that, The Operator is quite simply a best buy for those in- 
terested in entering the world of Apple telecommunications. While not as 
full-featured as some of its more expensive competitors, The Operator 
combines all the essentials necessary for real communications capability 
at a fraction of normal cost. Combined with its telecommunications soft- 
ware and extensive compatibility with other third-party software, this is 
an almost irresistible addition to your Apple II at a very irresistible 
price. WHH

THE APPLE FOR YOUR BASIC KID: Aunt Tillle's Guide 
to Programming 

By Tricia Jordan 

A fun and imaginative guide to Basic programming for 
the Apple computer. Topics range from simple PRINT state- 
ments and math operations to interactive programs, graph- 
ics, sound, and animation— culminating in the creation of 
Basic arcade and adventure games. 

Each chapter consists of modules that (1) illustrate a 
programming technique through simple example, (2) in- 
troduce changes in the program— improvements or dif- 
ferent applications, and (3) discuss some facet of the pro- 
gram in considerable detail. 

This is a fascinating journey into the realm of the com- 
puter wizard for pilgrims of all ages, guided by an author 
with extensive knowledge of how children learn from com- 
puters. Tricia Jordan holds degrees in physiological 
psychology, education, psychology, and a Ph.D. in early 
childhood development. In 1978 she and a friend founded 
the Computer Workshop, a private computer school where 
children and adults come to play— and learn— with personal 
computers. 

The Apple For Your Basic Kid, her first book, is the result 
of her Workshop experiences. In it she describes the ins 
and outs of Apples in a nonintimidating style that kids will 
enjoy, and even grownups can understand. :, :

Spellakazam. This is a big, well-designed home education program with 
lots of depth and all the user-definability you could possibly want. 

The basic setup finds you and a magician in a maze containing the let- 
ters of the alphabet. At the bottom of the screen is a sentence with one 
word missing. You have to race around the maze, picking up the letters 
of the word in order, then go to the top hat at the end of the maze. Your 
correctiy spelled word wUl cause a random creature to jump out of the 
hat, place the word in the sentence, and reward you with a satisfying 
number score. If the magician gets to the hat first, you get fewer points. 
If you spell the word wrong, you are shown the correct spelling and 
allowed to try again. 

Based on the spelling texts of Silver Burdett Company, Spellakazam' s 
word lists are arranged according to categories of vowel sounds and 
similar consonants a la Sesame Street. You can make data disks with this 
method or make categories of your own. This leads to the program's 
most impressive feature— that it can be used for purposes other than the 
teaching of spelling. The trivia game possibilities are limitless. 

A single caveat: Spellakazam is written in Forth, which allows the 
storage and juggling of vast regions of data, word lists, sentence files, 
menus, submenus, and sub-submenus with cool dispatch. Forth, how- 
ever, is not the optimal game- writing language, and the game is the most 
visible part of the program. Player and computer-controlled magician, 
though in the same race, cannot move at the same time. The result is that 
the computer wUl randomly freeze yoi^r current directional input in order 
to move the magician— a situation bouiid to cause frustration in younger 
players (and some older ones). 

On the one hand, Spellakazam will never vie with Pac-Man in the 
thrills department; on the other hand, there are those stem defenders of 
the educational establishment who warn against educational games being 
overly "game-y" at the expense of education. Between the rock and the 
hard place. Design Ware has taken pains to see that accuracy is rewarded 
over speed: Wiiming the race and spelling the word wrong will cost you 
more points than losing if you spelled the word correctly. You also have 
a cheerful little cheat option: A keystroke or button-press when you land 
lext to one of the many magic dove icons scattered throughout the 




163 



alphabet maze will send the magician back to the beginning if you're still 
hunting and pecking and he's getting too close to the finish. This feature 
is bound to please kids of all ages who hate to lose. 

You can also heighten the competitive element by increasing the skill 
level, making the maze harder to get through and speeding up the magi- 
cian, or play up the educational component by leaving the skill level at 
one and selecting more difficult words. 

Aside from a few play deficiencies in the game itself, the extreme 
flexibility and expandability of the program, little grace notes like a two- 
player option, and the ability to quit one game without having to reboot 
to get into another one make this a class entry in its field. A(

Pixit. By Michael Darooge. To state that Apple hi-res graphics are sim- 
ple is a contradiction in terms. Simplicity and Apple hi-res graphics are 
not analogous, unless one has spent many hours in tot^l hibernation 
studying the complexities of illuminated thought and pixels. Program- 
ming concerns are many: which colors can appear side by side with a dif- 
ferent color, which one is in harmony with background hues, drawing 
and xdrawing a particular shape and erasing it from the screen, the rota- 
tion and scale of a required shape. . . . All this could leave a non- 
programmer breathless. The hassle of creating a shape table, as well as 
wondering what on earth vector plotting is all about, could well leave the 
prospective graphics user with a migraine headache the size of Gibraltar. 

Pixit is the graphic user's Excedrin, an assault on the fortified tower 
of complexity known as Apple hi-res. This program's documentation is 
short and sweet. On-screen prompts really are all one needs to pass from 
main menu to auxiliary menu in order to activate the program's features. 
Included in the 38-page instruction manual is a short course on the Ap- 
ple's hi-res screen, vector plotting, and color grouping. But the true crux 
of the program is the belief that primarily through actual use of the 
routines, the user will learn a great deal about the hi-res capabilities and 
not-so-friendly perplexities inbred in the Apple. 

Although it incorporates a nonstandard, fast-loading boot program.

Pixit's program disk may be backed up by the user. The package even in- 
cludes instructions on how to do the copying. Trust and an excellent pro- 
gram combine to make this an attractive package for almost any plier of 
the graphic arts. 

Using Pixit isn't difficult. Left and right arrow keys indicate chosen 
entries from any of the menus and also select programs from either disk 
1 or 2 . The Pixit program resides in drive 1 , and data disks rest in drive 2 . 
Shapes— created with either the program's Create-A-Shape routine or 
another product— are easily manipulated on-screen. These shapes may be 
combined into a single picture, rotated, xdrawn, and their color changed, 
rescaled, or filled with a variety of hues (including one named "red 
bricks"). Line drawing and automatic circle creation are other 
capabilities found within this particular routine. All it takes to plant a 
shape on-screen is a single keypress. And if you happen to own an Epson 
printer with the Graftrax option, your hi-res creations may be dumped 
into hard copy. A handy help screen that is available through a single 
keypress allows the user to review the editor commands without destroy- 
ing a potential masterpiece. 

Pictures created with text and graphics, circles and lines, colorfill and 
shape tables aren't the program's only capabilities. Once into the Create- 
A-Shape routine, keyboard entry allows for hi-res shape creation with 
real flair. The user selects drawing scale (with or without grid), as well 
as the starting location of a particular shape. The cursor and plotter are 
controlled by one of two sets of keys. Pressing control-E at the beginning 
or middle of a shape file retraces the graphic creation until you press the 
space bar. The right arrow key moves you through the shape one pixel at 
a time, while the left arrow key moves backward through those 
movements. This function lets you see wasted plotting and enables you to 
edit to maximize shape-creation efficiency. When you complete the vec- 
tor table, it may be compiled into an Applesoft shape table. You can also 
analyze or modify any shape in a table by using a routine called the Shape 
Sourceror. This routine automatically plots shapes at an optimum draw- 
ing scale, color, and starting location. 

Pixifs shape table editor allows original shapes or those from Pixit's 
tables to be added to another shape table. The user can scan any shape 
table for possible inclusions, as well as delete or add shapes without fuss.

The Fourth Leg of the Apple. By Ray Brinker. Getting one's feet wet 
requires some basic equipment. Speaking literally, a bathtub is by far the 
best device, as little more than ankle-high water is required. A swim- 
ming pool may be overdoing things a bit, as total immersion is not ex- 
actly what is sought. Temperature may vary to taste, and by testing the 
water every now and then one's favorite temperature can be discovered. 

When discussing the Apple computer, getting one's feet wet means 
obtaining a little information about most of the machine's operations. 
This encompasses a great deal of territory. Not until you have tested the 
water every now and then can you identify the area you'd like to in- 
vestigate further. 

Such areas as the Apple's integrated circuitry, programming lan- 
guages, the disk operating system, and hardware add-ons are just a few 
of the topics you could investigate initially. 

Basic equipment needed? Not a bathtub, but a combination text and 
disk tutorial known as The Fourth Leg of the Apple. This product 
scratches the surface of many significant computer regions. A light and 
conversational style helps the reader wade through most of the heavier 
material. The included disk contains several interesting tutorial aids and 
applicable programs. A feature most appreciated is that each page in the 
three-ring binder places text on the left and leaves open space on the right 
for such necessities as notes. 

Have you had problems understanding or learning the hexadecimal 
system? This tutorial manages to make conquering the system rather 
painless and reveals a method for easily converting a binary number to 
its decimal equivalent. Once the reader has become acquainted with a 
specific point in the text, a program is run from the disk to reinforce that 
particular issue. For instance, four programs accompany the first 
chapter, which deals with hexadecimal notation. 

A rather hasty discussion of the Apple's circuitry gives way to a fully 
detailed explanation of the computer's memory and a light examination 
of RAM and page usage. The disk operating system is covered in 
Chapter 4. There, informative text details what actually occurs during 
booting, the whats and wheres of the VTOC, disk maps, and embedded 
control characters which prevent file copying by unauthorized persons. 

The 6502 microprocessor is discussed in the subsequent chapter. The 
processes of each of the seven internal registers are explained, and ex- 
amples of register operations are run from disk, revealing simulated 
6502 operations on screen. Then it's onward into the Apple Monitor, ex- 
amining Basic's decimal commands and changing values in memory at 
will. Next, a chapter dealing with various utility programs and 
peripheral cards functions as an introduction to the computer's abilities 
to inform you about itself. Of particular note is a three-page discussion 
on how to examine an Applesoft program byte by byte. 

A chapter dealing with languages certainly leaves little doubt as to the 
author's preference for Forth, which could also be deduced from the title 
of this software/book combination. A bare-bones, public domain version 
of Forth is included on the disk. This version skims the surface, though 
it does include several valuable operations that can assist the reader in 
determining whether he or she would like to become involved in this lan- 
guage. The Forth tutorial is the most extensive chapter in this program 
and is by far the most informative for the uninitiated programmer. 

The final chapter deals with assembly language programming and in- 
cludes a stripped-down assembler. Simple source programs such as this 
either whet your appetite for additional study or lead you to the conclu- i 
sion that assembly language programming isn't for you. An annotated i 
bibliography imparts additional information for those who want to con- i 
tinue with a specific area studied in this tutorial. j 

For those who are already acquainted with their Apple, there is little j 
need of such a tutorial, but for the many who have just purchased their j 
first computer and want to delve lightly into its capabilities, this product

could prove useful. Although the cost seems somewhat high, spending 
the admission price is better than wasting money on products not suited 
to your computing taste. And for those who've wanted to know what 
Forth is all about, this might be an inexpensive way to taste-test the 
language. You'll certainly not drown in The Fourth Leg of the Apple, but 
you will manage to get those tootsies wet. HCL

Success with Math. By Don Ross. Here's a series of math programs that 
cuts through all the cute music, flashy colors, and window trimmings and 
gets right down to business— teaching math. 

Don Ross, who is a school district supervisor for computer instruc- 
tion and a former math teacher, wrote the programs as tutorials for basic 
skills reinforcement and remedial learning. The series contains four pro- 
grams. Addition and Subtraction, Multiplication and Division, Linear 
Equations, and Quadratic Equations. 

Success with Math relies on neither rewards nor penalties, but rather 
on the student's willingness to learn. As the title implies, the student's 
feeling of success is the key to motivation. 

Each program in the series uses the same workbook format in which 
the student can choose to work on as many as nine problems in one sit- 
ting. Nine problems usually aren't enough, so Addition and Subtraction 
and Multiplication and Division offer the option of working on more 
problems at the end of each session. 

That's not so with Linear Equations and Quadratic Equations. At the 
end of a session, these two assume that the student has had enough, then 
exit to the Basic prompt. If more practice is desired, or if another student 
wants to use one of the programs, typing run starts it over again. 

Addition and Subtraction is aimed at students in the first through 
fourth grades, introducing the concepts of carrying in addition and bor- 
rowing in subtraction. Borrowing is usually a stumper, so it's possible to 
select subtraction problems that don't require borrowing, depending 
upon the student's abilities. 

Multiplication arul Division, which is meant for students at the junior 
high school level, lets users select one-, two-, or three-place multipliers 



and divisors. As with Addition arul Subtraction, this program simulates 
practicing problems in a workbook. A flashing cursor lets the student 
know what to enter next (product, sum, carry) by showing where it ex- 
pects the next input to appear. 

Linear Equations and Quadratic Equations include menus that list 
possible procedures. Options include such functions as adding or sub- 
tracting terms from both sides of the equation, multiplying or dividing 
each side of an equation, factoring to zero, and simplifying. 

All of the programs walk through each equation one step at a time, of- 
fering assistance if two successive errors occur; however, in the non- 
algebraic programs, help is almost nonexistent. If the student enters an 
incorrect number twice, the program gives the answer and tells the stu- 
dent, "When you understand your error, type in the correct answer." 
Apparently these two introductory math programs aren't meant to teach 
adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing; they're meant to exercise 
the student's already existing knowledge about those areas. It's assumed 
that given the correct answer, the student will realize where the er- 
ror occurred. 

Linear Equations and Quadratic Equations do offer help (of a sort) 
by telling the student what the preferable procedure is if the wrong one 
was chosen. The idea that one procedure is preferable is important to 
note here. Though it's possible to solve equations by using the same pro- 
cedures in a different order, these programs force the student to follow 
procedures in a set order. At the end of each problem and session, the 
number of procedural errors is given in addition to the number of com- 
putation errors. 

Students who need little motivation to learn are the ones who will get 
the most out of Success with Math. It doesn't force learning upon them; 
rather, it provides an enviroimient in which they can practice using what 
they know. 

Because it provides hints on what to do next in each problem, and be- 
cause it has the unlimited patience of a computer program. Success with 
Math comes very close to being as helpful as having a personal math 
tutor. tlTT

TEACHERS 
TEACHING 
TEACHERS 

BY ELIZABETH RAY AflDERS 

It's a busy afternoon at Independence High School in San Jose, 
California. The gymnasium is jammed. Standing-room-only crowds oc- 
cupy the lecture halls. Classrooms across the sprawling hundred-acre 
campus are full. The surprise is that there are no high school students left 
on the grounds. The eager learners are all teachers. They're all members 
of CUE (Computer U$ing Educators), a California teacher organization. 
They're enthusiastic and ready to work— ready to listen to leaders in the 
field of computer education, to talk to exhibitors from major hardware 
and software firms, to visit industry sites all over Silicon Valley, and to 
participate in more than two hundred workshops. Most of all, though, 
they are here to learn from one another. 

CUE'S members consist of classroom teachers who've been leaders 
in implementing microcomputer-based instruction in their schools. 
Founded in 1978 with a membership of twenty-five, CUE now has more 
than six thousand members. They come from every state, four prov- 
inces, and twelve foreign countries. At this Fourth Annual Fall 1983 
CUE conference in San Jose, more than three thousand of them have 
come to share their ideas about computer learning. 

CUE provides a unique opportunity for teachers. Bobby Goodson, 
one of the dozen teachers who founded CUE in 1978, puts it this way: 
"CUE supports teachers in their search for the best ways to use com- 
puters in their classrooms. CUE facilitates dialogue between teachers 
and provides answers to questions they're really curious about." 

Over and over again teachers report their dependence on other CUE 
members for help in dealing with such problems as tight budgets, un- 
familiar equipment, lack of support from hardware salespeople, and lack 
of expert in-service training. When the question of whom to trust comes 
up, most educators figure, "Unless you're an educator and you've had 
the problem, how would you know what to do?" 

The Joy of Teaching. CUE teachers are serious about using com- 
puters in their classrooms, and their conversations cover a range of prac- 
tical and philosophical concerns about the new technology. The CUE 
teachers are excited to have found a teaching aid that really turns kids on. 
They describe seeing faces light up and talk about the positive effects of 
learning along with the kids. An elementary teacher from Mount Diablo, 
California, says, "You're on a different level with the children when 
they can show you something. . . . Teaching the teacher can really raise 
a child's self-esteem." 

Goodson thinks that teachers' commitment to the new technology 
goes beyond the kids' enthusiasm for the computers. "Microcomputers 
are doing things to teaching beyond the kids or the technology itself. For 
the first time in years, teachers are reexperiencing the pure joy of learn- 
ing. It's healthy!" Goodson doesn't hesitate to term the widespread use 
of computers and the sharing of ideas a revolution in education. 

Goodson believes that computers have given teachers a renewed 
respect for themselves. "For once in our lives as educators, we have 
something we're in control of. We've taken a technology that was not 
made for us and turned it into something we can use. We've led the way 
in hardware and software. We're the ones being listened to." This one- 
time classroom math teacher is now the spokesperson for an entire move- 
ment of classroom teachers. Her voice is heard from Sacramento to 
Washington, D.C. An opinion leader about the use of computers in 
schools, she sits on boards, testifies at hearings, and advises computer 
companies and the legislature.

JANUARY 1984 



It's true — teachers are used to being told what and how to teach by 
everybody, including administrators, consultants, and publishers. It's 
also true that teachers have taken charge of computer education in the 
schools. They are the ones who are asking for and selecting hardware, 
reviewing software, and designing computer curriculums. 

The growing confidence in teachers as computer experts is new. 
After all, only a few years ago many teachers "didn't know what a com- 
puter looked like and didn't want to." Workshop presenter Don 
Gazaway, for example, was once a junior high school librarian who saw 
the computer as "just one more device to be dumped into the library." 
Fortunately, Gazaway 's school was in the district where Bobby Goodson 
gave one of her first computer literacy workshops. At this year's con- 
ference, it is Gazaway who leads a hands-on seminar designed to combat 
fear of computers. 

Where the Action Is. The two annual CUE conferences are con- 
sidered "the place to be" by publishers, hardware manufacturers, and 
leading computer education thinkers. The United States Department of 
Education has sent Dr. Linda Roberts to give the preconference keynote 
speech. IBM's Dr. Harvey Long is giving the evening keynote speech. 

In total, more than one hundred exhibitors and two hundred work- 
shop and seminar presenters are involved in the conference, some from 
as far away as Florida, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Industries all over 
Silicon Valley open their doors to the visitors. Apple, Atari, and other 
companies provide transportation to their plants. There's even a well- 
attended field trip to Nolan Bushnell's Pizza Time theater. 

Hardware companies give demonstrations of their hardware during 
the day. IBM provides twenty-five PCs and six well-trained demonstra- 
tors from California and Boca Raton to give hands-on lessons in IBM's 
version of Logo. 

Apples seem as plentiful at the conference as they are in local or- 
chards. Demonstrations on networking with hard disk systems, using 
graphics tablets, and programming in Basic are all done on one model of 
Apple or another. 

In a bus containing sixteen Atari 400s, teachers from Napa Valley 
give hands-on computer demonstrations to interested conferencegoers. 



Excluding the minimal cost of the old school bus itself, this rolling com- 
puter lab was outfitted for $17,000. Last year it served more than three 
thousand fourth- to sixth-graders in twenty-two elementary schools. 
From among the crowd gathered around the bus, a teacher from 
Sabastopol, California, gives an impromptu seminar on the computer 
van project in his district. More than twelve hundred kids are served by 
fifteen Hewlett-Packard 86s, which are transported in a van from school 
to school and rolled into the classrooms. The cost of this computer 
education is approximately $1.25 per smdent hour. 

Besides participating in practical teacher-led workshops, conference 
participants consider various computer education issues. One of the big 
draws at the conference is author Arthur Luehrmann. 

Reading, Writing, and REM Statements. Luehrmann is the leading 
spokesperson for teaching Basic as an approach to computer literacy. In 
an easy and erudite way, he defines computer literacy as simply "the 
ability to compute." He draws an analogy between computer education 
and driver education. In driver education, says Luehrmann, students are 
not expected to master the history of the automobile or how the engine 
works. Students simply learn to drive a car. So should it be with the com- 
puters. 

Luehrmarm and Herb Peckham, another opinion leader in computer 
education, give sessions on programming. To Luehrmann, it's not the 
language itself that is so important, but the powerful ideas of computing. 
"Problem-solving can be taught in Logo or Pascal or Basic— or even 
English," he believes. To be able to use a computer to solve problems is 
to be computer-literate. 

Discussions about literacy go on throughout the conference in one 
form or another. Four years ago, teachers were most concerned with 
hardware— what kind and how to afford it. Now most hardware ques- 
tions have been answered and teachers are interested in applications and 
computer literacy issues. 

The pioneers of the computer education movement are already mov- 
ing beyond these interests. Bobby Goodson is eager for the computer 
literacy question to be settled; like Luehrmann, she sees using computers 
as the important thing.

The issue of staff development and training also concerns CUE 
teachers. Right now, schools typically spend 95 percent of their dollar 
for hardware and less than 5 percent for training. Several kinds of train- 
ing methods exist, including staff centers, part-time computer experts, 
and, more recently, resource specialists who are both teachers and com- 
puter experts. 

The difficulty with the computer centers is lack of follow-up. 
Teachers who drop in for a few two-hour sessions need coaching, or 
guided practice, once they get back to the classroom. The problem with 
relying on computer experts and outside consultants is that they don't 
seem to make the best trainers. Teachers themselves usually teach each 
other computer skills better than anyone else. Whoever does the teaching 
must remember that effective training must be slow-paced, nontechnical, 
and clearly related to specific classroom use. 

Unfortunately, while teachers are busy training each other, adminis- 
trators are being left out. That's why CUE chose to have a special ses- 
sion for administrators who may soon find themselves in the position of 
knowing less about computers than their teachers, office staff, and 
kindergartners. 

New Revolutions. The fiiture begins today— and today, according to 
IBM's Dr. Long, "eighty-five percent of all jobs are directly or in- 
directly tied to computers," and 17 percent of all Visa cardholders own 
a computer. Long believes that the use of computers and video will be 
the next "revolution" and that teleconferencing will become more com- 
mon as a result of cheaper satellite and cable communications. He sug- 
gests that teachers will have administrative terminals at their desks and 
that computers will be used in the schools more extensively for adminis- 
trative purposes, to do such things as seating charts, daily attendance, 



E# 169 

lesson plans, and announcements. He also believes that the number of 
programming jobs will decrease as computers become more transparent 
learning devices that program themselves, while the number of comput- 
er-related jobs will increase. 

Ramon Zamora, computer education author and founder of 
Childware Corporation, takes the question of future trends even further. 
He believes that software will soon adapt to each learner. In fact, he tells 
his listeners, there's already a game that adapts to a child's mode of 
learning. The game discovers whether the child is playing more by sight 
or sound and adapts accordingly . 

Zamora thinks that schools will eventually become social places, 
good places for touching base with "learned people." Speaking on the 
effectiveness of microcomputers in schools, he suggests that it will be ten 
or fifteen years before we can really evaluate the role of computers in 
education. 

Still To Come. . . . Bobby Goodson wants CUE to continue as a ma- 
jor force in the marriage of school and microcomputer. But, like every 
successful endeavor, the organization is experiencing growing pains. 
CUE is too big to continue operating on a purely volunteer basis. Soon it 
will need professional administration. Goodson is determined to see 
CUE make the transition with all its benefits — and its pioneering spirit- 
intact. 

And so it goes. Teachers learning from other teachers. Teachers 
becoming experts. Teachers sharing their ideas, talking over their con- 
cerns, and suggesting solutions to classroom computer problems. 

Of course, if the conference predictions of various experts hold true, 
the CUE network of the future will be an electronic one that allows 
teachers to chat over morning coffee via modem. 



The Cue for CUE 



Computer Using Educators (CUE) is the largest of the forty- 
four affiliated organizations of the International Council of Com- 
puter Educators (ICCE). Unlike its sister organizations in other 
states, CUE receives no state support and has no paid staff. Dues, 
fees, and volunteer help entirely support its twice-yearly con- 
ferences and bimonthly newsletter, and an unpaid but dedicated 
board of directors runs the organization efficiently. 

CUE encourages teachers to organize regional groups and 
chapters and to hold local conferences. The organization has often 
been urged to go national, but so far the membership has voted to 
remain focused on concrete, local concerns- the practical needs 
of classroom teachers working in kindergarten to college level 
settings. 

Bobby Goodson, one of CUE's founders, favors this local em- 
phasis. Nevertheless, she also sees a need for an organization that 
will have the same kind of influence at the national level as CUE 
does at die state level, and she hopes diat the role of the ICCE will 
broaden to fill this gap. 

Its affiliation with ICCE gives CUE itself a certain amount of 
national influence. Last year, several CUE members, including 
board members Leroy Finkel, Marian Ken worthy, and Dr. Sandy 
Wagner, drafted the ICCE policy statement on network and multi- 
ple machine software. This statement outlines the responsibilities 
of educators, hardware developers, and software developers with 
regard to copyright protection and infringement and provides 
valuable guidance to school districts across the country. 

CUE also boasts accomplishments closer to home, in Sacra- 
mento and in the Silicon Valley. Last year, for example, CUE ad- 
vised Apple Computer on how to implement the Kids Can't Wait 
program. Apple's goal was to put a computer in every school, 
and, indeed, some nine thousand California schools received com- 
puters before the fall of 1983. 

CUE also had an impact on the design of the twenty-one 



regional Teacher Education Computer Centers (TECCs) in Cali- 
fornia. Testifying not long ago before the House of Representa- 
tives Ways and Means Committee, former Governor Edmund G. 
Brown, Jr. , spoke of how easy it was to implement his computer 
initiative (Imbrecht, AB 3194) in California. According to Brown, 
the grassroots movement was already in place, and CUE pioneers 
Ann Lathrop and Leroy Finkel had provided the model for the 
first TECC in their own San Mateo Center. In addition, Lathrop 
had already started a statewide software evaluation project (Soft- 
swap), which was subsequently written into the Imbrecht bill. 

More recently, CUE played an important role in making tech- 
nology a part of the California Education Reform Bill, AB 803. 
This is the first time an education bill not directly concerned with 
technology has recognized the importance of computer literacy. 

The CUE Newsletter. Between conferences, CUE members 
keep in touch with one another via the organization's bimonthly 
newsletter— thirty pages or so of announcements, letters, opin- 
ions, programs, teaching ideas, and reviews. 

To subscribe to the newsletter, contact Computer Using Edu- 
cators, Box 18547, San Jose, CA 95158. 

Public Domain Software. The CUE-sponsored exchange of 
teacher-written, public domain educational software is called Soft- 
swap. Currently, CUE's library, housed at the San Mateo County 
Office of Education in Redwood City, contains about seventy 
disks, with more than four hundred public domain programs for 
the Apple, Atari, Pet, TRS-80, and Compucolor computers; disks 
for the IBM PC and the Radio Shack Color Computer are being 
developed. 

Programs are available for a nominal charge or as a trade. The 
income generated from the fees is put back into Softswap and used 
to pay student progranmiers and office help. No fee is involved 
when Softswap disks are exchanged for original programs written 
by teachers, which are then evaluated and edited by CUE vol- 
unteers. Schools and user groups who'd like to develop complete 
Softswap disks of their own can obtain a program standards check 
list and release form from Softswap.

THE BASIC 



Solution 

By Wm.YR. Smith 



Finally, we have arrived. It's January 1984 
and we seem to have avoided falling into the po- 
litical trap foreseen by George Orwell. Tech- 
nology has not brought about a state of all- 
encompassing government control. Instead, by 
providing us with powerful but inexpensive per- 
sonal computers, it has given private citizens 
access to information-handling capabilities that 
were once the privilege of government and of 
big business. Let's hear it for the personal 
computer. 

In the last year we've seen a new trend in 
powerful but easy-to-use personal computers. 
First we saw Lisa with its windows, icons, roll- 
down menus, and the mouse to control them. 
Now Microsoft and VisiCorp are developing 
window-based systems for the IBM PC. Soon 
we can expect to see this new software technol- 
ogy on all Apples. 

In this month's article, we're going to take a 
look at just what makes the Lisa-like user inter- 
face so attractive, and we'll see how we can 
have some of those same features on our Apple 
ns now. 

The Lisa's most characteristic feature is the 
visual appeal of its menus and screen displays. 
The Lisa uses graphic symbols to represent the 
available application programs or features 
within a program. Of course, the Lisa has an 
extremely high-resolution screen so it can dis- 
play very small icons that still have consid- 
erable detail. 

The user moves a mouse to select the desired 
program or function. Since there's no mouse on 
the Apple n, we must settle for cursor control 
keys or joysticks. This month's program will 
use keyboard controls. 

The use of icons can make it easier to run a 
program, because you don't have to read a com- 
plicated menu. You simply look for the symbol 
of the function you wish to execute and point at 
it. This makes the system much easier to learn, 
because DOS commands aren't required. It also 
minimizes the need for typing. 

Another advantage of icons is that they can 
depict everyday objects that represent the func- 
tion they activate. On the Lisa, for example, the 
icon for deleting a file is a wastebasket. Thus, 



the user no longer needs to think in terms of de- 
leting a file; instead, he is throwing away a 
document. This is a big advantage over most 
menus, which tend to use too many technical 
terms for the average user and are often am- 
biguous as well. 

The age-old saying holds true for comput- 
ers: A picture is worth a thousand words. In the 
next few years, we are going to see many pro- 
grams use icons or graphic depictions. This 
month's Basic Solution will present an example 
of how you can do graphic menus on your stan- 
dard Apple He. 

Since the majority of information in the stan- 
dard office is held in a file cabinet, the program 
begins by displaying a three-drawer cabinet. 
Each drawer has a label describing the informa- 
tion that is stored within. 

The left and right arrow keys can be used to 
move an inverse bar from file drawer to file 
drawer. Once a file drawer has been selected 
(by placing the inverse bar over the drawer 
name), pressing return will open the drawer. 
This corresponds to running a particular pro- 
gram. It is important to note that only the top 
drawer contains information in the Basic Solu- 
tion example. The bottom two drawers are for 
your own programming improvements. 

Select the top file drawer, called Stocks, and 
press return. When the drawer is opened, the 
user is presented with seven file folders inside 
the drawer. Each folder has a top tab with a 
name on it. Once again, the arrow keys are used 
to move the inverse bar up and down the tabs on 
the file folders. If you wish to close the drawer 
and go back to the file cabinet, simply press the 
left arrow key to move the bar above the top 
folder tab. If you wish to open one of the fold- 
ers, simply place the inverse bar on the folder 
and press return. 

Once a file folder has been selected and 
opened, the contents are displayed on the 
screen. At the top of the display, you will still 
see the tab format of the file folder. Each file 
folder contains information about your purchase 
of a particular stock from the stock exchange. 
At the bottom of the display you are given three 
options: to edit the file, move the table up, or

move the table down. We'll explain this later. 

Let's first edit the file. Select the first op- 
tion, and you'll be asked for the stock title. 
Enter Apple Computer. You will then be asked 
for the purchase date and then for the price per 
share. The date can be entered in any format 
that doesn't use commas. If you wish, you can 
look up the current price of Apple and enter that 
value, followed by the number of shares you de- 
cided to purchase and the amount of commis- 
sion the stockbroker charged you. Then enter 
the current interest rate you were receiving for 
the money in your savings account. This should 
be in decimal format. For instance, a 5 '4 per- 
cent interest rate would be entered as .0525. 

After you've entered these values, the dis- 
play will be redrawn with the information that 
you put in. 

At the bottom of the folder there is a table 
containing the price of the stock, your thirty- 
day profit, your ninety-day profit, and your one 
hundred and eighty-day profit based on selling 
the stock at the prices indicated on the left. As 
you can see, you have immediately lost money. 
This is because you paid a commission on the 
purchase, but the table assumes that you're sell- 
ing the stock for the same price you paid, ex- 
cluding the commission. By selecting the other 
options available to you, table up or table down, 
the selling price of the stock can be increased or 
decreased so you can find your break-even and 
profit points. In other words, the program will 
tell you how much the stock has to increase in 
value before you will actually be making any 
money . 

Notice that the longer you keep the stock, 
the more interest you have lost. This is because 
the money is not in a savings account, and the 
stock will have to go higher in order for you to 
get your money back. Once you have entered all 
the values, simply press return and the folder 
will be placed back into the file cabinet. It is 
also saved on disk. You will again be presented 
with the open file drawer. The name of the 
stock you entered is now on the top of the tab. 
You can close the file drawer and exit the pro- 
gram, or else enter, edit, or examine data on 




some other stock. 

This entire program could have been done 
with normal text menus, and it probably would 
have taken up less disk space. However, the 
graphic presentation of the file cabinet and 
folders should make the program easier to use 
and a little more enjoyable.

MICIIOBUFFERII+ 




Pictured here, our MicrobuKer 11+ , with leatures to compiemenl the Apple'"' 
Computers Just one model in the lull line ol MicroDutlers designed to 
accomodate virtually every computer/printer combination 



Like all Microbuffer models, the 
Microbuffer 11+ eliminates waiting 
for your printer to finish before you can 
use your computer again. It allows you to 
print and process simultaneously. 

But the Microbuffer 11+ has one unique 
quality not found in any other Microbuffer: 
it can be used with virtually any printer- 
serial or parallel, or both at once! 

If you have an Apple II, 11+ , We and 
more than one printer, Microbuffer 11+ 
can eliminate a tremendous bottleneck. 

While your parallel printer is going at 
full speed, your serial printer can be 
printing the same file or a different file 
right along with it. And you can be using 
the Apple to do something else at the 
same time. 

The Microbuffer 11+ printer interface 
will fuUy support the Apple He 80-column 
format. And it allows an 80-column screen 
dump from the Videx 80-column board in 
your Apple II or 11+ . 

Perhaps, best of all, Microbuffer 11+ is 
versatile and smart. It supports over 30 
commands for text formatting, sending 
printer controls, printing screen dumps and 
setting up the Mn+ itself. AND it in- 
cludes graphics print routines for nine 
popular printers as well as 8 additional 
graphics printing commands. Whether you 
have 1 printer or 2, Microbuffer gives you 
the maximum amount of printing flexibility 
in the minimum amount of time. 

The new Microbuffer 11+ is available 
now in 16K, 32K, and 64K models. Ask 
your dealer for a demonstration, or for 
further information.

ASM 18 



Apple recently released version 1 . 1 of Apple III Pascal . The new ver- 
sion has a number of significant improvements and enhancements, one of 
which is a special utility program to change the Pascal system volume 
designation. The system volume is the disk that contains System. Pascal 
and System. miscinfo in its root directory. 

Formerly, in version 1 .0, the Pascal floppy disk that was used to boot 
the system was automatically designated the system volume. That par- 
ticular disk had to remain in Apple Ill's built-in drive; if you removed it, 
Pascal soon demanded its return. In practice, this constant swapping of 
disks effectively rendered the built-in floppy drive useless for any other 
purpose. Most programmers simply gave up and bought an extra drive. 

Pascal 1.1 solves that problem. Version 1.1 comes with a program 
called Pmove. code which allows you to assign the system volume to any 
block device you own. Normally you will want to designate a hard disk 
such as ProFile. It is desirable, of course, to have all the system files on 
hard disk because execution is faster and all the files are immediately 
available when needed. 

The only drawback is that most system files— all those with the prefix 
"System." and a few others— must reside within the hard disk's root 
directory, where they are constantly in the way. There is, in fact, scarce- 
ly ever any need to look at the names of system files. You already know 
where they are located, and they are accessed only by single-key com- 
mands within the Pascal system. But every time you catalog the hard disk 
directory, there they are, forcing you to hunt around among all those ex- 
tra file names to find the files you seek. 



The accompanying patch program permits you to move all system 
files into a subdirectory where they remain bundled together, out of the 
way. It is similar to a patch for version 1.0 published in the February 
1983 Softalk, but much simpler. The previous patch also had to reassign 
the system volume, a task now accomplished by Pmove. code. In version 
1.1, moving the files into a subdirectory is easy — so easy, in fact, that 
it's surprising that Apple did not include this option in Pmove. code.

Locations changed from "." to "/." 



The patch changes file name strings in a number of Pascal system 
files from "System.xxxxx" to "System/xxxxx," thereby tricking Pascal 
into looking for its system files in the subdirectory "System." 

The accompanying table summarizes the locations involved. These 
changes do not affect the various work files. Pascal will still place all 
work files in the hard disk root directory. Furthermore, the system 
volume is not reassigned to the subdirectory. It remains the root direc- 
tory of your hard disk, but that root directory will contain only a single 
listing for the subdirectory named System. Finally, as a small bonus, the 
program changes the error message displayed when the hard disk is not 
yet on-line during boot. 

Instructions. The first step is to execute the program Pmove. code 
following the instructions contained in that program. Pmove. code will 
modify the Pascal boot file SOS.interp to reassign the Pascal system 
volume to the hard disk. It's a good idea, at this point, to place all Pascal 
system files temporarily into the hard disk root directory and to confirm 
that the system boots and runs correctly. 

Next, make a subdirectory called ".name/system," where ".name" 
is the SOS device nane of your hard disk, and copy all Pascal system 
files (except SOS files) into this subdirectory. Remove the prefix 
"System." from all file names that contain it, with the exception of 
System. syntax. Leave System. syntax and the remaining file names un- 
changed. It's okay to have both of the following files in the subdirectory 
at the same time. Pascal will not confuse thdm: 

file Library (derived from System. library) 



fde Library code (a program that always had that name) 
The directory structure should now appear: 

/PROFILE (volume name of hard disk) 

SYSTEM (subdirectory name) 

PASCAL (files in subdirectory) 

MISCINFO 
EDITOR 
FILER 
LIBRARY 
SYSTEM. SYNTAX 
ERRORS.6502 

and so on. 

Upon running this patch program, you'll be asked for the same infor- 
mation required by Apple's program Pmove. code: the SOS device name 
of your hard disk (the new system volume), and the SOS device name of 
the disk containing SOS.interp (already modified once by Pmove. code). 
The patch makes a second modification to SOS.interp and also modi- 
fies the following system files: Pascal, Filer, Compiler, Linker, 
Library. code, Libmap.code, and Setup. code. All these files (except 
SOS.interp) must be present in the System subdirectory. 

After successful execution of this program, you may reboot your Ap- 
ple III with a Pascal first-stage boot disk containing SOS. kernel, 
SOS. driver, and the twice-modified SOS.interp. Pascal will look for its 
system files in the subdirectory. You may remove the old, unmodified 
files from the hard disk's root directory.

Words and Actions 



"Assemby Language Spoken Here." There is a place in your Apple 
where assembly language, or something very much like it, is the normal 
working language for all activities. If the Apple can be said to "think to 
itself in a "language"— and in one sense, that's a literal description of 
what actually goes on in running a program — then the language it thinks 
in is similar to assembly language. Not similar in form, of course— the 
Apple thinks to itself in electric pulses— but similar in structure: using 
almost the same rules of logic and syntax and handling information in the 
same ways. 

In a human mind, assembly language is a set of logical blocks that can 
be assembled into a program. In a machine "mind"— the circuit board of 
the Apple— assembly language becomes a set of electronic signals that 
open or close gates in various integrated circuits on the board and steer 
other electronic signals from one place to another. 

This similarity of structure between assembly language and machine 
language is what makes assembly language so powerful— and so difficult 
to learn. It's difficult because it's very different from any human lan- 
guage; in fact it's not really a "language" at all but rather a set of in- 
structions (and the rules for using them). However, these instructions are 
the ultimate buUding blocks of any program (or "language") that your 
Apple can understand: If you know how to use these instructions, you 
can control any and all of the capabilities of the system. 

Note to experts: This month, in honor of January and beginnings, we 
are going to cover some background material: how information gets 
around in the Apple and what really happens while running a program. If 
you're into electronics already, this may be old stuff to you; but if not— 
and especially if you wonder what the Apple is actually doing with those 
funny numbers you type in through the Monitor— then this is for you. 

The Microprocessor. Most of the activities in the Apple are directed 
by a single integrated circuit, called a microprocessor. This chip reads 
instructions from the system's memory, decodes them, and moves data 
around (or modifies them) accordingly. The type of microprocessor used 
in the Apple is called a 6502; and assembly language, for the Apple, is 
simply the set of instructions that the 6502 can understand and execute. 

The microprocessor can do four different kinds of things: It can read 
a number from memory, it can write a number into memory, it can 
change a number (by adding another number to it, for example), and it 
can test a number and do something based on the result of the test. Oh, it 
does other things as well, but never mind them— these four are the capa- 
bilities you can control with assembly language instructions. 

That may not sound like much— read, write, modify, or test a 



number; but if you think about it, that's all you need. If the information 
you're working with can be expressed in the form of numbers, those four 
capabilities will let you do anything you want with the information; store 
it, retrieve it, sort or classify it, modify it in any way you can define, or 
whatever. And of course we can express letters in the form of numbers 
(there's a well-established set of rules for that, called ASCII code), so the 
system can handle text as well as numbers. 

Several Kinds of Numbers. You have probably heard the Apple 
described as an eight-bit system. That means that the microprocessor 
thinks to itself in words that are eight bits long. A bit (short for binary 
digit) is a two- valued number: It can be either 0 or 1, but nothing else. 

What good is a number that can have only two values? More than you 
might think. For one thing, it's useful as a yes/no indicator: It can be 
used to record whether or not something has happened or to select 
whether or not something will happen. It can reflect any kind of two- 
valued situation: light or dark, hot or cold, stop or go, ready or not, you 
name it. 

One bit, all by itself, is not much use for counting (which is what we 
normally use numbers for); but it's not all by itself— there are eight of 
them in a word, remember. With one bit, you can only count two possi- 
bilities, "something" or "nothing"; but with two bits you can count 
something or nothing here, and something or nothing there — a total of 
four possibilities. Add a third bit and you will be able to keep track of 
here and there yesterday, and here and there today— eight possibilities. 
And so on— each bit you add to the string doubles the quantity of things 
you can count. With eight bits, you can count from 0 to 255. 

If you put two eight-bit words together to get sixteen bits (the Apple 
does this automatically in some situations), you can count up to 
65,535— which is why we say that the Apple has a 64K address space (K 
means thousand, from the Greek kilo; we don't call it 65K because 65 is 
hard to divide in half or quarters or eighths, which you sometimes need 
to do with memory areas). 

The reason we use binary (two-valued) numbers is that they're easy 
for the electronic circuits to work with. It's easy to test whether an input 
is high or low (voltage measurement); but to discriminate among high, 
low, and intermediate can be very tricky. In electronics, tricky usually 
means both expensive and error-prone; so we designed the hardware to 
run on binary numbers and then wrote software to convert the results to 
decimal numbers, which we're more used to. 

That's fine, if you're using Basic; but if you're working in assembly 
language, you need (sometimes) to look at a number the same way the

APPLE II Outperforms IBM PC 

with 'Supermini' 
Virtual Memory Technology 



If you need to get SERIOUS, POWERFUL, PROFES- 
SIONAL results from your II + /e, for Business or Engineer- 
ing applications, nothing comes close to MegaTASK PLUS! 
Modelled on and developed from minicomputer-based com- 
mercial timesharing software available to large corporations 
for thousands of dollars annually, MegaTASK PLUS is 
primarily designed for the APPLE II owner who demands 
quick, effective analytical solutions to business pro- 
blems — and immediate RELIEF from the frustrations and 
limitations of using hundreds of dollars of mutually- 
incompatible canned' software packages, or WORSE, pro- 
gramming in Applesoft, assembly or Apple DOS! 

MegaTASK PLUS is a combined, multi-product hardware- 
and-software package that provides an instant Virtual 
Memory expansion, an Applesoft-compatible SuperBASIC, 
and a series of Business Management packages that greatly 
enhance the power and value of the APPLE II in both 
systems programming and business applications areas. 
MegaTASK and MegaDOS employ multitasking, virtual 
memory optimization and virtual storage technology, which, 
until now, were limited only to mainframes and the 'super' 
minicomputers. The SMARTCHIP™, an Intel 8748 Single- 
Chip Plug-In Microcomputer, provides sufficient processing 
power to enable your APPLE II to outperform both the IBM 
PC and Apple's new Macintosh computer. Yet, all you need 
to begin is an APPLE II series computer plus one diskette 
drive. And generally, no modification to your existing 
Applesoft programs, assemblies and DOS 3.3 files is necessary. 

MegaTASK and MegaDOS accordingly generate an enor- 
mous enhancement to the power available to the APPLE II 
owner, specifically: 

• Multitasking System processing techniques. (As 
many as 16 PROGRAMS or TASKS can execute at 
one time). 

• The MegaDOS VS/OS (Virtual Memory Operating 
System) can place within reach of your system 
MEGABYTES of Virtual Memory. Largest program 
size: 8 Megabytes. Largest ISAM file: 451 Megabytes. 
Largest transparent core array: 75 million 

FP numbers. 

• 100-400 new Mainframe Basic commands bring 
machine-language speeds to interpretive Basic. 
Powerful instructions comprise extensions to 
Applesoft that include many of the most useful com- 
mands found in FORTRAN, COBOL, PL /I, ADA, 
PASCAL and LOGO. 

• Enormously simplified ease of programming — 
modular, insulated routines, localized variables, 
ability to pass variable names. Dependence on line 
numbers totally removed. 

• Substantially increased speeds: program execution 
(3x-10x), file access (6x-10x), alpha data transfer rate 
(2x-6x), and numeric transfer (>20x). 

On the applications side, the 'PLUS' portion of MegaTASK 
PLUS includes: 

• Hardcopy and screen Business Graphics, Calc, 
Database Management and Word Processing Appli- 
cations Packages — plus Custom Modif lability. 

• Editing Systems & Format-Related Commands 

• Communications /Corporate Data Capture programs 



• Text Manipulators and better-than-TSO Program 
Editors 

• Database Management Systems capable of main- 
taining and sorting Supermini-Size Datafiles. Max- 
imum single transparent file: 5.5 million records (if 
80-chrs ea). File access time independent of file size. 

-• • Report Generators and Strategic Business Analysis 
programs — similar to those used by most of 
America's Fortune 500 Corporations. 

• The only system capable of taking full, transparent 
advantage of one or more Corvus's, Profile's, Ram- 
disks, 5-Megabyte replaceable hard-disk cartridges 
and the coming Laser Disk units, bringing the 
APPLE II up to minicomputer performance. 

The MegaTASK PLUS product package includes: 

• Manuals for MegaTASK, MegaDOS and 
MEGABASE II in sparkling white binders 

• 1 SMARTCHIP™ Memory Management Micro- 
processor 

• Six diskettes PACKED with applications programs, 
including Mega GRAPH, Mega EDIT, Mega TEXT 
and several Report Generator examples. 

• A One-year Replacement Warranty on all products. 

• A 60-day Financial Risk-Free Return Policy. If you 
are not completely satisfied you can return the pro- 
duct in good condition with proof-of-purchase for a 
complete refund. 

• A 14-hour-per-day telephone Hotline to support you 
in your use of the entire MegaTASK PLUS series of 
software packages. 

Because of the much larger amount of memory that is 
available to the Apple's microprocessor through Virtual 
Memory, the increased processing speed, and the integration 
of major applications packages PLUS custom modifiability by 
users who know Basic, MegaTASK PLUS may well surpass 
or replace most of the worthwhile APPLE II program 
packages currently available on the market. With the in- 
troduction of this product, Quantum Leap has made a 
commitment to be the technology leader in the area of busi- 
ness software systems for personal computers. This will be 
achieved through Quantum Leap Technologies' continuing 
Applications Software Package Series — quarterly diskettes 
ana manuals mailed free to purchasers of MegaTASK PLUS 
for one year from date-of-purchase. 

Quantum Leap software systems are designed to give you, 
the user, powerful professional and business tools with which 
to get the day's work done faster, more pleasantly, and more 
professionally. We live in an exciting age for personal com- 1- 
puting. Multitasking and Virtual Memory promises to make 
any computer substantially more powerful than is possible 
with currently limited memory (Byte Magazine Editorial, 
March 1983). Only MegaTASK PLUS offers you these 
technologies. PLUS, standard Applications Packages to 
capitalize on them — all available for your APPLE II!

microprocessor will— bit by bit. Most of the branch instructions, which 
control the sequence of your program, are activated by single bits (BPL 
and BMI, for example, depend on bit seven). There is no direct way to 
tell, from the decimal number, which bits will be set in the binary ver- 
sion: you have to look it up on a chart. 

Of course we could report all numbers in binary form, when writing 
assembly language; but there are a couple of problems with that. We 
usually write eight-bit binary numbers in two groups of four digits, like 
this: 0001 1001 . That uses a lot of space, and it doesn't make much sense 
(would you recognize it as 25?). 

Instead, we use a compromise between the human-recognizable deci- 
mal system and the machine-recognizable binary system: hexadecimal 
numbers. This is a number system to the base sixteen (as decimal is to the 
base ten, and binary is base two). What that means is that you have six- 
teen single-digit numbers (including zero) before you get to 10 the first 
two-digit number, like this: 0123456789ABCDEF10(in this 
system, "10" equals the decimal number 16). We usually indicate hexa- 
decimal numbers with a dollar sign, thus: $10 = 16. 

This may seem like a strange approach. We're stuck with binary, be- 
cause the hardware requires it; but why bother with this hexadecimal 
stuff? Why not just learn binary and be done with it? There's a good rea- 
son: It turns out that hexadecimal makes a very convenient bridge be- 
tween binary and decimal. 

Converting between hexadecimal (commonly called "hex") and 
decimal is relatively simple: not easy — and beyond the scope of this 
month's column (we usually use a lookup table, anyway) — but easier 
than converting between decimal and binary. And the conversion be- 
tween binary and hex is so easy it's almost trivial: Each group of four 
digits in the binary number corresponds to one digit in the hex number. 
That is, 1 1 1 1 = $F = 15, or 0001 0000 = $10 = 16. By using hex as a 
transition system, we only have to learn the binary numbers up to 1111 
(decimal 15) instead of up to 1111 1111 (decimal 255). 

In the Hardware. Earlier, we mentioned that the Apple thinks to it- 
self in eight-bit "words"— that is, it deals with information in units of 
eight bits at a tune. This eight-bit unit is usually called a byte. 



This number, eight, occurs in many places in the Apple. The accumu- 
lator is eight bits wide, and so are most of the other registers (X, Y, stack 
pointer, and status register); the memory is eight bits deep (each memory 
address represents eight one-bit storage locations); and in several places 
on the circuit board there are eight silvery lines side by side— parallel 
conductors that can carry eight bits at a time. 

These parallel conductors are very important: They take care of most 
transfers of information within the system. They are called the data bus 
because of the way they carry all eight bits of a data byte from one place 
to another. The eight bits all get on together, stay on the bus until they 
come to a place where the doors open, and then all get off together. 

What actually happens is more like this. In a read-memory operation, 
such as LDA $300 (read memory address $300 and put the value stored 
there into the accumulator), the microprocessor sends out two signals: A 
read signal goes to all the ICs connected to the bus (memory, input/out- 
put, and others), and a special "this means you" signal goes out to ad- 
dress $300. 

In response, the memory chips that handle address $300 "take over" 
the bus lines, and all the other chips "let go": the eight lines are pulled 
high or low to match the eight bits of the byte stored at $300. Next, the 
microprocessor tests the eight lines (this is where the doors open and the 
data gets off the bus) and sets the eight bits in the accumulator to match. 
Thus, the information at address $300 has been copied into the ac- 
cumulator. 

Note that the microprocessor can use the same set of wires to read 
from many different ICs, as long as it is careful with the "this means 
you" signals (technically called address enable signals). It can even send 
data over the bus itself, by having all the other chips let go and driving 
the data lines itself. Then it sends a write signal (instead of a read signal), 
and the bit pattern on the bus is copied into the address-enable location 
(this corresponds to a ST A instruction, "store contents of accumulator") . 

Addressing. As we noted earlier, the Apple has a 64K address space: 
In other words, it can specify sixty-four thousand different addresses 
(approximately). Technically speaking, it can address any one of 65,536 
different locations.

To represent that many different addresses, you need a binary num- 
ber sixteen bits long: two bytes side by side (or, to put it another way, a 
bus network with sixteen parallel conductors). There is such a bus 
system in the Apple, serving all the ICs on the data bus; it's called (sur- 
prise!) the address bus. The microprocessor chip has sixteen address out- 
put pins, which drive the address bus lines; and various chips on the 
board decode the address bus signals into the necessary enable signals. 

Thus, in order to read a location in memory, the microprocessor 
drives the address lines to indicate the address it wants to read and pulls 
the read/write line high; then, a moment later, it tests the data lines for 
high or low and sets an internal register accordingly. In the meantime, 
the address decoding logic has enabled the proper memory address and 
set the data lines to match the byte stored there; so the microprocessor 
gets an exact copy of the addressed byte. 

The process for writing to a memory location is similar, except that 
the read/write line is pulled low and the data lines are driven by the mi- 
croprocessor and copied by the memory logic. 

In case you're wondering what a memory location consists of, you 
can think of it as eight flip-flops (believe it or not, flip-flop is a technical 
term in electronics), one connected to each line of the data bus. These 
flip-flops have an input, an output, and an enable line. They work like 
this: When a pulse is sent to the enable pin, the output is set to match the 
current state (high or low) of the input pin and is locked there. It will stay 
in that state, regardless of any changes at the input pin, until another 
enable pulse comes along. In other words, it "remembers" the state of 
the input pin whenever it's told to. 

That's one flip-flop. An eight-bit register, or a memory location, uses 
eight of them: one for each bit. The enable lines are connected together, 
so all eight flip-flops react at once— storing the bit pattern that was on 
their inputs when the enable pulse went by. Note that you can read infor- 
mation out of a register without changing it— just test the output pins. 
The only thing that will change the information in a register is to write 
something on top of it, by pulsing the enable line.

accumulator instruction, LDA $1234: This will get the value stored in 
location $1234 and copy it into the accumulator. 

This is a "load absolute" instruction, which is the simplest kind: It 
means "load the value stored at the following address." The machine 
language form of the LDA absolute instruction is $AD. This must be fol- 
lowed by the address you want to load from, $1234; but here there is a 
complication. 

First we need some labels. An address like $1234 is made up of two 
bytes: in this case, the bytes $12 and $34. We call the byte on the left, 
$12, the most significant byte (MSB), or simple the high byte; and the 
other byte, $34, the least significant, or low, byte (LSB). If the reason- 
ing behind those names isn't obvious, we can only refer you to a math 
textbook on positional notation. 

Right, then: The address of the location we want to read from takes 
up two bytes, MSB and LSB, and we know which is which. We usually 
write them high byte first, tiien low byte: MSB, LSB; or $1234. Now we 
come to the tricky part. 

For various reasons, the 6502 microprocessor doesn't use this ar- 
rangement: It likes to get addresses in reverse order, low byte first. Thus 
our assembly language command LDA $1234, translated into machine 
language, becomes $AD $34 $12. 

Actually, that isn't machine language— that's machine-language-on- 
paper. "Real" machine language, as it is "spoken" and understood by 
real machines, consists of electronic pulses. However, we can't see elec- 
tronic pulses (and anyway, these pulses last only for a fraction of a ini- 
crosecond), so we need to represent them in some other form. The bit 
pattern corresponding to $12 is 0001 0010, and that pattern is also what 
you'd find if you measured the voltages in the LSB lines of the address 
bus (at the right moment); so we use $12 to represent, on paper, what the 
machine is saying with its pulses. 

Now that we have the hex numbers that represent the machine lan- 
guage form of our assembly language command, we will stow them in 
memory, starting at address 300. $AD (in its binary form, 1010 1101) 
goes into the eight flip-flops at $300, $34 (as 001 1 0100) goes into $301, 
and $12 (0001 0010) goes into $302. 

Running It. Now that we've got our instruction loaded into memory, 
let's see what happens when it runs. First we get to it, from Applesoft, 
by typing call 768—16% is decimal for $300. The end result? The micro- 
processor will put the number $300 into its program counter and send 
that out over the address lines while it pulls the read/write line high. 

Out on the circuit board, the address decoding chips will read the ad- 
dress lines and send out the proper enable signal; the contents of location 
$300, 1010 1 101 (or $AD) will be put on the data bus. 

When the microprocessor reads that byte, it recognizes that this in- 
struction should be followed by an address; so it increments the program 
counter to address the following byte and puts it out on the address bus 
again. This time, memory responds by putting 0001 0010 ($12, the ad- 
dress low byte) on the bus. 

The microprocessor reads that, increments the program counter 
again, and asks for the high byte. In the meantime, it can do a little work 
on the low byte, which it already has: It can add an offset from the X or 
Y register, compute a branch according to a test-and-branch instruction, 
or something similar. This is why it likes to get the low byte of the ad- 
dress before the high byte: to give itself time to make these changes 
while something else is happening, so as not to hold up the program. 

Finally, the microprocessor has read the complete address and 
modified the low byte if the instruction required it (not required, in our 
case). Now it disconnects the program counter from the address bus and 
puts this address out on the bus instead, together with a read command on 
the read/write line. That will direct the memory logic to put the ad- 
dressed byte— that is, the contents of memory location $1234 — on the 
bus. At this point, the microprocessor simply copies the bit pattern from 
the data bus into the accumulator, and LDA $1234 has been accom- 
plished. 

The operation of a STA command is very similar, except that the 
read/write line is low; so the microprocessor drives the data lines and the 
memory flip-flops store the bit pattern. LDX and STY are also similar, 
except that the X or Y register is used instead of the accumulator. 

Are you beginning to be able to visualize the processes that go on in 
response to these instructions? Wonderful — now you're learning to think 
like a 6502 microprocessor!

SOFTCARD 
Symposhim 

by Greg Ilbbettsl 




ua ci us 



t T " " 



Welcome to SoftCard Symposium for January. This month we'll con- 
tinue our examination of the BDOS system calls and the building of a 
subroutine library to use them. As you'll recall, we left off last month 
after discussing direct console I/O (function 6). We'll begin this time, 
therefore, with the next character I/O function, print string: 



BDOS function no: 
Function name: 
Function purpose: 
Entry parameters: 

Exit parameters: 



Print string 

Send string to current console device 
[C] = 09H 

[DE] = Address of string 
none 



The print string function is the means by which an entire collection of 
characters (a string) may be sent to the console device in a single opera- 
tion. The alternative would be to output each character of the string in- 
dividually, using BDOS console output (function 2), which we examined 
last month. Before we look at print string, can you think of an instance in 
which we might wish to use single-character printing in place of the print 
string function? 

One that comes to mind immediately is the situation in which we've 
been using direct character output to prevent the user from prematurely 
aborting our program. In such a case, using print string would allow 
BDOS to begin trapping keyboard input again, and thus our total control 
of the system would be lost. Another situation in which single-character 
printing should be used is when we want to print partial strings — every- 
thing up to a certain character, for example. Printing the characters one 
at a time allows us to test for that certain character and to stop printing 
when it is reached. Although single-character printing is occasionally 
necessary in these and other situations, it is much more efficient to use 
the print string function where possible. 

Using print string requires that you have the string in memory at a lo- 
cation known to your program. Further, the string must be terminated by 
a dollar sign character ($)— that is, the dollar sign must be the last char- 
acter of the string. Register pair [DE] is then loaded with the memory ad- 
dress of the string, and the function number (9) is loaded into register 
[C]. When the BDOS command processor is invoked (by calling or 
jumping to location 0005H), BDOS proceeds to output each character in 
sequence, stopping as soon as the dollar sign is encountered. Tabs are 
expanded to some number of spaces (just as they are in BDOS function 
2), and the BDOS process of testing for input is active. Contrary to what 
the CP/M documentation states, control-P (the printer on/off toggle char- 
acter) is not tested for. Only control-S is noticed— and then only if it is 
the first character typed; this is also set up just the way it is in function 2. 

The string won't be printed automatically with a trailing carriage re- 
turn (ODH) or a line feed (OAH). Should you wish to incorporate either a 
carriage return or a line feed, you'll have to include them as part of the 
string or send them out separately. Our subroutine for function 9 takes 
this into account; consequently, it is a little more complex than it would 
otherwise be. This subroutine is integrated into our collection as follows:

with the other functions, just after DIROUT. The remainder of our addi-

tions are separate and are included to provide some flexibility in screen 
output. 

There will be many occasions when you'll want your programs to 
output a carriage return/line-feed sequence— to skip a line on the screen 
or perhaps to move to the next line after the user has responded to a ques- 
tion. Outputting these characters using function 2 at each such place in 
your program is tedious and inefficient. As an alternative, we have 
created a subroutine that simply prints this combination. It is labeled 
CARLF in our listing, and it may be called from any point in your 
program. 

The CARLF subroutine works by using the STROUT entry to print a 
string consisting of a carriage return (ODH), a line feed (OAH), and the 
termination character ($). This sequence will hereafter be called a 
CRLF. You'll notice that register pair [DE] is being preserved by the 
CARLF routine. This is being done because we'll be calling CARLF 
from other routines where [DE] contains valid data that must not be lost. 

Now that we have the CARLF subroutine, we can use it to create a 
very flexible system of screen output. Essentially, there are four condi- 
tions of string printing that should be allowed for: the need to print both 
a leading CRLF and a trailing CRLF; the need to print only a trailing 
CRLF; the need to print only a leading CRLF; and situations in which 
there's no need for CRLF to be printed. 

A leading CRLF is required during normal output when it is desirable 
to skip a line between output strings or when we simply wish to ensure 
that we are starting at the beginning of a line. A trailing CRLF is neces- 
sary to ensure that, after our string is printed, the cursor moves to the be- 
ginning of the next line. Obviously, there will be times, such as when our 
programs are asking questions, that we'll want the cursor to remain on 
the same line as the question. In such cases, we won't want the trailing 
CRLF. Similarly, there will be times, such as when we have printed the 
first item after a clear screen/home cursor function, that we won't want 
the leading CRLF. The screen output subroutines shown in the example 
satisfy all of these conditions. 

Calling the CARLF subroutine prior to printing the string results in a 
leading CRLF. A trailing CRLF is obtained by falling through to 
CARLF after the string has been printed. The subroutines are labeled ac- 
cording to how they perform. Those that print a leading CRLF have 



labels starting with CR (CRMSG and CRMSGQ). Those that don't print 
the leading CRLF have labels beginning with MSG (MSGOUT and 
MSGOUQ). Finally, the ones that don't print the trailing CRLF are iden- 
tified by the use of a Q, for question, as the last character in their labels 
(CRMSGQ and MSGOUQ). This arrangement makes it easier to remem- 
ber which of the print subroutines to use to obtain the appropriate format, 
and there are enough subroutines to allow for the printing of virtually any 
combination of questions, responses, and messages. 

The next character function we'll examine is the read console buffer 
function: 



BDOS function no: 
Function name: 
Function purpose: 
Entry parameters: 

Exit parameters: 



10 

Read console buffer 

Obtain string from console device 

[C] = OAH 

[DE] = Address of buffer 
Console characters in buffer 



The read console buffer function allows you to have BDOS collect 
and process large amounts of input with a single system call. The alterna- 
tive is to use BDOS console input (function 1) within a very complex 
routine. A routine using function 1 becomes complex because a user en- 
tering input is apt to mistype characters, backspace, start new lines, and 
so on. Your routine would therefore have to be capable of recognizing 
each of these special characters and performing on-screen editing to han- 
dle them, as well as deciding which to keep as valid input and which to 
discard as edit characters. The read console buffer function forces BDOS 
to handle all that business for you. It gets BDOS to obtain characters 
from the keyboard, place them in an area of memory you choose, per- 
form all screen echo, process any editing characters, and, finally, to 
return to you either when a carriage return is entered or when the max- 
imum number of characters you specify has been received. 

Using this function requires that you designate an area in memory to 
use as the input buffer. The area most often chosen is the 128-byte space 
between 80H and the beginning of the TPA at 1(X)H. It's important to re- 
member, however, that this area is also the default disk buffer. This 
means that you cannot leave buffered console input in this area, perform

should either move characters received to a safe place before any disk ac- 
tivity, or get in the habit of defining your own disk I/O buffers. 

After the console buffer has been designated, it must be initialized. 
All you must do in order to initialize the buffer is to determine the max- 
imum number of characters you'll accept from the user and inform 
BDOS by placing that value in the buffer's first memory location. BDOS 
will use this value to decide when to terminate the function if the user 
does not type a carriage return. Once the maximum input value has been 
stored in the buffer, the buffer address is loaded into the [DE] register 
pair, a OAH is loaded into the [C] register, and a call to BDOS is made. 

During BDOS's input operation, a number of special characters are 
recognized and acted upon as shown in the accompanying list. 



Character Purpose 

rubout/delete This character removes the character preceding it 
from the input buffer. It is similar to a normal 
backspace, but it also echoes the removed 
character to the screen. For example, when 
corrected with rubout, a mistype such as DI5 
instead of DIR appears as DI55R. 

control-C This causes a warm boot to be performed when 

and only when it is entered as the first character of 
input. 

control-P This is the printer on/off toggle and activates the 
system pnnter until another control-P is typed. It 
does not affect the input and needn't be the first 
character typed. 

control-E This character causes the cursor to drop to the 

beginning of the next line. It does not cause the 
input function to be terminated, nor does it affect 
input in any way. 

control-H This is the backspace character; it causes the 

cursor to move back one character position. That 
character is then removed from the buffer and the 
screen. 

control-J This character causes a line feed and terminates the 

input sequence the same way a carriage return 
does. 

control-M This is the carnage return character (the same as 
the return key). It terminates the input line. 

control-R This character causes BDOS to print a # on the line, 
then a CRLF sequence, and finally the contents of 
the edited buffer. The cursor is left on the new line 
following the buffer contents, and input is not 
terminated. This character is normally used to 
remove the echoes and deleted characters left on 
the screen when the delete or rubout character has 
been used for editing. 

control-U This character performs the same action as control- 

R, except that the buffer is cleared, no characters 
are pnnted on the new line, and input is started 
from scratch. 

control-X This character removes all input from the buffer and 

the screen by backspacing to the column the 
cursor was in when the input function was called. 



You can examine the special characters list for yourself simply by 
looking at the CCP. It uses the read console buffer function in obtaining 
all of its input. 

When control returns to your program, your value for maximum in- 
put will still be in the first memory location of the buffer. In the buffer's 
second location, BDOS will have placed the number of characters ac- 
tually received, with the characters themselves stored in sequential mem- 
ory locations following that value. None of the special characters men- 
tioned in the previous list is stored in the buffer or counted in the total, 
not even the carriage return or line feed that terminated input. If fewer 
than the maximum number of characters were received, the memory lo- 
cations in the remaining portion of the buffer will be left untouched by 
BDOS. For this reason, it is often useful to initialize the buffer to zero or 
some rare value, such as OEEH, before making the call. Your program 
can then find the end of input by calculating the last character position 
from the value passed back by BDOS, or by testing for the rare charac- 
ter, whichever best suits your situation. 

Our subroutine for the read console buffer function is relatively 



straightforward. We'll add the function itself to our other functions and 
create a setup subroutine to control it as follows:

As you can see, we have labeled the function entry point BUFFIN 
and placed it just after STROUT. The controlling subroutine has been 
labeled GETSTR and placed just ahead of the string-print subroutines. 

GETSTR is used by loading the address of the console input buffer 
into register pair [DE], loading the maximum characters desired into 
register [A], and calling GETSTR. GETSTR, in turn, sets the maximum 
input value into the buffer, saves the buffer start address for later, and 
calls the function entry point at BUFFIN. Upon its return, GETSTR re- 
stores the buffer address and increments [DE] to point to the actual num- 
ber of characters received. Register [A] is then loaded with this value, 
and a logical OR of [A] with itself is performed to set the Z-80's zero 
flag before returning to your program. The zero flag reflects either no in- 
put received (Z) or some input received (NZ). GETSTR then returns to 
the portion of the program calling it, which will know immediately from 
the zero flag status whether or not input was received, and thus whether 
or not to attempt processing. 

In cases where you wished always to receive input, you could add ad- 
ditional instructions prior to the RET that would decrement [DE] back to 
the buffer start address and jump to GETSTR again. Or, in the manner of 
our STATUS subroutine, you could add a test of a loop variable to de- 
cide whether to return without input and thereby make loop/no loop a 
variable feature controlled by your program. 

The next functions we'll examine are get lOBYTE and set lOBYTE, 
the final character I/O functions: 



BDOS function no: 
Function name: 
Function purpose: 
Entry parameters: 
Exit parameters: 

BDOS function no

Exit parameters: 



Get lOBYTE 

Obtain the current value of lOBYTE 

[C] = 07H 

[A] = lOBYTE value 



Set lOBYTE 

Install new lOBYTE value 
[C] = 08H 

[E] = New lOBYTE value 
none 



These two functions are very simple. They are used to read and mod- 
ify the lOBYTE value located at 0003H in the system data page. As we 
have discussed in the past, this value is used by the BIOS to determine 
which of several physical devices is active for each of the logical de- 
vices—namely, CON:, LST:, RDR:, and PUN:. Manipulation of this 
value, therefore, is necessary in order to switch between one physical 
device and another— say, between the CRT: device and the TTY: device 
for the logical console (CON:). 

The lOBYTE value is a single byte that is separated into four parts to 
match the four logical devices. The high-order two bits (6 and 7) corre- 
spond to the list device (LST:), the next two (bits 4 and 5) to the punch 
device (PUN:), the next two (bits 2 and 3) correspond to the reader de- 
vice (RDR:), and the low-order two bits (bits 0 and 1) to the console 
device (CON:). Since only four values (0, 1, 2, and 3) can be repre- 
sented in a two-bit number, it is apparent that only four choices of physi- 
cal devices can be made. Since we covered this process thoroughly in our 
discussion of the BIOS, we'll just list the four physical devices for each 
logical device and not go into further explanation here. The physical 
devices are listed here in order of their associated two-bit values in the 
lOBYTE field:

TTY

Physical Devices 

, CRT:, BAT:, UC1: 
, RDR:, UR1:, UR2; 
, PUN:, UP1:, UP2: 
, CRT:, LPT:, UL1: 



The get lOBYTE and set lOBYTE functions are added to our subrou- 
tine library in the same way as the other functions and become just two 
more labels in the list. They are shown in the final version of the listing 
in this installment, but in the interests of space we'll refrain from dupli- 
cating the entire listing here. 

This completes our discussion of the character I/O functions. Before 
going on to the miscellaneous and disk I/O functions, however, let's put 
some of the knowledge we've gained to use and design a few character 
I/O subroutines for inclusion in our library. 



One of the more useful collections to include, especially if you're 
doing formatted screen output, is the group of special character strings 
that make up the BIOS terminal screen functions. (Note: These must not 
be confused with BDOS functions! As we saw in our di.scussions on the 
BIOS, the screen functions are the small groups of one to four characters 
that cause BIOS to clear the screen, select inverse or normal mode, posi- 
tion the cursor, and so on.) 

Even if you have changed the specific characters in your BIOS screen 
function tables with the CONFIGIO program, you can still use these sub- 
routines just by modifying the values in the table we'll create. For this 
column, we will use the default values contained in the BIOS software 
screen function table when the SoftCard is shipped— the SOROC IQ 
120/IQ 140. 

Most of these screen function subroutines can be created simply by 
making the characters into strings in memory and using a single call to 
MSGOUQ to print them. The only exception to this is the cursor-posi- 
tioning function. Since the values for the various line and character posi- 
tions must be transmitted as simple binary numbers, it is possible for one 
of those numbers to equal the value of the string termination character 
($). In such a case, BDOS quits printing the string early, and BIOS is 
waiting for the final value(s). BIOS will, of course, take the final 
value(s) from whatever the next output happens to be. To correct this 
problem, we have created a separate routine to print the cursor-position- 
ing function that sends the lead-in characters via MSGOUQ and then 
transmits the X and Y coordinates individually through PUTCHR. 

Our completed screen function subroutine package contains all nine 
of the standard terminal functions plus two special functions that enable 
the user to move the cursor to the bottom left corner of the screen (BOT- 
TOM) and to clear an entire line (CLRLIN). 

In source code form the screen function subroutine package looks 
like this:

JANUARY 1984 



As you can see, for those three screen functions that require only a 
single character (HOMCUR, CURSUP, and CURFWD), we use the 
PUTCHR entry point to send the character to BDOS, and we employ the 
technique of skipping two bytes with the 21H op-code. For multi- 
ple-character screen functions, such as CLRSCN and CLREOL, we use 
the BDOS print-string system call via MSGOUQ. For this reason, the 
multicharacter screen functions can be of any length and in tabular form, 
as we have shown. While this is the most flexible method, there are two 
other ways to organize these subroutines to save further space. The sub- 
routines will not be as flexible when organized in either of these other 
ways, but in your own environment that may not be a disadvantage. 

The first method requires that the multicharacter screen function ta- 
ble not cross a page boundary— that is, the table must be contained com- 
pletely within a single page of memory. In more specific terms, this 
means that the addresses of all the table entries must fall between nnOOH 
and nnFFH, where nn is the high byte of the address— also known as the 
page number. Using the first memory page of the TPA (page 1) as an ex- 
ample, all the table addresses must fall between OlOOH and OlFFH. 

If we can make sure that no page boundaries have been crossed, then 
we will know for certain that all table entries have the same high address 
byte, and we won't need to load the [DE] register pair with the entire ta- 
ble address of the function. Rather, we can simply load the [E] register 
with the low byte of the address, use our 2 1 H op-code trick to skip the re- 
maining two-byte loads of [E], and then load the [D] register with the 
high byte of the table. It should be noted that this somewhat defeats the 
purpose of a general subroutine library. We lose a lot of generality when 
we are forced to ensure specific memory usage. In case you wish to use 
this method, however, an example of how it would look for the last few 
screen functions is shown here: 



CLREOL: 


LD 


E.LOWCLEOL 


: Clear to end of line 




DB 


21H 


; Skip 2 bytes 


NORMAL: 


LD 


E,LOW LOLIT 


; Normal characters 




DB 


21H 


; Skip 2 bytes 


INVERS: 


LD 


E,LOW HILIT 


; Inverse characters 




LD 


D.HIGH CPOS 


; Beginning of table 




JP 


MSGOUT 


; Send it and return to caller 



If you do plan to use this method, it's a good idea to place a page 
boundary test in the source code for your table that will inform you at as- 
sembly time whether the table is still within a single page. The specific 
test itself will depend on the assembler you are using and its abilities; the 
test shown following the screen function table below is correct for Mi- 
crosoft's Macro-80 assembler: 



CPOS: 


DB 


1BH,'=$' 


Cursor position sequence 


CLEAR: 


DB 


1BH,'*$' 


Clear entire screen 


CLEOS: 


DB 


1BH,'Y$' 


Clear to end of screen 


CLRLN: 


DB 


ODH 


Go start of line 


CLEOL: 


DB 


1BH,T$' 


Clear to end of line 


LOLIT: 


DB 


1BH,')$' 


Low lite (normal) 


HILIT: 


DB 


1BH,'($' 


High lite (inverse) 




IF 


(HIGH HILIT + 2)- 


(HIGH CPOS) 




.PRINTX * OOPS! Table crossed page boundary! * 




ENDIF 







This test prints the message, * OOPS! Table crossed page boundary! * 
to the screen at assembly time if the beginning of the table extends into 
the previous page or if the end of the table extends into the following 
page. This is accomplished by means of the Macro-80 pseudo-op (a non- 
Z-80 op-code that the assembler understands) .PRINTX, which means 
"print to terminal." Enclosing this pseudo-op inside a conditional 
IF... ENDIF pair ensures that the message will be printed only if the 
argument to IF is true. 

The argument in this case is an expression made up of a single sub- 
traction—the high byte (page number) of the start of the table and the 
high byte of the end of the table. HILIT -I- 2 is the address of the ter- 
minator ($) in the HILIT sequence and thus the last byte of the table as 
well. Obviously, if the entire table is contained in a single page, the high 
bytes of these two addresses will be identical. By subtracting them, 
therefore, we'll either get 00 (False) or some nonzero value (True). If the 
value is nonzero, we know that the page boundary has been crossed and 
that the message will be printed. 

The second method of shortening the screen function subroutines is to 
count on the individual functions always being two bytes or less. In that 
case, we wouldn't print the screen functions as strings; rather, we would 
simply print the two bytes individually using PUTCHR. The cursor posi- 
tioning function is still treated as a special case, and all four bytes are 
printed using PUTCHR. 

The subroutines as they would appear using this scheme are shown 
here:

Using this method, we have eliminated the table altogether and com- 
bined a few things; the result is a reduction of 20 percent in the size of 
the screen function subroutines. Although the reduction is significant, we 
achieve it at the expense of flexibility and ease of alteration. It will be far 
harder to change this routine to reflect changes in the terminal screen 
fiinction codes. 

The final code we'll install in our subroutine library is the ABORT 
subroutine we mentioned last month, which is referenced in the direct 
console input subroutine we created then. As you'll recall, we said the 
ABORT subroutine was necessary for those cases in which we needed 
to perform some tasks of our own prior to allowing the system to 
warm-boot. 

In its simplest form, the ABORT routine simply prints a message to 
the screen and jumps to location OOOOH to perform the warm boot. The 
ability to perform more complex tasks, such as clearing the screen, ask- 
ing the user to confirm his intentions, and telling the user to reinstall a 
system disk in drive A:, could be added. For demonstration purposes, 
we'll perform the system disk reinitialization. 

The entire subroutine library we've created so far appears below. 
The screen function package, the ABORT subroutine, and the get/set 
lOBYTE BDOS functions have been added. Note that the last form of the 
screen function package is the one used here, and that titles have been 
added for clarity.

The subroutine library shown takes up considerable memory, and it is 
doubtful that you'll use all of these subroutines in any given program. 
Given that, it may appear that the library is of little value to you. How- 
ever, most of the collections are structured in such a way that unneeded, 
individual subroutines can simply be deleted. The recommended practice 
is to use the library as the starting kernel of each assembly language pro- 
gram you write, adding the specific routines to perform your program 
tasks. Then, when your program is finished, you can delete any unused 
subroutines, thereby making the most efficient use of memory. In addi- 
tion to sparing you considerable typing efforts with each new program, 
using the library will give you standard mnemonic names for each sepa- 
rate operation. In order to get a character of user input, you simply call 
GETCHR. No more having to look up the BDOS function numbers or 
wondering how a particular system call operates. 

This completes our discussion of the BDOS character I/O functions. 
Next month we'll examine the miscellaneous functions and make a start 
on the disk functions as well. By the time we're finished, you should 
have a clear understanding of how to use BDOS effectively and a com- 
plete subroutine library to speed your programming. Until then. . .

Because of their isolation Down Under in the Antipodes, New Zea- 
landers often have to find home-grown solutions to problems. New Zea- 
landers have become a versatile and inventive lot. Do-it-yourself is as 
firmly entrenched in the country's national ethos as the game of Rugby 
union football. 

Cycling enthusiast Rex Mcintosh needed a new ten-speed bicycle, but 
he didn't go to a cycle shop. He designed the ten-speed on a computer 
and then built the bike himself. Similarly, when Mcintosh wanted to in- 
troduce computer graphics at Television New Zealand, he developed his 
own system. Money was not available for a fancy standalone setup, 
nor was management. So Rex Mcintosh built a complete system based on 
equipment that wasn't supposed to be suitable: the humble Apple n. 

Down Under the Apple Graphics Tree. That was three years ago. 
Today viewers of New Zealand's two television networks cannot escape 
computer graphics. The output of Apples crops up everywhere: on news 
and magazine programs, children's shows, and one-shot events like the 
Miss New Zealand show or national elections. And the graphics are not 
just simple captions or electronic scorecards for sporting events. They're 
animated, colorful, and sometimes include Apple-generated sounds. 

This story has its genesis in 1979, when Mcintosh, a technician hired 
to service video equipment at the Avalon television studios in New Zea- 
land's capital city of Wellington, was sent on a training course. It was a 
good excuse to buy a Hewlett-Packard HP-25 programmable calculator. 



"I didn't finish the course but I kept the calculator, and that got me 
into progranuning," Mcintosh recalls. The TV studios had installed a 
Digital Corporation PDP-11 to schedule on-air programs, but it was 
somewhat underutilized. "It looked interesting, so I started fiddling 
with it." 

Soon he was fixing software problems and even added a floppy disk 
system, which was a big improvement on paper tape input. But the event 
that changed Mcintosh's life (as it did most of ours) was buying his own 
Apple n. Back in 1979 the Apple was a revelation to the fledgling com- 
puter hacker. 

"I thought this was really for me," remembers Mcintosh. "It had In- 
teger Basic, and that was just fine. It had 16K, a tape input, a miniassem- 
bler, a floating point routine, and so on. And they told all about it! They 
gave circuit diagrams, which were wrong, and they really wanted the 
owner to know what was inside. 

"This really appealed to me. I spent most of my time mucking around 
in the monitor, and I'd sit up in bed at night studying the listings." 

Mcintosh did some limited graphics work on his own machine for the 
television studios, but there were problems synchronizing the Apple to 
the TV system. Mcintosh thought he could see a solution but told the stu- 
dios he wasn't prepared to butcher his own computer in the process. 
They bought him one, and that was quite a breakthrough. Taking on a 
micro was a big step for the broadcasting bureaucracy. 

The hardware problems Mcintosh had to overcome included syncro- 
nizing the screen horizontally and vertically to the television signal and 
producing PAL broadcast standard video output from the Apple. 






JANUARY 1984

Bit by Forth. Emerging unscathed from its modification ordeal, the 
Apple was put to work. Initially Mcintosh programmed in Basic, though 
he was frustrated by its slowness and lack of flexibility. But along came 
another of those significant events that shaped this computerist's career. 
It was buying the August 1980 issue of Byte magazine, which had a spe- 
cial feature on Forth. 

Actually Mcintosh had been shown a primitive version of Forth just 
before the magazine arrived, but he hadn't been able to make any sense 
out of that early version. From the pages of Byte, Forth appeared as 
manna from heaven. 

It was hard-earned manna. 

"I sat there with pages and pages of listings and disassembled the lan- 
guage, writing down in longhand what I thought every word did," says 
Mcintosh. "After that I could see that the version I had wasn't the 
answer." 

Finally Mcintosh heard of a version of Forth being distributed by the 
Forth Interest Group. He sent for a listing and typed it up in assembly 
language. 

"From there I've never looked back," says Mcintosh. 
It took a while to get the FIG Forth up and running. There were some 
bugs, which Mcintosh had been warned of. 

"The FIG people said, 'There it is, you're on your own. Do what you 



like with it: Tart it up and sell it if you like.' " 

Once refined, the language worked fine for the studios' purposes. 
Growing dissatisfied with the Apple U's graphics resolution and limited 
memory, Mcintosh graduated to an Apple III for most of his work. Mc- 
intosh reassembled the language for the larger computer, then decided to 
rewrite his Forth using the Forth language instead of assembler. 

"That allows you enormous flexibility in compiling it," he says. 
"The problem with writing the language in assembler is that you tend to 
leave it alone once it is completed. 

"Now that it's written in Forth I can make changes very easily. In 
fact I tend to toss off new versions once a week when I really get into it. " 

These days the Avalon Apples are totally Forth-based: even their op- 
erating systems. 

"If you're using Forth you should also write the operating system: 
Forth has its own DOS, which is relatively simple and very easy to build 
on. Forth 's theory is that you can have whatever you like, providing 
you're prepared to write it yourself." 

Staying Off the SOS. Mcintosh has never used the Apple Ill's So- 
phisticated Operating System (SOS), even though it can handle a variety 
of languages including Forth. He says Apple was very close-mouthed 
about the ins and outs of SOS, and it was quicker and easier to write a 
Forth DOS than to discover how to bend SOS to his wishes.

JANUARY 1984 



He now considers Forth ideal for work in real-time commercial tele- 
vision graphics. 

"In Forth you're programming all the time. You're actually adding 
to the language, unlike Applesoft— where on the one hand you have a 
language and on the other you have a program. With Forth it's all in 
there together. 

"Forth can't distinguish between words it already knew, like if and 
then, and words you've only just defined. So what you've just typed has 
as much relevance as something that's always been there." 

After continuous revision Mcintosh now considers his version to be 
right up with the commercial versions of Forth and considerably better 
for graphics production than the much-touted GraForth. 

"You can write rubbish, which GraForth will happily accept and 
then go out for lunch when you try to run it. GraForth also runs very 
slowly— three to four times slower than a proper Forth." 

Today's studio system has a couple of extra hardware refinements. A 
Mclntosh-designed card effectively doubles vertical resolution on the 
Apple III by a procedure known as interlacing. Vertical resolution is now 
384 pixels, while the horizontal resolution remains 560 pixels. 

The old Apple II, with its 192 by 280 pixels and smaller memory, 
doesn't get used much now for graphics, but it still has an important role 
in the studios. It's part of a frame-grabbing system that converts analog 
signals from a video camera into digital information, very useful for con- 
verting artwork into digital on-screen graphics. 

It's not surprising that Mcintosh's insistence that he needed a frame- 



grabber got a blank response from management. "Don't worry about 
it," they told him. But to irrepressible Rex Mcintosh, "It seemed like a 
good idea, so I thought forget 'em. I'll have a crack at building my own 
frame-grabber. ' ' 

With a colleague he built a model that "worked a treat." Today even 
the skeptics admit that having a frame-grabber is no luxury but an "abso- 
lute necessity." 

Green Graphics. Consider production on a weekly financial pro- 
gram called Money Report. Mcintosh works in a spartan office housing 
his Apples II and III, printer, television monitor, camera, and various 
electronic black boxes. The walls are liberally decorated with digital 
printout art, including the obligatory Winston Churchill portrait, the 
Mona Lisa, and a giant eight-by-four- foot reproduction of an Escher 
drawing. A large poster advertising Hewlett-Packard calculators cele- 
brates the inspiration that started it all for Mcintosh. 

Everything has to be done on the night of the show, because the 
Money Report is essentially a timely news service. It goes on the air at 
10:30 p.m.; work on the graphics begins at 7:00 p.m. By 9:00 p.m. Mc- 
intosh has usually completed several graphics screens to the director's 
satisfaction, and the Apple in is trundled down the corridor to the pro- 
duction suite. 

Mcintosh sets the graphics up so that he only needs to press the space 
bar to run each one at the director's cue. The graphics may include illus- 
trated charts, animated line graphs, and three-dimensional bar graphs 
that grow on the screen to their appointed height.

The following program listings in the Forth language are examples of 
some of the graphics routines that Mcintosh has created on the Apple in. 
Implementing these routines requires the specific tools that Mcintosh has 
created. As such, the listings are not usable except as inspiration to those 
graphics programmers familiar with Forth.

BACKSOLVING 

If the programs you use now require you to 
rewrite the same equation to solve for different 
unknowns, TKISolver con dramatically improve 
your productivity. Enter your problem once and 
then solve for the unknowns no matter where 
they are in your equation. 

ITERATIVE SOLVING 

If TKISolver can't solve on equation directly, take 
an educated guess at the answer Type the I 
key and the TKISolver program starts with your 
guess and performs repeated approximations 
to converge on the answer. 

LIST SOLVING 

Given a list of input values, TKISolver automati- 
cally calculates the equation for every value in 




your list. For example, if you 
want to know how different 
interest rotes will affect monthly 
loan payments, enter a list of 
interest rotes and let TKISolver 
calculate the payment amount 
for each value. 

UNIT CONVERSIONS 

Any type of unit conversion - 
Fahrenheit to Celsius, meters to 
feet, dollars to deutschmarks, 
newtons to dynes -can be mode 
without altering your equations. 
Just define the numerical relation- 
ship between two units of measure- 
ment and the TKISolver program 
automatically converts the vari- 
able value to the unit you specify.

It's now a pressure situation: one hour in the studio to construct a 
show that goes on the air in an hour and a half. Even though the graphics 
are already in the can, the director may still ask for changes. If he does, 
the computer still has all its Forth-based utilities loaded, and the changes 
are made swiftly and with no fuss. 

For example, one graph employs three-dimensional piles of coins to 
denote quantities of money.. Some adjustment is requested, and this is 
achieved toute de suite by typing " — 3 coins." (Creating the pile in the 
first place was just a matter of typing "10 coins. ") 

Rex Mcintosh and his Apple-generated graphics are an integral part 
of Money Report. The computer-generated look of the graphics lends the 
program a sense of immediacy and modem relevance. Just as important, 
there is no other way to produce so many graphics in such a short time. 
A studio graphic artist comments that regular art production would have 
taken ten hours to complete the same amount of work— five times as long 
as Mcintosh takes — on an easy night. In the past, he has produced thirty 
graphics screens in two hours. 

Money Report uses a house typeface, but a library of twenty-two 
fonts in a variety of sizes is currently available. In a month or two there 
could as easily be thirty fonts. A complete new set can be created in less 
than a day simply by aiming a video camera at a printer's book of font 
styles, transferring a complete set to the computer with the frame-grab- 
ber, then polishing things up with an editing package. 

South Seas Apple. Children's magazine programs are another area 
where Apple graphics are being used to advantage in New Zealand. The 
programs, produced in Christchurch on South Island, include plenty of 
zany graphics and sound effects that appeal to today's kids raised on 
video arcades. The software is Rex Mcintosh's. 

The first big real-time test for the Apple graphics system occurred 
during coverage of the last New Zealand national elections in November 
1981. For the continuous election night coverage, Mcintosh wrote pro- 
grams that allowed easy access to the results — displayed in a variety of 
formats— for individual electoral districts and for the nation as a whole. 

The director could, for example, say, "Let's look at Wanganui, One- 




A digital rendering of Rex Mcintosh, cycling enthusiast, graphics magician, 
and adventure player. 

hunga, and Piako." The program would then extract the latest informa- 
tion from raw figures collected by the studio's Burroughs mainframe. 

The information would then be fed into an Apple n, and the operator, 
with single keystrokes, could display the information as a table of fig- 
ures, line graph, three-dimensional bar graph, or as a graph comparing 
the latest results with the previous election (including the percentage of 
the voting swing). Other keystrokes allowed the operator to move on to 
the next electoral district or to see the national total in all the display 
options.

JANUARY 1984 



Management still didn't trust a home computer to last the distance 
and put two Apple lis on standby. They weren't needed. In fact the net- 
works have never had a breakdown in their Apple computers, even 
though the machines are regularly trundled around studios and flown 
around the country. In Rex Mcintosh's words, "They're as solid as 
a rock." 

The TVNZ Apple graphics system is not so friendly that noncomput- 
erists such as graphic artists can use it comfortably. Mcintosh would like 
to see the package develop into a friendlier tool. A number of other peo- 
ple in the network are using Mcintosh's system successfully at a fairly 
basic operator level. But programming for things as complex as the elec- 
tion night coverage, or for animation, still requires a fair deal of ex- 
pertise. 

Apple's New Zealand distributors recently sent a demo disk to televi- 
sion networks in South Africa, West Germany, and Australia. There was 
some initial interest, though nothing has come of it yet. 

"The things you can show on a demo are pretty much the same as the 
customer has probably already seen or is already doing," Mcintosh says. 
"The demo disk doesn't really bring out the strength of my system, 
which is to let you produce things very quickly and change them easily in 
a real-life broadcasting situation." 

Dramatic Apples. While his computer graphics are up and running 
on New Zealand television, Mcintosh still sees plenty of challenge 
ahead. He's already taken Apples into the drama studios to control spe- 
cial lighting effects. 

His chief problem in graphics production is now limited memory ca- 
pacity, even with the Apple III. Sometimes he even has heretical dreams 
of bigger computers. "There comes a time in graphics when you really 
need horsepower. When you have half a million pixels on the screen and 
about 256 colors, that's a lot of memory to be moving around with a little 
6502," he says. 

But Mcintosh is likely to stay with Apples for a while yet. That's be- 
cause he's discovered the new GRFX-A2 graphics board (produced by 
Number Nine). The GRFX-A2 is based on an NEC 7220 VLSI graphics 



display controller and includes 128K of memory to control the on-screen 
graphics. It gives a screen resolution of 512 by 512 pixels with four thou- 
sand colors (sixteen separate colors on the screen at any one time), or up 
to 1 ,024 by 1 ,024 pixels with two colors. 

Mcintosh recently imported a GRFX-A2 board, with the intention of 
doing free-lance work for film studios and ad agencies, and is excited 
about its potential. He hopes to persuade his employers to get one for 
television graphics, but at a landed cost of $NZ2,500 that won't be easy. 
Eventually he'd like to run two or more boards in parallel, but unfor- 
tunately they only fit the Apple n at present, and there's still that mem- 
ory problem. . . . 

"If you got at it with a hacksaw you'd get a board in an Apple HI, but 
it would stick out the side," Mcintosh says. He'd like Number Nine to 
remake their product to fit an Apple III. He reckons the combination 
would be a far more cost-effective route to top-line television graphics 
than a high-priced standalone custom system. 

New Zealand Zorker. When he's not trying to coax the last little 
graphics bit from his Apples, Mcintosh is still likely to be found at the 
keyboard, adventuring. A long-time fan of the original Adventure, he's 
also fond of the Zorks. But he is completely unmoved by graphics adven- 
tures: "There's no way an Apple graphics screen can compete with the 
rich pictures your own mind can conjure up from a text description." 

Another of Mcintosh's passions is music. An accordionist from way 
back, he now spends a good deal of time making Apple music with a 
Mountain Music System. Which, not surprisingly, he has modified. 

But every so often Mcintosh likes just to climb aboard that homemade 
ten-speed and pedal as far away as possible from high tech. A regular 
bicycle commuter, he goes on weekend jaunts and makes a five-hundred- 
to seven-hundred-mile tour every summer through New Zealand's spec- 
tacular bush, mountain, and lake scenery. 

"I wake up when the sun comes up, go to sleep when the sun goes 
down, and rely entirely on my own motive power." 

Mcintosh pauses, a broad grin crosses his face, and his eyes twinkle. 

"It's really primitive, and that's great." 3i

f yoy're serious about word processing on 
you/ Apple lie or Apple III, you should test the 
Word Juggler System from Quark. Integrated 
t^ls that combine ease of use with extra- 
rdinary power. 

WRITE IT 

WITH WORD JUGGLER. 



The anchor of the system is Quark's Word 
Juggler word processor, a program that lets 
you easily perform the most intricate editing 
tasks. For example, you can delete characters, 
words, even paragraphs with just a single key- 
stroke. You can instantly copy, move or delete 
entire blocks of text. Then display or print 
your document by simply pressing a key. 

And there's virtually nothing to memorize. 
Because editing and formatting commands 
are always right there on the keyboard. Word 
Juggler for the Apple III comes with special 
templates which identify principal word 
processing functions. On our version for the 
lie, the editing commands are labeled on 
easy-to-install, replacement keycaps. 

Plus, Word Juggler lets you generate 
form letters from existing mailing 
lists, because the program has 
a built-in interface with both 
PFS: File and Apple's 
Quick File. 




PROOF IT 

WITH LEXICHECK™ 

Once you've written your document, you can 
quickly proof it with Lexicheck — a high per- 
formance spelling checker with a 50,000-word 
dictionary. Simple and fast, Lexicheck is in- 
voked from within Word Juggler by a single 
keystroke. The program scans your document 
and highlights unrecognized words in context 
If the words are actually misspelled, you can 
quickly correct them. If words are merely un- 
known, as with jargon or abbreviations, you 
can add them easily to your own personal 



^ictionary. 



SEND IT 

WITH TERMINUS™ 

And with Quark's new Terminus communica- 
tions program, you can use Word Juggler for 
electronic mail applications. A single keystroke 
invokes the program from within the word 
processor, allowing you to communicate with 
most any RS232 device. You can predefine the 
protocols you need to communicate with as 
many as 14 different systems, at transmission

THE 






TH 



By Jim Merritt 



Jungle Fever, Part 11 



Before we begin this month's explorations, we'd first like to report a 
minor error in the last installment. Actually, it was a blatant falsehood. 
Your Pathfinder is not sure what he was thinking at the time. In the first 
paragraph of page 90, the form of the "resident" compiler directive was 
given as (*$R filename *). The proper form is (*$R identifier-or- 
segment-number *), as covered in September 1983. 

Toward a Rational 1984. When it comes to arithmetic calculation, 
digital computers have a reputation for being both fast and accurate. Fast 
they most certainly are: calculations that used to take hours or days to 
complete by hand are now performed in far less than a second by even 
the least capable of today's personal computers. Accuracy, however, is 
entirely another matter. For instance, most computers (including the Ap- 
ple running Pascal) will tell you that three times one-third is not equal to 
one! Instead, 3*(l/3) is equal to as many nines to the right of the decimal 
point as the system's design permits (.999999 for Apple Pascal). 

You're well aware that, expressed as a decimal number, the fraction 
1/3 becomes something like 0.333333. Of course, this is only an approx- 
imation to the actual value. On paper, we can put a bar above the string 
of threes (or an ellipsis after it) to indicate that this particular number is 
a "repeating decimal"— an infinite sequence of digits that represent the 
original fraction exactly. A computer, of course, has a limited amount of 
memory and so cannot possibly store an infinite, "repeating decimal." 
A number such as the decimal representation of 1/3 must therefore be 
"rounded" to fit into a storage space (a variable) that can hold at most 
only a relatively small cluster of digits at one time. 

Even fractions having finite decimal equivalents may be represented 
within a computer inaccurately if the exact decimal form includes more 
digits than can be accommodated by the machine's numeric format. For 
example, on a computer that can store only six digits per number, the 
fraction 49/128 would probably be represented as .382813, since its ex- 
act decimal form, .3828125, involves one too many digits. The inaccu- 
racy introduced by settling for such an approximation is known as round- 
off error. As you might imagine, this kind of error can be propagated and 
increased through long chains of arithmetical operations and can cause 
the final results obtained by a program to be very inaccurate. 

As a matter of course, conventional computer arithmetic involving 
fractional (that is. Real) numbers often suffers from the effects of ap- 
proximation and roundoff error. (Fortunately, the inaccuracies are 
usually so small that most people may ignore them.) On the other hand, 
we know from elementary school that a fraction may be expressed not 
only in decimal notation but also as the ratio of two integers. Since in- 
teger computer arithmetic is always exact, many a programmer— Your 
Pathfinder included— has been inspired to write software that represents 
a fractional value "naturally" and exacdy, as an integer ratio. 

The accompanying listing is the compiled source text for Rational, an 
INTRINSIC UNIT that performs rational number arithmetic and data 
conversion. 

Rational Revealed. Rational demonstrates how a UNIT, especially 



an INTRINSIC one, may be used to add an entirely new, custom-de- 
signed data type to your personal copy of Apple Pascal. Today's com- 
puter scientists agree that a complete data type definition must include 
descriptions of the abstract nature of the data in question; the physical 
representation of the data within the computer; the operators (if any) that 
may be used to manipulate the data; and the correspondence (if any) be- 
tween the data being defined and data of other types. 

In order to appreciate these points more fully, consider Apple 
Pascal's Integer data type. A formal definition of Integer would certainly 
mention the numeric nature of Integer data, as well as the fact that an In- 
teger value is stored in a "two's-complement" format that occupies two 
bytes (one word) of your Apple's RAM memory. Additionally, the type 
definition would list and describe several operators, such as -I- (addi- 
tion), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), DIV (truncating division), and 
MOD (the remainder when one Integer is divided by another). Finally, 
the Integer specification would mention the criteria for producing a char- 
acter-string representation of an Integer value, for building a Real value 
that corresponds to an Integer, and so forth. In other words, the type 
definition would identify other types of data with which Integers are 
compatible, then prescribe the methods or rationale that should be used 
in converting between Integer data and corresponding values from the 
other types. 

The UNIT Rational manages to satisfy the four criteria for a format 
data type definition. First, the numeric nature of rational data is clearly 
declared, at least in the UNIT'S commentary. Second, the physical form 
of a rational Number is defined as consisting of two (potentially huge) In- 
tegers. Next, operations are defined that invoke well-known arithmetic 
recipes to transform individual Numbers or to combine two Numbers 
into a third. Also included in the package is an operation for evaluating 
the equality or inequality of two Numbers. Finally, conversions between 
Numbers and character strings are defined in the form of special 
subroutines. 

Although Rational is successful in defining a new numeric data type 
for your Apple Pascal system, its design (and the compromises that led to 
the design) identify certain weaknesses of Apple Pascal— particularly as 
regards the UNIT mechanism. We will consider some of those shortcom- 
ings after examining the implementation of rational Numbers in detail. 

To Make a Short Story Long. ... As mentioned above, each ra- 
tional Number consists of two potentially large Integers. One is the nu- 
merator; the other is the denominator. Rational treats all numbers as 
fractions and manipulates them using much the same methods as you 
learned in elementary arithmetic class. (Some short cuts are taken here 
and there, but the methods should not be totally unfamiliar to you.) 

Assuming that you know nothing more about Apple Pascal than the 
material presented in this column over its three-year history, you are no 
doubt confused by the definition of the Ratint data type (which, in turn, 
is used to define the Numerator and Denominator fields in the Number 
strucmre). 

Ratint is a "Long Integer," as opposed to a regular one. The constant

in brackets, concatenated to the identifier Integer in the Ratint definition, 
specifies the desired maximum number of digits we want the Long In- 
teger to hold (up to 36). To illustrate, the type descriptor Integer[10] 
specifies a Long Integer that can hold a number that is at most ten digits 
wide. The number 12,345,678,901 would be too large to squeeze into a 
variable of that particular type, but it would fit snugly into a variable de- 
clared as Integer[l 1]. In specifying the size of a Ratint, we used a named 
constant between the brackets. The explicit Integer constant 16 would 
have served as well— from the compiler's point of view, at least. How- 
ever, several of Rational' s subroutines must also know the maximum 
number of digits in a Ratint, so it seemed best to give a specific name to 
that value. That way, if someday we want to extend (or restrict) the max- 
imum number of digits accommodated by a Ratint, we need only change 
the declaration of MaxRISize, then recompile the UNIT. 

Long Integers are only partially compatible with regular Integers. 
For instance, the built-in operators -I- , — , *, and DIV apply to values of 
both types, but MOD is undefined for Long Integers (which explains 
why Rational's IMPLEMENTATION section defines an explicit subrou- 
tine to handle that operation). Also, an Integer may be assigned to a Long 
Integer variable; conversion from regular Integers to Long Integers is 
automatic. On the other hand, conversion from Long Integer to Integer is 
possible only if the Long Integer value falls within the Integer range of 
—32,768 to 32,767. And such conversion is not automatic; you must in- 
voke it by calling the built-in Trunc function. To illustrate, if A is an In- 
teger variable and B is a Long Integer variable containing the value 273, 
then the statement "A : = Trunc(B);" puts the Integer value of 273 in A. 

At the level of the p-machine. Long Integers are represented differ- 
ently from standard Integers. Although both Integers and Long Integers 
are ultimately represented by patterns of bits (binary digits, on-off 
pulses) in the RAM memory of your Apple, the lengths of these patterns 
and the methods used to interpret them differ between the two data types, 
just as they do between Integer and Real. The exact nature of the differ- 
ence is irrelevant to this discussion, but if you're curious you'll find 
much helpful information in Chapter 2 of the Apple Pascal Language 
Reference Manual. If you're especially fearless, you might also study 
Appendix A of the Apple Pascal Operating System Reference Manual, 
which describes the architecture of the p-machine. 

Long Integer is an example of a "hybrid" data type: It has some of 
the advantages of a "fundamental" type (for instance. Long Integers 
may be operands for several— but not all— of the standard arithmetic 
operators), and some of the disadvantages of a "complex" type (for in- 
stance, programmer-defined functions may not return Long Integer 
values, except as VAR parameters). In its ambiguity, then, Long Integer 
is much like Apple Pascal's String type. Moreover, both Strings and 
Long Integers may be given arbitrary physical (maximum) sizes in their 
declarations. Just as one String variable may be able to hold more (or 
fewer) characters than another due to a difference in declared maximum 
size, so may one Long Integer variable be able to accommodate more (or 
fewer) digits than another. (Anyone interested in the evolution of the 
Pascal language should note that neither Strings nor Long Integers are 
defined in the proposed international Pascal standard, and they were 
never recognized by Niklaus Wirth's original Pascal compiler. Instead, 
they were added as extensions to the language by the programmers at the 
University of California, San Diego, who designed both UCSD Pascal 
and Apple Pascal.) 

And Now, the Bad News. Certain limitations of Pascal encumber the 
programmer who wishes to implement a new data type as a UNIT. To 
start, Pascal does not permit the programmer to modify any existing op- 
erators to accommodate a new data type. For instance, we would have 
liked to expand the scope of the -I- , — , *, and / operators to encompass 
Number (that is, rational) data. In more precise terms, we would have 
preferred to overload those operators. Since Pascal does not support such 
a thing, all arithmetic on Number data must instead be done through pro- 
cedures and functions. To tie our hands further, Pascal does not allow a 
function to return structured data as its value; in particular, no function 
may return a Number as defined by the Rational UNIT. Instead, results 
must be transmitted through the VAR parameter mechanism. For exam- 
ple, suppose that a client program wants to add two (different) rational 
numbers together, then multiply the result by itself. It would have to 
establish at least two Number variables; let's call them A and B. Next, a 
statement such as "IF NumAdd(A,B,A) = NumNoErr THEN (* Who 
cares? *);" would compute the sum of A and B, then deposit that result

in A (obliterating A's original contents). Finally, a statement such as "IF 
NumMul(A,A,A) = NumNoErr THEN (*Again, who cares? *);" would 
determine the square of A and place that value back into A. 

If we could coerce Pascal's "native" arithmetic operators to accept 
Number operands (never mind how that might be possible ! ) , we could use 
the much more understandable statements "A : = A + B;" and "A : = 
A * A" to accomplish our hypothetical ends. Or, if we could redefine 
NumAdd and NumMul as functions returning Number results, we could 
write "A : = NumAdd(A,B); A : = NumMul(A,A);". 

Taking Exception to Rational Misbehavior. Because we can nei- 
ther overload Pascal's built-in operators nor create functions that return 
Number values, we must resign ourselves to the fact that arithmetic— in- 
deed any rational-number manipulations— will be more cumbersome 
than the corresponding operations for Pascal's built-in numeric types. 
However, as the cliche says, "When life hands you a lemon, make lem- 
onade." Even as we grimace at Pascal's limitations, we can take advan- 
tage of them. For instance, in Rational, all operators are defined as func- 
tions that return not a Number but a condition code indicating the success 
or failure of the operation (and usually the reason for any failure, as 
well). This mechanism affords us a great deal of control over our pro- 
grams, insofar as it enables us to write code that deals intelligently with 
exceptional situations. 

Let's suppose you write a program to display the result of "A DIV 
B", where A and B are Integers. What happens if B is zero? In this 
case, you might want the program to display an error message and retire 
gracefully, but Pascal gives you no control over the situation. The p- 
machine issues its own "divide by zero" error message, then proceeds 
to abort your program! The Rational package does not exhibit such rude 
behavior. If A, B, and C are (rational) Numbers, A and B contain valid 
rational values, and OutString is a String variable, then the following 
code addresses both the normal and the abnormal possibilities of division 
in a highly readable fashion: 

CASE NumDiv(A, B, C) OF 
NumNoErr: 
BEGIN 
NumToStr(C, OutString); 
WriteLn(Output, 'Answer = ', OutString); 
END; 

NumOverflow: 

WriteLn(Output, 'ERROR: result undefined or too large'); 
END (* CASE *); 

Of course. Rational' s operators could have been defined as proce- 
dures that return their completion codes as VAR parameters, in the same 
way that the arithmetic results must be returned. Then, however, it 
would have been far too easy for a programmer to ignore the possible ill 
effects of an operation. By using functions to implement the operators, 
we have guaranteed that the process of using an operation forces us to 
consider (if not provide for) its possible consequences, both good and 
bad. In the opinion of Your Pathfinder, the use of such defensive pro- 
gramming techniques will help you produce programs of exceptionally 
high reliability and quality. You may not agree with this design philoso- 
phy. If so, you are free to modify Rational to suit your own beliefs. For 
instance, you might want to change all the operator functions into pro- 
cedures, where the condition code is returned as a VAR parameter. Or 
you may elect to dispense with the reporting of operational success or 
failure altogether. (But if you do so, don't ask Softalk—ox Your Path- 
finder—for help in taming the program, should it turn renegade!) 

Too Much Information: You Can't Police the Client. Another 
problem with the Rational UNIT is that too much information must be 
disclosed in the INTERFACE section regarding the physical representa- 
tion of rational data. In particular, the objects MaxRISize and Ratint are 
representational details that should, by rights, be hidden away in the 
IMPLEMENTATION section. Certainly, these definitions should never 
be needed or employed by client programs. Yet, since they're presented 
in the INTERFACE section, they are rendered "public," and so 
available for use by every client. 

The only data structure that a Rational client ever needs to use is the 
Number. Ideally, the INTERFACE should reveal only that Number ex- 
ists as a Pascal data type. We would like to leave specific implementation 
details where they belong— in the IMPLEMENTATION section. 

Such a data type as our ideal Number is called "opaque" by comput- 



er scientists for the simple reason that software that uses it cannot "see" 
the internal structure of the data. For instance, built-in types such as In- 
teger, Char, Boolean, and String are all "opaque" to you and your pro- 
grams. Unfortunately, Pascal does not permit die "opaquing" of custom 
data structures, so the entire RECORD strucmre of a Number must be 
exposed to public view. Because the subsidiary data type Ratint is used in 
defining Number, it must also appear in the INTERFACE section along 
with the constant MaxRISize. 

When construction details of complex data structures are made 
public, the overall reliability of the abstract data type and its operators 
can suffer greatly. This is because writers of client software tend to be- 
lieve that direct access to the "lower levels" of an abstract structure will 
help them to increase the speed or decrease the memory requirements of 
their own software. There is some justification for this belief, especially 
in the case of the Rational UNIT. For instance, consider the operator 
NumDiv. Rational division of Srcl by Src2 is nothing more than rational 
multiplication of Srcl by the reciprocal of Src2. Rational optimizes the 
speed of the NumDiv operator by constructing the reciprocal of Src2 
directly— no call to NumReciprocal is made, and so no time-consuming 
procedure call or parameter-passing overhead is incurred. 

Direct construction of Src2's reciprocal is possible only when the 
code in question has direct access to the Numerator and Denominator 
fields of a Number. Of course, the nature of the Number declaration en- 
sures that all Rational clients have the ability to access Numbers in this 
way. So long as client code is very careful in modifying Numerators and 
Denominators directly, program execution will proceed smoothly. But 
what might happen, for instance, if some poorly designed client code 
inadvertently managed to zero a Denominator? The "official" Rational 
operators have been written so as to keep denominators from becoming 
zero, but we should not assume that the same can always be said of 
client code. 

So that catastrophe may be avoided, client code should never have (or 
need) the implementation details of abstract data structures. Abstract 
data should always be manipulated in the abstract, using only the op- 
erators provided by the package that defines the data type. It is very 
unfortunate, then, that the creators of Apple Pascal, in designing the 
UNIT mechanism as an extension to the Pascal language, did not also 
provide for the definition of opaque data types. While the UNIT facility 
enables you to add custom extensions of your own design to Apple 
Pascal, the language's rules of data declaration often prevent you from 
implementing your extensions in a completely "safe" fashion. The best 
you can do — as we've done in Rational — is to make public as little "sen- 
sitive" information as possible and trust that your set of operators is suf- 
ficiently comprehensive and efficient so that client programmers will not 
be tempted to "cheat." 

The Next Rational Step. Our discussion of the Rational UNIT has so 
far been largely theoretical and abstract in nature. By now, you are no 
doubt eager to see and work with an actual client program that demon- 
strates the unit's capabilities and power. You will have a chance to do 
so— next month. While you are waiting, try mulling over these topics for 
advanced study: 

1 . We have not bothered to examine the algorithms used in writing 
Rational 's arithmetic operators and conversion subroutines. The purpose 
of this month's column was not to turn you into an expert at numeric pro- 
gramming methods. Our development of rational numbers as a data type 
served only to demonstrate how UNITs may be used to implement entire 
custom data types from scratch. 

Your Pathfinder claims no great expertise in the subject of numerics; 
he dared to write Rational only after consulting the "programmer's bi- 
ble," D.E. Knuth's three- volume survey of programming lore entitled 
The Art of Computer Programming (Addison- Wesley, publishers), 
which is available at most technical bookstores and many computer retail 
stores. The second volume, "Seminumerical Algorithms," is an indis- 
p>ensable (albeit somewhat dry) handbook for programmers who are nu- 
merically inclined. Chapter four deals with computer arithmetic, and 
section five of that chapter is devoted specifically to rational numbers. In 
addition, Knuth himself cites several references that you may find help- 
ful, should you develop more than a passing interest in the manipulation 
of numbers by computer. 

Euclid's algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor, used in 
the Rational subroutine RatGCD, is reasonably quick. It is not, however, 
the fastest known CCD algorithm, only the most famous. In a thorough 



treatment, Knuth compares Euclid's algorithm with the so-called 
"binary" GCD method and concludes that the latter is significantly 
faster. You might try reading Knuth, then rewriting RatGCD to incor- 
porate the "binary" algorithm. If you do, you should also write a small 
test client for Rational, one that permits you to determine whether or not 
(and if so, by how much) the change in RatGCD actually increases the 
unit's overall execution speed. For example, the client could include 
two loops of a thousand iterations each. The body of one might perform 
a rational addition, through NumAdd, while that of the other could 
multiply two rational Numbers, using NumMul. Clocking the execution 
times of each loop for each version of Rational should give you the data 
you need to render a verdict in the case of Euclid versus the "binary" 
method. 

2. Many possible operations and data conversions were omitted from 
the Rational package. Rational is nothing more than a minimal toolkit, 
from which much interesting software can be built. While it is a good 
working definition of the Number type, it is by no means a very compre- 
hensive one. You might want to extend the UNIT so that it supports, for 
instance, trigonometric operations or conversion between Numbers 
and Reals. 

3. We mentioned earlier that Rational 's implementation of the 
arithmetic operators permits you to exercise a large amount of control 
over problem situations. However, Rational is unprepared to deal 
with two difficulties that may easily arise during rational-number 
computations. 

First, a numeric result may grow too large to be represented by the 
rational mechanism. In plain terms, more than sixteen digits may be re- 
quired to express the numerator. This situation is called overflow. (Note 
that Rational treats a zero denominator as a special case of overflow.) 

A related problem, underflow, occurs when the result of a rational 
computation is too small — in other words, when more than sixteen digits 
are required for the denominator. 

The code that implements rational operators and data conversions 
recognizes and deals with zero denominators but not with the more gen- 
eral problems of overflow or underflow, even though NumCC error 
codes are provided for them. These omissions are deliberate. While it is 
possible for Rational to recognize overflow or underflow immediately 
before it would occur during an arithmetic operation, doing so would 
tend to slow computation and would also force an increase in the size of 
the arithmetic subroutines. Nevertheless, the ambitious reader is invited 
to rewrite Rational so that it addresses the underflow and overflow prob- 
lems in an appropriate fashion. You should be able to do the job without 
changing Rational 's INTERFACE in any way. Good luck.

FORMS FOUNDRY™ And Your Apple Can Turn 
The Universal Form' Into 



The Universal Form' 

Using FORMS FOUNDRYjm . the blank Universal Form 
or even plain computer paper becomes a custom form 
— tailor made to suit your requirements — it can 
become any of the following: 



Invoice 

Purchase Order 
Debit Memo 
Credit Memo 
Packing List 



Dues Notice 
Sales Memo 
Sales Order 
Confirmation 
Acknowledgement 



• Statement 

• Club Statement 

• Proposal 

• Quotation 



• No need to set-up report fields. 

• Forms FoundryjM is ready to go to work upon 
delivery. 

• Menu controlled. 

• No programming knowledge required. 

• No complicated data base. 

Just fill in information as requested, Forms Foundryj^ 
does the rest. Forms Foundry can even use blank paper 
to print custom forms. 

In addition to reducing form expenses, it has drastically 
reduced the time spent processing separate forms 
through: 

1. The utilization of the Apple's ability to process 
text, eliminating time spent correcting errors with 
correction tapes and fluids.

CONTEST 

WINNERS: An Apple AwarxJed; 
A Irickster Treated 



Continued from page 10 

(colt, one point), he missed the winning time by 
I'/s seconds (minus six points). He made up for 
it by predicting the winning jockey (Eddie Dela- 
houssaye, fifteen bonus points). The running to- 
tal: fifty-four points. 

On July 4, 1983, the temperamre in San Jose 
topped off at ninety degrees Fahrenheit. Shan- 
berg predicted that it would be seventy-seven, 
subtracting thirteen points from his score. 
Though devastated, he was still in the running 
with forty-one points. 

Shanberg bounced back by scoring fifty 
points when he predicted five of the seven peo- 
ple who had officially announced their can- 
didacy for the 1984 presidential election. He 
also predicted one who had not announced his 
candidacy, subtracting five from the total. Run- 
ning score: eighty-six points. 

Finally, Shanberg named four of the five 
companies that had products appear most fre- 
quently on Softalk's Top Thirty during 1983. 
With each company worth five points, Shanberg 
added twenty points to his score, giving him a 
winning total of one hundred six. 

It was a close race, though, with no undis- 
puted winner decided until after the last part of 
the contest. David Miles (Gillette, WY) had 
seventy-four points going into the final round. 
Miles predicted four of the five companies to 
make the most Top Thirty appearances, for 
twenty points. If Miles had also predicted cor- 
rectly the number of appearances by the top 
company, he would have added twenty bonus 
points, giving him a total of one hundred four- 
teen. As it turned out. Miles finished second, 
with ninety-four points. 

But Wait, There's More. Miles could have 
used a little help from anyone who predicted the 
number of appearances by the top company. 
One such person is Teresa Parmenter (Napa, 
CA), the winner of the final part of the Oracle 
contest. 

Parmenter listed VisiCorp, Apple Com- 
puter, Broderbund, Sierra On-Line, and Info- 
com as her predictions for the five top compa- 
nies. VisiCorp was the only company on her list 
not to make the top five. Getting four correct 
gave her twenty points; predicting the number 
of appearances (forty-two by Apple) then added 
twenty bonus points, giving Parmenter a total of 
forty points. 

A small handful Oess than 2 percent) of con- 
testants tied, each with a score of forty points; 
the random number generator picked Parmenter 
from this group. 

For those who are curious, the companies 
whose products appeared most frequently in the 
Top Thirty were, in order: Apple (forty-two), 
Broderbund (thirty-one). Software Publishing 



(twenty-seven), Sierra On-Line (twenty-four), 
and Infocom (twenty-two). Just missing the cut- 
off were Beagle Bros and Sir-tech, each with 
twenty -one. 

In last year's contest, it was BPI General 
Ledger that boosted Apple to the number-one 
spot. This year, Apple Writer lie and the debut 
of the Children's Television Workshop pro- 
grams {Ernie's Quiz, Instant Zoo, Mix and 
Match, and so on) put even more distance be- 
tween Apple and the rest of the field. 

Almost all contestants thought VisiCorp 
would again be one of the top five, but with al- 
most nothing but VisiCalc in the charts each 
month, the company scored a meager thirteen 
appearances. 

Taking a lot of people by surprise was Info- 
com, which appeared twice almost every 
month. Beagle Bros, which just missed tying 
with Infocom, made all but one of its bestseller 
appearances during the last six months of the 
year. 

Tricky Treats. Yes, it was indeed a tricky 
way to get people to read the magazine thor- 
oughly, and no, the contest wasn't developed by 
the American Ophthalmological Association to 
cause readers to develop glaucoma and go trot- 
ting off to their nearest ophthalmologist. 

From the look of things, participants in the 
October Tricker Treat contest paged through 
the magazine, searching for items on the list un- 
til their eyes gave out or until they went insane, 
whichever came first (for some, both occurred 
at the same time). 

Is risking one's eyesight and mental health 
worth winning two hundred lousy bucks in Ap- 
ple accessories? Apparently so. It was especial- 
ly worth it for James Daniels (Huntsville, AL), 
who won the contest by turning in a perfect en- 
try. Daniels found all the treats and identified 
all the tricks. As a reward, he'll get to spend all 
two hundred of those lousy bucks at AC 3 Com- 
puter Products in his hometown of Huntsville. 

The treats are listed, along with their loca- 
tions, at the end of this section. 

As usual in these contests, many readers 
raised questions on technicalities in some of the 
rules. The most popular one was the rule stating 
that "items must be found exactly as they ap- 
pear here. For example, safe deposit box cannot 
be extracted from safe deposit boxers.'" 

Some nit-picky contestants took that to mean 
that if words weren't capitalized on the list, they 
couldn't be capitalized in places where they 
were found. That's really stretching things. 

Lookit. The example we gave means you 
can't extract just part of a word and say that you 
found the word we had listed. You can't find 
Applesoft and say you found Apple. They're not 
the same thing. 



However, finding $35,000.00 is equivalent 
to saying you found $35,000. With or without 
the extra zeros on the end, it still equals thirty 
five thousand dollars. If you don't believe us, 
pronounce $35,000.00 and $35,000 out loud 
and see if they sound any different. No? Good. 
But just to satisfy those who will squawk until 
their dying days, we accepted this one as a trick 
or as a treat. Most people who thought it was a 
trick mentioned that they did find $35,000.00 
on page 38, but ruled it as a trick because of the 
two zeros to the right of the decimal. 

Another problem arose in finding treat num- 
ber four, Mexico. It was possible to find New 
Mexico several places in the magazine, and 
some contestants thought that was sufficient. 
But actually, that's not the same thing as finding 
Mexico. In Basic: 

10 LET M$= "Mexico" 

20 LET NM$= "New Mexico" 

30 IF M$ = NM$THEN YOU WIN : END 

40 YOU LOSE. 

Nope. Mexico is a country, and New Mexico is 
a state. But because of the way treats sixteen 
and twenty-eight (Wall Street Jo and ink pearl) 
were found, we decided to let this one slide, 
too. If you found New Mexico, that counts. 

The Quotebook. It does look like these con- 
tests are getting out of hand. To wit: 

' 'Once I started looking for treats, I couldn't 
stop. Addicting behavior! At least now I can go 
back to making dinners (instead of ordering out) 
and check to make sure I still recognize my 
kids." Candy Karlin (Skokie, IL). 

"There, finished. What year is it?" Larry 
King (Lincoln, NE). 

"I got hooked! I couldn't stop hunting for 
the treats. My house is a mess, the laundry 
needs to be done, and the dog needs to be fed. 
Even if I don't win, I'll come out ahead. In 
hunting for treats I read Softalk four times and 
increased my knowledge and understanding of 
computers. That in and of itself is my reward." 
Toni Kastelic (Descanso, CA). 

Three hundred twenty pages is a lot for 
anybody. Gary Kielar (Clinton, NY) offered his 
solution: "A Halloween party! Each of the 162 
guests started with a beer and a page of the Oc- 
tober Softalk (each had to do both sides of the 
page) and had to find a clue before the next 
brew was issued. Well, most needed a little 
more inspiration themselves. But the party and 
contest were successful, as the attached list 
proves. The $200 prize can be sent directly to 
my local distributor for the fifty cases consumed 
and advanced on my next party. All 162 guests 
are eagerly awaiting the next issue of Softalk." 
Kielar was last seen ordering 162 turkeys for

the November contest. 

The Tear-jerker of the Month award goes to 
Julie Ann Benusa (Rice, MN) for her outstand- 
ing performance in One Bribe for One Brother. 
I'm sure that I should win. You see, I'm only 
1 fifteen, and I'm doing this for my brother. He's 
j studying computer engineering at college and 
he's broke. Therefore, he could really use some 
extra junk for his Apple II computer. I'm sure it 
could be arranged to pay off somebody." 

As stated in the rules, "The entry with the 
scariest appearance will receive special consid- 
eration." Thanks for all the neat-o and keen 
drawings of skeletons, hobgoblins, witches, 
ghosts, IRS agents, tombstones, zombies, 
bloody axes, and dentists; they were nice and 
scary. Especially the envelopes! 

But by far the scariest entry came from 
Paula Giese (Minneapolis, MN) who disguised 
her entry as a summons and complaint for a 
class-action civil lawsuit (at least, we hope it 
was only a disguise) seeking $50 million in 
damages. Just seeing the return address on 
Giese 's entry (Paralegal Investigations) was 
scary enough for the contest staff, since most of 
them were already running from the law for 
various reasons. Fortunately, the accompanying 
papers and supporting documents were so full 
of legal jargon and words with more than two 
syllables that the staff couldn't understand most 
of what Giese was trying to say. 

And now, the answers to the Tricker Treat 
contest: 

1 . Olympic rings. Page 73, lower right side 
under the stars. 

2. Lloyd's of London. Page 278, second 
column, fifth line. 

3. the New Mutants. Trick! This is the title 
of a Marvel Comics book. It ain't here. 

4. Mexico. In the form of New Mexico, this 
appeared many places; page 115 in the address 
for Excalibur Technologies is just one such 
place. Mexico can be found on page 166, second 
column, six lines from the bottom, "since we 
invaded Mexico." People with good eyes found 
it in the Epson ad on page 256. It's half hidden, 
but you can see it through the clouds, near the 
center of the photo. 

5. Old Maid. Trick! The biggest trick of all 
was on us. Old Maid appeared in Sirius's Gruds 
in Space ad on page 93 of the September issue, 
but Sirius decided not to run the ad again. No, 
the girl pictured on page 217 is not an old maid 
just because she isn't wearing a wedding ring. 

6. 0274-9629. Page 4, fine print under the 
subhead of Softalk. "All rights reserved. 
ISSN:0274-9629." This obscure number can 
also be found on the brown paper wrapper the 
magazine comes in through the mail. 

7. seaweed. Page 69, second column, first 
line, "Seaweed Sandwich." 

8. some Energizer batteries. Page 279, in 
the Prometheus ad. The longest interface card 
has two Energizers plugged into it. 

9. jack-o-lantem. Page 183, screen shot at 
bottom center of the page, next to the shovel. 
The one on page 4 doesn't count, and the rules 
said so ("Sorry, finding them in the contest sec- 
tion of the magazine doesn't count . . ."). 

10. catowlroo. Page 83, top. Package for 
Jeepers Creatures has a picture and label of a 
catowlroo. 



1 1 . halo. Page 1 15. Two of them; one over 
the head of the man on the right and one over 
the word Savvy at the bottom of the page. 

12. Taxan RGB monitor. Page 191, bottom 
of the page, sitting on top of the Apple. Many 
people missed this one. 

13. manhole cover. Page 239, on the pack- 
age's illustration, right under Arnold the dog 
catcher's foot. 

14. sleeping giant. Page 198, bottom half of 
the page. The first line reads, "... will 
awaken the sleeping giant in your computer." 

15. LisaCalc. Okay, this was tricky. Page 
242, under the heading of Important De- 
velopments, "(Apple's) Lisa is based on a new 
software technology that integrates common of- 
fice functions, such as spreadsheet analysis." 
That's an indirect reference to LisaCalc. A 
popular, but incorrect, choice was on page 
281: ". . . the power of Lisa. Calc-Connector 
passes data. ..." Sorry, we asked for an item, 
not one word and part of another. 

16. Wall Street Jo. Page 107, bottom right 
corner of the picture of the SoftCard. The 
"chip" labeled U 17 has the title of the Wall 
Street Journal, but it's cut off after the o in 
Journal. 

17. neon signs. Page 220, third column. 
The first subhead reads: "Neon Signs, Flashy 
Lights. ..." 

18. covered wagon. This one appeared in 
several places. The Calsoft ad on page 285 is 
one place; the description of Jenny of the Prai- 
rie in the ad on page 175 ("separated from her 
covered wagon train . . .") is another. 

19. safe deposit box. Page 187, first sub- 
head, "A Safe Deposit Box To Keep Your 
Values In." 

20. Tupperware. Page 35. The ad on this 
page has a drawing of some Tupperware. If 
that's not convincing enough, then the word 
Tupperware appears at the top of the ad. 

21. albatross. Trick! And no one can con- 
vince us beyond a shadow of a doubt that those 
are albatrosses in the paintings in the Excalibur 
Technologies ad on page 115. 

22. pizza. Page 130, top of the page in the 
ad for The Pizza Program. 

23. videocassette. Several of these were 
strewn about. Page 45, the Kennen Publishing 
ad is one instance ("full color videocassette"). 

24. roulette wheel. Trick, trick, trick! The 
word roulette appears all over, but no roulette 
wheels. That is not a roulette wheel in the ad on 
page 286; that's a wheel of fortune. If it were 
used for roulette, the ball would fall off. 

25. collie. Page 230, at the bottom of the ad 
on the left-hand side for MicroManagement. 
There's a picture of a collie, labeled "Man's 
Best Friend." 

26. children's carrousel. Page 77. The 
Dynacomp ad lists Children 's Carrousel as one 
of its programs. 

27. color slides. Page 46, bottom left-hand 
side. The ad says "color slides from your Ap- 
ple." 

28. ink pearl. Page 77, left-hand side, top. 
There's a picture of an eraser on which the P in 
Pink Pearl is cut off. 

29. internal combustion engine. Page 96. 
The screen shot at the bottom left of the page is 
labeled "internal combustion engine." 



30. Duran Duran. Trick. Hot new rock 
group but has nothing to do with Softalk. 

31. bandstand. Page 185. That's what the 
band in the picture is sitting on. 

32. golf tee. Page 245. You can't miss it. 
Keep your eye on the ball. 

33. three trombones. Page 265. In the 
picture, there are five musicians, two trumpets, 
and three trombones. 

34. not Wilma or Pebble, but Fred. Page 
137, second column, fourth paragraph, second 
line, "Hello, Mr. Flintstone. ..." 

35. spitballs. Page 185, second column, 
fourth line, reads: "I will not shoot spitballs in 
class. ..." 

36. taxicab. Page 116. Look carefully 
behind the K in Backtalk at the top of the page. 
See the little New York taxicab? 

37. popcorn. Page 314, under description 
for Spare Change, seventh line, ". . .try pop- 
ping popcorn. ..." 

38. periscope. Page 217, first column, 
seventeenth line from bottom (second subhead), 
"Up Periscope." 

39. family roots. Page 13, bottom right- 
hand side. The program advertised is called 
Family Roots. 

40. Madagascar. Page 33, in the photo of 
Earth, just to the east of Africa, where it always 
has been. 

41. pina coladas. Page 241, first column, 
seventh paragraph, third line, "we'd all be in- 
haling Pina Coladas by now." 

42. flimsies. Page 251, ninth paragraph, 
first line, "The bulletins, called 'flimsies.' " 
Flimsies did not refer to what Chyrl was 
wearing on page 23 1 . 

43. Horsehead. Yes, that should have been 
horse head, but who's counting? Heads of 
horses could be found all over the place. The 
head on the package of Sargon HI on page 215 
is just one of many. 

44. warped tennis racquet. Page 67, in the 
picture, between Mark Simonsen's and Jack 
Cassidy's heads, mounted on the wall is the 
racquet that Bert Kersey used when he was 
captain of the water tennis team in college. 

45. a doctor and a bird. Tricky but not a 
trick. Page 224, third column, second to last 
news item, "basketball stars 'Dr. J.' (Julius) 
Erving and Larry Bird. ..." 

46. vizual terms. Page 126, bottom printer. 
The paper in the printer has a line that says 
". . . recognising patterns and thinking in 
vizual terms." Eyes beginning to hurt? 

47. Alaska. Page 213, the Beagle Bros ad 
has a coupon at the bottom that lists the tele- 
phone number for "Alaska/Hawaii." Special 
InvisiPrizes go to those who spotted Alaska in 
the picture of Earth in the Softalk logo on the 
cover of the magazine. Get out the Visine. 

48. you-know-who. Pages 213 and 275, top 
left corner. Directly under the cartoon speech 
balloon, it says "Apple is a Registered Trade 
Mark of You-Know-Who." 

49. crystal diode. Page 110, the ad for 
HOME'S Repeaterrrr. Pictured is the product, 
which has components labeled Dl and D2. 
Those are both crystal diodes.

CUT TAXES • CONTROL EXPENSES • SAVE ON ACCOUNTING 




PLAIN VANILLA 



Our checkbook program is 
plain vanilla. ..no complex set-ups, 
no intricate budgets, 
and no monthly closings. 



CHECKBOOK FINANCIAL SYSTEM 

For Apple® II, II + , lie, III emulation, and Apple look-alikes - ASK DOS 3.3 

How It works On your computer screen, you 
create a facsimile of your checkbook. You see 17 
items per screen and can scroll for more. As the 
computer balances your checking account, you give 
each check or deposit its own category code. You 
get 100 you name'em codes. Press Ctrl-0 and see a 
code dictionary. To set up codes, just type them in. 
You can add, delete, or change codes any time 
without affecting data. 



At first people laughed. "Are you kidding? A ninty- 
nine dollar checkbook program?" 

It's true. Money Street isn't cheap, in fact it's one of 
the more costly checkbook programs. But with 
software as with everything else, you get what you 
pay for. 

Money Street gives you ease of learning. You'll 
have it up and running in thirty minutes, or your 
money back. 

Money Street gives you speed. Examples: Three 
seconds from main menu to any sub-section. Eleven 
seconds from boot to data entry. Twenty seconds 
from boot to print. 

Money Street saves you accounting fees, bank 
charges, and income taxes. Mike Salesin of West 
Bloomfield, Ml wrote: "When next year's tax 
season rolls around, my CPA will send love and 
kisses."

Money Street's most amazing feature 

is its "real time" data bank. It accumulates year-to- 
date totals for each of the 100 categories. You see 
these totals instantly. Just enter a check, and look 
at the bottom of the screen. The year-to-date total 
will flash into view with each new entry. 

Pays for itself. Money Street keeps things 
simple and keeps them honest. It can pay for itself 
ten times over just by saving the cost of organizing 
and totaling data. As one customer put it: "Why 
pay my $10G-an-hour CPA to count beans?" 

iVIoney Street... It's totally new. 

If you own real estate, Money Street tracks rents, 
tallies repair costs, and helps establish "cost basis" 
for capital gain tax treatment. It's also ideal for trust ; 
accounting, retail stores, and home budgeting.

Mind Your 




By PETER OLIVIERI 




Well, Happy New Year— and welcome to 1984. 

According to Orwell's book, this particular year was to have been the 
one that ushered in a much less private society. And there are those who 
speculate that the computer is the beginning of a technological revolution 
that may, indeed, affect us all in ways that will make certain aspects of 
1984 a reality. While it's true that computers in the hands of people who 
lack integrity can be used to do harm, the vast majority of computer 
users are people with integrity, as well as commitment and accountabil- 
ity. These people should more than counterbalance the minority. Good 
shall, indeed, triumph over evil. 

Enough philosophizing— let's make a start on the new year. 

Be It Resolved. Once a year in this column, we mention the useful- 
ness of making New Year's resolutions. Making resolutions for our- 
selves can be a way of reflecting on what was in an effort to influence 
what will be. It's also a custom for us to make resolutions for others. Of 
course, it's their responsibility to live up to these recommendations. 

Here, then, are a few suggestions for things it would be nice to see: 

1. Be it resolved: Apple will announce a complete business system 
(hardware, software, hard disk, printer, and so on) that is truly a "one- 
stop shopping center" for business users. 

2. Be it resolved: When such a system is announced (if it doesn't ex- 
ist already), an easy means for current Apple system owners to migrate 
upward to this new machine wUl be provided. 

3. Be it resolved: Software publishers will develop integrated 
packages that really are integrated. 

4. Be it resolved: Software reviewers will say bad things about prod- 
ucts that bad things should be said about. 

5. Be it resolved: When floppy disks are phased out, they will be re- 
placed by something that offers greater storage capacity than a floppy 
disk system, provides for easy backup, costs about the same, and is easy 
to use. 

Touching Base with Databases. Last month we discussed the factors 
that should be taken into account when attempting to choose a database 
management system. This month we'll begin to look at specific pack- 
ages, summarizing the features of several and then looking at how they 
compare to each other. 

Before getting started, let's briefly summarize the conclusions we 
reached last time. 

Before buying a database management system, it's essential to do 



some homework. Basically, this means deciding what reports you want 
and need, determining which data items are necessary for these reports, 
and figuring out how much data you need to be able to store. 

When evaluating a system, it's wise to look for ease of data input, file 
size limitations, types of printed reports allowed, data sorting capability, 
data retrieval speed, and mathematical manipulation capability, ft's also 
important to consider the possibility of multiple users, the quality of the 
documentation, possible compatibility with mainframe systems, and pro- 
gram and data backup provisions. 

Some Candidates. There are lots of database management packages 
available. Our objective here is to present information that will make it 
easier to narrow the field. With that in mind, we'll note the various 
characteristics associated with the packages we consider and offer some 
comments that reflect the experience various users have had with specific 
packages. Then it will be up to you to try out the systems that sound 
promising and evaluate them according to your own criteria. 

The programs we'll definitely include in this survey are Datafax, The 
Data Bank, Data Factory, Data Manager III, dBase II, DB Master, 
General Manager, PFS:File (Apple II and Apple III versions), Quick 
File III, Savvy, VersaForm II and ///, and VisiFile. This list is certainly 
not exhaustive, so if you feel that a particular product deserves mention, 
by all means say so. 

The Numbers Game. One of the points emphasized last time was the 
importance of determining how large you expect your database to be. 
This forces you to consider record size and field size as well. Your 
choices may be narrowed down automatically once you've established 
these parameters. For example, if you need a hard disk, several of the 
leading packages will no longer be candidates. Scanning the tabular in- 
formation that follows may give you a better idea of the packages you 
will want to consider. 

Noting the numerical characteristics of the various packages sets the 
stage for the continuation of this discussion next month. Of course, in 
many ways these database management systems are quite different from 
each other. They work on different principles and have been designed 
with different sorts of clients in mind. Next time we'll describe who the 
so-called "typical" users of various packages might be. We'll also talk 
about the equipment each system requires, evaluate the quality of the 
user guides and other documentation, and mention some of the extras 
that particular packages offer.

The Apple universe is big and getting bigger. This is sometimes referred to as the "big bang" theory of microcreation, a belief 
shared by many leading sociologists, anthropologists, and security analysts. One of the interesting side effects of this information 
explosion Is a sense of alienation brought about by the sheer enormity of this brave new world— a condition considered potentially 
hazardous to your equanimity if not compensated for by some interface with other carbon-based beings and their silicon buddies. 

That's why we're here. We're Softdisk, the interactive magazette. 

Every month, two information-crammed, double-sided disks are hand delivered to the mailboxes of our subscribes by uniformed 
government officials, and every month we learn a little more about ourselves and each other. We feature all sorts of unprotected, 
easily listed games, tutorials, and utilities, and starting this month we will be publishing the current month's program listings 
from Softalk magazine, already keyed in and ready to run, as well as interactive demos of some of the latest commercial software- 
allowing the readers to peruse the most recent techno-goodies from the comfort of their own computers. Best of all, there is a 
subscriber-accessible bulletin board that serves as a forum for debates, commentary, questions, and controversy. 

All this and more for $55 a year or $10 for a single issue. You keep one disk and return the other after copying it. We pay 
the postage and furnish a mailer. What's more, you become part of the action when you send us comments and programs on 
the disk you return. 

So subscribe now. It'll do you a universe of good. 

Softdisk requires Applesoft and DOS 3.3. It is also accessible by residents of Canada.

Of Interest to Bugs. A lot of Apple users, particularly business 
users, are finding that the companies they work for have decided to "go 
IBM." This development presents Apple owners who have been work- 
ing on their own for a while with a compatibility problem. 

No doubt there will soon be software and/or hardware that will help 
users of different brands of micros to transfer programs, applications, 
and data back and forth. One such device is Quadlink, developed by 
Quadram Corporation (Norcross, GA). 

Quadlink is a board that makes the IBM think it's an Apple, at least 
as far as most software is concerned. Not all Apple features are 
available, and there is some Apple-compatible hardware that can't be 
connected to an IBM equipped with a Quadlink. Nonetheless, Quadlink 
can be a very useful product for those who have access to two different 
machines. 

That's Incredible. The Incredible Jack, from Business Solutions 
(Kings Park, NY), is an integrated software package for the II Plus and 
He. It brings together word processing, database storage, and spread- 
sheet capability in one package. The developers of the package have re- 
cently released a companion product, Jackreport. This report generator 
allows users who already own The Incredible Jack to develop reports, 
complete with titles and pagination. Jackreport also provides data sorting 
and totaling capabilities. 

Keyboard Blues. If you read this column regularly, you probably re- 
member a couple of times in the last year when space was devoted to 
complaining about the keyboard. Truly, the keyboard is a problem, espe- 
cially when you're using software packages that require various series of 
keystrokes in order to execute commands. Suggested improvements, 
some of which have ended up as actual products, have included custom- 
ized labels for the keys, plug-in keyboards, help cards, and more. But 
let's talk about an improvement that wasn't suggested here. 

The product is the Kleertex keyboard templates from Creative Com- 
puter Products (San Diego, CA). These color-coordinated, heavy -gauge 
plastic keyboard templates measure approximately nine inches by four- 
teen inches and have a cutout in the middle so that they fit over your ac- 
tual keyboard. There are quite a few different templates available; 
among these are templates for use with such programs as WordStar, Ap- 
ple Writer, VisiCalc, dBase II, and Quick File. Once placed over your 
keyboard, they provide an instant reference guide to the keystroke com- 
mand sequences of your program, as well as a great learning tool for the 
first-time user. 

The Kleertex templates offer a reasonably priced and unusually effec- 
tive means of jogging one's memory about the commands associated 
with a particular package. And if there isn't a template that fits your 
needs, you can buy a "blank" to fill in yourself. 

B.U.G.s Suggest Solutions. It seems that whenever a Business User 
Group member sends out a call for help, two or three other members re- 
spond. A tip of the hat to Anita Hope (Fort Worth, TX) and Jerome Levy 
(Dresher, PA). Both have sent in particularly useful solutions to the 
word processor/printer problems that Evans Harrell (Marietta, GA) has 
been having. 

As those of you who read the October column know, Harrell 's prob- 
lems arose when he was using a Microline printer with SuperText 40/80 
and an Okidata-92 with Apple Writer II. Hope's solution to Harrell 's first 
problem involves taking advantage of the user options defined when the 
system loads. Here are the specifics that Hope provided: 

1. The printer setup should be: 
Control-I = 89, B2, B4, BO, CE, 8D 

(This allows for dual-pass printing and more than forty columns.) 

Control-Y = 99, 9B, C9, 9B, C4, 9B, BO 

(9B, C9 stops emphasized; 9B, C4 stops underline; 9B, BO stops 

correspondence.) 

2. To underline a word, use: 
Control-D = 84, 9B, C3 

3. To achieve vertical emphasis, use: 
Control-E = 85, 9B, C8 

4. To obtain correspondence quality, use: 
Control-G = 87, 9B, Bl 

5. To cancel seventeen characters per inch and return to ten charac- 
ters per inch, use: 

Control-K = IE 

6. To get double width: 

Set underline to IE and use control-W in Add mode 



7. To get seventeen characters per inch: 
Set backspaces to IC and use control-Z 
Note: Most of these control characters must be in a format line or they 
will accidentally print. 

Levy addresses the OkiddXal Apple Writer II problem. He suggests 
that the best way to embed line width or similar commands in text is by 
using the procedures described in the Embedding Printer Commands 
section of the Apple Writer II manual . 

The problem Harrell has been having is related to the fact that this 
printer responds to commands different from those listed in the Apple 
Writer manual. For example, the proper command to start an underline is 
escape-C, and the proper stop command is escape-D. Both of these com- 
mands can be embedded using the control-V technique, but this method 
is cumbersome at best. The problem is best solved by using the glossary 
feature, but unfortunately not all the command characters that the 
Okidata-92 needs are available from Apple Writer II with an Apple II 
Plus keyboard. 

Levy would like to share an Applesoft program he has written that's 
designed to generate a glossary file as an aid to using the Okidata printer. 
When run, this program creates a DOS text file named Special2 that may 
be loaded in response to the control-Q option 5 (glossary file) prompt. 

Here is the program: 

10 D$ = CHR$(4) : REM CONTROL-D 
20 PRINT D$;"OPEN SPECIAL2" 

30 PRINT D$;"DELETE SPECIAL2": REM CLEARS EARLIER 

VERSION 
40 PRINT D$;"OPEN SPECIAL2" 
50 PRINT D$;"WRITE SPECIAL2" 
60 ONERR GOTO 100 
70 READ A 
80 PRINT CHR$(A) 
90 GOTO 70 

100 PRINT D$;"CLOSE SPECIAL2" 

110 PRINT "SPECIAL2 GLOSSARY FILE CREATED"

Also try control B, E, F, G, J, K, and Q and see what your printer dis- 
plays. Doing so will demonstrate just how flexible this program is. 

B.U.G. Request #1. Graphics packages are becoming more and 
more popular with business users. The ability to display complex tables 
and numbers in picture form significantly enhances the quality of a pres- 
entation. We'll be discussing graphics packages later this year, but in 
the meantime, Thomas Martin (Hershey, PA) has a question. Does any- 
one know of a Pascal program or package that will work with Apple 
Computer's Business Graphics to dump the hi-res screen to the printer? 

Two possible sources come to mind, namely Business and Profes- 
sional Software (Cambridge, MA), the company that developed Apple's 
program, and Computer Solutions (Mansfield, Australia). Two prod- 
ucts from BPS, which at one time were called Target Image Maker 
and Printer/Platter Interface Kit (PIK), might do the trick. So might a 
Computer Solutions product developed in 1981 that allows the user to 
dump the hi-res screen(s) to the printer. To make this happen, you have 
to get your picture to the screen, load the program, and then select print- 
ing options from a menu. It's a bit unwieldy, but it works. If any of you 
B.U.G.s have more recent information, be sure to send it in. 

B.U.G. Request #2. Alan Krauss is still searching for an Applesoft 
program that will do PERT-type charting for planning and control. Or 
perhaps there's one available in CP/M? If you have an idea about where 
to get a PERT-charting program, do let us know. 

Farewell. And so we reach the end of another column. Here's hoping 
that while reading this, you've been curled up in front of a nice warm fire 
and sipping some hot cider. Take care, and see you in February.

Softalk Articl^lmdi^ 





COhPiLED By BETsy mm 

Can you believe that Softalk has mentioned 
Applesoft 1,322,896 times? And DOS, 991,642 
times? That even the elusive Crop Duster has 
had 257 mentions? A bunch of hooey, you say? 
Yup. But that 's what it seems like when you 're 
trying to index the darn thing by subject. So 
we 're still working on it. Eventually (maybe 
even sooner), we 'II offer one of our eight-buck- 
bombshell disks with a superindex where you 
can type in ' 'Applesoft ' ' and get referred to 
every single discussion of that language by issue 
and page number, or you can type in ' 'Roger 
Wagner ' ' and be regaled with the locations of 
every juicy piece of gossip we ever printed about 
him. Even the time he sang to his guitar all night 
at his company 's beach party and scared all the 
clams away. 

Meanwhile, this comprehensive index of 
Softalk articles will have to do. It lists all ar- 
ticles by title, then gives the author 's name, the 
issue date, and the page number. Well, usually 
the page number. Long and continuing series by 
continuing authors are listed only once, with 
starting and ending issue dates and no page 
numbers. 

Where this index falls short is in its list of 
reviews: It doesn 't have one. Its entire attention 
to reviews consists of the listing, "Marketalk 
Reviews. Monthly since September 1980. " 
Useless. So, next month in this very spot (or 
nearby, anyway) will appear a complete reviews 
index, from softday one through December 



1983. It'll be designed to fit right in with this 
index. 

Each January, we interul to provide a simi- 
lar index for the previous year. We 'II also offer 
supplementary disk indexes, assuming there 
really is a basic disk index by then (and you 
thought counting turkeys was hard . . .).Butwe 
all know about good intentions. Oh, well.

with Color Ribbon Savings. 

Exclusive Mosaic Mode suspends 
color dot overprinting operation, uses 
color dots printed next to each other 
(not on top of each other) to achieve 
the desired shade. And since fewer dots 
are printed, less ink is used, ribbon life 
is doubled and the PKASO/U pays for 
itself in ribbons saved. 

Do it with PKASO/U.

There comes a time in the life of every personal computer user when 
the boss, be it spouse, parent, or supervisor, suddenly wants an account- 
ing of the funds being spent to operate the computer. This month 
DOStalk will help you prepare for your day of reckoning. 

This month's column continues our investigation of text files. For 
those of you who missed it, last month's column was an expose of exec 
and other keystroke files. This month we're going to look at another 
widely used type of keystroke file— the VisiCalc file. 

If There Were a Pulitzer Prize for Software. . . . Here at DOStalk 
we think, as we've said before, that the development of VisiCalc was one 
of the great intellectual achievements of the 1970s. When it was first re- 
leased (at $99), VisiCalc was a totally original program. With VisiCalc, 
ordinary people were suddenly able to use a computer to crunch num- 
bers—lots of numbers. The power of the computer was liberated, and 
people loved it. 

For many months, the only computer VisiCalc would run on was the 
Apple. That was one of the major factors in Apple's early explosive 



Spreadsheet Fundamentals. When you run a spreadsheet program, 
your display screen turns into a very large ledger pad. Across the pad are 
a bunch of columns. Down the pad are a bunch of rows. In most spread- 
sheet programs, the rows are numbered and the columns are headed with 
letters. Figure 1 gives a visual image of a typical spreadsheet grid. 

Most spreadsheet programs use a grid much larger than the one 
shown here. The standard VisiCalc grid is 63 columns wide and 254 
rows deep. Only a small portion of the grid (twenty rows and as many 
columns as will fit) can be seen on the display screen at any one time. But 
by moving the program's window around with the arrow keys, the user 
can gain access to any part of the grid. 

Each of the little rectangles that make up the grid is called a cell. Each 
cell has a unique name, based on its position in the grid. The cell in the 
upper left comer, for example, is known as Al, since it is in colunrn A, 
row 1. The bottom right cell in figure 1 would be called 115. 

One of three kinds of information can be put in a cell— letters (a la- 
bel), numbers, or formulas.

growth. Thousands and thousands of Apples were sold simply as "Visi- 
Calc machines." 

Nowadays there are many programs from other publishers that do the 
same thing VisiCalc does. VisiCalc and the VisiClones make up a cate- 
gory of software usually referred to as spreadsheets. 

The stuff we're going to discuss this month will work with any 
spreadsheet program that's file-compatible with VisiCalc. If you can take 
a template created on VisiCalc and load it into your spreadsheet pro- 
gram, then you can also do the stuff we're about to discuss here. 

While this month's column is primarily about VisiCalc's files and 
some tricks you can do with them, we'll ease into the subject with a re- 
view of what a spreadsheet program is, what it does, and how it works- 



In figure 2, you see a grid that has had a number of labels placed in it. 
The labels should lead you to believe that we are setting up a spreadsheet 
template for keeping track of a computer's operating expenses. 

In the last column (I), we'll enter the amount we're supposed to spend 
during the year on necessities such as paper and ribbons for the printer, 
blank disks, computer magazines (very important), electronic mail and 
database fees, and maintenance of all our equipment. 

During the course of each month, we then enter in column C our 
actual expenses for the month. The spreadsheet program itself will 
automatically calculate and display every other number on the grid. We 
will instantly be able to see how much over or under budget we are for 
the month and for the year to date.

Bank President— first in the Lewis Lee 
Chief Executive " Series of exciting 
management action games. 

Do you feel you have what it takes 
to run a large organization? Well, 
here's your chance! See how well 
you can do under the pressures and re- 
wards top executives face. Lewis Lee's new 
Chief Executive™ Series — starting with 
Bank President — puts YOU in charge. 

Executive Competition 

As the Bank President, you choose and 
name the kind of outfit you want to run — 
a centralized business-oriented bank, or a 
retail-oriented one with many branches. 
You make critical business decisions: 

• Choose your product lines 

• Raise or lower employee salaries

Bank President lets you monitor your 
progress with clear graphic output. 

• Issue and redeem stocks and bonds 

• Manage your investment portfolio 

• Speculate on interest rates or hedge 
against fluctuations 

• Borrow from the Federal Reserve 

• Set loan and deposit interest rates 

IBM and Apple Versions 

Bank President is fun to play by yourself 
or against your friends. You can even form 
teams, with each team managing its own 
bank and competing against the other 
teams. The winner is the one whose bank 
creates the most wealth for its stockholders 
during the course of the game. 

Bank President's menu-driven design lets 
you focus on management action, not com- 
puter operation. Easy-to-read graphs, pie 
charts and bar charts track your success and 
that of competitors. The user's manual even 
gives you tips on how to outperform oppo- 
nents. And Bank President stays challeng- 
ing — it changes every time you play. 



Excitement through Realism 

You learn as much about opponents' de- 
cisions and the business environment as a 
bank president would, in clear graphic form. 
You get up-to-date economic information: 
T-bill and prime interest rates, consumer 
price indexes, GNP and stock market levels. 

Your decisions lead your bank to success 
— or failure. Bank President uses sophisti- 
cated, realistic formulas to determine the 
economic consequences of your actions. To 
win, you must be a better Bank President 
than your opponents. 

You use your computer for work. Now 
you can play, too — at your level. Contact 
Lewis Lee today to become — the Bank 
President.

Figure 2. Grid witli labels. 



Creating a Template by Hand. Before we get into the mathematical 
magic, however, let's look at some other stuff. To create a template such 
as the one shown in figure 2, we begin by using the arrow keys to move 
the spreadsheet's cursor to a cell (the space bar is used to switch between 
sideways and up-and-down movement, unless you have the Apple He 
version). 

When the cursor is properly positioned, we type in a label. If the label 
begins with a number or symbol, such as the ones in cells F4 and 14, we 
first have to enter a quote mark to tell the program we want a label rather 
than a formula or number. 

An alternative to moving the cursor with the arrow keys is the goto 
command. To give this command, we enter a right carat ( > ) and follow 
it with the name of the desired cell. By entering >A15 (think "goto A- 
fifteen"), for example, we can quickly move the cursor to the first col- 
umn and bottom row of our sample grid. 

Before entering any numbers or formulas into our computer expense 
template, let's save our work in a file called Scrooge's Demise. 

To save the template, we enter /SS. The slash is used throughout Visi- 
Calc to indicate that we're entering a command. The first S indicates that 
the command we want is storage. The second S indicates that we want to 
save, rather than load, delete, or initialize. 

After the template has been saved, our disk will include a three-sector 
file that appears to be a standard text file. It is. If we load it into a 
text-file-compatible word processor, we will find that the actual contents 
of Scrooge's Demise are as shown in listing 1 (the blank lines have been 
added for clarity — they aren't a part of the actual file). 

Even if you know no more about VisiCalc than what you've read 
here, you should be able to recognize that what the file contains is the ex- 
act keystrokes needed to reenter the template. VisiCalc saves templates 
in simple keystroke files. 

Inside a VisiCalc File. In the file, cells are stored in reverse order, 
from the lower right corner to the upper left corner. The reason for this 
is technical — a spreadsheet program can accept data faster this way. 

The first entry in Scrooge's Demise directs the cursor to cell A14 and 
puts the word total there. Next, the last two of the eleven letters in the 
word maintenance are placed in cell B12, the first nine in cell A 12. We 
are using the standard VisiCalc nine-character column width here. 

In row 5 and several other places, you will notice the command /FR 
between the goto keystrokes and the actual label. This command tells 
VisiCalc to format the label flush right. The label will be pushed to the 
right side of the cell. Normally labels are pushed to the left side. 

The last six lines of the file indicate how some of the spreadsheet's 
parameters were set when the file was saved. Those of you who are new 
to this need not understand these commands. Experienced spreadsheet 
users, however, will recognize that the first five of these commands set 
up the template. It will have one window, calculate column by column 
rather than row by row, automatically recalculate whenever anything in 
the spreadsheet is changed, display numbers in dollar format, and set the 
column width at nine. 

Very few of you will recognize the final line. The command /X is not 
a legitimate VisiCalc keyboard command. In a file, however, it is used to 
tell the program which direction cursor movement should be set for. 



which cell should appear in the upper left corner of the display, and 
where the cursor should appear. 

When Scrooge's Demise was saved, the cursor was in cell Al , which 
was in the upper left corner of the display screen at the time. 

Now that we have some idea what the files we save look like, let's re- 
turn to our template.

Figure 3. Grid with labels, numbers, and formulas, January 1 . 



Numbers and Formulas. Figure 3 shows what the template looks 
like after adding the year's computer budget in column I and entering the 
template's formulas. The 1 in cell B3 indicates that the template is set for 
the first month of the year. Figure 3 shows what the template would look 
like on the first day of January. 

Column C is blank. We haven't spent any money yet this year (the 
stores aren't open today). 

Note the zero entry at the bottom of column C— cell C14. This 
entry indicates that there is a formula in the cell. The formula is 
@SUM(C7. . .C12). This little ditty tells the spreadsheet program to 
calculate and display the total of the numbers in column C (the range of 
cells from C7 to C12). Since column C is currently blank, the total is 
zero. What you see in cell C14 is the result of the formula rather than the 
formula itself. 

In column D the cells show one-twelfth— one month's worth— of the 
annual budget. The formula in cell D7 is 17/12. This tells the spreadsheet 



program to take whatever number is in cell 17 (the annual budget for pa- 
per) and divide it by twelve. 

In column E the cells show the difference between what we actually 
spent and what was budgeted. If we overspend our budget, the overage 
will appear in column E as a positive number. If we underspend the bud- 
get, a negative number will appear. Since we haven't spent anything yet, 
the values in column E are all negative— indicating that it's time to spend 
some money. The formula in cell E7 is C7-D7. 

Columns F, G, and H are designed to tell us how we're doing for the 
whole year. In column F we want to see how much we've spent so far 
this year, plus what we've spent this month. We know that so far this 
year we've spent nothing, and that what we spend this month will be 
posted in column C. Thus, the formula in cell F7 is 0+C7. 

In column G we want a figure representing the portion of the total 
budget that should be spent by now. This will depend on what month it 
is. For January, the figure will be one-twelfth of the annual budget— the 



CONCERTO IN APPLE 11+ : A Sonic Sampler 

Time was when you went to buy an instrument, you would have had a fairly good idea of what it 
might or should or could look and sound like. A Sousaphone looked like a brass snake that had just eaten 
a water buffalo and sounded like a mastodon in heat. Cymbals looked like bronze dinner plates and 
sounded like traffic accidents. And so on. 

Well, times have changed. Of course you can still go out and buy your everyday sackbut or 
euphonium or what have you, but if you're into computers as much as we are, or have as many thumbs 
(five — count them, five — on each hand), then perhaps you might be interested in something a little 
more, well, Apple-onian (if you don't stop groaning we'll make you read that again). The problem then 
becomes deciding which system will come closest to doing what you want it to do, because each system 
is an entirely different kind of instrument. To put it another way, nobody real cares what brand of drums 
Gene Krupa played. He played the traps. No problem. But choosing between the MCI and the Music 
System might be. Sure, they both plug into your computer and they both work beautifully, but they work 
differently and sound different in ways that can only be appreciated by listening to a master perform. 

That's where we come in. Submitted for your approval, Apple Compote. An anthology of composi- 
tions produced on six different music packages and one very tired Apple n + . We're not talking about 
obnoxious doots and beeps here, either. This is a full toned Dolby stereo recording of works created by 
the Electric Duet, MCI, MC16, Music System, alphaSyntauri, and Soundchaser systems. Each piece is 
unique, and each is performed by someone who claims to know what they are doing. We hope to see you 
soon in their ranks.

same amount that appears in column D. But in February, the amount 
here should be two-twelfths of the annual budget; in June, six-twelfths; 
and so on. We have a number in cell B3 representing what month it is. So 
the formula at G7 can be D7*B3. 

In column H, we once again want to know the difference between 
what we've spent and what we've budgeted. This is the year-to-date 
equivalent of what we did in column E. The formula at H7 is F7—G7. 

Once the correct formulas have been entered at C 14 and in row 7, they 
can quickly be reproduced in other cells using the replicate command. 
This is one of the most powerful features of the spreadsheet programs, 
but a full explanation of the procedure is beyond the scope of what we're 
doing here. 

Meanwhile, Back at the File. If we now resave the template in fig- 
ure 4 as Scrooge's Demise, the numbers and formulas we have just 
added will appear in the file along with the labels we looked at earlier. It 
would belabor the point to reprint the entire file again. However, figure 
4 shows you the section of the file that re-creates row 7 so that you can 
compare how numbers, formulas, and labels appear when stored in a 
VisiCalc keystroke file.

Figure 4. Portion of Scrooge's Demise showing row 7. 

Let's imagine now that during the course of January we did spend 
some money. We finally got a new printer ribbon for $7.59; we paid our 
$10.00 monthly minimum fee to the Source; and we renewed our Softalk 
subscription. After entering these amounts in column C, our template 



would look like the one in figure 5. 

Note that even though we overspent our budget in the ribbon and 
magazine categories, we underspent in all the others. For the month as a 
whole, we spent $20.08 less than our budget allowed (El 4). 

After reviewing the January numbers, the usual procedure is to save 
the January template under a name such as Scrooge's Demise.jan, then 
prepare a February template. 

The February template needs to lock the amounts we spent in January 
into the year-to-date expense column, column F. Spreadsheet programs 
have a command for this. VisiCalc uses the pound sign (#) to lock or 
"pound" a calculated value into a cell. 

The major thing we need to do to create a February template is 
change the formulas in column F. For example, cell F9 needs to be 
changed from 0+D9 to 7.59+D9. In addition, we need to increment the 
month number in cell B3, and we should erase the numbers in column C. 
After making these changes, we would have a new February template 
like the one in figure 6. 

During the course of the year, we will have to make the above 
changes twelve times. This is rather tedious, particularly on real bud- 
gets, which tend to be several times larger than this one. 

An Introduction to Datagramming. However, by taking advantage 
of VisiCalc' s keystroke files, we can automate the procedure. This 
technique, called datagramming, isn't documented in the VisiCalc man- 
ual. Nonetheless, it is a very powerful feature. 

Let's sit down at a word processor and make a file that contains the 
keystrokes needed to convert Scrooge's Demise.jan into Scrooge's De- 
mise. feb. We'll call this file Next Month. The contents of the file are 
shown in figure 7. 

When the file Next Month is loaded (using the /SL command) on top 
of the January template, it enters all the keystrokes needed to create the 
February template. The process works exactly like the DOS exec com- 
mand we discussed here last month. 

Next Month, the VisiCalc keystroke file we created by hand, is a da-

tagram. If you are interested in finding out more about this technique 
(and many other VisiCalc tips), contact the International Electronic 
Spreadsheet User Group (Box 254, Scarsdale, NY 10583). The group, 
also known as InterCalc, publishes a monthly newsletter called Spread- 
Sheet. 

The Limitations of Datagrams. There are some limitations to what 
can be done with a datagram. In fact, these limitations may be why the 
VisiCalc manual doesn't mention the technique. 

While most VisiCalc commands, including insert and delete, will 
work in a datagram, we haven't been able to print. If we could, a major 
application of datagrams in DOStalk would be the printing out of very 
wide spreadsheets. If anybody out there determines how to use print in a 
datagram, let us know. 

Another major limitation of the datagram is that the replicate com- 
mand works only with labels and blank spaces. There doesn't seem to be 
any way to replicate a value or formula from a datagram. 

It is possible to link one datagram to another by making the last com- 
mand in a datagram /SLNext. Datagram. 

The VisiCalc /PF File. VisiCalc uses three distinct types of files. The 
standard keystroke file— created with the /SS command, reloaded with 
the /SL command — is the one we've been exploring this month. 

There is a second type of file that VisiCalc can create, but not reload. 
This file is created not with the storage command, but with the print 
command. By entering /PF (print to file— or /PD, print to disk, on very 
early VisiCalcs), a VisiCalc user can create a standard text file that con- 



tains a template as it would appear if it were printed out on paper. 

Like many VisiCalc commands, /PF is far more powerful than it first 
appears. One use of this command is to create flics containing printed 
templates that can be loaded into a word processor. 

The examples in this month's DOStalk, for example, were originally 
created on VisiCalc, saved with the /PF command, and then loaded into 
Apple Writer lie. Thus the figures became an integrated part of the 
manuscript. Any word processing application requiring numerical tables 
will proceed much faster with the help of a spreadsheet program to calcu- 
late and format the tables. 

The /PF command also allows you to use VisiCalc itself to create da- 
tagrams, exec files, or other standard text files. Although it's easier to 
create these kinds of files on a text-file-compatible word processor, a 
spreadsheet will help if you don't have one of those. 

The best way to proceed is to set the column width to 37 or so. Only 
one column should appear on your display screen. Enter text, such as da- 
tagram commands, into those elongated cells as if you were entering la- 
bels. When you /PF this kind of template, you create a text file. The con- 
tents of the file will be exactly what you see on your screen. 

The biggest problem with this technique is that there is no way to re- 
load the /PF file into your spreadsheet program. If you might need to re- 
edit the file later, save it with the /SS command as well. That version will 
be reloadable. 

Just as the /P command, usually associated with printing, provides a 
way to store a file on your disk, the /SS command, usually associated 
with disk access, includes a little-known variation that will send a file in 
the keystroke format to your printer. Type /SS,S1 , where the number fol- 
lowing the third S represents the slot your printer is connected to. You 
will get a template printout similar to the ones in figures 3 and 5 . 

The third type of file used by VisiCalc is the DIF (Data Interchange 
Format) file. Next month we're going to take an extended look at this 
type of file. DIF files were developed (by the same folks who brought us 
VisiCalc) to make it easy to exchange data among different programs. 
They are very versatile and can be used in many applications. See you 
next month.

CRAY CRUNCHES 
THE COMPETITION 
IN CHESS TOURNEY 




LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES 
ENTER THE COMPUTER AGE 



The law enforcement officer punches in 
his badge number on his car's computer ter- 
minal and receives orders to proceed to the 
neighborhood liquor store. He races to the 
store, where he enters and spots three 
innocent-looking customers. No more than 
fifteen seconds elapse before the trouble 
begins. A man takes a gun from his vest and 
threatens the cashier. The policeman now 
must make his move. 

The suspect whirls around and points the 
gun at the officer. Without warning, the sus- 
pect fires; the officer clutches his chest but 
doesn't fall to the ground. 

The scene takes place in no ordinary liquor 
store. It's a simulated crime — one of many en- 
acted regularly at Laser Village, the Los 



Angeles Sheriff's Department's new 
$514,000 training facility. Laser Village con- 
sists of a one-bedroom house and a two-story 
commercial center with a liquor store, gun 
shop, business office, bank, doctor's office, 
and saloon — all realistically furnished. This 
environment is the setting for confrontations 
between trainees clad in laser-sensitive 
vests— which, when struck by a laser beam, 
react by chirping and blinking — and play- 
acting suspects armed with special laser- 
equipped revolvers and shotguns. The beams, 
which travel as far as sixty feet, show precise- 
ly where real bullets would hit. Previous train- 
ing methods, which involved play-acting 
suspects and trainees using guns that fired

Who has the best chess-playing computer 
program in the world? 

Every three years, the Association for 
Computing Machinery makes use of its annual 
convocation to determine just that. The latest 
decision was reached at the Sheraton Center 
Hotel, New York, the weekend of October 
22 last year. The occasion was the fourth in- 
ternational gathering of electronic chess 
champs and hopefuls for the World Computer 
Chess Tournament. Twenty-two teams, repre- 
senting the United States, Canada, Germany, 
Holland, Finland, Sweden, and Austria, came 
to play. 

Ken Thompson's Belle, from AT&T's Bell 
Laboratories, the reigning world champion, 
had trounced Bob Hyatt's Cray Blitz in the 
Twelfth North American Championship in 
1981 . Both programs had been playing at mas- 
ter levels for the last two years. Was Cray 
Blitz looking for a rematch at the world meet? 

It got it. The spoiler for Belle, as it has 
been at previous meets, was Nuchess. This ar- 
tificial-intelligence-styled program, which ex- 
amines possible plays by a series of selective 
criteria rather than looking for every possible 
move in a series, took on Belle in the third 
round and handed it a loss — Belle'?, first ever 
in four years. Belle's point spread never re- 
covered. Hyatt's Blitz, running on a dizzy ing- 
ly fast dual-processor Cray computer, played 
to a draw with Nuchess in the fourth round. 
Cray Blitz went on to win the tournament in 
the fifth round. 

"Hyatt's program was already very 
tough," says tournament organizer Monroe 
Newborn, "and the speed was enough to 
make the difference." 

Some observers at the tournament said that 
Belle — on a portable machine — may have lost 
because of an "electronic concussion." Belle 
was in a car accident shortly before the tour- 
nament. 

Tony Scherzer's Bebe snagged second 
place by defeating Nuchess in the final round. 
Scherzer was one of several programmers 
present whose computers played much better 
chess than their creators. These programmers 
found it hard to tell whether a puzzling com- 
puter move was a subtle piece of strategy or a 
programming error. Other programmers who 
happened to be more skilled players watched 
in horror and frustration when their programs 
blundered into fatal errors or threw away ob- 
vious opportunities. 

In a special ceremony at the start of the 
tournament, before Belle got beaten by 
Nuchess and Cray Blitz, the U.S. Chess 
Federation officially awarded Belle the rank 
of master; this was the first time a computer 
program had been so recognized. The title,

Simulating Path of Particle Beam Bombardment 

Computers Help Doctors Fight Eye Cancer 



At one time the treatment for a tumor 
located within the eye involved either radical 
surgery or dangerous radiation. Neither 
strategy was risk-free. When surgery was 
done, the entire eyeball usually had to be 
removed to prevent the cancerous cells from 
infecting other body sites. And because the 
gamma rays used to irradiate the tumor are 
unfocusable and nonuniform, radiation treat- 
ment often meant the destruction of vision. In 
addition, tumor regrowth or other radiation- 
connected complications occurred in 50 per- 
cent of the cases. 

A program created by Dr. Michael Goitien 
of Massachusetts General Hospital now offers 
people afflicted with eye tumors a better 
chance at retaining their vision. Written in 
Fortran to run on a Digital VAX 1 1/780 host 
system, the program aids physicians and 
physicists by providing a computer model, or 
graphic interpretation, of a patient's eye. By 
interacting with the program, the physician 
can determine the appropriate particle course 
to attack the tumor, as well as the specific dos- 
age of radiation required to accomplish such 
a task. 

A modified version of Goitien 's program 
is currently being tested at Lawrence Berkeley 
Labs in California by a team of doctors and 
computer scientists. As it turned out, the 
Berkeley-based research team found 
themselves using a different set of graphic 
monitors and heavier particles (helium ions) 
for tumor bombardment, so LBL's Dr. 
Samuel Pitluck rewrote I/O routines and other 
algorithms to produce a program tailored to 
these specific conditions. 

The helium nuclei needed to bombard a tu- 
mor are produced by LBL's 184-inch 
cyclotron. An alternating electrical field ac- 
celerates helium atoms outward in a spiral and 
at right angles to a fixed magnetic plane. The 
cyclotron strips electrons from the atoms, 
creating alpha particles. Because they are 
electrically charged (unlike gamma rays), 
these particles can be focused and guided and 
can destroy a tumor without damaging the 
eye. Instead of delivering energy to all the 
tissue encountered, as x-rays do, these ions re- 
lease their energy at the end of their path— at 
the tumor itself. 

Normally, a physician can spot a tumor by 
looking directly into the patient's eye. Once 
the tumor has been located, ultrasound and 
wide-angle photography are used to create an 
image with depth, from which scale drawings 
of the tumor can be made. Circlets, or rings, 
made of the metal tantalum, are then sewn into 
the eyeball's exterior to mark the dimensions 
of the tumor. The rings are needed because 
the eye cannot be imaged by x-ray; the rings 
act as markers that map the shape and location 
of the tumor. 

At this stage, the computer comes into

blanks, were not nearly as accurate as the 
Laser Village approach. 

The program's goal is to teach deputies the 
proper time to use guns and to make them 
more aware of the "real" consequences of 
their actions. The village and the equipment 
(Laser Village has thirty revolvers and four 
twelve-gauge shotguns) do not, surprisingly, 
impose a taxpayer's burden, since everything 
is financed through private foundations. 

Whether in training or in actually enforc- 
ing the law on the streets, police in general are 
increasing their use of modern technology. 
Improving communications through the use of 
computer technology and controlling suspects 
through the use of nonlethal weapons, such as 
the Taser gun, are some examples of this 
trend. 

Efforts to use technology are motivated, in 
part, by the fact that staff positions have been 
eliminated because of budget cuts. (There are 
700 fewer positions in the Los Angeles Police 
Department than there were in 1975.) The 
police must also keep pace with criminals, 
who themselves have access to sophisticated 
technologies. For both reasons, the effec- 
tiveness of the individual law enforcement 
agent must improve. The age of the technocop 
has arrived. 



The LAPD's Emergency Command Con- 
trol Communications System (ECCCS) was 
implemented throughout Los Angeles last year 
and has resulted in the replacement of squad 
car radios with computer terminals. The $42 
million system enables officers to tap into 
computer data banks on a local, state, or na- 
tionwide level. When requesting information 
on wanted persons or stolen vehicles and 
property, an officer uses a portable keyboard 
to send a message to a central computer. The 
computer processes the request automatically, 
eliminating the need for an operator to handle 
incoming calls. Likewise, requests for help 
received at the complaint center are sent im- 
mediately to the officer's portable terminal. 

Training in the use of the system requires 
eight hours of classroom instruction and eight 
hours on an operational terminal. While no 
formal study of the effectiveness of the 
ECCCS has yet been made, its impact has al- 
ready been felt in the San Fernando Valley, 
where the system was originally implemented 
this past spring. The use of ECCCS has al- 
ready led to an increase in the recovery of 
stolen cars. 

As well as improving communication 
systems, the police in Los Angeles and other 
cities in the nation are experimenting with ad- 
vanced weaponry. The Taser, an electronic 
dart gun employed by the LAPD, is "not a 
replacement for a lethal weapon," according 
to Deputy Chief Clyde L. Cronkhite. Rather, 
it is an instrument designed to suppress uncon- 
trollable suspects painlessly. Each dart has a 
wire attached to it, and when the suspect is hit

crimc-rclatcxl issues, future funding of police 
activities, public perceptions of the police, 
and technological and demographic changes. 

As the use of technology in law enforce- 
ment agencies increases, changing the way 
police officers do their jobs, Cronkhite 
believes that the image of the police will also 
undergo a change. 

"We think that technology will not make a 
cold, dispassionate police force, but rather 
will give the officers more time to be of per- 
sonal service, to occupy themselves less with 
the mundane tasks that technology can per- 
form for them. " 

The technocops have arrived. Time, mon- 
ey, and society's response will determine 
whether they are here to stay. JG

one of the portable squad car terminals and

Left, portable terminals in LAPD squad cars are 
part of the $42 million Emergency Command 
Control Communications System that is 
benefiting both the police and those they serve. 
In the future, cops will take advantage of satellite 
technology to implement even more sophisti- 
cated metliods of communication. 



with a dart, the officer pulls the gun's trigger, 
causing the dart to emit a low-amp, high-volt- 
age charge that produces temporary paralysis. 
Once the trigger is released, the shock ceases. 
To be effective, the darts must be fired at a 
maximum distance of twenty feet from the 
suspect. 

Each month, experts in law enforcement 
and related fields convene at the Security 
Pacific National Bank headquarters in 
downtown Los Angeles for a meeting of 
Forum 2000 to discuss future technology and 
its effects on law enforcement. Among the 
topics discussed at Forum 2000: an automated 
fingerprint identification system, in which the 
image of a fingerprint would be digitally 
stored and transmitted (this could be especial- 
ly useful to retail stores); the use of three-di- 
mensional photography and computers to pro- 
duce lifelike portraits; and the practice of 
freezing criminals for the duration of their 
prison terms. 

Other ideas include police cars capable of 
deactivating the ignitions of other cars, and 
the use of satellite technology for communica- 
tions and for keeping track of criminals. A 
low-power microwave transmitter that could 
be implanted in a convicted criminal is anoth- 
er possibility. The transmitter would send a 
signal that could be picked up by a series of 
satellites capable of pinpointing the exact loca- 
tion of the transmitter. Thus, the whereabouts 
of the criminal could always be determined. 

After ideas are discussed by the one hun- 
dred-member panel, those deemed worth in- 
vestigating are presented to the planning and 
research division of the LAPD. This group 
elaborates on the ideas and puts them into 
project form. Besides attending the monthly 
meetings, Forum 2000 participants are active 
in subcomittees— groups that explore such 
issues as management/employee relations,

however, did not pass to Cray Blitz as simply 
as would, say, the championship in a heavy- 
weight title bout. To get the master rating, 
"you have to play twenty-four rated games," 
explains Bob Hyatt. His program had played 



nine or ten games prior to participating in this 
five-game tournament. 

Hyatt attributes his success to Blitz's in- 
creased depth of search in looking for possible 
moves from current positions. "Up until 
1983, Belle was the only computer capable of 
eight-ply searches [four full moves by each 
side, plus checks and captures]. It was looking 
at least eight half moves deep, and a lot deeper 
in some circumstances. We went to work on 
our program: I rewrote all the stuff for the 



251 

multiprocessor; Harry Nelson at the 
Lawrence Livcrmore Laboratory optimized it 
for the Cray, and we found ourselves gcjing 
eight ply. 

"Search depth and horsepower is the name 
of the game, and we happened to have an 
awful lot of horsepower this year." 

The program and its proud parent will not 
be resting, however. Hyatt is hoping to have a 
four-processor version of Cray Blitz running 
by this summer — a program that will think 
twice as fast as the current model. His champ 
has a full schedule until then. Chess master 
and programmer David Levy has long stated 
that he can beat any computer, and Omni 
magazine has agreed to pay $5,000 to 
anybody with a computer that can prove him 
wrong. Hyatt wants to take that bet and is 
looking for a sponsor for a Las Vegas 
showdown in January . In February , Cray Blitz 
will be in France, at the invitation of the 
French Ministry of Culture, for a three-day 
exhibition game. This summer, Carnegie- 
Mellon University will pit all the top-rated 
programs against equally rated humans. 

For the moment, whatever the future may 
hold for Hyatt's brainchild, the fast-moving, 
highly competitive world of computer chess 
has a new champ. "We were all very pleased 
at the outcome. Cray Research is happy 
because they're number one for the next three 
years," says Hyatt. "When we get the new 
version finished, it'll be able to look at forty to 
fifty thousand positions a second. We're going 
to make hay while the sun shines." AC

play. Dr. George Chen, a physicist, and Dr. 
William Saunders, assistant professor in the 
University of California at San Francisco's 
Radiation Oncology Department, manage the 
computer modeling of the patient's tumorous 
eye. Chen and Saunders make certain that the 
final direction of the particle beam and its 
depth within the tissue are optimized to pre- 
vent damage to significant structures within 
the eye itself, including the macula lutea (near 
the retina's center, where visual perception is 
most accurate), the optic disk and optic nerve, 
and the lens. 

The trick to this new technique lies in ob- 
taining the correct "gaze angle" for the pa- 
tient, who must look at a small flashing red 
light. This angle separates the eye structures 
and allows for a clean shot at the tumor by the 
helium particles. By controlling the gaze 
angles, Chen and Saunders can visually deter- 
mine the best path for the beam. 

"The eye can be looked at laterally, from 
overhead, or from any one of many different 
angles," states Chen. A two-and-a-half-milli- 
meter blue line encircling the envelope of the 
red tumor is automatically calculated and 
displayed on the screen. If this line intersects 
with, or is too close to, a significant structure, 
then the computed gaze angle is incorrect. 
Reentering data, the physicians can rotate the 
eye model until an effective angle that avoids 
proximity to critical structures is found. 

Depth of radiation penetration is also 
calculated by the computer, as are the actual 
doses that will be played over the tumor. 
"Our big advantage," Saunders says,"is that 
we can stop this radiation instead of having it 
whistle on through the tumor to other areas of 
the eye. We can also make sure that the beam 
sweeps back and forth correctly to give the tu- 
mor a uniform dose of radiation." 

Since radiation of the eye's lens can cause 
cataracts, an effort is made to avoid this. (For- 
tunately, however, cataract surgery is now an 
outpatient affair and easily managed.) 

Once the computer calculations have been 
made, a plaster-of-Paris mask conforming to 
the top of the patient's head is constructed. 
This model is then vacuum-formed using 
polystyrene, with openings for the afflicted 
eye. The mask makes it easier for the patient 
to hold still. It takes forty or fifty minutes to 
position the patient correctly for the beam 
penetration, which only takes a minute or so. 

The largest tumor successfully treated to 
date measured eighteen millimeters. Of the 
130 patients treated so far, 90 percent have 
been treated successfully— with success de- 
fined as retention of the eye for up to six 
years, tumor control, and no metastasis 
(transfer of a disease-producing agency from 
the original site to another part of the body). 
Similar research is under way for victims of 
certain spinal tumors that have proven to be 
resistant to x-ray treatment. HL

" ^What-Do-I-Do-Now? '^ 

Zork Books Due FromTor 



As anyone who's played one knows, per- 
sonal computer adventure games draw on a 
rich heritage of fantasy out of myths and 
legends, as well as from fantasy, adventure, 
and science-fiction literature and films. Years 
ago, recognizing the appeal of the interactive 
format of adventure games, book publishers 
began to offer novels for young readers in the 
interactive format. Most notable among these 
has been a series of "Choose Your Own 
Adventure" novels from Bantam Books. In 
these books, the reader can decide on the 
development of the story by choosing from a 
number of offered scenarios. The reader is 
then directed to a particular chapter — which 
chapter depends on which action was taken. In 
this way, the reader "assembles" the story. 

The "Choose Your Own Adventure" 
novels have proven very popular and are cur- 
rently being published at the rate of one tide 
per month by Bantam. Other publishers are 
bringing out similar lines. Having found new 
inspiration for these kinds of books from the 
wealth of adventure programs now available 
for personal computers, the book industry is 
even starting to translate computer games into 
interactive novels. 

In December 1983, Tor Books, a major 
science-fiction and fantasy publishing house, 
released Zork: The Forces of Krill and Zork: 
The Malifestro Quest. Both books are, of 
course, based on Infocom's bestselling Zork 
adventures and carry the Zork logo. 

According to the books' author, Steve 
Meretzky, the Zork books are especially close 
to the adventure game format in that there is 
only one "right" way to solve the adventure. 
(When the usual format for books of this type 
is followed, several story lines are offered.) 

The Zork books are the lead titles for a 
new line from Tor, labeled "What-Do-I-Do- 
Now." Two more Zork books are in the 
works, and the publisher has expressed in- 
terest in additional tides. 

At the same time the book industry is 
realizing that good computer games can 
become books, the computer industry is find- 
ing that good books can become computer 
games. 

Following the lead of board game manu- 
facturers such as Mayfair, software publishers 
are beginning to offer games based on 
science-fiction and fantasy novels. At the 
forefront of this trend is Dragonriders of 
Pern, a game based on Anne McCaffrey's 
novel of the same name. 

Due to be released by Epyx, Dragonriders 
of Pern is being billed as a "strategy" game. 
The game's scenario is based on one of the 
major elements of the book— the battle of the 
Dragonriders against "threads" threatening 



the planet Pern. 

In England there is another game that 
would seem to be based on the novel 
Dragonriders of Pern. The manufacturer of 
this game, however, apparently did not find it 
necessary to ask McCaffrey's permission to 
use the term Dragon Rider (the title of the 



game, released by a company called .Salaman- 
der), nor did it consult with her about the ap- 
parent use of the Dragonrider scenario from 
her book. In fact, British copyright law docs 
not protect authors against the use of their ma- 
terial in what arc called "derivative" works, 
such as games. 

Such is not the case in the United States. 
Some authors have been asked to adapt their 
work to computer games (for example, Larry 
Niven and Jerry Pournelle, with their col- 
laborative novel Inferno), and several soft- 
ware publishers are looking at recruiting 
science-fiction and fantasy writers to create 
game scenarios and to review and edit adven- 
ture games for plot continuity, grammar, and 
other elements. MB

□ Far East Computing. The Interface 
Group (Needham, MA) has announced that it 
will hold a Comdex in Japan next spring. The 
three-day computer dealer show will take 
place at the Harumi exhibition facility in the 
Tokyo International Trade Center March 
26-28, 1985. Closer to home, and coming up 
sooner on the calendar, is the premiere of 
Comdex/Winter at the Los Angeles Conven- 
tion Center April 5 - 7, 1984. Also, the fourth 
annual Comdex/Spring will be held in Atlanta 
May 22-25. 

□ Spring ME Festival. Well, there probably 
won't be any US Festivals in 1984, but the 
ME Festival is returning. Sponsored by 
California State College in San Bernardino 
and various organizations, including the U.S. 
Small Business Administration, the ME 
(Microtechnology for Everybody) Festival 
will be held April 27-28, 1984, at California 
State University San Bernardino. Besides giv- 
ing that surrounding community a look at ad- 
vanced technology, this year's ME Festival 
will feature the Robot Olympics. School- 
children from kindergarten to high school will 
program robots for competition in "com- 
pulsory figure" and "free-style" events. For 
more information on the ME Festival and the 
Robot Olympics, contact the ME Festival 
coordinator at CSUSB's Computer Center. 

□ Marliet Manual. Writer's Digest Books 
(Cincinnati, OH), a publisher best known for 
its how-to books and market directories for 
writers, artists, and photographers, has 
recently published the 1984 Programmer's 
Market. Edited by Brad M. McGehee, the 
book contains several chapters on how to put 
together and market programs, and numerous 
market listings, including both software 
publishers and magazines that buy programs 
from free-lancers. Writer's Digest Books is 
currently putting the finishing touches on a 
companion volume. The Complete Guide to 
Writing Software Users ' Manuals, scheduled 
for publication this spring. 

□ The Way We Are. The Fourth Annual 
Talmis Conference takes place in Chicago 
February 15-17, 1984. The conference typi- 
cally attracts hundreds of executives responsi- 
ble for strategic planning, marketing, and de- 
velopment of home and educational computer 
industry products. The conference includes 
many opportunities for attendees to discuss 
computer industry issues and trends. For more 
information, contact Talmis at its Oak Park, 
Illinois, office. 

□ Rotate 'n' Roll Robots. Virtual Devices 
(Bethesda, MD) is sponsoring the First An- 
nual Robot Roll-Off. Participants have to 



build a robot that can maneuver a simple 
course on its own; open doors; detect sound, 
light, and motion; and do it all against the 
clock. Robot Roll-Offs are scheduled in cities 
across the country during the summer of 
1984. The Roll-Off grand prize winner 
receives $5,000, while runners-up get cash 
and merchandise. Participants can enter their 
own creations or existing robot kits, such as 
Heathkit's Hero, RB Robot's RB5X, and 
others. 

□ Keeping an Eye on the Books. Howard 
W. Sams and Company (Indianapolis, IN) has 
released a new hook— Microprocessor-Based 
Robotics— for robot hobbyists. The 224-page 
book covers ways to build robot hands, legs, 
and bodies using common household items. 
Written by Mark J. Robillard, the book also 
discusses how to make robots see, touch, and 
move, and how to use microcomputers to con- 
trol robot movement. Also new from Sams is 
a book about satellite communications, called 
The Birds of Babel, and a listing of terms used 
in the security industry, called the Security 
Dictionary. Written by Hal Glazer, The Birds 
of Babel covers the basics of satellite 
technology, legal issues, social and political 
concerns, and the business side of the in- 
dustry. Security Dictionary, compiled by 
Richard A. Hofmeister and David J. Prince, 
covers video equipment, computer hardware 
and software, ultrasonics, infrared sensors, 
microwaves, and how such things apply to the 
security field. The book also includes tables of 
security and fire protection symbols. 

□ The Sound of Computing. The IEEE 
1984 International Conference on Acoustics, 
Speech, and Signal Processing will be held 
March 19-21, 1984, at the Sheraton Harbor 
Island Hotel in San Diego, California. For 
more information, contact Sam Vilione of In- 
terstate Electronics in Anaheim, California. 

□ Computing Albion. Britain is lagging 
behind the U.S. in its use of microcomputers, 
according to San Francisco, California-based 
computer services firm Ferrin. Company 
chairman David Ferris, who spoke recently at 
an industry gathering in London, says there 
are similarities between what users are doing 
in the U.S. and what they are doing in the 
U.K., "but there seems to be a time lag of 
about a year between the two." Much of the 
software being used in the U.K. is indigen- 
ous—for instance, data management packages 
such as DMS and Cardb ox— although U.S. 
software products still abound. Ferrin puts the 
size of the British personal computer market at 
about one-tenth the size of the American 
market. According to Ferris, many Brits look 
on their lagging position as a blessing in dis- 
guise. "The lag means it's possible to benefit 
from the experience gained and lessons 
learned in the U.S." 

□ Hi-Tech Highway Help. Starting late last 
year, the Automobile Club began making 
TDD (telecommunications device for the 
deaf) units a part of its Emergency Road Serv- 
ice. TDDs are about the size of an ordinary 
typewriter and allow speech- and hearing- 
impaired people to send typewritten messages 
over telephone lines. Currently, some 



telephone companies distribute portable TDD 
units; speech- and hearing-impaired in- 
dividuals can apply lor a TDD through their 
local phone company. Those hearing- 
impaired Auto Club members who own a 
TDD can request emergency road service 
when their vehicle breaks down, if they can 
get to a pay or private telephone. Freeway call 
boxes are not yet equipped to handle the TDD 
equipment. 

□ Captive Penguins in a Totalitarian 
State? Everything you'll ever want to know 
about penguins and then some is likely to be 
on a new computer system at Hubbs-Sea 
World Research Institute. The Atlantic 
Richfield Foundation has donated $20,000 to 
finance a system that will help collect and 
analyze growth, breeding success, health, and 
behavioral characteristics of each of the 
several hundred penguins in Sea World's 
Penguin Encounter in San Diego. Big Penguin 
is watching you!

ightning cracked the sky, painting the night with ragged 
lines of white. Thunder rattled the window panes, and 
rain beat a steady drumming on the roof. Trash and 
leaves from the streets flew in the air, propelled by the 
wind and sluiced down the streets. 
The phone rang, once. 
The line connected, answering with a high-pitched squeal. Another 
squeal replied, and after a second both squeals stopped. 

The video monitor glowed to life, green letters appearing rapidly as 
the monitor received input from the computer for the first time that night.

She opened the door. "Sure, I'll make some coffee." 
John followed close behind her, shutting the door quickly as a gust of 
wind blew cold air and rain inside. 

The door slammed and Susan turned around. 

"Sorry," John said. He took off his coat. "Where can I hang this?" 

"Here," she said, holding out her hand. 

She hung up their wet coats while John looked around the living 
room. 

"You have a nice place," he said, mostly to himself. 
Susan made an "uh-huh" sound from the kitchen. 
While she was bent down behind a counter, he took a quick look into 
a room adjoining the living room. 
"You've got a computer," he said. 

"Yes," she said, carrying back two cups of coffee. She handed him 
the coffee. "It's instant. I didn't feel like waiting." 

"I guess most electricians own computers." 

"I don't know," Susan said. She sat on the couch. "My company 
buys them for the employees. And I'm not an electrician. I design cir-

usan bent close to the lock, blinking as rainwater drib- 
bled into her eyes. John stood close behind her, shield- 
ing her with an almost collapsed umbrella. 

"You want to come in?" she asked over her 
shoulder. 

"Well, I had been thinking. ..."

"Oh, sorry." John took a swallow from his coffee, smiling weakly. 
"Look, really, I'm sorry. Blind dates are always mismatched. I've never 
gone out with a ... a person who knows anything about electronics. 
And you've probably never gone out with a CP. A." 

Susan smiled. "Oh yes I have. If you're friends with Madeline, 
you've gone out with C.P.A.s." 

John took another swallow. "You know it's on." 

Susan looked a bit confused. She said with a sideways glance, 
"What's on?" 

"Your computer." 

"Oh." 

"Should it be on like that, all alone?" 

She laughed. "It's probably getting a call from someone. It's pro- 
grammed to answer calls for me." 
"Could I see?" 

Susan looked slighdy irritated, then smiled. "Oh, why not? Sure." 
She stood up and John followed. 

The monitor screen was full of glowing green type, new lines slowly 
being added to the bottom.

"What's diat?" John asked. 

"Hell if I know," Susan said. She pulled out the chair and sat down 
before the computer. 

She pressed a key labeled ESC. The menu flashed before her eyes.

"What did you do?" John asked. 

"I hung up on the creep. Damn kid, probably." 

"Do you get many of them, owning a computer I mean?" 

"No, usually. ..." 

The phone rang, once. 

Susan and John watched as the computer went through its greeting 
program.

"Damn!" Susan said. "Doesn't he know enough is enough?" 
She went to the menu again and hung up. 
The phone rang again almost instantly. 
"You better just unplug it," John suggested. 
Susan unplugged the phone from the wall. 

John called Susan at her office the next day. 
"Hi. This is John." 
"Oh, hi. Listen, you got me at a bad time," Susan 
said. She sat at her cluttered desk, rubbing her finger 
against her nose, eyes on the screen dump before her. 
"Do you want me to call back?" 
"No, that's all right." 
"I had a good time last night." 

Susan thought through her date. On the whole, she had had a decent 
time. 

"Yeah, so did I." 

"But look, that's not why I called. In the newspaper this morning, 
there's an interesting article." 

"Oh?" she said. She rarely read the paper. 

"Yeah. It says that from about 8:15 to 9:15 all the 655 exchanges 
were busy. I mean every single phone was ringing constantiy. The phone 
company can't understand it. They say it isn't possible." 

"Oh, dam," she said. The screen went from an ordinary byte-by-byte 
description of a hi-res screen to meaningless characters. 

"What?" John asked. 

"Huh? Oh, I'm sorry, John. My run just got fouled here. Uh, what's 
so interesting about this article?" 

"You're in the 655 exchange, aren't you?" 
"Yes." 

"Isn't that the time you got the obscene phone call?" 
"The obscene ... oh, that! I guess, although 8:15 is closer to the 
time I unplugged the phone." 

"Okay, see what I mean? Doesn't that mean something?" 

"What, the exchange going crazy and my phone call? It doesn't mean 



a thing." 

"Oh," John said, sounding let down. "Well, I thought it might be 
cormected." 

"I seriously doubt it," she said. 

"Just a thought. . . . Would you like to go out again?" 

Susan glanced at her screen again and the lines of gibberish. 

"No, I think I'll be busy until late. But call me tomorrow . . . really, 
call tomorrow." 

"All right, tomorrow then. Bye." 

"Bye." 

Susan hung up the phone, then hit the reset key. She sighed and 
leaned back in her chair. She stretched her arm to its fullest, reached, 
and gingerly opened the door to the disk drive, pulled out the floppy, and 
tossed it on the desk. 

Not a bad guy, she thought. Cute, doesn't understand a thing about 
how the world works, but a nice guy. 

Funny thing about the phones. That really shouldn't be possible. 
There are about four thousand 655 numbers and any average day about 
six thousand calls going on at the same time. At a peak calling period, 
there're about ten thousand calls; any more than that and there's a delay. 
And if you have four thousand of those calls in just one exchange, and we 
haven't converted to fiber optics in Northglen . . . 

She picked up the phone and called Arlo at Bell. 

"Hi, Arlo. This is Susan. Hear ol' Ma Bell got busy last night." 

"You're not kidding. We're still trying to figure it out." 

"How many calls did you have before 8:15?" 

"Uh, I dunno exactly. Let me see." 

Susan heard the crunching sound of fan-fold paper. 

"A heavy night. You know, people always like to talk when there's a 
really nice storm. 

"Let's see, we were averaging seventy-five hundred ... I can tell 
you've been thinking this one out, Susan. It's not possible to average 
seventy-five hundred and have every 655 number ring." 

"Do you have a time?" Susan asked. 

"I've always got the time for you, Susan." 

"Fresh. Do you have a time when you first noticed the trouble?" 

"It didn't creep up on us. Every single line started ringing at 
8:14:36." 

"Hmm. Well, I hope you can figure it out. Thanks, Arlo." 
"Not so fast. Why this interest?" 

She thought about John's call. "Oh, nothing. Just a bored hacker 
calling about another hacker's problem." 

She hung up; 8:14— that would be just about right. 

She inserted a Telefon disk in the drive. She called her home and saw 
her greeting on the screen. 

She got the menu and then typed L for log.

nohn glanced apprehensively at the sky while standing 
outside Susan's door. The clouds hung low over the 
city; occasional rumblings rolled out from the sky. 
Susan opened the door. 
"Hi, thanks for coming." 
John stepped inside. Susan stuck her head out the 
door for a second, glancing up at the sky before closing the door. 

"So what's this about, Susan? You sounded mysterious over the 
phone. I thought you didn't want to do anything tonight." 
John was about to sit down on the couch. 
"No, not there. Come into my study." 

John followed Susan into the study. She had put a chair beside the 
chair that went with the computer desk. 

"Sit here." John sat. Susan remained standing. 

"You called me at work today about that newspaper story?" John 
nodded. "I did some checking. The phone company told me every 655

mean exactly— at 8:14:36 p.m. I unplugged my phone at 8:14:35." 

John hung one arm over the back of his chair. "I thought you said the 
two things didn't have anything to do with one another." 

"I thought it was just a coincidence— before. But now I'm not so 
sure. Let me show you what I found when I got home." 

Susan sat down before her computer. She pressed the return key. 

"This is the file my phone caller opened."

"That's weird stuff, Susan. But I thought you said a kid. ..." 

"Sure, a kid who's read too much science fiction might do that as a 
joke. Some adults I know of would do that. But some kid isn't going to 
tie up four thousand phone lines. Maybe it's me, John. Too many 
Twilight Zones. . . . I'm scared . . . but I like it." 

"I don't understand." 

"This is going to sound real silly, so don't laugh at me," she said. 
"Look, in any horror movie it takes the main characters three-quarters 
of the movie to know what's going on because they won't accept the out- 
of-the-ordinary explanation. But not me, I'm willing to believe." 

"Believe what?" 

"Believe that this is something that's just been bom." 
"Are you trying to say that gibberish is true?" 
"Yes." 

"But anybody with a computer could have done that, couldn't they?" 

"Yes. But nobody could make every 655 line ring at the same time." 

"This kind of stuff doesn't happen for real. And if this is real, 
shouldn't we tell someone?" 

"Tell them what? No one's going to believe us. What evidence do we 
have? Some computer files I could have typed myself?" 

"Why did you ask me here? I won't be any help." 

"I don't know. Maybe because you were here when the call came. 
Maybe because I like you. Maybe because I'm a little scared, in a good 
sort of way. Maybe because I'm hoping it'll call again." 

A strong rumble rattled the window. 

"Call again?" 

Susan looked out the window. "It was bom in the storm. Tonight's 
the same. It may call again." 

John glanced at the yellow phone beside the computer. Its cord was 
connected to the wall. Another cord went from the phone to the com- 
puter. 

"What makes you think it will call again?" John asked. 

"That's what it was trying to do last night. After I disconnected the 
phone, it was trying to find my number from all the 655 numbers." 

"Why didn't it try earlier? Has it tried to call yet?" 

"No. I connected the phone just before you came, and it's just about 
7:48, the time it called before." 

The phone rang. 

"Oh, geez," John said. >»

"Oh, no," Susan said. 
"What's the matter?" 
"He picked the controller." 

She leaned forward across John and flipped a switch marked SPKR 
on a homemade control box next to the computer. 

A fast series of touch-tones sounded over the speaker. The tones 
came fast, faster, almost a blur of sound. 

"He's looking for the code," Susan said. 

The tones continued for several minutes. Then, unnoticeable at first, 
the lights in the house dimmed. Through the study window, they could 
see the other houses on the streets, their lights still shining through the 
windows. 

"What's going on?" John asked loudly. 

"The BSR controller," Susan said. "I've wired my house into the 
computer. If I'm away from home, I can control the lights, the fumace, 
the radio, the TV, the alarm system, from anywhere there's a phone." 

The lights suddenly brightened. The radio tumed on, then off. The 
fumace started. Soon the relays were opening and closing faster than the 
appliances could respond. From around the house, John and Susan could 
hear the clicking of television sets, coffeepots, the abbreviated peal of 
the alarm system. 

After a few minutes, the pace slowed as the entity exhausted every 
electrical connection in the house. 

The prompt returned to the screen.

Suddenly the screen blanked.

"This is too unreal to be real," John said. 

"It's different this time. Did you notice? The first time it called, all 
gibberish. But this time, it made sense, sort of. It's smart enough to 
know about baud rates and controllers. It's learned a lot since last 
night." 

John shook his head. "You're really enjoying this. I'm scared 
to death and you're really enjoying this." 
"Do you hear something?" Susan asked. 
Outside, emergency sirens wailed fitfully through the storm.

he phone rang at Susan's desk. She looked at the phone 
for several seconds before picking up the receiver. 
"Hello," she said, slowly. 
"Hi, uh— Susan?" 
"Yeah. John?" 
"Uh-huh. Nervous, huh?" 
"Yeah." 
Silence. 

"Well, I read the paper this morning," Susan said. 
' ' Uh-huh ," John said . 

"Uh-huh," This has been a brilliant conversation so far." 
"Well, I was hoping you had an idea." 
"About. . .?" 

"About what we're going to do. I mean, aren't we going to do 
something?" 

"According to the paper, there were about a thousand false alarms 
last night. People in five exchanges couldn't use their phones last night 
because of busy signals. The rest got wrong numbers. And — and, a 
friend told me that Western Union's computer here started wiring money 
to people all over the country. No way to tell what was legitimate and 
what was . . . our friend." 

"My business, too. We haven't told anyone yet, but half of our ac- 
counts were wiped out." 

"Too bad. But what can we do about it, John?" 

"We know." 

"Sure. So what do we do about it? Tell the police? Bell Tel security 
is already working on it. If by some miracle, this is a person doing this, 
they'll find him. But I don't think they'll find anyone. Listen, the 
forecast tonight is for thunderstorms, probably severe— do you want to 
come over tonight?" 

"I don't know. Why don't we go somewhere else? Do we have to be 
around when it calls?" 

"I need to know. I need to know more about what this is. If you 
won't come, I'll just wait for it alone." 

John sighed. "All right. Count me in. Same time?" 



trash can rolled down the street. Its din added to the 
wash of rain against windows, the roll of thunder, the 
whistle of wind through trees. Lightning in the east, 
south, and west fractured the sky, breaking it into a 
million pieces as the storm, hemmed in by the moun- 
tains, remained over the city. 
Rainwater collected in the streets, running like rapids, swirling at the 
drains and sending paper cups, cigarettes, and newspapers to the sewers. 
Sirens from fire engines, police cars, and ambulances kept a constant 
vigil. 

Susan and John sat close to the computer, cups of coffee in their 
hands. Both wore heavy sweaters. 
"Cold in here, Susan." 

"I know. But I pulled the controller from the computer and the ther- 
mostat's wired in directly. Just drink more coffee." 

John took a sip, then said, "What do you think it is?" 

Susan puffed her cheeks and exhaled a slow breath. "Just guessing 
now — and assuming this isn't somebody with more switching equipment 
than the phone company— I'd say it's everything. 

"Take every telephone line, every power line, every computer, 
every generator — you have a creature with a blood supply, a nervous 
system, and thousands of brains and thousands of hearts who is stretch- 
ing across the country and reaching into every business, every hospital, 
every home. 

"I think we reached critical mass, enough memory, enough relays— 
and then you stir in something — a catalyst — like a strong end-of-summer 
thunderstorm. ' ' 

"What about during the day?" 

"I don't know. The creature is still there, all the parts necessary in 
billions of miles of wiring, but the spark that brings it to life is not there 
until a thunderstorm. ..." 

The phone rang. Susan looked at the clock, "Seven forty-eight," she 
said. "Right on time." 

The computer went through the greeting routine. The caller opened 
the file Hydra, selected the column width, and then, nothing.

could be useful." 

%WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US? 
%Let me live. 

"What's he mean by that?" John asked. 
%WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

%They come.

The screen cleared and the menu appeared. The creature asked to 
open another file— HYDRA AWAKE 23.465. 

The creature accessed the disk. It started whirring and clacking. 
"What's that?" John asked, pointing to the red "in use" light. 
"My hard disk drive. He's saving a file to disk." 
The disk continued whirring for several minutes. 
"Isn't this taking an awfully long time?" 

"Yes, but it's a forty-megabyte hard disk and it's only half full. It 
could take a real long time." 

The lights went out in the house. John and Susan quickly looked out- 
side and saw that all the other houses were dark, too. 

The screen said:

CALLING PARTY HAS DISCONNECTED AT 20:09:17. 

"How come your computer is still working?" 
"I have about a thirty-minute power backup." 
Susan picked up the phone. 
"Dead. The phone company got to it. 
"Now to see what's on the disk." 

Susan exited the telefon program and asked for the hard disk catalog. 
She saw all her programs and, at the bottom, HYDRA AWAKE 23.465 
fdling about 20.3 of the 21 megabytes remaining on the disk. 

It was a text file. 

Susan pulled out a floppy from her tray, inserted it in the eight-inch 
drive and typed, "Run read any text fde." 

The computer quickly tried all the different possibilities and opened 
the fde. 

"Source code for an assembler. Lots and lots of it. Doesn't look very 
familiar, either." 

"I don't understand," John said. 

"It's pathetic," Susan said. "It was trying to save itself, I think. This 
could be part of a startup program for itself. But diere's not enough room 
on a forty -megabyte drive, no room on all the floppies in my house." 

"Then it's dead?" 

"Well, at least for tonight. And the forecast for tomorrow is fair 
weather. I'm sure the power and phone people will try something to keep 
it from awakening. And it's a damn shame. Think of something alive in 
there, something that could have helped us with our communications, 
our power distribution." 

Susan took out another floppy and put it in the drive. She typed some 
keys, and the hard disk and eight-inch drives started whirring. 

"And now?" 

"Well, I can't keep all that stuff on my hard disk. I need the space. 
But I just can't delete it, for all the good it can do. I'm putting it on Uiese 
eight-inch disks, just as a memento." 

Susan kept typing HYDRA AWAKE 23.465 as the fde name. 

In another house, before another computer, somebody saved 
HYDRA AWAKE 23.466.

ifestyle Budgeting!" 



tnenistbudget^ 
system that considers all 
your needs. 

others have done it . . . 
so can you. 

Dr. Harper Roehm. the author of 
Spending Less and Enjoying It More 
(the McGraw-Hill book that provides 
the basis for this system), desigi\ed 
Lifestyle Budgeting when his income 
was cut in half due to a career change 
from corporate auditor to university 
professor. As a result, his famOy has 
lived comfortably, fulfilling their 
"wants" as well as their "needs" for 
over 20 years. 

We show you "why" 
as weU as "how." 
Lifestyle Budgeting is the first com- 
plete budgeting package to include 
an easy-to-understand book explaining 
the behavioral aspects of successful 
budgeting as well as software to handle 
the mechanics. It takes a practical 
approach, showing you not only how 
you're spending your money, but why 
... so you can identify your true priori- 
ties and plan for them. 

Planning is the key. 
Lifestyle Budgeting's software is a 
forecasting and modeling tool, not a 
checkbook balancer. It will track your 
spending patterns, identifying where 
you're vk^asting valuable funds. Using 
that information, and your family's 
priorities, it will show you specifically 
how to project and plan future costs. 

Little time, and no accounting 
experience required. 

Unlike most budgeting systems. 
Lifestyle Budgeting does not require 
detailed expense records. It will only 
take a couple of nights to set up and 
then only one or two hours a month to 
monitor. And ... a big plus . . . Lifestyle 
Budgeting is written for you, not your 
accountant.

Softalk Presents The Bestsellers 



Now that the returns are starting to come in, you have to wonder what 
the Spracklens were waiting for. 

For those of you who have been nodding off during lectures, Dan and 
Kathe Spracklen are the authors of Sargon, by far the bestselling micro- 
computer chess program extant. But you wouldn't know it from the last 
few months sales in the Apple market. 

The version Hayden Software was selling was Sargon II, now a 
three-year-old program. The Spracklens had a better version running on 
a souped-up Apple, but seemed content to rest on their laurels as far as 
the commercial market went. 

Then Odesta came out with Chess 7. 0, which gave Sargon a run for 
its money in competitiveness and gamely vied for shelf space at the com- 
puter store. It looked as though Sargon was a has-been. 

So much for resting on laurels. The Spracklens went back to work 
and delivered up Sargon III, which went on sale to astounding results in 
November. The sales were remarkable in that no one believed that any 
chess program could pull big enough to make a significant dent in the 
Top Thirty. 

Sargon III did. 

Even though availability was spotty for most of the month, a problem 
that seems to have plagued this program from the outset, copies were fly- 
ing off the shelves. Enough were sold in the stores that managed to get 
their hands on copies to boost Sargon to twenty-second on the Top 
Thirty, the only new program to score in November. 

Not that there weren't some shakeups on the list, but other newcom- 
ers had enjoyed — or suffered through, depending on your perspective — a 
gestation period. Only Sargon III made it to the Top Thirty in a single 
bound. 

Other programs making the bestseller list for the first time were The 
Incredible Jack, The Quest, and Dollars and Sense. Jack is the senior cit- 
izen of the bunch, having been around for a year and providing valida- 
tion for the concept that it takes most serious software about a year to get 
established in the Apple market. 

The program has an odd sales profile, being carried by fewer com- 
puter stores than any other program on the Top Thirty. There's tremen- 
dous polarization of view about the program, with some stores listing it 
as their hottest program and others deriding it as 'The Incredible Jerk.' 
Overall, Jack has been making consistent im-oads in the dealer market, 
and that effort is now paying off at the cash register. 

The Quest has been around for a couple of months as the strongest of 
the hi-res adventures. Not only did it rise to the Top Thirty, it also cap- 
tured number one on the Adventure 5. 

Dollars and Sense shows the value of a strong distributor. The pro-

gram is the product of a subsidiary of Softsel, and the huge software dis- 
tributorship has shown a flash of their old acumen in getting it into 
stores. During Softsel's early days, no distributorship was better at 
breaking a new product than they. It appears Softsel hasn't lost its touch. 

November was generally an up month, with the entertainment soft- 
ware benefitting most from the increased buying. Getting no benefit 
from the faster sales pace was VisiCalc. For the first time in forty sur- 
veys, the venerable pioneer spreadsheet program missed the top five po-

Some of that can be traced to heightened interest in entertainment

software as Christmas was approaching. Some falloff can be attributed to 
stepped-up competition, although VisiCalc is still well ahead of 
Multiplan in the Apple market. Probably most important is the changing 
profile of new Apple owners. They seem more directed toward word 
processing than toward number crunching, as evidenced by four of the 
top five programs leaning in that direction. 

There were only four favored suppliers in the Apple III market.

Quark's Word Juggler tied with VisiCorp's VisiCalc: Advanced Version

The four leading arcade games maintained their positions, but lower 
down there were a couple of surprises. Frogger got new life and jumped 
to fifth on the Arcade 10 list as well as edging into the Top Thirty. Atari- 
Soft's Pac-Man moved into ninth on the Arcade 10 in its first month of

Sargon III took over the lead from Flight Simulator among Strategy 5 
contenders. The new face was Eagles, which soared to fourth. 

There were shakeups in order among the Fantasy 5, but the same five 
programs were represented. Wizardry grabbed the top spot as well as 
fourth on the Top Thirty. Sir-tech's standard seems to be benefitting 
from the release of the third in the series — Legacy ofLlylgamyn. Legacy 
dropped from first to second among fantasy entries and dropped from 
seventh to eighth on the Top Thirty. 

Exodus: Ultima III held third on the fantasy rolls but moved up to 
ninth on the Top Thirty. Sir-tech's Knight of Diamonds was fourth and 
Ultima II was fifth. Both made it into the lower ranks of the Top Thirty 
as well. Hovering nearby was Electronic Arts's Standing Stones, which

LIFE IS LIKE 





IT'S IMPORTANT TO OWN THE RIGHT UTILITIES! 



THE ROUTINE AAACHINE 



Better than Compilers! Better than Program 
Generators! Better than Iwlodlfied BASICS! Thats 
right! THE ROUTINE fVIACHINE is the newest program- 
ming breakthrough from Southwestern Data 
Systems that allows even the beginning program- 
mer to put professional, high-speed and compact 
machine language routines into any Applesoft 
program. 

THE ROUTINE MACHINE IS BEHER than compilers 
because your program gets SMALLER with Routine 
Machine, NOT LARGER like all compilers. In addition, 
the machine code is not just shortcut BASIC, it's 
professionally-written and optimized for FAST 
execution and minimum memory use! 

THE ROUTINE MACHINE IS BEHER than program 
generators because you can create many different 
types of programs using the Routine Machine 
approach, from educational software to scientific 
applications, not just different variations on the 
same database. In addition, the code added is a 



single machine language routine, not many 
redundant blocks of inefficient BASIC like most 
program generators, 

THE ROUTINE MACHINE IS BEHER than modified 
BASICS or other sets of limited routines that load onto 
a language card or into a block of memory some- 
where. Because a RAM card is not needed, you can 
use a relocated DOS for maximum memory 
capacity. Because you choose just the routines you 
want, you keep memory use to a minimum. Because 
the library of routines is unlimited, you can also 
continue to add routines from magazines or your 
own special routines with no concerns at all for 
memory conflicts. The Routine Machine can also be 
used in any Apple II, II*, or He with or without RAM 
cards. Programs that use the Routine Machine can 
also be sold commercially (many are already!). 

$64.95 

(Includes 31 routines and a complete disk of demos!) 



THE ROUTINE MACHINE 



FOUR GREAT LIBRARY DISKS are already available for 
the Routine Machine! Depending on the particular 
type of program you are vi/rlting or altering, you can 
choose the Routine Machine Library disk thaf s right 
for you. 

If your program uses Applesoft arrays then 
this package is a must! You can speed up sorting 
and searching, even read and vi/rite entire arrays in 
a single program statement. Imagine being able to 
delete an array when It Is no longer needed, or 
re-dimension it with no loss of data. If you've ever 
had a program stop for minutes at a time for no 
apparent reason, this package can cure that 
problem tool $49.95 

Rsr programs that graph or plot data, this 
package will let you do in a single statement what 
would otherwise take an entire subroutine In BASIC. 



Automatically sets up screen plotting according to 
your own custom scaling, complete with clipping, 
optional logarithmic scaling and more! There are 
even routines to automatically split your program 
around the Hi-Res pages and to convert 3D data to 
2D projected displays with control over rotation, 
perspective, etc! FREE SOR-DISK * $49 95 

& SCREEN: An entire collection of text screen 
management routines. Includes INPUT USING, 
CURSOR MOUSE CONTROL, 4-WAY SCROLLING, 
SCREEN DUMPS and more! Also Includes the SCREEN 
GENERATOR, a special utility to design text screens 
with a minimum of effort. The completed screen is 
entirely executed In one ampersand (&) statement, 
whether Input or output! $49,95 

& SAMPLER I: A collection of assorted routines that 
are useful in a wide variety of programs. Of particular 
interest are the disk access routines that allow you 



MERLIN 



The Assembler of Choice of many leading 
software companies! MERLIN is an extremely 
powerful 6502 macro assembler with 
complete 80 column support (with an 
optional soft-70 display if you don't hove a 
cord)- MERLIN is easy to use for the beginner, 
yet powerful enough for the professional. As 
our #1 selling utility, MERLIN is nationally 
recognized as the best assembler available for 
the Apple! Features include macros, assembly 
to disk, use of linked source files, ond word 
processor features like search and replace. 
Best of all, MERLIN is completely co-resident 
with a 1 6K RAM card so as to be always avail- 
able, even while you're testing the created 
programs! MERLIN also supports the new 
65C02 microprocessor and is hard disk 
compatible, MERLIN is also available for the 
Commodore 64. $64.95 
FREE! The Apple MERLIN assembler also

there are many other routines like IF-THEN-ELSE,

Very little changed in the Business 10. The Incredible Jack moved up 
to fifth behind the four pacesetters that held their positions. The only 
newcomer to the list was General Ledger from State of the Art, returning 
to the Business 10 after some months just outside the list. 

The hobby market remains the almost exclusive domain of Beagle 
Bros. Six Beagle programs made the Hobby 10 list and six more were in 
the first eight following the top ten. Apple Mechanic pushed past Beagle 
Basic to the top spot. 

Two programs that have been near the Hobby 10 without ever crack- 
ing the list finally made it in November. Copy II Plus got eighth and 
Merlin, the assembler from Southwestern Data Systems, nabbed tenth. 

In the home market. Home Accountant is outselling Dollars and 
Sense by a three to one margin, but looks to be facing a serious challenge 
for the first time in recent months. Music Construction Set dropped to 
third, but the combination of it and the Mockingboard were making 

Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 8.27 percent of all sales of Ap- 
ple and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in December to ascertain their sales for the month of 
November. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was the number of units sold— such other 
criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer store, and personal preferences of 
the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in December represented every geographical area of the continental United 
States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index number 
to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is an arbitrary 
measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are correlative only to the 
month in which they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index rating of 50 in one 
month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in another month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus or minus 2.72 percent, which translates roughly into 
the theoretical possibility of a change of 3.01 points, plus or minus, in any index number.

SOFTWARE THAT CHALLENGES, 
INTRIGUES, AND ENTERTAINS... 



As you search for 
freedom, you will 
test your courage 
and challenge 
your problem 
solving ingenuity. 



A lesson in the balance of power 





Modern weapons have been 
transported back intimeto World 
War II and both sides have mind- 
boggling capabilities. There is no 
guaranteed winner this time 
around. 

From a command chopper, you 
must coordinate your ground 
forces against a force as complex 
and strong as yours. You must 
mastermind a strategy with infan- 
try, tanks, bunkers, bases, bal- 
loon mines and much more! 

The fate of the world is in your 
hands as you struggle to liberate 
the European continent, and save 
the free world! Learn to develop 
your survival instincts and win 
over an equal enemy because 
right is on your side! 



This terror filled adventure game begins on a dark, stormy night. You find 
refuge in the only available shelter-- an eerie mausoleum. 
Suddenly you are trapped in MEDEA's forbidden tomb. 

All the dangers and horrors you ever imagined await you in the hidden 
passages and secret rooms of MEDEA's crypt. You strain your intellect and 
match wits with MEDEA's ghoulish obstacles and secrets of the deep 
passages. You may escape with your life... or face eternal entombment in 
the CRYPT OF MEDEA.
