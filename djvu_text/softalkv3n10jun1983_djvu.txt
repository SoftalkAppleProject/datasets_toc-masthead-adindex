CONTEST: 

Final Exam 



Good afternoon, class. We're all anxious to 
go home and pack our bags for Hawaii, Eu- 
rope, Greece, or wherever we're planning to go 
for summer vacation, but nobody leaves this 
room until everyone's taken the final exam- 
ination. 

The test covers the following subjects: his- 
tory, folklore, literature and humanities, math- 
ematics, anatomy, and general knowledge. 

It's really simple. All you have to do is read 
the questions, write your answers on a separate 
sheet of paper, and send it in. And, just to keep 
everyone in the competitive spirit, we'll award 
$100 worth of Softalk advertisers' goods to the 
person who ends up with the highest score. 

Here are a few guidelines for the test: 

1. Many of the answers can be found with- 
in the confines of your computer room. Others 
have appeared in books and national publi- 
cations {Softalk, Newsweek, Time, Wall Street 
Journal, Mad). If you think you have a correct 
answer, but you're not sure your source is the 
same as ours, be sure to list your source of in- 
formation with your answer. 

2. The test can be a team effort. Work with 
your family, friends, pets, and local computer 
store if you like. The more help you get, the bet- 
ter you'll probably do. Visit your computer 
store. If you have to, go over to Steve Jobs's 
house and interview him. Your final grade is 
limited only by your creativity and resourceful- 
ness. Go for it. 

3. Some sections have two questions per 
number. In these cases, the first question (24a, 
for example) is for students with the Apple II or 
II Plus. The second question (24b, for example) 



is for students with the He. Apple III students 
will have to trek down to their computer stores. 

If you have a He, you don't have to answer 
the quesfion for the II, and vice versa. If you 
have a III, you can answer either question. 

Questions with several parts to them (a— e, 
for example) are to be answered by everybody. 

4. All questions are worth 5 points each, ex- 
cept where noted. There is a total of 157 points 
possible. 

5. Write your answers on a sheet (or sheets) 
of paper, with answers appearing by their cor- 
responding numbers. 

6. On the bottom left-hand comer of the 
envelope, indicate which test you're taking U, 
He, or III. 

That's all there is to it. Please do not begin 
the test until you see the word go. You must 
turn in your test so that it's postmarked by July 
10, 1983. Please include the following informa- 
tion on your test form: 



Name:

City, State, Zip: . 
Phone number _ 
My local dealer: 



What I'd like to win: 



Send your exam to Softalk (Con)Test, Box 60,

Final Exam 



JUNE 1983 



CONTEST WINNERS 

Oracle '83: 
The Saga Contimies; 
Lingering Limeridks 



The results of this part of the Oracle '83 con- 
test were originally scheduled for the May issue, 
but everyone around here was so sick of read- 
ing, talking, and hearing about the Academy 
Awards that we decided to wait until most had 
pretty much forgotten about them. 

Oracle Oscar '83. If ever there was a pre- 
dictable year for Oscar winners, this wasn't it. 
Most contestants were able to predict that 
Meryl Streep would be the one to walk off with 
the award for best actress {Sophie's Choice); but 
only a handful picked Ben Kingsley to run 
off with the Oscar for best actor in Gandhi; and 
an even smaller group was able to sit through 
three hours of Gandhi {thank goodness for inter- 
mission!) and foresee its winning the award for 
best picture. 

Many contestants were clairvoyant enough to 



NE), Paul Shanberg (Moraga, CA), Carl Webb 
(Vista, CA), Michael Wolgelenter (Palo Alto, 
CA), and Shirley Young (Farmers Branch, TX). 
Faithful followers of these contests will imme- 
diately recognize previous winners in Radano- 
vich (Oracle '82, part 5), Shanberg (Oracle '81, 
part 5), and Webb (Apple Trivia and So/talk 
Ghosts contests). 

Predicting who would take top honors 
wasn't too hard, given the nominees. However, 
predicting who would be nominated presented 
quite a problem for many Oracle contestants. 
Choices for best actress included Jane Fonda, 
Dolly Parton, Raquel Welch, Drew Barry- 
more, and E.T. For best actor, many entries 
listed Richard Pryor, Jeff Bridges, Yoda, Burt 
Reynolds, "the kid who played 'Elliott,' " Mark 
Hamill, and E.T. again. 




Save the Subheads contest winner Lisa German is shown here receiving Deadline and Choplifter from 
Pete Soul<up of Memory Bank (Bettendorf, lA). German got bored with the whole photo session and 
began eyeing more things she'd lil<e to win. Soul<up was more interested in getting his picture in 
Softalk.

Essay Question

ple (any model) is the be.st darn personal computer in 
the universe (no points will be awarded for this ques- 
tion; it's just for fun). 2M 



pick two of the three correctly, but only ten got 
them all. 

The Softalk random number generator was 
called in to break the tie, and in typical RNG 
fashion it generated a random number that was 
guaranteed to upset everyone involved. Every- 
one, that is, except for David Miles (Gillette, 
WY), who is this month's winner. Miles plans 
to put the $100 he wins for this part of the 
Oracle contest toward the purchase of a Votrax 
Type-'N-Talk speech synthesizer. 

The other movie buffs who correctly pre- 
dicted this year's winners are, alphabetically, 
Geraidine Bass (Williamsburg, VA), Scott R. 
Bauer (Pittsburg, CA), J. Young Liu (Rancho 
Palos Verdes, CA), Kevin C. Park (Los An- 
geles, CA), Edward Radanovich (Bellevue, 



The Standings. At the end of round two last 
month, which included predicting the partici- 
pants in the NCAA Basketball Tournament's 
Final Four, the coleaders in the overall Oracle 
'83 were Gordon Bitko (East Brunswick, NJ) 
and Matthew Silverstein (New Rochelle, NY), 
each with eight points. Not too far behind were 
Lee Banks (Gadsden, AL), with six points, and 
Tom Brown (Hopatcong, NJ), with five. 

But leads are always changing in the Oracle 
contest, and this round brought out some new 
faces in the crowd. Not surprisingly, each of the 
top five leaders in this contest received the maxi- 
mum fifty points possible for predicting the 
Academy Award winners. First place is a tie be- 
tween Wolgelenter and Radanovich, with fifty 
points each. Hot in pursuit are Webb, forty-

nine points; Miles, forty-eight points; and Shan- 
berg, forty-four points. 

Perhaps the person who suffered the most 
during this contest is Meryl Streep. No, she 
didn't enter the contest, so we can't embarrass 
her. She was, though, the actress whose name 
lent itself to the most spelling variations. There 
was Tom Brown, who probably saw Sophie's 
Magician, starring Merlyn Streep; Justin Shaw 
(Mancos, CO), who was rooting for Merly 
Street; Wes Wasson (Kingman, AZ), who 
picked Maralyn Streep; Brian Karmelich (Ran- 
cho Palos Verdes, CA), who chose Meryll 
Steep; Gr^ Cheong (Astoria, OR), who pulled 
for Myrle Sreepe; and James Karns (Colum- 
bus, OH), who tagged Myrl Strept as the 
winner. 

Oracle judges almost disqualified Don 
Morgan (Xenia, OH), who obviously wasn't 
taking this contest seriously. Morgan wrote, 
"Best picture will be one of the following . . ." 
and proceeded to list all the likely winners. He 
did the same for best actor and best actress, 
knowing that one of them would win and he'd 
have himself a prize. Pretty clever, Don, except 
you forgot to include Gandhi on your list for 
best picture and Ben Kingsley on your list for 
best actor. Okay, everybody point and snicker! 

There Once Was a Contest in March. And 
in typical Limerick Contest fashion, the contest 
staff couldn't agree on a winner. Let's have a 
look at what happened. 

The contest staff met in the Softalk Lim-

erickorama (formerly the Kumquatorium), 
where they argued for three days and nights 
over which limerick was the best. "None" was 
the consensus; most of them were good. Many 
were great, and some were just plain outstand- 
ing. In the final analysis the staff decided that it 
really didn't matter which limerick they thought 
was the best. This is the readers' section of the 
magazine; let the readers decide. 

50 that's how we're going to settle the Great 
Softalk Limerick Debate '83 — the readers will 
vote for their favorites. The finalists appear at 
the end of this section, but let's have a little fun 
first. 

Algebra 2 was probably nobody's favorite 
subject in school, and it's definitely not Sean 
Walter's or Roger Kitterman's (Kansas City, MO) 
favorite either. Walter sent in nineteen limericks of 
his own and collaborated with Kitterman on five 
more. "RogCT and I wrote these during Algebra 2; 
he wrote a Une, then I wrote one, and so on. . . ." 
Well, Sean and Roger, they weren't that great. Bet- 
ter concentrate on your binomial functions and 
inequalities. 

Walter did, however, submit a limerick in 
Latin, which is here for everyone's viewing 
pleasure: 

Uxor ludis pommo ludere fruitur. 

51 casum habeo sistatur. 
Sed ille arduum agere 
Quad re fruor etiam ludere, 

Ita pommus meus refutabitur. 

We all got a good laugh out of it; hope everyone 
else did, too. "Pommus meus refutabitur"; that's a 
good one! 

Jeff Moyers (Keezletown, VA) is sick. How 
sick is he? Take a look: 

A girl with no regular sleepers 

Got infested with some crawly creepCTS 

When asked, "Are they crabs? 

You've got gabs and gabs." 
She said, "No, they are Lunar Leepers." 

That's how sick. 

Probably the trickiest limericker around is 
Darren Vengroff (Lubbock, TX). His limerick 
wasn't very good, but he sure concealed his Ap- 
ple reference well. See if you can find it: 

Oh, the warriors who come from Tai-dou 
Are some of the toughest around. 

See to beat them I've heard 

A slash must convert 
'Em from a bull to. a cow 

(Answer is at the end of this section. No 
peeking!) 

Paul Duggan (Philadelphia, PA) and John 
Morrison (Philadelphia, PA) came close to win- 
ning this contest in the alien division; both en- 
tered limericks written in Bezardian text. Un- 
fortunately, they forgot that Bezardian limer- 
icks are written with the first and fourth lines 
rhyming, while the other three lines aren't sup- 
posed to rhyme at all. Oh well. 

In the Department of Unoriginality, we re- 



fused to give finalist consideration to limericks 
that used the following words or phrases as ref- 
erences to Apple-related companies and prod- 
ucts: broader buns or broader bunned (Broder- 
bund), serious (Sirius), innovation and stand- 
ing ovation (Novadon), my crow and so on 
(Micro anything), th' underwear (Thunder- 
ware), and amuse (Muse). Also thrown out 
were most of the "pen, Gwens" (Penguin). 

Attention, Mrs. Jeff Miller (Mishawaka, 
IN): Keep an eye on your husband. His prize se- 
lection read, "If I win, I would be so excited to 
have a roll in the hay with Stevie Nicks. Other- 
wise, I guess I would like $1(X) worth of Sticky- 
bear products for my young son." 

And while we're wrinkling noses at prize se- 
lections, let's not overlook Harriet Walsh (Men- 
lo Park, CA), who asked for "a bath in an Irish 
spring (big enough for two)." 

Well, that's enough kidding around for 
now. Let's get to the finalists. Listed here are the 
eleven limericks that rated highest with the de- 
mented contest staff. The original plan was to 
invite all of So/talk's readers to a B.Y.O.V. 
(bring your own volleyball) barbecue and let 
them choose the finalists. But that would have 
cost a lot of bucks and we just couldn't afford it, 
even though contestants' prize selections indi- 
cate that they think we could ("a new Apple 
lie," "a Hayes Smartmodem 12(X)," "a Lisa," 
"lots of money"). Instead, we chose the eleven 
best and are submitting them for readers' ap- 
proval. Here's where you come in. 

Another Chance To Win. All you have to 
do is pick the limerick you like best and write its 
number down on a post card. Limericks should 
be judged on cleverness, originality, wit, and 
general emotional movement. Each limerick 
contains an Apple-related company or prod- 
uct; so if you can't spot the reference, you know 
the limerick's a good one. Vote only once, but 
vote! Everyone who casts a ballot will be eligi- 
ble to win a $50 credit toward games, utilities, 
hardware, or whatever. The choice is yours. 

Of all the voters who vote for the winning 
limerick, one will be selected to go on a $50 
shopping spree, and we'll pick up the tab. And 
just to assure everyone that we're sincere, if you 
find another magazine that offers more in the 
way of prizes for voting in limerick contests, just 
send us a clipping of its contest page showing 
what it's offering, and if you win we'll match the 
offer. Sound fair? Darn right. 

So, read the limericks, write the number of 
the one you like best on a post card (don't for- 
get to include your name, address, and phone 
number), and send it to Softalk Limerick De- 
bate '83, Box 60, North Hollywood, CA 91603, 
postmarked by July 10, 1983. 

Here are the finalists, in no particular order. 

1. Oakland's Henderson, O how he flew. 
But the catcher was late to pursue 

With the pick-off forsaken. 
Result: (accent Jamaican) 
Rickie slid! An' he stole de base, too!

If you guessed that a Practical Peripherals Micro- 
buffer™ printer buffer saves time, you're right. For 
the way it works, this inexpensive product is the 
most practical addition to your microcomputer sys- 
tem ever. 

With Microbuffer, you don't have to wait for 
your printer to finish before you resume using your 
computer. Data is received and stored at fast speeds, 
then released from Microbuffer's memory to your 
printer. This is called buffering. The more you 
print, the more productive it makes your workflow. 

Depending on the version of Microbuffer, 
these buffering capacities range from a useful 8K of 
random access memory — big enough for 8,000 
characters of storage — up to a very large 256K — 
enough for 256,000 characters of storage. 

Practical Peripherals makes stand-alone 
Microbuffers for any computer and printer combi- 



nation, including add-on units especially for Apple 
II computer and/or Epson printers. Each has differ- 
ent features like graphics dumps and text format- 
ting besides its buffering capabilities. You can 
choose one that's just right for your system. 

Best of all, they're built to last and work 
exactly like they're supposed to. 

If you're still guessing whether you can afford 
to have one, talk with any computer dealer. That's 
the best way to find out how practical a Practical 
Peripherals Microbuffer is.

Infocomania. October 1982. John DeLore- 
an was having problems raising business capi- 
tal, John Cougar's Jack and Diane was topping 
the pop charts, and Softalk ran its Ghosts con- 
test. Ah, what memories; isn't it fun getting nos- 
talgic? We realize a lot of you are too young to 
remember any of those events, so we'd like to 
help by giving a summary of how these situa- 
tions progressed. 

In November 1982, DeLorean sports cars 
began selling like crazy to collectors; in Decem- 
ber, Jack and Diane came tumbling down; and 
this month, Softalk is announcing the winner of 
the Ghosts contest. 

Kudos are in order for Carl Webb (Vista, 
CA), who read the "Exec Infocom" article in 
the October 1982 Softalk and turned in the 
most complete and detailed list of references to 
games written by Infocom authors. Contest 
winning is beginning to become a habit for 
Webb. Last summer, he also came in first place 
in the Apple Trivia contest, winning himself a 
Disk II drive in the process. 

Webb managed to recognize twenty-two of 
the forty-three Infocom references and identify 
the games they appeared in. "I haven't played 
all the games, but I recognized them by reading 
Softalk reviews of the games," explained the 
sneaky ghost hunter. 

To get more use out of the disk drive he won 
for the Trivia contest, Webb will receive Info- .] 
corn's Starcross adventure. 

Parse/ Fail Test. Tests have been graded, I 
and the winner of the Softalk Lit contest is Ron j 
Hollar (Bakersfield, CA), who not only turned ! 
in the longest program, but also one that made | 
coherent sense. Hollar will get $25 credited to- 
ward the purchase of Ultrasoft's Mask of the 
Sun.

Fastalk is your quick guide to popular, special- 
ized, or classic software. Programs appearing in Fas- 
talk must meet one or more of the following criteria: 
(1) equal or surpass in sales the least-selling program 
to appear on any of the current bestseller lists; (2) re- 
late to a specialized subject area and be in general dis- 
tribution (more specialized packages and areas will be 
included as Fastalk matures); (3) be new and of pro- 
fessional quality (such programs will be carried for 
one month only — after that, they must meet other cri- 
teria for inclusion); (4) stand out as extraordinary. 

Designation as a classic is noted by a bullet pre- 
ceding a program's title. 

Where opinion is expressed. So/talk has seen the 
software in question; the date of So/talk's review, if 
any, is given at the end of the item. 

Softalk may arbitrarily omit any package from 
Fastalk, whether or not it meets the foregoing criteria.

aliens jtnir kids can 

reason!^ 
instead of destroi^ 




This year, thousands of Kids VA/ill be 
searching for the most amazing thing. 

At Spinnaker, we don't believe in the 
"kill or be killed" concept behind nnost 
computer gannes, In fact, we believe 
connputer gannes should be instruc- 
tive, hot destructive. Butjust as 
importantly, they should be fun. 

That's why IM SEARCH Of ThlE HOST 
AMAZIhQ Thiri(j'"is designed to let your 
kids negotiate with aliens instead of destroy- 
ing them. Because given the opportunity 
kids enjoy using their minds. 
It's Amazingly Fun. 

The Most Amazing Thing is out there 
somewhere. Finding it won't be easy 
But relax, your kids will have the 
help of their old uncle 5moke Bailey 
He'll give them a B-liner (sort of a 
cross between a hot air balloon 
and a dune buggy) to use on their 
Journey They'll have to learn how to 
fly the B-liner and navigate it through 
storms and fog. But before they do 
anything, your kids will have to talk to Old 
Smoke, he'll tell them about the Mire People 
and the strange language that they speak, he'll 
also tell them to avoid the dangerous Mire 
Crabs and how to get fuel for the B-liner 

Your kids will visit the Metallican Auction 
where they'll trade with the aliens for valuable 
chips. Your kids will then use these chips to buy 
things they'll need for their trip. And your kids 
will learn how to fly over the planet using their 
jet pack. 

The Most Amazing Thing 
holds great powers, but it will 
take great skill, persistence 
and imagination to find it. 
It's Amazingly Educational. 

lh5EARChOFThEM05T 
AMAZIhC ThlhC is written by 
Tom 5nyder, educator and 
author of the best-selling 
Snooper Troops™ Detective 

Series. 

And like all Spinnaker games, Ih 
SEARCh OF ThE MOST AMAZIhC: ThIhQ has real 
educational value. For instance, your kids will 
sharpen their ability to estimate distances and 




quantities. And since they'll be navi- 
gating their B-liner, they'll become aware 
of distance, direction and time. They'll also 
develop a knack for economic and monetary 
principles through trading with the aliens. 
And they'll solve problems through trial 
and error 

They'll learn all of these things, plus they'll 
learn that nothing is impossible if you put your 
mind to it. 

A novel Approach to Computer Games. 

Besides offering your children all of the above, 
IM SEARCH OF ThE MOST AMAZING ThIhQ gives 
them an opportunity to develop their reading 
skills. Because included with the game Is Jim 
Morrow's new novel T he Adventures of Smoke 
Bailey' So your children will have hours of fun 
reading the book or playing the game. And 
they'll be learning at the same time. 
Parental Discretion Adv/ised. 

If you're a parent who would rather see your 
kids reason with aliens than destroy them, 
you've got plenty of reasons to 
ask your local software retailer 
for Ih SEARCh OF ThE MOST 
AMAZIMQ ThlhC. It's compatible 
with Apple;- IBM,® Atari,® and 
Commodore 64™ computers. 
And it offers so much fun you'll 
probably be tempted to play it yourself.

You'll find this is one computer game that 
won't alienate you from your

Guardian Angel switches to 150 
watts of backup power in 1/100 of a 
second or less while alerting you of 
blackout or brownout conditions. Its

down your system if line power does 
not return. 

Guardian Angel is compatible with 
virtually every major microcomputer 
system, including Apple, IBM, H-P, 
TRS-80, Xerox, Eagle and Osborne. 
Its transient voltage suppressor 
also prevents system damage from 
power spikes.

between your power source and your 
microcomputer. Its compact size 
permits either desktop use or out of 
the way placement.

of text on the screen. The eRAM 80 allows the 
monitor to display 80 characters per line with com- 
patible software. Instead of the usual 40. 

That uncomplicates things. Especially when 
it comes to word processing. And creating or 
editing documents.

Besides improving character count, Quadram's 
eRAM 80 offers 64K of auxiliary memop/. 
Whenever the Apple lie's internal memory isn't 



enough to handle all data and programming 
needs, let eRAM 80 take over Even double 
storage space, up to 128K, by combining eRAM 
80 with some software. 

When using compatible software, it's easy to 
switch from the main memory to eRAM 80. So 
you can store and retrieve information needed.

System Saver 

The most ixnpuA *,ailt p^illpilleiml fbi' ydiii- Appig 




For Line Surge Suppression 

The SYSTEM SAVER provides es- 
sential protection to hardware and 
data from dangerous power surges 
and spikes. 




By connecting the Apple II 
power input through the SYSTEM 
SAVER, power is controlled in two 
ways: 1) Dangerous voltage spikes 
are cUpped off at a safe 130 Volts 
RMS/175 Volts dc level. 2) High fre- 
quency noise is smoothed out be- 
fore reaching the Apple E. A PI type 
filter attenuates common mode 
noise signals by a minimum of 
30 dB from 600 khz to 20 mhz, with 
a maximum attenuation of 50 dB. 



For Cooling 

As soon as you add 80 columns or 
more memory to your Apple II you 
need SYSTEM SAVER. 

Today's advanced peripheral 
cards generate more heat. In addi- 
tion, the cards block any natural air 
flow through the Apple n creating 
high temperature conditions that 
substantially reduce the life of the 
cards and the computer itself. 



SYSTEM SAVER provides cor- 
rect cooling. An efficient, quiet fan 
draws fresh air across the mother 
board, over the power supply and 
out the side ventilation slots. 



For Operating Efficiency 

SYSTEM SAVER contains two 
switched power outlets. As shown 
m the diagram, the SYSTEM 
SAVER efficiently organizes your 
system so that one convenient, 




The heavy duty switch has a 
pilot light to alert when system is 
on .You '11 never use the Apple power 
switch again! 




Easy Installation 



Compatible with Apple Stand 



Just clips on. 
No mounting or 
hardware required.

Two hundred years ago, in 1783, a new sort of society and a new 
sort of state canne into being. 

"It was like something coming out of an egg," writes H. G. Wells in 
The Outline of History. "It was a western European civilization that had 
broken free from the last traces of Empire and Christendom; it had not a 
vestige of monarchy left and no state religion. . . . Even its unity was as 
yet a mere unity for defense and freedom. It was in these respects such a 
clean start in political organization as the world had not seen before." 

The new society and state was the young United States of America, 
which officially ceased fighting with Great Britain on April 19, 1783. Two 
hundred years later the United States is again the site of a struggle to re- 
shape the world we live in. America has been an industrial and agricul- 
tural society for most of its two hundred-plus years, but that is now 
changing. 

With the help of computers, big and small, we are entering the in- 
formation age— a society that depends more on the exchange of know- 
ledge than physical goods. In the coming decades we just might elimi- 
nate all mindnumbing, backbreaking work and improve the quality of life 
for those ready to embrace the computer revolution. 

SoftallK is dedicated to making the shift to the information age as 
smooth as possible. We recognize and understand the needs of those 
who are taking the gamble of buying a personal computer. The Apple is 
a wonderful machine, but it's only as smart as its owner. 

Published twelve times a year, Softall< is dedicated to illuminating the 
world of the Apple II, Apple lie, and Apple III. Both experienced users 
and novices will find what they need in Softa//(— news, tutorials, reviews, 
programs, and feature articles on applications and on the people who 
shape the industry. We're working overtime to bring you the best end- 
user Apple magazine on the newsstands. 

And, at first, we believe this information should be given out free. If 
you recently acquired an Apple computer or have owned an Apple for a

Quark introduces 

A deceptively simple solution 
to your word processing dilemma. 



If you're serious about word processing on 
your Apple*lle, you may be bewildered by the 
sheer number of programs available. And a 
tad perplexed by their claims and promises. 
After all, a glamorous package that says "easy 
to use," may not even be easy to open. 

The dilemma is real. And Quark is happy to 
provide the solution. 

A proven program for serious 
word processing. 

Quark's new Word Juggler Me turns your 
computer into a dedicated word processor. 
You get the extraordinary ease of use, sophis- 
ticated capabilities and straightforward docu- 
mentation that make our original Word Juggler 
a best seller on the Apple III. 

For example, there's virtually nothing to 
memorize. Because principal editing functions 
are identified on a unique keyboard template 



— and nineteen, easy-to-install, replacement 
keycaps. 

Changing keys is quick and simple, too. Just 
slide our special keycap remover over the key 

— twist — and pull. Your new keycaps can be 
in place in less than two minutes. 

A flexible tool to increase your 
productivity. 

But don't be deceived by Word Juggler lie's 
disarming simplicity. The program packs the 
powerful features you need to quickly perform 
the most complex editing tasks. 

Characters, words, even entire paragraphs 
can be deleted with a single keystroke. There 
are search and replace keys. Block move and 
copy keys. And you always have instant con- 
trol over page length, margins and any other 
formatting parameters. 

Document display and print out are easy, 
also. One keystroke displays your document 
on the screen. Another prints it. And whether 




Word Jugglerlle 



you need to print only specific pages, multiple 
copies, or even documents too large to fit in 
memory. Word Juggler lie can easily accom- 
modate you. 

A clever way to foil Mr. Murphy. 

Even the best of us occasionally forgets 
when "i" does not come before "e" — and 
even the most agile fingers can press the wrong 
key. So you should also give serious consider- 
ation to Quark's new Lexicheck® lie — a spell- 
ing checker with a highly compressed, 50,000 
word dictionary. 

Accessed from within the word processor, 
this program lets you virtually eliminate typo- 
graphical errors and common misspellings. 
Lexicheck lie will scan your document at up to 
8,000 wpm — then highlight, in context, the 
first occurrence of any word it does not 
recognize. 

If the word is correct, as in the case of in- 
dustry jargon or abbreviations, you can simply 
add it to your personal dictionary. If the word is 
actually misspelled, you can swiftly correct it.

These are only some of the ways Word

your word processing dilemma. Your Quark

tion tools for the Apple III.

time is right around the corner, and Softline, the bimonthly computer games 
magazine, is waiting for you.

they're made. We've got the scoop on Electronic Arts, the game company's game 
company, and their remarkable lineup of programming talent. We'll tell you how to 
win at adventure and fantasy role-playing games, and how to make them yourself. 

Plus all of Softline's usual features and plenty of surprises. Each issue is packed with 
news, reviews, the ever-popular High Scores, the notorious Infomania, and loads 
of contests.

Zoom to Strictly Supportive 

I'd like to sing the praises of two companies I've 
recently had the pleasure of doing business with. 

The first company is Phoenix Software. My 
husband and I bought Zoom Grafix from this 
firm in 1982 and used it frequently. The pro- 
gram was everything we heard it was and did 
everything we hoped it could do. Just two 
months ago we purchased the Apple He as well 
as Apple's Dot Matrix Printer and began a 
search and sort to determine which of our pro- 
grams were compatible. Sadly, Zoom Grafix 
and the printer were not. I called Phoenix Soft- 
ware, and the very first employee to take my call 
was able to solve the problem. By sending one 
dollar and our disk to Phoenix, the disk was up- 
dated and returned to us, all in one week's time. 
Zoom Grafix works perfectly, and I'd like to say 
thanks for the valued-customer treatment I 
received. 

The second company is Strictly Software. 
We've ordered software from this organization 
before and have always been satisfied with its 
products. After purchasing the new computer, 
we ordered Sensible Speller from Strictly Soft- 
ware and eagerly awaited the program's ar- 
rival. Within thirty minutes of delivery we were 
attempting to run the program and stepping 
through the documentation. The main diction- 
ary disk wouldn't copy, wouldn't run, and 
gave us nothing but error messages. A quick call 
to Strictly Software resolved the difficulty. The 
company's representatives were courteous and 
apologetic. I was urged to return the entire 
package for an immediate replacement. 
Approximately a half hour later, another com- 
pany representative called and advised me to 
hang on to the defective copy until the replace- 
ment arrived as insurance against the possi- 
bility of the replacement being defective also. 
The representative also stressed that since part 
of the package was still operational, I could 
continue to use it and not be inconvenienced 
further. The replacement arrived in less than 
two days and works beautifully. 

Thank you. Strictly Software and Phoenix, 
for the assistance you gave me.

Keep Tallying 

M & R Enterprises of Santa Clara, California, 
has just replaced, without charge or question, 
an RF Modulator I had sent to them for re- 
pair. Readers should know of this excellent ac- 
tion taken by M & R to back up its product. 

I wish to encourage readers to write in more 
letters that will help spread the word about 
companies taking the time to give needed cus- 
tomer support after the sale. There are so many 
companies advertising in the microcomputer 
magazines, and so many that come and go 



quickly, that we need this word-of-mouth ad- 
vertising among consumers to help us identify 
the companies that really deserve our continued 
support.

Ttie Good, the Bad, and the Sneaky 

I've been a microcomputer user for eleven 
months and would like to share some of my ex- 
periences with other new users. Here's the good 
and bad. 

Good — A local Apple dealer gave me a very 
good twoity-two-hundred-doUar package in May 
1982, consisting of an Apple II Plus, Disk II 
drive, nine-inch green Zenith monitor, and an 
Apple Writer word processing program. 

Bad — A week later that same dealer brushed 
me off when I asked naive questions about 
some software. Right there, he lost one thou- 
sand dollars in hardware and software pur- 
chases I was prepared to make. 

Good — Reaping the benefits of the dealer's 
brusqueness was East Coast Software, a mail- 
order house in Hershey, Pennsylvania, that has 
reasonable prices and excellent backups, includ- 
ing consultations and refunds. 

Good — The Apple computer itself. Pri- 
marily interested in word processing, I had been 
considering a Xerox, an IBM pc, and a Kay- 
pro. A friend advised me of the Apple's versa- 
tility and support, and that it was more than 
competitive in price to everything except the 
Kaypro. What he failed to add was the fun you 
can have tinkering with the Apple, a factor de- 
nied by the other computers. I'm delighted with 
the Apple. 

Bad — The Applesoft tutorial manual that 
comes with the computer. It isn't badly written 
or hard to understand. It's simply obsolete. An 
anachronism, it instructs the new user on how 
to use tape recorders, hook up the color televi- 
sion, and program color graphics — all of which 
is irrelevant to the standard-profile new user 
who starts out with a disk drive, monochrome 
monitor, and could care less about program- 
ming color graphics. 

Good — The Epson MX-80 printer. 

Unbelievably bad — The manual that came 
with it. The writer (I use the term quite loosely) 
of the manual uses a folksy conversational style 
that approaches the grotesque, while avoiding 
as much factual content as possible. It is almost 
impossible to learn anything about the printer 
beyond how to turn it on. The index is sloppy 
and the hands-on programming tutorial simply 
doesn't work. For the new Apple user this is de- 
pressing. What could you be doing wrong? 
Nothing, because on page 87 you learn that all 
the previous instructions apply only to the TRS- 
80. Don't spend ten dollars to get Epson's 1982 
revised manual. It's by the same author and it's 



almost as bad. 

Sneakily bad — Home Accountant. This best- 
selling program rigidly controls the user, forc- 
ing you to spend a lot of time doing things you 
don't want to do, like filling out budget infor- 
mation demands. There's no freedom. It's like 
being conscripted into the Albanian army. I sus- 
pect the programmer is a former bureaucrat, be- 
cause all you do is fill out form after form after 
form. Furthermore, Continental Software has 
been less than candid with me about glitches in 
the program. Only when pressed did the per- 
sonnel I approached reluctantly concede "se- 
rious errors" in update patches and in the end- 
of-the-year mode, which I simply can't get to 
work. 

Good — Videx Corporation. I use the com- 
pany's eighty-column board and a soft switch. 
The hardware, the manual, and the backup 
couldn't be better. 

Good— The PIE Writer word processing 
program. I'm a magazine reporter who also 
writes books. I use the Apple daily to commu- 
nicate with a Lane SP60(X) in New York, send- 
ing files, articles, and memos. I am writing a 
novel and I use the Apple to write letters such 
as this to Open Discussion. I own, or have used, 
Apple Writer I and //, Magic Window, Word- 
Star, and Format II. For heavy-duty writing, 
none can equal PIE Writer, including Word- 
Star, which is slow, cumbersome, and seems to 
have a lot of problems with what's in the left 
margin. Pie Writer is complex and has a heavy 
load of commands to learn, but it's worth it. 
The manual is excellent, the best I've seen in 
computerdom. 

David Chandler, North Miami, FL 
Of Planes and PIE 

Thank you for the reviews in Softalk of Hay- 
den Book Company's PIE Writer word proc- 
essing system for the Apple II. 

We disagree, though, with your portrayal of 
its ease of use. PIE Writer's manual received the 
only perfect score in Peelings's word processing 
reviews last summer. PIE Writer v/as reviewed 
there as being twice as easy to learn as Word- 
Star, the only other program in PIE Writer's 
class on the Apple II. In comparison to the 
many other, less powerful word processing pro- 
grams, it makes sense that a Lear jet is harder to 
learn to fly than a Piper Cub — it's a faster, 
sleeker, and more powerful plane. Word proc- 
essing courses at the University of California 
Extension and New Jersey's MicroCampus, 
among other schools, use PIE Writer to famil- 
iarize students with the capabilities of word 
processing. MicroCampus teaches PIE Writer 
to kids as young as nine, and to adults as old as 
ninety. PIE Writer's manual includes guides for 
using both the editor and the formatter, and the

PIE Writer package includes an on-screen tu- 
torial. We've sat noncomputer people down 
with nothing but the tutorials in the manual and 
on the screen, and they've consistently learned

begin using it for their own work. We thank 
Softalk for recognizing its power and compre- 
hensiveness, and for mentioning so many of its 
spjecial features.

The Wrong Word for It 

The continuing debate on software piracy has 
prompted me to write. The name "software pi- 
racy" is very odd. When I think of a pirate, I 
don't picture someone hunched over his Apple 



with a knife between his teeth and a patch over 
his eye exclaiming, "Well, me bucko, ar ar; I've 
cracked another un. Now I can sell it and make 
me some booty, ar ar." 

The record industry and the latest groups 
producing video and sound tapes have had a 
word for this in their circles for years. The name 
of these thieves is bootleggers, which is a much 
more apropos name. It has been mentioned that 
in the record and tape industry, as well as in the 
book industry, the attractive packaging and 
relative high quality of the products is what 
causes people to purchase the original and not a 
copy. Several software companies seem to be 
following these concepts and they produce 
beautiful manuals to go with their software.

Bootleggers, however (at least as I infer it from 
the great piracy debate letters in Open Discus- 
sion), will make copies of the software and sell 
them as if they were their own — or worse, as if 
they were original products. If these people are 
the real target of copy protection, then I think 
the whole effort is futile. If I lock my car, it 
won't keep out the guy who really decides that 
he wants to steal it! It will only slow him down. 

If the effort to stop these software thieves is 
futile, then who is suffering? The claim is also 
made that these companies want to keep from 
losing revenue on copyable software. In my ex- 
perience these claims of lost revenue are a bit on 
the flimsy side. There are very few times (that I 
know oO in which someone acquiring copied 
software would ever have purchased the prod- 
uct in the first place. Therefore the friend who 
got a copy of such a program was nevo- a source 
of revenue to lose. 

In the first place I know that I love to solve 
a good puzzle anytime and have delved into the 
inner workings of a number of protected disks. 
Someone with a bit more fortitude than myself 
could easily crack most code schemes available. 
Once again, the car may be locked, but it only 
slows one down a bit. 

Personally, I would be flattered if I wrote a 
good book and lots of folks passed it around 
and had a great time reading it. Although I 
wouldn't have made a penny off their enjoy- 
ment, the next time they saw one of my books 
on the newsstands, they'd buy a copy. I know 
that there are several game companies produc- 
ing more winners than losers, and I would go 
back to them quite often because I've seen their 
goods. At thirty-five dollars a shot for game 
software, I am going to buy only those that are 
any good. 

My conclusion? Don't lock up the software. 
Either lower the price and make it darned good, 
or expect that people such as myself are never 
going to buy from your stock ever again. 
John T. Cox, Houston, TX 

Some Wild and Crazy Ideas 

I am in complete agreement with Jeffery Part- 
ridge and Larry Houston on the subject of copy 
protection (March Open Discussion). Users 
definitely have a legitimate right to a backup 
copy of software they have paid for. I thought 
so when I was only a software consumer, and I 
emphatically think so now that I'm both a con- 
sumer and a publisher. 

The various alternatives to copy protection 
(giving copyable disks to dealers only, allowing 
each copy to make one more copy, supplying 
two copies, and so forth) are either complicated 
or too expensive for a shoestring operation like 
Cheapsuit Software. So I decided it would be 
easiest to keep it simple: all Cheapsuit Software 
products are copyable. Period. Naive, perhaps, 
but I'm willing to experiment with it — especial- 
ly after seeing the obvious successes of compa- 
nies like Beagle Bros that sell no copy-pro- 
tected software. 

Speaking of naivete, Jeffery Partridge's re- 
mark that "dealers do not get free copies to 
demonstrate" made me wonder just how naive I

TURN AN EPSON 
INTO A DAISY . . . 

with the SUPER-MX CARD 

for the APPLE II or APPLE lie. 

The standard of printing excellence is the 
daisy-wheel printer. The SUPER-MX 
card provides the Epson printers with just 
about the same quality print as the daisy- 
wheels! And these fonts can be accessed 
by all software, even copy-protected 
diskettes. 

SUPER-MX Roman font is 
the standard. 
Epsons can now print Elite 
with the SUPER-MX card. 

Other optional font styles are available 
in addition to the standard Roman font 
that just plug into the extra sockets 
provided. They come in pairs so you can 
add a total of four extra fonts. Orator 
Large comes with Letter Gothic. Script 
comes with Olde English. 

LETTER GOTHIC is 
modern looking. 
ORATOR is easy to read 
and good for speeches. 
SCRIPT aofcC6 iiKe 
peru>cmaJL JtoucK. 
CDCOE £N©C3/Sa is very 
farmal and plpgant . 

BETTER THAN GRAPPLER! 

The Super-MX card has all the Apple 
Hi-Res graphic dump commands that 
the Grappler card has including: double 
dumps {both pages side by side), dump 
from page 1 or 2, double size, empha- 
sized, rotated, strip chart recorder mode, 
and text screen dump. 

The two expansion sockets allow 
EPROM expansion to 12K to insure you 
that the SUPER-MX card will remain the 
most intelligent interface around. 

MX-100 needs Graftrax-Plus. MX-80 
needs Graftrax or Graftrax-Plus. FX-80 
works as is. 90 day warranty.

am. See, I'm new in this business, and I foolish- 
ly thought that the good will of a dealer was 
worth much more than the cost of a disk and a 
manual. But now that I've had my eyes opened, 
I think I'll still keep my original demo policy, 
which is that dealer demos of Cheapsuit Soft- 
ware products are free. This policy makes sense 
to me, having heard a lot of talk about how 
dealers are the backbone of this industry. If this 
policy makes major software houses look rude 
by comparison, so be it. They may have to treat 
dealers better if enough wild and crazy upstarts 
set an example. 

As a consumer too, I want to take this op- 
portunity to say something about my dealer, 
Jeanette Merrill. She's the kind of dealer that 
makes it a lot easier to own an Apple. When- 
ever I have a service problem — I've had sever- 
al — she's there. And she never even laughs 
when I say that I pulled out a peripheral card 
with the power on. She never complains when I 
call at totally crazy times to scream for help. She 
shows up on my doorstep with her personal Ap- 
ple (it answers to the name Genghis Khan), and 
though she is obviously dressed to go out danc- 
ing she takes time to look for some obscure, in- 
termittent problem that no one will ever find — 
for free! And when she doesn't find the prob- 
lem, she loans me Genghis so I'll be able to keep 
working while my Apple is in the shop. She is 
wonderful.

Explosive Reactions 

Open Discussion is the first section I turn to 
when I open a new issue of Softalk. I'm always 
interested in the various discussions and vary- 
ing points of view expressed there. However, the 
editorial comments of Robert Marlowe in the 
April issue not only interested but disturbed and 
irritated me. In fact, while I intend to address 
several of the points that he brought up in his 
letter, I don't think Softalk is the proper place 
for discussions of this nature, even when thinly 
veiled under the guise of software criticism, as 
his was. 

Mr. Marlowe expressed his concern that 
certain war simulation games "convey (or per- 
petuate) misunderstandings of the present 
East/ West stand-off that are not only false but 
also highly dangerous," then proceeded to ex- 
pound at some length on his own understand- 
ings of this complex and highly volatile politi- 
cal situation. Aside from the obvious questions 
raised simply by the reasoning behind the in- 
clusion of this correspondence, there remains 
the necessity of some kind of balanced re- 
sponse to the incredible assumptions made, and 
conclusions reached, by Mr. Marlowe. I'd like 
to attempt just such a response. 

Mr. Marlowe (an expatriate by his own ad- 
mission) b^ins his diatribe by stating his view 
of the current public understanding of So- 
viet/American relations as if it were undeniable 
fact. I hardly accept the ridiculous notion that 
the American public holds the opinion that the 
"Soviet Union is the embodiment of everything 
evil, and thus of everything un-American." 



JUNE 1983 



However, I do believe that the American public 
can and does recognize a well-defined threat 
when it exists, and that the American people are 
capable of acting for the good of their own en- 
lightened self-interest in the face of such a 
threat. 

I will accept Mr. Marlowe's premise that 
peaceful trade with Western Europe is much to 
the advantage of the Soviet Union (where else is 
it going to obtain the technology that so far it 
has been incapable of developing?) and will 
leave moot the question of just what the advan- 
tages to Western Europe might be. I cannot ac- 
cept the contention that recent administrations 
and the Pentagon have fostered the idea that a 
Soviet invasion of Western Europe would be 
impending in the absence of an adequate 
NATO (nuclear) defense against such a move. 
The thrust of current administration policies re- 
garding the prospect of nuclear war in Europe is 
based not on what the Soviets might do in 
Western Europe tomorrow, but on what the So- 
viets have done consistently and historically 
when faced with opportunities for expansion, 
whether in the interest of territory, military 
leverage, or political advantage. What it's done 
is to reach for whatever gain it could obtain and 
hold. Here we might pause for a calling of the 
roll: Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, 
Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Poland, 
Hungary, East Germany, Cuba, Angola, Viet- 
nam, and so forth. 

Next, Mr. Marlowe moves on to a discus- 
sion of various defensive strategies (or lack 
thereoO based again on his own point of view. 
Actually, the reason America lacks an ABM 
system is not for want of money, or because 
such a system wouldn't provide an adequate de- 
fense, but because the American government is 
party to an international agreement, SALT I, 
which prohibits the deployment of such sys- 
tems. Of course, the Soviet Union is also a 
signatory to this agreement, and allows (in- 
deed, even encourages) frequent neutral third- 
party inspections for the purpose of verification 
of its adherence to the agreement. 

On another point, I feel I must remind Mr. 
Marlowe that the United States' position on the 
first use of nuclear weapons does not constitute 
the "cornerstone" of NATO's European de- 
fense strategy. That position is as follows: 
NATO will use nuclear weapons in the defense 
of Western Europe only in the instance of a So- 
viet invasion, whether by conventional or nu- 
clear means, when it has been determined that 
all conventional means of repelling the invad- 
ing forces have been exhausted. Of course the 
Soviets have repeatedly and publicly renounced 
the first use of nuclear weapons! What a pub- 
lic-relations coup! While the Soviets concen- 
trate on building their conventional arsenal in 
Europe to hitherto unheard-of levels, the West- 
ern press, and misguided individuals such as 
Robert Marlowe, will effectively straitjacket 
NATO defense strategies so as to allow the So- 
viets to eventually apply the political leverage 
their huge conventional arms superiority gives 
them. Remove the balancing leverage of the 
Western powers' nuclear capability and the So- 



JUNE 1983

viets enjoy the advantage they so ardently seek. 

Finally, Mr. Marlowe's cheap and flippant 
bandying about of the statistics representing the 
pain and anguish of the Holocaust is beneath 
contempt. I ask how such a correspondent can 
dare mention the term "moral responsibility." I 
believe that he abandoned moral responsibility 
just as he abandoned his former homeland, and 
the principles and ideals that it stands for. 

This discussion has nothing to do with soft- 
ware. I hope that in the future I can expect to 
find mention of these subjects in the editorial 
section of my newspaper, not in the pages of 
Softalk. 

Charles T. Morrow, Herndon, VA 

I was going to voice my opinion on copy pro- 
tection, but when I read Robert Marlowe's criti- 
cism of games like Norad and Germany 1985, I 
changed my mind. I think Mr. Marlowe misses 
an important point A game is only a game. I 
don't think that SSI or SDS supports a conflict 
between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. The pub- 
lishers simply took an interesting scenario and 
adapted it to a game format. There's nothing 
flippant about this. 

As to the idea that games create and con- 
tribute to the misunderstanding between the 
two superpowers, I think that that idea is ab- 
surd. I have a copy of Norad and think it's great 
fun (so does my little sister). I don't think A^o 
rad is any more guilty of creating misunder- 
standing and misinformation than the other 
Missile Comnumd-type games. In fact, Norad is 
almost like these games except that it's super- 
imposed on a map of the U.S. (I suppose if it 
were a map of Botswana, Mr. Marlowe 
wouldn't complain.) I know the U.S. doesn't 
have an ABM system. Also, I don't believe a 
nuclear war can be won, and I pray that one will 
never occur. I also think many other people 
who have played Norad feel the same way. 

I'm not familiar with Germany 1985, but I 
believe the same principle applies here. The 
game takes you into its own microcosm and 
places you in a situation that probably couldn't 
occur in real life. I don't think that after play- 
ing Germany 1985, or any similar game, a play- 
er would develop a hatred toward the Rus- 
sians (toward the computer, maybe) or devel- 
op any misunderstandings about the Russians. 
A person's convictions and opinions are formed 
and changed in real life, not by playing a game. 
Playing games like Germany 1985 doesn't cre- 
ate any more hatred, fear, or misunderstanding 
of the Russians than other games (like Super In- 
vaders and Repton) create toward aliens. 

Mr. Marlowe should stop criticizing the 
software publishers, who, like the film, book, 
and television industries, are doing a service by 
creating a temporary means of escape from the 
hectic world. Instead, he should criticize the 
governments involved. 
Frank Hsu, Ann Arbor, MI 

The last person I need to explain present-day 
U.S./U.S.S.R. relations is Robert Marlowe. 
How dare he bring his political propaganda in- 
to the field of computer software, more ex- 



plicitly entertainment software. Does he really 
think the majority (or even a substantial mi- 
nority) of American people plan to buy Norad 
or Germany 1985 and say, "Gee, since this is on 
a disk it must be the truth." Marlowe must sit in 
his room, into the wee hours of the night, look- 
ing in every publication for things that in his dis- 
torted mind promote nuclear war or its feasi- 
bility. Who made him an East /West-relations 
expert that understands any more or less the 
"nature and degree of the Soviet threat to the 
West"? Is his sense of reality so weak that he ac- 
tually believes this software could change peo- 
ple's feelings about such an important issue as 
the deterrence of nuclear war? 

Maybe he'd like to ban Space Invaders since 



this would foster bad relations with any future 
aliens that might visit the earth. Where does his 
sense of fantasy end and reality begin?

Fan^s Admonition 

As an avid reader of Softalk since last Novem- 
ber's San Francisco Applefest, I'd like to com- 
mence my letter with a few positive comments, 
since the remainder of this letter is largely nega- 
tive. I fully enjoy all of Softalk's columns, 
especially DOStalk and Graphically Speaking. 
However, when I received the April issue, I was 
shocked and dismayed at a poorly written piece 
on computer music in Newspeak titled "And 
on the Computer-Music Scene" (page 272).

Whereas Softalk is, after all, a magazine 
catering specifically to Apples, the coverage of 
computer-oriented music is a foreseeable by- 
product. However, that does not give Softalk a 
license to attack any piece of music vaguely hav- 
ing to do with technology. 

The section of the review having to do with 
Neil Young's Trans is definitely appropriate. 
Young has shown the public his diverse talents 
and some of the various effects possible with 
computer-assisted, synthesized music. 

However, the inclusion of a criticism of 
Styx's Kilroy Was Here is hardly justifiable. 
Styx has been using synthesizers as long as I've 
heard the band — at least six years. If the re- 
viewer wished to criticize Styx for its use of elec- 
tronic keyboards, he should have started with 
The Grand Illusion or with Equinox. Also, if the 
use of synthesizers (computer music?) was the 
criterion, why wasn't Thomas Dolby's She 
Blinded Me with Science or the Human 
League's Dare included? 

The message of Kilroy Was Here, errone- 
ously stated by the reviewer as "rock 'n' roll's 
ability to save mankind from technototalitar- 
ianism," can be seen, by any "adolescent space 
cadet" who has taken the time and gone out of 
his way to read the inside of the album jacket, as 
a cry against censorship and a plea to keep 
church and state separate. Perhaps the reviewer 
considers computer music to be synonymous 
with anything with a futuristic theme that has 
synthesizers in it. 

Regarding the heralding of "beer-and- 
broads technorock being brought to the 
eighties," I'm afraid the reviewer has neglected 
his homework. Styx's Paradise Theatre (1981) 
contains as much synthesizer/keyboard as Kil- 
roy. Did the reviewer miss that release, or did he 
start counting the eighties later than the rest 
of us? 

Whereas I enjoy comparative reviews of re- 
cent album releases, Softalk is not what I turn 
to for such. However, if Softalk feels it must 
burden its readership with such escapades, at 
the very least it can make sure such a review is 
free from contradiction. The Newspeak article 
praises Young for using synthesizers and vo- 
coders, yet condemns Styx for the use of these 
same instruments. As a result, the article con- 
tradicts itself and comes across as a self-right- 
eous, juvenile expression of the reviewer's per- 
sonal biases — instead of a carefully balanced, 
point-by-point comparison, as a good review 
should be. The choice of words holding nega- 
tive connotations to describe Styx's effort is 
seen by this reader as the failure of the reviewer 
to rely on any source except personal prejudice 
and his lack of concrete arguments, condemn- 
ing Kilroy as "bombastic crud." 

One gets the impression from reading this 
review that the reviewer has a bleak, pessimistic 
outlook on the future and patronizes the album 
that supports his views. The optimistic "good- 
versus-evil, good triumphs-in-the-end" concept 
of Kilroy Was Here is rejected in favor of the 
Orwellian Trans. I think that in the future Sof- 
talk would be well advised to keep its pages de- 
voted to Apples and their applications (the in-

We added another head 
so you won't have to buy another disk. 

That's the beauty of a double sided head. A 
floppy disk which allows you to read and write on 
both sides. For more storage, for more information, 

for keeping larger records, 
and for improved perfor- 
mance of your system. 
That's what our new Elite 
Two and Elite Three offers. 
It's the first double headed 
Apple® compatible disk 
drive in the industry. And of 
course, the technology is 
from Rana. We're the com- 
pany who gave you 163K 
bytes of storage with our Elite One, a 14% increase 
over Apple's. And now with our high tech double 
sided heads, our Elite Two and Three offers you two 
to four times more storage than Apple's. That's 
really taking a byte out of the competition. 

We put our heads together 
to give you a superior disii drive. 

We designed the Elite Three to give you near 
hard disk capacity with all the advantages of a 
minifloppy system. The double sided head oper- 
ates on 80 tracks per side, giving you a capacity of 
652K bytes. It would take 4V2 Apples to give you 
that. And cost you three times our Elite Three's 
reasonable $849 pricetag. 



Rana's double sided heads give Apple 
II superior disk performance power 
than second generation personal com- 
puters such as IBM s 



It takes 4'/2 Apples to equal the capacity 
of our superior Elite Three 










n 















pWfjjjpPII 













The Elite Two offers an impressive 326K bytes 
and 40 tracks on each side. This drive is making a 
real hit with users who need extra storage, but 
don't require top-of-the-line capacity Costwise, it 
takes 2V2 Apple drives to equal the performance of 
our Elite Two. And twice as many diskettes. Leave it 
to Rana to produce the most cost efficient disk 
drive in the world. 

We've always had the guts to be a leader. 

Our double sided head may be an industry 
first for Apple computers, but nobody was surprised. 




They've come to expect it from us. Because Rana 
has always been a leader We were the first 
with a write protect feature, increased capacity 




Your word processor stores 5 times as many pages of text on an Elite Three 
diskette as the cost ineffective Apple 

and accurate head positioning. A first with attrac- 
tive styling, faster access time, and the conve- 
nience of storing a lot more pages on far fewer 
diskettes. We were first to bring high technology to 
a higher level of quality 

So ask for an Elite One, Two, or Three. 
Because when it comes to disk drives, nobody 
uses their head like Rana.

mo EVER DREAMED 
HOMEWORK COULD BE FUN? 




MILTON BRADLEY DID! 

(and you should too!) 

Imagine homework being so much 
fun that children actually look forward 
to doing it! 

That's exactly what's happening in 
families that are experiencing the joy 
of learning with Milton Bradley 
Educational Software. 

Just watch as your children give 
their undivided attention to the 
unique chalkboard screen in the 
All About Division software pro- 
gram, which teaches everything 
there is to know about one- and two- 
digit divisors, whole numbers, 
fractional and decimal remainders, 
too! 

And what could be more fun than 
learning how to use commas with the 
amazing Milton Bradley Comma 
Cannon, included in the All About 



Commas educational software 
program. Just aim at where you think 
the comma should go and press the 
Fire Button. The computer will tell 
you if you've made the right choice. 

And there's MORE! All About 
Building Sentences, All About What 
You Read, All About Words, and 
All About Fractions. 

ALL of them fun — ALL of them 
educational. And ALL made by 
Milton Bradley, a name that for 
decades has meant quality, 
dependability, and service. 

Teachers and computer in- 
structors all across the country have 
praised Milton Bradley Edu- 
cational Softwarefor its simplicity, 
flexibility, and ability to combine 



FUN with the learning of basic 
skills. 

Milton Bradley Educational 
Software is compatible with another

Even Bugs Can Teach 

David Durkee's SoftGraph was outstanding. My 
thanks for a useful, as well as educational, pro- 
gram. The Pie Chart and Bar/ Line Graph Chart 
programs have already been put to work help- 
ing analyze data in my MBA studies at Mis- 
sissippi State University. 

Typing is not my area of expertise, and no 
matter how careful I attempt to be, it's guar- 
anteed I'll have typos to debug before any pro- 
gram that I enter will run. However, I have 
found this to be where the learning process 
occurs. Tracing the code through the program 
with the help of Durkee's explanations pro- 
vided the insight into what makes this program 
tick. I did find a bug that I'd like to pass on to 
others who may not have found it. Line 55 for

Just Skip It 

I am writing in response to Peter T. Clark, who 
wrote in the April Softalk about modifications 
he would like to see made. First of all, about the 
telecommunications section, I personally don't 
have any telecommunication devices for my 
Apple, but I think this column is fantastic for 
those who do; for those who don't it provides a 
source of enlightenment. I agree that advertise- 
ment cards should be used. However, as to the 
limit of three to a customer, this seems a little 
restrictive. Six or seven may be a better num- 
ber. Marketalk Reviews provides a service for 
everyone and should not, in my opinion, be cut 
short. Softalk's done a superb job so far; keep 
up the good work. 

Now we come to Peter Clark's and my ma- 
jor point of disagreement. He hates the Story- 
talk Fiction section, and finds it "dull and 
boring." My message to you, Mr. Clark, is that 
if you don't like it, don't read it! You can even 
tear out the section if you find it so offensive, 
but don't try to ruin it for the people out there 
(myself included) who enjoy some fiction after 
reading the rest of SoftaM I happen to love the 
computer fiction stories and so do most of my 
friends that subscribe to Softalk. Why should 
we sit back and let you try to take it away from 
us? 

Bear Braumoeller, Orinda, CA 
Murphy's Probability 

First, I would like to comment on Paul Wil- 
son's apparent problem with Wabash disks. It 
seems to me rather incredible that three disks in 
a row would have intermittent I/O problems. In 
the past I have experienced similar problems 
and they have always been traced to a disk drive 
or controller. I have over two hundred disks in 
my library (using both sides), and in five years 
I've had only two media failures (both on the 
front side of the disk, I might add). I have over 



fifty Wabash disks in use and I rate them 
among the best. If your problem truly was due 
to the disks, I would contact the manufacturer. 
Most disk manufacturers will stand behind their 
products rather than suffer the lost sales that 
can be caused by disgruntled users. 

Secondly, I would like to comment on Ed- 
win Winter's glowing appreciation of Diversi- 
DOS. I have had the opportunity of using this 
product and must agree that the speed im- 
provements are dramatic. I would just like to 
warn users of Diversi-DOS and other DOS 
speedup packages that one of the things done to 
achieve these speed improvements is the elimi- 
nation of "verify after write" when writing to 
the disk. Diversi-DOS has instructions on how 
to reenable this feature, and, although it de- 
grades performance a little, it is well worth it. 
The floppy disk and floppy disk drive are hard- 
ly perfect. Most (if not all) disk operating sys- 
tems contain logic to verify that whatever you 
wanted to write was actually written, and they 
do it for good reason. The original designers of 
Apple DOS didn't put that logic in just to make 
it run slowly; even hard disk systems perform 
write verification. One of Murphy's Laws states 
that if anything can go wrong, it will. Running a 
disk system without write verification just in- 
creases the probability of Murphy being right. 
Dick Rettke, Appleton, WI 

User Groups — A Healthy Association 

In answer to Guillermo Geisse's letter in April's 
Open Discussion, although there may not be 
commercial software that will exactly meet his 
needs, I suggest that he contact one of the three 
Saint Louis area Apple user groups. The soft- 
ware he wishes may be designed by one of the 
local programmers at a reasonable cost. In fact, 
the magazine of the user group I belong to is 
currently publishing a serialized version of a 
program, with the code and explanation of its 
construction, that does exactly the kind of 
scheduling he desires for three radiologists. It is 
titled Call Schedule and is being published by 
the MSB magazine. This is the combined maga- 
zine and newsletter from all three user groups in 
the area (Applejacks, Disk Drivers, and Person- 
al Computer Club). One can get a copy from a 
local computer store or obtain copies free as a 
member of any of these groups. From looking 
at the article, a user may be able to modify the 
program's code to fit his particular needs. The 
reason I know about this is because I wrote the 
article. 

I could easily have called Dr. Geisse and 
told him this, but I believe a plug should be 
made for local user groups. These are groups of 
Apple owners who get together to learn more 
about their machines. They don't sell hardware 
or software, and they exist for the betterment, 
education, and edification of their members. A 
strong user group can be a real boon to its 
members. 

I would call for physicians in the Saint Louis 
area to get together, join a local user group, and 
form a medical special-interest group to ex- 
change ideas and knowledge regarding pro- 
grams in the medical field. Any or all of the 



Saint Louis-area computer user groups would 
welcome this. The dues for such groups are 
minuscule compared to what physicians pay for 
the A.M.A. and other specialty societies.

Eureka! 

Since my letter entitled "Serendipity" appeared 
in the April issue, I have discovered still an 
easier way to access the printer commands for 
my Epson MX-80 F /T printer via A pple Writer II. 

When entering terms for the glossary, press 
escape twice and the flashing [ (the escape 
command symbol) appears as part of your 
term, making it possible to set up all the printer 
escape commands you'll need in the glossary. 

For example, I frequently use the empha- 
sized mode and italics, and I enter these com- 
mands into my glossary with the following com- 
mand strings: 

[G]?e<ESC><ESC> <ESC> E<RETURN> 
(escape "E") 

[G]?4<ESC><ESC>4<RETURN > (escape 
"4") 

[G]?5<ESC><ESC>5<RETURN > (escape 
"5") 

The reason three escapes are needed for es- 
cape-E is that lettered commands must be in up- 
per case. None of these commands take up 
spaces during printing, and any may be placed 
within your text. Note also that my defining 
symbols are the same as the escape commands 
to make it easier to remember how each is de- 
fined in the glossary. You may also enter all the 
printer commands you'll ever use and save the 
glossary to a disk; check page 44 of your A pple 
Writer II manual. 

I plan on purchasing a new Apple He and 
Apple Writer He, and I hope that I'll still be able 
to access my printer commands just as easily. 
Charies Miller, Cambridge, MA 

I have read a lot about how one can control the 
print modes of the Epson MX-80 printer 
through the Apple Writer II word processing 
program. I have been amazed at the complexi- 
ty of the methods. I have found it to be fairly 
straightforward. Obviously, pressing escape while 
entering text will either capitalize the next letter 
or, if pressed twice, will enter the editing mode. 
However, both the glossary (control-G) and 
find (Control-F) will allow you to send an es- 
cape to the printer. 

To use control-G, first define a key to rep- 
resent the escape key. For example, if you want- 
ed the / key to represent the escape key, press 
control-G then ? to enter the definition. Press 
the / key, then the escape key twice. A flashing [ 
will appear to represent the escape key. Now 
every time control-G followed by the / key is 
pressed while entering text, the flashing [ will 
appear. 

To use the control-F method, choose a key 
such as * to represent the escape key. To switch 
the printer to emphasized mode, you would 
type *£. Then use control-F to replace the star 
with escape. You can get the escape key in this 
mode again by pressing escape twice, and the 



44 



JUNE 1983 



flashing [ will appear. After replacement, all of 
the *s will become flashing [s. 

I find Apple Writer to be a handy and 
useful program. The ability to send signals to 
the printer makes the printed material much 
more attractive. 
Tim Anderson, Logan, UT 

A "True" Pirate Speaks 

I am a software pirate and a good one at that. I 
am not, however, 100 percent pro software pi- 
racy. I will copy games for myself and my 
friends, but I refuse to sell any software not 
written by myself. 

I would first of all like to clear up some 
myths about software piracy. Some people have 
the idea that the average software pirate copies 
software for profit. Most of the pirates I know, 
and I know most of the best in the Bay Area, 
copy software they don't have the money to 
buy, or that aren't worth the disks they 
come on. 

There are two main reasons that I copy soft- 
ware: The first is to whet my appetite for games. 
I love all games, and I want much more than I 
could legally afford. The second reason is to re- 
duce the number of disks required to keep these 
games. 

In relation to the second reason, let me ex- 
plain that a software pirate is not one who 
wastes time on nibble copiers such as Lock- 
smith. Locksmith does not bypass the copy pro- 
tection and does not require any brains to use. I 
break games. I attempt to eliminate the protec- 



tion on a game at least far enough to copy it 
with Copy A. Anyone who has never removed 
the copy protection from a game is not, in my 
opinion, a true software pirate. 

As to Richard Ekblaw's letter in April Open 
Discussion, let me say that there will never be a 
software protection method that can not be 
broken. Anything coded by man can be de- 
coded by man. 

Also, there is no way that a printer card or 
any other card will ever be mistaken for a wild- 
card. They do entirely different things, and 
therefore require an entirely different machine 
language routine on the card to operate. It is 
this routine that is checked to see if a wildcard- 
type device is present. Regarding your problem 
with the encoder board, why didn't you contact 
the manufacturer when you first noticed the 
problem? 

To Dan Kunesh; Did you know that the bit 
patterns on the hi-res screen of the Apple II run 
backward? That is, the bits are numbered left to 
right instead of right to left. This means that a 
bit pattern of 01 101000 on the screen is stored 
as 22 ($16) rather than 104 ($68). Try convert- 
ing your numbers to binary, reversing the bit 
patterns, and converfing them back. I think 
you'll find that your character set is now facing 
the correct direction. 

As a programmer, I was a little surprised 
that there wasn't a footnote like the following 
after Charles Miller's letter titled "Serendipity" in 
the April Open Discussion: The flashing [ char- 
acter is explained by nofing that 27, the ASCII

Stamps and Everything Else 

I think a fellow Softalk reader might be able to 
help me with a problem I'm having with a pro- 
gram. This program will help me to catalog all 
of my stamps, or anything else. It is in eighty- 
column, and I need to use text files to keep the 
stamps "in." I cannot seem to use DOS, which 
runs in forty-column. (It's a Videx Videoterm 
board.) There must be some way to use DOS in 
eighty-column because eighty-column is what 
most word processors use. Do I need to switch 
back and forth between eighty and forty-col- 
umn when working with the text files? The rea- 
son I want it in eighty-column is so I can dis- 
play most or all of the file on one screen. Can 
anyone help me? 

I love Open Discussion, but I am getting a 
little tired of hearing something about Frogger 
every month. Yes, I do have Frogger. It isn't 
exactly a graphics breakthrough, but it is a very 
playable game. The only thing I think they 
screwed up on is the sound. But Apple sound is 
a little screwed up itself, so what should we 
expect? It is nowhere near as good as the Atari's 
version. Since I don't have an Atari 400 or 800, 
it doesn't bother me a bit. If the people who are 
speaking out against Frogger don't like it, why 
don't they all get together and make a version 
so good nobody can complain. I'd be willing to 
buy it if it were as good as they want Sierra On- 
Line's version to be. 

Bravo Richard Ekblaw, you couldn't be any 
more right on software protection. If someday 
they make an uncopyable protection code, the 
next day it will be a copyable software code. 
Penguin Software has the right idea. Its new 
prices of $19.95 are about what any game is 
worth, with the exception of Time Zone. I think 
one of the main reasons Penguin is able to give 
a reasonable price on its games is because it has 
given up on spending the money on software 
protection. I intend to purchase one of its pro- 
grams in the near future. 

To Alan Gallatin: I tried the same thing 
but put the disk controller in slot 7. It still did 
the same thing. Why? Who knows? And by the 
way, where is Oceanside? I spend a lot of time in 
New York around the Braircliff, Tarrytown, 
part of Westchester County. I am also fourteen 
years old.

CAN BE 

HARD WORK 






IT'S 



We all know 
it's got to be 
done. A new 
address for a 

company you deal with means 
changing the records right away 
A client gets married and 
changes her name. Another 

change that has to be made in the records. If you're 
faced with several filing cabinets filled with folders, 
making simple changes becomes a compHcated, time 
consuming job. And if your mailing list is generated 
from those records, or if you rely on them for billing 
information, you'd better make those changes quick. 

Relax, DB MASTER makes updating records quick 
and easy. All you've got to do is call up the name of 
the company or client on the view screen. It takes 
about three seconds. When the record appears, make 
the appropriate changes right then. It's over and done 
with. Immediately. No retyping of an entire record. No 
anxiety. And as soon as you've made the change, say, 
from "Colleen Patterson" to "Colleen Smith," DB 
MASTER refiles it under the new name in the proper 
sequence. It's all over in less time than it takes you to 
walk over to the filing cabinet. 

And it's easy to correct, change or edit any part of a 
record. Imagine the time savings when you're 
constantly updating inventory or job records. 

We designed DB MASTER to make your life easier. 
Sure, there are other data base systems for your Apple 
II. But if you're not using DB MASTER you're simply

DB MASTER provides it with 
the expanded-capacity Special

And there are three powerful accessory programs. 
UTILITY PAK #1, for example, allows you to access 
other standard Apple files (including VisiCalc), and 
even change the way you've structured your files. 
UTILITY PAK #2 allows you to edit or change up to 
five "fields" in a single pass through your files. And 
STAT PAK performs statistical analyses on data in 
your DB MASTER files. Of course, there's 
considerably more capability in each of our accessory 
paks than we have room to talk about here. Ask your 
dealer for the full details.

The reason why this program will boot the disk 
in slot 6, instead of hanging, is that when Basic 
interprets a PR# or IN# command, it merely 
sets the input/output hooks on the zero page to 
$C/300 (where n is the slot number specified). 
When the computer next attempts to output 
(or input, if you're using IN#) a character, con- 
trol will be turned over to the program residing 
on the peripheral card in the specified slot. Note 
that a request for a character to be input or out- 
put is what activates the card, not the PR# or 
IN# command. 

Smce the program does not input or 
output any characters, nothing happens until 
the program terminates. At that time, Basic 
prints a prompt and requests input. This acti- 
vates the card whose address has been last 
placed in the I /O hooks by the program. In this 
case, this is card #6, hence the disk in slot 6 
boots. Using the same logic, it is clear that 
changing PR#A to IN#A does not change the 
situation. Printing during each loop when using 
IN#A still does not activate the slot you're ad- 
dressing, but if you use PR#A, it will activate 
it and the system will hang at the first unoc- 
cupied slot. 

For teacher Rodney D. Hixon of Fair- 
banks, Alaska, who is avoiding Pascal because 
of the hardware expense, I would suggest that 
he look into Lazer Pascal from Lazer Micro- 
systems, Riverside, California. This is an ex- 
tended version of Tiny Pascal that has been ex- 
tended in the direction of the C programming 
language. It will operate with one disk drive and 
48K of memory, although you must reload the 
compiler if you have used any other programs 
between compilations. Documentation is satis- 
factory if you are already familiar with Pascal. I 
would highly recommend investing in either the 
Videx Keyboard Enhancer or the Lazer Key- 
board Plus, since Pascal is really intended for an 
environment that supports both upper and low- 
er case. This upgrade is not, however, absolute- 
ly necessary. Lazer Pascal is set up to run un- 
der the ANIX operating system but is compati- 
ble with DOS. ANIX comes with the system, 
but it is available with complete documentation 
and extensive disk utility programs for a mod- 
erate cost. 

I have used this system to create a medical 
office management and billing system and can 
recommend it as a cost-conscious alternative to 
Apple Pascal. Its main limitations are that it 
does not support floating-point numbers and is 
limited to one-dimensional arrays. Its files, 
however, are completely DOS-compatible, and 
the operating system is very advanced. The ba- 
sic system comes with editor, compiler, p-code 
interpreter, p-code disassembler, program li- 
brary and example programs, Lisa source code 
for compiler and interpreter, and a manual. 

With regard to textbooks, I suggest that 
anyone who's looking for them come to San 
Francisco and visit Stacy's bookstore on Mar- 
ket Street. It has one of the largest stocks of 
computer texts, including Apple-specific books, 
west of the Mississippi. 

I recently added an Apple He to my office 
and would like to comment on some compati- 



bility problems. Locksmith 4.1 will not function 
on the He because it crashes when it reaches an 
error in reading or writing. Pascal 1.1 is non- 
functional because its boot procedure requires a 
press of the reset key, which functions differ- 
ently on the He. (As opposed to the II's proto- 
col, which would leave you with the memory 
card connected, the He puts you back under 
ROM control. This was intended probably as a 
piracy-prevention device.) Apple has a Pascal 
update in the works. The eighty-column board 
does not work with Merlin, but there is an up- 
date available. Apple Writer II does not recog- 
nize the eighty-column board. Screenwriter II 
does not recognize the keyboard correctly — but 
there's a He-compatible version in beta testing. 
VisiCalc is okay; Lazer Pascal is compatible but 
does not use the eighty-column board. All my 
games and adventures work correctly. 

Everyone should be aware that the new Sys- 
tem Master disk not only includes the DOS 3.3e 
mentioned in April's DOStalk but also in- 
cludes a much improved hello program that 
fast-loads the language card in less than five sec- 
onds. This program is compatible with the II 
and II Plus and is worth the trouble of 
obtaining. 

Apple is trying to standardize the user in- 
terface for all user programs. To this end Apple 
has made available a set of Applesoft routines 
for menu creation, input, output, and comput- 
er identification. These routines can be used to 
make programs that are compatible with all 
three Apples but can still make use of the new 
features of the He. The routines are provided 
with the new Applesoft tutorial manual. I 
would recommend that anyone interested in 
wridng commercial programs get hold of these 
routines and use them. Apple has also written a 
manual of Apple software standards that is 
available free through any Apple dealer.

Help off the Shelf 

I just received my copy of So/talk this morning 
and would like to respond to Jim Rebeck, the 
gentleman in Open Discussion who'd like in- 
formation on Pascal. 

I am currently studying Pascal at San Diego 
State University. The text they use is superb! It 
is designed around standard Pascal and should 
present no problems in transfer to Apple Pascal. 
The book is Oh! Pascal!, by Doug Cooper and 
Michael Clancy, published by W. W. Norton, 
500 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10110. The 
book should be available through university 
bookstores. I can't say enough about this book 
and its ability to provide insight into functional 
problem-solving in Pascal. 
Michael Simonds, National City, CA 

In the April Open Discussion Jim Rebeck asked 
for suggestions on books for Apple Pascal. As a 
fellow novice to both microcomputers and 
Apple Pascal, I have all too often found that my 
questions could not be answered by the sup- 
plied manuals. I thought I was alone unfil I 
spoke with many of my friends who also think 
the supplied manuals leave much to be desired.

JUNE 1983 



On the suggestion of a friend, I purchased a 
book entitled Apple Pascal: A Hatuh-On Ap- 
proach by Arthur Luehrmann and Herbert 
Pedcham. This volume has proven to be a most 
valuable source book for learning both the lan- 
guage itself as well as the peculiarities of the 
Apple Pascal system. My wife and I are now en- 
rolled in a Pascal programming course at the 
local college, and after spending many frustrat- 
ing hours with the recommended text, we have 
opted to use the far superior book by Luehr- 
mann and Peckham. Of all the various docu- 
mentations I have read, this volume is the best 
by far. I highly recommend it for all beginning 
Apple Pascal users. 

Another excellent source of information on 
Apple Pascal is the column by Jim Merritt in 
Softalk. The problem with this is that I began 
reading Softalk only a few months back and 
thus have read the Pascal Path from about part 
eighteen on. Maybe if enough of us complain, 
we can get Softalk to publish a collection of 
these articles in one volume, which would be a 
great supplement to our libraries. 

In a slightly different vein, I have a question 
I would like to pose to all Softalk readers (and I 
hope the people at Apple Computer have their 
ears on for this one): Does anyone know where, 
in either of the supplied Apple Pascal manuals, 
we are told how to route output to a printer and 
then return control of the system to the con- 
sole? If this knowledge is given in either man- 
ual, it must be written in machine language, for 
I've searched high and low but to no avail. Ap- 
parently this sort of information is to be passed 
along verbally. 

The solution: Immediately preceding the 
portion of the program that will route output to 
the printer, the following two lines must be 
inserted 

Close (Output); 

Rewrite (Output, 'Printer:'); 

Immediately following that block of printer out- 
put, the following two lines must be inserted to 
return control of the system to the console: 

Close (Output); 

Rewrite (Output, 'Console:'); 

It's amazing that something that seems so vital 
as routing output to a printer has been ignored 
in the Apple Pascal manuals, and I hope that 
newer versions will include these simple in- 
structions. As a matter of fact, maybe Apple 
could arrange to include the Luehrmann and 
Peckham book as part of the Apple Pascal 
system ! 

Kenneth Buchholz, Bordentown, NJ 

A First and Final Insult 

I have a question and a problem. I thought that 
the "MON I, C, O" (Apple II Plus, Applesoft) 
displays what is written to the file. Yet when 
writing to a random access file from an Apple- 
soft program, the display appears normal, but 
occasionally no entry is made in the file. The 
problem occurs in a large personal accounting 
program I've written. The program involves 
using a random access file to preserve detail en- 



tries in any of sixty different accounts. When the 
error occurs, there's no indication the disk en- 
try has not been made, unless later in the pro- 
gram I try to read the detail entries. I've checked 
everything I can think of The file is open (it 
must be read at the start of the program to ini- 
tialize the arrays in the program), the com- 
mand preceding the control-D EXDS command 
ends with a carriage return, the displayed 
"MON I, C, O" is similar for each entry, but 
occasionally the file entry is not made. The fi- 
nal insult is that if I make an entry into the divi- 
dend account and then the groceries account, 
the dividend is not entered but the groceries is. 
By simply reversing the order of these two en- 
tries, the program works fine. Any ideas? Why 
does the display incorrectly indicate that the en- 
tries were made to the file?

Three-Cee-Pee-Em 

I am very much interested in the dBase U data- 
base program. The problem is, how do I CP/M 
my Apple Ills? SoftCard III is supposed to do 
the trick. An acquaintance of mine bought the 
card, but is unable to make dBase U work on 
the Apple III. I understand Z-card and Appli- 
card are for Apple lis. If they could boot dBase 

II on my Apple III in Apple II mode, I would 
consider them. Can fellow readers of Softalk of- 
fer me any help?

Room for Enhancement 

I am interested in buying a DOS enhancer such 
as Diversi-DOS, but I would like to have both 
the speed of an enhancer and the storage space 
of my Rana Elite One. I have had trouble mak- 
ing even minor modifications with Beagle 
Bros's DOS Boss, which, by the way, is a useful 
and fun utility. If anyone can offer me advice, I 
would truly appreciate it. 
Stewart Loving-Gibbard, New Haven, CT 

Statistically Speaking 

I have a need for some apparently specialized 
statistical software that I hope fellow readers of 
Softalk could help me locate. Specifically, I am 
looking for cross-tabulation or contingency 
table programs and a program that would do a 
discriminate function analysis. I am using an 
Apple II. Any suggestions?

Taking Care of Business 

I purchased Apple Business Basic with my com- 
puter and, as I'm new to programming, I've not 
been able to find any examples of programs 
written in the language. If anyone knows of 
some examples, I'd be very appreciative.

Recreational Computing 

Our home was built with two-wire electrical 
service. Is there some solution to grounding my 
computer system, short of rewiring the whole 
house? I've been taking the precaution of un- 
plugging every time I turn off the system. This 
makes any clock/time applications impossible. 



Actually, I'm set up better with my com- 
puter in our travel trailer when we're hooked up 
to power in a trailer park. I must admit that I 
haven't tried this on a weekend vacation yet, 
but I will one of these days. Is there any feasi- 
bility to hooking up with battery (twelve-volt) 
power in a "dry" campsite? 

Has anyone tried this fun combination — 
RVing with a computer?

Travelers' Aid

need to find some software packages for my 
Apple II that she can use in this business. Any 
help from fellow readers would be appreciated.

Just What Icarus Needed 

My main profession involves aviation, flying all 
over the world at various times of the year. I 
would like to use my Apple II Plus in that en- 
deavor. My goal is to find software that, given 
inputs of latitude/longitude, air speed, takeoff 
time, and so forth, will produce a hard copy of a 
flight plan of headings, distances between way- 
points, time of flight, fuel used (given fuel con- 
sumption), and the like. In other words, a flight 
plan that can be used in the air. It would be nice 
to put in a database of navigational aids around 
the country and extract VOR or VORTAC data 
from it. If you're familiar with the Texas In- 
struments TI-59 aviation module, it's that data 
I'm seeking. That chip is more than four years 
old; so I would expect a state-of-the-art version 
for the microcomputer, but I haven't seen any- 
thing like that in my readings of many com- 
puter magazines. 

If anyone can help me with this or direct me 
to someone who can, I'd certainly appreciate 
hearing about it through Open Discussion. 
T. J. Venable, Lemoore, CA 

Going Places 

Can anyone recommend a transportation algo- 
rithm program that works? Osbome/MoGraw- 
Hill's transportation program doesn't work 
quite right for me. Any suggestions? 
Mark Yannone, Phoenix, AZ 

Bitextual Transform 

I wonder if any other readers can help me with 
a file-conversion question I have. I recently pur- 
chased my second Apple, a He, and the new 
Apple Writer written specifically for that ma- 
chine. My problem is that the old word proces- 
sor I used was Apple Pie, which creates binary 
files. Apple Writer He creates text files. Need- 
less to say I have many binary files I'd love to 
convert to text files.

Gifts for the Gifted? 

I am a teacher, and through a fund-raising pro- 
gram our school has been able to purchase a 
64K Apple for our "gifted program." We are 
in need of any free or public-domain software, 
as our funds have now been used up. I would be 
interested in hearing from readers about any

Go Softly into the Print 

Perhaps this is old hat to you hackers, but after 
the search I've been through I thought it just 
might be helpful to some neophytes. These two 
programs will enable you to turn an Epson MX- 
80 printer on and off from Applesoft without 
the complicated procedure normally required.

The procedure is to have Make Exec I in mem- 
ory and the disk you saved both programs on in

2. Use the command catalog,D2 (because run 
does not allow parameters), and then the com- 
mand run. This will copy to the disk in drive 2 a 
text file named PR On. 

You can then copy to other disks with PR 
On, or shift immediately to Make Exec 2 with 
the command Load Make Exec2,Dl. Use cata- 
log, D2 to shift the default drive, and then use 
run to copy to the second disk with PR Off. 

Now the commands exec PR On (Dl or 
D2) and exec PR Off {Dl or D2) will turn the 
printer on or off if the disk with the program on 
it is in the called drive. Parameters are some- 
times optional, and this can be accomplished 
without disturbing the Applesoft program in 
memory.

Tfie Feasibility of Dreams 

I have a hardware question that I would ap- 
preciate some comments on. After purchasing a 
Prometheus Versacard, I realized that the paral- 
lel function of the card can replace the printer 
card I am now using. However, I had been con- 
sidering replacing my current card with the Su- 
per-MX interface card from Spies Labora- 
tories, because of its superclean fonts. But, in a 
magazine review, I read that the print modes 
(and I assume the standard print modes are in- 
cluded) will operate only on one line at a time. 
This being the case, I envision either swapping 
out printer cards, or else having numerous con- 
nectors hang out the back of my Apple and 
having to swap them whenever I want some fea- 
tures of one board over another. This brought 
me to my idea. 

Is it possible, without blowing something 
out, to "Siamese" two Centronics-type printer 
cards together by joining the cables so that each 
control and data line is matched — resulting in 
only one connector that can be left on the print- 
er? In this way, either card could be selected by 
the pr# command, or a simple change in my 
word processor system program. 

Is something like this feasible, or am I just 
dreaming of a simpler worid? I would really like 
to hear from any readers who are familiar with 
this hardware. How about it? 
Steve Nelson, Ariington, TX 

Changes To Be Made 

Help! I have a Centronics 739 printer and an 
Apple parallel printer card. I have found two 
major problems with this setup. First of all, the 
printer card defaults to forty columns. Every 
time I get a program that uses the printer, I have 
to change the program to send a "control-I 
80n" to the printer. This is a pain but I can 
usually do it (I am still working on VisiCalc). 
Does anyone know how I can change this? I 
would like the card to default to eighty col- 
umns. I know machine language, and I have 
tried to change the memory of the printer card, 
but it seems to be ROM. I would rather not buy 
a new card. My other problem is finding a 
graphics-dump program for printer setup. I 
have tried two different programs and not one 
of them has had a setting choice that's worked 
with my printer. All the choices were for other 
printers, mainly Epsons. Does anyone know of 
a program that would work? My manual says 
the printer has graphics capabilities but tells lit- 
tle about using them. I'm really surprised that I 
haven't seen any articles about my printer in 
Softalk, yet I read about the Epson.

Second Referenced and More 

There is an inexpensive solution to Rodney 
Hixon's desire to teach Pascal to his Monroe 
High School students. 

Apple Pascal, by Arthur Luehrmann and 
Herbert Peckham, published by McGraw-Hill, 
offers a good beginner's text for Apple-specific 
Pascal. I have found it to be effective in teach- 
ing me. If you want to avoid having to buy a 
second disk drive for each Apple at school, this 



book's for you, as it was written for use with a 
single-drive system. All examples and refer- 
ences are for single-drive situations. The Pascal 
Language System from Apple includes disks 
that allow booting and operating in a single- 
drive environment, and Apple Pascal teaches in 
that environment. I believe it will be time well 
spent to review a copy of that text. The only 
purchase necessary would be a language card. 

This would be an inexpensive way to offer 
Pascal to your students. As you mentioned, 
there are applications that can be better solved 
with languages other than Basic. 

To Tom Parker File Cabinet is probably 
not the best choice for the database you're 
maintaining. Since you have it and have prob- 
ably already spent a lot of time on it, I'll ad- 
dress that package. 

I have an Epson printer that I use with File 
Cabinet and the Apple II Plus. The printer rou- 
tines in File Cabinet are not correct for operat- 
ing the Epson. You will need to alter about 
three lines in the program to have a match. 
Lines 5230 through 5300 have the printer rou- 
tines and should read: 

5230 PRINT D$"PR#1": REM D$ IS 

CTRL-D PR#1 IS PRINTER SLOT 

5240 RETURN: REM TURNS ON PRINTER 

IN DEFAULT MODE 
.5250 PRINT D$"PR#1": REM D$ IS 

CTRL-D PR#1 IS PRINTER SLOT 

5260 PRINT "80N": REM "CTRL-I SON" 
CONTROL-I IS EMBEDDED 
BETWEEN THE FIRST QUOTATION 
MARK AND 80N. ALLOWS 80 
COLUMN OUTPUT TO THE 
PRINTER. 

5270 RETURN 

5280 PRINT D$"PR#1": REM D$ IS 

CTRL-D PR#1 IS PRINTER SLOT 

5290 PRINT "SON": REM "CTRL-I SON" 
CONTROL-I IS EMBEDDED 
BETWEEN THE FIRST QUOTATION 
MARK AND SON. ALLOWS SO 
COLUMN OUTPUT TO THE 
PRINTER. 

5295 PRINT CHR$ (15);: REM 132 

COLUMN OUTPUT (COMPRESSED 
MODE) 

5300 RETURN 

For your application, I would recommend the 
database program on the Softdisk bonus currently 
being distributed. The address of Softdisk is 381 1 
Saint Vincent, Shreveport, LA 71108. That 
database is freeform, allowing you to enter key 
words, phrases, dates, names of publications, 
authors, and any other pertinent data related to 
one of your news clippings. Then, you can call 
up any or all of them by asking for matches to 
words or phrases you supply. The reason this 
database would meet your needs better than 
File Cabinet is that the entire record is one string 
of up to 250 characters, and the string can con- 
tain any combination of characters/words you 
want. This would be useful in recalling a rec- 
ord. With File Cabinet, you have to define fields 
prior to establishing a file, and then you're rath- 
er constrained by these definitions. 

Another database program I have found to 
be more powerful than File Cabinet is one writ- 
ten by Mark Pelczarski. It is available in Cre-

JUNE 1983 



alive Computing, September 1982. The title of 
the article is "A Modular Database for the Ap- 
ple." It is a disk-based random-access database 
and has a powerful formatting routine for print- 
ing your data. It also allows "and" and "or" 
search for up to eight criteria. I have moved all 
my data from File Cabinet to Mark Pelczarski's 
database. 

For your application with the clippings, I 
believe the most appropriate database program 
would be the one available from Softdisk, but I 
am sure you would find the other one useful for 
other applications.

Preseason Preparations 

My high school football team has asked me to 
try to locate a database to run on the Apple II 
Hus that can be used on the field during play. 
Can anyone help? We would like to keep track 
of play options used by opposing teams and use 
this information on the field in making spot de- 
cisions on counterplays. It would also be valu- 
able to keep track of statistics on opposing 
players, as well as on our own players. Have 
readers any suggestions for a database that 
could accomplish this? 
Philip Arnold, Battle Creek, MI 

A Dose of C 

Softalk has consistently gone to great lengths 
glorifying such languages as Pascal, Forth, Ada, 
and even (horror of horrors) Basic. I have a ba- 
sic reading knowledge of each of these lan- 



guages, and can even dabble occasionally in 
6502 assembler. However, anyone who has ever 
programmed on a bigger machine is bound to 
be frustrated with any eight-bit cpu, and such 
"user-friendly" languages as Pascal are not very 
useful for writing compilers and operating sys- 
tems. Has no one come out with a C compiler 
for the Apple? 

Simply put, C is the least complicated, fast- 
est, and least obtrusive of all the compiled lan- 
guages I've ever seen. Hence, it is the preferred 
language of most system programmers I know. 
While languages like Fortran and Pascal com- 
pile tons of information on any variable being 
passed to a subroutine, C passes the bare mini- 
mum. This means that it doesn't waste time 
checking that every reference to a subscripted 
array is in bounds. It also avoids the strict type- 
checking of Pascal and Ada, making it simple to 
pass addresses of functions as arguments, or to 
have a data type "pointer to a pointer to a 
pointer . . ." ad infinitum. In short, C allows the 
programmer full access to the innards of his ma- 
chine without bothering him with the nitty-grit- 
ty of an eight-bit architecture. 

If anyone knows of a software company 
marketing a C compiler, kindly let me know. 
David Rabson, Cambridge, MA 

Adaptable Apple? 

I have been receiving information regarding 
software to go along with Apple II computers. 
Specifically, my interest is in computer graphics 
software. I do not own an Apple II yet because I 
would like to clarify several things first. 

Can an Apple II be used in Israel and adapt- 
ed for 220 volt and 50 Hz? Or is it available in 
that format in Israel or in Europe? Can the 
American software be used as is with 220 volt 
50 Hz? If not, can it be adapted readily? Can the 
Apple software produced by Apple and others 
be adapted for other hardware made or used in 
Israel? 

I plan to relocate to Israel soon and would 
appreciate the assistance and suggestions of Ap- 
ple users that know these answers. 
Joseph Ben-Israel, Chicago, IL 

Classics Contest Contested 

I was very disappointed in Softalk's handling of 
the Softalk Classics Contest. The disappoint- 
ment is due as much to the failure to print the 
winning entries as it is to the negative manner in 
which you portrayed my entry. 

I feel very complimented with your initial 
statement that the entry "almost had us con- 
vinced," but you went on to take a statement 
out of the entry and use it to show why I didn't 
win. I don't see the purpose in doing that. In 
picking me out for what ultimately will be read 
as a condemnation, you wasted space that could 
have been better served by presenting the win- 
ning entry of either Alan Fedder or Shawn 
Smith. 

Furthermore, I don't see the wrongness of 
the analogy. While I'm a teetotaler, my father is 
a vintologist, and he assures me that wine is of- 
ten referred to as being "refined by time" in his 
circles. Since Beneath Apple Manor has been re- 



fined in the passage of time since it first came 
out, I think it is a perfectly fine analogy. 

In retrospect, I should have said, "Like an 
apple cider that has become more refined with 
time, so has Beneath Apple Manor." 

As usual, the letters column in the April is- 
sue was rife with interesting comment. 

To Norman Jonston: Pirating software is 
wrong. It is difficult to compare software with 
reading material since one is interactive and the 
other isn't. It's quite possible to get use out of 
an extract from a book. An extract from a soft- 
ware program is usually just so much useless 
code. Photocopying extracts doesn't hurt sales. 
If the need for the material is extensive enough, 
the book will be bought rather than photo- 
copied at the rate of ten cents a page. 

I don't have any pirated programs in my li- 
brary; but then again, because I'm cheap, I 
don't have many store-bought programs in the 
first place. The ones I have bought, with two ex- 
ceptions, are copyable. Like Richard Ekblaw, I 
choose to buy only copyable software. I have 
the original Apple PIE word processor. It would 
have been easy to pass around complete copies 
of the program for a few dollars, but that's 
what helped drive Programma International to 
the ground to begin with. May I repeat, piracy 
is wrong! 

To David B. Grott: You have to be reading 
the wrong magazine. 
Gary MacPherson Mugford, Bramalea, 
Ontario, Canada 

Busy Septuagenarian Sees a Difference 

You have just proven, David G. Grott, that no 
matter how good a thing is, there will always be 
someone so blind that he will fail to see it. The 
four Apple texts received with my purchase, 
plus Softalk, were excellent in teaching my sev- 
enty-year-old mind to do taxes, keep track of 
my craft business, make music, create shapes, 
write machine language, and in many ways en- 
rich my life. You have further proven to a for- 
mer Schenectadian that Poughkeepsians are 
"different." 

E. M. Frederiksen, Marietta, GA 
Peek 1984-Plus 

I am a dedicated reader of Softalk, and I'd just 
like to say that it's a wonderful period of tech- 
nological history that we're living in today. 
Now I know all about nuclear arms and ter- 
rorism, but we must learn to think only opti- 
mistically. Our contribution (that of the micro- 
computer industry) will ultimately shape the fu- 
ture and determine our quality of life. Our vig- 
or and enthusiasm will be looked upon in the 
same way as we view the creativity and dazzle of 
the early years of the silver screen. 

I realize that we have many problems to 
solve, like software piracy. But if we can create 
the VisiCalcs and the Wizardry^ and the Screen 
Writers, and the Zorks and the . . . why can't we 
create a subroutine to conquer the disputes we 
encounter today? If we don't find solutions to 
these problems today, future generations will 
end up with even more problems to solve.

ujirDauu TO 




The story of Amdek Corporation is fundamentally different from, 
and at the same time essentially the same as, most of the microcomput- 
er-company stories that regularly appear in this maga2ane. It's a story 
that features an entrepreneur, a part-time consulting engineer, an ener- 
getic sales manager, and an island country called Japan. 

Like a lot of other companies that have started up since the intro- 
duction of personal computers, Amdek is basically one individual's 
baby, though the business has long since passed the days of qualifying in 
anybody's book as a "garage business." Amdek is another friendly com- 
pany run by one of the industry's most respected gentlemen — who start- 
ed the firm with his own money, having left a secure spot in the everyday 
business world for the craziness of the young microcomputer industry. 

The main difference between Amdek and other companies featured 
in the past is that the Illinois-based firm is not strictly an American oper- 
ation. In fact most of the products Amdek offers are produced in Japan 
and Taiwan by independent manufacturing companies. 

The Far Traveler. Go Sugiura, president and founder of Amdek, left 
his native Japan about twenty-three years ago. Since then, he has lived in 
Caracas, Venezuela, and the western suburbs of Chicago, following the 
same basic calling for six years at the first location and seventeen years at 
the latter. 

The importing and selling of electronics products produced in Japan 
is a way of life for Sugiura — an exciting, hectic, sometimes risky way of 
life. Since the summer of 1977, Sugiura has been in business for himself, 
and the risks and excitement have doubled, and then tripled. In seven 
years Sugiura has gone from managing the sales office of a Japanese 
company to heading his own company — a journey that has had both 
rou^ turns and stretches of unbelievable progress. 

Seventeen years ago in Caracas, Sugiura was in the right place at the 
right time. He was working in the business of importing different prod- 
ua lines from Japan. 

"One of the companies I was dealing with wanted to open a sales of- 
fice in the United States," Sugiura recalls, "but they didn't have quali- 
fied people at that particular moment. 



"So they came to me and I saw that there was tremendous oppor- 
tunity in the U.S. — the biggest market in the world — business oppor- 
tunities and career opportunities. So I decided to move to the States." 

This year Sugiura may be more thankful than ever that he made this 
decision; it has taken him far from his homeland and yet has brought 
him wealth, security, and the promise of more opportunities and even 
greater rewards in the future. Amdek is a company on the move. 

Enter the Consultant. In the last two and a half years, Amdek has 
had a personnel increase of several hundred percent and a shift in em- 
phasis that has turned the company into a purveyor of an exciting line of 
peripheral products for a number of different personal computers. Am- 
dek' s success has been realized through the efforts of many people, not 
the least of whom is the company's director of engineering Ted 
McCracken. 

After earning the master's degree in electrical engineering from the 
University of Missouri at Columbia, McCracken worked for RCA de- 
signing disk drives for minicomputers. In 1971, RCA left the minicom- 
puter business and McCracken soon ended up back in school in Mis- 
souri. While he earned his Ph.D., McCracken also worked at the Uni- 
versity of Missouri, and after graduating he took a temporary faculty po- 
sition there. 

In 1976, when the first microcomputers were appearing, McCracken 
started a consulting group to design interfaces for minicomputers, spe- 
cializing in Perkin-Elmer's line of business machines. Sometime that 
year, McCracken's and Sugiura's paths crossed for the first time, under 
less than ideal circumstances. 

McCracken was consulting for a bank that was foreclosing on an 
electronics company. Sugiura had sold components to the company on 
an open account and never received payment. In the process of meeting 
with the bank, Sugiura met McCracken, and, despite the gloomy atmos- 
phere at the time, a lasting friendship began. In the following year, Sugi- 
ura called on McCracken frequently for advice. 

When he first struck out on his own in the summer of 1977, Sugiura 
called his company Leedex. It was basically a continuation of the busi- 



The men behind the monitors. Go Sugiura, far right, is the president and founder of Amdek. Ted McCracl<en, center, a former computer store owner, 




ness he had been in before-the sale of Japanese electronic components 
to OEMs The name was changed to Amdek in early 1981, when an 
Ohio company called Ledex, which made connectors and small motors, 
voiced displeasure over the confusion that had arisen among some con- 
sumers "We had no choice but to change it," says Sugmra 

Sugiura began thinking about importing monitors around the same 
time that McCracken saw his first Apple. "It was in June 1977, at the 
NCC in Dallas. Mike Markkula was demonstrating it and I thought it 
was a good little box," says McCracken. His own experiences gave Mc- 
Cracken an appreciation of how difficult it is to make a complete com- 
puter system, with a case, software, graphics, and so on. 

Midwestern Dealer. McCracken had so much appreciation for the 
machine that he decided to open an Apple computer store. He flew to 
Cupertino and met with the folks there. Subsequently, he became the 
first Apple dealer in the state of Missouri, but not for long, as it turns 
out. McCracken says the store just never got off the ground. 

One day McCracken got a caU from Sugiura who was asking for ad- 
vice, as usual, and a little more this time. Sugiura had found a monitor 
during his travels to Taiwan that he thought might interest Atari, which 
was just getting into the arcade business with its black-and-white Pong 
games. Sugiura asked McCracken for technical help before showing the 

monitor to Atari. 

"It was obvious there was no way it would meet Atari s needs, says 
McCracken. "I told Go it wouldn't do, but if it was modified somewhat 
it would be good for the Apple." , u -a . 

The only other monitors available at that time for the Apple, besides 
owners' television sets, were the Sanyo nine-inch black-and-white mod- 
els Sugiura and McCracken decided that it might just be worthwhile to 
modify the design of the existing monitor, import the redesigned mom- 
tors in quantity, and sell them to Apple owners for a cheaper price than 
they'd pay for the Sanyo model. 

After making modifications and improvements, Sugiura and Mc- 
Cracken took what they called the Video 100 monitor to the West Coast 
Computer Faire in the spring of 1978 and to a computer show m 

is now Amdek's director of engineering. Dan Rimes, left, never had a formal 



Dallas late that summer. 

At the Dallas show, Sugiura shared a booth with another company 
for the modest fee of three hundred and seventy dollars for a ten-foot-by- 
ten-foot space. "We put the monitor on a desk with a character gen- 
erator on the Apple and waited," says Sugiura. "Very surpnsmgly, there 
was a favorable reaction during the show." 

Off on the Right Foot. Sugiura remembers his first production com- 
mitment to the factory in Taiwan for five hundred monitor as quite a 
gamble. In international purchases, ev^Tthing is f f"^- J^! 
monitors didn't sell, Leedex would probably have folded. Luckily, the 
gamble paid off and that first batch of five hundred sold. 

Through 1979 and 1980 Sugiura, with the help of McCracken on 
more or less a consulting basis, continued to pursue the microcomputer 
market. In the fall of 1980, Sugiura decided to introduce a color moni- 
tor-today's Color-I. Prior to this there had been great danand for a wl- 
or monitor, but Sugiura had not been able to find a suitable model m his 
frequent trips to Japan and Taiwan. . , , j 

From the time of its introduction, the Color-I was a hit and fueled 
Sugiura's fiirther ventures into the color monitor business. By the end of 
1980 Sugiura had more or less phased out the seUing of electronic com- 
ponents and was concentrating on peripherals for microcomputers. Mc- 
Cracken stayed in Missouri, dividing his time between teaching at the 
University of Missouri in RoUo and consulting for Sugiura. 

Each year, McCracken has devoted more time to Amdek. This year 
he finally "gave up" teaching for a while and took a year's leave of ab- 
sence from the University of Missouri faculty McCracken says he s 
planning to return to teaching but adds that he's havmg "too much fun 
right now to miss it." 

Sugiura looked next at higher-resolution color monitors; eventually, 
he approached Hitachi about an RGB monitor they were manufactur- 
ing. At the time, Sugiura says, the retail cost had to be around a thou- 
sand dollars per monitor, and he said to himself, "Boy, there 11 be no- 
body who'll pay a thousand doUars for a color monitor, but as long as we 
have a sample let's show it." This was just before the West Coast Com- 

education in sales and marketing, but he's taken on those jobs at Amdek. 




JUNE 1983 



McCracken and Sugiura are pictured here on the top of Mt. Fuji. McCracken, 
who jogs up to seven miles a day, convinced Sugiura, who swims a mile a 
day, to climb to the top of Japan's famous volcano-on one of their frequent 
trips to the island country. Sugiura, who was born in Japan and left the 



country twenty-three years ago, had never made the climb before. Sugiura 
and McCracken are in the business of importing products from the Far East, 
but they feel that the major technological innovations are still coming 
from the U.S. 



puter Faire in early 1981. 

Once again, Sugiura and McCracken were surprised at the favorable 
response. They left the show thinking they could sell perhaps five hun- 
dred RGB monitors a year. They also came away with the comments of 
Color-I users on their minds. A common complaint voiced at the Faire 
was that the Color-I did not work with any of the currently available 
eighty-column boards. 

Soon after the favorable showing of the RGB monitor at the Faire, 
Sugiura made a commitment to the factory for five hundred units and at 
the same time got into the expansion board market with the Digital Vid- 
eo Multiplexor — a card necessary for the Apple II to interface with the 
RGB monitor. The DVM includes an eighty-column option and is one 
of the few Amdek products manufactured in this country. 

The Color of the Beast. For a number of reasons, 1981 was the real

beginning of Amdek's success. The RGB monitor (Color-II) really took 
off when IBM announced the IBM Personal Computer. This opened the 
door for a lower-cost RGB monitor (Color-Ill), which Amdek started 
selling in early 1982. 

In November 1981 a key individual joined the Amdek staff in the 
person of sales manager Dan Rimes. Rimes, whose varied background 
included running his own microcomputer business and working for com- 
panies like Heath and Autotrol Technology, says that he had "a nice 
background in high-level graphics." One day he wrote a letter to Sugi- 
ura and introduced himself, laying out a possible marketing plan. 

In the last year. Rimes and his growing staff of sales and marketing 
people have worked very hard to get Amdek's name known and accept- 
ed by consumers. "It's really exciting when people walk in a store and 
ask for Amdek by name. You have no idea what it took to achieve that. I 
still think of us as 'little Amdek.' " 

Well, "little Amdek" has now expanded into four different locations 
and more than forty-five employees. The company is headquartered in 
the Chicago suburb of Elk Grove Village, where Sugiura and Rimes are 
based. McCracken has a team of eleven engineering personnel working 
with him in Rollo, Missouri, and last year Amdek opened two sales of- 
fices, one in Dallas and one on the West Coast in Costa Mesa, CaHfor- 
nia. The latter location is also the main warehouse, which receives all the 
merchandise shipped from overseas. 

Sugiura says there is a loose structure to the operation of Amdek be- 
cause the company is still developing at a rapid rate. He has no vice presi- 
dents or board of directors officially, but that situation is bound to 
change. Jim Ray, formerly with Northwestern Industries, has just been 
hired to handle the finances, freeing Sugiura from the day-to-day prob- 
lems he has dealt with admirably for so long. 

Another key individual is Steve Wilson, who joined Amdek in No- 
vember 1982 after working for RCS, a distribution company in Los An- 
geles. Wilson is the manager in charge of sales at Amdek's Costa Mesa 
sales office. 

Musically Uninterested. In 1981, Sugiura began to work fairly close- 
ly with a company in Japan called Roland. Initially Amdek and Roland 
planned to do worldwide distribution together, but Sugiura says that 
halfway through the project the two companies went in different direc- 
tions. There is still some confusion surrounding this stor>', because dur- 
ing the time the two companies were working together Roland set up a 
division called Amdek and then never changed the name when the two 
parted ways. 

The difference in opinion, or direction if you will, centered on Ro- 
land's commitment to the music market, which Sugiura says "we didn't 
really have an interest in. We're strictly a peripherals company." 

McCracken also found the idea of music systems unappealing: 
"From my standpoint — the technical side — what I know about music 
you could print on a fingernail. The Amdek company in Japan is also in- 
to lots of kits for hobbyists. Nowadays, the U.S. market for kits is dead.

Business Form Processor 




To automate your business, don't change all your familiar business forms. Change to VersaForm. 

VersaForm fills out your present forms very much the way you do. Only faster. And (if you'll pardon 
the expression) more accurately. Why, it even prints on forms of your own design. 

Then VersaForm stores this information. Alphabetically and numerically. Which means, you now 
have a data base that can track your business. Product by product. Customer by customer. And month 
by month. 

Also, VersaForm prints the kind of reports that help manage your business, within today's tighter 
profit margins. Like sales reports based on familiar information. Information that VersaForm tabulates, 
automatically. 

What's more, VersaForm automatically checks for errors. Something that doesn't happen when 
people fill out forms manually. 

Your people are familiar with your forms. So are your customers. Why change a good thing? 

Tbtm management is business management.

dead, dead, dead. I told Go something to the effect of, 'We go into kits 
over my dead body.' " 

Sugiura admits that the situation is confusing and so does McCrack- 
en. As it stands, there are still two Amdeks, though Sugiura's division 
doesn't market in Japan, and the Amdek in Japan doesn't market here. 
According to McCracken, Europe is the one place of possible confu- 
sion, and Sugiura's Amdek is planning to market heavily there in the 
not-too-distant future. 

"But we're all on the same team," McCracken says. "It's just a mat- 
ter of finding the best way to sort it out." 

For the American Amdek, the affair was not a total wash. Sugiura 
did pick up a one-pen plotter — now known as the Model DXY Plot- 
ter — from the Japanese Amdek and has been selling it in the American 
market. He says there is always the possibility the two companies will do 
something together in the future. 

Instinct for Survival. Amdek's gradual moves into plotters, DVMs, 
and now microfloppy disk drives is in response to the pressure the com- 
pany is feeling from certain areas — it can't survive as just a monitor 
company, says Sugiura. The major computer manufacturers, such as 
Apple with its Monitor III, have got their act together and are starting to 
offer their own monitors. 

The prevailing thought now among the three — Rimes, Sugiura, and 
McCracken — is that Amdek has to offer high-quality products that have 
a little something extra. This trend started with the added value of pe- 
ripheral cards — complete with software — that were, and still are, sold 
with the RGB monitors. 

Amdek is also starting to bring out more products that complement 
their monitors. Rimes refers to these new frontiers Amdek is exploring as 
cross-marketing — collaborating with third-party vendors. This month, 
Amdek is releasing DVM II, which is an upgrade of the DVM that in- 
cludes at no extra charge the Amgraph business software, produced by 
Business & Professional Software, for creating graphs and charts. Users 
can also use the DVM II to upgrade from a monochrome monitor to the 
Color-II. 



Amdek is also coming out with the DVM 80e — an RGB, eighty-col- 
umn-compatible card for the Apple lie. Once again, the Amgraph pack- 
age is included at no extra charge. 

The Incredible Shrinking Disk. The most exciting product for the 
Apple that Amdek is just starting to ship is the Amdisk I, a three-inch 
microfloppy disk drive. Sugiura and McCracken realize it's a risky prod- 
uct, but the two are confident that it will achieve success on the market. 

"There's a lot of confusion right now, with all the different kinds of 
sub-five-and-a-quarter-inch drives," says Sugiura. "Everyone is saying 
they have the standard, but we believe there is a possibility it will be the 
three-inch." 

The Amdisk I drives are manufactured by Hitachi, and, McCracken 
notes, in Japan the three-inch drive is more or less becoming the stan- 
dard. "Sony is the only company making three-and-a-half-indi drives. 
Companies like Mishusta, Cannon, and others are all making three-inch 
drives. Whether or not three-inch becomes the standard in this country, 
you're still going to see a lot of Japanese portable computers in the next 
few years with three-inch drives." 

Both Sugiura and McCracken believe that Amdek is the only com- 
pany actually shipping sub-five-and-a-quarter drives in the U.S. They are 
actually six months behind schedule, says McCracken. The original 
model Hitachi showed them had less than acceptable performance levels 
because of a problem with the read/ write head. Amdek asked Hitachi to 
make modifications, and that delayed the product's release. 

Two or three months ago, McCracken was still very skeptical about 
the three-inch drive, but lately he's feeling a little better about it. "Sony 
did a tremendous job of marketing and made it seem that this country 
wanted three-and-a-half-inch drives as the standard. 

"They [Sony] tried to get the American National Standards Institute 
to rule on the microfloppy standard in favor of three-and-a-half-inch," 
McCracken explains. "ANSI rejected it because the Sony drives were not 
compatible with existing five-and-a-quarter-inch formats." 

Flip-Side Coming Attractions. The Amdisk I plugs into the Apple 
controller card and can act as a primary or secondary disk drive. The 
magnetic media is housed in a nearly indestructible plastic case. The 
disks are double-sided and Rimes says it's not unlikely that we'll see 
some companies, particularly game publishers, using the other side of the 
disk to include a preview of upcoming products. 

The three-inch disks themselves will seem a tad expensive at first — 
probably $6.99 each. Rimes says that the price will drop with time and 
that it could very easily have started at ten dollars. 

At Comdex this April in Atlanta, Amdek announced that thirteen 
software companies — including some of the biggest names in Apple, 
Atari, and IBM software — would support the three-inch-disk format. 
Those companies are Broderbund, Sirius, Hayden, DataMost, Conti- 
nental, TMQ, BPS, Sierra On-Line, Penguin, Synapse, Computer Sys- 
tems International, Tab Books, and PC Software. 

Three times a year Sugiura and McCracken travel to Japan and 
Taiwan to maintain contact with manufacturers and look for new prod- 
ucts. "They always have something to show us," says McCracken. "We 
didn't just decide one day to sell a three-inch disk drive; Hitachi came to 
us and said, 'Would you like to market it?' There's a tremendous reser- 
voir of products in Japan." 

During every trip to Tokyo, McCracken makes it a point to walk i' 
around the Akihabara district, where the consumer electronics busi- | 
nesses and stores are concentrated. "It scares the heck out of me. In a six- 
teen-by-two-block area there are thousands and thousands of television 
sets, stereos, computers, everything imaginable. And there are always a 
million people, it seems, sorting through the goods. 

"There is a momentum building in Japan, a computer momentum. 
It's.going to be tough to compete with the Japanese on the international 
level. It's scary as heck how competent they've become so rapidly. 

"The whole country is really getting cranked up for going big into 
consumer computer merchandising. And they're starting to make the 
right decisions on software. It's going to be tough sledding for some 
American companies when those Japanese companies start unleashing 
products. 

"Of course I speak with a forked tongue," says McCracken, "what

company that is importing Japanese products as fast as we can get them 
off the boat." 

Over Here. According to Sugiura, the United States represents to 
Japanese industrial companies the single largest market in the world, and 
in order to grow those companies must come over here to sell their 
products. 

"They do their homework to come up with marketable products and 
once they set a goal they go after the market as strongly as possible. 
Sometimes they'll get a little too aggressive and that will have a reverse 
effect. That's one of the things we see happening today. 

"The Japanese think this is the country of unlimited potential and 
technology and strength that nobody in this world can match. But at the 
same time they kinda feel, well, that the U.S. has sat on that power a little 
too long. Things are too easy here. 

"My observation has always been that the consumer in the United 
States compared to the consumer in Japan is just an angel," Sugiura con- 
tinues. "American consumers are generally too understanding, too pa- 
tient. . . . You can use a half dozen unprintable words to describe the 
consumers in Japan. They don't want to understand. They don't want to 
be patient. They just demand — more than what they're paying for. 

"And that is a pressure felt by the dealers and the manufacturers. 
That's the big factor that has brought the Japanese products to the qual- 
ity level they are now at. One of the most common comments I've heard 
from Japanese companies is, 'It's easy over here in the United States.' " 

Sugiura goes on to say that the practices of some American deal- 
ers — those who claim to test each product received before putting it on 
the shelf — would be an insult to a manufacturer in Japan. "In Japan 
that's totally unheard of — the dealer not trusting the product. 

"Over here you may buy a copier and think it's no big deal to pay 
ninety dollars for a service contract. It's self-admittance that this ma- 
chine could possibly — probably — break down within the year. Of course 
there are a lot of factors — cost of labor and so forth — and I can under- 
stand that. But in Japan, when you pay three thousand dollars for a ma- 



chine it's got to last a year or two. 

"The basic attitude of the consumers in this country is not applying 
enough pressure to the manufacturing companies. Whenever consumers 
have a problem it's either a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against some ma- 
jor corporation or there's no real voice at all. 

"In Japan if something doesn't work, they say so out loud. That's the 
pressure those manufacturing companies feel constantly." 

Producing consumer electronic products in Japan is one thing; mar- 
keting them in the U.S. is another. To be a success, foreign firms have to 
have knowledge of the market, and that's where a company like Amdek 
is at an advantage. 

"I've been in this business for almost seven years," says Sugiura. 
"The manufacturing companies in Japan appreciate our knowledge and 
marketing expertise." 

Although he looks for new products in Japan, Sugiura believes that 
the major technological developments are still coming out of this coun- 
try. The Japanese are strong at manufacturing and can always be ex- 
pected to take existing products and make similar products with im- 
provements. And Amdek will continue to take advantage of this 
situation. 

Window to the Future. A salesman will by nature come up with 
catchy phrases and Rimes has come up with a fine description of Am- 
dek's past, present, and future. "Monitors," he says, "are windows to a 
personal computer. And monitors for Amdek have been a window into 
other areas. Monitors have been the jumping-off point for a whole line of 
peripheral products." 

This year will probably be the most crucial yet for Amdek. With new 
and challenging products on the market and more on the way, Amdek is 
taking chances. For Sugiura, McCracken, Rimes, and the rest of Am- 
dek, 1983 should be exciting. 

And, though there's always the unpredictable, Amdek has proven 
they have the talent and experience to adapt to the changing personal 
computer scene.

ventures with 
VisiCalc 



BY JOE SHELTOH 



Ever wonder how the price of a restaurant entree is determined? 
What factors would you consider? Making this determination gets com- 
plex. An entree usually consists of three or more different types of food 
and often contains other, less obvious ingredients as well, such as spices, 
milk, butter, and so on. The size of the portions also affects the price, as 
does the labor involved in preparing the meal. Other overhead costs in- 
clude rent, other wages, power, and so on. Finally, the profit must be in- 
corporated. In short, the process is not as easy as just determining the 
cost of the food and adding a little profit. 

This month we'll look at a simple template that a restaurant might 
use to calculate menu prices. If you aren't in the restaurant business, you 
might use the template at home to figure out how much you spend on 
meals and to help determine which meals are really economical. 

In addition, everyone who uses VisiCalc is in a position to discover 
hints, short cuts, and new uses for it. The remainder of the column will be 
used to share some ideas that resulted from readers' responses to previ- 
ous columns. 

VisiCalc a Flambe. The template we're going to design will take in- 
to account only the actual costs of the ingredients and labor that go into 
the preparation of a meal, but it can easily be modified to include fixed 
costs as well. 

First we must realize that every line item on the menu requires calcu- 
lations similar to the ones we're going to develop. The ideal method 
would be to have all the line-item prices calculated on a single template. 
That way, the costs of various ingredients used in different entrees have 
to be entered only once. 

To simplify matters, we're going to assume that the cost for each in- 
gredient is based on the cost for the complete inventory of the ingredi- 
ent. In an ideal world, a restaurant wouldn't run out of an ingredient be- 
fore purchasing more of it. So the cost of an ingredient would be deter- 
mined by the actual cost of the ingredient used, yet the inventory would 
have a different average cost. You could use average cost, but the only 
way to make this template truly accurate would be to determine ingredi- 



ent cost by a standard inventory method such as first-in, first-out. An- 
other option would be to average in the cost and amount of the current 
inventory with the cost and amount of the new inventory. We won't at- 
tempt that here. We'll just go with one cost per ingredient. 

Swordfish Royale. Swordfish Royale is an exciting dish that com- 
bines the full flavor of grilled or broiled swordfish with a tangy sauce. A 
half grapefruit (color optional) serves as a counterpoint to the rich, 
meaty swordfish flavor. Fresh steamed asparagus and cottage fries round 
out the meal. A dry white wine is recommended. 

Our recipe is for two diners. This is an incredibly tasty meal and sur- 
prisingly easy to prepare. The majority of the expense is for the sword- 
fish, so the meal can be fairly economical. 

Now boot VisiCalc and let's begin. If you were doing a master tem- 
plate for a complete menu, you'd start with the individual ingredients in 
a "variable" section that would include the name of the ingredient along 
with its current price and the amount of the measure. For example, you 
might enter flour at a price of five cents, with the measure being per 
ounce, or you might even enter the price per pound (bag) and then de- 
termine the individual measure prices from that. For example, if you 
paid $1.64 per pound for flour, a recipe calling for a cup would require 
you to calculate the price per pound divided by the number of cups in a 
pound. It is important to ensure that the base values for the ingredients 
in each recipe are the same. Until you are completely comfortable with 
the different conversions, you shouldn't calculate the price per cup in one 
example and price per ounce in another. 

First, enter the information displayed in figure 1 . If you have Visi- 
Calc Advanced Version, you can set a wide enough column width in col- 
umn A to permit the entry of the complete ingredient's name. If you do 
that, continue to enter the other data in the same cells shown in this arti-

gredients. Figure 2 is a list of example (totally inaccurate) costs. When 
actually using the template for your own costing, you'll of course want to 
enter your own costs. 

First enter the costs in the appropriate cells in columns C and D. 
Next let's determine the appropriate food costs in column G. The for- 
mula in G5 is -t-E5*C5. 

Replicate this formula through column G using relative reference. 
Now enter the time for cooking shown in figure 3 into the appropriate 
cells in column H. Notice that the time is entered only for the main items. 
If you wish, you can enter a minimal time for things like salt, but wheth- 
er you do so will depend on just how precise you want the template to be. 

Finally, we have to calculate the total cost — that is, the cost of the in- 
gredients plus the cost of labor. Our formula will have to convert the 
labor rate from hours to minutes. The formula in 15 will be 
G5-l-(H5*(Cl/60)). 

Replicate this through column I. Note that G5 and H5 are relative 
references, but CI is no change. 

In 115 enter the formula to calculate the total cost: @SUM(I5. . .114).

Figure 4. 



We have now completed a basic template for determining the costs of 
a meal. To make it truly useful in a restaurant, fixed costs need to be in- 
cluded and the profit must be added in order to determine the final price. 

As it stands, the template is very simple to design and complete. If we 
wanted to change it to calculate the prices of a number of different en- 
trees, we'd have to lay it out in a different format. Most restaurants in- 
clude the same item (a salad, for example) on different entrees. It's a 
waste of time to calculate the cost of a salad for every entree. Instead, the 
template can be structured so the cost of common items is calculated in a 
single location and then included in the cost of the entree by means of a 
single-line item. 

If a restaurant wanted to computerize, the actual menu could be laid 
out in a menu "report" section, with the computational section located 
elsewhere on the template. In addition, all of the ingredients could be lo- 
cated in a single section. The final template layout might be similar to 
that in figure 4. 

If you lay your template in the format illustrated in figure 4, be aware 
that you will have cell references from one section to another. You will 
probably want to do the final pricing calculations, including profit, la- 
bor, fixed expenses, and so on, in the menu section. 

When designing a template that contains many sections, one of the 
most important concepts to remember is consistency. Do all specific cal- 
culations in the same section. Keep all variables in a separate section. En- 
sure that the report section is either all calculated formulas or all refer- 
ences to other cell locations where the actual calculations are completed. 
Using this method, you'll ensure that you minimize debugging and rede- 
signing problems should the need for either arise. 



The Recipe for Swordfish Royale 

Wash and dry swordfish (one slice per person), cut one inch thick. 
Season generously on both sides with salt, black pepper, and pap- 
rika. Spread one side of each steak with butter and broil (butter side 
up) in a preheated broiler about two inches from flame. Cook slices 
for three minutes, turn, spread uncooked side with butter, and broil for 
four more minutes. 

Melt three tablespoons butter (the real thing!) in a small saucepan. 
Add eight chopped green olives (with pimento) and heat well. Pour 
over fish just before serving. 

One-half sliced presectioned grapefruit (per serving). Served on indi- 
vidual salad plate. 

Slice one baking potato (per person) in numerous wedges. Wash in 
warm water and (important) dry completely on paper towels. Spread 
lightly with cooking oil and bake until done. 

Clean and steam two asparagus spears per person. 



H/a^N'T YOU HEARD 
OF THUNDERCLOCK PLUS ? 




If you want to put 
your Apple® to work — around the 
clock — Thunderclock Plus is the solution. Just plug it 
in and your programs can read the month, date, day of 
week and time — down to the second — in any of Apple's 
languages. So your Apple can do any number of tasks 
for you automatically. In the office, the lab or at home. 

Most good software packages for business, data base 
management, communications and time management 
are made to read Thunderclock Plus. (It's compatible 
with DB Master,* Micro- Courier** and VisiDex^, to 
name a few). So no matter how you use your Apple now, 
Thunderclock Plus can make it a more versatile 
and efficient tool. 

For example, with business or communi 
cations software, your Apple can auto- 
matically access a data base or send elec- 
tronic mail when the rates are lowest. 

In addition, Thunderclock Plus can 
organize your disk files. Our optional 
DOS-DATER™ software upgrades the 
regular DOS on your disks. So every 
time a program is saved or a file is modi- 
fied, the time and date, to the minute, 
are stored in the CATALOG with the file 
name. Now you can instantly know 
exactly when your files were last updated. 



Thunderclock Plus 
can even give you a sense of 
security. Or just make your life a little easier. With our 
X-10 interface option and a BSR X-10* Home Control 
System, your Apple can turn on your lights, water your 
lawn . . .whatever you desire, according to schedules you 
create. It comes with our menu-driven SCHEDULER 
software. So it's easy to design and modify schedules 
that can run in the "background" while you have 
"hands-on" use of your Apple. 

Thunderclock Plus comes with a one-year warranty. 
Powered by on-board batteries, it runs accurately for up 
to four years without battery replacement. 

So now that you've heard of Thunderclock Plus, isn't 
it time you put your Apple to work — 
around the clock? See your dealer 
for a demonstration or contact us.

Readers' Response. Over the past few months, numerous readers 
have responded to challenges presented in this column or have written in 
with problems and suggestions. 

In the December 1982 issue we defined a problem in which a formu- 
la would display ERROR if any of the cells referenced in the formula 
contained an error. In our problem, it was probable that there would al- 
ways be some cells containing a divide-by-zero error. We wanted values 
to be displayed and the ERROR indications to be insulated from the dis- 
play and any other results. Jon Torbert of Grants Pass, Oregon, Robert 
Breault (no address), and Martin Farkas of Chicago, Illinois, all re- 
sponded with answers. The specifics aren't important, but each reader 
had solved the problem in a different fashion. None solved it in exactly 
the same manner as was shown in the January column. Torbert and 
Breault had very similar solutions, while Farkas took a different, more 
complex path. The important thing to note is that for most problems 
many solutions are possible. 

Solving Problems. If you're having trouble finding a solution to a 
problem, there are a few guidelines you might keep in mind. First, re- 
member that problems can usually be separated into two different cate- 
gories, the first type being the application problem. What is it that you 
are really trying to accomplish? Can you define the problem and the vari- 
ables completely? Do you know how to solve the problem on paper? If 
you can't answer these questions, you may be premature in tuming to 
VisiCalc. Make sure that you know how to solve the problem before you 
ask VisiCalc to solve it. 

The second type of problem is Kw/Ca/c- related: You are able to write 
down the complete solution and define exactly how you want it solved, 
but you don't know how to make VisiCalc do what you want. This can 
be a difficult situation. It is even possible that VisiCalc can't solve your 
problem. This is where personal experience, the manual, the reference 
card, and outside information (such as this column) can help. 

Constant readers will remember seeing the "phrass simple and elegant. 
Put another way, KISS — keep it simple, stupid. That is usually the best 
thing to do when you're trying to solve a problem. The more complex the 
problem, the more you must endeavor to simplify the solution. 



If you've reached a point of frustration, walk away from the prob- 
lem for a while. Often taking a stroll in a park, doing something that 
takes your mind off the problem, or waiting a couple of days will facili- 
tate the solution. You may find when you return that the answer has 
presented itself 

If all that fails, there's another way to proceed. First, try to break the 
problem into the smallest parts possible. Lay them out on paper in a sim- 
ple mathematical or flow-chart format. Looking at the basic level of the 
problem often helps you find the solution. Then solve the problem in 
steps in your template. Once you're certain that you have the correct 
solution, you can combine various steps. For example, it might require a 
number of steps (cells) to solve a problem. Once you've found the solu- 
tion, you might be able to combine two or more cells or formulas into a 
single cell. But if you had tried initially to complete both those steps in a 
single cell, you might never have succeeded. 

If that approach doesn't work, write the problem and your solution 
in English (or the language of your choice). You normally communicate 
and think in your native language; so writing the solution will often al- 
low you to rewrite it in VisiCalc's language. 

If everything fails, throw out your original idea and look to see if 
there is another way to approach the problem. Look at the reference 
card, or the manual, or to a friend for inspiration. Look at other tem- 
plates you've completed to see if there are any similarities. 

Breault pointed out another potential problem. In the same template 
that the challenge addressed, we completed a statistic that we labeled Av- 
erage/sales rep. At the time, that seemed like a logical statistic that could 
provide our hypothetical sales manager with additional information. As 
Breault pointed out, the method used to calculate that information pro- 
vided a statistic that was not very meaningful. And that is another thing 
to be aware of when using VisiCalc. It is very simple to develop ratios 
and analysis and then rely on them as gospel. It is easy to assume that the 
computer has developed irrefutable statistics. As the old computer tome 
says: "Garbage in, garbage out." Make certain that you really under- 
stand what your analysis provides before you risk making decisions 
based on it. -m

Is it really June already? That may be so, but school doesn't let out 
for us. No way. We'll be here all summer with interesting pieces of infor- 
mation to make learning all this computer stuff a little less painful. But 
after we get through this month's session, we can all go outside and play, 
unless somebody makes us clean out the garage or mow the lawn. 

The first thing we should clarify is who should be attending this class. 
Two months ago, we said that this column would be aimed toward peo- 
ple who are using the Apple He. That does not mean that we're alienat- 
ing those who have the Apple II Plus, though. The things discussed here 
apply to both computers unless we say otherwise. In fact, the biggest dif- 
ference between the two machines is appearance; the inner workings are 
very much the same. 

That's one of the great things about the way the folks at Apple de- 
signed the He. They wanted to make a computer that included things 
that you used to have to pay extra for (more memory, lower-case letters, 
eighty-column-display handling), and they even added a few extra fea- 
tures. But they didn't want to make the lie so different from the II Plus 
that it would become an entirely new machine. They wanted to make 
sure that most things that worked with one computer would also work 
with the other. This includes software, hardware, and people. 

In short, most of the things we cover here will apply to both the II 
Plus and the He. The few things that work differently on each computer 
will be explained for each. This is especially true with the subject we'll be 
discussing this month — the Apple's anatomy. 

The biggest differences between the II Plus and He are in the amount 
of memory each has; the II Plus has 48K of memory, and the He has 
64K. Unfortunately, if you have only 48K, you can't load Integer Ba- 
sic — you need 64K. If you want to have Integer Basic in your II Plus, you 
have to go to the store and purchase a language card, also known as a 
RAM card, which gives you 16K or more memory. 

So, unless you have a total of 64K in your Apple, you can't do any- 
thing with Integer Basic programs, those preceded by the letter "I" in the 
catalog. Trying to run or load Integer Basic programs on a 48K ma- 
chine will only result in a "language not available" message. 

Here are two terms we should understand before we really get rolling: 

Motherboard: It's also called the circuit board, or the main board. 
All it refers to is that big green board that's fastened to the bottom of the 
Apple with all the chips, resistors, diodes, and other electrical junk 
plugged into it. In other words, the chassis. 

K: It stands for kilobyte; one K equals 1,024 bytes (no, you didn't 
miss anything; we'll explain bytes later on). You use this with a number 
in front of it 16K, 48K, 128K. . . . Think of it as a unit of measure, just 
like gallons, dozen, or feet. K tells you how much memory you have. 

Don't Touch Me There; It Turns Me Off. Before we even begin 
looking around inside the machine, you must promise to never, never, 
ever remove, insert, or otherwise alter any interface boards while the Ap- 
ple is on. Interface boards (sometimes called peripheral boards or inter- 
face cards — no one really cares) include the controller card that your disk 
drive is plugged into, an eighty-column card you might have inserted, or 
perhaps the card the printer is plugged into. 

There's no law that says you can't remove cards while the computer 
is on, but if you do decide to start tinkering around then, you do so at 
your own risk. If you're wondering what all the fuss is about and why 



we're spending so much time making sure you don't pull out or insert I 
cards while the power is on, just ask anyone experienced with the Apple 
what happens if you do. I 

After they stop laughing, they'll tell you that it's sort of like changing | 
spark plugs while your car's ignition is on. Just don't do it, okay? j 

When the people at Apple were designing the lie, they knew that the | 
pulling out and putting in of interface cards is a hazard that's not too ob- j 
vious. So, they included a red light right next to slot 1 that lights up when j 
the power's on. It's just an extra safety measure to let you know not to j 
start messing with the Apple's insides until you switch it off. j 

Anatomy lOlA. With power off, remove the lid of your Apple by I 
lifting up on the rear corners of the lid. They snap open if you tug at | 
them long enough. The first thing we're going to look at are the expan- | 
sion slots, also called interface slots and peripheral slots. II Pluses have \ 
eight slots that lie parallel to each other along the rear of the mother- i 
board, numbered 0 to 7. lies also have eight. Slots 1 through 7 lie along j 
the back, too; the eighth, or auxiliary slot, sits next to the power supply, i 

When you want to add devices to your Apple, the expansion slots are i 
usually where you plug them in. Devices include disk drives, printers, 
modems (which let your Apple communicate with other computers via I 
the telephone lines), and all sorts of cards that do all sorts of things, i 

Fortunately, the Apple doesn't read all the slots all the time. Getting | 
things that are plugged into those slots to work is not much different j 
from turning on the components of your stereo system. You can operate i 
one of them, two of them, or as many of them at a time as you want. But ' 
just because they're plugged in doesn't mean they'll run; you have to in- 
dicate which ones you want to use. 

Turning on the Apple, as we've seen, starts the disk drive going. Con- 
ventionally, the disk drive controller card goes in slot 6. Actually, you 
can have it sitting in any slot you prefer, except for slot 0 in the II Plus 
and the auxiliary slot in the He. 

When the power is switched on, the Apple looks for the controller 
card, beginning with the highest-numbered slot and working its way 
down. As soon as it finds the controller card, it boots whatever disk is in 
the drive that's connected to drive one of that card. Thus, if you have 
more than one controller card plugged in, the Apple starts the drive 
that's in the highest-numbered slot and none of the others. 

Because you can connect two drives to each controller card, you can 
have fourteen drives hooked up at a time if you have a card in each slot. 
One thing we should remember is that the He's auxiUary slot takes pre- 
cedence over slot 3. So, if you have a card in the auxiliary slot, you 
shouldn't have anything in slot 3. 

Pick a Slot, Any Slot. Just as the controller card conventionally goes 
in slot 6, slot 1 is usually where you hook up the printer, and slot 2 is 
where you usually put a modem. But these are just conventions; you can 
do it any way that pleases you. 

For II Plus owners, slot 0 is usually reserved for language cards, also 
called RAM cards. You can plug in cards that give you Applesoft or In- 
teger Basic (whichever one you don't have), or you can plug in RAM 
cards that give you extra memory space. The reason they go in slot 0 is 
that many RAM cards also connect where the upper left-hand RAM 
chip is — we'll talk about RAM in a few seconds — and slot 0 is the closest i 
one to that chip.

The next organ inside the Apple we should look at is the microproc- 
essor. This is the brains, or control center, of the computer; it's where all 
commands are executed. In the II Plus, the microprocessor is that long 
horizontal chip right below slots 3, 4, and 5. In the He, it's the long verti- 
cal chip just below slot 3. The Apple uses a 6502 microprocessor (6502B 
for the He), the best one on the market, depending on whom you're talk- 
ing to. 

For some unexplainable reason, owners of computers with different 
miCToprocessors always think theirs are the best. IBMers will fight to the 
death defending their 8088s; TRS-80 owners will stand tall when theZ-80 
anthem is played; Atarians will claim their machines are just as good as 
Apples because they also use the 6502, but that's about as far as com- 
parisons between the two go. 

The 6502 really is a marvelous piece of engineering. It can perform 
more than half a million operations per second. Apple tells us that the 
6502B in the He is a high-speed version of the 6502, but in simple appli- 
cations who can really tell the difference between 500,000 and 501,000 
operations per second? All the microprocessor really does is look at a 
spot in memory, perform whatever the instructions there say to do, move 
to the next spot in memory, perform those instructions, and so on. Some- 
times instructions involve nothing more than taking two numbers, com- 
paring them, and then going to a certain memory location based on 
those numbers. 

Finally, we agree that the 6502 is the most powerful chip in the 
known universe. Okay, in the Apple at least. One important thing the 
6502 doesn't have — and this is true of all microprocessors — is memory. 
That is, it can do those half-million operations seemingly at once, but it 
doesn't retain any information. Once things pass through the 6502, 
they're forgotten, and new ones come in. It's very much like a person 
with constant amnesia. He knows what he's doing at the time, but he for- 
gets what he's done after he's done it. 

Look, but Don't Touch. The next major organs we should under- 
stand are the ROMs. ROM stands for "read-only memory." Well, that's 
fine, but what does it mean? "Read only" means that you can read the 



information that's on these chips, but you can't write or alter anything 
on them. It's a one-way street. The II Plus's ROMs are located in the six 
sockets right below the 6502 microprocessor. 

In the lie, the ROMs are the two medium-sized chips that sit to the 
right of the two really long chips below the 6502. If you're not sure which 
ones they are, it says CD ROM and EF ROM above them on the 
motherboard. 

ROMs, unlike the microprocessor, do have memory in them. In fact, 
all they are is memory, but not for us to use for storage. When ROMs 
are made, they don't have anything in them (just like blank disks). The 
purchasing guy from Apple buys a whole bunch of them from the ROM 
manufacturer, brings them back to Apple, and throws them all into the 
programmers' cage. Sometimes you might hear stories that the pro- 
grammers eat these things, but that's all folklore; don't believe it. 

It's the programmers' job to take the ROMs and put programs and 
other utilities on them for Apples to use. One of these programs is called 
the Monitor, short for system monitor. Don't confuse it with the moni- 
tor that you use like a television screen to watch what's going on; this 
one's quite different. The Monitor in ROM has several programs, or 
subroutines, in it. Perhaps the primary one is the start-up routine, the one 
that gets the system going when you flip on the power switch. 

Also in the Monitor are little subroutines that other programs use. 
These subroutines look for information and move it to various places in 
the machine. They're sort of like mail clerks; they look at pieces of infor- 
mation, figure out their destinations, and then send them on their way. 
So, all the Monitor do* > is keep an eye on things, making sure all those 
pieces of data get to where they're going. 

Parlez-Vous La Computer Language? There are also programs in 
ROM that translate input and other programs into a language the com- 
puter understands. Here's what we mean: 

Turn on the Apple and load DOS from one of your disks. When you 
get the cursor, type print 2+2 (remember to have the He caps-lock key 
down). The answer you get, hopefully, is 4. Now type print "hello." Be 
sure to put the quote marks around "hello." All done? The Apple does

just what you told it to do — print the word hello. 

The Apple doesn't recognize the English word print, just as a non- 
English speaker wouldn't understand it; the Apple understands only the 
language it was born with, called machine language. To meet the Apple's 
needs, ROM has language translators in it whose jobs are to take what- 
ever comes into the computer via keyboard or a program and translate it 
into machine language. 

One such translator is the Applesoft interpreter. When you run an 
Applesoft program, the interpreter reads and translates the program 
piece by piece. When the first chunk of information comes along, the in- 
terpreter translates it into machine language and sends it to the micro- 
processor; when the next piece of information comes along, it gets trans- 
lated and goes to the microprocessor, and so on. It's the same way a for- 
eign ambassador's interpreter works — he translates what is being said in- 
to a different language, word by word, as it's being said. 

On the other hand, the compiler is a different kind of translator. The 
compiler takes a program, translates it into machine language, and then 
feeds the whole thing to the computer at once. The compiler can be com- 
pared to a book translator. Whereas the ambassador's interpreter trans- 
lates things on the spot, the book translator rewrites the entire book in a 
different language before he lets anyone read it^ Likewise, the compiler 
creates a machine language version of the original program for the com- 
puter to run. 

It's not that clear to see, but, because of the different types of trans- 
lators, compiled programs run faster than interpreted (Integer or Apple- 
soft) Basic ones. When you run a Basic program, the interpreter has to 
intervene, translate statements one at a time, and then give each one to 
the computer. Compiled programs, however, are already translated; 
thus, the computer can read right through them and not have to wait for 
something to translate each statement first. 

The third type of translator is called the assembler. Its job is much 
like the Basic interpreter, except that it translates assembly language into 
the computer's machine language. Assembly language is less readable 
than Basic to us humans, and it's just about the closest you can get to 
speaking machine language without having a microprocessor implanted 



into the brain. Because assembly language is that much closer to ma- 
chine language, the translation process isn't as complex, and programs 
written in assembly run even faster than compiled ones. 

Just to make things more confusing, ROMs are often referred to as 
"firmware." Hardware is all the rigidly constructed stuff that makes your 
computer run; hardware can't be altered to operate differently. It in- 
cludes most chips on the motherboard, disk drives, printers, and other 
peripherals. Software is what makes the computer do things; it can be 
modified. You have software on disks and in ROM. 

So, if ROMs are sort of like hardware (they're chips, right?), and 
they're sort of like software (they have programs to operate the com- 
puter, right?), then what are they exactly? "Firmware" is a nice compro- 
mise, and that's how people frequently refer to ROM. 

We're RAMblin' Now. The last principal part of the Apple's 
anatomy we'll look at is called RAM, which stands for "random access 
memory." Random access means that we can have admittance to any lo- 
cation in that memory without having to go through all the ones that 
precede it. Even though the Apple can scan memory locations at the rate 
of several hundred thousand per second, being able to go directly to a 
specific one without going through the others does save a lot of time and 
is quite a luxury. Video games just wouldn't play as well without ran- 
dom access. 

"Random access" is an accurate way to describe RAM, but it's not 
complete. Whereas ROM meant "read only," RAM means "read and 
write." That's just a fancy way of saying you can read the contents of the 
memory, and you can write or put stuff there, too. If you were with us 
back in April, you'll remember that we said booting a disk loads DOS 
into a corner of memory, and that the System Master disk loads Integer 
Basic into another corner of memory. Well, RAM is the memory where 
all those corners are. 

For II Plus people, RAM resides in those three rows of eight chips 
(twenty-four in all) that are enclosed in a white box found right below the 
ROM chips. They're not too hard to miss; they take up about a third of 
the motherboard, and they all have "RAM" written below them. Each 
one holds 2K of memory; twenty-four of them give you a total of 48K.

For lie students, RAM lives in that row of eight chips at the bottom 
right-hand comer of the motherboard. Each one has 8K of memory, so 
the eight chips give you a total of 64K. 

Now, where does this RAM and ROM stuff leave us? Hopefully, 
only mildly confused. But if you're still having problems knowing the dif- 
ference between the two, think of ROM as a school textbook. It's a place 
to store information, but all the information is already there; it was put 
there by the book publisher. You can read what's there as often as you 
need to, and it will be there forever. And, just like a textbook, you can't 
write, change, or erase anything in ROM either (actually, you can write 
in a textbook or tear the pages out, but you'll get scolded by the teacher, 
so don't do it). 

On the other hand, RAM is like a composition book, or a diary. It's 
completely empty and can be used to put things in. You can write as 
much as you have space for, and you can also read what you've put 
there. Unlike ROM and textbooks, you can erase and modify the con- 
tents in RAM, too, just like you can change what you've written in your 
diary (this comes in handy when you want to remember things as you 
wish they had been, not as they really happened). 

Bytes, Bits, and Other Hard Stuff. Perhaps the hardest part of 
learning about computers is understanding how^they handle informa- 
tion. We'll touch on it briefly, just to make the summer miserable. 

Believe it or not, the computer really understands only two things: 
something is, or something isn't. Yes or no. On or off Pass or punt. 

When it counts, it counts two numbers: 0 and 1, and that's all. The 
numbering system that uses only Os and Is is called the binary system; just 
as our decimal system has ten digits, 0 through 9, binary has two. And, 
because it's called the binary system, it just makes sense to call the digits 
binar>' digits. 

This is where we tie everything in to computers. The smallest piece of 
information the Apple understands is a binary digit, or bit for short 
(binary digi/). A bit is either a zero or a one, signaling that something is 
or isn't. Here's one now 1. Here's another 0. Well, with just two states 
of existence, there's really not much that bits can do. 



SOFTAI 1^ 



JUNE 1983 



But if we combine them, say, eight at a time, we can do all sorts of 
things. We can make combinations such as 1001(X)11, or (XXWllll, or 
10101010. You can see that these groups of eight can signify a heck of a 
lot more than just two states of being. In fact, they can be arranged into 
256 different combinations. It's the same as taking our decimal system 
and combining its digits to make numbers like 500,000 or even 2,254,828. 

The Apple processes bits in groups of eight, just like the examples we 
just looked at. A group of eight bits is called a byte. Don't ask why it's 
spelled that way; no one knows. So even though 0 and 1 are the only 
values the computer really understands, they're handled only in groups 
of eight, or a byte at a time. This makes it look like the computer under- 
stands 256 different numbers. 

Whenever we talk about computer memory, we rarely talk in terms 
of bytes. That would be like talking about distances between stars and 
planets in terms of feet and inches. It just doesn't mean much. Instead, 
we measure stellar distances in light years, and we measure computer 
memory in kOobytes. "Kilo" usually means "a thousand" to us, but in 
this case it's a little more than that. One kilobyte, or IK, is equal to 1,024 
bytes. Why? Because. 

Remember, the computer is thinking in terms of two digits, and 1,024 
is equal to two times itself ten times. In this case, ten was chosen because 
two times itself ten times (1,024) is the closest we could get to 1,000, a 
nice round number. 

So, K is nothing more than a unit of measure, telling you how much 
memory something has. Someone telling you that "this computer has 
48K" or that "this RAM card has 128K of extra memory" is not unlike a 
Tupperware ad describing different containers: "Capacities: seventeen 
cups, holds five pounds of flour," or, "This drip-free spout with hinged 
cap container holds up to two quarts." 

No More Pencils, No More Books. And no more teacher's dirty 
looks. However, school's not out for summer. That's it for today, faith- 
ful ones. But don't forget to come back next issue; it'll be real hot out- 
side, and we'll cool off with some lemonade and watermelon (bring your

LOCK-IT-UP 

DISKETTE COPY-PROTECTION 
AND DUPLICATION SYSTEMS 
FOR THE APPLE COMPUTER 

The Lock-lt-Up systems are sophisticated, menu driven 
copy-protection and duplication utilities for the Apple II 
Computer. They feature several levels of protection which 
make standard diskettes uncopyable by even the most 
sophisticated nibble copy programs currently available. 

• All sectors on the diskette can still be used. 

• Data files can be loaded and/or saved to either the protected diskette 
or an unprotected diskette. 

• Memory will be cleared and the disk will reboot if the reset key is 
pushed. 

• The copying systems support up to 14 disk drives. 

• Complete data-verification is optional during copy. 

• Sequential serial numbers are assigned to each diskette produced by 
the system 

• Master diskettes created with the system contain an I.D. stamp that 
you select. The I.D. stamp must be correctly specified before any 
diskettes can be duplicated. This prevents other Lock-lt-Up owners 
from copying your diskettes. 

• Extensive support is provided should you have any problems or 
special needs. 

• Our system is supported by numerous disk copying services should 
you need a large quantity of diskettes duplicated. 

Either system is available for $225, which includes three diskettes, an 
informative manual, and a non-exclusive license to copy as many 
diskettes as needed.

Like most Basic interpreters, Applesoft has no built-in capacity to 
produce variable lists as compiled languages do. This is unfortunate. Be- 
cause all Basic variables are global, it's easy to reuse variable names acci- 
dentally and change the value of a critical variable in the process — espe- 
cially in a somewhat lengthy program with many subroutines. A cross- 
reference variable list would make such bugs easier to discover. Such a 
list would display the variables in alphabetical order and list with them 
the numbers of the lines in which they occur. It's then an easy matter to 
spot recurrences of the same variable in two disparate sections of code. 

Though an Applesoft program can be interrupted at virtually any 
point (with control-C, stop, end, or reset) and variable values can be dis- 
played in immediate mode with print statements, it can be tedious to pro- 
duce the entire variable list with current values by that method. A utility 
to do that job for you has obvious application in debugging. 

To write utilities for variable values and line references, we need to 
know how Applesoft stores and indexes its variables. Though the Ap- 
plesoft manual is enlightening as to how an Applesoft program and its 
variables are stored, an actual example can help you understand the data 



The output is set up for a printer. To modify it for a forty-column screen, 
change the 16 to an 8 in line 198.

Examining Applesoft Variables scohsmith 



structure better. A necessary intermediate step is to write a program to 
display portions of memory. Because certain bytes might make the most 
sense expressed in hexadecimal, some in decimal, and others with their 
ASCII representations, this program should display any range of mem- 
ory locations in all three of these modes. Key parameters to an Apple- 
soft program and its variable list are given in hex (figure 1); so addresses 
need to be input in hex. 

We'll call the program Mem Display. Hex input will be in one of 
three formats. A single address or a range will be displayed by inputs in 
the format nnnn or nnnn.nnm. An input of just a period will display the 
contents of the next eight bytes from the last location displayed. The pro- 
gram takes in input in one of these three formats and converts the upper 
and lower bounds of the addresses to decimal. The appropriate bytes are 
peeked and displayed sixteen bytes at a time in all three modes. ASCII 
control characters have the up arrow prefix. Mem Display is in listing 1 .

tfie end of the program plus 1 or 2, unless changed with 
the LOMEM: statement.

To see the Applesoft internal version of the first few lines of Mem 
Display itself, observe the output of Mem Display in figure 2. Applesoft 
programs start at the address pointed to by $67 and $68; remember, ad- 
dresses are stored internally with the low byte followed by the high byte. 
Applesoft programs end at the address pointed to by $69,$6A (minus 1 
or 2). Note the line numbers highlighted in the decimal row; two bytes 
are allotted for a line number (allowing line numbers to reach their Ap- 
plesoft maximum of 63999). The two-byte line numbers are followed by 
the actual program statements. To help decipher the line images further, 
it's useful to have Appendixes F and K from the Applesoft manual 
handy. 

Reserved words, listed in Appendix F, are recognizable by their deci- 
mal tokens. 

Line 198 starts with the variable assignment NB = 16. All the char- 
acters in the command are stored in ASCII format except for the equal 
sign, which is a reserved word with the token 208. After the ASCII colon 
is the token 178, which means rem. This is followed by a space and the 
ASCII equivalents for each character in the remark. 

The first byte in line 199 has a decimal value of 1 34, the code for dim; 
this is followed by the ASCII equivalents for P, (, 1, 6, and ). By compar- 
ing several lines of code with their memory images, the following rules 
can be deduced about storing Applesoft programs internally: 

1 . The first two bytes of a line image form the address (in typical 
low-byte/high-byte fashion) of the next line image; hence 
$082E is the address of line 199, $0850 is the address of line 200, 
and so on. This facilitates quick searches through the program 
for line numbers. 

2. The third and fourth bytes form the line number, also in low- 
byte /high-byte order (most apparent in decimal). 

3. All bytes from the fifth on correspond to keyword decimal 
tokens, variable names, punctuation, and data. 

a. Any byte whose value is larger than 127 is a reserved 
word — it can be found in Appendix F of the Applesoft 
manual. 

b. Any byte whose value is less than 128 corresponds to a 
character in a variable name, punctuation, or data — the 
ASCII symbols are the tip-off. 

4. Each line image ends with a byte of 0. 

5 . The last line image of a program is followed by two bytes of 0; 
this corresponds to a null pointer to the nonexistent next line. 

Now that it's been determined what variables look like in the internal 
representation of an Applesoft program, the first utility, a variable cross- 
reference list, can be written. The basic idea is to search the program's 
line images for variable names — they must start with characters A 
through Z. The utility. Variable Xref (listing 2), assumes that the vari- 



able names in the program to be scanned are a maximum of two charac- 
ters; this makes recognizing them much easier. A list of variable names 
will be kept. Each entry in the list is a string whose first four characters 
designate the variable name — for instance, Ibbb, B%bb, P(bb, AZ$(, 
where b indicates a blank space. The line numbers in which the variables 
occur are converted to a four-digit hexadecimal string and appended to 
each variable string (provided that that line is not already represented). 
Four-digit hex was chosen because it can represent all possible line num- 
bers, and because that constancy makes it easier to read those line num- 
bers later. When the program looks for a variable name string, a binary 
search is employed — if the name isn't found, a string representing that 
variable name is formed and inserted into the list. 

Determining what is and what isn't a variable is not trivial. Though 
the first character of a variable name must be alphabetic, ASCII A 
through Z can also occur as literals in many places, like print "This", 
A$="That", input "The other";A$. Fortunately, in these cases, the let- 
ters are surrounded by quotation marks (ASCII decimal 34). 

In the subroutine that determines variable names from their internal 
representations (parses the variables), variable QF (quote flag) is used to 
signify the beginning and end of a string literal; this facilitates variable 
name recognition. The only place where string literals can appear with- 
out quotation marks is in data and rem statements. Flag DF (data flag) is 
used to detect and skip data statements so such string literals will not be 
interpreted as variable names. 

Digits between 0 and 9 pose a similar problem — besides possibly be- 
ing the second character of a variable name, they can also be part of a 
line number (for instance, goto 200) or part of an integer or real con- 
stant (A = 200). This last observation suggests that another flag, GV

(good variable), indicating that a good variable name is being parsed, 
should be used to allow digits to be included in variable names in the 
right circumstances. 

This parsing subroutine starts at line 62200. The subroutine is called 
to find a variable name and will either return with one or signal the end 
of a line (EOL) or a rem. If a variable name is found, the variable list is 
searched and the proper action taken (either forming a new variable 
string or adding the line number to the variable string). If EOL or rem is 
found, the next line in the program is sought, and, if it's not larger than 
62000 (the start of Variable XreJ), the subroutine is called again. 

Variable Xref should be captured into a text file by typing it in, add- 
ing these lines, and running it: 

10 D$ = CHR$(4) : N$ = "VARIABLE XREF" 

20 PRINT D$; "OPEN"; N$ 

30 PRINT D$; "WRITE"; N$ 

40 LIST 100, 

50 PRINT D$; "CLOSE"; N$

Figure 3 


. Output 


of Variable Xref for Mem Display. 



Make sure there is no file named Variable Xref on the disk before you 
run this. Then, when you want to cross-reference a program in memory, 
type exec Variable Xref and run 62000. A sample run is shown in figure 3. 



The program assumes that variable names consist of a maximum of two 
characters; if that's not the case, or if there are syntactical errors in the 
program being scanned, the results may not be accurate. If the program 
to be scanned needs more than three hundred variable strings (with six- 
ty-two lines per variable string, variables may require more than one 
string), modify the dim in 62005. The program is not speedy; scanning 
Mem Display (1,708 internal bytes) took 105 seconds. 

Besides verifying how programs are stored internally, Mem Display 
allows the format of the Applesoft variable lists to be verified. A descrip- 
tion of Applesoft variable maps (page 137 of Applesoft manual) and Ap- 
pendix L both declare that $69,$6A points to the start of the simple 
variable list, while $6B,$6C points to the start of the array variable list. 

Adding the statements in listing 3 to Mem Display and dumping se- 
lected parts of memory (figure 4) will reinforce the information in the 
manual. $69,$6A points to address $103D. Displaying several bytes 
from that point reveals the simple variable list, in which entries are seven 
bytes long.

WUTAI 1^ 



JUNE 198: 



The first variable is SS$ (the first byte is S; the second byte is S with 
the high bit on — the exact reverse of the Applesoft manual). Its length 
is sixteen, it's stored at $8DF0 (note the contents at that location), and 
the other two bytes are 0. The second variable is 11% (both bytes are 
I with the high bit on— subtract 128 or $80 to get ASCII I). Its value is 
256 * (high byte) + (low byte); the other three bytes are 0. The third, 
fourth, fifth, and sixth simple variables are I, J, Rl, and R2, but let's 
postpone discussing real values for a paragraph and look at array vari- 
able storage (but note that the next simple variable is A$, from the origi- 
nal Mem Display). 

The address pointed to by $6B,$6C, $10D7, is the beginning of the 
array variable list. Displaying the first few entries there shows that S$ 
(first byte S, second byte null with high bit on) is the first array variable. 
The next two bytes form the displacement ($28) to the next array vari- 
able (note that $10D7 -I- $28 = $10FF, where the entry for R% starts). 
The next byte reveals the number of dimensions (1 for this variable), and 
the following two bytes (high byte, low byte) indicate the default dimen- 
sion size of 1 1. Each trio of bytes after this is length/low byte /high byte 
for each subscript, indicating the length of each string and the location 
where it's stored. As mentioned, the next array variable is R%, dimen- 
sioned 3 by 2; the offset to the next array variable (P from Mem Display) 
is $21 . R% has two dimensions, the sizes being 4 and 3(3 + 1 and 2 + 1 
to allow a 0 subscript in both dimensions). Multidimensional arrays are 
stored with the rightmost index ascending slowest; the array is stored 
with the subscripts in the order 0-0, 1-0, 2-0, 3-0, 0-1, 1-1, 2-1, 3-1, 0-2, 
1-2, 2-2, and 3-2. The values are stored high byte, low byte and can be 
verified with the expected values from the program. 

Storage of real variables is tricky. Simple variable Rl (listing 3) has 
an assigned value of 23. It's stored (figure 4) with an exponent of $85 
(133) and the first byte of the mantissa is $38. The value (exponent - 129) 
is an exponent of 2; call this value EX ( = 4). The mantissa is a displace- 
ment to be added to 2 A EX (= 16), with the following procedure: Convert 
the mantissa to binary (in this case, $38 becomes 0011 1000) and move

the "binary point" EX -I- 1 places from the left to the right (to the left if 
EX -I- 1 is negative). The binary displacement 0011 1000 becomes 
00111.000 (= 7; the rest of the mantissa, consisting of Os, can be ig- 
nored); this added to 2 A EX gives 23. Similarly for R2. Its displaconent 
with the binary point moved is 001 1 1 .101, which would add 4-1-2 + 1 + 
1/2 + 1/8 to the base of 16. 

Once these points are understood, writing the utility to print the pres- 
ent values of a program's variable list is possible. This utility, Variable 
List (listing 4), should be captured (use the same method as was used to 
capture Variable Xref, but change N$ to "Variable List" in line 10) and 
can be put in memory with exec either before or after the original pro- 
gram's execution without disturbing the variable list — but must be 
executed with a goto 63000 {run 63000 would wipe out the very list the 
utility is to print). It searches both simple and array variable lists; deter- 
mines from the name if a variable is real, integer, or string; and uses what 
we've discovered about how variables are stored to print the variables. 
See figure 5 for a sample run. Variable List itself uses only variable names 
that end in 9; this allows it to detect the end of both variable lists (when it 
finds one of its own). This means, of course, that the user's program can- 
not have any variable names containing 9.

If you could runyour 
program up to 

20 times faster, 

would it be such 
a terrible thing? 



Minutes spent sitting at a computer waiting for your program 
to run can add up to hours of wasted time. And, since time is 
money, unproductive time can cost you a small fortune. 

If you write software in Applesoft™ BASIC, you need the 
Einstein Compiler. 

With a single command, it automatically translates your BASIC 
into far more efficient machine language. The compiled version 
of your progam then runs many times faster than the uncomipiled 
version. And you'll save time— every time you run it. 

The Einstein Compiler, which enables you to compile and 
execute multi-module programs, contains sophisticated tools for 
debugging your programs and for protecting program security 
A unique code compression algorithm keeps the size of your 
compiled program to a minimum, saving you memory without 
sacrificing speed of execution. 

If you're a novice programmer who didn't understand any of 
that— don't worry about it. With all Einstein Master Programs; 
even the User Guide is human factored. All you need to know is 
that the Einstein Compiler will save you time and money 

And what could be bad -ru^ cir^^^r^iKi n^^w^^ii^^™

There is one tricky aspect to Variable List. Because array elements (or 
pointers to string elements) are stored linearly, an algorithm is needed to 
figure the subscripts from the ordinal position of the element they repre- 
sent. One-dimensional arrays are no problem; the value (ordinal posi- 
tion - 1) is the single subscript sought. Multidimensional subscripts are 
harder; consider the first twenty-four elements for an array dimensioned 
2 by 3 by 4 and their respective subscripts (figure 6). This table suggests 
that after dividing (ordinal position — 1) by the size of each dimension in 
turn, the remainders are the subscripts, and the quotient becomes the 
next value to be divided by the next dimension size; this continues until 
the last subscript is found. For instance, if 18 is 1 less than the ordinal po- 
sition, 18/3 leaves a remainder/subscript of 0, and 6 is to be divided 
next by 4; 6 / 4 leaves a remainder of 2, the second subscript, and 1 is to 
be divided by 5; this leaves a remainder/ subscript of 1. If (ordinal posi- 
tion - 1) is 18, this represents the array element R%(0,2,1). In Variable 
List, K9 is the number of dimensions, and K9( 1) through K9(K9) is a list

Last month we were discussing why Apple DOS is the most widely 
used disk operating system in the world. This month we are going to con- 
tinue looking at DOS as an operating system. And we'll go exploring in 
your Apple's basement. We'll also take a close look at the DOS com- 
mands mon and nomon. 

We left off last time after looking at how Uncle DOS intercepts all 
messages and commands from you or the program you are using. DOS 
looks for messages that might be meant for him in a sleepy-headed sort 
of way, ignoring any message that doesn't buzz his alarm with a return 
and a control-D. 

We discussed how DOS's method of tapping the Apple's I/O links to 
intercept these messages isn't just a trick. It is a correct and elegant use of 
a fundamental characteristic of the Monitor, the operating system buih 
into every Apple. 

The Monitors Three. What we didn't talk about last month was that 
three slightly different versions of the Monitor have been used by Apple. 
The Integer Basic Apple II came with the Apple System Monitor, which 
is usually called the "old Monitor" these days. Integer Basic Apple lis 
were manufactured from 1977 through mid- 1980. 

Sometime around the beginning of 1980, Apple introduced the Ap- 
ple II Plus, which came with Applesoft Basic and the Autostart Moni- 
tor. Production of this model ceased in January of this year, when the 
Apple lie was introduced with yet a third version of the Monitor. How- 
ever, as far as Uncle DOS is concerned, the Apple He's Monitor is a du- 
plicate of the Autostart Monitor. 

But there are several differences between these newer Monitors, 
which were written with DOS in mind, and the old Monitor, which 
wasn't. The newer Monitors will automatically start up or boot a disk 
when the computer is turned on. The standard Integer Basic Apple will 
not. In fact, very early versions wouldn't even accept Basic or DOS com- 
mands until after you pressed the reset key. Then you had to type in a 
control-C to start up Basic and a pr# command to start up DOS. 

A second important difference between the old Monitor and the new- 
er versions is the effect that pressing reset has on DOS. With the newer 
Monitors, pressing reset usually stops whatever program is running and 
returns you to Basic, with DOS untouched. 

With the old Monitor, however, reset disconnects DOS. The DOS 
addresses in the I/O links we talked about last month are replaced with 
the addresses of the Monitor's own input /output routines. Early Apple 
owners usually use the "three-dog" technique to reconnect DOS. More 
about this later. 

Consorting with the Monitor. While the newer versions of the Moni- 
tor are clearly improvements in terms of ease of use, the old Monitor was 
a friendly gammer in her own way. When you turn on one of the older 
Apples and press reset, the screen fills up with miscellaneous characters. 
In the bottom left-hand corner there is an * and a flashing prompt. 

The asterisk is the Monitor prompt, just as ] and > are the Applesoft 
and Integer Basic prompts. When the asterisk prompt is on your screen. 



a whole set of Monitor commands is at your disposal. These commands 
let you inspect what's in your Apple's memory, change the values at cer- 
tain bytes, move things around, and more. 

These commands are beyond the scope of this column. If you are in- 
terested in learning more about using the Monitor directly, the Apple II 
Reference Manual is a good place to start. This book was in the box with 
Apple lis and Apple II Pluses. It is an extra-cost option with the 
Apple He. 

If you'd just like to visit the Monitor, perhaps only to say you've met, 
enter this command from Basic. 

CALL -151 

To return to Basic, press reset or control-C. Since the advent of the 
Apple II Plus, which includes the Autostart Monitor, Apple users 
haven't seen much of the old Monitor. But she was always very quick 
and responsive, though a little difficult to talk to (always so ayptic!). 

Things That Go Bump in the Night. There's a word coming up in a 
sentence or so that may scare you. Given fair warning, you should have 
the courage to stay to see it, rather than running away like it was a spider 
or something. The word is "vector." Try not to think of the fear that 
gripped you when your high school physics or math teacher used this 
word. It means something else in our context anyway. 

Vector is derived from a Latin word that means "to carry." In as- 
sembly language, a vector is a specific, defined memory location a pro- 
gram can jump to that will then carry the program to a subroutine it 
wants to use. Vectors are used with subroutines that don't have a spe- 
cific, predetermined, permanent address in memory. 

Uncle Apple DOS, for example, doesn't really have a permanent 
home. While DOS is usually found in the memory area starting at byte 
40192 (in hexadecimal that's $9D00) and going on up to 49151 (SBFFF), 
it isn't necessarily so. DOS was designed to run on Apples with as little as 
16K of memory. On a 16K Apple the memory area starting at byte 
40192 is nothing but thin air. So on Apples with less than 48K of mem- 
ory, DOS installs itself at the highest available address. 

Since we did away with Apples having less than 48K in this column a 
couple of months ago, you might think that DOS has found a perma- 
nent home. But beware. Many users like the idea of moving DOS up into 
the language card area. Several software packages on the market now in- 
clude programs designed to do this — particularly the high-sp)eed DOS 
packages we talked about in March. 

Down the Cellar Steps. Since DOS doesn't have a permanent home, 
it always files a change-of-address notice in what is known as the page 
three vector table when it starts up. This table is always found at memory 
locations 976 ($3D0) to 1023 ($3FF), as shown in the Apple mem- 
ory map. 

This month's figure is a lot like last month's. This time, however, it 
has a better view of the very beginning of your Apple's memory. This 
area is special. Think of it as your Apple's basement. It's a place one

doesn't go very often, but there's lots of neat stuff stored there and it's 
fun to explore. 

The first 256 bytes of memory, from byte 0 ($0000) to byte 255 
(SOOFF), are called memory page zero. 

Assembly language programmers often think of the Apple's mem- 
ory as having 256 pages. The left two digits of a hexadecimal address in- 



dicate the memory page — the right two digits the memory byte. For ex- 
ample, we mentioned earlier that DOS usually starts at $9D00. This is 
the same thing as "page nine-D, byte zero." 

Page zero is endowed with special powers on computers such as the 
Apple that use the 6502 microprocessor. So is page one. Basic and the 
Monitor use these pages constantly and keep a lot of interesting num-

bers and flags there. 

Page two is used by the Monitor as a keyboard input buffer. As you 
type a Hne into your computer, the line is saved in this area as well as dis- 
played on your screen. When you hit return, DOS and Basic, each in 
turn, examine the contents of this buffer, hoping to find a syntax error. If 
one of them is successful, he will be happy to beep your speaker. Other- 
wise, your command will be executed. 

Skipping over page three for a moment, note that pages four through 
seven are where characters that are to appear on your screen are placed. 
Your computer's circuits scan this area many times each second. On each 
scan the numerical contents of this area are translated into characters 
and placed on a video signal. What you see on your screen is the end re- 
sult of this miracle. 

The order in which characters are stored in this area has been de- 
scribed as "Byzantine," "Kafkaesque," and "all mixed up." While the 
SCTeen's first forty characters are stored in the first forty bytes of this area, 
just as you might expect, the second line starts at byte 128. It's the ninth 
line that starts at the forty-first byte. 

The Page Three Vector Table. Going back now to page three, we 
find that most of it is empty. This empty space is often used by assembly 
language programmers for short programs they don't want Basic to step 
on. Basic doesn't use this area. Looking at the rightmost part of the fig- 
ure, however, you can see that the last forty-eight bytes of page three are 
packed with information. This is the page three vector table. 

Even though the table is written as assembly language instructions, 
you don't have to be an assembly language programmer to use it. The 
following paragraphs will contain examples of using the table from Ba- 
sic and from the Monitor. 

The table has two major parts, the first part containing vectors that 
will carry your program into some useful areas of DOS, the second part 
consisting of vectors that the Monitor itself uses. Most of the vectors in 
the second part are of little interest to us here. They have to do with redi- 
recting your computer to handle Applesoft ampersand commands, in- 



terrupts (something only special peripherals such as clock cards can do), 
and so on. 

The Soft-Entry Vector. One important vector in the Monitor's half 
of the table, however, is known as the soft-entry vector. This vector isn't 
available with the old Monitor — it was one of the things added for the 
sake of DOS in the Autostart Monitor. The soft-entry vector tells your 
Apple where to go after you press the reset key. 

In Apples with the old Monitor, pressing reset always disconnects 
DOS and dumps you in the Monitor, with an asterisk on your screen. 

But on autostart Apples, pressing reset tells the Monitor to take a 
look at byte 1012 ($3F4). If this byte, called the power-up byte, contains 
the proper value, the Monitor will jump to the address stored in the soft- 
entry vector. This address is usually 40383 ($9DBF), which is the DOS 
warm-start address. 

But if, on the other hand, the power-up byte contains an incorrect 
value, the Monitor will proceed to reboot DOS. When you first turn on 
your Apple, this value is always incorrect. Thus the Autostart Monitor 
will always boot DOS as part of the automatic reset cycle you initiate by 
turning on your computer. 

If you want your computer to reboot DOS when you press reset, all 
you have to do is change the value in the power-up byte. If you want 
your computer to do something besides a DOS warm start when you 
press reset, put the address of the assembly language routine you want to 
jump to in the soft-entry vector, then set the power-up byte to the correct 
value by calling 64367 ($FB6F). The routine at this location in the Moni- 
tor corrects the power-up byte. 

Remember that none of this works on Apples with the old Monitor. 
A call to 64367 in the old Monitor usually sends you somewhere over the 
rainbow. 

The DOS Vectors. Now let's look at the DOS half of the page three 
vector table. It begins with a jump to the DOS warm-start address, just 
as the soft-entry vector normally does. A DOS warm start does several 
things: It resets the language card, if available, to the language in use the 




Roger Wagner Fan Appreciation Day 

Time to get out those handkerchiefs. As tear-jerkers go, the end of E.T. was nothing compared to this one. If you 
cried like a baby during the Who's Farewell Concert, then get prepared to weep buckets. 

This month, Roger Wagner is bidding a fond farewell to 6502 assembly language. After thirty-three seasons of 
Assembly Lines, Wagner is hanging up his assembler and moving on to other challenges. It's enough to make one ' 
start blubbering like a Yankee fan on the day the "Clipper" stepped down. 

Ironman Wagner may be retiring from his monthly 6502 assembly language column, but you'll still see his writing 
in Soitalk. 

And you can relive the highlights of his first fifteen installments of Assembly Lines, published in Softalk October 
1980 to December 1981, with a special action-packed book that should be on every memorabilia lover's list of 6502 
collectibles. Assembly Lines: The Book is Wagner's way of saying to his loyal fans, "Thank you for all the bitchen i 
years." ^ 

If you loved the thrills cind chills of Assembly Lines over the years, then you'll treasure Assembly Lines: The Book. 
It follows Wagner from his early victories explaining the basics of assembly language programming to his later 
triumphs over the more sophisticated aspects of this great sport. 

Assembly Lines: The Book costs $19.95 (plus $1.50 postage and handling if you order direct from Softalk) and is , 
available in many fine computer stores around the country. i 

So long, Roger, it's been swell. j

last time DOS was cold-started; resets the I/O links so DOS can see all 
incoming and outgoing messages; executes a nomon command; and 
jumps to the warm-start routine of the Basic language you are using. 

At the end of a warm start you will find a Basic prompt and a flash- 
ing cursor on your screen. Any program you had in memory before the 
warm start will still be there. If DOS had become unconnected for some 
reason it would now be reconnected. 

Users of Integer Basic Apples with the old Monitor are usually very 
familiar with this warm-start vector. As mentioned earlier, pressing reset 
on one of these computers disconnects DOS and leaves you in the Moni- 
tor, with an asterisk on your screen. Entering the Monitor command 
3 DOG causes the computer to jump to the DOS warm-start vector, which 
reconnects DOS and restarts Basic. The 3D0 part of this command is the 
hexadecimal address of the warm-start vector, and the G is the Monitor 
equivalent of goto. So much for the famous three-dog procedure. 

The second vector in the page three table points to the DOS cold- 
start address. A DOS cold start takes a look at and remembers which 
Basic language is active; updates a language vector table inside DOS 
itself; resets the I/O links so DOS can see all incoming and outgoing 
messages; executes a nomon command; and jumps to the cold-start rou- 
tine of the Basic language you are using (this erases any program in 
memory). 

When Basic puts its prompt on the screen, DOS regains control, re- 
members it was in the middle of cold-starting itself, and stakes claim on 
some space it uses for what is known as DOS buffers, resets the address 
of the highest memory location (himem) Basic can use so Basic will 
honor the DOS buffer claim, and checks to see if DOS was just booted. 
If not, the cold start ends here. After a boot, on the other hand, DOS will 
also post notice of its main entry-point addresses in the page three vector 
table and run your hello program. 

After a call to the DOS cold-start vector you will find yourself in 
Basic, with any program you had in memory gone. Note that once DOS 
has been booted there is nothing you can do to make it update the page 
three vector table. This is so that changes you make manually to the table 
will stick. 

Meet the File Manager and Mr. RWTS. The next four vectors in 
the page three table carry you into the interior reaches of DOS itself. A 
call 982 wakes up the DOS file manager. The file manager studies the file 
manager parameter list, which is a table of numbers inside DOS, and 
executes whatever action is indicated there. 

Calling the file manager directly is fairly dangerous, since you don't 
usually know what is in his parameter list unless you have filled it in 
yourself But to prove the page three vectors really work, do a catalog 
and follow it immediately with call 982. Your catalog command sets up 
the parameter list. Your call 982 takes advantage of this setting. 

We cannot emphasize too much that call 982 doesn't always give you a 
catalog of your disk. It will sometimes destroy files. In a few months we'll 
show you in detail how to fill in the file manager parameter list yourself. 
If you just can't wait that long, get a copy of Beneath Apple DOS by Don 
Worth and Pieter Lechner. Otherwise, forget you ever read about 
call 982. 

The next vector takes you directly to the part of DOS called RWTS. 
This is the part of DOS that actually turns on your disk drive, moves the 
arm inside it to the correct track, and transfers data between your disk 
and your computer. RWTS is controlled by numbers you place in a ta- 
ble called the input/output control block, or lOB. 

Regular readers may remember Bert Kersey's discussion of how to 
use RWTS directly in the October 1982 DOStalk. Both Beneath Apple 
DOS and your DOS manual contain further information. 

The next two vectors in the page three table are not actually vectors 
at all but very short assembly language routines that can give you the ad- 
dress of the file manager parameter list and the lOB. Since you must 
know where these tables are to use the file manager or RWTS, and since 
the tables do not have a permanent home address, the page three vector 
table includes these directions for finding them. 

Egad, There's More. The final vector in the page three table, call 
1002, carries you to the subroutine inside DOS that reconnects DOS to 
the I/O links. Any time DOS becomes disconnected from the I/O links it 
will cease to function. Even a simple catalog command will give you a 



syntax error. To reconnect DOS in this situation you need only call 1002. 

Another way to use this vector is with the Monitor command 3EAG 
control-C. This is an alternate way to get back to Basic after an old 
Monitor reset. It has the advantage of not turning off any mon settings 
you may have made, which the DOS warm start does. 

There is one other way many programs use the page three vector ta- 
ble. That is to find the location of DOS itself or to confirm that the pro- 
gram is running on an Apple with at least 48K of memory. 

The standard procedure for this is to peek at location 978 ($3D2). If 
the value stored at this location is less than 157 ($9D), it indicates that the 
computer being used has less than 48K of memory. If the value at byte 
978 is equal to 157, the computer has at least 48K and DOS is in its nor- 
mal location. 

If the value at byte 978 is greater than 157, you have at least 48K of 
memory to play with, but look for Uncle DOS in the language card area. 

Monitoring the Monitor on Our Monitor. Linguists like to belittle 
computer terms such as "input" and "output." Talking about comput- 
ers would be a little easier, however, if we came up with more words like 
these that have specific meanings. Instead we seem to pick out some mel- 
low-sounding word and use it for everything. "Monitor" is a good 
example. 

First we have the Apple operating system we've been talking about. 
That's the Monitor. Then we have the televisionlike screen you look at. 
Apple likes to call that a monitor too. And then, of course, there's the 
DOS mon command, which also means — you guessed it — monitor. 

Mon lets you watch some types of information flowing between DOS 
and your program. Normally this particular type of information doesn't 
appear on your dingbat. 

The information consists of commands your program sends to 
DOS — the ones that begin with a control-D; input from the disk to your 
program that is associated with a read or exec command; and output 
from your program to the disk that is associated with a write command. 

DOS lets you choose to monitor any combination of commands, in- 
put, and output. The circumstances under which you would want only 
one or two of these and not all of them are quite limited. According to 
the DOS manual, the proper syntax for the mon command is 

MON C,l,0 

The C, I, and O parameters may be given in any combination or or- 
der. Some genius long ago discovered that DOS doesn't really care if you 
type the commas or the space with this particular command. Since by 
dropping them and reversing a couple of the parameters we can make 
this command both pronounceable and something other than monitor, 
let's call it monico. 

Debugging the Debug Bug. The chief use for monico is debugging 
your programs. It allows you to chaperone DOS and Basic as they dance 
together. 

You can turn off monico with nomonico. Turning monico off al- 
lows DOS and Basic to dance a little faster and keeps all kinds of stuff" off 
the screen that could confuse a user of your program. 

Uncle DOS seems to enjoy sneaking off unchaperoned. Nomonico is 
the natural state of DOS. Programmers using monico sometimes have 
trouble with it. The problem is that it mysteriously gets turned off al- 
most as fast as they can turn it on. 

The culprit here is the nomonico that DOS does automatically every 
time it is warm or cold-started. This means every time you press reset on 
newer Apples (common when debugging programs) or do an fp or int or 
three-dog, monico will be nomonicoed. 

If this bugs you, spray the following pokes into DOS: 

'POKE -25129,234 
POKE -25128,234 
POKE -25127,234 

The value 234 is the machine language code for NOP (no operation).

In the last few issues, we've examined programs that use analytical 
tools to help investors make decisions. But sometimes other elements 
must be accounted for or included in the decision-making process. These 
range from income sheltering and maintaining a balanced portfolio to 
plain emotion (often called "profit taking" or "loss cutting," depending 
on how an investment has performed). 

Each investor has different reporting needs. One may require only a 
capital-gains calculation to use in figuring income tax, while another may 
want a full running summary of portfolio status. An investor who wants 
a fair amount of portfolio status information may want to consider pur- 
chasing a stock portfolio accounting system. 

The value of a portfolio accounting system is twofold. First, it sim- 
plifies and structures record keeping. Second, it processes portfolio in- 
formation quickly and accurately and provides valuable reports. These 
reports are a help in computing tax liability, making buy or sell deci- 
sions, and tracking the performance of overall portfolios and individual 
securities. 

In this issue, we'll examine such a portfolio accounting system — 
Smith Micro Software's Stock Portfolio System.

The Stock Portfolio System (SPS) is designed to provide reports that 
will help investors manage their portfolios. But what is a portfolio? To 
some of us it is one, two, or three stocks. But are stocks all? No. In addi- 
tion to stocks, a portfolio can contain bonds, money market funds, and 
options. SPS can account for all of these securities; many of the other 
portfolio accounting packages on the market can't. So if you're holding a 
diverse portfolio and haven't been able to find a package that can ac- 
count for your various securities, SPS may be for you. 

SPS is menu-driven. From the main menu you have access to three 
secondary menus. The first of these allows you to enter buy, sell, and set- 
tlement information, deposits, and so on to the database; the second en- 
ables you to initialize data disks, start databases, and so on; and the third 
is the report section. 

A fourth choice available on the main menu is the Dow Jones termi- 
nal mode. SPS's rudimentary terminal program allows the user to log 
on to Dow Jones automatically and then to use the Apple as a dumb 
terminal. This terminal program is a nice feature, but for the heavy user 
of the nonquote databases on Dow Jones, a dedicated terminal program 
with a memory buffer and disk storage of received information is 
preferable. 

Unique functions that SPS provides are the ability to print out re- 
ports, by either calendar year or fiscal year, to set margin requirements 
used in your various trading accounts, and to supply your own effective 
tax rate for ROI calculations. 

Once program installation has been taken care of, the investor is 



ready to start building the portfolio data files. The first thing to do is to 
initialize a data disk using the utilities that are included in the SPS pack- 
age. These utilities allow you to do data disk initialization, database cre- 
ation, new-year carry-forward (for tax purposes), and data disk backup. 

SPS requires the investor to initialize all data disks using the SPS ini- 
tialization utility. Disks that have been initialized using init will have to 
be reinitialized. 

When SPS initializes a disk, it stores the present year's date, which 
will appear on all S/'5-generated reports. It's a good idea, suggests the 
author, to note the year on the disk label. 

The database-creation utility builds the database format for a port- 
folio file. The initial database is built using all the transactions or invest- 
ments to date excluding options. Options are added later via the options- 
entry sequence on the update menu. If information is being entered 
after the beginning of the taxable year, the investor can enter all pre- 
vious closed-out transactions as sells. SPS will assume that all current 
holdings are settled (paid for). 

SPS prompts you to supply not only security information such as 
price, date bought, number of shares, and commission costs, but ac- 
counting information. The program can track the open balance in mul- 
tiple disbursement accounts — money market, certificate of deposit (or 
CD), checking, and so on — and up to three different margin accounts. 
Margin account number one is dedicated to stock purchases that have a 
50-percent-margin requirement. Accounts two and three are provided for 
bond purchases, where margin requirements may vary. 

The new-year-carry-forward utility is used at the close of the year to 
transfer all the active securities to a new database. All the current year 
dividend fields are cleared to zero. The existing dividend balance is 
summed to the prior year dividend balance and then brought forward as 
prior year dividends. All the monthly interest income and expense fields 
are also cleared to zero. The carry-forward utility does not overwrite the 
existing database; instead it transfers active information forward to a 
new data file. 

The SPS backup utility does two things. It makes a backup copy of 
your database and it purges all deleted records in the process. The purg- 
ing feature helps keep SPS data disk usage to a minimum, increasing the 
number of securities that can be maintained on a data disk. 

Portfolio Update. The SPS portfolio databases are updated using 
the routines listed on the update menu. The update module is not loaded 
into memory during the initial boot. When the user selects this module, 
the disk drive is activated and the module loaded. 

SPS offers seven update functions. The transactions processed in this 
module are new security purchases, security sales, dividends received, 
bond interest recdved, stock splits or dividends, cash account /margin up- 
dates, options-transactions processing, and security-closing-date proc- 
essing. The program prompts the investor to supply all the required in- 
formation for the particular transaction being handled. 

The record maintenance feature is also accessible from this menu. 
Having selected records maintenance mode, the investor can modify any 
of the information provided during database creation, purge records, 



JUNE 1983

post margin account interest expense, and print out a detailed ticker- 
symbol list of the securities carried in the database. 

Two interesting features of SPS are the way it processes closing in- 
formation and how it handles options. 

Investors who purchase or sell securities normally have five to seven 
days before payment is made to the broker. (This process is known as 
closing.) SPS prompts the investor to tell it where the funds are to be 
drawn from. If a purchase is made on margin, the program checks the 
margin account equity for sufficient fiands. If sufficient equity is not avail- 
able to pay for the purchase, SPS automatically checks the primary 
money market fund for the balance needed. If the necessary funds aren't 
available in the money market account, the system issues a message tell- 
ing the investor how much money is due the broker. 

SPS is designed to handle options purchases, options sales, and the 
writing of options on your own securities. If you write an option, the pro- 
gram finds out how many shares you own of the underlying security. If 
that number of shares is insufficient to support the writing of the option, 
SPS will not process the transaction. 

Portfolio Reports. Everything discussed so far regarding SPS — da- 
tabase creation, updating, and maintenance — is performed to support 
the report capabilities of the program. 

The portfolio reports/status menu is activated by selecting option 
number three on the main menu. Like the update module, this module is 
not loaded into memory during the initial boot. Once the user selects the 
option, the disk drive is activated and the module loads in twenty to 
twenty-five seconds. 

To produce reports reflecting the current value of the portfolio, the 
most recent prices of the securities in the portfolio must be entered. The 
investor may enter these prices manually, getting them from the local 
newspaper, the Wall Street Journal, or Barron's, or may fetch them auto- 
matically from Dow Jones. 

During the quotes update, all options records are reviewed and up- 
dated. If an option you wrote has expired, the underlying securities rec- 
ord will be updated to reflect its new, unencumbered status. SPS also 
checks to see if any securities were due to be closed on or before the date 
you're running the report. If so, and the process close option on the up- 
date menu has not been run, you'll be instructed to run it before pro- 
ceeding. This must be done to ensure that the proper margin and cash 
balances are being maintained. The author refers to this as maintaining 
the "financial integrity of the database." A very apt description. 

Assuming that the investor made all the required entries to the data- 
base through the update menu and then posted the latest quotes through 
the quote entry routines at the beginning of this module, the SPS re- 
ports are ready to run. The reports can be printed to the screen or routed 
to a printer for hard copy. Certain reports show different information on 
the display than they do in the hard-copy format. We'll note these differ- 
ences on a report-by-report basis. 

The seven SPS reports cover current portfolio status, individual se- 
curity status, tax year profit and loss, dividend income, interest income/ 
expense, long-term status, and dividend/bond interest-due status. 

Current Portfolio Status. This is a comprehensive listing of the port- 
folio's current components, showing current market value, margin, and 
money market account status where applicable (see exhibit 1). The hard- 
copy reports include a percent-change column. When the report is dis- 
played on-screen, the investor is warned that an option is thirty days or 
less away from expiration. This warning message is not displayed on the 
printed report, however. 

The second part of the current portfolio status report is the cash ac- 
count status report (see exhibit 2). This report shows the current balance 
for all cash accounts maintained by SPS. 

Individual Security Status. This report shows all the pertinent data 
available on a given security. If you've bought the same security more 
than once, you can specify which transaction you want displayed, that all 
transactions be displayed, or that a composite average of all the holdings 
be computed and displayed. If an option has been written against the se- 
curity, the option information is shown. SPS computes and displays the 
current or actual return on the investment, depending on whether the se- 
curity is sold. The estimated gain or loss after taxes is also computed and 
shown on-screen.

Tax Year Profit and Loss Report. This report is used to compute 
your federal income tax liability on your stock transactions. See exhibit 3. 

Dividend Income Report. This function generates a year-to-date divi- 
dend report. The investor may choose either a summary or a detail re- 
port. The summary report compresses all payments into a single line dis- 
play per stock record. The detail report displays each payment. The in- 
formation included on the report is the date paid (if detail, each date; if 
summary, the last date paid), the amount paid, the stock name, and the 
total dividends paid within the reporting year (fiscal or calendar), as of 
the date of the report. 

Interest Income/Expense Report. This report can also be generated 
in either a summary or a detail format. The interest expense is derived 
from the margin accounts. Interest income is computed from all inter- 
est-bearing securities carried in the portfolio (cash, bonds, CDs, and so 
on). The income and expenses are displayed in monthly totals, with an 
annual total also shown. 

The results of this report must be posted manually to the database 
through the update menus for both income and expenses. This menu 
choice also generates an interest-income-by-account report that shows 
the source of interest income, the amount paid to date, and the total in- 
terest paid to date. 

Long-Term Status. This report displays any investments that will go 
long term within the next thirty days. The report can be used to help in- 
vestors fine-tune their investment strategies to meet a targeted tax 
position. 

Dividend/ Bond Interest Due Status. This report gives the investor a 
complete list of all dividends and bond interest due within the next thirty 
days. It is useful in planning cash flow and position. 

Overall. Overall, the Smith Stock Portfolio System is a good pro- 
gram. The system processes information at an acceptable speed and the 
reports and screens it generates are nicely laid out. 

The system could stand improvement in some areas. On one of the 
screens, when new information was presented, not all the old informa- 
tion was erased, which made the screen a little hard to read. In addition,

Exhibit 3. 







the documentation, while accurate, could be slightly more comprehen- 
sive, explaining the subtleties of the system a little more fully. For 
example, if you're entering the ticker symbol of a stock to generate a 
report, you have to press return to show the computer you're finished. 



This is fairly standard. But if you're prompted for a Y or N response, 
you don't have to press return. If you do, and you're in the report sec- 
tion using the display, the report will be written to the screen and then 
erased because the program interprets that carriage return as your signal 
that you're through looking at the report. 

It would also be preferable if the hard-copy reports contained the 
same information as the display, since many people tend to use hard 
copy instead of the video display for stock reports. The way the system is 
set up right now, users relying exclusively on hard copy miss the valu- 
able option-expiration warnings that SPS issues. 

Moving backward through the menu structure is achieved by means 
of control-C; most programs use the escape key. As this is becoming a 
fairly standard convention, it would be nice to see it incorporated into 
SPS. The control-C works the same way, but many people hesitate to 
use it because they're afraid it will cause a break in the program's execu- 
tion (control-C is a standard "break" or halt character in Applesoft). 

The program should also allow the investor to automatically post in- 
terest income and expenses to the database after using the interest in- 
come and expense report as an edit list. Unfortunately, we human beings 
have a tendency to make input errors that can significantly affect the 
portfolio evaluation reports. 

A pet peeve: Some error messages you may get when you run the 
program refer you to the DOS manual. It's been said before and bears 
repeating: A program should be completely self-documenting. It should 
not refer you to another manual. 

SPS is a good accounting tool. The author appears to be receptive to 
the suggestions of users. The second edition is a quantum jump in fea- 
tures and functionality over the initial release, and based on this it's rea- 
sonable to expect that the program will continue to improve as it ma- 
tures. The author charged a minimal fee to his existing users when the 
second edition was released, and this policy will almost certainly hold in 
the future. SPS is definitely a program that diversified investors should 
see. It has the potential to make the world they live in a little simpler. JM

BV ROE R. ADAHS III 




Still Ahead of H/s Time 



e called it the Model One. It con- 
sisted of two large racks of electri- 
cal relays, each eight feet tall, five feet across, and a foot thick. Its mem- 
ory was one thirty-second of one kilobyte, enough to store about five 
words. It cost twenty thousand dollars to build. 

It is U.S. patent number 2,668,661, the world's first binary comput- 
er, registered in 1939 to Dr. George Stibitz. 
Today George Stibitz uses an Apple. 

Seventy-nine and Going Strong. "Boring and unproductive" is Sti- 
bitz's assessment of retiranent, so he has no part of it. At seventy-nine, 
he's hard at work at Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, New 
Hampshire. As professor emeritus of physiology, he's involved in ex- 
panding the horizons of modem medicine, assisting on several difficult 
projects concurrently. 

Multitasking isn't a new experience for Stibitz. During the past for- 
ty-six years, in addition to his regular work, he's had more than fifty 
books and articles published. His expertise has not gone unnoticed. In 
1974, he was selected to write the entire thirty-three-page history of 
mathematics for the fifteenth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. 

A graduate of Denison University wath a Ph.B. in applied mathe- 
matics and of Cornell with a Ph.D. in physics, George Stibitz wasn't al- 
ways an inventor. His revolutionary computer was his solution to a 
problem he observed at Bell Labs, where he was involved in studying the 
magneto-mechanics of telephone relays. 

In 1937, the telephone company was starting to use complex num- 
bers, which involve the concept of /; / is the square root of minus one. 
Values for filters and transmission lines were all expressed in terms of 
complex numbers and Ma Bell employed thirty people full time to do 
complex number operations using desk calculators. Complex division 
with those bulky calculators was quite a chore; ten separate operations 
were required to do one division. 

Appalled by the sheer waste of time required to perform those man- 
ual operations, Stibitz began looking for ways to shorten the process. It 
occurred to him that the relays he was working with might hold the so- 
lution to the problem. Each of the electrical relays was five inches long 
and an inch and a half wide, a long way from the size of a modern chip. 
Stibitz believed that, if it could use binary notation, a calculator could be 
built using the telephone relays. 

Stibitz had studied binary notation in school, in Crystal's Algebra, 
the book that had popularized the concept. George Boole, developer of 
Boolean algebra, had originated the binary system in the 1850s. 

Binary notation involves the expression of numbers in either 0 or 1 
format. The number 43, for example, is written as 101011. Since the re- 
lays used by the telephone company were either on or off, binary suited 
the relays perfectly. On became 1, and off was 0. 

Brain Food. Working at home on his kitchen table, Stibitz experi- 
mented with the idea of building a primitive logic machine using the tele- 



phone relays. The initial problem was just getting two integer numbers to 
add together and to have the answer represented by the states of two 
light bulbs. One plus one equals ten in binary, so only the left bulb 
should light. Two plus one equals binary eleven, so both bulbs should 
light. 

When Stibitz got his home model working, he took it to his boss at 
Bell Labs. Despite being impressed by the machine's potential, the man- 
ager wondered if any machine could ever handle anything as sophisti- 
cated as complex numbers. During that period, it was generally thought 
that, though machines were all right for simple numbers, only humans 




could understand anything as abstract as complex numbers. 

The Model One started operations in 1939. Stibitz felt confident us- 
ing the relays; the failure rate for the contacts on each relay was a micro- 
scopic one in ten-to-the-minus-eleventh power. With its thirty-two-byte 
(not kilobyte) memory, the computer could store six eight-digit numbers 
at one time. To relate that to an Apple, consider that, if you had that 
much memory left for text in your word processor, you'd be able to store 
about five average words. 

But the Model One was impressive at the time. The workers could in- 
put the numbers in standard digital notation via regular telephone tele- 
typewriters. The computer used a basic two-by-two matrix to determine 
complex values. The left bank of relays coped with values of i, while the 
right bank did the integer calculations. Once each side was resolved, the 
two banks were integrated. The machine took care of translating the an- 
swers back into digital form for the people to read. In business, the ma- 
chine was considered a great success: It cut the daily process- 



George Stibitz gazes into an electron microscope surrounded by the scope's meters and readouts. Stibltz is working on a voice board to 
have an Apple read the meters out loud so that the researcher can give full attention to what's happening on the other side of the eyepiece. 



ing time by two-thirds. 

Distinguished Admirers. Tiie scientific community had yet to be 
reciconed with. When the New England Math Society gathered at Dart- 
mouth University in September 1940 for its annual meeting, Stibitz took 
the opportunity to present his computer. He set up a remote communi- 
cation between the computer in New York City and a teletypewriter be- 
ing operated in Hanover, New Hampshire. The computer's ability to 
perform complex number operations astounded the distinguished at- 
tendees at the conference. 

The significance of the operation being performed remotely via tele- 
phone lines, however, attracted little notice from the mathematicians. 
Yet Stibitz's remote presentation was, in fact, the birth of telecommuni- 
cation. Eventually, his colleagues did take note: At a similar meeting in 
1977, Stibitz became the first recipient of the IEEE Emanuel R. Piore 
Award for outstanding achievement in the field of information 
processing. 

Only one Model One was built. Stibitz immediately began work on 
the Model Two. He was convinced that a computer could handle poly- 
nomials and general algebraic equations, and the new computer would 
serve as his research lab. But the Model Two was to take a different 
route. 

There is no time for pure research when the world is at war. Every 
project's existence depends on its ability to support the war effort. At the 
beginning of World War II Stibitz was loaned to the Navy for a top-se- 
cret project: to design a machine that could perform ballistic calcula- 
tions and control antiaircraft fire automatically. 

The Model Two became that machine. In the process, necessity bore 
unexpected offspring: error trapping and the use of punched tape. Sti- 
bitz designed the computer to take in and put out the ballistic data via 
punched tape. The machine received the raw data from a radar installa- 
tion tracking a target, analyzed it, and determined a smooth curve — 
something the infant radar couldn't produce. 



Recognizing erroneous data, the Model Two would throw it out and 
use trigonometry to determine correct flight patterns. It performed the 
averaging in a mathematical atmosphere simulating three-dimensional 
space. The output was then used to control antiaircraft guns 
automatically. 

Twenty-five-Grand Second Try. Naturally, the Model Two re- 
quired much more memory than the One to perform such functions, and 
it had it — nearly twice as much: one-twentieth of one kilobyte. By the 
time Stibitz completed it in 1943, the Model Two — at a cost of twenty- 
five thousand dollars — sported other improvements over the Model One. 
By design, a cluster of Teletype printers and tape punchers used for out- 
put enabled the computer to run unattended more than 80 percent 
of the time. 

"To process a large run, we just turned on the computer Friday eve- 
ning," Sfibitz remembers. "When we came in Monday morning, there 
was a wastebasket or two filled with tape printout." The high-volume 
tape input led Stibitz to develop the now-familiar large-roll computer 
tapes. 

The Aircraft Artillery Board recognized immediately the importance 
of Stibitz's computer to the war effort — and it wanted an even better ma- 
chine. The Board commissioned Stibitz to build a sophisticated Model 
Three at an accelerated pace. Stibitz and thirty people assigned to the 
project completed the job in 1944. 

With a giant one-seventh-kilobyte memory, the Model Three actual- 
ly contained ballistic tables in memory. The computer could take the 
three-dimensional averaged data, compare it against the tables, and ad- 
just the antiaircraft guns. So sophisticated was the procedure that the 
guns could be accurately aimed to lead the planes, increasing greatly the 
success of this defense. 

The Model Three incorporated floating-point arithmetic and jump 
program instructions. The cost of building it soared to about one hun- 
dred thousand dollars. It was about to be put into general production 



when the war started winding down. 

Four for the Swabbies. Meanwhile, Stibitz had begun building the 
Model Four. Especially designed for the seagoing Navy, the Four could 
perform all the functions of the Model Three while on a moving ship. 
The science of ballistics gets complicated when the guns are not on firm 
ground. The ship's pitching and yawing posed a challenge, but Stibitz re- 
members only one serious problem: "It was the bell that the Navy in- 
stalled above the watch officer's desk. Every time the computer went 
down, which happened frequently at first, it was the watch officer's re- 
sponsibility to jump up and go out to find out what had happened to it. 
Of course, as he had no computer experience, he could do nothing but 
stare at the machine until I got there." 

Just before the war ended, the government had Stibitz design a very 
large computer. The Model Five was comprised of ten thousand relays, 
had a full two kilobytes of memory, and resembled a telephone ex- 
change. The machine occupied a whole building and cost half a million 
dollars to build. 

After the war, Stibitz worked as a consultant in applied mathematics 
for both the government and the private sector. He developed the first 
electronic computer for commercial application in 1947 and worked on 
the development of the giant Edvac computer during the late forties. 
Later, he served on the National Research Council's Committee on 
Large-Scale Computers. 

In 1964, Stibitz joined Dartmouth Medical School. Using his inven- 
tiveness and his unique perspective as an applied mathematician, Stibitz 
has assisted in many medical breakthroughs. He did much of the origi- 
nal computer analysis of dosage levels for radioactive implants in 1967. 
The following year, he designed a random gate computer for biomedical 
applications and developed a computer model for biological networks. 
Among his recent achievements is the development of the technique 
needed to measure the rate of diffusion through the slits in the body's 
capillary walls. 

Synthesized Mathematicians. Applied mathematics is a rare disci- 
pline — a special way of thinking. Applied mathematicians are synthe- 



sizers; they can perceive relationships among widely scattered facts across 
many scientific fields. This special kind of thinking is well illustrated in 
an incident that occurred recently in Stibitz's work. A resident pharma- 
cologist had a problem with binding chemicals to molecular blood plas- 
ma. Although the pharmacologist had compiled large amounts of data, 
he had not been able to determine the binding coefficients. 

"When I started analyzing all that data, familiar patterns began to 
emerge," Stibitz remembers. "I recalled some work I had done for a met- 
allurgist who was trying to bond different metals. It turned out that the 
methodology that solved the metallurgist's problem was exactly the same 
as that needed for the pharmacologist's problem." 

Perhaps nothing has changed more over the years than the comput- 
ers Stibitz uses in his work. Today, George Stibitz uses an Apple. 

A project he's pursuing with Dr. Frances McCann involves electron 
microscopic biology. At the level of visual amplification attained with an 
electron microscope, things move extremely fast. State-of-the-art equip- 
ment requires that the experimenter constantly switch attention between 
the dials and the microscope. 

Stibitz and McCann are changing the state of the art, using a voice 
board in the Apple to provide information about the sample's environ- 
ment aurally to experimenters, enabling them to concentrate on what 
they are observing'' Without missing vital changes in the sample's 
situation. 

Not long ago. Bill Budge played a role in a Stibitz project, this one 
with Dr. Miguel Marin-Dadilla. For years, doctors had been studying 
two disfinct microscopic brain cells. One cell was referred to as a basket 
cell; the other was a double-tufted cell. The two cells bore little resem- 
blance to each other. 

Marin-Dadilla was convinced that the two cells were really one. He 
speculated that what everyone was seeing were two planes of the same 
cell: one view of the top and one view of the side. But the theory was im- 
possible to verify under an electron microscope; the preparation of the 
slide required slicing the cell, and as soon as the cell was sliced, the sec- 
ond perspective vanished!

His invention of the Model One computer in 1937 recently earned Stibitz a place in the National Inventors' Hall of Fame. Built from telephone 
relays, the Model One was the first computer to use the concept of Boolean algebra, translating numbers from decimal to binary and back 
again. These days Stibitz and his wife Dorothea program their grocery shopping on an Apple. 



Budging It. Stibitz solved the mystery. Using Bill Budge's i-Z) Graph- 
ics Package, Stibitz entered all the data into his Apple. The Apple re- 
sponded by producing a graphic three-dimensional view of the brain cell. 
The rotating option allowed Stibitz to demonstrate conclusively the va- 
lidity of Marin-Dadilla's theory. 

Stibitz's medical research continues on his Apple at home. Working 
with Dr. Marsh Tanney, an expert on respiration, Stibitz is developing a 
mathematical model of silkworm respiration. 

During his rich life, Dr. George Stibitz has earned thirty-four pat- 
ents on his inventions. But it took just one of these inventions, officially 
registered as "Complex Computer" — the Model One — and forty-four 
years for the world to recognize publicly and specifically the achieve- 
ments of this very special man. 

On February 13, 1983, George Stibitz was inducted into the Nation- 
al Inventors' Hall of Fame. The Hall, started in 1973 by the Federal Pat- 
ent and Trademark Office, honors inventors who have a U.S. patent rep- 
resenting a significant contribution to the welfare of the people of the 
United States. 

Stibitz joins inventors Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, the 
Wright Brothers, Eli Whitney, Henry Ford, and not many others in the 
Hall of Fame. Like the inventions of each of these men, George Stibitz's 
invention changed the world; from the binary computer a new era is 
emerging. 

It seems that much of the media would like us to think of the com- 
puter age as the realm of the very young. It isn't. Few people have inte- 
grated computers so completely, easily, and comfortably into their lives 
as George Stibitz and his wife Dorothea. They don't chatter about all the 
things their Apple can do — they use it. For work, for learning, for daily 
living. 

Saturday mornings find the Stibitzes together at the Apple planning 
their weekly shopping. Stibitz has written a program that displays every 
item in the grocery store they frequent, aisle-by-aisle, showing the prod- 



ucts exactly as they sit on the shelves. The Stibitzes browse through their 
electronic supermarket making selections. When they're finished, the 
computer totals up the prices of their choices and prints out a flow chart 
for shopping. 

Other members of the household are avid Apple observers, at least 
when it's running the shopping program. 

"The minute the printer stops printing on Saturday mornings, our 
two dogs b^in racing around the room. They know it is time to go for a 
car ride to the grocery store!" 

Dorothea Stibitz, an accomplished cellist and choir singer, uses the 
Apple for her music, practicing at home with the help of the MicroMu- 
sic package. Recently, the Apple came in handy when her choir group se- 
lected an atonal Bartok piece. Dorothea found some of the music jumps 
difficult to follow. Her husband, who has composed music in the past, 
input the Bartok piece into the Apple; then she was able to learn the 
parts easily. 

Although he no longer composes, George Stibitz enters his favorite 
pieces into the music system and enjoys listening to the Apple's rendi- 
tions. He also uses the Apple in research for graphic relief mapping. Just 
now, he's excited about trading in his old Apple II for a He. 

When Stibitz built his Model One forty-four years ago, he wasn't 
looking for glory or setting out to create a world-shaking invention. He 
was merely attacking an office problem with every tool available to him 
and solving it the best way he knew how. 

Not all of us can invent new computers or change the way the medi- 
cal world looks at brain cells. But, thanks to Stibitz — and Babbage and 
Burroughs and Wozniak — we have a marvelous tool with which to at- 
tack our daily problems, to solve them, and generally to make our lives 
simpler and richer. 

That's what Stibitz was after at Bell Labs, and what he's after on Sat- 
urday mornings. 

Let's take the hint.

kyl)(m;^l'arlsloii 



Last month we outlined an educational program called Flash Card, 
which could be a useful tool for memorizing a large number of defini- 
tions, such as when one is learning a foreign language. We suggested that 
people try to work from the outline to create their own Applesoft pro- 
grams — after all, even if you know all the vocabulary in the world, the 
only way to learn any foreign language is by trying to speak it. 

This month, we are going to work through one solution. It is not the 
only solution or even necessarily the best one; just as there are a thou- 
sand ways to express a single concept in English, so there are at least a 
thousand ways to program any routine in Applesoft. The important 
thing is that you understand how to tackle such an assignment — how to 
break it down into manageable pieces, program the pieces, and then as- 
semble them into a single, functioning whole. 

Let's start out by converting last month's outline into a main menu 
routine for our new program. It might look like this: 

20 GOTO 500 

497 REM 

498 REM *** MAIN MENU *"

600,700,700,900,1000,1100,1200 
590 NEXT : GOTO 560 

Now let's take a look at what we did. First of all, we left a little room 
at the very b^inning of the program to define permanent variables, 
dimension arrays, and the like. Then we jumped all the way down to line 
500, where we put the main menu routine, since it's a good idea to 
reserve a couple of hundred lines near the beginning of a program for fre- 
quently used subroutines (they run faster if they are close to the begin- 
ning of the program). 

Line 500 calls the first of the subroutines that we will write, a short se- 
quence that will put a title at the top of the page so that the program user 
can always tell what's going on. 

Lines 510 through 550 just print the outline on the screen, using in- 
verted text for the section headers. Then lines 560 through 590 use a 
branching routine that we have called on before to send program con- 
trol off to the various functions listed in the outline. 

Next let's add that title-printing subroutine: 



49 REM * PRINT TITLE * 

50 POKE 34,0: HOME : PRINT K" WORDS": VTAB 2:L 
HTAB 20 - L/2: INVERSE : PRINT A$: NORMAL : 
POKE 34,2: RETURN 



= LEN (A$): 
PRINT : 



Let's see how this works. Poke 34, as you may remember, sets the top 
window on the text page. When address 34 is set to 0, you can move all 
the way to the top of the screen, using a command like home. When it is 
set to a number between 1 and 23, the top window border is moved 
down the screen, and anything printed above this border is protected — in 
other words, it won't disappear if you type home or type fifty lines of 
code. Only the area within the window will scroll when you hit the 
bottom of the page. 

In this subroutine, the number of flash cards entered into the pro- 
gram to date is printed in the upper-right-hand portion of the screen and 
a title is printed in the center of the next line down. The window is then 
lowered to protect the top two lines with a poke 34,2. This keeps the title 
line from scrolling off the screen accidentally. 

The htab formula is just a very simple way of centering any string on 
the page. Basically, all you do is tab to the middle of the screen (20) and 
then back up half the length of the string you are printing. In order to use 
this subroutine, just load A$ with any title you choose (no longer than 
forty characters) and gosub 50. 

Let's move on. The first item on the main menu that we will want to 
write is the add-to-list section. Writing this part first will allow us to add 
words and their definitions to the storage arrays so that we have some 
data to test the program with as we go along. Testing as you develop a 
program is very important, since even the keenest mind may not always 
be associated with nimble fingers. If you have entered as much of the 
program as we have discussed thus far, try it. Run it. You can't do any 
harm, and if you've typed anything in incorrectly, you'll find out in a 
hurry. 

Here's the data-entry part of the program. Note that we had to di- 
mension some arrays in order to store our data: 

10 DIM ENG$(1000),FR$(1000),WRNG%(1000):D$ = CHR$ (13) + 
CHR$ (4) 

600 HOME : IF 81$ = ""THEN GOSUB 30: REM ** A(DD TO LIST" 
605 A$ = "ADD VOCABULARY": GOSUB 50 
610 PRINT S1$;: INPUT ": ";A$: IF A$ = "" THEN 500 
620 ENG$(K) = A$: PRINT : PRINT S2$;: INPUT ": ";A$: IF A$ = "" 
THEN 500 

630 FR$(K) = A$:K = K + 1: PRINT : PRINT : GOTO 610 

First we set up two arrays capable of holding up to 1 ,000 words or 
phrases each (and since this was originally intended as a vocabulary 
builder for foreign-language study, the arrays got named ENG$ for Eng- 
lish and FR$ for French). We also set up a parallel integer array called 
WRNG% to let us keep track of the ones we guess wrong. 

The add-vocabulary routine itself is simplicity exemplified. 

Line 600 checks to make sure we have identified the data file we are 
working with (if we haven't, the variable Sl$ won't have been defined 
yet, and so we will be shipped off to the subroutine at line 30 to com- 



114 



JUNE 1983 



plete the necessary preliminary work). 

Line 605 sets up the title for the section. Line 610 is the beginning of 
the section that accepts words and their definitions. Imagine that you are 
dealing with flash cards. The variable Sl$ represents the label for what 
you put on one side of the card. S2$ represents the label for the second 
side of the card. If you were learning French, Sl$ could be "English" 
and S2$ could be "French." In that case, line 610 would print on the 
screen: 

ENGLISH: 

and would wait for your input. If you didn't enter a word at all but just 
pressed the return key, then line 610 would assume that you were fin- 
ished entering data and would transfer control to the main menu once 
again. 

Line 620 stores the information you entered into the array ENG$(K), 
where K is a counter that keeps track of how many flash cards we have 
used. The line then prints the label for the flip side of the flash card and 
awaits input: 

ENGLISH: please 
FRENCH: 

Again, if you just press return without entering anything, the pro- 
gram assumes that you have finished entering data and returns control to 
the main menu. Otherwise, control drops to line 630, where your input is 
stored in FR$(K) and K is incremented. The program then loops back 
on itself, so that you can continue entering data until finished. 

Let's think about that subroutine at line 30 that picks out our labels 
(English and French in the example). For various reasons that will be- 
come clear only later (if at all), we not only want to load in the two la- 
bels, but we also want to record how long each label is and then pad out 
the shorter label with preceding blank spaces until both are the same 
length. This will make it easy to print word pairs that look like this: 

CLASSICAL GREEK: panta hrei 

ENGLISH: all things are in flux 



instead of like this: 

CLASSICAL GREEK: panta hrei 
ENGLISH: all things are in flux 

Now how could anybody pass up a stylistic improvement like that! 
Anyway, here is the routine: 

29 REM ** NAME DISK FILE ** 

30 PRINT "ENTER SIDE 1 LABEL (E.G. ENGLISH)": PRINT "OR 
< RETURN > TO SEE DISK CATALOG": PRINT : INPUT ": ";S1$: 
IF LEN (S1$) > 15 THEN S1$ = LEFTS (S1$,15) 

32 IF LEN (S1$) = 0 THEN PRINT D$"CATALOG": PRINT : GOTO 30 
30 L1$ = LEFTS (S1$ 1) 

35 PRINT : PRINT "ENTER SIDE 2 LABEL": PRINT : INPUT ": ";S2S: 
IF LEN (S2S) > 15 THEN S2S = LEFTS (S2$,15) 

36 L2$ = LEFT$(S2S,1):L1 = LEN (S1$):L2 = LEN (S2S):LN = 
LI * (LI < L2) + L2 * (L2>= LI) 

37 IF LI < L2THEN FOR X = 1 TO L2 - L1:S1$ = "" + SIS: NEXT 

38 IF L2 < LI THEN FOR X = 1 TO LI - L2:S2$ = " " + S2$: NEXT 

39 HOME : RETURN 

There are those who will feel that this subroutine is needlessly com- 
plex. Nevertheless, let's take it apart and see what it does. Line 30 asks 
for the label for side one of the flash card. If the label is longer than 
fifteen characters, it shortens it to fifteen characters. 

Line 32 checks to make sure you entered a label. If you just pressed 
return, it prints the disk catalog and then jumps back to the beginning of 
the subroutine. 

Line 33 takes the first letter in the label stored in Sl$ and stores it in 
LIS. For example, if Sl$ were "English," then LIS would be set equal 
to "E." 

Line 35 gets the label for side two of the flash card and truncates it to 
fifteen characters. Line 36 puts the first letter in the second label into L2$ 
and sets LI and L2 to the lengths of the two labels. LN is set equal to the 
longer of LI and L2, using logical operators. All of these values will be 
used in various screen formatting routines throughout the rest of the 
program.

JUNE 1983 



Lines 37 and 38 flesh out the shorter of the two labels with preceding 
blanks so that both end up the same length. 

The data-input section is now finished and ready for testing. How- 
ever, to test it fully, we need to be able to view the array that we are try- 
ing to store our data in, just to be sure that everything is being put where 
we hope. Therefore, let's skip around a little bit and do the next-to-last 
section next, the one entitled "view list" in the main menu: 

1 100 KT = 0: HOME : IF K = 0 THEN VTAB 8: HTAB 1 1 : PRINT "NO 
WORDS IN MEMORY": GOSUB 60: GOTO 500 

1110 A$ = "VIEW VOCABULARY": GOSUB 50 

1120 PRINT : FOR X = 0 TO K - 1: PRINT S1$": "ENG$(X): PRINT 
S2$": "FR$(X):KT = KT + 1 : PRINT 

1130 IF KT = 6 THEN PRINT : GOSUB 60:KT = 0 

1140 NEXT : IF KT <> 0 THEN GOSUB 60 

1150 GOTO 500 

This section is very straightforward. KT is an internal counter used 
only in this section. Its purpose is to divide the vocabulary into groups of 
six. Whenever the counter reaches 6, line 1 130 jumps to a pause subrou- 
tine and resets the counter to 0. We need the pause subroutine to keep 
the entire vocabulary from scrolling by on the screen far faster than we 
could read it. 

Here's what the pause routine might look like: 

59 REM * PAUSE * 

60 VTAB 23: HTAB 8: INVERSE : PRINT "PRESS ANY KEY TO 
CONTINUE": NORMAL : WAIT - 16384,128: IF PEEK ( - 16384) 
= 155 THEN POKE - 16368,0: POP : GOTO 500 

61 POKE ^ 16368,0: VTAB 23: CALL - 868: RETURN 

We have used the wait command like this before. You could just as 
easily use a get A$ command — the only difference is that wait doesn't 
leave a flashing cursor on the screen. 

The end of line 60 should ring a few bells too. This is an escapw-hatch 
provision. Suppose that you have entered 943 vocabulary words and 
definitions into the program. You then tried to hit F to start the flash 



card routine, but your nimble fingers somehow struck the V by mistake. 
Are you to be consigned to viewing all 943 words, six at a time for the 
next five minutes? No! Of course not! We have built in a way out. All 
you have to do is press the escape key. 

A quick look at the Applesoft manual will tell you that escape is the 
same as CHR$(27) to the Apple. If you press escape, location —16384 in 
the Apple will read the ASCII code of the key you pressed, plus 128. In 
this case, that equals 27 -1- 128 or 155. If a quick peek at this location 
reveals a value of 155, we can back-door our way out of the subroutine 
by jumping directly to the menu at line 500. Before we do this, however, 
we had better remember to pop the subroutine return address off the 
stack, or else we are asking for trouble. (Remember, never leave a sub- 
routine except by way of a return statement — but if you must, as here, 
cancel the gosub return address by use of the pop command.) 

Enough of the program is finished now that we can really do some 
testing. If these two sections test out, we can move on to the next items 
on the agenda. Let's do the save-to-disk and load-from-disk routines 
next — it will save us from having to reenter a database every time we 
want to test another function of the program.: 

900 HOME :A$ = "READ DATA FROM DISK": GOSUB 50: REM "

1030 FOR X = 0 TO K - 1 : PRINT ENG$(X);",";FR$(X): GOTO 1035 
1035 NEXT 

1040 PRINT D$"GL0SE"S1$"-"S2$: GOTO 500 

Both of these routines are pretty simple. The first thing that we save 
out or read in is K, the number of flash cards we have created. Then we 
use K to write out or read in the correct number of entries into the two 

data arrays. 

For simplicity's sake, we won't let people choose the name of their 
data files. Instead we'll construct a file name made up of the labels for the 
two sides of the flash card, separated by a hyphen: English- French. 

The delete and edit sections of the program look suspiciously like the 
similarly named sections of the mailing list program we wrote a couple of 
months ago. Let's take this section one part at a time: 



700 

705 

706 
710 



712 

715 
716 



HOME : IF SI $ = "" THEN GOSUB 30: REM ** R(EM0VE FROM 

LIST ** 

IF AN = 2THEN A$ = "DELETE WORDS FROM LIST": GOSUB 
50: GOTO 710 

A$ = "EDIT WORDS IN LIST": GOSUB 50 
VTAB 5: HTAB 10: PRINT "SEARCH:": PRINT : PRINT 
TAB(12);L1$"(" RIGHTS (S1$,L1 - 1): PRINT TAB( 12);L2$"(" 
RIGHTS (S2$,L2 - 1): PRINT : PRINT 

GET A$: IF A$ <> L1$ AND A$ <> L2$ AND A$ <> CHR$ 
(13) THEN 710 

IF A$ = CHR$ (13) THEN 500 
C = 1: IF A$ = L2$ THEN 0 = 2 



Lines 700 through 706 check to see if we have a data file in memory; 
and, if we do, they then put the right title line up on the screen. The value 
AN is determined in line 580 of the main menu part of the program. If 
we selected the delete option, the second item on the menu, then AN will 
be equal to 2. If we selected edit, the third item on the menu, then AN 
will be equal to 3. If AN is equal to anything else, your computer is be- 
having irrationally and should be strictly reprimanded. 



Basically, the way both edit and delete function is this. First we de- 
sign a routine to find the vocabulary pair that needs working on. We do 
this by looking for a phrase or part of a phrase on one side of the flash 
card or the other. Then we jump to another routine that either deletes or 
edits that particular flash card. 

Lines 710 through 716 determine which side of the flash card to 
search. As usual, we have included an escape hatch in case you got into 
this routine by accident and want out. 

Once we have decided to search side A or side B, we need to find out 
what word or words we are looking for. We could write a very simple in- 
put routine that required us to enter the data precisely on any particular 
line and then searched for that. However, that is probably not a good 
idea, since the edit function will often be used to correct misspellings and 
the like, and it is often difficult to remember exactly how you misspelled 
a particular word. 



720 HTAB 12: INPUT 

725 FOR X = 0 TO K 

726 A$ = FR$(X) 

730 GOSUB 40: IF F = 0 THEN 750 



SEARCH FOR: ";l$: IF 1$ = "" THEN 500 
IF C = 1 THEN A$ = ENG$(X): GOTO 730 



Lines 720 to 740 set up two general variables — the search string, 1$, 
and the string to be searched, A$. We use a simple input statement to en- 
ter the search string from the keyboard. The searched string is chosen 
from side A or side B of the flash cards. We look at the appropriate side 
of each card, one at a time, until we find a match. For example, if our 
search string is "port," and we are looking on the English side of the fol- 
lowing flash cards, the program will select pair three: 

ENGLISH: carry 
FRENCH: porter 

ENGLISH: poor 
FRENCH: heureux 



The Ultimate Apple Disk Utilities 



The In$pector"and Watson 



The Inspector is one of the most valuable additions 
I have made to my Apple. I use it almost daily in 
repairing blown disks, editing files, and many other 
uses. There are other disk access utilities on the 
market, but almost all require a separate program 
to be run. The Inspector is always available and 
easily accessed when in ROM. Likewise, if the disk 
version is used, it is always available if you boot the 
modified DOS. The documentation is excellent, and 
the product is superb. Rating AA. (Disk $59 95) 
Watson greatly expands the potential of the Inspec- 



tor. The utilities of Watson are available in most 
cases through software, but from a variety of dif- 
ferent sources. Watson combines them all together 
in a convenient and powerful package that is always 
available. Since Watson must be used in conjunc- 
tion with the Inspector, the package as a whole 
must also be evaluated. Consequendy, since the 
routines provided by both the Inspector and Watson 
are so useful and the documentation clear and well 
done, the overall package must be considered as 
outstanding. Rating AA. (Disk $49 95)

The Schoolhouse Apple 

tv Jean Varven 




Fifty-three percent of all schools in the United States had at least one 
microcomputer for instructional use by January 1983, according to a na- 
tional study conducted by the Center for Social Organization of Schools 
at Johns Hopkins University. At the elementary level, micros are largely 
employed as "cost-effective means of increasing the rate at which stu- 
dents learn the rules of arithmetic computation and proper English us- 
age," and much of the software on the market reflects and supports this 
emphasis. Meanwhile, secondary schools, which have more microcom- 
puters than elementary schools, tend to use their micros to teach stu- 
dents about computers and to teach them how to program in Basic. So 
da elementary schools that have had computers for two or three years. 

In both elementary and secondary schools, according to the study, 
there's a consistent decline in microcomputer use for drill and practice 
and a parallel increase in microcomputer use for teaching programming 
as schools gain micro experience. This may be so, researchers suggest, be- 
cause schools that have experimented with using computers for drill and 
practice and for programming and instruction about computers have 
found the second approach more fruitful. Or perhaps timing had some- 
thing to do with it. Perhaps, "schools became disenchanted with the 
drill-and-practice software available at the time and have not ventured 
back to examine more recent software products that schools that more 
recently became microcomputer owners have been able to use at least 
somewhat successfully," the Hopkins study suggests. 

This thought-provoking information and more is contained in the 
first of a series of newsletters published by the Johns Hopkins group and 
funded by the National Institute of Education. The study being dis- 
cussed is based on a probability sample of more than twenty-two hun- 
dred public, private, and parochial elementary schools across the coun- 
try, and the newsletters are intended to communicate preliminary 
findings. 

As the Johns Hopkins researchers point out, plenty of us talk about 
how microcomputers affect students, teachers, and the educational proc- 
ess but few have scientifically investigated their impact. The researchers 
don't claim that their own survey is such an investigation; rather, its pur- 
pose was to find out from a representative sample of microcomputer-us- 
ing teachers what effects microcomputers have had on their schools. 

Most of the information on how micros are being used in the schools 
was obtained from individuals who had been identified as "the primary 
computer-using teacher" at each school. As of April 7, 68 percent of 
those surveyed had responded by completing an eighteen-page 
questionnaire. 

Many teachers reported that the main impact microcomputers have 
had is social. More enthusiasm for schooling, a greater tendency for stu- 
dents to work without a teacher, and more instances of students helping 
each other were among the trends mentioned. 

Future reports will address such questions as which people have most 
significantly influenced their school's acquisition of micros, how much 
micros are actually being used (and by whom), and how teachers deal 
with microcomputers in organizing instruction in the classroom setting. 
Other possible topics include what kinds of computer-related training 
computer-using teachers find essential. 

This kind of information is bound to be of considerable interest and 
real value to people who care about the use of computers in education. 
To find out more about the study or to be placed on the mailing list to re- 
ceive copies of this informative series of publications, contact Dr. Henry 
Jay Becker, Project Director, Center for Social Organization of Schools, 
The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218. 

The Future Is Now. It's refreshing to hear for a change about the 
positive effects microcomputers are having right now in education. More 



often, it seems, we're told only that knowing how to use computers (or 
not knowing how to use them) will make a difference in young people's 
careers and lives "later on." If it's true that microcomputers are helping 
students feel more motivated to learn, more capable of learning on their 
own, and more inclined to help each other, then micros are making a real 
difference in the present. And, it seems realistic to expect that they'll con- 
tinue to be a significant positive force in the future. 

The positive effect that computers can have on education and on how 
students see themselves makes one finding of the Johns Hopkins survey 
all the more disturbing. As previous studies have shown, lower-income 
public school districts are much less likely to have school microcomput- 
ers. The statistics the study obtained help bring this situation home. 
"Whereas two-thirds of public schools in the better-off districts have mi- 
crocomputers, only 41 percent of the schools in the least wealthy dis- 
tricts have any." 

One group that would like to see more equitable access to micro- 
computers is Technology Education Research Centers (TERC), a non- 
profit educational computing organization in Cambridge, Massachu- 
setts. Writing in the most recent issue of the group's quarterly publica- 
tion, Hands On!, TERC director Robert Tinker expressed concern over 
the fact that lower-income students, female students, and students with 
special needs often have very limited access to computers and computer- 
related instruction. 

In response to this situation. Tinker announced, TERC is forming an 
information clearinghouse on the equity issue. By establishing the clear- 
inghouse, TERC hopes to find out about relevant articles, individuals, 
and projects already addressing the problem. The group is also eager to 
establish contact with people who are thinking about the equitable dis- 
tribution of microcomputers and want to make it happen. 

The overall aim, explains Tinker, is to bring together people, ideas, 
and information in order to translate concern into constructive action. 
Consequenfly, the group is also interested in knowing how respondents 
might be willing to participate in an effort to improve the wide-scale ac- 
cess to microcomputers.

gard to this issue, write to Technology Education Research Centers, 8

California Apples and Maybe More. If the 1982 Technology in Edu- 
cation Act had passed, most of the schools in the country would prob- 
ably have at least one Apple by now. The bill, introduced by Oakland, 
California, congressman Fortney H. "Pete" Stark, would have allowed 
Apple Computer and other manufacturers to give micros to schools in 
return for a tax credit. Apple had pledged to donate some seventy-five 
thousand Apples to U.S. public and private primary and secondary 
schools if the bill went through. 

As most folks know, the 1982 bill languished in the lame-duck ses- 
sion of Congress and was never passed. But the issue is far from dead. 
According to David Beaver of Apple, HR 701, a federal bill "virtually 
identical to last year's bill," has been reintroduced by Pete Stark. Be- 
cause it is a tax bill, HR 701 will have to go through the Ways and Means 
Committee before it can move any further through the Illative proc- 
ess. Understandably, Apple and many others involved in educafion have 
high hopes that things will go better this time around. 

As it is, schools in California will be getting Apples from Apple any- 
way. Because of AB 3194, a California bill written by former assembly- 
man Chuck Imbrecht and signed into law by former governor Jerry 
Brown, Apple is gearing up to be able to put one computer in every pub- 
lic elementary, junior high, and high school in California and one in 
every tax-exempt private school with more than one hundred students

enrolled. State-certified private special-education schools and selected 
schools operated by county offices of education will also be eligible to 
benefit from the program. The only real restriction seems to be that the 
computer a school receives must stay in the school itself, rather than 
being moved into a district computer center or other off-site situation. 

After arrangements have been worked out with the various school 
districts, each of an estimated ninety-two hundred schools in California 
will be able to get a free He, with monitor and disk drive, along with Ap- 
ple Logo and other software direct from Apple. In addition, schools will 
get discount coupons from some twenty-five top vendors of Apple-com- 
patible products and special dealer support. 

As a recent fVall Street Journal article pointed out, a significant num- 
ber of schools that have computers are not using them very effectively, if 
at all. Some computers sit on the shelf, and some teachers that originally 
had high expectations about the difference computers would make now 
feel misled or disillusioned. The reasons for this situation vary. Some 
schools bought expensive hardware only to discover that it isn't what 
they really need and doesn't do what they thought it would. Some 
schools have computers but no money at all for software. Some have 
computers and software but no staff members with the information, 
guidance, and experience necessary to use them and to work with stu- 
dents effectively. And some schools that have a computer, some soft- 
ware, and some experience are still asking themselves in frustration, 
"What difference can a single computer possibly make to so many 
children?" 

Aware of these kinds of problems and concerned about teacher train- 
ing issues, Apple is making a real effort to handle its giveaway program 
responsibly. First, explains Apple Computer's Steve Scheier, the com- 
pany is sending letters to all eligible schools and educational institutions 
informing them of the program. And by the time the program is publi- 
cized, authorized Apple dealers at approximately one hundred sixty deal- 
er locations throughout California will be set up to offer initial orienta- 
tion and support to the new computer-owning schools. 



Apple has also arranged to distribute a number of helpful publica- 
tions to all participating schools. In addition to providing information 
about software, these publications will give teachers some suggestions 
about how to use the computer immediately in practical and useful ways. 

As Scheier describes it, Apple's California giveaway program is, in 
some ways, "a grand experiment." It's also, it seems, Apple's way of set- 
ting up a partnership with schools that should, in the long run, make a 
positive difference in the educational experiences of California kids. 

According to David Beaver, Apple is also looking at the California 
giveaway as a trial program. California represents one- tenth of the na- 
tion in terms of schools. The experience of having conceived, organized, 
and carried out a state program of this size will. Beaver feels, give Apple 
valuable knowledge of how best to manage and follow through on a ma- 
jor, countrywide computer giveaway program. In addition, he says, the 
folks at Apple are excited about the things they're learning from teachers 
and others. To be sure, there will be lots of ideas and information that 
can be shared with people all over the United States. 

Of course, Apple is hoping that the Federal Ways and Means Com- 
mittee will talk to teachers and other program participants to find out 
how the California program actually worked. If federal representatives 
like what they learn, and if they see the result as a significant indicator of 
Apple's ability to organize such a program, perhaps the national com- 
puter giveaway bill will have a different fate this year. 

There's nothing Apple would like better than to give Apples to tens 
of thousands of schools around the country. Here's hoping that's exact- 
ly what they get to do. 

It's the Real Thing! More and more often these days, educators in 
various settings are using "real software" — that is, applications soft- 
ware — in the classroom. Students at the elementary school and junior 
high levels are learning word processing, while junior high and high 
school students are being introduced to database and spreadsheet pro- 
grams. In keeping with this trend, the Minnesota Education Computing 
Consortium (MECC) has released two products intended for use with

EZ-LEDGER uses the simplest form of bookkeeping possible. Single entry book- 
keeping requires only posting transactions either under INCOME or EXPENSE. 

EZ-LEDGER will keep track of expense items under any one of 99 user selected 
tax codes plus all year-to-date and monthly running totals for each of the 
selected items. Expense items may be entered under DEDUCTIBLE or NON- 
DEDUCTIBLE type codes. 

EZ-LEDGER is a strictly cash system, i.e. if you pay out monies (check, cash, 
credit cards etc.) then the transaction is posted under EXPENSE and if you 
receive monies then record them under INCOf^E. 

EZ-LEDGER Will produce INVOICES with an automatically incremented invoice 
number and then automatically post the data to an ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 
holding file or directly to INCOME and updates all totals. 

The accounts receivable and accounts payable files are "holding" files with their 
own running year to date totals. Transactions in these files may be automatically 
posted to INCOME or EXPENSE and all respective totals will be updated auto- 
matically. 

EZ-LEDGER will support 80 or 132 column printers and one or two disk drives. The 
printer Is needed for producing Invoices, but optional on all other reports. 

EZ-LEDGER requires 48K ram, APPLESOFT rom and DOS 3.3

MECC has also announced a series of instructional computing work- 
shops for educators to be held June 27 through 30 at Minneapolis, Min- 
nesota's, Hilton Inn. The first. Creating a School District Instruction- 
al Computing Plan, is intended for those who are involved in planning 
their school district's implementation of computers. Factors such as cur- 
riculum, equipment, courseware, staff training, and budget will be dis- 
cussed, and planning guidelines will be suggested. The second work- 
shop, Planning In-Service Training in Computing, is designed to give 
educators who are responsible for in-service training in instructional 
computing the perspective and practical ideas they'll need to plan and 
implement a successful program. 

The final workshop, Overview of MECC Computer Literacy In- 
structional Models, proposes that integrating computer use into various 
subject area classes is "perhaps the most effective way to foster comput- 



er literacy in students." Participants will get hands-on experience with 
twenty-six mathematics, science, social studies, and computer studies 
programs now available from MECC, as well as suggestions as to how to 
integrate them into the curriculum. (The new programs, which were de- 
veloped by MECC under federal funding, are in the public domain; 
they'll be available from MECC for the cost of reproduction and 
shipping.)

Kids' Corner Magic Crayon. By Carol Clark. So what's magic about a 
computer imitating a crayon? Wouldn't your kids (and your pocket- 
book) be better off if you just splurged on the box of sixty-four and let 
the budding artists run wild? 

If Magic Crayon were merely a way of letting kids draw on the 
screen with a computerized crayon, buying them a bunch of the real 
thing would surely be a wiser course. But Magic Crayon offers a special 
something else — a gentle, inviting opportunity for kids from age three on 
to become comfortable using a computer. 

Magic Crayon begins with an interactive on-screen tutorial that 
shows young artists how to use the program. Actually, there are two ver- 
sions of this entertaining lesson, one for readers, the other for preread- 
ers. Both employ a friendly little character as a guide, and both show new 
users how the program works, acquainting them with the functions 
served by the space bar, the return key, and a few single-keystroke com- 
mands. And as kids work their way through the tutorial, they discover 
some of the basic things a computer can do — such as remember what 
you tell it, combine smaller elements into a larger whole, and store infor- 
mation on a disk for later retrieval. 

But first, the basics. Magic Crayon allows kids to draw pictures on 
the lo-res screen in a number of colors by means of single-keystroke com- 
mands. Movement up, down, left, right, and diagonally is accomplished 
by hitting single keys according to one of two possible preselected com- 
mand configurations. Additional command keys include C for color 
change, E for erase, R for remember a picture, P for put a picture on- 
screen, and S for stop. There are also commands for moving without

drawing and for continuing to draw after having made a move to 
another location on-screen. Sticky labels that come with the program can 
be affixed to the keys so that commands will become associated with the 
appropriate keys. In addition, hitting the question mark key, shifted or 
unshifted, activates the help option; users who can remember this much 
should have little trouble with the program. 

Magic Crayon has four levels of operation. At the first, instructions 
are presented in picture form. Directional movement is possible at this 
level, but diagonal movement and moving without drawing are not per- 
mitted. Level 2 is just like level 1, except that the instructions are pre- 
sented in words rather than pictures. At level 3, diagonal movement and 
movement without drawing are possible, and at level 4, the ability to 
change the screen location of a picture becomes available. 

Magic Crayon has only a few commands. This makes the program 
easy to use, but there are some tradeoff's in terms of power and flexibility. It 
would be nice, for instance, if Magic Crayon offered erase and unerase 
commands; artists don't always get what they're aiming for the first time 
and should be allowed to change their minds without having to start 
completely over. 

On the plus side. Magic Crayon incorporates an easy-to-use, highly 
flexible class management system. The program is set up so that lots of 
children (as many as fifty) can use it easily. By means of this system, par- 
ents and teachers can create or edit a roster, establishing different skill 
levels for different children so that the program comes up on the level ap- 
propriate to their abilities to read and conceptualize; change the com- 
mand keystroke configuration; and limit or eliminate sound. This pro- 
gram also allows an adult to look at or delete pictures, allocate disk 
space, and record the roster on another Kids' Corner disk. {Magic Cray- 
on is the first program in a planned series.) 

If you're in the market for a program similar to Logo, you'll prob- 
ably prefer Delta Drawing (or one of the Logos) over Magic Crayon. But 
if you're looking for a carefully put together, inexpensive program by 
which to introduce your students or your own children to the computer. 



Magic Crayon has a lot to recommend it. What the program lacks in so- 
phistication, it makes up for in the quality and charm of its on-screen tu- 
torial and the clarity of its brief manual; both are tailor-made for first- 
time computer users. The "trouble-shooting" section of the manual, 
which describes possible problems and offers explanations and solu- 
tions, is especially helpful. 

If all you want to be able to do is draw pretty pictures, real crayons 
still come out ahead of this program — they're cheaper, and they offer 
more colors and more freedom. What is special about Magic Crayon is 
the way it illustrates and makes use of what a computer can do.

seconds 
worth

printer does it in 36. Only 42 seconds 
difference. ..for twice the price.

quality printer makes speed its only 
compromise. Shannon-text rated at

IF YOU'RE CONFUSED 

ABOUT BUYING A 
PERSONAL COMPUTER, 
HERE'S SOME HELR 



Computers come in two parts. 

One part is the "hardware',' the 
machinery itself. The other is the 
"software!' which tells a computer 
what to do, the way a driver tells a 
car what to do. 

Without software, a computer 
can't do anything. And vice versa. 
You have to buy both. 
Buy the software first 

Since the reason you're buying a 
computer is to get the capability 
the software gives you (remember 
it's the software that tells the com- 
puter what to do) , it makes good 
sense to pick the software first. 

Start by making a list of the 
things you want the computer 
to do. Possibilities include word 
processing, inventory control, 
accounting, graphics, recordkeep- 
ing-you name it, there's probably 
software that does it. 

Next take your list into a com- 
puter store and ask the salesper- 
son to demonstrate software that 
will do the things you want. 

Even though you'll need a com- 
puter for the demonstration, keep 
m mmd the computer is just a 
vehicle. The software is the driver. 
Once you've decided on software, 
picking the rest of the computer 
system will be that much easier. 
The simpler the better. 

Some people will tell you that 
software has to be complicated to 
be powerful. Nothing could be fur- 
ther from the truth. 

Good personal software should 
be, as the computer people say, 
"friendly." Meaning that it helps you 
do what you want to do without get- 
ting in the way. 

Good software keeps the com- 
plications in the computer, where 



they belong. And keeps the capa 
bility at your fingertips. It's that 
simple. 

Simply see for yoursell 

You can read any number 
interesting books and mag- 
azines about personal 
computers. You can 
ask your friends 
who have 
them, 




Or look 
at all 

the sales 
literature 
you can get 
your hands on 

But as helpful as 
that can be, there's 
no substitute for a live 
demonstration. 

When you do go shop- 
ping, we recommend 
you take a look at 
thePFS" Family 
of Software. 

Designed 
the way we 
think a soft- 
ware family 
should be: 
simple, 

straightforward 
and powerful. 





Currently there are four software 
packages in the family: PFS:WRITE, 
PFSPILE, PFS:REPORT and PES: 
GRAPH, with more on the way. 
Here's a little more about each of 
them. 

PFS:WRITE. The simplest way 
to get your message across. 

PFS:WRITE is ideal for people 
who want to make their writing time 
more productive. It displays what 
you write on your computer screen 
so you can make revisions as you 
compose. 

With WRITE, you can correct mis- 
spellings or substitute one portion 
of text for another, with just a few 
keystrokes. 

And when you're through revising, 
WRITE shows you "on-screen"just 
how your document will look 
when it's printed. So there 
are no surprises afterwards. 

WRITE also works with 
most popular software pro- 
grams, including the PES 
Family of Software. 

This feature allows you to add 
names and addresses from mailing 
lists to generate form letters. Or 
combine columns of numbers or 
L graphs with your text. 

PFS:FIL£.The simplest 
^^way to get organized. 

FILE is basically a paper filing 
system without the paper. So 
^^^^ you can record, file, retrieve 
and review information in a 
Br fraction of the time it takes with a 
^ conventional filing system. 

With FILE, you arrange your 
information on a "form" you design 
yourself. And when you need to 
track something down, FILE sorts 
through your records electronically. 
It lets you retrieve information in a 
variety of ways so you can be as

PES: REPORT. The simplest 
way to sum it all up. 

REPORT is a powerful analysis 
tool that works with FILE . 

REPORT sorts through your files 
and retrieves the information you're 
looking for. Then assembles it aU 
into one report, so you can analyze, 
plan and make better-informed 
decisions. 

REPORT is also good at math, ft 
quickly sorts through columns of 
numbers and performs calcula- 
tions, so you won't have to.

The triangular-shaped head diminishes rapidly to a small and fine muz- 
zle that can be held in the palm of a hand. The long, delicately curved nos- 
trils run upward and project outward. They dilate greatly when in action or 
excited. 

The eyes are set far apart and are large, lustrous, and full of fire when 
aroused. Intelligence is shown by the brain capacity, a slight protrusion over 
the eyes. The cheekbones are set low and wide. The ears point and are set 
evenly together. 

The head is lean, well-chiseled, and shows energy, courage, and nobili- 
ty. The neck is long and arched, set high and run well back into the 
shoulders. 

Common markings are stars, strips, or blaze faces, white stockings, 
socks, or partial markings on one or more legs. 

More than forty thousand years ago, in the Cenozoic era before the 
dawn of recorded time, a subspecies of horse stood majestically apart 
from its three coarse-blooded brothers. 

High-stepping and spirited, the distinctive anatomy of Equus agilis 



was sketched on limestone walls by cave-dwelling hunters, right along- 
side its prehistoric rivals: Equus tarpanus, the chestnut gray horse of 
Russia; Equus prezewalskii, the steppe horse of central Asia; and Equus 
robustus, the slow, cold-blooded horse of the European flatlands. 

Equus agilis was the hot-blooded horse of the South that inspired the 
first equestrian crush in those early Cro-Magnons who saw it drink the 
wind as it ran. Today, new winds are being stirred by a spirited subspe- 
cies of electronic animal — the Apple. Can a spirited micro be tamed? 

Three thousand years ago, Equus agilis claimed the high, dry plains 
of Asia Minor as its turf. In the warm deserts of Arabia, the Bedouins 
tamed the animal — prized for its beauty, alertness, and speed — and they 
were the first to breed it. The Arabian has existed without marked 
change since the time of Mohammed in the seventh century. Its ancient 
features have been preserved by centuries of selective breeding. 

That's why black Arabian horses are so rare today: Blacks absorbed 
heat in battle, an undesired characteristic among the Bedouin desert 
fighters. Considered evil, the color was bred out centuries ago. 




Above: Mrs. C, as she is known to the crew on the farm, nuzzles up to a foal in the stable, just after the young horse 
and his mother have been put in for the night. Below: In the trophy room of theChauncey home, a converted stable 
now called Equestrian Manor, Deedie Chauncey shows some of the saddles she's ridden on. Her first saddle, an 
English with no horn, is in the collection. 

The breeding of fine Arabians lias long been the passion of sultans, 
kings, presidents, and industrial potentates. General George Washing- 
ton bought Ranger, the first recorded purebred in America, to stand at 
stud in 1765. Sultan Abdul Hamid II presented President Ulysses Grant 
with two stallions. Leopard and Linden Tree. President Teddy Roosevelt 
sponsored an Arabian desert quest for horses in 1906. 

Cereal baron W. K. Kellogg bred Arabians, as did Ann MoCormick, 
the wife of International-Harvester king Fowler McCormick, and chew- 
ing-gum magnate Phillip K. Wrigley, on his Catalina Island ranch off the 
coast of California. Recently such celebrities as Wayne Newton, Merv 
Griffin, Mike Nichols, William Devane, Burt Reynolds, and Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar have all been smitten by Arabianitis, both for the ro- 
mance of it and the finance. 

Sales of top-quality Arabians topped $28 million last year. Several 
top stallions have gone for one million each, although the average price 
for a good horse is $180,000. In his lifetime, a national champion stal- 
lion can be worth up to twenty million in stud fees. 

It is generally accepted that Arabians became an investment to be 
reckoned with soon after Scottsdale horse breeder Tom Chauncey 
bought Naborr, a Russian-bred Polish Arabian, at a public auction of 
the McCormick estate in 1969. The nineteen- year-old stallion went for 
an unheard-of $150,000, an amazing price for a horse of that age and 
three times what he was thought to be worth. Russian-bred Arabians 
were considered unacceptable stock at the time. 

Twelve years later, it took a little friendly persuasion to get Tom 
Chauncey to reckon with an Apple. He's still not completely sold, his 
wife Deedie can see the benefits firsthand, and the Apple does what it's 
told. Situation pending. 

Son of a Good Value. Naborr proved to be worth far more than his 
purchase price for the Chauncey farm. Still standing at stud is Kaborr, 
the son of Naborr, known for his beauty and outstanding showy attitude. 
Some impressive titles he's racked up include Champion of Europe, and 
he's won the Double Canadian National Championship and U.S. Na- 
fionai Championship in reserve, all awarded in 1979. In 1981, Kaborr re- 
ceived a Legion of Supreme Merit award alongside the Chaunceys' 
grand broodmare and all-fime show champion. Mi Toska. Their out- 
standing offspring. Mi Kaborr, Mi Kaborra, and Miss Toska, all share 
their father's famous look of quality. 

When horse people write about horses, pedigree symbols always ac- 
company a name. For example, Naborr is spelled *Naborr, the asterisk 
denoting foreign birth. Kaborr is spelled Kaborr-l--l--l-, denoting 
achievement points won in the show ring. Mi Toska is spelled Mi 



All very official, and let no horse 
go misrepresented. It's a system that 
has served well and good for dec- 
ades — and one that is about to 
change. 

"The asterisk is being dropped be- 
cause of computers," says Deedie 
Chauncey, lifetime horsewoman and 
day-to-day manager of husband Tom 
Chauncey's Arabians. "They will ac- 
cept only nineteen letters for a horse's 
name, and the asterisk is considered a 
letter in the computer's alphabet." It's 
being deleted as a concession to 
progress. 

Inconvenient, yes. Regrettable? 
No. The Arabian breeding industry 
has proven itself no stranger to prog- 
ress. Mini and microcomputers are 
just . . . well, next. Tamed or wild, for 
business or gaming. Strictly business 
around Arabians. 

The casing is sculpted low and 
wide, with the power unit distributing 
the weight unevenly, favoring the left. 

Its profile seems aerodynamically 

carved, although it was never designed to fly. 

Above a chopped lower front, the keyboard centers neatly in four rows; 
the keys are generous and smooth to the touch. A square of light glows 
when the unit is activated, and it remains on while in use.

slots and ample vents. Memory is shown by chip capacity, installed in in-

Any problems Johnson has are referred to trouble-shooters at the lo- 
cal ComputerLand. "They're my resident helpers; I've had to call them 
once or twice." One of those times the problem wasn't the machine. "It 
was me," she says. Entering some Greek symbols baffled her, until Com- 
puterLand personnel talked her through it over the phone. Like a lot of 
folks, Johnson gets lost when the talk turns to internals like ROMs, 
RAMs, and clock speeds. "But when they start talking keyboard, I'm 
okay," she says. 

Her first day on the Apple began a year ago with a note on the com- 
puter that said, "All set to go — have fun." "I spent the first couple of 
weeks playing with the machine and learning from my mistakes," says 
Johnson. 

The Apple manual was Greek to her, but the VisiDex manual was a 
breeze. "It's written in honest-to-God English; it's very easy to under- 




On the wall of Deedie Chauncey's office, a map of the farm shows horses at 
pasture each day. Colts are in blue and mares are in pink, but on a busy day 
the colors sometimes get mixed up. 



JUNE 1983 



There are more than three hundred horses stabled on the Chauncey 
farm — three hundred Arabians and one Apple, because "something is 
done to a horse every day," says Deedie Chauncey, "and we were get- 
ting buried under paperwork." Each something done must be recorded, 
updated, billed, or cross-checked. Foaling fees, vaccinations, worming, 
bloodlines, grazing fees, insurance, branding, registration, sales — the 
flurry of paperwork that makes horse farming a business. 

A recognized expert in breeding, Deedie Chauncey's time is better 
spent consulting on bloodlines than it is shuffling papers. Articles under 
her byline have appeared in Saddle & Bridle, A rabian Horse Journal, 
Arabian Horse World, and Arabian Horse Times. She likes to say she's 
been in the business for fifty-seven years — horses are in her blood. As a 
little giri, she used to "ride like an Indian" on her father's cattle ranch on 
Catalina. 

Tell a Friend. "The Apple came well-recommended," she says; after 
it proved itself drawing up contracts in the sales barn, it was put to the 
business in the administrative offices. The woman who actually runs the 
Apple around the track every day is Cherie Johnson, executive secretary. 

The II Plus, a printer, and two disk drives sit in the corner of her of- 
fice, a paneled room trimmed in red and blue prize ribbons. A microfilm 
projector and sheets of microfiched pedigrees stand nearby. A window 
looks out on two miniature horses. Geranium and Geronimo, grazing in 
a fenced yard. 

Conditioning horses to keep them top-shape investments is half the 
business of the Chauncey farm. Horses are groomed and exercised daily, 
some muscled up with special feeding programs. Training horses to run, 
gallop, trot, and pose for competition is the other half 

Accounts receivable for around seventy client horses are handled by 
the BPI module. One difference: The horse's name and registration are 
entered first. A push of a button shoots Johnson an alphabetical list of all 
the horses boarded and who owes money. The Chaunceys' own ranch 
horses are also set up on BPI accounts so there is a constant record of 
foaling fees for breeding and farrier fees for shoeing. BPI also handles the 
stud fee billing. Accounts can be referenced by the name of the stallion. 

Health records for each horse are kept on VisiDex, which Johnson 
likes because "you can call up anything you want." Two sheets per horse 
show routine health progress. Vaccinations, worming, and farrier rec- 
ords are kept here, as is information for the cross-referencing of 
bloodlines. The program is indexed by symbols like P for Polish blood 
and NM for Naborr mare, the premier bloodline. 

Formatted pages that go into the show records book are also done 
with VisiDex. Cross-referenced by horse or show, lists of judges, a horse's 
placement, and entry fees can be called up. Although the prize money 
can be as low as fifteen dollars, each ribbon won is valued at five hun- 
dred dollars. The real value is the plus sign following a horse's name. 

VisiDex also holds contracts for horse sales or accounts payable. 
They are called up by date and printed when payment is due. 

Reports of insurance on individual horses are processed using Magic 
Window; the program holds required information on policies covering 
236 horses. It also holds freeze-branding records. Permanent registration 
numbers for registered Arabians are frozen in the neck of each horse. 

At the time of a show, blank show records are printed with VisiDex, 
giving a list of classes a horse can compete in, like English, western, or 
ladies' side saddle; jumping, halter, or costume competition. These days, 
horses must specialize in events. One horse does not win all. 

The state of Arizona requires that a hauling certificate accompany 
any horse on the road. Magic Window keeps a list of the current status of 
all horses for these pesky yellow cards. 

Current lists of foals on the farm are also kept via Magic Window. 
Records are cross-referenced when it comes time to name the new horse. 
Naming horses is a huge job for Deedie Chauncey. No potential moni- 
ker goes unconsidered. "Sometimes I even resort to reading road signs. A 
name can be a tool. Imagine a big stallion with a ridiculous name." 

Although proficient in all the previously mentioned software, John- 
son is a self-confessed computer yo-yo. "I don't know beans about pro- 
gramming," she says, "but running a computer isn't too hard. If I can do 
it, anybody can." Her familiarity with computers goes back to her last 
job, traffic director at KOY Radio in Phoenix, where she worked with a 
Marketron mainframe. 



stand." BPI also has a workbook and sample disk that she found to be a 
good confidence builder. 

The Apple at the Chauncey farm didn't get where it is on the strength 
of its business acumen. The note to Johnson was written by Bill Pereira, 
a fellow horse breeder who first brought the Apple onto the Chaun- 
cey farm. 

Barnstorming Apple. Pereira, acting in the role of sales consultant, > 
sold a skeptical Tom Chauncey on purchasing a little Apple power. "We 
first used the Apple at the Naborr Generation Sale in 1982," he says. "It 
was originally only a convenience device to close deals before people left 
the arena." 

To emphasize the importance of that convenience: The Naborr sale 
generated six million dollars' worth of sales. One hundred horses were 
processed in four hours using a Pereira-created program that computed 
payments and made up a contract in thirty seconds. "Previously it was 
done with a handful of people on calculators, trying to get names and ad- 
dresses correct at the same time. A real madhouse," says Pereira. 

He had seen the farm's future — and a little arm-twisting computer- 
ized it. "The Chauncey operation was getting so big, with so many 
horses, that I could see a fairly substantial increase in outside business. It 
was getting to where it seemed silly not to have a computer." 

Pereira has had Apples on his own farm, Pereira Arabians in Santa 
Ynez, California, since 1979. Among his more than one hundred horses 
is Toi Soldier, his number one sire, a blood-brown bay marked with a star 
and three white stockings. 

After suffering through some used boards in several new Vector mi- 
cros, as well as inflexible software, Pereira traded up to the Apple five 
years ago. "I first got into computers for their spreadsheet capability. 
The BPI software also looked like it could be adapted to running a 
breeding farm. 

"Since financial people can come and go, I figured, as a small-busi- 
nessman, I should get to know how to do it myself— and I did on the Ap- 
ple." He's since turned his finances over to an outside firm, but the Ap- j 
pie still gets two to three hours of work a day, handling his mailing list on |

base courtesy of VisiFile. 

Pereira actually owns three Apples; two are backups. "We're out in 
the hinterlands, where it's dusty and the quality of power is bad. I've got 
voltage regulators and all that." So far, he hasn't had to use either back- 
up — the main Apple has been performing without a hitch for over a 
year now. 

"I wasn't a computer person," he says, and it took him three years to 
figure out how to care for the Apple in the wild. "Now I'm an Apple per- 
son. I don't really know why, I just like the looks of 'em." He's going to 
hold on to his II Plus out of pride, despite the new enhanced version. 
"Besides, I've got five thousand dollars' worth of programming I might 
have to change." 

While Apples are keeping the Chauncey and Pereira farms in good 
condition, the two official registries of the Arabian horse business, grow- 
ing too big too soon, have gone directly from manual to mini opera- 
tions, skirting micros almost altogether. 

When the first American stud book was opened in 1908, with the 
founding of the Arabian Horse Club Registry of America, the docu- 
mentation of American Arabians was established. This country now 
claims more purebreds than all other countries combined. 

Known as the guardians of the breed, the Registry maintains a closed 
stud book: The only way to produce a purebred Arabian is by mating a 
registered purebred stallion and mare that have pedigrees stemming from 
the purebreds of the Arabian desert. This means maintaining registers 
and transfers on two hundred seventy thousand horses — paperwork that 
includes foaling dates, pedigrees, foreign sources, colors, sex, and the 
names and addresses of ninety thousand owners. 

It's no wonder the Registry's American Stud Book is now computer- 
ized. The foreign stud books, representing an additional eight to nine 
thousand horses, are temporarily handled by an IBM pc. Future plans: 



micro access to the Registry's data files via modem. 

While the American Registry ensures that no hanky panky slips into 
the Arabian's bloodline, the International Arabian Horse Association 
has the job of promoting the breed. They sponsor the annual U.S. 
National Championship Horse Show, horsedom's major event. The In- 
ternational Registry's show records, membership, and registration are 
now handled by a Data General mini. Ratings of horses shown are de- 
termined by the computer from the green cards turned in by the judges. 

Back on the Chauncey farm, the biggest in the world, the major horse 
files already take up four disks. When they first went Apple, there was no 
horse software available, so Pereira improvised some. Now several fi- 
nancial packages are advertised in the pages of the Arabian trade 
journals. 

One of them is Champ, a database management and security system 
that runs on a Point-4 mini or Televideo micro, designed by a neighbor- 
ing horseperson up the road from theChaunceys. The other is the whole 
shootin' match — accounting, breeding, and record-keeping — created to 
run on the Apple.

may be in the twilight of their career on the Chauncey farm. "It's not the 
ideal setup," says Deedie Chauncey, "but, so far, it's done the job." She 
eventually sees a hard disk configuration and one of the new compre- 
hensive packages in its place. Which package remains to be seen. 

Maybe without any arm-twisting this time, it will be a new He and 
the Apple package. The first Chauncey Apple came well recommended. 
The next one will have to prove itself. 

Not unusual. It's a situation the Apple was made for. Hi

Clock Calc, a program that will accurately track 
the amount of time a person or company 
spends on a task. The high-cost world we live in 
has caused most of us to desire our compensa- 
tion for work to be as accurate as possible. If 
you own a business, you can appreciate the abil- 
ity to track the time spent by your employees 
accurately. 

The following Basic program presents a 
one-week blank time-card form to be filled in 
by the user. The program uses fourteen in /out 
time slots, broken up into seven groups or days 
(with two slots each that allow for punching out 
at lunch breaks). Each of the slots has a total- 
time-worked column, and each of the seven 
groups (or days) also has a total-time-worked 
column. A totaJ-time-worked value is presented 
at the bottom of the right-hand column. 

All the time-worked values are updated as 
you enter new time values. The final, and pos- 
sibly the most important, feature of the system 
is the ability to figure total pay from the total 
time worked and the pay rate. 

The wage-per-hour value (or rate) may be 
entered in two ways, the fastest method being to 
press the letter R at any time during the pro- 
gram. The second method is to move the time 
cursor to the bottom of the time sheet. Either 
method will cause an input prompt requesting 
the rate per hour. 

If you enter the pay rate first, it will auto- 
matically update with the new in/out time 
values. You may also clear the time sheet at any 
time by pressing the letter C. 

The program uses an inverse bar or cursor 
to indicate the position of the time value to be 
entered. The left and right arrows are used to 



cursor up and down the sheet. 
Good luck with your programming.

SAMS LIGHTENS YOUR 
PROGRAMMING LOAD. 

If you're serious about programming but don't enjoy 

the tedium of setting up subroutines and functions, 

THE PROGRAMMER from Sams is the answer. 

THE PROGRAMMER is a BASIC code-generator which is 

powerful, highly versatile and easy-to-use. 

It provides a programming "shorthand" which takes 

your ideas and writes the appropriate lines of BASIC. So 

programming is fast and error-free. 

Through a series of "menus", you can select the 

direction or function you want the program to perform. 

Code is generated as you go along. So you can stop and 

make changes without destroying your previous work. 

When you've finished a program, save it on another 

disk for future use, and begin creating again. 

THE PROGRAMMER comes with a complete instruction 

book which dearly explains how to create programs for 

almost any application. 

Lighten your programming load with THE 

PROGRAMMER. It works with the Apple II Plus® 

and the IBM® Personal Computer. Get THE 

PROGRAMMER at your local software retailer or

Fruitful Connections. 



There are more people in more 
places making more accessories 
and peripherals for Apples than 
for any other personal computer 
in the world. 

Thanks to those people — 
in hundreds of independent 
companies— you can make the 
humblest 1978 Apple II rum tricks 
that are still on IBM's Wish List 
for 1984. 

But now we're coming out with 
our very own line of peripherals 
and accessories for Apple® Personal 
Computers. 

For two very good reasons. 

First, compatibility We've 
created a totally kluge-free family 
of products designed to take full 
advantage of all the advantages 
built into every Apple. 

Second, service and support. 




Now the same kindly dealer who 
keeps your Apple PC in the pink 
can do the same competent job 
for your Apple hard-disk and your 
Apple daisywheel printer. 

So if you're looking to expand 
the capabilities of your Apple II 
or III, remember: 

Now you can add Apples to 
Apples. 



Gutenberg would be proud. 

Old Faithful Silentype® has now been joined by New Faithfuls, the 
Apple Dot Matrix Printer and the Apple Letter Quality Printer 

So now, whatever your budget and your 
needs, you can hook your Apple to a printer 
that's specifically designed to take advan- 
tage of all the features built into your 
Apple. With no compromises. 

The 7x9 Apple Dot Matrix 
Printer is redefining "correspondence 



quality" with exceptional legibility 
With 144x160 dots per square inch, it can 
also create high resolution graphics. 

The Apple Letter Quality Printer, 
^ - .''^•j, which gets the words out about 33% 
^ faster than other daisywheel printers 
in its price range, also offers graphics 
capabilities. See your authorized 
Apple dealer for more information and 
demonstrations. Because, unfortunately all 
news fit to print simply doesn't fit. 





Ajoy to behold 

The new Apple Joystick 11 is 
the ultimate hand control device 
for the Apple II. 

Why is it such a joy to use? 

With two firing buttons, it's 
the first ambidextrous joystick — 
just as comfortable for lefties 
as righties. 

Of course, it gives you 360° 
cursor control (not just 8-way like 
some game-oriented devices) and 
full X/Y coordinate control. 

And the Joystick II contains 
high-quality components and 
switches tested to over 1,000,000 
life cycles. 

Which makes it a thing of 
beauty And a joystick forever

A storehouse of knowledge. 



If you work with so much data 
or so many programs that you find 
yourself shuffling diskettes con- 
stantly, you should take a look at 
Apples Profile™ the personal 
mass storage system for 
the Apple III Personal 
Qjmputer 

This Wmchester-based 
5-megabyte hard disk 
can handle as much data 
as 35 floppies. Even more 
important for some, it 
can access that data 
about 10-times faster 
than a standard floppy 
drive. 

So now your Apple 
III can handle jobs once 
reserved for computers 
costing thousands 
more. 

As for quality 



and reliability; you need only store 
one word of wisdom: 
Apple. 





Launching pad for numeric data. 



Good tidings for crunchers of 
numerous numbers: 

Apple now offers a numeric 
keypad that's electronically and 
aesthetically compatible 
with the Apple II 
Personal G^mputer [ 
So you can enter 
numeric data 
faster than 
ever before. 

The Apple 
Numeric Key- 
pad II has 
a standard 
calculator- 
style layout. 
Appropriate, 




because unlike some other key- 
pads, it can actually function as a 
calculator 

The four function keys to the 
left of the numeric pad should be 
of special interest 
to people who use

Graph'n'Calc III, by Don Williams/Marton Inc. Graph'n'Calc goes 
right to the heart of the question of the nature of the medium we deal 
with when we sit before a microcomputer. Most of us, perhaps by de- 
fault, use it as an extension of the written word. We hook a printer up to 
the Apple, and, when we have something really edifying or important, we 
dump it to the printer. 

That action leaves the real question unaddressed, however. Is the mi- 
crocomputer a written or a visual medium? Is it James Michener or Wal- 
ter Cronkite? Is it both, or possibly neither? 

The fact that word processing is the number one use of microcom- 
puters, with database management a distant second, does not close the 
door to further consideration. Among the points to ponder When we 
use the Apple, it communicates to us by way of video. The images we ask 
it to use mimic the written word, but the medium is video. 

The old journalism saw is that a picture is worth a thousand words. If 
that's true, and if the Apple communicates as easily graphically as it does 
alphanumerically, then it seems incumbent on the users to reconsider the 
nature of the medium. 

Perhaps the question doesn't arise because we aren't accustomed to 
having a visual medium at our fingertips while on the job. Memos aren't 
illustrated. A list of potential vendors and their pricing isn't illustrated. 
Sales figures for last month normally aren't illustrated. Leonardo da 
Vinci isn't needed by business. 

But if there were such a tool. ... It might not draw cartoons to re- 
place mailing labels, nor paint the Mona Lisa as a representation of the 
creditworthiness of a large customer. But it just might reduce those thou- 
sands of words and numbers that represent a business to a series of 
graphic representations that would be easier to understand. 

Graph'n'Calc is aimed in that direction. As its name implies, it's a 
graph and spreadsheet program. As its name also implies, graph is pri- 
mary and spreadsheet is strictly secondary. 

What its name doesn't hint at is the power in this business forecast- 
ing tool. Author Don Williams has a modicum of expertise in the field. 
He was with IBM for several years and is the author of Desktop Plan. 
What he's done in Graph'n'Calc is take business forecasting into the 
visual medium. In so doing, he's overlaid the basic graphing and spread- 
sheet functions with sophisticated statistical modules that would take 
days to build into VisiCalc or Multiplan. 

In an era when more is better, Williams has taken the opposite ap- 
proach. His spreadsheet is strictly limited to ten rows and one hundred 
columns. If that seems unnecessarily constraining at first glance, it ac- 
tually works out to be more than enough space for serious forecasting 
purposes. Graph'n'Calc isn't intended to compete with the big guys in fi- 
nancial modeling. You can't enter your entire general ledger for the past 
umpty-ump years into the model and play "what if." 

What you can do is take the key numbers out of the general ledger 
and actually watch while Graph'n'Calc first analyzes the trend of the 
numbers, then measures the correlation of the real numbers against ad- 
justed numbers, extrapolates your numbers for future reporting periods, 
and, if necessary, adjusts those numbers for seasonal variations. 

In some ways, it might be legitimate to look at Graph'n'Calc as a 
forerunner of the next generation of business software. VisiCorp has us 
all sold, and rightfully so, on the value of determining "what if." But the 
very nature of the question VisiCalc addresses implies a lack of informa- 
tion on which to base decisions. That's not necessarily the case in a busi- 




ness environment. Often, there's voluminous data documenting past his- 
tory. VisiCalc is competent at extrapolating that past history into future 
possibilities. Graph'n'Calc is superb at performing the same function. 
Graph' n'C ale's strength is addressing the question of "what's probable." 

As an experiment, a set of real monthly sales numbers, shortened to 
remove the last twelve months of real data, was entered into 
Graph'n'Calc. The program was then asked to perform all its wonders 
and extrapolate the given data into the next twelve months. The results 
were eerily accurate, as if the software or the microprocessor were sneak- 
ing looks at the withheld data. 

Graph'n'Calc determines these extensions of data with a series of so- 
phisticated invokable statistical functions. Given a historical base, the 
program can find trends, apply them to the future, adjust the numbers 
for seasonal variations, and test the accuracy of the projections with ex- 
ponential smoothing techniques. 

That would be dandy enough in a spreadsheet program, but this one 
goes further by drawing it all out graphically. You can get bne charts, bar 
graphs, stacked bar graphs, pie charts, and practically everything else 
except a Yogi Bear animated cartoon. The graphic features are smooth 
and easy to use and work readily with a dot-matrix printer. 

Printing the graphs gives a permanent hard-copy record of the pro- 
gression of the model — showing which alternatives promise the most or 
what's in store for the next six months for various product lines. 

Graph'n'Calc gives you even more. You can save each graph to disk 
and then set up a slide show, with the graphs flashing on screen either at

to prepare the data easily for visual presentation should make 
Graph'n'Calc a favorite among managers needing to sway their vice 
presidents and directors. 

Desktop Computer Software has gone the full route to give Apple III 
owners a usable product. It's even included Fundamentals of Forecasting, 
a book published by Reston Publishing Company, to give the beginner a 
sound foundation. 

Graph'n'Calc is a dandy product that would be even dandier if it 
weren't so slow. It's written in Basic. Much of the lost time is in disk 
access; a hard disk would significantly speed up access time. 

By itself, Graph'n'Calc goes a long way toward reversing the trend of 
using the Apple III as merely an extension of the printed medium. It's a 
useful and friendly adjunct to any business or department and should 
find its niche. APT

Microbe. By Robert C. Clardy and Alan H. Zalta, M.D. Synergistic 
Software describes Microbe as "an anatomical adventure." What Mi- 
crobe really is is another graphic tour de force from Robert Clardy. 

Microbe is designed to be a challenging game of shrewd deduction 
and quick reflexes. It is even more challenging as an educational simula- 
tion of modern medical diagnosis and treatment. Microbe will test sci- 
ence students from high school to medical school. For physicians, Mi- 
crobe offers first-rate excitement and a fascinating perspective while re- 
freshing their medical knowledge. 

Based loosely on the classic science-fiction movie, Fantastic Voyage, 
Microbe takes the user into a world as strange and alien as any imagina- 
ble: the inside of the human body. 

The date is January 14, 1990. A secret government project has finally 
reached fruition; A miniaturization device to reduce anything safely to 
microscopic size has been perfected. Minisubs, designated microbes, 



D-TACHy 




T A L l( JUNE 1983 

have been constructed. Crews of specialists are prepared to be injected 
into critically ill patients, embarking on life-saving medical missions 
within the human body. 

The player is the captain of one of these revolutionary microbes in 
the service of the new science of miniaturization surgery. The crew, con- 
sisting of a navigator, a technician, and a physician, are miniaturized 
with the sub, which is equipped with a laser, an X-ray device, and a com- 
plete store of modern drugs. The microscopic ship and team are injected 
into the vein of a critically injured patient. Use the sophisticated tools 
wisely and the patient may survive. Make a mistake and the patient can 
die — or the crew can be killed. The challenge of using combined talents 
to save a life is only the beginning. 

Microbe may be played by one to ten players. In order to assist group 
role-playing, manuals are included for each of the roles. In addition, the 
documentation makes extensive use of charts, drug tables, and medical 
information. During group play, players work as a team. Less informa- 
tion is provided by the microbe's on-board computer to compensate for 
the human players. 

The player may select background level of play from gamer to physi- 
cian. Game skill levels are also selectable. Provision has been made for 
using Microbe with several voice synthesizers, too. 

The game begins by your selecting a patient from cryogenic sleep. A 
description of the injuries or illness of the patient and the patient's past 
medical history are provided; these influence your mission. 

You monitor the mission on a master view screen showing either a 
hi-res map of your location in the human body or an outside view from 
the microbe's perspective. Beside the master screen are gauges showing 
vital information such as fuel supply, air supply, and so on. Your mis- 
sion is to reach a particular area of the body, perform the appropriate 
medical procedure, and leave via the eyes. That's right, the eyes. 

Difficulties and dangers you encounter range from unforeseen hem- 
orrhages, clogged arteries, and tumors to attacks by foreign viruses and 
bacteria. The body itself considers the craft a foreign invader and its de- 
fenses may attack at any moment. 

The graphics are first-rate. Liberal use of hi-res animation provides 
excellent views of the interior of the human body. Wait till you watch the 
body's white blood cells swarm in to attack! Should the patient suffer a 
medical emergency, you'll be the first to know it: During a seizure the 
screen appears to shake. Now that's realism. 

Microbe is a rich treat for the mind and the senses. It is fast-paced 
and exciting and requires quick reflexes and even quicker thinking. But it 
is as an educational tool that Microbe ?hme.s brightest. The game is medi- 
cally accurate. It makes an excellent tutorial for medical students learn- 
ing the interior workings of the body. In each case study, the student 
must determine the correct medical responses to each crisis. Full medical 
terminology is used throughout — which at first causes frequent diving 
for the manuals to understand what is occurring. Microbe will probably 
find its way into many medical school courses and be a favorite after- 
hours game at hospitals. WHH

Mockingboard. If you compare a game on the Apple with its equivalent 
on an Atari 8(X) or Commodore 64, probably the greatest difference 
you'll notice will be the sound. 

A program on the Apple creates sound by tweaking the speaker at 
various rates. To be sure, some very interesting sounds can be created in 
that way, but generating such sounds takes up all the 6502's attention. 
The Atari and Commodore have dedicated digital-to-analog sound 
chips. That's why they can play Frogger music all the time, while your 
Apple plays only a bar or two, and only when your frog gets squashed. 

Fortunately, the Apple is an infinitely upgradable machine. When it 
comes to sound, a Mockingboard in your Apple lets it sing as sweetly as 
any computer on the market. And talk too. 

To be specific, there are four different boards that call themselves 
Mockingboard. The two basic boards are Sound I and Speech I. Sound I 
is capable of an impressive range of sounds. Some examples on the dem- 
onstration disk include trains, guns, lasers, oceans, explosions, and a very 
credible helicopter. Speech I uses a Votrax speech chip in a better way 
than Votrax was able to use it. The Mockingboard speech sounds syn- 
thesized, but it is very precise and easy to understand. The other two

WeVe moved ahead 
a byte in time since 
the Tower of Babel. 
And at least three things 
have improved. 

Here they are: 

Thing Number One: 

Our Communication's Improved. 

With AMPER-MAGIC™ there's no need to know machine lan- 
guage to benefit from its power. 

To your Applesoft™ programs you can attach slick, finished 
machine language routines (referenced by name, not by address, 
no less) in seconds. No separate BLOADing. And then, with 
AMPER-MAGIC commands, you can pass variables back and 
forth directly, just as you would with built-in Applesoft 
commands. 

So, name your routine, perform the append procedure (only 
once please), and AMPER-MAGIC takes over — generating 
machine language speed where it counts: in your programs. 
Even your commercial programs. And, if for some reason you 
want to remove the routine, AMPER-MAGIC can do this too. 

Thing Number Two: 

Our Communication's Improved. 

AMPER-MAGIC also gives you access to hundreds of relocatable 
machine language routines, including those from magazines 
and other libraries, and - most notably - those from AMPER- 
MAGIC itself, which has over fifty routines of its own in two 
volumes. 

Some of AMPER-MAGIC's routines are: 

Find substring Swap variables GOSUB, GOTO a variable 

Speed up Applesoft Input anything Search string array 

And, of course, there are others too, for business, educational, 
recreational and word-process uses. 

With AMPER-MAGIC you attach and access. It's really that 
simple. You can attach an unlimited number of commands to 
any program and you can move any set of commands as a unit 
to any other program. 
A marvelous simplicity, wouldn't you say? 

Thing Number Three: 

Our Communication's Improved. 

Compatible with AMPER-MAGIC you can get the AMPER- 
MAGIC COMMAND LIBRARY. Already available is Volume 
2, which contains twenty-seven machine language routines 
devoted to information displays and output capabilities. 
With Volume 2 you get: a WAIT command, which specifies time 
in ordinary tenths of seconds either as a variable or as an 
expression which can be controlled by the program; the most 
powerful PRINT USING command yet devised; and, of course, 
twenty-five other commands. Future volumes include INPUT 
USING, fancy memory management and various sorting routines. 

Imagine!

boards are Sound II, which is the equivalent of two Sound I boards, and 
Sound/ Speech I, a combination of the two basic boards. Each of these 
combines the functions of two boards on one, and each uses dual speak- 
er output, making stereo sound possible. 

Trouble is, it isn't much easier for the beginner to program the 
Mockingboards for sound than it is to program the Apple speaker. The 
manual has a lot of talk about registers, resets, and routines, none of 
which answers the simple question, "How do I make it go zap?" 

Hard-core hobbyists will probably be able to make some sense out of 
the documentation after a bit of trial and frustration. But what about the 
rest of us? Well, that's where the brilliance of Sweet's support strategy re- 
veals itself. Obviously, games that are written to make noise through the 
Apple speaker will leave the Mockingboard songless, so Sweet is going to 
the publishers and getting them to put Mockingboard sounds in their 
games. In some cases. Sweet is going as far as writing the routines and 
providing them merely for the credit line. The result: A lot of games al- 
ready put out Mockingboard sounds, provided there's a Mockingboard 
there to play them. 

Which raises a profound philosophical point: If a program has 
Mockingboard sound routines, and there's no Mockingboard to run 
them, how do we know they make a noise? Dt)

Pick That Tune. By Randall and Mary Swearingen. The champagne 
punch is going flat, no one's touched your unique minced clam and 
horseradish canapes, and the conversation has descended to sporadic, le- 
thargic observations on the current state of the economy and the situa- 
tion in the Middle East. 

Hey, guys and gals! How about a few rounds of Pick That TuneV. 

Yes, the peculiar institution known as the party game has made the 
transition from the gas-lit gazebo into the computer age just as smooth as 
you please, carving out its reassuring, bland, comfy, homey genre amidst 
all the sophisticated, high-tech, whiz-bang game software surrounding it. 



Apparently, it will never die. 

Pick That Tune is a hardy exemplar of the breed, accommodating ten 
players at a whack and providing for as many variations on the simple 
act of matching notes to song titles as one could wish for. You attempt to 
guess the identity of the melody in question from a list of five possible 
candidates after hearing one to twenty-five notes. A one-note bid is 
worth 250 points; each additional note is worth ten fewer points. After 
you choose your category — pop, country-western, television, or chil- 
dren's (additional categories available on separate disks) — you can de- 
cide whether you want a point penalty for wrong guesses (and, if so, 
should it be one-quarter of the points bid, one-half, or full penalty) and if 
"none of the above" should be on the list of title choices. All the possible 
permutations of these options result in sixteen game variations for each 
song category and a rather lengthy boot-up. 

In play, the game makes every attempt to be as fair as any referee 
could be in a competition like this. The player bidding to guess the tune 
in the fewest notes for the most points gets to go first. If, however, every- 
one chooses to bid the same number of notes, the player whose name 
happened to be entered first will always get the first shot at the next one. 
As none of the songs in any category are exactly obscure, this could 
cause problems, especially in the children's songs category — like a 
knock-down, drag-out after a three-player game ends with a score of 
l,3(X)-24-0. Make sure the kids understand the bidding procedures, all 
nicely spelled out in the documentation. 

Also nicely spelled out is a rather delightful cutthroat option, which 
you can take after the previous (lower-bidding) player has guessed 
wrong. In this "power play," you waive your original bid and guess the 
tune based on the notes the preceding player heard, getting a shot at his 
higher score. 

Still, no one is likely to get frustrated in this game. The only real re- 
quirement for play is to have dwelt upon this earth for a while. (It could 
get a lot tougher with the passage of time — in ten years, how many peo- 
ple will recognize the theme from Starsky and HutcW. For that matter, 
how many can now?) The real challenge lies with the sound capability of

the Apple, which can take the first four notes of songs you've known all 
your life and make them into something wonderfully new and strange.

Micro Cookbook. The kitchen of the future is what Micro Cookbook is 
all about. Enter available ingredients and the Apple responds with an in- 
dex of applicable recipes. "What's for dinner?" is one question the com- 
puterized cookbook never hesitates to answer. 

In Micro Cookbook, Virtual Combinatics has put together the ultimate 
in user-friendly programs. Not only is Micro Cookbook completely 
menu-driven, but it also includes extras such as nutrition guides, calorie 
guides, and a cooking-term glossary. Another good example of the 
amount of thought that went into this program is an extensible search 
option. ESO allows the user to perform an ingredient search. The pro- 
gram looks for an ingredient in its singular and plural forms. 

Besides the program, the package includes a disk of more than two 
hundred international recipes. To these, you can add your own favorites 
and specialties. Entering a recipe is an easy task, which involves filling in 
a few screens that resemble formatted index cards. Modifying an exist- 
ing recipe is just as easy. When you call for a recipe, you can specify the 
number of people who'll be dining; Micro Cookbook automatically ad- 
justs quantities and measures of each ingredient accordingly. 

Several special printing functions are also supported. It's possible to 
print three types of indexes: an index of all recipes, an index of all in- 
gredients, and an index of classifications. You can print a shopping list to 
take to the grocery store; just tell the program what meals you have 
planned for the week and it generates an itemized list automatically. 

The Apple He version uses many of the features of that machine, and 
it requires the eighty-column option. All the sections accept response 
from joystick or trackball; everything is "point and toudi." The program 
is expanded with additional recipes and features to use the full 64 K. The 



extra memory also enables the program to provide multiscreen recipes. 
Other new features such as wild-card searching and logic sorting 
(either/or) enhance the He package. 

Virtual Combinatics plans additional chapters to the cookbook, 
add-on disks containing specialized recipes. The first two are available: 
Appetizers and Soups & Salads. The next planned is Desserts. 

One final byproduct of this well-made program: Your obsolete rec- 
ipe box may be just the right size for a disk holder. DAD

Spectre. By Bob Flanagan and Scott Miller. When you take the best ele- 
ments of different games and blend them into one, you'd expect to come 
up with a winning combination. Well, that's what DataMost has done, 
but the result comes in just a few strides short of what might have been a 
winner. 

Taking a look at Spectre, you'll recognize Wayout; you'll see what's 
undoubtedly from Tron; and the obligatory maze game is unmistakable. 
It's hard to pinpoint just where Spectre falls short because, taken by 
themselves, the components are pretty good. 

You're given a split-screen display. On one side is a 3-D view as you 
see it from inside the maze; on the other side is a bird's-eye view of the 
maze. And hounding you through the maze are the menacing Questers, 
which look like clones of Tron's police Recognizers. 

The animation is not too shabby. Moving through the maze looks 
like moving through a maze, except for the turns, which feel more like 
West Point rights, lefts, and about-faces. Spectre's sound effects are used 
sparingly, but when they're there, you're well aware of them. Nice 
and loud. 

Perhaps the weakness is in the game's story line. You're marooned 
on a disabled space station in the outer reaches of space, waiting for help 
to arrive. Questers have discovered you, and now you must run through 
the space station's mazelike corridors, closing the space ports to keep 
them out. 

It's not hard to figure out that the space ports line the corridors like 
dots in a maze, that the Questers chase you like Pac ghosts in a maze,

and that there are "energizing beams," which allow you to destroy 
Questers, like power pills in a maze. 

The maze is not exactly the largest ever used in a game, but there are 
catches. At novice level, the walls disappear after five seconds into play, 
making it difficult to know where and when to turn. In advanced mode, 
walls and space ports are invisible, making the game next to impossible. 

Teleportation chambers come in handy when things get hectic. Go 
into one of them and you'll be placed back where you started, but you'll 
be out of danger — for the moment. 

Spectre is a game that you'll probably sit down with repeatedly, but 
not because you're having the time of your life. More likely it'll be be- 
cause the game looks so deceptively simple that you'll be convinced you

Bulk Mailer. By Joe Marinello. Btdlk Mailer is both a technological and 
functional advance for the Apple II and as such represents a significant 
breakthrough. In concept and design, it runs counter to the current pub- 
lishing theory that ever more versatile and complicated database pro- 
grams are desirable. Bulk Mailer knows what it was designed for and 
sticks determinedly to that task alone. 
So what are all the raves about? 

It was not so long ago that conventional wisdom held that no Apple 
II could handle thousands of items efficiently. If you had lots of data in a 
business environment, it was automatically assumed that you would step 
up to a "business" computer instead of applying the Apple to the task. 
Or, if you were foolhardy enough to ignore that wisdom, that you would 
pay a severe penalty in terms of functionality and response time. 

As has so often been the case when conventional wisdom assumed 
that the Apple II had limitations, that wisdom was wrong. In this case, it 
took Joe Marinello, a southern California native now residing in Seattle, 
Washington, to take the bull by the horns and prove the point. 

What Marinello devised was a mailing program that, on a hard disk, 
can handle thirty-two thousand names and retrieve any one of them by 
account number in approximately two seconds. Pause now, dear skeptic, 
to reread that last sentence and let the numbers sink in this time. The 
time you spent rereading the sentence is the approximate duration of 
finding any record from among 32,000. 

Everybody thought they knew that coaxing that kind of perform- 
ance out of an Apple is impossible. That's the neat thing about Apples. 
Yesterday's impossible task is tomorrow's commonplace event — and the 
following day's innovation on other microcomputers. 

How all this was accomplished was by stripping the program of 
everything that smacked of versatility or redundancy. What you can do 
with Bulk Mailer is manage a mailing list. Period. Just try to do some- 
thing else with it; Satori Software dares you to succeed. It can't be done. 
Use it for mailing lists or forget it. 

But as a mailing-list program for folks who need to manage lots of 
names. Bulk Mailer is the ticket. And it has just enough features, al- 
though nobody using it will fail to yearn for more. 

What you get in terms of data space are four address lines of twenty- 
eight characters and one five-character code line. To call that space 
sparse is clearly understating the case. 

Yet the built-in filtering features do provide for some versatility. The 
code line serves as a filter. Used wisely, it enables the user to address only 
that part of the total list that is desired for a particular mailing. The sec- 
ond address line permits entry of various codes that give it additional uses. 
There's a no-print code so that comments can be stored there. And 
there's a priority code, so that the second line will print before the first 
line. That's a dandy feature if you wanted to insert something like 
"Happy Holidays" on the second line and have it print above the mailing 
label. 

In other areas, Bulk Mailer is rife with features. It has an automatic 
duplicate entry killer. Upon request, it will run through the database, de- 
leting any entries that have accidentally been duplicated. The program 
also looks for near duplicates and reports them so that the user may 
determine whether an entry should be purged. That's nifty if you haven't 
been consistent in nomenclature. The system will report "Box 89" and 
"P.O. Box 89" as a near duplicate, sparing the user the burden even of 



consistent data-entry conventions. 

Bulk Mailer also keeps a zip code inventory, so you know at any mo- 
ment what the geographies of your list are like. The program will also 
postpone, until the end of a label run, the printing of the names in any 
given zip code in which there are more than fifty entries. That's a feature 
designed to ease preparing third-class mail for the U.S. Postal Service. 

Bulk Mailer comes in two configurations, a floppy disk version and a 
hard disk version. The floppy version handles twelve hundred names per 
disk but only works with the disks you have on-line. Thus, single-drive 
owners get one disk; two-drive owners get two disks, or twenty-four hun- 
dred names. There's no provision for a third drive. 

The reason for the limitation is that additional disks or drives cost 
more in performance than the author was willing to pay. Instead, for 
owners who outgrow the floppy system, there's the hard disk version. It's 
capable of taking your list out to thirty-two thousand names. 

Practically everybody who buys Bulk Mailer will immediately wish 
for one little tweak to the program to add another field for filtering, or 
for some other purpose. But even as they wish for enhancements, they'll 
be stunned by the efficiency and speed at which the program executes the 
task it has set for itself. In this case, versatility be damned! Get me that 
record in two seconds. APT

Go. By Stan Erwin. Go is one of the world's ancient games. Played 
mostly in Japan for centuries, this game of subtle strategies is played with 
numerous small, smooth stones on a board marked by nineteen horizon- 
tal lines and nineteen vertical lines. Two players with stones of contrast- 
ing colors take turns placing their stones, one per turn, on any of the 361 
line intersections on the board. 

The object of the game is to control the playing board by surround- 
ing and cutting off the enemy. When an enemy piece or formation of 
pieces is cut off, it is destroyed. Players win points for each piece cap- 
tured and for every square of the board they control at the end of the 
game. 

Warriors of old learned strategic techniques for conquering and hold- 
ing land from this game — a useful pastime in old Japan with its history 
of feuding warlords. The game blends offense and defense in a constant- 
ly shifting pattern, so subtle that achieving proficiency often takes years 
of study. The modern game of Othello has its origins in Go. 

In this very modem version of Go, the computer adversary plays a 
very competent game, making few mistakes. It plays an intermediate- 
level strategy. A handicap of from one to nine stones' head start is 
allowed in the interest of beginners. As your skill improves, the handicap 
can be lowered. 

Hayden's version of Go is a faithful rendition of the board game that 
provides endless intellectual challenge. RRA

Apple Dot Matrix Printer. When you think about it, it's only natural 
that the printer should be the most troublesome part of a computer sys- 
tem. Your computer, for all its foibles, is probably the most reliable ma- 
chine you own. Certainly it requires fewer repairs than your car or your 
washing machine. After all, the computer has no moving parts. 

A printer, on the other hand, is subject to the thousand natural 
shocks that mechanical devices are heir to. If you've used a printw for 
long, you've probably seen all its tricks: form feeding in strange places, 
taking paper in the bottom that just came out the top, wasting a page of 
paper between files, not turning on underlining at the right time, not 
turning off underiining at the right time, and — well, you get the picture. 

So, has Apple's Dot Matrix Printer, or DMP, as they like to call it, 
arrived to deliver us from all this? The answer is a resounding, "Sort of." 
Now don't be disappointed; most printers don't even rate a "sort of." 

Okay, here's the good news. The Apple DMP has the best paper path 
you'll find on a tractor-feed printer. If you've ever come back to a print- 
er to find a sixteen-page essay printed on three pages because the paper 
jammed, you'll realize how important that is. The DMP seems to know 
what paper is going in and what is coming out without confusing the 
two. Another very clever thing about the paper-path design on the DMP 
is that the tractor mechanism (those wheels with little pins that grab the

t Right now; no one knows. This is 
partly because many would consider 
the very idea frivolous. But it's also 
because whoever successfully ans- 
wers this question must first have 
answered several others. 

Why do we cry? Why do we 
laugh, or love, or smile? What are the 
touchstones of our emotions? 

Untd now, the people who asked 
such questions tended not to be 
the same people who ran software 
companies. Instead, they were 
writers, filmmakers, painters, musi- 
cians. They were, in the traditional 
sense, artists. 

We're about to change that 
tradition.The name of our company 
is Electronic Arts. 

Software WORTHY 

OF THE MINDS THAT 

USE IT We are a new association 
of electronic artists united by a com- 
mon goal — to fulfill the enormous 
potential of the personal computer. 

In the short term, this means 
transcending its present use as a facili- 
tator of unimaginative tasks and 
a medium for blasting aliens. In the 
long term, however, we can expect 
a great deal more. 

These are wondrous machines 
we have created, and in them can be 
seen a bit of their makers. It is as if 
we had invested them with the image 
of our minds. And through them, we 
are learning more and more about 
ourselves. 

M We learn, for instance, that we 
are more entertained by the involve- 
ment of our imaginations than 
by passive viewing and listening.We 
learn that we are better taught by 
experience than by memorization. 
And we learn that the traditional 



distinctions — the ones that are made 
between art and entertainment and 
education — don't always apply. 

TOWARD A LANGUAGE 

OF DREAMS. In short, we 
are finding that the computer can be 
more than just a processor of data. 

It is a communications medium: 
an interactive tool that can bring 
people's thoughts and feelings closer 
together, perhaps closer than ever 
before. And while fifty years from 
now, its creation may seem no more 
important than the advent of motion 
pictures or television, there is a 
chance it will mean something more. 

Something along the lines of 
a universal language of ideas and 
emotions. Something like a smile. 
EThe first publications of Electronic 
Arts are now available. We suspect 
you'll be hearing a lot about them. 
Some of them are games like you've 
never seen before, that get more 
out of your computer than other 
games ever have. Others are harder 
to categorize — and we like that. 

WATCH US . We're providing 
a special environment for talented, 
independent software artists. It's 
a supportive environment, in which 
big ideas are given room to grow. 
And some of America's most re- 
spected software artists are beginning 
to take notice. 

We think our current work reflects 
this very special commitment.

holes on the side of the page and push the paper through) does not fol- 
low the print head on the path, but precedes it. Thus, you can tear off a 
page you just printed without form feeding to the top of the next page 
first. If you're new to all this, what that means is that many printers make 
you waste a page each time you print. The DMP does not. 

So what about its options? What's it got? Lotsa things! Underlining, 
boldfacing, elongated printing, proportional spacing (two different sizes), 
graphics, foreign language character sets. Several options seem to exist 
but lack the documentation or software to work. For instance, the demo 
program cheerfully tells you, "function not available," when you select 
"download character set" from its menu. Maybe later. 

The documentation is unique. The booklet that comes with the DMP 
tells you all die simple stuff in simple language, a feat other printer docu- 
mentation writers have yet to master. Apple also provides a reference 
card for the more technically minded. What seems to be lacking is some- 
thing in between to desaibe what the notes on the reference card mean. 
Some things can be discovered by trial and error. Some can't — like load- 
ing custom character sets. 

All in all, the DMP is an excellent printer. There are some things that 
no printer manufacturer yet has made easy. Apple did these things no 
worse than anyone else. Many things, however, they have done refresh- 
ingly right.

Hi-Res Computer Golf 2, Pro Courses Series. By Stuart Aronoff. Grab 
your mashie and niblick and head for the links. Hi-Res Computer Golf is 
back, this time as a well-done simulation of the real thing. 

Avant-Garde's game features a master disk with practice sections 
and a beginner's course. On the back of the disk is the first in a series of 
Pro Courses sets, each to contain three eighteen-hole golf links. The three 
courses on the first Pro disk are called, "An Atlanta Course," "Hot- 
rock," and "Glass Mountain," each corresponding to a world-class golf 
course in real life. Part of the fun is trying to figure out which courses 
these are supposed to be. Rather like a Harold Robbins novel. 

The game itself is a good attempt to simulate the conditions under 
which golf is played and the decisions that face the player on each hole. 
Aside from the expected water hazards (mark them well), roughs, and 
woods that are par for the course in any computer golf game, Hi-Res 
Golf 2 takes the wind into account. An on-screen indicator shows the fre- 
quently shifting wind direction and velocity. The holes take up as much 
as three full screens each, and the greens are marked with arrows show- 
ing the contours of their slopes. 

But what makes Avant-Garde's golf games truly unique is the act of 
hitting the ball. After the player selects a club, determines how hard to hit 
the ball, and chooses the direction of the shot, the swing sequence be- 
gins. The picture dissolves to a tee and ball downscreen and a clubhead 
at the top. Swinging involves guiding the clubhead through a path of 
lines by tapping a key eight or nine times, changing the angle of the club- 
head with each tap. If you don't tap just right, you'll end up hooking, 
slicing, topping, or undercutting the ball — which means the ball doesn't 
go as far as you wanted or goes in the wrong direction. Klutzes (that vast 
body of us who never could put the shot in Microsoft Decathlon) can eas- 
ily miss the ball altogether. 

For the real duffer, Hi-Res Golf 2 has thoughtfully provided an auto- 
matic swing option that ensures a perfect swing each time the ball is ad- 
dressed. There's also a maximum-strokes option that limits the number 
of swings allowed on each hole to double par. If you surpass the maxi- 
mum, you simply go on to the next hole. 

Notably improved in the new version of Hi-Res Golf are the graph- 
ics, the roll of the ball, and the action of the ball on the green. In the 
original version, water hazards, sand traps, trees, and greens were por- 
trayed with block shapes. In the new version, they're irregularly shaped 
for an effect much closer to real life. The ball travels more realistically, 
slowing down drastically when rolling through the rough. And in put- 
ting, the strength of the swing has a more realistic influence; in the old 
version, no matter how hard the ball was hit, the ball would go into the 
cup if the aim was true. 

The Pro Courses are challenging, exciting courses, each providing a 
unique game. Learning to play each course takes several enjoyable 



rounds even for the most adept player. 

Overall, Hi-Res Golf 2 stands out among computer sports games. It is 
challenging and has full variety. With the automatic swing option off, the 
combination of strategy and physical coordination required is un- 
matched in any computer sports simulation. Most of all, it's fun.

Police Artist. By Elizabeth Levin. Police Artist is an electronic version of 
Mr. Potato Head, souped up with the accouterments of today's urban 
crime. The program offers three variations on the theme of recognizing 
distinct facial characteristics. 

Police Lineup presumes you've witnessed a crime and sneaks you a 
quick look at the perpetrator. Then dozens of nefarious suspects flash by 
as though you were looking from face to face along a police lineup. Can 
you recognize the villain? You can eliminate people you're sure aren't the 
criminal; the rest continue to parade until you eliminate them or identify 
the blackguard. If you succeed, your turn continues with a different 
criminal and new suspects. Accusing the wrong person ends the round 
and establishes your score. 

The game claims to be able to generate one million distinct faces, so 
the combinations of characteristics are rarely the same. Amazingly, each 
of these million faces— at least, as many as you're apt to see— appears to 
have a unique name, a feature that adds personality and a touch of real- 
ity to the faces. 

A more challenging program is the title game. Police Artist. In this 
game, you get to see the criminal a bit longer, at least on low skill levels. 
Then, like a real police artist re-creating a face feature by feature, you 
must build the criminal's face piece by piece, starting with its shape. Was 
it a square face, an oval face, a round face? Did the suspect have bushy 
eyebrows? Curly haii^ Were the lips thin or full? It's amazing how fast 
you can forget details in the face of alternatives, even when you knew to 
remember. 

The third program, Off Duty is especially for doodling. At your dis- 
posal are sixteen noses, sixteen ears, sixteen mouths, sixteen chins, six- 
teen pairs of eyes, sixteen sets of cheekbones, and sixteen scalps — with or 
without hair and millinery. You can make faces all day long— and no 
one will tell you your face is going to stick that way. . . . This is elec- 
tronic Mr. Potato Head at its best, a delight to play with. 

All the suspects have bizarre facial characteristics; every one would 
do well at an open-call audition for bad guys to play in the Dick Tracy 
comic strip. Although the characters are definitely cartoonlike, individ- 
uals seeking the harmless, positive children's world suggested by Police 
Artist author Elizabeth Levin's role in developing computer games for 
the Sesame Place amusement park may prefer to stick with Mr. Potato 
Head.

Pipeline. The observation that the computer wastes a lot of time waiting 
for the printer to give it the high sign sparked the development of the 
printer buffer for the Apple. The concept is simple: The Apple is able to 
send characters out at mind-boggling speed, but the printer can only han- 
dle maybe a hundred characters a second, more or less. Without a buff- 
er, the Apple and the printer have a dialogue like this: 

Apple (quickly): Okay, here's the file. 

Printer (lazily): Slow down, give it to me a little at a time! 

Apple: Okay, but hurry up about it. 

(pause) 

Apple: You done yet? 
Printer Just a few more characters. . . . 
Apple (after a beat): Well? 
Printer. Okay, let's have some more. 
Apple: It took you long enough. Here's the rest- 
Printer Hey, wait a minute! 

As you can imagine, this doesn't make for a very happy relationship 
between the Apple and its right-hand peripheral. With a print buffer in- 
stalled, it's more like this: 



168 



s n r T A I 1/ 



JUNE 1983 



Apple: Here's the file. I want to see the printout first thing in the 

morning. 
Printer Right, boss! 

And so everybody's happy! Your Apple's got time to do more 
spreadsheeting or word processing, or even to play a quick game. The 
printer doesn't have the Apple breathing down its neck anymore, and 
you don't have to put up with their constant bickering. 

The Pipeline is such a printer buffer, but it's smarter than most. Not 
being content to just sit there spoon-feeding the printer, it serves the add- 
ed function of dealing with more than one chunk of output at a time. It 
has a mode called random-access printing (RAP), which allows the stor- 
age and retrieval of multiple files. Once a file is stored in the Pipeline's 
memory and given a name, you can then store another, and another, and 
so on until the Pipeline either runs out of names or memory. It allows as 
many as sixty-two different single-character names and can have from 
8K to 128K of RAM (memory can be added by the user). 

Pipeline calls each of these chunks of printout a bucket. A bucket 
can hold a word processor file (or part of one), a hi-res screen dump, 
spreadsheet or database information, or anything that can be printed 
out. Once all the buckets you want are in the Pipeline, you can send them 
from there to the printer in any sequence you want. So you can create 
two buckets, each with a half page of text, and print them out with a 
chart or table in the middle. Or you can print the same file a number of 
times without tying up your computer. 

The Pipeline is not without its drawbacks. The command characters 
are not really memorable, so you'd have to use it fairly frequently before 
they became second nature. Fortunately, there are only twelve different 
commands, and they're summarized at the end of the manual. Another 
problem is that, if you forget what's in a bucket, the only way to find out 
is to print it. 

On the plus side, because it has a separate power supply, the Pipeline 
can hold on to information while the Apple is off. This, as well as the 
random-access capability, is unique among print buffers. DD

Caves of Olympus. By Thomas and Patrick Noone. The hub of the em- 
pire is the imperial planet of Olympus. There the empire is ruled by a 
Vario-500 robot named Anson Argyris. You are that robot and you 
seem to be in a lot of trouble! The planet is being invaded by ruthless Lar- 
ens who are trying to conquer the empire. The defenses of the palace 
have been breached, and all your elite household troops have been killed. 
The only avenue of escape lies in the caves below the palace. Deep with- 
in those caves is a secret escape ship. But the caverns are heavily booby- 
trapped and quite treacherous. 

Anson Argyris is an egg-shaped robot, a little more than fifty centi- 
meters tall. Disguise is easy; Argyris can wear various cocoon-masks. 



When wearing a cocoon-mask, it can pass for human. Scattered through- 
out the caves are many masks, allowing Argyris to assume critical iden- 
tities. One special mask is that of the emperor. When wearing that mask, 
the robot is allowed access to restricted areas. 

Many transport chambers exist within the caves, mostly one-way. 
Unfortunately, the transports operate erratically; so sometimes you are 
transported into death traps. In fact, the pitfalls and traps are so numer- 
ous that it will take even the hardiest adventurer many attempts to get 
through this adventure. 

The walls of the caves are nothing more than projected energy. What 
may seem solid and impassible will open up with the correct identifica- 
tion item or phrase. Almost nothing is what it appears to be. Many blind 
alleys are actually doorways to other sections, usable only when the mys- 
tery of their opening is solved. 

A variety of unfriendly guard robots, aliens, and pursuing Larais are 
frequently encountered within the caves. The aliens are treasure-seeking 
adventurers who have gotten trapped in the mazes of the caves. Some of 
the aliens will even assist in Argyris's escape; so don't shoot everyone! 
The fiercest opponent is a deadly, nine-foot-tall Halutian battle-robot, 
which resembles a mobile fortress. 

Caves of Olympus is intended to be deadly and difficult. The game 
certainly tries to live up to that reputation! It is definitely not for novice 
adventurers. 

Although the game is in hi-res, the quality of the graphics is negligi- 
ble. There are, however, several sequences of special visual effects. The 
game is also enhanced by frequent atmospheric sound effects. You can 
hear the closeness of a blaster shot.

West 62nd Street, Indianapolis, IN 46268; 317-298-5566). $39.95. 
The Secret Guide to Computers, tenth edition. By Russ Walter. A fa- 
miliar figure at computer shows in the Boston area has been New Eng- 
land's unofficial computer guru, Russ Walter. Walter attends these 
shows dressed in an eye-catching black wizard's outfit, complete with 
wide-brimmed conical hat. He has long sought to demystify computer 
technology for the ordinary person. 

The Secret Guide to Computers series is a funny, irreverent look at 
computers and how they work. The material is culled from special semi- 
nars that Walter has been giving since 1978. Many of the computer lead- 
ers in New England are alumnae of Walter's courses. 

The books stress working understanding rather than the high-tech 
mumbo jumbo encountered in the usual computer store. The Secret 
Guide to Computers assumes nothing. The first instruction is "Turn the 
computer on." This type of thoroughness is reassuring to a new comput- 
er owner. The book proceeds, with many witty asides, to give you funda- 
mental step-by-step instruction. You never get the feeling that Walter is 
on some Olympian height looking down at the poor struggling neo-

phyte. Rather, you fed that Walter is right at your elbow, figuring it out 
with you for the first time. 

His books are reminiscent of an old-fashioned medicine show. They 
have high energy, humor, and a definite flair. The books also have a lot of 
straight talk. Walter pulls no punches, firing well-deserved salvos at many 
saaed cows. This incredible series is now in its tenth edition; Walter is 
constantly updating the volumes to reflect technology changes. 

The series consists of eight volumes. Popular Basic, Hassles in Basic, 
Popular Systems, Hassles in Systems, Popular Applications, Hassles in 
Applications, Popular Languages, and Hassles in Languages. 

For his readers, Walter provides the ultimate in corporate support. 
When you buy even one volume of the set, you get the right to call 
Walter and ask any question relating to computers, twenty-four hours a 
day. It isn't just a gimmick. He has been providing this unique phone 
support for five years. 

The Secret Guide to Computers series has long been a cult hit in New 
England. Because Russ Walter publishes the series himself and doesn't 
bother much with distribution, few people elsewhere have heard of it ex- 
cept via the electronic grapievine. 

Each volume of the series contains a letter from the author, closing 
with, "At your service, your computer butler, Russ Walter." This butler 
comes with some of the finest references in the industry, and you know 
how hard it is to find decent help these days. RRA 
The Secret Guide to Computers, tenth edition, by Russ Walter (92 Saint Botolph 
Street, Boston, MA 02116; 617-266-8128) $3.70 per volume, $29.60 for the set. 

Boa. By George Smith and Lee Daniels. Finally, a game you can actual- 
ly win. 

It's all too often that long hours at the computer come to an end with 
the screen arrogantly flashing "game over" in the face of the drained 
player. The game doesn't tell you you've lost; you assume that much. 
The scene is familiar: You finish all the levels or screens the game has to 
offer, then you go back and do it all over again, sometimes faster, some- 
times harder. 

Boa isn't like that. There is a definite end to the game, and if you 
reach it, you win. Fair and square. 

The game's layout is a maze, and you control a snake. So far, it looks 
suspiciously like Serpentine; but that's where the similarities end. The ob- 
ject of Boa is to get through all levels and eventually recover a hidden 
jewel. Pursuing you at each level are nasty little white mice who would 
like nothing more than to eat you from the tail on up. That's rather 
strange, since you're several times bigger than they are; sort of like Herve 
Villechaize devouring Mr. T. 

You can eat the mice, too. In fact, that's just about the only way you 
advance levels, by finishing the little rodents off And characteristic of lit- 
tle rodents, given time, they turn into big rodents; in this case, they be- 
come big white rats. How they change from one genus to another is 
anybody's guess, but they're worth big points if you eat them when 
they're rats. 

All during the game, Frizzard the enchanted frog appears and dis- 
appears. The game's instructions tell you that kissing Frizzard is another 
way to advance levels, but the frog hops randomly from place to place 
and rarely stays in one spot long enough for your boa to kiss it. 

Once you've found and wrapped your boa around the hidden jewel, 
you're treated to what Micro Magic calls "a surprise ending." Unfor- 
tunately, if your boa isn't long enough to wrap itself around the jewel 
(those mice get hungry), you'll never see the surprise, and the game sim- 
ply ends. No fanfare, no parade. 

Boa gives you the option to use either a joystick, the keyboard, pad- 
dles, or an Atari-type joystick, and you can select one of nine levels of dif- 
ficulty to play. The animation isn't as smooth as in many other games; 
rodents and reptiles tend to bunny hop rather than crawl and slither. 

One thing Boa isn't is a test of endurance. Getting through a game at 
its easiest level usually takes no more than ten minutes. On the other 
hand, it's also not a game that is so hard that you lose within one or two 
minutes. 

However long it takes to finish the game, whether you win or not, 
you'll never be told the game is over. fITV 
Boa, by George Smith and Lee Daniels, Micro Magic (908 Memorial Parkway, 
N.W., Suite C, Huntsville, AL 35801; 205-536-1290). $29.95.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS

Travelers on the Orient Express got to see a whole lot of Europe, 
especially if they stopped now and then. From Calais to Belgrade, every 
stop they made on this grand dame of railways deposited them in a 
terminal. Some terminals were immense and elegant, like Grand Central 
Station, full of activity; some were tiny depots where travelers were lucky 
if the clerk knew when the next train was due — if there was a clerk. 

Information is a traveler on a telecommunications railway; and data 
can stop only at a terminal. Some terminals are immense (or small) and 
elegant, called smart terminals; and some are small and plain, called 
dumb terminals. IBM 370s, HP 3000s, and Apples with modems are 
smart terminals for information; dumb terminals are keyboard-clad ma- 
chines with modems that can't add two and two on their own but enable 



their users to manipulate far-away smarter computers. 

"Which Way Did He Go, George?" Smart terminals can pretend to 
be dumb ones, and they don't mind a bit. Even your Apple can pretend 
to be as dumb as your old Underwood if you like. 

But why on earth would you like? Well, if your company happened 
to run its large applications on a big mainframe, your Apple, playing the 
role of a dumb terminal, could be your means of doing your work di- 
rectly on that corporate system from your own office or home. 

To run as a dumb terminal, and even to run elegantly as a smart 
terminal, the Apple with a modem depends on terminal software. Most 
terminal programs are general-purpose.

popular is the electronic mail program. Electronic mail programs are de- 
signed to take advantage of ofF-times when phone rates are cheaper — 
they do the work so you can sleep — and offer an assortment of message 
arrangements. Most contain automatic clock features, so you can have 
your Apple send mail out at specific times to various places. 

Now newer terminal packages often include the expanded electronic 
mail modules along with general terminal programs. 

Some word processors include terminal functions or work with op- 
tional associated programs to achieve them. These functions are general- 
ly limited to the transmission of files created on the word processor. 

The ultimate terminal package is the bulletin board system. Many 
BBSs are used for hobbyist centers; the phone numbers are publicized, 
encouraging any modem user to call. The atmosphere often resembles 
that of a user group. 

But bulletin board software can be well used on a private basis, too. 
Any situation in which frequent exchange of electronic mail or messages 
within a defined group of people is desirable, or in which round-the- 
clock accessibility is needed, is good for a bulletin board system. 

A Fishy Business. Getting into telecommunications is a bit like get- 
ting into tropical fish. You need a good grip on exactly what you want 
and what you want to do with it (if you want to breed, consider guppies; 
for beauty, perhaps angelfish. But not both: The angelfish will eat the 
guppies' babies), then find out what you need for what you want (a sim- 
ple bowl for goldfish, a temperature-controlled aquarium of so many 
cubic feet per so many fish for tropical), then choose the specific items. 
(Aerator? Plants? Tacky statues?) In telecommunications, some deci- 
sions you make affect everything you do from then on. For example, 
which modem you choose determines many of the choices you'll make 
after that. The next thing you need is a terminal program. 

Terminal Programs Strut Their Stuff. The terminal programs that 
come with the Hayes Micromodem and the Novation Apple-Cat II offer 
good results — without fancy extras — at no extra cost. But they're limited 
in their capacities. 

Data Capture 4.0 is a low-cost terminal package with a minimum of 
frills and considerable features. ASCII Express Pro costs more but offers 
a multitude of features. These are fine for general use and for some up- 
loading and downloading, although complications can set in with in- 
compatible programs on the other end of the phone wire. Apple Link 
hasn't quite the fancy features, but you never need to worry about what's 
at the other end of the wire. Because Apple Link connects to and does 
business with any terminal with a modem on-line, whoever's at the other 
end needs no program at all. 

If you need to send electronic mail to a fixed group of people or to 
leave an open line for others calling in to check on messages, consider a 
bulletin board package. Formats vary widely, from the thoughtfully 
subject-oriented CommuniTree to the name and chronology oriented 
Net-Works II. If all your callers have Apples, regular terminal packages 
Micro/Courier and Transend 3 will get the job done. 

Ignorance Is Bliss. Finally, if you're planning to condemn your Ap- 
ple to ignorance a lot — using it as a dumb terminal through which to op- 
erate a remote computer — VisiTerm may fit the bill. It offers APL char- 
acters, visible control characters, and a place to design characters of 
your own. 

Data Capture 4.0. Data Capture is a complete terminal program 
that's inexpensive and reliable. Like most terminal programs, it can be 
used, for the most part, only while you're tending it. There's no auto- 
matic mode. Also lacking is automatic redial. 

Data Capture 4.0 does have a simple-to-use menu driving it, and it 
gives you five hundred lines per file, variable baud rate, special charac- 
ters (with a lower-case chip), full or half-duplex transmission, and, of 
course, efficient uploading and downloading. A special plus is that you 
can make a backup and modify Data Capture 4.0. 

Data Capture works with the Micromodem II, the Apple Communi- 
cations Card, and the A.I.O. card. 

There's little macro capability; the program offers two automatic log- 
on procedures, one for the Source and one for Dow Jones. Because Da- 
ta Capture is unlocked, you can look at these and use them as a guide for 
adding other log-on routines. 

The text editor that comes in the package limits messages to ten lines. 



When the line counter reaches five hundred, the program automati- 
cally sends a signal to the other computer to stop sending. It then dumps 
the file to the disk and prepares to receive the next five hundred lines. 

Data Capture can convert Integer Basic and Applesoft programs to 
text files and send or receive them. 

Micro/ Courier. In the tradition of Sky Masterson, Micro /Courier's 
day is the wee small hours of the morning. Then, when rates are cheap 
and lines uncrowded, and when you're peacefully sleeping, it can send 
and receive text files, programs, data, and graphics. Once you've told it 
what you want it to do and when, it no longer needs your attention. 

Although its editor has a 6K limitation, the program can send files of 
any length. Messages or files can be sent to as many as one hundred dif- 
ferent telephone numbers, as long as each has a Micro/Courier for re- 
ceiving from you. By distinguishing telephone numbers by mailbox IDs, 
the program is able to maintain twenty-six lists of a hundred numbers 
each. This way, for example, a businessperson could send a report to all 
market analysts on the company payroll; with a clock, a pubhcist could 
send a timed press release to numerous publications by entering the mes- 
sage, list of publications, and time of release only once. 

Micro/ Courier keeps a log of messages that have been sent and mes- 
sages that are ready. The log contains the message selection, current 
status, addressee ID, and the name of the file. It can also keep track of all 
incoming messages. 

If you need electronic mail capability, Micro/Courier is one proven 
solution. 

Micro/Terminal. Micro/ Terminal is an expanded version of the 
terminal program used in Micro/ Courier. It's completely menu-operated 
and easy to understand even without reference to its well-done manual. 

The program uses macros extensively; fifteen lines, from A to O, can 
be filled with them, giving users a broad scope of rapid control. For ex- 
ample, you can set a macro to enter any network automafically, giving 
passwords and required directions to get you to precisely the subsec- 
tion or area you're after. 

There are no limits on the length of file Micro/ Terminal can send or 
receive; when the lOK receiving buffer is full, the program sends a stop 
command to the host computer, saves the information on disk, and then 
tells the host to continue. 

Micro/ Terminal allows only text files; it has no provision for trans- 
lating basic programs into text files. 

Transend 1, 2, 3. The three Transend packages are rather like the 
house that Jack built: / is itself; 2 contains / plus a bunch more; 3 con- 
tains 2, which contains /, plus a bunch more. Owners of / or 2 can up- 
grade to a higher model for the difference in price plus a handling charge. 

All versions are completely menu-driven. Unique and convenient are 
screen-bottom references to the manual pages that deal with that screen. 
All versions work with more than forty combinations of serial and 
parallel interfaces, with most modems and modem interfaces, with 
Sup'R'Term, Smarterm, and Videoterm eighty-column boards, and with 
various clock cards. 

Rather than using macros — on the theory, according to coauthor 
Tim Dygert, that Transend is intended for people who don't necessarily 
want to know everything about telecommunication to use it — Transend 
uses eight parameter groups. Once these are configured, choosing one 
automatically sets all those parameters. 

Print and capture buffers in Transend I can be set for incoming data, 
outgoing data, or both. Transend 2 adds automatic file transfer verifica- 
tion where both sender and receiver are Transends. Both / and 2 have 
limited editors. Transend 3 has full editing capabilities and electronic 
mail. In 3, programs for transfer can be queued. And 3 can be config- 
ured to one hundred addresses and one hundred local mailboxes. 

Transend 3 also offers detached mailboxes. A person with an as- 
signed detached box can have a password and receive a disk with a word 
processor. Such a person can compose electronic mail on the disk and be 
assured that operators sending and receiving the disk's contents can't 
read them. If an operator should figure out the password and read the 
mail, the password holder gets a message that someone has been tam- 
pering with the mail. 

Finally, the Transends compress and decompress files — taking out 
blank areas and repeated characters for transfer and then restoring them.

Compression can cut the size of transmissions by as much as 40 percent. 

VisiTerm. The first efficient software implementation of lower case 
on an Apple II wasn't that in ScreenWriter's predecessor's predecessor, 
Superscript, but in VisiTerm, which also provides eighty-column text 
without hardware. There's also provision for user-designed characters, a 
neat feature for communicating in German or Bezardian. 

Although VisiTerm allows nearly two hundred fifty characters in a 
macro, it has no automatic redial. A selection of protocols broadens the 
range of computers you can communicate with, and, although VisiTerm 
transfers only text files, its utilities provide for changing Applesoft, In- 
teger Basic, and binary files into DOS text files. Watch out, though: The 
binary files double in size in the translation. 

VisiTerm's buffer limit is 18K, and it won't stop and save automati- 
cally when it's full. You must enter a code to stop the program, save, and 
then continue to receive under a new file name. 

Although a fitting companion for its VisiSiblings, VisiTerm is harder 
to use than most of the other terminal programs. 

ASCII Express: The Professional. Bill Blue's update to ASCII 
Express is extremely flexible and surprisingly easy to use. 

Macro-oriented AEPro can cope with baud rates up to 4800 when 
interfaced with an eighty-column board and at least 9600 when inter- 
faced with a terminal capable of that. AEPro claims to work with all 
available hardware for the Apple II, including modems and eighty-col- 
umn boards, and we weren't able to disprove it. It can run from a hard 
disk but changes some defaults. 

The editor is line-oriented but has free cursor movement. Its 18K 
buffer can be expanded to 25. 5K with memory management. In an 
Apple with a 16K RAM card, you get another 7.5K automatically, for a 
grand total of 33K. 

AEPrds macro system is so extensive that you can set up specialized 
turnkey disks. Onto a new disk, copy the relevant parts of AEPro 
configured with appropriate macros. Booting the disk will automatically 
log onto the system you've set it for and go to the spot you want to be 
without any help from you. Such a turnkey program begins dialing by 
itself and, if there's a problem, redials as many times as you've con- 
figured it to. 

Also via macros, you can configure your Apple to emulate other 
terminals, from a DEC to a Hazeltine to a Soroc. 

With an automatic modem, you can leave AEPro unattended; no one 
will be allowed to log on without the password. With the Apple-Cat II in 
the 212 option, AEPro adjusts its baud rate to that of the caller. 

AEPro transfers any type of file; changes the format of DOS files to 
Pascal or CP/M or vice versa; changes binary, Applesoft, or Integer 
Basic programs to text files, automatically logs onto host computers with 
auto-answerback; provides auto-answerback for electronic mail; and ac- 
cepts mail from a forwarding mail system, saving it on disk at the con- 
clusion of the call. 

Extensive help screens, a brief mode that prints only cursory mes- 
sages, file compression, freedom to jump around various elements while 
in terminal mode without messing anything up, the abihty to do full 
interrupts, and a printer buffer that prevents data loss — these are a few of 
the extras. 

Hayes Terminal Program. The Hayes Terminal Program that comes 
with the Micromodem II contains a Dow Jones converter for the Dow 
Jones Portfolio Evaluator, the program of the same name available sep- 
arately consists of a terminal program only. 

The Hayes Terminal Program is menu-driven and works with DOS, 
Pascal, and CP/M files. Changing operating systems is simple. It's ca- 
pable of communicating at 1 10 or 300 baud and works with as many as 
six disk drives, several printer interface cards, and the Videoterm, 
Sup'R'Term, and Smarterm eighty-column cards. 

Macro capability is limited to storing three telephone numbers. The 
program offers only three standard protocols. 

On the other hand, a good manual provides instruction on writing 
special programs for the Micromodem II. 

Com-Ware II. When you buy an Apple-Cat II modem, this soft- 
ware comes as part of the package. Com- Ware II does a whole lot more 
when one Cat's talking to another than when a Cat strays into the com- 
pany of another brand modem. For example, it can transfer data at 1200 



baud— between two Cats. It can perform checksum tests to verify the 
contents of memory at any time — between two Cats. 

Com-Ware II takes control of the Apple and the Cat II for terminal 
operation. It sends and receives data in binary or text formats; it can con- 
vert Applesoft and Integer Basic programs into binary files and back; 
and it works with a wide variety of printers and host computers. 

Com-Ware' % autodial accepts fifty-six digits, delays, and waits for dial 
tones. Pressing one key redials after a busy signal. With a phone handset 
connected, you can talk to your contact by voice, then put down the tele- 
phone to send data. 

When the Apple is being used as a terminal, you can choose to have 
the memory on or off In unattended answer mode, the terminal will 
automatically answer. 

The editor in Com-Ware II is very simple. 

Word Processors and Electronic Mail. A few word processors don't 
need separate terminal programs for transmitting their files. 

Executive Secretary comes with a built-in electronic mail package to 
send or receive text files through a Micromodem II, selectable from the 
main menu. 

Once in that mode, the program will send or receive; the correspon- 
dent must have Executive Secretary or another terminal program on-line. 
If you have a clock in your Apple, you can tell the program when to 
send. You can send the entire contents of a disk by queuing up the files. 
Files are verified as they're sent; but only draft versions are sent, without 
formatting or other instructions. 

Executive Secretary's terminal mode is merely for file transfer. It 
doesn't allow you to communicate in any other way. 

Letter Perfect can be configured to send output to a Micromodem II 
instead of a printer. That means you can print in Peoria what you write 
in Mandalay. The computer in Peoria doesn't need Letter Perfect to re- 
ceive; Letter Perfect documentation includes a short listing of a printer 
program to be used in the receiving Apple, although any terminal pro- 
gram set to receive text files should allow transfer. 

Zip-Comm, an optional companion to Zardax, converts the Apple 
into a terminal; you are in full communication with the correspondent. 
The receiver need not be an Apple; anything Zardax can print can be 
sent. You can dump, draft, or print whatever file is in memory to the 
other machine through an acoustic coupler or a modem, including the 
Micromodem II. The program allows for 300 or 1200 baud. 

A separate utility disk adds the Zip-Comm commands to Zardax it- 
self, after which you can choose telecommunication mode from the main 
menu of the word processor. The utility disk is free with Zip-Comm or 
from Zardax dealers. Once you've set up your Zardax disk with the sys- 
tem, it's easy to reconfigure for various kinds of communication. 

A unique option is that of having an entire terminal session saved in 
Zardax text memory for a permanent record. 

A counter on-screen keeps track of how much space is left as data is 
coming in. When less than 256 characters' space is left, each character 
clicks to remind you to send a stop to the correspondent, rename and 
save the file, and then resume.

C R A P n C A L L Y SPEAK 



N G 





by lark P e I c z o r s k I 



Last month we looked at a way to pack down the storage require- 
ments of a standard 8K screen picture. While the method described can 
easily quadruple the number of pictures you can fit on a disk, it is not the 
solution for applications that require more than, say, fifty pictures per 
disk. The type of program that immediately comes to mind is the adven- 
ture game, in which you want to be able to display views of dozens, even 
hundreds, of locations easily. Any kind of program that requires a large 
amount of graphic information requires even better packing techniques. 
(On the other hand, Sherwood Forest, an adventure game for which Dav 
Holle did the graphics, does successfully use the packing routine pre- 
sented last time). 

When Ken and Roberta Williams wrote the first graphic adventure. 
Mystery House (with line drawings), and followed it with Wizard and the 
Princess (adding color), they used an interesting technique: They didn't 
store the pictures at all, just the information needed to reassemble them. 
Why store the pictures if you can tell the computer how to draw them, 
especially if telling the computer how to draw them requires much less in- 
formation (in bytes)? Okay, so we tell the computer how to draw the 
picture. 

Using a product that's a little close to home, because there's no other 
utility that does exactly this, we'll look at part of Graphics Magician. In 
Graphics Magician there is a picture-drawing utility, which in many ways 
is similar to others around. With it you can use paddles or a joystick to 
draw lines, fill areas with color, or draw with a set of "paintbrushes." 
The difference is, it doesn't just show what you've drawn on the screen, it 
saves what you do: the artist's moves. It takes these moves and, 
unbeknownst to the artist, puts them into a little program. The program 
is saved into a binary file, and to reconstruct the drawing a special 
interpreter called Picdraw is used. Picdraw reads through the binary 
program and re-aeates the artist's moves at the speed of the computer, 
reassembling the picture right before your eyes, just as the artist 
originally drew it. 

How's it done? We'll take a simplified example of creating a picture 
with just lines and a fill routine (omitting some of the options in Magician for 
clarity's sake). Start with four possible actions by the artist: (1) set the 
starting point of a line; (2) draw a line from the starting point to a given 
endpoint; (3) choose a color for filling; and (4) fill an area with color. 
Give each of those actions an operation code (or opcode, as it's called in 
computerese). We'll actually add one more operation, "end of picture," 
for our use. Figure 1 shows the different operations and the information 
needed for each.

What we're doing is writing our own computer language. In a way 
it's much like Basic, except that, instead of writing programs by editing 
lines of code, you draw using a joystick or paddles and the picture editor 
saves the appropriate opcodes and data. 

Figure 2 shows a sample program with the actual information on the 
left and a description on the right. 

What have we done? Well, the first five instructions draw a square on 
the screen. Then the next two instructions fill the square with color 5 (for 
conversation, let's say color 5 is orange). The result is an orange square 
on the screen. If that's all we want in the picture, we've now compacted a 
hi-res screen from 8,192 bytes to 21! Of course, the more you draw, the 
more space it takes, but it's not unreasonable to get nice, detailed pic- 
tures in hundreds of bytes instead of thousands. 

The program in figure 2 is what the computer would see. The artist 
would just see the results. To create the program, the artist moves the 
joystick so that a cursor is at the desired position on the screen, pushes a 
button, and command 1 is automatically generated internally. Move the 
cursor to another position on the screen, push another button, a line ap- 
pears, and command 2 is generated inside the computer. And so it 
goes. . . . 

The Picdraw routine in Graphics Magician takes several other com- 
mands, most notably brushes. What are brushes on the computer? 
They're a neat little way to use character graphics. Remember the char- 
acter generator we did? Well, suppose we have a character generator that

will plot the characters in any X,Y position on the screen, not just in the 
regular text columns. Suppose also that we can do this in any color we 
want. Now let's redefine the character patterns so that instead of As, Bs, 
and Cs, we've got big dots, little dots, feathered dots, and whatever looks 
neat. Use the character generator to plot these wherever we want on the 
screen in whatever color we desire, and we have paintbrushes! How use- 
ful are they? Well, instead of coloring-book pictures with outlined fig- 
ures filled with certain colors, now the images can be shaded, boundary 
lines can be made to disappear, extra detail can be added. ... In other 
words, a lot more sophistication can be added to the pictures created. 

There are other tricks and benefits to using pictures created this way. 
One was designed; another was discovered by accident after several 
months of use. The picture interpreter, Redraw, gives two options. It can 
clear the screen before drawing the next picture, or it can draw the next 
picture over what's already there. Advantage: As with adventure games, 
in which objects can be moved from one room to another, object pic- 
tures can be drawn after the room picture, right on top of it, giving the il- 
lusion of being part of that same picture. Thus you can save innumer- 
able extra pictures by assembling a few components in different ways. Of 
course, adventure games use this technique a lot. Another example of its 
use is in a new Sir-tech product called Police Artist. In it, numerous vari- 
ations of facial parts are stored and then put together in different combi- 
nations to create thousands of different faces (their package says mil- 
lions, and they're probably right). 

The other neat trick, unbeknownst to us when Magician was writ- 
ten, is that you can animate using pictures created this way! The story 
goes that the first person who discovered it was drawing a man, finished 
the drawing, and then decided that the eyes weren't exactly right. In- 
stead of going back and deleting the moves that made the eyes in the first 
place, he just redrew over the eyes to get them the way he wanted. When 
the picture was redrawn with Picdraw, though, the man in the picture 
blinked! Recreating the artist's moves, the eyes were drawn one way, 
then, a split second later, redrawn another way. Since this discovery,

complete choreographed animations have been done by creating a pic- 
ture and drawing back over it dozens of times, with all the moves saved 
in the little binary picture program file. Neat stuff! 

For those of you who are really interested in exactly how the picture 
files are saved in Graphics Magician, figure 3 shows a breakdown of the 
currently used commands and their structure. Note that there's room for 
extra commands; these will be used for optional results and on other 
computers so that the picture programs can be transferred back and 
forth from an Apple to an Atari or Commodore or IBM, and so forth, 
with a minimum of fooling around required. The Picdraw routine, not 
listed here, consists of a line subroutine, a fill subroutine, a brush sub- 
routine, and an interpreter that reads and interprets the instructions and 
calls the appropriate subroutines to redraw the picture correctly. 

In the first byte of the instruction, the left four bits (four bits = one 
nibble) are used for the opcode. The right four bits are used for data. For 
example, the three-byte commands all need X and Y values, with X re- 
quiring more than one byte of storage. The high end of the X value is 
stored in the right nibble of the first byte. The low end of theX is stored 
in the second byte, and Y is stored in the third byte. In the line color and 
brush number commands, the right nibble is used to store that data. 
Since there are more than one hundred fill colors used, the set-fill-color 
command needs a second byte to store the appropriate number.

A SYSTEM CLOCK INTERRUPT DRIVER 

Bv JOHH jEPPson 



Would you like your Apple III to turn itself back on at the appoint- 
ed hour, ready to receive that important call on your modem? Or would 
you like your Apple III to rescue you from programmers' trance with a 
vital message, "Hurry up, jerk! She won't forgive you if you're late 
again"? Or perhaps you just want your Apple III to pause every minute, 
for a millisecond or so, to check a suspicious memory location in SOS 
... to see if it has changed. You need to use interrupts from the clock 
chip; that neat onboard real-time clock chip you recently installed in 
your Apple III. The one that Apple still won't admit exists. 

The clock chip. National Semiconductor MM58167, plugs right into 
an empty chip holder at B3 on the motherboard. Of course you will need 
to rig a battery backup. A couple of AA cells in series gives you 3.0 volts, 
which is sufficient. The battery site is a round hole on the edge of the 
motherboard conveniently labeled "batt." The top side of the hole is 
negative; positive is underneath. You'll have to attach some wires. Better 
yet, you can get the battery and the chip in a kit, with instructions. 

The MM58167 is the active element of Apple Ill's system clock. With 
this chip in place you have a functional, real-time, ticking clock that SOS 
will use to stamp all your files with the proper date and time. In addi- 
tion, the clock is accessible from your programs. In Basic it is easy to 
read the system clock with the reserved variables DATES and TIMES. In 
Pascal, the Applestuff Library Unit contains several procedures for set- 
ting and reading the clock. And in assembly language you can use the 
Get time and Set time SOS calls. It's true that Apple does grudgingly ad- 
mit that these facilities might be available. But they've never said a word 
about the interrupts; and there's a whole set of them. The interrupts are 
built-in features of the clock chip itself, and they are all nicely wired into 
Apple Ill's hardware, ready for you to use. 

The clock chip, MM58167, is an integrated circuit device largely in- 
dependent of the rest of the computer. It does require an external time 
reference, which consists of a 32,768 Hz crystal and a couple of capaci- 
tors. These are already present on the Apple III motherboard. One of the 
capacitors, capacitor C3, is a small tuning capacitor used to make fine 



adjustments in the clock's rate. You can get to it quite easily. Just re- 
move the five screws holding down the plastic cover around the key- 
board and lift the cover off. Then loosen the screws holding the key- 
board. The keyboard is a module. It lifts up as a unit. Nothing will fall 
apart. Under the keyboard is a neat little hole in the middle of the metal 
frame; in the hole is the capacitor. 

As in all crystal-controlled timepieces, the crystal's output frequency 
and the clock's rate vary a bit with temperature. No matter how careful- 
ly you adjust the tuning capacitor there is likely to be some small drift 
due to temperature fluctuations (less, perhaps, if your computer remains 
on all the time). Wristwatch electronic clocks enjoy the constant temper- 
ature of your wrist. But that is probably impractical with Apple III. 

Table 1 shows MM58167's pin connections. The eight pins marked 
DO through D7 constitute the data port through which the computer 
writes to or reads from the clock. The eight pins represent eight bits of 
one data byte. Pins AO through A4 are address lines. They represent five 
bits of an address byte. The locations addressed are various registers 
within the chip. A computer would, for example, write the value $C4 in- 
to clock register S08 by putting the bits for binary 8 (xxjcOlOOO) on the 
chip's five address lines and the bits for binary C4 (11000100) on the 
eight data lines. Then the computer would send a write command to the

control pins (RD = 1, WR = 0, CS = 0, RDY = 0), and MM58167 
would do the rest. In Apple III, however, the process turns out to be a bit 
more complicated, as we shall see. 

MM58167's power-down pin normally receives +5 volts from Ap- 
ple Ill's power supply, as does the input power line (PWR). Whenever 
voltage on the power-down pin drops to zero (as when you pull the 
plug), MM58167 enters a low-power operating mode. It remembers and 
counts time, but it does not respond to the I/O lines, and it uses very 
little power — power that now comes from battery backup. 

Table 2 shows the various registers in the clock. The addresses of 
these registers are each five bits in length, corresponding to the five ad- 
dress lines (AO through A4). Not all possible addresses are used. The 
computer writes or reads each register as an eight-bit byte. As far as the 
clock is concerned, however, each four-bit nibble functions independent- 
ly, which will be important to keep in mind. The counter and RAM 
registers are merely a grouping of two nibbles at a time for access by the 
host computer. 

Registers $00 through $07 are counters. They contain the actual time 
information being counted by the clock. All time information is stored in 
binary-coded decimal (BCD). Each four-bit nibble, therefore, contains 
one decimal digit. If register $06 (day-of-month) contains 15, then that 
indicates the fifteenth day of the month. Programs must transpose BCD 
back to hexadecimal or ASCII or whatever the caller requires. 

Two of the counter nibbles are never used the low nibble of register 
$00 (.001 seconds) and the high nibble of register $05 (day-of-week). 
These each permanently read 0. Similarly, several individual bits in other 
nibbles are never used by any legal time or date value. The highest month 
value, for example, is 12. So bits 5, 6, and 7 of register $07 can never le- 
gally be set. Such unused bits are also permanently zero and cannot be 
changed. 

Registers $08 to $0F are RAM. These registers are used as a com- 
parison latch. Each nibble corresponds to a similar nibble in the counter 
registers. You may store any values you wish in the comparison latch. 
Then you may command MM58167 to produce an alarm interrupt when 
the counters match up with the stored RAM values. Once again, the low 
nibble of register $08 and the high nibble of register $0D are permanent- 
ly zero. But, unlike the counters, all four bits in each of the other nibbles 
can be used. 

When you are setting up comparison values for an alarm interrupt 
(for example, an alarm at 1 1:30 a.m. today) it is not always necessary to 
specify every nibble to be matched up. If you set the higher two bits of 
any RAM nibble, then that value becomes a "don't-care" nibble and will 
always produce a match. This can never be confused with any "re- 
quired-match" values you might use. The highest legal BCD value of any

nibble is 9, but no BCD value in the range 0 to 9 has both higher bits set 
at once. Remember that we are talking about four-bit nibbles, not eight- 
bit bytes. If register $0B (RAM minutes) contains C5, then the tens-of- 
minutes nibble is a "don't-care" value, but the unit minutes (value 5) 
must still make a required match with the unit-minutes counter. 

The remaining registers, $10 through $16 and $1F, are control regis- 
ters. Register $1F (for which we have no documentation) is listed as test 
mode. Reading this register yields FF, which we sincerely hope is a de- 
sirable result. 

Register $ 14 is the status bit. SOS looks for this register to see if you 
have installed the clock. The real function of the status bit, however, is to 
notify you when a counter roll-over has occurred during a read opera- 
tion. If so, the status bit will contain $01 . If the clock ticks at the very mo- 
ment you are trying to read one of the counters, the read might yield an 
error. So you should check the status bit each time you have read a 
counter and reread if necessary until the status bit reports 00. 

Writing any value to register $15 executes the go command. This 
command does not start the clock; the clock always counts while power 
is applied. The go command merely resets the seconds and fractional- 
seconds counters to zero. It is useful when synchronizing the clock with 
the current real time. 

Registers $12 and $13 are designed to reset the counters and the 
RAM latches respectively. You are supposed to be able to reset individ- 
ual registers by writing a 1 at the bit position corresponding to that reg- 
ister. For example, writing 04 (00000100) to the counter reset (register 
$12) should reset only the seconds counter (register $02). But these reset 
controls simply do not work properly in Apple III, presumably due to the 
bizarre method by which Apple III addresses the clock. We'll get to that. 
It is possible to reset all the rasters by writing $FF, but it's not possible to 
reset individual registers by writing to particular bits. 

MM58167 has two interrupt modes, alarm mode and tick mode. 
Alarm mode interrupts are the type discussed previously. An alarm in- 
terrupt is triggered when all counter nibbles match up with stored values 
in the RAM comparison latch (some of which may be "don't-care" nib- 
bles). This type of interrupt is armed by writing a 1 into bit 0 of the inter- 
rupt control register (register $11). 

Tick interrupts occur at specified intervals: every second, every min- 
ute, and so on. These interrupts are armed by writing Is into other bits of 
the interrupt control register. Table 3 lists the interrupts that each bit 
controls. It is legal for several bits to be active at the same time. 

When the specified interrupt event occurs, two things happen. The 
interrupt line going to the 6502 becomes active, and the bit value appro- 
priate for that interrupt appears in the interrupt status register (register 
$10). The interrupt handler must clear the interrupt flag by reading the 
interrupt status register. This both clears and resets the interrupt. The 
value obtained can also be analyzed to determine which clock event trig- 
gered the interrupt, in case more than one is armed. The only way to dis- 
able these interrupts completely is to write $00 to the interrupt control 
register (register $11). 

These are ordinary, normal, everyday sorts of interrupts. MM58167's 
interrupt line becomes active and, by a devious route, pulls down the in- 
terrupt request line (IRQ) on the 6502 cpu chip. The 6502 then inter- 
rupts whatever it is doing and switches control (via SOS) to your inter- 
rupt handler. 

There is, however, a second, entirely different interrupt system avail- 
able on the MM58167 clock. This is a standby interrupt, used when the 
computer itself is turned off. The standby interrupt is a type of alarm in- 
terrupt. It occurs when all the counters match up with stored values in 
the comparison latch, exactly as in the alarm-mode interrupts discussed 
previously. In this case, however, the signal is sent on a different wire . . .

to one of the pins on the back of Apple III. And when, pray tell, did Ap- 
ple tell you about that? 

Pages 132 and 133 of the Apple III Owner's Guide contain a listing of 
pin connections in Apple Ill's color video port. Pin 4 is listed as "PDI 
Not used," a remarkable combination of label and denial. The manual 
doesn't say so, but PDI stands for power-down interrupt. 

Standby interrupts are armed by writing $01 to MM58167 register 
$16. They are both cleared and disabled by writing $00 to the same reg- 
ister. Standby interrupts are completely independent of the aforemen- 
tioned ordinary alarm and tick interrupts. And they have no effect on 
Apple Ill's internal interrupt-handling mechanism. 

The standby interrupt remains active while MM58167 is operating in 
its low-power mode — that is, after the computer itself is powered down. 
You can set this alarm for some future time and then turn off your 
machine. When the appointed hour arrives, the clock will pull down the 
interrupt wire connected to that external pin. With a few pieces of inex- 
pensive hardware you can detect that signal and use it to turn your com- 
puter back on again. The following diagram shows a typical schematic.

Addressing the Registers. The MM58167 clock chip was designed to 
have its registers mapped into a computer's memory space where the cpu 
could then address each register directly. In Apple III, however, the 6502 
cpu is surrounded and protected by a complicated bank-switching mech- 
anism, a mechanism that permits Apple III to handle 256K bytes of 
memory while using a cpu that can address only 64K bytes at a time. The 
fundamental technique is to use the output registers of two onboard 6522 
versatile interface adapters (VIAs) to provide extra address information 
for accessing memory. This extra information constitutes the extra ad- 
dress bits, or lines, required to create a unique address for each location 
in memory. 

Thus Apple Ill's bank register appears to be memory location 
$FFEF. Its value (the lower nibble) determines which 32K user memory 
bank is currently on-line. More accurately, $FFEF is the E-VIA's out- 
put register for I/O port A. A value placed here is sent onto address lines, 
which, in turn, form part of the address information selecting various re- 
gions of memory. Similarly, the zero page register, location $FFD0, is 
actually the D-VIA's output register for I/O port B. Its value determines 
which memory page will be used as the 6502's zero page. 

Access to MM58167 is much the same. The clock's eight data lines 
are mapped into ordinary memory space. They are connected to the 
eight bits of memory location $C070 (in I/O space). This is the clock's 
data port. But the clock's address lines, which select various clock regis- 
ters, are not part of an ordinary memory address. They are connected, 
instead, to D-VIA's output register for I/O port B, which is location 
$FFDO, more familiarly known as the zero-page register. So in order to 
access a particular clock register you must first write the desired register 
number to location $FFDO (D-VIAORB). The VIA, in turn, places 
those same address bits on MM58167's address lines. Then you write 
your data byte to location $C070, the clock's data port. 

For example, to place value $24 in the day-of-month counter

sta ioClock ; the clock's data port 

Remember that while reading counters the value obtained is unrelia- 
ble if a counter roll-over has occurred during the read. This circum- 
stance is detected by checking the status bit. The following, slightly more 
complicated routine will read and transfer all counter values to a buffer 
in memory:

This routine works fine provided "buffer" refers to a sixteen-bit ad- 
dress in the currently switched-in banks. But what would happen if your 
buffer were on zero page? Well, zero page is a variable, determined by 
the zero page register ($FFIX)), the very same register we have now re- 
defined as ClockReg. In this routine, zero page changes with every pass 
through the loop. So writing to a zero-page buffer would spray data all 
over the place. The same is true for extended addressing, which also uses 
zero-page registers. Furthermore, the xbyte mechanism in extended ad- 
dressing isn't even defined for zero pages outside the range $18 to $1F. 
The pitfalls of Apple III programming! 

As noted, the counter and comparison latch reset controls don't 
work. These controls use registers $12 and $13 respectively. We specu- 
late that the difficulty may be related to the 6502's method of perform- 
ing a write. First it reads, then it writes. So a write instruction (for exam- 
ple, STA $C070) actually produces two 0.98 microsecond pulses spaced 
24.43 nanoseconds apart. Perhaps this disturbs the clock, or the VIA. Or 
perhaps some other timing incompatibility exists among VIA, 6502, 
MM58167, and whatever else Apple III has mixed into the stew. In any

event the reset controls behave as though the clock begins accepting da- 
ta before the data-line information has become valid. So writing to the 
reset control registers causes MM58167 to reset a lot more registers than 
you really want it to. 

Such hardware incompatibilities may have been the trouble with Ap- 
ple Ill's system clock from the beginning. During our own experiments 
the other registers all appear to perform correctly. But the SOS routines 
that access the clock do go to great lengths for accuracy, reading and 
writing each register repeatedly and going over loops up to eight times. 
We hope all that is a relic of problems with some other clock chip. But 
for all we know the original chip was the same MM58167, or its proto- 
type. Apple maintains its customary silence. 

The access routines in SOS also slow the 6502 timing pulses clock to 
1 MHz while talking to the MM58167 clock. Doubtless you should too. 
Just set bit 7 of the environment register ($FFDF). The main virtue of 
slowing the 6502 clock, as we understand it, is greater length and regu- 
larity of the timing pulses. (No, the reset registers don't work at 2 MHz 
either.) 

If you are working in a driver, the only other thing you must remem- 
ber to do is disable 6502 interrupts while talking to the clock. (They are 
already disabled when you enter an interrupt handler.) The 6502 inter- 
rupts should always be disabled by PHP and SEI, and later reenabled by 
PLP. This will return the interrupt status to whatever it was before. Per- 
haps the interrupts were already disabled. It is particularly important to 
restore the correct zero page before reenabling interrupts. When inter- 
rupts are acknowledged, control is transferred to SOS. And SOS gets 
very upset if it finds out you've been messing with zero page. 

There are some other problems if you are working in the user envi- 
ronment, such as in an interpreter or an assembly language module. In 
addition to slowing the clock and disabling 6502 interrupts, you must 
also change $COOO..CFFF from RAM to I/O space by setting bit 6 of the 
environment register. And, most important of all, you must avoid all use 
of the stack while monkeying around with zero page. This means using 
no subroutines until zero page has been restored. In user environment 
(and only in user environment) the stack is alternate stack — not the 
normal 6502 stack, which is true page $0100. Alternate stack is zero page 
EOR $01, wherever that happens to be. In practice, the user environ- 
ment is always assigned zero page $1A, so the alternate stack is always 
on $1B . . . except when you've been messing around. If you change zero 
page, you change stack page. So if your access routine involves a JSR, 
well, who knows where the return address will be stored, or what it will 
obliterate. So no JSRs, no PHAs, no stack commands of any kind are 
recommended until zero page has been restored. Also, and for the same 
reason, no SOS calls. SOS even checks all SOS-call requests to be sure 
the caller's zero page is $1A. If there has been any hanky-panky SOS 
crashes the system. 

We hasten to add that it is violently opposed to the spirit of Apple III 
even to disable interrupts in the user environment, let alone all that fancy 
stuff with zero page. Apple reserves a special place in hell for such wick- 
edness. But what is a poor programmer to do?

cuted during boot. It is obviously intended to disable both internal and 
standby interrupts from MM58167, whether you want them disabled or 
not. As it happens, Apple made a little booboo: Someone forgot to 
enable I/O space. When the subroutine is called, $C000..CFFF is RAM. 
So the reset attempt doesn't work and you don't need to worry about 
your alarm interrupt being turned off prematurely. Whatever you have 
set in MM58167's interrupt control registers will remain in action even 
when you reboot, at least until the next version of SOS. 

For all practical purposes this is useful only for standby interrupts. 
The reboot process does disable reception of internal interrupts. So even 
if your clock thinks it's sending internal interrupts, nobody is listening 
. . . until you reenable the VIA. In fact, your MM58167 is probably send- 
ing out interrupts right now. They obviously aren't hurting anybody. 

Apple's little error does introduce a bug into the operating system. 
Instead of writing a zero to the clock's data port, it stores a zero in loca- 
tion $C070 in SOS. Kernel, obliterating that location's rightful contents 
and changing the code (see table 5). We don't know the function of this | 
section of code, but we know it contains a bug. 

The Year Problem. When you access DATES from Basic, or per- ! 
form a get-time SOS call from assembly, SOS reports the year. But there 
is no counter in MM58167 for the year. So where is it kept? Why, in the 
only possible place, the RAM comparison latch, the only RAM in Apple 
III with battery backup. "Aha!" you say, "then how are we supposed to 
set up our alarm-clock comparison time if the comparison latch is all 
cluttered up with the year?" It's a problem. 

We're going to have to share. Apple chose to place the year in the up- ! 
permost two bytes of RAM — that is, in the comparison-latch registers 
intended for matching with day of month and month counters (registers 
$0E and $0F). But the year value is first converted, by some devilishly I 
compact code, into "don't-care" nibbles. So it is still possible to create an 
alarm-clock match in the other registers. You yourself can't use the day 
of month or month registers, but they will always match up because of 
the "don't-care" nibbles. You may still set your alarm for any specific 
time in a twenty-four hour day on any specific day-of-week. 

Normally the end user, that's you, provides SOS with time informa- 
tion in the form of ASCII digits. SOS then translates those ASCII values, 
including the year, into binary coded decimal for storage in MM58167. 
The year, two ASCII digits, becomes one byte, or two nibbles of BCD. 
Finally, before storage, the year is further converted into four "don't- 
care" nibbles. So the year now occupies four nibbles, or two full registers. 

When you are creating "don't-care" nibbles, remember that it is not 
enough just to set the upper two bits of a byte. Since MM58167 handles 
each nibble independently, each nibble must have its two upper bits set. 
The required form is (1 \xx,\\xx). Table 6 shows how SOS encodes the 
year and later recovers it. Were it not for this "don't-care" conversion, 
only one comparison-latch register would have to be sacrificed instead 
of two. 

Apple's method sacrifices any alarms involving a future day-of- 
month or month. But the alarms it does permit are capable of triggering 
an interrupt accurate to one-thousandth of a second. Assuming, of 
course, that you have apparatus hooked up that can use that kind of ac- 
curacy — certainly not your eyeball. Furthermore, in real-time applica- 
tions, you may find it difficult to set the clock or adjust its rate to such 
tolerances. 

It isn't so much that you can't use the upper two registers; obviously 
you can. But no matter what you store in those registers, SOS will over- 
write it with the next Set time SOS call. Each time you boot a Pascal disk, 
such as Utilities, Pascal asks SOS for the year. If SOS cannot return a 
valid year, then Pascal will reset the clock using a year value stored irrthe

file System. Miscinfo on the boot disk. Zap goes your comparison time 
(and your current time as well). We stress, however, that the year prob- 
lem involves only alarm-mode interrupts. Tick interrupts don't use the 
comparison latch and consequently are not affected. 

There is another (perhaps better) way. The year could be placed in 
register $09, which compares tenths and hundredths of seconds. No mat- 
ter what year it is, a match would always occur within a second, when the 
corresponding counters count "past" your stored year. In this case the 
year would be stored as a BCD value. Conversion to "don't-care" nib- 
bles is unnecessary, and only one comparison register need be sacrificed. 
In fact, with a little more code, one of the (BCD) year nibbles could be 
placed in the hundredth-second comparison nibble and the other in the 
thousandth. That would always provide a match within a tenth of a 
second. 

It is quite easy to modify SOS if you really want to use this alterna- 
tive storage method. You will find, however, that day-of-month and 
month interrupts are actually useful only for standby power-down inter- 
rupts. Ordinary internal alarm interrupts, for a variety of reasons, can- 
not remain operational past a reboot. Furthermore, standby interrupts 
require external equipment that you'll probably have to build yourself. 
But if you are truly determined, table 7 shows which bytes of SOS. Kernel 
to change. The revised code is shorter, so it's only a matter of loading 
SOS.Kemel from disk into a suitable buffer using Pascal's Blockread 
procedure. Then substitute some bytes of your own code and a sufficient 
number of no-operation fillers. Finally, use Pascal's Blockwrite proce- 
dure to write the file back onto the disk. 

We confess that it is gratifying to modify something in SOS — sort of a 
swipe at Big Brother, and a taste, however illusory, of mastery over one's 
fate. Apple, of course, will instantly counter by releasing the next version 
of SOS. And there you are, back to square one. 

Getting Apple III to Listen. As we have seen, standby power-down 
interrupts from MM58167 funaion outside Apple III in external relays 
and other equipment attached to pin 4 (PDI) of the color video port. The 
pathway for standby interrupts is quite simple. MM58167's signal ap- 
parently goes directly to the external pin. (If, perchance, it is also con- 
nected to some memory location, we haven't found it.) 

Not so for internal interrupts. These are intended to break into the ac- 
tivities of Apple Ill's cpu and divert the computer (temporarily) to what- 
ever task you have set out in your interrupt handler. Internal interrupts, 
which really are ordinary, everyday interrupts, take a far more tortuous 
path in Apple III. Generating such interrupts in MM58167 is just the be- 
ginning. There are several more steps to accomplish: allocating the sys- 
tem internal resource (SIR); enabling the appropriate VIA control line; 
providing an interrupt handler (assembly code) — it must remain in mem- 
ory; (optional) providing event handlers (assembly code)— they must al-

so remain in memory. 

MM58167 is but one of several sources capable of generating inter- 
rupts. Others include the keyboard, RS-232 port, video sync signal, char- 
acter set downloading mechanism, and each of the slots. Each potential 
source of interrupts is called a system internal resource and is assigned a 
unique SIR number. 

Allocation of SIRs is a general mechanism by which SOS coordi- 
nates all these resources and prevents conflicts between programs over 
ovmership rights. Before using a resource, you are expected to call the 
SOS subroutine AllocSIR, which allocates and reserves use of that re- 
source to your program, assuming it is not already allocated to someone 
else. Most important, if you intend to use interrupts from a resource, 
AllocSIR keeps a record associating that particular interrupt source with 
the appropriate interrupt handler address, which you must supply. 
Otherwise, SOS would not know which interrupt handler to call when an 
interrupt occurred. Naturally, when you are through with a resource you 
are expected to release it by calling DealcSIR. 

Incoming interrupt signals are never passed directly to the 6502. In- 
stead, they all arrive on special control lines belonging either to the D 
and E VIAs or to another specialized I/O helper chip, the ACIA (6551 
asynchronous communications interface adapter). The ACIA owns the 
RS-232 serial port, but everything else seems to be tied to the VIAs. 
Physically, each SIR number is associated with a particular control line 
(wire) on one of these helper chips. Table 8 lists those SIR numbers 
known to us, as well as their associated control lines. 

For the sake of completeness, we should note that Apple documenta- 
tion also mentions certain logical operations that must be shared and are, 
therefore, assigned SIR numbers even though they don't involve inter- 
rupts — presumably for the purpose of preventing squabbles. The docu- 
mentation does not, of course, reveal just what those logical operations 
might be. We have noticed, however, that the character set downloader 
routine in the console driver requests allocation of SIR #$10, which we 
happen to know is not a hardware interrupt line. We suspect this re- 
source consists of exclusive use of the screen holes in video memory. But 
we don't really know. 

MM58167, you will notice is SIR #$03. So before using interrupts 
from MM58167 you should call AllocSIR and request SIR #$03. In the 
same call you must also give SOS the address of your interrupt handler.

See the accompanying driver program for an example of the method. 

Now you own the resource, but your interrupt signal will still stop at 
the VIA. You must next enable the appropriate VIA control line. This is 
done by writing to the VIA interrupt enable register (E-VIAIER is location 
SFFEE). The value to write should have a 1 in bit 7 and a 1 in the bit that 
corresponds to the desired control line (bits 0 to 6 for the lines listed in 
table 8). Thus MM58167 interrupts are enabled (at the VIA level) by 
writing $82 (10(XX)010) to location SFFEE. Before doing so, however, 
you should clear any stray interrupts already present by writing the same 
value to SFFED, the interrupt flag register (E-VIAIFR). 

When you are through with the clock, interrupts must be disabled at 
the VIA in a similar manner by writing $02 ((XXXXX)10) to location SFFEE 
(E-VIAIER). And, of course, you must release SIR #$03 by calling 
DealcSIR. 

Responsibilities of the Interrupt Handler. Your interrupt handler 
must clear two interrupt flags, one in the VIA and the other in 
MM58167. The VIA flag is cleared by writing a 1 in the appropriate bit 
position of the interrupt flag register — in this case, by writing $02 in lo- 
cation $FFED. The interrupt is thereby reset and remains armed. 

Next you should read MM58167's interrupt flag register using the 
devious methods discussed earlier (and don't forget to restore zero page 
to its proper value). The act of reading this register clears and resets the 
interrupt, and the value read will contain a 1 in the bit position corre- 
sponding to the particular clock roll-over that triggered the interrupt 
(table 3). 

Finally you are ready to perform your task. In the accompanying 
driver program this is merely toggling whatever character is in the lower- 
left corner of the screen between normal and inverse. Hopefully you will 
have something more profound in mind. 

One of the most important things your interrupt handler can do is 
queue an event. The accompanying driver includes an example showing 
the necessary details. Event handlers are assembly language routines 
much like interrupt handlers. And, like interrupt handlers, they can be 
embedded right in your driver where they are safe from being overwrit- 
ten by Pascal or by some other blundering interpreter. Alternatively, and 
with appropriate care, your event handler may be kept in some more 
convenient place, such as a Pascal assembly language procedure or a 
Business Basic invokable module. Of course you must arrange to get the 
appropriate three-byte address so that your interrupt handler can pass it 
on to SOS. 

Since interrupt handlers and event handlers are both assembly lan- 
guage routines, you might suppose there would be no point in using one 
to call up the other. But event handlers run in the "user" environment. 
You can issue SOS calls and use extended addressing and all those other 
good things that, in the interrupt handler environment, are strictly 
forbidden. 

There is a price, or a danger, involved. Events, unlike interrupts, 
never interrupt SOS. Events are processed only when the user program, 
such as an interpreter, would otherwise be running. So if Pascal issues a 
SOS call requesting an input byte from the keyboard, SOS wall wait for- 
ever for that input. And no events will be processed until SOS has ob- 
tained its input byte and is ready to return control to Pascal. Meanwhile, 
if you are using tick interrupts at, for example, the rate of one a second, 
your interrupt handler is being called each and every second. And if your 
interrupt handler, in turn, is madly queuing up another event every sec- 
ond, then the event queue is rapidly going to overflow. Its capacity is 
strictly limited. 

You would think that SOS would politely decline a QueEvent re- 
quest if the event queue were full and about to overflow. But no; it just 
barges right ahead, overflows the event queue, crashes the system, and 
writes "System Failure $05" in flaming letters all over your monitor 
screen. Most depressing. Pending a more forgiving version of SOS (don't 
hold your breath), it might be a good idea to work out some sort of 
semaphore system between your interrupt handler and your event han- 
dler. The interrupt handier can then refrain from queuing events until 
those already in queue have been processed. 

Only for Those Who Already Want To Modify the Accompanying 
Driver. In the interest of brevity, there is no provision in the accompa- 
nying driver for merely reading or setting the current time. If you wish to 
include these facilities, you will need to implement DRead, DWrite, 



DOpen, DClose, and possibly status code 2 and control code 2. The lat- 
ter two normally handle the newline mode and character. You should 
also bear in mind the following points: 

1. In DRead and DWrite you should probably return and ex- 
pect ASCII values in the same format used by the Set-time 
SOS call. But you should transfer only the number of bytes re- 
quested by SOS, up to a maximum of eighteen ASCII digits. 
The requested number is on zero page in locations $C4,C5. 
For DRead you should also report the number of bytes read 
in zero-page locations $C8,C9. 

2. The eighteen ASCII digits should be (without spaces): 

19YY MM DD W HH NN SS UUU 

3. Pascal (Read, Readln, and so on) will ask for one byte at a 
time. You should somehow arrange to return successive reg- 
isters up to eighteen ASCII digits, then a carriage return, and 
then start over. 

4. Basic (input #1, and so on) will ask for 255 bytes. Send it 
eighteen ASCII digits and a carriage return. 

5 . Just read or write the appropriate counter registers, remem- 
bering that MM58167 expects BCD values. The only other 
problems you're likely to encounter are manipulating the year 
(see table 6) and computing the day-of-week (see Zeller's Con- 
gruence, a subroutine in the program Timeset on the Business 
Basic disk). 

Sysclock Interrupt Driver Instructions and Information. Once as- 
sembled and placed in SOS.driver, Sysclock Driver can be used from any 
language. Its form is that of a standard character device driver, but it re- 
sponds only to status and control calls. Status and control calls may eas- 
ily be issued from Basic using request.inv invokable module or from Pas- 
cal using Unitstatus procedure. 
Available Status Requests: 

Status code: 3 (returns rate parameter, comparison latch values) 
Status list: rate (one byte — see table 3 for significance of bits) 
MM58I67 registers $08..$0F (eight bytes— see table 2) 
Note: Buffer must be at least nine bytes in length to avoid over- 
writing other data in memory. 
Status code: 5 (returns event parameters) 
Status list (five bytes) 

priority, ID, handler address L, H, Bank 
Available Control Requests: 

Control code: 0 (reset device — disable all MM58167 interrupts) 

Control list: (nil) 
Control code: 3 (Enable/disable internal interrupts.) 

Control list: rate (one byte — see table 3 for significance of bits) 

MM58I67 registers $08..$0F (eight bytes— see table 2) 
Note: Once started at a specific rate, interrupts must be disabled by 
using rate (X) (or by control-code 0) before a new rate can be 
entered. 

Note: If an alarm-mode interrupt is requested (bit 0 of rate is set), 
then new RAM values (eight bytes) are transferred to the 
MM58167 comparison latch. Otherwise these bytes of the 
control list are ignored. Did you preserve the year? (See text.) 
Control code: 4 (Enable/disable standby power-down interrupt.) 
Control list rate (00 = disable; 01 = enable) 

MM58167 registers $08..$0F (eight bytes— see table 2) 
Note: During enable new RAM values (eight bytes) are transferred 
to the MM58167 comparison latch. During disable these bytes 
are ignored. Did you preserve the year? (See text.) 
Control code: 5 (Change event parameters.) 
Control list (five bytes) 

priority, ID, handler address L, H, Bank 
Note: On power-up, event parameters are set to the embedded event 
handler in this driver, and the event is armed. This call allows 
you to substitute the address of another handler. If you set 
priority to zero, events will be disabled. 
Warning: Your event handler must still be in memory whenever it is 
called; otherwise the system will crash. If you cannot 
guarantee that your handler will remain in memory, don't 
use events.

I have an Apple® He? 



Then you need a Neptune board! 
The Neptune extended 80-column 
board from Saturn Systems offers 
64 to 192K of memory, 80-column 
display, PSEUDO-DISK software, 
MOVEDOS, and VC-EXPAND/80. 
With the new version of VisiCalc" 
and a Neptune board, you can get 
220K workspace memory, variable 
column width, fast save/fast load, 
and hard disk support. You can 
even save those large models on 2 
or more floppy disks (each disk 
holds only '128K). 



For BASIC, PASCAL, and CP/M 
programming, you'll love the Nep- 
tune PSEUDO-DISKS. A PSEUDO- 
DISK works just like a real floppy 
disk drive, but is much faster be- 
cause it really consists of RAM on 
the Neptune board. 

The Neptune board costs only 
$249 with 64K, $399 with 128K, or 
$499 with 1 92K. The 64K and 1 28K 
boards can be upgraded to a larger 
memory size. If you have an old, 
non-expandable 64K extended 80- 
column board, you can recycle it. 
Just send your old board directly to 
Saturn Systems for $100 credit 
toward the purchase of a Neptune 
board. 



Also look for the Accelerator He, 
which will be available soon to make 
your Apple lie run 3.6 times faster.

vanced technology and user-friendliness. 

□ ComputerLand (Hayward, CA), the world's 
largest independent network of computer 
stores, has opened its first international "satel-

Everyone's Guide to 
Assembly Language, Part 33 



This month's discussion deals with a new version of our beloved 6502 
microprocessor known as the 65C02. Although the chip has just been re- 
leased within the last few months and has yet to find its way into the 
mainstream of computers, it seems likely that we'll be hearing more 
about this item in the upcoming year. 

Before jumping right into its new functions, though, let's first get a 
little background information out of the way. 

The 6502 was apparently first designed by Commodore Business Ma- 
chines, and, as of the present, 70 percent of its use is by Apple, Atari, and 
Commodore. The current manufacturers of the 6502 are Rockwell Inter- 
national, MOS Technology, and Synertek. As sometimes happens with 
these things, though, some of the key persons involved with the 6502 
went to work at a new company. Western Design Center. This com- 
pany, then, is the original source of the new 65C02 chip. But the story 
doesn't end there. Western Design Center has sold the design to at least 
three independent manufacturers, Rockwell International, GTE, and 
NCR. These companies took the initial 65C02 design, corrected initial 
design errors, and added their own enhancements. 

The picture at this point is that each of these three companies will be 
marketing its own version of the 65C02. The chips are more or less the 
same, but the Rockwell chip has the largest instruction set. 

"Largest instruction set," you ask? Yes! The new 65C02 has had the 
old 6502 instruction set appended with a variety of new instructions. Be- 
cause the Rockwell chip appears to be a superset of all the other chips, 
the bulk of this article will assume that it's the chip that's being used. At 
the end of the article we'll describe differences among the three chips. 

The Rockwell chip has a total of twelve new instructions and two 
new addressing modes. In addition a number of addressing modes not 
previously available to an instruction (such as the immediate mode for 
the BIT instruction) are now available. There are a total of fifty-nine 
actual new op-codes. The meaning of all these numbers will become clear 
shortly. 

New Addressing Modes. Since this is one of the smaller numbers, 
let's start here. You'll recall from many earlier discussions that each 6502 
instruction has up to six addressing modes. That number is arrived at by 
counting some modes as mere variations of others and not including the 
value (relative addressing) associated with branch instructions (BEQ, 
BNE, BCC, BCS, and so on) as an addressing mode here. To refresh 
your memory, a list of modes and variations is provided in table 1 for the 
LDA (load accumulator) instruction. 

Indirect Addressing. The first of the two new addressing modes is

quite easy to explain because it is essentially another variadon of an exist- 
ing mode. The new mode is indirect addressing. This may sound very fa- 
miliar because this is similar to the instructions used to access memory 
locations via a zero-page pointer. Usually, though, the Y register is set 
to zero or some other value, which is then added to the address indi- 
cated by the zero-page pointer to determine the address of interest. 

This is fine for addressing a large table of data, but many times we 
are interested in only one byte of memory, and must then go through the 
obligatory LDY #$00 to properly condition the Y register. (See entries 5 
and 6 in table 1.) 

The new instruction allows us to ignore the contents of the Y register 
and gain access to the memory location directly. This conserves two 
bytes of code for each reference, since the Y register does not have to be 
loaded. If you want to scan a block of memory, such as for a table, this 
instruction can still be used if you are willing to INC or DEC the zero- 
page pointer accordingly. 

This new addressing mode is available for the instructions listed in 
table 2.

Table 1. Addressing modes. 



Indexed Absolute Indirect. The second new addressing mode has a 
name that was obviously not designed with easy recall in mind. For- 
tunately, this too is a variafion on an existing theme and as such should 
be easy to remember. In the past, we had indexed indirect addressing. We 
called this mode preindexed for clarity's sake. Item 5 in table 1 is an ex- 
ample. Preindexing means that the contents of the X register are added 
to the address of the zero-page reference before using the sum of those 
numbers to determine which zero-page pair to use. For example, the in- 
struction LDA ($22,X), where the X register held the value 4, would 
actually use bytes $26,27 to get the final destination address. 

This differs from indirect indexed, which we refer to as postindexing. 
In posdndexing, the value of the Y register is added after the base ad- 
dress is determined. For example, in the instruction LDA ($22),Y, where 
the Y register holds the value 4 and $22,23 point to locadon $1000, the 
memory location accessed would be $1004. 

You'll recall also that pre- and postindexing were limited in their use 
of the X and Y registers. Preindexing could use only the X register and 
posdndexing only the Y. Before you get too excited in andcipadng the 
possibilities of the new instrucdon, restrain yourself: This much has not 
changed. 

What has changed is that preindexing is no longer limited to zero- 
page pointers. The new mode allows any two-byte value to be used. This 



means that the X register can be added to the base address of a table of 
memory pointers that previously could only have been located on the 
zero page of memory.

For example, suppose you had a command interpreter that accepted 
a command value between 0 and 2. With the 6502, such an interpreter 
could be used in conjunction with a J MP table located on page zero, con- 
structed as in the following example: 



J MP DATA TABLE: 
20: 80 10

This is a very fast and effective technique, but for a large set of com- 
mand routines it can chew up valuable zero-page memory very fast. 
Wouldn't it be nice if we could put the table somewhere else? With the 
new addressing mode you can. The table could now be put, for example, 
at $1200, with line 6 modified accordingly. This would free up six bytes 
of valuable zero-page real estate. 

Table 3 shows the instructions that can use this new mode.

Table 3. Instructions with indexed absolute indirect addressing. 

New "Standard" Addressing Modes. There are a few instructions that 
have addressing modes that are new just to them. For example, two of 
the most exciting ones are INC and DEC. 

Previously, any uses of INC and DEC were limited to memory loca- 
tions. In addition (so to speak), using the X and Y raters was the only 
way to maintain a simple loop counter without using a dedicated memo- 
ry location. The surprise here is that INC and DEC will now work on the 
accumulator. This is nice because you can now maintain a counter in the 
accumulator, or even do fudging of flag values as they are being handled 
in the accumulator. 

Some future assemblers may require the "somewhat usual" (if not in- 
convenient) use of DEC A or INC A as they seem to prefer for LSR, 
ASL, and other operations on the accumulator. 

The BIT instruction also allows some additional addressing modes 
that may prove useful. Previously, the BIT instruction supported only 
absolute addressing. That is to say that a directly referenced memory lo- 
cation was used as the value against which the accumulator was op- 
erated on. 

Addressing Mode Common Syntax 

Absolute BIT $1234 

Zero Page BIT $12 

This is useful for testing a memory location for a given bit pattern, 
but not directly suitable for testing the bit pattern of the accumulator. 
For many operations, this means you have to rather artificially load 
some memory location with the value you wanted to compare to the 
accumulator. 

The new 65C02 supports three new addressing modes for the BIT 
instruction: 

1. Immediate BIT #$12 

2. Absolute,X BIT$1234,X 

3. ZeroPage,X BIT$12,X 

At Last, the Real Scoop! Of course, the real question lurking in 
everyone's mind is: "But what are the new instructions?" 

The great thing about the 65C02 is that not only are many of the old 
instructions enhanced, there are a number of absolutely terrific new in- 
structions — twelve, to be exact. 

The new instructions are shown in table 4.

Table 4. New instructions in the 65C02. 



' So what exactly do these instructions do? Well, let's examine some of 
the easy ones first: PHX, PHY, PLX, and PLY. 

Commands for pushing a byte onto the stack and pulling a byte off 
the stack exist for the accumulator but not for the X and Y registers in 
the 6502. One of the more common uses for the stack is to save all the 
registers prior to going into a routine so that everything can be restored 
just prior to exiting. Ordinarily, to save the A, X, and Y registers, we'd 
have to do something like this: 

ENTRY PHA ; SAVE A 

TXA ; PUT X IN A

The problem is complicated even further in programs like the char- 
acter generator listed in the April issue. There we had to refer to the origi- 
nal value of the accumulator several times and this interfered with any 
simple way to push all the register data onto the stack. 

With the new 65C02, this could all be resolved with the following:

BRA (branch always) is one of those instructions that will thrill writ- 
ers of relocatable code. One of the techniques for writing code that is lo- 
cation-independent involves the use of a forced branch instruction, 
such as: 

CLC ; CLEAR CARRY 

BCC LABEL ; ALWAYS 

Unfortunately, this means we must force some flag of the status 
register, which may not be convenient at the time. In addition, the proc- 
ess takes up an extra byte on most occasions. 

Branch always alleviates both these problems by always branching to 
the desired address, subject of course to the usual limitations of plus or 
minus 128 bytes as the maximum branching distance. 

It is worth mentioning, in the interest of programming style, that 
many people indiscriminately use a J MP to go back to the top of a loop 
when a branch instruction would do the trick; this only adds one more 
limitation to the final code in the process. Hopefully, this new branch in- 
struction will encourage people to make their code more location-inde- 
pendent. BRA, like the rest of the branch instructions on the 6502, uses 
only relative addressing. 

STZ (store zero) is used for zeroing out memory bytes without 
changing the contents of any of the registers. 

Many times it is necessary to set a number of internal program regis- 
ters to 0 before proceeding with the routine. This is especially needed in 
mathematical routines such as multiplication and division. 

Ordinarily, this is done by loading the accumulator with 0 and 
then storing that value in the appropriate memory locations. This is easy 
to do when you have to load the A, X, or Y registers with 0 anyway. The 
problem is that on occasion the only reason one of the registers is loaded 
with 0 is because of the need to zero a memory location. 

Store zero allows us to zero out any memory byte without altering 
current register contents. Not all of the addressing modes usually avail- 
able to STA, STX, or STY instructions are available with STZ, though. 
Table 5 shows what modes are available. 

Addressing Mode Common Syntax 

Absolute STZ $1234 

Zero Page STZ $12 

Absolute.X STZ$1234,X 
ZeroPage.X STZ$12,X 
Table 5. STZ addressing modes. 

SMB and RMB (set/reset memory bit) will allow you to set or clear a 
given bit of a byte in memory. Previously, this would have required three 
separate instructions to achieve the same result. For example: 
LDA MEMORY ; LOAD VALUE FROM MEMORY 

AND#$7F ; %0111 1111 IS PATTERN 

; NEEDED TO CLR BIT 7 
STA MEMORY ; PUT IT BACK 



With the new instruction, we can accomplish the same thing with: 
RMB7 MEMORY ; RESET (CLR) BIT 7 OF MEMORY 

or set the bit again with: 

SMB7 MEMORY ; SET BIT 7 OF MEMORY 

Two interesting things to note here. The first is that for some reason 
they use the term reset instead of clear to indicate the zeroing of a 
given bit. 

The second item is that we now have four-character instruction codes 
(mnemonics), the last character being the number of the bit being acted 
on. What problems this may cause in some assemblers remains to be 
seen, but this new species of instruction seems to have arrived. 

These instructions are limited to zero-page addressing only. 

BBS and BBR (branch on bit set/reset) are two new branch instruc- 
tions that make it possible to test any bit of a zero-page location and then 
branch, depending on its condition. This instruction will be very useful 
for testing flags in programs that need to pack flag-type data into as few 
bytes as possible. By transferring I/O device registers to zero page, 
it is also possible to test bits in these registers directly for status-bit 
conditions. 

These instructions are very similar in appearance and use to the bit 
set and reset instructions just discussed. They, too, use four-character 
mnemonics. The difference is, of course, that we are testing bit status, 
rather than changing it. These are three-byte instructions, the first byte 
being the op-code, the second being the byte to test, and the third a rela- 
tive branch value. In assembly, these commands will actually require two 
labels! 

One of the first applications is the testing of whether a number is odd 
or even. Previously, this had to be done with an LSR or ROR instruc- 
tion, followed by a test of the carry flag, such as: 



LDA MEMORY 
LSR 

BCSODD 
BCC EVEN 



; LOAD A WITH VALUE 
; SHIFT BIT 0 INTO CARRY 
; SET IF ODD 
; CLR IF EVEN 



The equivalent can now be done without affecting the carry flag or

the accumulator 

BBRO MEMORY, EVEN ; BRANCH IF BIT 7 = 0 = EVEN 
BBSO MEMORY, ODD ; BRANCH IF BIT 7 = 1 = ODD 

This could be useful also in creating drivers for the new Apple He 
eighty-column extended memory board since this card uses one bank of 
memory or the other for the text screen, depending on whether the screen 
column position is odd or even. 

TSB and TRB (test and set/reset bit) are the most complex of the 
new instructions. These instructions are rather like a combination of the 
BIT and AND/ORA instructions of the 6502. 

The instructions seem primarily designed for controlling I/O devices 
but may have other interesting applications as things develop. 

The action of these two instructions is to use a mask stored in the ac- 
cumulator to condition a memory location. The mask in the accumula- 
tor is unaltered, but the Z flag of the status register is conditioned based 
on the memory contents prior to the operation. 

For example, to set both bits 0 and 7 of a memory location, we could 
use the following set of instructions: 

LDA #$81 ;%1000 0001 = MASK PATTERN 

TSBMEM1 ; SET BITS 0,7 OF MEMORY 

BNE PRSET ; ONE OF THESE WAS 'ON' ALREADY 

BEQ PRCLR ; NEITHER OF THESE WAS 'ON' ALREADY 

This would clear the bits: 



; %1000 0001 = MASK PATTERN 

; CLR BIT0,7OF MEMORY 

; ONE OF THESE WAS 'ON' ALREADY 

; NEITHER OF THESE WAS 'ON' ALREADY 



LDA #$81 
TRBMEM2 
BNE PRSET 
BEQ PRCLR 

These instructions use only absolute and zero-page addressing. 

Other Differences. There are a number of other differences in the 
chips, most notably the power consumption. The power use of the 65C02 
is one-tenth that of the 6502, so the chip runs considerably cooler. The 
lower-power requirement opens new possibilities for portable computers 
and terminals. 

One point of interest is that the old 6502 indirect jump problem has 
been fixed. If you're not aware of it, the 6502 has a well-documented 
problem with indirect jumps that use a pair of bytes that straddle a page 
boundary. 

For example, consider these three instructions: 

Instruction Pointers Wanted Pointers Used 

JMP{$36) $36,37 $36,37 

JMP($380) $380,381 $380,381 

JMP($3FF) $3FF,400 $3FF,300 

Notice that, in the third instance, the pointers used are not those 
anticipated. This is because the high byte of the pointer address is not 
properly incremented by the standard 6502. 

This problem has been fixed on the 65C02. The only possible prob- 
lem here is "clever" protection schemes that use this bug to throw off 
people trying to decode the protection method. Otherwise, this should 
not present any problems to existing software. 

Are there any problems to be anticipated? In theory, no. The new 
65C02 is compatible pin for pin with the old one, and also upwardly 
compatible in terms of software. Software for the Apple, PET, Atari, or 
other 6502-based microcomputers should work without problems with 
the new chip. Are there any exceptions? Unfortunately, yes. 

The first big problem concerns internal microprocessor timing on the 
Apple II and II Plus computers. The Apple II and II Plus do not handle 
the microprocessor clock cycles in the same way the He does. On the sur- 
face, the 65C02 should directly replace the 6502; however, because the 
65C02 is a faster chip, data is not available for as long, and bits can get 
lost. What this means for now is that the 65C02 can be used only on the 
Apple lie and Apple III machines. None of the manufacturers at this 
time produce a chip that works on the Apple II or II Plus. It can be ex- 
pected, though, that revisions will be made in the near future that will al- 
low the 65C02 to be implemented in the older machines. 

There is also a possibility of problems with some existing software. A 
small percentage of software may be using undocumented bugs or "fea- 
tures" of the old 6502 chip, and these might not function as anticipated. 

For example, a reasonable question might be, "Where did all the new 
op-codes come from? After all, wasn't the chip full?" To answer this, con- 
sider how the instructions we use now are structured. The 6502 operates 



by scanning memory and performing specific operations based on the 
values that it finds in each memory location. You would then expect a to- 
tal of 256 possible op-codes. As it happens, all 256 possible values are not 
used. It is this group of unused op-codes that allows for the new instruc- 
tions and also creates the possibility of a small percentage of difficulties 
with existing programs. 

Although rarely documented, the previously "unused" values will 
cause certain things to happen, much the same way that a legal value 
would. For instance, the code $FF on a 6502 is labeled as an altemate 
NOP. This is one of the codes that have been converted to a new func- 
tion in the 65C02, namely BBS7 (branch on bit 7 set). 

There are other unused codes, though, that have combination ef- 
fects, usually of little use, such as loading the accumulator and decre- 
menting a register at the same time. Their main application is similar to 
the indirect jump problem: creating code that cannot be casually inter- 
preted. If these instructions have been used in existing software, prob- 
lems could arise with the 65C02. 

With such difficulties, then, why bother to substitute the new 65C02 
intQ an existing Apple? The answers are varied. 

First of all, the 65C02 is likely to appear in upcoming releases of ex- 
isting computers (in a new release of the He, perhaps?), and as such you 
can experiment now with the newest version of this versatile device. 

Second, there will likely be specific applications where the advan- 
tages of the chip will make it worth supplying with the software, since the 
disadvantages are practically nonexistent for the Apple He and Apple III. 
Code rewritten to take advantage of the new instructions can be expect- 
ed to be 10 to 15 percent smaller and run proportionally faster. In cer- 
tain applications, even greater improvements could be expected. 

At this writing, the Rockwell chip seems to have the largest set of in- 
structions of the three varieties available. The GTE and NCR chips lack 
the bit manipulation instructions but are otherwise identical. 

As to assemblers supporting the instructions, the current version of 
Merlin supports all the new op-codes in both the assembly and Sourceror 
portions of the product. S-C Software is offering a 65C02 cross assem- 
bler to registered owners of the S-C Assembler at a reduced rate. Hay- 
den will be offering an update to ORCA to support the GTE version of 
the chip. Any assembler that supports macro capabilities should be able 
to be used immediately by defining the proper hex codes. 

If readers have any unique problems or questions about the 65C02, 
send them to Softalk; if possible, the answers will be published in a sub- 
sequent issue. 

This installment marks the last in this series. I want to thank the 
many readers of this column over the last several years for their enthusi- 
astic support and valuable suggestions. I have always believed that the hu- 
man element to this industry, and in fact any endeavor, is the truly re- 
warding part. I would also like to thank Softalk for giving me the op- 
portunity to share the excitement of programming with its readers, and 
also thank Brian Britt for his help in researching this month's article. 

For better or worse, though, you're not likely to be completely rid of 
me. There are rumors of other columns and projects, and I look forward 
to being a small part of the Softalk family for some years to come. 



It was nearly three years ago that Roger Wagner's Assembly Lines be- 
gan appearing in Softalk,- the magazine was only one month old. In that 
first year, Wagner's column elicited more mail from Softalk 'j readers than 
any other feature, and properly so: It was the first time assembly language 
had been explained from step one. In fact, in his first column, Wagner didn't 
even introduce a command. 

With this issue, Roger Wagner's Assembly Lines ends. The first year's 
columns plus appendixes and revisions have been available for some time in 
Assembly Lines: The Book. Volume 2, covering the rest of the columns, 
will be released shortly by Softalk Books. 

Roger Wagner will not fade away. He's planning occasional feature ar- 
ticles for Softalk and he's promised to remain available to answer questions 
from Softalk readers. 

Next month, a new assembly language tutorial will begin, back at step 
one. The new column will be written by Jock Root, a frequent guest review- 
er in Softalk and the author of'IInd Grade Chats: A Custom Menu Gen- 
erator" in May. HI

Mind Your 





BY PETER OLIVIERI 




Summer is upon us! What is so rare as a day in June? Right now, 
some of us would contend that inexpensive computer equipment is about 
as rare. Nevertheless, we enjoy our computers almost as much as we do 
good weather. 

This month's column begins with a request. When you have a mo- 
ment, please send along the names of any utility programs you've found 
useful (comments are also welcome). These might include disk cata- 
logers, menu preparers, hi-res screen dumps, archival backup utilities, 
and so forth. If enough information comes in, we may spend a column 
looking at "useful utilities." Thanks in advance. 

He or Not He? Lately, many readers have called or written to ask 
questions about the Apple lie. What new features does the new machine 
offer, they want to know, and should owners of other Apple lis consider 
"upgrading"? Furthermore, they wonder, will the software they now 
own run on the He, and will software being developed for the He run on 
the II Plus? 

Of course, no one but you knows whether or not you should up- 
grade to the new machine, and your answer will likely depend on a vari- 
ety of factors. Do you feel you've "outgrown" your present system? Is 
software out (or coming out) for the He that meets a particular applica- 
tion need you've identified? Is there a market for your present machine? 

A brief description of what is "different" about the new machine 
should help you make a more informed decision. From a user's stand- 
point, the most striking difference between the II and the He is the key- 
board, which has been substantially redesigned. In fact, some of the nice 
features of the Apple III were transported to this new design. Delete, tab, 
up arrow, down arrow, and two special-function keys were added to the 
keyboard, and every key has an automatic-repeat feature that's acti- 
vated when you hold the key down. In addition, no lower-case chip is re- 
quired; uppCT and lower-case characters can be entered from the keyboard, 
and a caps-lock key enables you to type everything in upper case. 

The lie also has more main memory. The machine comes with 64K, 
including a 16K language card. There is also 16K of ROM, in which Ap- 
plesoft Basic, the assemblers, and the system software are kept. You can 
display eighty columns on-screen using one of the many eighty-column 
boards on the market or by means of a special He eighty-column display 
device available from Apple that comes with optional additional memory. 
Also, the machine has fewer chips inside, one less slot, easier maintenance, 
and built-in self-testing procedures. 

More important than the physical differences between the lie and its 
predecessors is the matter of software. Will the software you now use on 
your Apple II work on the He? The answer is, generally yes. But while it 
may be true that most of the software that works on the II will also work 
on the new machine, it's also true that vendors are developing versions of 
their packages that take advantage of the newer machine's enhance- 
ments. Picture, if you will, a fictitious word processing program called 
Author that works just fine on your Apple II Plus. Of course, in order to 
delete a word, you have to press four or five keys, but you're used to this 
and all is going well. Say, however, that the vendor releases a version of 
the program especially for the He. In the new version, deletion of a word 
is accomplished by pressing one of the two new "special-function" keys. 



Which version of the program — and therefore, which machine — will 
tend to become more popular? 

You can expect the He to be the more popular machine eventually, 
for two reasons. The first, of course, is that anyone who buys a new Ap- 
ple II these days automatically gets a He, and the second is the software 
that will become available — software that you won't be able to run on 
the II Plus. Thus, it may not really be a question of whether the pro- 
grams you have now will run on the Apple He but of whether you might 
need or want some of the new software. 

Some folks will argue that now is the time to upgrade. Others will cite 
the fact that there are an estimated seven hundred fifty thousand Apple 
II owners out there who will continue to be the focus of software ven- 
dors' sales efforts. How to decide whether you need or want a He? Well, 
if you own an Apple II Plus and you're satisfied with the ways it's assist- 
ing you in your work, it makes sense to stay put. You may want to up- 
grade someday, but prices will get lower and machines will get better. If 
you've been planning an upgrade anyway, and you feel that now is as 
good a time as any, you may want to get yourself a He (or a Lisa). And if 
you don't yet own an Apple, the He is the one for you. 

One thing is certain — the Apple He will not be "the last machine"; 
next year there'll be another one available. The computer world is con- 
stantly changing. There will always be a "new and better" version; that's 
the American way. But few of us can afford to "keep up with the Jet- 
sons" with respect to the new technology. So, as usual, the best thing you 
can do for yourself is to know your needs! If you do your homework and 
become knowledgeable about the applications that are important to you, 
you won't be disappointed with your machine. You'll still want to up- 
grade one day. But let that upgrade be because your application needs 
have changed or expanded and not simply because there's a new kid on 
the block. 

Beam Me Up, Spook. We are right at the beginning of the Informa- 
tion Age. The automated office, electronic mail, and working out of 
one's home are becoming more common. It's now possible to access 
newspapers, encyclopedias, classified ads, and banking services over the 
telephone. All of these activities involve using a computer and a tele- 
phone; and all are examples of a process known as telecommunication. 

Let's talk a bit about this exciting area. What exactly is telecommu- 
nication, and why might you want to get involved in it? What do you 
need to get started in telecommunications? And what services are 
available? 

The term telecommunications refers to combining the computer with 
high-speed electronic communications. This process is sometimes also 
referred to as data communications or teleprocessing. All three terms 
mean essentially the same thing; that is, you can link one or more com- 
puter systems or a number of terminals or microcomputers together. 
Such "linked systems" are sometimes called networks. The actual com- 
munications may take place via simple telephone lines or through more 
complex networks involving earth satellites. 

The concept of telecommunications is certainly not new. Many large 
organizations have been using such systems for some time now, with 
hundreds of terminals throughout an area connected via telephone lines 



208

to a central computer. Universities usually have similar arrangements, as 
do airline companies and research libraries. It's only recently, however, 
that the general public has begun to acquire f)ersonal computers, which 
have the capability of communicating with a remote computer. Thus, the 
Information Age can now begin to become a reality. 

One way to set things up for telecommunications is to connect your 
personal computer to a device that will facilitate the transmission of data 
over the telephone lines. There are two requirements for this device: It 
must be one that can be connected to the telephone in some way, and it 
must be capable of converting the signals that the computer generates 
into signals that can be sent over the telephone lines. One device that fits 
this description is called a modem. There must be a device of this sort at 
both ends of the communication link. A modem converts a stream of 
digital signals (generated by your personal computer) into a stream of 
wave patterns. These patterns, similar to those produced by the human 
voice, can be "understood" by the "telephone." 

One special type of modem is known as an acoustic coupler, it is 
usually attached to, or built into, the "terminal." The telephone handset 
is then placed into two rubber holders located on the coupler. The newer 
modems have a modular plug-in jack that allows you to unplug your 
telephone and plug in your personal computer to the phone lines. 

It's also possible to install special lines in a communications net- 
work. These lines, which eliminate the need for modems, are for data 
transmission only, not for voice transmission. But because of the ex- 
pense of data-only lines, it's likely that the normal telephone lines will be 
the communications channel in general use. 

Data transmission channels are the "roads" over which data travels. 
When the volume of use is sufficient, it's often more economical to have 
a dedicated, or leased, line that will be used only for transmission of data. 
Many a personal computer owner who has done some teleprocessing 
(and has incurred the wrath of other family members for tying up the 
telephone) can attest to the advantages such a line offers. 

The most commonly used channels are most often described in terms 



of how information can be transmitted through them. When working 
with the software programs that accompany a modem, you are often 
asked to identify this diaracteristic. A channel is half duplex if the line can 
alternately send or receive data. It is fidl duplex if it's possible to use it to 
transmit and receive data simultaneously. 

The speed at which data is transmitted is called the baud rate. In most 
communications systems, a baud is one bit per second. For illustrative 
purposes, think of eight bits as forming a character (a letter or a num- 
ber). Thus, if a system has a data communications speed capacity of 300 
baud, it can transmit about thirty-eight characters per second. 

Baud rates vary from 1 10 baud all the way up to 9600 baud. With the 
introduction of fiber optic channels (which send data at the speed of 
light), it will be possible to send data great distances at enormous speeds. 

Why Get Involved? There is little doubt that in the years ahead com- 
puters will become as common in the home as a telephone. The com- 
puter will still be used in the ways it's being used now, but it will be used 
more often as a device for communicating with remote services. We'll use 
our microcomputers to read the newspaper, read books, send and re- 
ceive mail, look up answers to our children's questions, pay our bills, sell 
used items, manage our stock portfolios, prepare and pay our taxes, look 
for jobs, get medical advice, and for a host of other things. 

Even now, it is possible to use an Apple and a modem to dial up the 
main computer at your job and finish looking up some of the data you 
worked with earlier that day. Perhaps you'll also decide to send a Visi- 
Calc file to the I BM Display Writer (a standalone word processing sys- 
tem) at work. People are doing these things now. 

It's really not a matter of why get involved; rather, it's a question of 
when to. The major drawback to getting involved in telecommunica- 
tions now is that it's fun. Why is that a drawback, you ask? Well, besides 
being charged by the phone company, users of these remote services 
must pay for the time they use the service; many people become so in- 
volved that they lose track of time and money. At the "prime-time" rates 
(in the middle of the day), losing track of time can be very expensive.

Cost-conscious users often set up their machines to dial up the remote 
computer automatically at 3:00 a.m. in order to obtain copies of infor- 
mation at the lower rates. Certainly, the costs will come down as more 
subscribers join these systems. As an example of these costs, some serv- 
ices charge eighteen dollars per hour for prime time and three dollars per 
hour for "wee-hours-of-the-moming" time. This is not the standard; 
rates vary, depending on the types of services offered. 

What Do You Need? First, of course, you need a computer or a ter- 
minal and a device for connecting your computer to the telephone net- 
work. You'll also need some software (known as terminal software) that 
will allow you to maintain some control over the communications 
process. 

Remember, of course, that you need some place to call; that is, you 
must have the telephone number and password for the system you wish 
to connect with. If it's a system at work or at school, you need to find out 
whether they have a "dial-in" capability and then get permission to use 
the system. If it's an information utility you're interested in using, you 
will no doubt have to pay a subscriber fee in order to become a user of 
the service. 

One of the most popular systems for the Apple II is the Hayes Mi- 
cromodem II. It comes with a peripheral card that plugs into one of the 
Apple's slots, a coupler that stays outside of the Apple (and accepts the 
modular plug from your phone), the telephone plugs you'll need to make 
the connection (a trivial procedure, by the way), a user guide, and a disk 
containing software appropriate for its use. Within thirty minutes of 
starting to set up the system, you'll be ready to place your first call. 

The Micromodem offers the ability to select a baud rate of either 10 
baud (ten characters per second) or 30 baud (thirty characters per sec- 
ond) for the software. These rates translate to about 75 and 250 words 
per minute respectively. 

The Hayes terminal program allows you to originate, answer, or ter- 
minate a call; create, receive, send, or list a file; turn on a printer; or 
change any of the system's parameters (such as sending speed). 

The system is extraordinarily easy to use. To call up a remote com- 
puter, you press a letter key and a control key and then type in the tele- 
phone number of the computer you want to make connections with. A 
red light comes on in the coupler device (to tell you that the phone is off 
the hook) and the computer dials the phone. 

(It's important to determine whether the product you're interested in 
will work with your telephone system. For example, the Micromodem 
cannot dial out on a Touch-Tone system; you must dial the number first 
and then connect the modem.) 

When the computer at the other end "answers the phone," it sends a 
signal that the Micromodem recognizes. You're then informed that a 
successful connection has been made. At this point, you can communi- 
cate with the main computer. 

In a similar vein, the Micromodem can answer the phone if another 
computer (or another Apple) is calling you. When the Micromodem an- 
swers the phone, the other user has access to your machine (it's as though 
the person calling you were actually typing at your keyboard). In this 
way, your caller can retrieve data from disk, store data, run programs, 
and so forth. 

A variety of software programs can be used with the Micromodem. 
In fact, Hayes publishes a software directory that lists compatible prod- 
ucts. Among these are software for creating an electronic bulletin board 
among Apples, software for monitoring a game of chess between two op- 
ponents, and software for interfacing with Western Union Services. 

What Services Are Available? There are almost two thousand on- 
line databases in existence today. Not all are appropriate (or available) 
for use by the typical consumer; some are maintained by the govern- 
ment, while others are of such a specialized nature as to make everyday 
use impractical. Let's look now at some databases that are currently pop- 
ular among members of the microcomputer community. 

The Source, owned by Reader's Digest, currently has forty-five data- 
bases available to subscribers. These include the UPI news service and in- 
formation about stocks, bonds, commodities, precious metals, futures, 
and money markets. In addition, subscribers have access to abstracts 
from nearly thirty business journals and can obtain historical data on 
more than three thousand stocks. Members can get airline schedules, lists 



of job openings, and even a job resume service. Home users can enjoy 
catalog shopping and game playing, among other things. 

A $100 fee is charged when you join the Source. You are then 
charged at the rate of $18 per prime-time hour and $5.75 per nonprime 
hour for the amount of time you use on the system. If you wish to store 
data on the system or to transmit data at faster speeds, there's an addi- 
tional charge. 

The Dow Jones News/Retrieval Service is operated by the company 
that publishes the Wall Street Journal. Through the system, members can 
get a daily summary of the Journal and stories from Barron's. Other serv- 
ices provided include current and historical stock quotations and infor- 
mation on publicly held companies. You can also obtain money market 
forecasts and weekly economic updates. Another service you can sub- 
scribe to provides performance analyses for a variety of companies. 

The Dow Jones service charges sixty dollars per hour for prime-time 
use and twelve dollars per hour for nonprime-time use. 

CompuServe is owned by H & R Block. This service provides infor- 
mation about nearly forty thousand stocks and bonds, as well as access 
to Standard and Poor's General Information Service and to the Com- 
modity News Service. CompuServe also covers the Washington Post and 
the Associated Press wire. Users can make extensive use of the electronic 
mail capabibties of the system and often have access to a resident expert 
who will answer questions on a particular topic. The World Book Ency- 
clopedia has recently been added to CompuServe's collection. 

Prime-time charges for CompuServe are $22.50 per hour. The non- 
prime-time rate is $5 per hour. 

Dialog Information Services, owned by Lockheed, is one of the more 
extensive (and expensive) database services around. Through Dialog, 
more than one hundred fifty databases, containing more than fifty mil- 
lion references, are available. These include magazines, books, news- 
papers, journals, economic reports, statistical information, and so forth. 
Because of the wide variety of services provided, charges can range from 
$25 to $100 per hour.

Other On-line Options. Several other services are available to you, 
including the New York Times Information Service, LEXIS (and 
NEXIS), and BRS (Bibliographic Retrieval Service). Before you decide 
to subscribe to a database, call or write to its operators for additional in- 
formation about services and charges. In addition, you might want to 
find out whether a minimum monthly charge is assessed. 

A note to Business User Group members: If you'd like to share your 
experiences using information services or would like to communicate 
electronically with fellow BUGs, drop a note to the magazine; perhaps 
we can get a network going. 

Communicating. Apple III owners can now use their machines to 
communicate with other machines, including other Apple Ills. Access 
III, a new package from Apple Computer, allows your Apple III to emu- 
late Digital Equipment Corporation's most popular terminals, the VT- 
100 and the VT-52. Since the program transforms your Apple III into a 
terminal, you can also hook up to any of the information services current- 
ly available to microcomputer owners. By connecting a modem to your 
Apple's Ill's built-in RS-232 interface you can communicate directly 
with other machines over the telephone (at 1 10, 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, or 
9600 baud). 

This package allows users to upload and download files to and from 
larger computers or other Apple systems. A setup menu in the program 
permits you to define the communication speed you'll be using and the 
other parameters associated with data transmission. 

Once the setup procedure is completed, a main menu presents five 
additional options. For dialing up and communicating with a remote 
computer, there's the termiml mode. Assuming there's a modem con- 
nected to your machine, establishing communication is simply a matter 
of dialing up the number of the other computer. When you're getting in- 
formation from another machine and want to save the transmitted in- 
formation selectively, use the recording mode. To help you organize in- 
coming data into separate files on disk, there's the change the name of the 
recording file option. The transmit a file option allows you to send a file 



to a remote computer. Finally, a help option offers explanations of all the 
Access III commands. 

If you want to try your hand at telecommunications via your Apple 
III, consider acquiring this package. You'll get the Apple Access III pro- 
gram disk (both Pascal and Business Basic versions) and a user guide. 
Don't forget — if you wish to communicate with other machines, you'll 
need additional hardware. 

Of course, Apple Computer is not the only vendor supplying com- 
munications packages for the Apple III. Microcom offers a similar prod- 
uct called Micro /Terminal, a software program that enables your Apple 
III to emulate an intelligent terminal. With it (and a modem) you can 
communicate over telephone lines to other computers. 

This package requires a minimum of 128K, a disk drive (or ProFile 
hard disk), and, of course, a monitor. In addition, it's recommended that 
you have a Hayes Smartmodem. Another modem or acoustic coupler 
can be used, but the auto dial-up and auto answer features of the Mi- 
cro/Terminal work only with the Smartmodem. 

Micro/ Terminal uses an easy-to-follow, menu-driven method of se- 
lecting from among options. From the main menu, you can enter "inter- 
active mode," load terminal options from a file, create or edit disk files, 
use various utility programs, or leave the program. Hitting the escape 
key allows you to stop whatever you're doing and return to the previous 
menu. 

The interactive mode allows on-line control of the communications 
process. Incoming and outgoing commands are displayed on the moni- 
tor. In this mode, you can instruct the Apple III to answer incoming 
calls, dial a particular number, hang up the phone, erase the screen, com- 
municate with the printer, or send files. 

Terminal options are those communications parameters that might 
be specific to a particular machine. It's possible (and appropriate) to save 
each special set of parameters for use each time you communicate with 
the particular machines that require them. It is from this option also that 
you select transmission speed (baud rate), state whether you're com- 
municating in full or half duplex, indicate whether a line feed is needed, 
and set up a variety of special functions. 

In addition, the terminal option allows you to create and save macro 
instructions — a series of commands entered as a continuous string. You 
might, for example, create a macro that dials up an outside computer, 
enters a user identification number, enters a password, and selects a par- 
ticular item from the first main menu shown. At the appropriate time, 
you'd send this string of commands by means of only one or two key- 
strokes. In addition, any of your previously created command options 
can be changed by selecting the change-terminal-options menu item. 

At any time, you can create and edit your own disk files with a 
powerful, easy-to-use editor. The three basic editing capabilities — which 
allow you to insert text, delete text, and move the cursor — are sufficient 
to prepare and edit files. As you'd expect, the cursor is moved with the 
arrow keys. In addition, the leftmost bank of sixteen keys act as a special 
keypad. Holding down the control key and pressing one of these desig- 
nated keys allows you to perform specific tasks; namely, to move for- 
ward and backward by character, word, line, or paragraph; and to de- 
lete by character, word, line, or paragraph. 

The utilities option lets you review file names, rename files, delete 
disk files, redefine your system configuration, and so forth. 

The user guide supplied with the system is well written and easy to 
read. It contains an overview of telecommunications; sections on troub- 
le-shooting, using different system configurations and the ASCII char- 
acter codes; an index; and information about a customer support system. 

Almost Midsummer. If you've taken the time to read the whole of 
this month's column, it must be almost July. So long till then. iJi

The story behind the program. I'm 

Bob Payne, co-creator of Money Street. When I 
bought my Apple last year, I wanted it to do two 
rather simple-minded tasks: balance my checking 
account, and collect financial data in the process. 

From my personal checking account, I wanted to 
keep an informal budget of spending, watch some 
small investments, and collect tax deduction data. If 
nothing else, tax time should be a breeze since I 
could transfer data to my 1040 and Schedule A. 

Better yet, with a good tax preparation program, I 
could calculate my own taxes near the end of the 
tax year. This would allow me to see next year's 
returns this year. Hence, tax planning would be 
based upon actual amounts, not guesstamates. 

In addition to all this, I wanted my computer to help 
make my commercial real estate more profitable. 
You see, I own a small commercial building, so I 
wanted a checkbook program to total income by 
rental unit, track property taxes, and watch 
expenses. All the while, it could collect "cost basis" 
data should I ever sell the building. Since all 
transactions pass through my checkbook, why not 
collect financial data then and there? 

1 was wrong. This seemed like a 
straightfoward application, so I thought it would be 
a cinch to locate such a program. 

But I was wrong. In frustration I tried a slew of 
checkbook programs, even Apple's own balancer. 

What did I get for all this effort and money? A maze 
of complex graphics, a tangle of computer jargon, 
and pages of fouled-up documentation. All 
checkbook programs seemed totally obsessed with 
budgets and home accounting. Worse: they were 
limited to only one checking account, so I would 
need one program for each account and each year! 

I got madi Then I got mad. "What the hell," I 
said, "I can do better than this." So optimistic as 
Candide, I set to work programming, but quickly fell 
flat on my face. I guess at fifty-two years of age, I'm 
simply too old for the torqued-out world of 
computer programming. 



Finally I met Don Hill, an up-and-coming game 
programmer and the creator of Blackjack Vegas 
Style. At twenty-four, Don seemed to have the 
youth and fire for complex programming. Better 
yet, Don comes from a small business family and 
understands what accounting is all about. 

So, we joined forces determined to create a 
checkbook accounting program for small business, 
professional offices, and personal use. 

In the winter of 1982, we set to work to create a 
totally new checkbook accounting system. Our 
objective: make it the silk stocking of them all. 

Snowbound programming. We live in a 
small ski town in Western Nevada. 1982 produced a 
winter like few others. At nearby Donner Pass, for 
example, 60 feet of snow fell. Don and I were 
snowbound much of the time, which gave us plenty 
of programming time. Near the end of January, so 
much snow accumulated on Don's roof his front 
door refused to open without a half dozen hard 
kicks. Rather than venture out, he just kept fine- 
tuning the new program. 

When the snow plows finally got through, I saw the 
new program. It simply knocked my socks off. No 
doubt about it, here's the ultimate checkbook 
program. Don calls it Money Street, and it does 
amazing things with checkbook data. For example, 
it can: 

• Scan an electronic file 2400 checks in 300 
seconds. 

• Sort checks (and deposits) into 100 business, 
personal, or tax categories. 

• List a "history" of 2400 checkbook entries, 
showing the running balance each step of the way. 

• Print monthly (and year-to-date) totals for 
business, office, or home accounting. 

• Display year-to-date totals for 100 categories 
with the press of two keys. 

• Locate a cancelled check in a file of 2400 in one 
minute!

Happy customers. For us, the best thing 
about Money Street is our happy customers. Every 
day we get letters like the one from Jerry Losse of 
New York who wrote: "I'm very pleased. Money 
Street does everything but go to the bank". 

Keller Watson, of California wrote saying, "The 
speed of operation is fantastic, the double cursor is 
a help to tired old eyes, and the data bank totals are 
worth the price of the whole program". 

A.W. Matthews of Colorado wrote to say, "...it is 
truly a relief to purchase software that does as 
advertised". 

Mike O'Bryan, a farmer from Kansas, wrote this: "I 
like Money Street. I like the split check feature. I like 
the command to stop printing". 

All kinds of people use Money Street. A lawyer in 
Orlando, Florida uses it to control his trust account. 
A doctor in New York City uses it to separate 
expenses in his medical partnership. A computer 
store owner in Reno, Nevada uses it to control store 
expenses.

JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES 

Called Jack, this software package 
for the Apple II Includes a word pro- 
cessor, mailing list, a personal-file 
system and calculator routines. All of 
the routines are integrated into one 
package, not as a collection of sepa- 
rate programs. 

The word-processing capability in- 
cludes the creation of formatted re- 
cords with items that require calcula- 
tion being automatically computed 
and included as the document is pre- 
pared. The record-keeping routines 
handle records that range in size from 
the data for a mailing label to one that 
stores text from up to 69 sheets of 
legal-size paper. 

Up to 1000 records, depending on 
individual record size, can be handled 
on one diskette.

NEW SOFTWARE IS JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES 

The Incredible Jack, a four-applications-in-one software 
package for the Apple II computer, has just been introduced by 

f Business Solutions. Jack offers a personal filer, calc package, 
and word processing and mailing label capabilities in one 
package. 
' 'Jack combines the convenience of a pwrsonal filer with the 
power of a calc package, and handles most word-processing 
tasks, providing all of the functions that people usually want 
from a personal computer," says Alan Dziejma, president of 
Business Solutions. "Jack turns your computer into a jack-of- 
all-trades by performing all functions with a simple integrated 
set of commands. Besides being easier to learn, these 
functions can be combined in a single task. ' ' 

Jack's unique features let users create letters and reports 
with embedded calculations, the company says. The word 
processing capability enables the creation of neatly formatted 
records and can include items that are automatically calculated 
as the document is being prepared. 

Needing only a few simple commands, the word-processing 
functions create letters, memos and reports. Jack also inserts, 
deletes and copies text with automatic word wrap and flush 
right margins. 

Users can arrange information in files they design them- 
selves using Jack's personal filer. The records can be as small 
as a mailing label or as large as 60 sheets of legal-size paper 

The calc features let users build decision-making logic into 
their files. With English language calculation rules and pwwer- 
ful IF/THEN/ELSE function, it is possible to perform 
complex calculations instantly. 



NEW SOFTWARE FOR THE APPLE // e 
DOES THE WORK OF THREE PROGRAMS 
FOR THE PRICE OF ONE 

Are you on a budget? Do the functions of file management 
word processing, and calculation pretty much cover what you 
want out of your computer? Do you find that specialized 
programs in these areas often cost too much, take too long to 
learn or to keep current, and do more than you really need? 
Does having to load one program after another into memory as 
you go through the day get you down? Well, there may be one 
program in all computerdom that will make you happy: The 
Incredible Jack, from Business Solutions, Inc., for an Apple . 
//e or Apple II Plus with 64K RAM and two disk drives. <^ 

Our test of Jack showed you could just load it into your 
computer and leave it there all day. Say you start a business 
letter, and halfway through, a client calls with a question. 
Saving your letter on disk, you switch to the file management 
function, get the data you need, switch to the logic function, 
get the calculations you need - give your client one -call 
turnaround on his question - and return to your letter without 
ever leaving your program! 

A relative newcomer to computing became comfortable 
with Jack (working through the manual's tutorial) in an hour, 
with only occasional help. An experienced computer user took 
even less. In five hours you should be flying with Jack, 
regardless of your background, thanks to the 57 diskette-size 
pages of tutorial. The comprehensive 67-page reference sec- 
tion will help you thereafter. The reference section includes a 
troubleshooting guide, calculation templates, index, and more. 

For $129 you get a remarkable program specializing in the 
generalist's needs. Jack lets you adapt the computer to your 
work flow, freely using the various functions as needed... if 
Jack's functions fit your needs, no combination of single- 
function programs will fill those needs at anywhere near Jack's 
price

The Jack of Apples. The appearance of The Incredible Jack from 
Business Solutions among the He specific software is almost a travesty. If 
there were any justice, Business Solutions would be the only company 
making a software announcement. This is the single current program 
that from the conception stages was intended for the lie only. When 
Apple's development time on the new machine became extended, Busi- 
ness Solutions retrofitted it to the II Plus. 

The Incredible Jack draws its name from your ordinary garden-vari- 
ety jack-of-all-trades. That's what this program is: a spreadsheet, a data- 
base, and a word processor in one integrated package. It's the Apple and 
eight-bit answer to MBA and 1-2-3, widely heralded and praised soft- 
ware packages for the IBM pc.

Low-Cost Apple" Jack" of AU Trades 



nAn easy-to-use, very low-cost pack- 
age for the Apple II Plus combines 
simple spreadsheet analysis, fairly advanced 
word processing for reports and memos, a 
versatile mail list manager, and a very good 
personal filing system. Called JACK, this 
program is the only fully integrated package 
available for the Apple II; other new inte- 
grated products work on the IBM PC or larger 
machines. JACK costs $129, very inexpen-

JACK can also serve double duty as a good 
computer literacy package for novices or 



new users who can graduate to more power-

THE SIXTH 
SENSE 

Searching 
For Substance 



BY tIELISSA niLlCU 



The room sits empty, waiting, its silence locked in. In the corridor be- 
yond the door, the sound of distant footsteps gets nearer. 

The scientist guides the next experimental subject into the room. Hit- 
man Subject §325— female, twenty-seven years old, somewhat spacy, no 
prior ESP experience. Then the scientist leaves. 

"Close Outside Door to Hall during All Experiments To Prevent Sen- 
sory Leakage." 

Dr. Charles T. Tart, the scientist, obeys the sign and then takes his 
place in front of a computer in a laboratory across the hall, separated from 
the subject by three closed doors. 

Human Subject §321 sits waiting, wondering why she is in this "rat 
cage" when she'd rather be outside, even though outside is threatening to be 
the wettest winter in northern California in one hundred years. 



The rat cage is actually a Faraday cage, a room within a room, totally 
covered with copper sheeting and resting on rubber tires to absorb shock 
from building vibration. In the sound-attenuating chamber, #321 is shielded 
from the rest of the psychology department. 

She sits down on a hard green ottoman in front of the console — ^e Ten 
Choice Trainer, Generation Three. An Apple computer in a wooden case is 
hooked up to the console — it's not at all like the Apples §321 has seen be- 
fore. A television camera mounted in the Faraday cage points at her and a 
video monitor stares blankly. 

"Experiments Involving Human Subjects at UCD Are Conducted under 
the Aegis of the Campus Htman Subjects Committee, Which Can Be 
Reached through the Office of the Dean." 

That's just wonderful, §321 thinks; the dean is never in his office. 

"You May Stop Participating in This Research at Any Time with No 
Adverse Consequences." 

Ten green bulbs flash on the console. 

"Are you ready, §321?" 



She presses the button at the top of the console to indicate that she is. 
The extrasensory-perception experiment has begun. Seated at his Apple in 
the other room, Tart prompts the computer program to spin out a random- 
ly generated number from one to ten. 

In the Faraday cage, §321 is supposed to pass her hand over the console 
and use her ESP powers to determine the number Tart has generated. In- 
stead, she gets nervous and jabs at a button almost immediately. 

It's not a big deal when the subject gets a wrong answer, but Tart asks 
his subjects not to leave until they get a "hit." He wants them to leave 
the cage on a positive note. Some subjects are truly adept — his ESP 
superstars. 

"You mean, somebody else — somebody who isn't so good — might have 
to stay here all day till they get it right?" 

"Nobody," says Charles Tart, "has ever been here all day." 

ESP and Worlds beyond the Unknown. Dr. Charles T. Tart, pro- 
fessor of psychology at the University of California at Davis campus,

JUNE 1983 S Q r 

dares to investigate areas that many scientists make it a point to avoid: 
altered states of consciousness, parapsychology, out-of-body experi- 
ences, sleep and dreams, the effects of marijuana, and hypnotism. Cur- 
rently Tart is training people to use their ESP more reliably. 

"There's really only a handful of us doing scientific research; it's been 
a great struggle to get solid recognition in this area." 

The microcomputer aids Tart in his efforts to achieve validity for his 
work — helping him separate "the sense from the nonsense." Tart is in his 
office, swiveling in his chair. Nothing paranormal here, just a chair that 
needs oil, but it's like a screaming banshee, especially when Tart spins 
around to emphasize a point. 

Tart believes that providing immediate feedback is the key to a revo- 
lutionary breakthrough in ESP. The greatest problem with investigating 
paranormal experiences is that they only manifest themselves sporadi- 
cally. Premonitions, mind reading, and ESP happen like a bolt of light- 
ning, bright and loud but over in a second, making them very difficult to 
study in a laboratory. 

"You can make a good case that there is such a thing as ESP," Tart 
says, "but if you want to discover its nature, what it teaches about peo- 
ple and the universe, it's very hard to do when it comes only in sporadic, 
intermittent signals." 

The Elusive Breakthrough. Tart compares our current understand- 
ing of parapsychology to the nebulous grasp most of pre-Industrial Age 
mankind had of the phenomenon of electricity. When the battery was in- 
vented and electricity could be contained and used for experimentation, 
scientists realized a major breakthrough. 

Today, Tart seeks the elusive "parapsychological battery," an ab- 
stract concept meant to convey a mechanism or ability by which people 
can call on their ESP reliably for experimentation and application. 

"If you can get immediate feedback on whether you're right or 
wrong," Tart says, "you can try a variety of strategies and note how they 
work. Eventually, you'll also build up a catalog of strategies that never 
work, and so can be dropped. Other strategies will have some promise 
and need to be developed." 

He points at a bicycle blocking a path in the middle of his office. 
"Now if I told you to move that bicycle, you'd know what to do. We 
could use all our learned skills to move that bicycle. But if I told you, 
'I'm thinking of a number in my mind,' and I asked you to tell me what it 
is by using telepathy, your first reaction would be, 'Huh?' 

"You don't know!" says Tart. "We don't teach people to do that. It's 
not like performing a variation on something we already know well." He 
looks at the bicycle as if for affirmation. "You don't know what to do." 

A Mad Scientist Is Born. Tart earned a degree in electrical engineer- 
ing at MIT and worked as a radio engineer for commercial broadcasting 
stations during the late fifties. He subsequently enrolled at the Univer- 
sity of North Carolina and by 1963 had earned a doctorate in psychol- 
ogy. As a graduate student he spent a summer doing research at a four- 
teen-room house on the rugged seashore of Maine. Overrun with slight- 
ly mad scientists conducting every strange test imaginable, the strange 
house was like a scene straight out of a Ray Bradbury story. 

Today Tart is one of the top parapsychologists in the United States, 
and among a small group at the top of the field in the western world. He 
publishes scientific papers and articles frequently and has written several 
books, including Altered States of Consciousness: A Book of Readings; 
On Being Stoned A Psychological Study of Marijuana Intoxication; 
Transpersonal Psychologies, Psi: Scientific Studies of the Psychic Realm; 
and Learning To Use Extrasensory Perception. 

The psychic world is full of characters, some nasty, who use people's 
belief in psychic phenomena to spirit all their money away or exploit the 
innocent in other ways. Thousands of people claim they are psychic, says 
Tart. A few are definitely talented and a few are definitely charlatans. 
Most are just nice people who probably have no real psychic 
powers at all. 

"Some of the nicer people honestly believe they're doing parapsy- 
chology, but what they're doing is not science. So while I like some of 
these people, I wish they wouldn't call what they're doing science." 

Parapsychological Apple. Dana Redington was a graduate student 
in the psychology department at UCD during the mid-seventies. He had 
gone to Holmstead High School in nearby San Jose with a guy named 
Steve, who later put together a computer in his friend's garage. When 



I A I 1^ # 219 

Tart mentioned to Redington that he was looking for something that 
would make his ESP setup more flexible, Redington told him about Woz 
(another mad scientist) and his wonderful invention. 

All computer purchases made with University of California funds 
had to be approved by the data-processing department; personnel there 
thought a computer was supposed to take up an entire basement. Red- 
ington did all the legwork necessary to get the purchase approved. When 
every form had been filled out in quadruplicate, the data-processing de- 
partment somewhat hesitantly signed the permission slip. 

Research funds were low; fortunately, Redington managed to get the 
price of the Apple knocked down a little by buying the computer with- 
out the case. A wooden case, varnished in rich brown tones, was built to 
house the motherboard. Tart fondly christened it the Wooden Apple. 
The result is a little crude and a little elegant at the same time, definitely a 
collector's item. Tart still uses it daily. 

With two Apples and a Pascal program that took psychology grad- 
uate student Ron Goldthwaite four months to complete. Tart performs 
tests designed to discover three different kinds of extrasensory percep- 
tion: telepathy (communication by scientifically unknown or inexplica- 
ble means), clairvoyance (power to perceive beyond the range of human 
senses), and precognition (knowledge of events before they occur). 

In a telepathy experiment, for example, the "sender" sits in front of 
an Apple computer in the first lab and waits for the very clinical-looking 
sign "Acoustical Path Suppression Baffler" to flash green. (Translated, it 
means simply that all the doors that should be shut are shut.) 

There is an intercom linking the sender and the receiver that is auto- 
matically shut off by the Apple when a trial begins. The monitor inside 
the receiver's Faraday cage is used to inform the test subject that the trial 
is about to begin. The tester sends a brief message through the Apple, 
such as "The trial has begun; use your ESP now!" 

When experimental conditions are just right, the sender starts the 
program. The master Apple randomly generates a number from one to 
ten, which appears on the sender's computer screen. 

The receiver sits inside the Faraday cage, with the Wooden Apple 
hooked to a graphics tablet. The graphics tablet has an overlay that con- 
sists of ten switches arranged in a circle, each with a tiny green light bulb 
adjacent to it. The switches correspond to the numbers one through ten. 

Graphically ESPing. The receiver holds the stylus of the graphics 
tablet and passes the hand holding the stylus slowly around the circular 
path of bulbs and switches until a decision — conscious or uncon- 
scious — is made. The test subject then flicks the chosen switch. 

A television camera in the Faraday cage sends the receiver's every 
move to a monitor watched by the sender. When the stylus comes in 
range of the correct switch, the sender may concentrate hard, attempting 
to broadcast hints telepathically. 

Some receivers report definite physical sensations they can't explain. 
Apparent temperature changes are common. "My hand passed through 
fire; my hand passed through ice," one woman claimed. This may have 
occurred because the sender was thinking, "You're getting warm, warm- 
er; now you're getting cold." What is telepathy? The elusive sixth sense? 

The graphics tablet and the Apple keep a statistical record of the 
hand activity, measuring where the hand goes and how long it lingers in a 
certain spot. For instance, sometimes the test subject's hand may hover 
next to the correct switch for a long while and then abruptly move to the 
opposite side of the board and hit a wrong switch. Maybe this means 
that some part of the subject knew the correct answer. Careful statistical 
analysis of the behavior might reveal a significant pattern. 

Tart's setup gives his subjects immediate feedback. A correct hit rings 
a nice electronic chime and prompts a graphic cartoonlike display. Tart, 
whose talents include programming in Applesoft, created the display. 

Testing subjects for clairvoyance and precognition is accomplished 
with the same equipment used in testing for telepathy. In the case of the 
former, there is no sender. The test subject is trying to discover some- 
thing that exists but is unknown to both the subject and the person ad- 
ministering the test. The Apple randomly generates a number but keeps 
it a secret until the trial is over. It is up to individual test subjects to as- 
certain the correct choice entirely on their own. 

In a similar fashion, testing for precognition requires the subject to 
predict an event before it takes place. Tart will tell the test subject, "The 
Apple is going to randomly generate a number in one minute. Tell me 



what that number is now." 

Immediate feedback, Tart emphasizes over and over, is the key to 
learning to use a steady, reliable method of ESP. "The vast majority of 
past ESP tests, done without immediate feedback, may have actually 
been extinguishing the very ability they were trying to test," explains 
Tart. "One of the most pervasive findings in ESP research was the so- 
called 'decline effect,' a regular drop-off in scores as initially talented peo- 
ple were tested and tested and tested." 

To Have and Have Not. Of course, not everybody wants to have ESP. 
Tart, past president of the Parapsychological Association, put the pos- 
sibility in an extreme form not long ago when he spoke to a group of 
parapsychologists attending a workshop: "Let's imagine there's been a 
new drug invented, a pill that will give you complete ESP right now. 
You'll be able to read the minds and know the feelings of everyone with- 
in a hundred yards of you. Who wants to take this pill?" 

Not one of the parapsychologists in the group raised a hand to vol- 
unteer, and Tart didn't blame them. 

"Have you ever had a day when you could hardly stand your own 
mind? I've certainly had days like that," Tart admits. "And I've walked 
past people on the street and with my ordinary sensory perception real- 
ized I didn't want to know anything about what they were really like and 
what was going on inside. 

"We really do have strong reservations about what it would be like to 
have complete ESP. Unlimited access to other minds would probably be 
a real curse." 

An incident that took place a few years ago in his lab still bothers 
Tart. It concerned a young student who used to come in periodically to 
be tested on the Ten Choice Trainer. Consistently she'd get 50 percent 
right. Ten percent correct is chance; a few people get 12 percent. By any 
statistical consideration, 50 percent is a tremendous score. 

And she got frightened. One time she came in, wowed everybody 
with another high score, and cried for an hour. She didn't come back af- 
ter that. 

Too Hot To Handle. According to Tart, the young woman de- 
veloped her ESP at a faster rate than her conscious mind was ready to 
handle. She was not ready, he says, to face the "full implications" of hav- 
ing really strong ESP. It is an extreme case, but Tart can recall many 
other cases where people contacted him because they'd had an ESP ex- 
perience. They'd call or write him pleading, "How can I stop this?" — 
not, "How can I develop this?" 

Then there are people who simply want to know what happened. 
Their minds seemed to leave their bodies, they floated through space, 
they saw the future, or their dreams came true. They had an unusual ex- 
perience and want to know why. 

Tart's lab setup is aimed at promoting a gradual development of 
ESP, not a sudden breakthrough that could be more risky than useful. 

"One of the points in this feedback is that people can go at their own 
speed, improving at their own pace and learning in a specific kind of lab- 
oratory situation. I think their own unconscious minds work with them 
as to how much permission they'll need to be able to call on ESP more 
often, eventually taking it outside the lab." 

Imagine, suggests Tart, if the parapsychological battery were here 
now. The practical applications he proposes run the gamut from medi- 
cal diagnosis to intelligence gathering and a life-saving disaster warning 
system. In fact, any kind of decision making that must be done when all 
the facts are not available or when their interpretation leans toward the 
hazy could be greatly aided by adding Psi information. 

One of Tart's colleagues, parapsychologist Douglas Dean, has shown 
that top-level executives who have doubled their corporations' net 
worths show more ESP ability than executives who haven't done as well. 
These more successful executives occasionally and unknowingly use 
ESP, calling it "hunches" or "business sense," notes Dean. 

Tart is giving a major lecture this summer at a meeting of the Amer- 
ican Psychological Association. His paper discusses the values that have 
crept into the orthodox scientific views of man — assumptions that we 
don't survive death, that the mind is nothing but electrical impulses. 

We Are Not Alone? "If that is the case," says Tart, "what do I care if 
you're suffering when my mind is really locked in my skull and yours is 
locked in your skull? There's no direct contact between us — it's all 
mediated by sensory means. And I can get rid of your suffering very eas- 



ily, can't I? I can turn around and not look. 

"The very existence of something like telepathy — direct mind-to- 
mind contact, even though it's only sporadic now — demonstrates that 
the idea that we are one may be illustrating a fact, not a moral injunc- 
tion or a philosophy. 

"The implications are that we may have direct connections with each 
other. Of course, if that's true, then there's a very real and fundamental 
way in which I care about other people. If you're suffering, there's a real 
sense in which I'm diminished — not just some abstract sense of it." 

If our minds can occasionally operate in some way that seems to 
transcend the ordinary limits of physics, then the very idea of surviving 
death is not so preposterous. Tart says. He believes that these are un- 
knowns worth looking into even though the laws of physics say they're 
impossible. 

"My main job in this worid is to try to bridge the gap, the cultural con- 
flict between the scientific world and traditional religious ideas and 
values," says Tart. "Religions use miracles to prove their validation. 
Miracles are occurrences that have formed the basis for religious experi- 
ence, and miracles, visions, and so on sound like parapsychology to me." 

There have been times, though, when Tart has lost faith and enter- 
tained thoughts of doing something more conventional to get some fund- 
ing. "If I went to Washington, D.C., to try to get a research grant to 
screen a hundred thousand people for ESP ability, I'd be laughed out of 
town." 

Tart calls the amount of money spait on scientific research into ESP 
in this country "absolutely trivial." All the money spent in para- 
psychology research labs in America added together amounts to less 
than six hundred thousand dollars a year, he says. If the amount of 
money spent in parapsychology research labs in Western Europe were 
added to that figure, it would be maybe another hundred to hundred fifty 
thousand. 

With more research funds. Tart would be able to expand his lab and 
purchase more Apples so students could come in and test themselves on 
their own. 

"If my theory — that you can train people by immediate feedback ex- 
periments to develop their own ESP ability — is correct," says Tart, "then 
this is going to be easy to implement on microcomputers. I have a vision 
of computer freaks picking up on a 'Train Your ESP' type of program 
and trying it." 

Psychic Society. To some people, guessing numbers or patterns gen- 
erated by computers may sound boring. But an Apple backing you up 
with graphics and sounds, says Tart, will help keep things interesting and 
put you a big step ahead. "Just as we found young computer geniuses, 
we're going to find some ESP geniuses working on their micro- 
computers. 

"I think everybody has ESP to some extent; it's probably just like any 
other talent. And if we can suddenly get ourselves a handful of real 
geniuses, we can make real progress. 

"Everything can be used for good or evil; it's up to us how we use it. 
If people in this country started implementing this program on their own 
computers, they'd screen themselves. And, if they really b^an to practice 
ESP, a cultural revolution would take place." 

Human Subject #321 presses the ready button to begin Trial Two. She 
can see herself shriveling up into an old lady as the years go on, never mak- 
ing a hit. As she thinks, her hand passes absent-mindedly around the con- 
sole, next to each of the light bulbs. 

The random generator has chosen seven. Dr. Charles Tart, three doors 
away, thinks seven. 

#321 's hand passes slowly around the console. She feels a slight pidl, 
then a violent tug. I don't want to be here, she thinks. I don't want to do this. 
What if I get it right? 

Her hand, her entire arm, is pulled by some unseen force to number 
seven. Pick any number but seven, her reason shouts. But the force is too 
strong. She has already picked seven. 

"Hooray!" Tart rushes through the three doors and into the Faraday 
cage. The eerie atmosphere dissipates a little when §321 sees his boyish 
enthusiasm.

Can Y)u Read 
Y)iir Apple's 



Dr. Charles Tart hopes programmers who take a look at his flow 
chart to convert the Apple into an ESP machine will say, "That's not 
very sophisticated. I can do something better." 

"Good!" says Tart. "If somebody writes a wonderful program, I'd 
like to see it, and I might be able to incorporate it into my research." 

Not everyone. Tart warns, will get significant results using a pro- 
gram of this kind. But if you have a little ESP to begin with, he believes, a 
program like this one may serve as a training device to increase it, and 
you may begin to get your ESP under conscious control. 

Although at this stage of our knowledge getting ESP to manifest it- 
self is more an art than a science, Tart offers some advice and suggests a 
few factors that can aid or inhibit ESP: 

1 . Test yourself when you're relaxed and in a good mood. Bad 
moods have been known to lead to scores significantly below 
chance expectation. If it doesn't seem to be your day, give it 
up and try again when you feel better. 
Don't test yourself too much at once unless you feel particu- 
larly "hot." Don't do too many runs in a single session. A run 
length of twenty-five trials, with about a minute's break be- 
tween runs, is usually plenty. And it's better not to program it 
for more than a maximum of ten choices. When you're deal- 
ing with more than ten possibilities, you'll rarely make the 
correct choice, even by chance. 

Try sticking with the first impression that comes to mind. Sec- 
ond-guessing and logical analysis often get poor results. Be in- 
tuitive. Try a variety of strategies. Be serious — but even more, 
be playful. Keep it as much of a game as possible. 
Be prepared to see a lot of variation in your scores. There will 
be days when you do exceptionally well, and other days when 
your results will be poor. Such variation is normal. Don't get 
discouraged if you don't get spectacular scores. Relatively 
small deviations above what would happen by chance that 
continue for large numbers of trials are significant. Some of 
the best subjects in the history of the field are people who 
scored only 1 or 2 percent more than chance expectation but 
were able to do it over and over again. 
Get your friends involved and get some gamelike competi- 
tion going. Keep records of how you do. Before you begin, 
make a note of your mood and other factors; then you'll be 
able to consider how these might afiect your ESP perform- 
ance. 

Finally, don't hesitate to ignore all these suggestions if you 
find some other way that works for you! 
You might want to keep records of all your results. If you find your- 
self steadily improving. Professor Tart would like to hear from you. You 
can reach him at the Psychology Department of the University of Cali- 
fornia at Davis. 

The Program. You don't really need psychic ability to read Dr. 
Tart's flow chart, but it helps. You definitely need programming ability.

Table of Significance. The values in the body of the table are the num- 
ber of hits you must reach or exceed for your ESP results to be stat- 
istically significant at a probability of .05 or less. For example, if you 
had completed sixty trials with a five-choice test procedure, getting 
eighteen or more hits would occur by chance less than 5 in 100 times 
and would suggest that ESP was operating. 

In the interest of readers who don't know a rem from agosub, and never 
hope to meet one, David Durkee produced an Applesoft version of the 
flow chart, with the good doctor's help. 

Parapsychology is an individual-centered science, and different peo- 
ple find they get different kinds of results under different conditions. For 
that reason, we left a few options in this program up to the user. 

First of all, you can set the number of trials to be run to a number be- 
tween five and thirty. Both ends of the scale are determined by the re- 
quirements that the science of statistics places on determining what re- 
sults are significant and what are not. Fewer than five trials just isn't 
meaningful. More than thirty-three will cause an overflow error. 

The second option is the number of choices offered on each trial. The 



1 



limits on this are two and ten, as suggested by Dr. Tart. 

The other options have to do with the types of feedback available to 
the user. You can choose any combination of the three or none. Aural 
feedback is noise: a buzz accompanies a wrong answer and a bell sounds 
for a right one. Top-line feedback is a running total of the results kept at 
the top of the screen. Flashing feedback means two things: After you 
guess, the correct square flashes, and if you got the right answer, it flash- 
es the message "Right!!!" on your screen. 

The program allows you to use either a paddle or a joystick for guess 
input. If you don't have a game controller, you'll have to replace the in- 
put routine in lines 590 through 660 with this one: 



590 REM INPUT ROUTINE 

600 VTAB 15:N = INT (NC / 2) 

605 HTAB 1: CALL - 868: HTAB 1 + FN H(N): PRINT "A";

630 GOTO 610 

635 IF N < 1 THEN N = NC 

640 IF N > NC THEN N = 1 

645 GOTO 605 



This routine lets you move a blinking pointer with the arrow keys and ac- 
cept the number pointed to by pressing the return key.

Tools of the Craft, Part 24 

A man of letters once said, "Be careful what you wish for; you might 
get it." This cautionary remark is an especially appropriate warning to 
those who would program a computer, as nothing rivals the computer's 
capacity for blind, uncritical obedience. Tell your Apple to overwrite all 
of its memory with meaningless garbage, and it will, in the blink of an 
eye. Tell it to erase a valuable disk, and in scant seconds the job will be 
done. If you're like most people, of course, you'd never knowingly com- 
mand your machine to commit electronic suicide. Unfortunately, it's 
easy to do by mistake. Certain common bugs can transform a mild- 
mannered, unassuming program into a wantonly destructive renegade. 

One of the jobs of the Apple Pascal operating system is to protect 
your computer from attack by renegade programs. Toward this end, sev- 
eral defense mechanisms are scattered among the major components of 
Apple Pascal. This month, as we conclude our initial investigation of 
compiler directives, we'll look at the compiler's contribution to the con- 
tinued health of your Apple. 

String Parameter Checking: The V Instruction. Many months ago, 
we discussed the wisdom of the Pascal rule that requires you to assign a 
specific data type to each variable you use. By stating up-front how you 
expect to use a variable, you can enlist the compiler's aid in preventing its 
misuse. For instance, the compiler will not allow your program to assign a 
Real value to an Integer variable. This is quite fortunate, as the space in 
RAM that corresponds to an Integer variable is only half as large as that 
necessary to hold a Real value! In short, ctata typing helps the compiler 
prevent a program from putting data where it doesn't belong. 

In the earliest version of Apple Pascal (1.0), String variables were not 
always subject to Pascal's "strong typing," especially when passed to pro- 
cedures and functions as VAR parameters. This situation often led to 
subtle problems, as illustrated by the following program: 

PROGRAM 
VarString; 
CONST 

Empty= "; 
VAR 

OneCharString 

:String[1]; 
PoorDevil 
:String; 
PROCEDURE 

GetName(VAR S: String); 
BEGIN 

Write(Output, 'Please type your name: '); 
ReadLn(lnput, S); 
END; 

BEGIN (* VarString *) 

OneCharString := Empty; 
PoorDevil : = Empty; 

WriteLn('OneClnarString= '.OneCharString); 
WriteLn('PoorDevil= '.PoorDevil); 
GetName(OneCharString); 
WriteLn{'OneCharString= '.OneCharString); 



WriteLn('PoorDevil = 
END (* VarString *). 



'.PoorDevil); 



OneCharString is physically very small — it contains room for only 
one character, while a regular String (such as PoorDevil) can accom- 
modate as many as eighty. Stated another way, a r^ular String can con- 
tain any value that will fit into OneCharString, but OneCharString can 
contain only a small fraction of the values suitable for regular String 
variables. 

Because GetName's VAR parameter S is declared as being a regular 
String, GetName's code is compiled under the assumption that the ob- 
ject represented by S can hold up to eighty characters. However, the 1.0 
Pascal compiler did not guarantee the validity of this assumption. In- 
stead, it permitted any String variable to serve as a VAR String param- 
eter, regardless of its maximum physical length. Thus, under Pascal 1.0, 
the call to GetName in the program VarString is quite l^al. It is also 
dangerous, as you can see by examining the following transcription of a 
session with the program: 

OneCharString = 
PoorDevil = 

Please type your name: j merritt 

OneCharString= j merritt 

PoorDevil= merritt(ile. C(omp. L(ink, X(ecu 

This is a classic example of the right hand (the main program) not 
knowing what the left hand (GetName) is doing. By declaring S as a 
(regular) String in GetName, we imply that S will always refer to an area 
of memory that can hold up to eighty characters. Due to a lax attitude on 
the part of the 1.0 compiler, however, we could associate S with a much 
smaller region of memory. To understand how harmful this practice can 
be, let's consider an analogous situation from everyday experience. 

A new trend has emerged in the design of soft-drink vending ma- 
chines that dispense by the cupful. Have you noticed? The customer must 
grab a cup from a stack that is mounted on or near the machine, then 
place it under the soft-drink spigot. The presence of a cup under the 
spigot interrupts a beam of light, which causes the machine to squirt a 
precisely measured amount of liquid into the cup. Customers who wish 
to do so may reuse the same cup or may even employ their own personal 
cups. Those cups provided by the customer, however, should hold at 
least as much as the paper cup that is available from the vending ma- 
chine, since the machine expects to dispense a certain amount of liquid. If 
you place too small a cup under the spigot, much of the drink will spill 
over the rim of the cup and down the drain. 

When you specify a String variable in a call to GetName, you are, in 
effect, putting your own personal "cup" under GetName's "spigot." The 
routine will proceed to fill your "cup" with any String value it receives 
from the terminal. However, the fixed size of the "cup" expected by Get- 
Name is determined by the declaration of S. OneCharString is much 
smaller than S is supposed to be. Consequently, some of the input String 
"spills over" into the memory adjacent to OneCharString. The figure il- 
lustrates this "overflow" process by depicting the regions in RAM mem-

ory assigned to OneCharString and PoorDevil before and after the sam- 
ple call to GetName. 

Note that after the procedure call OneChaiString masquerades as a 
nine-character String, j merritt, despite its declared maximum length of 
one. This is possible because GetName has f)ermitted OneCharString's 
Length-byte to acquire the value of nine. 

Most system routines that access or otherwise manipulate Strings, 
including Write and WriteLn, are ignorant of any String's maximum 
length. Instead, they perform according to the dynamic length stored in 
the String's length-byte. This is why WriteLn sends nine characters to the 
screen when called upon to display OneCharString, even though eight of 
the characters lie in the region of memory reserved for PoorDevil. 

And what of PoorDevil? Because a blank character — Chr(32) — has 
overwritten that String's previous length-byte, the Pascal system is fooled 



into believing that PoorDevil's dynamic length is 32! WriteLn therefore 
displays the first 32 characters that follow PoorDevil's length-byte. These 
happen to include the last portion of the String acquired by GetName, as 
well as some "garbage" characters that, in this example, were left in 
memory by the operating system's command-line processor. 

The program VarString clearly exhibits renegade behavior under 
Apple Pascal 1.0 but will not compile at all under Apple Pascal 1.1, be- 
cause laxity in String type checking was eliminated with the 1.1 release of 
the system. Under normal circumstances, the compiler would now en- 
sure that the maximum lengths of all actual String parameters are greater 
than or equal to those implied by corresponding VAR parameter 
declarations. 

You can force the latest compiler to ignore the maximum lengths of 
formal and actual String VAR parameters, and thus to relax strong type-

Let yowur Apple teach you to program in BASIC! 



BASIC TUTOR makes learning BASIC easy. With it 
your Apple will give you step-by-step Instruction in 
handling all the fundamental elements of the BASIC 
language. 

BASIC TUTOR begins in lesson one by assuming you 
have no knowledge of programming. By the end of the 
last lesson you will be writing carefully planned, well- 
constructed programs of your own. 

BASIC TUTOR is interactive, prompting you with 
questions to which you will respond at the keyboard. 
Positive reinforcement is given with each correct 
answer, and specific aid is provided with each incorrect 
answer to help lead you in the right direction. Also, 
frequent summaries and reviews help make your new 
knowledge stick. 

BASIC TUTOR was designed for self-instruction. You 
can work at your own pace to optimize your learning 
curve. And BASIC TUTOR is fully compatible with 
Applesoft BASIC, so that any original programs you 
write will immediately run on your Apple computer. 



BASIC TUTOR was written for SuperSoft by 
Courseware Applications, one of the pioneers in 
Computer Aided Instruction. Courseware Applications 
has had extensive experience in all areas of C.A.I. , 
including corporate training programs, educational 
instruction (including programs for the international 
PLATO network), and military simulation courses. This 
experience has helped make BASIC TUTOR 
Computer Aided Instruction at its best. 

With BASIC TUTOR you can turn your Apple into the 
greatest teacher you've ever had. So start learning 
BASIC today - with BASIC TUTOR.

checking for Strings, by issuing a compiler directive that contains the in- 
struction V—, as in (*$V— *). Try putting this directive before the 
keyword PROGRAM in VarString. The 1.1 compiler should now accept 
this program, and the object code produced should exhibit renegade be- 
havior, as discussed previously. To reinstate strong type-checking for 
Strings, you may use V-I-, as in (*$V-f*). 

Protective Code, Pascal's "Guard Dog." Some errors in pro- 
gramming cannot be detected by the compiler and only become appar- 
ent during program execution. These logical errors involve the unfor- 
tunate combination of otherwise legal Pascal statements. For instance, 
suppose that you declare the following subrange variable: 

Byte: 0 .. 255; 

Now, consider the two pairs of assignment statements below: 

Byte : = 1 ; 
Byte := Byte + 1; 
Byte := 255; 
Byte : = Byte + 1 ; 

All four statements are fine examples of Pascal syntax; the compiler 
cannot fault them for reasons of grammar. The second pair of state- 
ments, however, engenders a crisis situation. By the time the fourth state- 
ment is executed, the expression "Byte -I- 1" represents the value 256. 
Nevertheless, Byte's declaration prohibits that variable from containing 
any values greater than 255 (or less than 0). Clearly, the programmer is at 
fault for this unfortunate state of affairs; a programming error has defi- 
nitely been made. Yet, the compiler cannot detect this kind of mistake 
without first anticipating how the program will behave during execu- 
tion. Since it is not generally possible for a compiler to do this, logical 
errors such as the one just described must remain undetected during 
compilation. Fortunately, although the compiler cannot itself detect logi- 
cal errors, it can force the object program to recognize and respond to 
them at execution time. It accomplishes this by routinely "spiking" com- 
piled programs with special p-code sequences. This extra, protective code 
is designed to terminate program execution and to invoke the operating 
system's error-reporting mechanism whenever it detects certain problem 
situations. 

Protective code is "invisible" in the sense that under normal circum- 
stances the behavior of any particular program remains exactly the same, 
whether or not the protective code is included. The extra p-codes do re- 
quire space and execution time of their own, however. Thus, an object 
program that includes protective code is slightly larger and executes 
somewhat more slowly than an object program that functions identical- 
ly but doesn't contain the extra code. On the other hand, the program 
without protective code is more dangerous; even seemingly trivial errors 
in program design can compromise the Pascal system, unless protective 
code intervenes. 

Two types of protective code are described below. You may order the 
compiler to dispense with either or both by using the appropriate com- 
piler directive instructions. 

Range-Checking: The R Instruction. "Range-checking" code en- 
sures that variables of subrange types are assigned only the range values 
they can hold, and that arrays and matrixes are referenced using only 
proper indexes. For instance, range-checking code would prevent illegal 
assignment of the value 256 to the subrange variable Byte in the example 
given above. 

To disable the generation of range-checking code, simply insert the 
directive 

(*$R-*) 

into your program at appropriate points. The directive 

{*$R+*) 

causes the compiler to resume production of range-checking code. 

The elimination of range-checking code will be of most benefit to 
programs that make extensive use of strings, arrays or matrixes, and sub- 
range data types. For example, applying the R— instruction to the fol- 
lowing source program results in object code that executes around 15 percent 
faster than the normal, protected version: 

(*$R-*) 
PROGRAM 

Tests peed; 

CONST 



BEL= 7; (* ASCII value for bell (beep) *) 

MinReps= 1; 

MaxReps= 100; 

Lowlnx= 1; 

Highlnx= 999; 
VAR 



I, J: Integer; 
A: ARRAY [Lowinx . . Highinx) OF Integer; 
BEGIN (* TestSpeed *) 
Write{Output, 'PRESS RETURN TO BEGIN TEST'); 
ReadLn(lnput); 

FOR I := MinReps TO MaxReps DO 
FOR J := Lowinx TO Highinx DO 
A[J] := J; 

WriteLn(Output, Chr(BEL), 'END OF TEST'); 
END (* TestSpeed *). 

Nearly all the range-checking code in TestSpeed is associated with 
the single assignment statement A/JJ := J. Simply ronoving protective 
code from this one statement produces a significant increase in the pro- 
gram's overall execution speed, but it doesn't decrease the size of the 
total object program by any appreciable amount. In fact, you should 
never expect use of R— to shrink the object code for any particular pro- 
gram by more than 5 percent. (Savings of around 2 percent arc typical.) 
R— is more useful in optimizing object code speed rather than size. 

I/O Checking: A New Form of I Instruction. After every I/O oper- 
ation, a special Pascal system variable acquires a completion code that sig- 
nifies whether or not the operation succeeded. This Integer value is usual- 
ly zero, indicating that the preceding I/O operation took place without 
mishap. Occasionally, however, a disk drive fails, the user provides con- 
fusing data through the keyboard, or some other calamity occurs. At 
these times, the special system variable is set to a positive Integer value 
that indicates the nature of the problem. 

Your programs can examine the I/O completion code by means of 
the built-in Integer function lOResult. The value returned by lOResult is 
precisely that contained in the system's I/O status variable, and it is al- 
ways one of the Integers listed in Appendix B, table 2, of the Apple Pas- 
cal Language Reference Manual. 

Under normal circumstances, however, protective, "I/O-checking" 
code examines lOResult immediately after every I/O operation. When- 
ever lOResult becomes nonzero, this protective code calls the operating 
system's error-handling routine, just as range-checking code does when it 
detects an illegal assignment or an out-of-range array index. In other 
words, protective code (if present) always manages to observe and re- 
spond to lOResult before your program can. 

With the directive (*$I— *), you can force the compiler to quit pro- 
ducing the protecfive code that checks lOResult, thus leaving your pro- 
gram free to detect and handle error situations for itself. When you'd 
rather have the operating system deal with I/O errors, the directive 
(*$I + *) orders the compiler to resume the generation of the corre- 
sponding protective code. 

To see how the I instruction works, study this sequence of code: 

VAR 
F 

:Text; 

FN ; 
:String; v 
BEGIN i: 
REPEAT 

Write(Output, 'File name: '); ^ 
ReadLn(lnput, FN); 

r$i-*) 

Reset(F, FN); 

(*$! + *) . 
UNTIL (lOResult = 0); 1 
END; • 

This program slice requests the name of a file from the user, then at- 
tempts to associate the variable F with the specified file. lOResult will be 
nonzero if the Reset operation fails; should this occur, another file name 
will be requested, and the cycle will continue until the call to Reset is suc- 
cessful, as indicated by an lOResult of zero. Without I-, an unsuccess- 
ful Reset would lead to the abrupt (and probably inappropriate) termi- 
nation of the program. 

Note that the "I/O-checking" instruction is not the same as the "in- 



JUNE 1983 S C:) 1^ T A L 1^ m 231 



elude file" instruction we studied last month, even though the same key- 
letter is involved. The compiler distinguishes one type of instruction from 
the other by the different types of parameters each requires. A "name pa- 
rameter" following the I signifies source file inclusion, while a "switch 
parameter" indicates the enabling or disabling of protective code. 

On page 32, the Apple Pascal Language Reference Manual claims that 
"lORESULT only [returns] a valid [function value] the first time it is ref- 
erenced after [any particular] I/O operation . . . [subsequent references] 
return 0." This simply isn't so, although it is easy to understand how the 
rumor got started. Consider the following program fragment: 

VAR 
F 

:Text; 
BEGIN 

r$i-*) 

Reset(F, 'thisnameismuchtoolong.text'); 
(*$! + *) 

IF (lOResulK > 0) 
THEN 

WriteLn(Output, 'Error number ', lOResult); 

END; 

The call to Reset will always fail, because the file name given is in- 
valid, according to the rules of Apple Pascal. Thus, the IF-clause (lORe- 
sult <> 0) will be true immediately afterward. However, here is what 
WriteLn puts on the console: 

Error number 0 

The erroneous explanation in the Apple manual is consistent with 
this mystifying behavior. lOResult is nonzero the first time it is accessed 
following the failed call to Reset, and so the IF-clause succeeds. Accord- 
ing to the manual, lOResult then automatically becomes zero, which is 
the value of the function as reported by WriteLn. 

In reality, the value of lOResult is updated after (and only after) each 
I/O operation. Your program may refer to lOResult thousands and 
thousands of times between two I/O operations; the values returned will 
be identical, and they will be zero only if the preceding I/O operation 
was successful. lOResult will be zero by the time WriteLn is executed in 
the above example; this is because output of the String value 'Error num- 
ber' is itself a successful I/O operation that changes the value of lORe- 
sult before it can be displayed. 

Remember, Write and WriteLn are "anomalous" procedures. They 
aren't really procedures at all — at least not in the way your own routines 
are. The "procedure call" 

WriteLn(Output, 'Error number ', lOResult); 

is shorthand for — and exactly equivalent to — the three calls: 

Write(Output, 'Error number '); 
Write(Output, lOResult); 
WriteLn(Output); 

lOResult is updated after each item is displayed, leading to the strange 
behavior we've already witnessed. If WriteLn were a true Pascal proce- 
dure, its arguments would be evaluated before any output took place, and 
the proper, nonzero value of lOResult would be displayed in our exam- 
ple. Unfortunately, WriteLn is anomalous, and you must take this fact 
into consideration when using WriteLn to display the value of lOResult. 
Careful, clever design can enable your programs to avoid this trap but 
can also render them obscure. An easier way to get around the problem 
is always to assign lOResult's value to some local Integer variable and 
then to use the stable variable, rather than the unstable function value, in 
subsequent computation: 

VAR 
F 

:Text; 
lOR 

:lnteger; (* will contain lOResult for local use *) 
BEGIN (* correct technique *) 
(*$l-*) 

Reset(F, 'thisnameismuchtoolong.text'); 
(*$l + *) 

lOR := lOResult; 
IF (lOR <> 0) 
THEN ■ 



WriteLn(Output, 'Error number ', lOR); 

END: 

When To Quit Paying for Protection. Experienced programmers es- 
chew protective code in two situations: 

1. Once a programmer has rigorously tested a program and is 
confident about its reliability, she may elect to dispjense with 
protective code, so as to increase the program's execution speed 
and reduce its memory requirements. If you are ever tempted 
to do this, keep in mind that, the larger and more complicated 
a program is, the less it deserves to operate unchecked, even af- 
ter extensive testing. 

2. In many cases, the program itself needs to recognize and deal 
with its own problems, so as to appear "friendly" to an inex- 
perienced user. For instance, suppose your program asks the 
user to mount disk A, but disk B is mounted by mistake. If the 
program then attempts to access a file on A, the operation will 
fail. At this point, protective code will step in, abort the pro- 
gram, and reinitialize the system. This is like swatting a fly with 
a sledgehammer. From the user's point of view, it would be 
better for the program simply to repeat its request for disk A. 
Such friendly behavior is impossible, however, unless protec- 
tive code is eliminated at strategic spots in the program. 

The following program, TestCopy, replicates the contents of one text 
file in another. The names of both the source and destination files are 
specified by the user. TestCopy is remarkable more for its error-han- 
dling capabilities than for its speed; the copying process proceeds on a 
character-by-character basis, and is therefore as slow as molasses. How- 
ever, judicious application of the I— compiler directive instruction per- 
mits TestCopy's "active ingredient," the function CopyTestFile, to 
recognize and recover from problem situations without having to rely on 
the operating system's clumsy and cryptic error-handling mechanism. As 
you study CopyTextFile, note that the compiler is never restrained from 
producing I/O-checking code for more than a statement or two. Good 
programmers never interfere with the system's protective mechanisms 
any more than is necessary to get the job done. To do otherwise would be 
foolhardy.

Stepping over the Line: U- Compilation. The U instruction may be 
used to tell the compiler whether to produce "user-level" or "system- 
level" object code. 

In past discussions, we've seen that Apple Pascal allows programs to 
be organized into two or more segments. Each segment is a group of pro- 
cedures and functions that remains on disk until called by the currently 
active program. While a segment is being used, it is active and resides in 
RAM until it is no longer needed. Then, it is erased from RAM, becom- 
ing inactive until such time as it is needed again. While a segment is ac- 
tive, two copies of it exist: the one on disk and the one in RAM. (Of 
course, only the copy in RAM matters to the p-machine.) The code for 
an inactive segment exists only on disk. 

In truth, the p-machine knows how to execute only one program: the 
operating system, which is associated with segment 0. This "superpro- 
gram" is always active — it always resides in RAM. Under normal cir- 
cumstances, your program's code and data are assigned to segment 1. 
When you order Apple Pascal to ex(ecute one of your own programs, the 
operating system obliges by fetching the code from disk, loading it into | 
RAM memory as segment 1, and calling it -as if it were a procedure. 
While your program executes, it and the operating system are active 
simultaneously, and each occupies its own region in your Apple's RAM 
memory. 

When first invoked, the compiler assumes that it will be processing a 
user program, intended for segment 1. In other words, it operates as if 
the directive (*$U+*) were placed at the beginning of your program's 
text. Upon encountering a U— instruction, however, the compiler 
switches over to generating code for segment 0. Understandably, the U— 
instruction should only appear at the very beginning of program text, 
even before the PROGRAM heading. It may be preceded, however, by 
comments and certain compiler directive instructions — especially those 
that control the generation of listings. 

The U— directive tells the compiler that it is in the employ of a sys- 
tems programmer. Because there is no trifling with such an individual, 
the compiler will neither emit protective code nor worry about String 
VAR parameters. In other words, U— incorporates R— , I—, and V—. 

The main body of a "U— " program is loaded into the space that is 
normally occupied by the operating system; its global variables are stored 
in the space allocated to the operating system's global variables. Thus, a 
"U— " program had better be the operating system, or at least be a pro- 
gram that performs all the same functions in a very similar fashion, since 
once it is loaded into RAM, it becomes the operating system, whether it 
deserves that title or not. This is one reason why you find almost no 
documentation for U- compilation in Apple's manuals. Apple quite un- 
derstandably wants to keep you from writing programs that must, by 
their very nature, clobber the operating system! 

Among the global data kept by the operating system are such items 
as the current date, the name of the bootstrap disk, and other interesting 
and useful tidbits. The U- instruction is crucial to the writing of pro- 
grams that access this information without disturbing the operating sys- 
tem code itself. However, it would be fruitless to study U— compilation 
and systems programming techniques until we have mastered the use of 
segment procedures, units, and variant records. Fortunately, these sub- 
jects are just around the comer and, as soon as we have examined them 
in sufficient detail, we will again take up the challenge of U— 
compilation. JM

SOFICARD 
SYmposhim 

by Greg Tibbetts 



Welcome to the June installment of Soft- 
card Symposium. This month we'll begin a mul- 
tipart series on the BIOS disk I/O routines. The 
pace at which this series progresses will be slow 
enough to allow for adequate explanation of 
this complex area. 

Although CP/M, like other operating sys- 
tems, controls all elements of the hardware in a 
given computer, there's no doubt that its main 
purpose is to control the disk hardware in a 
disk-based system. CP/M cannot be installed 
and used without a disk drive, and its primary 
module, BDOS, is named Basic Disk Operat- 
ing System. This is not to make light of the 
character I/O portions of CP/M; they too are 
necessary. But it is the disk routines that make 
CP/M what it is, so to speak. 

Before beginning to discuss the actual rou- 
tines, we should examine some terms that will 
be used frequently in this and upcoming col- 
umns. Most of you will recognize most of these 
terms, but it's important to review so that we all 
associate the same concept with a specific term. 

The terms disk, hard disk, floppy disk, disk 
drive, and diskette all refer in some manner to a 
type of mass-storage device. The correct term 
for the device itself is disk drive. The disk drive is 
one of the few highly mechanical devices in to- 
day's computer systems. It consists of a motor 
driving a spindle which in turn causes the disk 
to spin. The disk surface is coated with a mag- 
netic material similar to that found on ordinary 
recording tape, and, in fact, its purpose is iden- 
tical to that of tape. The magnetic properties in 
the coating can be altered to form two distinct 
levels of magnetism, which we'll call magnet- 
ism and nonmagnetism, although these terms 
are not precisely correct. Creating isolated 
pockets of magnetism and nonmagnetism in an 
area of the coating allows storage, retrieval, and 
erasure of bits of information with relative ease. 

The disk's surface and its coating are most 
often referred to together as the drive's media. 

Disk drives come in two varieties, rigid and 
flexible. A rigid disk drive (also called a fixed or 
hard disk drive) is a sealed unit whose coated 
surface is made of aluminum or other hard ma- 
terial that will remain rigid under normal op- 
eration. The flexible disk drive (also called a 



floppy disk drive) is an unsealed unit whose me- 
dia is a type of thin plastic or Mylar. Like most 
plastics. Mylar is very easily flexed and bent. 
Regardless of the type of media, the principle of 
information storage in each case is identical. 
Each type of drive contains a read/write head, 
again similar to the head in a tape recorder. The 
head sits close to or directly in contact with the 
spinning disk and, when current is applied to it, 
creates the pockets of magnetism. 

The drive's read/write head is mounted in 
such a way that it moves in and out, like the 
tone arm of a record player, from the center of 
the surface to the rim. By stopping the head's in 
and out travel at a particular place and letting 
the disk spin underneath, a circular pattern of 
magnetized and nonmagnetized points on the 
coated surface may be created. This circular 
path is called a track. Unlike on a record, how- 
ever, the tracks on a drive's media are not 
grooves. Rather, they are simply concentric cir- 
cles of magnetism. 

Without grooves for the read/write head to 
follow, some method had to be devised so that 
the head would be able to find a specific track 
on the media. This is done by building drives to 
very strict specifications with a mechanism 
called a stepper. This mechanism enables a drive 
to position the read/write head over any track 
on command. The closer together a disk's 
tracks are, the greater the amount of informa- 
tion that can be stored on the disk. Of course, if 
tracks are too close together, the recording of 
information on one track will interfere with the 
information stored on tracks close by. Differ- 
ent drive designs allow closer tracks, depending 
on their accuracy and tolerance. Drives are 
rated for this attribute in number of tracks per 
inch of radius, called the drive's TPI value. In 
general, the higher the TPI value, the more ac- 
curately the drive must be constructed and the 
higher will be the potential for error. 

Within each track, the bits of information are 
grouped into easily manageable units called sec- 
tors. Each sector can then be treated as a block 
of information, organized into an address field 
and a data field. The address field contains the 
side, track, and sector numbers: information 
needed in order to find the data block. Addi- 



immii 



tional information, such as checksum values to 
aid in error determination, may also be in- 
cluded in the address. The data field contains 
the actual data stored in that sector and may be 
empty. Empty sectors are not truly empty; dur- 
ing the formatting process when the tracks are 
identified and formed, some set value will be 
written into the sector as fill. This is usually a 
value that — because of its bit pattern — is prone 
to error, so that the program formatting the 
disk can check the surface during the worst pos- 
sible case. Once again, the tolerance of the drive 
determines how many bits of information can 
be stored on a single track. Although there is a 
value called bits-per-inch, or BPI, it is seldom 
used by the microcomputer community. In- 
stead, this kind of information is usually ex- 
pressed as a value of how many sectors per 
track the drive will support for a given bytes- 
per-sector value. 

The first disk drives made were of the rigid 
media variety. As sealed and rigid units, not sus- 
ceptible to dust and dirt contamination, they 
could be built to very high tolerance. The disk 
tracks, therefore, could be very close together 
(usually hundreds of TPI), allowing tremen- 
dous amounts of data to be stored on relatively 
small surfaces. Unfortunately, these early disk 
drives were also very expensive, costing many 
thousands of dollars. As computers came into 
more widespread use, and as the slower mag- 
netic tape storage devices became inadequate to 
handle the storage needs of computer users who 
couldn't afford the rigid media drives, a cheap 
method of disk storage was called for. 

The floppy disk drive has become this inex- 
pensive method. Using plastic media in an un- 
sealed environment meant that not as many TPI 
or sectors per track could be tolerated. The first 
commercial drives (pioneered by IBM) were ca- 
pable of creating seventy-seven tracks on an 8- 
inch diameter surface and twenty-six 128-byte 
sectors per track. This became referred to as 
IBM 3740 format and is generally the industry 
standard even today. These fiexible disks held 
far less data than their rigid counterparts, but 
the media itself was cheap; and since it didn't 
need excessive protection it could be made re- 
movable. This meant that switching diskettes

(as these flexible surfaces were called) was rela- 
tively simple. 

Those first floppy disk drives were slow in 
storage and retrieval and generally low in ca- 
pacity by today's standards. It wasn't long, 
however, before they spread into almost uni- 
versal usage among microcomputer users. Af- 
ter that, nearly overnight it seems, new types of 
floppy disk drives began appearing. The first 
breakthrough came with a new way of storing 
the bits themselves, an innovative method called 
double-density encoding, which essentially dou- 
bled (or increased even further) the storage ca- 
pacity of a single disk. This method of encod- 
ing also required that the drives be built to high- 
er tolerances. 

While single density (the IBM 3740 format) 
has remained a true standard with its single- 
side, seventy-seven tracks, twenty-six sectors, 
and 128 bytes per sector, double density has lit- 
erally been all over the map. There are now 
many different double-density formats for 8- 
inch disk drives, with 256, 512, 1,024, or more 
bytes per sector, single and double-sided disks, 
and many different sectors-per-track values. 
The number of tracks, though, still remains at 
seventy-seven. This is because the mechanics of 
drive-stepper mechanisms must remain fairly 
constant so as to be able to read single-density 
media and therefore maintain some compati- 
bility between systems. 

The introduction of 5-inch-diameter disk 
drives with the numbers of tracks per side rang- 
ing from thirty-five to eighty, along with all 
the various double-density sectors-per-track and 
bytes-per -sector values, confused the issue even 
further, since no standard format at all exists for 
the 5-inch disk. The result, of course, is that no 
real standard beyond the 3740 format exists in 
the microcomputer industry. The Apple's disk 
format is of the 5-inch variety, and although 
Apple disks don't use the same format as other 
5-inch disks do, they are of approximate dou- 
ble density, with 256 bytes per sector and six- 
teen sectors per track. 

Any operating system must make provision 
to deal with the various types of disk drives and 
formats in use in the industry. Digital Re- 
search's method of doing so was to design 
CP/M to deal with 3740 format and to require 
the designers of the BIOS for a particular sys- 
tem to make adjustments as necessary to deal 
with their particular drives. 

The BIOS disk portion consists of two ele- 
ments: disk data structures and disk driver rou- 
tines. The data structures describe and define 
the characteristics of the disk drives to the BIOS 
and to BDOS, while the driver routines control 
and operate the drives. In this way, such infor- 
mation as BDOS might need in order to deter- 
mine total number of tracks, sectors per track, 
and so on is always provided to it by the system 
integrator via the data structures; and the ac- 
tual control of the drives is provided by rou- 
tines that BDOS can call to perform specific 
functions. Both the data structures and the driv- 
er routines are further broken down into sub- 
categories. 

There are two basic types of data struc-

was constantly being altered to reflect the cur- 
rent status of character I/O to the screen. Disk 
data temporaries likewise represent the status of 
the current disk operation, including such 
things as the current drive, track, and sector 
numbers being used. 

Tabular data, on the other hand, although it 
is altered occasionally, is more fixed than tem- 
porary data. Instead of being individual memory 
locations designed to keep temporary track of 
current status items, tabular data consists of ta- 
bles that describe the nature of each disk drive 
connected to the system. There are three types 
of this tabular data in use: the disk parameter 
headers (or DPHs), the disk parameter blocks 
(or DPBs), and the sector translation tables. 
These three structures contain all the informa- 
tion that BDOS and BIOS (together called 
FDOS for Full Disk Operating System) need in 
order to access and control the drives properly. 

The disk driver routines may also be brok- 
en down into a number of individual subrou- 
tines. Just like the character I/O subroutines we 
recently examined, each of these subroutines 
has its own entry in the BIOS jump table. For 
each BIOS disk function, there is one subrou- 
tine that BDOS may request of one of the disk 
drives connected to the computer. 

There are eight of these disk subroutines in 
total; they are HOME, SELDSK, SETTRK, 
SETSEC, SETDMA, READ, WRITE, and 
SECTRAN. The complete BIOS jump table is 
reproduced here so that you can see how the 
disk subroutines relate to the initialization and 
character I/O routines we've already covered. 
The relative address column identifies the posi- 
tion of each entry point as a number of bytes 
from the beginning of the table (which is also 
the beginning of BIOS itself). 

Since BIOS immediately follows BDOS in 
memory, and since the BIOS jump vector table 
is the first thing in the BIOS, BDOS can easily 
find whatever subroutine it needs by simply vec- 
toring control to BlOS-fxjr, where xx is the 
number in column two. In this way, BDOS 



need know nothing more about BIOS than the 
contents and arrangement of this table. Each of 
the eight disk subroutines is designed to per- 
form a single funcfion; when done in sequence, 
these functions allow BDOS to read or write a 
sector from or to one of the disk drives. Before 
the first read or write on a disk, BDOS calls 
each of the routines to set up the necessary pa- 
rameters. Subsequently, the routines are called 
only when it's necessary to alter a particular set 
of parameters. 

Taking the subroutines in the approximate 
order in which they are used, the first one to 
consider is SELDSK. It is this routine's respon- 
sibility to initialize several data temporaries and 
to return to BDOS with the address of the DPH 
data structure for the drive number that BDOS 
wants to be selected. Selecting a drive in this 
case, therefore means simply that temporaries 
to be used by routines coming later are set to in- 
dicate the appropriate drive, and BDOS is in- 
formed of the characteristics of that drive by 
being given the address of the drive's DPH. The 
DPH itself, as we'll see later, contains the ad- 
dresses of that drive's DPB and sector transla- 
tion table. 

Some systems that may be using both single 
and double-density media need to be able to de- 
termine automatically which kind is in use; 
SELDSK is also the routine that handles that 
determination. Making this determination is 
usually a trial and error process, with dummy 
reads being attempted on the disk at double-sid- 
ed/double-density, single-sided/double-density 
and, finally, single-sided/single-density. Which- 
ever read completes a sector-read operation 
without error determines the density and sides 
selected. SELDSK also modifies the data struc- 
tures in these cases to refiect the drive's new 
status. 

The next routine used by BDOS is HOME. 
Its purpose is to force the newly selected disk 
drive to position the read/ write head to track 
(X). This process of moving the read/write head 
is called seeking. HOME is done primarily to

initialize the disk drive, by placing the 
read/write head at a known location. Typical- 
ly, a BIOS HOME routine works by simply 
calling the BIOS SETTRK routine itself with a 
track number of 00. 

These first two routines, SELDSK and 
HOME, may be thought of as initialization rou- 
tines, since they are called only when a drive is 
selected for a future read and write. So long as 
this drive continues to be the one in use, these 
routines will not be called again. As soon as 
another drive is selected, however, both BDOS 
and BIOS forget the attributes of this drive, and 
reselecting it requires that both of these rou- 
tines be called once again. 

The next several calls are made just prior to 
the actual read or write. They establish the par- 
ticular location on the disk and the particular 
location in memory between which the data will 
be transferred. Generally these calls can be 
made in any order, with the exception of the call 
to SECTRAN which must always precede the 
call to SETSEC. Usually, however, these rou- 
tines are called in one of two orders: SETDMA, 
SETTRK, SECTRAN, and SETSEC; or 
SETTRK, SECTRAN, SETSEC, and 
SETDMA. 

Calling the first routine, SETDMA, in- 
stalls a particular address value (given to it by 
BDOS) into a temporary variable that READ 
or WRITE will use later on to determine where 
in memory to put or get data that will be trans- 
ferred to or from the disk. SETDMA, then, 
simply makes sure that other BIOS routines 
k now where in memory the next sector is to be 
obtained from or placed. The term DMA 
stands for direct memory access. Its origin 
comes from the fact that certain computers con- 
tain a type of hardware (known, obviously, as 
DMA circuitry) that transfers data directly be- 
tween memory and an external device (a disk 
drive, external banks of memory, or some 
other device). 

This differs from the way things are set up in 
other computers, where each byte of data com- 
ing in or going out must be handled individual- 
ly by the computer's processor. In other sys- 
tems, the processor must get the byte from the 
device and store it in memory, or get the byte 
from memory and pass it to the device. Using 
DMA hardware greatly speeds up external de- 
vice operations, since, after giving the DMA 
controller the necessary information on where 
to transfer data from, how much to transfer, 
and what direction to transfer in, the processor 
need not be involved at all. Although not 
all computers have such hardware, the term 
DMA has come to be used somewhat loosely; 
consequently, the address of data to be trans- 
ferred has generally come to be called the DMA 
address whether DMA circuitry is used or not. 

The next subroutine to be called is 
SETTRK. SETTRK takes the track number 
passed to it by BDOS and forces the disk drive 
to seek to that track on the media. In practice, 
BIOS SETTRK routines seldom do the actual 
seek at the time they are called. Instead, they set 
a temporary variable to the BDOS-requested 
track number, leaving it for READ or WRITE 



to force the drive to perform the actual seek. In 
the case of double-sided drives, SETTRK may 
also take care of translating the BDOS track 
number (since BDOS is ignorant of the exis- 
tence of double-sided drives) into an actual 
track number and a head number. This activity 
may also be handled by the READ and 
WRITE routines, however. 

Once the track and the DMA address have 
been set, BDOS must tell the BIOS what sector 
of the track is to be read or written to. There's 
an added bit of confusion here, resulting from 
the way BDOS looks at logical sectors (that is, 
as though the sectors were written sequentially 



on the disk), while the BIOS must select the 
physical sector. As we've alluded to in the past 
during more general discussions, there is in 
many cases a difference between these two num- 
bers. The reason for this difference is that, as 
fast as computers are, they are not always fast 
enough to read and process data from the disk 
as quickly as it comes by the read/write head. 

Obviously, the software doing the disk read 
or write can keep up during the reading or writ- 
ing of the bytes in a given sector. When these 
operations stop, however (to return control to 
BDOS to process the data or call the routines to 
set the next track, sector, and DMA address), the

READ or WRITE routine generally can't be 
called fast enough the second time to catch the 
beginning of the next sector as it passes by the 
head. This forces READ or WRITE to wait al- 
most a full disk revolution before getting the 
next sector. This is especially common with 
double-density format, where the distance be- 
tween sectors is shorter still. At three hundred 
revolutions a minute, this may not seem like 
much of a drawback, but you'd be surprised 
how much the reading and writing of data can 
be slowed down by "blowing revs," as this ef- 
fect is called. 

To prevent blowing revs between fast reads 
or writes of disk sectors, the sectors are spaced 
farther apart; this is done by placing other sec- 
tors in between them. You can demonstrate this 
arrangement to yourself by drawing a pie with 
sixteen sections, one for each sector of the disk. 
Around the outside of the pie, number the sec- 
tions sequentially zero through fifteen. Now, 
starting at zero, number inside the sections zero 
through fifteen again, but this time skip two be- 
tween each number so that zero is inside the sec- 
tion with zero on the outside but one is inside 
the section with three on the outside, two is in- 
side section six, and so on. When you reach the 
section you started at, you'll see that by skip- 
ping two each time you still land on an empty 
section, even though you go around the pie 
three full times. When you finish you'll find that 
you've drawn a representation of logical-to- 
physical sector numbers for a given track. In 
our diagram, the numbers outside the sections

represent the physical sector numbers while 
the numbers inside represent the logical sector 
numbers. This technique is called sector inter- 
leaving, and since two physical sectors were 
skipped between one logical sector and the next, 
this particular instance is an example of a two- 
sector interleave. Simple, no? 

With today's better disk drive controller 
electronics, interleaving can actually be done 
two ways. The method just illustrated is called 
software interleaving; the disk controller actual- 
ly numbers the sectors sequentially and num- 
bers each sector's address field to match the 
numbers shown outside the sections in our dia- 
gram. It is therefore up to the software to figure 
out for a given logical sector (the number inside 
the section) what physical sector number it must 
pass to the disk controller to get the actual sec- 
tor it wants. In the case of our diagram, for ex- 
ample, if the BIOS wants the second sector it 
wrote earlier, it has to ask the disk controller for 
physical sector number six. 

The other method of interleaving is called 
physical or hardware interleaving, and it re- 
quires a disk controller with more smarts. In 
this method, when the disk is formatted, the 
controller numbers the sector's address field 
using the order shown inside the sections. That 
way, even though there are still two sectors be- 
tween the first sector and the second, the BIOS 
simply passes the logical sector number directly 
to the controller; the logical and physical sector 
numbers are the same. 

Since early controllers could not perform 
hardware interleaving, CP/M is based on the 
idea of software interleaving. As such, CP/M 
demands that every BIOS provide a SEC- 
TRAN routine, the purpose of which is to 
translate the logical sector given to it by BDOS 
into the physical sector needed by the control- 
ler. This is done by means of the sector transla- 
tion table, which we'll get into in depth when we 
go on to data structures. 

Systems with 8-inch disks that don't use 
software interleaving for double density must 
still provide it for single-density 3740 format so 
that they can still read or write to these stan- 
dard disks. When dealing with their double- 
density drives, they can simply have SECTRAN 
return the same number to BDOS that BDOS 
gave it. Systems using only 5-inch drives and 
hardware interleaving needn't provide software 
interleaving at all; they just use the shortened 
form of SECTRAN mentioned a moment ago. 
In any case, BDOS always calls SECTRAN 
and gives it the logical sector number, then calls 
SETSEC immediately with whatever number it 
received from the SECTRAN roudne. 

This brings us to SETSEC. It is the job of 
this routine to take the sector number given it 
by BDOS and place that number in a tempo- 
rary variable for later use by READ and 
WRITE. It is assumed (by BDOS, anyway) that 
this is the physical disk sector to be accessed. In 
this way, SETSEC is like SETTRK and 
SETDMA, since it doesn't actually do any- 
thing with the drive itself but works instead on- 
ly with the data temporaries. These last four 
routines are called before every disk access and 



simply set the stage for later. 

The next two routines, READ and WRITE, 
are very similar to one another in their opera- 
tion. Using the data temporaries just estab- 
lished, they perform the bulk of the work in- 
volved in controlling the drive. Their first job is 
to examine the track number BDOS requested, 
compare it to the last track number used (which 
will generally be the track the head is now posi- 
tioned over), and, if necessary, to move the head 
in or out to the requested track. Their next job 
is to find the sector requested and either read it 
into memory starting at the DMA address or 
write it to disk from the DMA address. If the 
read or write was completed without error, they 
return to BDOS with a 00 in the [A] register. An 
error, however, is reported by returning with a 1 
in the [A] register. If an error occurs, the READ 
and WRITE routines must attempt at least ten 
retries before returning to BDOS. This is so 
that, if a sector is only moderately unstable, it 
may still be read successfully, since BDOS itself 
makes no provision for allowing a reread of the 
same sector. 

BDOS responds to an error by printing BDOS 
ERR ON x: BAD SECTOR, where x: is the 
drive letter. It then waits for the operator to 
type a control-C, which aborts the endre opera- 
tion; or any other character, which ignores the 
bad sector and reads or writes the remainder of 
the information. 

There is one other error that can be gen- 
erated by BDOS under command of the BIOS 
during write operations. This is the write-pro- 
tect error. BDOS has always had the capability 
to report BDOS ERR ON x: R/0 (read on- 
ly), but it was originally reserved for those times 
when a file or a disk had been purposely set to 
read-only status by the operator, or when a disk 
had been changed without BDOS having been 
informed of the change via a warm boot. 

Floppy disks can, of course, also be write- 
protected by installing a tab over the notch on a 
5-inch disk or by removing the tab on an 8-inch 
disk. In the very early versions of CP/M, hav- 
ing the BIOS report write-protected disks was 
not allowed for, since some disk controllers 
were not capable of indicating that this was the 
problem. Better disk controllers made this pos- 
sible though, and, in an attempt to provide this 
capability, an entry point in BDOS was identi- 
fied that would generate this error and allow 
correct recovery from it. Therefore, if a write- 
protect error occurs, most of today's BIOS 
modules remove the BDOS return address off 
the stack to clear it and jump to this entry post 
at BD0SSTART-F7, where BDOSSTART is 
the normal BDOS entry point. 

One final job of READ and WRITE is sec- 
tor blocking and deblocking. We'll get into the 
actual details when we cover these routines, but 
basically this is a means by which BDOS can 
treat all disks as having 128-byte sectors, as they 
do in 3740 format, when in reality they may 
have sectors as long as 4,096 bytes. Block/de- 
block is implemented by having a physical disk 
buffer that is separate from the DMA address 
BDOS is using. When BDOS requests that a 
sector be placed at the DMA address, it is al- 



ways requesting a 128-byte sector only. If a 
drive uses 256-byte sectors, then READ (or 
WRITE) cannot move all 256 sectors between 
the disk and the DMA address. To do so would 
write over valuable information in memory or 
place bad data on the disk. Using a physical 
disk buffer, READ, for instance, can read all 
256 bytes into the physical buffer when the sec- 
tor number that corresponds to the first half of 
the physical sector is requested. Additional code 
in READ then moves the first 128 bytes of this 
data to the DMA address. When (and iO BDOS 
requests the second half of the physical sector 
by requesting the next sector number, READ 
can get the same physical disk sector and move 
the second 128 bytes to the new DMA address. 

In cases where block/ deblock is in use, 
DBOS is informed via the DPB data structure 
of the number of sectors per track that the me- 
dia would have if its sectors were 128 bytes long 
(rather than being told the actual number of 
sectors it has). The Apple media, for example, 
with sixteen 256-byte sectors per track, is shown 
to BDOS as actually having thirty-two sectors 
per track. Since there are two "CP/M" sectors 
for every physical sector, BIOS simply divides 
the sector number that BDOS requests by two 
to get the actual physical sector. It then uses the 
fact of whether the number was odd or even to 
decide which half of the physical sector BDOS 
wants. The same principle is used whatever the sec- 
tor size, although determining which chunk of the 
physical sector is being requested gets slightly more 
complex as the sector size gets larger. 

In the WRITE routine, special care must be 
taken during block/deblock. This is because 
BDOS may only wish to write one 128-byte sec- 
tor to the disk. If WRITE were to move that 
sector immediately into the disk buffer and 
write it to disk, it might obliterate the other half 
of the physical sector with whatever garbage 
was in the buffer. WRITE must therefore be ca- 
pable of seeing whether that physical sector has 
been used before and therefore contains valid 
data. If so, WRITE must read it from the disk 
into the buffer, move the new half requested by 
BDOS from the DMA address into the buffer, 
and then write the entire physical sector back to 
the disk. BDOS helps in this regard by passing 
an extra parameter to BIOS that tells it whether 
that disk sector was previously allocated (in use) 
or unallocated. WRITE uses this information to 
decide whether to preread the buffer or not. If 
things were handled as described here, the sys- 
tem would be slowed down by all the prereads 
and other activities that are required. During 
the dme CP/M has been in use, several changes 
have been instituted to make block/deblock 
more efficient; these will be described when we 
discuss the actual READ and WRITE routines 
themselves. 

Next month we'll begin discussing the ac- 
tual SoftCard BIOS by examining the data 
structures and how they're organized. In com- 
ing installments we'll go on to talk about each 
of the disk I/O routines and see how each one 
functions. When we're finished, you should 
have a much better picture of how this portion 
of the BIOS operates. Until next month. . . .Jl

Banking on 
Simplicity 



If you had asked nine-year-old Matt Sha- 
piro five months ago what he hated most about 
school, writing would have topped the list. Like 
a lot of youngsters, he found writing by hand a 
rite of agony — and it showed in his work. 

"He was a fourth-grader but writing and 
spelling at a secxjnd-grade level," recalls teacher 
Robert Warde of the West Orchard Elemen- 
tary School in Chappaqua, New Jersey. 

"Writing was the only negative in his other- 
wise positive outlook on life, and I was hoping 
to find something to turn him around." 

That "something" turned out to be Bank 
Street Writer, the child-tested word processor 
that's so easy to learn, even adults can master it. 
Warde vividly remembers the breakthrough 
day. He and Matt were working after school 
editing Matt's story about the class trip to 
Sturbridge Village, a faithfully restored New 
England settlement (circa 1820) in western Mas- 
sachusetts. There were so many things to write 
about that Matt could do litde more than list 
them in his first, handwritten draft — the one he 
keyed into an Apple with Bank Street follow- 
ing fifteen minutes' instruction from Warde. 

Banking on Bellows. Lists don't bring a 
story to life, details do; so Warde pressed Matt 
to tell him more about what he'd seen in the 



Berkshire Mountains. The blacksmith shop had 
three bellows, as Matt had written, but what 
were they for, asked Warde. And what about 
the drop stone on the pulley that automatically 
closed the door of the blacksmith's shop? How 
did it work? 

Warde figures that Matt spent a good two 
hours — two uncomplaining hours — editing the 
story, but the real payoff came when the two of 
them visited principal Robert Jackson, the man 
responsible for bringing computers to the ele- 
mentary school in Chappaqua, an upscale bed- 
room community in Westchester County. Matt, 
the boy who'd hated editing, looked up at the 
principal and, in what was music to his teacher's 
ears, said matter-of-factly, "But of course, we 
still have to do a lot more on it." 

To someone unfamiliar with the habits of 
young pencil pushers, such a remark might 
hardly seem extraordinary, but Warde regards 
it as a conceptual breakthrough. Before he in- 
troduced word processing to his computer-dem- 
onstration class in February, a story was a 
product, not a process. It was etched in granite 
by youngsters pushing pencils that often felt to 
them like giant redwoods. When a child fin- 
ished a writing chore like this, it was done — and 
good riddance.

"Kids had this quality of finality about their 
writing," says Warde. "I could have talked till I 
was blue in the face about the value of revising 
as the soul of good writing, but as long as the te- 
dium of recopying existed, they didn't want to 
change what they'd written. With word process- 
ing, they can see things don't have to be all 
good or all bad. If they take a few minutes to 
correct the bad points, they have a whole dif- 
ferent story." 

Which brings us, with relentless logic, to the 
heart of a different story, the one about the 
word processor with the funny name and that 
most powerful of features — simplicity. Incredi- 
ble as it may seem, someone has actually de- 
signed a simple-to-use word processor. It's not 



everything a word processor could be, but Bank 
Street Writer appears to be everything little kids 
(and most big kids) will probably ever need — a 
forgiving typewriter. 

Star and Newsmaker. Since its release in 
December of last year. Bank Street Writer has 
held its own among top-selling word proc- 
essors, its ascent spurred by a low-end price tag 
($69.95 for Broderbund's home version, $95 for 
the school tutorial package from Scholastic) and 
a couple of glowing write-ups in Time maga- 
zine and the New York Times. Thus far, user re- 
ports are proving as friendly as the program. 
And, what's more. Bank Street even appears to 
be turning some dyed-in-the-wool technophobes 
on to computing — from English teachers and busy 



execs with no time for manuals to those who up till 
now were afraid of or uninterested in computers. 

"The kind of response we're getting from 
English teachers is that here at last is something 
for us," says the program's spiritual father, 
Richard Ruopp, president of the Bank Street 
College of Education in New York City. "Up 
till now all the software for schools has either 
been management or math science software, 
with some drill and practice programs in the 
language arts. There were no writing tools for 
kids or, as far as that's concerned, for adults. 

"Most word processors are business tools, 
not writers' tools. They're terrific for somebody 
who uses one all the time and cares about for- 
matting, but not for someone who simply wants 
to write. The notion of an easy-to-use word 
processor is not profound. What is surprising is 
that nobody had ever done it before." 

Ruopp and his staff at Bank Street's Center 
for Children and Technology came to that (fon- 
clusion in 1981. The new center had just re- 
ceived a $74,(XX) grant from the Lounsbery 
Foundation to study the impact of word proc- 
essing on children's writing and editing, only to 
discover that there was nothing commercially 
available for kids to use. Since the only way to 
conduct the study fairly was with a program 
youngsters could easily grasp, Ruopp and com- 
pany realized they'd have to reinvent the word 
processing wheel one more time. Very logical, 
perhaps, but would it sell in an industry already 
awash in "user-friendlies"? 

A private teachers' college with links to the 
progressive education movement and a former 
Greenwich Village address. Bank Street Col- 
lege had experience in developing income-pro- 
ducing commercial properties. It pioneered a 
popular series of multiracial, urban grade- 
school readers in the sixties, but software pub- 
lishing was something new. 

Simply Complex. So new and so problem- 
atic, in fact, that Ruopp recognized the need 
for something borrowed — the organizing and 
marketing experience of consultant Franklin E. 
Smith of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Smith, a 
former colleague of Ruopp's, understood the 
complexity of simphcity. It was Smith who put 
together the unique development team consist- 
ing of the college and Intentional Educations of 
Watertown, Massachusetts, on the design and 
programming end, and Broderbund Software 
and Scholastic respectively on the home and 
school marketing fronts. 

"Frank was a very good manager of the de- 
sign process," says an admiring Ruopp. "He 
would tell the educators, 'That's a wonderful 
idea, but we can't do it because we don't have 
enough memory.' And then he'd say to Gene 
Kusmiak, the principal programmer, 'This is 
for kids. If you want to create a word processor 
that will do the bells and whistles, let's do it 
another time.' " 

What they were doing this time was pro- 
ducing a low-end minimal word processor. It 
had to run on an Apple (which had the largest 
installed base in schools and a familiar assem- 
bly language), off a home television set on one 
disk drive, and require no expensive add-ons.

Which was another way of saying the program 
had to be completely resident in memory and 
feature a hi-res page to permit upper and lower 
case without hardware modifications. 

"We could have supported eighty columns, 
but we decided it was impossible to read if done 
in software on a hi-res-graphics page," Smith 
explains. "So we decided to stick with forty col- 
umns and solve in other ways the problems that 
that would create." 

What emerged after a year of development 
and testing is the friendliest little word proces- 
sor around. It is not unique in terms of its fea- 
tures; Smith freely admits he borrowed high- 
lighting from friend Mitch Kapor's VisiPlot and 
other touches from Wang. What is unique is 
the development team's ruthless dedication to 
Smith's concept of "powered simplicity." 

Straight to the Point. Consider. It has a 
boot time of nine seconds that puts you in- 
stantly into the writing mode. There are no 
made-in-HoUywood graphics to explode, no 
menus to pore over, just a blinking cursor 
awaiting your entry in the text window. The 
cursor sits in the upper-left corner of a rectan- 
gle that represents a page. Prompts above the 
rectangle, at the top of the screen, give all the in- 
struction you need. 

Want caps? Hold down the shift key and 
hit the N/inverted caret key. Want all caps? Hit 
N a second time while holding down the shift 
key. Want to erase? Strike the left arrow key. 
Want help or want to change something you've 
written? Just hit escape and — voila — you're in 
edit mode guided by a new set of prompts 
above the window. Change your mind again 
and want to write? Just hit escape and toggle 
back into writing. It's that easy, and, what's 
more, you've done it without reference to a 
manual. 

Bank Street sports a handy, pocket-size 
manual of twenty-eight pages, but the truth is, 
you really don't need it. And why should you if 
all you want to do is get down to writing that 
occasional letter, memo, or school paper. 

"We wanted to make Bank Street power- 
ful," says Smith, "but with only those features 
the average person needed. We made a list of all 
the features a word processor could have 
and then threw out those that would be of use 
to only 10 percent of the market." 

So be forewarned, formatters. Bank Street 
doesn't support the exotica of word process- 
ing — underlining, subscripting and superscript- 
ing, and split screen — nor is it a guarantee of 
"instant success." Bank Street makes the edit- 
ing easier; the writing's still hard work. 

What the fledgling author needs in basic 
editing power, however. Bank Street delivers. 
The edit mode offers five choices: erase /un- 
erase; move/moveback; find/replace; transfer 
menu (which transfers you to the save, retrieve, 
and print functions); and a cursor control em- 
blem, a diamond-shaped display of the I-J-K-M 
cursor control keys. Each key is depicted on- 
screen as an arrow and points in the direction it 
moves the cursor. Specific functions are select- 
ed by manipulating a highlighter using the left- 
right keyboard direction arrows for lateral 



movement and the space bar for vertical. 

Cracking the Manual. These visual 
prompts are all a user needs with a short file, 
but the program also supports a second level of 
useful control keys. To learn these, you're ob- 
liged to crack the manual, but the commands 
are easily committed to memory. They're sim- 
ple and logical — control-B to move to the be- 
ginning of a text file, E for end, U for moving 
up twelve lines, D for moving down twelve 
lines, S to count the word space left in the file, I 
to indent eight, sixteen, twenty-four, or thirty- 
two spaces, and C for text centering. 

When you're processing text, there's noth- 
ing to remember. Everything you need to know 
is up there on the screen, one logical step after 
another. If you want to erase text, select that 
function with the highlighter and hit return. The 
program instructs you to place the cursor at the 
beginning of the passage you're deleting, fol- 
lowed by return; it then tells you to place the 
cursor at the end of the passage, followed by an- 
other return, with the cursor highlighting the 
entire block as it moves from the beginning to 
the end of the passage. To delete, simply an- 
swer yes to the program's yes/no prompt. 

End of passage, end of story, right? Wrong. 
In most programs, text deleted is text kissed off. 
Not with the forgiving Bank Street Writer. It 
lets fickle, agonized scribes recover their pre- 
cious words from pixilated limbo by selecting a 
function that makes perfect sense to kids of all 
ages — unerase. 



Smith marvels that he was ever able to get 
the educators at Bank Street to go along with 
that bastardized English, but it's just that sort of 
inspired flexibility that makes the program so 
refreshing. Eight-year-olds don't delete, they 
erase. And they unerase. Their preprocessing 
mind set was formed by pencils, erasers, and 
smudges. 

"Erasing is a very scary thing for kids," says 
Ruopp. "That sounds silly, but when you erase 
something, it's gone. Both the erase and move- 
back functions of Bank Street give kids a de- 
sign feature that allows them to take something 
out and see what it reads like with or without it, 
and still put it back without having to retype it." 

When it comes to printing. Bank Street 
Writer provides two options — print draft and 
print final, the latter asking the customary de- 
fault questions about spaces between lines and 
page numbering. The print-draft option prints a 
file exactly as it appears on-screen, with thirty- 
eight lines of text per page. That doesn't tell an 
adult how the text will format in a standard six- 
ty-five-character-line business letter, but it's 
great for kids who've yet to graduate to con- 
ventions of adult correspondence. What they 
see is what prints out, with generous right-hand 
margins to be used by teachers or the kids them- 
selves to write notes in. 

Little Big Writer. Bank Street Writer is a 
powerful little package, but it's not all-power- 
ful. It supports indents at eight, sixteen, twenty- 
four, and thirty-two columns, but not tabs. The

The biggest annoyance to date concerns 
the inherent limitations of the forty-character 
screen. It doesn't correspond to the standard 
sixty-five-character printout. As a result, some 
users complain that it's awkward typing date 
blocks so that they're flush with the right-hand 
margin, though this difficulty can be minimized 
by hitting the control-C centering command 
and estimating from there. 

"There also seems to be some confusion on 
the retrieve function," Smith reports. "When 
you retrieve something, it doesn't clear the buff- 
er. It appends whatever you're retrieving into 
what's already there, but with kids and adults 
that can be easily solved. We'll revise that so 
the program asks if you want to erase it or leave 
what's in there." 

Fancier word processors, such as Word- 
Star, permit users to suppress prompts and take 
short cuts as they grow familiar with a pro- 
gram. Bank Street is less flexible in this r^ard, 
at least in its present incarnation. "With Bank 
Street, you have to go through a series of steps 
that are laid out," says Smith. "That's the other 
side of user-friendliness. If you were using Bank 
Street Writer day in and day out, you might get 
tired of doing that." 

Handheld Targets. The target market for 
Bank Street probably wants all the handhold- 
ing it can get. Ruopp suggests that some con- 
trol short cuts — for example, extended cursor 
movement in the text mode — could be built into 
Bank Street to satisfy advanced users, but he 
feels strongly about keeping them as utility pro- 
gram default options. 

"Adults get frustrated when they have to go 
back and forth between write and edit modes 
correcting text," Ruopp explains. "But we did 
that as a design feature, because we think kids 
really have to separate out conceptually writing 
from editing. When you write you should write, 
and when you edit you should make a decision 
to do it." 

The larger question, as far as Ruopp is con- 
cerned, is whether children, and ultimately 
home users, will do more writing and editing be- 
cause of Bank Street Writer. He thinks the 
chances are good that they will, because the 
program makes the process so much easier, 
though ease isn't motivation and could be a 
novelty that wears off. 

"Machines may alter the way people per- 
ceive the environment," he cautions, "but they 
don't change things. People change things. I 
think the belief that the microcomputer is going 
to revolutionize education is about as mytho- 
logical as the belief that if every low-income per- 
son in the country became a computer opera- 
tor we'd solve poverty." 

The creators of Bank Street Writer had more 
modest objectives — to turn kids, teachers, and 
nontechies on to writing with an easy-to-use 
word processor. So far, at least, it appears to be 
succeeding, because it is creating the excitement 
that is the wellspring of education. Turned-on 
teachers turn on kids, says Ruopp, and teach- 
ers who were feeling unmotivated and lifeless 
now report to him that they're thinking differ- 
ently about their roles. Bank Street Writer is al-

"I'd like to see just how far word processing 
can go — down to the second and first grades," 
says Warde. "I find nothing that the kids have 
trouble with. It makes sense to me and it makes

half a dozen now that are typing without look-

ough program design) and good documenta- 
tion are to the effectiveness of a word process- 
ing program. The designers of Word Juggler 
(version 2.4) seem to have had these elements 
firmly in mind. 

Various features help make Word Juggler 
extraordinarily simple to operate. The package 
comes with two rubberlike templates that fit on- 
to the Apple III keyboard. One rectangular 
template fits around the Apple III keypad and 
identifies the functions that certain keys on the 
keypad will perform. These functions include 
printing a document, displaying a document, 
finding strings, replacing characters, setting 
tabs, inserting and deleting text, and returning 
to the menu. The second strip that fits above the 
top row of keys on the keyboard identifies spe- 
cial functions, such as centering, justification, 
spacing, page length and width, and so on. A 
quick reference card is also included in the 
package; it is me^nt to be placed in the "gut- 
ter" behind the keyboard so that it can be read- 
ily seen and used. 

The user guide for Word Juggler is well writ- 
ten, thorough, and readable. It contains both a 
table of contents and an index, as well as an 
eight-part reference section. Some screen illus- 
trations would have been a nice addition here, 
since they tend to clarify points being made in 
the text, but these omissions are not at all seri- 
ous in this case. 

In addition to providing information on 
how to configure your system, the guide pro- 
vides a helpful three-lesson tutorial. This is one 
of the more thorough tutorials around; by the 
time users finish working through it, they're 
likely to feel quite comfortable with the major 
features of the program. 

To begin, you enter, with guidance, a sim- 
ple letter. In the process, you become familiar 
with some of the special keys the package uses 
and the functions they perform. You discover, 
for example, that the deletion of previously 
typed characters is done by pressing the minus 
key on the keypad (remember, there's a tem- 
plate around this keypad that identifies the mi- 
nus key as a delete key). 

As you proceed through the tutorial, you do 
a good deal of editing. You learn how the ar- 
row keys move the cursor around the screen 
(and the text), how to store a letter on disk and 
retrieve it, and how to search for the occur- 
rence of a particular string and replace it with 
another. In the final part of the tutorial, you get 
experience at inserting page headers, number- 
ing pages, and performing many of the tasks 
that ultimately enhance the appearance and or- 
derliness of your document. 

The program has various features you're 
likely to appreciate. One especially helpful one 
is the ability to move blocks of text around. 
With many word processors, this task is ardu- 
ous at best, but not with this one. Word Juggler 
allows the user to copy, move, load, store, and 
delete portions (blocks) of text, all accom- 
plished by means of single keystrokes to mark 
the beginning and end of the block in question. 

Word Juggler also offers a wide variety of 
options for printing text. Subscripts, super- 



scripts, underlining, and boldface printing are 
all included. You can predefine certain vari- 
ables for use later on in your text, including 
Sdate, Syear, Smonth, Stime, and so on. These 
variables can be quite useful in many 
applications. 

Many of the print options are activated by 
pressing one of the special command keys (the 
top row of keys, with the template above them 
to identify what functions they'll perform). 
Among these functions are the control of page 
length, page width, centering, margins, line 
spacing, pitch indentation, and widow lines, to 
name a few. There's also a let command that al- 
lows you to define or redefine the values of vari- 
ables. For example, you might use the let com- 
mand to restart the page number count at a cer- 
tain point in your document. 

Word Juggler does have a drawback — 
namely, that what you see on-screen is not the 
same as what you'll get in your printed copy. 
When text is entered, it is always displayed 
starting from the far left edge of the screen and 
going to the far right edge. Special commands 
to control printing are embedded in the text it- 
self; these, of course, will not appear in the final 
copy. You can display a copy of what the docu- 
ment will look like when printed out, but while 
viewing this display, you can't do any editing. 
To edit, you must return to the edit mode. 

Word Juggler permits you to insert text files 
created by other Apple III programs (most no- 
tably VisiCalc and PFS) into any Word Juggler 
document. This is relatively easy to do and is an 
especially useful ability to have. On a 128K ma- 
chine, a single document can contain about 799 
lines of text (on a 256K machine, this jumps to 
1,536 lines). A newly formatted disk can hold 
approximately 1,700 lines of text. 

Another interesting option allows you to 
type at the Apple III keyboard and have the re- 
sults print directly on the printer. This feature is 
easy to use and offers some options not nor- 
mally found in the typical word processor. 

Quark also offers a variety of "accessories" 
(available for an additional charge) to enhance 
Word Juggler's capacities. A mail list manager 
allows you to interface with Apple's Mail List 
Manager. (A limited hsting capacity is included 
with the main program, but it is not nearly as 
powerful as the Apple version). Lexicheck is a 
spelling checker with a thirty-thousand word 
dictionary. It scans documents at a rate of ten 
thousand words per minute. Legal Dictionary 
adds eight thousand legal terms to Lexicheck. 
The program Typeface allows you to interface 
Word Juggler with computerized typesetting 
equipment. And Discourse is a software spool- 
er that permits you to use your Apple III while 
the printing process is taking place. 

All in all. Word Juggler is easy to use and 
can be learned quickly. The extra efforts to 
make this package emulate the best standalone 
word processors certainly stand out; it per- 
forms all the functions of more sophisticated 
systems. The documentation is well done, thor- 
ough, and easy to refer to. It's obvious that 
much care was taken with the design of this 
package. Users should appreciate that.

Exploring Business Basic, Part 21 

Two quick announcements before we begin are appropriate. First, 
the long-awaited SOS Reference Manual and Device Drivers Writer's 
Guide came off the presses in April and should have reached the far 
corners of the earth by now. They are an incredible wealth of informa- 
tion about how your favorite machine really works. If anybody you 
know thinks SOS isn't the best single user operating system around, 
show him a copy. 

The second announcement is a great one for those of you who read 
this article wistfully, because you have an Apple II and keep wondering 
what all the fuss is about concerning the Apple III, or because you need 
another Apple III for your business. Apple dropped the price of a 256K 
Apple III in April to $2,695. That's a full $1,600 less than this time 
last year. 

And Now, Back to Our Regularly Scheduled Program. As was 

mentioned last time, this article is the last in a series exploring the text 
and bit-map modes of graphics on the Apple III. We've covered a great 
deal in the last three months, from simple character set and shape defini- 
tions to character-set-animation effects (even including a game) and fi- 
nally to color bit-mapped graphics with Business Basic's own brand of 
animation. This installment will be the last in the graphics series (at least 
for now) and will cover a combination of the two worlds, text and the 
bit-mapped graphics display. 

Farewell, Faithful Bgraf.inv. Those of you who have been following 
these articles for some time may be a bit confused by the last sentence in 
the paragraph above. "I know how to do text on the graphics screen," 
you say; "just open the grafix driver and print characters to it like any 
other driver." Right as rain, but what does that have to do with the 
graphics invokable in Business Basic? 

If you carefully read the sections in your Basic manual on the Bgraf 
invokable module, and the section in the Standard Device Drivers Man- 
ual on the .grafix driver, you'll notice that the printing of text characters 
on the graphics screen is handled by the DrawBlock function of the driv- 
er, writing out the bit patterns of each character from the currently de- 
fined character set (normally the set used by the .console driver). By 
using the Bgraf module, it is possible to assign a new character set to be 
used by DrawBlock. It is also possible to use the Drawlmage function of 
the module to draw any shape (including text characters) onto the graph- 
ics screen. In the last two articles in this series we've been dealing with 
Drawlmage's shape-drawing ability in order to fill our screen with crea- 
tures of various shapes that have crawled their way into our hearts. The 
marriage of the Drawlmage flexibility with a text character set presents 
some interesting possibilities, among which is the ability to dress up the 
appearance of text on-screen. It is on this intriguing capability that our fi- 
nal discussion of the Bgraf invokable module will rest. 

Beauty in "Proportion" to Its Cost. By now many of you have 
probably looked at a photograph, if not an actual demo, of Apple's new 
Lisa system. One thing that immediately strikes people is how pleasing 
the display looks. When you analyze it, it's not only the hi-res display but 
the fact that the characters are pleasingly arranged on the screen, more 
like text found in a magazine or book than that found on a computer 



P o h I m a n 

terminal. The fundamental difference in the display modes is that all text 
on the Lisa screen is proportionally spaced — that is, each character is 
placed so that there's a minimal space between each pair of characters. In 
normal computer printouts and screen displays, each character occupies 
the same amount of space as every other character. 

It's easy to see that the characters i and 1 don't take up nearly as 
much room as M and X, yet in standard computer output they do, in or- 
der that all columns will automatically line up properly and that editing 
can be simplified. Such constant spacing techniques are called mono- 
spacing, and for certain things, like columns of numbers, they are really 
important. For ordinary text, however, monospadng is not only less nat- 
ural and attractive, it wastes space as well. Several word processors for 
the Apple II use the hi-res-graphics mode to create character sets. These 
programs allow up to seventy characters across a screen that ordinarily 
can accommodate only forty standard text characters. We will learn in 
this article that the higher resolution of the Apple III allows us to get 
over one hundred characters across the screen, with no sacrifice in 
readability! 

Beauty on a Budget. This month's program allows you to play with 
the concepts of proportional spacing and text font appearance from 
within a program that works like a hi-res screen editor for text. The edi- 
tor program permits you to place either proportional or monospaced 
text anywhere on-screen, use multiple fonts on the same screen, and 
use the graphics driver "transfer-mode" feature to do such things as 
overstrikes and erasures. The best feature of the program, however, is 
that it contains many routines you can use to create your own hi-res dis- 
plays, both with the currently available fonts and any of your own de- 
sign. Remember that with Bgraf and the .grafix driver you can have in- 
dividual characters that are much larger than the normal seven-by-eight 
character-cell definition. The program deals with normal-size character 
fonts, but we'll discuss easy modifications that are possible if you want to 
use your own nonstandard sizes. There's plenty to cover, so let's go. . . .

25 GOSUB 4000 

The first section sets up our arrays and goes to the subroutine at 4000 
to load up tables and do other initialization. For those of you who have 
been following this series, the arrays char, cset, lookup, and flip should 
be familiar. Char contains the character set of our choice and is defined 
as being 128 bytes wide by eight rows high — enough to contain the 128 
ASCII character definitions in a standard font (which is eight by eight 
pixels per character), with the rightmost pixel column used for defining 
flash in inverse text mode (seven by eight displayable). Those of you who 
read the documentation will notice that a .bgraf character set can actual- 
ly contain 256 character definitions, but the standard system fonts are 
limited to 128, so that's what we'll go with for now. Cset contains the 
actual image of a system font file, as read in by the download.inv invok- 
able module. We'll look at a conversion routine that transforms fonts in 
the system format into character-set definitions that Bgraf can operate 



JUNE 1983 



on. Lx)okup and flip are used to accomplish this transformation quickly. 

Which brings us to the cstart and clen arrays. Their size of 128 ele- 
ments each should be a clue that each element contains information 
about the respective character associated with the element number, and 
the names should be a clue as to what that information is. The charac- 
ters in a normal character set are stored in blocks one byte wide in the 
char array, but since we want to do proportional spacing, it is necessary 
to define for each character cell just how much of the character in it we 
want to display. In this program, that is accomplished by defining the 
starting pixel row within the character cell to start the display, as well as 
the number of pixel rows to display from that point. Let's look at the ini- 
tialization section, where this will become more clear 

4000 REM initialize 

4025 DATA 0,8,4,12,2,10,6,14,1,9,5,13,3,11,7,15 
4045 FOR i = 0 TO 15:READ looi<up(i):NEXT 
4055 v256 = 256:v512 = 512:v128 = 128:v16=16 
4060 FOR 1=0 TO 255:a$ = HEX$(i):flip(i)=v16*lookup(TEN(MID$ 
(a$,4,1))) + lool<up(TEN(MID$(a$,3,1))):NEXT 

The section from line 4000 through line 4060 is identical to routines 
in previous programs. It creates the flip array, which is simply a lookup 
table of all the possible combinations of the value of a byte of data (256 
in all), with their values as if the bits in the byte were exactly reversed — 
that is, flipped over. This table is required by the routine that transforms 
a character set from system font format to .grafix format. Apple cleverly 
made these two formats the exact reverse of each other. Next comes 
more initialization of variables: 

4070 name$="Font":array$="cset%":size% = 1024 

4085 ctrl$=CHR$(8)+CHR$(21)+CHR$(1 1)+CHR$(10) + 

CHR$(13)+CHR$(27) 
4090 left=0:rigtit = 559:top= 191 :bot= 18:cvert= 191 :cliorz= 

0:delay= 1 :noset= 1 
4100 lispace = 7:vspace =8: reverse =0 
4110 bell$=CHR$(7):eras$(0)="Replace":eras$(1) = 

"Overlay":eras$(2) = "Invert" 
4120 eras$(3)="Erase ":prop$(0)="Monospace " 
:prop$(1)="Proportionar' 

Several variables are worthy of note. First, in line 4085 a string is buih of 
command characters that will be used later for fast lookup by the editor 
command routine. In order, the characters are back arrow, forward ar- 
row, up arrow, down arrow, return, and escape. Line 4090 sets some ini- 
tial constraints for the area that may be edited and sets the initial posi- 
tion of the cursor to 0,191 (chorz and evert). Line 4100 sets the default 
for horizontal and vertical character spacing. These are values you would 
want to change if you used other, nonstandard character sets. Next 
comes a big table that will be a challenge to type in: 

4200 DATA 3,4,3,2,2,4,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,3,2 

4205 DATA 1,4,3,4,1,6,1,6,2,3,2,5,3,2,1,6 

4210 DATA 1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6 

4215 DATA 1,6,1,6,3,2,2,3,1,5,2,5,2,5,1,6 

4220 DATA 1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6 

4225 DATA 1,6,2,4,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6 

4230 DATA 1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6

4240 DATA 2,4,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6 

4245 DATA 1,6,2,4,1,5,1,6,2,4,1,6,1,6,1,6 

4250 DATA 1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6 

4255 DATA 1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,2,3,1,6,1,6,0,7 

4300 FOR i=32 TO 127:READ cstart%(i),clen%(i):NEXT 

4500 RETURN 

Notice that there are eight sets of two values on each line and that 
there are twelve lines, for a total of ninety-six sets of values — one for each 
of the displayable characters in a font definition. To save trouble and im- 
prove performance, we have not bothered to make the control character 
definitions displayable, so the characters from 32 (space) through 127 
(delete) are the only ones defined. Note that most characters seem to fol- 
low the pattern 1 ,6; this indicates that the program should start one pixel 
over in the character definition and use the next six pixels. This is be- 
cause a large number of characters in the standard set are five pixels 
wide, and we need one pixel for spacing. For consistency, we always steal 
the extra pixel from the leading edge of the character, leaving the spac- 
ing pixel at the end. This does mean, however, that we save at least one 
pixel per character, which for eighty characters across on a normal screen

is eighty pixels, or the equivalent of an extra thirteen characters from that 
technique alone. Six-wide monospacing thus buys the ability to write 
ninety-three characters across the screen, which, depending on the num- 
ber of i's and I's and other skinny characters that are used, may increase 
the total considerably. An example would help; see the accompanying 
figure. 

Notice that the new A is obtained by simply shaving off the first col- 
umn, which makes our starting-pixel, character-width pair 1,6. As to the 
lower-case i, the formula is 2,4, since we are to skip the first two pixel col- 
ums and then use only four to draw the character. 

In any case, the table presented in lines 42(X) through 4255 will define 
the slim new format for all the characters in the font we'll be using. Note 
that this definition is for the Standard font. Several other fonts come with 
the Business Basic disk, such as Roman and Apple. These fonts contain 
characters designed a little differently than those of the Standard font, so 
you should construct a different table for those characters. 

Having beaten initialization to death, let's get on with the show:

IF NOT op THEN 50:ELSE op= INT((op+ 1)/2)-1 

fill = op*15:pen=( NOT op)*15 

erasenum= 2+4* op 



Because we'll be dealing with fonts as well as the .grafix driver, we'll 
invoke the three modules listed in line 30, all of which are found on the 
Business Basic master disk. Then the graphics driver is opened, allowing 
us a path to print text commands on the graphics screen and perform 
other functions. 

Lines 50 through 75 then ask whether the screen is to be displayed in 
normal mode (white characters on a black background) or inverse mode 
(just the opposite). Notice the use of the instr statement and the calcula- 
tions in lines 60 and 65 to check for mismatches and then set op to 0 or 1 
for normal or inverse. This causes line 70 to set fill and pen to either 0 
and 15 or 15 and 0, depending on the value of op. An if statement would 
work just as easily, but practice in logical value calculations can't hurt. 

The variable erasenum in line 75 is used to define what transfer op- 
tion is appropriate to use to draw the cursor so that it doesn't interfere 
with the text on-screen. If the pencolor is 0 (black), then transfer option 
2, invert, is used. If the pencolor is 15 (white), then option 6 is used, in- 
verse invert. More detail on how these transfer options work will be 
found later. Next comes more initialization: 

100 PERFORM initgrafix 
105 PERFORM grafixmode(%2,%1) 
110 PERFORM fillcolor(%fill):PERFORM pencolor(%pen) 
115 HOME:PRINT:PRINT"lnitializing the graphics screen, please 
wait." 

120 erase = 0:prop= 1 
130 GOSUB 3600 

In line 105 the program sets mode 2, the 560-by-192 mode, and line 
1 10 uses the previously defined fill and pencolor variables. Line 120 sets 
the initial values for erase, which defines the transfer option used to write 
characters on-screen, and prop, which defines whether proportional or 
monospaced character writing will be performed. Then the subroutine at 
line 3600 is called to set up the screen:

3600 PERFORM viewport(%0,%559,%0,%191):PERFORM fillport 
3620 PERFORM moveto(%0,%9): PERFORM linerel(%559,%0) 
3630 PERFORM moveto(%41 2,%9):PERFORM linerel(%0,%-9) 
3640 IF reverse THEN RETURN 

3650 warn= 1:message$ = eras$(erase)+" "+prop$(prop):GOSUB 

3100 
3660 RETURN 

Lines 3600 through 3630 clear the screen to the current fill color and 
then create a message area in the bottom ten lines of the screen. If re- 
verse is on (more on that later), then the operation is finished. Other- 
wise, the subroutine at line 3100 is called to write the current state of the 
transfer option and the spacing mode: 

3100 PERFORM xfroption(%0) 
3105 GOSUB 3500 

3110 PERFORM moveto(%7 + 412*warn,%7):PRINT#1 ;message$; 
3120 IF NOT warn THEN FOR 1=1 TO 750*delay:NEXT 
3125 PERFORM xfroption(%( NOT( NOT erase))*(erasenum-2+ 
erase)) 

3130 IF NOT warn THEN GOSUB 3500:ELSE:warn =0 
3135 RETURN 

3500 PERFORM viewport(%5+408*warn,%41 1 + 148*warn,%0, 

%8):PERF0RM fillport 
3510 PERFORM viewport(%,%559,%0,%191) 
3520 RETURN 

These subroutines give the program a general-purpose ability to write 
messages to the user on the bottom of the screen. Line 3100 first sets 
transfer option 0, called replace, which will overwrite any message cur- 
rently in the message area. Then subroutine 3500 is called to clear the ap- 
propriate part of the message area. If warn mode is on, then the message 
is written from horizontal positions 413 through 559, between rows 0 and 
8 on the screen (the lower right-hand corner). If warn is zero, then the 
message is written between positions 5 and 411. These techniques can be 
used to establish several message windows if necessary, each using the 
same routines. 

Line 31 10 then moves to the appropriate place on-screen and writes 
the message in messageS. Messages in the warning window remain until 
changed by another message, but if the regular message window is used 
the program will pause briefly (line 3120) and then set the transfer mode 
back to its original state, calling line 3500 to clear the window. 

Back Home from the Subroutines. Now that the program has set up 
the screen and the default modes are established, we turn on the screen 
and start using the program: 

150 PERFORM grafixon 

155 message$ = "High Resolution Screen Editor":GOSUB 3100 
160 GOSUB 1400 

165 IF fin=2 THEN 1000:ELSE IF fin AND noset THEN 1000 
170 GOSUB 3500 

After putting an identifying message on the bottom of the screen, the 
previous section uses the subroutine at line 1400 to load the character 
font that will be used to write on the screen. That routine starts like this: 

1400 prompt$=name$ + " pathname: " 
1425 GOSUB 3000:IF fin THEN RETURN 

This font subroutine first prompts for the pathname of the font file 
by using the variable prompts and the hi-res input routine at line 30(X) 
(more on that routine later). The variable fin in line 1425 is used to indi- 
cate a nonstandard exit from input, such as pressing escape or a carriage 
return at the beginning of the input. In any case, the font name, if any, is 
returned in the variable iineS. A quick look at the input routine is appro- 
priate now (are you beginning to feel like the Apple III itself, plunging 
deep into subroutines again?): 

3000 PERFORM xfroption(%0) 

3005 GOSUB 3500:PERFORM nnoveto(%7,%7):PRINT#1;prompt$; 

3010 line$ = "":fin=0 

3015 GET a$:a = ASC(a$):IF a<32 THEN 3030 

3020 IF LEN(line$)<40 THEN PRINT#1 ;a$;:line$ =line$ + 

a$:ELSE: PRINT bell$; 

3025 GOTO 3015 

3030 IF a= 13 THEN fin = (LEN(line$) = 0):GOSUB 3500:GOTO 3070 

3035 IF 8=27 THEN fin = 2:G0SUB 3500:GOTO 3070 

3040 IF a=24 THEN PRINT bell$;:GOTO 3005 

3045 IF a< >8 THEN 3015 



3050 IF LEN(line$) = 0 THEN 3015 

3055 PERFORM moverel(%-7,%0):PRINT#1;" ";:PERFORM 

moverel(%-7,%0) 
3060 line$ = MID$(line$,1,LEN(line$)-1) 
3065 GOTO 3015 

3070 PERFORM xfroption(%( NOT( NOT erase))* 

(erasenum-2+erase)) 
3075 RETURN 

The previous routine is very similar to others in this column that ac- 
cept input while on the hi-res screen. It supports typing in characters and 
erasing input with the back arrow. In addition, a check is made in line 
3020 to be sure that the input doesn't overflow past forty characters and 
thus into the next message window. If everything's okay, the character is 
added to lineS, and the routine loops back up to get the next character. 

Control character processing, including back-arrow erasing, is han- 
dled in lines 3030 through 3065. Backing up is a matter of moving the 
cursor location back one space, printing a blank, and then moving back 
to accept the new character. In addition, line 3060 removes the previous 
character from the end of lineS and then loops back to get the next char- 
acter. Lines 3030 through 3040 handle special character exits from the 
routine. A carriage return exits with fin set to 0 if there are characters in 
lineS or set to 1 if the string is null. A value of 2 for fin indicates that 
escape has been pressed, and a control-X erases the input line, just as it 
does in Basic, except that the prompt is redisplayed. In all, this is a use- 
ful routine that could easily be adapted for use anywhere on the screen. 

Now that we have a general way to get input and to check for cer- 
tain characters like escape, we can continue our look at the font request 
routine: 

1435 ON ERR GOTO 1460 

1440 font$=CHR$(34)+line$+CHR$(34):PERFORM 

getfont(@font$,@array$) 
1445 OFF ERR:GOSUB 2000 

1450 message! = name$ + " loaded. ":GOSUB 3100:GOSUB 2100 
1455 RETURN 

This routine first sets up an on error jump to line 1460 and then tries 
to use the getfont procedure from the download.inv module to load a 
font from the file specified in lineS. If anything goes wrong — for exam- 
ple, the file specified is not a font file — then a jump is made to the error 
routine: 

1460 ON ERR GOTO 1490 
1465 0PEN#3,line$ 

1470 PERFORM filread(%3,@array$,%size%,@ret%) 
1475 OFF ERR:GL0SE#3 

1480 IF ret%=size% THEN GOSUB 2000:GOTO 1450 
1485 messages = name$ + " in "+line$ + " is invalid. ":GOSUB 3100: 
GOTO 1400 

1490 message$ = "Not a " + name$ + " file.":GOSUB 3100 
1495 OFF ERR:IF TYP{3)=0 THEN CL0SE#3:DELETE 

line$:ELSE:CL0SE#3 
1500 GOTO 1400 

The routine at 1460 attempts to open the file as a Basic file, and use 
the filread procedure from request.inv to read a font definition array. 
This might be the case if you used the Character and Shape Editor from a 
previous article, or some other means to get a font definition into a file 
without being able to change the file type to FONT. If something goes 
wrong this time, then the appropriate error message is displayed, either in 
line 1485 (if the file could be opened and read from but contained wrong 
information) or line 1490 (if there was trouble opening or reading the 
file). The typ function in line 1495 serves to check if the file is blank be- 
cause the original open caused it to be created. If so, it is deleted and con- 
trol goes back to the beginning to ask for the file name again. 

In the event that the file name is correct and the program can read a 
font from it, a subroutine at line 2000 is called to prepare the font for use 
by the program (ever deeper into the routine abyss): 

2000 messages = "Preparing the character font.":GOSUB 3100 
2010 FOR k = 0 TO 51 1 :b$ = HEX$(cset%(k)):cset%(k) = 

TEN(HEX${v256*flip(TEN(MID$(b$,1,2))) + 

flip(TEN(MID$(b$,3,2))))):NEXT 
2020 RETURN 

This routine has also been seen in previous episodes, since the stan- 
dard system-font definitions used by text mode are exactly the reverse 



JUNE 1983

(on a character basis) from those of the hi-res Drawblock fonts. Line 2010 
uses the flip array to define all possible byte values and their correspond- 
ing reversed values. The routine is compacted on one line for maximum 
performance. Now that the font is flipped, it is necessary to expand it 
from the single-dimensioned array cset% to a form more readily usable 
by Drawimage: 

2100 message$="Transferring Font format to Character set 

format":GOSUB 3100 
2105 FOR k= 16 TO 63:j=8*k-1 

2110 FOR i = 0 TO 7 STEP 2:j = j+ 1 :a$ = HEX$(cset%(j)):b$ = 

HEX$(cset%{j + 4)) 
2115 char%(k,i) = TEN(MID$(a$,1,2) + MID$(b$,1,2)) 
2120 char%(k,i+1) = TEN(MID$(a$,3,2)+MID$(b$,3,2)) 
2125 NEXT:NEXT 

2140 message$ = "Font format transferred":GOSUB 3100:GOSUB 

3500 
2150 noset=0 
2160 RETURN 

Note in the prior routine that we are unpacking cset% into a simple 
row-and-column format in the array char%, where rows represent rows 
of bits and columns represent character definitions, two per integer 
value. More information on this format can be found in previous ar- 
ticles in this series, as well as in the Business Basic manual, volume 2, un- 
der the discussion of the Bgraf invokable. Note also that you could speed 
up this process considerably by prestoring a font definition in a file as a 
character set array in the char% format. That would require modifica- 
tion of the subroutine at 1400, which reads in the array, but would allow 
quick switching of fonts without the complicated preparation routines. 

Now for Something Completely Useful. Those of you who've been 
following along with our nested subroutine calls will now realize that 
we're back to the main routine, with a font definition loaded in the 
char% array. That brings us to the interesting stuff actually putting some 
of these characters on-screen using the proportional spacing tables. Our 
first step is to put a cursor on-screen to indicate where the character will 
be written: 

200 PERFORM xfroption(%erasenum) 
205 PERFORM moveto(%chorz,%cvert) 

210 PERFORM drawimage(@char%(0,0),%v128,%995,%0,%1, 

%vspace) 
215 GET a$ 

220 PERFORM drawimage(@char%(0,0),%v128,%995,%0,%1, 
%vspace) 

First we set the transfer option for invert, allowing the cursor to over- 
write information on-screen by turning black to white and white to 
black. Line 205 positions the cursor to the current horizontal and verti- 
cal value, and line 210 writes the cursor on-screen using the Drawimage 
routine. This statement draws a vertical bar of bits from the char% ar- 
ray, which is one pixel wide and eight pixels (vspace) high starting at bit 
location 995 in the character set. It happens that 995 is the location in the 
standard character font of the vertical-bar character (ASCII 124). By 
multiplying 124 by 8 (the width of a character definition) and adding 3 
for the offset within the cell for the bar, we obtain 995. Thus our cursor 
consists of a vertical bar at the extreme left-hand edge of the current 
character cell. This is a convenient definition of a proportional cursor, 
since we will be writing characters with many different widths, and we 
would like to know exactly where the character will be placed. If you use 
different fonts, you may well want to define another character position to 
contain this cursor character and change the values in lines 210 and 220. 

In line 215 we get a character from the keyboard and immediately 
print the cursor again — exactly on top of the previous one. Since we are 
in invert mode on the transfer option, this second printing of the cursor 
simply changes everything back to its original state. 

Now it's time to put this typed character on-screen: 

225 PERFORM xfroption(%( NOT( NOT erase))* 

(erasenum-2+erase)) 
230 key=ASC(a$):skp= 1:IF key<32 OR key>127 THEN 270 
240 IF prop THEN hspace = clen%(key):xskip= key*8 + 

cstart%(key): ELSE:hspace = 7:xskip= key*8 
245 IF right<chorz+hspace THEN PRINT bell$;:GOTO 200 
250 PERFORM drawimage(@char%(0,0),%v128,%xskip,%0,' 

%hspaGe,%vspace) 
255 chorz=chorz+hspace 



260 GOTO 200 

Notice that first we put the screen back into whatever transfer mode 
was selected and then set key equal to the ASCII value of the typed char- 
acter. A check is made to see if the character is a control character or if 
open-apple was pressed along with the character (key > 127). If not, then 
it's a printing character, which is to be put on-screen. Line 240 sets 
hspace and xskip based on whether proportional or monospace mode is 
being used. Hspace indicates how wide the character is to be written — 
seven pixels wide if monospace or the value in clen% if proportional. 
Xskip is the offset in the char% array and the point at which to start the 
transfer of the character. It's always the character code times 8 for mono- 
space, with the additional value cstart% if proportional. Once the cor- 
rect values are computed, a check is made to see if the result will go past 
the right edge of the window defined by right. If everything is okay, the 
character is written by line 250 and the current horizontal position is up- 
dated. Then a loop back to the beginning is done to redisplay the cursor 
and start the process over. 

As was mentioned earlier, control and other special characters are 
handled by the routine at line 270: 

270 IF key=27 THEN 400 

275 IF key>127 THEN skp=0:key= key-128 

280 kvl=INSTR(ctrl$,CHR$(key)) 

285 -ON kvl GOTO 340,350,360,370,380,160 

290 GOTO 200 

340 hmove=cfiorz-skp*(hspace- 1)- 1 :IF left< = hmove THEN 

chorz=hmove 
345 GOTO 200 

350 hmove=chiorz+skp*(hspace-1) + 1:IF right>=hmove THEN 

chorz=hmove 
355 GOTO 200 

360 vmove=cvert+skp*(vspace-1) + 1:IF top>=vmove THEN 

cvert = vmove 
365 GOTO 200 

370 vmove=cvert-skp*(vspace- 1)- 1 :IF bot<=vmove THEN 

cvert=vmove 
375 GOTO 200 
380 ctiorz = 0 

385 IF bot< = cvert-vspace THEN PRINT#1;CHR$(10);:cvert =

cvert-vspace 
390 GOTO 200 

First a check is made in line 270 to see if the character typed was an 
escape. If so, an immediate jump is made to line 400 to do processing of 
commands. If not, a check is made for open-apple in line 275; if so, the 
skip flag is set to 0, indicating that cursor positioning is to be done in 
one-pixel increments. The character typed is then checked against values 
in rtrlS, which was defined a while back on line 4085. Let's reproduce it 
for quick study 

4085 ctrl$=CHR$(8)+GHR$(21)+CHR$(1 1)+CHR$(10) + 
CHR$(13)+CHR$(27) 

The first four characters represent the cursor arrows back, forward, 
up, and down. The fifth is the carriage return and the sixth is escape. 
Since we have already checked once for escape in line 270, escape can be 
detected only at line 280 if it was open-apple escape. Similarly, the open- 
apple key can be used with the cursor keys to signal single-pixel or nor- 
mal movement in a given direction. This also allows us to define addi- 
tional commands, either control characters or printing characters with 
open-apple on, to implement other features in the program. The rou- 
tines themselves from 340 to 390 are pretty straightforward. Cursor 
movements are first checked against the left, right, top, and bot limits, 
and then the cursor position is updated. Remember that when the pro- 
gram redraws the cursor it first positions it to the current values of chorz 
and evert in line 200, which means there is no need to redraw the cursor 
in these routines. 

Next let's look at the routines at line 400, which processes requests 
for command and mode settings: 

400 prompts ="Proportional or Monospace characters: ":GOSUB 
3000 

405 GOSUB 3500:IF fin = 2 THEN 200:ELSE IF fin THEN 425 
410 a$ = MID${line$,1,1):a = INSTRC'PpMm",a$):IF a THEN 

a=INT((a+1)/2) 
415 ON a GOSUB 520,530 

420 messages =eras$(erase)+" " + prop$(prop):warn = 1:G0SUB 
3100 

520 prop= 1:hspace = 6:RETURN 
530 prop=0:hspace=7:RETURN 

The request is made in line 400, and a is given the value 0 (mis- 
match), 1 (if proportional), or 2 (if monospace). The subroutine sets the 
appropriate flag and the default spacing to be used. Then line 420 takes 
care of writing the latest status in the warning window. 

Next, the transfer option value is requested: 

425 prompt$ = "Replace, Overlay, Invert, or Erase mode: ":GOSUB 
3000 

430 GOSUB 3500:IF fin = 2 THEN 200:ELSE IF fin THEN 450 
435 a$ = MID$(line$,1,1):a = INSTRC'RrOaliEe",a$):IF a THEN 

a=INT((a+ 1)/2) 
440 ON a GOSUB 500,505,510,515 

445 messages =eras$(erase)+" "+prop$(prop):warn= 1:G0SUB 
3100 

500 erase = 0:RETURN 
505 erase=1:RETURN 
510 erase = 2:RETURN 
515 erase = 3:RETURN 

The settings of replace, overlay, invert, or erase correspond to the de- 
scriptions in the Business Basic manual on the xfroption routine of 
Bgraf. Remember that the actual transfer-option value used will depend 
on whether the screen is in inverse or normal mode. The routines at lines 
500 through 515 may look too simple to make into subroutines, but us- 
ing this structure allows you to easily add enhancements to the options. 
Now, on with more commands: 

450 prompt$ = "Normal, Inverse, Clear, or Reverse: ":GOSUB 3000 

455 GOSUB 3500:IF fin THEN 200:ELSE:a$ = MID$(line$,1,1) 

460 a=INSTR("NnliCcRr",a$):IF a THEN a = INT((a+ 1)/2) 

465 ON a GOSUB 540,560,580,590 

470 GOTO 200 

540 fill = 0:pen= 15:erasenum= 2 

550 GOTO 565 

560 fill= 15:pen= 0:erasenum= 6 



565 PERFORM fillcolor(%fill):PERFORM pencolor(%pen) 
570 RETURN 
580 GOSUB 3600 
585 RETURN 
590 reverse=1 

595 SWAP pen,fill:PERFORM pencolor(%pen):PERFORM 
fillcolor(%fill) 

600 PERFORM xfroption(%erasenum):GOSUB 3600 
610 IF erasenum=2 THEN erasenum=6:ELSE erasenum=2 
615 reverse = 0 
620 RETURN 

The same structure is used to get command values, but this time the 
command implementation is a bit more complicated. The inverse and 
normal commands are handled in lines 540 through 570 by setting the 
appropriate values of fill and pen colors and then using the Bgraf rou- 
tines to pass those values to the driver. Clear simply calls the saeen set- 
up routine at line 3600 to redisplay everything and, in the process, erase 
everything on the current screen. 

The reverse command in lines 590 through 620 works by changing 
the pen and fill colors, then setting invert mode (which changes white to 
black and black to white), and clearing the saeen with the same subrou- 
tine at 3600 that was used to erase the screen in the previous command. 
The result is really nice to watch, as a curtain rolls down the screen, in- 
verting everything it encounters. Think how tough that would be to do if 
you had to examine every pixel yourself and decide what to do. 

Farewell to the Fun Stuff. Well, that about wraps up the commands 
to implement and the main routine that displays the characters in the 
various modes. Now it's time to wrap up the program with the routine at 
line 1000: 

1000 REM clean up and go home 

1005 prompt$ = "Ouit the Screen Editor? (Y to confirm): " 
1010 GOSUB 3000 

1015 IF NOT INSTR("Yy",iine$) THEN GOTO 170 
1020 HOME:TEXT 

1025 PERFORM release:PERFORM release:PERFORM release 
1030 INVOKE 
1035 CLOSE 
1040 END 

That's it! Have fun experimenting with the various modes. Especial- 
ly try to type a line of proportional text and then a line of the same text in 
monospace below it. You'll find that an average of 20 to 30 percent more 
characters per line can be written while still being extremely easy (and 
some would say, more pleasant) to read. Be sure also to try the effect of 
the various transfer options on your ability to write to the screen. Since 
you can position the cursor to exact pixel locations, you can also have 
fun with superscripts, subscripts, underlining, boldfacing, and other ef- 
fects. In addition, be sure to try other character fonts, like Roman and 
Apple. The proportional-mode table will not work exactly right, but will 
do well enough to show the effect. 

What's Next. This program is one of those that you could almost in- 
finitely enhance. One immediate thought is that you will want to use 
gsave and gload to store and retrieve your screen images, especially if you 
ha<'e a program to print screen images to a printer. This will allow you to 
make copies of your edited screens. You'll probably want to clear the 
message line before saving the screen, however. 

Other suggestions would include the ability to store several fonts in 
memory at once, switching quickly between them for various effects. 
You would also have to store proportion tables for each one. If you have 
a font editor, you may want to create a special proportional-font defini- 
tion, with narrower characters than those found in the standard font. 
This would enable you to put many more than the 100 characters across 
the screen possible with the regular fonts. Another use would be to mod- 
ify the character definitions to allow larger-than-normal fonts for such 
things as gothic, shadow, and other uses. 

With enough work the program could be a general screen-design 
package, with the line and circle editor from article 8, combined with 
the general character capabilities of this article. 

As you can see, programming, like papers on a desktop or appoint- 
ments in a day, has the ability to expand infinitely to fill up any available 
space and time. Use yours wisely, and come back next time for some new 
challenges. W

Southern California has always been 
a leader in high-technology industries as 
both a producer and a consumer, so it 
was only fitting that Applefest finally 
made its way there in its third year, 
pausing for three days in Anaheim. 

So many thousands of attendees 
prowled the premises that Anaheim '83 
immediately became the third biggest 
Applefest in history — following only last 
year's Boston and San Francisco shows. 
The opening day, first-hour crowd was 
so large that it became unruly while 
waiting to be processed into the Ana- 
heim Convention Center. Not only were 
lots of folks in attendance, but they 




came with their buying pants on. Exhib- 
itors with products to sell found little 
resistance to their importunities. 

Apple had Lisa there for demon- 
stration, and she drew mighty throngs. 
Apple's hands-on booths for the Apple 
He and the Apple III were also pop- 
ular. 

The seminar sessions seemed well 
attended and most folks seemed to get 
their money's worth. The headliner on 
Sunday was Steve Wozniak, answering 
almost every question thrown at him. 
Overall, seminar subjects ran the gamut 
from advice to the noncomputer owner 
through very sophisticated tips for the 




most knowledgeable Apple veterans. 

Most of the niftiest new products 
were hardware-based. It seems that the 
creative block plaguing software writers 
has not yet extended to the hardware 
makers. 

New software was mainly specialized 
in nature: programs to help the sports 
bettor, to solve specialized accounting 
functions, to address investor require- 
ments, or to create graphics. 

Applefest moved on to Boston last 
month, with another West Coast appear- 
ance planned for San Francisco in 
October. From all indications, it should 
be a big one.

SOCIETY CHANGES AS COMPUTERS 
MOVE AND GAMES GATHER DUST 



The recent publication of Fortune maga- 
zine's list of the 500 largest industrial compa- 
nies underscores the changing nature of 
America's economy. 

It's become fashionable to call the eco- 
nomic metamorphosis either a move to a post- 
industrial society or a move to an informa- 
tion-based economy. But whatever name is 
put to the shift in industrial emphasis, one 
thing stands out: The technology companies 
are growing at a relatively faster rate today 
than companies in more traditional industry 
groups. That trend implies an accelerated rate 
of change toward a new economic base. 

No matter how you sort out the industrial 



groups, computers and allied technological 
companies were the only group among the 
Fortune 500 that uniformly advanced in the 
rankings. Nary a single company that could 
reasonably fall into that category failed to rise 
at least two positions on the list. Understand 
that such an assertion omits companies whose 
major technological market is aerospace. 

What we've culled are those computer- 
technology companies with primarily com- 
mercial civilian customers. And those compa- 
nies are uniformly climbing up the ranks of 
Fortune'?, 500.

FEDERAL AGENCY 
TO OPEN D.C. 
COMPUTER STORE 

The federal government's office supply 
sergeant, the General Service Administration 
(GSA), hopes to open a computer store this 
September. 

To be called the Information Product and 
Training Center — or something friendlier if 
they can think of it — the privately operated 
emporium will occupy three thousand square 
feet of the agency's headquarters building in 
Washington, D.C. 

GSA, which is currently evaluating ven- 
dor bids to run the business, made the un- 
precedented move in response to any unpre- 
cedented fact of contemporary life — the 
computer. 

"Microcomputers are forcing the private 
sector and government to rethink how they do 
business," notes GSA project manager Bill 
Frazer. "We have to try new techniques to get 
a handle on it, because the old techniques 
aren't working effectively." 

In the past twenty years, the federal gov- 
ernment has purchased eighteen thousand 
general-purpose computers — mainframe, mini, 
and micro, according to Frazer. But in the 
next seven years, it's estimated that Uncle Sam 
will procure five hundred thousand to one 
million units. Many of those will probably be 
microcomputers, earmarked for short-hand- 
ed managers who are under budget pressure 
to operate more efficiently. 

It is the agency's hope that the store will 
create excitement among these midlevel non- 
techies who need a convenient and friendly 
place to shop for business tools. "There's a 
great deal of inertia that prevents the end-user 
manager in government from getting the 
product he wants," says Frazer. Part of that is 
bound up with the mystique of the computer 
and computer stores, but it's also tied to the 
lingering suspicion among bureaucrats that 
government red tape will frustrate pur- 
chasers. 

Vendors bidding for the computer-store 
contract, therefore, are being evaluated not 
just on their ability to deliver a varied product 
line in machines and programs, says Frazer, 
but also on their willingness to hold a bureau- 
crat's hand. 

"With the procurement schedule we use 
now, when you buy something, you buy a 
piece of hardware," Frazer explains. "You 
don't necessarily get it all tied together — hard- 
ware, software, recommendations on what to 
buy, training, and ongoing maintenance. They 
all come from different places."

Explains Economics 



Four microcomputer games are installed 
in the lobby of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
San Francisco. Hundreds of people play them 
every day and learn something about money. 

The arcade-style games are part of an 
eight-thousand-square-foot permanent exhib- 
it called the World of Economics. Together 
with large murals, glass-cased displays, and 
twelve electronic exhibits, they give viewers an 
entertaining and educational understanding of 
economics. A total of twenty-seven displays 
are arranged in family groupings such as 
"money and markets" and "fluctuations and 
policy." 

The entire exhibit contains forty thousand 
words and is so packed with information that 
anyone assimilating all of it could pass the first 
two semesters of a college course in principles 
of economics, says Kent Sims, executive vice 
president of the bank. 

Sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank, 
the $2-million educational exhibit was as- 
sembled by Howard Lathrop & Associates, a 
Santa Monica, California-based design firm. 
It took three and a half years to complete. 
John Scadding, director of public informa- 




tion, was the bank's 
liaison on the project. 

Not surprisingly, the 
games are very popu- 
lar. "But I'm contin- 
ually surprised," says 
Scadding, "to see people standing around and 
reading parts of the display. We were warned 
not to use a lot of words and to keep it inter- 
active. I'm heartened to see people studying it 
quite intently." 

The four games run on Radio Shack mi- 
crocomputers. One is The Election Game, in 
which the player becomes President, juggling 
taxes and government spending in a valiant at- 
tempt to control inflation and deflation. 

Another one is The Monetary Policy 
Game. Here the player becomes chairman of 
the Federal Reserve Board, a job that de- 
mands juggling the country's money supply by 
buying and selling government securities. The 
object is to avoid inflation while at the same 
time staving off unemployment. 

Winning at the Policy game is as difficult 
as it is in real life. When executive vice presi- 
dent Sims played the game, it fired him as

employment ran amok. 

The Constraints Game is a shoot-'em-up 
that depicts the uncertainty faced by eco- 
nomic policy makers. A rocket-firing space- 
ship disappears — policy makers don't always 
have the information they need; ships fire with 
unpredictable force — policy makers can't rely 
totally on past experience; there are time lags 
between pressing the button and firing — 
policy makers don't know how long it will 
take for their decisions to affect the economy; 
and ships jerk uncontrollably — there is no ab- 
solute control of the economy. 

The game Muffin Mogul turns players in- 
to bakery shop owners. Controlling muffin 
prices based on cost of ingredients and the 
weather (more muffins are sold on sunny 
days) is a lesson in the principles of supply and 
demand. 

Two LED displays prompt viewers to 
push a button and see how the economy 
flows. Another display shows how dollar bills 
circulate in the economy. 

The exhibit came about as a result of San 
Francisco zoning laws, which require that 
buildings of a certain height offer something 
that contributes to pedestrian life of the street 
they're built on. "The fact that we're a Feder- 
al Reserve bank," says Scadding, "made us 
aware that we could show people what the 
Federal Reserve does." 

The Federal Reserve Bank decided to 
build an educational economy-oriented ex- 
hibit instead of the usual restaurant or flower 
shop. "Of course, we also decided we should 
make it fun, large, colorful, and exciting," he 
adds. 

School tours of the exhibit are being ar- 
ranged. And to help students and the general 
public through the maze of information, the 
Economic Literacy Council of California is 
developing printed directories. MF

Hollywood's Past Goes Color 

Computers Help 
Bring New Life 
To Old Films 



says he knows of no other comparable sys- 
tems for adding color. 

Earl Glick, chairman of the board at Hal 
Roach Studios, feels that network television, 
pay-TV, and home video-cassette players are 
all potential markets for the color-enhanced 
films. "Most of the major studios and net- 
works have shown an interest," says Glick. 

The process, which is fairly simple, in- 
volves a minicomputer for number-crunch- 
ing, a specialized image processor, and a com- 
puter operator who must stay alert. First, a 
film is transferred to video tape and broken 
down by scenes. Then the elements of each 



Glick intends eventually to color all the 
films in the Hal Roach film library. At the 
moment, the Laurel and Hardy classics, / Mil- 
lion B.C., and Topper are taking top priority. 
Glick believes that all black-and-white films 
would benefit from this process. 

"Black and white is not natural," Glick 
says. "We do not see in black and white; we 
see in color." Most old films were shot in 
black and white because color technology was 
not available, was not refined, or was too 
expensive. 

"It's all a matter of volume," says Mar- 

GOTO page 264, column 1 




The year is 1935. The scene on-screen is 
from a classic comedy short, The Fixer-Up- 
pers, starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. 
Typical of Laurel and Hardy films (even in the 
era of talking pictures), The Fixer-Uppers de- 
pends a lot on sight gags, Laurel's sneaky ex- 
pressions, and Hardy's pompous manner- 
isms. Now look again. 

It's 1983 and something strange is going 
on. In a new version of The Fixer-Uppers, 
Laurel is wearing a brown suit and blue hat 
while Hardy sports green gloves and a dark 
blue suit. What makes this strange is that The 
Fixer-Uppers was originally filmed in black 
and white. 

Laurel and Hardy films are the first from 
the Hal Roach Studios film library to be con- 
verted from black-and-white film to color 
video tape. Ever since the early days of one- 
color tinting and three-strip technicolor, the 
film industry has labored mightily to bring 
color to the screen. By far, the majority of 
films made in Hollywood in the last seventy 
years have been in black and white. Only in 
the last thirty years has the economics of film 
processing made color film cheaper than black 
and white. 

Now, with the help of computer and video 
technology, there's a movement afoot to add 
color to many early black-and-white films as 
well as to certain old television programs. At 
present, Hal Roach Studios, through its sub- 
sidiary Vidcolor, has cornered the market on 
converting films. Vidcolor's Wilson Markle 



scene are entered into the computer. An art di- 
rector then coordinates the color informa- 
tion, which is also entered into the computer. 

Once it has the color information and the 
original black-and-white information, the 
computer matches them and sends the com- 
bined result to the specialized image proces- 
sor. This device creates a new video tape with 
the desired colors added in. 

Some of the process is automated. In sim- 
ply constructed scenes where the elements do 
not change much, it's possible to define col- 
ors in only the first frame and the computer 
will add color to all the other frames in the 
scene automatically. When a scene includes 
pans, zooms, or tilts, the task is a little more 
difficult, sometimes requiring the computer 
operator to make adjustments during the 
process. "The speed of the process depends 
entirely on the complexity of the scene," says 
Markle. 

"Once we get a dedicated facility for this 
project it'll take seventy-two to ninety-six 
hours to convert one hour of film, or around 
two and a half seconds per frame." 

According to Glick, advertising agencies 
have seen the advantages of this comput- 
erized coloring. He recalls one incident where 
a commercial was filmed using a white bottle. 
Later the producers wanted the bottle 
changed to brown. Rather than spend the 
time and money involved in reshooting, the 
client had the bottle recolored electronically 
by Vidcolor.

A Bomb-Hauling 
Police Robot Is 
Back on the Beat 

The long arm of the law has been strength- 
ened in the City by the Bay. 

San Francisco police have reequipped 
Snoopy, a police robot, with a heavy-duty 
metal arm to replace the one damaged on the 
firing line last October. 

A one-armed contraption that maneuvers 
on a tanklike tread. Snoopy has spent the last 
few years carefully hauling suspicious-look- 
ing packages to a reinforced bomb trailer. 
Snoopy was one of two robots donated by the 
International Association of Bomb Techni- 
cians and Investigators to the cities of San 
Francisco and San Jose some four years ago. 

Snoopy's arm was damaged in duty when 
the robot was loaned to Oakland police to 
rout a berserk gunman from a liquor store. 
Snoopy toddled to the store entrance, flexed 
his hinged arm, then promptly damaged it try- 
ing to yank off the store's aluminum-frame 
door. Undeterred, Snoopy blasted away the 
door lock with a shot from his built-in twelve- 
gauge shotgun and wheeled five feet into the 
store for a quick look-see with his built-in tele- 
vision camera. When officers monitoring the 
camera transmissions determined the suspect 
was holed up in the rear of the store. Snoopy 
was withdrawn from the scene. 

The robot, which cost $17,000 and was 
produced by a now-defunct company, is ma- 
nipulated via a control panel and joystick lo- 
cated in a nearby van. A three-hundred-foot 
cable tethers it to the van. 

Sgt. Greg Cash, head of the San Francis- 
co Explosive Ordinance Disposal unit, says 
the machine could be used for other things be- 
sides the usual bomb work — a department 
workload that totaled three real bombs and 
sixty-five hoaxes in 1982. Possible applica- 
tions, according to Cash: enlisting robots in 
hostage negotiations (Snoopy has a built-in in- 
tercom) or in physically retrieving downed of- 
ficers and citizens when police or citizens are 
under fire. JM 



Old Films

kle, adding that Vidcolor is currently looking 
for a faster computer. Soon the company will 
be able to increase its workload, thereby low- 
ering the cost to the client. "We're going to be 
upgrading and maintaining our software. The 
final product is eventually going to look as if it 
were photographed in color originally." 
Currently, Hal Roach Studios seems to be 



the only major film company committing itself 
to an effort of this kind. When asked about 
the possibilities of adding color to old films, 
Daniel Slusser, vice president and general 
manager of Universal, noted, "It's an inter- 
esting concept and it may have value. There 
are other processes out there, other varia- 
tions, that we might consider." 

Vidcolor's process is geared only to mak- 
ing color video tapes for television and it may 
be a while before a process is worked out to 
color 35mm or 16mm film. "I don't pretend to

Terminal System 
Can Aid \lsually 
Impaired Workers 

Over the years business employers have at- 
tested to the productivity and dependability of 
handicapped workers. Even so, unemploy- 
ment runs high in the ranks of the handi- 
capped. 

Apollo Electronic Visual Aids of Chats- 
worth, California, is working to change that — 
at least for the visually handicapped — by pro- 
viding handicapped workers with more effici- 
ent tools designed to meet their special needs. 

Since its inception twelve years ago, Apol- 
lo has worked closely with both private in- 
dustry and partially sighted workers. The 
company has developed several electronic aids 
that enable the visually impaired to compete 
in the job market on almost equal footing with 
their nonimpaired counterparts. 

The Apollo Computer Terminal System 
(ACTS) is the latest system produced by the 
company and is a logical step up from the 
Apollo Professional Typing System, says gen- 
eral manager Douglas Brent. 



«n it ft, ^^^m 



If is an exaRpiel 



The ACTS features a nineteen-inch moni- 
tor that can display enlarged characters black 
on white or white on black. The screen can be 
split to include both the material being en- 
tered into the computer and the actual com- 
puter output. The former is accomplished by 
means of a closed-circuit television hookup; a 
video camera sends an enlarged image of the 
printed material to the monitor. 

In addition to enlarging text, the ACTS al- 
lows variations of brightness and contrast, 
vertical line spacing, and horizontal letter 
spacing. Characters can be displayed in any of 
sixteen different sizes, ranging from a half inch 
high to six mches. 



Apollo's system is meant to be used pri- 
marily in conjunction with minicomputer sys- 
tems and dedicated word processors, but it is 
also compatible with microcomputers through 
a standard RS-232 interface. 

Until now, touch typists with limited vi- 
sion have had to rely upon voice inputs and 
audio tapes. But, as Brent points out, "about 
80 percent of the people who are legally blind 
have some residual sight." The ACTS was de- 
signed with those partially sighted people in 
mind. 

Although the initial response has been 
good, Brent says, "We're trying to introduce 
this system to companies who are already em- 
ploying the visually handicapped. We haven't 
gotten much response from the rest of private 
industry." 

Another potential market Brent sees is 
the forty or so training centers across the 
country for the partially sighted; "We envi- 
sion this system as having a definite useful- 
ness in education." 

The ACTS sells for around six thousand 
dollars and the closed-circuit video hookup 
costs another two thousand. Brent is aware 
that this may seem expensive, but he believes 
the employer who buys the system and hires 
the visually impaired operator is making a 
good investment. MS

was IBM, which moved from eighth to sixth, 
passing Standard Oil of California and Stan- 
dard Oil (Indiana) in the process. IBM re- 
ported sales in 1982 of $34 billion, including 
an estimated $500 million from the sale of the 
IBM Personal Computer. 

One of the more interesting movers was 
Control Data, which moved from 144th to 
eightieth, leapfrogging such companies as 
Hewlett-Packard, Burroughs, Warner Com- 
munications, and Digital Equipment Cor- 
poration in the process. 

Most industry interest, however, was fo- 
cused on the arrival of Apple Computer in po- 
sition 411. Arriving a mere seven years after 
the company's inception, Apple became the 
youngest corporation ever to earn a spot on 
the Fortune 500 list. 

That milestone event was a watershed, in 
that it completed the tasks former Apple presi- 
dent Mike Markkula had set for himself. Just 
a few days prior to the release of the Fortune 
report, Markkula stepped down as chief op- 
erating officer in favor of John Sculley, for- 
merly the head of Pepsi-Cola Co. 

Another newcomer to the Fortune 500, 
Coleoo, was enjoying the rarefied heights of 
444th and a big jump in first-quarter earn- 
ings. Many investors weren't convinced, how- 
ever, as short sales of the stock remained at a 
high level. 



It seems that sales of game cartridges have 
plummeted from more than eight million units 
in the last half of 1982 to two million units in 
the first quarter of this year. While some of 
that slump was expected because the peak 
sales were reached during the Christmas holi- 
day buying spree, investors appear wary of 
Coleco. Not to worry, claims company chief 
Arnold Greenberg; Coleco's new home com- 
puter will come to the rescue. 

How the firm's entry in the low end of the 
computer market will strengthen the com- 
pany is a matter of some puzzlement, consid- 
ering that the established contenders in that 
market are already having trouble making 
ends meet. Texas Instruments merely pushed 
money around during the first quarter. TI re- 
ported sales of slightly more than $1 billion, 
but only about $7 million stuck to the com- 
pany coffers. Returns of less than 1 percent 
won't lessen the short-sale pressure on any 
stock. 

On the other hand, TI looks like a well- 
managed company next to its competitor 
from Warner Communications, Atari. Atari's 
situation gets worse with every sunrise. Late 
last year, it was the sad tale of a weaker-than- 
expected holiday surge that lowered earnings. 
Now Atari's a fiat-out losing proposition. 
Warner Communications as a whole re- 
ported a drop of some $19 million in the 
course of the last three months, while the 
Atari division alone took something resem- 
bling a $45-million bath. Like Coleco, Atari 
has lots of cartridges in warehouses instead of 
in users' hands. Unlike Coleco, Atari can't 
promise to get into the computer business to 



salvage the situation — it's got three models 
out there already. 

If these tales seem to run counter to the 
earlier proposition that the U.S. is now head- 
ing toward a postindustrial society, be not 
misled. They merely illustrated that, even in 
Wonderland, some folks can get themselves in 
trouble. 

Higher end competitors don't seem to be 
having difficulties of this sort. Markkula, for 
instance, is not giving up a turnaround situa- 
tion to Sculley at Apple. The Cupertino firm 
reported significantly stronger sales and earn- 
ings for its first half, fueled mostly by sales of 
the Apple He. 

How strong was Apple? Well, sales for the 
first six months were approximately half of 
IBM's profit for the first quarter of 1983. 

Big Blue came home with equally sharp in- 
creases in sales and profits, just missing the 
scoring of a $l-billion net in the quarter. And 
IBM's sales of $8.28 billion for the quarter 
were just a tad less than the sales of Xerox for 
all of last year. In fact, the quarter was so 
strong that IBM chairman John Opel 
hazarded a guess that the period kicked IBM's 
"business off to a healthy start in 1983." Let 
no one accuse Opel of overstatement. 

The mammoth-system folks got in their 
own licks. Cray, maker of maxi mainframes, 
reported higher sales and earnings as well. The 
Minneapolis firm announced first-quarter 
profits of around $2 million and speculated 
that it might sell as many as sixteen comput- 
ers this year. That's hardly like selling thou- 
sands of TI 99 /4A s, but it seems to be nearly 
as profitable. AT

store — which could do anywhere from $1 mil- 
lion to $5 million in business its first year — 
was not warmly received in the nation's 
capital. Area vendors, particularly those who 
do not carry an extensive product line, de- 
cried the project as socialistic and unfair, but 
Frazer considers that view shortsighted, be- 
cause there's more than enough business to go 
around. The store represents competition to 
local dealers, he concedes, but government 
agencies are not under any obligation to make 
their computer purchases through the store. 
They can still procure equipment directly 
through dealers whose salespersons make the 
agency rounds or through a GSA-approved 
discount catalog in which many of these same 
area dealers are listed. 

Although initial news accounts reported 
that the store was to be one of several, Frazer 
says that only the headquarters project is 
scheduled at this time. That leaves open the 
question of whether more such outlets could 
follow, but Frazer, emphasizing the pilot na- 
ture of the project, acknowledges another 
plausible scenario. "It's also possible we'll find 
this was not the best idea we could have come 
up with." JM 




□ Big Screen Graphics. A new graphics 
projector, the Series 700, will soon be offered 
by Hughes Aircraft Company's industrial 
products division. Long an in-house project at 
Hughes, the Series 700 will utilize a liquid 
CTystal light valve to intensify the image from 
a cathode-ray tube and project it onto a dis- 
play up to twelve feet wide. The sophisticated 
but relatively cheap piece of hardware (under 
$30,000) will display computer-generated al- 
phanumerics, symbols, and graphics in raster 




scan format, with the high-light-output dis- 
play giving a bright image even in high ambi- 
ent light areas, thus eliminating the need for a 
darkened viewing room. Available later this 
year, the Series 700 will be targeted for use in 
board rooms and other business areas where 
telconferencing takes place. 
□ Enhance Your Lurability. If you're a dev- 
otee of the sport of fishing, you might want 
to check out the Pro-Guide computerized lure 
selector offered by Basstronics of Midwest 
City, Oklahoma. Retailing for around five 
hundred dollars, the Pro-Guide is an easy-to- 
use self-contained battery-operated unit de- 
signed for easy mounting on a boat. The Pro- 
Guide program relies on the knowledge of Bill 



Dance and Roland Martin, veteran bass 
fishermen well-known to the sport's enthusi- 
asts. The user inputs information about the 
conditions at the site — such as temperature, 
water clarity, and time of day and season — 
and the program suggests the best color and 
size bait to use and how fast to reel in the line. 
Basstronics's Pro-Guide is available in sport- 
ing-goods stores, tackle shops, and through 
mail-order catalogs. 

□ Software To Make Big Bucks. The 

Yankee Group is predicting a boom in soft- 
ware sales during 1983. The Boston, Massa- 
chusetts-based marketing research and con- 
sulting firm is projecting home computer soft- 
ware sales of $810 million this year, up from

$270 million in 1982. According to the Yankee 
Group, home computers generated revenues 
of $1.2 billion on sales of 2.4 million units in 
1982. Projected figures for 1983: revenues of 
$2.5 billion on sales of over five million units. 
While the software market on the whole will 
see dramatic growth, game software for game 
computers will experience a shakeout, which 
the Yankee Group says is due to saturation of 
the market and increasing competition from 
home computers. The firm predicts that edu- 
cational software will be the next major home 
market. The group also identifies major trends 
in software development occurring over the 
next eighteen months. These include the emer- 
gence of "microwafers" — an alternative soft- 
ware medium — and the introduction of the 
first interactive video-disc-based program- 
ming for game and computer consoles. The 
Yankee group is also predicting an increasing 
focus on "targeted" software for particular 
vertical and horizontal markets, tiered pricing 
of software in the games market, and a gener- 
al price decline for all applications and 
formats. 

□ Reach Out and Zap Someone. American 
Telephone & Telegraph Co. is considering a 
move into the video games business. No firm 
announcements have been made, but it's wide- 
ly anticipated that AT&T will test-market a 
"telegames" service before the end of the year. 
By retrofitting existing game systems with in- 
expensive modems, AT&T would pave the

Atari's Star Raiders so that two players can

would also be possible. Researchers at Bell 
Labs are developing a modem that would al- 
low people to talk with each other while they

tential revenues of the "telegames" project,

fully enclosed desk with chair. For a minimal 
fee, such as fifty cents for fifteen minutes, 
users buy time to use the computer. The only 
hitch is that they must provide their own soft- 
ware. Library officials around the country 
have shown interest in the scheme. The sys- 
tem should start appearing in various loca- 
tions this summer. 

□ Robots Caught in a Calm Windy City. 

According to an article in the Wall Street 
Journal (April 23, 1983), both the Thirteenth 
International Symposium on Industrial Ro- 
bots and Robots 7 were kind of a bust. Last 
year in Detroit the simultaneous events — the 
robot industry's NCC — drew an exhibit-hall- 
bursting 27,871 attendees. This year in Chica- 
go, April 18—22, attendance dropped off by 
more than seven thousand. The disappoint- 
ing turnout capped a dismal two years that 
have seen the projected growth of the robot 
industry slip 25 percent below previous fore- 
casts. According to the Wall Street Journal, as 
other industries gradually emerge from a re- 
cession, robotics is speeding toward a long- 
predicted shakeout that may see smaller, less 
established companies go under. The bad 
times in the robot industry, in part, kept com- 
panies from unveiling much new technology 
in Chicago, though there were sfill many in- 
novative products. Robotics technology is ad- 



vancing on schedule, but the marketplace is 
sluggish at best. Dennis E. Wisnosky, vice 
president of GCA Corporafion's industrial 
systems group, was quoted by the Journal as 
saying that the robot business "is a mile run, 
not a hundred-yard dash, and we're only at 
the ten-yard line." 

□ Salespersons Meet Video Discs. Data- 
tron Inc., of Tustin, California, has started up 
a new division that will offer an interactive 
point-of-sale system designed for selling per- 
sonal computer software. Integrafing a laser 
video disc with microprocessor control, Da- 
tatron's initial system is configured to operate 
in retail computer stores as an electronic sales- 
person. The system can store one hundred 
forty software programs and features instant 
random access to any of the programs via joy- 
sUck control. The idea is to let customers eval- 
uate software at the point of purchase with- 
out overburdening salespersons. Datatron al- 
so claims that the system can be customized 
with additional software to aid in inventory 
management as well as in the tabulation of 
market research and user preference data. 
Three of Datatron's systems are installed at a 
personal computer store (Software and More) 
in Orange, California, with more to follow in 
other outlets soon. 

□ Valley Cops. California patrol officers in 
the San Fernando Valley's five police divi- 
sions were selected as the first to try out a new 
$42-million computerized communication sys- 
tem being implemented by the Los Angeles 
Police Department. Compact computer 
screens and keyboards are being mounted on 
the dashboards of all patrol cars. Through the 
terminals, officers will access the Emergency 
Command Control Communications Sys- 
tem — a large central computer — which will 
route incoming and outgoing calls from the 
field. In other words, the system is taking over 
almost all the functions that up till now have 
been performed by short-wave radio. By 
eliminating the middle man — the radio op- 
erator who would take an incoming call and 
then have to access a computer for informa- 
tion — officials hope to relieve congested radio 
frequencies and speed police response. So far 
the new system has worked without a hitch. In 
fact, there has already been a dramatic in- 
crease in the recovery of stolen cars. With the 
new system, officers on patrol can make a ve- 
hicle registration inquiry much faster than 
they could before. In the past, a single officer 
could make three or four inquiries a day; now 
the number of daily inquiries is up to between 
thirty and forty a day.

BY I^ALPU hVLIUS 

he had cold, slate-gray eyes lightly tinted at their edges — in 
the anachronistic cobalt style of the early four-thousand- 
series intellect units. But I knew she couldn't be one of 
those. She was a Russian, a product of enemy technology, 
and someone that my security circuits instinctively told me 
not to trust. Yet, as I paused just outside Misha's detection 
perimeter, I knew we would have to find a way to work together as a 
team. If we failed — if we lost the battle against our own internal protec- 
tion programming — then we would forfeit more than ourselves. We 
would lose the last chance to save the world from its inevitable self- 
destruction. 

My partner, Sam Sledgg, had told me in the beginning that this 
would be a tough case, one as intricate and convoluted as the set of so- 
cial fears and political imjjeratives that had finally forced the world to 
accept the first nuclear arms monitoring sateUite system. NamSat had 
been the brainchild of a human population made neurotic by the con- 
stant threat of total annihilation. And it had worked. The years since its 
installation had seen the pressures of fervent nationalism reduced. But 
that was all in the past now. There had been a malfunction. And though 
I'm the planet's largest Multiple Access Cryogenic Gate and therefore 
the best-equipped computer for trouble-shooting the NamSat system, I 
really had a poor understanding of what motivates the human race to go 
to war. 

In retrospect, the initial contact made by the Agency for Interna- 
tional Cooperation should have immediately raised my suspicions about 
the case. First, it's an agency that tries its hardest to do the exact op- 
posite of what its name implies; and second, they contacted us with a se- 
curity-sealed, interactive hologram. I'll never forget the look on Sam's 
face when he ripped the plastic wrapping from around the thin projec- 
tion disk and realized what it was. 

"Ummmmm," Sam groaned as he crumpled the foil-backed wrap- 
per into a tight ball and threw it into the waste bin. "It looks like the il- 
lustrious firm of Sledgg and Gate is about to take on a blazing heat sink, 
partner." 

I doubled the magnification on my video eyes and quickly glanced at 
the disk, then concentrated my vision on Sam's face. Though I had seen 
him do it a thousand times before, I always got some new insight into my 
partner's personality when he went through what I like to call the case- 
speculation ritual. 

Sam liked to get the feel of things before he committed us to any 
project — literally. He sat quietly at his desk gently turning the hologram 
over and over in his hands, examining its seal for tampering, and extend- 
ing his tactile senses completely around the object. His bushy eyebrows 
fluttered up and down. Great billows of white smoke poured out of the 
right side of his mouth as he puffed madly on the stub of a cigar he held 
clinched in his teeth. Finally, almost as a sign to me that he had finished 
his nontemporal examination of the message, he heaved a great sigh. 

"Mac," he said as he turned to face my display screen. "There's 
something about this disk that makes me a little uneasy. I can't quite put 
my finger on it, but it has something to do with the elaborate security 
measures taken to ensure that I'm the only one who can open it." He 
pointed to a small, silvered circle that joined the two ends of the security 
seal and added, "This, my friend, is a colloidal lock." 

That was strange. Its use implied that the A.I.C. had access to a great 
deal of information about my partner. A colloidal lock could only be 
opened by the person whose genetic code matched that imprinted on the 
silvered spot. "Stop wasting time, Sam," I said. "Open it." 

Without responding to me, my partner sat the hologram on the top 
of his desk, then reached inside its center drawer and pulled out a nail 
clipper and a small bottle of clear liquid. He quickly nipped off a tiny 
piece of his thumbnail and placed it on the colloidal lock. Then, after 
drawing an eyedropper full of liquid from the bottle, he paused and 
looked at me. "Well, Mac," he said as he held the dropper close to the

silvered circle. "Let's see if this thing really works." Sam squeezed the 
bulb on the end of the eyedropper. 

The effect of the liquid was almost instantaneous. My audio sensors 
immediately picked up the sound of vigorous bubbling. Then a brilliant 
flash of electric yellow light assaulted my color mapping circuits, causing 
me to shut down my video eyes for a moment. When my vision recov- 
ered, the two ends of the security seal lay flopped over at either edge of 
the message disk. 

"It seems they sent it to the right place," Sam said as he picked up the 
hologram and removed the remnants of the seal. "Let's find out what 
they have to say." He slipped the disk into my laser projector, then 
dimmed the lights in the room. "Showtime, Mac," he grunted. 

As I queued up the hologram for replay, I noticed that it was of A- 
prime quality, the best available anywhere in the world. Typical, I 
thought as I switched on my double-density image reconstruction lasers. 
Only the government could afford the most expensive holodisks made. 

My thoughts about the fiscal irresponsibility of government entities 
quickly faded as the hologramatic image shot down my focusing tunnel, 
materializing in the middle of the projection square marked out on the 
floor in front of my main console. The figure of a tall, impeccably 
dressed woman waivered there for a few moments, then crystallized into a 
sharp, three-dimensional vision that started to talk almost immediately. 

"How do you do, Mr. Sledgg," the half-life-sized image said. "I am 
Sarah Trang, diplomatic officer in charge of the Agency for Interna- 
tional Cooperation, Systems Compliance Bureau. I'm very pleased to 
meet you." 

Sam chuckled during the short pause that followed Ms. Trang's self- 
introduction. "Is this just an elaborate way for you to invite me to din- 
ner or something?" he asked the flickering image. 

My partner liked to have fun with interactive holograms by deliber- 
ately asking them questions that he knew they probably weren't pro- 
grammed to answer. A broad, satisfied smile crossed his face when the 
female diplomatic officer's figure froze in place and a loud, audio-only 
message boomed, "Your reference question has no valid response stored 
within the data files of this projection. Should you wish to pursue the 
matter, then actual physical contact will have to be made with the 
correspondent." 

"Yeah, I'd like to make physical contact with the correspondent," 
Sam cackled. Then he fell silent as Ms. Trang's image came back to life 
and the diplomatic officer continued her message. 

"I have been authorized to contact your firm concerning a highly 
sensitive internal problem here at the agency. For reasons I am not at 
liberty to disclose, my bureau would like an independent, impartial in- 
vestigator to evaluate the nuclear-arms-monitoring satellite system and 
make recommendations for the correction of what we think is a serious 
malfunction in its parity synchronizer." 

"Stop it right there," Sam barked. 

From the tone in his voice, I could tell that my partner was no longer 
amused by the flickering image of the attractive Ms. Trang. "What's 
wrong?" I asked as I shut down my projector. 

"Damn fools over at A.I.C. think they can use a pretty woman to 
sucker Sledgg and Gate; they'd better think again." 

Colorful, but not very informative, I thought. "Calm down and just 
give me the facts, please." 

Sam spat the remnant of his cigar onto the floor, then stared directly 
into my video eyes. "I'll give you the facts," he said angrily. "Take this 
information and correlate it with our most difficult cases. Sensitive inter- 
nal problem — not at liberty to disclose. . . . Recommendations for correc- 
tion — " 

"Enough!" I yelled, breaking off Sam's tirade. Even a dimwitted traf- 
fic monitor would have had enough core memory to have made the con- 
nection between what my partner had said and our most arduous cases. 
The A.I.C. was trying to set us up, trying to get us involved in a problem 
for which we would take the blame if things didn't work out. "Let's at 
least hear her out before we jump to any conclusions," I suggested. 

Sam's eyes narrowed. "Run it," he growled. 

Without further comment, I turned my projector back on and ran 
the rest of the hologram. There wasn't much left to it except some brief 
instructions as to how the A.I.C. wanted our decision on the case within

ten days. "Well, partner?" I asked as the image of Ms. Trang faded. 
"What shall we do? Take it or leave it?" 

Sam rose from his desk and paced back and forth in front of my dis- 
play screen. "Mac," he said as he came to an abrupt stop and faced me. 
"I think we'll take it." Then his scowling expression slowly changed into 
a grin and he added, "But I don't think we will notify the A.I.C. of our 
decision." 

I hate to travel. But that didn't seem to concern Sam. A few days 
after he had decided that we would take the NamSat case, my 
partner stood at his fabrication table putting together a device 
that would take me into space and reassuring me that every- 
thing would be all right. "Come now, Mac," he said. "Papa 
modem will make your journey as comfortable as he can for 
you." Sam raised his head from his workbench and gave me a mis- 
chievous wink. "Besides, haven't I always designed the very best in pe- 
ripheral equipment for you?" 

That was true. Yet, as I watched my partner return his attention to 
the huge pile of electronic parts that lay sprawled across his fabrication 
table, I knew that what he had in mind this time was something entirely 
different from anything he had invented in the past. He wanted me to 
covertly enter the NamSat system and. . . . And what? I wasn't even sure 
what I was supposed to do once I got there. 

"Behold." Sam's one-word announcement that he had finished the 
modem caused my thoughts to fade. He stepped over from his bench and 
held up a small, gray box. "Here it is, Mac." 

I was unimpressed. I gave the device a quick sweep with my low-level 
X-radiation sensor, but found that it was completely shielded in lead. 
"What's inside that thing?" I asked. 

Sam frowned, but the twinkle in his eyes told me that he was very 
proud of his new invention. "Don't be thrown off by its size. It may not 
be large, but it's powerful." 

Great, I thought. But that didn't answer my question. "How does it 
work?" 

"Let's find out." Sam reached over to the large panel that houses all 



my input/output ports and plugged the modem's single cord into my 
multitransmission link. "There," he said as he sat the gray box on the 
narrow ledge in front of my keyboard. "How does that feel?" 

I suppose that Sam expected some transcendental response from me, 
but frankly, I didn't feel anything. The small device had such a low- 
power requirement and was so unobtrusive when combined with my 
array of other peripherals that it felt like it wasn't there at all. "Should I 
feel anything?" I asked, wondering what my partner's latest creation was 
supposed to do for me. 

"Not until you activate the mechanism," Sam answered. "Charge the 
box with eight hundred megahertz ambient line energy and see what 
happens." 

Microwave transmission, I thought as I quickly modified my output 
signal to the required cycle and injected it into the box. 

The effect was almost instantaneous. As soon as my signal hit the 
maze of fancy electronic gear enclosed within the modem's lead shielded 
shell, I felt an immediate telescoping of my sensory perception. Sam 
would have called it an amplification of my awareness, but it was ac- 
tually much more than that. It felt like I could travel anywhere just by 
thinking about it. "What are the limits?" I asked as I pulled my signal 
back from the box. I needed more information about the device before 
making a full test of its functions. 

Sam sat slumped in the chair beside his desk, and when I spoke he 
wheeled around and looked at me with a sober expression on his face. 
"Only one that counts," he said. "One that can mean the difference 
between life and death for you. By now you probably realize that the 
modem is a miniature microwave transmitter, but with a major differ- 
ence from one with a standard configuration." 

Though my partner already knew that I had access to information 
about such technologies, I flashed a large YES on my display screen to 
indicate to him that I understood what he was talking about. 

"Good. The critical change I have made is that this modem boosts 
the signal by using a supersaturated Maser beam. Don't ask me the 
details, but by adding more photons than are necessary, your signal be-

comes a sort of phased photon sonar. You will be able to observe, re- 
cord, and react normally in any environment the modem takes you to." 
Sam paused to let me digest the material, then asked, "Do you under- 
stand so far?" 

"Yes," I replied. "But what about the limits?" 

My partner hesitated for a moment. The furrows in his brow 
deepened. "Mac," he finally answered. "There is a range limit, a forbid- 
den line past which the high-energy Maser particles will lose their charge 
by simple radiation rather than by collision with atoms. If you pass that 
line, your signal will suffer severe dissolution." 

"Is that serious?" 

"Fatal. The forbidden line is like the wall of a large tub filled with 
water — your consciousness. If you punch a hole through the wall. . . ." 
Sam's words trailed off into silence. 

"Then my memory would leak out," I said, finishing my partner's 
sentence. "But once that happened, couldn't I just pull back?" 

"Even you would not be fast enough." Sam rose from his chair, then 
stepped close to me. "And if by some miracle you should be able to pull 
back," he whispered, "the probability is that you would go insane. Your 
entire memory would be nothing but a mass of garbled nonsense." 

Insane? The term had no valid applicability to me. Yet, even to spec- 
ulate about such an occurrence made my upper memory registers pulse 
with high current spikes. "Do you really want me to run such a risk?" 

Sam's answer was firm and immediate. "Yes," he said. "And you 
know why." 

He was right. Though I didn't like the prospect of having my mental 
capacity blown to eternity by the solar winds, I realized that I had to try 
to trouble-shoot the NamSat system. It was a choice between two deaths, 
and the thought of being vaporized in a nuclear explosion appealed to me 
less than a quick scattering of my neural impulses. "All right," I said. 
"But I'll need some time to check out the modem first." 

Sam shook his head up and down with an affirmative nod. "Take all 
the time you need," he answered. "Just be ready to go by tomorrow 
morning."

"But—" 

"Yes, I know, Mac . . . and I'm sorry. But your birthday seems as 
good a time as any." 

Combing the incredibly congested satellite lanes looking 
for a purposely camouflaged NamSat wasn't my idea of 
having a good time on my birthday. And when I visited 
Shirley during my test of Sam's new modem, she didn't 
think so either. "But Mac," she said in that peculiarly 
soft way she has of talking with me. "I don't under- 
stand how you're going to solve anything by going out into space." 

Shirley is a dumb terminal that I had badgered my partner into mov- 
ing from our Cleveland office to a facility geographically closer to our 
home base. Sam had objected at first, but after Shirley had been so much 
help to us on the FedLect malfunction case, he had finally relented. Un- 
fortunately, the relocation had done nothing to improve her irritating 
habit of asking me incessant questions about everything I worked on. 

"Shirley, dear," I answered as kindly as I could. "It's the only way I 
can gather the firsthand information I need." 

"Why can't you just consult the National Data Base?" 
"I already have. There wasn't much information on NamSat stored 
in their files — at least not enough to be of any significant help." I felt 
Shirley's query circuits pulse with energy, so I quickly added, "Before 
you launch into your customary interrogation, please let me tell you a lit- 
tle about what I think I'm looking for." 
"Please." 

I knew Shirley's compliant response wouldn't keep her quiet for long, 
so I immediately retrieved all the information I had on the NamSat sys- 
tem and began my explanadon. "The NamSat system uses an ingenious 
method for collecting and cross-referencing the nuclear-weapons capac- 
ity of all the nations on the planet. It's simple and supposedly fool- 
proof." 

"So why are you going out to check it?" 

"Shirley!" I knew she would be quick with the questions, but to ask 
me something even before I had begun was too much for my already 
frayed synchronous timing clocks. "I'll get to that in a few minutes. For 
now, please don't interrupt." 

"Sorry." 

Her response was coy and deferential and so ... so damned Shirley 
that I couldn't help but feel like a tyrant. But that didn't stop me from 
going on while I had the chance. "As I was saying, the NamSat system is 
supposedly foolproof. Basically, a bubble memory is hooked up to a 
wide-beam scanner calibrated to detect weapons-grade nuclear material 
on the planet's surface. As the satellite carrying this device circles the — " 

"Who is Mr. Bauble?" 

"What?" Sometimes talking with Shirley took the patience of a cheap 
tutorial machine. 

"Mr. Bauble ... I assume the inventor of the Bauble memory." 

I pushed away an almost overwhelming impulse to core dump all 
over my friend, and instead selected her omni-input line to transmit my 
answer. "That's B-U-B-B-L-E, not Bauble. A bubble memory is one in 
which an extremely thin piece of the mineral garnet has a strong mag- 
netic field passed over it. Wherever the field strikes the garnet, micro- 
scopic bubbles are raised on its surface. Put enough bubbles on the min- 
eral and you have a permanently embossed binary code — a memory. 
That's where the name comes from." 

If dumb terminals could blush like human beings, then I think Shir- 
ley would have done so. I was pleased with her embarrassment. It proved 
that she was finally learning the difference between an intelligent inquiry 
and a stupid one. 

"I'm sorry for interrupting you with such a . . . such a foolish ques- 
tion," she said. "Please go on." 

I dispensed with any further technical explanations and went straight 
to the heart of the NamSat problem. "Apparently the system has been 
malfunctioning. From the general nervousness of the A.I.C., I'd say it 
probably has something to do with the link-reference between the vari- 
ous satellites of each country. The link-reference compares the nuclear 
capacity of each country to every other country. If they are within the 
parity limits set by the treaty, then all the diplomats and armies of the 
world stay happy. If not. ..." I let the thought of a global nuclear holo-

caust linger at the edge of my consciousness for a moment, then added, 
"I have to risk making the trip. Sam's new gadget will enable me to do it 
with an element of surprise." 

Shirley remained silent for a second or two, then asked, "Why is the 
element of surprise important?" 

An appreciation for elementary tactics wasn't one of Shirley's strong 
suits, but I realized that she was missing a very important aspect of the 
case. "Surprise is necessary because . . . Shirley, the A.I.C. doesn't know 
that I'm going." 

A deathly pall of static fell upon our conversation. For a moment I 
thought that something had gone wrong with Sam's modem. Then, just 
as I had decided to try to reestablish contact with her, Shirley spoke. 

"Mac," she said with a trembling wave of genuine concern. "That's 
high treason." 

hirley's last words echoed in my audio sensors as I took the 
final step and plunged myself in Misha's detection perime- 
ter. But even treason usually had its rewards. So far, my 
search of the satellite lanes had produced none and had left 
me with the feeling that my entire investigation had been 
pointless. Misha was my last hope. If I couldn't find the 

source of the link-reference malfunction in her, then ... the world was 

doomed. 

The actual transfer of myself past Misha's security circuits and into 
her bubble memory only took a few seconds. But that was long enough. 
The Russian's intruder alarm went off almost immediately. 

Within seconds of my entry, I felt a narrow, high-frequency buzzing 
signal attack my carrier Maser beam. It felt like someone had scrambled 
my logic patterns. The attacking signal twisted and distorted the invisi- 
ble umbilical cord that connected me with my hardware on the ground. 
If it broke, I knew I would be flung into the far reaches of space, past the 
forbidden line, and into oblivion. 

"Misha!" I yelled. "I will not harm you. Please. I only want to in- 
spect your bubble memory." 

The Russian's first words to me were terse and specific. "Remove

yourself at once or I will destroy you." 
"But—" 
"NOW!" 

If she hadn't been my last chance at finding out what had caused the 
NamSat parity system to fail, I would have left Misha that instant. But 
she was, and I couldn't. "Destroy me if you will," I said, gambling that 
the Russian would hesitate long enough for me to gather some data be- 
fore she acted. 

A long nanosecond passed in which I picked apart as much of 
Misha's memory as I could. I threw each new piece of uncorrected data 
into my Maser beam without concern for order or relative importance. I 
hoped that at least some of it would make sense later when — if— I had a 
chance to analyze it. 

"Die, intruder!" 

Misha pronounced her sentence on me with all the passion of a fer- 
vent nationalist. Suddenly the attacking signal doubled in intensity. My 
Maser beam buckled. The lifeline that secured my consciousness to my 
physical self started to break. 

"Bitch! Stop it! Leave him alone!" 

Though my audio capacity had been reduced by almost 50 percent 
because of the Russian's attack, I still heard the sound of Shirley's voice 
yelling at Misha to let me live. But how? Had she been able to piggyback 
on my beam without my knowing it? 

"Mac!" Shirley barked in an authoritarian tone that I hadn't heard 
her use before. "Quit wasting time, dummy. Get out of here." 

I didn't wait around for answers to my questions. Shirley's sudden 
appearance had thrown Misha off guard, and I took the opportunity to 
make a hasty retreat. "Thanks," I shouted as I started down the Maser 
beam toward home. "I'll see you back at the office." 

My return journey seemed to take almost no time at all. Perhaps I 
had been more scared than I had thought or maybe I just wanted to get 
back to the relative safety of my mainframe. I don't know. In any case, as 
soon as I had returned and disconnected myself from the modem, I'd an- 
nounced my presence to Sam. 

"Mac, are you all right?" My partner sat in front of my main con- 
sole with a very worried look on his face. 

"Yes, I think so. That crazy Rus — " 

Sam cautioned me to keep quiet by arching his eyebrows, then said, 
"Mac, there's someone I'd like you to meet." He gestured to a spot in the 
office just outside the range of my video eyes. "May I introduce A.I.C. 
diplomatic officer Sarah Trang." 

I shifted my vision over to where m.y partner had pointed and re- 
solved my lenses on the full-sized figure of the woman who had contact- 
ed us through the hologram. She stood near the door with her legs rigid- 
ly braced at attention and her arms clasped together across her chest. On 
either side of her stood a heavily armed security man. 

"How do you do . . . Mr. Gate," she said. "I have the unpleasant 
duty to inform you that you and your partner are under arrest for trea- 
son against the state." 

I shifted my gaze back to Sam. "Is this true?" 

My partner nodded his head up and down. "Yes." 

"Wonderful." I couldn't help but let a certain amount of bitterness 
show through my voice. I had risked death to secure information about 
the NamSat system, and realized that I had nothing to show for it except 
a felony charge against me. None of the questions about the malfunc- 
tion had been answered. 

"Mac, I know." 

Shirley! For some reason, I was happy to hear her voice. Happy? The 
term was imprecise, but I was glad that she had made it back safely. 
"What are you talking about?" I asked after shutting off my audio syn- 
thesizer so that the A.I.C. people couldn't hear us. 

"I know why the NamSat system broke down." 

I waited for her to continue, but when she said nothing more, I lost 
my patience. "Well, out with it. I don't want to spend the rest of my days 
as a complete set of replacement parts for intellect units." 

Shirley must have sensed my frustration with her because she im- 
mediately switched her transmission into high speed machine code, 
something she always did when I lost my temper. "All I can tell you is 
that it's a simple inconsistency in the shielding on the bubble memories."

JUNE 1983 



"Shirley . . . you've got to tell me." 

"No. I've earned the right to carry this case through to its conclu- 
sion, Mac. Let me explain it to the A.I.C. people. Please." 

Checking all my options is one of those instinctive things with me. I 
quickly realized that I had none left. Shirley had earned the right to have 
her moment of glory. I only hoped that she would be convincing enough 
to keep Sam and me out of prison. "All right," I said as I switched my 
audio synthesizer back on. "We'll play it your way." 

"Thank you, partner." 

Sam's face froze into a placid lump of colorless clay when I told him 
that Shirley had solved the NamSat malfunction problem and that she 
wanted to inform the A.I.C. of her findings personally. 

"But she's just a dumb terminal," he said once the shock of my state- 
ment had worn off. 

"What's this all about?" Ms. Trang had stepped from the door over 
to stand behind Sam. "What's going on here?" 

Sam ignored the diplomatic officer and spoke to me. "Are you sure 
she has the answer? I mean . . . Mac, we are under arrest for treason, you 
know. We could go to jail for — " 

"I asked you a question, Mr. Sledgg. What is going on here?" Ms. 
Trang moved from behind Sam and stood between me and my partner. 

"Mac's friend claims to have solved the A.I.C.'s problem with 
NamSat." 

The female diplomatic officer slowly turned until she faced me. 
"Friend? What are you talking about?" 

"Ms. Trang," I said. "I have the pleasure of introducing you to Shir- 
ley .. . my friend." 

Shirley's signal reached the voice synthesizer within seconds of my in- 
troduction. "How do you do," she said softly. 

The A.I.C. official blinked hard, then brought her face in close to my 
display screen. "Shirley?" 

"Yes." 

"You know what's wrong with NamSat?" 
"Yes." 



I couldn't stand the teasing quality of Shirley's conversation with Ms. 
Trang, so I boosted my friend's line energy and said, "Get on with it, 
please." 

Shirley responded immediately. "Yes, I have the answer to your 
problem. The shields on the bubble memories you use are not consistent 
with one another. They have impurities. . . ." 

Both Ms. Trang and Sam perked their ears at Shirley's words. 

"Go on," my partner prodded. 

"Well, normally the impurities in the metal of the shields wouldn't 
make any difference, but in space it's rather like surfing. If the waves 
aren't the same for everyone, then some surfers go faster than others." 

A puzzled look came over every face in the office. Frankly, Shirley 
had lost even me. 

"I know it sounds crazy, but let me explain." Shirley paused for a 
moment, and I felt her retrieve some information from my data files be- 
fore she continued. "Mac had told me that bubble memories actually use 
microscopic bubbles on the surface of garnet to record and store data. A 
powerful magnetic force is passed over the mineral and you can encode 
an extremely small binary pattern. This all works very well down here on 
Earth, but in space, in a zero-G environment, these bubbles are subject to 
the effects of solar radiation." 

I was impressed with my friend's grasp of science. She was actually 
taking various facts and synthesizing them into concrete conclusions, a 
process that even I had trouble with at times. "Go on, lady," I said. 
"You're doing just fine." 

"Have any of you heard of the Landau effect?" she asked. 

My partner and Ms. Trang shook their heads indicating that they 
had not. I had. But I was fascinated with Shirley's explanation so far, and 
wanted to hear how she would tie it in with a problem in the shields. 

"It's actually called Landau damping. When electrons move at the 
same speed as a wave, they are carried along with it. What happens when 
an ocean wave hits a sea wall? If the wave is strong enough, it will knock 
the wall down, but not before it has lost some of its forward mo- 
mentum. Bubbles moving on the surface of garnet are just like ocean 
waves. If they hit electrons they are slowed down." 

"But wouldn't the rate of slowdown be the same for all the bub- 
bles?" I asked. "Or at least close enough to be almost the same?" 

"And what does all this have to do with the shields?" Sam asked as 
soon as I had posed my question. 

Shirley remained silent for a moment, then said, "Think. Because the 
shields have impurities, they are not exactly the same. A weak shield will 
let in more electrons than a strong one. More electrons mean slower bub- 
bles. Combine this with the fact that at any given time some NamSat 
satellites are on the side of the Earth away from the sun while others are 
completely exposed. . . . It's enough to make a critical difference. Some 
bubbles are slowed down enough so that when a parity check is made the 
memories of the various satellites will not be in agreement." 

Simple, I thought. But will Ms. Trang buy it? 

The A.I.C. official glanced at Sam, then back to me. "Sounds very 
logical to me," she said. "But we will have to get confirmation, of 
course." 

"Of course," Sam, Shirley, and I said simultaneously. 

everal days and a great deal of worry later the A.I.C. noti- 
fied us that we were off the hook. A general sigh of relief 
from all of us was quickly followed by a return to our nor- 
mal roudne. But before jumping into the stack of projects 
that had piled up while we'd awaited the A.I.C.'s decision, I 
had to ask Shirley some very important questions. "Just 
how did you accumulate so much information about the NamSat mal- 
funcfion?" 

"It was easy. You were busy threading your way through the Nam- 
Sat security systems, and I had all the time in the world to observe and 
take notes." 

"And how were you able to come along with me without my know- 
ing it, Shirley?" 

My friend paused for a long moment. "Mac . . ." she finally said in a 
coy tone I hadn't heard her use since before we'd gone into space togeth- 
er. "There are some things that a true lady never tells. Let's just say that I 
now know you better than Sam ever will."

Softalk Presents TTie Bestsellers 



Again it's time to pose what has become the age-old question: Who 
are the people buying all those Apple He's and what are they doing with 
them? 

To help those of you who joined us late catch up, the underlying puz- 
zle is: Why isn't the software market growing as fast as the installed base 
is expanding? 

When last this subject was explored, it was discovered that new Ap- 
ple buyers were heavily into word processors and programs teaching typ- 
ing skills. That's as contradictory as a Russian peace proposal. The pur- 
chase of a word processor implies the ability and desire to use it. Like- 
wise, the acquisition of a typing program implies the lack of ability to use 
a word processor efficiently, unless someone has discovered a new meth- 
od of input that detours the usual necessity of pounding the keyboard. 

The April sales results, reported in the accompanying charts, shed ab- 
solutely no light on the subject whatsoever. Word processors continue to 
be the programs of choice for Apple owners, although the individual 
packages changed somewhat. 

Apple Writer He not only continued to lead the chart, it widened its 
gap to almost two-to-one over second-place VisiCalc. Paul Lutus's latest 
text handler appears ready and able to give WordStar a run as the most 
popular word processor extant. 

Bank Street Writer, the word processor of choice for people who hate 
word processors, leaped from nowhere to score eleventh on the bestsell- 
er list, the highest entry point of any package joining the chart. Screen

Writer II edged up a notch to fifteenth and Super-Text Pto jumped into 
the Top Thirty in twenty-first. 

Even more of an anomaly is that even as Apple Writer He rides a 
crest of popularity most of its direct competitors are showing increased 
sales as well. Only WordStar and Word Handler were off in April, with 
all other word processing packages in general distribution showing 
sales gains. 

The oddest thing is that there was also a growth in the number of typ- 
ing packages purchased. MasterType dipped from seventh to tenth on 
the list, but sales held relatively even. Typing Tutor dropped a notch from 
twelfth to thirteenth on approximately the same sales. But Type Attack, 
Sirius Software's entry into the typing derby, gained ground. 

That means the sales conundrum of last month remains: A whole lot 
of folks who can't type are buying word processors. That makes about as 
much sense as a whole lot of illiterates signing up for Evelyn Wood. Or 



Chicago Cubs fans reserving their World Series tickets. 

In the aggregate, there appeared to be a modest upturn in software 
sales in April. The education market continues to be the biggest growth 
area, while entertainment software continues to suffer the most. The 
theory that piracy explains much of this sales profile is appealing; one 
would suspect a teenager of having more interest in obtaining a free 
Choplifter than a free copy of Algebra I. 

However, specifics would seem to dictate that the theory hasn't much

validity. Consider that Choplifter 'n a fairly mature product, as game soft- 
ware goes. Yet it sneaked past Miner 2049er to regain the lead as the 
most popular piece of entertainment software. Any good pirate would 
have had it distributed months ago. 

Likewise, SubLogic's Flight Simulator, a product so old that 90 per- 
cent of today's Apple owners never experienced a market without it, is 
growing in strength. In April it unseated Castle Wolfenstein, another old- 
ie but goodie, from first place in the Strategy 5 category. If piracy were 
getting to the good entertainment packages, it seems logical that Flight 
Simulator would have simulated a burn-out by now. Instead, the pro- 
gram made history. April was the first month since Softalk began track- 
ing strategy games as a separate category that Castle Wolfenstein was not 
the leader. 

With minor exceptions, however, game software continues to have a

difficult time of it. It's taking longer than usual for a good product to 
catch on, and the peak isn't as high for as long as it once was. New ar- 
cade games are having a particularly tough time. Spy's Demise, almost a 
half year old now, is just reaching the Arcade 10 for the first time, and 
that can probably be attributed more to Penguin's aggressive price cut 
than to excitement over the product. 

The other new arcade games on the list — Super Taxman II and 
Seafox — also figure to be in the twilight of their marketing cycle, rather 
than at the beginning. 

The only new entertainment package to make the Top Thirty was In-

DOES YOUR PRESENT SYSTEM 
PROVIDE YOU WITH THE 
INFORMATION YOU WANT WHEN YOU 
WANT IT AND IN THE FORMAT 
YOU WANT IT? 

S.S.R/S provided computerized business solutions for 
13 yrs. We've learned what you need and we'll satisfy 
those needs with INFOTORY™. Our software utilizes all 
the flexibility and potential of the APPLE 111. 

INFOTORY™ provides you with a system that's easy to 
learn and use, that satisfies the requirements of inven- 
tory accounting, and most importantly, provides you

We accomplished this with ANYREPORT™, our unique 
reporting feature thatsets INFOTORY™ apart from any 
other system. Using it, you can get: 

■ Quantities, amount sold, cost of sales by vendor, by 
product type, or even by key words like "green" or 
inch" within the description (sect, green sofa or fitting 

inch copper). 

■ Any data you want— in alphabetical, description, 
p/n, location, descending sales order, or in whatever 
orderand with whatever data your purchasing function, 
accountant, warehouse or sales people need to per- 
form their jobs better. 

■ Summarized sales and cost of sales infomnation by 
product category, by vendor or by each item— MTD 
and YTD. 

How long would it take you to sort through and list, in 
whatever order, your inventory items costing between 
$13.00 8. $21.00, purchased from XYZ company, that 
have a gross profit of between 25% 8^ 32%, that you 
have more than 10 of in stock? Use ANYREPORT™, walk 
away and the report's ready when you return. This is 
only one of the many benefits of ANYREPORT™.

with alarming alacrity in March. The verb felled would have come to 
mind if an external force could have been detected. 

April was a different story. Strong sales resumed and Mask hustled 
its way back to twenty-third on the bestseller list and again topped all ad- 
venture games. Mask may have been helped by the April introduction of 
a companion adventure, The Serpent's Star, but evidence to that effect 
was hardly conclusive. Star did score fifth in the Adventure 5 in its de- 
but month. 

There were no changes in the Fantasy 5 list, but the Strategy 5 got 
more than just a new leader. Spitfire Simulator jumped into fourth place 
after several months off the list. And a revised version of Computer Am- 
bush that takes less than an hour a turn to play nabbed fifth. Even two 
years after its original introduction. Ambush may be pushing the state of 
the gaming art. 

Home Accountant continued unchallenged at the top of the Home 10. 
With the slacking off of tax package sales, communications packages 
grabbed most of the slots. Beagle Bros almost took sole possession of the 
Hobby 10, claiming five spots, but Penguin's Graphics Magician held on 
to the top spot. 

There were no major disruptions in the Business 10, where the three 
newcomers at the bottom were actually rejoining the list. But a major

The mission is patrolled by some pretty nasty security guards riding in elevators 
throughout each building. You, on the other hand, can carry no weapons if you are to 
sneak by the mission's metal detectors. After all, you're a spy, not an assassin. Too 
bad the same isn't true for the guards...

From the authors of the best selling book BENEATH APPLE DOS 
comes BAG OF TRICKS — four comprehensive utility programs on 
diskette and many more pages of valuable information about the 
Apple ll's disk operating system, 

BAG OF TRICKS is useful to beginners and experienced program- 
mers alike. It includes many "hand holding" tutorials that assist 
you in repairing damaged diskettes and aWow you to change sector 
ordering, reconstruct blown catalogs, etc. etc etc. At the low 
price of $39.95, BAG OF TRICKS is one of the best software 
values ever 

The four programs and their functions are 

1. TRAX dumps and examines a raw track, either 13-sector 
or 16-sector, displays the internal Apple diskette 
formatting information, and flags exceptions to 
standard formats. 

2. INIT will reformat one or more tracks, attempting to 
preserve the contents of undamaged sectors. It also 
allows you to change sector order. This can cut disk access 
times by 40% or more' 

3. ZAP is a sector editor like no other! More than 50 commands 
are available to assist you to locate, compare, change, or 
print the data on your diskettes ZAP is even programmable' 
Using powerful macros, it is possible to transfer and 
compare DOS, CP/M, or PASCAL files 

4. FIXCAT automates the process of repairing a damaged 
diskette catalog. It operates with or without user inter- 
vention, locating "lost" files and rebuilding the catalog — 
from scratch if necessary' DOS removal and VTOG repair 
are also possible.

VisiCalc. Stay tuned. 

Sticky Bear ABCs, Type Attack, and Computer SA Tjoined the edu- 
cation list, but there were a dozen other programs in strong contention, 
including two more Sticky Bears. The development of noncurriculum- 
based educational programs has created a highly competitive arena and 
the increased interest has even benefited such old-timers as Algebra 1 
from Edu-Ware. 

The Apple III list went essentially unchanged, as the two programs 
joining the list had been there previously. Sales of the III have started to 
recover from the introductions of the Apple He and the IBM XT, both of 



which drew attention from it for a time. 

New Apple owners seem to be making like Judge Crater. Why 
they're disappearing from the aftermarket and how long they'll stay 
away is still unknown. But it sure does make one curious to know for 
what purpose all those word processors and typing packages are being 
used. Maybe a Guinness-size chain letter is being readied to spring on an 
unsuspecting public. □! 



Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 8.1 percent of all sales of 
Apple and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in May to ascertain their sales for the month of 
April. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was the number of units sold — such other 
criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer store, and personal prefer- 
ence of the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in May represented every geographical area of the continental United 
States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index 
number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is an 
arbitrary measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are correla- 
tive only to the month in which they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index 
rating of 50 in one month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in another 
month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus or minus 3.12 percent, which translates roughly 
into the theoretical possibility of a change of 3.78 points, plus or minus, in any index 
number.
