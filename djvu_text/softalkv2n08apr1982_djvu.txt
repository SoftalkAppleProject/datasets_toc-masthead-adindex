Many people think just because a computer does 
difficult things, it must be difficult to operate. Not so. 
At least not with PFS'" and PFS: REPORT. 

PFS and PFS: REPORT let you concentrate on 
doing your work, not on working your computer. There's 
no complicated programming or computer language to 
learn. Using the PFS Series is so straightforward, you 
can learn it in as little as 20 minutes, and that's some- 
thing both experts and beginners can appreciate. 

Design your own management system, simply. 

PFS lets you arrange your information in "forms" 
you design yourself. Once you've created your form— 
with spaces for all the necessary data— you simply fill 
in the blanks. 

If you don't like the original form, PFS lets you 
change just the form, without having to totally re-enter 
the information on it. 

To use your forms, just call up the information 
you want in a variety of ways such 
as "less than,' "more than," "equal 
to^ 'TDetween" or "not." You can 
even find specific charac- 
ters, words, names or num- 
bers. And PFS can also 
sort labels, change its 



Hardworking 
software for Apples 
that isn't a lot of work. 



40-column format to accommodate larger printouts, 
and tell you how much room you have left on your disk. 
Get more out of what you put in. 

PFS: REPORT sorts, calculates, totals, formats 
and prints presentation-quality reports with up to 9 col- 
umns, in alpha or numeric order, with automatic 
entering and justification. With your information in 
this format, you can analyze it quickly to help spot 
trends, plan and make decisions. 

A whole fanuly of software for Apple® 11 and III. 

PFS consistently ranks among the 5 top-selling 
business software packages for Apples. Because you 
can use it for almost anything— from chemical analyses 
to keeping track of your wine collection, from bal- 
ancing your checkbook to computing your payroll. 
And there are more programs on the way. 

For a free, hands-on demonstration of PFS and 
PFS: REPORT, stop by your local computer store. If 
they don't have it yet, tell them to 
call Software Publishing Corpora- 
ation at (415) 962-8910. Or write 
1901 Landings Dr., Moun- 
tain View, C A 94043. 

You'll be amazed at 
howmuch you can bite off.

gram to produce a famous quote. The 
quote relates to another extremely sig- 
nificant achievement that has affected 
the way of the world. To win the contest, 
you must solve this quote correctly, then 
identify who said it, the circumstances 
under which it was said, and the signifi- 
cance of those circumstances. 

Except for the final sentence, every 
answer In Man on the Moon haa to do with 
outer space or the U.S. space program. 

Man on the Moon is our second puns 
'n' anagrams puzzle; the answers are 
easy but the questions aren't. The clues 
are maliciously designed to be tricky and 
misleading, even though they often con- 
tain more than one definition and they al- 
ways contain at least two hints each to 
the answer. 

The hints may be of any sort. For 
example, the actual answer may be con- 
tained in the clue, except that the letters 
are mixed up, and you'll need to ana- 
gram them: "camp case" hides an ana- 
gram of space. Or the answer may be 
hidden: "Jim's pa ceded his land." 

The clue may be a pun: "The vet 
spays dogs throughout the universe." or 
a charade: "room for a well-paid veteran 
weight lifter" — room = space, well-paid 
veteran = pro, weight (lifter is Just to 
confuse you) = gram ; put them together 
to get space program. 

Each clue contains a real definition of 
the answer, which may be either defini- 
tive, descriptive, or exemplar but it may 
be of any meaning of the word, not neces- 
sarily of the meaning pertaining to space. 
A clue for the word space might contain a 
definition such as room, interstice, area, 
emptiness; Venm might be defined as 
planet, goddess, through the veins 
(venous), like an Italian city (Venice). 
The last two required translating the pun 
as well. 



Throughout the puzzle, you'll find 
shaded squares with small letters in the 
lower left comers. The answer letters 
that go in these squares are the letters 
that make up the phrase beneath the puz- 
zle. The small letters Indicate which 
word of the phrase the answer letter be- 
longs in. The letters for each word must 
be anagrammed to find the phrase. The 
blanks have purposely not been punctu- 
ated; you need not punctuate the phrase, 
but do not tissume it shouldn't have 
punctuation. 

Again, winning the contest does not 
require that you finish the puzzle, only 
that you correctly solve for the phrase 
and identify it completely. However, if 
you do complete the puzzle, you're eligi- 
ble for additional prizes. 

The winning entry will choose -^100 
worth of Softalk advertisers' goods at the 
local computer store. In case of a tie, the 
random number generator will choose 
the winner. 

F^ve correct entries that also contain 
correct completed puzzles will receive 
copies of Crossword Magic, the program 
from L&S Software with which the puz- 
zle was generated. If there are more than 
five correct puzzles submitted, the five 
winners will be chosen by the random 
generator. 

Fill out the entry blank and send It to 
Softalk Moon, 11021 Magnolia Boule- 
vard, North Hollywood, CA 91601, by May 
15, 1982.

Amdek's new Color-ll monitor with DVM interface board 



No video monitor has ever combined Apple 11 compati- 
bility with exceptional performance like the new 13" 
Color-ll monitor from Amdek. 

Color-ll features our optional new DVM peripheral board 
for easy interfacing with your Apple 11. And look at the 
other top-of-the-line features Color-ll offers: 

• RGB, TTL input for high resolution graphics. 

• 80 X 24 character display capability (with expansion 
card by Vydec). 

• 560 (H) X 260 (V) resolution. 

• Molded-in carrying handle for easier portability. 

• Front-mounted controls for faster fine-tuning. 

So if you want to get the most from your Apple II 
system, get the "most" monitor. Ask your dealer about 
Amdek's new Color-ll monitor with the optional DVM 
interface board. 



What is DVM? The DVM, or "Digital Video Multiplexor/' 
is a low cost interfacethatallowsthe Apple II computer 
to be used with an RGB monitor, such as our Color-ll. 

Amdek's DVM is software programmable to allow trans- 
parent operation, and is parallel with existing Apple 
text and graphic modes. Three of its channels are used to 
multiplex the existing Apple text, low resolution and high 
resolution graphics. The 4th channel allows the use of an 
80 character line video board. 

Our DVM is also color channel software programmable, 
enabling you to turn the three color channels on or off 
by software control. For example, the red and blue 
channel can be turned off when the 80 character 
channel is turned on, resulting in a green phosphor 
video presentation. 

For convenient operation, the DVM board may occupy 
any slot in the Apple II. The DVM also features low-power 
consumption and low-power schottky logic.

Oracle Part 5 winner Paul Shanberg, center, flanked by his two sons David and Jeff in front of Computerland 
of Walnut Creek, Colifornia, where Shanberg Sr. claimed his prize, the DOS Too/ Kif. 



Oracle '82. Last year, Barbara Wright 
of Oceanport, New Jersey, ran off with 
January's football question, giving the 
combined score difference between win- 
ner and loser In the Rose Bowl and Super 
Bowl games. She claimed It was purely a 
guess. But we're beginning to believe she 
and her family have a direct line to Pete 
Rozelle. This year, the task was to 
estimate the Nielsen rating the Super 
Bowl would receive. No, none of the 
Wrights won this time— but daughter 
Martha tied for second place with an en- 
try only .1 off the exact Nielsen mark. 

Since there are at least two men in the 



Wright household, we'll brook no more 
nonsense about football being a "men's" 
sport. Especially in view of the entry that 
did take the prize for 1982: Elizabeth M 
Lewis, Richmond, Virginia, predicted the 
rating to be 49.1, which is on the nose ac- 
cording to CBS spokesman Hal Biard. 

Lewis wins $100 toward the purchase 
of DB Master, the prize she chose, at her 
local dealer, Chesapeake Technology. 
She also leads for the grand prize Disk II

highest possible score, which is at pres-

even, and Peter Rosenfeld (Flushing, 
NY) and Clark Dresser (Northridge, 
CA) , with estimates of 49.2, stand in com- 
bined second, third, and fourth places 
with -.1 each. Rounding out the leading 
ten after part one are Paul Shanberg 
(Moraga, CA), fifth with - .3; Charles S. 
Lewis (Richmond, VA — yes, he's the win- 
ner's husband; an obvious conspiracy), 
sixth with -.4; Charles Lewis and Eliza- 
beth Lewis tied on additional entries for 
seventh with -.5; Paul Shanberg, an- 
other entry, ninth with -.5; and Jean Ar- 
mour (Liverpool, NY) with -.9. 

It's not only the Wrights and the 
Lewises who are showing clear psychic 
abilities ; Paul Shanberg, who holds posi- 
tions five and nine, won parts two and 
five of Oracle '81. 

No one is out of the running by any 
means. Few people were more than fif- 
teen points off the mark on this round, 
and that's close. To figure your score to 
this point, simply compare your score 
with 49.1, subtract the smaller from the 
larger, and put a minus sign in front of 
the result. 

Jumble. PhiUp Suh's prize-winning 
contest drew one of the largest volumes 
of entries of any Softalk contest, and this 
despite a typo in one of the names to be 
anagrammed. A saving grace was the 
fascination of Softalk'a art department 
for that particular name, which led them 
to feature it in the Illustration — sans typo. 
Numerous entrants commented on the 
faux pas, from the gentleman who 
claimed first prize because he was so 
sure no one else would catch on to the 
reader who's delightedly accused us of 
being extra sneaky just to make it really 
hard. Then there was the note from Plea- 
sant Hill High School Computer Club, 
which describes the situation pretty well: 

"We knew it had to be an error. We 
came up with 'pigbroth castle' and 
'graphics bottle' but somehow they just 
didn't seem right." 

Despite the jumble, 555 people got the 
right answers to the Jumble. The ran- 
dom generator — which is really triply 
random since it generates a random 
number of random numbers up to the to- 
tal number of winning entries and then 
chooses one of them at random — puffed 
and rumbled its way to choosing Mark 
Brothers of Elizabeth City, North Caro- 
lina, out of the jumble of entries. 

Brothers will invest his $100 prize in 
Vlsl products for hl^s work in real estate. 
He'll pick them up from his dealer.

One Apple 
and %550 
can make a lot of pies. 

And charts. And graphs. 



Introducing the New Personal 
Computer Plotter from 
Hewlett-Packard 

Now you can use your Apple® com- 
puter to generate your own presentation 
charts, graphs, and pie charts. How? 
Simply add on the new high 
quality, low cost HP 7470A 
Personal Computer 
Plotter. ^ 

The 7470A helps you 
save time, save money, and, 
lets you communicate quickly, accu- 
rately and effectively. 

The eye is faster. 

Data, when visualized graphically, becomes informa- 
tion fast. Charts and bar graphs can make any presenta- 
tion clearer and more readily understood. But asking your 
staff to produce the graphics 
for your next presentation 
doesn't ensure accuracy or 
artistic talent. And going to 
outside suppliers can be 
costly. Combined with your 
Apple® computer, the new 
HP 7470A plotter does the 
communicating for you. 
Quickly. Logically. And with 
off-the-shelf software. 

Fast and pretty. 

The 7470A gives you high plotting speed with excellent 
line quality... faster than any competitive small plotter. 
On top of all that, it comes in an attractive design 
package that looks nice on your desk. And it does it 
for only $1,550. (U.S.A. domestic suggested retail price.) 




Count on it. 

The 7470A is built the Hewlett- 
Packard way. To last. Designed and 
engineered with only a few parts, none 
of which require adjustment. And with 
customized integrated circuits 
that ensure reliability. 




Pen Pals. 

The HP 7470A has 
two single -pen stables 
that output multi-color plots in 
your choice of ten coordinated colors. Pens 
are automatically capped and stored. 

An option youH want, too. 

For only $95, you can also get a 17057 Overhead 
Transparency Kit that turns your plots into transpar- 
encies for overhead projectors. For "I need it tomorrow 
at 9:00 A.M.'" meetings, it's a necessity. 

Start plotting your next presentation today. 
Clip and mail the coupon below. Now. 

Mail the coupon below and we'll send you— absolutely 
free— a sample plot, a more detailed brochure, and a 
sample overhead transparency. 

Then . . . stop in at your nearest Hewlett-Packard 
Dealer. See the HP 7470A in action. Once you see it 
demonstrated you'll find a hundred ways to make your 
own Apple® pies. And charts. And graphs.

The Economics of Software 
As a person involved in producing soft- 
ware for the Apple, I have to respond to 
Steven Straughn's comments on the pric- 
ing of software. He implies that we are 
somehow ripping off the customers by 
charging $25 or more, when the cost of 
our raw materials is only $7. He appears 
to believe that the greedy producers 
pocket the $18 difference. 

To begin with, I would point out to Mr. 
Straughn that we, the software compa- 
nies, do not receive the full retail price. 
When you purchase a program from a 
computer store, you get several valuable 
services from that store : convenient pur- 
chasing, the chance to see it before you 
buy, assistance after the sale, even sim- 
ply the ability to learn it exists! This 
being the real world, somebody must pay 
for these services, and part of what you 
pay for a package goes toward these. If 
the package passed through a distribu- 
tor (which is more convenient for the 
computer store and allows it to give you a 
wider selection at the store), another 
chunk of the price pays their expenses. 
All told, the software company may well 
receive less than half of what you paid. 

Secondly, Mr. Straughn ignored sev- 
eral major expenses that software pro- 
ducers have. For example, consider ad- 
vertising, which is certainly not cheap. A 
full-page, four-color ad in Softalk costs 
more than $2,000. (If someone is going to 
suggest not advertising a product, I 
would point out that if neither you nor 
your dealer have ever heard of a prod- 
uct, neither you nor your dealer will buy 
it, so as far as you're concerned it might 
as well not exist.) Other expenses in- 
clude paying for shipping, packaging, the 
labor in performing those actions, de- 
preciation on computers, accounting and 
billing costs, legal fees, utilities, and rent. 

Finally, please don't forget that the 
author needs money for the time he spent 
developing the software. A good pro- 
grammer can earn $30 an hour writing 
custom software. If you develop an excit- 
ing game, market it, and wind up earn- 
ing less than $5 an hour for the time you 
spend developing it, which will you spend 
more time on, your next game or a cus- 
tom software package? 

For the most part, the people who 
make up software companies are not 
steely-eyed businessmen out to make a 
buck. We're people who are earning a lot 
less than we could if we took up more 



s s I o n 



mundane jobs, but we get a lot of extra 
satisfaction because we're selling prod- 
ucts we're proud of, and we're seeing 
them being used and enjoyed. Unfor- 
tunately, having to justify ourselves 
against letters like Mr. Straughn's takes 
away part of that satisfaction.

A Leg Up 

I'm responding to Paul Wilson's request 
(January 1982, page 14) for information 
on copyrighting an adventure game. 
Since it hasn't been that long since I was 
wondering how to do the same thing and 
wishing I could write programs for a liv- 
ing, I know the problems and questions 
that occur when trying to get your feet 
wet in the game writing business. I hope 
this letter will be of help to all who are at 
that stage now. 

When I wanted to copyright my first 
adventure game. Castles of Darkness, I 
called the local offices of my congress- 
woman and was given the phone number 
for the Library of Congress. I called that 
number and asked for the Copyright Of- 
fice (the correct name is Register of 
Copyrights) and I was answered by that 
rarity of rarities: a governmental work- 
er who was not only sympathetic but 
knew what she was talking about! 

Whenever anyone completes a work 
(program in our case), that person auto- 
matically owns the copyright — in other 
words a copyright is a by-product of au- 
thoring a work. So you don't apply to 
Washington for a copyright, you register 
your copyright. In fact, under the latest 
law you don't even have to register it. To 
quote Copyright Office circular Rl, page 
7, "Except in one specific situation, reg- 
istration is not a condition of copyright 
protection." That situation occurs when 
a copyright notice does not appear in the 
work. There are advantages to register- 
ing your copyright, and to doing it within 
three months of publication of the work. 
For one thing, quoting from the same 
page, "Statutory damages and attor- 
ney's fees will be available to the copy- 
right owner in court actions. Otherwise, 
only an award of actual damages and 
profits is available." 

Registering yoiir copyright costs $10. 



You fill out Form TX and, for most pro- 
grams, get a printout of the first and last 
twenty-five pages of the program listing. 
You then send your $10 check, form, and 
listing to: Register of Copyrights, Li- 
brary of Congress, Washington, DC 
20559. 

Requesters may order forms from the 
Copyright Office by telephoning (202) 
287-9100. In addition to Form TX (ask for 
several copies of it), you should order 
copies of the following circulars (they're 
all free) : Rl, Rlf, 31, ML-182, and ML- 
212. These circulars are explanatory and 
should answer any remaining questions. 

As far as marketing a new program 
goes, I suggest that you contact several 
software houses and request a nondis- 
closure agreement (reputable software 
houses each have their standard form) 
from each of them before sending a copy 
of your program. The agreement should 
say something to the effect that your pro- 
gram will not be shown to anyone out- 
side the company and no manufacture 
will begin until a further written agree- 
ment is signed. You may also consider 
approaching a local store (making sure 
it's a good one) and asking them if they 
are interested in manufacturing soft- 
ware. There are advantages and disad- 
vantages to both routes. When you get 
bids on your programs, they will almost 
certainly be given as the percent of man- 
ufacturer's gross to be paid as a royalty. 
When comparing bids, be siore to con- 
sider the method of payment (for ex- 
ample, quarterly, semiannually) and 
whether or not the company is going to 
receive retail and/or distributor prices 
for your program.

Ten Hours!? 

I received my first copy of Wizardry two 
weeks ago. I feel that it is the best 
game/adventure on the market. The only 
adventures on the Apple that I had been 
able to enjoy before Wimrdry were the 
On-Line Adventures. I also had never 
liked anything similar to Dungeons & 
Dragons. With its graphics. Wizardry 
brings fantasy game playing to its feet ! 
In fact, I have been playing Wizardry so 
often lately that I think I would be sur- 
prised if my Apple is able to do anjrthing 
else but Wizardry. 

Yet I have found that usually the bet- 
ter the program the more bugs there are, 
and Wizardry is no exception to that rule. 
Two weeks has been enough time for two 
different copies to bite the dust. Mean- 
while I had acquired both the version 
dated last September and the version 
dated last December, the later one being 
hardly any better than the earlier. Such 
parts of the program that I had the most 
difficulty with were the Utility Options 
and the Training Grounds. I find it par- 
ticularly discouraging to give a com- 
mand that requires Wizardry to access 
the disk and then never hear from the 
program again as the disk goes whisping

around indefinitely. As to the Utility Op- 
tions, unless they are improved Sir-Tech 
might as well stake them off the pro- 
gram. \ 

But I'm no fo^; as soon as I got my 
new copy, I sat down with my Locksmith 
Jf.O and documentation in order to back it 
up. I must commend Sir-Tech on their 
copy protection; it took me almost ten 
hours to copy it. Who would have ever 
thought that the program doesn't run un- 
less the disk is write-protected. One final 
note to the authors of Wizardry : next time 
more action and less preparation so that 
the game does not end up becoming bor- 
ing. I expect to be one of the first people 
to buy the next scenario when it comes 
out in March.

Off Track on Pirates 
In the old days, sailing ships had prob- 
lems with pirates. Two great nations 
used opposite solutions to reduce the pi- 
racy. Spain increased the cannon and ar- 
mor on its ships. This increased the 
weight, cost and slowed down the vessels 
making them less desirable as a ship- 
ping vehicle. England, conversely, did 
the opposite. It lightly armed its small, 
inexpensive ships thus making them 
lighter and faster. They were better at 
their intended purpose — to trade and de- 
liver cargo quickly. History has shown us 
that England won, not because they 
avoided pirates better than Spain, but be- 
cause they did not let pirates get in the 
way of good business — in this case, ef- 
ficient shipping. 

This bit of historical fact has great im- 
port in the software piracy problem of to- 
day. Many companies are spending too 
much time and money worrying about pi- 
rates. They reduce, if not ruin the 
usability of their products (programs) 
with locked disks, unlistable programs, 
secret source code, hidden locks, codes in 
ROM chips, full-page ads devoted to pi- 
rates, etc. These devices have made 
many programs inefficient, costly to pro- 
duce and support. The buyer is taxed 
greatly for he cannot make modifica- 
tions or back-up copies. Often he is in- 
convenienced by added expenses for 
back-ups or future modifications. This 
hurts sales and angers good customers. 

There is a better way as exemplified 
by our company Andent, Inc. We pro- 
duce Apple II software for health profes- 
sionals (medical/dental systems, ap- 
pointments, hypnosis, et cetera). We 
have been in business since 1978, which 
makes us one of the oldest software 
houses for microcomputers. We are mak- 
ing a profit . . . and always have. We pay 
our bills and programmers on time. All 
our software is unlocked and can be cop- 
ied for back-up purposes. We support all 
sales offering free replacement of dam- 
aged disks. All our software is listable 
and can be modified by the user. There is 
internal as well as written documenta- 
tion. 



We do business in this way because it 
pays. It pays us, and it pays our custom- 
ers for buying our software. Because our 
software is unlocked, there is little to no 
problem with back-ups, updates, changes 
in DOS, hard disk compatibility, slot 
compatibility, printer slot and special 
character problems, disk recalls, and 
equipment incompatibility. 

The business community, our cus- 
tomers, like this. They are buying a pro- 
gram . . . not a software lease. They have 
immediate support since changes and 
problems can be made over the phone or 
by letter. They can back up immediately 
and for as many times as needed. They 
like our low prices. Unlocked software is 
good for business, our business, your 
business, and the customer's business. 

But what about pirates? Large scale 
pirates, those enterprising souls who 
copy our programs and sell them world- 
wide, are discovered and given an option 
to become our dealers and pay us a royal- 
ty on distributed software (or meet us in 
court). As in the old sailing days, re- 
formed pirates (privateers) make the 
best dealers and we don't mind sharing 
the wealth. For those who don't want to 
cooperate, we go back in history for the 
remedy. The English and Spanish both 
learned that a few executions were good 
for the morale of the troops. Small-time 
pirates (give it to your friends) can be 
controlled by low program cost, regis- 
tration, continuing updates and docu- 
mentation. It just doesn't pay to get our 
programs second-hand. 

Andent, Inc., believes that a sale of 
software is just that — the sale of pro- 
grams, listings, source code, backup ca- 
pability ... a complete sale. Our cus- 
tomers do not buy a disguised lease — 
they buy and own our products. We do 
this because locking programs is very ex- 
pensive, time-consuming, and hurts 
sales. 

It is time the industry realizes, like 
the sailing ships of old, that our prime 
business is producing and distributing a 
product, not fighting pirates.

Refreshingly Avant-Garde 

Not too many weeks ago, we purchased 
The Complete Mailing Label and Filing 
System by Avant-Garde Creations. No 
author was listed. 

We found the program to be exactly 
what we were looking for. About halfway 
into the program and instruction manual 
I had to comment to my wife that the in- 
struction manual was absolutely out- 
standing. I told her that whoever wrote 
the instruction manual could make a for- 
tune rewriting other companies' instruc- 
tion manuals. 

After spending many hundreds of dol- 
lars on software with terrible documen- 
tation, it was refreshing to spend very lit- 
tle money for such a well written soft- 
ware program as Complete Mailing La-

I am a small business owner engaged 
in International consulting and manage-

ployed persons, work long hours and 
don't have time to fiddle around learning 
programming, and so on. After conduct-

Microaccountant to be the most suitable 
for my business and certainly the least

and its supporting user guide to be real- 
ly outstanding. (My bankers like the 
printouts too!)

with a query that turned out to be an ac- 
counting question and not a fault In the 
program. The response I received from 
Spectrum was the epitome of courteous 
attention. I have recommended this 
same program to some of my overseas 
clients who, like me, require a straight- 
forward financial record and control. 

I now intend purchasing The Univer- 
sal Business Machine that contains a pro- 
gram element similar to VisiCalc. Al- 
though VisiCalc, being in machine lan- 
guage, is faster than UBM, the capabili- 
ties of UBM and its price structure suits 
my business operation more effectively. 
As far as the criticism of the user guide 
(documentation) is concerned, suffice to 
say, I shall not need to attend special 
study classes as I might with VisiCalc. 

All in all, I believe Spectrum Soft- 
ware has certain products that are real- 
ly ideal and within the budgets of small 
businesses. Considering that a substan- 
tial percentage of American business Is 
comprised of firms with less than ten em- 
ployees, Spectrum has a lot to offer by in- 
creasing a firm's efficiency at minimal 
cost.

Not a Good Rating 

I am a seventeen-year-old high school 
student and avid adventurer. Recently, I 
purchased a copy of On-Llne's Cranston 
Manor. Naturally I expected, from the 
description given, an adventure which 
would take a while to solve. I expected a 
huge house, unusual combinations, and 
an old man's ghost wandering through- 
out the manor guarding his treasure. 
What I got was a house with about twen- 
ty-five rooms (although there are cav- 
erns under the house) , treasures just ly- 
ing out in the open, and several bugs. 
Also, when I called On-Line, they said 
that Old Man Cranston's spirit had no 
bearing on the game; he wasn't even 
there ! 

I am now stuck with a $35 adventure 
that took me five days to master playing 
at about two games each day. This, to 
me, was an unwise Investment. Of 
course, I had no guidance except for On- 
Line's advertisement which apparently 
misled me. I figure that the least I can 
do is warn other adventurers of this disk. 
Although the format and the graphics are 
good, it is a beginner's adventure which 
will be solved in no time. 

I definitely agree that Softalk should 
rate adventures. This would be benefi- 
cial not only to people in my case, but 
also to novices who may otherwise wind 
up with the hardest adventure on the 
market.

age, received its first shipment of 
Crystalware product in September 1981. 
Since then, we have experienced difficul-

Whether attempting to exchange defec- 
tive games or receive credible explana- 
tions for specific problems, we have rare- 
ly received any cooperation. (One nota- 
ble experience: when preparing to ex- 
change our second, supposedly debugged 
shipment of Waterloo, I was asked if I 
"wanted to know the truth" about the 
problems we had with ten separate 
copies of the program. I was dumb- 
founded.) 

Having tried, in vain, to locate among 
their products one that both works reli- 
ably and is sales-worthy, we have tried 
one last desperate ploy; our entire in- 
ventory of Crystalware software is piled 
high on our bargain table, priced at 40 
percent off, and guaranteed to boot, pe- 
riod. Unfortunately, we haven't sold 
much of it. 

Perhaps, however, I should be en- 
couraged. It may be that word-of-mouth 
regarding this company is so bad that 
they will soon move on to a business 
whose demands they can better cope 
with. On behalf of myself and consumers 
whose first requirement of a software 
package is that it work properly and re- 
liably, I hope that is the case. 
Charles D. Limmer, Jr., Los Angeles, CA 

As an owner of Crystalware's adven- 
ture, 20U1 AD, I look forward with inter- 
est to your review of that game In your 
next issue. My version of 20U1 is the 1982 
revised for DOS 3.3. After struggling for 
two weeks, I finally returned diskette 1 
(the first two adventures) to them for re- 
placement. My two problems were as fol- 
lows: 

1. The save game function just doesn't 
work. Regardless of whether I Invoked 
the save in Congoland or the Arabian Ad- 
venture, when I restarted the game, it al- 
ways put me on disk 3 in Merlin's Hide- 
away. 

2. If my character was moving along 
the edge of the screen and something ap- 
peared next to me (i.e., a group of war- 
riors in Congoland or a caravan in Ara- 
bian Adventure) , my character froze and 
I was unable to move it in any direction. I 
could do everything else — trade, attack, 
greet — except move. Thus I had to end 
the game. This is very frustrating when 
you have spent several hours advancing 
through the game only to find you are 
forced to start over. 

Mr. Lillicrap's experience with his 
Crystalware game (Softalk, February 
1982) is not unusual. Last Christmas when 
I visited a software store in West Los An- 
geles, I found all Crystalware games at 
20 percent off. I asked the clerk why. 
They told me that their customers have 
returned so many Crystalware games for 
replacement that they decided to sell off 
all their Crystalware merchandise and 
drop the line. As I had just spent $60 for 
2041 AD I was somewhat distressed. I 



hope my replacement disk for 2041, AD 
solves the two problems I just men- 
tioned. 

It seems to me that for such an ex- 
pensive game I should receive some- 
thing that at least allows me to complete 
the game or play it to my limitations 
rather than being stopped by a program 
bug that should have been discovered be- 
fore the game was offered for sale. 
David Jameson, Boise, ID 

After reading the Open Discussion col- 
umn in the February issue of Softalk, I 
felt compelled to reply to the rebuttal 
from Crystalware. 

Early in 1981, I sent Crystalware 
$39.95 for a copy of Sands of Mars. After 
waiting five weeks with no reply, I asked 
for a refund. Instead, I finally received a 
copy of Sands of Mars on two disks. 

This very early version of the game 
had an unbelievable number of bugs. It 
was obvious that neither John Bell nor 
any of his employees had tried to play the 
game even once. The game couldn't be 
played because of all of the bugs. But 
since I had just finished playing The Pris- 
oner, I was prepared for almost any- 
thing. I played around the bugs as best I 
could. So it bothers me when Mr. Bell 
says we are more Interested in finding 
faults with the game than enjoying it. 

I called Crystalware, but I couldn't 
reach Mr. Bell. Instead, my name and 
address were taken, and a week later I 
received a list of twenty-four bugs. At 
least this made It possible to play a little 
further. But the letter also offered $10 per 
bug found by users of Sands of Mars. At 
that rate, I would own their company in 
no time. I telephoned again, but still they 
would only take my name and address. 

Finally, I returned the game and 
asked for either a refund or a working 
version. Needless to say, they sent an- 
other copy, which still had many bugs. I 
wish to emphasize that I would much 
rather play the game than criticize it. To 
date, I have successfully voyaged to 
Mars reasonably intact and mapped the 
labyrinth of the Kendra (long-dead race 
of Martians In the game's history). But 
when a Kendra attacks, I have the choice 
of being killed, which ends the game, or 
firing my laser, which crashes the pro- 
gram. How does one cope with a situa- 
tion such as this? Isn't playtestlng a pre- 
requisite for selling a commercial game 
program? Should we pay $39.95 and up 
for the privilege of debugging Crystal- 
ware's games? It appears that Crystal- 
ware Is as guilty of white collar crime as 
any pirate. 

If Crystalware will not issue refunds 
to all those who have purchased their de- 
fective products, I suggest that we write 
to the editors of Creative Computing, 
BYTE, and anywhere else Crystalware 
products are advertised. 

The worst of this situation is not the 
one-time loss of $40, but the loss of faith in 
other software publishers. We Apple 
users are accustomed to buying soft-

ware sight unseen. All we know of a prod- 
uct is its advertisement. So the next time 
we see an advertisement for an exciting 
game by an unknown publisher, we may 
wonder if this company is another Crys- 
talware. This insecurity would do more 
damage to the hobby than anything that 
could be done by Crystalware. 
Victor De Grande, Staten Island, NY 

An Addendum to Muse 

I enjoyed your EXEC MUSE profile in 
the February issue. However, I feel it is 
necessary to point out a few mistakes and 
glaring omissions by the writer. First, 
Jim Salmons did not leave his job as 
marketing director in July of last year, 
but rather a full two months earlier. I 
was hired as his replacement in May and 
assumed the post on June 1. The article 
fails to mention me or the role I played in 
bringing many new dimensions of posi- 
tive customer-oriented marketing to 
Muse. Also ignored is my creative role, 
particularly in regard to my work with 
Silas Warner in evaluating new products 
and writing a follow-up game to the suc- 
cessful and entertaining Castle Wolfen- 
stein. Nowhere are any of my contribu- 
tions mentioned. I find this omission, 
along with the inference that Mr. Sal- 
mons' successor was a "temporary" re- 
placement, to be a disservice not only to 
me but also to the hundreds of cus- 
tomers, journalists, programmers, and 
retailers whom I personally served and 
worked with on a daily basis for almost 
eight months. 

I am proud of my accomplishments 
with Muse. Like other ex-employees who 
worked hard for Ed Zaron yet eventually 
disagreed with his business practices and 
methods, I feel your writer could have 
done more to give credit where credit 
was due 

Thomas A. Jackson, Baltimore, MD 
Bucking Bucky 

I'm sorry that I cannot share your enthu- 
siasm for Buckminster Fuller. As an out- 
standing, innovative designer, he has few 
peers. But as a city/world planner, he is 
dangerously totalitarian. 

I've skimmed his book. Critical Path, 
where many of the ideas expressed in 
your article (January 1982) are expound- 
ed, and he makes me shiver with his 
bland disregard for the individual as he 
sweeps grandly on to his stupendous so- 
lutions for humanity's manifold prob- 
lems. 

His casual acceptance of Soviet de- 
ceitful actions, such as in attempting to 
hide the actual locations of towns and 
cities, deliberately altering maps avail- 
able to the outside world, shows why he is 
held in high regard by the Kremlin slave- 
masters. It's one thing to say that such 
actions are to be expected, but quite an- 
other to practically welcome them. 

I agree that there are "entrenched in- 
terests" whose activities are definitely 
not in mankind's best interests. But it 



does not occur to him that, just maybe, 
his grandiose philosophy fits right in with 
theirs. After all, it was the Wall Street 
bankers who bankrolled and fostered the 
phony Russian "revolution." 

I think his concepts, such as "Syner- 
getic-Energetic" geometry, "Geo- 
desies" and "Dymaxion" systems, in- 
cluding his three-wheeled automobile 
whose streamlined design is still light- 
years ahead of the present, show a bril- 
liance equalled by very few. But, like 
Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein, he 
displays profound economics illiteracy 
and complete disregard for the individ- 
ual. 

Incidentally, aren't you inviting 
raised eyebrows by calling your column 
"Newspeak," a la Orwell's "1984"? 

Thanks for listening. 
Howard S. Balsam, Nashua, NH 

The very point of using "Newspeak" 
as the title of a column filled with news of 
the spread of computers into the hands of 
increasing numbers of private individ- 
uals is to say that 1984 is nearly here but 
Orwell's world isn't; and that, to the ex- 
tent that Orwell's predictions crop up in 
reality, the very existence of privately 
owned micros is one of our best tools to 
combat the Orwellian threat. 

That's Good! That's Bad 

I find it extremely incongruous to read 
and be stimulated by the appearance of 
the article on Buckminster F^iller in your 
January 1982 issue, calling for the full- 
ness of our experience to lend logic and 
technology to our very survival, only to 
turn the pages to find Howard Software 
Services' ad using a woman as bait for 
the book Creative Financing. My first 
guess is that there is indeed nothing crea- 
tive in those pages and my second is that 
Howard excludes a tidy market for their 
book by such uncreative selling — I'll cer- 
tainly look elsewhere for fresh informa- 
tion on the subject. 
Jan Sutherland, Berea, KY 

Kudos and a Question 

To Doug Carlston : This evening I had the 
opportunity to read your article All About 
Applesoft in the January issue of Softalk. 
I am really looking forward to reading 
the February issue now. 

We have had a family Apple n Plus for 
about a year now and are still struggling 
through the operational learning pro- 
cess. We're gaining, but I did pick up two 
formerly not known or not understood 
procedures from yoior January article 
. . . please keep it up! 

My question to you concerns The New 
Step By Step by Program Design, 11 Idar 
Court, Greenwich, CT 06830. The only ad- 
vertisement I have seen (October 1981, 
Creative Computing ) bills it as "A Pro- 
gramming Course for Beginners." Hunt- 
ingdon Computing (my nearest mid- 
Michigan dealers have never heard of it) 
tells me, "If we get ten units we have fif- 



teen orders for it." Otherwise, I have 
been unable to find any reviews of this 
program. Have you heard of it (or have 
you seen it) and would you recommend it 
above anything else (what else)? for 
someone who could hardly spell c-o-m-p- 
u-t-e-r prior to last year? 

P.S. Thanks to a number of pro- 
grams we have been able to "punch in," 
the Apple is paying its way; but we would 
like to know why it does what it does. 
Robert E. Daily, Alma, MI 

Looking for Alignment 
I am looking for a simple Basic or ma- 
chine code routine that would cause nu- 
merical input or calculated results to be 
displayed in right-justified dollar and 
cents format. I have a homebrewed rou- 
tine that works, but I'm sure that more 
streamUned and efficient routines exist. 
Frank E. Merrill, Indianapolis, IN 

Offering Alignment 

I'm a new reader but an avid Appier. 

Enclosed is a program I have written 
and perhaps there is a place for it some- 
where in Softalk. 

The first thing I found out about my 
Apple was that it could not print that 
trailing zero. For example, to print $10.10 
was a no-no. Apple could not print that 
last zero. Even worse, Apple would print 
$10 with no zeros and no decimal point. 

After a load of reading, asking, and 
trying, here is the solution and it is much 
simpler than I ever dreamed. You, too, 
will be able to print the last zero or two 
zeros after the decimal. Just follow the 
directions, but exactly! 

Try the following program: 

20 Sl$ = "0":S2$ = "00": D = 2 
30 READ X 

40 X = INT(X*100-l-.5)/100 

50 X$ = STR$(X) 

60 FOR I = 1 TO LEN(X$) 

70 IF MID$(X$,I,1) <> "E"THEN NEXT I 

80 FOR J = 1 TO I - 1 

90 IF MID$(X$,J,1) <> "."THEN NEXT J 

100 IF J+D< = l THEN N=J-l-D:GOTO 130 

no IF J+D = l THEN N=J-l-l:GOTO 160 

120 IF J -f- D > I - 1 THEN N = J -I- 2: GOTO 190 

130 W$ = LEFTS (X$,N) + MID$ (X$,l) 

150 PRINT W$:GOTO 20 

160 Y$ = LEFT$(X$,N)+MID$(X$,I)-I-S1$ 

180 PRINT Y$:GOTO 20 

190 Z$ = LEFT$(X$,N)+MID$(X$,I)-|-S2$ 

210 PRINT Z$:GOTO 20 

220 DATA 12.34, 123.4, 1234.567, 1234.500 

230 DATA 1523.1, 16344.0 

When you run this program, this is what 
you will see : 

12.34 

123.40 

1234.57 

1234.50 

1523.10 

16344.00

data, you can see that the program add- 
ed a zero or two as required and a decl-

mal point If needed. Rounding off of the 
data was accomplished In line 40. 

Now the next problem is to print the 
output so that the decimal points are 
aligned vertically. Right? 

Easy ! Just add the next three lines to 
your program. 

UO HTAB(20-IEN(W$)) 
170 HTAB{20-LEN(Y$)) 
200 HTAB(20-LEN(Z$))

The location of the column of num- 
bers is determined by HTAB In lines 140, 
170, 200. Note that the HTAB number de- 
termines the right-hand location of your 
printout. Read the next sentence slowly. 
To change the horizontal location of the 
printout, change the HTAB number In all 
three lines, got It? 

To use this subroutine in your pro- 
grams, do the following: 

1. Delete lines 30, 220,230 

2. Write 10 goto SOO 

3. Start your program with line 300 

4. In your program just prior to print- 
ing of variable, set X = to your variable 
and then write gosub 20 

5. In lines 150, 180, 210, change goto 20 
to return 

Do these step by step and you will be suc- 
cessful.

One Man's Meat 

The review of Utopia Graphics Tablet 
Software correctly pointed out the inade- 
quacies of the Utopia manual, but it 
failed to mention anything about the se- 
rious bugs in the programs. Indeed, Ap- 
ple Computer was aware of this when 
they withdrew the original version of Uto- 
pia and replaced it with "version 01." Un- 
fortunately, this new version is also de- 
fective. And my contacts with represen- 
tatives of Apple confirm the fact that 
they are aware of its bugs. 

For prospective buyers — ^the anima- 
tion routine is highly erratic In its perfor- 
mance. It does not store the number of 
sequences specified in the manual and 
out-of -memory messages occur unex- 
pectedly, with no way of saving the work 
already done. Unanticipated Illegal quan- 
tity or bad subscript error messages oc- 
cur frequently for no apparent reason. 
Saving sequences on disk is extremely 
hazardous — previously saved sequences 
or an entire disk may be wiped out In the 
process of saving the most recent set of 
sequences. The Director Fix routine 
does not function at all. 

The Paintbox routine also has a seri- 



ous flaw. The sketch mode and line plot 
mode are not compatible with each other. 
There is no way, for example, to trace a 
drawing attached to the graphics tablet 
using both of these as extensions of each 
other. 

It Is unfortunate that the Utopia 
Graphics Tablet program was released 
without careful performance evaluation. 
It Is even more disturbing when Softalk 
falls to mention serious defects In the 
operation of the product. 
Lester Blum, Hamilton, NY 

I can never remember having seen a 
more shortsighted, shallower re^ew than 
that given to the Utopia Graphic Tablet 
Software package. I sat transfixed for 
two solid hours while the author demon- 
strated feature after feature of what can 
only be termed the most comprehensive 
graphics package on the market today 
for producing still Images. And (and!) It 
has an animation mode for kicks. 

The package Is so self -learning that It 
really doesn't need (repeat, doesn't 
need) any written documentation. The 
fact that Special Delivery Software de- 
cided to give It twenty-four pages of poor 
support Is a reflection on the publisher 
(Apple), not the package. The author 
never removed his eyes from the screen 
while running through the demo because 
there was no need to. The keyboard Is al- 
most wasted (good riddance!) and the 
screen cursor moves so well that you 
simply "feel" the graphics tablet under 
your hand. 

The range and power of this system 
has to be experienced at first hand to be 
believed. The reviewer was correct In 
only one respect. It Isn't designed for six- 
year-old children. It Is designed for Intel- 
ligent adults. 

Brooke W. Boerlng, Schaumberg, IL 

One Bug Leads to Another 
I have recently discovered a very Inter- 
esting bug In the Applesoft Interpreter. 
The occurrence of this bug Is a function of 
the line number used In the program. It 
Involves using gosub In Immediate 
mode — allegedly a legal operation. 
Please see the attached listing, and try It 
yourself If you don't believe It (this was 
Doug Carlston's reaction when I men- 
tioned It to him at Broderbund's Hal- 
loween party — he Immediately kicked 
Midnight Magic off the machine and 
tried it) .

As you can see, when the first line of 
the subroutine Is 50, there is no bug. But 
when the first line number is 500, we get a 
"syntax error in 0" message. And, if the 
first line number Is 2000, then we get a 
"syntax error In 48" message! Isn't this 
the weirdest thing you've ever seen? I'd 
like to see an explanation if someone can 
find one — It probably has to do with a bug 
In Applesoft's get command. 
Bruce Zweig, Lightning Software, Palo 
Alto, CA 

Trying this, and remembering a long 
ago tip from mentor John Holler never to 
get without printing what you got, we 
tried the programs as shown, with the 
same results, then tried them with each 
get line replaced with a get,print line: 

]GET A$:PRINT A$ 

Result? Works fine. So it appears the 
mysterious bug may be in the get state- 
ment rather than the gosub. 

It's still a mystery, though. Any an- 
swers? 

Life Begins at Forty (We Know) 
I'm a novice Apple II owner and also I'm 
forty-plus years old! You'll see why I say 
that In a minute. 

This Is not only a letter to give my ap- 
preciation for a very helpful magazine 
but also tp say that when my "freeble" 
time nms out I will have no reluctance to 
continue my subscription on a paid ba- 
sis. Keep up the excellent work! 

Now the explanation. One of the most 
beneficial parts of Softalk to me has been 
the Open Discussion letters. And as an 
example I offer this letter. Being the 
greenhorn that I am I learned from 
Diane Durbeck's letter how to use the 
lower case text of my Epson printer In a 
relatively simple subroutine. The "old 
guys" can learn a lot from the young peo- 
ple If we'll Just listen. Thanks Diane.

U&LC Review 

This program in response to the article In 
February 1982 Softalk by an Intelligent 
young lady from San Jose, CA. I could 
not get her program to run on my forty- 
column printer, which has lower case ca- 
pability, and I have not lower case on my 
Apple II yet. I was intrigued by the possi- 
bility and spent a couple evenings 
brewing this one up.

I appreciated the program presented by 
Ms. Durbeck in your February 1982 issue 
on lower/upper case generation. 

Enclosed is an enhanced version of 
that program, which attempts to main- 
tain left and right margins and to avoid 
overriding when more than eighty char- 
acters are used (MX-80). 

Of course, many Improvements to 
this program can be made, but this would 
be beyond the purpose of a relatively 
simple program to print out statements 
from Applesoft Basic in lower/upper 
case.

Keep It Simple 

I am in dire need of assistance from any 
source ! ! ! 

I purchased a Mountain Computer 
RAM + 32K card on dealer recommen- 
dation then we foxind, to our chagrin, that 
the documentation is grossly incomplete 
for a nonprogrammer/neophj^e and the 
card did not include software examples 
nor any support other than a diagnostic 
of sorts. 

Current month advertising specifi- 
cally warns that "user software support" 
is required, so I must assume that others 
were also "bit"! 

I have written to the company in ques- 
tion to no avail and would appreciate any 
assistance a reader or yourself could of- 
fer with examples. 

I have an Apple II Plus with the Inte- 
ger Basic F'irmware card and dual drive 
DOS 3.3. My main support programs are 
SuperText II, CCA DMS, and VisiCalc 
plus sundry arcade games and adven- 
tures for the "others." I would like to ex- 
pand to DB Master in the near future. 

If my support (e.g. SuperText, CCA 
DMS) requires personal modifications, I 
consider the subject product to have been 
misrepresented without clear/precise 
statements of nonprovided support and 
the manufacturer to be "loose" in sup- 
port of their consumer and dealers. 

It would seem that this condition does 
exist in the Industry, but be warned that 
another "Detroit sjmdrome" does not de- 
velop into further abuses and subsequent 
losses to the originators. 

In closing, I would like to thank you 
for any and all assistance which you can 
provide and would suggest that this ques- 
tion should serve as a notice to others to 
require complete detail, not simple ad- 
vertising statements, prior to future pur- 
chases of any commodity.

Help an Enterprising Appier 

I need your advice on a modification that 
I wish to make to my Apple Writer. I am 
attempting to make some extra cash by 
selling little cards with flight informa- 
tion on them to airline pilots. I have to in- 
sert the customer's name into the for- 
mat, which works as a copjright. This 
means that to print a set of twenty cards 
for one customer, I must constantly be 



going back and forth between the editor 
and print menus. All of this results in a 
good hour to print out one set. Now my 
question. Is it possible to modify the Ap- 
ple Writer with a program that would in- 
sert the name, print it out, and go on to 
the next text with little direction from 
me? 

Eric Challgren, Sevema Park, MD 
Apple Writer Stress 

I am using the Apple Writer 1.1. My ques- 
tion concerns underlining. Is there any 
way to underline words with Apple 
Writer, short of entering a line composed 
of spaces and the - character immedi- 
ately below the line containing words to 
be underlined? 
Martin LaBar, Central, SC 

String Packing 

I am interested in a technique for con- 
verting a string to a packed character 
format. If anyone has devised a method 
to do this, I would appreciate seeing the 
technique discussed in Open Discussion.

Puzzled by Loopless Print 

I am a creator of word puzzles, as a 
means of keeping my retired husband 
and self off the poverty level of our re- 
tirement checks. 

I have a good program for my Apple 

II Plus that places words in a (iagram 
for Word Search puzzles. But we have to 
circle the words for the answer diagram 
(printed on our Epson MX-80) , by hand. I 
think our Apple must be feeling insulted 
by this snubbing of its capabilities. 

Can someone out there tell me how to 
persuade the Apple and the Epson to 
draw "circles" (loops) around the words 
in one copy of the diagram — and leave 
the other copy uncircled? The action 
needs to be automatic and not take a lot 
of extra time. I need to draw 45 to 50 loops 
to encircle that many horizontal, verti- 
cal, and diagonal words in a 15 x 16 
square of letters ; words from 3 to 11 let- 
ters in length. 

Help!

Printing Pascal 

Like Jim Burke of Iowa City in the Jan- 
uary issue, I have both an Epson printer 
and the Apple Pascal 1.1 system. I have 
used the printer successfully with both 
the Epson parallel card and the Apple 
parallel card. The only difference I find is 
that the Epson card does not require the 
use of the Linefeed program provided on 
the Apple3: diskette while the Apple card 
does. Mr. Burke's problem may be due to 
the presence of Llnefeed.code on the boot 
diskette as System.startup. Use of Line- 
feed in this way is described on pages 214- 
215 of the Pascal operating system 
manual.

which I wrote to demonstrate what I 
have learned so far about sending data to 
the printer from within a Pascal pro- 
gram, a process which I have not found 
in any of several texts on Pajscal, and 
about which another reader had asked. 

I would like to add my strokes to the 
many you have received about the maga- 
zine ; I read it avidly each time I receive 
it. 

I would like to suggest that you con- 
sider placing more focus, with regard to 
Pascal, on what is not found in the texts. 
The basic instructions you review in the 
Pascal Path have been done well else- 
where. However, I cannot find any good 
in-depth discussion of file-handling, point- 
ers, trees, etc. These would be the aretis 
that I personally would find most re- 
warding. The best text I have found, by 
Luehrmann and Peckham (from which I 
learned Pascal after having read sever- 
al other books), treats files very mini- 
mally, and pointers not at all.

Absent-Minded VisiCalc 
Help! 

I have a VisiCalc 3.3, 13-sector stor- 
age diskette that lost the Directory. 

While combining 13-sector storage 
diskettes so that I could muffin for use in 
my updated VisiCalc 16-sector version, I 
got a prompt "error; disk full." At that 
point I tried the following: 



Sequence 
/SL (NAME OF 
PROGRAM® 
THEN, 

/SL (RIGHT ARROW) 
THEN, 

/SS ("SAMPLE")® 



Prompt Response 
"FILE NOT FOUND" 



NO FILE TITLES 
"ERROR: DISK FULL" 



It seems as though the data is on the stor- 
age disk but somehow(?) the Directory is 



gone. 

Personal Software says they have no 
ideas, other than to suggest finding some- 
one who knows how to write to or has a 
program that will retitle the storage disk- 
ette for accessing purposes. 

Can you help? 

Please don't say I should have main- 
tained backups — I do and did! These 
were files I was bringing together so I 
could go to a 16-sector version. Obvious- 
ly, in retrospect, the approach could 
have been different but the damage is 
done and to reconstruct the information 
would take hours.

Remembering Darth 
Though I am sure you have heard it be- 
fore, yours is a great magazine. I have 
found that the Assembly Lines series, the 
Pascal Path series, and the product re- 
views are of invaluable aid. I am utterly 
convinced that the Hardtalk series and 
the Softcard Symposium will each in 
their turn be my favorite feature. With- 
out a doubt your magazine is essential to 
my keeping informed about the comings 
and goings in the Apple world. 

I have a question I would like to put to 
the general readership. How do you get 
lower case on a Pascal Apple? I have a 
lower case board, sold by Pygfmy Pro- 
gramming, which uses the shift keys 
(without the Dan Paymar modification) 
and it works well in Applesoft and Inte- 
ger Basic. However, no matter what I do 
I can't seem to get lower case in Pascal. 
By the way, for Applesoft and Integer, 
Mr. Samson has removed the masking 
imposed by the F-8 ROM which bumps 
all the keyboard characters to upper- 
case. 

On another note, I would like to add 
my two bits about your advertising. I 
don't have any children and am not an 
overly moral person, yet I would like 
your magazine to remain a tasteful pub- 
lication. Ads which utilize excessive sex- 
uality are degrading and beneath the 
level of most Apple users. That is at least 
my opinion, take it for what it is worth. 

I have had my checkbook open now 
since January waiting to write you folks 
a check. As of yet I have received no re- 
newal notice and am apprehensive that I 
will miss out on one of your superb maga- 
zines. If I owe you folks for subscription 
costs please let me know. 

I frequently comment to my friends 
on the rapid growth and popularity of 
your magazine. I would have never 
guessed that the little Darth Vader 
magazine would become the mouthpiece 
for all of Apple. Your magazine is so good 
I have dropped my subscription to Byte. 
Please keep up the good work, and re- 
flect upon the nature of your readership. 
Lt. Tommy C. Gray, Flagstaff, AZ 

Tipster and Friend 

In my quest to find a better and ecusier 
way to format REM statements, I dis- 



covered that a poke 33,28 before typing 
the REM and then a poke 33, W (or 
TEXT) after the REM has been entered 
results in a perfect vertical format for 
more than one line in a REM statement. 
This makes for nicer looking listings, and 
it is easier to find sections of a program 
under construction. 

This tip of the week is presented free 
of charge to all Apple owners and read- 
ers of Softalk magazine, courtesy of one 
little-known employee of the Byte Shop of

Try VHF 10, 11, or 12 

I would like to inject the output of my Ap- 
ple to bypass the RF stage of my Heath 
kit TV set. Since my UHF reception is 
very poor and I think it is the fault of the 
UHF tuner, I was hoping I could get 
much better display than I now can with 
the Sup-R-Mod 11 on channel 33. 

Every time I try, the output transis- 
tor on the Apple overloads and I have to 
replace it. It seems like either an imped- 
ance mismatch or I'm just injecting in 
the wrong places. Can anyone help me?

Not Talking 

As a newcomer to the computer game, I 
wanted a way to give myself both the 
ASCII codes and the hexldecimal codes 
for the keyboard characters. Richard A. 
Patton, in the January Open Discussion, 
gave me a start. I combined his conver- 
sion program with one I had developed 
and came up with a program that lists 
ASCII codes, hexldecimal equivalents 
and keyboard characters.

The Pom Is Green 

Since Softalk will no longer be mailed 
free to Apple owners, I think it is time 
you settled once and for all the contro- 
versy over "adult" ads. Even those who 
recognize your right to publish such ads 
might react differently when asked to 
subsidize them. 

The central question is whether Sof- 
talk wishes to be a magazine for ^he en- 
tire family or one which is intended only 
for adults with a liberal outlook. The de- 
bate is not over whether these ads should 
be published, but whether Softalk is the 
appropriate forum. We must recogfnize 
that we are members of a profession 
which over the next decade will have a 
profound impact on the lives of ordinary 
people. Just as we expect those involved 
with nuclear power to act in a responsi- 
ble fashion, so must we give serious 
thought to the proper use of our talents 
and abilities. 

Our society provides many outlets for 
those who have needs which are objec- 
tionable to the average citizen. If you feel 
an outlet for adult material is needed in 



20 



APRIL 1982 



the computer industry, I suggest you set 
up a sister publication (a \a. Softline) with 
a separate subscription fee, and let the 
marketplace decide. 

Those who cry loudest about freedom 
of speech are inevitably members of un- 
popular minorities who wish to impose 
their views upon the majority. In times 
past the question of minority rights has 
been settled by civil war, legal contro- 
versy, and social upheaval — I hope that 
we can resolve the current situation with- 
out recourse to any of the above. 
Barry Jedrick, Lutherville, MD 

I feel that I must object to the recent ad- 
vertisements in Softalk which are pro- 
moting the sale of erotic exploration, 
hardcore software, sexplosion and The 
Dirty Book, Softpom, and other things 
found therein. By the very words used 
these companies seem to be advertising 
and selling hardcore and pornographic 
software, in my personal opinion. 

Since Softalk is freely distributed to 
all owners of Apple computers in the 
USA, and has a wide distribution else- 
where, I infer that such ads, and perhaps 
even some of this software, is getting into 
the hands of children. On the second page 
before a sexplosion and Dirty Book ad is 
an ad entitled "Prepare them (children) 
for their future" (much better stuff) . . . 
but how ironical! I raise the question 
whether or not you would like this stuff to 
fall into our children's hands. Young 
teens have enough problems these days 
in struggling to live by a sound value sys- 
tem without being exploited by the quick 
buck and pornographic salespersons. 
And I hope this is not the case. I presume 
that this magazine is not competing (and 
does not need to) with Playboy. More- 
over I fear that a next step will be the in- 
clusion of software such as this, referred 
to above, in electronic games centers if 
such people as are advertising in your 
January issue (and some of your pre- 
vious issues) have their way. Is this what 
we want? Is this what you want? Your 
magazine can do just as well without this 
stuff. 

Speaking personally, but as a com- 
puter professional and as a member of 
the IEEE Computer Society Education- 
al Activities Board and formerly chair- 
person of the Computer Society Educa- 
tion Committee, I feel that it is my re- 
sponsibility to take a leadership role and 
make comments regarding the use of 
computers and software in a way that 
goes against the grain of many value sys- 
tems (such as my own, for example) in 
our country. 

I realize that you have the legal free- 
dom to at present publish this somewhat 
questionable stuff, but I am appealing to 
you as publisher and as one who must 
care about what gets into the hands of our 
children to refrain. By doing so I do not 
think you will lose the patrons you want. 
Let us work together to insure a prece- 
dent of quality and value in the kinds of 



programs that our children use. 

Feel free to circulate an exact copy 
of this letter if you wish. 
David C. Rine, Macomb, IL 

The Dirty Book is a catalog, a takeoff 
on The Book ; Softporn is a well-done text 
adventure that is not pornographic; 
Street Life, which we have not seen, we 
are assured is similar to Softpom; and 
the rest are compilations of suggestions 
that would have no meaning to anyone 
who was not already familiar, first-hand, 
with what the suggestions were intended 
to enhance. Interlude, incidentally, is be- 
ing used by several psychiatrists in vari- 
ous parts of the country as an adjunct to 
marital counseling. 

There is pornographic software; its 
advertising has long since been rejected 
by Softalk. 

As the media service organization for the 
University of Michigan's School of Edu- 
cation and Library Science, we house the 
computer resource lab which includes 
many current computer periodicals. 

When we received your magazine for 
the first time last week, we looked for- 
ward to having another valuable re- 
source for software location and acquisi- 
tion. Instead we found print that was dif- 
ficult to read, reviews that were rather 
shallow, and so many ads that they over- 
whelmed the substantial and sometimes 
interesting content of your articles. 

Even more concern to us was your ac- 
ceptance of ads utilizing a woman as an 
enticement to sell a product totally unre- 
lated to her presence. 

An example would be the Howard 
Software Service's ad selling their crea- 
tive financing program. We found this ad 
to be sexist, degrading to the increasing 
number of women in the computer field, 
and to a sizable number of men for whom 
these ads are insulting and ineffective. 
This tactic of advertising is counterpro- 
ductive and totally unnecessary to the 
marketing of this product. 

We understand the need to attract 
revenue for yoiu* publishing venture, but 
strongly urge you to develop a selection 
policy that does not allow advertise- 
ments which insult and degrade female 
persons.

I wanted to say a couple of words about 
all the hubbub on the "filthy" ads in your 
magazine. I. really don't understand 
where these people are coming from (the 
eighteenth century maybe). It seems 
quite simple that if the people that are of- 
fended by these ads feel so about them 
they should just cut those ads out or black 



them out with Marks-a-lot. Being a fa- 
ther myself, I do wish to protect the inno- 
cence of my child; however, the first 
place to start is at school since most of 
the kids from fifth grade on know more 
than you'd expect. Protecting your kids 
from ads of the above-mentioned variety 
doesn't stop the kids from spreading the 
word around. The parent just has to ex- 
plain the things that go on in our society, 
not hide the fact that it happens.

For the Love of Mike 
OK . . . now you've done it ! With the War 
and Peace letters opening the Open Dis- 
cussion feature in the February Softalk, 
you've incurred my wrath, too. I, too, 
have children who read Softalk; my 
daughters who are eleven and thirteen 
both peruse your publication with vary- 
ing Interests. How dare you publish such 
filth as the Softpom and The Dirty Book 
ads? I decided to check the February Is- 
sue to see just how much you have be- 
come purveyors of smut! 

Inside front cover — naked thigh of 
rider exposed . . . shame! I won't men- 
tion the implication of the beast's ex-

mention the garish exploitation of sex on 
pagre five (Freud's teachings about phal- 
lic symbols aren't beyond you, are 
they?). The depiction of the tank's can- 
non ejaculating Is untainted smut! (I like 
those oxymorons!) I could complain 
about the bawdy language In page eight 
"tools," the nakedness of the alien on 
page thirteen, and so on; I can't bring 
myself to look at such a welter of lascivi- 
ous vilification ! Page forty-four's shot of 
a beaver is shocking, but the nakedness 
of page sixty-five is even more offen- 
sive ! The frontal nudity (both topless and 
bottomless) of those computers not prop- 
erly attired is appalling! 

Finally, I have to admit that this little 
foray has taught me something. We all 
know that the apple caused man's fall 
from (jod's grace . . . the apple is widely 
recognized £us the fruit of the Forb\M,en 
Tree of Knowledge! Touching an apple is 
much the equivalent of fondling . . . um 
. . . things which are "dirty"! I now real- 
ize that I must sell my computer system. 
Not only has it helped me learn, but, may 
God forgive me, it has been something 
which I have embraced in moments of 
sickness and in health, in joy and in sor- 
row; yet it is the epitome of all evil! 

In a more serious vein, just in case it 
isn't apptu-ent, I write to point out what 
you already know; you'll be damned if 
you do (accept and publish such ads as 
have caused this seeming controversy) 
and you'll be damned if you don't! For 
what it's worth, the models and poses 
used in the Howeurdsoft ads have, with- 
out exception, aroused me far more than 
those used in the Softpom or The Dirty

avoid controversy, don't use any words, 
either. The suggestivlty of words and

broach! 

If you want a vote from one who in-

A Delicious Apple 



I thought you might be interested in a re- 
cent birthday cake which consisted of an 
almost life-size Apple n replica com- 
plete with Monitor. My wife, Luana, had 
it made for my fortieth birthday, com- 
plete with simulated wake for my "pass- 



ing." The cake was delicious as well as a 
big hit with those in attendance. 

The theme was picked due to my hav- 
ing an Apple n here at school as well as 
one at home.

contemplating a byte 

Robots are here and they are changing the world we live in. From bulky induatrial 
welders to tantastically complex planetary probes, robots are sure to make our lives a little 
easier. Robots will get much more sophisticated in the decades to come; by the next cen- 
tury they may be our model citizens. 

But will robots be immune from the human weaknesses that usually attend a high level 
of intelligence? On the cover of our August 1981 issue we fantasized what a humanold robot 
may look like in the future. We also gave this highly developed mechanical man the hard- 
est task we could devise — contemplating an object and its significance. 

Will robots ever be able to sit and think about something that is not directly related to 
performing a task? 

Softalk can't answer that question for you, but we can help you contemplate the un- 
known future in a special way. We commissioned graphics artist Robert Zraick to do 
August's cover with a poster in mind. The robot contemplating a bite is evocative both of 
Rodin's The Thinker and the Genesis passage on the Garden of Eden . . . not to mention the 
possible significance to our favorite technological fruit. 

The artist and Softalk are sharing in the profits from the poster. Softalk will distribute 
its proceeds to individuals developing Apple tools to help.lhe handicapped. Softalk guaran- 
tees 100 percent distribution of its monies. ^\ 

In addition to the posters, which are sold at $6.00 (plus |1.B0 to cover shipping and han- 
dling) , some of the two hundred artist's proofs, signed by Robert Zraick, are still available 
at $76 each. 

The size of the poster is 24 inches by 34 inches. The artist's proofs are hand-numbered and 
hand-signed, and each is accompanied by a certificate giving its number and guarantee- 
ing that only 200 are being distributed. 

Robert Zralck's art will grace any computer room, and your purchase will help others 
become more self-sufficient.

Last month we illustrated the column with a couple of short 
programs that incorporated new programming techniques as 
well as new vocabulary. Here is one of them: 

10 HGR:X = PEEK (49234) 
20 X = 140:Y = 96 

30 HCOLOR= 3 ^- 

40 HPLOT X,Y 

50 X = X - 5 + RND{1) * 10 

60 Y = Y - 5 + RND(l) * 10 

70 IF X >=0 AND X < = 279 and Y >=0 AND Y <=191 THEN 130 

80 IF X < 0 THEN X = X + 279 

90 IF X > 279 THEN X = X - 279 

100 IF Y < 0 THEN Y = Y + 191 

110 IF Y > 191 THEN Y = Y - 191 

120 GOTO 40 

130 HPLOT TO X,Y 

140 GOTO 50 

This time we want to focus on programming style rather 
than on vocabulary. However, there are a few new words 
you'll need to know, so here they are : 




We want to talk first about documenting a program so that 
your code will be useful to you later on when those flashes of in- 
tuition that brought it about in the first place have faded into 
the dusty recesses of your brain. 

Enter the short listing from last month. To make this pro- 
gram as easy to understand a year from now as it is at this mo- 
ment, it would be useful if we were able to comment on the pur- 
pose of each line or group of lines and to save our remarks 
along with the program. The remark statement is designed for 
this purpose. When your Apple comes across the three letters 
REM, it understands that the rest of the program line is pure 
comment, included for the benefit of humans rather than of 
computers. So let's add the following lines to the listing: 

5 REM TURN ON HI-RES GRAPHICS 

15 REM ♦*• SET INITIAL VARIABLE VALUES 

35 REM *♦* PLOT STARTING POINT FOR A LINE 

45 REM **♦ SELECT NEW VALUES FOR X AND Y 

65 REM **♦ TEST & MODIFY X,Y VALUES IF NOT ON SCREEN 

115 REM **♦ IF OFF SCREEN, JUMP TO 40 TO START NEW LINE 

125 REM OTHERWISE CONTINUE CURRENT LINE 

Now list the program. The remarks set off the program seg- 
ments so we can focus on particular ones more readily. 

Let's take a longer look at lines 50 and 60. These lines select 
new values for X and Y. X started at 140, which is halfway 
across the screen, and Y started at 96, which is halfway down 
(see line 20) . To make the line move randomly in any direc- 
tion, X and Y need to change by an uncertain amount in either 
direction. In other words, we want to add or subtract nimibers 
at random from both X and Y. If we choose a random num- 
ber between zero and ten and add it to X, X will always get 
larger. However, if we subtract 5 from X and then add a ran- 
dom number between 0 and 10 to X, X may get larger or 
smaller depending on whether or not the random number 



chosen is larger than 5. 

To illustrate what would happen if we didn't adjust X and Y 
downward before adding the random values, try changing 
lines 50 and 60 to read like this : 

50 X = X + RND(l) * 10 
60 Y = Y + RND(l) ♦ 10 

We can modify this section of the program in many ways to 
get different resvQts. Try subtracting 4 from X instead of 5 and 
see what happens. Or even better, let's attach paddles to the 
computer so we can control the computer's walk. 

To see how paddles work, temporarily add a new line 1 to 
the program. It isn't necessary to erase the rest of the pro- 
gram by typing net/;— that would just make for a lot of addi- 
tional work. Just type in the following line : 

1 PRINT PDL(O), PDL(l): GOTO 1 

Make sure that your paddles are properly plugged in and 
then type run. Two columns of numbers should appear. The 
one on the left gives the reading of paddle zero and the one on 
the right gives the paddle one reading. As you turn the dials 
you should see the numbers change. (This will also give you a 
chance to experiment with one of the bugs in the Apple, by the 
way. If you turn paddle zero down toward zero, high readings 
of paddle one can go strange. Entering a short time-delay be- 
tween the two paddle reads usually corrects the problem.) As 
you see, the numbers range from 0 to 255. 

Now break into the program with control-C and remove line 
1. Next let's type replacement lines for 50 and 60 that use the 
paddle readings rather than random numbers to figure out 
where to draw: 

50 X = PDL(O) 
60 Y = PDL(l) 

When you run this version, you'll find that you have a ver- 
sion of that old toy E<tch-a-Sketch. Not a very satisfactory one, 
however. Sometimes the program draws smooth lines, but lots 
of times it jumps around and seems to draw at rcuidom. What 
can we do about this? 

As we noted, the paddles return values between 0 and 255. 
This means that we are setting our X and Y values to this 
range. That's just about right for the X, but it really won't do 
for the Y. Whenever Y is set to a value greater than 192, the 
program tries to plot a point off the bottom edge of the screen. 
The trap on line 110 catches this and attempts to correct the 
problem. However, we can avoid the whole problem by scal- 
ing our paddle responses so that the 0-255 range of the paddles 
is converted to 0-279 for X and 0-191 for Y. The following lines 
will scale the responses correctly: 

50 X = PDL(O) * 279/255 
60 Y = PDL(l) ♦ 191/255 

As a test, try to figure out in your head the values of X and 
Y when the paddles are set to their low and high positions.

APRIL 1982 



Go ahead and save the etch-a-sketch program if you like 
and then restore the program to Its original and highly ran- 
dom condition so we can take a look at the next section. When 
we were getting the values of X and Y from the random num- 
ber generator, we needed to check and make sure that the 
values didn't stray beyond the acceptable ranges. Line 70 test- 
ed both X and Y for high and low acceptable values ; if both 
variables passed their tests, control was passed to line 130, 
which plotted a line and returned for new values. If somebody 
flunked the test the intervening lines fig^Jre out why and 
remedy the situation. 

There are a lot of ways to keep the values within the ac- 
ceptable range. The simplest way is a line like this: 

70 IF X < 0 THEN X = 0 

In other words, if the random number generator tried to 
make X too small, we could just bring it up to the minimum ac- 
ceptable value and leave it there imtil it headed back into the 
positive range. What we actually did, however, is a little more 
interesting. If X went below zero, we added 279 to it. This had 
the effect of moving it from the far left side of the screen to the 
far right side, a feature that is often called tvrap-around. The 
other three test lines provided wrap-around on the other three 
sides of the rectangle. Naturally, if we are going to shift either 
X or Y to the opposite side of the screen, we had better start 
plotting an entirely new line (that's why we jump to line 40 in- 
stead of 130) — If we didn't we'd get a connecting line drawn all 
the way across the screen from the previous X,Y value. 

Page Flipping. One of the questions that comes up almost 
as soon as people start using graphics is how to mix graphics 
and text on the same screen. Unfortunately, the answer is no- 
where near as easy aa the question. The easiest way to mix 
text and graphics is, of course, to do your graphics at the top of 
the page and put all of yoiir text on the four lines at the bottom. 

Some enterprising souls have inquired whether or not one 
couldn't write the text on the text page, draw the graphics on 
one of the graphics pages, and then flip very rapidly between 
them so that the eye mixed them up. You ought to be able to 
write a program by now that does exactly that, so please give it 
a try on your own before examining the following example : 

10 HOME: VTAB 14; HTAB 10: PRINT "SOMETHING SPECIAL" 
20 HGR : HCOLOR= 3: HPLOT 55, 1 00 TO 1 90, 1 00 TO 190, 120 TO 55, 120 
TO 55, 100 

30 POKE 49233, 0: POKE 49232, 0: GOTO 30 

Easy enough to see why this technique isn't very popular, 
isn't it? There are a couple of other approaches that actually 
do work. Both involve drawing characters on one of the hi-res 
screens ; with perseverance, we will soon come to know enough 
to do this. 

Input Routines. Now it's time to turn away from the Ap- 
ple's rainbow splendors and learn something practical once 
again. The computer provides many ways of manipulating and 
displaying data, but first you have to get your data into the ma- 
chine. There are lots of ways to do this. You can make your da- 
ta part of the computer program you are writing (which Is fine 
as long £is it won't ever change) , you can key it in at the time 
you run your program, or you can read it in from data files that 
you have previously written and saved onto tape or floppy 
disk. 

The simplest way to see that your data gets into the ma- 
chine is to build that data program. Take a look at the follow- 
ing example : 

10 READ NAME$,NUMBER 

20 DATA MICHAEL SMITH,4992 

30 HOME : PRINT "DEAR "NAMES":" 

40 PRINT: PRINT " YOUR NUMBER IS "NUMBER"." 

The read statement causes the program to look for a line 
that starts with the word data. It then tries to assign the first 
piece of data in the data statement to the first variable in the 



read statement. Please note that it is very important that the 
variable "type" match the data type. Let's try two experi- 
ments. First, replace line 20 with the following line: 

20 DATA 4992,4992 

The program will run perfectly. The string variable 
NAME$ doesn't care whether you try to feed it alphabetical or 
numerical data; it can handle both. Now try running the pro- 
gram with the following line 20: 

20 DATA MICHAEL,SMITH 

You will get a syntax error, since the variable number can 
only accept numerical data (remember, string variables 
always end in a dollar sign) . Note that individual data items 
are separated by commas. This could be a nuisance if your da- 
ta entry includes a comma. Here's how to get around the 
problem : 

20 DATA "JONES, DEACON",4992 

The second way to get your data into your program is to key 
it in from the keyboard at the time you nin your program. 
These keyboard input routines come in several shapes and fla- 
vors, each with its advantages and disadvantages. The easiest 

to use is input. 

10 HOME: PRINT "WHAT IS YOUR NAME";: INPUT NAMES 
20 INPUT "AND YOUR NUMBER",NUMBER 

These are two acceptable ways of using the input statement. In 
line 10, the input command wOl cause a question mark to be 
printed and will then accept your response. In line 20, the input 
command will print your message, enclosed in quotes, instead 
of its usual question mark. Note that in the second case the 
message must be separated from the variable name by a semi- 
colon. Either form can accept more than one variable at a 
time. An acceptable alternative to the above is: 

10 HOME: INPUT "PLEASE GIVE NAME AND NUMBER, SEPARATED BY A 
COMMA: ";NAMES,NUMBER 

One nice thing about the input command is that if you ac- 
cidentally type a word where you should have typed a num- 
ber, it does not bomb your program with that awful syntax er- 
ror message. Instead, it merely types a question mark, fol- 
lowed by the word reenter. If you ^ve it fewer responses than 
it expects, it will prompt you with a question mark and pa- 
tiently wait for you to finish giving it the rest of your data. If 
you give it three pieces of data when it only expects two, it will 
warn you that you are off the track by printing extra ignored 
on the screen. Not very polite, perhaps, but right to the point. 

Input does have its limitations, however. You cannot pre- 
vent it from printing your response to the screen, you cannot 
do other processing while you wait for the keyboard response 
(such as updating a clock) , and you must always terminate 
your entry by pressing the return key, an extra keystroke that 
might better be avoided at times. 

Applesoft has a second command that addresses two of 
these problems. Get waits until a single keystroke has been 
made, at which time the program immediately continues on to 
the next instruction. See this example: 

10 HOME: VTAB 10: HTAB 10: PRINT"CHOOSE ONE:" 
20 PRINT: PRINTTAB(14)"A) LIFE" 
30 PRINTTAB(14)"B) DEATH" 
40 PRINTTAB(14)"C) DITHER" 
50 PRINT: GETAS 

60 IFA$ = "A" THEN PRINT"SO BE IT.":STOP 

70 IFA$ = "B" THEN PRINT"PLEASE RECONSIDER.":STOP 

80 IFA$ = "C" THEN PRINT"TOUGH CHOICE, ISN'T IT?":GOTO50 
90 PRINT: PRINT"PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS":PRINT" & TRY 
AGAIN." 



APRIL 1982

100 GOTO 50 

There are a couple of problems with the get command. 
First, it is a pain in the neck to use if the data you are trying to 
enter is more than one character long. Second, you can't use 
control-C to regain control of your computer anymore (try it) . 
Third, it still doesn't allow the computer to wander off and do 
other tasks while waiting for the slow human who is punching 
the keyboard to come up with another brilliant selection. 

Taking care of the second objection is pretty trivial. Add the 
following line to the program : 



85 



IFA$ = CHR$(3) THEN PRINT"TRYING TO STOP ME, HUH?' 
GOTO 50 



CHR$(x) stands for character x. Every character you can 
type from the Apple keyboard (and several that you can't) has 
a number, called an ASCII number. These are listed in Appen- 
dix K of your Applesoft book. CHR$(3) is exactly the same as 
control-C. 

There's a third input routine in your Apple. This one may 
seem pretty esoteric, but it's absolutely the only way to go if 
you are trying to enter data real-time. Let's list it first and get 
to the gory details after:

AMHOUR = HOUR - 12 * (HOUR > 12): VTAB 1: HTAB 19: 
PRINT " "AMHOUR":"MINUTE" "HR$" DAY fDAYiRETURN 



Please ignore the clock routine for now, unless you delight 
in working your way through convoluted logic. Let's focus in- 
stead on the input routine in lines 20 and 30. 

Address 49152 in the Apple always contains the ASCII code 
of the last key pressed plus 128. You can reset this address to 
zero by poking a different address, 49168. We did this in the 
first line of our program. In line 20 we first peeked 49152 to see 
if any key had been pressed. As long as the value of this ad- 
dress is less than 128, we know that no key has been pressed. 
Therefore, we can increment our timer (called minute) and 
jump to a subroutine at line 100 that displays a clock in the up- 
per right comer of the screen. We'll come back to subroutines 
next month. For the moment, suffice it to say that gosub is 
similar to the goto statement in that it (temporarily) transfers 
program control to a different line number, then returns from 
whence it came. 

If any key is pressed, the value stored in 49152 will immedi- 
ately change to the ASCII value of whatever was pressed, plus 
128. We have stored the value of this address in the variable we 
call key, so key will now have some value greater than 128 the 
moment the keyboard is touched. 

Line 30 takes the value of key and subtracts that extra 128 
from it. It then sets the string variable LTER$ (short for LET- 
TER$) equal to the character described by the ASCII value 
(key), clears the address 49152 to zero, prints LTER$, and re- 
turns to line 20 to wait for another character. 

That's a lot of new concepts in a very short space, and some 
of them don't really seem to make a lot of sense. Why, for in- 
stance, do you poke one address in order to clear a completely 
different one to zero? Beats me. The important thing to re- 
member is that even though you own your Apple, your Apple 
still makes the rules. A sobering thought to end this month's 
discussion.

Though it is very simple to use, the Dithertizer II represents 
the ultimate in video digitizing using the Apple II 
computer. The Dithertizer Is an interface card which 
converts video input into digitized images. Because the 
Dithertizer II is a frame grabber, DMA type digitizer, it 
offers extreme high speed in the conversion process (it 
grabs an entire frame in 1/60th of a second). The camera 
supplied with the pacl<age is the Sanyo model VC1610X. 
Cabling is supplied for this camera so as to have the 
Dithertizer II system up and running in minutes. The video 
camera used for input must have external sync to allow 
for the frame grabber technology employed for digitizing. 
If a camera other than the model recommended is used, 
wiring adaptations by the user may be required. Software 
is supplied with the board to allow you to display up to 64 
pseudo grey levels on your Apple's screen. The number 
of grey levels may be changed with one keystroke. The 
intensity and contrast of the image are controllable via 
game paddles. Also supplied is software for Image 
contouring for those interested in movement detection 
or graphic design applications. 



The Dithertizer II package Is available ready 
to run with camera, Interface card and 
the software described above for only: 



$650.

ALL YOU NEED TO EXTEND 
YOUR APPLESOFT BASIC. 

APPLE SPICE is a set of fast, 
assembly language routines that alleviate 
Sonne of the drudgery of writing programs 
in Applesoft BASIC. APPLE SPICE allows 
you to concentrate more on your program 
logic and less on things like "prettifying" 
the screen and detecting keyboard entry 
errors. APPLE SPICE also greatly ex- 
pands Applesoft's capabilities by adding 
features found in many larger BASICS 
such as PRINT USING, STRING SEARCH 
(INSTR), IF-THEN-ELSE, and LINE INPUT.

Bert Kersey bought himself a new toy about three years 
ago. When it began talking back to him loith the very kind of 
curiosity and humor he offered to it, he knew his Apple was 
more than a toy. Kersey claims to have established Beagle 
Bros a year and a half ago, but one look at its ads (the origi- 
nals of which arrive slightly yellowed and wrapped in 1906 
newspapers) makes it obvious that Beagle Bros has been 
around much, much longer than that. In fact, it's rumored that 
the microcomputer was inspired by a Beagle Bros ad for a 
hand-cranked foot massage and back exercise machine that 
was shaped just like an Apple II. 

In truth, Kersey creates all his ovm ads, a, carry-over from 
his pre-Apple occupation as a graphic designer. Acttially, truth 
ha^ little to do with it; Kersey, definitely the dominant brother 
of Beagle Bros, has no brother. He and Sharon, his wife, run 
the company. He does, however, have a beagle, Sophie, and 
that has made all the difference. Kersey insists that the beagle 
is not an officer of the company, nor can she type, nor is she re- 
lated to Kersey, certainly not as a brother. 

We have our doubts. 

Nevertheless, we hope you'll enjoy DOStalk by Bert Ker- 
sey (or Sophie the beagle). 



Hello out there. Over the next few months, we're going to 
explore Apple's Disk Operating System, find out what makes it 
work, and learn how to make it work the way we want (yes, 
you can teach old DOS new tricks). We'll ajssume you own a 
copy of the 3.3 Manual and already understand the bajsics of 
loading and saving files and so on. With that knowledge and a 
little creative peeking, poking, and probing, you can really 
have some fun. Let's get on with it. 

What Is DOS? DOS is actually a complex high-speed ma- 
chine-language program that is inserted into your Apple's 
memory when you boot a disk. Without DOS (rhymes with 
boss, by the way, not gross), an Apple simply does not know 
how to perform any function that involves a disk. Let's prove It 
with an experiment or two; read or type along. 

First, let's create a DOS-less Apple. Assuming you have a 
normal Apple Plus with Applesoft built in, power up with no 
disk in drive 1. After a whir or two from your drive, hit reset. 
The motor will stop, and you will see the Applesoft prompt (]) 
and a flashing cursor. Now type in a short program and run It 
just to prove that your Apple still works. How about this little 
goodie : 

10 GOTO 20 SCRN( -I- > COLOR = OR 

AT READ AT THEN INT COLOR= 

THEN > INT NEW (sic) 
20 HOME: FOR I = 2056 to 2070: 

PRINT CHR$(PEEK(I));: NEXT 

The point here is that you've still got a real Apple computer 
sitting there in front of you, even without disks and disk drives. 



Basic commands and procedures work exactly the same with- 
out DOS as with, but the 28 DOS commands like catalog and 
FP and init hello, not to mention print CHR$(U); bload Hopa- 
long Cassidy won't get you anything but the dreaded (beep!) 
"syntax error," Apple's way of saying "Huh?" You won't even 
be able to scrounge up a DOS error message. "File not found," 
for example, is nowhere to be found. And you'll never see "syn- 
tax error" without a leading question mark. 

You can, however, enter complex programs into memory 
and edit and run them. You can save and load programs too, 
but only to and from cassette (an ancient recording device not 
fully understood today). You can perform all the usual com- 
puter calculations and screen tricks but, without DOS, there is 
no way to save a program to disk, catalog, write text files, or 
do anything that involves your disk drive or system. 

So much for the DOS-less Apple. Now stick in a disk and 
boot DOS with a PR^6. Booting actually transfers the DOS pro- 
gram from your disk into your Apple's memory. DOS normal- 
ly remains in memory as long as your Apple is on; hmction- 
ing, but unchanged by anything you ordinarily do — program- 
ming, loading, saving, deleting, and so on. Booting Is neces- 
sary to install DOS into memory where you can use It. The 
word boot, by the way, was probably invented by the same 
group that thought up muffin. 

Now, with DOS in memory (RAM) , and Applesoft or Inte- 
ger in memory (ROM) , your Apple knows two sets of com- 
mands and error messages, DOS and Basic. When you enter 
an instruction through the keyboard, the Apple checks It first 
to see if it is a DOS command, then to see if it is a Bajsic com- 
mand. If you type the word wowso, for example, the Apple 
checks its entire twenty-eight word DOS command vocabu- 
lary one-by-one (words Uke catalog, delete, rename) to see If It 
knows wowso. Since it doesn't, it then checks Its Bajiic com- 
mand vocabulary (words like list, gosub, next, poke) . When it 
doesn't find wowso there either, it gives up and prints "?syn- 
tax error" (Applesoft) or "*** syntax err" (Integer). 

If it thinks you made a DOS typo (for example, if you typed 
catalogg, the Apple prints "syntax error" (the DOS version 
with no question mark) . If your Apple does know the word you 
have typed, it executes the command according to the instruc- 
tions that reside in memory, either DOS or Basic, depending on 
where the command was found. All of the above takes ap- 
proximately no time at all (and sometimes a little less). 

Peeking at DOS's Vocabulary. In 48K Apples, EHDS nor- 
mally occupies memory locations $9600 (38400) through 
$BFFF (49151). You can look at DOS or any part of memory 
from Basic with peek commands. To find the value at location 
43380, in the middle of DOS, for example, type: 

PRINT PEEK(43380) 

No line number is necessary; Just type the command and hit 
return. The Apple should answer with a 76. To find the equiva- 
lent ASCII character at that location, tjrpe: 



PRINT CHR$(PEEK{43380)) 

The above command should produce an L. Clear memory by 
typing new or FP, and run this program : 

10 FOR X = 43380 TO 43401 
20 PRINT CHR${PEEK(X)); 
30 NEXT X 

You should see a "language not available" message on the 
screen. You have uncovered DOS's first error message! 
Change Line 10 to: 

10 FOR X = 43380 TO 43581 

and you are presented with all fourteen DOS error messages 
strung together. To further examine this mysteriousness, add 
two more lines to your program: 

15 NORMAL: IF PEEK(X)>127 THEN INVERSE 
25 IF PEEK(X)> 127 THEN PRINT 

Run again, and you'll see that the last character of every error 
message appears in inverse. Line 15 makes the letter inverse if 
it has an ASCII value greater than 127. In this situation, each 
character has two possible values. The letter D, for example, 
can be represented by a 68 or a 196 ($44 or $C4) . In the error 
messages, the "high-byte" value is used to tell the Apple where 
the end of the message is. Let's scramble things temporarily; 
type this command (no line number necessary) : 

POKE 43452,68 

Now attempt to call up a nonexistent file with a LOAD ZZYZX 
command. You should get the response "file not foundvolume 
mismatch." The Apple has printed error message number 5 
starting at a designated starting point (the f in file) until it 
finds a high-bj^e character, in this case the h in volume mis- 
match, message number 6, instead of the d in found. Repair 
the damage before continuing by poking the high-byte value 
for d (196) back in where it belongs: 

POKE 43452,196 

Now change line 10 in your program to: 

10 FOR X=43140 TO 43582: If X=43272 THEN X = 43380 

This will cause the program to peek at all twenty-eight DOS 
commands and all fourteen DOS error messages. You can 
change any command or error message simply by poking in 
new values for each character. Just keep the new command or 
message the same length as the old one and remember to poke 
in the high-byte value of the last letter. More on this in future 
articles. Now, let's do a different kind of snooping. 

Poking Around in DOS. First, a warning: the following DOS 
experiments can be a bit risky, especially if you mistype a 
number or in case there's a typo in this article. Please do not 
have an irreplaceable disk in your drive while you experiment 
(and hide any disks you are fond of in the broom closet) . The 
best plan is to init a new disk for test purposes. 



IF YOU MESS UP A DISK, 
FORGET WHERE YOU READ THIS. 



Let's go into the Monitor for a minute or two to look at 
DOS's catalog routine. We promise to lead you right back out 
again. Type call -151, return, and then ADASL, return. This 



command disassembles machine language data from the Mon- 
itor starting at location $ADA3, showing you: 



ADA3- 


A9 


16 




LDA 


#$16 


ADA5- 


8D 


9D 


B3 


STA 


$B39D 


ADA8-

2F 


AE 


JSR 


$AE2F 


ADAB-

$B3AF,X 


ADB3- 


20 


ED 


FD 


JSR 


$FDED 


ADB6- 


CA 






DEX 




□ nd so on. 













Now check out the seventh line and write it down; you will 
need it later. "ADB3" is the location or address in memory 
(decimal 44467). "20 ED FD" is the command at that addresB. 
"JSR $FDED" tells that the command means "Jump to the 
SubRoutine at location $FDED" (just like a gosub in Apple- 
soft) . Now, let's be brave and cancel this command. Type : 

ADB3: EA EA EA 

Don't forget the colon after ADB3. Now look at the results by 
typing ADA3L, return. The command at ADB3 has been 
changed to: 

ADB3- EA NOP 
ADB4- EA NOP 
ADB5- EA NOP 

The three NOPs on the right stand for "No OPerate." The EAs 
(decimal 234s) you typed in have cancelled the command that 
was formerly at address $ADB3. Three EAa were used be- 
cause there were three two-digit hex numbers following the ad- 
dress number. Often there will be only one or two hex 
numbers. 

Now exit the Monitor with a control-C, return, and catalog 
your disk. Notice that the words "disk volume" are missing. 
To retrieve them, enter the monitor (call —151) , and type : 

ADB3: 20 ED FD 

Control-C back to Basic and catalog again. Your disk volume 
heading should have returned. If you made an error, you could 
be in trouble. A mistyped number or letter could scramble 
DOS and make a real mess of things. Remember, to reestab- 
lish normal DOS, you can always reboot. 

Suppose you want to make your greeting program cancel 
the disk volume heading (it is, after all, confusing to beginners 
and usually unnecessary) . Since you can't add "ADB3: EA EA 
EA," a machine-language command, to a Basic program, you 
will have to convert these numbers to their decimal equiva- 
lents and poke them in. Add these lines to your program : 

10 POKE 44467,234: POKE 44468,234: POKE 44469,234 

11 POKE 44480,234: POKE 44481,234: POKE 44482,234 

12 REM REST OF HELLO PROGRAM . . . 

Line 10 deletes "disk volume" and line 11 deletes the volume 
number. Now when this program is run, the DISK VOLUME 
heading will not show when a catalog is displayed. 

Another way to implement a DOS change is to init a new 
disk while the change is in effect. That way, every time that 
disk is booted, your Apple will behave according to the changes 
in memory when the disk was initialized. 

Now, if you're still with me, you are ready for some experi- 
mentation on your own. Take any one, two, or three-digit ma- 
chine language command between $AD98 (44440) and $AE69 
(44649) and cancel it by entering one, two, or three EAs (or 
poke in 234s) . Catalog your disk, and see what happens. Re- 
member, what you are doing is cancelling commands, so 



PUT YOUR APPLE TO WORK FOR YOU!

THUNDERWARE'S DOS-DATER 

Our new DOS-DATER software upgrades the regular DOS on 
your disks so that DOS will use the THUNDERCLOCK to time- 
and-date-stamp disk files. Every time a program is saved or a file is 
modified, the current date and time to the minute are stored in 
the CATALOG with the file's name. You can tell at a glance when 
a program was saved or when any file was last modified. And this 
time/date stamping feature is completely automatic. That means 
any program which uses DOS will time/date stamp its files!

watch for what doesn't happen as much as for what does. 
Here are a few catalog modifications I have discovered: 

ADD9: EA EA or 

POKE 44505,234: POKE 44506,234 

displays deleted file names in a catalog. 

AE22: EA EA EA or 

POKE 44578, 234: POKE 44579,234: POKE 44580,234 

cancels carriage returns after file names in catalog. 

AE34: EA EA EA or 

POKE 44596,234: POKE 44597,234: POKE 44598,234 

cancels catalog stop when screen is full. 

AE37: EA EA or 

POKE 44599,234: POKE 44600,234 

stops catalog at each file name and waits for return. 

You will encounter many strange occurrences, both useful 
and useless (and sometimes destructive) , with this method of 
experimentation. Often your Apple will hang and eat its cur- 
sor or crash you into the Monitor, requiring you to hit reset. Re- 
member, when all else fails, kill the power and reboot. 

The following program is an aid for those of you (us) who 
don't think in hex. It does disassemblies for you in DOS or any- 
where else in the Apple, converts all of the hex values to deci- 
mal, and displays both on the screen. To use it, type run and 
enter the starting address (0-65535) of the disassembly. To 
continue to the next set of addresses, hit return. To start at a 
new address, enter a new decimal number.

At Long Last, Input. All the programs that we've seen so 
far have processed data In the form of declared constants. For 
instance, here's a program that adds two integers and dis- 
plays the result: 

PROGRAM

(♦ Displays numbers NumA, NumB, and 
(NumA + NumB) *) 

CONST

Suppose you want to add two different numbers. To change 
the data in this program, or in any other so designed, you must 
edit the program text, modify the constant definitions, and re- 
compile. (In this case, you would modify either or both of the 
constants NumA and NumB.) Up to now, this process has been 
only mildly inconvenient, because we have been dealing with 
relatively small and simple programs that are quickly edited 



and compiled. As you might expect, however, this method of 
changing a program's behavior will cost us more and more 
time and effort as we move on to larger and more complex pro- 
grams. There is, of course, an easier way. Instead of defining a 
program's initial data as constants within the program text it- 
self, we can design the program to accept data from an out- 
side source (the keyboard, for example). Data so acquired is 
called input data (often abbreviated as, simply "input"). 

Learning to Read. For simple input, Pascal provides the 
standard procedures Read and ReadLn, which complement 
their counterparts Write and WrlteLn. Where Write and 
WriteLn permit your program to send information to the con- 
sole screen. Read and ReadLn permit it to accept information 
from the console keyboard. (Because Read and ReadLn are so 
similar, I'll mention ReadLn specifically only when a distinc- 
tion needs to be made between the two procedures. Otherwise, 
whatever I say about Read applies equally to ReadLn.) 

The parameters to Read must be names of variables, into 
which input data may be stored. Read accepts any number of 
parameters, in any order, so long as the type of each param- 
eter is either Char, Integer, Real or String. (See figure 1 ; note 
that, like Write, Read does not accept parameters of type 
Boolean, or of any enumerated type.) If you call Read with 
more than one parameter, it will acquire data for each param- 
eter, in order, until an input value has been assigned to every 
one. The data type of a parameter to Read determines the type 
of datum that the computer will accept for— and thus put in- 
to—that object. For instance, if you would like your program to 
accept an Integer number from the keyboard, you would call 
Read with an Integer variable, say Intvar, as the parameter: 

Read(lntVar);

and NumB, in that order, the following call to Read is appro- 
priate : 

Read (NumA, NumB); 

Let's modify Adder so that it will accept NumA and NumB 
from the keyboard. First, we must change NumA and NumB 
from constants into variables in order to permit Read to as- 
sign arbitrary values to them. Next, we insert a call to Read, 
prior to the addition calculation. The old Adder is now entirely 
converted into a program, Adder2, which gets its data from the 
user. 

PROGRAM 
Adder2; 

C" Acquires the Integers NumA and NumB from 
the console, then displays both them and 
their sum. *)

I Read (NumA, NumB); 

WriteLn (NumArFieldWidth, > + ', 
NumB:Fieldwidth, ' = ', 
(NumA + NumB) :FieldWidth); 
END (* Adder2 *). 

You may use Adder2 over and over again, giving different 
input data each time, without having to modify the program or 
recompile it. Unfortunately, there is one small problem with 
I this new version of Adder. To find out what it Is, compile and 
^ execute the program. What happens? The computer appears 
to stop dead. Of course, it is actually waiting for you to put in 
the two numbers, NumA and NumB. Type the following: 

23 42 

i Be sure to separate the two numbers with at leaat one blank, 
F and conclude your input by pressing the <RETURN> key. 
Adder2 then responds as we expect, by displaying ("echoing") 
both of the input numbers, in addition to reporting their sum. 

Prompting the Input. When it waits for you to type NUMA 
and NumB, Adder2 gives absolutely no indication that it is ex- 
pecting Input, nor any clue as to what that input should be. Un- 
less you have seen and understood the source progfram, you 
are likely to be baffled by the apparently "dead" computer. 
For this reason, computer professionals would say that Adder2 
is "not friendly." At the very least, a "friendly" program 
should prompt the user when it expects input. "Friendlier" 
programs tell the user what form of data is expected, and even 
how to type it. Extremely friendly programs are capable not 
only of recognizing when the user has supplied inappropriate 
input data, but also of notifying the user of the situation, sug- 
gesting ways to correct it, and giving the viser opportunities to 
try again. (This last behavior falls under the heading of error 
detection and recovery, which is the subject of a future col- 
umn.) Adders, shown below, is only moderately friendly. In 
that it merely prompts the user for NumA and NumB. Still, 
this is an improvement over the earlier, silent version. 

PROGRAM 
Adder3; 

(* Acquires the Integers NumA and NumB from 
the console, then displays both them and 
their sum. ♦)

WritefEnter two Integers: '); 
Read (NumA, NumB); 
WriteLn (NumA:FieldWidth, " + ', 
NumBiFieldwidth, ' = ', 
(NumA + NumB):FieldWidth); 
END (* Adders ♦). 

As you can see, prompting involves no exotic techniques; 
all you need do is send an appropriately worded message— the 
prompt — to the console screen, usually by calling Write or (oc- 
casionally) WriteLn. Note that, if you use Write to issue your 
prompt, the user will enter input data on the same display line 
as the prompt. Consequently, it's generally good practice to 
put a blank at the end of the prompt, as I did in Adders, in or- 
der to separate it from the input data on the screen. If you use 
WriteLn to issue a prompt, the input data will appear on the 
display line that follows the prompt, so there Is no need to In- 
clude a "trailing blank" in the message. 

From this point on, we'll be using prompts and prompting 
techniques in almost every program, so there's not much need 
now to talk at length on the philosophy of prompting— that is, 
how to word a prompt, how to decide whether or not a prompt 
is necessary, and so forth. You should be able to acquire a feel 
for proper prompting strategy and methods by examining our 
sample programs. However, a few comments here may start 
you thinking about this important Issue, and the sooner you be- 
gin to consider it, the better. 

In general, prompts should be as brief a^s possible without 
being cryptic. Brevity is desirable for two reasons: first, long 
prompts take longer to display, and longer to read, than short 
ones ; long prompts are therefore more likely to contribute to 
user boredom or impatience, especially as the user gains ex- 
perience with the program and begins to memorize the 
prompts from sheer repetition. Second, the display screen Is 
limited in its dimensions. Ideally, you should choose prompts 
so that both a prompt and the input data associated with It may 
be displayed simultaneously on the screen (usually on the 
same display line). Long prompts leave less room for the dis- 
play of input data, and should therefore be avoided. 

The helpfulness of a prompt depends, of course, on the so- 
phistication of the user. For example, consider the Apple Pas- 
cal main prompt line, which enumerates the single-character 
commands that are recognized by the operating system. I 
doubt that someone who has no prior experience with comput- 
ers would be able to determine the significance of the prompt 
line simply by looking at it. To the uninitiated, therefore, it is 
cryptic. On the other hand, it doesn't remain cryptic for very 
long, since the concept behind the main prompt line is easily 
grasped, and beginners have been known to master it in min- 
utes, or even seconds. Certainly, in order to be entirely self-ex- 
planatory to the complete novice, the prompt would have to be 
longer and wordier. Such verbosity would Irritate the experi- 
enced users, who far outnumber the novices, especially since 
novices usually acquire some reasonable level of sophistica- 
tion within the first five minutes of using the system ! 

In coming up with the main prompt line, then, the design- 
ers of UCSD/ Apple P£U9cal made certain assumptions about 
who the typical user is, and what she knows. The assumptions 
that you make about the sophistication of the user, and the 
limitations of your display device (if any) , should be listed as 
comments within your program, as I've done In Adders. These 
are the constraints that affect your decisions as to when and 
how your program should prompt Its users. They will be in- 
valuable reference material for yourself at a later date, or for 
someone else who tries to understand or modify your program. 

Syntax for Numeric Input. Figure 2 repeats the syntax dia-

grams for Integer and Real literals. A numeric datum must be 
entered as a literal, using one of these formats, or Pascal will 
either reject it outright (if possible) , or accept only part of It, 
ignoring the erroneous portion. Pascal accepts your numeric 
input, character by character, building up each number with 
your every keystroke, and checking to see that each new char- 
acter conforms to the appropriate syntax diagram (for Real or 
Integer, as determined by the type of the variable into which 
the value is being read) . Whenever it encounters a character 
for which there is no provision in the diagram, Pascal as- 
sumes that the input number ends there (and that any subse- 
quent datum begins there) . 

Often, you will be in the process of entering a number when, 
by mistake, you press an inappropriate key. If, by this time, 
Peiscal has been able to build a legal number, that value, what- 
ever it is, is assigned to the corresponding variable, and Pas- 
cal proceeds to acquire a value for the next item in the Read 
parameter list. If Pascal has not been able to come up with a 
proper number by the time you press the "illegal" key, the sys- 
tem will notify you of an I/O Error and complain of a bad In- 
put format. 

If you'd like to see these principles applied, run Adders and 
begin your input with a letter (upper-case or lower-case, either 
is fine). At the very start, Adders tries to collect an Integer 
value for NumA, but gets a letter, instead of a "legal" charac- 
ter. This indicates that data input for NumA has ended, but no 
value has yet been built ! The Pascal system takes over at this 
point, and responds to the unsavory situation aborting Add- 
erS's execution, and issuing an error message. When you see 
the error message, you should press the space bar, in order to 
regain the main prompt line. Once you've done this, execute 
Adders again. This time, type 

lOp 



That is, type a legal Integer, followed immediately by an Inap- 
propriate character. (If you wish, you may also put one or 
more spaces between the integer and the bad character— the 
result will be the same.) Again, you get the expected "bad for- 
mat" error message, but this time because Pascal could not 
finish building a value for NumB. If you could peek Inside the 
computer, just prior to receiving the error message, you would 
see that NumA, in this case, was assigned the value 10. Upon 
encountering the p Pascal terminated the data acquisition for 
NumA and tried to go on to the next datum, NumB, assuming 
that the p would be its first input character. Of course, there Is 
no provision for p in the Integer syntax diagram, and so Pas- 
cal immediately quit gathering data for NumB, without hav- 
ing first built up any useful input value. Consequently, Pascal 
was forced to terminate the program, and Issue an error 
message. 

Finally, try yet another run of Adder S, with the following 
input : 



1 2z 



As in the previous examples, Pascal doesn't give you a chance 
to press the return key to terminate your input. Unlike the two 
earlier attempts, however, this one Is successful. Pascal builds 
NumA until it gets the blank that separates the 1 and 2, then 
builds NumB until it encounters the letter g. The value 1 is as- 
signed to NumA, and 2 to NumB. Since no further data Is re- 
quired by Adders, the z remains unused. 

Notice that, in this example, the displayed input data and 
AdderS's final output are crowded together on the same dis- 
play line. This is because you weren't able to use return to sig- 
nal the end of your input. Unless you explicitly direct other- 
wise, Pascal gives back to you (on the screen) whatever you 
type into It (from the keyboard) , and it does this before going

on to other business. This process is called "echoing the in- 
put," and it is the computer's way of letting you know that your 
commands and data are being received loud and clear. When 
you press the return key, Pascal "echoes" this by advancing 
the screen's cursor to the beginning of the next display line. 
Thus, when you conclude data input by pressing return, subse- 
quent output from the computer must start "cleanly," on a 
new line. In this case, the letter g concluded your input. Being 
only a letter, s has no magic, line-advancing properties, so the 
cursor remained in the character position that followed z. 
Since Adders issued no calls to WriteLn prior to reporting the 
sum of the two input numbers, the final output was boxand to 
run together with the input data display. 

Blanks Separate Numeric Input Data. When providing 
numeric data to a progfram that uses Read (and/or ReadLn) to 
collect Its input, you should insvire that at least one blank 
separates each datum from its predecessor, and you should not 
use other characters for this purpose. The blank is the Pascal 
system's natural separator. Because it is not a part of the sjrn- 
tax for either Integer or Real literals, it marks the end of an in- 
put literal, just as p, z, #, or any other "inappropriate" charac- 
ter does. But blanks are special, in that Read will skip over 
them while it is trying to find the first "legal" character in an 
input literal. In other words, any number of blanks may pre- 
cede a numeric input datum; Pauscal will ignore these "lead- 
ing blanks." In xxsing Adders, suppose you type the following, 
in response to the program's request for input: 

17 299 

As usual, you conclude your input by pressing the return key. 
Let's examine what Adders does with yovir input. First, it re- 
ceives a sequence of digits (17) that corresponds to an Integer 
literal. Then it gets a blank, which marks the end of the datum ; 
the value collected so far, 17, is assigned to NumA. Pascal as- 
sumes that the character which identifies the end of the first 
datum also begins the next. But, since this character is a 



blank, it is ignored (as p, z, or §, for example, would not be) . If 
any other blanks stood between the first and second data, they 
would also be ignored. Finally, Pascal begins to get more 
digits, and is able to build up the Integer value of 299, which is 
assigned to NumB as soon as you press the return key. 

Return is Treated as Blank. The return key is also accord- 
ed special treatment by the Read procedure; it is always 
translated into a blank, and so may be considered as equiva- 
lent to the blank, for purposes of this discussion. The equiva- 
lence between return and the blank implies that an acceptable 
response to Adders is to type one Integer literal, then press the 
return key, then type another literal, and press the return key 
again. Try it. 

It works! It's completely a matter of your own personal 
taste as to whether you use return, blank, or both to separate 
numeric data, or to terminate numeric input. My rule of thumb 
is to group related data on a single input line whenever I can, 
using one or more blanks to separate each datum from its 
predecessor, and return to end the line. 

Although we've given only Integer parameters to Read so 
far, Pascal's acquisition of Real input data is similar; it skips 
leading blanks, expects the vuser to observe the syntax for a 
Real literal (which, as shown in figure 2, is slightly more com- 
plicated than that for an Integer) , and terminates the data col- 
lection upon the receipt of a character that does not conform to 
the syntax. If no usable value has been built before the input is 
terminated, Pascal issues an error message, just as it does in 
the Integer case. 

The Difference Between Read and ReadLn. Remember 
that WriteLn may be called with or without parameters, and 
that the call 

WriteLn(A, B, C); 

is equivalent to the compound statement 

BEGIN Write(A, B, C); WriteLn END;

Picture this: 

You sit down at your Apple II and boot your 
own custom system aisk. 

A "menu ' of numbered options appears. 
Perhaps one says "RUN FILE DEVELOPER." 
Another says "BOOT 13 SECTOR DISK." Other 
options you've defined might be "GAMES" and 
"HOME FINANCES." 

Say you select "GAMES"— just by entering 
a single digit. 

Immediately, another menu appears listing 
the games you own. If the one you select is on a 
different disk, the computer requests you to 
insert that disk and press a key to run it. 

If this sounds like a convenient way to use 
your computer system, you're right. 

If it also sounds like a lot of work to 
program, you're right again. 

Until now. 

Introducing the MENU GENERATOR. 

Now creating your own custom menus is as 
simple as filling out a form on your computer 
screen. 

Just run the MENU GENERATOR, and tell 
it what you want each menu option to say, and 
what action to take when that option is selected. 
You can RUN or BRUN a program, boot another 
disk, execute user— written BASIC statements, or 
perform any valid DOS operation. 

MENU GENERATOR will compile your 
entries into a neat, attractively-formatted screen 
menu, then automatically write a documented, 
bug-free Applesoft program to generate and process 
the menu. 

You can list , copy , and modify this program 
if you want to add your own touches . A single disk 
will hold data for up to 150 different menus. 



Make it easy on others, too! 

If you write programs that other people are 
going to use , you'll find that a few good menus are 
wortn 100 pages of instructions. You'll be 
thankful , too, when you put the program aside for 
a couple of months and then try to use it again! 

Pays for itself the first time you use it. 

Using the MENU GENERATOR should save 
at least 95% of the time you'd spend writing your 
own menu program . At just $39.95, can you afford 
not to have this great labor saver working for 
you? 

MENU GENERATOR comes complete with 
program disk, backup disk, and 40-page manual. 
It runs on a 48k Apple II Plus, under DOS 3.3. 

Ask your dealer for MENU GENERATOR, or 
order direct from Crane Software for $39.95

BEGIN Read(A, B, C); ReadLn END; 

Since you may deduce the behavior of ReadLn, called with pa- 
rameters, by combining the behavior of Read with that of 
ReadLn, as called with no parameters, I will only spend time 
here discussing the "no-parameter" version of ReadLn. 

Calling WriteLn with no parameters forces the display 
cursor to the beginning of the next display line. ReadLn, as you 
may expect, acts similarly, in forcing Pascal to Ignore input 
until the beginning of the next input line. By convention, Apple 
Pascal recognizes a press of the return key as marking the end 
of a line of input data. Although Pascal translates the charac- 
ter generated by the return key into a blank, there is a special, 
built-in function (EOLN, which we'll examine next time) that 
permits a program to distinguish between regular blanks, and 
those that are generated by pressing return. ReadLn makes 
use of this function in fulfilling its sole purpose of accepting and 
discarding input characters until the return key has been 
pressed. 

If you replace the call to Read in Adders with a parame- 
terized call to ReadLn, you will find that either a blank or re- 
turn is sufficient to separate the input value for NumA from 
that for NumB, just eus it was in the previous version of the pro- 
gram. However, only return is accepted by the new Adders as 
terminating NumB. The effect of ReadLn is to require that the 
user press return after the last item in the parameter list (if 
any), and before program execution may continue. 



Suppose you replace the "ReadLn (NumA, NumB);" in 
your latest version of Adders with the two calls "ReadLn 
(NumA) ; ReadLn (NumB) ;". No longer will it be possible to 
enter both input numbers on the same line. If you try, the first 
call to ReadLn will acquire NumA, then discard all characters 
between NumA and the end of the line — including NumB — as 
if they were garbage ! You will have to reenter NumB on the 
following line. (By the way, for the sake of aesthetics, I would 
put out an appropriate prompt prior to each of the two calls to 
ReadLn.) 

As far as numeric input is concerned, the choice of whether 
to use Read or ReadLn in your programs is entirely up to you. 
It's a tricky business, trying to decide which is more appropri- 
ate in any given situation. In future excursions down the Path, 
I will try to present examples, in which both options are exer- 
cised, along with the rationales behind my particular choices. 
For data types other than numeric, the decision between Read 
and ReadLn is (usually) much more easily made, and you'll 
see examples of such situations soon. 

More to Come. By now, I hope it's apparent to you that in- 
put is a very meaty subject. Consequently, I will be devoting 
the next several columns to explaining it as fully as I can. This 
time, we've only skimmed over Apple Pascal's most rudi- 
mentary input facilities; even so, that should be enough to 
occupy you in the month between this issue and the next. For 
homework, modify any of our old programs to accept input 
from the keyboard. This should help you to become familiar 
with the use of Read and ReadLn, £U9 applied to the collection of 
numeric data. You'll need to be comfortable with their behavi- 
or in order to follow along as I dissect them and show you some 
of their inner workings. We'll also look at Files, the basic 
means of input and output in the Apple Pascal system, along 
with some of the primitive operations that Pascal provides for 
manipulating them (character by character input, for 
example) . 



STOP 



PLAYING GAMES WITH 
YOUR RESOURCES ! 



Was financial management one of your justifications 
for purchasing an APPLE" computer? 

Are you really managing your flnances or just using an 
expensive' calculator to help balance your checkbook(8)? 

It takes a double entry system to do the job right. Why ? 

Less than half the flnancial transactions necessary to 
adequately manage your resources and plan your tax 
strategy can be accomodated with single entry systems. 

How can you use a double entry system without a 
refresher course in accounting? 

You can't, if you use software that simply automates 
the way people do things by hand, . . . but, with 
The ACCOUNTANT, by Decision Support Software, 
the power of your computer is harnessed to offer you the 
advantages of an automated double entry system even if 
you don't know a debit from a credit !

Bv DAVID mm 



Jim Howard has always wanted to be 
an architect. The Independence that goes 
with running a small business Initially at- 
tracted a young Jim Howard to the Idea 
of starting his own architecture firm. As 
the years passed, Howard left the pos- 
sible career of architect for other things, 
but the spirit of his dream remains. 

Glrard Avenue curves crazlly along 
the shore In La JoUa, California, ten or so 
miles north of San Diego. On one steep 
curve there Is an odd blue and white 
building that overlooks the Pacific 
Ocean. With a wooden, Ughthousellke, 
New England look, this structure has 
some decidedly unusual architectural 
features. The building's architect let his 
Imagination soar and created a labor of 
love that Is far removed from the bland- 
ness that characterizes much of modem 
architecture. 

Howard Software recently moved In- 
to three offices on the third floor and one 
ground floor office In this building. The 
architect fashioned his own living space 
with a spectacular view and Howard 
Software Is In the process of moving the 
marketing and accounting departments 
into this area. Walking through the two- 
story, studlolike space confirms the feel- 
ing that the designer must have been a 
little mad. The building definitely has the 
personal touch and it seems like the per- 
fect habitat for the business of mild man- 
nered James Howard. 

Howard may not be an architect but 
he does know about a certain kind of 
madness; the kind that sweeps the na- 
tion once a year when for two or three 
months all hell breaks loose. Roaring 
mightily, the IRS gnashes its teeth and 
all good citizens cringe with tear. A war- 
like madness grips the country. Howard 
makes a great deal of his living off this 
madness. 

Excessive Success. Wars are won by

using well-thought-out tactics and strat- 
egies, but, like the British Army officer 
says in The Bridge on the River Kwai: 
"There's always the unexpected." The 
demand for Tax Preparer, by far How- 
ardSoft's most popular program, nearly 
overwhelmed the company's resources 
this January. In one month, they shipped 
four thousand copies, the projected stock 
for the entire tax season. 

"A lot of things happen by accident 
and we were unprepared for it." Jim 
Howsu'd knew the danger that he faced if 
he couldn't ship product on time and keep 
up with the demand. "We were in for big 
problems with our reputation. People 
j want tax programs right away." Hero- 
ically sacrificing physical health and 
peace of mind, Howard and his hard- 
working staff of fourteen managed to 
stay ahead of the avalanche. An imex- 
pected disaster turned into an un- 
expected victory. 

Life is a veil of unusual things, 
strange buildings, and unexpected oc- 
currences. For instance, one is flabber- 
gasted to discover that there are actual- 
ly natives of Los Angeles. Well-known as 
a Mecca for sun starved easterners, Los 
Angeles is a place to go to, not come 
from. Defying the odds, two of Howard 
Software's top personnel are natives of 
Mickey Mouse's home town. 

To Rise Above These Humble Begin- 
nings. Jim Howard was bom and raised 
in Los Angeles. For most of his early 
years he lived in the area near Venice 
I and Western. Howard graduated from 
L UCLA in 1964 with a bachelor's degree in

engineering and a taste for Ja^z music. He received his Ph.D. 
in electrical engineering from UCLA In 1969. Economics, 
Howard's minor at UCLA, would come in handy years later. 

Howard worked for Hughes Aircraft from 1964 to 1967 de- 
signing radar and participating in several research projects. 
Sometime In 1976, Hughes asked Howard to return to school for 
his MBA. They wanted him to take over a management posi- 
tion. Doing research has a certain amount of freedom and it 
can be exciting and challenging, but management is pretty un- 
interesting stuff. Howard quit Hughes in 1977 to look for some- 
thing more suited to his goals and lifestyle. 

After leaving Hughes, Howard investigated small R&D 
compajiies looking for the kind of job he had at Hughes before 
they decided to kick him upstairs. Eventually he found Mark 
Resources in Marina del Rey, a twelve-man consulting firm. 
Howard worked there contentedly designing radars and teach- 
ing short classes in electronics until March 1981 when he quit to 
run Howard Software full-time. 

Until three years ago, Howard had next to no program- 
ming experience and he has never had any formal instruction 
in computers. Once or twice he was forced to do some pro- 
gramming In the course of a project on a Hewlett-Packard 2100 
minicomputer. The desire to be involved in all the pheises of re- 
search made learning programming for these projects a 
necessity. 

Apples would have to wait for the eighties as Howard was 
busy with his full-time job and hobbles that didn't include com- 
puters. For more than a decade, Howard has been doing his 
own investing and financial management. Call it a hobby If you 
will: after taking courses at UCLA on the subjects, Howard 
has felt confident enough to handle his own finances. This con- 
fidence built up over the years helped Howard to make the 
considerable leap into starting his own financial software 
business. 

The Big Day. Howard bought an Apple in late 1979 thinking 
it would be good for his son and daughter to learn on. Maybe it 
was curiosity or maybe it was fate that led Howard to attempt 
to write his own tax-preparing program. Initially written for 



his personal use, Howard's program ended up a pretty useful 
device. He decided to try marketing it in the small but gfrow- 
ing Apple market. 

Working full-time during the day and moonlighting at night, 
that first year was tough, but Howard managed to survive. He 
shipped enough product to have a legitimate business and 
wrote off the Apple on his taxes as a business expense. Work- 
ing out of his home in the L.A. neighborhood of Westchester, 
Howard shipped fifty tax preparers, with instructions paper- 
clipped to the disk, in time for the 1980 tax deadline. Pleasant- 
ly surprised with the results, Howard began working on his 
own real estate program and for the next few months he didn't 
take the future of HowardSoft too seriously. 

After the repeated urging of users and dealers, Howard de- 
cided maybe there was something in this software business af- 
ter all. Starting in late 1980, Howard incorporated many im- 
provements and additions into the 1981 Tax Preparer. After ga- 
thering research on how to market a software program, How- 
ard got high quality binders to house the documentation and in- 
struction manual. He also increased the advertising and im- 
proved the channels of distribution. The resulting sales were 
spectacular and Howard had a real business going. 

Quitting his well-paying, full-time job in March 1981 was a 
big decision for Howard. A conservative person at heart, How- 
ard spent a lot of time determining the wisdom of leaving a se- 
cure position for the uncertainty of heading his own business. 
Needless to say, he made the plunge and now he's glad he 
did. 

Although he admits to always being afraid of taking the 
next step, Howard has had a pretty hectic life in the last few 
years. After leaving Mark Resources he moved down to La Jol- 
la, a place he had visited many times previously and had al- 
ways liked. "It was a dream come true to live down here, away 
from the smog." Dreams are never foolproof though, and How- 
ard spent his first three months in dreamland packing boxes 
and answering phones. 

The Right Staff. In June 1981, Howard realized that he 
couldn't do it alone. He went looking for someone to organize

the business and help with the dally grunge work. One of the 
first Individuals he Interviewed was Dianne Prittie, another 
displaced native of Los Angeles. Here It was a case of the po- 
tential employee badgering the employer. Dianne took one 
look at Howard's messy office/apartment and thought, this is 
the Job for me. The morning after the Interview she knocked on 
Howard's door and said: "I want this job." 

Prittle had an interesting and varied life before she came to 
work for Howard Software. For three years in the mid-sixties 
she was tour coordinator for the Fifth Dimension rock group. It 
was crazy and fun; she never knew what to expect next. After 
the Fifth Dimension, Prittie managed a female artist for a 
year. In the early seventies she ran an antique store on Sunset 
Boulevard. 

Then It was a stint as a real estate agent for a company in 
Beverly Hills. "I realized after a while that the real estate busi- 
ness was too consuming In every way. You have to work seven 
days a week and work nights. You have no private or personal 
life." Buying homes and property can be a traumatic experi- 
ence for buyer and agent alike; Prittie found the whole thing 
all too stressful. 

Good Vibes. As if on some cosmic wavelength with her fu- 
ture boss, Prittie moved down to La Jolla to escape the hectic 
lifestyle of Los Angeles. Like many people, then and now, she 
thought computers would be a good thing to look into and that 
is how she came to find Howard Software. 

Originally hired on as a general, part-time flvinky, Prittie 
has worked full-time since the second week on the Job. Start- 
ing as administrative assistant, she is now executive director 
of marketing in another case of the unexpected. Howard had 
no idea that she would do so well with advertising and han- 
dling dealers. Hard working, intelligent, and industrious, Prit- 
ti has helped Howard Software maintain its well-respected 
spot in the Apple market. 

Which bringrs us to the Howard Software advertising cam- 
paign, which should be familiar to Softalk readers who've re- 
ceived the last four or five issues. This series of ads featuring a 
beautiful young woman offering Howard software has gar- 



T A L 1^ APRiuiiF 

nered some negative response from some folks. Prittie is very 
concerned about this problem because it seems to be working 
at cross-purposes to her original concept of the campaign. An < 
avowed feminist, Prittie never thought the ads were cheap or 
exploitative. 

It is Prittie 's desire to make an image for Howard that will 
be instantly recognizable. This is not limited to any single per- 
son or kind of person, and there will be different people show- 
ing up in future ads. Still, there will be human beings (of both 
sexes) in the ads, because Prittie believes this is the best way 
to sell Howard Software. "People buy from people. There is no 
reason why our ads must be only technical and serious." 

Howard Software is not looking for the institutionalized look 
of big business. Jim Howard has a loose office dress code that 
specifically forbids ties. In their advertisements they want 
something to show the quality of their programs but at the 
same time keep it personal. "Accountants, attorneys, real 
estate brokers— they're Just like me," Prittie says. "'Technical 
data doesn't mean much; people want to know what the 
program does." Prittie is very conscious of HowardSoft's 
image, though sometimes it is possible to get caught up in the 
mechanics of a task and temporarily lose touch with the 
results. 

Marll Sowell is an eminently likable woman who has taken 
on the administrative coordinator position. Previously a coun- 
selor at a rape crisis center in San Diego, Marll felt her future 
there to be limited. Looking for something with greater oppor- 
tunity in a time of economic recession, she decided to investi- 
gate the booming field of microcomputers. 

Thankfully, Sowell was used to handling a multitude of 
tasks at the crisis center. She had her hands full as soon as she 
Joined Howard Software. Jim and Dianne headed up to Com- 
dex in Las Vegas and left Marll to handle the move into the Gi- 
rard Avenue offices. Displaying talents no one knew she pos- 
sessed, Sowell took care of all the interior decoration and coor- 
dinated the layout of the offices. 

Howard is always pleased when he finds someone as hard- 
working and Industrious as Marll Sowell. She is very happy at

HowardSoft and has great plans for making the business tight-

Despoiler of Youth. Howard has recently hired a few pro- 
grammers to help with updating existing programs. Offering 
who knows what, he has convinced poor innocent college stu- 
dents from the local university to give up their studies and 
come work for him. Don Brotemarkle has a BA in physics 
from the University of California at San Diego and he was 
working on his Masters In abstract physics. That was before he 
met Howard. Now Brotemarkle is happily programming for 
Howard and seems to have lost interest in his previous career 
goals. 

Howard claims to hire employees on intuition, recognizing 
the right person by some intuitive process not usually asso- 
ciated with sound business practices. Paul Hatlmaya and 
Steve Templeton are two more programmers seduced away 
from the hallowed halls of UCSD. Like Prittle when she 
started, these fellows may be doing something In a few months 
they can only guess at now. Howard looks for Intelligent and 
capable individuals who are not afraid of branching out into 
other things. 

Everybody at Howard Software works more than forty 
hours a week if the extra time is demanded. Hours are flexible 
and some programmers work at home because computers are 
scarce during normal working hours. Nobody complains much 
because they have a good attitude about what they're doing. 

Howard Software has three main progframs to offer at this 
point — Creative Financing, Tax Preparer, and Real Estate 
Analyzer — but more may be on the way. Jim Howard thinks 
the time may be right to release a tax planning program. In 
the Howard tradition it would be cheap in price but sophisti- 
cated in performance. 

These two factors — low pricing and a high amount of so- 
phistication — have made Howard the top name in financial 
software for the Apple today. There are programs available 
that match the sophistication found in Tax Preparer, but they 
usually run around a thousand dollars. Similarly, few pro- 
grams as inexpensive as Tax Preparer have the sophisticated 
features Included in Howard's package. 

Although there have been some encroachments into How- 
ard's market, he is not too concerned. The head start Howard- 
Soft has over the competition should keep them ahead as long 
as the programs keep getting updated and improved. 

Making sure Howard Software's product gets there in one 
piece and familiarizing dealers with the features of that prod- 
uct is another of Dianne Prittle 's areas of expertise. Prittle is 
planning a lengthy trek across the length and breadth of Cali- 
fornia to visit dealers and solidify the relationship that How- 
ard Software considers so important. 

Selling only through dealers has helped the customer, and 
HowardSoft is helped in turn by keeping close to user and deal- 
er feedback. Believing that a better product sells better, How- 
ard is constantly updating and expanding the scope of his pro- 
grams. Feedback from the marketplace is very much respon- 
sible for the improvements that are implemented. 

The desire to meet the needs of the user doesn't end here. 
Plans are afoot to hold local seminars in the San Diego area, 
sponsored by HowardSoft for business professionals. Account- 
ants and real estate brokers will benefit from personal in- 
struction on the ways and means of using Tax Preparer and 
Real Estate Analyzer. 

One thing that caught Howard by surprise is the demand 
for his products by professionals. He figxires that the majority 
of sales for Tax Preparer and Real Estate Analyzer are attrib- 
utable to serious business people. About half of Tax Pre- 
parer's sales £U"e accounted for by what Howard calls the 
"heavy professionals" who process up to five hundred tax 
forms a year. Apparently the alternatives for professionals 
can get fairly expensive. They have to send out the work to 
large computer firms, who traditionally charge arms and legs. 

Individuals account for a third of the sales of Tax Preparer, 
and most of these occur in the months of March and April. Bet- 
ter late than never, as the saying goes. After exhausting his 
stock in January, Howard is set for the rush of orders from in- 



dividuals which will hopefully not be quite so intense. One rea- 
son that some individual users may not be rushing out and buy- 
ing Howard's program is the price. Although it's cheap for a 
professional or a company, most individuals are used to send- 
ing out their taxes to a preparer for seventy to one hundred dol- 
lars. A hundred and fifty dollars for a program might seem too 
much to pay. 

With HowardSoft's current update policy, buying a Tax 
Preparer for a single person or family may seem a little more 
reasonable. For a fee of about thirty dollars, you can ex- 
change last year's program for the new one with the current 
tax laws. Over the space of a few years, Howard's package will 
pay for itself in savings over the cost of sending out your taxes 
each year to the tune of a hundred bucks. 

Doing One Thing Well. Howard plans to stay with products 
that are unique in the marketplace. He wants to explore his 
particular expertise — financial software. There will be no 
games or word processors mysteriously emerging from Gi- 
rard Avenue. 

Howard likes to do everything, but at the same time not la- 
bor too long on one project. "I'm enjoying what I'm doing and I 
hope that everyone around me does the same." The sole own- 
er of Howard Software, Jim Howard is enjoying the prospect of 
incorporating sometime this year. 

Prittle is very happy with her job and feels the future bodes 
well. Dianne enjoys talking to people because she learns so 
much. "I felt Intimidated at first, not being a programmer or 
someone familiar with the Industry. But there are many peo- 
ple in the same boat. I've made so many friends and that 
makes it worthwhile." 

Without a doubt, Howard is on the right track. An architect 
of programs as opposed to buildings, he has a small business 
that he intends to keep small. Carving a niche in the Apple 
landscape, Howard Software may be small but it is gaining a 
big reputation. Small is beautiful for some things, but respect 
is something you can never amass to excess. The folks at How- 
ard Software have earned theirs and they plan to keep on earn- 
ing it in the years ahead.

Apple deserves a lot of credit for the forethought that went 
into the design of the Apple II. Aside from the eight peripheral 
slots, one of Apple's best innovations is its game I/O connec- 
tor. The game I/O provides a dozen analog and digital inter- 
face lines. Primarily designed for hand controllers to permit 
ball-^nd-paddle type games, this port has proven valuable for 
many other purposes. A wealth of paddle and joystick type 
controllers and other peripherals interface through the game 
I/O port. 

Many of the game-related peripherals were evaluated by a 
panel of avid game players; the results of their evaluations 
follow. 

Paddles. The basic gaming accessory is a single paddle or a 
pair of them. A paddle usually consists of a variable resis- 
tance control (the knob you turn back and forth) and a simple 
switch closure (the button) . These two devices can provide suf- 
ficient information for almost all games. 

In evaluating our test paddles, we divided each unit into 
four parts: case, buttons, control knobs, and cable. In judging 
the case, we considered both appearance and comfort. Com- 
fort was rated according to how easy it would be to hold the 
paddles for an extended length of time. This was a reflection on 
the size, weight, and shape of the paddle case. Button and pad- 
dle controls were not considered in this rating. 

We then proceeded to evaluate the buttons both for their 
mechanical feel and their apparent electrical reliability. The 
latter specification waa quite subjective, but is, nonetheless, 
very important, since low-quality buttons can be worn out very 
qviickly under heavy use. The position and feel of the button's 
plunger was also rated, using the program Raster Blaster as a 
"test course." This program was chosen because it uses only 
the two push buttons to play. If the buttons are not easy to 
work, this game will bring on sore fingers or thumbs very 
quickly. 

Another consideration on button ratings was whether any 
form of feedback was incorporated to verify that the button 
had been pressed. Some switches employ tactile feedback 
which provides a physical impulse to the finger as the button is 
pressed. Audible feedback is also possible and consists of a 
clicking sound to indicate switch closure. 

In each case, the paddle control itself was basically evalu- 



ated on its size and shape ; these qualities determined its ease 
of operation. Sirius Software's Autobahn was used to test pad- 
dle-only operation, and Space Eggs was used for evaluating 
paddle/button combination use. Each unit was also disassem- 
bled to determine the quality of the components used. Finally, 
the length, flexibility, and ruggedness of the cable and dip con- 
nector were considered. 

Adam and Eve. The Adam and Eve paddles from Tech De- 
signs received the highest overall rating of all paddles tested. 
The trapezoidal-shaped case Is made of high-impact plastic 
and is extremely comfortable to hold in either hand. The identi- 
ty of PDL(O) and PDL(l) is denoted by the Adam and Eve 
labels on each unit. High quality parts are used throughout, in- 
cluding a heavy-duty, square push button with tactile and soft 
audible feedback. The switch showed very good action in the 
Raster Blaster test, giving positive response and causing little 
fatigue. 

The paddle knob on the Adam and Eve paddles is about one- 
inch in diameter and easy to maneuver. These paddles were 
also the only ones to have a fine-tuning trimmer control to 
match the paddles' range to any given computer or game pro- 
gram. This trimmer proved very useful in the Autobahn and 
Space Eggs tests. Like many other games, these programs re- 
spond to only the first half of the paddle's rotation (that is, 
from 7 o'clock to 12 o'clock) . Turning a paddle knob any fur- 
ther clockwise haa no effect on the game piece, as the knob is al- 
ready at its rightmost position. This can by annoying if you 
overshoot the limiting point and then have to back it off slowly 
counter-clockwise until the piece begins to move again. With 
proper adjustment of the trimmers on these paddles, the mo- 
tion of the game pieces can be spread out across the entire 
range of the paddle control. 

Exiting the back of each paddle is a very flexible, five-foot 
long cable, similar to the type used by the telephone company 
for connecting the new modular phones ; this should give some 
indication as to its reliability. 'The two paddle cables termi- 
nate in an oversize dip connector that makes the cable ex- 
tremely easy to insert and remove. Also mounted on the cable 
is a strain relief to isolate the connector from excessive tug- 
ging. All in all, these paddles seem to be made of exceptionally 
high-quality components, well designed to be used comfort-

ably for long periods of time, and built to last. With a six-month 
guarantee, the Adam and Eve paddles sell for $39.95. Also 
available is the Adam paddle, a single unit with two switches, 
for $29.95. 

Apple Computer Paddles. Paddles came with the Apple 
computer prior to 1981. Complying with the new FCC regula- 
tions for computers at that time, Apple made several design 
changes to reduce interference with other RF devices such as 
radios and television sets. One of the major problems in this 
regard was the game paddles, so Apple decided simply to re- 
move them from the package. They are now sold separately 
for $29.95. 

Apple has had several versions of their paddles in terms of 
component arrangement. The apparently current type has a 
rectangular-shaped casing with the switch on the right side 
and a four-foot cable. 

The major problem with the paddles is that they employ a 
very inexpensive switch that can't take much vigorous use. Al- 
so, the plunger is very small and, with heavy game playing, 
can make quite a (sore) impression on the fingers. Another 
problem with the newer version is that the placement of the 
switch is less favorable for right-handed users. All our right- 
handed testers found it most comfortable to hold the paddle in 
the left hand so they could operate the paddle knob with their 
right hand. With the switch on the right, it had to be pressed 
with one of the fingers, but given a choice, users would have 
preferred to operate buttons with their thumb. Holding the 
paddle in the right hand made it more comfortable to operate 
the switch, but, this required using the left hand for the pad- 
dle, resulting in greater strain ; holding the paddle upside-down 
worked for the button but sacrificed a good hold. 

A2D Company Model 2002. The Model 2002 game paddles 
consist of a rather large case (3.5 inches by 3 inches by 2 
inches) with a small (less than 1-inch diameter) knob on top 
and a square switch on the back. These paddles were the least 
comfortable to hold and fairly awkward to play with. The 
quality of the parts, however, was quite good. In fact, the 
Model 2002 switches received the highest rating in the Raster 
Blaster test. They offer both tactile and a soft audible feed- 
back and should probably live up to the manufacturer's claims 
of five million presses. 

Another plus for the A2D paddles is the extra long eight-foot 
cable (no strain relief is provided, so it might be wise to tie the 
cable in a knot about four inches from the connector) . There 
was nothing wrong with the operation of these paddles ; their 
overall size and the placement of the switch account for the low 
overall rating. No identification between the paddles is 
provided, so you'll probably want to add some markingfs of 
your own. Price of the Model 2002 paddles is $34.95. 

Pro Paddles. The Pi^o Paddles are manufactured by Com- 
puter Works and distributed by Rainbow Computing. Al- 
though it is not apparent from their advertisements, these pad- 
dles are the smallest we've seen. Measuring only 2.5 inches by 
1.5 inches by 1.5 inches, they have a large 1-inch paddle knob 
which dwarfs the front of the unit. Although they felt comfort- 
able to hold, they were almost too small, and sometimes be- 
came annoying to operate (especially when the fingers of the 
right hand, operating the paddle control, would rub against the 
left hand which was holding the unit) . The placement of the 
switch on the back was also less than optimum, requiring the 
use of the (usually cramped) index finger to operate. 

Identification of the paddles is provided by small numbers 
"0" and "1" engraved into the switch plungers. These plungers 
also had quite a bit of "play" (sideways movement), which 
was noted as somewhat distracting. Also unusual for paddles 
was the cable coming out from the front of the unit. The cable 
is very flexible and shielded to reduce possible interference 
with radios, TVs, and other devices. At less than four feet in 
length, however, it was considered a little too short. Price of 
the Pro Paddles is $49.95. 

TG Products Game Controllers. Getting back to a more 
normal size, the TG paddles fit comfortably in the hand. The 
two paddles are identified by a red logo on one knob and black 
one on the other. The knobs are almost IVi inches in diameter 



and easy to control. The buttons are on the left side, with large 
round plungers. Unfortunately, these switches do not appear to 
be extremely rugged, provide no feedback, and consistently 
provided less action in the Raster Blaster test. They seemed to 
require more force to press and therefore fatigued the players 
faster. Actually, the force required to close the switch is not 
greater, but with the lack of tactile feedback, our players felt 
compelled to press the button harder until it bottomed out 
against a firm spring. 

The five-foot, flat ribbon cable and the connector received 
average ratings. Price of the TG paddles is $39.95. 

The Keyboard Company Hand Controllers. These paddles 
have several unique features and were rated second overall. 
They are made of durable plastic in precise Apple colors. The 
case matches the Apple's tan color perfectly, while the paddle 
knob is the exact shade of grey found on the Apple keyboard. 
The only new color is the bright orange switch on the right side 
of the paddle. The placement of this switch was the only short- 
coming found in these paddles, although it was certainly much 
easier to operate than the buttons on the Apple paddles. 

If you are left-handed or if you don't mind operating the 
switch with your fingers, these paddles have a lot to offer. 
First, there's the extra large plunger that activates the switch. 
Both tactile and moderately loud audible feedback are pro- 
duced when the switch is pressed. The paddles have a volcano- 
shaped knob that allows you to g^ab them along either the two- 
inch outside diameter or the one-inch inner knob. Molded in the 
center of each knob is the identifying 0 or 1. 

Continuing on the positive side, there's the five-foot shield- 
ed cable that includes a unique strain relief that slides into one 
of the slots on the back of the Apple. Also included is a ground 
connection to the Apple's case (assuming you have one of the 
newer FCC Class B approved Apples). In fact, these were the 
only paddles tested that included a notice of certification by the 
FCC. The Keyboard Company Hand Controllers sell for $29.95.

dimensional control necessary for some programs, a Joystick 
is used. Basically, a Joystick is nothing more than two paddles 
controllsd by one shaft. One control senses movement in the 
vertical direction; the other in the horizontal. Some Joysticks 
have springs that return the shaft to the center position. Joy- 
sticks are also used with graphics programs to create images 
on the screen. We tested the following Joysticks with such a 
program, checking each stick's feel and accuracy. Most Joy- 
sticks also have switch controls which were evaluated as was 
done previously with the paddles. 

A2D Joystick Model 2001. Like their paddles, the A2D Joy- 
stick is a bit too large to hold comfortably in the average hand. 
The switches are again on the back which also was somewhat 
awkward. Since it is more likely that a Joystick may be resting 
on a table when operated rather than being held in the hand, 
this was not considered as much of a disadvantage in their Joy- 
stick as in their paddles. 

From a strictly hardware viewpoint, however, this unit con- 
tains top quality components. The Joystick employs an "open 
gimbal design" such as is found on radio-controlled model air- 
planes. It has a self-centering action but this can be defeated 
by removing two springs. This is accomplished by removing 
first the bottom of the case and then the back of the Joystick as- 
sembly (four screws each) . The springs are then carefully lift- 
ed out, along with a small plastic cam that falls loose. These

parts should be stored in a safe place (taped to the inside of the 
case, for instance) , in the likely event that you may want to re- 
place them. 

With the springs removed, the Joystick has a very smooth 
precise action. The two mechanical trimming devices are use- 
ful for setting the center points when the self-centering action 
is employed ; with the springs removed, they act somewhat to 
center the active portion of the stick's movement. A small 
amount of overtravel occurs at the extreme positions of the 
stick (the computer reaches its limit before the physical stop 
on the stick) , but tiiis is not objectionable and the stick's out- 
put is very linear. The model 2001 connects to the Apple via a 
seven-foot round cable. Price is $44.95. 

TG Joystick. The TG Joystick is also sef-centerlng, with 
two trimmer levers to calibrate the center position. This fea- 
ture can be disabled by removing eight screws and two 
springs. These springs are very easy to reach for removal or 
installation. As for precision, thejoystlck moves quite smooth- 
ly and is matched almost perfectly to the Apple's range. There 
was virtually no overtravel. 

This unit also contains two large buttons Just to the left of 
the Joystick. These switches are identical to the ones found on 
the TG Paddles and are therefore subject to the same critique. 
A four-foot ribbon cable connects the unit to the Apple ; this ca- 
ble carries all sixteen pins of the game port into the Joystick 
box, thereby making it possible to customize the interface If 
desired. The TG Joystick goes for $59.96. 

The Keyboard Company Joystick II. Looking as if it were 
made by Apple Computer themselves, this Joystick contains 
two switches. One is a small square pushbutton for switch 0. 
The other is a toggle switch that controls input #1. This switch 
has three positions. When pushed to the left, the switch latches 
on; when pushed to the right, the switch makes momentary 
contact and then springs back to the middle position. This may 
have some advantage for certain programs, but with our 
Raster Blaster test it was clearly a drawback. The Joystick op- 
eration was slightly less precise than that of the previous units, 
but this was not deemed to be too significant. The Keyboard 
Company certainly deserves credit for styling their products to 
be a perfect match for the Apple computer. The Joystick sells 
for $49.95 

Other Game Port Devices. The convenience of the game 
I/O port has not been overlooked by other nongame related de- 
vices. There are light pens, copy protection devices, shift key 
modifications, and even modems that connect through the 
game port. Because this port contains four digital outputs, 
three digital and four analog inputs, plus power and a utility 
strobe, an enormous range of products can be interfaced 
through it. 

Symtec BSR X-10 Control. If you have considered using the 
Apple to control lights and appliances within your home, this 
product may interest you. If you connect the small ultrasonic 
transducer (that is, speaker) to the game port, you make it 
possible for the computer to send command signals to the BSR 
X-10 series command console. The X-10 system is a widely 
available line of products designed specifically for remote con- 
trol of AC-powered devices. The Symtec interface comes with 
software on cassette that allows the Apple to duplicate the 
command functions available on the BSR ultrasonic remote 
(that is, turn on, off, dim, or brighten one of sixteen remote de- 
vices, or turn all on and off) . The addition of a clock/calendar 
card could make the Apple a powerful controller for the home.

The next step would be to add appropriate analog and digital 
inputs such as temperature, precipitation, switch closures, and 
so on to make the system truly intelligent. This would mean 
that you could do such things as having the sprinkling system 
automatically skip a cycle if it has been raining, or design an 
efficient lighting system for your home. This device sells for 
$49.95. 

ABT Softkey. The Softkey from Advanced Business Tech- 
nology is an auxiliary keypad containing fifteen user-defin- 
able switches. They are housed in a sturdy Noryl injection- 
molded plastic case that is styled and colored to match the Ap- 
ple. Each key has a removable plastic top under which a small 
identification label can be placed. A pre-printed sheet of popu- 
lar labels is also included. 

Operation of the Softkey requires a machine-language driv- 
er routine that is linked into the Apple through the normal in- 
put vector. Thus, output from the Softkey is handled just as if it 
were typed on the keyboard. Each key can be assigned the 
equivalent of up to eleven normal keystrokes (for example, 
one key could be programmed to type catalog so that pressing 
this single key would cause the directory to be displayed) . 

Along with the driver is a table of key definitions that de- 
termines what character or string of characters will be 
"typed" for each Softkey. These definitions can be created us- 
ing the supplied program or one of several standard sets can 
be used. For example, complete instructions are provided on 
how to modify Apple's word processing program, Apple Writ- 
er. After you've made the appropriate patches (done by sim- 
ply typing exec tedmod), the supplied key labels can be in- 
serted. Now all of the cursor movement and various other 
commands can be accessed at either keyboard. However, func- 
tions that normally require one or more escape and/or control 
keystrokes can now be activated by pressing a single button on 
the Softkey. Ifigure 1 shows the layout and definition of the 
keys when used with Apple Writer. The only drawback en- 
countered with this modification is that it may not be compat- 
ible with other patches such as for a lower-case input device. 
The Softkey sells for $150. Pascal software is also available for 
$50. 

ABT BarWand. Another interesting device from Advanced 
Business Technology is their BarWand. About the size of a 
large pen, this wand is used to read various tjrpes of printed 
digital bar codes, such as the UPC labels found on most prod- 
ucts. Inside the wand are a small LED light source and a light

sensor. As the wand is moved over a label, light reflected from 
the light and dark bars is registered by the computer. By com- 
paring the reflected pattern against a known code, you can 
identify an item. 

Many different codes can be read by the BarWand with the 
appropriate software ; included in the package are routines for 
reading UPC, ABT's LabelCode IV, and Paperbyte codes. This 
last code is used for distributing programs in a machine-read- 
able printed form. This makes it feasible, for instance, to in- 
clude program listings in a magazine article. 

When using the BarWand, it is important to move the wand 
at a relatively constant speed. This takes a little practice, but 
soon it becomes easy to read most labels with one pass. If a la- 
bel is read incorrectly, it will not register; valid data is usually 
signaled by a beep from the Apple speaker. Variations in the 
scanning speed and direction (most codes can be read in either 
direction) are compensated for by the software driver routine. 
Furthermore, a switch control on the side of the wand that is 
activated with the thumb allows you to activate the wand only 
when needed so that extraneous signals are not produced when 
the wand is not scanning. 

Various other packages are available to work with the Bar- 
Wand. Some of these allow the wand to read other codes such 
as LabelCode V, Code 39, Codabar, and Two-of-Flve. These 
codes are widely used in industry, each with its own advan- 
tages. ABT also has software for printing out these codes on 
many of the popular graphics printers. All of the read and print 
software is available for use with either Basic or Pajscal. The 
BarWand sells for $195. Optional read or print packages are $75 
each. 

Paddle-Adapple. With all of the paddles, joysticks, light 
pens, protection keys, and other devices to select from, it can 
become quite tedious to plug each device in and out as needed. 
This is especially true if you keep disk drives, a monitor, or 
anjd^hing else on top of your computer. Fortunately, several de- 
vices on the market now make this task much easier. One such 
device is the Paddle-Adapple from Southern California Re- 
search Group. This small device attaches to the outside of the 
Apple with double-sided adhesive foam. A short ribbon cable 
connects the unit to the game I/O socket in the computer. 

The Paddle-Adapple has two sockets that accommodate a 
pair of game I/O accessories. A switch can be used to select be- 
tween devices. The real power of this unit is that it hajs a con- 
figuration socket that provides a great deal of flexibility in set- 
ting up various devices. For example, it is possible to reverse 
the X and Y axis of a joystick simply by moving two jumpers. 
Another unique feature of this device is that it includes a cable 
which can be plugged into the cassette jack to add one more 
switch input to the three available at the game I/O socket. This 
makes it possible to use four game paddles, each with its own 
switch. Of course, the software being used must be written to 
take advantage of the extra switch input. The only complaint 
we had was that the connecting ribbon cable was too short to 
allow us to mount the unit toward the front of the computer. At

$29.95, the Paddle- Adapple makes an excellent investment for 
the serious game player. 

Select-a-Port. If you have more than two game port de- 
vices, you may be interested to know about Select-a-Port, a 
five-socket expansion device from TG Products. The long, thin 
case comes with little "hangers" that enable you to mount it on 
the side of the computer. Or it can Just sit on the table, resting 
on its four rubber feet. The connecting cable is long enough 
that you can place the device wherever you want. 

Above each socket is a switch to control which devices are 
active. This switching is accomplished using diodes to connect 
or isolate each device from the computer's control lines. Any 
number of sockets can be used simultaneously, with two ex- 
ceptions. The first socket is always active, and is in fact com- 
pletely in parallel with the Apple port (the switch above this 
socket is not used). This arrangement ensures compatibility 
with special devices such as copy protection "keys" that might 
not function properly through the diode switching. Of course, 
no more than one paddle control should be connected at any 
time to a given paddle input. The other exception is that the 
paddle controls of socket #2 are connected to the third and 
fourth paddle inputs of the computer. This, of course, allows 
four-player games using two sets of paddles or dual joysticks 
(only two switch Inputs can be used, however) . This still leaves 
three completely independent sockets for your other devices. 
Unless you are writing an article on game I/O devices, this 
many should be more than adequate. The Select-a-Port was In- 
valuable in running our tests on the various paddles and joy- 
sticks ; it retails for $59.95. 

Next Month. As you can see, there's a lot of hardware to 
choose for your game I/O. There probably are several other 
paddles and joysticks available In addition to those reviewed 
here, and more devices are likely to appear in the future. Some 
new items have also recently appeared to eliminate the prob- 
lems of using the Dip connectors that are too fragile for con- 
stant plugging in and out. 



To add even further to the possibilities, there are two new 
products that will greatly expand the usefulness of the game 
I/O port. One of these is the Joyport from Slrius Software. This 
unit allows selection between one or two Apple-type pad- 
dle/joysticks or up to two Atari-type joysticks. Atari joysticks 
are not true analog controls, but instead provide switch Inputs 
whenever a lever is moved forward, back, left, or right. This 
requires additional hardware (In the Joyport) as well as soft- 
ware to convert this information to analog motion. 

Another exciting new product is the Freedom wireless joy- 
stick. As its name implies, this joystick gives you the freedom 
to move around with your control unhindered by the usual con- 
necting cable. The BVeedom and Joyport will be described In 
detail next month.

Part 2 
of an 
Interrupted 

Article 



BY DAH FISCHER AHD MOKAH P. (AFFREY 



Hello — you're back. Finish that book? Well, then, let's get 
down to biisiness and hope we can get a thing or two accom- 
plished without any more interruption. 

Last month we introduced the concept of a microcomputer 
interrupt. We covered some basics of machine-langfuage code 
operation and how the processor knows it has been inter- 
rupted. We described the four types of interrupts that com- 
monly occur. 

We covered some important topics such ajs registers (proc- 
essor or status, accumulator, x, y, stack pointer) , and how they 
must be protected during interrupt processing. To complete 
the story, we will cover how Apple software Is used to proc- 
ess the interrupt event and some problems we found and 
overcame. 

But first, if we may interrupt just once, let's consider some 
of the design decisions that went into the development of the 
Apple II. 

Who could have foreseen in 1977 or 1978 the uses to which 
microcomputers would be put in the next four years? We doubt 
that the creators of the Apple ever dreamed in the early days 
that there would be 400,000 Apple lis in the world by 1982. The 
Apple II has remained virtually unchanged since its introduc- 
tion, yet the limits to the range of its application do not ap- 
pear to have been approached. The plug-in cards and software 
that have been developed for it make the Apple II adaptable 
both to the business environment and to the highly technical 
control application environment. 

The Apple II is a marvel of modem technology and engfi- 
neering insight. If it were being built now, the Apple II would 
be designed differently. This is not meant as criticism. The 
idea of making a computer that is an open book to competing 
manufacturers is a model of foresight. In hindsight, however, 
several design decisions were made then that have the effect of 
making certain things somewhat difficult now. 

Do you remember when personal computers were called 



"hobby computers"? If you were designing a hobby com- 
puter, you'd use different criteria than if you were designing a 
business computer. That explains how the Apple II happens to 
have a forty-column upper-case display; its designers didn't 
anticipate all the business uses to which the Apple II would be 
put. "The limitations on the screen are the most obvious, but 
there are other design decisions that arose from the hobby 
computer mindset. 

A number of functions that occur within a computer re- 
quire precise timing. One method of fulfilling the timing re- 
quirements is to incorporate hardware timers that interrupt 
the computer at rigidly defined intervals. This Involves hard- 
ware that is not provided in the Apple II; it also Involves fairly 
sophisticated software. 

A less elegant solution to the timing problems involves us- 
ing the microprocessor itself as a timer. If the microprocessor 
executes a loop a known number of times, the exact timing of 
that loop can be determined. With one known time, a limited 
clock can be constructed in software. Here's an example of one 
such clock. 

LDA #100 ; sot timer 
STA TIMER 

LOOP DEC TIMER ; count times thru the loop 
BNE LOOP ; if not zero keep counting 

This routine will delay the program precisely 806 memory 
cycles (788 microseconds) . The Apple uses timers like this to 
put data on disks, read the game paddles, and, in the case of 
the Apple Serial Interface Card, to serialize the bits of mem- 
ory cell going out of communications line (to a printer or mo- 
dem). Timers like this work; they are versatile and they are 
cheap. 

When a Cheap Solution Is Expensive. Software timer pro- 
grams are cheap if you have nothing else to do with your mi- 
croprocessor while you wait for the timer to "time out." They

work as long as they don't get interrupted. 

Aha! You noticed. Using the processor for a timer is in- 
compatible with having interrupts operating in the system. 
The interrupt will do its Job — and disfigure timing loops — with- 
out the timing loop knowing that the wrong amount of time has 
actually elapsed. 

Because of such software timers being used with DOS, NMI 
interrupts cannot be used in the Apple II while disks are 
operating. Showing foresight, the system has activated the 
IRQ mask, however, allowing the Interrupts to be ignored 
while time-critical tasks are being done. 

Since we know of no serious software that doesn't use disks, 
the rest of this article will be restricted to IRQ interrupts. 

The conflict between IRQ interrupts and software timers 
can be resolved by setting the IRQ disable bit in the P register 
(the SEI instruction in an assembly language program) be- 
fore entering the timing loop. When the timer runs out, the as- 
sembly program may reenable IRQ interrupts by a CLI in- 
struction. In fact, the routine in DOS that reads and writes to 
the disk does just this to protect itself from IRQs. 

Using interrupts loith the game I/O paddle and high-speed 
serial card code doesn't work. The Mordtor routine that reads 
the game paddles does not properly disable IRQ. Apple's Se- 
rial Interface Card protects its timers from interrupts but errs 
in its restoration method, so an interrupt with the high speed 
serial card cannot work. 

In a nutshell, the results of these design limitations are: 

1. The Apple II disks can operate with IRQ interrupts ac- 
tive but will mask them out while accessing the disks with 
time-critical loops. 

2. The game paddle routine in the Monitor will give er- 
roneous results if interrupts are active. 

3. The Apple Serial Interface Card cannot be used when 
interrupts are active. 

The F8 ROM Problem. There's one more design problem 
that must be handled before Interrupts can be run with DOS 
active. Earlier, we described In general how the Apple deter- 



mines whether it has an IRQ or a BRK. It saves the A register 
to gain a working register and then checks to see if the BRK bit 
is set in the P register. The entire P8 problem revolves around 
where the A register is stored. 

How the Monitor and DOS Share Page Zero. Another small 
digression is required here. Page zero, consisting of the first 
256 memory locations in the Apple, has special significance for 
the 6502. 

Locations $45 through $49 are used by the Monitor to store 
the A, X, Y, P, and S registers during a break or at other times. 
Special routines are Included in the Monitor to store all micro- 
processor values in these memory locations and retrieve them 
later. 

Location $45 is also used as a multipurpose Monitor work 
area, called A5H. Some routines in DOS that are not protected 
from IRQ Interrupts use location $45. This is the crux of the 
problem. Sometimes the contents of location $45 are very Im- 
portant to the proper operation of the active program. DOS 
uses the location for hsave and hload operations. If an inter- 
rupt occurs at this time, the wrong memory area can be stored 
to the disk. Other errors can occur that destroy existing files 
stored on the disk in the drive. 

Location $45 is where the Monitor stores the A register 
while it determines whether it has a BRK or an IRQ. As noted 
above, this can be a deadly flaw unless DOS commands and 
some Monitor routines are protected from IRQs. 

When we wrote Doubletime Printer we realized that It 
would not be a very useful piece of software if we required 
users to modify all their DOS programs to protect location $45. 
Instead we decided to eliminate the location $45 conflict by 
modifying the Monitor ROM. The only software that would 
have to be modified would be Interrupt handlers — which we 
saw as a minimal problem because very few Apple users are 
already implementing Interrupt-drlven applications. 

Let's look at what the IRQ routine does in the Apple Moni- 
tor and then at the way we changed It to permit wider use of 
interrupts.

If you can, refer to page 143 of the Apple II Reference Man- 
ual. In the middle of the page is a routine named IRQ. The first 
thing it does is store the A register in location $45 ("A<X"). 
The next two instructions pull the P register from the stack 
and restore the stack. (The P register had been put on the 
stack automatically by the 6502 when it encountered the BRK 
or IRQ.) 

The next three instructions move the BRK flag to the posi- 
tion showing the minus condition. The next instruction tests 
this bit and transfers control to the break routine if there was a 
break (minus condition) . If no break occurred, it must have 
been an IRQ, so the next instruction jumps to the routine whose 
address is stored in page three at location $3FE,3FF. At this 
point, the user's interrupt routine takes over. 

The interrupt handling routine can restore the system 
status flag by loading A with the contents of location $45 and 
doing an RTI (return from interrupt) . The RTI restores the P 
register and the program counter. The only thing lost is the 
original content of location $45. But that can be fatal. It can 
even destroy disk files. 

If there's no user IRQ routine, the indirect jump to $3FE 
transfers control to the Monitor. It is the equivalent of a CALL- 
155. The stack still has the P register and the PC from the in- 
terrupt. The Monitor doesn't know what to do with these, so the 
program that was interrupted is probably irretrievably 
bombed. This is rarely a problem because few programs will 
enable IRQs. Fewer still will do so without first setting the 
page three vectors. 

The Doubletime Interrupt Vector. Consider what can be 
done to protect location $45. The Apple Monitor decides 
whether there is a BRK or IRQ before passing control to the 
user routine: The sequence of operation can be modified to 
pass control to the user routine before making the determina- 
tion about IRQ or BRK. 

With the doubletime ROM in place, the IRQ routine starts 
out with the indirect jump to the location stored in $3FE. It is 
left to the user to decide if it is a BRK or an IRQ. At the time 
the user gets control, all the registers are still set as they were 
at the time of the interrupt, except the P and PC registers. Lo- 
cation $45 has not been altered. 

New Responsibilities. In addition to the register-saving re- 
sponsibilities that the user program has always had with in- 
terrupt processing, the Interrupt handler program must now 
also determine whether it is processing a BRK or an IRQ. 
Further, it must save and restore the A register. The routines 
must not restore the A register from location $45, but rather 
from whatever location was used to save them. The rest of the 
IRQ routine of the autostart Monitor is essentially unchanged. 
If the page three IRQ vector $3FE,3FF points to $FA43, the 
doubletime Monitor will make the determination between IRQ 
and BRK. It will process a BRK with the same code that the 
autostart ROM uses. For an IRQ, it will jump to the Monitor. 

DOS Patcher. Along with Doubletime Printer and the en- 
hanced F8 ROM, we have included our program DOS Patcher 
on the Doubletime disk. It has been placed permanently in the 
public domain and is included in the San F'rancisco Apple Core 
Disk of the month. The most Important purpose of this set of 
utilities is to make changes to the DOS on the disk that you're 
booting to handle the changed ROM appropriately. This utility 
win quickly alter any unprotected DOS to point the IRQ vector 
to $FA43. This will handle IRQ and BRK just Uke the autostart 
ROM with no user interrupt routine. 

What will happen if we experience an IRQ when the double- 
time ROM is installed, there is no user routine at $3FE, and 
DOS has not been patched? The same thing that would happen 
if we got an IRQ with the autostart ROM with no user routine : 
we will land in the Monitor (with a beep) . What will happen if 
we get a BRK? The same thing— we will land in the Monitor. 
Unless DOS is altered, a BRK will be processed exactly like an 
IRQ. No damage will be done to the existing program, al- 
though the program will stop. 

Tips For Interrupt Programmers. 

1. Interrupt programs must be In assembly langfuage. 



2. Interrupt programs must be located in memory that will 
not be used by the foreground program. 

3. The interrupt vector at $3FE,3FF must be set before 
interrupts are enabled. 

4. The interrupt program must restore all registers to the 
condition they were in before the interrupt. 

Before we close, we'd like to suggest some thingB that can 
be done with Interrupts: data acquisition (the outside world 
provides the Interrupt when the data is ready), spooling (a 
periodic interrupt to move a character to the pointer) , or your 
application that we haven't thought of. There's lots of spare 
time available in the Apple. 

Concentration at Last — Maybe. Who hasn't wished for a 
weekend cabin in the country with no utilities, no access to 
worry, no — well — no interruptions? And it's possible; you can 
get away from Interruptions if you really want to. 

So too with your Apple. When the immediate processing 
ends, you can turn off the Interrupt routine and leave your Ap- 
ple in peace. 

I've said enough, and you've got to go. Your phone is 
ringing. JM 



Technical writer, programmer, and consultant Morgan 
Caffrey got tired of twiddling his thumbs while his Apple 
printed out his work. So he started fiddling instead of tvoid- 
dling, and now his Apple prints while it plays. To see that your 
Apple got this broadening opportunity too, Caffrey became 
partners with Dan Fischer. 

From managing "the world's largest commercial mes- 
sage switching computer center" to teaching folks to interrupt 
one of the world's smallest computers may sound like a 
strange career progression to some, but to Dan Fischer, any- 
thing to do with the Apple is better than not. Formerly a sys- 
tems analyst for Univac, Fischer's love affair with his Apple

O P E n DISCUSSION 



from poge 22 

were delighted to see a review of clock/ 
calendar cards in the September issue of 
Softalk. However, we could not help but 
feel that the article did great injustice in 
the comparisons of the clocks reviewed. 
Part of this injustice is revealed in the au- 
thor's misconception that "some real- 
time clocks also do other things for you. 
Added features include built-in inter- 
faces for printers and other accessories 
and. ..." There are several multifunc- 
tion boards available for the Apple II, but 
it should be made clear that these boards 



combine several different functions on 
one circuit card, not several clock 
features. Unfortunately, each of the indi- 
vidual functions tends to be compro- 
mised by the attempt to get in as much as 
possible for a reasonable cost. This is 
analogous to the all-in-one stereo sys- 
tem. It may be a bargain, but you can al- 
ways get better performance and more 
flexibility with separate components. 

What amazed us the most was the 
way Mr. Kaapke evaluated the individ- 
ual clock boards. After expounding the 



many uses for a real-time clock, he still 
found the Mountain Computer CPS card 
"first and fanciest." Yet, he gives little 
information on the clock portion of this 
card. Its lack of interrupt generation is 
only mentioned in passing. The fact that 
it may not work with many programs 
written for the company's own Apple 
Clock without modification is not noted. 
Nor is the lack of year and day of week 
information in the emulation mode. Auto- 
matic time and date stamping of files? 
No. Pascal support? Not included. Use it 
in an Apple III? Forget it! 

Next, the Thunderclock Plus was re- 
viewed. Again, a lot of hoopla about BSR 
control but little information on the clock. 
Does it keep track of the year? No. Pas- 
cal support? 1.1 version only. Automatic 
Filer update is done with the exec func- 
tion and therefore cannot be used from 
within a program. Apple Clock compati- 
bility is very good but slot-finding rou- 
tines will require modification to find the 
Thunderclock. 

Finally, the author comes to the , 
Superclock II and it seems he can't find 
much to say about it — its only a clock ! It 
has "no X-10 accessory" and "only two 
operational modes." He then counters, 
"But the Superclock has more interrupt 
intervals then the Thunderclock." While 
this statement is factually correct, it to- 
tally misses the point. The important ad- 
vantage of the Superclock's interrupt 
capabilities is in the wide selection of in- 
terrupt rates. These span from less than 
one microsecond (1,024 per second) to 
one hour. It is very useful to have one sec- 
ond interrupts, for example. But the 
Thunderware's interrupt frequencies 
only go down to a minimum of sixty-four 
times a second. This places a much 
greater overhead on the foreground pro- 
gram, causing it to slow down or possi- 
bly miss interrupts. 

Practically unmentioned are some of 
the Superclock's other features: 

Rechargeable Ni-Cd battery back-up 

Day of week and year support 

Full Pascal support, including Filer 

update 

Millisecond timing routines 
All these functions are directly con- 
cerned with the capabilities of a real- 
time clock, which is what the article was 
supposedly written about — not "other 
functions." Certainly, one should take in- 
to account these other functions; but be 
aware of what you may be giving up to 
get them. 

We brought the Superclock II to the 
market only after we had completed all 
the software to make it an easy to use, 
functional system. We were the first to 
offer automatic dating of files for DOS 3.2 
and 3.3. Our Pascal software was 
thoroughly researched so that automatic 
updating of the F^ler and any diskette 
could be accomplished directly and un- 



ASSEMBLER/TEACHER 



This program makes your APPLE* teach you assembler! We 
assume you know BASIC already, and now you'd like to learn 
APPLE* assembler. You need three things (two heavies and a 
friend) . . . 

1 . The APPLE II Reference Manual (heavy), 

2. A good 6502 assembler manual (another heavy: ask for both 
at your APPLE* dealer), and 

3. ASSEMBLER TEACHER, a friendly program that takes you 
right through the learning barrier! 

ASSEMBLER TEACHER will soon have you eating those manuals for 
breakfast. And you'll never outgrow ASSEMBLER TEACHER, since it 
has tools an expert can use even more than a novice. Here'stiow 
ASSEMBLER TEACHER works: 



• ASSEMBLER TEACHER prowls your APPLE'S memory page by 
page, drawing a map of what it finds. 

•ASSEMBLER TEACHER shows your CPU running in slow motion on 
your screen, so you can see exactly what the operations are 
doing to the registers and the stack (a great debugging tool). 

•ASSEMBLER TEACHER exposes the mysteries of hexadecimal, 
two's complement, character and other data representa- 
tions, instantly translating from any version to all others. 

•ASSEMBLER TEACHER gives you the concepts you need to 
cope with assembler, using simple on-line lessons that grab 
you by the keyboard and make you play your way to 
knowledge. 

•ASSEMBLER TEACHER is written by John Fairfield, 
a Ph.D. in Computer Science who regularly 
teaches assembler. A RAM 
Mini-Assembler is included.

The Good, the Gentle, the Important 

In accordance with the January issue, I 
am letting you know. I do not want to 
miss this issue or any issue in the future. 

Since I have taken the time to go this 
far, I will just take a few words to com- 
pliment you on the publication. I have 
watched with marvel as the expansion 
process takes place. 

The departmental sections are of par- 
ticular interest to me. Wagner's column 
has been the shining light, encouraging 
me to do some simple Assembly /Basic 
interface programming. I completely 
agree with his philosophy of using Basic 
except when the speed or special situa- 
tions require the use of Assembly Lan- 
guage programming. I think I under- 
stand the USR function but would like to 
see Roger address it some day. 

You can count on my check for the 
magazine when the new distribution pol- 
icy is instigated. Between Softalk and 



Nibble you get the best of both worlds. 

Some time ago I recall a reader who 
was interested in a "deaf terminal." I 
have a deaf son and very recently pur- 
cased Novation's Apple Cat II with the 
deaf options. Bill Ctollier is the project en- 
gfineer at Novation in Tarzana, Califor- 
nia. He seems to be a receptive individ- 
ual as I have discussed several improve- 
ments to the "Deaf Software" with him. 
The program does work in Its present 
form but lacks many features of Com- 
ware II which could and should be in- 
cluded. You may want to evaluate it. I 
am sure that there are plenty of Apple 
users that would be interested in this ca- 
pability. I do not know of another 
modem/software package that allows 
communication within the deaf network. 

Thanks for your ear. Keep the thing 
going.

Friendly Apple People In Japan 
In September of last year I had occasion 
to pack my trusty suitcase and equally 
trusty Apple for a five-month research 
hiatus to the land of the rising sun and 
Honda automobiles. Knowing I was ven- 
turing into unknown computing waters I 
braced myself by lashing VisiCalc and 
WordStar to the main mast and set off on 
what I expected to be a journey fraught 
with dangers; after all, I'm constantly 
reminded of the coming Japanese com- 



puter invajsion and here I was salljrlng 
forth into lands (and CPUs) unknown. 

Pear not! ! Fellow travelers, a warm 
welcome, a cold beer, and a hot comput- 
ing time in old Tokyo can be had as I 
soon found out. 

First, the Akihabara district of that 
fair city can only be described as a hack- 
er's dream, containing as it does nearly 
twenty blocks of electronlca to satisfy 
even the most rabid midnight wire-wrap- 
per. More important, it was here I was in- 
troduced to the two gentlemen who 
proved to be my "open sesame" to the 
world of Japan and Apples, Shlgeharu 
Ikeda, owner of Compucraft store, and 
Dr. Steven Bellamy, a British writer cur- 
rently living over there. 

Both gentlemen took a lot of time and 
trouble to make me (and incidentally any 
other fellow traveler) very welcome. In 
particular. Dr. Bellamy made special ef- 
fort to show me around and intro- 
duce me to quite a few Apple users; his 
knowledge of computers and computing 
was outstanding and I considered it a 
privilege to have met him. 

So as I bid farewell— a warm sake in 
hand — I would like to take the chance 
through your fine magazine to say a big 
thanks to all the Apple-people over here 
and to tell other interested voyagers that 
the land of Shogun is alive, well, and 
computing— Apple style!

Wlien Porter Loring Writes, 
He Knows It's Letter Perfect 

BV JOHATHAd ttlLLEk 



Mild-mannered Porter Loring Jr. is 
joking, of course, when he talks about di- 
vorce, but the man from San Antonio 
does have a little marital problem. For 
over a year now he's been having an af- 
fair, an insidious infatuation that swal- 
lows evenings and Saturdays whole. For- 
tunately for Porter, his wife knows the 
identity of the other woman. Her hus- 
band's been smitten by an Apple. 

The Apple a day that is keeping Port- 
er away occupies a second-story bed- 
room in the Loring's San Antonio home. 
He apologizes for the bare appearance of 
the room, recently vacated by his young- 
est child, as he introduces a visitor to the 
object of his desire, an Apple II Plus — so 
faithful, so smart, sitting there along the 



west wall with his Epson printer, four 
disk drives, and a library of programs. 

"I don't think there's anything that 
comes close to comparing with an Apple 
as far as value, flexibility, and ability," 
he boasts. "The Apple's never been 
wrong, though I've been wrong ever 
since." 

Loring's laughing and looking very 
much the doting father, all crinkly with 
pride. "It's like talking about your chil- 
dren," he says. "Like when it's broken, 
you feel your children are sick." 

A small picture of a powerboat, the 
only decoration on the wall above, re- 
calls an earlier Loring passion. When his 
four children were growing up, the fam- 
ily would drive the one hundred fifty 



miles south to C!orpus Christi on week- 
ends to ply the Texas gulf and try their 
luck in marlin and sailfish tournaments. 
It was great sport, but the real fun for 
Loring was not the cruising and the fish- 
ing; it was the tinkering. 

"It was working on the boat. If I had a 
problem it was necessary to get in there 
and fix it. No manufacturer has ever 
built anything the way I want it, so I've 
got to alter it. As soon as I had added ev- 
erything to that boat — put in every kind 
of radar— I lost interest." 

The Start of Something Big. As the 
kids grew older, the weekend trips few- 
er. Porter Loring was slowly but surely 
becoming a man without a hobby. For a 
while, he made the most of pipe collect-

ing, but his tinkerer's nature begged an- 
other escape and his family urged him to 
find one — soon. 

"And I said, 'You're telling me to go 
and fall in love. Those thingfs happen on 
their own — you don't decide you're going 
to go out and fall in love.' " 

Then it happened. Radio Shack came 
out with a little pocket computer and Lor- 
ing was "bitten by the bug, the venom 
permeating my body." He was fasci- 
nated, all right, but the machine was lit- 
tle more than a sophisticated calculator 
and he had to have more. He had to have 
an Apple. Not only for itself, not only for 
its business potential in data manage- 
ment and word processing, but because it 
filled another, more basic need. 

"I live in a real intangible world," 
says Porter Loring, funeral director. 
"My problems are by and large intangi- 
ble. They're people and emotional prob- 
lems and I find a great escape dealing 
with tangible things." 

Man is the only creature on this planet 
that ritually disposes of its dead. Death, 
the cardinal fact of life, has preoccupied 
the world's g^eat religions and a species 
that refuses to accept it as the definitive 
end of life. It is, in short, a very, very se- 
rious business. 

In the course of a year. Porter Loring 
Mortuary will handle twelve himdred fu- 
nerals, roughly 20 percent of the city's 
business. The firm was founded by Lor- 
ing's father, a former railroad worker, 
some sixty years ago when this historic 
southwestern cowtown ranked as the 
largest city in Texas. (Today it places 
third behind Houston and Dallas and 
owes much in economic vitality to the 
presence of seventeen area military in- 
stallations.) 

Strength of Tradition. Perhaps it was 
inevitable with the handle of "junior" fol- 
lowing his name, but Porter never for- 
mally addressed the question of whether 
to enter the family business: he Just did. 

"For my generation and my father's 
generation things that were family things 
were accepted as family thingfs," he ex- 
plains. "I just never made a decision." 

Not that he has regrets. Life has been 
good to him. Loring is active in state and 
national fimeral director associations 
and he's a prominent civic figure — past 
president of more organizations than he 
cares to reel off and the man recently 
tapped to raise $1.5 million for a new pub- 
lic radio station transmitter. And then 
there's his work. 

"My personality is such that I feel 
kind of rewarded by the strokes you get 
in this business," he says. "If you're open 
with people, if you're honest with them 
and are really sincere about doing what 
they want, they can tell." 

The business has its rewards, but it 
also has its drawbacks. You're always 
concerned about going over the line, 
about saying something that will upset 
the delicate balance of emotions when a 



family faces this major crisis — accept- 
ing the death of a loved one; accepting 
death. 

That's problem enough, but of course 
undertakers — fimeral directors, in con- 
temporary parlance — have others. Me- 
dia problems: an image, in literature and 
the popular press, that vascillates be- 
tween a cadaverous figure in stovepipe 
hat to an unctuous charlatan bilking sob- 
bing, destitute widows. It's another mat- 
ter about which Loring feels passionate. 

A Delicate Balance. "We're an indus- 
try of response," he pleads. "We're here 
to respond to people's needs. We're not 
here to guide them or tell them what to 
do. We really don't manipulate people or 
try to overcharge or take advantage of 
the situation. Frankly, we bend over 
backward not to, almost to the point of 
not being any help at all." 

Consider the purchase of the casket as 
satirized in The Loved One, the movie 
send-up of the three-billion-doUar-a-year 
fimeral industry. It's the classic stereo- 
type: the grieving, gtiilt-ridden relative, 
putty in the hands of the oily salesman 
(played by LIberace) . Now consider Lor- 
ing's approach. When families come in to 
select a casket among the thirty on dis- 
play, Loring leaves them to make their 
own decisions. 

"Obviously they're not going to be co- 



erced into anything that will be contrary 
to what they think 's appropriate," he 
says. "Then, on the other hand, they've 
never bought a casket before. They don't 
know anything about them and there's 
nobody to ask questions of. In other 
words, when it gets to making decisions 
in areas involving the expenditure of dol- 
lars, we just back off. We're somewhat 
afraid of being misinterpreted as trying 
to sell a bill of goods, so it's almost an 
overreaction." 

But there's an eminently practical 
reason for this approach. Many times, 
says Loring, a family will be accompa- 
nied by a "hostile," a person whose role 
is to see that they're not taken advan- 
tage of. When Loring removes himself 
from the selection process, suddenly this 
family advocate finds he has no function. 

"So all he can do is be our advocate 
and when they come out, this guy's atti- 
tude has changed an entire 180 degrees. 
He's become your confidant. It may 
sound like manipulation but it's not. It's 
just that if you leave people to do what 
they want to do, you don't have to worry 
about it. You just have to know when to 
be quiet and let people answer their own 
questions." 

On funeral matters generally, says 
Loring, people behave a lot like fish : they 
school together. They find an area that

fills their needs; in San Antonio that 
translates into funerals averaging $1,- 
700, give or take $200. 

Many supersensitive fvineral direc- 
tors would probably blame muckraking 
author Jessica Mitford {The American 
Way of Death) for the industry's image 
problems. Loring, surprisingly, takes a 
different tack. He actually thinks the 
book, which accused the industry of cal- 
culated overcharges, produced some un- 
intended benefits. 

"Here was this sensational book and 
suddenly death was not a dirty word any- 
more. People started talking about 
death, djdng, and bereavement at cock- 
tail parties and dinner parties and sud- 
denly researchers were discovering a 
whole new field to look into. I think his- 
tory could record that her book probably 
created the beginning of the most healthy 
approach to death. Funeral directors 
were saying, 'Let me look at myself. Am 
I real? Is what I'm doing for real?' " 

Planning Ahead. Mitford's book dove- 
tailed with the sixties impulse for great- 
er personal freedom and expression of 
feelings to produce another anomaly: 
prearranged funerals, otherwise known 
as "pre-need." Today, the business of 
handling funeral arrangements before 
the day of reckoning is growing by leaps 
and bounds, says Loring, a past presi- 
dent of the National P\ineral Directors 
Association. He averages 1.5 families a 
day, he reports, and "that's without ag- 
gressively soliciting the business." 

It's a highly customized service, he 
explains. Some people will want to pre- 
pay their funerals and work out the ar- 
rangements to the minutest detail. 
Others will elect to drop in and file a card 
simply indicating general preferences. In 
states like Tex£is, says Loring, where an 
individual can prepay at today's prices, 
there's also an economic incentive. Pre- 
payment is largely a middle-class phe- 
nomenon, says Loring, and particularly 
strong in California and Florida, states 
with large immigrant, single, and elder- 
ly constituencies. 

"I think people feel that at some time 
in their life they must put things in prop- 
er order," observes Loring. "Either they 
want to relieve their children of the deci- 
sion and financial obligation or they want 
to make sure that their wishes are 
expressed." 

Loring is a great believer in self-ex- 
pression, however crazy it may seem. He 
cites the example of a dying woman who 
asked that her coffin be fashioned from a 
tree growing in her front yard ; of a lum- 
berman who wanted his service to be 
said amid the trees he loved; and of the 
grandchildren of a family who honored 
the memory of the deceased by raising 
champagne glasses in a spontaneous 
graveside tribute. 

More often than not, the individual 
touch will be subtler — a family-made ar- 
rangement of flowers for the casket 
taken from the garden of the deceased or 




a few heartfelt words from employers 
and friends. 



"Those are the kinds of things that 
wipe you out emotionally in my busi- 
ness," says Loring. "When you see peo- 
ple varjdng from the norm, you see they 
do it with great feeling and commit- 



ment. A person may be ninety-three and 
have had the most beautiful life in the 
world ; their death is really a victory and 
a release. Their death can be acknowl- 
edged in many ways, as a Christian 
would see, often by celebration, which is 
really a celebration of a successful life. 
When you see people express themselves 
in real gn^t-level expressions of devotion 
and admiration, which is hard for the lay- 
man to do, it just shoots the legs out from 
under you." 

The Right Words. When you live in an 
emotionally charged environment, words 
loom large. You have to be extremely 
careful not only in the words you write, 
says Loring, but in what those words say. 
And those, he adds, may not be the same 
thing. 

"If I'm writing a speech or an article or 
even a policy for people, I have to have 
the flexibility and editability that is avail- 
able on a word processor," he explains. 
"It allows me to change an article from A 
to Z or just to change the whole tone of a 
sentence." 

Loring is a satisfied user of LJK's Let- 
ter Perfect word processing system. It 
isn't his first processor, but it is his fa- 
vorite, thanks to its format flexibility and 
friendly, menu-driven features. Apple

its name might imply. And as for ser- 
vice, LJK can't be beat. 

"Not only does LJK help you with your 
problems, they'll go another mile and 
send you a new disk," says Loring. 

Loring employs Letter Perfect in 
three areas: to compose letters, to write 
speech notes and articles, and to design 
forms he uses in conjunction with his DB 
Master data management system. He 
could dictate letters to a secretary, he ex- 
plains, but he finds something is always 
lost in the translation. The Loring solu- 
tion: rough it out on the word processor, 
then give the secretary the printout for 
retyping. 

That may seem to confound the ad- 
vantages of word processing, but not 
from Loring's standpoint. His is a per- 
sonalized business and computerized cor- 
respondence and billing statements just 
don't fit. 

"In fact," he says, "I had a hard time 
going to electric typewriters because I 
wanted the holes in the paper to show this 
was done by hand — ^that this is a person- 
alized statement and that you're not part 
of a process." 

For similar reasons, Loring rejected 
another state-of-the-art innovation 
proffered by a software salesman: a 
computerized telephone sales pitch fea- 
turing the disembodied voice of Arthur 
Godfrey. 

"It was very sophisticated," says Lor- 
ing, "and very scary." 

As a prominent civic figure and ac- 
tive member in state and national funer- 
al directors associations, Loring is often 
asked to give speeches and write arti- 
cles. It's a chore made less onerous by 
Letter Perfect. A recent association proj- 
ect : forecasting the funeral service of the 
twenty-first century. The result? Laughs 
Loring, "It turned out we didn't know." 

Perhaps his favorite use for Letter 
Perfect is in the design of forms, includ- 
ing one for a pilot data management pro- 
gram he's devised to track business 
trends. After six months of data gather- 
ing, Loring says he has yet to discern any 
observable pattern — "Women seem to do 
pretty much the same as men, the Bap- 
tists pretty much the same as Catho- 
lics"— but the exercise has justified it- 
self, at least to him. 

"Well, my secretary could have done 
this, but I had a lot of fun designing this 
simple little form. It was very easy to do, 
but, hey, I did something." 

Loring would like to do more with this 
program — for that matter, he'd like to 
bone up on machine language — but he's 
not sure he's qualified. 

"A good statistician needs to know 
two things — what information to get and 
what to ask of it. I've got a lot of informa- 
tion, but I'm not sure I'm smart enough 
to know what to ask for." 

New Worlds to Conquer. Whatever 
comes of this project, others are waiting 
in the wings. He's considering bringing 
his computer into the office environ- 



ment, hiring a bookkeeper who isn't 
frightened to death by the sight of an Ap- 
ple, and developing another prog^ram to 
track, if not control, his manpower needs. 
Personnel tends to be a problem area, he 
explains, because not enough qualified 
people are attracted to the work, which 
suffers the additional burden of irreg^a- 
lar hours and minimal pay. 

Finding new business applications for 
his Apple, of course. Is a fine way to justi- 
fy his investment in hardware and soft- 
ware — "I've bought everything you can 
buy for the damn thing," he jokes— but 
he knows it's mostly a glorious hobby and 
a fine excuse for having fun. He can sit in 
front of his CRT, pipe in hand, looking 
pensive and professorial, or amaze in- 
credulous friends who drop by from time 
to time to have Porter "do something," 
as if his Apple were a performing circus 
animal. 

In matters computer, Loring tends to 
be self-effacing. 

"I'm a super example of a little bit of 
learning being a dangerous thing," he 
says. "I've never learned the axiom, 'If it 
works don't fix it.' " 

The wags down at the computer shop 
say there ought to be a lock on his Apple 
to keep him out of it. "But that's part of 
the fun of it," protests Loring. Like put- 
ting chips in backward, misconnecting 



wires and committing that number-one 
no-no: changing a board with the power 
on. 

"If you're really honest with these 
guys and admit you goofed," he ex- 
plains, "they're a lot more responsive 
and you learn a lot more. You don't learn 
a lot blaming it on somebody else." 

The Quality of Life. The fun of com- 
puters and the sobering reality of 
death — they're both an education. After a 
lifetime in the funeral business, Loring is 
constantly reminded of his mortality, of 
the accelerating passage of time — the 
shorter it seems it has been and will be. 

"But it increases certain values you 
have," he reflects. "It's made my family 
and my time mean more to me. Life 
must really have quality to it because it's 
all you have." 

The interview is winding down, but 
Porter Loring, fifty-three, has one part- 
ing observation he'd like to share about 
the binary world. 

"Computers are built on the yes/no. 
When you think of every decision we 
make in life, everything you put into your 
brain, ultimately it resolves down to a 
yes or a no. The compromises even end 
up being yeses and noes. You experience 
something or you don't; you're exposed 
to something or you're not. Essentially, 
it's all the same kind of process." HI

Flash back with us to Ancient Crete . 



Remember when Poseidon gave Minos, the King of Crete, a bull to sacrifice . . . Well, when 
Minos kept it for himself, Poseidon retaliated by making Minos' wife fall in love with the bull. 
The offspring was a rather disagreeable blend of man and bull — the Minotaur. 

Minos decided to have Daedalus build a complex labyrinth to hide the beast. Minotaur was 
kept amused with a regular feeding of twelve youths and twelve maidens. You can imagine 
how popular this was with the Cretans. Enter our hero, Theseus (disguised as a 
mild-mannered victim) who secretly hoped to kill the Minotaur. The King's daughter 
(naturally) fell in love with Theseus and gave him hints (from Daedalus) on how to beat the 
beast. Of course, Theseus killed the Minotaur, got the girl and lived happily ever after (that is 
until his wife fell in love with his son, but that's another story). 

Sirius now offers you the chance to re-live this classic story in a modern setting. Take 
Theseus' place in the labyrinth and you will travel through 32 different three-dimensional 
mazes. Armed with a laser sword, you will encounter a myriad of fanciful and frightful 
creatures. In our version of the story, the Minotaur keeps company with Flying Snakes, 
Charon, Dragons, Ghosts, Spiders, Scorpions and other monsters too horrible to mention. 
You'll start out with 99 lives, find Wings to fly above the maze, a Virgin to grant you extra 
lives, an Elixir to drink which allows your spirit to roam free, a magical Skull, and a Club to 
bash through walls and floors.

APRIL 1982 




The moon was within reach. Rocketing from Russian soil to 
three hundred miles high in space, Sputnik orbited the earth 
first in 1957, causing wonder and a little bit of jealousy on the 
part of the United States. 

Firstest with the Mostest. In a technological fervor to catch 
up, some of the first American rockets were fired off with 
monkeys and chimpanzees in the driver's seat. The race in 
space was on, but the Russians held onto their lead, sending 



their first cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, into orbit in 1961. Alan B. 
Shepard, Jr., followed, barely a month behind, in the USA 
spacecraft Mercury-Redstone 3. which went up and came down 
without orbiting, reaching 115 miles at its apex and then drop- 
ping with a big splash in the Atlantic Ocean. 

Six months later, before Cape Canaveral had had a chance 
to cool down. Mercury- Atlas 6 carrying John Glenn sped Into 
orbit and circled the earth three times during a five-hour flight. 

Work stopped in American cities and towns. Children were 
let out of school. Strangers began talking to one another in the 
street. The United States was finally ahead of Russia. 

The Space Age brought its victories and its tragedies. Both 
nations lost men: The Apollo 1 cabin fire took the lives of astro- 
nauts Virgil "Gus" Grissom, Edward White, and Roger Chaf- 
fee in January 1967. Three months later a Russian spacecraft 
made a crash landing killing its pilot. Colonel Vladimir 
Komarov. 

But confidence in space exploration was not lost, and, final- 
ly, on July 16, 1969, at 4:19 p.m. Eastern Daylight Savings 
Time, Apollo 11 's Lunar Module landed in the Sea of 
Tranquility. 

Everybody everywhere was in front of a television set. As 
the hatch opened and Neil Armstrong put his foot on the dusty 
surface of the moon, back on earth at Mission Control usually 
dignified CBS newscaster Walter Cronkite shouted "WOW! ! ! " 
and people began to feel patriotic as they never had before. 

Succeeding missions brought land rovers and golf games to 
the moon, and, little by little, as it goes with human nature, the - 
excitement began to wear off. Today, most people take for 
granted the scientific and engineering skills required to put a 
person on the moon, and it may take the sophisticated Space- 
lab and the reusable space shuttle to recapture some of the 
thrill. 

Some NASA officials are cautiously predicting communi- 
ties in space within the decade. Rendering of civilian space ho- 
tels and metro transport between planets are no longer drawn 
from the imagination of H. G. Wells and Arthur C. Clarke but 
are taken from plans produced by space engineers at McDon- 
nell Douglas and other aerospace companies. 

Computers, of course, are playing a major role in the space 
program. Large mainframes were there from the beginning, 
and, during more recent years, microcomputers have begun 
appearing in various research laboratories and offices around 
NASA. But only one micro is scheduled to go into outer space. 

Although its flight is not scheduled till mid-1983, the Apple II 
Plus will be on board Spacelab when it makes its premiere voy- 
age in September of that year. Spacelab is a joint effort of 
NASA and the European Space Agency, and mission special- 
ists on the crew will be conducting more than thirty experi- 
ments in the biological, physical, and life sciences during its 
seven-day orbital flight. One of these research projects, called 
KEFLEX, will directly involve the Apple. 

Honeysuckle Knows. The HEFLEX experiment should an-

of Darwin: How do plants know which way is up?

can pass through to gxilde its growth. Yet, given enough water 
and oxygen, the roots of that seedling will push farther be- 
neath the soil and its sprouts will eventually break through to 
the surface. A plant knows which way is up. 

Plants grow up but not in a linear fashion. The roots, 
branches, tendrils, and other parts of most plants grow in a 
spiral pattern, somewhat like the rising stripes of a barber 
pole. This growth process, called circumnutation, was first 
scrutinized by Charles Darwin during the latter part of the 
nineteenth century. 

Darwin's theories about circumnutation are somewhat akin 
to his theory of evolution. In The Power of Movement in Plants, 
published in 1880, Darwin propounded that the phenomena of 
circumnutation is endogenously motivated — a driving force or 
a behavioral trait hidden within the plant makes it grow the 
way it does. 

The plant power theory seems only slightly less contro- 
versial than some of Darwin's other opinions. A number of 
scientists religiously adhere to an alternate view; the theory 
that plant growth is gravity-dependent, that gravity pulls the 
plant up and around in the corkscrew pattern. The differing 
opinions about the cause of nutation have caused a "friendly 
dispute" within the scientific community about the cause of 
nutation, the Darwinian-endogenists versus the gravity- 
dependents. 

About ten years ago, a gfroup of scientists on each side of the 
controversy decided that the matter could be resolved once 
and for all by conducting a plant growth experiment in a 
weightless, zero-gravity environment. One of two things could 
happen: nutation would either proceed as usual or the plant 
would forget which way is up. When the experiment's results 
were in, the scientists of one group would have to modify their 
thinking. 

A gravity-free laboratory can be simulated on earth, but 
scientists are not sure exactly how close this comes to the ac- 
tual environment in space. They suspect it's fairly imperfect. 

Along came the plans for Spacelab, which was designed for 
research projects requiring a zero-gravity atmosphere. Ex- 
periments conducted aboard Spacelab could conceivably start 
a long string of breakthroughs in medicine, physics, and biol- 
ogy, since scientists will have the opportunity to do research in 
an environment that's not restricted by the earth's gravita- 
tional forces. 

Flower Power. When the call came for proposals for scien- 
tific experiments that could be run aboard Spacelab, Dr. Allan 
Brown and his sunflowers were among the first to apply. 

Brown is a research biologist at the University of Pennsyl- 
vania and is on the gravitational side of the great plant growth 
debate. He's hoping for an answer with the experiment he calls 
KEFLEX, named after Helianthus annuus, the dwarf sun- 
flower which will be used as the test subject. 

In project KEFLEX (KELlanthus Flight Experiment) 
several simflower plants in various stages of growth will be 
videotaped in the weightless environment of Spacelab's orbit- 
al flight. When Spacelab returns to earth, still photographs will 
be made from the videotape and analyzed frame-by-frame by 
a group of biologists to determine what effect the zero-gravity 
had on the sunflowers. 

The live sunflower seedlings will be some of the last items 
loaded into Spacelab before it blasts off, and that's where 
Brown will have to bid his plants a temporary farewell. Since 
still very limited numbers of people can go along on an actual 
flight, Brown will be leaving Ws experiment in the hands of the 
three astronauts from NASA and the European Space Agency 
who are scheduled to fly with Spacelab in 1983. These crew 
members, who are referred to as "payload specialists" by 
NASA, will be handling each of the research projects on the or- 
bital flight, including the sunflower experiment. 

Sunflower Basics. The payload specialists have ah-eady un- 
dergone at least two in-depth training sessions at the Univer- 
sity of Pennsylvania in order to completely understand the me- 
chanics and biology of Project KEFLEX. 

"Plants really are interesting things," says Brown. "You'd 



be surprised." 

That was the first thing the astronauts learned; the proce- 
dures of the experiment came next. 

A population of Helianthus annuus seedlingps will be planted 
sequentially over a six-day interval. Since nutation becomes 
pronounced in seedlings 100 to 130 hours old, some of the plant 
specimens will be started before the launch so they'll be ready 
to go on camera by the first day of the flight. 

The sunflowers will arrive on Spacelab in a plant carry-on 
container, which looks something like a large suitcase. The 
older plants will go directly into a photographic chamber, while 
the younger seedlings will go into a centrifuge where they will 
spin in a one-gravity centripetal force, to simulate the gravity 
of earth. Payload specialists will plant the seedlings and add 
water to initiate germination. Each time a group of eight 
plants reaches the proper age, the payload specialist will se- 
lect the four best for camera surveillance. 

Choosing the plants will probably be the most difficult part 
for the payload specialists, especially since the Apple will be 
running the rest of the sunflower experiment. The Apple will 
take the role of a "dedicated microprocessor," responsible for 
regulating and monitoring centrifuge speed and temperature 
surrounding the seedlings and for controlling the photography 
that will take place at ten-minute intervals recording the nu- 
tating or nonnutating plants. The computer programming re- 
quired was contracted out to a private company in Pennsyl- 
vania, and the routine but time-consuming duties the Apple 
performs will free up time for the astronauts. 

But They Can't Play Snoggle. Astronaut flight time is pre- 
cious in terms of American dollars, and NASA wants to auto- 
mate whatever it can. Every minute counts. According to 
Brown, every human being aboard the upcoming flight has his 
time scheduled to within plus or minus six minutes. Thanks to 
the Apple, the payload specialists won't be tied up with routine 
tasks, which will enable them to go on to the other forty some- 
odd experiments aboard Spacelab or perhaps to steal a mo-

ment to enjoy the scene outside the viewing ports. 

The Apple II Plus selected for the 1983 flight looks slightly 
different from earthbound models since only the boards will be 
used. They have already been stored away at Johnson Space 
Center and are waiting for the countdown to go to work. 
Brown, however, still has a lot of work to do before then. A 
group of sunflowers just returned from the March space 
shuttle flight as part of a pre-HEFLEX engineering test to 
determine the optimal soil moisture for a zero-gravity 
environment. 

And even though Brown and his colleagues will be left be- 
hind when Spacelab finally takes off, they will be extremely 
busy at Mission Control monitoring the experiment from the 
ground. With all the botanists waiting for the results of the 
experiment. Brown wants to make sure nothing goes wrong. 

Because It's There. The HEFLEX experiment probably 
won't generate enough excitement or publicity to cause strang- 
ers to stop each other in the street and comment on "those 
amazing sunflowers," but Brown and his colleagues have been 
waiting a long time to solve this mystery. And what will its sig- 
nificance be beyond proving a point? Says Brown: 

"There's no immediate practical application. We're not 
doing this to see if we can grow sunflowers for the astronauts to 
eat in space. And we're not trying to change the price of sun- 
flowers on earth. 

"But it will give us one more new piece of information to 
work with as far as space research goes. Further experiments 
down the line could employ our results for an agricultural 
space application. Right now, it's just a basic research ques- 
tion." 

The sunflowers will share their quarters aboard Spacelab 
with about thirty-five other basic research projects, every- 
thing from an electron beam generator to blood sample 
studies. The beam generator will eject a stream of electrons 
from Spacelab that will charge the atmosphere around the or- 
biter and see if it perhaps creates an artificial aurora. In a se- 
ries of life science studies, the astronauts will draw fresh blood 
from each other's veins to measure the effects of weightless- 
ness on such factors as hemoglobin concentration. 

The value of space research cannot be disputed, especially 
when you look back at discoveries made during early space ex- 
ploration missions and their earthly applications. Fluorocar- 
bon propellants in spray cans were banned in this country af- 
ter Mariner 2 and Mariner 10 experiments showed scientists 
their danger to the protective ozone layer covering the earth. 

That may have prevented a future disaster. Meteorologfi- 
cal studies and Voyager photographs from the earth's upper 
atmosphere have also led scientists to a better understanding 
of global weather patterns, hurricanes, and solar energy. 

NASA astronaut Owen Garriott, who will be aboard Space- 
lab 1, points out that the space program has been a major im- 
petus in the development of computers. The microminia- 
turization of electronic circuitry was driven by the require- 
ments of spaceflight. And from the results of solid state cir- 
cuitry technology came the silicon chip, and hence the desktop 
computer. 

Where will it lead us? Garriott predicts there will be perma- 
nent space stations on the moon, probably within the decade, to 
which scientists will shuttle back and forth from the earth. 
Your local airport may soon become your local spaceport. 

Across the Universe. The sunflower experiment is only one 
small step in the entire Spacelab project which in turn is only a 
small part of the entire space exploration phenomenon. 

As long as NASA manages to wrestle money away from the 
national budget, space exploration will move on. No period in 
history has fostered so many discoveries since Magellan and 
Columbus and their colleagues set sail across wide unknown 
oceans just for the sake of exploration. And it shouldn't stop 
now. 

Most certainly there are planets to leave footprints on, pos- 
sible life to discover, galaxies to travel, and new civilizations to 
build. 

There are miles to go before we sleep. 3M

□ Higher Education. Clarke College, 
Graduate Division (Dubuque, lA 62001; 
319-688-6331) will this summer become 
one of the few institutions of higher learn- 
ing in the country to offer the Master of 
Arts degree for computer applications in 
education. Clarke, the first small college 
in the United States to offer a computer 
science program, added the computer 
applications concentration to its educa- 
tion major after concluding a study that 
Indicated teachers are generally unpre- 
pared to use computer technology in the 
classroom and would take the course. De- 
gree candidates will take nine to twelve 
hours of education courses, fifteen to 
eighteen hours of computer science 
courses, and three to six hours of elec- 
tives. The college's facilities include sev- 
enteen Apples and an IBM 4331 main- 
frame. 

□ Velodpedenal Interface. March 7, 1982, 
marked the Third Annual Old Road Ten 
Mile Time Trial of the North Hollywood 
Wheelmen, a California bicycle club that 
used to speed over the roacis of the Mali- 
bu Canyon area until the road conditions 
deteriorated to such a degree that the 
club went looking for a new course. They 
found it in Valencia, under the shadow of 
Six Flags Magic Mountain. 

It also marked the first Wheelmen 
race timed by the Apple, provided cour- 
tesy of club treasurer Steve Drucker. 
Drucker, a math teacher who got his Ap- 
ple in 1980 "to play games and keep track 
of gfrades," eventually hit upon the idea 
of combining his micro hobby with his 
other vocation, bicycle racing, to pro- 
vide on-site race results of the kind fur- 
nished to regional marathons by Race 
Central of Rialto, California ("Race 
Against the Apple," Softalk, November, 
1981). Drucker's system is not quite as 
elaborate; at this point it involves spot- 
ters along the course with stop watches, 
entering the 142 racers' starting and fin- 
ishing times on cards with their name, 
age, gender, and club affiliation; four 
bits of info per card. After the race, the 
cards were taken to Drucker and his 
waiting Apple at a nearby house and 
keyed in. The final results were pro- 
duced two hours after the finish, an im- 
provement over the manually tabulated 
results of all previous meets, which 
usually took three to four days of card 
shuffling to find out who finished when. 
(The special prize for fastest time went to 
John Stevenson, 21:43.) 

For future runnings of the Old Road 
trial, Drucker hopes to have the Apple in 
a van on the course site for even faster 
results. Though in his scorekeeplng ca- 



pacity Drucker is not as much an active 
participant as he once was, his enthusi- 
asm is undiminished. "You're riding as 
an individual against the clock; you can 
try for a personal best, but it's primarily 
a great event to see where your fitness 
level is." 

The Wheelmen, founded In 1946, have 
twenty-three national championships to 
their credit, plus two Pan-American gold 
medals and a world competition silver 
medal, and have participated on U.S. 
Olympic teams. 

□ A Smarter Card. A laminated plastic 
card with a memory chip, developed by a 
French subsidiary of Honeywell, is being 
tested by the Department of Agriculture 
as a possible replacement for food 
stamps. Known as an "intelligent" card, 
it would store the data on a household's 
monthly food allotment, which would be 
entered at the counter of a grocery store 
every time the card is used, and regis- 
tered at the local welfare office. The De- 
partment hopes the card may reduce the 
problems of fraud and waste in the 11.3 
billion dollar food stamp program. 

□ A Law of the Land. Pierce Brooks, the 
former Eugene, Oregon, police chief who 
was investigating detective in the "Onion 
Field" kidnap-murder case, is seeking a 
source of funding for the Violent Crimi- 
nal Apprehension Program, a national 
computer center that would link evi- 
dence in random motiveless slaylngs In 
an effort to prevent "serial murders," 
that proportion of homicides in the 
United States that are committed by one 
person or a group of persons who repeat 
the crime In different police jurisdic- 
tions. Data on cases Involving missing 
children with evidence of abduction, a 
disappearance with evidence of foul play, 
children who escape from kidnappers, 
and homicides that appear random and 
motiveless and include ritual aspects 
would be entered into a VI-CAP comput- 
er and analyzed for similarities. The pro- 
gram would then notify agencies of pat- 
terns In slajdngs and put police officials in 
different parts of the country in contact 
with each other in the hope of developing 
leads or suspects. All police agencies 
must cooperate for the program to be 
successful. 

□ Court Order. Charged with the No- 
vember 23, 1980 killing of Xavier Guillen, 
manager of a Cudahay, California apart- 
ment building, and the subsequent slay- 
ing of a fellow jail inmate, Michael Con- 
treras is being tried In Los Angeles Su- 
perior Court with the aid of a computer 
terminal. Contreras claims he cannot 
hear, read lips, or understand deaf sign

Testimony taken in shorthand form 
by the court reporter on an electronic 
stenographic machine is transferred to 
the computer terminal, which matches it 
to words in its vocabulary, using phonetic 
spelling for words it doesn't know. Ck)urt 
reporter Jere Shank programmed the 
system with sixty-eight thousand words 
at the beginning of the trial and has since 
added three hundred more, mostly street 
slang. Both Contreras and Judge Ricar- 
do Torres are able to read the testimony 
on separate terminals. 

The computer system was developed 
by Xscribe of San Diego, and includes the 
ability to print out a transcript.

Make Me a Match. What do a lock of 
George Washington's hair, John Wayne's 
yacht, and the 1928 Porter used In "My 
Mother the Car" have in common? 

These items and many others are 



catalogued in a computer marketplace 
for the ultrarich. Run by a company 
called The Investment Matchmaker, the 
service links buyers and sellers of real 
estate, classic cars, businesses, and the 
exotic. Investment Matchmaker was 
started five years ago, soon after com- 
pany president James Hall acquired his 
own computer. Now the company Is 
housed in a plush office, three blocks 
above the Sunset Strip, in Hollywood. 

The service caters to clients In the 
United States, Canada, and Mexico, with 
50 percent of its business coming from 
the entertainment communities In New 
York and Los Angeles. The company cur- 
rently has two thousand five hundred 
sellers and five thousand buyers In Its 
computer banks, and adds approximate- 
ly forty clients each week. 

At a cost of $400 to $1,000, Investment 
Matchmaker will provide the seller of 
goods with a computer printout of pros- 
pective buyers who are Interested In 
what's being offered. Buyers pay a $45 
fee for the service of being linked up with 
the goods. 

Items recently handled include a forty 
thousand-year-old mastodon tusk going 
for $30,000, and a conch belt worn by 
Elvis Presley being offered by his broth- 
er for $60,000. Twenty percent of Invest- 
ment Matchmaker's business involves 
items of this sort, while 80 percent of the 
information they provide covers real es- 
tate, classic cars, and businesses. 31

THE BASIC 



APRIL 1982 



Solution 

ByWm.Y R.Smith 



Many times, Basic Solution has of- 
fered routines that we hoped would help 
you produce efficient and eye-pleasing 
output. We've provided methods to posi- 
tion dollar values correctly and to han- 
dle most of the overhead involved in 
creating professional-looking output. 
Most of these routines from the past work 
with both the video screen and printed 
output. 

Now that the prices of dot matrix and 
letter quality printers are coming down 
from $600 and $1,300, more of you are 
likely to want to write programs that pro- 
duce printed material. 

If you are like most home program- 
mers, you begin the creation of paper re- 
ports on a trial-and-error basis. Once 
you've written the main program, you 
print out the first style of your report and 
then, slowly and laboriously, hand-mas- 
sage and edit it and each succeeding out- 
put until reams of paper are used up and 
you've achieved the report format you 
want. This method does get the job done, 
but it takes many hours and lots of paper 
to get the desired result. 

Some companies have attempted to 
produce paper grid patterns for pro- 
grammers to use. Their method has been 
to write in each grid square the appro- 
priate letter— the letter that should be 
printed in that space — thereby creating a 
handwritten X/Y grid format of what for- 
matted reports should look like for pro- 
gramming purposes. Using a handwrit- 
ten grid report is the best way for the pro- 
grammer to specify the appearance of 
output. 

The new, inexpensive printers have 
some very nice features, one of the best 
of which is the capability to go back and 
forth between expanded and condensed 
print. Taking advantage of this requires 
the programmer to find the proper grid 
format before beginning report specifi- 
cations. While most expanded and con- 
densed pitches are uniform from printer 
to printer, some are not, and these can 



make it very difficult to find the proper 
grid paper. 

This month's Basic program will take 
your printer and whatever format you 
specify and print out a grid format for 
you, using the exact character size for 
your printer grid. The program is rela- 
tively short and can be changed if you re- 
quire a shorter or taller grid. 

Good format can be very beneficial in 
producing all types of forms that include 
mailing labels, especially when you are 
not quite sure how many blank lines to 
print between labels or where to position 
the print head for the zip code or other 
special information. 

Programming efficiently is the key to 
secure and professional programs. Keep 
your eye on future Basic Solutions for 
new programs and concepts that will 
help you tackle the time obstacle in com- 
puter programming.

IT'S LIKE GEHING ^ 
ANOTHER APPLE 
FOR ONLY $150! . 




DOUDLETIME PRINTER (D.P.) is on extremely rhorough 
and exrensive package, which can easily pay for irself 
in a nnarrer of weeks in computer rime savings. 

Unril now, whenever rhe Apple wos ourpurring infor- 
morion ro a printer, ir was "our of commission" unril rhe 
prinring was done. Because mosr prinrers ore rarher 
slow, rhis con mean a loss of use of rhe compurer ronging 
5 ro 10 minures ro on hour or more. 

D.P. now liberores your Apple from being "prinrer- 
bound" by allowing rhe compurer ro essenrially do rwo 
rhings or once. Wirh D.P. insrolled you II be able ro 
continue using many programs in rhe "foreground" while 
rhe printer faithfully prints out the desired files in the 
"background". 

D.P. is more than just a simple interrupt driven utility 
though. Over a year of development has gone into 
producing a complete and integrated package with a 
wide voriet/ of functions and features. A few of these are: 



Prints BINARY, TEXT or APPLESOFT files with no con- 
versions necessary. All files ore printed directly from the 
diskette so very little internal computer memory is 
used, and there are no restrictions on number or 
size of the documents printed, other than your system's 
disk copocity. 

• Files con be FOFWIATTED when desired to include 
morgins, paging ond even variable number of copies. 

• Files con be prioritized so that other users can add 
their files to a diskette while printing is in progress. 
Urgent files con supercede earlier files placed on 
the disk. 

• DOUDLETIME PRINTER is supplied with a special F8 
P.OM (under special license from Apple Computer, 
Inc.) and on interrupt driver interface cord. Both ore 
simple to install by either end-user or dealer.

Buttonwood 
Apples 




When it comes to investment, any strategy that's profit- 
able is correct. Investment software packages reflect diverse 
methods for making money, each of which must have worked 
for someone sometime to have made its way to commercial 
software status. The methodology of choosing among strate- 
gies then becomes a matter of finding the one that most close- 
ly matches your convictions. 

Any strategy is not okay for designing software. In evaluat- 
ing investment software packages, we've concentrated on de- 
sign and execution. Each package reviewed in this column is 
put through its paces by several professional investors who are 
at home with computers — a modem-day Buttonwood associa- 
tion whose efforts are much appreciated. 

This month, Buttonwood Apples features the Dow Jones 
Market Analyzer, an outstanding package from RTR Soft- 
ware in conjunction with Dow Jones. 

Dow Jones Market Analyzer, by RTR Software, Inc. & Dow 
Jones & Company, (Box 300, Princeton, NJ 08540; 800-287-8114) 
$250. 

Vendor support: Excellent. 

Backup policy: Copyable with protection chip. 

Hardware compatibility: 48K RAM Apple II Plus with one 
disk drive, DOS 3.3; 48K RAM Apple II with a 16K RAM ex- 
pansion card and one disk drive, DOS 3.3; for use of the auto 
fetch feature : Hayes micromodem n or an acoustic coupler. 

First released in January, this package is a highly versa- 
tile technical analysis package. It consists of excellent docu- 
mentation, one copyable program disk, a Versa computing E- 
Z port, and a protection chip. 

The E-Z port is supplied with the package to make the in- 
stallation of the protection chip as convenient as possible. The 
chip is installed via the E-Z port into the game I/O socket on 
the Apple motherboard. The software is readily copyable with 
any standard DOS 3.3 copy program; thus, there is no prob- 
lem with producing back-up copies. 

The package is marketed in conjunction with Dow Jones & 
Company and uses the Dow Jones database for data retrieval. 
Manual entry of data is possible by obtaining price informa- 
tion from a newspaper or financial trade publication, and en- 
tering this information via the Apple keyboard. 

When the package is first run, the user must supply the lo- 
cal Dow Jones access numbers, password, number of drives, 
printer slot, type of modem (auto or manual) , and modem slot, 
entering them via the setup selection of the main menu. 

After these housekeeping chores have been taken care of, 
the user establishes the portfolio list on a data diskette. The 
package will begin the connection sequence for the Dow Jones 
database via either Telenet or Tymnet. The user is prompted 
for which network is desired. (A reminder — Dow Jones is ac- 
cessible through Telenet only during prime time hours; at 
other times. Tymnet must be used.) 

Once connection has been estabUshed by the package, it re- 
trieves twenty-four days' worth of price and volume informa- 



tion for each stock on the portfolio list. Twenty-four days is the 
minimum amount of data required by the system to perform 
many of its subsequent calculations and hl-res charting. Data 
will then be stored on what the documentation describes as an 
RTR data diskette. 

The package uses two types of data disks. One is the RTR 
data disk, which is used to hold historical price and volume 
data. Each RTR data disk may hold 104 stocks for up to 128 
time units, or 82 stocks for up to 286 time units. The other disk 
is a temporary work disk that holds current price and volume 
information imtil it is stored on the RTR data disk. You imple- 
ment the storage process with a conversion utility that's ac- 
cessible through the package's menu. 

Each RTR data disk and temporary work disk must con- 
tain files with like types of securities; bonds, options and 
equities may not be on the same data disks. 

When you are first establishing a stock list on an RTR data 
disk, the package will prompt you to supply certain informa- 
tion. The first request is for a three-letter tag. The first letter 
consists of the character required by the Dow Jones database 
to identify the type of security data to be retrieved, for exam- 
ple, (,) for stocks, (/) for corp>orate bonds, ( — ) for options, and 
(-I-) for mutual funds. The other two letters are up to you. You 
may wish to use this tag to denote a given portfolio or class of 
securities such as "ht" for high technology issues or "be" for 
blue chips. 

You are then prompted for the number of characteristics 
you wish to follow. A one Indicates that you are following only 
the closing prices. A two indicates that the closing prices and 
volume are to be used. A three indicates that high, low, and 
closing prices are being used, and a four indicates that the 
high, low, close, and volume are being used. If you choose to 
enter the data manually, the package affords you the option of 
entering data in either decimal form or In eights. Most of the 
major financial publications, including newspapers, publish 
stock price information in eighths. This facility eliminates the 
need for the investor to convert the Information before entry. 

You are then asked for the number of decimal places to be 
stored on the data disk. A handy chart in the documentation 
suggests the number of places required as determined by the 
price of the stocks you're tracking. The number of decimal 
places decreases as the price of the stock rises. This is be- 
cause the emphasis on fractional values decreases as the over- 
all stock price incretises. 

Integrated into the package is a full set of utilities for edit- 
ing, listing, updating, and alphabetizing data. The packages al- 
so allow you to adjust historical data for a stock split. 

When information is received via the Dow Jones database, 
the package will provide the user with an error table at the 
completion of the fetch cycle. The error table will show any 
possible errors in the data file due to transmission problems, 
unexpected data retrieved from the database (such as a day 
the stock was not trading) , or interruption of the fetch. The er- 



112 



APRIL 1982 



ror table will show at what point the interruption occvirred. If 
an interruption did occur, the investor will be required to log- 
on again to the database to complete the retrieval. 

When the data file has reached it's maximum size, the sys- 
tem will automatically begin dropping the oldest data first. If 
the investor wishes to retain this information, one of the edit- 
ing functions should be used. 

The major value of the Dow Jones Market Analyser lies in 
its charting capability. The purpose of the package is to make 
available in graphic form the results of the technical calcula- 
tions; this makes their interpretation and analysis easier. 

One section of the documentation is devoted to the interpre- 
tation of the graphic data created by the package. It Is an in- 
formative and useful section for both the neophtye and the sea- 
soned veteran. The documentation also lists suggested read- 
ings in the field of technical analysis. A succinct explanation of 
technical analysis Is provided in the first paragfraph of the in- 
terpretation section: 

Technical stock market analysis is btised on the premise that 
an indication of future stock prices can be obtained by studying 
past stock prices and trading volume. Price movement is the re- 
sult of the imbalance between supply and demand, which Itself 
reflects the expectations of the investing community. Technical 
analysis, then, is an attempt to recognize this imbalance and 
thereby improve market timing. To this end, the technical ana- 
lyst relies on data. He attempts to develop methods for identify- 
ing trading patterns reflected in that data. He attempts to de- 
velop methods for Identifying trading patterns which have, in 
the past, been associated with price movement. Such methods 
may be entirely visual or entirely calculational. 

The package performs two major classes of charting; indi- 
vidual and comparison. An individual chart is, as the name im- 
plies, a chart of one individual security. The hi-res screen is di- 
vided into two parts. The top two-thirds of the screen is used 
for charting prices and the bottom one-third for charting vol- 
ume data, displaying data, and performing certain types of 
analysis. 

For all charts, the horizontal axis represents time units. A 
time unit may be a day, week, month, or whatever time inter- 
val you choose. The vertical axis of the stock chart is used to 
represent price. At a given time unit, the corresponding high- 
low-close data is represented by a vertical bar extending from 
the low to the high with a tic-mark to the right of the bar signi- 
fying the closing price. 

When the stock chart first appears on the screen, the vol- 
ume chart at the bottom represents the relative magnitudes of 
the volume data collected. The process by which this calcula- 
tion is performed is explained in the documentation. An inves- 
tor who wishes to see the actual volume at a given time unit 
may do so by using one of the available commands. 

Below the volume chart is data pertaining to the stock being 
charted. The average daily volume, the stock symbol of the 
stock being charted, and the number of time units displayed, 
are presented in this section of the screen. 

To chart this information, all the Investor need do is 8p>ec- 
ify the security to be charted (by its ticker symbol) and the 
number of time units to be displayed. The system will then 
automatically retrieve the data file and display the chart and 
the information. Once the program has finished drawing the 
chart, the user will be in what is described as the "flashing 
caret mode." 

The flashing caret mode is the feature of the package that 
allows the investor to perform various computations and anal- 
yses. The most powerful features are available while in this 
mode. 

Moving Averages. There are three types of moving aver- 
ages: simple, weighted, and exponential. The Investor may 
specify the number of time units for each moving average. The 
Investor can modify any of these averages in order to con- 
struct trading bands (high, low, or close) , center the average, 



or shift the average. The results of the moving average calcu- 
lations are drawn onto the price chart in one of the five selec- 
table colors. 

Straight Line Constructions. The investor can plot a hori- 
zontal line at a specified price level, possibly to indicate a 
threshold or decision point. The investor can also plot a lineeur 
least-squares fit of the closing prices displayed on the screen. 

The package also allows the user to plot trend lines. The in- 
vestor will be asked to specify the two points that will establish 
the trend line. The line may be plotted using highs, Iowa, 
closes, or any point that lies within the vertical price bound- 
aries of the chart. 

The investor can plot a line parallel to the most recently 
plotted trend line. This feature may be used to indicate thresh- 
old or decision points. 

The package allows the investor to construct and plot 1/3 to 
1/2 speed resistance lines on the price screen. These lines are 
typically used to determine the level of secondary and tertiary 
support when an uptrend line is broken by the security or re- 
sistance when a downtrend line is broken. 

Change Scale. This feature allows the investor to extend the 
chart horizontally by adding blank time units into the future. 
The user can extend trend, least-squares, and parallel lines in- 
to the future for projections. 

The investor may also change the scaling on the horizontal 
axis. This allows replotting of the security with different time 
units. 

The vertical scale can also be changed to conform to pre- 
vious print-outs, so that they may be cut-and-pasted together, 
or to expand a given price section of the chart. 

Indicator Charts. These are line charts of values computed 
using the historical volume and price data of the particular 
stock. These values are plotted in place of the volume chart at 
the bottom of the screen so that the computed and actual price 
data can be compared. 

The six indicators available are: 

1. nvi: negative volume indicator — a curve that relates a 
drop in volume to the corresponding change in closing prices 

2. pvi: positive volume indicator — relates a rise in volume 
with the change in the closing prices 

3. cvi: cumulative volume indicator — a commonly used 
tool to maintain a running total of excess up volume over down 
volume over time 

4. vol: volume line chart — exhibits volume density 

5. pvt: price volume trend — adjusts the cumulative volume 
by adding or subtracting a percentage of each successive day's 
volume. The percentage is determined by the price change for 
the day, which may be plus or minus 

6. dvi : daily volume Indicator— the indicator is adjtisted de- 
pending on where the closing price is relative to that day's 
trading range 

The investor can also superimpose a moving average on 
one of these indicator charts or can input formulas into the 
package with the user jump routine facility. This feature is 
clearly explained in the documentation. 

All the formulas that are used by the package are enu- 
merated in a section of the documentation that gives the inves- 
tor the opportunity to examine not only the charts, but the 
formulas that generate them. 

The Dow Jones Market Analyzer is unquestionably the 
most cost efficient technical analysis package available for the 
Apple today. Considering its price, performance, and flexibil- 
ity, it is a technical analysis tool no investor who uses such 
techniques should be without.

Track Attack. By Chris Jochumson. There was this neat little 
slot-car setup on the market about fifteen years ago called the 
Getaway Chase Game that featured a thirties gangster-type 
black sedan and a police car — much bigger than normal slot 
cars — tearing around a scale cardboard set of Chicago until 
they smashed into each other. (There may have been more to 
it than that; at any rate, it was a heck of a lot of fun.) 

Upon this basic premise — surely the best Milton Bradley 
ever came up with, not counting Water Wiggle — ^the folks at 
Broderbund have rung some interesting changes. While the 
primal pleasure of seeing large black plastic chassis flying in 
all directions is necessarily absent from Track Attack, it does 
have many charms all its own and appeal for the model rail- 
roader as well. 

In the setting of a tortuously laid out railroad switching 
yard, you, the driver of a hopped-up '86 Pierce- Apple, must en- 
deavor to intersect with a heavily laden gold train at various 
rail crossings, relieving a boxcar of its payload by the cunning 
expedient of crashing through it. The trick is to avoid crashing 
into the engine, an empty boxcar, or the yard guard's '52 De 
Soto that relentlessly patrols the grounds, stealing back your 
hard-stolen gold and generally making life tough. 

The ornate and semiabstract layout of the yard is be- 
wildering, though you soon learn where the best crossings are 
to make your raids. The controls may drive you to despair, as 
you must signal a turn somewhat in advance of an intersection 
or you keep right on going, and you have no brakes and no re- 
verse gear. Once you learn that you must make three ninety- 
degree turns to go back the way you came, things become 
easier. But not much. Recommended that you select the I, J, 
K, M control diamond on the keyboard rather than the A, 
Z/right and left arrow configuration, which the mind more 
readily transposes in the heat of the moment. 

The faster you can get the gold out of the train and back to 
your storage area, the more it is worth, as the price declines a 
dollar a second. Intercepting the guard car after it has re- 
trieved a portion of your ill-gotten gains and before it can rede- 
posit them at the train supply depot rates extra points for guts 
and spares you a hundred-point penalty. Here you're apt to 
find that the one time you want to run into this implacable lit- 
tle creep, he's suddenly shy. 

At the second level, which you may ascend to any time you 
feel ready, you leap from boxcar to boxcar (a very nicely ani- 
mated sequence) until you reach the cab, and take over the 
train. If you make it — and you may not — you are now the train, 
picking up gold deposits on the tracks and still avoiding the in- 
evitable '52 De Soto. Here you are provided a free graphic 
demonstration of the political philosophy which states that 
radical ideas threaten institutions until they are eventually ac- 
cepted, thus becoming institutions, which are threatened in 
turn by radical ideas. You, the former outlaw. Join the estab- 
lishment, your greed unabated; but the guard, the train's for- 
mer ally, remains your eternal foe, the moral conscience of the 
game, unchanged by the shift in power and the vicissitudes of 
commerce. Some compensation for not getting to watch the 
big plastic cars fly across the living room.

Tax Beater. By Jack and Carol Lennard. The authors, tax pro- 



fessionals, looked at the other tax preparation packages and 
saw that the software didn't insulate the user from mistakes, 
such as overclaiming deductions in areas where the IRS has 
posted limits. 

Their solution was to provide a tax package that asks for 
minimal data; then adjusts deductions to conform to regula- 
tions. Finally, they calculate the tax umpteen ways to deter- 
mine which method is best for the taxpayer. 

Tax Beater is the easiest tax software to use, but the end re- 
sult lacks the documentation capabilities of competitive pack- 
ages. If you plan to be audited, this one may not be for you. But 
for the taxpayer who only wants reliable numbers in the most 
painless fashion possible — if painless is a word that can be ap- 
plied to taxpajing— then Tax Beater scores high. 

An interesting added attraction is the program's ability to 
assess your Schedule A from the IRS's viewpoint. The pro- 
gram will tell you whether your deductions are high, low, or 
average for your income. A nifty touch. 

First versions sometimes calculated FICA rebates inaccu- 
rately, but few got into the hands of the public before Data- 
Most made the correction. ART 
Tax Beater, by Jack and Carol Lennard, DataMost (19273 Keyne 
Street, Northridge, CA 91326; 213-366-7160). $129.95. 
Tax Manager. By TASO. Micro Lab's new entry into the in- 
come tax preparation market takes a different approach. As 
you fill in the data, various schedules are created that provide 
the user with documentation. 

Guidelines on the reverse of the two-sided disk are helpful 
in understanding what the Internal Revenue Service will and 
won't allow, but the user will still need to refer to various IRS 
bulletins for caveats on those allowances. For instance, politi- 
cal contributions are deductible, but only to $100; this pro- 
gram won't prevent the user from overclaiming in ignorance. 

Tax Manager takes Micro Lab's usual approach to data en- 
try, modularizing the data and saving each module. That can 
make for lots of disk access time, but the completely docu- 
mented results make the extra time worthwhile. 

An added fillip is a series of questions on the flip side. The 
Apple translates the user's answers into instructions about 
which forms will be required. Done before the rest of the pro- 
gram is run, this module provides excellent methodology for 
proceeding; and methodology is half the battle in doing taxes. 

The initial copies of Tax Manager had a problem with data- 
handling in the single disk drive format, but these have been 
rectified. Users with those first copies can get a free update 
from their dealer. ART

Star Blazer. By Tony Suzuki. Not the latest in cosmic sports 
jackets. Star Blazer is the arcade game that really proves that 
less is more. No prolonged explosions here; no screaming 
dives, warning klaxons, or roaring holes in the fabric of space 
and time. Just you and your "vintage World War HI" fighter- 
bomber, whispering over a sparse, niral, vaguely Indo-Chi- 
nese landscape. 

To call it a five-level Pegasus II would not do it justice, how- 
ever. It wouldn't describe the bombs that miss the tank, 
bounce off the cactus, spin end over end, and plop into the 
sand ; nor would it mention the fragment of your fuselage that 
arcs lazily to earth, trailing pixels of smoke, after you inter- 
face with an oil rig. Or maneuvering under the spare fuel tank 
parachuted down to you by your supply plane, seeing the para- 
chute lines cut by a flying neon tetra, and having to catch the 
tank in mid-fall. Or playing cat-and-mouse with the sky mines

and the lumbering transports that drop them ; a threat in them- 
selves because they are slower than you. 

The ingenuity required to skrag the supersonic tanli on 
level two is a thing of beauty and a joy forever. (On level four, 
though, the ingenuity required to zap the tank, and avoid the 
heat-seeking missiles that turn around and come after you, and 
stay out of the way of the swarming tetras, and try to snag 
your fuel drop, is something else again. Good luck.) There is a 
strategy for every level; a technique; a style. Lots of style. In 
saturation bombing, the bombs detonate in rh3^hmical pat- 
terns. After your last jet is downed or destroyed, play will con- 
tinue just long enough to give you the sight and sound of your 
last fuel pack drifting to earth with no one left to receive it. It 
impacts grittily in the dirt, kicking up a little spray of sand. 
Game over. Sheer poetry. 

It is this fearsome attention to detail that makes all the dif- 
ference. If you miss your fuel drop and it lands on a target it 
will, of course, explode — forty points. (Hi-octane fuel, don't you 
know.) If you attempt to bomb a target nestled tinder a tree 
and your bomb catches in the overhanging branches (minus 
forty points), it sounds like a bomb getting caught in a tree. 

None of the effects slow down the action or get in the way, 
and no comers are cut. Nuances you won't notice until your 
fifth time through, if then, are given full expression. Though 
other games in the same category have the same or greater 
difficulty. Star Blazer even makes the frustration a pleasure. If 
you're not cutting it, you know that you must simply fig^e out 
a better way, that it is possible, and that you will be re- 
warded. A(

Zero Gravity Pinball. By Don Fudge. There aren't many pin- 
ball games like this one. It takes three hands and the wisdom of 
Zeus to keep ahead of the many variables that make this game 
much more than flipping balls against bumpers. 

Zero Gravity Pinball comes with detailed and humorous in- 
structions included in the program. The game area is a square 
with dotted lines on the left and right sides and five flippers just 
inside each dotted line. The top and the bottom of the square 
have sizable openingps with dotted lines. Needless to say, if the 
ball goes through any of the dotted lines you lose it. 

Hitting the space bar for the bottom and any other key for 
the top activates force fields that keep the ball from escaping. 
The ten flippers keep the ball from escaping on the sides. Each 
of the flippers and each of the force fields is ineffective unless 
the ball is close to it. 

Sound complicated? It gets worse. 

Only one of the ten flippers works at a time. If it's red, it 
works; if a flipper is green, the ball will go right through it. 
You make a flipper work by turning the knob of the game pad- 
dle until the flipper turns red. (On a black and white monitor, a 
working flipper has a black dot on it.) But if you turn the knob 
too much it might give you a bogus flipper that is red but use- 
less. Turning the knob some more either fixes this or results in 
a superbogus flipper that is red but useless. Turning the knob 
some more either fixes this or results in a superbogus flipper 
that is there and not there. 

Ckjping with all this at first is like trying to shave a lion's 
beard. You get killed so fast you barely know what happened. 
It is important not to drop the paddle when stabbing frantical- 
ly for the space bar. At the lower levels the ball is moving rela- 
tively slowly and you have some time to react. At the higher 
levels the ball moves much faster and only the most confident 
and skilled players can survive. 

One last aggravating feature will plague expert and novice 
alike. The center hole acts like a bumper usually, but every so 
often it turns into like a black hole and swallows the ball. There 
isn't a whole lot you can do about it. 

Fudge's animation is consistently first-rate and the color 
graphics spice things up. Like any good pinball game, Fudge's 
version offers you the challenge of controlling the ball, but it 
takes longer to master this here than in conventional two or 
four flipper games. 



Emerging as a dark horse in the computer pinball sweep- 
stakes. Zero Gravity Pinball is certainly original and for this 
reason alone deserves to do well. The fact that it is a dam good 
game will not go unnoticed. DH

MatheMagic. By Joseph R. Luciano. Remember when you 
first brought your Apple home from the store? In addition to 
the standard Apple-provided disks, you probably bought a 
couple of games or disks of contributed programs. 

Late in the evening, when the first blush of the games had 
worn off, it was time to demonstrate your mastery of this thing 
by commanding It to do your bidding and seeing it respond. 

Recalling that computers are most valued for their num- 
ber-crunching abilities, you might have decided on a very 
modest project: make the Apple add one plus one. 

Here is when you found that making a personal computer a 
personal tool was not as trivial as the store salesman indi- 
cated, because when you typed "1+1," the computer ignored 
you and returned the flashing cursor. 

A tad of perseverance enabled most new users to discover 
that the proper method was to enter "PRINT l-Hl" and return. 
The Apple would then retum "2." 

But handling numbers with some facility and efficiency re- 
quired understanding some fundamental programming tech- 
niques and grasping the concept of precedence, that method of 
calculation used by the Apple to arrive at an answer. 

Persuading the Apple to cope with calculations is neither 
the most arcane nor the most trivial of progp-amming tasks. 
Regardless of the ultimate difficulty factor, however, the new 
user is most likely to be disappointed when he first finds that 
his $2,000 personal computer won't even cope with 1+1. 

Now comes Intemational Software Marketing to the res- 
cue with a program called MatheMagic. The program was 
originally billed as turning your Apple into a programmable 
calculator. That's as understated as billing the space shuttle as 
a means of long-distance travel. 

While MatheMagic definitely does tum your computer Into 
a programmable calculator, it's a programmable calculator 
the likes of which Texas Instruments or Hewlett-Packard has 
never developed. 

It allows you to design formulas and apply labels to the 
formulas by which to recall them from disk. These labels can 
then be used within other formulas to call the original formu- 
la. The capability of the program is indicated by the fact that 
the user can nest formulas six deep before the program will 
sigh in weariness. 

The real pleasure of working with MatheMagic is that it's 
overcome the limitations found in so many microcomputer 
software products. Most micro software will do exactly what 
the author designed them to do and not a whit more. 

To folks who cut their computer teeth on a micro, that 
seems like a realistic limitation. But the fact is that software 
developed for bigger systems will often have capabilities be- 
yond what their authors have conceived by virtue of the large 
amounts of code produced. 

The result Is that the Innovative user can often coax from a 
progp'am results that surprise the authors — much as authors 
are presently coaxing from their Apples capabilities Steve 
Jobs and Steve Wozniak didn't dream of when they were tin- 
kering in that Infamous Silicon Gulch garage. 

Using the program with two disk drives is a dream, unfor- 
tunately the same cannot yet be said for using It with one drive. 
ISM discovered a serious bug in the one-drive version of 1.5A 
and are presently modifying the progfram to make the appro- 
priate fixes. 

The company has pledged to replace all 1.5A versions pur- 
chased by single-drive users upon receipt of the warranty 
card. However, the wise one-drive buyer will await version 
1.5B before seriously considering the product. 

Certain of the author's choices, particularly as they pertain 
to one-drive use, don't sit well with experienced users. On the 
other hand, those choices do not dim the achievement of plac-

Pascal Utility Package 1. By Al Weiner. The Apple Pascal 
operating system has a number of advantages over Apple 
DOS. Many experienced Apple Basic programmers are inter- 
ested in making the switch to Pascal but are held back by the 
complete incompatibility of the two operating systems. DOS 
and Apple Pascal record data in very different formats on 
disk. This means that all the text files and data files laborious- 
ly developed through the use of programs employing DOS 
commands are inaccessible to Pascal programs. The Basic 
programmer may be willing to recode programs into Pascal, 
but to require that all that data (or text) then be re-entered is 
simply asking too much! 

Gryphon Microproducts offers a solution to the problem of 
moving DOS files to Pascal disk in the first of a series of Pascal 
utility packages, the Pascal Utility Package 1. One of the utili- 
ties provided in this package permits Basic users to transfer 
DOS files to Pascal-formatted disk. 

The Pascal Utility Package (PUPl) offers a number of 
distinct facilities, of which DOS-to- Apple Pascal file transfer is 
only the most important. Other features are cataloguing of 
Pascal and Basic disk, a printout program for Pascal pro- 
gram files, a configuration program that integrates the user's 
printer and Mountain Computer Clock into the software sys- 
tem, if they are present, and an automatic startup program 
that sets the system date by reading the calendar clock. 

The PUPl documentation directs the user to transfer a sys- 
tem startup program and an exec file from PUPl : to the user's 
boot disk. In order to take advantage of the automatic clock ac- 
cessing feature and the printer configuration features, the user 
must execute a one-time configuration option in the PUPl pro- 
gram. This program asks the user whether a Mountain Com- 
puter clock is installed, whether the system has a printer, and, 
if so, what the characteristics of the printer are. (One question 
here is a bit tricky. When asked how many lines the printer 
prints on a page, be sure to specify the actual number of lines 
that should be printed on the page — perhaps sixty — ^rather than 
the number of lines that could fit on the page — sixty-six for 
most printers using forms of standard 11-inch length.) Users 
who do not have the clock card or who have a non-standard 
printer may choose not to take advantage of the automatic 
startup features, which add a number of seconds to the normal 
reboot time. They can do this simply by not transferring the 
two special startup files to their boot disk. All the other fea- 
tures of the PUPl utility can be used simply by x (executing the 
PUPl program and choosing the desired utility from the 
screen menu. 

Once the startup files have been transferred and the con- 
figuration option has been executed, subsequent boots of the 
system cause an execution of an automatic soft configuration 
program. This is a convenient way to boot for the first time 
every day, since it sets the system date used by disk filing op- 
erations. Users with Mountain Computer clock cards will ap- 
preciate the automatic access of the clock to find the system 
date. (Those without the clock are prompted to type in the 
date.) The automatic startup feature also soft-configures the 
system for the characteristics of the user's printer. This is par- 
ticularly convenient for use with printers that provide an auto- 
matic line feed upon receipt of an ASCII carriage return sym- 
bol. The Apple Pascal system ordinarily adds a line feed to 
each carriage return sent to the printer itself, but the PUPl 
configuration program can disable this automatic line feed for 
systems with such printers. 

The formatting print utility provided is appropriate for Pas- 
cal program source files. Unlike the formatting printer pro- 
grams discussed in "There's a Powerful Word Processor Hid- 
ing in Your Pascal Apple" (Softalk, February 1982) , it does not 
provide special features for word processing, such as an un- 



derlining capability. It does provide several other useful fea- 
tures, however. It automatically posts date and time in a page 
header in the formatted printout. This time and date come 
from the clock if one is installed. Users who do not have the 
clock can still use the automatic time-and-date posting feature 
by using the Pascal Editor to create a simple text file called 
DATE. TEXT on the boot volume. This file will then be used as 
the source for the time and date data by the printout program. 
The user also has the option of adding another header line to 
each page of the printout at the time the utility is used. An un- 
usual feature among Pascal printout programs ; the output is 
echoed to the system console, permitting the user to monitor 
the printout without walking over to the printer. 

The most powerful utility provided in PUPl is the DOS-to- 
Pascal file transfer feature. Text files, binary files, and Apple- 
soft program files can all be transferred directly. When an Ap- 
plesoft progn*am is transferred, the Basic language tokens are 
automatically expanded into their normal full text expression 
in the Pascal volume source file. This utility does not translate 
progn'ams from Basic to Pascal. Rather, it transfers files from 
DOS-formatted disk to ordinarily incompatible Pascal-for- 
matted disk. 

In addition to programmers, other users are likely to find a 
wealth of applications for this utility. For example, the owner 
of a commercial communications package written in Apple 
Pascal might prefer to create text files using a DOS-based 
word processing program. These files could later be trans- 
ferred to a Pascal disk via PUPl for eventual telephone trans- 
mission using the Pascal communications software. 

The documentation consists of a modest 24-page booklet 
that adequately introduces the features of the PUPl utility 
package. Further documentation, including notes on the im- 
provements provided by the current software update. Is given 
in a number of text files with the .HELP suffix. These can be 
printed out using the formatted print utility or they can be read 
from the screen by using a help option in the PUPl program.

Computer Foosball. By Keithen. Foosball is the latest game to 
be interpreted for the Apple, following in the footsteps of com- 
puterized versions of baseball, football, pool, and pinball. In its 
original form, foosball is a game of fast action and skill. 

Wrist and eye coordination made foosball a challengfing 
parlor game. Translated into electronic media, Computer 
Foosball is fast and tough— a terrific two- player game. Get 
yourself a good set of paddles and an opponent whose feelingfs 
you can't hurt. 

It's the Gruds against the robots. The screen displays the 
micro playing field with the two teams occupying their spe- 
cific places. Each side has eleven players in four columns 
evenly spaced apart. The center column of each team com- 
prises five players and the goals are defended by three player 
configurations. Offensive maneuvers are accomplished with a 
column of three players. Each player on the two teams is ca- 
pable of kicking the ball forward and backward. 

All the players on a side move at the same time up and 
down when you twist the knob of the game paddle. Pushing the 
button causes the players to kick. The object of the game is ball 
control and scoring goals. The electronic soccer ball, if you 
will, is very well animated, displaying English manners and 
other pool ball characteristics. 

The solitaire version pits the human as Gruds against the 
computer as robots. There are two speeds, fast and normal; 
even at normal speed the computer is a pretty tough opponent. 
Old-time foosball champions beware. The computer will make 
you look like an ape. Frequently, scoring shots are deflected 
off the back of your own defending player into the goal. 

Pong-like bouncing of the ball off walls and other players is

tile major sliill required to win at Computer Foosball. Even so, 
sometimes the ball moves so fast that it takes a great deal of 
luclt to have things go your way. Many hours of playing will 
surely result in more skill and less luck, but there is a limit to 
your ability to react fast enough. 

The two-player version will be a hit at rowdy parties. When 
two evenly matched opponents face off, it can get pretty excit- 
ing. The first person to reach five goals, or more in the case of 
a tie, walks off the victor. 

Computer Foosball allows up to four players with paddles, 
two on each side. Four people swearing is just as invigorating 
as two people swearing. 

Every so often the ball gets stuck in a comer or stuck 
bouncing between walls ; if you do a control-B the ball is served 
again. After each game the computer plays a short version of 
"The Stars and Stripes Forever"; the loser has the option of 
using control-S and not receiving insult on top of injury. DH

The Amdek Digital Video Multiplexor (DVM) is a compli- 
cated circuit that allows an Apple II to output its text, hl-res 
and lo-res graphics on an Amdek Video II red/green/blue 
(RGB) display monitor. 

Most video monitors that display color draw the pictures 
you see by aiming three electron guns at the picture tube. The 
electrons shot from these guns are aimed at small spots on the 
picture tube — those little dots of color you see when you look at 
a television picture close-up through a magnlf jring glass. Each 
electron gun lights up a specific color in dots; one red, one 
green, and one blue. You may have toyed with colored lights in 
grade school and found that when these colors are mixed, you 
can create all the colors of the rainbow just by var3ring which 
ones you mix and by varying the intensity of the lights ; you get 
white by mixing red, green, and blue together in equal intensi- 
ties. 

Your television set or composite video monitor takes one 
signal, the picture signal (called "composite video"), and de- 
codes the picture into the proper red, green, and blue signals 
for each of the electron guns. The g^ns then fire their elec- 
trons across to the picture tube, illuminating the small dots of 
color that, when viewed as a whole, compose the image repre- 
sented in the composite video signal. 

If you haven't guessed yet, an RGB monitor requires more 
than one input. In the case of the Amdek Color II, five sigfnals 
are required: a red signal, a blue signal, a green sigfnal, a hori- 
zontal synchronization signal, and a vertical synchronization 
signal. The color signals convey the pictorial information, and 
the synchronization signals convey information that keeps the 
picture stable on the screen. 

Why build an RGB monitor when its function seems simi- 
lar to that of a television set? The answer is resolution. Resolu- 
tion is a quality that describes detail, or clarity, particularly in 
the context of pictures or images. 

Think of resolution this way : when you look at a newspaper 
photo under a magnifying glass, you can see that the picture is 
made up of little blobs of ink. The smaller these blobs are, the 
more detail the picture has, and consequently the greater the 
resolution. An Apple II has a lo-res graphics mode of 40 spots 
across by 48 up-and-down and a hi-res graphics mode of 280 
across by 192 up-and-down. 

In lo-res an Apple II can display sixteen colors, whereas in 
hi-res it can display only six colors. This trade-off isn't specific 
to the Apple ; many computer graphics circuits lose choice of ^ 
colors as the resolution of the picture increases. ( 

The Amdek Color II offers much higher resolution than a 
television set or composite video monitor is capable of; and a 
special bonus is added by having separate red, green, and blue 
inputs — color-on-color drawing is made possible! The cltirity 
with which the Amdek Color II draws pictures is quite striking 
in comparison to the Amdek Color I, and, of course, much 
clearer than a television set can handle. With the appropriate 
circuitry, a character or line can be drawn in any color and su- 
perimposed over a background of any other color. Unfortu- C 
nately, the DVM board doesn't have this capability. 



APRIL 1982

A benefit of the DVM circuit is that it can adapt the output 
of 80-column display boards (the instructions included de- 
scribe how to adapt a Videx Videoterm-80 to the DVM) . You 
can view 80-column outpout on a Color II, whereas the same 
picture would be quite poor on a Color I. 

In addition to the 80-column capability, you can type in in- 
structions to turn on or off the RGB electron guns separately. 
In so doing, white pictures (either graphics or text) with the 
red and blue g^s shut off appear green. There are eight basic 
colors possible with an RGB monitor: 

Colors Turned On Resultant Color 

None Black 

Blue Blue 

Green Green 

Blue and Green Cyan 

Red Red 

Red and Blue Magenta 

Red and Green Yellow 

Red and Green and Blue White 
In fact, only these eight color combinations are possible 
with the Amdek Color II and the DVM board. An inexpensive 
modification to the Amdek Color II will give it an additional in- 
put, "Intensity," which gives the set of basic colors an addi- 
tional eight colors to choose from. 

Nor was there advantageous use made of the color-on-color 
capabilities of the Color II; a green line drawn over a blue 
background still has the color fringing "zebra stripe" effect it 
always had on the Apple II. Also, colors on the RGB monitor 
appear as vertical bars of color, whereas they appear as solid 
on a composite video monitor or television set. 

Some games — Space Eggs, for example — played on the Ap- 
ple II with the DVM board, turn out well. The graphics are 
very clear and brightly colorful; space ships and alien critters 
take on a whole new personality. However, Bug Attack and 
many of the hi-res adventures didn't improve ; in fact, you may 
prefer them on a television. I suspect that game authors are 
going to stick to the television set-oriented graphics, and not 
write games that look flattering on an RGB monitor. 

All in all, the Amdek DVM board did its job — converting the 
Apple Text and graphics into an RGB signal for the Color II 
monitor, but the end result may not be worth the overall price 
to you. The DVM board is priced at or over $200, and RGB 
monitors like the Color II are nearly $1000. Rk

Hi-Res Secrets. By Don Fudge. Hi-Res Secrets is a complete 
graphics tutorial for the Apple. The package comes with four 
disks and about two hundred sixty pages of documentation in a 
looseleaf binder. It covers all hi-res graphcis subjects except 
three-dimensional animation. Sound and tone routines are also 
fully explained. A working knowledge of Basic and a simple 
background in assembly language are assumed. 

The main focus of the package is on drawing and animat- 
ing different types of shapes. Three tjrpes of shapes are ex- 
plained: vector shapes, which are the type in the Applesoft 
manual; block shapes, which are used for extremely fast ani- 
mation in arcade-type games; and hplot shapes, which are 
used for outlines of objects and do not animate quite as well. 

Several types of animation are discussed for each type of 
shape. The main types of animation are simple (both one and 
two page) , shift (ROR and ROL) , and TABLE (much faster 
than most other types of animation) . Routines are included to 
convert one type of shape to another and to create animation 
sequences. 

Animation sequences are used when you animate an object 
such as a man where the arms and legfs move independently of 
the motion of the man. There are demos and utilities on the 
disks for each type of shape and animation. LISA-compatlble 
source files are supplied for almost every routine, and many of 
the machine language routines are explained step-by-step In 
the documentation. 

Several other important concepts are covered in the man- 
ual that relate to animation. These include the Applesoft colli- 
sion counter, the advantages and disadvantages of draw and 



xdraw, and the use of screen flipping. 

Animation and shape drawing comprise only about half the 
package. There are also programs and explanations that cover 
560-dot resolution, show how to draw circles, ellipses, and other 
geometric figures, and show how to make all the white lines in 
a picture look thicker and whiter. 

A substantial part of one disk is devoted to various sound 
routines. There is a program to write music where pressing 
different keys will play different notes. It also allows the user 
to store the notes on disk and play them back. A short game is 
included that demonstrates some of the many sounds that can 
be produced by noise routines. Of course, source files are in- 
cluded for the sound routines. 

The fourth disk deals with the use of color on the entire hi- 
res screen. The palette program allows the user to fill the 
screen with almost any color — there are twenty-one basic col- 
ors with many potential mixtures. 

The color filter allows you to filter out any color or comple- 
ment the entire screen. For instance, if the screen is white, fil- 
tering out violet would result in a green screen. Complement- 
ing the screen would change it to violet. From there, setting the 
high bit would result in blue. By using the palette and then the 
filter, some very interesting pictures can be designed. 

The documentation for Hi-Res Secrets is quite comprehen- 
sive. Occasionally, It is confusing when the author refers to 
"Program 7 of disk 28B," instead of naming the actual pro- 
gram, otherwise, it is excellent. Again, the user is expected to 
know Basic and some assembly language. If you have been fol- 
lowing Roger Wagner's Assembly Lines, then you are well pre- 
pared. 

If you are interested in graphics programming and dream 
of writing progframs like Raster Blaster or Sneakers, then Hi- 
Res Secrets is probably a good starting point. If you are Just in- 
terested in how hi-res works, this tutorial is a great place to 
learn.

Mind Your 




BY PETER OLIVIERI 




Well, spring is rapidly approaching, and, while this may not 
have much significance to those of you who've been enjoying 
relatively continuous warm weather, it certainly means a lot to 
those of us who've been suffering the winter blues. 

Let's begin this month by profiling a business user. Much 
can be learned from what other people are doing. Not only is 
this a way to get useful information about the hardware and 
software other users are pleased or displeased with, it also has 
the potential for sparking a new idea or application that might 
prove useful to you in your own business. 

Business User Profile. Computers and photography may 
seem at first like unlikely mates. On further reflection, the re- 
lationship between these two areas begins to develop (an aw- 
ful pun!) more clearly. One business user who has linked com- 
puters and photography in a creative way is Greg Adams, a 
certified professional photographer whose company is the 
Adams Home of Professional Photogfraphy in Morgantown, 
West Virginia. 

When Adams first considered acquiring a computer, he in- 
tended to use it to address the bookkeeping function of his busi- 
ness. It soon became apparent, however, that the Apple could 
do much more than just bookkeeping. It could format and print 
letters, sort and prepare mailing labels, monitor the checking 
account, and categorize expenses. 

One of the greatest services the Apple supplies to the or- 
ganization is the ability to provide a quality, personalized letter 
to every customer who inquires about what services are 
provided. 

The eqiiipment chosen for these tasks includes an Apple II 
Plus system with 64K, two floppy disk drives, a monitor, and a 
one thousand word per minute printer. The software currently 
being used includes Muse's Supertext II word processing pack- 
age and a bookkeeping package from BPI. The total cost of 
this particular system (hardware and software) was a bit un- 
der six thousand dollars. 

Adams's company uses the word processing program to 
send out letters to prospective clients, to send follow-up letters 
during sales promotions, and to send reminder letters to all 
overdue accounts. 

The firm uses three software packages for handling mail- 
ing lists and labels: ApplePost (Apple Computer), Address 
Book (Muse), and Mailing List Database (Synergfistic Soft- 
ware) . The last of these packages is the one the company uses 
most. 

With this system, Adams can maintain an updated mailing 
list at all times and can sort the list by name, address, tele- 
phone number, state, zip code, a special code of his choice, or 
by any combination of these elements. What he now does 
quickly and easily used to take several weeks. New promo- 
tions have also become easier to initiate. He keeps a list of an- 
niversaries and birthdays and, shortly before these special 
dates, sends out promotional letters to suggest portrait as a 
nice gift or personal remembrance. 

The BPI bookkeeping system has allowed the firm to keep 
much better track of what bills are outstanding and for how 
long. Sales are broken out into categories at the end of each 
month and summarized at the end of the year. All in all, much 
valuable Information for planning and decision making is now 
available. Adams is quite pleased with his investment in the 
Apple and recommends it highly to the small business owner. 

A Plan for Using a Computer In a Small Business. As men- 



tioned last month, we'll be presenting a guidebook, during the 
next several columns, that covers planning for and using a 
computer in your business. Without trying to be "all things to 
all people," we'll attempt to present guidelines for those al- 
ready in business (but just starting), those who are consider- 
ing using their Apples in their businesses, and those who mig^t 
like to start a business using their Apples. 

We anticipate having brief sections dealing with such topics 
as where the computer can be used effectively, what kinds of 
new businesses you might start with your Apple, how to deter- 
mine the computer needs of your business, how to choose hard- 
ware, how to choose software, and planning for growth. In addi- 
tion, we anticipate that some miscellaneous topics may be of 
interest. It's important, for example, to become familiar with 
service options, strategies for choosing diskettes, cleaning and 
maintaining equipment, the options available with hard disks, 
the impact of the video disk, the potential for networks, 
graphics applications, and adding a communications option to 
your Apple. 

Since a previous column dealt with the most common busi- 
ness applications, it should be sufficient merely to summarize 
them here. Typical first applications are mailing list main- 
tenance, accounts payable, accounts receivable, and word 
processing. Soon thereafter, inventory control, order entry, 
and perhaps payroll applications are instituted. 

Eventually, a database system is acquired to provide man- 
agement with instant access to important business informa- 
tion. This is often followed by financial modeling and forecast- 
ing applications, intensified use of graphics (for output re- 
ports) , and perhaps the addition of a hard disk. 

Starting Your Own Business. Many people who have per- 
sonal computers in their homes are looking for ways in which 
to use the computer in a new side business. This is precisely 
how many of the advertisers of products in Softalk got started. 
It is also how the Apple itself came to fruition. So, be wary! 
That sideline business of yours may blossom into something 
qiiite substantial. In today's economy, anything that has the 
potential of adding to one's income should be explored 
thoroughly. This is not meant to imply that everyone who 
starts up an inhouse business will be successful, but such a ven- 
ture certainly deserves some attention. 

The first question is : What kind of a business? This is really 
limited only by one's creativity and ingenuity. To be successful, 
you need a good idea, some aggressiveness, some talent, and a 
lot of persistence. 

There are generally two directions you can take. The first is 
to offer a service to local organizations. It's likely that your 
service would provide some of the more traditional applica- 
tions. For example, you might prepare and maintain mailing 
lists for local clubs or organizations or teach about microcom- 
puters in your town's continuing education program. You 
might use your word processing system to type term papers 
for students, prepare reports for local government officials, or 
type promotional material for area businesses. Or how about 
maintaining statistical summaries for the local bowling 
league? Computer dating services that use microcomputers to 
match clients are springing up in some areas. Perhaps the ca- 
ble television company in your area might be interested in hav- 
ing analyses done concerning viewer preferences. 

The second option is to create something new. This can be 
very exciting and also very profitable. Here, you can either do

your own original programming If you have the talent or, more 
likely, take an existing package and develop a specialized ap- 
plication for it. 

You might, for instance, take one of the database packages 
and design a system that enables a police department to keep 
track of the burglaries in a town (location, time of day, day of 
week, amount taken, value of stolen property, property list, 
method of entry, and so on). You could then offer such a sys- 
tem for sale. Be sure to select an application that has the po- 
tential for a fairly significant volume of sales. In the example 
given, if the system were well designed and accepted, every 
police department would be a prospective client. 

If you do not wish to get involved in the development of a to- 
tal System, you can develop a specific application for use with 
an existing package and market it to owners of that package. 
Obvious examples of this trend are the many VisiCalc applica- 
tion packages. Perhaps you can think of a new one. How about 
VisiCalc applications for attorneys? Could you develop a data- 
base system for a local politician's office? Lots of areas are as 
yet untouched. Be aggressive ! Try out your ideas. There are 
plenty of great ideeis that never escape from people's heads. 
Let yours out.

Product Review. Software Technology for Computers is of- 
fering database users three versions of its IFO Database Pack- 
age. Version 1 is a low cost package ($120) that will keep rec- 
ords of inventories, patients, clients and so on. It uses a single 
disk drive. Version 2 (at $200) requires two drives and has a 
more flexible report formating capability. In addition, version 
2 supports some eighty-column boards, lower case, and the Ep- 
son printer. Version 3 has been designed for the Corvus hard 
disk drive. Therefore, both storage capacity and retrieval 
speed are significantly improved. It is offered at $450. 

The hardware required to run IFO is, of course, dependent 
upon which version you are using. It's safe to say, however, 
that you need at least the following: a 48K Apple II Plvus (or Ap- 
ple II with Applesoft on ROM), DOS 3.3, a printer (40, 80, or 
132-column serial or parallel printer) , and the appropriate disk 
drives. 

As for the characteristics of the IFO series, the table sum- 
marizes some of the features included.

These are only a few of the features that are part of IFO but 
they should help you to determine if you want more informa- 
tion about these packages. 

One of the nice aspects of IFO is its upward mobility. You 
can start with Version 1 and, ajs your needs and talents grow, 
move upward quite easily to the more advanced versions. An- 
other unusual characteristic of this database package is its 
ease of use. You can get started with IFO in a few minutes. 
Ease of use has been a prime focus of Software Technology for 
Computers in the development of their software. The user 
g^de we looked at (for version 1) is clearly written and takes 
the reader step-by-step through the design and use of a data- 
base. 

Actual screen examples, sample input forms, and output 
reports are absent from this manual (as they are from many) . 
But if you are sitting at your Apple while going through the 
manual, the use of the system is perfectly clear. If you are con- 
sidering the acquisition of a database package, IFO should be 
one of your candidates.

428, Belmont, MA, or (617) 923-4334.

samples of forms in the areas of education, media, medical, 
sales, science, small business, and contracting. There are 
more than thirty forms in the booklet. In addition, the compa- 
ny will soon be releasing a companion booklet, PFS Report 
Sa mpler, that will contain actual samples of reports that have 
been designed using PFS. 

This idea has real merit. Users need as much support and 
assistance as they can possibly get. Few users know the proper 
way to design a data input form or even a final output report. 
In addition, some of the packages available are not as clear as 
one might expect when it comes to explaining how to input 
data and get results printed out, making things all the more 
difficult for the poor user. If you own PFS or are considering 
purchasing it, make sure you inquire about getting these new 
publications. Perhaps other software developers will consider 
making similar samples available to their present and pro- 
spective customers. 

The Readers Speak. "I find myself taking my Apple back 
and forth between my home and my office. Can this damage 
the machine at all? Are there any suggestions you might have 
that can make this process easier? My setup (an Apple with 
two drives) is portable enough but it's a pain In the neck carry- 
ing it back and forth." A. G. Atlanta, Georgia. 

Well, you could simply move into your office — or move your 
office into your home. As another solution, perhaps you could 
buy another Apple. What, neither of these is viable? Then let's 
consider your Apple. 

In the long-run, moving your Apple around is simply not 
good for your Apple. After all, a computer is a piece of elec- 
tronic equipment with a lot of very sensitive pieces. Pulling 
boards out, disconnecting wires, and so on is hazardous to your 
machine's health. 

Furthermore, never, never Just pack your Apple, disks 
piled on top, into the back seat of your car — or into the trunk — 
to transport it. To the praise of the designers, most Apples sur- 
vive transitions from place to place. But moving It is risky. In- 
curred problems might be as trivial as some dirt entering your

disk drive or as serious as your Apple entering your floor as 
you trip or lose your grip. 

If you must move your equipment around, purchase a 
carrying case. Several firms advertise cases in computer 
magazines and most have booths at computer shows. Carry- 
ing case prices range from $99 to a few hundred dollars de- 
pending upon capacity, quality, and detail. Cases are built for 
any combination of Apple, disk drive or drivers, monitor, and 
printer. Some of the cases are lightweight for local travel; 
others can survive the rigors of long-distance air travel. Pick 
the one to suit your needs. It's a small investment to make to 
protect a bigger one— and it's a lot easier to carry, too. 

A Reader's Question for You. One of our readers needs in- 
formation about phone communications, especially those using 
the Hayes modems. 

This reader has hired a tyro programmer who has been do- 
ing remarkably well in developing programs the company 
needs. But communications routines are causing some prob- 
lems. There seems to be a timing problem; there are so many 
delays in the program that data is transmitted at roughly 110 
baud instead of 300 baud. There also are no error-checking rou- 
tines to check for lost data. 

This user is not necessarily looking for a complete pro- 
gram or solution — a reference book or article would be enough. 
Does anyone have a suggestion? 

Some readers have written in with enthusiasm about form- 
ing a business user group. As a beginning. Mind Your Busi- 
ness will mind the business of maintaining a database of all 
who express interest in this plan to facilitate more formal or- 
ganization later on. In the meantime, let's use this column aa a 
means of sharing experiences, questions, and needs with one 
another. 

Database Summary. Summaries of particular topics that 
have been discussed over the course of a year or so can be 
quite useful. To this end, we are putting together a summary of 
all the features of databases. Much has changed since we did 
this last. 

We'll be asking vendors of the various programs to com- 
plete a fact sheet on their databases (characters per field, rec- 
ords per file, and so on), and we'll add ratings where appli- 
cable. We'd especially like to include users' ratings. 

If you use a database package currently or have had ex- 
perience with one in the past, please send your comments 
along. Include the name of the package, the version number, 
and your date of purchase (approximate will do) . Have fun rat- 
ing the programs for ease of use, documentation, vendor ser- 
vice and support, and product strengths and weaknesses. We 
have a lot of valuable data to share with one another. 

Let's aim for a summer issue. Get moving! 

New Questions and Oosing Comments. If you have not yet 
completed the questionnaire that was included in the March is- 
sue of Softalk (remember, "Olivieri's Inquisition"?), please do 
so now and return It. 

Inquisitors are traditionally relentless, and Olivieri is no ex- 
ception. Here are some additional questions for you: 

Do you use a mailing list program in your business? If so, 
which one? What are its strengths and weaknesses? 

What kind of printer do you use? What do you like or dislike 
about it? 

Got it? Then here's a summary of what you can do to make 
Minding Your Business work for you. Send: (1) your Oli- 
vieri's Inquisition; (2) help for our business user; (3) what 
mailing list package you are using; (4) what printer you own; 
(5) your rating of the databases you use or have used; and (6) 
anything else that strikes your fancy. 

So long, and have a great month. HI

The Second Annual 
Applefest 
Plays in May 



Who cannot remember the thrill of the 
day you purchased your first Apple? Or 
the rush of Imagination that accom- 
panies slipping a new piece of software 
into the disk drive, and discovering the 
ease with which it allows you to mine its 
potential? Or even the ecstasy of reach- 
ing 200,000 points at Crossfire'! (In my 
case 50,000 — ho hum.) 

If any of this elicits even a faint "blip" 
in your memory, come May you will as- 
suredly be ripe for Applefest '82, the 
world's largest Apple-specific computer 
show for users and producers, a verita- 
ble one-stop shopping spree for every- 
thing Apple. 

It really began last year with Apple- 
fest '81, the brainchild of Jonathan Roten- 
berg and the Apple/Boston user group of 
the Boston Computer Society, which 
broke all records as the best organized, 
most successful show of its kind. It was 
the first national computer show devoted 
exclusively to Apple computers. 

Leading Off with Jobs. Expanded and 
redesigned, this year's Applefest is again 
produced by the Boston Computer So- 
ciety. It's also the first event of its kind to 
receive official endorsement from Apple 
Computer Inc., the guys that started it 
all. In fact, keynote speaker for Apple- 
fest '82 will be none other than the chair- 
man of the board himself — Steve Jobs. 

Applefest '81 proved the practical 
value of presenting the state of the art in 
the world of Apple with software, periph- 
erals, and accesories geared specifically 
to the Apple user. Just being there was 
enjoyable, but beyond the general at- 
mosphere, which was open and friendly, 
the great diversity of people attending 
and their high degree of enthusiasm for 
the variety of offerings placed Applefest 



apart from previous computer shows. 

Disappointed by other Apple shows he 
had attended, John Williams (On-Line 
Systems) called Applefest "the best com- 
puter show I've ever been to in my life." 
Roger Tuttleman (Sensible Software) ap- 
preciated the chance Applefest afforded 
to meet the "names" behind the many 
companies. 

Art Malin (Santa Clara Systems), 
Tim Hartley (Hartley Courseware) , and 
Steve Boker (Data Transforms) all 
agreed on the great response their re- 
spective products received at Applefest, 
which was reflected in the business it 
generated for them throughout the year. 

A Special Excitement. But the more 
than two million dollars' worth of sales 
that it generated is only one obvious 
gauge of its success; more telling per- 
haps is the fact that Applefest left every- 
one who attended with a feeling of excite- 
ment that they had been a part of some- 
thing special, a feeling that is carried 
over into the mounting anticipation of Ap- 
plefest '82. 

Five times larger than last year, with 
the number of exhibitors tripled, Apple- 
fest '82 can expect an attendance of 
twenty thousand to thirty thousand Ap- 
ple users and prospective buyers. To ac- 
commodate all this under one roof, Ap- 
plefest will be using New England's larg- 
est (150,000 square foot) and most mod- 
em convention facility, Hynes Audi- 
torium, which is part of the Prudential 
Center Complex and adjacent to the 
Sheraton Boston Hotel. 

Easily accessible by public transpor- 
tation or by car via primary highways, 
the auditorium is surrounded by Bos- 
ton's best restaurants, clubs, theaters, 
and stores. This year, Applefest will be

fully air-conditioned, and those attend- 
ing can enjoy a restaurant facility on the 
premises with the exhibits. Ample park- 
ing is conveniently provided at the audi- 
torium site for a nominal fee. The build- 
ing is designed without stairways, in con- 
sideration for the handicapped, who can 
avail themselves of elevators and spe- 
cially reserved parking nearby. Wid- 
ened aisles in the exhibit area promise to 
make getting around inside easier too. 

Lots To See and Learn. In addition to 
almost four hundred exhibitors provid- 
ing a tremendous array of things Ap- 
ple-related, numerous education pro- 
grams, much expanded from last year, 



will run continuously throughout the 
three-day event. Here's a brief preview 
of some of the seminars to be presented 
at Applefest '82: There'll be return en- 
gagements by Daniel Bricklin (Software 
Arts Inc.) speaking on "After VisiCalc: 
The Future of Personal Computer Soft- 
ware," and Leonard Freed (Microcom) 
speaking on the Apple and telecommuni- 
cations. Also speaking will be Softalk 
columnist and author of the just-pub- 
lished Assembly Lines: The Book, Roger 
Wagner (Southwestern Data Systems), 
on how to make the Apple do amazing 
things with machine language ; Greg Tib- 
betts (Microsoft), another Softalk col- 



umnist, on the Apple and CP/M; Mark 
Schwartz (Cavri Systems) on interac- 
tive video; Mark Pelczarskl (Pengtiin 
Software), whose graphics column be- 
gins in Softalk next month, on creating 
color graphics with the Apple ; and Jock 
McCleen (Terrapin) on Apples, Turtles, 
and LOGO. Other seminars will encom- 
pass the topics of how to buy business 
software, how to use the Apple as an aid 
to making investments, and how en- 
trepreneurs can get involved in the Ap- 
ple world. 

A new feature this year will be the 
special software spotlights. Happening 
every hour throughout the show (with re- 
peats so you don't miss anything), in- 
depth demonstrations will be presented 
using large video screens to spotlight a 
wide variety of different software pack- 
ages. Hundreds of products can be 
viewed in this way, covering the areas of 
business, education, utilities, and games. 
The authors of the software will be pres- 
ent for you to talk with and question. 

A Hundred Apples To Play With. The 
popular hands-on rooms return this year, 
expanded to include one hundred Apple II 
and Apple III computers for you to "test 
drive." For Apple owners and prospec- 
tive owTiers alike, the hands-on rooms of- 
fer a marvelous opportunity to try out the 
Apple or learn more about its many ap- 
plications. An informative multimedia 
show developed by Apple Computer will 
also be running continuously for the dura- 
tion of the festival. 

Let all who attend Applefest/Boston 
'82 be forewarned: wear comfortable 
shoes and bring lots of money — ^there will 
be much to see and much to be pur- 
chased. Tickets, which include every- 
thing at a single price, are $6 per day, $10 
for two days, or $15 for a three-day ticket. 
Days and hours of the festival at Hynes 
Auditorium are May 14, 15, and 18, 11 
a.m. to 6 p.m. 

Through an extensive promotional 
campaign using direct mail and national 
advertising, many people will be drawn 
to Boston for the festival, and accommo- 
dations are even now becoming difficult 
to obtain. For assistance in arranging ac- 
commodations and to pxirchase tickets, 
those who wish to attend may call or 
write National Computer Shows, 824 
Boylston Street, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167, 
or telephone (617) 739-2000. 

For those who cannot go to Boston to 
attend, there is good news. Throughout 
1982, Applefest will be touring to the 
larger regional cities so, if you live near 
Chicago, Houston, or San Francisco, you 
will still have the opportunity to partake 
of the experience of Applefest. 

All Apple, pure and simple, not di- 
luted by the wares of other microcom- 
puter manufacturers — Applefest '82, 
promising to be an Impressive motiva- 
tion for prospective buyers who have not 
yet taken a byte and the one show taken 
very seriously by all Apple users worth 
their sap.

The Changing CharacterCs) 

of the Apple III Bv ]om lEPPson 



Tired of the same old crowd? Want to meet some new char- 
acters? Here's how to make your own. Give your Apple III pro- 
grams a new look by typing with custom-made characters you 
create yourself. 

Operating a computer means typing. We type, the machine 
"types," and neat little characters appear on the screen. But 
the shape of each individual letter or number or punctuation 
mark is not frozen in metal as it is on a typewriter. The char- 
acter shapes are stored as information in a special part of the 
computer's memory, the character set. If that information can 
be changed, and in the Apple III it can, then the computer can 
put on a whole new face. 

The Key To Horsing Around. In most small computers the 
character set information is fixed. It is usually stored in per- 
manent read-only (ROM) memory and cannot be changed. But 
one of the fundamental features of Apple III is a commitment 
to keeping everything in software. Apple III contains only 4K 
bytes of ROM memory, which is used for booting and for inter- 
nal diagnostics. The entire operating system is on disk and is 
booted into RAM memory. The advantage, obviously, is that 
the system can be upgraded periodically by simply booting a 
revised operating system from another disk. Changing char- 
acter sets on Apple m is a similar process. You simply change 
the information stored on disk or in RAM memory or both and, 
presto, a new character set is up and running. The trick is 
Imowing which information to change. 

Please note that we are not discussing drawing letter- 
shaped figfures on a gfraphics screen. That is possible, usually 
with great difficulty, on many computers. On the Apple III you 
may modify the characters used on the ordinary text screen to 
achieve a wide variety of special effects. Using line segment 
characters, you can create neat forms and outlines for menus 
and tables. Or, by rapidly reprinting a series of picture frag- 
ment characters, each one slightly different, you can produce 
such remarkable animation as is in the horse sequence on the 
demonstration disk. 

Apple in actually comes with four complete sets of charac- 
ters, called fonts. They are named Standard, Roman, Apple 
and Byte. BYom Business Basic one can easily switch to any of 
these fonts by using the Download program and the Down- 
load.inv invokable module. Or, from Pascal, you can use the 
Unitstatus procedure. Also, the System Configuration Pro- 
gram has facilities for transferring any of these sets into the 
SOS.DRIVER file of a boot disk. Then, when that disk is 
booted, the specified font will be the system character set in 
which text is printed. 

A complete character set consists of 128 separate charac- 
ters that correspond to ASCII codes 0 to 127. Normally the Ap- 
ple in console will print only characters 32 to 127. The first 
thirty-two ASCn codes (0 through 31) are control codes. In- 
stead of generating a printing character, they signal the con- 
sole to perform special functions such as moving the cursor. So 
it would seem that the first thirty-two character positions are 
useless, since the console won't print them. 

The Open-Apple Policy. Apple m, however, has a special 
shift key, the Open-Apple key, that increases by 128 the value 
of the ASCn code produced by any other key. Holding Open- 
Apple while typing the key combination for any code in the 
range 0 through 127 actually transmits a corresponding shifted 
code in the range 128 through 255. Open- Apple sets the eighth or 
high bit (number seven of 0 through 7) of the character byte 
which, in binary, is the same as adding 128. When the console 
receives a code in the high range (128 through 265) its actions 



are a little complex, but, in essence, the console prints high-bit 
characters just as if they were not shifted, except that the 
thirty-two codes in the range 128 through 159, instead of execut- 
ing control functions, actually print the characters in positions 
0 through 31 of the character set. Thus one can see all the char- 
acters by printing codes 32 through 127 (regular characters) 
and codes 128 through 159 (characters 0 through 31). It's as 
though the first thirty-two characters were wrapped around 
and placed at the end of the set. 

The following program uses Business Basic's powerful 
print using and image commands to display all the characters 
in a neat array. The first thirty-two characters are placed at 
the end as if they were numbered 128 through 159. Assuming 
you are presently using the Standard font you will see that 
each of these first thirty-two characters is a cute two-letter 
representation of the traditional control-code name. 

PROGRAM SHOW.SET 
10 PRINT 

20 FOR i=32 TO 47 
30 FOR j = 0 TO 7 
40 nurtiber=i + 16 * j 

50 PRINT USING 100;number,CHR$(number); 

60 NEXT i,i 

100 IMAGE 3i¥,2R,5x 

When you desigfn a character of your own you can store it in 
place of any one of the 128 characters in the set. But the first 
storage site to consider is the block of thirty-two "extra" char- 
acters at the beginning. That way you won't lose the services of 
any of the ordinary characters in the rest of the set. For exam- 
ple, you could make a math symbol such as the Greek letter pi 
(TT) and place its defining information in the slot for ASCII 
code (2) . It will then appear on the screen when you type the 
key combination Open-Apple-control-B. Or, from a Basic pro- 
gram, you can print the string "It" = 3.14159" with the state- 
ment: 

100 PRINT CHR$(130);" = 3.14159":REM (130 = 2 + 128) 

As a matter of fact, the Roman and Apple fonts supplied with 
the Apple III each include pi as ASCII code (18). 

The only disadvantage of using the 0 through 31 block is that 
printing a long series of such characters from a program may 
require a prodigious amount of extra typing. For example, a 
string composed of the first five ASCII characters is generated 
by: 

100 G$ = CHR$(128)+CHR$(129)+CHR$(130)+CHR$(131)+CHR$(132) 
110 PRINT G$ 

That gets old pretty fast. But this restriction applies only if you 
intend to make a printout of your program listing on an exter- 
nal printer. Such devices tend to be unsympathetic about 
exotic ASCII codes. If you are just typing in a program for your 
own use to run and store on disk, you can simply use the ap- 
propriate key combinations as you would for any other string. 
Thus: 

100 G$ = "@ABCD":REM but holding OpenApple and control keys 
110 PRINT G$ 

The Righteous Power of 2. As we noted, a complete charac- 
ter set contains definitions for 128 separate characters. Each 
character is completely defined in eight bytes of binary code. 
So there are 128 X 8 = 1024 bytes of information in a character 
set. This is exactly two 512-byte blocks, a block being the mini- 
mum amount of data transferred in any read or write opera-

tion between the Apple III and a disk. It's no coincidence that 
all these numbers are even powers of two. Around computers, 
if a number is not a power of two, it's probably wrong. 

So the character set as a whole contains 1,024 bytes of infor- 
mation physically located one after another in sequence, either 
on a disk or as consecutive bytes in memory. The first charac- 
ter, ASCII 0, begins at byte 0 and runs for eight bytes (0 
through 7). The next character, ASCII 1, starts at byte 8 and 
runs through byte 15. In general, the eight bytes defining char- 
acter ASCII N begin at byte 8*N. Thus the definition of letter J 
(ASCn 74) is stored as eight bytes beginning at byte 8 X 74 = 692 
(bytes 592 through 599) . The next letter, K, begins at byte 600. 

If one catalogs the contents of the Business Basic Disk, one 
finds a fontfile named STANDARD. This file is exactly 1,024 
bytes long and consists solely of the 1,024 binary data bytes de- 
fining the standard character set. Bj^es 592 through 599 of this 
file are found to be (in decimal form) : 

32 32 32 32 32 34 28 0 

These eight bytes completely define the letter J. Each byte, of 
course, is a pattern of eight binary bits (either 0 or 1) , and it is 
the sequence of bits, in each of the eight bytes, that is mapped 
onto the screen as a pattern of dots. We see the resulting pat- 
tern as a character. 

The Apple III monitor screen is divided into eighty col- 
umns and twenty-four rows. Thus, there are 80 X 24 = 1920 dif- 
ferent printing locations on the screen. Each location is a char- 
acter cell and consists, in turn, of a seven-by-eight array of 
dots. In other words, each cell has eight rows of dots, and each 
row is seven dots wide. The eight bytes of the character defi- 
nition correspond to the eight rows of the cell and, for each 
byte, the low order seven bits (0 through 6) are mapped onto 
the seven dots in the corresponding row. If a bit is 1, then that 
dot is turned on, and in this manner the character's form is 
created. The eighth or high bit (number seven of 0 through 7) is 
a control bit, the purpose of which we shall see in a moment. 

Doing What Comes Naturally. Figiire 1 shows how the eight 
bytes that define letter J form a map that produces the letter. 
Note that the character cell dots are numbered from left to 
right (0 through 6) , whereas the corresponding bits of the bi- 
nary data byte are numbered from right to left. Of course, it 
seems only natural to us to number screen dots from left to 
right. And it seems equally natural to write all our numbers, 
including binary numbers, the other way around, with the least 
significant (units) column at the right. Computers are not 
blessed with an intuitive understanding of what is natural and 
are therefore not troubled by these problems. 

The high bit (number seven of 0 through 7) is not mapped 
onto the screen. This bit controls what happens to the other 
seven bits (0 through 6) when text is printed in inverse mode. If 
the high bit is 0, then the foreground and background colors are 
simply reversed, but If the bit is 1, then that row of dots flashes 
alternately between normal and inverse. Interesting effects 
can be achieved. In normal mode the high bit does nothing. 

The problem of constructing a new character resolves it- 
self into the task of converting a dot-array pattern, drawn per- 
haps on graph paper. Into the corresponding binary data bjrtes, 
and then somehow storing those eight bytes in their proper

place in a character set file. The accompanying program, De- 
sign Characters Utility, is intended to carry out this task in a 
convenient and pleasing manner. 

Before we can present the program itself, it is necessary to 
clarify some rather confusing aspects of files. A file is an ex- 
ternal chunk of information that, for purposes of this article, 
we assume to be on a floppy disk. A file contains certain data, a 
sequence of binary data bytes, stored there for future use by 
the computer. But there is more to a file than the information it 
is intended to contain. Many files, not all, also contain other in- 
ternal bytes that give the file structure. They may define 
where one portion of information ends and another begins, or 
they may tell the computer how to interpret the stored data 
bytes, whether as an integer, an ASCII character, or what- 
ever. There are in fact several different patterns of file struc- 
ture into which the data proper might be placed. 

What's In a Name? Every file also has a name. The name, 
however, is not stored in the file itself. It is kept in a separate 
file, the disk directory. Thus a filename might be changed 
without affecting the contents of the file at all, altering only the 
directory listing. Ample facilities are provided for changing a 
file's name. 

Similarly, every file has a type name. This is also an entry 
in the directory, stored along with the filename, the file's loca- 
tion and other information describing the file. "There are quite 
a number of type names: Basic text, Basic data, Pascal text, 
Pascal data, Basic Program, Pascal Code, System (SOS), Fo- 
to (graphic pictures) , and Font. And a few others. Naturally 
the type name Is expected to reflect the actual physical type as 
it really is, which sounds simple . . . but it's not. 

In theory, one Is never supposed to have to mess around 
with type names. Their only real purpose is to detect errors, 
and since you obviously never make any errors you are un- 
likely ever to encounter them. Someone, however, might try to 
access what is expected to be a Basic textfile but give instead 
the name of a Pascal codefile. 

The resulting mess Is likely to bomb the program ; or, much 
worse, the program might actually run with this misinter- 
preted garbage and produce meaningless results. People 
might be led to do ridiculous things. A former movie actor 
might run for president. So languages such as Basic and Pas- 
cal automatically check to be sure that the file type is the type 
appropriate for the command being executed. Specifically, 
what the language checks is the type name in the directory. If 
it isn't right, you get zapped with an error. 

The other side of the coin is that the language assigns a type 
name when it creates a file. For example, saving a Basic pro- 
gram creates a file that, not unexpectedly, is type-named Ba- 
sic Program. But there are some rather strict limitations. 
From within a Basic program, using the language Basic, one is 
allowed to create or open only three tj^es of files : Basic text- 
files, Basic datafiles and a type that Basic calls unknown. This 
type is created when a new file has been opened and then 
closed again prior to storage of any information. If informa- 
tion is stored, using PRINT#1 or WRITE#1, that act deter- 
mines the type name, either text or data respectively. But 
without information storage or a type designation in the create 
statement, the file catalogs as "UNKNWN"— an ugly type 
which we shall carefully avoid. 

An attempt to open a file of any type other than text, data, 
or unknwn stops the program with an error. In particular, 
there is no possible way from Basic to create or open a file with 
the directory type name "Fontfile." Note that we are talking 
about an entry in the directory, not the file itself. Strangely 
enough, it is possible to create and store on disk a "Baaic" file, 
albeit an abnormal Basic file, which is identical in every re- 
spect to a Fontfile, except that the directory will call it a "Ba- 
sic" file. It is then very frustrating to have a perfectly good 
Fontfile (internally) and have the system refuse to use it be- 
cause of some name in the directory. 

It Would Smell as Sweet. So, you ask, why not change the 
type name? After all, it's just a name, like the filename. Well, 
from Pascal you can do just that. The Pascal Filer has an Alter 



APRIL 1982 



137 



option specifically intended for that purpose. It asks what the 
new file t3rpe shall be, and you reply "Fontfile," and it's done 
... if you have Pascal. How about the System Utilities Pro- 
gram? It also has a "Filer." In fact, the System Utilities Filer 
and the Pascal Filer are almost identical. The System Util- 
ities Filer implements almost every single option available in 
the Pascal Filer — except this one. EHd they forget, or run out of 
room on the disk, or did the designers think that people who use 
Basic have no business fooling around with changing type 
names? Whichever it is, the result is the same. If you don't 
have Pascal, you can't change the type name. But take heart; 
all is not lost. By sufficiently sneaky and devious means we can 
work around them. 

All too often one runs afoul of such "legal" restraints. In 
fact, Pascal, with its strong typing is notorious for this. It is 
said that the real difference between EngUsh law and French 
law is that in England everything is permitted unless it is spe- 
cifically prohibited while in France everything is prohibited 
unless it is specifically permitted. By those lights the people 
who design computers and computer languages are definitely 
French. They make everything illegal and then we all spend 
the next twenty-five years trying to get around it. 

To use a file, any file, the computer must transfer it to RAM 
memory. Even if you think you are writing to one small rec- 
ord in a large random access file, the computer always reads 
in a minimum of 1 block (512 bytes) , changes the small area in 
RAM, and writes the block back out again to the disk. So to ma- 
nipulate a Fontfile the computer must read in the 1,024 bytes 
and put them in RAM. Basic can't handle it. Basic can access 
only Basic Textfiles and Basic Datafiles. But on the Business 
Basic Disk there is a machine language invokable module, 
Download.inv, which neatly does the job. Doionload.inv has 
two separate procedures : getfont and loadfont. Getfont reads a 
Fontfile (and, alas, only a file type-named Fontfile) . It trans- 
fers the information from disk to program memory. Loadfont 
is then used to transfer the information from program mem- 
ory to the system character set area where it can begin to func- 



tion. In between, while the information is in program mem- 
ory, it is available to Basic programs and can be altered at 
will. 

Indelible Ink. When getfont transfers information from disk 
to program memory it maps each bj^e of the 1,024-byte Font- 
file into a corresponding 1,024-bj^e section of RAM. But it can't 
put this chunk just anywhere or you would never find it again. 
One supplies an address by giving the name of a program var- 
iable. Getfont puts the data in the variable, and later, when you 
access the variable, there's the data. The variable you choose 
must be the right size, at least 1,024 bj^es. If it's too small, get- 
font will slop data over onto surrounding memory, probably 
with disastrous results. 

In Pascal one can specify and allocate a block of 1,024 con- 
secutive memory positions by declaring a packed array of 
bytes: 

var fontinfo: packed array [0..1023] of 0..255; 

The data is transferred from disk to the variable fontinfo, and 
you can look at any byte you wish by: 

info := fontinfo[byte number]; 

Unfortunately, Basic doesn't have any one-byte variables. But 
one can achieve an equivalent result by creating an array of 
two-byte integers: 

100 DIM a%(511) 

In an array, integers are placed one right after another in se- 
quence. Since each integer is two bytes, an array of 512 inte- 
gers (0 through 511) has the required 1,024 bytes. It is essential 
to use the percent symbol (%), which specifies integer, be- 
cause Basic otherwise will think you want "real" numbers, 
each of which occupies four bj^es. The getfont procedure is de- 
signed to expect an integer array as a storage address, and

Ba& of Tricks 

By Don Worth and Pieter Lechner 

Now there is more from the authors of the best selling book Beneath 
Apple DOS — four comprehensive utility programs on disl<ette and 
over 100 more pages of valuable information about the Apple il's 
disk operating system. 

BAG OF TRICKS is useful to beginners and experienced programmers 
alike. It includes many "hand holding" tutorials that assist you in 
repairing damaged diskettes and allow you to change sector ordering, 
reconstruct blown catalogs, etc. etc. etc. At the low price of S39.95, 
BAG OF TRICKS is one of the best software values ever 

The four programs and their functions are: 

1. TRAX dumps and examines a raw track, either 13-sector or 16- 
sector, displays the internal Apple diskette formatting 
information, and flags exceptions to standard formats. 

2. INIT will reformat one or more tracks, attempting to preserve 
the contents of undamaged sectors, it also allows you to change 
sector order. This can cut disk access times by 40% or more! 

3. ZAP is a sector editor like no other! More than 50 commands are 
available to assist you to locate, compare, change, or print the 
data on your diskettes. ZAP is even programmable! Using 
powerful macros, it is possible to transfer and compare DOS, 
CP/M, or PASCAL files. 

4. FiXCAT automates the process of repairing a damaged diskette 
catalog. It operates with or without user intervention, locating 
"lost" files and rebuilding the catalog — from scratch if necessary! 
DOS removal and VTOC repair are also possible.

loadfont expects an integer array as the source of data to move 
to the character set area. 

Since each integer contains two bytes, the eight bytes de- 
fining a particular character can be called for only as a se- 
quence of four integers. To look at individual bytes it is neces- 
sary to split the integer into its two component bytes. Basic has 
a neat way to do it (an example of each step is on the right) : 

First convert the integer to a four-character hexadecimal 
string. 



100 hexstringS = HEX$(integer%) 

Split the string in half 

no leftbyteS = LEFT$(hexstrina$,2) 
120 rightbyteS = RIGHT$(hexstring$,2) 

Make each half a four-character string 

130 leftbyte$ = "00" -t- leftbyte$ 
140 rightbyteS = "00" -I- rightbyteS 

Convert each string to an Integer 

150 leftbyte% = TEN(leftbyte$) 
160 rightbyte% = TEN(rightbyte$) 



7210 — > "1C2A" 



"1C2A" 



-> "IC" 
-> "2A" 



"IC" — > "OOlC" 
"2A" — > "002A" 



"001 C" — > 28 
"002A" — > 42 



This may be condensed to: 

100 leHbyte% = TEN("00" + LEFT$(HEX$(integer%),2)) 
110 rightbyte% = TEN("00" + RIGHT$(HEX$(integer%),2)) 

Unfortunately, the getfont procedure checks up on the type 
name. It works well on the Fontfiles provided on the Business 
Basic Disk, but it will accept only a Fontfile. It will not accept 
any sort of "Basic" file even though the file itself is exactly 
right and just has the wrong tj^pe name ; unless, of course, you 
can change the type name with Pascal. It would seem there is 
little point in creating such a file if it cannot be used. But the 
System Configuration Program has a procedure for the spe- 
cific task of assigning a new character set to the SOS. DRIVER 
file on a boot disk. This procedure also requires a file in the 
Fontfile format, but fortunately it isn't too picky about the type 
name. It will accept the "abnormal" Basic files and thereby 
provides a way to use your new character set as the system set 
on a boot disk. 

What, specifically, is an "abnormal" Basic file? Or a nor- 
mal one, for that matter? Information is stored in Basic files m 
bytes of binary code, just as it is in any file. But Baaic text and 
data files also have a structured network of other code bytes 
separating and identifying the various segments of stored da- 
ta. So whenever information from a Basic file is read back in- 
to the computer, using INPUT^Sd or READ#1, those structural 
bytes are expected, and if they are not there, the system gen- 
erally goes right off the deep end. Fontfiles, however, have no 
structural code. They consist solely of raw binary data, 1,024 
bytes of it. Basic is lost. If such a file happens to have one of the 
"Basic" typenames, then a BmIc program can open it. But 
subsequent read and input statements choke on the unstruc- 
tured code. 

It is actually possible, slowly, to create a pseudo-Fontfile by 
placing raw binary code in a text file with the print statement: 

1 00 PRINT# 1 ;CHR$(0);CHR$( 1 );CHR$( 1 3); 

and so on. Afor-next loop takes about fifteen seconds to trans- 
fer 1,024 bytes from an array in memory to the disk. But, for- 
tunately, there is a quicker way. On the Business Basic Disk 
the invokable modtile RequestAnv contains two procedures, ^i- 
read and filwrite, which effect the same transfer in about a 
second. pSirthermore, with filread one can get the Information 
back again into memory, which input cannot do. And since the 
resulting file has the unstructured format of a fontfile and is a 
fontfile in all but name, it is accepted by the System Con- 



figuration Program for placement in an SOS.DBIVER file. 

The Tail Wags the Dog. Thus we have a small conflict. In 
our program we will want to access the four character sets al- 
ready provided with Business Basic. Lots of Interesting char- 
acters there. Getfont in Doumload.inv loads these fonts very 
nicely. But DoivnloadAnv has no corresponding means for stor- 
ing new character sets back onto the disk again. So we must 
use filwrite for storage. Filwrite and filread are very fast, very 
efficient. We can store a new character set and promptly re- 
cover it again. But these procedures absolutely require that 
the file be opened from Basic. And that, in turn, requires one of 
the three Basic files. One cannot open a fontfile. It's really sil- 
ly. The files themselves are identical. The procedures are just 
hung up on type names, and these, inexplicably, cannot be 
changed. Well, obviously, we will just have to have two sepa- 
rate input procedures and two types of font storage files. But it 
certainly isn't elegant. 

Once we have created a new character set, as by this time 
you are doubtless panting to do, we will need a convenient way 
to use it. The following program is a rewrite of Apple's Dotonr 
load program on the Business Basic Disk. The only change is 
that instead of reading only Fontfiles it tries first to read a 
Fontfile and then, if the first effort fails, it trys again with 
filread. Thus it can handle either type of Font storage.

Overcoming Tails and Roses. Design Characters Utility, 
the program at the end of this article, provides an array of 
squares representing a single character cell. The dot pattern of 
any existing character can be displayed, or one can "X" in 
squares to create and modify characters. The program then 
calculates a new set of definition bytes and stores the new 
character at a specified ASCII number in the set. 

The program also provides for loading fonts into a tempo- 
rary integer array. Some or all of these characters may then 
be incorporated in the new character set array. And Show.Set 
is available to display the entire character set on the screen af- 
ter temporarily activating it with loadfont. 

The Design Characters Utility is designed to run if a lazy 
typist (surely, gentle reader, neither of us) omits all the re- 
marks. Variable names can also be truncated to one or two 
characters if duplicates are avoided. But most of the state- 
ments that use integer variables really need integers, so don't 
omit percent symbols. 

As an example of the benefits of special characters, follow 
these steps for a trial run; you'll also bootstrap a nice im- 
provement in the program: 

1. Be sure the progfram is saved on disk. 

2. Make and store the characters in figure 2, labeled ASCII 
1 through ASCII 11. Be sure the proper character is assigned to 
the proper character number. Store the new character set on 
disk (£is, for example, "newset"). 

3. Run NEWDOWNLOAD to get the new Font working. 

4. Reload the main program and change lines 340 through 
370 as shown. When you have saved the new version, run it. 
Mark some of the squares and see what happens when the cur- 
sor falls on a previous mark.

Note: type the string characters in lines 355, 370, and 375 
while holding both Open- Apple and control. These are high-bit 
characters— "A" = CHR${129), and so on.

Beware the Snake in the Grass. A word or two of caution : 
Great care must be taken in entering ASCII characters 128 
through 159 directly from the keyboard, particularly in print 
statements. It is extremely easy to enter a true control code 
should Open- Apple not be firmly held. Nothing will show on the 
screen and you will not realize it has happened. But the code 
will be there in your program, waiting. 

And never retype over a high-bit character. Retype reads 
the screen but ignores the high bit. It therefore places in mem- 
ory a naked, unshifted control code; and since control codes 
are not echoed to the screen, retype simply appears not to be 
working. The cursor doesn't even move. But with each stroke 
retype stores in your string another drop of deadly venom that 
later, possibly much later, will emerge to dissolve your moni- 
tor screen into chaos too horrible to be described.

Interested in doing investment analysis before you Invest 
your money? Like to figure out how to do your budgeting and 
save on taxes? Ever wanted to use a PERT chart? You can do 
these things easily with VisiCalc. Over the next few 
months, we'll build these models and more. We'll begin this 
month by looking at some of VisiCalc'a less understood func- 
tions and how to use them. 

VisiCalc III versus Apple II VisiCalc. First a note about dif- 
ferent versions of the program. Apple in VisiCalc and Visir 
Calc for the Apple n in DOS 3.3 are nearly identical, but the 
Apple ni version has some advantages over the Apple II ver- 
sion, all the result of hardware capabilities. The principal ad- 
vantage is the larger memory offered by the in. Here's a chart 
summarizing the differences : 

Memory Configuration Maximum File Size 
Apple II, 48K 18K 
Apple II with 1 6K RAM card 34K 
Apple III, 128K 64K 
Apple III, 256K 192K 

If there's one thing creative VisiCalc users will tend to do, 
it's to try to create a model larger than the available memory 
will allow. The 256K Apple HI will permit users to develop just 
about any model they might need. 

There are three other differences between Apple HI Visi- 
Calc and VisiCalc for the Apple n. The HI has an eighty-col- 
umn display that can show eight nine-character-wide VisiCalc 
columns, rather than the four columns that are displayed on 
the Apple n. The HI also displays upper and lower case char- 
acters on the screen (as well as in hardcopy output) . Finally, 
the VisiCalc III user has the advantage of Apple Ill's four cur- 
sor control keys. 

Although peripherals can equip the Apple n with all but the 
last of these capacities, the Apple n VisiCalc cannot take ad- 
vantage of them. 

Both versions of the program — VisiCalc III and the six- 
teen-sector version for the Apple 11 — incorporate the search 
functions and Boolean functions that we'll be discussing in this 
column and in columns to follow. 

Back to the Beginning . . . What Is VisiCalc? Those of you 
who have been using VisiCalc for a while might want to skip on 
to The New VisiCalc, but for those who are not very familiar 
with it, read on. VisiCalc Is a simple mathematical tool. Think 
of it as a large electronic spreadsheet with 284 rows and 63 col- 
umns. The intersection of a row and a column is called a cell; 
there are 16,002 of them! 

The large black area that fills the bottom three-fourths of 
the monitor screen is the visible worksheet. It might help to 
think of your screen as a window that slides around on the 
worksheet. Using the cursor control keys on the in and the left 
and right arrow keys and spacebar on the Apple n, you can 
move the cursor around the screen and see the letters and 
numbers that define rows and columns change as the cursor 
reaches the edge of the screen. The position of the cursor 
marks the place where you enter information into VisiCalc. 

So much for what you see ; now what does it do? You can en- 
ter three types of information in any cell. The first type is text 



or labels. The second is values (numbers) . The third is formu- 
las or functions (which are treated as values) . That's it. That's 
all VisiCalc does. So why the big hoopla? Well, let's see if we 
can touch on it. 

The text part is simple. Text allows you to label rows and col- 
umns. Values are simple, too. Values are just numbers, but 
functions and formulas use them for their computations. And 
functions and formulas are the real power of VisiCalc. They 
take values and solve for answers. As we continue, you'll see 
many different ways to use functions and formulM. 

Templates are combinations of text, values, fimctlons, emd 
formulas that are developed by the user to solve problems. 
Once completed, templates can be saved to disk and recalled 
at a future date. Later in this article we'll design two simple 
templates, one to compute net present values, the other to fig- 
ure simple Interest. 

Is it hard to design a VisiCalc template? Well, if you can do 
it on paper, you'll probably find It easier to do with VisiCalc. 

VisiCalc is useful for those things like tax computations, 
forecasting, and budgeting, where you must do a lot of compu- 
tation or where you want to change one or more variables and 
see the results. This is its real forte — the ability to build a 
model and have it do the computations. It is also useful for 
changing variables (like interest rates) and seeing what dif- 
ferent results occur. This kind of analysis is commonly called 
"what if" analysis. 

The New VisiCalc. What makes the new VisiCalc— the six- 
teen-sector version for the Apple II or version 1.1 for the Apple 
ni — more powerful? The most important advance Is in the 
area of functions. Functions are common formulM or al- 
gorithms that allow complex procedures to be completed sim- 
ply, quickly, and — most important — automatically. VisiCalc 
now has some new search functions, as well as functions that 
simulate Boolean logic. 

Search Functions. Let's start with the search functions. 
They're called Lookup and Choose. Boot VisiCalc so you can 
follow along. You'll learn more about this if you enter the 
examples whenever you see them and then experiment with 
them. 

Search functions are handy for pulling data from tables. 
Figuring such things as payroll deductions (see last month's 
Ventures with VisiCalc) or Insurance premiums are typical 
applications. Another way to use a search function might be 
for a calendar lookup, where you could enter dates (for things 
like interest calculations) and determine how many days, 
months, or years are between specified dates. We'll discuss 
some of these uses of search functions in later columns. Right 
now let's take a look at Lookup. 

©Lookup. The entry that calls the ©lookup function looks 
like this: ©Lookup (v,range). The v represents a value; it can 
be a number, a reference to another cell, or another formula or 
function. The range represents a portion of a row or column 
that is defined by its beginning and ending coordinates. To 
specify the range, you enter the beginning coordinate, a peri- 
od, and the ending coordinate. VisiCalc automatically dis- 
plays the period as a three-dot ellipsis.

Figure 2. 





Let's see an example of how this works. Enter the follow- 
ing into the indicated cells : 

A3: ©LOOKUP (A1,A5...A10) 

A5: 1 

A6: 3 

A7: 5 

A8: 7 

A9: 9 

AlOtll 

B5 through BIO: random numbers (your choice) 

Al: a value between 1 and 11 (the example below shows 5). 

Your result should look like figure 1. 

Here's what happened. Lookup took the value in Al, 
searched A5 through AlO until it found five, then looked in the 
cell to the right of the five (B7) and displayed the value it found 
there — in this case, eighty-nine. 

To add flexibility to structuring your template, the range 
can be across a row. If the range in our example had been a 
row. Lookup would have searched across the row until it found 
the value it was looking for and then displayed the value from 
the cell directly below. Just remember: the results of a lookup 
will be taken from cells either to the right of or below the 
source range. 

Now replace the five in Al with a six. You'll notice that the 
number six doesn't appear in A5 through AlO and yet the value 
eighty-nine was still returned or displayed in cell A3 (we'll tise 
the terms return and display synonymously) . This is because 
Lookup searches the range until It finds a number greater than 
the value (v) in the function statement and then uses the pre- 
ceding value for the lookup. In our example, it searched until it 
found seven — ^the first number in the table greater than six — 
and then it returned the number in the cell next to five. 

Try some other values and notice the results. If you enter a 
value greater than eleven (the maximum value in the list 
A5. . .AlO), the function will always return forty-four. Con- 
versely, if you enter a value less than the lowest value (in this 
case, one), the function will return an NA. 

If you are going to use Lookup in a template, you'll want to 
remember the latter idiosyncrasy. Any cell that refers to a cell 
holding the value NA will also return an NA. Any formulM that 
include a cell displaying an NA will not return a value, but will 
return NA. To prevent problems, you will want to make sure 
the lookup range Includes maximum and minimum values 
that exceed any number likely to be used as the lookup value. 

©Choose. VisiCalc's lookup capability has been augment- 
ed with a second type of search function, called choose. Choose 
accomplishes much the same thing as lookup, but it requires 
only one column. Another difference between lookup and 
choose is that the former requires a range of contiguous 
values, whereas choose allows a list to be comprised of values, 
cell coordinates, and functions in an arbitrary order. 

The function is written: ©choose (v.list) . Value (v) is the 
same as in lookup. It can be a value, a reference to a cell, a 
formula, or a function. A list is a combination of values and 
ranges. 

Take our example for lookup and do the following: 
In cell B3, enter ©choose (B1,58,B6. . .B10,(A3-I-1)). In cell 
Bl, enter 7. 



Your screen should look like figure 2. 

Choose took the value in Cell Bl, which was 7, and, starting 
with the first value in the list, which was 86, counted seven 
values, returning the value 44 held in cell BIO. If the search 
value at Bl were changed to 8, choose would go to the eighth 
item in the list, A3-H, and return the value 90 (since A3 holds 
89). 

If V is less than one or greater than the number of values in 
the list, choose NA will return an NA. Once again, you should 
carefully consider how this might affect your template. 

The choose function is more flexible than lookup in many 
ways, allowing you to enter a list of values that aren't con- 
tiguous or in any particular order. Using choose, you can look 
up values in places In a template where there isn't room to use 
two columns or rows for a lookup table. 

Other Functions. The other fimctions are a mix of mathe- 
matical tools that will save typing effort (@SUM, for example) 
or provide results otherwise unobtainable (for example, @LN, 
which returns the natural logarithm). As with lookup and 
choose, the argfument of these mathematical fimctions— the 
value upon which they act — may be a range, function, formu- 
la, cell coordinate, or number. A list can be any combination of 
values. 

Arithmetic and Trigonometric Functions. Here are some 
other functions whose purposes are not always clear. 

@ABS(v) returns the absolute value of a number— its value 
without reference to sign. Both @ABS(20) and @ABS(-20) 
will return 20. The assumed positive sign of the first argument 
and the negative sign of the second are both removed, and the 
value is displayed eis an absolute number. 

One obvious use for @ABS is in VisiCalc'a graphic mode. 
The graphic mode will display a value entered in a cell as a 
number of asterisks equal to the value — or to the window 
width, if that is less than the value of the cell. In order to plot 
-3, you must first convert it to an absolute or positive value. 
@ABS makes that task simple. 

@INT) (v) retiuTis the integer portion of a value. If you take 
the @INT of a number like 3.9, you'll get 3. If you are develop- 
ing a financial application that uses the eleven to twelve place 
precision of VisiCalc, you might get rounding errors in some 
calculations. To avoid such rounding errors, it's sometimes 
useful to make VisiCalc less precise, with the help of @INT. 
The formula @INT((v)*100+.5))/100 reduces the calculating 
precision to two decimal places. 

@COUNT(list) returns the number of values in list. If you 
were keeping track of a list of invoices by invoice number, 
count coiJd total the number of invoices entered. 

Net Present Value. @NPV(dr,list) calculates the net pres- 
ent value of future cash flows, based upon a discount rate. 
Wonder what that means in English? Let's take an example. 

Suppose you have a choice between receiving $1,000 today 
or $100 a year for ten years. Intuitively you would probably 
choose to take the $1,000 today. That would be the smart thing 
to do — but do you know why? It may seem like greed, but 
mathematically it works this way: 

Clear the VisiCalc screen, with /CY. In each cell from Al to 
AlO, enter the value 100. At Bl, enter .10 — the discount rate. At 
B3, enter @NPV(B1,A. . .AlO) . The screen would now look like 
figure 3. 

The NPV is $614.4567, At a 10 percent discount rate (ap-

Figure 3. 

proximately equal to inflation) the $1,000 is really only worth 
$614 and some change to you at the end of ten years. Wiy? Be- 
cause of the discount rate — inflation— the $100 you receive each 
year will buy less than $100 will buy today. The amount of 
groceries you could buy with the $100 you receive in the ninth 
year is no more than the amount of groceries you buy with 
$40.81 today. 

You will find that NPV will be an extremely useful fimction 
for doing income investment analysis. 

Let's stop for a second and think about what can be done 
with that $1,000. If you put it in a savlngfs account at 5.75 per- 
cent interest (compounded yearly), how much would it be 
worth in ten years? Here's how to find the answer. 

Clear the VisiCalc screen, with /CY.Enter /GF$ to set the 
spreadsheet to display in dollar-and-cents format. Enter /GOR 
to let VisiCalc calculate across rows. 

Now enter >A10 and return to move the cursor to cell AlO, 
and at that location enter .0575 (5.75 percent) and /FG. At All, 
enter 1000, and at Bll enter the formula 4- AlO* All. The result 
of that formula — $57.50 — is the interest you'll earn on your 
$1,000 in year 1. 

At A12, enter the formula -I- All -I- Bll. That value— 
$1,057.50 — represents your balance at the beginning of the sec- 
ond year. 

At B12, enter -I-A10*A12, to get $60.81, the interest you'll 
earn in the second year. Replicate this last formula, in A12, in- 



T A L 1^ APRIL 1982 

to A13 through A21, and replicate the formula at B12 into B13 
through B20. The replication entries are: 

A 12: /R RETURN 

A13.A21 RETURN 
RR 

B12: /R RETURN 

B13.B20 RETURN 
NR 

You can now determine your balance at the end of ten 
years. It is the $1,749.06 in cell A21. 

This is one method of doing a simple interest calculation, 
with the interest compounded yearly. Change the interest rate 
and/or the initial $1,000 deposit and see what different interest 
rates and deposits can earn you. You can expand this tem- 
plate, using the replicate command, to see what your balance 
will be in any year. 

Follow your intuition; take the $1,000 today and invest it. 
Forward and Circular References. When we started to 
build the simple interest model, you entered the command 
/GOR. Why? When VisiCalc computes, it starts at the top left 
of the spreadsheet and either calculates down the columns 
(A1,A2,A3. . .BK254), or across the rows (A1,B1,C1. . .BK254). 
If you look at cell A12 in our simple interest calculation, you'll 
see the formula -I- All -I- Bll. By entering the command /GOR, 
we have made certain that VisiCalc will compute across row 11 
before computing row 12. Any change in All or Bll will be 
completed before calculations start in A12. 

Let's think about what happens when we change to calcu- 
lating by columns (/GOC). VisiCalc calculates down the 
columns. It will calculate all of column A before calculating 
column B. In cell A12 there is a reference to All and Bll. 

If VisiCalc is calculating by columns, it will figure both All 
and A12 before it gets to Bll. If there's a change that affects 
the value of Bll, the formula -I-AIH-BII in cell A12 won't see 
the result of that change until the next time VisiCalc recalcu- 
lates. This situation is called a forward reference. 

In the situation just described, the value that the formula in 
A12 returns will be wrong until the next recalculation. Any 
other formula that uses the value in A12 will also be wrong un- 
til the next recalculation. Enter /GOC and change either the in- 
terest rate (now .0575) or the principal (now 1000) and see the 
result. The numbers change and all seems fine, doesn't it? If 
you press !, you will manually cause VisiCalc to recalculate. 
Try it, and you'll see that in this model, it takes six presses of 
the ! key to ensure that all the numbers are accurate. 

There is another type of reference whose result is even 
more interesting. A circular reference does exactly what the 
name implies— it goes in circles. Enter >A50 RETURN to 
move to a clear area of the spreadsheet. At that cell, enter 
-I-B50-I-10, and at B50, enter +A50-(-10. 

Can you see what is going to happen? Every time you press 
! or enter a number somewhere else in the spreadsheet, these 
two numbers will change. Press ! a few times and watch the 
results. At every recalculation, each cell is taking the value in 
the opposite cell and adding 10 to it. This will continue indefi- 
nitely; the display on the screen will eventually show a series 
of > symbols, meaning that there are more digits in the value 
than spaces in the cell to display them. Any other cell that 
looks at these two cells will still use the value currently com- 
puted in the cell. You can see that this type of problem is to be 
avoided at all costs. 

Remember, always test new models by pressing the ! key a 
few times with /GOC and /GOR, to determine which recalcu- 
lation order works best and to check that you don't have any 
circular references. 

/S# and /SQ. One note before we quit (/SQ) . In VisiCalc, the 
# is the symbol for data interchange. This column will be a fo- 
cal point for many ideas and applications on many products. In 
future columns, we will look at a number of different applica- 
tion templates, as well as discussing specific methods or algo- 
rithms for accomplishing different tasks. 

That is our part of the data interchange (/S#) . We need data

As several readers of this column noted, the description of 
the IRA model In February's Ventures with VislCalc had a few 
errors. The format at cell B8, where the interest rate per com- 
pounding period was displayed, should have been /FR; in dol- 
lar format the cell read 0.00. For neatness and consistency, B2 
should also have been in flush right. 

More seriously, the Instruction, on page 29, to perform a 
/R:A14.A66:NNRN should have read, "With the cursor still at 
B13, type /R;B13.B56:NNRN. . .". Our apologies for the confu- 
sion this must have created. 

One reader suggested that for the sake of accuracy the 
number of compounding periods per year should have been en- 
tered as 365.25 Instead of 366; It turns out that change made a

difference of about $21 to the future value of the investment at 
a forty-four-year term. 

A number of readers accepted our challenge to discover a 
simpler means of calculating the futiire value of the invest- 
ment assuming a constant annual flow of deposits. Some of the 
solutions were quite ingenious; a number of them provided 
valuable additional information to the model. 

Jon Ruppert, W. J. Friesen, John Howsam, Samuel Abram- 
son, Shirley Fisher, David Scannell, and Dan Moore sug- 
gested the following procedure : use column C to generate a 
running sum of the values in column B. To do this, first elimi- 
nate everytliing to the right of column B in the model as we de- 
scribed it. Second, enter @SUM(B12.B13) at C13. Then repli- 
cate that formula with /R:C14.C86:NR. The whole model thus 
fits into 4K. 

Wolfgang Gunther offered an even more compact model, 
shown in figure 1. And Richard Moy showed how to accom- 
plish the same results with an ingenious mix of forward, back- 
ward, and circular references. His model, shown in figure 2, 
requires that you first enter a 0 at line 8. Then enter a 1 at that 
cell and hit ! . Each time you recalculate, the model will incre- 
ment the term of the account and calculate the future value. 
When the model is reloaded from disk, you'll need to blank out 
B5 through B7 and then reenter the formulas. The easiest way 
to do that is to replicate the three cells, then delete them, then 
replicate them back into B6 through B7. Try it; you'll like it.

Everyone's Guide to Assembly 

Language, Part 19 

Shortly before running out of space last month, we were dis- 
cussing hl-res graphics and how to plot a bouncing hi-res ball. 
We had constructed a simple Applesoft program to illustrate 

the principles involved: 

10 HGR 

20 X=140:Y=80 

30 XV=1:YV=1 

100 REM DRAW LOOP 

no HCOLOR = 3:REM WHITE 

120 HPLOT X,Y:REM DRAW OBJECT 

130 HCOLOR = 0:REM BLACK 

140 HPLOT XJiREM ERASE IT 

200 REM MAKE IT MOVE I 

210 X = X + XV:Y = Y + YV 

220 IF X > 278 THEN XV = XV ♦ (-1) 

230 IF X < 1 THEN XV = XV * (-1) 

240 IF Y > 158 THEN YV = YV * (-1) 

250 IF Y < 1 THEN YV = YV ♦ (-1) 

260 GOTO 100 

Note that this loop has a basic pattern of: draw -> erase -> 
calculate -> test -> (do it again . . .)• 

For the Applesoft program shown, this works fairly well, 
and is very understandable. There is one problem, however. 
That is the fact that very little time passes between the draw 
and erase stages, compared to the amount of time spent in the 
calculate and test sections. The result on the screen is a large 
amount of flicker, resulting from the dot spending more of its 
time black than white. 

One solution to this is to make a small modification to the 
original Applesoft program, so that it appears as follows: 

0 REM FP DOT DEMO PROGRAM 

10 HGR 

15 HCOLOR =3: HPLOT 0,0 TO 279,0 TO 279,159 TO 0,159 TO 0,0 

20 X = 140: Y = 80 

30 XV = 1 : YV = 1 

100 REM CALC NEW POSN 

110 TX = X + XV: TY = Y + XY 

200 REM CHECK POSN 

210 IF TX > 277 THEN XV = XV ♦ (-1) i GOTO 110 

220 IF TX < 2 THEN XV = XV ♦ (-1) i GOTO 110 

230 IF TY > 157 THEN YV = YV * (-1) : GOTO 110 

240 IF TY < 2 THEN YV = YV * (-1) = GOTO 110 

300 REM ERASE OLD POSN 
310 HCOLOR = 0: REM BLACK 
320 HPLOT X,Y 

400 REM DRAW NEW POSN 

410 X = TX: Y = TY 

420 HCOLOR = 3: REM WHITE 

430 HPLOT X,Y 

440 GOTO 100 



This routine not only draws a nice border around the 
screen, but also follows this general pattern: calculate -> 



check -> erase old -> draw new -> (start over). 

The advantage of this technique is that relatively little time 
is spent between the erase and redraw stages. Thus the dot is 
on the screen the majority of the time, and very little flicker is 
apparent. 

Another new detail is the use of a set of temporary vari- 
ables, TX and TY. These store the new position while the old 
one is being erased. The new one is then drawn and TX.TY are 
made "official" by being passed to the "real" X,Y variables. 

As a minor point, also note that we have reduced the bound- 
ary test points in lines 200-240 so that the dot reverses direc- 
tion before actually contacting the boimdary we have drawn. 
Otherwise, the boundary would be erased by the dot passing 
through it on each bounce. 

Now let's look at how to implement this program in ma- 
chine language. 

Signed Binary Numbers. A critical part in the Applesoft 
listing shown here is the ability to add a negative value to the 
speed factor of the object. So far in this series, we have only 
discussed how to represent whole numbers greater or equal to 
zero, using one or two bytes. A reasonable question then is, 
"How do we represent negative numbers?" 

Negative numbers can be thought of as a way of handling 
certain common arithmetic possibilities, such as when sub- 
tracting a larger number from a smaller one, as in 3 - 8 = -2, 
and when adding a positive number to a negative number to 
obtain a given result, as in 8 -I- -8 = -3. 

To be successful then, what we must come up with is a sys- 
tem using the eight bits in each byte that will be consistent with 
the signed arithmetic we are currently familiar with. 

The Sign Bit. The most immediate solution to the question 
of signed numbers is to use bit 7 to indicate whether a nxmiber 
is positive or negative. If the bit is clear, the number is posi- 
tive. If the bit is set, the number will be regarded as negative. 

Thus positive 8 would be represented as 00000101, while -6 
would be shown as 10000101. 

Note that by sacrificing bit 7 to show the sign, we've lim- 
ited ourselves to values from -127 to -1-127. When using two 
bytes to represent a number — such as an address — ^we'U be 
limited to the range of -32,767 to -1-32,767. Sound familiar? If 
you've had any experience with Integer Basic, then you'll rec- 
ognize this as the maximum range of number values within 
that language. 

Although this new scheme is very pleasing in terms of sim- 
plicity, it does have one minor drawback — ^it doesn't work. If 
we attempt to add a positive and negative number using this 
scheme we get disturbing results : 



5 00000101 
+ -8 10001000 



-3 10001101 = -131 

Although we should get -3 as the result, using our signed bit 
system we get -13. Tsk, tsk. There must be a better way. Well, 
with the help of what is essentially a little numeric magic, we 
can get something that works, although some of the concep- 
tual simplicity gets lost in the process. 

What we'll invoke is the idea of number complements. The

V Professionol proofreading 

1 on the APPLE II Computer 
\S\ is how o reolity 





THE APPLE SPELLER fills the void 
that has consistently kept the large 
variety of excellent word processing 
packages for the Apple II Computer 
from approaching the power of a 
dedicated work processor. Finally, 
the first professional quality spelling 
verification program is available for 
the Apple II. The Apple Speller will 
certainly be the standard against 
which all other similar programs are 
compared. 

The Apple Speller interfaces to the 
most popular Apple word processors, 
including Applewriter, Apple Pie, 
Executive Secretary, Letter Perfect, 
Magic Window, and Superscribe II, 
just to name a few. In fact, The Apple 
Speller can analyze the output of any 
editor that writes a standard Apple 
binary or text file to a diskette. In 
addition to this flexibility, the per- 
formance of The Apple Speller will 
astound the microcomputer world. 

The Apple Speller is supplied with 
a 30,000+ word dictionary on a 
single 5 V4" diskette with additional 
space to easily add another 8,000 
words to suit your individual needs. 



The Apple Speller has built-in utilities 
to maintain the dictionary diskette. 
You can readily add words, delete 
words, and create an unlimited num- 
ber of modified and/or new diction- 
aries for specific application. 

The Apple Speller is unbelievably 
fast. The first pass reads your docu- 
ment and collects all the words it 
contains at a rate of 5,000 words 
per minute. Next, the words are 
compared to the dictionary for spell- 
ing errors at the incredible speed of 
50,000 words per minute. Finally, all 
misspelled words are marked as 
such in your document with a rate 
of 1,000 words per minute. This 
translates to proofreading a 10 page 
document in 1 minute if there are no 
spelling mistakes and 2 minutes, 15 
seconds for an unlimited number of 
spelling errors. 

Numerous options are provided 
throughout the program to enable 
you to completely control all activi- 
ties of The Apple Speller. These 
include the ability to ignore both 
control codes and formatting com- 
mands, an alphabetical listing of 



either mispelled words or all the 
words in your document along with 
usage frequencies, multiple options 
for the action taken with each 
misspelled word, and much, much 
more! A verification mode is pro- 
vided to allow you to examine and 
dispense with misspelled words 
while viewing them in the actual 
context in which they appeared in 
your file. 

The Apple SpelJer requires an 
Apple ll/Apple 11 + equipped with 48K, 
DOS 3.3, and 1 or 2 disk drives. Two 
disk drives are required to delete or 
add words to the dictionary. 

The Apple Speller is being intro- 
duced at the incredible price of

simplest complement Is what is called a one's complement. 
The one's complement of a number is obtained by reversing 
each 1 and 0 throughout the original binary number. 
For example, the one's complement to 5 would be: 

00000101 = 5 
11111010 = -5 

For 8, it would be : 

00001000 = 8 
11110111 = -8 

This process is essentially one of definition, that is to say 
that we declare to the world that 11110111 will now represent 
-8 without specifically trying to justify it. Undoubtedly there 
are lovely mathematical proofs of such things that present 
marvelous ways of spending an afternoon, but for our pur- 
pose, a general notion of what the terms mean will be suffi- 
cient. Fortunately computers are very good at following arbi- 
trary numbering schemes without asking, "But why is it that 
way?" 

Now let's see if we're any closer to a working system: 



5 
-8 



00000101 
11110111 



-3 



11111100 = -3 
(00000011 = +3) 



Hmmm, . . . Seems to work pretty good. Let's try another: 



-5 
8 



11111010 
00001000 



00000010 = 2 
(plus carry) 



Well our answers will be right half the time. ... It turns out 
there is a final solution, and that is to use what is called the 
two's complement system. 

The only difference between this and the one's complement 
system is that after deriving the negative number by revers- 
ing each bit of its corresponding positive number, we add one. 

Sounds mysterious. Let's see how it looks: 



For -5: 

5 = 00000101 



11111010 



-5 = 11111011 



For -8: 

8 = 00001000 

one's complement 

11110111 

now add 1 

-8 = 11111000 



Now let's try the two earlier operations: 



5 
-8 



-3 

sample number: 
one's complement: 



two's complement: 

-5 
+ 8 



00000101 
11111000 

11111101 = -3 
(00000011 = 3) 
(11111100 ) 

( +1 ) 

(11111101 = -3) 
11111011 
00001000 

00000011 = 3 
plus carry 



At last! It works in both cases. It turns out that two's com- 
plement math works in all cases, with the carry being ignored 
on one-byte additions. 

Taking the Opposite of a Signed Number. All that we need 
now is a routine that will produce the opposite of a number 
given it, that is produce the two's complement of a positive 
number and also the positive version when given a negative 
value. To do this, we'll use the EOR command. 

EOR is useful in creating a routine to convert between 
signed numbers because of its ability to reverse all the bits in a 
given bj^e. The conversion is done with two individual rou- 
tines. In the examples below, the routines convert a constant 
value, #$34, back and forth. In a working version, the value 
would be passed via a register or a memory location, as will be 
shown later.

When you run this routine, notice how much faster it executes 
and how the speed of the dot can be varied using paddle 0. 

This routine essentially parallels the Applesoft routine 
shown earlier. Lines 24-50 clear the hi-res screen and draw the 
box around the screen. Ldnes 51-55 set the velocity components 
to '1'; lines 57-61 position the hi-res cursor in the center of the 
screen. This also conveniently loads $E0-E2 with the desired x 
and y coordinates of the dot. Remember that $E0/E1 and $E2 
are the zero page locations used by the Applesoft hi-res rou- 
tines for the X and y coordinates of its cursor. 

Lines 62-73 calculate the new position of the dot by adding 
the respective velocity components to the x and y coordinates. 
Lines 75-98 check to see if this new position is still within the 
specified screen boundaries. If it has reached the edge, the ap- 
propriate velocity components are reversed for the next gfo- 
rovind's calculation. 

Line 100 starts the erasing of the current dot position, im- 
mediately followed by a drawing of the new position. Note that 
the equivalent of the X=TX:Y=TY statement is apparently 
missing. In actuality, it is automatically accomplished by the 
JSR HPLOT on line 112. Remember that the contents of the Ac- 
cumulator, X and Y registers are automatically assigned to 
$E0-E2 by HPLOT. Line 114 does a short delay by getting a 
value from paddle 0 to be used by the WATT ($FCA8) routine. 
After the delay, a JMP CALC restarts the entire process. 



MONEY BUSINESS 



Beat the I.R.S. 



You'd always pay the minimum Federal income tax if you 
had the knowledge and time to examine 120 tax return 
options. Well, now you can do it, with Datamost's TAX 
BEATER. 

Written by an I.R.S. Enrolled Agent, with 24 years of 
financial and tax planning experience, the TAX BEATER 
automatically evaluates up to 120 return options from 
your input. It searches and finds the best tax path for 
you . . . displaying up to 15, and ready to print out the 
optimum method so you pay the minimum! 

The TAX BEATER can handle it all. From income averag- 
ing to loss carryovers to 
dividends, alimony, 
pension to special 
exclusions. It's 
perfect for the 
average tax- 
payer . . . indis- i 
pensable for \ 
thefinancial 
professional. It's 
so complete, so 
logical that, es- 
pecially in this in- 
terim year of un- 
usual tax revisions, 
it can easily pay for 
itself many times 
over. Be ready for the 
I.R.S. . . . with TAX 
BEATER, the program 
that's updated for the 
1981 tax laws!

Beat the Real Estate game 

Real Estate has always been the major wealth-builder. 
In fact, more millionaire dynasties owe their creation to 
investments in real estate than anything else. And, it 
doesn't matter . . . boom times or bust . . . inflation or 
deflation . . . the knowing investor can make money, even 
create an empire! 

But, the key to real estate success is accurate analysis of 
opportunities, knowledge of cash flows, return on invest- 
ment, current and future profitability, tax consequences 
and other interrelated information — all needed, all 
necessary to making the right decision. 

And that's what REAP (Real 
Estate Analysis Pro- 
gram) is all about. It 
takes your input, 
probes for the 
right informa- 
tion, scrutinizes 
the data, the 
opportunities . . . 
and automati- 
cally delivers the 
facts . . . showing 
you the possibilities 
and why one situa- 
tion may be superior 
to another. In short, 
REAP can help you 
reap bigger profits. 
That's why REAP is the 
program for any inves- 
tor ... a must program 
for the sophisticated 
investor. Don't option, 
commit, invest or buy 
without it . . . whether you 
just want to make good 
money or create a suc- 
cessful real estate empire!

Lines 126-166 are applications of the sign reversal routines 
shown last month. Notice that RVRSY Is a one-byte reversal, 
while RVRSX illustrates the reversal of a two-byte value. Simi- 
larly, CALC shows that the same addition routine is used for 
both signed binary (our current condition) and unsigned bi- 
nary (as in previous articles) . 

Table-Driven Graphics. For graphics of any complexity— 
anything Involving more than one dot— a little improvement on 
this routine is needed. One of the most common ways of doing 
this is to use a table of all the current points on the screen, and 
their corresponding velocities. Motion is then managed by se- 
quentially scanning through the table and using the entire cal- 
culation, check and erase /plot section as a subroutine. 

To convert the routine presented earlier, make the follow- 
ing changes to the source code (the hex data from the assem- 
bly is included to assist in error checking) : 

1) Add these lines to the end of the Usting (new line num- 



bers shown)

Run this routine from the Monitor with a 6000G or from Ap- 
plesoft with a call 24576. If calling from the Monitor, make sure 
you have entered the Monitor from Applesoft when you do the 
call -151 to assure that the Applesoft ROM or RAM card bank 
is selected. Note that although the entire routine is in machine 
language, it does require the presence of the Applesoft hi-res 
routines in the $D000-F7FF range. 

By using paddle 0 you can vary the speed of execution con- 
siderably. One drawback of using the WAIT routine is that 0 
will be just as slow as 255 when adjusting the paddle. Other- 
vdse, it should behave quite nicely. 

To speed things up further, NOP out the JSR to WAIT on 
line 187. An even gfreater speed increase is achieved by simi- 
larly disabling the JSR PREAD on line 185, although with 
PREAD gone there is no longer any control over the speed. 
This wrill, however, give you an idea of the maximum speed 
possible for the five dots using standard Applesoft hi-res 
routines. 

The main points to note in the new listing are the JSR to 
SETUP on line 32, the LOOKUP section on lines 68-128, and the 
table generator at the end on lines 241-263. 

SETUP creates a data table starting at location $1000 that 
contains a number of eight-byte blocks, each of which contains 
the necessary information for a given dot. The block is made 
up of two four-byte subunits. The first four bj^tes give the loca- 
tion data for the x and y coordinates. Notice that the fourth 
byte is not used. Space in the table could have been saved by 
omitting this byte, but the eight byte length per entry allows us 
to use a few simple ASLs, as will be explained momentarily.

The Most Popular Program of 1981 

RASTER BLASTER! 



In a landslide vote that overwhelmed the other competi- 
tors, much as VisiCalc stands in a class by itself each month on 
the Top Thirty, Raster Blaster was elected by Softalk'a read- 
ers as the most popular software program for the Apple com- 
puter for 1981. 

Anyone who didn't think Bill Budge's piece de resistance 
would place high hasn't been paying attention to the Apple 
market of late. But the margin of victory startled even the poll 
monitors, who halfway through the tabulation were predict- 
ing a head-to-head battle between Apple Panic and Olympic 
Decathlon. 

While the monitors weren't looking. Cattle Wolfenstein 
snuck into second place with Apple Panic third and Olympic 
Decathlon fourth. 

That Raster Blaster is the overwhelming choice of Apple 
users is indicated by the fact that it was mentioned on 113 more 
ballots than was Apple Panic, which received the second most 
raw votes. 



Votes were tabulated on a weighted basis. Each elector 
could name as many as ten programs in order. The votes were 
then weighted ten points for a first place mention, nine for a 
second place nod, and so on down to one point for a tenth place 
vote. 

In the matter of the number of raw votes received, Raster 
Blaster and Apple Panic were trailed by Gorgon, the fifth 
place finisher overall; Alien Rain, the sixth place program; 
Space Eggs, the ninth place disk, and Olympic Decathlon tied; 
Castle Wolfenstein; and Snaggle. 

Programs generally getting their first big marketing push 
during November and December of 1980 and all of 1981 were 
eligible for election. Questionable areas were resolved in fa- 
vor of the program, so that DB Master, Personal Filing Sys- 
tem, and Magic Window— all released prior to November 1980, 
but not truly in general release — were admitted to the rolls, 
while such progfranis as VisiCalc, VisiFile, Supertext II, and 
Data Factory, which underwent extensive revisions but had 



164 



APRIL 1982 



much longer marketing postures, were omitted from final con- 
sideration. 

Even though VisiCalc was excluded from the list of eligible 
programs, it garnered sufficient mentions that it would have 
placed sixteenth, and the probability that it would have con- 
tended seriously with Raster Blaster for first place had Apple 
users been free to include it is indicated by examining the 
weighted averages. 

The weighted average indicates the strength of feeling of 
the user base for a particular prog^ram. Clearly 10 was the 
highest possible score, with an)^hing over 7 indicating that the 
program significantly enhanced the library of the user. 

In the top one hundred programs, only fourteen managed 
averages higher than 7, and only three of those were games. 
Weighted averages can be looked at as an indication of most 
valuable, although the fact that many of the most useful pro- 
grams were not eligible for this year's balloting puts such as- 
sumptions on shaky terrain. 

The surprising leader in weighted averages was High Tech- 
nology's Information Master, which snared an 8.88 rating. Fol- 
lowing were Wizardry, its 8.49 rating testifying to the way it's 
catching on throughout the country; Executive Secretary, 
8.38; Nibbles Away, 8.25; Data Factory, 7.91; WordStar, 7.86; 
Z-Term, 7.78; Zork II, 7.73; VisiCalc, 7.73; DB Master, 7.37; 
Magic Window, 7.34; Castle Wolfenstein, 7.29; Locksmith, 7.27; 
and VisiFile, 7.00. 

In contrast, Raster Blaster obtained a weighted average of 
6.21. 

The results are tabulated in the same format as the Best- 
sellers, with breakouts for each category customarily treated 
individually in that section. 

In addition, there's a list of all programs that received first 
place ballots. This list may serve as a priority shopping guide, 
in that at least one member of the Apple community recom- 
mends it highly.

four programs in the Top Thirty, Nasir's two and Sneakers 
achieving the top ten. Broderbund and Muse each placed three 
programs in the Top Thirty and Apple itself had two pro- 
grams. 

In addition to VisiCalc's projection of sixteenth had it been 
eUgible, three other oldtimers placed higher than those listed. 
Super Disk Copy would have been eighteenth ; Program Line 
Editor and Supertext II also placed ahead of Superscribe II. 

The breadth of the Apple market is indicated by the fact 
that 386 different programs received votes.

No older progranis managed to crack the Fantasy 6, where 
Wizardry held forth, followed by Ultima, Hel\fire Warrior, 
Akalabeth, and Dragon Fire. 

Afl with each month's poll, the Word Processors 5 list saw 
heated competition. Magic Window received the highest vote 
count, followed by WordStar, Superscribe II, Executive Secre- 
tary, and The Correspondent. If older programs had been al- 
lowed, Supertext II would have been second, Apple PIE and 
Apple Writer would have followed Superscribe, and Letter 
Perfect, Easy Writer, Apple Writer III, Word Handler, and 
Magic Wand all received staunch support. 

With VisiCalc disqualified from consideration, DB Master 
reigned in the Business 10 list. Personal Filing System was sec- 
ond, followed by VisiTrend/VisiPlot, BPI General Ledger, 
VisiDex, VisiPlot, BPI Accounts Receivable, Data Reporter, 
PFS: Report, and Datadex. 

A caveat here, of course, is that many of the truly fine busi- 
ness products were ineligible for inclusion in the list of first- 
year software. VisiCalc would have been third; Data Factory, 
Information Master, and VisiFile would have followed Visi- 
Plot, and Apple Plot would have followed Data Reporter. 

Apple Computer had a lock on the Hobby 10 with DOS 5.3 in 
first and DOS Tool Kit in second. Locksmith was third, fol-

will have to program another one." JM 



SDS Presents "The Professional" Series 



For the first time ever, three packages 
encompassing all major Apple 
operating systems: 

• ASCII Express "The ProfessionalVM 
for Apple DOS 

• P-Term "The ProfessionalVM for Apple 
Pascal 

• Z-Term "The Professional™ for Apple 
CP/M 

FORGET EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER 
HEARD ABOUT COMMUNICATIONS 
SOFTWARE. 

SDS now offers three new 
communication packages like no 
others on the market today. These 
packages are designed to operate 
alike, to look alike, and to be 
completely conversive with each other. 
An operator familiar with any one of 
these packages can easily operate the 
other two with minimal instruction. 
Absolutely no other packages can 
equal these outstanding features: 

• All three packages are totally 
conversive with each other. ANY 
type of file may be transferred 
completely error-free within these or 
compatible systems utilizing the 
Christensen Protocol. 

• Transfers may also include any 
ASCII based dial-up host computer. 
These flexible transfer capabilities 
are made possible by a wide variety 
of send options unique to SDS 
software. 

• Support of ALL Apple-compatible 
modems and ALL display systems 
including any 80-column board or 
external terminal; 40-column too. 

• Terminal emulation — allows your 
80-column board or external terminal 
to "emulate" screen control codes 



of other terminals. Ideal for screen- 
oriented editors or data bases. 

• Fully unattended answer mode 
features password only access and 
error-free transfer of files, as well as 
standard ASCII transfer modes. 

• All packages support up to 1200 
baud. Z-Term and ASCII Express 
support up to 4800 baud when 
interrupt-driven. 

• Greatly enhanced macro system 
now includes programmable "hand 
shaking" macros — entire log-on 
sequences may be automatically 
executed. Also, many internal 
program commands may be initiated 
from macro control. Multiple macro 
libraries may be stored for use with 
a variety of hosts. 

A NEW STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE 

"The Professional" series is so 
innovative and superior to other 
packages in the field that it is truly in 
a class by itself. Our comparison chart 
gives a detailed point-by-point analysis 
of these and other communication 
packages. Write for it. You'll be 
convinced — when it comes to 
communication software, SDS stands 
alone.

LOOKUP basically does three things. First it retrieves the 
data for a dot, and puts it in the current X,Y,XV,YV bytes. Sec- 
ond, it feeds these to the calculate/plot routine. Third, when 



CALC/PLOT returns, the new location and velocity values are 
stored back in the table. 

Examining the code starting at GET, you can see CTR is 
used to keep track of which dot we're currently processing. 
This is multiplied by 8 to get the base address of the data for 
that dot. Remember that ASL can be used to multiply easily by 
a power of two, depending on the number of ASLs you use. 
Each ASL is equivalent to multiplying by 2. 

Once the base address offset is determined, this is put in the 
X register and the data retrieved via a series of LDA/STA 
operations. 

After returning from CALC/PLOT, the process is reversed 
to store the new data. 

Wrapping It Up. Hi-res is an involved topic, and it's chal- 
lenging to try to present the right mix of clarity and in-depth 
explanation. My goal is to present enough of the basics to give 
you the springboard to pursue your own interests. 

In general, the principles provided in this, and last month's 
article are the foundation of most animated graphics pro- 
grams. Tables are especially worth your consideration as they 
provide a straightforward way of managing a larger number 
of screen points. 

By now it should also be evident that even in machine lan- 
guage, the Applesoft routines themselves are still the most re- 
straining portion in terms of speed and execution. In all fair- 
ness to Applesoft though, realize that their speed is sacrificed 
for simplicity and convenience of operation. 

Next month's topic will be the layout of the hi-res screen it- 
self, and how certain dedicated routines can be created to get a 
little more out of the ol' Apple. 

See you then! Hi 



Why you need The Inspector. 



If you're serious about programming, you need 
to set aJl your utilities together in one place — 
inside your Apple. The Inspector comes on an 
Eprom that simply plugs into the D8 socket, or on 
a disk ready to merge with Integer Basic for 
automatic loading on boot. Either way, it stays at 
your fingertips, ready to call without disturbing 
your current program. 

The Inspector puts you in total control of both 
memory and disks. You can search forward 
and backwards, edit, read nibbles, 
map disk space, dump the screen 
to a printer, examine every secret 
of your ^ple. Use The Inspector 
to repair blown disks, undelete 
files, input "illegal" commands. 




read and alter files, locate strings in memory or on 
disk. The uses are endless. The manual, alone, is an 
education. And it's always there when you need it. 

You need the most powerful disk and memory 
utility available for your Apple. You need the 
Inspector.

Maple Sugar and Apples:

BV DAVID DURKEE 

When computers first became available for use in schools 
and other educational settingfs, a new field in education was 
bom: Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI). At first CAI was 
met with the kind of hi-tech enthusiasm that many new de- 
velopments in computer applications enjoy, but after a while, 
once the novelty wore off, the enthusiasm waned. 

One survivor from this period is the Plato system based in 
Minnesota. This is a time-sharing system wiUi an extensive 
bank of courseware (educational software) . Plato is accessed 
by smart terminals over telephone lines, and while the variety 
of courseware available makes the system a useful educa- 
tional tool, the cost of long-distance phone calls at day rates 
makes it prohibitively expensive for most potential users. 

Getting It To The People. Since the advent of the microcom- 
puter there has been a second wave of research in CAI. Micro- 
computers are within the range of even an elementary school's 
budget, and some commercial courseware is available. 

Mary Wilson and Bernard Fox of the University of Ver- 
mont are pioneers in the development of microcomputer 
courseware for special education. Both are speech-language 
pathologists in the Department of Communication Science and 
Disorders at the University of Vermont, trained to help people 
who have problems in using and understanding language. Al- 
though millions of people have such problems. Dr. Wilson ob-

A Yummy Way to Learn 



served in 1979 — ^the beginning of the microcomputer boom — 
that these people's needs were not being addressed by the new 
developments in CAI. "We wanted to see that the handicapped 
were included rather than excluded from the microcomputer 
revolution," Wilson says now when describing the thrust of 
their work. 

She and Pox, who had previous computer experience, set 
out to address this need. Their first major step was to acquire 
an Apple n with university funding. Wilson recalls, "When we 
first began developing audible microcomputer courseware, 
our colleagues questioned whether young children would even 
interact with the computer, so we designed a study to address 
this question." 

For purposes of this study, they designed a Receptive Lan- 
guage and Syntax Testing and Training program. Although not 
a fully developed piece of courseware, the program contained 
many of the elements of one. It used a two-step process to 
teach the prepositions "in" and "on," and to test for compre- 
hension of those prepositions and "under," which was used as 
a control variable. It taught with a bombardment technique 
and tested with a feedback technique. 

As Dr. Wilson explains it, a normal child can pick up the 
correct use of these and other constructions by the examples 
provided in normal conversation. The bombardment tech- 
nique is more like formal drilling: "The ball is under the table. 
Look at the ball under the table. See the ball under the table?" 
The repetition helps clarify the relationships to handicapped

letirners. The testing phase actually teaches through feedback 
as well; when an Incorrect answer is given, the system cor- 
rects it immediately and tells the student the right answer. 

To be effective, this program relies upon both visual and 
aural components. Obviously students with these kinds of 
leeiming difficulties cannot read text on the computer screen, 
so a Mountain Hardware Supertalker was called into play. The 
Supertalker digitizes sounds, stores them in binary memory, 
and "speaks" in a voice that resembles a human one. A visual 
component was created using an Apple Graphics Tablet and a 
machine language routine that takes a rectangular subsection 
of the graphics screen and moves it to any other screen loca- 
tion. The routine was developed by Leslie Smith, then a senior 
in UVM's Computer Science department. 

In the program, the hi-res screen takes the place of picture 
flash cards. Three pictures, each showing the same two ob- 
jects in different configurations, appear on the screen and the 
voice says, "Show me the ball on the box." The learner re- 
sponds by pressing one of three buttons on a special board con- 
nected to the Apple's I/O port. If the child answers correctly, a 
clown appears on the screen, claps its hands, and says 
"Good!" If the child's answer is wrong, the correct answer is 
indicated and the question is repeated. 

The findings of this research indicated that handicapped 
students would indeed interact with the computer. In fact, all 
but one of the children participating in the test preferred the 
computer test over the flash card version. In November of 
1980, Wilson and Fox presented the program as the focus of a 
scientific exhibit at a convention of the American Speech Emd 
Hearing Association. In ASHA's national competition, the ex- 
hibit took first prize for excellence of presentation and second 
for scientific merit. 

By winter of 1981 Wilson and Fox were ready to share what 
they had learned about CAI for the handicapped, and to put 
some of its principles to actual use. They submitted proposals 
for two related projects: the first, submitted to UVM's Living 



Learning Center was called the courseware challenge ; the sec- 
ond, submitted to United Cerebral Palsy of Vermont, was a 
telecommunications project. Both proposals were accepted. 

Design for Learning. The Living Learning Center is an edu- 
cational and residential environment in which undergrad- 
uates live together in programs. Each program is designed to 
teach a particular subject in a way that may or may not in- 
clude lectures. Programs usually feature non-classroom learn- 
ing; such learning may take the form of group or individual 
projects, discussions, field trips or other events. 

The Center currently houses faculty and student designed 
programs on theatre, unspoken language, parapsychology, 
emergency medicine, Irish studies and holography. The 
Courseware Challenge proposed to teach the history and tech- 
niques of CAI to a group of UVM students with a variety of aca- 
demic backgrounds. 

When the Courseware Challenge program got off the 
ground this fall, ten men and women were enrolled. The stu- 
dents live in two suites; Apples, printers, disk drives, modems 
and other peripherals, including a graphics tablet, the Super- 
talker, and the Echo II reside nearby in a two-room office. Stu- 
dents in this progfram learn firsthand about CAI and help write 
and modify programs for Wilson and Fox's projects. 

The Spice of Life. Wilson and Fox wanted their students to 
be a productive part of the courseware development process. 
They value varied background and imagination as much as 
they do computer expertise, so they selected program mem- 
bers with such varied majors as electrical engineering, com- 
puter science, education and communication science and 
disorders. 

The projects the students are working on are as varied as 
their majors. Mark Biamonte is working on a touch-sensitive 
overlay for the computer screen designed to interface with the 
Apple and tell it where a user is pointing. By relating that to 
what is displayed on the screen, the computer would be able to 
accept simple pointing as input.

A Programming Course For Beginners 



What is the best way to learn 
how to use an APPLE® com- 
puter? 

You could enroll in a class — 
arranged at someone else's con- 
venience, given by a technician 
who may not be a very good 
teacher. Or you could read a 
book — written by a program- 
mer who may not be a very 
good writer. Or you could learn 
in your own home, on your own 
APPLE®, at your own conven- 
ience, using the course that has 
become a standard ot the indus- 
try. 

Introducing 

THE NEW STEP BY STEP, 

a programming course for 

beginners 

In 1978, PDI introduced the 
original Step by Step. The stu- 
dent learned by interacting 
with his or her computer. Thou- 
sands of students learned how 
to use an APPLE® computer 
and the Applesoft® language 
with Step by Step. Now, using 
feedback from students, 
teachers and learning special- 
ists, we are introducing The 
New Step by Step. 

The New Step by Step, in 
addition to sound and ettective 
teaching, includes computer 
graphics, animation, sound 
effects and a voice track. 

How does 

THE NEW STEP BY STEP 
woric? 

The computer program 
shows screen displays 
or sample program 
outputs, while the 
audio cassette explains 
to the student what is 
being shown. After each 
instructional segment, 
the student is asked a 
question or asked to solve 
a problem. The computer 
checks the student's work. 

When a lesson has been com- 
pleted, the student turns off the 
cassette and goes to the Step by 
Step Workbook to review and 




practice the material covered in 
the lesson. Alter the practice as- 
signment has been completed, 
the student takes a quiz. 

A linal exam is included. 

What does 

THE NEW STEP BY STEP teach? 

There are about twenty hours 
of instruction. Topics covered 
include: 

• PRINT instruction 

• Writing simple programs 



INPUT 
Loops GOTO 
IF-THEN 

Program counters 

Library functions such as 
INT and RND 

Screen formatting, including 
TAB, VTAB and HTAB 

Subroutines 

READ-DATA statements 
FOR-NEXT loops 
One-dimensional arrays 
Nested loops 
Low-resolution graphics 
Multiple-statement lines 
Program logic 
Floating point notation 




How can 

THE NEW STEP BY STEP 
be used? 

Schools can use Step by Step for 
individualized instruction in 
programming in BASIC and in 
computer literacy programs. 

Families can use Step by Step to 
ensure that all family members 
can use the family computer. 

Businesses can use Step by Step 
to train their personnel. 

APPLE® dealers can use Step by 
Step to introduce prospective

Since the first Impuse of many learning-Impaired students 
In answering a question Is to point to the correct picture when 
answering a question, this capability would be quite valuable 
in connection with the syntax training and testing courseware. 
Children have to be taught to equate the buttons with the pic- 
ture. In some cases, children would point to the correct pic- 
ture but press the wrong button. Blamonte plans to use either 
two overlaying sheets of clear plastic with conductors em- 
bedded, or a matrix of Infrared light which would be interrupt- 
ed by the user's hand. Although there are touch-sensitive 
screens available for the Apple, they are very expensive and 
have a much higher resolution than Is necessary for these ap- 
plications. The goal here is to be able to develop a screen suit- 
ed to their special needs for vinder one hundred dollars. 

John Wilson developed a special joystick that enables a stu- 
dent who has poor coordination in her hands to use her elbow 
instead, but some victims of cerebral palsy find even this de- 
vice difficult to use. 

Jamie Gump, another program participant, is planning to 
develop eyes of a kind for the Apple. Using a pair of distance 
sensors of the sort Polaroid uses In their newest cameras, he 
hopes to enable severely handicapped students to use their 
heads in the manner of joysticks. The two distance sensors 
would be aimed at the user's head from different sides to tri- 
angulate on its position. The sensors plug into the paddle cir- 
cuits of the I/O port, making them, in effect, a joystick. In com- 
bination with the necessary interpretive software, such a de- 
vice makes selecting a program from a catalog or an option 
from a menu as easy as moving your head from side to side. 

Other students are involved In creating games. These too 
have a courseware purpose : they are a simple enjoyable way 
to train handicapped users in the motor skills they'll need to 
operate their special interface devices. They can also help 
handicapped users overcome the social barriers Imposed by 
their handicaps. 

Unlocking Communication. The United Cerebral Palsy 
project proposal Involves tutoring people with cerebral palsy at 
home using Apple computers. United Cerebral Palsy provides 
the eight participants with Apples in their homes on a rotating 
basis. 

Tutoring is geared to students' Interests and educational 
levels. Some students are tutored in programming as a voca- 
tional skill; others are tutored in academic subjects using Ap- 
ple Computer's Shell Games. What makes this trilogy of inter- 
active matching, multiple choice, and true/false testing games 
so useful Is that they can be set up with any sort of database an 
instructor wants to use. The database provides space for ques- 
tions, multiple possible answers, and comments on the subject 
to be added after a question has been answered correctly. This 
means Instructors can not only test, but teach. 

Among the cerebral palsy programs that Wilson, Fox, and 
their associates have developed and are developing are pro- 
grams to help the users communicate. Cerebral palsy Is not a 
learning handicap, but it does hinder education by hindering 
communication. Cerebral palsy affects coordination; as a re- 
sult. Individuals' handwriting may be illegible, both to others 
and to themselves. 

Ann Peery, a mother with grown children, just appeared 
one day to join Wilson and Fox's group. Aware that communi- 
cation In writing can be a real problem for people who suffer 
from cerebral pasly, Peery developed a scratch-pad math pro- 
gram for them. 

This program allows students to do math problems in 
"longhand" on the computer screen. It allows them to move over 
to the side to do related problems, or to move up to the top of a 
problem to do a carry or borrow, but it doesn't give them the 
answers; It just provides a legible medium in which students 
can work out problems for themselves. When finished, stu- 
dents can print out problems to hand to the teacher. The 
scratch-pad program goes a long way toward answering some 
educators' criticisms that computers don't help teach math, 
they just give the answers. 

Students in the UCP program also use Apple Writer as a 



communication tool. Apple Writer does for them In English 
what the scratch-pad does in math— it allows them to com- 
municate legibly. It has an advantage over even the best type- 
writer, in that it makes editing simple. Apples do not so much 
teach students to write effectively as allow them to show that 
they can communicate in writing. And both the scratch-pad 
and Apple Writer enable students to do their work much faster. 

Fox is also working on a program to help the speaking dis- 
abled to communicate. He Is constructing a database of words 
with both normal and phonetic spelling, and devising a pro- 
gr&m that can access any word with a few keystrokes. The pro- 
gram builds the words into phrases and sentences, and then 
speaks them with Street Electronics' Bc/io // speech synthe- 
sizer. Fox hopes to put as much of the program as possible un- 
der joystick control. The real challenge, he says, is organizing 
information and instructions on the text screen to make possi- 
ble the easiest and fcustest use. 

Embarrassment of Riches. In addition to their current ac- 
tive projects, Wilson and Fox have some extensive plans for 
the future. One of these plans Is to expand their current work In 
training special educators to use microcomputers as teaching 
devices. They have letters of recommendation from educators 
throughout Vermont that speak out strongly for this need; 
where Vermont was once a state with more cows than people, 
it now seems to have more microcomputers available for spe- 
cial education than it has special educators trained to use them. 
A special education coordinator put it most succinctly: "We 
are equipment rich and training poor." 

The proposal is a three-year plan extending from June of 
1982 through May of 1986, that includes periodic training ses- 
sions, workshops, modules, and full courses, on such subjects 
as the different computers available, available hardware and 
software for those computers, how to adapt commercial hard- 
ware and software to special uses, and special techniques in 
using microcomputers with the handicapped. They also plan to 
provide newsletter updates and phone consultation on a con- 
tinuing basis. 

Another of their proposals is to expand their vocabulary 
and syntax testing and training software from a research pro- 
gram to a fully usable piece of courseware. They have de- 
veloped a character who is more active than the clown in their 
earlier program to give the positive reinforcement to the stu- 
dents. The new character is called the Blob. Making more so- 
phisticated use of hi-res animation techniques that they devel- 
oped in their earlier efforts, the Blob walks, talks, rolls, and 
jumps all over the screen. To make things more interesting, 
the Blob even varies the Intonation of his voice. 

When his database is complete, the Blob will be able to train 
students in prepositions, pronouns, who and what questions, 
verb tenses, and more, for a total of thlrty-fovir different con- 
structions, three hundred different questions, and over one 
thousand high resolution pictures. The program makes full use 
of the Apple's 48K of memory to minimize disk loading time ; a 
memory map shows that only about three hundred bytes re- 
main unused. Fox explains that it is necessary to minimize 
disk I/O time because students lose interest when they are 
kept waiting. 

The Blob currently uses the Supertalker to speak, but they 
would like to convert it to use with the Echo II, which takes up 
much less memory space. The problem is that they are wary 
of teaching children a computer accent. Studies show that chil- 
dren of parents with a heavy foreign accent develop normal 
American Intonations if they are also sufficiently exposed to 
nonaccented speakers. However, no studies have been done to 
show the effects of a computer accent on a developing child. 

Unlimited Potential. In a guest editorial for the American 
Speech and Hearing Association Magazine, Wilson and Fox 
stated, "Today neither technology nor the cost of technology 
stand in the way of developing creative courseware that makes 
learning language as exciting as any arcade computer game of 
Space Invaders. Only our mind's imagination limits us." 

The enthusiasm Inherent in that statement shows in all of 
their work. ^1

BY Don WORTH 
AflD PIETEI^ 

Sector skewing, or Interleaving, Is a 
method by which the time required to ac- 
cess a disk sector can be reduced. When- 
ever you InltiaUze a disk, either by using 
the DOS init command or by using the 
copy program to create a new disk, DOS 
formats each track by arranging the sec- 
tors in a "physical" order. 

In DOS 3.3 this order is sequential, 
from physical sector zero to physical sec- 
tor fifteen. When DOS 3.3 reads a sector it 
translates the physical sector number in- 
to a "logical" sector number using a soft 
skewing table, located in the read/write 
track/sector portion of DOS. Most pro- 
grams and most of DOS refer to sectors 
by their logical sector number. When 
DOS 3.3 was written, the soft skewing 
table was established so that the logical 
order in which sectors were arranged on 
a track could be controlled merely by 
modifying the soft skew table. (Earlier 
versions of DOS set up sector skewing 
when the physical sectors were placed on 
the disk at init or copy time— in fact, un- 
der DOS 3.2 and DOS 3.1, init and copy 
each used a different skew pattern!) Fig- 
ure 1 presents a diagram of the process 
used by DOS 3.3 to reference sectors. 

Going around with a Disk. To under- 
stand skewing, it is enlightening to look 
at the series of events that occurs when- 
ever a sector is read from or written to 
the disk. Figures 2 through 4 describe 
what happens when a program is read 
from a standard DOS disk. To simplify 
this discussion, these three figures show 
the logical sector numbers. In actual 
fact, the physical order is that of figure 1. 

Shown in figure 2 is the standard skew- 
ing for DOS 3.3. There are different skews 
for Pascal/Fortran and CP/M. The 
reason for this should become apparent 
as this discussion proceeds. When DOS 
3.3 was design^ed, a skewing wash was 
chosen that optimizes access during boot- 
ing. Since sector reads occur fairly rapid- 
ly during the boot process and sectors are 
read in reverse order (sector F first, then 
E, then D, and so on), a "2 descending" 
skew was chosen. This means that the 
next lower sector is (nearly) always two 
sectors away from the last one. For 
example, sector 6 is two sectors beyond 
sector 7. Although this standard DOS 
skewing allows disks to boot in at opti- 
mal speed, it's a very poor skewing for 
almost anjrthlng else, such as loading or 
running programs (bload, load, brun, 
run). 

In figure 2, the read/write head is po- 
sitioned where it would be immediately 
after reading Sector F. At this point, con- 
trol returns from RWTS and the file man- 
ager processes the data it has just read, 
determines which sector must be read 
next, and calls RWTS again. 

Missing the Boat. At the same time all 
of this is going on, the disk continues to

spin in the drive. Thus, several sectors 
pass beneath the read/write head before 
the file manager is ready to request 
another read. In the usual case, the file 
manager will want to read the next low- 
est numbered sector on the track (sector 
E, in this case) , and this sector will al- 
ready have passed by. Figure 3 shows the 
position of the disk relative to the 
read/write head when the file manager is 
ready to read sector E. 

Notice that one of the sectors passed 
over was, in fact, sector E. RWTS will 
now read each sector on the disk until it 
again finds sector E. The period of time it 
takes to find the desired sector after the 
read has been requested is referred to as 
the rotational delay for the disk access. 
Figure 4 shows the read/write head in 
position to read sector E and identifies 
the rotational delay. This delay is wasted 
time. 

You may have noticed that, had the 
file manager processed sector F faster 
letting only one sector pass by in the 
meantime, it could have returned to the 
disk in time to read sector E aA it passed

under the read/write head. This Is ap- 
parently what the DOS designers in- 
tended and, in fact, this is what occurs 
during the boot process. The example de- 
scribed, however, was that of a bload 
operation (bload, load, brun, and run 
have similar patterns of behavior, using 
Identical code within DOS) . 

Making Up Time. Obviously, unless 
you spend most of your time booting 
disks, you'd appreciate the reduced rota- 
tional delay for other operations as well. 
One solution would be to change the soft 
skew table in RWTS to a more appropri- 
ate pattern. This works, but It has two 
major disadvantages. One disadvantage 
is that, once this table is changed, any 
disk created using the standard skew 
table is not accessible using the modified 
soft skew table, and vice versa. For ex- 
ample, what standard DOS thinks is sec- 
tor 7, the modified DOS may think is sec- 
tor 5. The second disadvantage is that 
this scheme applies to every track on the 
disk, including the boot image of DOS on 
tracks 0, 1, and 2, making a bload com- 
mand run faster at the expense of the 
time required to boot the disk. 

Luckily, there is another way to deal 
with the problem. Instead of changing 
the soft skew table, the sectors can be 
physically rearranged on the track such 
that, when run through DOS's boot-op- 
timized skew table, they will be in the 
optimal pattern for load and bload. Us- 
ing this method, it's possible to have dif- 
ferent physical arrangements on differ- 
ent tracks. Thus, tracks 3 through 34 can 
be optimized for loading while the boot 
tracks are optimized for booting. Also, 
disks created by physically rearranging 
the sectors may be read by any DOS (of 
the appropriate version). 

It turns out that during a bload opera- 
tion the file manager is "out to lunch" 
processing the previously read sector for 
about the time it takes eight sectors to 
pass beneath the read/write head. Thus a 
"9 descending" skew seems a good 
choice (9 descending provides eight sec- 
tors of padding between descending se- 
quential sectors). Figtire 5 shows the 
logical arrangement of sectors on the 
disk when a 9 descending skew is used. 

Using this new skewing, after the file 
manager has finished processing sector 
F, the read/write head is positioned very 
near to sector E. Flgtire 6 shows the po- 
sition of the disk at this time. The actual 
rotational delay is less than one sector 
long, as shown in figure 7. 

What You Gain. You might ask just 
how significant a contribution rotational 
delay makes to the overall access time of 
a disk sector. Within about a 10 percent 
tolerance, a Disk n spins at three hun- 
dred revolutions per minute. This means 
that every sector on the track passes be- 
neath the read/write head three hun- 
dred times per minute. If rotational de- 
lay amounts to waiting for ten sectors to 
go by before reading the desired sector, 
as in the standard DOS skewing with

bload, and sixteen sectors are read on 
every track, the time wasted amounts to : 

1 min X 60 sec X 10 lost sectors X 16 reads X 1 rev 
300 rev min read track 16 sector 

= 2 lost seconds per track 

This value is theoretical and is not com- 
pletely accurate, since rotational delay 
varies, depending upon factors such as 
random placement after moving to a new 
track, variations in DOS response, and so 
on. However, experimental measure- 
ments have show it to be within 10 per- 
cent of the actual delay in most situa- 
tions. If an Applesoft program stored in 
sixty-four sectors on the disk is loaded, 
this rotational delay amounts to eight 
seconds. With the nine descending skew, 
the delay is reduced to less than half a 
second. Obviously, the more sectors ac- 
cessed the greater the rotational delay. 
The chart in figure 8 shows the times re- 
quired to bload a binary program that is 
$7000 bytes in length ($70 sectors or 112 
decimal). Using both experimental and 
theoretical methods, the component de- 
lays to a complete disk access have been 
found. 

Figure 8 shows that rotational delay 
amounts to more than 50 percent of the 
time required to load the file with stan-

dard DOS skewing! By reskewlngto 9 de- 
scending, an Improvement in disk ac- 
cess time of 43 percent was realized. An- 
other interesting point is that the DOS file 
manager overhead is quite high. This is 
the processing time required to execute 
the instructions in the file manager pro- 
gram itself, and this time is required 
even by the commercially available disk 
emulators, which simulate a disk drive 
using RAM. Thus, emulators can do no 
better than to cut the delay back to the 
file manager overhead as a minimum. 
This effects about a three-times im- 
provement over standard DOS but not 
even a two-times improvement over the 
optimal skew. By reskewlng, with no ad-

Where To Find the Key. One further 
word on skewing as it applies to nonpro- 















■ 




gram files is in order. The pattern of ac- 
cess of a basic program to its data files 
varies drastically from program to pro- 
gram. Frequently an application will not 
return to the disk to read the next sector 
for many revolutions — it might even al- 
low the drive to turn itself off! In this 
case, sector skewing becomes a con- 
sideration of relatively low importance. 
Since access can also be affected by the 
number of records in each sector, it be- 
comes almost impossible to identify a re- 
peating computational delay. The best 
that can be said is that it does not matter 
much which skew is xised for data files 
and 9 descending will probably work as 
well as any other. 

The table in figure 9 shows the differ- 
ence between the standard 2 descending 
skew and a 9 descending skew for typical 
disk activities. It should be noted that 
these values may vary, because a num- 
ber of variables can affect the outcome, 
including hardware and even the brand 
of disk used. 

With information given in chapter 8 of 
Beneath Apple DOS and a disassembly of 
the read/write track/sector portion of 
DOS, an assembly language program- 
mer can create a program that will for- 
mat an entire disk, changing the normal 
order of the physical sectors on each 
track so that skewing is arranged to his 
preference. Although somewhat difficult 
technically, this task is fairly straight- 
forward. A simple modification to DOS's 
init code jrields a method for reskewlng 
every track of a blank disk, but this does 
not address the need for using a different 
skewing for tracks 0 through 2 than for 
the remainder of the disk nor does it per- 
mit the user to update an existing disk. 
These last two features are provided by 
the Init program that comes with the disk 
utility Bag of Tricks. Init will format, or 
reformat in place, one or more tracks 
with any desired skewing.

If you were to examine the contents of your Apple's 65,636 
memory addresses, you'd see an enormous string of eight-bit 
binary numbers that, taken in conjunction, constitute the pro- 
gram and data running within your computer at the moment of 
your inspection. 

Program In this context is a broad term that includes the 
system Monitor, a Basic interpreter, some version of the Disk 
Operating System (assuming you have that loaded Into memo- 
ry), and, perhaps, an application program of your own mak- 
ing. The term data, in this conte?rt, means the binary repre- 
sentation of whatever numbers and words your program may 
be operating upon or producing for your edification. 

Right Place at the Right Time. The computer doesn't dis- 
tinguish between program and data except by context. You 
could say that It's all data to the 6602 ; and, Just as with us, a bit 
of information may mean one thing in one setting and some- 
thing else entirely in another. So it is with your computer. A 
given number at a certain memory position may cause the 
processor to perform some action ; at another time and place it 
may be merely that which the processor processes. 

So how do all these numbers get into the computer in the 
first place? 

Some of them, like the ones that make up the system Moni- 
tor and the Basic interpreter, and like certain values stored in 
the low end of memory, are implanted automatically when you 
turn on your machine. The Monitor and interpreter are stored 
in ROM and are hence immovable residents of the upper 
extent of memory ; certain instructions stored within the Moni- 
tor cause other values to be written into what's called the zero 
page of memory— the addresses from 0 to 266. 

The Disk Operating System gets transferred into memory 
automatically, provided that you have a disk drive connected 
to the drive 1 pins of a controller card that's placed in one of 
your peripheral slots, and provided that that drive holds a disk 
that has DOS stored on it. Certain instructions in the Monitor 
cause the 6602 to scan the Apple's peripheral slots as soon as 
you turn the machine on, starting at slot 7 and moving down- 
ward. If a controller card is found, the 6602 is ordered to read 
the contents of the disk's outer three tracks and to transfer that 
information, by way of the drive 1 pins, into memory. Once 
within, DOS takes up quarters in the highest available area 
of RAM, which, on a 48K machine. Is directly below the ROM 
addresses. 

The Disk Operating System, on the Apple, resides in RAM, 
rather than ROM, so, unUke the Monitor, it can be altered— if 
you feel like doing that (see (DOSTalk, p. 33) . In fact, alter- 
ing the operating system is one means by which software pub- 
lishers often make their disks hard to copy. In order to run the 
Copy or Copy a programs on your System Master disk, you 
have to have the standard version of DOS loaded into memory. 
But if the disk you wish to copy was formatted under a slightly 
altered operating system, the Apple's copy programs, running 
under normal DOS, will not be able to read that disk, so you'll 
get an I/O error when you attempt to make the copy. 



Speaking the Language. Whatever programs are in yovir 
machine— whether ROM-resident, loaded from disk, or what- 
ever — have to have been entered manually at somebody's 
computer sometime. And almost without exception, the per- 
son who has done this work will have done it with the help of 
some kind of programming language. 

We say "almost without exception" because it is theoreti- 
cally possible to program certain computers directly in 
machine-readable binary code. Certain computers older than 
your Apple are eqvilpped with switches on the outside of the 
cabinet by which a person can enter binary numbers directly 
into specified memory locations. Another switch on this kind of 
machine tells the computer to begin executing the program so 
stored. 

If there is such a thing as programming in machine lan- 
guage, this kind of laborious procedure would be it. 

On your Apple there is no way of entering binary numbers 
quite that directly. But you can come almost as close to talk- 
ing to the processor in its native tongue by going into the Moni- 
tor and entering hexadecimal numbers. 

To get an idea of what that kind of programming is like, do 
a call -151 and enter the following: 

300,A9 OC 20 A8 FC AD 30 CO 88 DO F5 60 

followed by a return. You've Just written a tiny program in (al- 
most) machine language. Exactly what you've done is enter a 
specific hexadecimal value at each of the twelve addresses 
from hex 300 to 30B. 

If you now type 300G and hit return, you'll tell the proces- 
sor to run the program starting at location 300. Eureka, the 
program sounds the familiar Apple chime. You can make the 
program repeat rapidly by typing 300 and bunch of Qs and then 
hitting return. 

If you had a mind to do it, you could program a database 
manager, a word processor, or an arcade game in Just this 
fashion— by entering two-digit hex values at the proper memo- 
ry locations one by one, letting the Monitor translate them into 
their binary equivalents and using the Monitor's G command 
to make the program run. This would be monstrously difficult 
to do, however, for several reasons. 

First, it's tough to remember which numbers mean what to 
the 6602. Second, even if you had all the instruction codes 
memorized, it would take you forever to program anything 
meaningful. Third, and most Important, you'd never get it 
right the first time (programmers seldom do) and you 
wouldn't wish upon an enemy the task of correcting, or debug- 
ging, such a stream of undocumented hex code. 

Hansel and Gretel Strike Back. Even if by some quirk you 
did manage to get something complex to run the first time, this 
sort of direct programming would still be a lousy way to go. If 
you ever wanted to change your program more than a day 
after you'd finished It, you'd find that going back into that code 
to figure out how it all worked was worse than being lost in the 
forest without any bread crumbs.

APRIL 1982 



Programming languages were invented partly to let human 
beings command their computers with verbal symbols rather 
than merely with numbers and partly to provide a crumb trail 
to facilitate program debugging and maintenance. 

Programming languages are often described as being high- 
level or low-level, with numerous gradations of altitude be- 
tween. What makes a language high in level, by this way of 
thinking, is the degree to which It permits the programmer to 
command results rather than processes. For example, in 
Basic, a relatively high-level language, It Is possible to write an 
order like 

PRINT TAB(12) SQR(169) 

and the computer will respond by calculating the square root 
of 169 and displaying its answer on the screen, starting at the 
twelfth column. You could accomplish the same end result 
with a lower level language, but you'd have to specify more of 
the individual steps by which' the computer would carry out 
your request. 

As a consequence of high-level languages being more 
result-oriented than process-oriented, they tend to bear more 
resemblance to English than low-level programming lan- 
guages do. Just as we tend to think In terms of actions, like 
"walk across room," and leave to automatized Internal proc- 
esses the mechanical minutia of which muscles to contract 
when, so with a high-level language like Pascal we can use a 
command like write and let the computer worry about what In- 
dividual steps it must take. 

Suiting the Word to the Deed. Basic, Pascal, and other high- 
level languages commonly use words taken directly from En- 
glish — or other so-called natural languages — although the 
manner in which they require natural words to be used may 
seem a little formal and stilted to us at first. Computers, at this 
stage of their development, are much more exacting In their 
syntactic requirements than any natural language. 

Another consequence of the result-orlentatlon of high-level 



languages is that they are sometimes developed for a specific 
category of application. Cobol, for example. Is a language best- 
suited to business programming, while Pilot Is ideal for devel- 
oping tutorial dialogues for classroom settings. Fortran was 
written to facilitate mathematical and scientific computation. 
Basic was designed as a general-purpose high-level language, 
which is one reason why it has become the most commonly 
used language in the personal computer world. 

At the low-level end of the spectrum Is assembly language. 
In assembly language the programmer must manipulate each 
individual machine action, much as he would If he were pro- 
gramming directly In binary or hexadecimal code, but the pro- 
cedure is vastly simpler than direct programming. 

To begin with, in assembly language, instructions are speci- 
fied in the form of mnemonics instead of numbers. A typical In- 
struction would look like JSR $FDED, where the JSR Is the In- 
struction or opcode, telling the computer In this case to jump to 
a subroutine (a sequence of code located somewhere else In the 
program), and the $FDED Is the argument, telling the com- 
puter where to jump to. To program that instruction directly In 
hex, you would store the values 20, ED, and FD at the appro- 
priate three consecutive memory addresses. 

Writing JSR $F1DED may not seem a whole lot simpler than 
writing 20 ED FB, but It is some improvement. It's easier to 
remember what JSR means If you come back and look at your 
code later than it is to know what 20 means, particularly since 
that 20, out there In the middle of a stream of hex numbers, 
could just as easily be a piece of data as an opcode. 

The second big advantage of assembly language Is that it 
allows the programmer to Identify certain addresses or cer- 
tain segments of code by labels of his own choice. For exam- 
ple, $FDED is the starting address in the Monitor of the rou- 
tine that handles the display of characters on your screen. If 
your program made reference to that set of Monitor code, as It 
very likely would, you could define $FDED as, say, COUT (for 
character output— the name chosen by the programmers who

wrote the Monitor) or as any other name you liked, and then 
just call the routine by name instead of by number. If you've 
been trying to handle 20 ED FD or even JSR $FDED, JSR 
COUT starts to look downright friendly. 

The third big advantage of assembly language over direct 
programming is that it allows you to put comments into your 
program. Comments are the crumb-trail that tells you, or 
some other programmer who needs to decipher your code, 
why you did what you did — in plain English. There are no spell- 
ing or synteix rules governing what you put in a comment. 

Programming in assembly langiiage is essentially a two- 
step process. First you write what's called a source code, 
which includes your label definitions, your instructions, and 
your comments. Second, another program, called an dssem- 
bler, translates your source code into something the computer 
can read and execute ; that something is usually known as ob- 
ject code. 

Most assemblers are equipped to store both your source 
code and the resultant object code as separate files on disk. 
That way you can run the object code and still have the source 
listing for purposes of debugging and subsequent alteration. 
The results of the assembler's labor, the object code, are just 
what you would get if you programmed directly, through the 
Monitor; JSR COUT gets broken back down Into 20 ED FD, 
and so on. 

This brings up a point of nomenclature. You'll frequently 
see programs written in assembly language described as be- 
ing written in machine langn^age. This is technically Incorrect. 
The programs In question are written In assembly language 
and translated by an assembler Into machine language. 

Moreover, everything that runs on your computer, wheth- 
er originally coded in Pascal, Basic, Fortran, or Algol, must 
run In machine language; the 6502 responds to nothing else. 
The only kind of true machine language programming would 
be, as we said earlier, the direct entry of binary numbers into 
specified memory locations by way of external switches. 

It's a minor point, perhaps, but It may contribute to your 



understanding of what's going on. Programs labeled "ma- 
chine language" were written, presumably. In assembly lan- 
guage. The Import of that label to you Is that neither Basic In- 
terpreter Is required, so you can run such a program on either 
an Apple II or a II Plus. 

The Source of the Object. It may occur to you to wonder, 
since source code has to be translated by an assembler into ob- 
ject code, how one writes an assembler program. One way to 
do it is to use someone else's assembler. Another way, of 
course, is to punch the code in barehandedly, number by num- 
ber, through the Monitor. There are also such things as cross- 
assemblers, by which code originally written for some other 
computer (with the help of its assembler) can be converted 
into 6502 object code. 

Here's a sample of what an assembly language listing looks 
like. This is a small portion of the System Monitor (the auto- 
start version) , as listed In the Apple II Reference Mamial, pp. 
136 to 154.

The next column to the right, the one in which ESCNEW ap- 
pears on line 58, is a place for the programmer to label the cur- 
rent line. Other instructions in the program will be able to re- 
fer to a labeled line by its name. 

The third column in the source list holds the three-letter op- 
code mnemonic. There are fifty-six different elemental opera- 
tions that the programmer can ask the 8802 to perform (in- 
cluding one that tells it to do nothing but mark time for an in- 
stant) ; each one haa its own command mnemonic. Together 
these fifty-six mnemonics constitute what's called the instruc- 
tion set of the microprocessor. 

The column to the right of the mnemonics holds the argu- 
ments, or operands. These are the items of information upon 
which the 6602 is instructed to act. The argument field can hold 
one of three things: a value, an address, or a label (by which the 
processor finds its way to an address) . Or this column may be 
blank ; certain instructions— like INX, which tells the 8802 to in- 
crement by one the value currently held in the X register, do 
not require an argument. In our sample listing, the arguments 
in lines 55, 57, and 89 are numeric values; the others are all 
labels. 

Finally, the column on the right, the one that starts with a 
semicolon, contains the programmer's comments. These are 
notes to himself and other programmers ; the cussembler will 
ignore them when it converts the source file to object code. 

The four columns on the left in our listing represent the ob- 
ject code. The first column, always terminated by a colon, 
holds addresses. The second column holds opcodes, and the 
third and fourth columns are for the operands. Note that cer- 
tain opcodes require two bytes of operand, while others take 
only one. Still other opcodes, not shown in this list, would ap- 
pear by themselves, with no operand following. 

If you have an Apple with the autostart version of the sys- 
tem Monitor (an Apple n Plus or a standard Apple n equipped 
with an Apple Language System) , you can go into the Monitor 
by typing call -151 and verify the accuracy of our listing. Type 
FB9F.FBB2 from the asterisk prompt, and when you hit re- 
turn the Monitor will respond by printing the values stored at 
the designated range of memory addresses. If you compare 
them to our list, you'll see they match. If your Apple has the so- 
called old Monitor ROM— the one that doesn't automatically 
boot your disk drive when you turn the power on— then your 
listing will differ entirely. "The complete listings for both ver- 
sions of the Monitor are published in Appendix C of the Apple II 
Reference Manual.

Try one more experiment while you're in the Monitor. Type 
FB9FL and hit return. The Monitor's L command produces 
what's called a disassembled list. This process is somewhat 
the opposite of what an assembler does. In disassembling, the 
Monitor tries to translate the values held in a range of mem- 
ory addresses into source code. Where the range of memory in 
question holds some kind of executable program, the disas- 
sembly will produce something resembling a programmer's 
source code, although it will not show any line numbers, la- 
bels, or comments. If you try to disassemble some other range 
of memory, however, like an area that holds the last letter you 
wrote on your word processor, the Monitor will most likely pro- 
duce a lot of question marks in the mnemonic field; that's its 
way of saying, "This does not compute." 

We Never Promised You a ROM Garden. If by now you've 
drawn the conclusion that assembly language programming is 
an arcane art, practicable only by whiz kids and madmen, 
you're not alone in your judgment. Few would deny that it's 
more difficult than programming in Basic or Pascal. 

There are, however, compensating advantages to eussem- 
bly language. The one most frequently cited is speed; pro- 
grams written in assembly language usually can be executed 
by the computer at a faster pace than programs written in 
Basic or other high-level languages. 

Two factors accoimt for the greater speed of assembly lan- 
guage programs. First, at the time they are run they don't 
have to be converted into executable binary code ; they're al- 
ready there. Programs in both Basic and Pajscal have to be in- 
terpreted as they're run — translated line by line — into ma- 
chine code. Second, the fact that the assembly language pro- 
grammer has to specify each individual action of the micro- 
processor, while it makes programming more complex, also 
affords a greater degree of control. By writing in assembly lan- 
guage, a programmer can both minimize inefficiency in the 
code and accomplish certain things that would be awkward or 
even impossible using the more general-purpose routines 
provided by high-level languages. 

Programs that need a lot of quick graphic action, like most 
games, are almost alwavs written in assembly language. For 
many other kinds of programs, like those that go to disk fre- 
quently or that require a lot of input from the user, execution 
speed may be less critical, and so there may be no reason for 
a programmer to forego the amenities of a higher-level 
language. 

Next month we'll begin looking at some of those amenities. 



Assembly Lines: The Book may not make the national bestseller list, but it is being 
welcomed with open arms by thousands of Apple owners around the world. Avail- 
able now at dealers or directly from Soffalk, Roger Wagner's definitive word on ma- 
chine language programming is packed with information for the novice and experi- 
enced programmer alike. 

Assembly Lines: The Book contains the first fifteen installments of "Everyone's 
Guide to Assembly Language," Wagner's popular column originally published in Sof- 
falk magazine from October 1 980 through December 1 98 1 . If this were all there was 
to Assembly Lines: The Book, you'd probably still be getting your money's worth. 

In fact, the original material printed in Softalk is only about half the contents of 
Assembly Lines: The Book. Wagner has painstakingly expanded the SoHalk articles 
and added several appendixes. An index is included to make easy reference pos- 
sible. Written in clear, concise language, there is no better book on the subject of pro- 
gramming in assembly language than Roger Wagner's.

Over the past couple of months, these columns have been 
somewhat technical. As something of a break, this month we 
are going to continue with our discussion of the utilities, but our 
subjects win be the miscellaneous utilities— F0RMAT.COM, 
C0PY.COM, RW13.COM and CPM68.COM. Beginning next 
month, we'll go on to tackle more complex ones, such as ED 
and ASM. 

The four programs just mentioned can be classified cus 
maintenance utilities. They are the workhorses of the system, 
and FORMAT and COPY, at least, will come into play con- 
stantly. Those of you who still have access only to thirteen-sec- 
tor disks will not be familiar with the RW13 and CPM86 pro- 
grams. If this applies to you, it is recommended that you up- 
grade your system to sixteen sectors via the DOS 3.3 upgrade 
kit available at your dealer. As more and more companies dis- 
continue thlrteen-sector support, software usable in that for- 
mat will become harder and harder to find. In any case, the ad- 
ditional disk storage space available with the sixteen-sector 
format is worth the price by Itself. 

Before we proceed, a further recommendation is in order. 
The 16K ramboards available now are also a good value. While 
their use with Apple DOS is pretty much restricted to giving 
you the alternate language — ^Applesoft or Integer Basic, which- 
ever you don't have In ROM— with CP/M they give you addi- 
tional memory that you can use not only with .COM files but 
with MBaslc and GBaslc as well. Although their cost is cer- 
tainly not negligible, they return a sizeable increase in the use- 
fulness of your system. In many Instances the additional mem- 
ory will make the difference between being able to run a pro- 
gram or not. 

The first utility we will examine is F0RMAT.COM. This 
program is the general-purpose disk formatter and is similar 
to the init command used under Apple DOS. When you buy a 
disk, you get it in an unformatted condition. What this means is 
that there Is no information stored on the disk that your sys- 
tem Is capable of reading. Basically, there are two types of in- 
formation stored on a disk by the system. 

The first type is obviously the data that you yourself have 
instructed the system to store. As we've discussed in pajst col- 
umns, the Apple CP/M system handles disk data in 286-byte 
blocks called sectors. In reality, because of the way the infor- 
mation is encoded to be written on the disk, your 266 bytes ac- 
tually take up more than that number of bytes when stored 
there. Since this process is essentially invisible to us, we'll ig- 
nore It and simply say that the 266 bytes we put out there in a 
sector comprise the data area for that sector. The second type 
of information the system stores on the disk is of a housekeep- 
ing nature. It is the information the system needs to locate the 
sector — and hence our data — when we call for it. This infor- 
mation is comprised of severed things: the address field that 
contains the track, sector, and volume numbers; certain gaps 
between sectors that are used as buffer zones so that the next 
sector will not get overwritten when we rewrite the current 
one, as might happen if the disk drive were ninning slightly 



faster than before ; and, finally, some special bytes palled sync 
bytes that the drive electronics uses to Insure that it is in exact 
synchronization with the bj^es stored in the address and data 
fields. In reality, then, for every byte of data stored on the disk, 
several bytes of housekeeping information are also stored. 

Obviously, this housekeeping information must be written 
first for the entire disk, so that the system can find the proper 
sector when it needs to store a block of data. This is the job 
done by the formatter or initializer program. These programs 
or routines usually take care of initializing the directory; cer- 
tain of them, for example, the Apple DOS init command, put 
the operating system on the disk as well. FORMAT, like its 
counterparts, sets up each of the thirty-five tracks of the disk 
with the address Information for each sector. In addition, it 
also writes hexadecimal E6 bytes into every sector of the disk 
as data. These bj^es are really only necessary for the direc- 
tory portion of the disk and even then are only really needed in 
a few bytes of the directory. By writing the entire disk how- 
ever, FORMAT has a chance to check each of the sectors for 
validity of the address Information; it will report an I/O error if 
there are any media defects. No attempt is made by FOR- 
MAT to do a complete media verification, however. 

The syntax for FORMAT is either: 

FORMAT 

or 

FORMAT d: (where d is a valid system drive designator) 

In the case of the first syntax above, FORMAT will prompt 
the user for the drive designator and when finished, will 
prompt again for another drive. If a return only is given at the 
prompt, the program cancels and returns to the CCP (remem- 
ber, this is the Console Command Processor, responsible for 
the CP/M prompt) . In response to the second syntax shown, 
FORMAT will do the format on the disk indicated and return 
immediately to the CCP. In either case, the program prompts 
the user to Insert the blank disk to be formatted in the selected 
drive and, before beginning the process, checks to see if the 
disk has already been formatted. If so, it returns a warning 
that the disk contains data and prompts the user to go ahead or 
abort the format operation. ^Tienever a format Is done, the 
FORMAT program always erases a track before formatting it. 
This is to insure that nowhere in those gaps we mentioned is 
there a chance that a valid address mark or sync byte field still 
exists that might cause the drive to read data erroneously. 

FORMAT checks for proper drive designators and will at- 
tempt to verify that the drive named is actually connected to 
the system. As we've mentioned before, CP/M is aware of 
whether a disk controller card is in the appropriate slot for the 
corresponding drive, but It has no way of verifying If there are 
two drives connected to the card. Consequently, FORMAT will 
produce an error message for nonexistent drives in either 
situation. 

The second program we'll discuss is C0PY.COM, the disk 
copy utility. COPY fulfills several functions. It is the full disk 



192 



^Ol:TAI V 



APRIL 1982 



copier; It is the method of placing CP/M on the first three 
tracks of a disk (replacing SYSGEN found on most other sys- 
tems) ; and, finally, in conjunction with DDT.COM, It is the 
method that Microsoft has used to enable owners to install 
changes In their CP/M (replacing MOVCPM's similar func- 
tion on other systems). 

COPY requires that the destination disk be newly format- 
ted or that It previously contained data (used with an Apple 
system, of course) . By far the safest method is to format a disk 
before copjing to It, but If you like to live dangerously COPY 
will properly trtmsfer the contents of the source disk to the tar- 
get disk, whether the target was a previously used CP/M disk 
or an old Apple DOS disk. Since each and every sector of each 
and every track is transferred with COPY, it does not matter 
what information was previously there, as It will be entirely 
overwritten. The safest way, however, is to reformat. 

Like FORMAT, COPY may be invoked with or wdthout a 
command line as follows: 

COPY 

or 

COPY di:=d2: (where dl and 62 are drive designators and 
may be the same drive) 

In the former case, the COPY program will prompt you for 
a response to indicate the source and destination drives. In this 
case, the source and destination are then typed, separated by 
an equals sign ( = ). As with all CP/M utilities, the equals sign 
acts just as it does In Basic ; that Is, the quantity (In this case 
the data) in the symbol on the right is placed Into the symbol on 
the left. Destination is therefore on the left and source on the 
right. At this point, COPY will prompt you to Insert the disk 
into the named drives and hit return. When you do, the copy 
procedure will commence. If only one drive is being used, 
COPY win prompt you to Insert the appropriate disks into the 
drive at the proper times. 

In addition to copying the entire disk, COPY also allows you 
to copy only the three system tracks onto the target disk. This 
allows you to put CP/M on the disk and make it bootable. A 
disk with CP/M on it is called a system disk, for obvious rea- 
sons. This Is done using a /S after the destination and source 
drive names. There should be no spaces In this command line. 
Unlike Apple DOS, CP/M does not have the capability of using 
the first three tracks for the storage of data and therefore no 
storage space is lost by putting the system on your disk. Note, 
however, that your copy of CP/M is serial numbered and reg- 
istered with Digital Research. Any disk that you use to give 
your own programs to friends and associates must not contain 
your serial-numbered CP/M. To do so Is a violation of the li- 
cense agreement you have with Digital Research and with Mi- 
crosoft. If the programs you wish to give are on a system disk, 
use the PIP utility to put them on a nonsystem-formatted disk. 
With COPY, there Is no way to avoid copying the system if the 
original disk contains it. 

The next utility, RW13.COM, is a program to allow slxteen- 
sector systems to read and write thlrteen-sector disks. With 
that in mind, this discussion and the program itself will be of 
limited use to those of you with thlrteen-sector systems. Its ac- 
tual purpose is twofold: first, it allows people with thirteen and 
sixteen sector systems to exchange their text files and pro- 
grams with a minimum of effort ; second, it allows companies 
to distribute certain software in a thlrteen-sector single for- 
mat, knowing that both tjrpes of systems can use it — either di- 
rectly or by converting it with RW13 and PIP. From the user 
standpoint, the program simply ajsslgns one drive in the sys- 
tem to be the thlrteen-sector drive, and from then on, all disk 
reads and writes with that drive will be in thlrteen-sector 
format. 

FYinctlonally, the program is a self-relocating image of the 
thlrteen-sector RWTS (Read-Write-Track-Sector) routines. On 
execution, it loads into memory at the normal TPA (Transient 
Program Area) , starting at 100 hex, and then it moves Itself to 
high memory just below the CCP. The vectors for the appro- 
priate drive are patched to point to these routines Instead of the 



standard disk drivers. RW13 also alters the address field of the 
jump BDOS instruction at location 06H (location 06H Is the low- 
order byte, and 07H the high-order byte; all are Z80 address- 
es) , to point to Its own beginning. This jump instruction and the 
corresponding address field are what tell programs the loca- 
tion of the beginning of BDOS and consequently the top of the 
user program memory. In this way, RW13 effectively protects 
Itself from Inadvertent overwriting by any programs running 
in the system. In order to keep the BDOS calls functional, the 
old address field from locations 06H and 07H is placed into a 
jump instruction in the first three bytes of RW13. The address 
that is patched into the disk vector to point to RW13 takes this 
into account and actually points to the fourth byte in the RW13 
routine. 

Only one drive may be converted to thlrteen-sector at any 
one time, and this drive may not be the boot drive (drive A:). 
To invoke RW13 the command is: 

RW13 d: 

The system will respond with "Drive d: converted to 13 sec- 
tor operation". Attempts to make another drive thirteen sec- 
tor while one is already converted will result in the error mes- 
sage, "Must RW13 X: first". This is the format for cancelling 
the RW13 command, and is typed as follows: 

RW13 X: 

The system will respond with "Drive d: returned to 16 sec- 
tor operation". 

The final program on our list to be examined is 
CPM56.COM. This utility is the means used to increase your 
available program memory by taking advantage of the 16K 
ramboard. It obviously cannot be used unless a ramboard is in- 
stalled in the system. As shipped, the version of CP/M in- 
cluded on your slxteen-sector disk is designed for 44K of avail- 
able RAM memory. Note that if your Apple is standard and 
has 48K of RAM, only 44K are available for use by CP/M. The 
other four are needed for the Apple zero page scratchpad loca- 
tions, the 6502 stack, and the Apple screen memory area. 

Of the 44K usable, the combination of BDOS and BIOS— or 
CP/M itself, in other words— takes approximately 5K, leaving 
about 39K for user program space. This is somewhat better 
than the approximately 36K available under Apple DOS, but 
since the CP/M Basics must also reside in RAM, the area for 
user Basic programs becomes somewhat limited. 

Using a ramboard and CPM56, the additional 12K of user 
RAM available on the ramboard can be used for programs, 
bringing the total to 56K and the user available space to 51K. 
The additional 4K unaccounted for is unfortunately needed in 
the Apple system to take care of memory-mapped I/O, the 
method used to address the ROMs on cards in the Apple slots. 
Even so, this is a significant Increase, both in space and in the 
usability of the system for serious programming purposes. 

CPM56.COM is basically another version of CP/M de- 
signed to run at a different and higher address in memory. In 
this way it is analogous to the program MOVCPM, which in 
many other systems enables you to move CP/M's operating lo- 
cation in memory so that you can adjust It for the particular 
size system you are using. Such a wide variation was not avail- 
able on the Apple, so there was no need to provide other than 
the two versions. CPM56 can be Invoked by the following 
command : 

CPM56 d: (where d is the drive designator you wish the new 
system to be written to.) 

The system will prompt you when you are to Insert the disk to 
be written to in the drive you selected. 

Be aware that the two versions are mutually exclusive to 
the extent that you cannot place a 56K disk in the boot drive 
and do a warm boot if you are currently running 44K, and vice 
versa. To do so will cause the system to hang, requiring a cold 
boot to recover. You should also be aware that many pro- 
grams perform the equivalent of a warm boot at their conclu- 
sion and that the effect of this will be exactly the same. The

disk and file formats of course are identical and, with the ex- 
ception of the above, can be Interchanged at will. 

This completes our discussion of the miscellaneous utili- 
ties. Before we leave the subject, however, we will talk about a 
utility that you can enter at your keyboard that will also be- 
come a valuable utility for you to have at your disposal. The 
following program, entitled B00T.COM, is a general-purpose 
reboot program that, in essence, does the equivalent of a cold 
boot on the controller card in slot 6. In addition, it also gives 
you the capability of booting either thirteen-sector or sixteen- 
sector disks from a sixteen-sector system. It is supplied in hex 
dump form, and is entered as follows: 

Procedure for Entering BOOT.COM 

1. Invoke DDT.COM by typing simply DDT when at the A> 
prompt. 

2. When DDT signs on and gives you its prompt, a minus sign 
(-), type SlOO followed by a return. DDT will respond with 
the address 0100, a space, and the contents of that address 
as a two-byte hexadecimal number; then It will leave the 
cursor one space to the right, awaiting your entering a new 
value for that location. 

3. Each time you enter a value followed by a return, or Just a 
return, DDT will display the next address and Its contents. 
In the former case, it will have replaced the current con- 
tents of the last address with the one you typed, and in the 
latter case, it will have left them as is. Typing a period (.) 
followed by a return will cancel the S command and return 
you to the DDT prompt. 

4. As you have no doubt surmised, your mission (should you 
decide to accept it) is to take the bj^es from the hex dump 
that follows and, beginning at 100 hex, enter them all, using 
DDT and its S command. Once done, you should be very 
thorough in checking your work, either by going back 
through with the S command and just hitting returns or by 
using the command DlOO to generate a table to compare to 
the one that follows. 



5. When you have finished and are sure the data has been en- 
tered correctly, insert the disk you wish to save the pro- 
gram to in the currently logged drive and type control-C. 
When the CP/M prompt returns, type SAVE 1 BOOT.COM. 
This completes the procedure for installing BOOT. Accuracy 
cannot be stressed strongly enough, since erroneous bytes In 
the program may have any number of nasty side effects.

The "Qwerty" arrangement that we are all accustomed towasscientificallydesignedtobeaslnefficientasposslble, to prevent keyjams on the first typewriters of the 
1870's. Sheer inertia has kept that arrangement in use to this day, even though in 1 932, professor A. Dvorak invented (and patented) a new arrangement that makes 
sense. The most often used keys are on the "home" row, and the strongest fingers get most of the work.

Exploring Business Basic, 
Part 8 

Greetings, Basic fans. This month's 
column will be long on content and some- 
what short on the usual verbiage and ex- 
planations. This is because of the inter- 
est that last month's column stirred up. 
As the faithful among you will recall, we 
began a fairly simple discussion of the 
graphics capability of the Apple in and 
the specific workings of the .GRAFIX 
driver and the BGRAF invokable mod- 
ule. If you haven't read that discourse, it 
would be a good idea to get a copy before 
tackling the treatise below. If that's not 
possible, then get a firm grip on your 
Basic and Standard Device Drivers 
Manual. 

Last month's article had as its main 
feature a program to draw circles and 
arcs efficiently, using the line-drawing 
capability of BGRAF. After some 
examination (and some comments!), 
that routine could use some tweaking. To 
see what can be done and to bring your- 
self up to date, refer to program 1 for the 
initialization and circle-draw 
subroutines : 

894 REM circle draw subroutine 

895 REM r= radius, scaiefac= aspect ratio * relative 
density

1055 zip%=1 
1060 PERFORM initgrafix 
1070 RETURN 

Program 1 

Those readers from last time will no- 
tice that to improve the symmetry of the 
circles, the cosine and sine tables (line 
1030) have been adjusted to 120 points, 
which happens to divide each quadrant of 
the circle into equal parts (given a maxi- 
mum stepsize of 6, as used in line 930) . 

Rathi^ than go into any further detail 
about these routines, we'll plunge into the 
material, which will make good use of 
this stuff later. 

The major input from last time was to 
take the skeleton program and make it 
into something useful that would show off 
more of the graphics capabilities of the 
Apple in. One of the most reasonable ap- 
proaches would be to expand the set of 
functions in the prcg^ram and build a be- 
gfinning graphics editor— which you could 
then expand to your heart's content. The 
actual functions of such a program are 
easy to define. We have already imple- 
mented circles, and to that we can add 
lines, points, rectangles, text, the ability 
to fill in areas easily, the ability to erase 
objects and points, and, finally, the abil- 
ity to store images on disk for later re- 
call. To this list you can add lots of other 
features of your own design, within the 
framework that will be described. The 
key to all this is the power of the BGRAF 
module. The benefits (an important word 
in marketing parlance) range from 
drawing up organization charts to creat- 
ing interesting cartoons. So let's get to it! 

The first thing needed for a screen 
editor is some way to locate the cursor. 
Since it will be difficult to distinguish the 
cursor from any arbitrary dot on the 
screen, it will be convenient for it to 
blink. To do that we need a way to alter- 
nate the colors of the dot that will be our 
cursor while waiting for input from the 
user. The interrupt capabilities of the Ap- 




m a n 



pie ni really come in handy here, be- 
cause Basic implements the any key- 
press event with SOS. This causes an in- 
terrupt to occur in Basic, to which your 
program can react. The following short 
program Illustrates: 

1 ON KBD GOTO 10 

5 PRINT"."; 

6 GOTO 5 
10 OFF KBD 

30 IF KBD= 13 THEN STOP 
40 PRINT KBD 
45 ON KBD GOTO 10 
50 RETURN 

This program will print lots of dots, 
stopping only to print out the ASCII value 
of the key you press on the keyboard. If 
you are not familiar with how this works, 
check the section in the manual that de- 
scribes the on kbd statement. This one 
statement is going to make our graphics 
editor really easy to implement. 

As was said, the creation of a blink- 
ing cursor entails alternating colors and 
printing a succession of these alternat- 
ing dots to the screen at the cursor loca- 
tion. There are lots of possibilities as to 
which color can be at a given screen lo- 
cation, and we want to move the cursor 
freely without worrying about destroy- 
ing the image. To do this efficiently, we'll 
use a feature in the .GRAFIX driver 
called the transfer option. This option is 
really eight options in one, but we'll use 
inverse replace, which will alternate col- 
ors each time a dot is plotted. Combining 
that with the on kbd statement and add- 
ing the initialization section results in 
program 2.

91 savecolor%= EXFN%.xycolor 

92 color%= EXFN%.xycolor:PERFORM 
pencolor(%color%):PERFORM 
clotrel(%0,%0)!GOTO 92 

Lines 10 through 87 call the initializa- 
tion subroutine, prompt for some key 
values, and then turn on the graphics 
screen. The really interesting stuff starts 
on line 89 where the on kbd is set up to go 
to line 300 on any keypress. Line 90 sets 
up the transfer option (see your manual 
for more details on what this does) , and 
line 91 saves the current color for restor- 
ing later. Line 92 is a loop that can only be 
interrupted by a keypress. It picks up the 
current color, sets the pen to that color, 
and then plots the dot. Because of the 
transfer option, the actual color plotted 
will be a logical alternate color to the 
original one. Plotting the alternate color 
through the same option restores the 
original color; thus the blinking effect. 
Now for the fun. We would obviously like 
to do more than stare at a blinking cur- 
sor. At the least, we should be able to 
move it around. That can be handled by a 
routine at line 300: 

300 OFF KBD:PERFORM xfroption(%0) 
305 PERFORM pencolor(%$avecolor%): 

PERFORM dotrel(%0,%0) 
310 IF KBD>31 THEN GOSUB 360:GOTO 340 
320 IF KBD=27 THEN POPrGOTO 170 
325 xinc%=zlp%*(( KBD=21)-( KBD=8))! 

yinc% = zlp%*(( KBD=ll)-( KBD=10)) 
330 PERFORM moverel(%xlnc%,%yinc%) 
340 savecolor%= EXFN%.xycolor! 

PERFORM xfroption(%4) 
345 ON KBD GOTO 300 
350 RETURN 

360 REM commands go here 

This one little routine does quite a bit. 
Lines 300 and 305 just restore the state of 
the screen and turn off the keyboard in- 
terrupt to insure that the next state- 
ments are properly executed. Line 310 
checks to see if the key pressed was a 
printable character; if it was, line 360 
starts a series of routines to process the 
command that the letter represents. If 
the character is a control character, it is 
checked for escape. Escape is used to sig- 
nal quitting the screen and going back to 
main level options. Thus the pop state- 
ment is used to Jump out without leaving 
our gosub hanging. If the character is not 
an escape, line 325 does some clever 
processing: through the use of logical 
statements, the character is checked for 
one of the arrow keys and the appropri- 
ate X or y coordinate is incremented. 
Note that the variable zip% is used to 
multiply the effect of the increment, to 
enable large cursor moves. This is ini- 
tialized in the subroutine at line 1000. If 
line 325 is confusing to you, take a mo- 
ment to study its effect. Try out various 
values of kbd to see how it works. These 
logical statements (not available in 
many Basics) can replace a lot of clumsy 
and lengthy if statements. Line 330 



moves the cursor appropriately, and the 
rest of the routine cleans up and returns 
to line 92. To wrap up this routine and the 
one above it, we need to add a couple of 
lines: 

170 TEXT:GOTO 35 

180 PERFORM release:PERFORM reieaie 

185 CLOSE:INVOKE 

190 END 

Just a few more statements and we'll 
have a fully functional program ! As was 
mentioned earlier, line 360 begins a sub- 
routine that handles commands. We al- 
ready have a way to move the cursor 
around on the screen, and the following 
lines implement the simple functions of 
drawing a dot, erasing a dot, speeding up 
the cursor, and returning the cursor 
movement to normal. We'll use the let- 
ters D, E, Z (for zip!), and N to describe 
those functions. The statements look like 
this: 

360 IF KBD>95 THEN key$=CHR${KBD-32). 
ELSE key$=CHR$(KBD) 

366 IF key$="D" THEN PERFORM pencolor(%pen): 
PERFORM dotrel(%0,%0)!RETURN 

367 IF key$="E" THEN PERFORM pencolor(%flll)! 
PERFORM dotrel(%0,%0):RETURN 

368 IF key$="Z" THEN zip% = iip%*2:RETURN 
370 IF key$="N" THEN zip%= IrRETURN 

399 RETURN 

The first line, 360, just makes sure 
that lower-case letters are upshifted, and 
then, mostly for ease of reading, the 
value is converted to an ASCII charac- 
ter. From there on, t/" statements test the 
value and perform the fimctions. Notice 
that drawing and erasing is as simple as 
changing the pencolor and drawing a dot 
(relative plotting is used to save the trou- 
ble of getting the coordinates). The Z 
command just doubles the movement of 
the cursor each time it's pressed. This 
comes in handy, especially on the 560-by- 
192 screen. The return on line 399 just 
traps any invalid commands that might 
be typed and returns with no effect. 

With this in mind, it's easy to add 
features : 

372 IF key$="H" THEN PERFORM 
moveto(%0,%0):RETURN 

This just homes the cursor, in case 
you get it lost off the screen. Yes, that's 
right; you can move the cursor any- 
where in that -32768 to 32767 space! 

Now, since we already have a circle- 
draw routine, we can add that simply: 

374 IF key$="C" THEN INPUT nGOSUB 450i 
GOSUB 900:GOSUB 460:RETURN 

Notice that we have added references 
to two new gosuba : 460 and 460. These are 
used to save and restore the state of the 
cursor, since the circle-draw routine al- 
ways leaves the cursor on the circle. 
They are simple and look like this: 

450 xcen= EXFN%.xloc:ycen= EXFN%.yloc 
455 cres= EXFN%.xycolortPERFORM 
pencolor(%pen):RETURN 



460 PERFORM moveto(%xcen,%ycen)iPERFORM 
pencolor(%cres):RETURN 

The other new thing about the routine 
at line 374 is that it asks for input. The 
prompt will be displayed on the text 
screen, so you won't see it unless you 
choose to add a text command to switch 
back before the input. You would then 
need to perform grafixon to get the 
screen back. 

Okay, this should be enough to make 
for an interesting display. Now would be 
a good time to type this program in and 
debug it (it is possible to make typing 
mistakes ! ) . 

Okay, now that you're back for more, 
try adding the following: 

376 IF key$="B" THEN INPUT w,hiGOSUB 
450:GOSUB 500:GOSUB 460!RETURN 

That's right, B stands for Box and uses a 
small subroutine at 500: 

500 w=w*scalefac 

510 PERFORM llnerel(%w,%0):PERFORM 

linerel(%0,%h):PERFORM linerel(%(-w),%0). 
PERFORM linerel(%0,%(-h)):RETURN 

Are you beginning to get the idea of 
how easy it is to add features to this pack- 
age? You probably are starting to get 
some Ideas of your own, but here are a 
few simple ones while you are thinking: 

380 IF key$="T" THEN SWAP pen.filhPERFORM 
fillcolor(%fill):PERFORM pencolor (%pen)< 
RETURN 

382 IF key$="R" THEN xrem= EXFN%.xlociyrem= 

EXFN%.ylocRETURN 
384 IF key$="L" THEN GOSUB 450!PERFORM 

lineto(%xrem,%yrem):GOSUB 460iRETURN 
386 IF key$="X" THEN PERFORM fillcolor(%flll)! 

PERFORM flllport:RETURN 

Line 380 lets you toggle between fill- 
color and pencolor. This is handy to erase 
something you Just drew (like a circle or 
a box), by toggling the pencolor. Then 
you can repeat the previous command, 
and it will magically disappear! Line 382 
simply "remembers" a point. It is used in 
conjunction with line 384, which draws a 
line from that point to wherever the cur- 
sor is located. line 384 creates the X 
command to erase the viewport com- 
pletely. That's a good idea for a com- 
mand you can add to reset the current 
graphics viewport. 

A couple more small ones, and then 
we'll get to the last two biggies. Here are 
two that permit you to save and load the 
graphics screen to disk. This not only is 
useful for making a permanent copy but 
can be used before any major sequence 
of commands. In case you don't like the 
results, simply reload the old contents, 
and the screen is magically restored. 

388 IF key$="S" THEN PERFORM giave."picture": 
RETURN 

390 IF key$="P" THEN PERFORM gload."plefure"i 
RETURN 

By now, you've probably got so many 
commands in the program that you have 



196 

to write them down. That's great. All 
huge programs were once tiny sub- 
routines. 

This next routine deserves some 
study. One of the things that would be 
nice, especially for charts and graphs, 
would be to put text on the graphics 
screen. Fortunately, the .GRAFIX per- 
mits that to be done easily. However, we 
can make this much more sophisticated 
with just a little programming effort, to 
wit: 

392 IF key$="W" THEN GOSUB 450rGOSUB 6OO1 
GOSUB 46aRETURN 

Subroutine 600 Is used to write on the 
screen (program 3). See how all these 
command letters make sense? After a 
while, the toughest part of the program is 
making up new commands that don't use 
any of the letters already taken. 

600 charcnt=0:line$="" 
605 GET a$ 

610 IF ASC(a$)<32 THEN 640 
615 line$ = line$+a$ 
620 PRINT#l;a$; 
625 charcnt=charcnt+ 1 
630 GOTO 605 
640 chr=ASC(a$) 
645 IF chr= 13 THEN RETURN 
650 IF chrOS OR (chr=8 AND charcnt=0) THEN 
605 

655 SWAP pen,fill 

660 PERFORM pencolor(%pen) 

665 PERFORM moverel(%-7,%0) 

670 PRINT#l;RIGHT${line$,l); 

673 PERFORM moverel(%-7,%0) 

675 charcnt=charcnt— 1 

678 line$=LEFT$(llne$,charcnf) 

680 SWAP pen,fil|:PERFORM pencolor(%pen) 

685 GOTO 605 f 

LProgram 3 

The nice thing about the screen-writ- 
ing subroutine Is that It not only writes on 
the screen as you type but also allows you 
to use the back-arrow to erase mistakes. 
To permit this, the variable linef keeps 
track of what you have typed, and, if a 
back-arrow is encountered, the routine 
picks off the last character in the string, 
puts the pen in fill mode, and reprints the 
character on top of the original charac- 
ter, thus erasing it. Note that this back- 
ing up is done with the perform moverel 
command, and -7 is used, because that 
is a standard character space. Note also 
that you have to back up after erasing, 
too, since the graphics routines still think 
you were writing an ordinary character. 

A carriage return terminates the 
write mode, and a check in line 650 en- 
sures that you are not allowed to back up 
pfist the beginning point. 

The last routine is the most complex, 
and the one in the worst shape — mean- 
ing that it works fairly well but could 
stand enormous Improvement. It was 
meant as a beginning, and any help, sug- 
gestions, modifications, etcetera, would 
be appreciated. The routine is the prom- 
Ised-from-last-time area fill sub- utine. 
It is integrated into the pack a as

Program 4 

Messy, right? Right. Unfortunately 
there is no easy way to do general area 
fill. The principle is that you must first lo- 
cate the cursor in the uppermost part of 
the figure to be filled. The routine then 
searches down and across for a match 
for its current pencolor. When that's 
found, the cursor returns to the starting 
point and searches to the right until a 
match is found. A line is then drawn from 
the right-hand poin^/to the left. Subrou- 
tines at 1400 and 1430 do the left and right 
scanning. 

Of course, if this was all it did, the rou- 
tine would be a great deal simpler. The 
additional sophistication lies in an al- 
gorithm designed to enable the filling of 
complex shapes that contain other 
sha[>es. The simplest example is that of a 
circle within a circle. If you want to 
create something that looks like a donut, 
you could draw one circle inside the other 
and fill the space between the two cir- 



APRIL 1982 



cles. This routine will handle most of 
those cases, along with circles inside 
boxes and such. This is done by always 
favoring the right-hand side of figures 
and putting information in the srch% ar- 
ray when the routine suspects that it may 
have missed something. In addition, the 
routine tries to begin searches from what 
it suspects is the center of the open area. 
The problems come when the figfure in- 
side a figtire is sharply off to the right 
hand side of the larger object. The rou- 
tine will usually miss a part of the filling 
because of an inadequate scan. Maybe by 
next time there will be a hotter version, 
but meanwhile, it's easy just to move the 
cursor over and reissue the fill com- 
mand to get what was missed. 

After that apology, it should be 
pointed out that any simple figfure, espe- 
cially a convex one, will be filled reason- 
ably well, as long as you start at the top. 
In fact, you might want to tweak this rou- 
tine for simple figures by jettisoning the 
srch% array and changing the search to 
look up as well as down. Note also that no 
real optimization has been done. The 
usual tricks of multiple statements on a 
line and replacing constants — plus 
tighter coding — would probably speed up 
this routine considerably. Oh well, 
another project for you in your spare 
time. 

One last parting shot. Often features 
are put in Basics that don't seem to be 
particularly useful. However every com- 
mand has some real purpose; finding 
them can save lots of programming and 
will usually make your applications more 
efficient. In looking over the program 
above, you'll see a crjdng need for instr 
and on gosub. Notice that all of the if 
key$= statements could be replaced with 
the following: 

1 057 commands = "DEZNHCBTRLXSPWF" 
362 cmd = INSTR(command$,key$) 

364 ON cmd GOSUB 366,367,368,370,372,374, 
376,380,382,384,386,388,390,392,394 

365 RETURN 

Then each subroutine line could look like 
this example: 

394 GOSUB 450:GOSUB 1300:GOSUB 
460:RETURN 

This is not only neater, but much 
more efficient as well, since it doesn't re- 
quire that you go through fifteen if state- 
ments just to find the one that's wanted. 
It also permits multiple line subroutines, 
which the other structure does not. 
Adapting the other structure to multiple 
line routines would require the if state- 
ments to be linked with goto, a situation 
to be avoided. 

Well, so much for philosophy. This has 
been a meaty article. There are many 
features that need to be added to this 
month's package to make it truly useful, 
but by now, surely, you've dropped this 
magazine and are bent industriously 
over the keyboard. Time to tiptoe quietly 
away. . . . Genius at Work! II

FIVE PROGRAMS 
THAT CAN HELP 

BY (.UK sTinson 



A year ago, in April and May of 1981, Softalk published a 
two-part article reviewing home finance programs — single-en- 
try accounting systems intended primarily for use in the home 
or in small businesses. Herewith, as an update to that account, 
we offer a review of five similar programs. 

This year's roundup includes : Personal Finance Manager, 
from Apple Computer's Special Delivery Software, pro- 
grammed by Jeffrey Gold ; Chequemate, by Masterworks Soft- 
ware, progframmed by Steve Collins and Tom Moch; Finan- 
cial Management System III, published by Computerized 
Management Systems and programmed by Dennis Jarvis; 
Continental Software's The Home Accountant, by Robert 
Schoenburg, Stephen Pollack, and Larry Grodin; and Per- 
sonal Finance Master, from Spectrum Software, pro- 
grammed by Andrew Thompson. 

Financial Management System III (we'll call it FMS III) is 
an update to a program reviewed last year. The earlier entry, 
FMS II, appeared first under the banner of D. R. Jarvis Com- 
puting; Jarvis has subsequently changed the name^of his com- 
pany. 

Spectrum's PFM (to be distinguished, one hopes, from Ap- 
ple's PFM) , is a consolidation with enhancements of Home Fi- 
nance Pak, which was also included in last year's reviews. 
Home Finance Pak consisted of three separate programs — one 
for your checkbook, one for your credit cards, and another for 
cash; PFM wraps all those functions up into a single, though 



not yet entirely integrated, program. 

The Home Accountant could be regarded as a revision of 
Continental's Home Money Minder, but the enhancements pro- 
vided in The Home Accountant are significant enough to point 
it toward a slightly different end viser; hence, the new name 
and the continued availability and popularity of Home Money 
Minder. 

The last two items on this year's survey, Mfuiterworks's 
Chequemate and Apple's PFM (not to be confounded with 
Spectrum's), are a relatively new entry to the market and a 
relatively old one, respectively. Apple's program is included in 
this discussion because it was not available for review a year 
ago. 

Here's what the five pieces have in common: 

All will let you design a budget for yourself, your family, or 
your business — a list of projected expenditures per month, 
classified by expense categories of your own definition. Most- 
all but the Apple PFM— will also let you establish a list of ex- 
pected monthly income amounts by category. 

All five programs give you the means of recording your in- 
come and expenses — at least those transactions that involve 
your checking account — and compare monthly totals to your 
budget. The programs differ considerably in their power to 
track transactions outside of your checkbook. 

All offer a variety of printed and onscreen reports to help 
you monitor your financial life. The feedback comes in three 



200 



APRIL 1982 



general forms: summary reports, usually on hard copy; pin- 
point searches, to display individual transaction records; and 
graphics. All but one of these programs (FMS III) offer some 
form of graphic display, although none at present offers any 
convenient way to dump the graphics onto hardcopy. 

Additionally, each of these programs has some kind of rou- 
tine to help you reconcile your checkbook with the bank's ver- 
sion of your account. If success at this monthly balancing act 
has proved elusive and your troubles have been chiefly arith- 
metical, then any of these programs should be a great help. 
They will not, of course, prevent errors of omission — failure 
to record transactions — but they may help you discover such 
errors. 

So much for common ground. 

Probably the most crucial difference among these five pro- 
grams has to do with scope — ^the amount of accounting they 
will do. The Home Accountant leads the field on this score: it 
allows you to maintain five separate checking accounts and 
monitor them all, in the aggregate, against a common budget. 
This multiaccount capability makes the program appealing to 
a small biisinessman, work-at-home freelancer, club trea- 
surer, or anyone else who may need to keep several checking 
accounts but doesn't want to get into double-entry bookkeep- 
ing. 

Furthermore, The Home Accountant will also keep track of 
your credit cards — virtually 8us many as you wish — and cash. 
One cash account is made available for each checking account 
you keep on the system. 

What makes all this nifty is that your various accounts will 
speak to one another. Write a check for a Visa payment and the 
balances in both accoimts will be decremented appropriately; 
putting cash in the bank will lower your cash balance while 



hoisting your checkbook, and so on. 

If cash Is going into a savings account, that fact can also be 
noted. The Home Accountant lets you maintain miscellaneous 
accounts — classified as assets or liabilities — such as savings 
accounts, stock accounts, debts owed by you, or any other 
source of value, positive or negative, that affects your net 
worth. The value recorded by the system for these miscellane- 
ous accounts can be changed either by way of a transaction In 
a checking, cash, or credit card account, or through an editing 
module ; the editing module provides for changes that do not 
involve your more liquid accounts, as, for example, the rise 
and fall of your fortunes on the stock exchange. 

When you set up your budget with The Home Accountant, 
you organize your financial affairs into five broad types of 
categories: assets, liabilities, credit cards, income, and ex- 
penses. Only the last two of these are properly considered bud- 
get categories; the other three are really accounts. But all five 
types have a certain logical equivalence to the system — ^they 
are places to file your transactions. 

When you subsequently record a transaction, you desig- 
nate, among other things, the appropriate category; If that 
category Is something that falls under the broad type of In- 
come or expenses, then your transaction will find Its way Into a 
budget report. If the category Is something like MasterCard 
that belongs to one of the other three types, then the transac- 
tion will be recorded as a transfer of funds from one account to 
another. 

This design feature— this apparent equivalence of accounts 
and budget categories — is unique to The Home Accountant. 
With the other programs you can track multiple accounts If 
you wish, but transfers from one account to another will have 
to be recorded in two separate steps.

Jarvis's documentation for FMS III, for example, recom- 
mends that if you wish to monitor cash expenditures as well as 
those from your checkbook, you specify a budget category 
called transfer — or some such. A check for cash can then be re- 
corded as an expenditure to transfer and a subsequent deposit 
from transfer to the cash account. A slush fund category like 
that should, theoretically, show up as a zero on the budget sum- 
mary report. 

Of the four programs other than Home Accountant, FMS 
III is the largest in accounting power — potentially larger than 
Home Accountant, though less automatic in its functioning. 
There is very little, in fact, that's automatic in FMS III, and 
that may constitute its main appeal to certain users. 

In FMS III, you do the file management yourself, much as 
you do with programs like word processors. It might be cus- 
tomary to organize your transactions into files by month and 
account name — say January checkbook or April Diners Club — 
and, in fact, the auditor module, a separate program that per- 
forms the budget analysis and reporting, requires that the 
names of files it scrutinizes begin with the first three letters of 
a month name ; but, really, you can do anything you want. You 
can create files that represent six months of frugality or a 
weekend of high living, or you can keep alternate versions of 
your books, on the same disk or not — whatever. This amount of 
flexibility is bound to have advantages for certain kinds of ap- 
plications, but for the novice it makes for more work and more 
opportunity for confusion and error. To Jarvis's credit, the pro- 
gram is loaded with fail-safe features that discourage the un- 
wary from overwriting or accidentally deleting files. 

Furthermore, while file management in FMS III is a roll- 
your-own affair, the data-entry module — like that of the other 
four programs under review here — is amply supplied with sim- 
plifying, keystroke-reducing features. We'll come to those 
presently. 

The Spectrum PFM, like The Home Accountant, invites 
you to record accounts for checking, cash, credit cards, and 
longer-term assets and liabilities. Like its competitor from 
Continental, PFM uses all this information to generate a com- 
prehensive statement of your net worth. However, like the sep- 
arate checking, cash, and credit modules that made up Spec- 
trum's older Home Finance Pak, these various accounts of 
yours remain aloof from one another and will not communi- 
cate except through the mediation of a transfer fund. 

Also, unlike The Home Accountant, in which accounts 
share file quarters with budget categories and hence are near- 
ly unlimited in number (actually that program allows a maxi- 
mum of a hundred accounts and/or budget categories) , the or- 
ganization of PFM is such that only seven accounts can be ac- 
commodated. If you want to take advantage of the program's 
ability to print a comprehensive personal balance sheet, you 
need two accoionts for miscellaneous assets and liabilities, and 
at least one for a checkbook, leaving you only four for any- 
thing else that's liquid— like cash and credit cards. 

With Chequemate, you can establish as many accounts as 
you wish, but they need to be on separate disks, and tracking 
them all against a common budget looks like it would be a diffi- 
cult proposition. When you go through Chequemate'a initiali- 
zation procedure, you're given the option of putting account 
and budget information on the program disk or on a data disk. 
Separation of data from program not only gives you expanded 
data space ; it also could be useful for a family that wants to 
track separate accounts against separate budgets. 

Chequemate, like Apple's PFM, is somewhat less exten- 
sive in scope than the other three programs. It doesn't, for ex- 
ample, have adequate provision for recording cash receipts or 
expenditures. 

It does, however, include a feature that's unique. It lets you 
record your bills— your accounts payable. When the gas bill ar- 
rives in the mail, you can call up Chequemate'a charge module 
and post the amount due, along with the appropriate budget 
category. Later on, when you get around to paying the bill, 
you'll go into the area of the program that records transac- 



tions, enter your check number, the payee, and the budget j 
category; at that point, all outstanding bills for the specified 
category will appear in a list near the bottom of the screen, 
each with its own program-generated number. To pay a bill 
off, you just type P plus the appropriate number, and the blot is 
removed from your record. 

This bill-recording feature gives you some primitive ability 
to track credit card accounts, although you may find its use in 
that connection a little awkward. For example. If you happen 
to owe $800 to the Bank of Grinnell, and you want to give them 
only $35, you'll be disappointed that Chequemate'a bill feature 
won't make the necessary adjustment. To use this feature, you 
must pay bills in full. Of course, you can record your credit 
purchases one by one as you make them. In the transaction 
module they'll appear as separate bills, and you can pay them 
all off at once. 

In any case, Chequemate'a charge module feature is 
unique, and could be a real plus if you're one who likes to mis- 
place, or just forget about, your bills. 

Apple's PFM is designed for one checking account, one 
cash account, and up to a dozen credit cards. Like the Spec- 
trum PFM and like FMS III, it's capable of passing informa- 
tion from one account to another by way of Intermediary bud- 
get categories. In the case of Apple's program, rather than 
make a deposit to, say, your cash account, you would record a 
negative expenditure. The program permits deposits only to 
your checking account, but will accommodate negative ex- 
penditures. 

The main virtue of Apple's PFM is its simplicity; designed 
for a relatively small-scale application, it is the easiest of the 
five programs to understand and the quickest in start-up time. 
The price of simplicity in this case is limitation of scope ; the 
program permits a maximum of two hundred transactions per 
month sorted into twenty-four budget categories. The number 
of transactions is probably adequate for most users, but the 
budget category limitation may prove constraining. 

By contrast. The Home Accountant, FMS III, and Spec- 
trum's PFM all permit one hundred categories, and Cheque- 
mate has no specified limit. The number of budget categories 
actually available on The Home Accountant is somewhat un- 
der one hundred, depending on how many asset, liability, and 
credit card accounts you've established. 

There are some important differences amongst these five 
programs with respect to the manner in which data is entered 
and displayed, and with respect to what kind of data may be 
entered. Not all, for example, provide you with the means to 
flag transactions for recall at tax time, and not all give you 
room to write a memorandum explaining the purpose of a 
transaction. 

With the exception of FMS III, the programs fall into two 
categories — those that organize your data in columns across 
the screen and those that organize it in rows. The tradeoff is 
this: if the program puts your data — check number, payee, 
amount, and so on — in columns, then it can display a good 
many transactions on the screen at once, and the screen will 
look somewhat like a page of your manual check register. If it 
puts each data field on a separate row, you'll be able to see 
only one transaction at a time. On the other hand, the row-dis- 
player offers the luxury of putting a lot more Information into 
each field. 

Both PFMa, Spectrum's and Apple's, fall into the column- 
displaying category, while The Home Accountant and Cheque- 
mate are row-oriented programs. Meanwhile, Jarvls has found 
a way to make FMS III straddle the fence by taking a basical- 
ly column-oriented approach but wrapping each transaction 
entry into two rows on the screen. 

Chequemate accepts input in seven fields: item number, 
date, payee (or source, as the case may be), amount, budget 
category, comment, and reconciliation status. There is no pro- 
vision for a tax flag. The item number begins with an alpha 
code that selects one of four transaction types: check, deposit, 
automatic teller withdrawal, and bank charge. The item num-

ber in each category increments automatically as a default op- 
tion. Defaults are also provided for date and reconciliation 
status — presumed to be outstanding. 

Chequemate also allows you to designate four-letter mac- 
ros representing frequently occurring transactions. In a sep- 
arate section of the progfram, you can establish a table of these 
standard entries ; for each standard entry you can put (lata in 
as many fields, with the exception of date and item number, as 
you wish. So the standard entry for rent or house payment 
might include an amount, whereas the entry for the loceil gro- 
cery store will probably not. In the latter case, you would plug 
in the appropriate amount when you call up the standard en- 
try to record a transaction. Hitting a question mark in the pay- 
ee field displays a list of your standard entry macros. 

Hitting an aaterisk in the comment field allows you to des- 
ignate a second budget category for your check. So, for exam- 
ple, if you write a check for groceries plus extra cash, you can 
do the appropriate accounting as a single transaction. The 
check may be split into no more than two categories, however. 

Above the transaction data, the program displays an ac- 
tion line, showing the commands available to you at any given 
moment. Below the transaction data appear your outstanding 
bills for the currently selected specified budget category. You 
can dump the contents of any screen to the printer with a con- 
trol-Y. 

Apple PFM'a transaction entry module lines up data in six 
fields across a single row per transaction. The fields are : num- 
ber, date, item, amount, tax, and budget category. There's no 
space for a memorandum. Items you designate as reconciled 
via the program's separate reconciliation module appear in 
subsequent displays with asterisks next to their transaction 
numbers. 

Like Chequemate, Apple PFM displays your current com- 
mand options at all times. It also displays your budget cate- 
gfory options. In the budget portion of the program you are 
asked to supply two-letter codes for each category. These two- 
letter codes appear at the bottom of your screen when it comes 
time to record a transaction. Your credit card options are dis- 
played similarly. 

Unlike Chequemate, the Apple PFM does not have any 
overtly indicated procedure for recording split transactions — 
those that require multiple accounting. The program, how- 
ever, makes no objection to your entering several checks with 
the same check number. So a tiny subterfuge on your part— the 
pretense of having written several checks with the same num- 
ber — will get the proper accounting done. 

Nor is there any provision for transactions, like an auto- 



matic teller withdrawal, that involve your checking account 
but not your checks ; but you can enter a check number of zero 
to cover such items. 

Checks, deposits, cash expenditures, and credit card pur- 
chases are all recorded from the same program module. You 
simply enter a C under transaction number for cash, a D for 
deposit, or the appropriate two-letter code for a charge card. 

A control-P will dump any screen to the printer. 

The Home Accountant stores your data in seven fields, in- 
cluding both a tax flag and ample space for a memorandum. 
On the checking account screen there's an eighth field to indi- 
cate reconciliation status; this defaults to outstanding. The 
transaction number increments automatically as a default. On 
the cash and credit card screens, where a check number type 
of entry wouldn't be appropriate, the system provides a slot for 
a six-character alphanumeric code, in case you should need 
one. Any transaction-entry screen can be printed with a single 
keystroke. 

Should you have forgotten the name of a budget category, 
the program offers a soundexlike routine to euisist you. Just en- 
ter the beginning letter of your category and the system will 
bring up the first category in its budget file beginning with that 
letter. If that's not the right one, hit the spacebar and you'll get 
the next one starting with that letter, and so on. When the right 
category comes up, you Just hit return to accept. If you hap- 
pen to have a hardcopy list of the budget category numbers — 
generated by the system at the time you establish your bud- 
get—you can enter the appropriate number on the category 
line and the program will substitute the category's name, 
again letting you hit return to confirm. 

The split transaction procedure for multiple disburse- 
ments works for any number of splits and works for cash and 
credit cards as well as for checks and deposits. Unfortunately, 
the program, like the Apple PFM, requires you to enter ir- 
regular transactions with the bank, like less cash from a de- 
posit, through the artificial means of a dummy check. 

For recurrent monthly bank transactions that don't in- 
volve a check — something like a transfer of funds from check- 
ing into savings — ^the program lets you set up as many £U9 five 
automatic transactions. As soon as you initialize a new month 
on the system, these transactions are posted to the appro- 
priate accounts. 

The Spectrum PFM uses a seven-column horizontal format 
to record your transaction data. Of all the programs in this sur- 
vey. Spectrum's is the one whose style most closely imitates 
that of your own checkbook. Up to eighteen transactions can be 
viewed onscreen at one time. At the bottom of the screen, the

program flashes the available command options ; some users 
may find the flashing display tiresome. 

Spectrum's seven columns include a tax flag and a recon- 
ciliation flag, but. alas, there's no room for a memo. There's 
also no room for more than four characters in the payee and 
budget category fields. The system, however, records inter- 
nally the full entries in these fields and prints them in full on 
hardcopy. 

Entries to the payee and category fields are made by way 
of prearranged numeric codes. Hitting M in the budget field al- 
lows a multiple disbursement to as many as ten budget cate- 
gories. 

Unfortunately, there is no longer a feature to display the 
prearranged category and payee codes from the transaction- 
entry screen. You have to remember them or keep a printout 
handy. The old Check Register program from Spectrum's 
Home Finance Pak was more convenient in this respect. 

Not all payee or category entries have to be predefined; 
there's a separate number available that codes for items of 
both kinds that don't come up often enough to merit their own 
number. The system prompts for details in such cases and 
handles the items just as it does coded Items. 

There's also a way to set up standard monthly transac- 
tions, like house or car payments. As with Chequemate's stan- 
dard transaction feature, these can be supplied with full data 
or not, as you choose. If you wish, you can leave certain fields 
blank and enter them manually through an edit procedure. 

An interesting novelty: this PFM does not have a separate 
reconciliation module. Rather It lets you scroll through your 
check register by way of the edit procedure and mark off items 
in at the bank. Then a single keystroke will summon a recon- 
ciled balance — ^the number that's supposed to agree with the 
bank's statement. If you don't require a formal reconciliation 
statement, this may be simpler than going through a separate 
reconcile program. 

FMS III presents a compromise between the column and 
row-oriented display techniques, revealing at any time the 
latest four transactions in your file, organized in six columns 
wrapped over two lines. 

The six available fields are number, date, item, explana- 
tion, amount, and budget category. No tax flag, but the provi- 
sion for memoranda is generous. 

Data entry is simplified by a system of three-letter macros, 
established during your initialization phase on the program. A 
question mark in the appropriate data-entry field will sum- 
mon a display of your macro codes and their meanings. 

In FMS III, as in the Spectrum PFM, you establish macros 
for both payee and budget category. Unlike in Spectrum's 
PFM, however, your codes in FMS III are linked. This means 
that if your check to Store Q nearly always buys a can of paint, 
you can enter the appropriate macro for Store Q and jvust hit re- 
turn in the category field. On the other hand, if you have occa- 
sion to purchase toothpaste from Q or get your paint from R, 
you can override the default linkage and use separate macros 
in each field. 

FMS III recognizes five kinds of transactions, symbolized 
by #, D, M, C, and *. The first is for checks (or cash or credit 
card expenditures, depending on what kind of account you're 
monitoring) . The D is for deposit and the C for charge — mis- 
cellaneous transactions with the bank that don't involve your 
writing a check. 

The M is for memo, which is something of a novelty in these 
home finance programs. Jarvis's documentation indicates that 
the memo option is provided strictly for Informational pur- 
poses — for reminders of financial obligations, perhaps, or 
some such. The transaction so entered has no effect on your ac- 
count balance and is ignored by that part of the system that au- 
dits your accoimt for summary reports or budget analysis. 

The last transaction type, indicated by the asterisk, is for 
multiple disbursement, and here FMS III really seems a little 
clumsy. If you want to split a check between groceries and 
cash, you have to set up special budget categories to receive 



the split transaction. In other words, if you're in the habit of 
getting some of your pin money straight from the bank and 
some from the local market, you need at least two budget cate- 
gories for cash. This might be all right if the audit routine then 
lumped the two categories back together in its report — but it 
does not. 

On the matter of reports, both printed and screened, here's 
how the five programs compare. 

Apple's PFM has no print routine as such, only an option to 
dump the current screen. That may well be its most serious 
limitation, since a whole pile of screen dumps — complete with 
all those prompts that are so handy in their proper context — 
does not make for ideal documentation. 

On the other hand, the program is loaded with search fea- 
tures. There are five types of search criteria that can be desig- 
nated, either singly or in combination: entry type (all entries, 
a range of check numbers, all deposits, all cash, or a specific 
credit card) , entry date (current month or a specified range of 
months), specific budgets, payee, and additional criteria. The 
last of these brings up other options— reconciled only, unrec- 
onciled only, or tax deductible only. The search routine will 
also sort the items it finds, if you desire. 

So if you don't require comprehensive printouts, this search 
power combined with the screen-dump capability may prove 
adequate after all. 

The Apple PFM also will give you lo-res bar graphs of ac- 
tual versus projected expenditures in specific budget categor- 
ies for a whole year or in all categories for a given month. 

With respect to searching and printing, Chequemate stands 
in pretty direct opposition to the Apple PFM. It has no search 
routine as such, but it's amply provided with the capacity to 
generate printed reports. In place of a search routine, Cheque- 
mate offers a review option that will let you scroll through your 
transactions, or a range thereof designated by transaction 
number, one by one. Because this sequential review process 
can become time-consuming as your files grow, and since not 
everybody needs their entire financial life socked away on disk 
for posterity, the program provides the option of deleting rec- 
onciled items. 

Chequemate' s hardcopy report options include a check 
list — between designated dates — sorted, if you wish, by trans- 
action number, category, or payee. The check list includes a 
summation of checks, deposits, automatic teller transactions, 
and bank charges, each category subdivided into cleared and 
outstanding. 

Other reports include a budget list, an actual versus pro- 
jected budget comparison — for a specified time Interval — a list 
of your standard entry macros, and a list of outstanding bills. 

Chequemate also generates hi-res bar graphs for onscreen 
budget analysis. 

FMS III generates the following printouts: a complete 
transaction list for a specified group of files, a list of recon- 
ciled items, a list of unreconciled items, a summary of a trial 
reconciliation, the results of an onscreen search request, an au- 
dit report, and a budget report. The audit report is a summa- 
tion of expenditures or receipts in specified categories, while 
the budget report performs the same function and compares 
results to projected amounts. 

FMS Ill's search routines act on only one search criterion 
at a time, rather than performing more selective searches the 
way some of the other programs do. The search criterion can 
be any of the program's six data fields and can cover as many 
as sixteen different files. There's an expanded search mode, in 
which the user needs to designate only the first few letters of a 
search criterion. The user can display search results either in 
a compacted one-line format or in the familiar two-line wrap- 
around style of the data-entry module. 

The Home Accountant performs searches based on multi- 
ple criteria — virtually any grouping of data fields you choose — 
and it prints a hardcopy activity report for a specified time pe- 
riod, either in toto or restricted to transactions meeting speci- 
fied criteria. The activity report can cover checking, cash, or

SOFIA

credit accounts, either singly or in combination. 

Other printed report options include an income and ex- 
pense summary for a month or range of months, various kinds 
of budget reports, and a personal balance sheet; this last 
comes in three flavors: for the current month only, compared 
to budget, and compared to the most recent month. A hi-res 
bar graph budget analysis is also available. 

The Home Accountant also prints checks on standard forms 
and posts the transactions appropriately. And last, but not 
least, if you have an MX-80 printer, Home Accountant auto- 
matically sends the control characters necessary to generate 
132-column reports in condensed format. 

Spectrum's PFM, like Apple's PFM and like The Home Ac- 
countant, is capable of searching on multiple criteria. Unique- 
ly, it allows you to specify a range in any field, so that you 
could, for example, ferret out all transactions between the 
amounts of one hundred and two hundred dollars filed in bud- 
get categories 9 through 21 inclusive. 

Like The Home Accountant, Spectrum's program also 
prints checks and produces a personal balance sheet. Its print- 
ed budget reports offer you a choice between seeing your vari- 
ance from budget indicated in absolute amounts or in percen- 
tages. 

Its graphic budget analysis goes a little farther than The 
Home Accountant's; in addition to a line graph showing 
amount spent in a given category for a range of months, it also 
offers you a linear regression plot. 

So where does all this information leave you? Here are a 
few final words, complete with subjective impressions, about 
each of these five programs: 

Apple's Personal Finance Manager is a pleasure to use. 
While somewhat limited in scope— it's really an expanded 
checkbook keeper as opposed to a full-fledged single-entry ac- 
counting system — it's an exceedingly well-made program. You 
can hardly get lost, confused, or annoyed in it. Its $80 price is 



reasonable, but if printed reports are vital to you, you'll want 
to look elsewhere. 

At $39.95, Masterworks Software's Chequemate is the bar- 
gain of the bunch. If you don't require printed checks or per- 
sonal balance sheets, and you don't need full accounting of 
cash and credit transactions, this may be ideal for you. 
Chequemate is the only one of these programs that provides 
for the posting of bills as well as payments. 

Computerized Management Systems 's Financial Manage- 
ment System III should appeal to the person who wants maxi- 
mum freedom to manipulate and organize financial data. At 
$120 it may put a strain on the very budget it's meant to man- 
age. 

Spectrum Software's Personal Finance Master is an ambi- 
tious program that suffers only by comparison to The Home 
Accountant. Within its scope It does a great deal of account- 
ing, but it does it less easily, less gracefully, and less quickly 
than The Home Accountant. What's most unfortunate is that 
the person who really needs the kinds of accounting services 
that PFM can provide will probably need to track more than 
the seven accounts available in PFM. PFM'a price is a rea- 
sonable $74.95. 

Of the five programs reviewed here. The Home Account- 
ant is the most thorough and powerful. Considering how much 
it can do, it's remarkably easy to use. Its price is also $74.95.

Softalk Presents The Bestsellers 



The midwinter doldrums settled with vengeance into the 
Apple marketplace in the month of February. Typical com- 
ments on business from the retailers ranged from "not bad for 
a February" to "cruddy," this last from a suburban Chicago 
dealer. 

In general, the downturn was no gfreater than normal after 
the holiday buying splurge of November through January. In- 
terestingly enough, sales of the Apple III and Apple III soft- 
ware were not affected by the slump. The Apple III continues 
to perform better than it ever has. although the value of that 
comparison is mitigated by the machine's previous poor 
showing. 

Starting next month, Softalk will include in its Bestseller 
lists a special category for Apple III software. That list may 
have added interest just from the fact that VisiCalc won't be 
the perennial leader. The Softalk list measures aftermarket 
sales and VisiCalc is included in the sale of the basic machine, 
thus foreclosing it from consideration. 

Preliminary sampling indicates that Personal Filing Sys- 
tem III from Software Publishing Corporation presently leads 
the pack, with Apple Writer III, Mailing List Manager, and 
Word Juggler positioned next. The former two progframs are 
from Apple and the latter is from Quark Engineering. 

In the Apple 11 marketplace, VisiCalc retained its cus- 
tomary position at the top of the heap; but it was pressed for 
that honor for the first time in months. Wizardry, a program 
that's becoming a success story all its own (as documented in 
the March/ April issue of Softline) , vaulted into second place 
just before the release of a new scenario. 

Wizardry's showing was even more remarkable in that only 
three entertainment programs made the top ten places, and 
Wizardry is more expensive than the others. 

Snack Attack dropped from fourth to fifth, but remains 
strong; and David's Midnight Magic clung to tenth, a drop of 
three places. 

Dropping from second to third is that other surprise pro- 
gram, On-Line's Superscribe II, now to be known as Screen 
Writer. The program was not shipped for most of the month be- 
cause of legal entanglements about the name, but there were

already so many in the pipeline that it clung to a high position 
on the charts. 

Personal Filing System dipped from third to fourth but re- 
mained the leader in the red-hot database competition. There 
were some changes there, however, as DB Master vaulted past 
VisiFile to be the second-ranked database manager. New com- 
petition from an old source also surfaced, as the revised Data 
Factory reappeared on the Top Thirty list for the first time in 
several months. Micro Lab's entry has a long way to go, but 
it's clearly back in the running.

agement System III all continue to show strength. 

Although the arcade genre is currently taking a back seat to 
business software, it's providing some of the more interesting 
developments. Broderbund released Star Blazer, the newest 
from Alien Rain author Tony Suzuki; and although it had lim- 
ited distribution for a limited time in February, it still was the 
highest ranking new game at fourteenth. Alien Rain, under its 
original name of Apple Galaxian, was the first program ever to 
dethrone VisiCalc from first place. 

Broderbund had another new entry in the Top Thirty in

Twerps, the newest from Sirius, leaped into fifteenth and 
gave the company three in the Top Thirty, Gorgon and Sneak-

Another new program to the Top Thirty represented an old

resided in the top ten, took two tries in his own company be-

The Leader in Apple Graphics 





by Chris Jochumson and 
Mark Pelczarski 

Now anyone can put profes- 
sional graphics into their own 
programs. The Graphics Magi- 
cian contains machine language 
animation routines that use the 
same techniques as most of the 
popular Apple arcade games. 
Three animation editors let you 
design your figures, their paths, , 
and assemble animation with up 
to 32 independent objects. 
Also included is a hi-res 
picture/object builder that lets you store hundreds of 100-color pictures 
on a single disk and recall them quickly from your own programs. These 
exact routines are being used in the new graphic adventure games from 
Scott Adams' Adventure International. Plus, a new shape editor greatly ex- 
tends the capabilities of Apple shape tables with multicolors and angles 
that are preserved on scaling. All design of graphics is done through menu- 
driven editors; to use in your programs, just attach our machine language 
routines. Extensive documentation makes this package easy to use for the 
beginning programmer, yet flexible enough for the most advanced.

a 3'D Graphics Tablet 



This incredible new device pro- 
duced by Micro Control Systems, 
Inc. functions as a standard graphics 
tablet in two dimensions, until you 
decide to expand to real-world 
3-dimensional input. Now you can 
trace 3-D objects, either real or 
imaginary, then view and modify 
them in 3-D perspective with your 
Apple computer. The 16"xl3" 
tablet comes with a customized 



version of The Complete Graphics 
System, specifically designed to 
accept input from three dimen- 
sions. In addition, the Space Tablet 
includes machine language soft- 
ware that allows you to design 
your own programs using 3-D in- 
put. This unique hardware/software 
package also comes at a very pal- 
atable price " half the cost of most 
standard graphics tablets. See your

THE COMPLETE 
GRAPHICS 

by Mark Pelczarski ^ ^ 

This improved version of the already pop- 
ular Complete Graphics System is a com- 
plete and Ccisy to use 2-dimensional and 3- 
dimensional graphics design package for 
the non-programmer. Create color 
screen images with lines, circles, el- 
lipses, automatic 108-color filling, and 
"paintbrushes". Use high-resolution 
text anywhere on the screen in dozens 
of colors. Create and edit shape tables, 
and shrink pictures for multiple dis- 
plays. Amazing 3-D routines let yoi^ 
draw the parts of 3-D objects on the 
screen, then assemble, rotate, and edit 
them visually in true 3-D perspective. 
All the software is easy to use, even 
for the novice. Programmers can use 
the graphics, and even our machine 
language routines, in their own soft- 
ware. This one package gives you more 
than most other graphics software 
packages combined. Find out why The 
Complete Graphics System is top rated 
in Apple graphics.

Like nothing else on the market, this unique sof 
package allows you to escape the "coloring book*" 
proach to computer graphics, giving you a palette of 
colors and 96 different brushes for creating or enhanci^ 
color computer images. Also included is a magnifying 
mode that lets you magnify images 2 or 4 times and edit 
them point-by-point, a "picture packer" that lets you 
store images in a fraction of the space normally taken, and 
a set of tricks that allow you to reverse colors, perform 
mirror images, and move parts of screen images around 
and to other pictures. Special Effects is great as a stand- 
alone package -- or the perfect complement to 
The Complete Graphics System.

teenth with the fading Apple Panic. 

The Business 10 underwent no radical changes wlfh the ex- 
ception of the reappearance of Data Factory, as mentioned 
before. 

That was not the case with Word Processors 5, where 
Magic Window and Supertext II regained the list. Magic Win- 
dow, after a one-month hiatus, jumped into second. 

The story on Supertext is apparently that many users who 
were waiting for the new 40/80 column version to appear final- 
ly decided to make the plunge with the old version. 

The only major change in the Home 10 was the appearance 
of Apple Speller, Sensible Software's dictionary program for 
Apple word processors. It came from nowhere to capture fifth 
and nearly made the Top Thirty list. Howard Software's Tax 
Preparer continues to dominate the tax packages and ASC//

Express and Data Capture 4.0 continue neck-and-neck in the 
communications environment. 

Biggest change in the Hobby 10 list w£is the continued climb 
of Zoo77i Grafix. The program edged its way into the Top 
Thirty as well as reaching third on the Hobby 10. Also notable 
was the decline of DOS 3.S io sixth, perhaps Indicating that the 
changeover to the new operating system is finally nearing 
completion. 

As one might suppose, Wisardry dominated the Fantasy 5 
game list. But a new contender hove into view in Bob Clardy's 
Apventure to Atlantis, which wrested second place from 

Ultima. 

Biggest news in the Adventure 5 category was the release of 

Apple-franchlsed retail stores representing approximately 6.9 percent of 
all sales of Apples and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in 
the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early In March to ascertain their sales lead- 
ers for the month of February. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was number of sales made — 
such other criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer 
retailer, and personal preference of the individual respondents were not 
considered. 

Respondents in March represented every geographical area of the conti- 
nental United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted In 
the index number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. 
The index number is an arbitrary measure of relative strength of the 
programs listed. Index numbers are correlative only for the month in which 
they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index rating of SO in one 
month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in another 
month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus-or-minus 5.4 percent, which 
translates roughly into the theoretical possibility of a change of 3.89 points, 
plus or minus, in any index number.

Time Zone, the magnum opus of On-Une Systems. The pro- 
gram was generally favorably received despite its high price 
and the well-publicized existence of some bugs in the first re- 
lease version. 

Castle Wolfenstein continued to lead the Strategy 5 list, but 
two old favorites— Sargron // and Robot War— regained the list 
in second and third place. Also new to the list was Southern 
Command, Strategic Simulation's most successful effort at in-

The future belongs to microcomputers. 

At SSI, we apply tomorrow's programming 
techniques to re-create some classic battles of 
the past. As proof, we offer our latest games 
for the Apple® computer*: PURSUIT OF THE 
GRAF SPEE and THE ROAD TO GETTYSBURG. 

PURSUIT OF THE GRAF SPEE™ 

transports you back to the South Atlantic of 
1 939 so you can command the deadly German 
pocket battleship to sink enemy merchant 
vessels while eluding British and French war- 
ships. Or you can direct the Allied fleet to 
locate and destroy the scourge of your ship- 
ping lanes. 

If you're familiar with Computer Bismarck 
— which has become something of a phe- 
nomenon in gaming circles — you owe it to 
yourself to try this game. Like its older brother, 
PURSUIT OF THE GRAF SPEE has all the thrill 
of the chase, heightened by the complexity 
and richness of detail such as complete ship 
ratings for speed and strength, fuel restric- 
tions, refueling capabilities, and realistic rules 
governing sighting and visibility. 

However, we've also added a remarkable 
tartical combat system that accounts for 
gunfire accuracy, torpedoes and smoke 
screens. When it comes to calculating ship 
damage and battle results, you simply leave 
all the work to the computer, which does 
everything instantly and unerringly. 



If you're so inclined, you can even engage 
in combat by using miniatures. Enter the 
results of your off-line battle and the computer 
will incorporate them into the strategic game. 

This simulation contains two scenarios, all 
played on a I9-by-!9 square-grid map of the 
South Atlantic displayed in colorful Hi-Res 
graphics. The first recounts the entire 25-day 
historic chase, where shadowing, pursuit and 
elusive maneuvers are your primary concerns. 
The second simulates the Battle of the River 
Plate, where the Graf Spee — already located 
— must deal with three British ships. 

Finally, the solitaire scenario lets you match 
wits against the computer as it directs the 
Graf Spee. We wish you luck. 

THE ROAD TO GETTYSBURG™ takes 
you even further back in time, to that fateful 
battle of 1863. This board-assisted computer 
simulation is designed to let you experience 
the actual feel of a Civil War command. Like a 
real Union or Confederate general, you must 
deal with the slow and frustrating dispatch 
system — your only means of communication 
with your troops. Knowledge of troop posi- 
tions and estimates of enemy strength are 
only as good as your reconnaissance patrols. 

The computer plays the individual corps 
commanders who implement your orders.

on their historical leadership ratings, 
they may misinterpret or even disobey your 
dirertives. 

Before you move a corps, you must consider 
the effects of weather, terrain, corps morale, 
fatigue, and even straggling on your troops. 

THE ROAD TO GETTYSBURG simulates 
the entire week-long campaign. Depending 
on your strategies, the town of Gettysburg 
may not be involved at all. 

For those who want to dispense with long- 
range planning, we've provided a scenario 
that just simulates the three-day Battle of 
Gettysburg. There is also a solitaire scenario 
so you can play anytime against a tough 
computer opponent. 

Again, you can use miniatures to resolve all 
battles if you so desire. 

This game is made for all you avid strategists 
out there. After you're done playing it, you'll 
really know the pleasure and pain of being 
a Robert E. Lee I
