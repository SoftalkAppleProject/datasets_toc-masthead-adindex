Yep, it's time for yet another contest with 
turkeys in it. 

Last November, in what was one of the most 
popular (albeit silly) contests ever, readers were 
asked to count the number of turkeys that ap- 
peared in the magazine. The correct number 
was 349. A lot of people came up with that 
number but figured they had missed one along 
the way. After all, 350 is such a nice round 
number, why would we choose 349? 

The truth is that we started out with 350 mr- 
keys, but one of them strayed on the way to the 
contest page. Well, after a year of searching, 
we finally found the last turkey, and we'd like 
very much for her to come and join us for a 
Thanksgiving feast. 

Unfortunately, she thinks we want to roast 
and serve her as dinner. The object of this 
month's contest is to chase Tammy the Turkey 
to the dinner table where all the feasting will 
take place. 

The Chase Begins. Yep, this contest actual- 
ly has some rules. 

1 . The object is to move through the board 
so that you and Tammy arrive at the dinner ta- 
ble on square forty at the same time. Not one 
square shy or one square too far, but exactly on 
square forty. 

2. Notice that you begin on square one and 
Tammy begins on square three. She already has 
a lead, but as you chase her she might get far- 
ther ahead, or she might get behind you. Don't 
let that confuse you. The object is to get your- 
self and her to square forty. Somehow. 

3. You make the first move. On each turn, 
you're allowed to move one, two, or three 
squares either forward or backward. Depending 
on how many squares you move on your turn. 
Tammy moves the same number in the same di- 
rection. If you move two forward, she moves 
two forward. 

4. Tammy moves in two phases. First, she 
moves the number of squares you move. Next, 
she moves the number of squares that appears 
on the square she lands on. Thus, if you move 
two squares forward, she moves two squares 
forward. If the number on the square she lands 



on is -f-4, for example, Tammy then moves an 
additional four squares forward and stops. You, 
however, ignore the numbers printed on the 
squares. Only when Tammy finishes her second 
set of moves does it become your turn to move. 
In short, for each one of your moves, Tammy 
moves twice. 

5. You're allowed to move in only one di- 
rection per turn. If you want to move three 
squares, you must go either forward or back- 
ward; no fair going two forward and one 
backward and having Tammy move three for- 
ward. 

6. It is legal to move backward. If you do so, 
Tammy must move backward also. 

7. You must move on a turn; no fair moving 
zero squares and having Tammy move accord- 
ing to the square she's already on. You gotta 
keep moving. 

8. Tammy must land on square forty at the 
end of her two-phase move. That means if you 
move forward three squares to land on square 
forty, Tammy must move forward three squares 
and then make her second set of moves (depend- 
ing on the number printed on that square) to 
land on square forty. 

Send in your entry with your moves like 
this: 



I move: 

+ 3 to square 4 
+ 1 to square 5 
- 2 to square 3 



Tammy moves: 

+ 3, +6 to square 12 
+ 1 , - 4 to square 9 
-2, - 1 to square 6 



The second number in each of Tammy's 
moves refers to the number printed on the 
square she lands on at first. In the first move, 
for example, she moves ahead three (-1-3) and 
lands on square six, which tells her to go for- 
ward another six squares (-1-6) to square 12, 
where she rests and waits for you to take your 
turn. (Note: These are not necessarily the cor- 
rect moves. But they might be. Who knows?) 

The primary goal of this contest is to finish

And good game authors 
are reaping large rewards. 

If you want to begin to 
understand and create 
arcade games, this is the 
best place to start. 

Jeffrey Stanton, a 
master of 3-D graphics, 
takes you from game 
concept through Lo-Res 
and Hi-Res color graphics 
at the machine language 
level. Stanton also covers 




bit-mapped design, 
scoring, laser fire and 
bomb drops in both single 
screen and scrolling 
games.

it alphabetically in an 
easy-to-use, results- 
oriented way. You'll find 
out everything you need 



to know about DOS, 
BASIC, programming, 
user's groups, software 
and peripherals (including 
a complete listing of 
manufacturers). 

This book is as indis- 
pensable to your Apple 
as the power cord.

the chase successfully without going insane. In 
case of a tie, the one who gets Tammy to the 
table in the fewest number of moves will be the 
winner. This only makes sense because we're 
hungry, and we don't want to be kept waiting 
forever. 

Just to be able to brag to your friends that 
you finished this contest should be enough re- 
ward. But in case it isn't (it never is), we'll 
award $200 worth of computer goodies made by 
our advertisers to the winner. A $200 spending 
spree on us. 

That's it, troops. Entries must be post- 
marked by December 15, 1983. So get your ten- 
nis shoes on, chase Tammy, and send in your 
entry to Softalk Turkey Trot, Box 60, North 
Hollywood, CA 91603. Go for it! We wanna 
eat!

Contest Winners: Job Hunt Ended 



You see? It does pay to keep all those moldy 
old Softalks around. When it came to solving 
the August Job Hunt contest, back issues were a 
must. No, we weren't trying to increase our 
back-issue sales; many people who didn't have 
them around borrowed them from people 
who did. 

If that didn't work, some contestants phoned 
the people who appeared in the contest and 
asked what their former occupations were. To- 
tally legal. 

Out of the pile of entries in the "What They 
Were" category, only three emerged as perfect, 
and that of Derek LeLash (Armonk, NY) was 
drawn by the random number generator as the 
winner. Still sitting inside the RNG are Dianne 
Lee (Redondo Beach, CA) and Mark Selwyn 



(Boston, MA), who also had perfect entries. 

LeLash was quite surprised that he won, this 
being "the first contest I ever entered." Info- 
com's Starcross and The Witness are what 
LeLash picked up as prizes from Software City 
in nearby Mount Kisko. 

In the "What They Should Have Been" 
category, readers sent in entries listing what 
they thought might have been the previous oc- 
cupation of each person pictured — based solely 
on appearance — and quite a few matched the 
choices we made. Our choices were sealed in 
three envelopes and locked in the contestmeis- 
ter's secret vault (the bottom desk drawer). 

Alexander Veder (Layton, UT) matched ten 
of the twenty occupations with our choices, the 
most by anyone in that category. On his contest 



entry, Veder wrote that he wouldn't decide 
what he wanted to win until he actually won. 
"That's because I hardly ever win anything," 
he says. "I stay away from most of your con- 
tests, but, if it looks easy enough, I'll give it 
a try." 

When informed that he had won, Veder was 
so surprised that he still couldn't think of what 
he wanted. He finally buckled under the pres- 
sure (contestmeister: "Look, pal, if you don't 
want it, we'll give it to someone else") and de- 
cided to spend the $100 at the Computer Store 
in Ogden, Utah, on an eighty-column card with 
64K for his Apple He. 

The answers for both categories of the con- 
test are given at the end of the contest wimiers' 
section.

Contest Notes. In the "What They Were" 
category, if you didn't know what occupation 
someone held, you guessed, based on which oc- 
cupations were left over by the time you fin- 
ished filling in the ones you knew. No way of 
faking it; either you knew or you didn't. The 
"What They Should Have Been" category was 
a different story. If you just couldn't place 
someone in a particular occupation, you also 
guessed. But in this category, contestants were 
given a bit more flexibility— they made up oc- 
cupations. 

Among the occupations for TG's Ted Gil- 
lam were a lawyer who does some tacky 
commercial, mortician, Watergate investigator, 
Mafia hit man, congressman, the original May- 
tag repairman, and city editor of the Los Ange- 
les Tribune, where he oversees ranks of zealous 
reporters. 

Guesses for Muse's Ed Zaron seemed to 
follow a pattern: nitrous oxide addict, a he-man 
detective-type like Magnum P.I., undercover 
FBI agent, professional assassin, Cuban diplo- 
mat, macho disco dance teacher in the middle 
seventies, loan shark, aluminum siding 
salesman, deposed Generalissimo Ed Zaron, 
CIA agent, and man convicted of seventeen 
counts of bribery, forgery, and conspiracy. 

Two people whom almost everybody agreed 
on for former occupations were Sir-tech's Fred 
Sirotek (retired), Sirius's Jerry Jewell (former 
rock musician), Cathy Carlston of Broderbund 
(housewife), Syntauri's Ellen Lapham (Swedish 
women's basketball coach), and Terry Bradley 
of Sirius (construction manager). 

Oddly enough, a large majority of con- 
testants agreed with us that Infocom's Marc 
Blank looks like nothing other than what he 
really used to be— a medical student. Imagine it: 
Zork Trilogy— The Adventures of Dr. Blank. 
Sounds more like the title of a fifties B movie. 

Attention, Cathy Carlston: Craig Earls 
(Lancaster, CA) has your number! "She's a 
looker, but she has me stumped." 

Attention, Cathy Carlston, Part II: Is there 
something we don't know about? Rob Salkowitz 
(Philadelphia, PA) reports "A classified gov- 
ernment secret for twenty-five years, Cathy 
Carlston is the first human ever to be hatched 
from a chicken's egg." Watch it, Rob. 
WAPCWTP (Women Against People Compar- 
ing Women to Pouhry) is looking for you. 

Assorted Contest Bits. For everyone's 
reading enjoyment, here's a list of other occu- 
pations the sports in the contest were thought to 
have held. Get out that August issue, turn to 
page 4 with the pictures on it, and see if you 
don't agree. In the case of more than one person

Fastalk is a quick guide to popular, specialized, 
new, and classic software. When you need a particu- 
lar kind of program or just want to see what's new, 
Fastalk is the place to look for fast answers. 

If a program has been reviewed in So/talk, it car- 
ries the issue date of the review in italics at the end of 
its listing, and the capsule description given reflects 
the published review. 

A new software entry, which must be of profes- 
sional quality to be included, is designated by a check 
mark preceding its name. A new entry loses its check 
mark after its first appearance and drops out of 
Fastalk after one to three appearances (depending on 
genre) if it fails to gain popularity. 

A bullet preceding a title indicates a program that 
Softalk has designated as a classic, based on its ability 
to stand up over time, its significance for its time 
(breaking new ground or introducing a new genre), or 
its archetypal qualities. 

Other entries in Fastalk are there either by virtue 
of current activity (the programs are selling at least as 
much as the least-selling entry on any of the bestseller 
charts) or because they are representative of the best 
of programs for a special interest or need (such as 
card games or non-Basic-specific language terminal 
programs). 

Softalk may arbitrarily omit any package from 
Fastalk, whether or not it meets the foregoing 
criteria.

JUST BECAUSE YOU PICK AN APPLE, 



DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO 
BUY THE WHOLE ORCHARD. 



The only thing more important than 
having your printer compatible with 
your personal computer is having it 
compatible with you. 

Which is why mixing an Okidata 
printer with your Apple computer is 
more like mixing apples with apples 
than you'd think. 

More Printers. More Printing. For 
instance, Okidata gives you eight high 
performance printers to choose from. 
Apple only gives you four. We give you 
two-color capabilities on some models. 
They give you basic black and white. 
With Okidata you can get three print 
modes. With Apple, you're stuck with 
one. Our speeds go up to an incredible 
350 cps. Theirs stop at 1 20. 

As for quality, our correspondence 
quality rivals the best daisywheels. And 



at up to 80 cps. Their letter quality 
printer is a daisywheel but moves along 
at only 40 cps. We also give you a full 
year's warranty on our print head. They 
give you 90 days. And we bring you the 
lowest warranty claim rate in the indus- 
try: less than 1/2%. 

And More: Personal Touch & Plug 'n 
Play. With Okidata's Microline 92, 93 
and 84 printers, you can get Personal 
Touch. A downline loading software 
package that lets you print personalized 
characters, customized symbols and 
typefaces, even foreign languages. From 
Apple, you only get the hardware. 

Of course all Okidata printers are 
compatible with Apple computers. But 
now, all Okidata Microline printers in- 
terface in a matter of minutes, thanks to 
our new Plug 'n Play interface kit. 



So, the choice is yours. Wait for a bet- 
ter Apple to ripen. Or pick Okidata.

WITH SAMS NEW APPLE GAMES

is in winning. So whether you're on experienced player or 
beginner, Sams new gomes give you a lot of entertainment 
for a little money— only $29.95 each. 

In REGATTA, you sail a boat around one of four lake 
courses displayed in full-screen, hi-res graphics. By work- 
ing your soils and centerboord as indicated in the corner of 
your screen, you race in real-time against a clock or 
competitor. The game moves quickly so you must think fast.

make it easy to learn and play. Gome paddles, joysticks 
and color monitor ore optional. No. 26147. 

BERMUDA RACE is the ultimate test for sailing enthusiasts 
of all levels. Unlike REGATTA, you have time to think out 
every move. To play, you respond to the conditions indi- 
cated on the screen by changing your sail capacity, cen- 
terboord depth and compass direction. Then by pressing a 
key, you can check your progress on a vivid, hi-res graphics 
map. Soil alone or against a competitor But watch out! A 
few compass degrees can moke the winning difference or 
leave you stranded in the Bermuda Triangle. No. 26129. 



If you like battle gomes, you're going to love SPUD. The 
object is to shoot at the Spud, moving it away from you and 
toward your competitor If it touches his fort, he's destroyed. 
The Spud itself acts like a hot potato as it bounces bock and 
forth between forts. Three kinds of ammunition let you 
move the Spud, destroy your competitor's shield, intercept 
shots, gain bonus points, and more. It's hi-res, high-action 
in its purest form, and fun for all ages. Includes single 
player game. Game paddles, joy sticks and color monitor

Make beautiful music. Everyone loves 

-music. And any ona wJio-has-eve r h u m m ed 

a tune can write one, now. Scarborough has 
taken the universal language of music and 
developed a software program that makes it 
fun and easy to write songs for budding 
composers of any age. 

Even those who don't recognize a single 
note can be composing songs in 15 minutes. 
Simulated piano roll graphics and on-screen 
commands serve as a guide every step of 
the way — from scales and rhythm to more 
complex musical forms and theory. 

With Songwriter, composing songs is as 
simple as "do-re-mi." Write a song, change, 
delete or add a note, change tempo and 
teach the computer to repeat musical 
motifs. Ev e n s a v e composit i ons to p la y back 
through the computer or your home stereo. 
For added fun, there is also a library of 28 
popular songs to listen to and experiment 
with, as well as a series of educational 
activities for adults and children. 

Songwriter is like a word processor for 
music that will bring the whole family back 
to the computer, again and again — because 
Songwriter encourages experimentation 
and makes the whole process fun. Isn't that 
why you bought a personal computer in the 
first place? 

Every kid has a song in his heart. (So does 
the "kid" in every parent!) Help yours 
express it with Songwriter.

Our competition hot)( 
we keep a low profile b 
our new disk drive. 






And we plan to. Because our new low profile design saves space. 
(It's just half the height of ordinary drives.) But compact size is 
only one of the many improvements we've made in our Apple®- 
compatible disk drive, the MicroDrive II.™ Our advanced mechani- 
cal design gives you greater reliability, plus faster start-up and 
access time. And an automatic disk eject mechanism makes 
disk removal a snap. 

We're also the only non-Apple® drive 
that's FCC type approved. 

That's right. We're small, but we're good. So good that we're the 
only non-Apple® drive certified to comply with FCC Rules 
governing radio interference. (Operate your computer with a; 



non-certified peripheral and you could cause interference to TV- 
and radio reception in your neighborhood.) So good that our 
MicroDrive II, 5V4 subsystem is fully guaranteed. Its one year 
warranty covers both parts and labor. 

Our new MicroDrive II puts the byte on competition. 

You can put two of ours in the same space as one of theirs, you 
buy a computer to save time, why not buy a drive that saves 
space? (And that gives you top performance.)

How a fireman and 

a broken leg 

made sc^h^re simple. 



^^^^hat does a fireman 

▼ ▼ know about designing 
software? Nothing. Usually. 




Meet Dennis Jarvis, a fire- 
man from Southern California. 
About five years ago, Dennis 
was injured in a fire-related 
accident and was confined to 
the house for about six months. 
To keep him occupied, Dennis' 
wife bought him a gift. A 
computer. 

Dennis had never used a 
computer before. But he found 
that he had a natural ability to 
understand aU aspects of 
computer usage. 

Before long, Dennis was 
writing his own programs. 
And Basic Accounting from 
Firefighter Software was born. 

It was brilliant. Naturally . 

THE IDEA BEHIND 
BASIC ACCOUNTING. 

What's so innovative about 
the software is it's simplicity. 

Unlike other programs, it 
requires no understanding of 
basic accounting theory. It's 
virtually impossible for you to 
type something that'll damage 
either the program itself or 
any data you've entered. 

BUT IT'S FAR MORE 
THAN JUST EASY. 

Because Dermis made his 
Basic Accounting simpler 
doesn't mean it's not smarter, 
too. He's added more prac- 
tical features and capabilities 
than the number-one seller. 



Dennis' program allows for 
an unlimited number of in- 
dividual financial transactions, 
and all balances are 
automatically updated after 
each entry. 

Dennis added Password 
Protection. So your financial 
records aren't open to just 
anyone. 

You can print checks of any 
size and format. 

Plus, Firefighter can create 
a wider variety of on-screen 
and printed reports. 

AND THE LIST OF SMART 
FEATURES GOES ON... 

Dennis? He returned to the 
Department soon after his leg 
healed, but remains the 
spearhead of Firefighter 
Software. 

In fact, in his never-ending 
efforts to make Firefighter 
the most personal, most 
supported software, Dennis 
has set-up a telephone hotline 
especially for you. Standing 
by to answer your questions 
and provide consultation. 
That's just Dennis' way of 
insuring Firefighter remains 
superior, always simpler yet 
smarter.

Discussion 



Format for Loyalty 

I have been a Softalk subscriber for about a year 
and a half, and in that time I have seen a lot of 
letters praising and lambasting publishers, re- 
tailers, and other purveyors of software. Today 
something happened that made me want to put 
in my two cents. 

This letter is being composed with the aid of 
Kensington Microware's Format-II, which I 
purchased several months ago. I made my 
choice based on reviews, an advertisement, and 
about fifteen minutes' time spent peering over 
the shoulder of my favorite software retailer as 
he demonstrated it to another customer. I 
bought it shortly thereafter, brought it home, 
and installed it. Immediately I started cranking 
out letters, resumes, and all manner of pro- 
cessed words. Happy ending— until the next 
issue of Softalk arrived. 

One of the first things that caught my eye 
was an advertisement for Format-II, Enhanced 
Version. And priced at a whole lot less than I 
had just paid! I decided to be philosophical 
about the whole thing, since this sort of thing 
happens fairly often. I happened to mention this 
in passing to the above-mentioned retailer, and 
he suggested I call Kensington and ask about 
their upgrade policy. He had a very high opin- 
ion of the company and thought they would be 
liberal about upgrading. This seemed sound ad- 
vice, but somehow that phone call never 
got made. 

Today, when I came home, there was a large 
padded envelope in the mail from Kensington. 
It felt as though it had a binder in it, the kind of 
binder you might expect to find a manual in. I 
opened it and found — Format-II, Enhanced Ver- 
sion! Manual! Disk! Not copy-protected! 
Slipped inside the manual was a notice that, like 
all new programs, this one had had some bugs 
in it, but they had been eliminated from 
this disk. 

Many letters have appeared in Open Discus- 
sion praising various hardware manufacturers 
and software publishers for delivering the goods 
when called on, but this is the first instance I 
have seen of a customer's receiving something 
he hadn't gotten around to asking for yet. This 
is the sort of thing that inspires brand loyalty! 
Alan A. Jimenez, Torrance, CA 

Street of Dreams 

I find myself compelled to second the comments 
of Daniel J. Thomas regarding Money Street 
(September Open Discussion). This simple 
checkbook program has got to be the best de- 
signed, debugged, and user-friendly applica- 
tions software in existence. Not only do I use it 
to manage my own finances, but it has com- 
pletely replaced some rather expensive and 
well-known bookkeeping software in my two 
optometry practices. It has saved me tremen- 



dous amounts of both time and money and has 
put me more in touch with my finances than I've 
ever been before. 

It actually takes our bookkeeper less time to 
enter and reconcile all transactions with Money 
Street than it did for her to reconcile the check- 
book manually in the past. The report feature 
provides easy-to-understand, up-to-the-minute, 
comprehensive information on our financial 
situation. Greater detail and conventional finan- 
cial formats are quickly obtainable by plugging 
data directly from Money Street into a spread- 
sheet program. 

The program is a joy to use, does exactly 
what it's supposed to do, is easy to customize, 
and impossible to bomb. What more could any- 
one ask for? 

Arthur B. Epstein, Roslyn, NY 
Responsive Muse 

To the list of companies offering great after-the- 
sale support for customers I'd like to add Muse, 
publishers of the Super-Text word processor. 
I've been using Super-Text for several years and 
whenever I've contacted the company with 
questions I have received prompt, courteous, 
helpful answers. Recently I wrote to inquire 
about updating my Super-Text II to their new 
professional version. Within a week I had the 
complete new edition at half price. Perhaps 
other software companies have this same 
policy, but as someone used to dealing with 
book publishers, I am impressed. When was the 
last time a publisher offered you a 50 percent 
discount on the new edition of a book you al- 
ready own? 

When I had some questions about the new 
version of Super-Text, I called Muse and got 
immediate answers. (My main problem was 
how to get the new version to print italics. 
Control-I was supposed to do it, but on the new 
version, control-I in the Add mode is a tab func- 
tion. The answer, for anyone else who may be 
interested, is that control-I still works, but only 
from the Change mode. The easiest way to do 
this is probably to enter a dummy control 
character that you won't use anywhere else, 
then go through with find and replace at the end 
to change it to italics.) 

At any rate, I'd like to recommend Super- 
Text and Muse as a company that stands behind 
its products.

Unabashedly Unprotected 

Users of application programs, as opposed 
to programmers and hobbyists/hackers, will 
generally find they need three types of applica- 
tion programs: word processors, database man- 
agement systems, and spreadsheets. Now it is 
possible to get a great non-copy-protected pro- 
gram in each of these categories. 



PIE Writer (a greatly enhanced and im- 
proved version of Apple PIE) is distributed by 
Hayden Book Company and is the very best 
word processor for the Apple in my opinion. 

The Spreadsheet 2.0 is the very inexpensive 
spreadsheet program sold by Apple PugetSound 
Program Library Exchange (A.P.P.L.E.). The 
Spreadsheet 2. 0 may not be the fastest spread- 
sheet around, but it has some features many of 
the others do not, such as the ability to display 
seventy-column mode without hardware or 
eighty-column mode with hardware, variable 
width columns, and hidden columns. In addi- 
tion, some of the VisiCalc-type utilities, such as 
VisiBlend, seem to work quite well with The 
Spreadsheet. 

The Data Reporter (version 3.0) by Syner- 
gistic Software is just now appearing on the 
market and is the first version of this great data- 
base management system to be unlocked. Now 
the fastest, most versatile, and most fun-to-use 
database system can also be backed up. 

For nonapplication uses (programming and 
such) there are also a number of companies now 
putting out unlocked software. Almost any

product from A.P.P.L.E. is assured of being a 
quality, useful item. Of course, everyone 
knows of the great stuff by Beagle Bros. For 
graphics, there is always Penguin Software. 

With this lineup of unlocked programs, it 
should never be necessary to use copy-protected 
software. 

The reason more and more programs are 
now being sold on unlocked disks and are still 
making a profit is that it's become quite clear to 
companies that application programs (as op- 
posed to games and other trivials) are virtually 
useless without documentation and manuals. 
Companies that continue to try and palm off 
copy-protected software have not learned that 
it's the good, usable documentation that keeps 
these programs from being pirated. The exten- 
sive and useless copy-protection schemes do 
nothing but cause frustration and anger among 
users. 

Not only is each of the programs I've men- 
tioned outstanding in its own right, but the fact 
that all of them are unlocked makes them even 
more attractive. I feel we should all support 
companies that make it a matter of policy to sell 
unprotected software. And, if the software is 
among the best in its class, what else need be 
said? 

This next section is in response to the ques- 
tion asked by Jeffrey S. Grudin of Newbury Park, 
California, in the September If Then Maybe col- 
umn. More exactly, it is a response to the answer 
given by Roy Hicks. 

Jeff, it is my opinion that most of the infor- 
mation given in the answer may be wrong or is, 
at least, open to debate. I personally do not use 
the reverse side of disks, but for my own rea- 
sons, not those given by Roy Hicks. If you real- 
ly want some good information on the use of 
both sides of disks, I refer you to articles in the 
Newsletter of the Washington Apple Pi, June, 
July, and August 1982 issues. At the very least, 
this series of articles will show you that the sub- 
ject is open to discussion, rather than being an 
"if-then" question. 

By the way, I think the If Then Maybe col- 
umn is a great idea. My favorite parts of all the 
many computer magazines I read are the "let- 
ters to the editor" and "questions and an- 
swers"-type columns.

A Modest Master 

A rare experience is finding a complete, com- 
prehensive set of programs for a modest cost. 
MasterChart, by Spectral Graphics Software, 
provides a variety of bar, pie, and line charts in 
both two- and three-dimensional perspectives. 
It is simple to use and worth many times the 
cost. It also provides the ability to make your 
own figures, symbols, and so forth in any shape 
you can imagine. Our sales department uses 
these programs to prepare charts for customer 
presentations. I use these programs personally 
for presentations to my board of directors. 
Thanks to Spectral Graphics Software for 
dreaming up MasterChart and selling it at a 
reasonable price.

Gallant Support 

I would like to tell about a software company 



that really cares about and knows the mean- 
ing of service. 

I enjoy an occasional game of Knight of Dia- 
monds by Sir-tech. After a week or so of play- 
ing, I started having bad sector or read/ write 
problems. I went through five disks and was 
about to call the company to ask them why the 
game never worked properly for longer than a 
couple of days, when I received a call from Mrs. 
Bresett. She spent almost an hour on the phone 
long distance talking about how and where I 
used the game. We came to the conclusion that, 
due to a power flux at my home, the disk drive 
was half tracking. 

This effort was costly to this company, and 
all I can say is thank you. Sir-tech.

Telling a Disk by Its Cover 

I have a complaint about the software industry. 
The problem is software advertising. When I 
look at an ad for a piece of software, I like to 
know what I'm being asked to buy. What is of- 
ten shown is the package art or an artist's con- 
ception of the program's graphics. Rarely do 
we see actual program displays reproduced. 

What I am asking for is simple. If a program 
uses graphics, show one or more sample dis- 
plays in the advertising. I would also like to see 
the same concept applied to program packag- 
ing. Once in a while I find a great program with 
lousy cover art. These programs could be saved 
if the consumer could be given a reason to give 
the program a second glance. It would make 
software purchasing decisions easier for every- 
one, both the dealer and the consumer. 
Dennis Mitchell, Rapid City, SD 

As we all know, many software companies have 
very impressive artwork on their disk jackets. 
This gives false impressions as to the actual pro- 
gram graphics and actions. I'm sure it has been 
discussed, but so far, as I look at the ads, not 
much has been done to correct this deceptive 
practice. It seems to me that the software pro- 
ducers should show an actual screen image from 
a program — on the disk jacket as well as in 
the ads. 

I commend those software companies that 
do have the actual screen showing in their ads. 
They are being honest with us and deserve our 
support. 

Gus Schneider, Yonkers, NY 

I simply won't read or even get interested in 
product ads that don't tell me anything. Here's 
what I need to know: What is the retail price? If 
I'm interested, I will shop around to find the 
best discount I can find. But if, for example, 
Epson brings out a new model, how much does 
it cost? If they can't advertise the price, I won't 
bother with it. More important, I'll probably 
forget it because I won't even read the ad! Ad- 
vertisers should publish a price in large print. 
Keith Brewster, Sunnyvale, CA 

The Positive Sort 

I thought that I might write to inform your read- 
ers about some of the Apple-related products I 
have recently used. Master Sort, published by 
Marshall Associates in Huntsville, Alabama, is 
a machine language sort routine that sorts and 



NOVEMBER 1983

merges random or sequential text files in a mat- 
ter of seconds. I was able to sort more than nine 
hundred random records, in both a descending 
and an ascending order, in just a few seconds. I 
particularly appreciated Mr. Marshall's help 
with some technical questions. His follow-up 
service, his documentation, and his product are 
well worth the price. 

There are two pieces of hardware I pur- 
chased that I wish I could be as positive about. 
The first is the Okidata 93 dot-matrix printer. 
Though the print quality is everything I would 
want from the printer, there are a number of 
shortcomings. The tractor feed works very 
poorly. I cannot leave the printer alone; after 
six to eight pages the paper becomes mis- 
aligned. The documentation is also very poor. 
Nowhere does the documentation describe how 
to align the paper for the tractor feed. Also, the 
documentation never tells the owner how to use 
the self-test with 8.5-inch-wide paper. The self- 
test seems to be set up only for 15-inch paper. 
Although the printer seems to work fine with 
the exception of the tractor feed, I do not feel I 
have the professional product I sought. 

The final piece of hardware I wish to com- 
ment on is the Pkaso printer interface by Inter- 
active Structures. The problem with the Pkaso 
card is very much the same as with the Okidata. 
Namely, the documentation is poor. Nowhere 
does the manual tell the user about the programs 
that are on the disk that comes with the card! 
This shows a complete lack of respect for 
the purchaser. When I called Interactive, an 
employee there acknowledged that a new man- 
ual was in the works but could not say when it 
would be ready. Again, the product seems to 
work just fine, but I question whether I am get- 
ting full use of it since the instructions seem so 
incomplete. 

Karl F. Thompson, Forest Hills, NM 
Star of the Sea 

Since Softalk's Open Discussion seems to be the 
place to relate experiences with companies, I 
would like to add mine. 

This concerns Star Micronics, manufacturer 
of the Gemini 10 printer, which I own. I was 
recently transferred to sea duty and found my- 
self somewhere at sea aboard a naval vessel. 
Star Micronics recently released their new 
printer manual. It arrived at my former address 
and was forwarded by my wife. I guess the 
postal system dropp)ed a bit somewhere and for- 
warded the manual to an obscure hole in 
the wall. 

I wrote to the company requesting informa- 
tion on cost of the manual and shipping. Three 
weeks later a new manual arrived on my desk 
sent via first-class mail. At no time was Star 
Micronics in any way responsible for the re- 
placement of the lost manual. They took it upon 
themselves to see that this one customer was 
pleased. 

To Star Micronics go my thanks for the new 
manual. It is excellent, to say the least. I'll do 
business with this company again.

NOVEMBER 1983 



Among the items was a Microsoft Z-80 Soft- 
Card. However, there was no software or docu- 
mentation available. I therefore called Micro- 
soft to help me out with my dilemma. In no un- 
certain terms the person on the phone made me 
feel like a thief. I tried to explain and told him I 
would do whatever was necessary to prove my 
legal ownership of the SoftCard. The answer 
was that their policy was not to supply either 
software or documentation to anyone for any 
reason, with no exceptions. Thereupon, I wrote 
a letter to the president of Microsoft Corpora- 
tion to tell him that, although I was not a thief, 
he had created a pirate. The only possible way 
for me to obtain what I should have the right to 
buy was to pirate it. 

I quickly found out that Microsoft's dealers 
do not agree with its policy, since I was able to 
get documentation (to either read, make notes 
from, or whatever) and was allowed to copy the 
software right on the dealer's premises. As a 
matter of fact, the owner of one store went so 
far as to suggest that Microsoft's policy was, if 
not illegal, at least a restraint of trade. 

On the other side of the coin, among the 
equipment I have also purchased is an Echo II 
card from Street Electronics. One phone call to 
that company brought me not only the software 
and documentation, but also a speaker and cable. 
Also during this same period, I developed a 
problem with the data disk I was using for £2- 
Ledger by Highlands Computer Services. After 
receiving a return call from the company's pro- 
grammer one evening and discussing the prob- 
lem with him, I returned both the program disk

and my own data disk to him. Within ten days I 
received a brand-new updated program disk and 
my old data disk, from which he was able to 
save most of the data. Simply put, a problem 
that I probably caused myself was cured by 
Highlands, and four disks were exchanged for 
two — all at no cost to me. 

I was forced to return my Kraft joystick 
when it was barely ninety days old on a one- 
year warranty. As I packaged the joystick, I in- 
advertently broke off a pin on the plug. In my 
letter to them I explained the problem and said I 
would be happy to pay for the cost of the new 
plug. They did return a new joystick to me be- 
cause the pots were not working reliably. How- 
ever, I was charged $14 for the cost of a new 
cable— approximately 40 percent of the total 
cost of the joystick. 

Due to my being upset with Kraft, I dug out 
my old TG joystick, which was about twenty- 
two months old. I found two broken pins on the 
TG joystick plug. After speaking with a repre- 
sentative of TG, he suggested I return the entire 
joystick to them so they could check it out for 
me. I was told that this would cost me approxi- 
mately $5. Twelve days later I received the 
joystick with a brand-new cable and plug — at no 
additional cost. 

I hope this letter will enlighten fellow con- 
sumers as to where they can find good support 
and where they will find little or even none.

Always Room for Improvement 

I purchased Continental's Home Accountant late 
in 1982 and it's a good program, but it has a 
long learning curve for someone unaccustomed 
to working with accounting. I have made it a 
habit to enter two or more dummy transactions 
each month to allow for omitted entries. These 
can be edited to enter the omissions; the totals 
will be correct. Mine are payable to "dummy" 
in the amount 00.00 with the memo "for error 
of omission." I find it helpful to date them on 
the last day of the month to make a search 
easier. 

My suggestions for improving Home Ac- 
countant include a faster DOS; an express com- 
mand to allow exit without going through all 
menus; embedded pokes that would keep the 
data disk drive spinning during the reading of 
the many files in the printed report mode; a 
method of specifying that split amounts are to 
be included in the totals of some reports (I must 
get out the old calculator for some of these or 
enter several things separately); the option of 
not watching the graphics at every loading; and 
the option to view reports on the screen before 
printing. 

J.W. Buchanan, Jr., Austin, TX 
Disclaimer Disclaimed 

Open Discussion is always one of my favorite 
portions of Softalk and I felt it was about time 
that I got involved in it. In the September issue, 
Hari Wiguna wrote expressing an interest in 
Forth but didn't know which way to turn. One 
of the nice features of Forth is its availability at 
a reasonable price. Here are a couple of sug- 
gestions. 

The Forth Interest Group (Box 1105, San 
Carlos, CA 94070) has published a public- 



domain version of fig-Forth available for the 
Apple; it costs $30 with an installation manual. 
Another way to go (which I personally rec- 
ommend), is through Mountain View Press 
(Box 4656, Mountain View, CA 94040). They 
have a public-domain version called MVP- 
Forth. Source code for MVP-Forth is available 
for $20, or you can order it on disk. 

Also, I would like to take a moment to toss 
my two cents into the copy-protection/backup 
fray. Recently I bought a copy of Continental 
Software's Home Accountant. As a program- 
mer, I normally find improvements that I would 
like to see in a program to make it easier for me. 
This program is no exception. It was, however, 
"copy-protected" after a fashion to prevent me 
from making it more usable. This is annoying, 
but I realized that when I bought it. What is tru- 
ly upsetting about these situations, however, is 
after you purchase the package, get it home, 
and remove the shrink-wrap. Then you find the 
disclaimer. In this case it reads: "Continental 
Software Co. makes no warranties, either ex- 
pressed or implied, with respect to this manual 
or with respect to the software described in this 
manual, its quality, performance, merchantabil- 
ity, or fitness for any particular purpose. Conti- 
nental software is sold or licensed 'as is.' The 
entire risk as to its quality and performance is 
with the buyer." 

Here we have a case where I, the buyer, 
must assume all risk but do not have the ability 
to modify the program to suit my needs. As a 
kicker. Continental provides no backup disk. If 
my disk goes bad, I must wait for a replace- 
ment; and, if I am not covered under their war- 
ranty, the backup will cost me an additional 
$17.50. Continental's warranty program costs 
$20 and allows me to obtain service, improve- 
ments, and enhancements. These are items of 
which no mention is made on the outside of the 
package. One would expect them to be included 
in the purchase price. 

There have been positive sides to my rela- 
tions with vendors, however. Hayden Soft- 
ware's ORCA/M assembler is one of the finest 
products I have seen produced for the Apple. Its 
documentation is superb; it comes unprotected 
and source code is provided to allow one to 
make enhancements as needed. More vendors 
should step back and take a look at what Hayden 
is doing. They are producing quality software, 
with quality documentation, at a reasonable 
price. As a bonus, they are producing it on 
copyable disks so I can make backups and mod- 
ify it as needed.

Consmners Arise 

I wish to vent my anger at a publication I 
thought was pretty objective in its reviews of 
equipment and software. After reading a very 
favorable review of the Vista VI 200 six-mega- 
byte disk system (Hardtalk, August 1983) by 
Jeff Mazur, I plunked down a grand and bought 
one. What a nightmare! The first unit I took 
home (after an eighty-mile round trip) died, 
coming to a grinding halt after about five min- 
utes of use. I returned it immediately and had 
the replacement unit tested before I left the 
store. Unfortunately, I did not test the software 
disk that came with this second unit. Two of

three patch disks were apparently unformatted 
blanks. 

That was only the start of a week-long bad 
dream. I drove back to the retailer (by the way, 
located just across the street from Vista) and got 
another CP/M patch disk. So far, so good. That 
night, the thing mysteriously went off into no- 
where while writing to disk. I figured that it 
might be a transitory glitch and wouldn't hap- 
pen again. It started happening often, with DOS 
3.3, CP/M, whatever. For no apparent reason, 
the thing up and quits every couple of hours. I 
didn't notice anything about the quality or reli- 
ability in Mazur's review, but Vista has a spec 
that says that mean time before failure is five 
thousand hours. There are about four hundred 
or so of these machines made, or that's what 
customer support at Vista says. I have sampled 
two of them, which failed in fifteen minutes and 
five hours of use respectively. It seems that 
Vista should revise its specs. 

I haven't even mentioned the documentation 
and the utility programs that don't agree with 
each other as to installation procedures. I could 
at least figure those out. Spending many hours 
copying files onto this thing only to have it stop 
in the middle of a file transfer (resulting in 
glitched files and sometimes an entire blown 
disk) has made me really angry. It is beyond me 
how this product could get a positive review in 
your fine magazine. I would just be happy if this 
product worked as advertised. 

I'm bringing this wretched thing back to 
Vista this time, and will ask them to give me a

Shuffling the Cards 

After purchasing an Advanced Logic Systems 
Z-80 card about three months ago, I eagerly 
took it home and placed it into slot 4 of my Ap- 
ple II. I booted up the CP/M system disk and 
bingo— I was working in CP/M. However, the 
system that is shipped when you purchase the 
ALS card alone is configured for 48K of mem- 
ory, so as to fit in a standard Apple. 

As I had installed an Andromeda 16K card 
about two years ago, I attempted to use the 
Bigsys program that was included with the ALS 
card to reconfigure CP/M to work with the ex- 
tended memory. The program seemed to run 
fine, but the disks produced with the 64K CP/M 
would not work! They would boot, but any at- 
tempt at reading the directory, or even running 
the ALS hello program, would lock up the 
computer. 

I wrote to Advanced Logic Systems and An- 
dromeda about the problem and received word 
from Andromeda that their card wouldn't work 
with the CP/M 2.2 that is shipped with the ALS 
card. Thinking that the 16K card was the prob- 
lem, I ordered a new card from A.P.P.L.E. to 
fix my problem. I received my new card, 
plugged it in, and tried one of my 64K CP/M 
disks. The same thing was happening; the 
system would lock up. This time I called ALS. 
In my conversation with a technical represen- 
tative, she asked if I had tried the card in slots 4 
and 7. I thought the standard slot for a Z-80 
card was slot 4, and the 48K version of CP/M 
worked there. I had never tried slot 7. Sure 
enough, there in the instruction booklet it men- 
tioned that the card should be placed in slot 4 or 
slot 7. After moving the ALS card to slot 7, my 
64K system would boot up and operate with no 
trouble!

The Proof of a Product 

I am writing about something that has been 
bothering me for some time now. It concerns 
the spelling and punctuation found in some 
computer programs. I don't know how the sit- 
uation stands in other types of software, but my 
experience with it in adventure games is dis- 
tressing. 

Several of the programs I have examined 
and/or purchased have contained so many 
misspelled words that, even if the game is good, 
I feel very disappointed with the product as a 
whole. I like to feel that authors and program- 
mers are intelligent, clear-thinking individuals. 
When I see so many incorrectly spelled words, 
it really bothers me. One recent example I can 
cite is Penguin Software's The Quest. The game 
looked like fun and I was contemplating pur- 
chasing it, but the many sp)elling and punctua- 
tion errors ruined it for me. I have also found 
quite a few mistakes in Sierra On-Line's games. 



I think one of the reasons I like Infocom's 
games so well is that I have never found a single 
spelling error in any of its programs. 

I realize that there are a lot of clever people 
out there who simply are not good spellers, but 
isn't that what proofreaders are for? I think 
some of these software companies should start 
paying a bit more attention to the honing and 
polishing, which I feel is an important part of 
any finished product. 

My compliments to Softalk's proofreaders. 
You do a good job. 
Marian Apgar, Napa, CA 

Fiction Feedback 

The story "Dragon, Dragon, Burning Bright" 
by Lisa Michaels Jones was great. I hope Sof- 
talk prints more in the series. It reminded me of 
"True Names" by Vemor Vince. I also like the 
Sam Sledgg stories by Ralph Mylius. I hope 
you print more of those, too. 
Gayle Ann Sanford, Memphis, TN 

Getting Beyond 

I am glad that you are beginning new graphics 
and assembler series. I came in on both in the 
middle and a lot of the information was beyond 
me. I did spend enough time working with the 
assembler on my own to understand what was 
going on. The graphics I didn't even try to 
work on. 

Now for some suggestions I hope Softalk 
will consider. First, how about a few applica- 
tions programs and articles on Pascal? Hopeful- 
ly, people will catch on to Basic soon and its use 
will diminish. Also, how about a few articles 
each year on Modula n? I realize that Jim Mer- 
ritt's articles are helpful to a lot of people, but 
some useful Pascal programs simply serve to 
highlight his tutorial even more. 

I would also like to see Mr. Merritt start a 
series on the Pascal system and on p-code. DOS 
is certainly well handled by Softalk and it would 
be nice if you started to treat Apple Pascal the 
same way. I don't know just how complicated 
this would be, but the challenge would be there 
for everyone.

Of Fast Cars and Rickety Airplanes 

In reference to Rudy J. Stricklan's mention of 
a Ferrari 308 (September Open Discussion), let 
me ask the readers a question: If you were to 
buy a Ferrari 308, would you insure it? Well, in 
the business world, many programs are worth 
more than a Ferrari 308. The businessman who 
loses his database program may lose much more 
than that. The problem is, software cannot be 
insured like a car. It cannot be backed up. The 
best you get from some companies is that, if the 
disk crashes, you can send it back with fifteen 
dollars and they'll send you a new one. That de- 
lay could be disastrous for a big business; 
moreover, the software company is trying to 
make money off of a disk crash. The result is 
piracy. 

Perhaps if there were no copy protection, 
piracy would be reduced, at least in the busi- 
ness world. If you want to look at how non-copy 
protection is doing, just look at Beagle Bros, 
whose unprotected programs are at the top of 
the Hobby list and even in the Top Thirty. 

I'd like to reply to the letter from the presi- 
dent of Avant-Garde entitled "A Jumpy Reac- 
tion" (September Open Discussion). As an 
owner of around five hundred Apple games, I 
can sincerely say that Jump Jet stinks. When 
compared to a similar game of a year ago, Star 
Blazer, Jump Jet suffers. Not only is the idea 
jaded, but I think the graphics are poor and the 
sound obnoxious. Even compared to a game of

two years back, Pegasus 2, Jump Jet looks pret- 
ty bad. 

I hope readers won't be enticed by Ms. 
Smith's letter calling Jump Jet "action-packed 
and exciting." Hah! I urge readers to look at the 
game itself, if the computer store will let them. 
In reference to the adventure game that Ms. 
Smith suggested in conclusion, I doubt it would 
sell if Avant-Garde used the same graphics as 
Race for Midnight, which were created with 
another Avant-Garde miscreation, Hi-Res 
Secrets.

Sparks Fly 

I cannot believe that you printed the letter from 
Edward Parker in August's Softalk\ I will not go 
into a course on proper grounding procedures, 
but suffice it to say that there are very good 
reasons for using a local green-wire ground and 
not the white wire as Mr. Parker advocates. Ac 
power does not have any polarity, despite Mr. 
Parker's innuendo, although frequently the 
white wire is referenced to earth ground. The 
white wire should be thought of only as an ac 
return and not a ground wire. Unfortunately, 
since the dc return wires are frequently called 
"ground," many believe (incorrectly) that the 
same name can apply to the ac return. If anyone 
does add his own ground wire to a water pipe, I 
strongly suggest that he make it a green wire. 
This will tell any electrician in the future that it 
is referenced to the local earth ground and not 
the ac return. 

Fortunately for most of us, the local elec- 
trical codes are almost always followed. By not

locally grounding the ac return wire, the elec- 
tronic noise can be drastically reduced, if not 
eliminated. That allows most of us to use our 
computers without getting complaints of inter- 
ference with our neighbors' televisions or 
radios. 

David P. Stroup, San Diego, CA 

Edward Parker's instructions for rewiring an 
ungrounded outlet ("A Wiry Solution," August 
Open Discussion) would give any electrical in- 
spector gray hairs! While his method of provid- 
ing a grounded outlet may not result in an elec- 
trical hazard, it is not in compliance with the 
National Electrical Code. 

First of all, the white wire connected to the 
chrome screw of a properly wired receptacle is 
a grounded conductor, not a grounding conduc- 
tor (which must be green or bare). Since the 
green grounding conductor is by definition a 
non-current-carrying conductor, it is never the 
"same ground line" as the white conductor, as 
Mr. Parker implies. 

Second, the proper way to install a grounded 
receptacle is to run a length of 14/2-WG ("with 
ground")-type NM cable for a 15-amp circuit, 
or 12/2-WG cable for a 20-amp circuit, all the 
way from the circuit breaker panel to the re- 
ceptacle. Mr. Parker suggests using a white 
wire as a ground in violation of the code, which 
requires that grounding conductors be either 
green or bare. The black wire is "hot," the 
white wire is "neutral," and the bare wire is 
"ground." In most properly wired power 
panels, the neutral and ground wires are bussed 
together at the point where the neutral bus is 
grounded; this is the only point in the system 
where the neutral and grounding conductors are 
at the same potential. 

Finally, the best advice I know on this sub- 
ject is this: Have a qualified electrician install a 
separate, 20-amp, grounded receptacle espe- 
cially for your computer system. Remember 
that your insurance probably won't cover a fire 
or accident caused by a jury-rigged electrical 
circuit. Another advantage of such a special cir- 
cuit is that it will provide "cleaner" power, be- 
ing separate from heavy, glitch-causing loads 
elsewhere in the house.

The Micro and the Minister 

In response to Victor O. Schwartz's "Apples 
Revered and Reverent" inquiry in the August 
Open Discussion, I am a minister and use my 
Apple lie system for filing, time management, 
and word processing. Currently I have an Apple 
Dot Matrix Printer and a Dynax DX-15 let- 
ter-quality printer. The system is my own, 
hence I do not use the machine for bookkeeping 
or stewardship records. 

Membership in the congregation I serve is at 
just one hundred fifty. My Apple system allows 
me to efficiently produce my weekly newsletter 
and worship bulletin and a substantial amount of 
correspondence with a minimal investment of 
time. The two main software packages I use are 
Apple Writer II and Quick File. They are quite 
sufficient for my "low end consumer" needs. 

The value of the system? With the time I've 
freed up from office work I have been able to 
study and visit more, and our attendance and

Forth Sooth 

In response to Hari Wiguna (September Open 
Discussion), a good group to contact is the 
Forth Interest Group. 

A public domain version (Lyons-Forth) and 
fig-Forth are available. Both are excellent pro- 
grams. TransForth and GraForth are available 
from Insoft for a reasonable price. I have had 
GraForth for more than a year and I love it. 
GraForth deals mostly with graphics. Insoft has 
superb user support. The staff answers calls and 
letters promptly and informs users of program 
and manual revisions. 

While on the subject of service, I have 
nothing but praise for Double-Take and Bag of 
Tricks. Both are excellent utilities. Also, the 
ORCA/M 6502 assembler can't be beat. I 
wouldn't be caught without it. DOStalk is just 
what I've been waiting for. I have one question: 
Is it best to leave one's disk drive doors open or 
closed when not in use? I can't find this infor- 
mation anywhere. Please help! 
Chris Baker, Portland, OR 

First Down 

In response to Margie Zembal (September Open 
Discussion), the Tackier can be operated very 
easily with the following program: 

10 PRINT CHR$(4)"PR#1":PRINT 

CHR$(9);"G":PRINT CHR$(4)"PR#0" 

This program was found on page 13 of the 
Tackier Operation Manual and will print any- 
thing that is on hi-res screen one. There are 
other options that can be used by adding 
numbers or letters in the quotes with the "G." 
The options are: "2"— print hi-res page two 
rather than one; "D"— print the hi-res screen 
twice the size of the screen image; "E'— this 
will print in an emphasized mode (some printers 
cannot use the "E" option); "I"— print an in- 
verse image; "R"— this will rotate the screen 
ninety degrees. Also, when printing in the 
graphics mode, make sure the switch on your 
Tackier card is in the up position. 

I would also like to thank Stuart Landry, Jr. , 
for his helpful comments in the August Open 
Discussion. 

Kenny Tepper, Pikesville, MD 
DOStalgia 

I enjoyed the DOStalk article in the August 
issue of Softalk, which touched on the histo- 
ry (not to say checkered past) of Apple DOS. 
There were two inaccuracies, however, that I'd 
like to correct. 

The first is related to the existence of Disk 
Applesoft. I got my first Apple in February of 
1979 and, after one week of trying to save and 
load programs on cassette, I decided to lay out 
another $500 for one drive and a controller 
card. There really was such a creature as Disk 
Applesoft then. It was a forty -three-sector In- 
teger Basic file called Applesoft that was issued 
on the earliest versions of the DOS 3.1 master 
disk. If you loaded the file and listed the pro- 
gram, it looked something like this: 



120 GOSUB p HIMEM: INPUT p HIMEM: 
INPUT , 

120 GOSUB p HIMEM: -p HIMEM: (p 

HIMEM:@p - , ASC( HIMEM:# ASC( 
HIMEM:, ASC( HIMEM:( ASC( HIMEM:, 
ASC( HIMEM:( ASC( HIMEM: - ASC( 
HIMEM:# ASC( HIMEM: !p HIMEM:@p 
HIMEM:J 

and so on. (The above isn't the real Applesoft 
file. Alas, the disk containing that has long 
since disappeared.) 

This was known as "pseudo-hex": A binary 
file was bsaved on a disk and then its identity 
was doctored so DOS thought it was Basic. Like 
the early Cassette Applesoft, Disk Applesoft 
lived at $800 and interfered with hi-res page 
one. 

You weren't supposed to run this file, mind 
you; you were supposed to type FP and DOS 
would automatically load the program and get it 
running. If you did run it, dire things were sup- 
posed to happen. I don't recall them happening, 
but then I never actually used Disk Applesoft. (I 
had purchased an Applesoft ROM card along 
with my Apple.) 

The second inaccuracy in that DOStalk arti- 
cle has to do with the contents of the Integer 
Basic file. Integer Basic does indeed begin at 
$E000, but that doesn't tell the whole story. 
The area $D000.D7FF is occupied by some- 
thing called the Programmer's Aid. This is a se- 
ries of utilities that allow you to do hi-res graph- 
ics, music, program renumbering, machine lan- 
guage relocation, a memory check, and a few 
other things from Integer Basic. 

A small demonstration is in order. First 
bring up Integer Basic. Enter the Monitor with a 
call — 151 and then type DOOOOG. You are now 
looking at a cleared hi-res page one from In- 
teger. Hit reset and make sure you're in Integer 
Basic. Type in the following: 

10 MUSIC = -10473 : PITCH = 767 : 

TIME = 766 : TIMBRE = 765 
20 POKE TIME, 40: POKE TIMBRE, 32 
30 FOR I = 1 to 49 
40 POKE PITCH < I : CALL MUSIC 
50 NEXT! 
60 END 

Nice? Now type in the following direct com- 
mands: 

CLR 

START = 1000 
STEP = 10 
CALL -10531 

And when the fireworks are done, list the pro- 
gram. It will have been renumbered to begin at 
line 1000. If you want to play around with this, 
make sure you follow the series of steps exact- 
ly. You can make the start and step values al- 
most anything you want. It's even possible to 
renumber your program so that all the lines are 
greater than 32767! Negative step values are 
also possible. 

Apple has been distributing a copy of the 
Programmer's Aid with every language card 
and presumably every DOS 3.3 for the Apple 
He (it's part of the Intbasic file), but I have 
never seen a copy of the documentation other 
than what I received when I purchased my origi- 
nal Apple n. Programmer's Aid consisted of a

ROM chip that was inserted into the mother- 
board. Its product number is #A2L0011. 

The area $D800.DFFF was indeed a blank 
on the original Apple II— there wasn't even a 
ROM chip there— but the Intbasic file on your 
master disk contains rather curious garbage. 

The real surprise is what takes place be- 
tween $E000 and $F7FF. Integer Basic itself 
only extends to $F424. Part of the remaining 
space is occupied by the Apple's miniassembler 
($F500.F63C). It's activated by tying F666G 
(the number of the Beast?) from the Monitor 
with Integer Basic enabled. Two other denizens 
of this forgotten shadow-land are an authen- 
tic sixteen-bit (pseudo) machine living at 
$F689.F7FC and a mysterious floating-point 
number package that hangs out at $F4S5 . F4FB 
and at $F63D.F65D. Who knows what lurks in 
the interstices? 

I still have the original Disk II Floppy Disk 
Subsystem Installation and Operating Manual, 
subtitled Apple Intelligent Subsystems (part 
number 030-0011-00). Rereading it today 
brings tears to my eyes. Actually it brought 
more than tears back in 1979 when I thought 
about how I'd laid out $500 for the thing. 

The manual is a massive thirty-eight pages 
long! It contains a few more of the weak jokes 
and many of the typos still present in current 
versions of the DOS manual, but very little 
else. Writing and reading something called text 
files is mentioned in all of ten lines— no ex- 
amples, of course. The exec command is given 
a little more coverage, but the additional ver- 
biage just makes the command seem even more

arcane. Nowhere did the manual address what 
was for me the burning question: How do I im- 
plement store, recall, and shloadl Today it all 
seems so obvious. 

DOS, back in those days, also had some bi- 
zarre bugs. The first one that most people en- 
countered was the connection between the drive 
cable and the controller card. It was quite easy 
to get it wrong. I figure the average person had 
about a 50 percent chance of getting it right. (I 
didn't, and the drive had to go back to the 
shop.) 

Locking a file sometimes mysteriously 
caused the length of the first file in the catalog 
to change. We weren't supposed to worry about 
that. In fact, we weren't supposed to pay any at- 
tention to the sector counts in the catalog at all. 

At one time DOS wouldn't execute read or 
write statements if they were in program lines 
numbered more than (are you ready?) 256. 
And, for a long time, you couldn't do this: 

10 ON ERROR G0T01 000 

20 PRINT D$"VERIFY FILE":PRINT 

D$"OPEN FILE":PRINT D$"READ FILE" 

DOS wouldn't allow you to have more than one 
DOS command on the same line. 

Finally, it took more than a little while to 
figure out that *3D0G really meant "type 
3 DOG from the Monitor." Like I said, it all 
seems so obvious now. Today all you have to do 
is hit control-reset.

Computer Error 

In Tom Weishaar's July DOStalk, page 228, he 
suggests poking a 1 (or whatever) into —27839 
to change the maxfiles value. On my Apple II 
Plus, I did a maxfilesi, peeked at -27839, and 
printed the result of 76?! Then, with the help of 
W. Leubbert's What's Where in the Apple, I 
discovered that maxfiles uses location —21929. 
Indeed, a peek there found my 2. Is this a typo, 
or did Weishaar really pump gas into his Apple? 
P.V. Blakeman, Monmouth Junction, NJ 

Tom Weishaar responds: 

The number at byte -21929 (43607, $AA57) is 
the current maxfiles value. The number I was 
referring to is the default maxfiles value, the 
number of buffers DOS builds when it is booted 
or when you enter the^ or int commands. 
Here's the gasser: Due to a computer error, the 
negative poke location was wrong. It should 
have read -21839 rather than -27839. The 
other values given for this byte, 43697 
($AAB1), were correct. I give most pokes in all 
three notations in the hope that the com- 
puter will have calculated at least two of them 
correctly . 

Tom Weishaar, Overland Park, KS 
State of Grace 

There seems to be a bit of confusion (perhaps 
it's mine) about the use of monico and 
nomonico in the debugging of a DOS program. 
Basically , there is no way to tell if information 
is going to the disk under monico. This is due to 
the use of print statements for output both to the 
screen and to the disk. While it is true that if 



information is sent to the disk it is echoed to the 
screen, the converse is not true. If you see data 
on the screen, it might have gone to the disk. 
However, it also might simply be the normal 
non-DOS function of print taking over. I use the 
following scheme: Use monico to tell what is 
going to the disk, but use nomonico to tell if in- 
formation is getting there. 

Generally under nomonico, if you see it, 
DOS didn't (the Captain is not infallible). 

Also, I've discovered a seemingly undocu- 
mented feature in Applesoft that can affect DOS 
statements within a program. There is no car- 
riage return printed after a print spc(X) state- 
ment, whether there is a semicolon after it or 
not. This can be a problem if the next statement 
is a print D$; ' 'DOS command ' ' which looks 
for a preceding carriage return. This program 
says it better than I can.

Shaping Up 

I am a beginning programmer who recently pur- 
chased a copy of SoftGraph. I am learning a lot 
from it, though I have a long way to go before I 
really understand it. I would like to use Shape- 
file in my programs, but I don't know how to 
access it. I tried bload Shapefile but all I got was 
a "file not found" message. 

How can I access Shapefile? May I use 
parts of SoftGraph in my programs? 
Edward Mirsky, Del Mar, CA 

David Durkee responds: 

I consolidated three or four binary files, in- 
cluding Shapefile, into one file on the Soft- 
Graph disk in order to accelerate loading. 
Shapefile can be isolated from the rest like so: 

BLOAD SOFTGRAPH. B-FILES (on SoftGraph 
disk) 

BSAVE SHAPEFILE, A$6000,L480 

Load the file and set the pointers in the follow- 
ing manner: 

10 SL = 24576 

20 PRINT CHR$(4);" BLOAD SHAPEFILE 
< A":SL 

30 POKE 233, INT(SL/256):POKE 232, 
SL-(INT(SL/256)*256) 

SL determines the shape location, which de- 
faults to $6000 or 24576. You can change that 
value in line 10, and line 30 will take care of the 
pointers for you. 

You may use the hi-res print routine from 
the January article with this table. It begins at 
line 9000 in both of the chart programs on 
the disk.

complaining, don't get me wrong, it is just that 
I seem to be searching for a holy grail of knowl- 
edge that only the fittest and most deserving can 
find. I consider myself fit and I know I deserve 
better than Applesoft. 

When we bought our Apple, there were no 
spectacular 3-D adventure games or fantastic 
arcade games to play. Our Apple came with 
three— count 'em, three— tapes. The years flew 
by and I mastered Basic out of sheer boredom. 
There was nothing else to do with the damn 
thing. During the last couple of years, I have 
grown very restless. I hear of binary wizards 
who have mastered languages that I can't even 
pronounce. Where do they gain their informa- 
tion? Who can teach me the great secret that 
will clue me in on lightning graphics and flaw- 
less programming?

terface pursued more actively by software

Emergent Problem 

I have been using Apple's Quick File II for 
several months. I find it to be fast, versatile, 
and user-friendly, with excellent documenta- 
tion. This program, however, suffers from a 
fatal flaw. No capability is provided to merge 
one file with another (identical formats are ob- 
viously assumed). This limitation severely 
limits the usefulness of this otherwise fine soft- 
ware package. Can anyone help me with a 
method of merging files with Quick File III

What Do You Expect? 

I have owned my Dynax DX- 1 5 for three weeks 
and have enjoyed using it very much, except 
that I cannot get it to shadow-print and double- 
strike using the escape commands from Apple 
Writer He. (My system includes an Apple He, 
two disk drives, Apple Parallel Interface, an 
Apple DMP, and the Dynax.) 

My dealer, Carolina Computer Store in Ra- 
leigh, North Carolina, has tried diligently to 
discover why the printer will not accept print 
commands through Apple Writer.Their very 
sincere efforts have not brought success. We 
have called Dynax and have not found a person 
who has worked with a system like mine. The 
first person we talked with at Dynax said of my 
problem, "What do you expect from a cheap 
sixty-dollar word processing package?" 

I would appreciate any help anyone could 
offer to help me use both my word processor 
and Dynax printer to their best advantage.

Search for the Right Preboot

use Apple Writer II and like that very much as 
well. Recently I purchased a Smarterm II 
eighty-column card, which will not work with

Apple Writer II (although it will work with 
Magic Window 11). I was told I needed a pre- 
boot, which I purchased from Compular. I now 
have an eighty-column display, but there is a 
two- or three-second delay between the time a 
character is struck on the keyboard and the time 
it appears on the screen, which is very distract- 
ing. Compular tells me that's the way it works 
and I'll just have to get used to it. I've tried, but 
it's no use. The people who sold me the 
Smarterm tell me there is nothing wrong with 
the hardware, since it works with other word 
processing programs. They say I just need the

Wanna Trade? 

I am interested in trading in commodities. I 
would like to find a software package that calcu- 
lates moving averages and graphically shows 
where these averages cross over. I have seen 
this referred to as a dual movement cross-over 
system and I was wondering if any readers 
could recommend one. Please let me know 
through Open Discussion.

Salesman's Dilemma 

I had a number of requirements for a printer to 
use with my Apple II Plus that I purchased in 
October 1981. At that time, the only available 
printers that had a carriage large enough to hold 
my company's order forms that were friction 
and tractor fed were completely out of my fi- 
nancial reach. 

Along came the Radio Shack Line Printer 
VI. It was everything I needed, plus it was 
within my budget. After a couple of changes 
were made to the cable, it worked per- 
fectly—with the exception that I could not find 
out how to use the graphics that both the printer 
and Apple have available. 

Can someone help me? I am a salesman and 
I am continually sending bulletins and price 
changes to my customers. Graphics would cer- 
tainly enhance these bulletins.

Sporting Request 

I'm an Apple owner and an avid sports fan. I'm 
truly disappointed by the lack of good sports 
games available. I have heard about Micro 
League Baseball by Stoneware. Would some- 
one please describe this or any other good ac- 
tion baseball game for the Apple? 
Richard Ronsbottom, Thousand Oaks, CA 

The Verdict, Please 

I am a recent purchaser and proud owner of an 
Apple II Plus. This has caused me a small di- 
lemma. I have a friend who has been kind to me 
and has given me various copies of different 
kinds of programs. I have come to enjoy using 
these programs. But I question whether it is ap- 
propriate (legal) to use copied programs given 
to me. I realize that the use of copied programs 
is widespread. Could a knowledgeable person 
please inform me as to whether I'm legally in 
the wrong to use programs that others give 
to me?

Hollywood. CA 91603. We can't answer questions 
about the products of specific vendors: instead, we 
recommend you contact them directly or see your 
dealer. 




I've written a program 
that I want to market. It 
has to be copyable but hard to list. It is already 
well protected, but I still want to make it so 
catalog will not work. I know how to do that 
from within a program, but not directly on the 
disk. I do not want the user to be able to boot 
another disk, then put my disk in, type catalog, 
and get it. Any suggestions? Mike Vircsik, 
Femley, NV 



mtf 



Putting the statement 
poke 2049,1 into the 
program will prevent someone from listing it 
after it has been run. Instead, the list command 
repeatedly lists the first line of the program. 
Poking in other numbers to location 2049 does 
interesting things as well. 

Another way of slapping the wrists of those 
who try to list your programs is to include the 
following as the first line in your program: 

11 IFZZ = ZZTHEN ZZ = Z:A$= "FP 

The secret here is in the string at the end of the 
line. There is an invisible control-D between the 
quote mark and the FP. The list command will 
refuse to list anything past this line, because by 
listing the line, control-D FP will be the first 
thing printed on the second line of the listing. 
This executes the DOS command, erasing the 
program! 

The if-then statement is just nonsense to take 
up enough space on the line so the control-D is 
the first character on the next line when you try 
to list. You can even use an ordinary rem state- 
ment, if you prefer. Whatever you use, the line 
number should be such that it forces the con- 
trol-D to be shoved to the next line when a list is 
tried. 

When the list command encounters a con- 
trol-D followed by a DOS command as the first 
thing on a line, it can't resist executing the com- 
mand. If you include a quote mark at the end of 
the line, the command won't be executed, but 
the program won't list either. Instead, you'll re- 
ceive a syntax error message from DOS. 

Variations on this theme are possible by us- 
ing catalog, delete filename, init hello, or other 
disastrous DOS commands in the string. The 
results would be the just desserts for anyone try- 
ing to list your program. 

Messing around with the catalog is a bit 
more tricky. Memory location 44033 is where 
the catalog's track number is stored, but chang- 
ing the track number (poke 44033,13, for in- 
stance) and then initializing a disk doesn't seem 



to be the answer. 

Trying to hide the catalog and rearrange the 
VTOC (volume table of contents) is one of 
those things software publishers spend a lot of 
money on, and programmers earn a lot of 
money from. Matthew Yuen 

My Apple II Plus does 
not have a flashing cur- 
sor. However, whenever I use the GPLE or the 
built-in editor, my cursor just disappears. Any 
idea why or how to fix it? Jeffrey J. Duquette, 
Southwick, MA 




mtf 



The published character 
display modes for the 
Apple are normal, inverse, and flashing. You 
have apparentiy discovered the additional mode 
of invisible text. 

A nonflashing cursor is definitely not Apple 
standard. There are three possible causes I can 
think of: You (or someone) have modified your 
Apple to remove the flash by bypassing the 555 
timer chip that handles it; you have a software 
patch to give you a nonflashing cursor; or your 
555 timer is defective. Any of these nonstan- 
dard conditions could conflict with GPLE or 
other programs. If you aren't using a software 
patch to get the nonflashing cursor, then you 
should get your Apple fixed. Most programs are 
easier to use when they have a visible cursor. 
Robert Clardy 




Beneath Apple DOS says 
on page 3-1, "A track is 
a physically defined circular path which is con- 
centric with the hole in the center of the disk- 
ette." In that case, why doesn't track 0 (the 
outermost one) have more sectors, or more stor- 
age space, then track 34 (the innermost one)? 
According to figure 3.1, track 0 should be 
much "longer" around than the rest. Rob C. 
Knauerhase I, Hilliard, OH 



THCH 



Track 0 is in fact about 
50 percent longer than 
track 34. However, it takes exactly the same 
amount of time for track 0 to pass under the 
head as for track 34 because the disk in an Ap- 
ple drive spins at a constant rate of speed of 300 
r.p.m. 

No matter what track a sector is in, it takes 
the same amount of time for that sector to pass 
over the read/ write head. Thus, the sectors in 
track 0 take up more physical space on the disk 
than the sectors in inner tracks. 

More expensive drives, including the ones 
built into the Lisa, vary the disk speed ac- 
cording to which track the disk arm is on. In 
these systems, all the sectors take up the same 
amount of physical space, and the outer tracks 
do have more sectors. 

Woz figured you wouldn't want to pay for a 
variable-speed drive, however, so the Apple 
disk system was designed around the somewhat 
less efficient and much less costly fixed-speed 
drive. Tom Weishaar 




If I can get it to run 
properly, the following 
program ought to be useftil in many applica- 
tions, such as timing a user's responses. I've

tried every variation I can imagine, but it simply 
doesn't work! (Contrary to what is stated on 
page 130 of the Applesoft Basic reference man- 
ual, it appears that the poke -16368,0 command 
won't reset the keyboard strobe.) I currently 
have a nice little keyboard-piano program that 
records notes as you play them. If I can get the 
following program to work, the notes could be 
replayed with precisely the same timing be- 
tween them that they had when input. 

10 X = PEEK (-16384) 
20 POKE -16368,0 
30 IPX > 127 THEN 60 
40 TIME = TIME + 1 
50 GOTO 10 
60 PRINT X 
70 TIME = 0 
80 GOTO 10 

John W. Field, Fairfax, VA 



THiN 



The reason that your 
program doesn't work 
very well is that you clear the keyboard strobe 
every time you peek it, rather than clearing it 
once and then looping through the keyboard 
read line until it comes up with something. As a 
result, the program loop misses many key- 
strokes and only works sporadically. Try 
rewriting the program like this: 

10 POKE -16368,0 
20 X = PEEK (-16384) 
30 IPX > 127 THEN 60 
40 TIME = TIME + 1 
50 GOTO 20 
60 PRINT X 
70 TIME = 0 
80 GOTO 10 

This way the keyboard is cleared only after the 
program has identified a character. Doug 
Carlston 




How do you enter the 
characters with the 
ASCn values of 28 and 31 (whatever they are)? 
Anick Jesdanun, Edison, NJ 



In order to enter the 
characters with ASCII 
values of 28 and 3 1 , you need an Apple He. You 
can't get these characters on the Apple II Plus. 
Control- \ (control-backslash) is the character 
hiding behind ASCII code 28. Control-- (con- 
trol-minus sign) gets you an ASCII code 31. 
And, while we're at it, ASCII code 29 is 
control-] and control- A produces an ASCII 30. 
On the n Plus these are typed as control-shift-M 
and control-shift-N. None of these are printable 
characters, and they carry no intrinsic meaning, 
but they can be typed. Use them wisely. Mat- 
thew Yuen 




The people I bought my 
Apple from told me that 
nothing I could enter at the keyboard could hurt 
the internals— unless I used a hammer— but re- 
cently I was entering a short eight-line program 
and bombed the whole thing. I couldn't even ac- 
cess my printer. I finally got the thing back in 
order by physically rocking the disk card back 
and forth with the Apple turned on. It finally ac- 



cessed drive 1 and loaded DOS. I quickly 
deleted the binary program that bombed the 
whole thing and began wondering what I had 
done wrong. I had hoped to use this method to 
load several subroutines that could be used by a 
variety of programs without making them a part 
of all the programs. This would save loading 
time. Should I have changed the beginning ad- 
dress? Or is this not the right way to go about it 
at all? Tom Bredehoft, Saint Louisville, OH 



TH£N 



It's true that nothing you 
enter at the keyboard 
can hurt your Apple's internals. Jiggling inter- 
face cards while the computer is on can fry all 
kinds of stuff, however, and isn't recommend- 
ed. If the problem of DOS not booting when the 
computer is turned on occurs again, turn your 
computer off and remove the disk controller 
card. Then carefully clean the contacts that plug 
into the Apple with alcohol (the nondrinkable 
kind) and cotton swabs. A pencil eraser can also 
be used, but in the long run this will do more 
harm than good by removing the gold plating 
from the leads. If you're lucky and careftil, this 
will work wonders. 

The idea of initially loading a few sub- 
routines into memory that could be used by a 
variety of programs later is original and cre- 
ative. Keep those ideas coming. You may find 
this one more trouble than it's worth, however. 

It's difficult to tell if you're referring to Ap- 
plesoft subroutines or machine language sub- 
routines. Keep in mind that machine language 
routines can be put in any free memory area. 
Check out a memory map. 



DOS loads Applesoft files starting at the ad- 
dress pointed to by ixitah, bytes 103— 104 
($67 — $68)— mistakenly called lomcnri in a re- 
cent DOStalk. n you want to append a program 
on disk to Applesoft routines already in 
memory, try changing the value here manually 
before loading the main program. Change the 
value back before running the program. You 
may have to change some other pointers to get 
this to work right. Brief experimentation has 
shown that the solution, if there is one, is not 
obvious. If Applesoft doesn't double-cross you 
by changing txttab on its own, and if the stars 
are right, it may work. Tom Weishaar 




1 am a relatively new 
Apple owner and have a 
question concerning Apple files that is perplex- 
ing me. I am working on a piece of software 
that at one point needs to read a sequential text 
file to give values to certain variables. I wrote 
the program and entered the records, but when 
the program I was working on read the records, 
I was gifted with a message from the Apple: 
"reenter." I got the variables, however. Every 
time I came to this part of the program, I would 
see a series of reenters until the proper record 
was located. This would occur again for the fol- 
lowing files. I corrected all but one of the reen- 
ters and found I needed to pause after writing to 
the file with my file-making program. I also 
found that the reenter was being caused by the 
fact that somehow the user prompt ("continue? 
(Y/N)" was ending up in the file as part of each 
record. By adding print statements after the rec- 
ord-writing routines I was able to rid myself of

INTRODUCING 
1HE 1W0-PRINTER 
PRINTER BUFFER: 

MKROBUFFER 11+ 




Like all Microbuffer models, the 
Microbuffer 11+ eliminates waiting 
for your printer to finish before you can 
use your computer again. It allows you to 
print and process simultaneously. 

But the Microbuffer 11+ has one unique 
quality not found in any other Microbuffer: 
it can be used with virtually any printer- 
serial or parallel, or both at once! 

If you have an Apple II, 11+ , Il/e and 
more than one printer, Microbuffer 11+ 
can eliminate a tremendous bottleneck. 

While your parallel printer is going at 
full speed, your serial printer can be 
printing the same file or a different file 
right along with it. And you can be using 
the Apple to do something else at the 
same time. 

The Microbuffer 11+ printer interface 
will fully support the Apple lie 80-column 
format. And it allows an 80-column screen 

TM 

dump from the Videx 80-column board in 
your Apple II or 11+ . 

Perhaps, best of all, Microbuffer 11+ is 
versatile and smart. It supports over 30 
commands for text formatting, sending 
printer controls, printing screen dumps and 
setting up the MII+ itself. AND it in- 
cludes graphics print routines for nine 
popular printers as well as 8 additional 
graphics printing commands. Whether you 
have 1 printer or 2, Microbuffer gives you 
the maximum amount of printing flexibility 
in the minimum amount of time. 

The new Microbuffer 11+ is available 
now in 16K, 32K, and 64K models. Ask 
your dealer for a demonstration, or for 
further information.

all but one of those nasty reenters. This reenter 
was the one right after the first time the append 
statement was used. 

I hope this gives enough information for 
someone to help me with the problem. Perhaps I 
shouldn't use print statements after writing my 
routine. If not, what can I use as a pause? Any 
suggestions? T.F. Bade, New Britain, CT 



Your letter brings up 
several questions. I'll 
try to cover them one at a time. What causes the 
"reenter" error message? This message is 
generated when an input statement is expecting 
numeric data and string (nonnumeric character) 
data is entered. In your case, your program 
probably had an input X type of statement and 
yet it was trying to read the character string 
"continue? (Y/N)" from your text file. A string 
input statement (such as input A$) will accept 
anything typed with no error message. 

How did "continue? (Y/N)" get into the da- 
ta file on your disk? The program that generated 
the data file is the culprit here. When you open 
a text file to write to it (using the DOS open and 
write commands), anything printed will be sent 
to that text file. This includes input state- 
ments with prompts (such as input "continue? 
(Y/N)";A$). The prompt will be written to the 
text file. You must never try to print to your 
screen while a text file is open for writing. The 
solution is to stop writing to the file before 
printing the prompt. Any DOS command, or 
just printing a control-D, will accomplish this. 
Executing another write command starts writing 
to the file where you left off— provided the file 
has not been closed in the meantime. 

How can you get a pause feature without 
using an input statement? You can directly read 
the keyboard strobe to see if a key has been 
pressed. Listing 1, below, writes data continu- 
ously and pauses if you press a key. Listing 2 
pauses after every ten writes, then beeps and 
waits for a keypress. 

Listing 1 .

Each misspelled word is shown to you in 
the middle of a small excerpt from your 
document, so you won't waste time try- 
ing to remember how you used the word. 

You can immediately correct the 
misspelled word by replacing it with the 
proper spelling. The SENSIBLE 
SPELLER even suggests the correct 
spelling for your misspelled words! 



First in dictionaries 

The SENSIBLE SPELLER includes the 
largest, most authoritative dictionary 
available for the Apple computer. Over 
80,000 words are supplied, direct from 
the official Random House Dictionary.

QIRDE 

The Dynamic Zone 

BY HARTLEY LESSER 



This book is dedicated to everyone who is willing and eager to get off it and get on with 
it in spite of anything that used to be; the courage to really go for it, in spite of the constant 
deluge of forces pushing us in the direction of unaliveness, is the most beautiful quality in evi- 
dence in the world today, as well as one of the most scarce. 

—From The Creativity Life Dynamic Book and Program Manual, 

Avant-Garde Creations, 1980 

There seems to be something more at work than simply selling software at Avant-Garde. The company 
possesses a mysticism unique to the industry. The Creativity Life Dynamic package, introduced in 1980, 
managed to philosophize, instruct, and entertain in an entirely new fashion. Avant-Garde saw game playing 
as an effective method by which people could perceive difficult truths. But some people questioned the truth 
of the truths: Were these folks at Avant-Garde without the wherewithal for rational thought? 

"Must be some kinda hippie throwbacks" — something overheard from a mumbling customer at a retail computer 
store in July 1980 as he perused the Life Dynamic manual, which discussed right-brain perceptivity in conjunction with 
artistic programs. 

"Yeah, but look at the price. Dad," responded a youngster, eyes glazed with excitement at the prospect of owning Instant 
Graphics (with or without sound). Instant People, Poem Writing, and Music (Write: Record: Play), for less than twenty dollars. 
The price hit the correct nerve. Two tenners soon evacuated the gentleman's wallet and merged with other greenery inside the 
retailer's happy register. Little did the adolescent know he was in for an educational experience. Litde did the father realize this 
was the support Avant-Garde needed to grow into one of the major software companies around. What kind of company is Avant- 
Garde? What are its people really like? 

Trailblazing. Eugene nestles comfortably in the midvalley region of Oregon between pine-peppered mountains. Morning fogs, 
temperate rains, and sun-fdled days coax blackberries the size of golf balls from the rich soil. Once a thriving center of the timber industry, 
Eugene now proudly boasts its diversity, beckoning to the knowledge industry for more than a visit. The waters of the Willamette and 
McKenzie rivers merge near Eugene, as do those seeking the sense of community that permeates the well-manicured city. Eugene certainly

seemed to be an unlikely setting for the believed commune of Avant-Garde. 

Avant-Garde is set among what appear to be professional office 
buildings with wood-pane exteriors, typical habitats for working doctors 
and dentists. But Avant-Garde's building is different — there's a small 
river flowing beneath it. Deep water occupies the area where a founda- 
tion should be. A three-story bridge anchored in berry-bushed em- 
bankments hails as Avant-Garde's home. A scenic bridge amid teeming 
greenery leads from the parking lot to the building. A sign above the 
glass entranceway indicates that this is indeed the home of Avant-Garde. 

The brains behind Avant-Garde, Mary Carol Smith, appears more in 
keeping as the chairperson of the board for a giant conglomerate, rather 
than someone who can be caught running around in a space suit promot- 
ing an arcade game. Nor does she conjure images of hippies and flower 
children. But she's perfectly in keeping with an underlying current of ex- 
citement that permeates the atmosphere of Avant-Garde's offices. 

Warm and energetic, exuding self-confidence. Smith speaks of the 
company and her partner, Don Fudge, in glowing terms. There has been 
a great deal of struggle to put Avant-Garde in a leading position, with the 
recently incorpwrated company evolving from a book-publishing venture 
initiated in 1976. 

"Don and I had been through the frustration of trying to get books in- 
to the marketplace. We realized that computers presented a new and 



Fudge became involved with building and managed to find time to 
clip the toenails of a flock of sheep. "I built a one hundred eighty-seven 
foot bridge all by myself, as well as a cabin, a bam, and many puppets 
for puppet shows. I played some volleyball and invented a machine for a 
factory in town. I was really into things like that." 

The bridge that Fudge buUt was strictly for pedestrian traffic and 
spanned a river that was twenty feet wide. One whole summer was ex- 
hausted completing the bridge. Eventually Fudge obtained a mainstream 
job in the village. The group slowly dwindled as people learned what 
they needed to learn and went on to their next objectives. For Mary 
Carol Smith and Don Fudge, this proved to be their publishing venture in 
Eugene, Oregon. 

Magic Bus. Steve Robinson is vice president of finance and ad- 
ministration for Avant-Garde. A graduate of WQliams College, Robin- 
son began computing on mainframes in 1963 and continued through at- 
tendance in 1965 at the Stanford School of Business. 

Robinson's introduction to an Apple occurred while he was working 
as a computer consultant in San Francisco three and a half years ago. He 
observed a VisiCalc demonstration in a computer store. The software 
seemed to be just the tool he was looking for, so he inquired how the 
spreadsheet worked. When the salesperson told him that he was trying to 
figure that out, Robinson said, "Move over," and found all the reason

open line of communication, and we took advantage of an opportunity at 
the right time," she said. 

"The books were published in Eugene. We thought they were impor- 
tant, but they didn't have mass-market appeal. These were books more 
for particular types of people. They had to do with the quality of life and 
presented alternatives to make life work. A lot of books ask questions 
and point out problems, but our books offered solutions. They were 
unusual." 

Strange Days. Given the nature of these books, the differences found 
in the Creativity Life Dynamic series, and the fact that for their first year 
in business they had no telephone and had to drive forty miles to their 
post office box for communication with the world, the initial 
"strangeness" that consumers perceived in Avant-Garde is more easily 
understood. The first software, entitled The Life Dynamic Transforma- 
tion Experience, attempted to have users look at themselves and be will- 
ing to be uncomfortable in the process. According to Smith, the software 
created a "space" for people to experience themselves, if they were 
willing to go through the process. Decisions had to be made about mak- 
ing personal changes, to understand exactly what required change. "You 
have to be where you're at before you can get anywhere," she says. 

Where Smith and Fudge were before Avant-Garde was the outback of 
northern California. A "country experience" found the two residing and 
working as part of a self-sufficiency group of nine people. This in- 
trospective life style played an important role in their coming to a deeper 
understanding of themselves and of the world. Some of the group's 
members had regular city-type jobs but still shared responsibility for 
maintaining the residences and the land of the homeside along with 
everyone else. 

"This was not a big isolation trip," Smith remarks. "I was getting 
my act together. This was a chance for me to decide what I was going to 
do with my life. The most important thing about the country experience 
was realizing that there were important things to be done in the world. 1 
had to make an intrinsic decision to do things that I felt were of greater 
value to my life." Smith gardened, which included reaping rye with a 
sickle, and aided in the construction of cabins and a bam. 



he needed to buy his Apple n. 

''VisiCalc answered my calculation needs," he remarked. ''VisiCalc 
had a much faster response time than any mainframe I had ever used." 
Robinson seems to be the type who enjoys defeating obstacles. He's cur- 
rently a member of the Eugene school board and also manages to work 
with the community in promoting Eugene as a business center. A one- 
man chamber of commerce. 

Technical expertise also characterizes Dan Erdmann, who recently 
joined Avant-Garde as manager of product acquisition and development. 
Bom in what was once known as Fort William in Ontario, Canada, Erd- 
mann attended college in Massachusetts and eventually landed a research 
assistant's position at Harvard. He found the transition from mini to 
micro uncomplicated, as programming in Basic and Pascal on either 
system is similar in nature. "Certainly not Cobol to Applesoft," he add- 
ed with a grin. 

It's the influence of national sales manager and marketing consultant 
Barry Becker that keystoned the last year's substantial increase in Avant- 
Garde's business. Increasing business isn't new to Becker. In his 
previous job, as vice president of marketing and sales for PalmTex Cor- 
poration, he generated six million dollars of sales activity in 1982. 

In general, Avant-Garde's staff is enthusiastic about the opportunities 
they see in the company. The growth phase of any company is often the 
most exciting. What seems to make Avant-Garde special is a sense of 
family. "Avant-Garde . . . it's a good group of people," is a common 
sentiment among the staff members. 

Don Fudge, Avant-Garde's cofounder and star programmer, exists 
on a plane somewhat different from most. The Indiana-bom program- 
mer, schooled in Pennsylvania, resident of California and Oregon, is 
also a Vietnam veteran with definite ideas as to everyone's responsibility 
in fixing the mess he sees the world in today. 

"I'm not on a holy quest," he says with conviction. "If Mary Carol 
and I ever have more money than we know what to do with, we'll put 
those fiinds toward any of those things we'd like to see happen in the 
world." After noting that the world's population would be six billion

and that there are forty wars being waged at this very moment, he adds, 
"There's all kinds of things that aren't going right. If nobody applies any 
force, you know where it's all going to end up. That's a quest everybody 
has the responsibility to take— you, and me, and everybody else. Some 
people just like to take dope and drink a lot and stick their heads into their 
pillows to forget everything. That kind of attitude got us here in the first 
place, with Russia and the United States unable to agree about their 
bombs. I just think everybody has the responsibility to try to make the 
world work. A lot of people don't take this responsibility on. So maybe 
I have to make a bigger noise to make up for some of those that aren't do- 
ing their fair share. And in order to make people take notice, you have to 
have clout. That means making money. That's okay with me. It's 
something I had to learn." 

Route 66 Revisited. Avant-Garde's past history reveals several soft- 
ware successes. Hi-Res Secrets, Fudge's graphics tutor and subroutine 
package. Jump Jet, and Hi-Res Golf 1 and 2 have sold well. Smith 
believes Fudge's Sentence Diagramming, the only program of its kind 
available, is an exceptional educational offering. Lazer Maze, Death 
Race '82, and a newer offering called Trompers have held their own in 
the marketplace. 

A professional version of the already popular Hi-Res Architectural 
Design is currently being tested by practitioners of that occupation. This 
is one of Mary Carol Smith's favorite packages because it allows for 
creative expression. 

Avant-Garde's future is here today. With Avant-Garde working in 
conjunction with Synetix of Redmond, Washington, hardware and soft- 
ware supporting sprite graphics for the Apple have recently been re- 
leased by both companies. Synetix's SuperSprite graphics board is 
bundled with Don Fudge's StarSprite /mtorial, which instructs the user 
in the board's graphics, sound, music, and voice capabilities and pro- 
vides three arcade games as a bonus. 

The collaboration began when, at last year's Minneapolis Applefest, 
the two companies' booths happened to be next to one another. Synetix 
observed Avant-Garde's graphic capabilities, and Fudge and Smith 
looked at the Synetix sprite board with wide eyes. Together, they've 
undertaken the development of the product with rare cooperation and 
give and take on both companies' parts. 

"I think you'll see some things coming from Avant-Garde that take 
some big steps. The StarSprite package is a huge step into the future of 
software," says Smith. "We're not staking the company on StarSprite, 
but we're ready to capitalize on the potential we believe the product 
has." Dozens of boards were sold in September after ads for it began ap- 
pearing, despite the fact that dealers at first didn't have the product on 
the shelves and that it bears a price tag of nearly four hundred dollars, ac- 
cording to Avant-Garde's president. "We'll also be selling StarSprite 
educational products. It's a strong product for that market because of the 
Echo II voice on the board and the ability to animate large objects on the 
screen." 

'"StarSprite software and the SuperSprite board are looking to fill a 
big gap in Apple graphics," remarks Steve Robinson. "A lot's going to 
depend upon the product's initial acceptance. If we come up with ways of 
introducing the capabilities to everyone, the product will feed upon 
itself" 

Robinson feels that this product is the most revolutionary step in Ap- 
ple graphics since the machine's creation. "Graphics was the only area 
where Apple was falling short against the other machines. Now they can 
be more than competitive." 

Don Fudge is thoroughly excited about the new product line. He 
relates that, where it took him five weeks to program a machine language 
game with Apple 6502, three machine language games using sprite 
graphics took an average of only five days apiece. "And I wasn't even 
familiar with the system! There's none of those difficult and weird 
things— none of the preshifted shapes, no worry about colors that you 
had with the 6502. No erasing or concern about restoring backgrounds. 
The problems with machine language before the sprite board can be 
traced back to the hardware. 

"It'll be just like the 16K RAM card and eighty -column video card 
for Apple," Fudge continues. "They're considered standard peripherals 
now. So will the sprite graphics board and the software. I see the Apple 
lie Plus, and of course it'll have the Super Sprite board in it.'* 

The Righteous Stuff. Avant-Garde certainly seems to be doing 
something right. Nineteen eighty-one's staff of four has increased to 



twenty-five full-time and part-time employees. Their catalog boasts 
thirty-seven software products. An injection of venture capital has 
already occurred, with another major infusion due any day. Avant-Garde 
is studying the software markets for the Commodore 64, IBM pc, Col- 
eco's elusive Adam, and even Wang, Mary Carol Smith reveals. She 
believes that only four or five computer companies will continue to im- 
pact the market and that their computers, plus Apples, are the 
heavyweights. 

There is definitely more than a human-to-machine relationship active 
at Avant-Garde. Fudge has deep and serious feelings about computing. 
"The computing experience isn't about Pac-Man and business systems. 
It's a different context of consciousness and awareness. It's something 
unverbalizable. It's a whole new means of communication and a way of 
creating awareness and consciousness. There's a tremendous potential 
with the whole thing." 

Smith views computing with healthy respect. "There are so many 
possibilities, and I'm open to them all. There are so many directions to 
explore and we haven't even begun to think about them all. We've only 
taken baby steps." 

For Fudge, Avant-Garde has been quite a series of progressions— 
from living on one soyburger a day and acquiring an old Apple H Plus in 
late 1979 in order to manage mailing lists, to learning assembly language 
in a week and a half. For Smith, self-sufficiency and living in the country 
with friends was a good experience, but "that wasn't where it was at. It 
was devolving instead of evolving. There are too many important 
things to do." 

A daily regimen of dance classes at 6:30 in the morning starts Smith's 
cycle, while Fudge jogs a mile and a half daily, regardless of climatic 
conditions. "Rain's the best," he claims. Programming requires thirteen 
to seventeen hours of Fudge's conscious work each day, with about four 
hours of unconscious development. He requires "spaces," significant 
pauses, which permit his mind to handle both linear and holistic think- 
ing. Everything has to fit together. Neither Fudge nor Smith smoke or 
drink, as it "gets in the way." 

How do they believe the big shakeout Smith mentioned will affect 
Avant-Garde? Smith doesn't foresee any problems for the company. 
There'll be mergers. As long as people are provided with a choice, as 
long as what occurs works best for the world, the Avant-Garde president 
won't fight against conglomerate takeovers. Fudge feels that the shaky 
ethics he sees in some companies today are caused by fear of this 
shakeout. Even if companies are taken over by the conglomerates and the 
big publishing companies, they still don't have the programmers. 
"We've got the programmers," he responds, with a big smile. "The on- 
ly thing the conglomerates know how to do is sell." 

As to piracy. Fudge sees it as an unsolved problem that will stay un- 
solved. He respects Penguin Software for having the "guts" to lower 
prices, but he doesn't see many other companies following suit. Smith 
hates even to think about the problem. She believes people copy disks 
without really knowing what they're doing. It's an unconscious element 
of human nature. "There's a feeling that copying is so easy to do that it's 
more like Xeroxing. There's no intent to hurt any software company. If 
they only knew." 

The Long and Winding Road. In the future. Fudge predicts, given a 
strong financial base, he and Smith will return to publishing their ideas. 
In a contemplative mood, he reiterates the concept of Avant-Garde. 

"There has to be more space in the world for life, awareness, 
creativity, and potential. We've got to get closer to experience and fur- 
ther away from beliefs. There should be a transformative thing where 
you can give people the right inspiration to look at something a different 
way, to shift a context. Then you've made something happen. You can't 
do that just by sitting back and complaining, or by doing dope— those are 
just ways to run from the problem. But if you want to run toward the 
problem, instead of away from it, then you have to get active. I really 
want to do something with this whole computer experience." 

There's no commune in Eugene, only a professionally managed com- 
pany with its foot in today and its head in the future. Warm people with 
the necessary know-how to make a difference are looking forward to the 
coming months. Exciting products, they promise, and a new Avant- 
Garde. In the meantime, they're indeed wearing ties, and, as Fudge puts 
it, Avant-Garde's success is measured as a life force, a part of the com- 
puting experience that is "a different context of consciousness and 
awareness . . .it's some unverbalizable thing."

AN A BEDROOM in a frame house in 
Berkeley, California, a guy who looks 
like he might have stepped out of a TV

that could change your life. They are 
ideas that are amusing, even charming. And they 
are ideas that are, quite frankly, a little scary. 



His name is Bill Budge and he talks 
about things like how programming for 
a microcomputer is like writing a poem 
using a 600 -word vocabulary. He talks 
about how the elements are so limited 
and how you have to make them mean 
so much. And he talks about how, if 
you do it right, you can make those 
elements suggest something more than 
aliens — something that begins to make 
you believe it has a life of its own, some- 
thing he calls "a software friend." 

A software friend. It sinks in slowly. 

To create a personality in the compu- 
ter, you have to come to some decisions 
about what personality is in the first 
place. We often think of it in nearly the 
same way we think of "habit" or "char- 
acter traits"— a way of describing conti- 
nuity in our behavior from one moment 
to the next. ( F. Scott Fitzgerald called it 
"a series of consistent gestures.") 

According to Budge, however, the 
essence of a software friend is quite the 
opposite. "Creating the illusion of per- 
sonality," he says, "means creating an 
intelligence that's always changing. It 
reacts differently to different situations." 

The idea is probably ten years away 
from actuality. But when it comes to 
working such a mojo on our home com- 
puters, well, Budge stands about as good 
a chance as anyone of pulling it off.

It was a program that changed the 
way people thought about personal 
computers. Instead of reacting to the 
machine, you were suddenly inside it, 
trafficking information this way and 
that, making things. It was like program- 
ming, but with familiar items — you'd 
grab this bumper, move those flippers, 
change the colors, then shoot a ball 
through it all and wonder. Maybe for 
the first time in a popular program, you 
could feel the power of the computer. 

Steve Wozniak called it "the best pro- 
gram ever written for an 8-bit machine." 
And suddenly, what-Budge-would-do- 
next was something you heard people 
talking about. To Budge himself, how- 
ever, things weren't quite that simple. 

"Sometimes I worry," he says. "I worry 
about the ability of software to absorb 
you, focus on you, steal you away from 
your family and friends. Because in its 
short-term excitement, it seems to be 
more interesting. Of course, it's not. " 

He leans on his hand. "Not yet."

The Schoolhouse Apple 

by Jock Root 




Software development seems to come in waves, or cycles. When per- 
sonal computers were first introduced, the big thing was business soft- 
ware: word processors, spreadsheet programs, database systems, and the 
like. Then the focus shifted to games, and we had a flood of adventure 
programs, arcade-style games, and fantasy role-playing simulations. 
Now the big interest seems to be in academic software; most of the estab- 
lished software houses are announcing new teaching programs, and there 
are several specialist publishers that do nothing else but. 

This last trend has produced a tremendous variety of educational soft- 
ware for teachers to choose from and, at the same time, an increasing de- 
mand for more and better of the same. Thus we thought this might be a 
good time to offer some criteria for judging the published material, as 
well as some suggestions as to how to write it yourself, if that's what you 
want to do. 

Different Approaches. There are several different ways to design a 
teaching program. Most academic software falls into one of the follow- 
ing categories (although some courseware packages include several 
modules, using more than one technique): tutorial programs, drill and 
practice, simulations, model or demonstration programs, and adminis- 
trative aids. Tutorial programs are perhaps the most familiar in terms of 
teaching technique, since a tutorial program is essentially a "computer- 
ized textbook." Like paper textbooks, tutorial software employs a wide 
range of styles, but the common factor is that a tutorial program gives the 
student information about a subject and then asks him or her to answer 
questions about it. 

Some of the early tutorial programs were nothing more than "text- 
books on disk. ' ' Students were given several pages (or screens) of text to 
read and then asked a series of questions about the text. As you might ex- 
pect, this technique was little more effective than the textbook it imi- 
tated. In fact, it was often worse, since the early programs did not allow 
students to move back and forth through the text in order to reread para- 
graphs that were not clear on first reading. This kind of software is one 
of the reasons that teachers at first tended to distrust the computer as a 
teaching tool. 

Modem tutorial software is more sophisticated. The text is presented 
in smaller chunks and interspersed with demonstrations, animated dia- 
grams, and other teaching aids, with the keynote being variety. More im- 
portant, the student is asked to respond frequently. Typically, at least 
one meaningful response is required for every screen of data. Programs 
require the student to think about the material as he or she reads it and to 
use ideas as fast as they are presented. In this way, a program not only 
delivers information but also helps students to develop the thinking 
habits associated with using the information. In short, a good tutorial 
program serves much the same purpose as a good textbook: It provides 
review, reinforcement, and amplification of the material taught in class. 

Drill-and-practice programs are primarily for review. They provide 
no information and ask a lot of questions. In the beginning, these were 
even worse than the early tutorial programs, since a quiz on a monitor 
screen is no improvement over a quiz on paper. Like tutorial programs, 
however, drill-and-practice software has improved dramatically in the 
last few years. Nowadays it usually comes in a game format, and the best 
of such programs are almost as exciting as an arcade video game. They 
use fancy color graphics, sound effects, and scoring based on the speed 
of the student's response, combined in a dramatic scenario. Typically, 
the student must defend something (or someone) against a succession of 
nasty creatures by answering the questions that make up the drill. Such 
programs have proved to be highly motivating— "entertaining" might be 
a better word— to younger students, and even adults are not immune to 
their attraction. 

Drill and practice were once the most boring activities the classroom 



had to offer, but with the right kind of software a drill session can be a 
reward instead of a punishment. 

A "model" program uses the computer to demonstrate some process 
or event that cannot easily be observed: dangerous chemical reactions, 
the movement of electrons in a circuit, economic or social processes in- 
volving large numbers of people over long periods of time, and the like. 
With a computer model, the student can vary the parameters of the situa- 
tion and immediately observe the result. The representation is symbolic, 
of course, and can only demonstrate those elements of "reality" that 
have been incorporated into the program. Nevertheless, this kind of soft- 
ware can provide a clear conceptual image of a number of processes and 
principles that are difficult to describe clearly in words. Modeling pro- 
grams are relatively limited in application, being used mostly in the sci- 
ences, but where such programs are appropriate they often provide an 
understanding of the modeled process that is not available from any other 
source. 

A "simulation" program is similar to a model in that it represents a 
real situation that the student could not otherwise experience. In a simu- 
lation, however, the student is an active participant, with the computer 
offering an environment for role-playing: making a trip down the Oregon 
Trail in the 1840s, managing the finances of a family in the 1980s, or pi- 
loting an airplane. 

Another difference between simulation and model programs is that a

model adheres strictly to the rules that govern the process being 
modeled— that is, everything that happens is predictable, if you under- 
stand the rules of the system. A simulation, on the other hand, often in- 
cludes a number of random events. It follows the rules of the situation it 
simulates, but it usually adds a few surprises— for example, in a family 
financial management simulation, you might have your wallet stolen. 
Murphy's Law is specifically excluded from most modeling programs 
but included in most simulations. Modeling programs tend to be most 
useful in the "hard sciences," for example, chemistry, physics, and 
math, while simulations are more appropriate to the social sciences, such 
as economics and history. 

Administrative aid programs, the final category, are not directly con- 
cerned with teaching; rather, they take care of things like scoring exams, 
keeping class records, and the like. 

Gaines. You may be wondering why we didn't include games as a 
separate category in the above classification. Many articles about teach- 
ing programs, as well as some courseware catalogs, have a separate cate- 
gory for games, but we feel that this is a mistake — an oversimplification 
at best and at worst a misunderstanding of the learning process. 

In human behavior, the concept of "game," and the related one of 
"play," refer not so much to specific activities as to a particular style or 
approach to an activity— any activity. Homo sapiens can (and usually 
does) create a game version of every type of behavior, from "playing 
house" (which was probably "playing cave" in the original version) to 
such recent activities as "war games" and "strategic exercises" (less 
violent and deadly than war itself, but a long way from "playing"). 

In short, the purpose of a game is to let you practice some necessary 
skill without suffering the penalties that reality would exact for making 
mistakes. In a game situation, you lose only points, not blood, so you can 
keep practicing until you get it right. 

From this viewpoint, almost any teaching program has a game ele- 
ment built in. The difference is that some programs emphasize the game 
aspect, while others try to minimize it. 

Many teaching programs are also entertaining games. The game-style 
drill programs were mentioned specifically, but similar comments apply 
to most of the simulation programs as well. A good modeling program 
will be fun to play with as long as you have any interest in the process it 
models. Even a straight tutorial, if it's done right, will be self-motivat- 
ing: You can feel the increase in your understanding as you go through 
it, and that's the best reward of all, since it gives you power (that is, 
knowledge) that extends beyond the game situation (learning situation) 
into the real world. 

If you plan to write a teaching program, keep in mind that it not only 
has to teach but also motivate students, either by actively entertaining 
them or by increasing their confidence as they work through the pro- 
gram. If your program doesn't do that, students will soon find something 
more interesting to occupy their attention; but if it does, they'll spend as 
much time as possible with it. 

Interaction. Probably the most important single aspect of course- 
ware design is "student interface"- the interaction between program 
and student. This may seem like a strong statement, but consider a paral- 
lel situation: the interaction between teacher and student. No one would 
deny that the first priority in that situation is good communication be- 
tween the two, and the same applies when the teacher is a machine. We 
don't usually speak of communicating with a computer. We prefer to call 
it interaction, but it refers to the same process. 

Good teachers do more than just lecture or explain. They also listen 
to their students. If that were not the case, we would have replaced all 
our teachers years ago with phonograph records. Mark Hopkins, a 
nineteenth-century American educator, used to tell his students that ' 'the 
ideal college consists of a log of wood, with a student at one end and a 
teacher at the other." The implication is clear that communication must 
flow both ways. 

In the same way, a good teaching program must listen to the student, 
in the sense of accepting input from the student and responding to such 
input in meaningful ways. That doesn't mean simply asking, "How 
much is 2 plus 2?" and accepting "4" as correct; it means allowing the 
student to have some control over the teaching process. The more control 
the student has over the flow of instruction, the more powerful he or she 
will feel in the computer learning environment; and the more powerful 
the student feels, the more he or she will enjoy the experience. Enjoy- 
ment is the best kind of motivation, and motivation has a profound effect

on the learning process. If a student thinks that the program is "paying 
attention," he will much more likely pay attention to the program. 

There are obvious limits to this approach. Even with the best of com- 
munication between a student and a flesh-and-blood teacher, the student 
will inevitably have to do a certain amount of hard work, which he will 
probably object to. But a good teacher will know which of the student's 
requests to agree to and which to refuse; or, more precisely, when to of- 
fer the student a choice and when not to. A good teaching program can 
and should include that same flexibility. 

For example, a program could offer the student choices such as the 
following: "Would you prefer to review the last lesson or take a quiz on 
it?" After the student has passed a quiz on the previous lesson, "Would 
you rather play a game based on the material of the last lesson or start 
studying the next?" Or, if the student doesn't pass the quiz, "Would you 
like to take the whole lesson over again or just read a summary of it?" 
Another option that can be offered to the student is setting the speed and 
difficulty of drill items by adjusting the scoring value for each question 
on the drill— the more difficult the item requested, the higher the per- 
item score. This is similar to the scoring levels in many arcade games. 

Another way in which a program can pay attention to the student is to 
address her by name (but don't overdo this, especially with older stu- 
dents; and above all, don't patronize). It's particularly important for the 
program to recognize and acknowledge good performance (such as a 
high score on a quiz), but in general the student's work should be com- 
pared to her own previous record, not to a class norm. However, if the 
purpose of the program is to prepare the student for some kind of general 
examination (such as the SAT), then comparisons to a general norm are 
appropriate, especially if the student should ask, "How am I doing?" 
Needless to say , the program should give her the opportunity to ask that 
question, where appropriate. 

Whether you're trying to write a teaching program yourself or trying 
to select the best one from a number of existing programs, the first thing 
to consider is the interaction between program and student. Other factors 
are important, too— teaching strategies, content, techniques of presenta- 
tion, and the like; but the thing that determines the "personality" of a 
teaching program is the way in which it interacts with the student. 



Students will likely do their best work for teachers whose personalities 
they admire and respect; the same is true for teaching programs. 

Update. In the September issue, we described a program called the 
Seeing-Eye Elephant Network (SEEN for short): a rather unusual ap- 
proach to teaching college English students how to understand and ap- 
preciate what they read. The "Seeing-Eye" part of the program is an in- 
teractive mtorial that helps the student analyze a character in a book and 
write a brief description of the character, covering motivations, actions, 
purpose in the story, and the like. This description (called a "notice") is 
entered into the "Elephant" part of the system, which remembers it. The 
other students in the class then read the description and add comments or 
criticisms, which can be reviewed and answered by the student who 
wrote the original notice. Within the system, all of the students use pen 
names to preserve objectivity. 

In its original form, the program required CP/M in order to operate 
and did not provide hard-copy printouts of the notices and comments. 
The program has now been revised to run without CP/M, on an Apple II 
Plus with 48K and one or two disk drives; and the notices are stored in 
text files that can be edited and printed through an Apple-compatible 
word processor (such as Apple Writer). For information contact Helen 
Schwartz, Department 9S, Box 911, Rochester, MI 48063. 

Seminars and Conferences. The Northwest Regional Educational 
Laboratory, in Portland, Oregon, is holding a whole series of workshops 
this fall, covering various aspects of computer applications in education. 
These are what you might call second-generation workshops: not the 
kind of "general introduction" conferences described here previously, 
but specialist stuff. They include workshops devoted to specific lan- 
guages (such as Logo), software systems {VisiCalc and the like), and 
fields of education (business, special education, gifted students, multi- 
cultural education). If you're already comfortable with the computer in 
your classroom and want to learn about more advanced applications and 
refinements, write to them for a brochure. 

Speaking of specialized applications, the Assistive Device Center at 
California State University in Sacramento is holding a workshop on 
Matching Assistive Devices to Skills and Needs of Individuals with Dis- 
abilities (February 11 and 12, 1984). This one is about hardware and

Whatever anyone else tells you, all triangles are not created equal. 
It's just that they get so complicated to draw once you go beyond the 
equilaterals. But I looked at my roof and it wasn't an equilateral. And I 
looked at a sail on a sailboat and it wasn't an equilateral. I even looked at 
a wizard's hat and it was far from an equilateral. 

"And so," I said to the turde, "you'll just have to draw a new kind 
of triangle." 

He didn't seem to mind as long as I did all the thinking, so we set to 
work. Here's what we came up with: a single procedure to draw many 
different kinds of triangles 




and two other procedures to draw right triangles (one for a 45-45-90 
triangle and another for a 30-60-90 triangle). 




First let's look at the procedure to draw any triangle of any size. It is 
an extension of an example given in the Apple Logo Reference Manual 
(page 9). 

TO TRI :X ;A :S 

MAKE "SAVEPOS POS 

MAKE "SAVEH HEADING 

FD :X RT :A FD :S 

SETPOS :SAVEPOS 

SETH :SAVEH 

END 

The MAKE command gives the variable SAVEPOS the value of the 
position where the turtle starts. If he starts at HOME, SAVEPOS is 
HOME. If he starts at -100 50, then SAVEPOS is -100 50. (The 
variable is called SAVEPOS because we are saving the position.) 

SETPOS moves the turtle to a specific position. Usually SETPOS is 
followed by two numbers representing the X and Y coordinates. This 
time, however, we are telling the turtle to move to SAVEPOS, the posi- 
tion where he started. In doing so, he will draw the third side of the 
triangle. 

In order to have the turtle end up heading in the same direction in 
which he started, we'll use the MAKE command to save the original 
heading and then we can tell the turde to return to it. 

When we give the command TRI, we'll have to give three inputs: the 
length of the first side, the measure of the angle through which the turde 
must turn to get ready to draw the second side, and the length of the sec- 
ond side. 

We could stop right there because we now have a procedure to draw 
any triangle from ice cream cones to mountain peaks. However, for all 
you geometry lovers who know the formulas for figuring out right 
triangles, let's look at a couple of other procedures. (Besides, this will

give us a good excuse to use some of the arithmetic operations of Logo.) 

In a 45-45-90 triangle, label the side opposite the 90-degree angle C 
and the other two sides A and B. 




The length of C is found by the formula A squared -t- B squared = C 
squared. Or, to put it in Logo symbols, (A * A) -h (B * B) = (C * C). Or 
C = SQRT (A * A) 4- (B * B). Since two sides opposite equal angles will 
always be equal, we can simplify it even further: C = SQRT (A * A) -I- 
(A * A). Now look at the following procedure: 

TO RT.TRI X 

FD :X RT 90 FD :X 

RT 135 

FD SQRT (;X * :X) + (:X * :X) 

RT 135 

END 

One hundred thirty-five is the angle through which the turtle must 
turn to draw a 45-degree angle. 

Here is a pinwheel made with 45-45-90 right triangles: 




The 45-45-90 triangle is okay, but the 30-60-90 triangle is much 
more dynamic. For example, compare the sun below, drawn by rotating 
30-60-90 triangles, to the pinwheel. 




The proportions of the lengths of the sides of a 30-60-90 triangle are 
as follows: 




Thus, if the turtle makes the first side X, the second side will be X * 
2 and the third will be X * (SQRT 3). Look at the following procedure 
for a 30-60-90 triangle: 

TO RT.TR12 :X 

FD ;X RT 120 FD ;X ' 2 RT 150 
FD :X • (SQRT 3) 
RT 90 
END 

You can really have some fun by combining the two types of right 
triangles in one design. (How many triangles can you count in this 
design?) 




TO COGS :N 

REPEAT 4 [RT.TRI 2 :N RT 90] 
REPEAT 4 [RT.TRI :N RT 90] 
END 

Try putting several COGS together and spinning them and you'll end 
up with: 




This design was made by giving the command WEB RT 22.5 WEB. 
WEB was defined: 
TO WEB 

COGS 20 COGS 40 COGS 60 
RT 45 

COGS 20 COGS 40 COGS 60 
END 

If we define another 30-60-90 triangle, this one going to the left, we 
could put several together to form a rhombus divided in quarters. (A 
rhombus is a parallelogram with four equal sides.) First let's define the 
triangle: 

TO RT.TRI2L :X 

FD :X LT 120 FD :X * 2 LT 150 

FD :X * (SQRT 3) 

LT 90 

END 

Then the rhombus: 

TO RHOMBUS :N 

REPEAT 2 [RT.TRI2 :N RT.TRI2L :N RT 180] 
END 

Look at these repeating rhombuses. What happens when you put two 
30-60-90 triangles back to back (the sides opposite the 60-degree angle)? 
How about that, an equilateral triangle. 




Here's one last design made from rhombuses that were made from 
30-60-90 triangles. Notice how the lines give the illusion of curving. 




Aren't you glad all triangles weren't created equal?

One of the Apple's many useful features is its ability to save strings in 
sequential text files for later use. This capability does, however, have 
two major drawbacks. First, the actual transfer of the file (reading from 
or writing to disk) is extremely slow. Second, it does not allow us to 
transfer strings that contain certain characters such as commas and 
colons. 

Methods for getting around the second problem have been in the Ap- 
ple literature almost since the appearance of the first disk drive; these 
methods require a call to a machine language subroutine in order to avoid 
the input conrunand when reading the file. The regular input routine uses 
commas to separate strings, so a string containing a comma is seen as 
two strings with a comma between them. 

This article is more concerned with the problem of how to speed up 



strings back into real variables. 

The technique described herein, which wc call fast strinf^ transfer, 
works roughly as follows. As a program runs, Applesoft creates a table 
of pointers, recording the length and starting address of each string. Be- 
fore a set of strings is saved to disk, the routine we'll present later uses 
these pointers to locate the strings. Then the routine collects the strings 
into a single block of memory, which is bsaved to the disk. To recover 
the strings, the block of strings is first bloaded. Then the string pointers 
are redefined so that they give the new locations of the strings within the 
block. The details will be covered later. 

Figure 1 shows the increase in speed attained by fast string transfer 
when compared to the usual reading and writing of text files.

the transfer of strings, but it incidentally solves the comma problem 
as well! 

To simplify the transfer of strings, a single array of strings, such as 
B$(0) through B$(100), must be used. Even if numerical data is to be 
transferred, it must be done through a string array. The STR$ function 
can be used to convert numbers into string variables for writing to disk, 
and the VAL function can be used after reading the file to convert those

block of strings can be changed, for the purpose of this article, it starts at 
$6000 and builds up toward $9400. See figure 2 for a memory map.

be transferred between memory and disk. Assuming that N is less than or

equal to 500, the program could start with: 

10 HIMEM: 24576 : DIM B$(500) : D$ = CHR$(4) 

20 DEF FN HI(X) = INT(X/256) : DEF FN LO(X) = X - 256*FN HI(X) 

30 PRINT D$;"BLOAD FST.O, A$9400" 

The file FST.O is a machine language program that actually performs 
the transfer of strings. The code for FST.O is in listing 1, which appears 
at the end of the article. The program was created on the Merlin 
assembler. You may find that label or pseudo-op conventions of other 
assemblers require minor modifications to the listing. 

The routine must have an array named B$ to work with. To have your 
program save the strings B$(0) through B$(N), proceed as follows. First 
make sure that the array B$(0) through B$(N), as well as the variable N, 
has been assigned in the program (for instance, B$(0) = "HI" : B$(l) = 
"THERE" : B$(2) = B$(0) + B$(l) : N = 2). Then the following se- 
quence of commands will save the strings: 

400 POKE 8, FN LO(N + 1) : POKE 9, FN HI(N + 1) 
410 POKE 37908, 1 
420 CALL 37910 

430 LN = PEEK(37898) + 256 *PEEK(37899)- 24576 : IF LN > 

13312 THEN PRINT "BFILE TOO LONG" : END 
440 PRINT D$;"BSAVE BFILE, A$6000, L";LN 

To load the strings, along with the value of N, the following com- 
mands should be issued: 

600 PRINT D$;"BLOAD BFILE" 

610 POKE 37908,0 

620 CALL 37910 

630 N = PEEK(37906) + 256*PEEK{37907) - 1 



Options 1 and 3 transfer strings using a sequential text file (file name: 
Tfile) in the usual manner. Options 2 and 4 transfer strings using a binary 
file (file name: Bfile) by means of the fast string transfer method. The 
demo was used to obtain the data for figure 1 . Note that, in running the 
demo, it takes longer to create 500 strings than it does to save them. 

Line 10 sets himem and line 20 bloads FST.O. To prove that there is 
no trickery involved, line 30 clears all strings after each option. Lines 30 
and 40 define some constants and strings. The five options are dis- 
played in lines 50 and 60. The menu selections are processed in lines 70 
through 130. 

Lines 280 through 320 and 140 through 210 are the standard methods 
for reading and writing text files, while lines 340 through 370 and 220 
through 260 use fast string transfer to load and save the strings. 

How It Works. In order to understand the details, let's look at how 
Applesoft deals with string arrays. A program can create strings in 
several ways: by input commands, string definitions in the program, 
concatenation (C$=A$-FB$), and so on. Applesoft places these strings 
in any convenient place, for example, between himem and lomem or 
even, in the case of direct string assignments (A$ = "DOG"), right in the 
program itself. In order to find these strings, Applesoft uses a table (ar- 
ray space) of pointers. When a program needs a string, Applesoft looks 
for the name of the string in the table. The area of the table correspond- 
ing to the name contains the length and starting address of the actual 
string. 

To try this yourself, run the following program: 

10 A$(0) = "12" 

20 A$(1) = "345" 

30 B$(0) = "6789" 

40 A$(3) = "24" 

50 B$(1) = "579" 



The Demo. Listing 2 is a sample program with five options: (1) save 
strings to a text file, (2) save strings to a binary file, (3) load strings from 
a text file, (4) load strings from a binary file, (5) end.

— 151 . The table of pointers begins at the address given in locations $6B 
and $6C. So type: 6B.6C and observe:

This means that $853 is the beginning of the table of pointers. Part of 
that table is listed in figure 3 . 

853: 41 A$( ) is the name and type of variable (41 is 
80 tlie ASCII code for A in hex).

Figure 4, The string A$(1). 



So A$(l) has length 3 and starts at $8 IB, according to the table. 
Figure 4 shows the contents of that string. 

As stated earlier, the idea of fast string transfer is to use the string 
pointers to find all of the strings and relocate them in a block, then bsave 
this block of strings. To recover them, the block is bloaded and then the 
string pointers are redefined so that they point to the appropriate strings 
within the block. Specifically, the strings in the B$ array will be moved 
to a block of memory starting at $6000. 

To help in the transition from the idea of fast string transfer to the 
machine language program (FST.O), let's see what the save and load 
subroutines look like as separate programs in Applesoft. Here is the save 
subroutine: 

10 I = 0:J = 0:AR = 0:K = 0:N = 0:X = 0:11 = 0:12 = 0:D$ = 

CHR$ (4): DIM B$(20) 
20 A$(0) = "12" 
30 A$(1) = "345" 
40 B$(0) = "6789" 
50 A$(3) = "24" 
60 B$(1) = ";,:" 

70 FOR I = 3 TO 12:B$(I) = CHR$ (64 + I): NEXT 

80 INPUT "ENTER B$(13) > ";B$(13) 

90 B$(14) = B$(13) + B$(13) 

100 J = PEEK (107) + 256 * PEEK (108) 

110 IF PEEK (J) = 66 AND PEEK (J + 1) = 128 GOTO 130 

120 J = J + PEEK (J + 2) + 256 * PEEK (J + 3): GOTO 110 

130 N = 15:J = J + 7 

140 II = 24576 

150 FOR 12 = 1 TO N 

160 IF PEEK (J) = 0 GOTO 190 



THUNDE 



170 X = PEEK (J + 1) + 256 * PEEK (J + 2) 

180 FOR I = 1 TO PEEK (J): POKE 11, PEEK (X):X = X + 1:11 - 11 

+ 1: NEXT I 

190 POKE 11,34:11 =11 + 1 

200 J = J + 3 

210 NEXT 12 

220 PRINT D$i"BSAVE VAR, A$6000,L", II - 24576 

Line 10 defines all of the variables used in the program so that, once 
we get the pointer for B$( ), it won't be changed by the introduction of 
new variables. (This is not necessary in the machine language version.) 
Lines 20 through 90 define some strings to be transferred. Line 100 sets 
J equal to the address of the beginning of the table of pointers. Lines 1 10 
and 120 find the beginning of the variable name B$( ) by looking for 66 
(the ASCII number for B in decimal) followed by 128. Line 130 sets N 
equal to the number of strings to be saved and moves the pointer, J, to the 
location of the address of B$(0). Lines 140 through 210 put each of the 
strings in consecutive order, separated by $22 (34 in decimal), in the 
memory starting at $6000. Then line 220 bsaves the block under the file 
name var. 

After the program is run, the memory contains the block of strings as 
shown in figure 5. Here is the load subroutine: 

10 DEF FN HI(X) = INT (X / 256): DEF FN LO(X) = X - 256 * FN 
HI(X) 

20 D$ = CHR$ (4):AR = 0:J = 0:K = 0:VR = 0;I1 = 0:LV = 0 

30 DIM B$(20) 

40 PRINT D$;"BLOAD VAR" 

50 J = PEEK (107) + 256 * PEEK (108) 

60 IF PEEK (J) = 66 AND PEEK (J + 1) = 128 GOTO 80 

70 J = J + PEEK (J + 2) + 256 * PEEK (J + 3): GOTO 60 

80 J = J + 7:VR = 1:11 = 0:X = 24576 

90 LV = 0: POKE J + 1, FN LO(X): POKE J + 2, FN HI(X) 

100 IF PEEK (X)< > 34 THEN II = II + 1 :LV = LV + 1 :X = X + 

1: GOTO 100 
110 POKEJ.LV 

120 IF II > = PEEK (43616) + 256 * PEEK (43617) - 1 GOTO 140

Line 30 sets the dimension for the B$ array so that, even though the 
values are not defined yet, a place for the pointers within the table has 
been assigned. The beginning of the table is found in line 50. Lines 60 
and 70 find the address of the beginning of the pointers for the array. 
Lines 80 through 1 30 poke the lengths and the beginning address of each 
string into the pointers. As the program runs, J is the pointer within the 
table and II is the pointer within the block of strings. VR is the number 
of the current string, and LV is its current length. Line 350 prints out the 
reconstructed variables. 



For Assembly Language Programmers Only. The assembly lan- 
guage versions of the save and load subroutines are combined into one 
machine language program with file name FST.O, in listing 1. The save 
subroutine actually starts at $9453 and the load subroutine starts at 
$94FE. Prior to calling the program, a 0 (for save) or 1 (for load) is 
poked into $9414 to select which of the two subroutines of FST.O is 
to run. 

In order to make FST.O easier to understand, we have tried to follow 
the corresponding Applesoft subroutines as closely as possible. 

How To Relocate the Block of Strings and Transfer Different 
Variables. The choice of $6000 for the beginning of the block of strings 
is arbitrary. It can be reset (along with himem) so long as it is below 
$9400 and leaves enough room for the variables (see figure 2). 

To make this change, proceed as follows. After bloading FST.O, 
poke the low and high bytes of the new starting address into $946B 
(37995) and $9470 (38000). Also do the same pokes to $950D (38157) 
and $95 IF (38175). In the example given earlier, to change the starting 
place of the block to $5000 (20480), just add the lines: 

40 POKE 37995, FN LO(20480) : POKE 38000, FN Hl(20480) 
45 POKE 38157, FN LO(20480) : POKE 38175, FN Hl(20480) 

The choice of the B$ array was also arbitrary. To use some other one- 
character variable name, just poke the new ASCII code into $9426 (37926) 
after bloading FST.O. For example, the following line could be added 

50 POKE 37926,65 

to use the variable array A$.

IHE BUFFER MD IT. 



Who Stole The 1500 Letters 
From The Computer? 

Let's just say you've got to 
send a letter to 1500 different 
people. Would you like to 
spend 22.5 hours* or 
60 seconds of 



v>5 



computer 
time? 

With 
a garden- 
variety 
buffer, the 
computer has 
to mix, merge 
and send 1500 

addresses and 1500 letters to the 
buffer. Trouble is, most buffers 
only store about 32 letters. So after 
32 letters, the computer's down 
until the printer's done. Altogether, 
you're talking 22.5 hours. 

In the case of our new (not to 
mention amazing) 



6ut 



ShuffleBuffer, 
computer time 
is 60 
seconds 



iove 



my w 



flat. 

Just give 
ShuffleBuffer one form letter and 
your address list, and it takes care 
of the mixing, the merging, and the 
printing. But that's not all 
ShuffleBuffer's stolen from the 
computer. Oh, no. 

Who Changed and 
Rearranged The Facts? 

Again, ShuffleBuffer's 
the culprit. You want 
to move para- 
graph #1 
down 
where 
#3 is? 
Want 
to add a 
chart or 
picture? No 

problem. No mystery, either. Any 
buffer can give you FIFO, basic 
first-in, first-out printing. And some 



buffers offer By-Pass; the ability to 
interrupt long jobs for short ones. 
But only ShuffleBuffer has what we 
call Random Access Printing — the 
brains to move stored information 
around on its way to the printer. 
Something only a computer could 
do before. Comes in especially 
handy if you do lots of printing. 
Or lengthy manuscripts. 
Or voluminous green 




and white spread ^ ^ ' 
sheets. And by the 
way, ShuffleBuffer 
does store up to 
128K of information 
and gives you a 
By-Pass mode, too. . \sw°'° 

And Who Spilled The 
Beans 239 Times? 

Most buffers can't 
tell the printer to 
duplicate. If they can, 
they only offer a 
start/stop switch, 
which means you're 
the one who has to 
count to 239. Turn 
your back on your 
buffer, and your 
printer might shoot out 
a room full of copies. 
ShuffleBuffer, however, 
does control quantity. 
Tell it the amount, and 
it counts the copies. 
By itself. 

So, What's The Catch? 

There isn't any 
Sleuth 
around. 
You won't 
find another 
buffer that's as slick a 
character as this one. 
You also won't find one that's 
friendly with any parallel or serial 
computer/printer combination. 
This is the world's only universal 
buffer. 
With a brain. 



Who Wants You To Catch 
A ShuffleBuffer In Action? 

You guessed it. We do. Just go to 
your local computer dealer and ask 
him to show you a ShuffleBuffer at 
work. Or, you can call us 
at (215) 667-1713, and 
we'll clue you in on 
all the facts directly. 

Based 
on an average 
4000 character letter 
^ & 128K buffer.

De-Wozzing the Apple II 

If you own an Apple II computer, you almost certainly know by now 
that there is something a little weird about the high-resolution graphics. 
You may have discovered it yourself while programming a video game, 
or you may have heard it from a friend or read about it in a graphics col- 
umn. Getting around it is the first thing we must do to begin drawing on 
our Apple's screen. 

This is unfortunate, since the idiosyncrasies of the Apple hi-res 
screen have little to do with our real topic, which is computer graphics. 
If only we could skip the weird stuff! Yet every book or column on Apple 
graphics begins by bombarding its poor reader with long, complicated 
descriptions of such things as graphics mappings and color conflicts and 
high bits and color bytes. 

In this month's column, we will attempt to pull off something of a 
coup, by bypassing this seemingly necessary but very dull technical gar- 
bage and approaching the Apple n as if we were graphics programmers 
with years of Apple experience and all of the answers. So instead of try- 
ing real hard to discern why given problems were solved in a certain 
way, we'll just present the solutions. These solutions will constitute the 
"correct" way to do Apple graphics. 

Later on, you may want to go back and try to fully understand hi-res 
in all its strangeness so that you can come up with your own solutions. 
We can't stop you if you insist on wallowing in it, but we won't do it 
here. We want to keep this column clean. 

The two sections that follow deal with assembly language issues but 
are not marked with asterisks as being for assembly programmers 
because they are basic and, compared with some implementation sec- 
tions in later columns, quite simple. If you don't know assembly 
language for the 6502, read on anyway— it's healthy to read about things 
you hate every once in a while. 

Vertical De-Wozzing. Before there were any books or articles on the 
Apple's hi-res graphics, and when Woz was just a mysterious name on 
some Monitor ROM listings, the first Apple graphics programmers had 
to explore the hi-res screen with nothing but peeks and pokes and their 
own powers of induction. All of these people remember a period of 
several days, in 1978 or 1979, when they sat before their new computers 
and tried to discover the correspondence between the hi-res screen 
memory in their Apples and the dots on their television sets. 

The process went something like this. First, poke a number into the 
screen memory of the Apple (the old red manual at least told you that the 
screen memory began at address $2000). Second, form a theory about 
where the neighboring dots are located in memory. Third, poke another 
number into the memory to test your theory. Fourth, go back and form 
another theory if you find that your first theory was wrong. 

If you had followed this program, one of the first things you would 
have discovered is that the first row of dots, at the very top of the televi- 
sion screen, corresponds exactly to the forty bytes of screen memory 
starting at address $2000, the beginning of the hi-res screen memory. 



We call this first row of forty bytes "scan line" number one. Being a 
logical person, you then might have theorized that the second row of dots 
from the top, scan line number two, corresponded to the next forty bytes 
of screen memory starting at $2028. 

You would have been startled to discover that this was not true at all . 
Scan line two began somewhere else in memory. The rows of dots and 
their corresponding scan lines in screen memory were all scrambled. 

At first this seemed like a bad thing. What could those guys in Cuper- 
tino have been thinking of? Stories circulated that Woz had saved four 
chips by using this scrambled hi-res system. Was this worth all the extra 
programming effort it appeared to require? 

Today, years later, it's clear that it doesn't matter at all how the scan 
lines are stored in the screen memory. Woz had picked the most conven- 
ient system from his point of view, since it did not require a multiplica- 
tion to find the address of a scan line. The more obvious system, where 
the scan lines were stored consecutively in memory, did require a multi- 
plication. 

All of this is academic, however, since the only sane way to find a 
scan line in screen memory is to use a table. We now present solution 
number one— the scan line address table for the Apple II:

Ida scanline.lo.y 
Idx scanline.hi.y 

It couldn't be much easier than that. From now on, all you need to 
know about the Apple's scan line layout is that, yes, it is a little weird. 
The scan line address table, like the Force, will always be with you. 

Some clarification may still be needed. Let's write a short subroutine 
that uses the tables. The purpose of this routine is to clear a whole scan 
line to the color black. On entering the routine, the Y register contains 
the row number of the scan line to be cleared. 



clear, row 



clear, row. 1 



Ida scanline.lo.y 
sta base 
Ida scanline.hi.y 
sta base + 1 



Idy #39 
Ida #0 
sta (base),y 
dey 

bpl clear, row. 1 
rts 



;base is a zero-page location 

;base now contains the address 
; of scan line Y 

prepare to clear 40 bytes 
0 turns off dots 
this is a tight loop 



Now see how easy it is to get the address of a scan line. Suppose we 
have included these tables in our program, and that the Y register con- 
tains the row number, from 0 to 191 , of the scan line we wish to locate in 
the screen memory. Then the following two instructions will put the ad- 
dress of the required scan line in the A and X registers: 



As you can see, getting a scan line address is something we don't 
even have to think about anymore. Though this routine is just an example 
and not a part of the actual graphics package we will develop, it also il- 
lustrates one important point about assembly language programming 
style. 

The most important part of this routine is the loop beginning at 
clear.row.l, because this is where most of the work gets done. In case 
you didn't notice, we cleared the forty bytes of scan line Y in reverse or- 
der, from byte 39 to byte 0. The reason for this is to eliminate the need 
for a CPY instruction in the loop. Since this CPY instruction would be 
executed forty times, the time saving is significant. 

The style lesson is this: Know which parts of your program are ex- 
ecuted most frequently and do what you can to make these routines as ef-

ficient, or, as a programmer would say, as "tight," as you possibly can. 
This implies knowing how many machine cycles each instruction re- 
quires and which condition codes it sets. If you know the 6502 instruc- 
tions but don't know these details, you aren't as good a programmer as 
you could be. 

Horizontal De-Wozzing. We have solved half of the graphics map- 
ping problem on the Apple II. Given a row number from 0 to 191, we 
can get the address of the forty bytes making up that row of dots. But 
once we have that address, which bytes in the line do we modify? This is 
the second half of the problem: the horizontal mapping. 

If, as before, we imagine ourselves an early explorer of Apple hi-res, 
another of our first observations would have been that changing any one 
byte in a scan line affected exactly seven dots on the screen. As we con- 
tinued our poking, we would have found that the first byte on any given 
scan line controls the leftmost seven dots, the second byte controls the 
next leftmost seven dots, and so on to the thirty-ninth byte, which con- 
trols the rightmost seven dots on the scan line. 

"How," we then might have asked, "does a byte in memory control 
dots on the screen?" We would have quickly found that poking $00 into 
a byte cleared the seven dots, while poking $7F turned all of them on. 
After trying a few more values (hopefully not all 256 possible values, 
which is a lot of poking), we might have arrived at the correct conclusion 
that we should visualize a hi-res byte in its binary representation— a 
series of ones and zeros. The ones then tell us which dots are on and the 
zeros tell us which ones are off. 

So far, we have treated the screen as if it were only a black-and-white 
display. Most of the confusion about Apple hi-res arises because there 
are at least three distinct but valid ways of thinking about the graphics 
screen. We want to avoid any confusion, so for now we'll just think of 
the hi-res screen as a 280-by-192 array of black-and-white dots. This will 
help keep things simple. 

Now that we know the mapping, the problem of getting to a particular 
dot on a scan line becomes one of division. If we want to modify dot 50 
on a given scan line, we must look at byte 8 (the first seven bytes contain 
dots 0 through 48) and in particular at bit number 2 (bit number 1 cor- 
responds to dot 49). In general, to get the required byte number, we 



divide the dot number by 7 and take the quotient. To get the bit number, 
we take the remainder after the division by 7. 

Seven is an interesting number, especially when it is our divisor and 
we are programming on a microcomputer without a divide instruction. If 
Woz had used all eight bits in each hi-res byte, we would be dividing by 
8 and there would be no problem, since the quotient and remainder of a 
division by 8 are easy to compute. But 7, not being divisible by 2, is the 
worst case divisor on a binary digital computer. 

But we only need to consider 280 different dividends, since this is the 
width, in dots, of a scan line. This relatively small number of values, 
together with the high cost of the calculation (division by 7), makes this 
operation a prime candidate for solution via tables. In fact, that is how 
we will solve it. We now present solution number two: the quotient and 
remainder tables for division by 7.

As with our scan line address table, the division problem becomes ab- 
solutely trivial. To get the quotient and remainder of the X register divid- 
ed by 7 into the A and Y registers, we need execute only the following 
instructions. 

Ida quotient7,x 
Idy remainder7,x 

There is a slight problem remaining. We said that there were 280 dots 
on a scan line, yet we seem to be trying to get away with a table that has 
only 256 entries. Shouldn't we add twenty-four more entries? The 
answer is a definite no, because of the addressing capabilities of the 
6502. Since the X and Y index registers are capable of counting only 
from 0 to 255, we cannot have tables of more than 256 bytes without suf- 
fering a large access time penalty. We can get away with our undersized 
tables, using the following trick for dots numbered 256 to 279 (X now 
contains only the least significant byte of the dot number, which is 
greater than 256): 

Ida quotient7-(-4,x 
cic 

adc #36 

Idy remainder7-H4,x 

This is just a trick. Think about it for a while; if you don't get it, 
forget it. All you have to know is that it works. 

Let's put a few things together now, in another little routine. This one 
will turn on any single dot on the hi-res screen, as long as the dot number 
is less than 256 (we won't derive the more general full-screen version, 
because this routine, like the last one, isn't in our graphics package). On 
entry, Y contains the scan line on which the dot lies, and X contains the 
dot number.

Counting machine cycles up to draw. dot. 1 , we find that we need only 
twenty-four microseconds to get to most of the dots on the hi-res screen. 
This is equivalent to over forty thousand dots per second. This is close to 
optimal on an Apple II. 

Now that we know how to home in on any dot on the hi-res screen, a 
natural question arises. What do we do when we get there?

Z-80-based card was the first of what has

to offer Apple owners? Because there is now an 
enormous collection of Z-80- and 8080- 
based CP/M software that can run on your ver- 
satile Apple . Because the world was well pop- 
ulated with Z-80 and 8080 microcomputers

much more time to accu-

nominal cost. You aren't going to uncover a WordStar or dBase equiva- 
lent in the public domain, but you will find some less sophisticated but 
still reliable text processors and some excellent utility programs to aug- 
ment the few that are provided with the SoftCard. 

Distributed nationally by two CP/M user groups, the CP/MUG and 
SIG/M, this public-domain software is supplied to other clubs and user 
groups around the country; these organizations in turn distribute the soft- 
ware to their members. The bad news for Apple users is that national 
distribution is made only on 8-inch disks and NorthStar-formatted 
5 '/4 -inch floppy disks. The good news is that several local clubs have 
transferred some of the better programs to Apple-formatted disks. In ad- 
dition, some have placed public-domain files on remote bulletin board 
systems (RBBSs) so that anyone who has a modem and appropriate soft- 
ware may download them. 

Description of the Utilities. To get a flavor of some of the tasty 
treats in the CP/M public domain, let's run through the capabilities of a 
dozen or so utilities that have proven useful and reliable. The majority of 
these utilities can be used on an Apple equipped with any of the Z-80 
cards, not just the SoftCard. But some of these utilities have been 
modified to deal specifically with the Apple/SoftCard envirorunent. Con- 
sequently, they expect to find certain data or routines in certain loca- 
tions, as they are on the SoftCard. But since the software used with other 
Z-80 boards is different, when the utility goes to access this information 
or code, it won't be there. This can mean anything from erroneous out- 
put to wiping out your system, so it's important to copy any disk you're 
going to be working with. That way, you won't run the risk of damaging 
anything you can't replace. 

Table 1 contains a list of some of the best utilities for use in the Apple 
II/Z-80 computer. The one ASM file shown in table 1 must be cus- 
tomized to your needs, which requires your reassembling this source 
file. Utilities that do not require customization are shown in COM file 
form only. 

CAT.COM/FMAP.COM/UCAT.COM. The first file in table 1, 
CAT.COM, along with FMAP.COM and UCAT.COM, comprises a 
master disk cataloguing system that enables you to catalog the files on all 
your CP/M disks. It's then possible to search that master catalog by am- 
biguous or unambiguous file name, or by ambiguous or unambiguous 
disk name. This system was created by Ward Christensen, who also 
originated the DU disk utility system that we'll look at a little later. 

This disk cataloguing system requires that you assign each disk a 
label, not unlike a CP/M file name, consisting of an eight-character 
name plus a three-character extension. This disk-name system allows 
you to retrieve such file catalogs as, for instance, all directly executable 
game files, through the use of an ambiguous file reference such as: 

CAT *.COM GAMES.* 

Or, you could find all of your assembler source files on utility programs 
using a catalog reference such as: 

CAT *.ASM UTILITY.*

If you take the time to work out an appropriate disk-labeling convention 
to suit your needs, it's a very handy system. 

CLEANUP.COM. CLEANUP.COM is a simple utility for dcletmg 
disk files without having to enter any file names. This utility presents one 
file name at a time from a designated disk and offers you the option to 
delete that file with a single keystroke or to skip to the next file name. 
Besides providing a quick way to expunge unwanted files from a disk, 
CLEANUP.COM can also be used to delete directory entries that in- 
clude nonprinting characters. There are several programs (SAP, de- 
scribed presently, is one) that create unwanted directory entries con- 
sisting, in part or totally, of nonprinting characters. It's impossible to 
delete these files with the ERA command unless you examine a hex 
dump of the directory to identify the embedded control characters. And 
then sometimes it's still impossible. 

COMPARE.COM. This utility compares any two disk files to deter- 
mine whether they are identical. If the files differ, COMPARE.COM in- 
forms you of the first nonidentical byte pair in the two files. This utility 
helps determine whether your local sources of public-domain software 
contain identical files under different file names. 

DISPLAY.COM. DISPLAY.COM is basically a replacement for 
the built-in CP/M command, TYPE. When this utility is applied to a text 
file, that file scrolls onto the monitor one twenty-two-line page at a time. 
Pressing return displays the next twenty -two-line page. At the end of any 
page, you can enter a command like 5L or — 3P to display text for- 
ward five lines or back three pages from the currently displayed page. 

DU.COM (Current Version Is v77). There are many versions of 
Ward Christensen's disk access utility, DU.COM, among the various 
public-domain libraries, but only v75 and later versions seem to operate 
correctly in the Z-80 Apple environment. With DU.COM, you can 
locate disk sectors associated with any file, review the contents of any 
sector in hex and/or ASCII, and modify the file, byte by byte, if you 
wish. These are capabilities common to all decent disk access utilities. 
But DU goes a little farther than most in total capability and flexibility. 
First you can access the disk by specifying the group (or block) number, 
or by using a track/sector number combination. And there is an ASCII 
string search command with which you can find a file name in the direc- 
tory or any other character string of interest. 

Another aid to finding a sector of interest is a command that dumps a 
map of all the group allocations for each file. The same command, when 
executed with a group number as a parameter, quickly returns the name 
of the file that occupies that group. 

Once having located a sector of interest, you may display the sector 
contents in hex, ASCII, or both. The plus and minus keys allow you to 
advance to the next logical sector or retreat to the previous logical sector. 
Commands can be concatenated and set to be repeated a specified 
number of times (or until interrupted). A single command line, then, can 
do such things as display the current sector, pause, access the next sec- 
tor, and then repeat these three actions until you stop it. This is very 
handy for scanning through a disk when you are not quite sure what it is 
that you are seeking (we all do that— don't we?). 

Finally, while this utility is command-driven, a handy command 
reminder menu can be displayed at any time via a single keystroke. All in 
all, DU.COM is a very compact, flexible, and useful utility. 

DUPUSR.COM. DUPUSR.COM duplicates a directory entry under a 
different user number on the same disk or hard disk volume. Why is this 
useful? Well, if you're running standard density 5 W -inch floppies, it 
probably isn't. If, however, you ever go to high-capacity floppy drives 
or to a hard disk, you'll discover that directories can get very large if you 
keep all of your files in a single user area. If you do organize your files 
into multiple-user areas, you'll have some files you'll want to be able to 
run from any user area (your text editor, or your special directory utility, 
for example). Since you cannot (under garden-variety CP/M, but see 
ZCPR discussion later) execute a command file that resides in one user 
area while you are logged into another user area, without DUPUSR 
you'd have to store your multiple-use files in each user area in which you 
might want to use them. DUPUSR allows you to replicate the directory 
entry in each of those user areas without taking up additional disk space 
for the file itself. Be aware, though, that modifying the directory can 
cause disk problems. 

flNDBAD.COM. FINDBAD.COM performs a nondestructive test 
of your disk media and locks out any sectors that are found to be bad. 

GOTO.ASM/GOTO.COM. The next utility, GOTO.COM, is a 



108 



NOVEMBER 1983 



neat way to find your way among the various user areas that you may 
have defined on your disk system. For example, if you've assigned the 
label RBBS to user area 6 on drive C:, then the command 

GOTO RBBS 

will log you on to drive C:, user 6. GOTO saves you from having to 
remember each user area assignment in your disk organization structure. 
Table 2 shows some example responses to the three forms of the GOTO 
command. Naturally, you'll need the ASM file so that you can reassem- 
ble it to your own user assignments and labels. 

GOTO.COM can be a very useful utility, especially if several users 
are sharing one computer. With it, you can label areas for individual 
users so that they'll be able to find their files easily and not stumble into 
yours by mistake. 

SAP.COM. SAP is an acronym for "sort and purge," and that ac- 
curately describes what this utility does. By invoking a command like 
SAP B:, you can purge the drive B: disk directory of any zero-length 
files and sort the remaining file names alphabetically. Alphabetization 
makes directories easier to read when the CP/M intrinsic command DIR 
is being used. If you switch from DIR to SD (see the next utility descrip- 
tion), then an alphabetized disk directory isn't necessary. 

SAP has one unfortunate side effect. It creates a false directory entry 
consisting of nonprinting control characters on your disk. You may not 
notice it with the DIR command, but it will be quite evident if you ex- 
ecute a STAT *.* command. The nonprinting file name can be deleted 
with CLEANUP.COM. 

SD.ASM/SD.COM. This utility is a replacement for the built-in 
function DIR. SD.COM displays the directory file names to the screen 
four across alphabetically, with each file size shown in kilobytes. The 
number of directory entries and the used and unused file space are sum- 
marized at the bottom of the directory listing. 

Using SD.COM, you can "find" particular files or directory 
categories by means of standard CP/M ambiguous file name conven- 
tions. For example, SD d*.COM finds only COM files that begin with

specified ambiguous file name. By using the A (all-user) and D (all- 
drives) options separately, you can catalog all user areas on one drive or 
one user area on all drives. A useful directory program even in the stan- 
dard 5!4 floppy environment, SD.COM is almost indispensable in the 
large-capacity disk environment. 

TED.COM. What a lousy text editor ED.COM is. Unless you've 
already moved on to WordStar, you'll welcome TED.COM to replace 
ED.COM. For a freebie text editor, TED.COM is very good. It's a line- 
oriented editor, with a nice, direct substitution command of the form: 

s/old string/new string/[g] 

where [g] is the global replacement indicator. Other commands include 
APPEND (to current line), DELETE (lines), INSERT (line), COPY, 
LOCATE, MOVE, and PRINT line. One of the nicest and most unex- 
pected features is the instruction request command, which brings com- 
mand reminders up on-screen. This feature is invoked by entering a 
question mark as the first character on a line, followed by the first letter 
of the command in question. 

TURNKEY.COM. TURNKEY, which has been placed in the public 
domain by Microsoft, enables you to execute intrinsic CP/M commands 
or programs automatically upon cold boot. This is analogous to the hello 
program capability in Apple DOS. With TURNKEY, you can even run a 
program on another disk, as long as that disk is present in the drive you 
specify in the TURNKEY command. 

Here are some example commands showing how TURNKEY is used: 

TURNKEY STATB:*.* 
TURNKEY MBASIC CONFIGIO 
TURNKEY DIP 



your ERA command, and several new commands, including LIST, 
which sends a text file out to your printer. 

If you're working in a large-capacity disk environment (floppies or 
hard disk), the most important feature of ZCPR is its command search 
hierarchy. This feature allows you to execute command files on drives 
and from user areas other than the one onto which you are logged, and 
without specifying the drive/user area containing the file. Now that's 
handy in the big disk world. It means that you can put all of your system 
utilities (SD.COM, STAT.COM, GBASIC.COM, and so on; in one 
disk/user area and invoke those commands from any user area on any 
drive or hard disk volume. In the standard versions of ZCPR, a com- 
mand is checked against potential sources according to the following 
command hierarchy: 

(1) resident ZCPR/CCP commands 

(2) COM file on a current user number on tine current drive 

(3) COM file on a default user number on the current drive 

(4) COM file on current user on drive A: 

(5) COM file on the default user number on dnve A: 

This modification adds one more place to look for the command file, 
drive A:, on the current user number. This allows you to log on to your 
data disk (or hard-disk data volume) and invoke command files from the 
same user area on drive A: without specifying the drive letter. 

Program Availability. These are not the only good programs to be 
found in the wonderful world of public domain, but they are a good 
beginning in the Apple/SoftCard arena. You may be able to find copies 
of them through your local CP/M computer club or on your local RBBS. 
If you can handle 8-inch format, you can deal directly with the CP/MUG 
or SIG/M libraries at the addresses that follow. Hi 



Setting up a turnkey disk requires that you have TURNKEY.COM on 
the disk. You then must issue any logical TURNKEY command of the 
nature defined above. After the command has successfully been ex- 
ecuted, that disk will perform your TURNKEY command the next time 
you use that disk to boot your system.

To enter the TURNKEY program, execute the DDT utility that came 
with your SoftCard. When you see DDT's prompt (a minus sign), enter 
SIOO. When DDT returns the address 100, enter all the hex byte values 
from the program dump above, following each byte with a carriage 
return. After entering the final value (and the return), enter a period, 
followed by a return, to get the DDT prompt back. Then hit control-C to 
get back to the CP/M command mode where you can issue a save com- 
mand to store your TURNKEY program to disk. That command should 
look like this: 

SAVE 1 TURNKEY.COM 

(Note: TURNKEY.COM does not work with CP/M versions prior to 
2.20B.) 

UNERA.COM. Here's a little utility you'll probably never need. It 
can be used to unerase a file you just erased inadvertently. It's unlikely 
that you'd ever do such a thing, but it could happen (it has already hap- 
pened to everyone else but you!). And, of course, it only works if you 
haven't saved new files since the unfortunate ERA occurred. 

ZCPR.COM. The last program file mentioned in table 1 is 
ZCPR.COM. This is not really a utility but, rather, a modification to 
your CP/M Console Command Processor, better known as the CCP. 
After running ZCPR on your CP/M boot disk (or the boot volume on 
your hard disk), you have an improved and extended set of CCP com- 
mands. For instance, there's an improved TYPE command that can be 
used to display text files one screen at a time, an improved ERA com- 
mand that shows you on-screen exactly which files you just erased with

Kids have it rough with moms always 
screaming at them to clean up their rooms. 
Dads are a little more diplomatic about it; they 
say things like, "A place for everything, and 
everything in its place." Unfortunately, that's 
not always true. Some things just don't have a 
place; magazines you haven't finished reading, 
clothes you wore yesterday that aren't dirty yet, 
purses, and everything that doesn't belong on 
the desk all belong on the bed. 

Ideally— parents often seem to live in an 
ideal world when you're a kid — there should be 
a place for everything, and each thing should be 
there. The reasons for such an unfollowable 
rule are because it supposedly makes things 
easier to find when you need them (never the 
case), and it looks nice. The boss at work will 
never tell his underlings to clean up their desks. 
Instead, he'll say, "Simpson, a cluttered desk 
represents a cluttered mind" (what does an 
empty desk represent?). 

A Clean Disk Is a Happy Disk. In the 
world of microcomputers, most of us are free 
from our haranguing parents and iron-fisted 
bosses, but it's still recommended that we keep 
our things nice and tidy — not just to keep some- 
one else happy, but because it really is a good 
idea. 

By tidiness, we're not talking about scrub- 
bing the outer case of the Apple or dusting off 
the keyboard. One of the most important places 
to keep a neat house is on your disks. The first 
and most obvious way to take care of disks is to 
make sure they don't become physically 
damaged. 

When the great disk gods put floppy disks in 
the hands of humans, they said, "Always 
remember and never disobey rule number zero: 

"0. Thou shalt always keep disks away 
from magnetic fields like magnets, color televi- 
sion sets, and electric motors." 

And then they said, "Always remember and 
never disobey rule number one: 

"1. If thou blow it on rule number zero, 
don't come crying to us." 

In other words, if you mess up a disk by 
leaving it by the television set or the electric 
fan, it's your own fault, and you've probably 



learned a valuable lesson. 

The disk gods knew what they were talking 
about. Remember that the disks the Apple 
records data on are made of Mylar (a material 
similar to plastic), but they're coated with a 
substance that is highly sensitive to magnetic 
fields. If it were possible to see that substance, 
it would look like a whole bunch of tiny bar 
magnets. When the computer saves information 
to disk, it turns all those magnets in various 
directions to represent the information you want 
to save. 

Thus, when magnetic fields come along and 
start messing with those little bar magnets, all 
the data you spent hours creating is destroyed. 
To illustrate, suppose you keep your financial 
records in a ledger book. To have a magnet in 
close proximity to your floppy disk would be 
like pouring water over the pages of your book. 
All the ink runs (scream here), making 
everything unintelligible. Back to square one. 

Another good rule to keep in mind is never 
to touch the exposed oval area of a disk. Since 
that's where the disk drive actually reads and 
writes information, it's a very sensitive area. 
The back (under) side of a disk is the side where 
the Apple disk drive records information, so it's 
extremely important to take care of that side. 

Though your hands may look clean, they can 
still have enough dirt, oil, and other gunk on 
them to mess up a disk. A well-placed finger- 
print on a floppy is like spilling an ink bottle 
across your ledger book. Even if it covers up 
just one number on the page, it's enough to 
throw your whole ledger sheet off, making you 
a prime target for the Internal Revenue Service. 
Back to square one, again. 

Finally, let's try to keep disks out of places 
that are hot (in the sun, on top of the monitor, in 
the oven). Mylar is a very durable synthetic, but 
like plastic it's also very sensitive to heat. If 
your disk happens to warp, melt, or otherwise 
change shape, that's like setting your ledger 
book on fire. 

In short, disks are delicate little creatures 
and should be treated as such. Now that we have 
acquired such good habits in handling disks, 
let's look a little closer and learn how to keep 



things orderly on the disk, where things aren't 
so visible. 

Son of Init Hello. A few months ago, we 
learned the bare bones about how to initialize a 
disk. All that was required was to boot a disk 
that has DOS on it, take the disk out, insert a 
new disk, and type init Hello. In many cases, 
that is indeed all you need to do. But sometimes 
this isn't the best way to do it. 

If you booted the Apple System Master disk 
to load DOS into the Apple and then initialized a

disk, you'll get the same hello program on your 
new disk as that on the System Master. When 
you boot your new disk, the drive will spin 
around for a few seconds while it loads DOS. If 
you have an Apple lie or a 64K Apple H, you'll 
then receive a nasty beep and a file not found 
message. 

An explanation is in order. Type list 210 (He 
people, type list 60,70) to see what's going on. 
If your Apple has at least 64K, those lines in the 
program tell it to load Intbasic, an assembly 
language program that interprets Integer Basic. 

If you followed the simple initialization 
process we just described, you shouldn't have 
Intbasic on your newly initialized disk. That's 
why you get the file not found message; the Ap- 
ple looks at line 210 (or 60 and 70), which tells 
it to load a file, but it can't find a file by that 
name on the disk. There are two solutions to 
this problem. The first would be to change the 
program so it doesn't try to load a file that's not 
on the disk. The second way would be to put 
Intbasic on your new disk so it can be loaded in- 
to memory. Let's take a look at each possibility. 

Integer— Who Needs It, Anyway? If 
you're formatting a disk for the sole purpose of 
storing data on it, you probably won't need a 
hello program as complex as the one on the 
System Master. That one looks to see if you 
have 64K; if you do, it tries to load Integer 
Basic into machines that have Applesoft built 
in, or it tries to load Applesoft if you have In- 
teger built in. In fact, most data disks don't need 
a hello program at all. It's just that when you 
load DOS into memory, the only way to do it is 
with a disk that already has DOS on it, and 
many times those disks have a hello program of 
some sort on them. 

Two reasons for getting rid of a big hello 
program if you're formatting a data disk are that 
you don't need one and that it gives you more 
space on the disk to use for storage. Here's an 
alternate way of initializing a data disk. 

Boot the System Master as before. Now, 
type fp, which clears memory of any Basic pro- 
gram. Next, type in the following very short 
program: 

10 

When you're done with all that typing, take 
a rest and then type Init Hello. This initializes 
the disk with that little one-line program. After 
it's finished formatting, catalog the disk, and 
you'll see a two-sector program called Hello on 
the disk. If you're dabbling in Basic, you can 
initialize disks with customized programs to do 
whatever suits your fancy. If you want, instead 
of initializing a disk with a program, just load 
DOS from a disk, type jp, and then initialize 
your disk with no program at all. The choice 
is yours. 

Integer — I Need It! Sometimes you want 
your hello program to load the dialect of Basic 
you don't have. If your machine has Applesoft 
built into it and you want to program in Integer, 
or vice versa, you'll want that version of Basic 
to load into memory when your disk boots. In 
this case, we need to do a bit of file moving. 

In order to please most of the people most 
of the time, we'll assume that Applesoft is the 
resident language in our machines. Only early 
vintage Apple lis have Integer as the built- 



in tongue. 

To prepare a disk that loads Integer (or Ap- 
plesoft) when it boots is quite simple. First, just 
boot the System Master disk as usual and then 
type init Hello. This puts the System Master's 
hello program on your new disk. Then all you 
need to do is copy the appropriate file that gives 
you the desired Basic from the System Master 
to your new disk. 

For the Apple n and n Plus, we just need to 
transfer the file, Intbasic (Fpbasic, if you want 
Applesoft); in other words, the only two files 
needed are Intbasic and Hello. 

For the Apple lie, we need to transfer Int- 
basic plus a file called Loader. objO. The hello 
program on the lie System Master will not load 
Integer unless both of these files are present. 
The same goes for Applesoft; Fpbasic and 
Loader. objO are required. So for a He disk, 
three files are needed — Hello, Loader. objO, and 
Intbasic (or Fpbasic). Got it? 

You might have noticed that Loader. objO, 
Intbasic, and Fpbasic are all binary files. To 
copy these files from one disk to another 
without too much perspiration, it's advisable to 
use the Fid program. Initialized disks aren't of 
much use unless we put things on them. And 
once you start putting things on disks, the 
chances are almost 100 percent that things will 
occasionally go wrong. Be prepared. 

Excuses, Excuses. The Boy Scouts' motto, 
"Be prepared," means "Have the right equip- 
ment." Among other things, that means you 
should always have some answers ready in case 
you flub up. 

Typical is the scene in which little Billy is 
running through the house with his arms 
outstretched playing Air Force Ace or some- 
thing of the sort. Before long, he gets carried 
away and accidentally knocks over the family 
vase. Crash! When Mom comes home, the real 
fun begins. 

Furious, she confronts Billy. "Who knocked 
over the vase Grandma gave us?" she de- 
mands, knowing well that it could have only 
been Billy. 

Desperate to save his bottom side and tele- 
vision privileges, Billy searches for an an- 
swer. "An elf came in through the window and 
broke it." 

"There aren't any windows in this room, 
Billy," Mom responds. 

"He brought it with him." 

It's not hard to see how kids can exercise 
their imaginations when the situation is 
desperate, but it's not only kids who do so. 
What was the last excuse you used when one of 
your data files became garbled or disappeared 
for no apparent reason? Some favorites include: 
There are hoodoos messing around with the 
disks, a gigantic magnetic force must have passed 
through the house, it was poltergeists, this 
stupid machine must have a mind of its own, 
and the moon must be out of line with Jupiter 
and Mars. 

Thanks to computer hobbyists turned 
capitalists, there are plenty of programs on the 
market that can help you fix disks and files that 
have been damaged. What we're going to get 
into, though, is preventive care. That is, how to 
take care of things so they don't get screwed up 
in the first place. 



NOVEMBER 1983 



If you never believed in the supernatural, 
you might start when you see some of the things 
that happen on disks. The solution isn't to hire 
yourself a witch doctor or exorcist but to find 
out why things happen and what to do in order, 
to prevent them from happening again. One 
frustrating haunting is having the computer tell 
you the disk is full when you're trying to save 
a file. 

The most obvious solution is to keep track of 
how many sectors you have left before trying to 
cram more stuff on a disk. A DOS 3.3 disk has 
560 sectors on it. DOS takes up three tracks (3 
X 16 = 48 sectors) and the catalog takes up one 
track (1 X 16 = 16 sectors), so we have only 
496 sectors available (560 - (48 + 16) = 496). 
That's a lot of sectors, but if your word process- 
ing files average about fifty sectors in length 
(about ten double-spaced pages), you can fit on- 
ly nine or ten files on the disk. 

Add 'Em Up. One way to keep track of how 
much of a disk is empty is to add up the number 
of sectors that are used and subtract that from 
496. When you catalog a disk, the number that 
precedes the file name shows you how many 
sectors it occupies. Adding up the numbers in 
the column will give you a rough idea of how 
many sectors are taken, from which you can 
figure out how much space you have available. 
What it doesn't always tell you is how much 
space you should have available. 

Here's what we mean. Load Phone List 
from the Sample Programs disk (System Master 
for non-IIe fans). Once it finishes loading, 
remove the disk and save Phone List to your 
freshly initialized disk. Save it as Phone for 
short. When you catalog the new disk, you'll 
see Phone taking up fifty-one sectors. Now it's 
play time. 

To get an idea how huge the program is, list 
it, and you'll see that it takes about thirty 
seconds to list. Now type del 200,30000. This 
command deletes all the program lines from 200 
to 30000. When you list the program now, 
you'll see that it's only a few lines long— much 
shorter than before. Why, it probably shouldn't 
take up more than a few sectors. Save this 
shorter version as Phone again. 

What we've just simulated is the editing of a 
large file to a small one. But when you catalog 
the disk, you'll see that Phone still takes up 
fifty-one sectors on the disk, even though it's 
much smaller. This is one of those things the 
Apple does because it doesn't know any better. 
Once it marks off a certain number of sectors 
on the disk for a file, it keeps those sectors off 
limits to any other file, even if you shorten the 
file so that it no longer needs them. 

The Disk Is Lying. This means that if you 
have a disk with nine fifty-sector files on it, and 
you edit them all down to three sectors apiece, 
the catalog still shows each file occupying fifty 
sectors, even though they really use only three. 
In other words, if you try to put another fifty- 
sector file on the disk, the computer will tell 
you the disk is full, even though it shouldn't be. 

The solution to this is simple; we have to 
treat the short version of a file as a completely 
new file. With the small version of Phone still 
in memory, type delete Phone, and then save 
Phone. When we use the delete command, 
we're telling the Apple to remove the off-limits 




sign from the area where the long Phone used to 
be. Now it's legal to put stuff there. Then when 
we type save Phone, we're putting the short 
version on disk in its place. 

When you update or change files, some pro- 
grams simply save the new versions of your 
data right where the previous version was. In 
this case, if you ever shorten a data file, you'll 
end up with the catalog showing that the file 
takes up more room than it actually does, as 
we just finished illustrating here. To rectify 
this, you might want to delete the old file and 
save the new one on your own in order to con- 
serve disk space. On the other hand, some pro- 
grams delete your existing file before saving an 
updated one, taking care of this tedious process 
for you. 

Double Security. One of the safest ways to 



113 

make sure you don't lose data into oblivion is to 
make duplicates of your disks. This won't help 
in recovering data that you lose before you have 
a chance to save it, but it will help in case an elf 
comes in through the window (which he brings 
with him) and destroys your disks in their 
entirety. 

Saving everything on two di.sks while you're 
working can become a hassle, so luckily there 
are easier ways of copying disks. A popular 
way of backing up disks is with the CopyA pro- 
gram on the System Master. This program takes 
a look at your original disk and puts all the in- 
formation on the duplicate exactly as it appears 
on the original. Let's walk through it. 

To run this program, you have to have the 
Applesoft program CopyA and the binary pro- 
gram Copy.objO on the same disk. All you have

to do is tyf)e run Copy A; Copy. objO is loaded by 
Copy A. When the program comes on the 
screen, take the System Master disk out of the 
drive and insert the disk you want to copy. If 
you have two disk drives, insert the blank disk 
into the other drive. 

At this point, you'll be asked the slot 
number of the drive that holds the original disk. 
All you have to do is type in the slot number 
your drive is plugged into. The default slot is 6, 
which means, if you just hit the return key, the 
program will assume that the disk is in 
slot 6. 

Next, you're asked which drive number the 
original disk is in. One disk controller card can 
accommodate two drives (go ahead and look at 
it inside the Apple. There are two sets of pins 
marked drive 1 and drive 2), so it needs to know 
which drive has the original in it. Here, the 
default is drive 1; if you hit the return key, it 
assumes the original to be in drive 1 . 

Now that it knows where your original disk 
is, it asks you the same slot and drive questions 
about the duplicate you're going to make. If you 
have just one disk drive, enter the same slot and 
drive numbers as you did for the original. If 
not, enter the appropriate ones. For instance, 
if your duplicate's drive is plugged into the 
same controller card, enter the same slot 
number as the original, and 2 for the drive 
number if your original is in drive 1 . 

Rich people who have separate controller 
cards for each drive will have to enter the slot 
number for the duplicate, which is usually in 
slot 5. 

Now We're Ready To Rip. Once you've 
entered the slot and drive numbers for each 
disk, just follow the instructions that appear on 
the screen. For two-drive aristocrats, just hit the 
return key; the program will take care of the 
rest for you. It's a different story for the one- 
drive proletariat. 

Once the copy process has begun, the two- 
drive people can go have a cup of tea, or eat 
some crumpets, or do whatever it is they do in 
their spare time. One-drive people, however, 
must sit and monitor the computer at work. 
Because the drive can hold only one disk at a 
time, the program will ask you to remove the 
original and insert the duplicate several times 
during the copy process. 

The first thing CopyA does is read DOS 
from the original and initialize the duplicate. 
This is comparable to booting a disk, removing 
it, inserting a blank disk, and typing Init Hello. 
For the folks with one drive, the program stops 
and asks you to insert the duplicate and hit the 
return key. Once you do so, it begins initializ- 
ing the disk. 

You'll be asked to remove the duplicate and 
insert the original and vice versa a few times. 
What the computer's doing is reading a few sec- 
tors of the original, writing them on the 
duplicate, reading a few more sectors, writing 
them on the duplicate, and so on. It's sort of like 
siphoning the gasoline from your neighbor's car 
one mouthful at a time. 

The two-drive copy system is faster because 
it doesn't have to wait for you to switch disks. It 
reads a few sectors and writes them immedi- 
ately to the duplicate. This method is like using 
an electric pump to siphon your neighbor's 



gasoline. It's quicker, and it doesn't leave a fun- 
ny aftertaste. 

The whole copy procedure takes no more 
than a few minutes. Switching disks can get 
confusing, so make sure you're putting the right 
disk in at the right time, or the data you're at- 
tempting to copy might be lost forever. And it 
won't be the elves' fault. (A good precaution is 
to put a write-protection tab on the disk you're 
copying from.) 

A Final Measure. With backup disks in 
hand, put them in a safe place away from 
hazards like magnetic fields and hot 
temperatures. If little Billy knocks them off the 
shelf, they won't be damaged, but if he happens 
to spill Bosco or drop his Wrigley's Spearmint 
on them, put him in a place with lots of 



magnetic fields and hot temperatures. Like in- 
side a nuclear reactor. 

Before you forget, be sure to put labels on 
the duplicates so you know what they're 
duplicates of. Do not write on the disk with ball- 
point pen; it's better to use a felt-tip pen. Ball- 
points are useful for forms in triplicate that re- 
quire you to press hard when writing. That's ex- 
actly why they're not good for disks. But if 
some outside force compels you to use a ball- 
point pen, write on the label before sticking it 
on the disk. 

This has been just a small part of taking care 
of disks. Next time, we'll do a little more and 
start looking at the hows and whys of DOS com- 
mands and all their relatives, with lots of time 
left over for holiday shopping. Hi

Datamost President 
out of mind. 



At Datamost, we've got a president who knows the 
difference between "out of your mind" and having an 
"open mind." 

So he's building a computer software company that 
knows how to get the most out of any mind. 

Two years ago, when we began to publish the indus- 
try's first universally acclaimed system of computer 
software training books, we were told, "Datamost, 
you're crazy!" 

So we published anyway. 

Today, the hottest new software category is the com- 
puter Bookware market. 
And guess whose books are the #1 best-sellers? 
Yes, "crazy" Datamost. 

Somehow, our craziness made good book sense. And 
good business sense. Because our book language is 
language that everyday people use when they talk 
everyday talk. 

And Datamost talks Apple.* And we talk Atari.* 
And IBM.* And Commodore.* AndTimex/ Sinclair.* And 
T.I.*and more. 

For every level of computer literacy. From people 
who know nothing. To people who know everything. 

But our president wasn't satisfied. "Who says there's 
a limit to our craziness?" he demanded. 

"I want to see the Datamost name on the freshest, 
brightest, most mind-stretching arcade quality home 
computer games the industry has ever seen." 

And once again, we were told, "Datamost, you're 
crazy!" 

But this time, we said "you're right." 
So get ready. For games with original music for 
Apple, Atari, Commodore and IBM home computers. 
Coming to you. From Datamost. 
Where the most open mind is alive. And well. 
And crazy. Like a fox.

CHECKBOOK FINANCIAL SYSTEM 

For Apple" II, II + , He, III emulation, and Apple look-alikes - 48K DOS 3.3 



TAX WHACKER! 

The picture below shows my 1983 medical expenses 
exactly as printed by Money Street. Before year 
end, I'll use this report to plan tax strategy. Maybe 
I'll save on income taxes; maybe I won't. At least I 
get the chance to plan before the year is out. 

I'm Bob Payne, co-creator of Money Street, a new 
checkbook financial system for the Apple. This 
program saves me money because it doesn't miss a 
single deduction or tax credit. 

But Money Street does more than cut taxes. Look 
at the picture again. Notice emphasized type face 
Money Street can coax from my Epson (and many 
other dot matrix printers). After I'm done with 
Money Street, I leave my printer "on" and use this 
type face with my word processor. It's a small extra, 
but very handy. 

Show us a picture. People often ask to see 
Money Street's reports. They say, "Before I buy, I 
want to see what it does." We agree, so we've 
numbered the photo to explain things. 

Money Street prints 15 different reports. No set-up 
is required, just go to the report menu and select 
which report you want. See it on-screen or print it. 
Money Street's start-up-to-print-time is less than 20 
seconds. Shown below is the "Sort by Code" report: 

1. Each check, debit, and deposit gets its own entry 
number, an automatic feature of the program. 
You can get a printed record of all checkbook 
entires any time: a chronological history of your 
checkbook including your running balance each 
step of the way. A supurb audit tool! 

2. Use the "Filed Field" to locate cancelled 
checks because it shows the statement date 



each check cleared. This feature lets you keep all 
cancelled checks with their original bank 
statement just as most CPAs advise. 

3. Sort and print by check number to create a 
check register. 

4. You can sort by date to see monthly income, 
expenses, or net amounts. Print totals or details; 
just press one key. 

5. Not only can you sort by payee, you can sort on 
a "wildcard" option too. Many Money Street 
owners use this option to sort tax flag items. 

6. All print-outs show the report title plus today's 
Date. Not shown in photo, but included on all 
reports, is a spot for your name. 

7. You get 100 user-defined codes. To set up 
codes, just type them in. Add, Delete, or change 
codes any time without affecting data. 

You can code income items, expenses, or mix 
both for net amounts, for example, to see profits 
by categories. 

Sort by individual codes, groups of codes, or 
entire file. Year-to-date totals are always available 
with the press of a single key. 

8. Yes, you can even sort by amount. It's great for 
tracking down errors or seeing income or 
spending patterns. 

9. Every Money Street report includes your 
checking account name. 

10. Many reports also include detailed sub-totals, in 
this case the monthly sub-totals for code 50. 
Thus you get most of the details needed for 
budgeting, posting, or financial analysis.

The Magnificent Ampersands 



You have probably heard of the & command in Applesoft (also called 
the "ampersand vector" or the "and hook"), but you may not know 
what it is; the Apple reference manuals don't explain it very clearly. 
That's unfortunate, because it can be a very handy feature of the system 
if you know how to use it. It's a kind of "back door" entrance into 
assembly language: a way of connecting assembly language routines into 
a Basic program without using call statements. 

It works like this: Whenever the Applesoft interpreter finds an & 
character in a line of Basic, it jumps to a certain address in memory. That 
address normally contains an instruction that causes a return to the call- 
ing program, so nothing seems to happen, but that only means that the & 
hook is not connected to anything. You can change that and connect the 
& hook to a routine of your own. That way, whenever the & character 
(known as an ampersand) is used as a conmiand in an Applesoft pro- 
gram, the program will execute your assembly language routine. 

This does not apply within strings, of course: If the ampersand is part 
of a string, it will be treated just as a character, not as an Applesoft 
command. 

You can use this trick to connect an assembly language subroutine in- 
to your program wherever you need it. It's similar to a call statement 
but easier to use (once it's been set up). And that's not all: With a little 
extra work, you can include a selector function with your ampersand 
routine, so you can add a number to your & statement that will select a 
specific routine out of several. In fact, several commercial software 
packages using this idea have been published, with names like "Amper- 
sand Utility Pack" or the like. 

This article will show you how to create your own ampersand 
package. This will not be a set of utilities (maybe we'll do that some 
other time), but a "message center" — a routine to print a selected 
message from a small library. You can use it for prompts or hints in a 
game, help messages for a complex program, or similar applications. 
For more details on the utility package approach, see "The Handy & 
Hook" (Softalk, July 1983). 

The & Mailbox. In the Apple's memory, three successive locations 
have been reserved for the exclusive use of the ampersand hook. One 
memory location can store one byte of machine code— that is, one 
assembly language instruction, one byte of data, or half of a two-byte ad- 
dress. Three memory locations in a row can store a whole assembly 
language statement: "Jump to So-and-So" or "4C YY XX." 

In computerese, the fancy word for something that tells the program 
where to go next is vector; so these three bytes of memory are sometimes 
called the ampersand vector locations. Their addresses are 1013, 1014, 
and 1015 (decimal), or $3F5, $3F6, and $3F7 (hexadecimal— in case 



you're new to this, the dollar sign indicates a hexadecimal, or base 16, 
number). 

When the Apple is turned on, an initializing routine stores the bytes 
"4C 58 FF" in the & mailbox. $4C is the machine code form of the JMP 
instruction (jump: similar to goto in Basic), and the other two bytes make 
up the target address, $FF58 (in machine code, two-byte addresses are 
usually given low byte first— that is, backward). The address $FF58 con- 
tains a one-byte machine code instruction, $60: That's RTS in assembly 
language (return from subroutine), which is the same as return in Basic. 

This is the default configuration of the & vector— the setup for when 
it's not being used. It's a simple empty loop: "Do nothing, and then 
return." If the Applesoft interpreter finds an & command, the program 
will jump to the ampersand mailbox. There it will be told to jump to 
$FF58, where it will find the RTS instruction, which will send it back to 
the calling program to resume execution with the statement following the 
& command. 

To activate the & hook, all you have to do is change its vector ad- 
dress. If you change the address in locations 1014 and 1015 to point to a 
routine of your own, then the & command will cause a jump to your 
routine, instead of the RTS at $FF58 (don't forget to put an RTS at the 
end of your routine). 

Beep-Beep, for Example. To show you how it works, we can use a 
simple subroutine that will make the speaker beep twice. The Apple 
Monitor routine that beeps the speaker begins at address $FF3A, so the 
assembly language call to that routine would be JSR $FF3A — JSR stands 
for jump to subroutine, which is similar to the Basic gosub instruction. 
The machine code for JSR is $20, so the machine language form of our 
call is "20 3A FF" (remember, the address is backward: low byte first). 
To do it twice, for two beeps, we simply repeat the call. Thus our com- 
plete two-beep subroutine is "20 3 A FF 20 3 A FF 60" (the $60 is the 
RTS instruction mentioned above). 

Now that we have written our test program, we have to decide where 
to put it. Fortunately, the memory usage design of the Apple leaves us a 
convenient working area, over two hundred bytes long, starting at $300 
(decimal 768). We need only seven bytes of that, so we'll use $300 to 
$306 inclusive. 

The next step is loading the program. The easiest way to do that is 
through the Monitor (a sort of "general manager" program that is a per- 
manent part of the Apple); so first we need to get out of Applesoft and in- 
to the Monitor. To do that, type call-151: This will give you an asterisk 
for a prompt, instead of the familiar right square bracket of Applesoft. 

Now that you have the Monitor up, you can start to enter the test pro- 
gram. First, tell the Monitor where you want it stored— type 300, a

colon, and a space, like this: "300: " (you don't need a dollar sign here, 
even though the 300 is a hexadecimal number; the Monitor always inter- 
prets numbers as hexadecimal). Then enter the seven bytes of machine 
code, separated by spaces. Type a carriage return after the 60 and the 
program will be entered into memory. Your screen should look 
something like this (with the asterisks having been provided by the 
Monitor): 

*300: 20 3A FF 20 3A FF 60 

To be sure everything is right so far, we can test the program by run- 
ning it once. The Monitor command for goto is simply a capital G, but it 
comes after the target address, not before (as in Basic), and there should 
not be any spaces between. Type 300G and you should hear two short 
beeps from the speaker. If not, you probably made a typo somewhere: 
You will need to check your work to see what you actually entered. For- 
tunately, now that you're in the Monitor, there's an easy way to do that. 

The Monitor has a list command, which will let you look at an 
assembly language program in memory. The command is the letter L, 
and the syntax for it is similar to the G command. Type the starting ad- 
dress of the program followed by L (as before, with no spaces between) 
and then a carriage return: 300L. This will display twenty lines of 
assembly language, starting at address $300. 

The listing will be in four vertical columns. The first, leftmost col- 
umn is made up of four-digit numbers, which are the starting addresses 
of each line of code. The code itself is in the second column, with one to 
three bytes on each line. The third column is made up of assembly 
language commands (JSR, RTS, and the like), and the column on the 
right is the operand (if any): an address (one or two bytes) or a number. 
Note that all the numbers in the listing are in hexadecimal, even though 
dollar signs are given only in the fourth column. 

The program you entered should be the first three lines of the listing. 
Although twenty lines will appear on your screen, we've only shown 
five, since everything after the third is irrelevant. 

0300- 20 3A FF JSR $FF3A 
0303- 20 3A FF JSR $FF3A 



0306- 60 RTS 

0307- 00 BRK 

0308- 00 BRK 

That should show you where the error is. Of course, in this short pro- 
gram, any errors would be easy to find; in a longer program it wouldn't 
be so simple. However, the Monitor list command is still a very useful 
debugging tool. For further information on Monitor capabilities, see the 
Apple reference manual. 

In case you should want to save this program to disk, the com- 
mand is: 

BSAVE BEEPBEEP, A$300, L$7 

This command will work from the Monitor just as it does from Basic. 
When you reload it later with: 

BLOAD BEEPBEEP 

it will be put back into the same memory locations (addresses) it was 
saved from. 

Now that the test program works properly in the Monitor, let's see if 
it works from Basic. First you need to get back into Basic, which is done 
by typing control-C (press and hold the control key [CTRL on the II 
Plus], press C, then release control). This will replace the Monitor's 
asterisk prompt with the familiar square bracket of Applesoft. Now you 
must use a call statement to reach the test program, since it's in assembly 
language and the Apple is now in Basic mode. Also, you have to translate 
the starting address into decimal, since Applesoft doesn't understand 
hexadecimal inputs (just as the Monitor doesn't understand decimal in- 
puts). The command you want to type is thus call 768. This should get 
you a double beep, just as before. 

Hooking It Up to &. Now that our test program is written, entered 
into memory, and debugged, we can hang it from the & hook and see 
how that works. The way to do that, remember, is to change the address 
in the ampersand vector locations from the default address, which does 
nothing, to the address of our test routine. This can be done from Basic 
with a couple of poke commands, but we have to do a little figuring first.

The problem is that the starting address, $300 or 768, will not fit in 
one byte of memory (one byte will hold any number up to 255, but 
nothing larger). Thus we have to break the number up into two bytes, 
and the way to do that is not obvious. We start with the hexadecimal 
form of the address and add a leading zero to make it $0300. This gives 
us a two-byte address, in which the bytes are $03 and $00. 

The order of these bytes is very important— so much so that each byte 
has a different name, so we can tell which is which. The $03 byte is 
called the high byte, because it represents $03xx: in this case, $0300. 
Another term for it is the most significant byte (MSB), because in 
mathematics the significance of any digit depends on its position in the 
number: The further to the left it is, the greater its significance. The $00 
byte, which is on the right-hand side of $0300, is called the least signifi- 
cant byte (LSB), or simply the low byte, because it represents only itself, 
$00 (unlike the high byte, which represents $03 xx). 

That's the way we humans do it. The Apple does it differently, at 
least where machine code is concerned. For reasons we may explain 
some other day, the computer needs to get the low byte first, then the 
high byte; so you have to enter the bytes into memory in the following 
manner: LSB first, then MSB. In this case, that means the low byte must 
go into the first address location of the ampersand vector (that's decimal 
address 1014), and the high byte must go into the second (address 1015). 

Now that we've gone through the hassle of figuring it out, the process 
of doing it turns out to be quite simple. The low byte, $00, is zero in 
either number system, and the high byte, $03, is three, so the command 
that will set the ampersand vector to point to $300 is: 

POKE 1014, 0: POKE 1015, 3 

After you've entered that, try typing an ampersand followed by 
return. You should get that good old double beep again. That's how the 
& hook works. Needless to say, you can use this technique for other 
routines; you probably don't need a special routine just to make a double 
beep. If you use the same memory area for your routine as we did here, 
starting at $300, you can use the pokes given above to connect it; if you 
use a different area, you will have to poke the corresponding values into 
the ampersand vector locations. For example, if you load your routine 
starting at $350, the high byte value will be the same, 3, but the low byte 
will be the decimal equivalent of $50, which is 80 (5 times 16, plus 0). 
Thus the "hooking up" commands would be poke 1014, 50 for the low 
byte and poke 1015, 3 for the high byte. 

& Several Strings. Last month, we described a routine that would 
output one of several strings, but you had to specify which string by call- 
ing one of several different addresses. In other words, you had to re- 
member (or keep a list of) several different addresses and which string 
corresponded to which address. Not very convenient and prone to mis- 
takes. This time, we will use a simple selector function: &1 will print 
string number one, &2 will print number two, and so on. 

The strings will be laid out in memory after the program itself. As 
before, each string will be identified by its starting address (in this case 
technically an offset, not an address, as explained below), and the end of 
each string will be indicated by a terminating character: a carriage return 
character, ASCII 13. In this version, however, the string offsets will be 
listed in a table within the program itself, and the program (not you) will 
be responsible for finding the right starting point for each string. 

The table lookup routine uses a technique called indexed addressing. 
The microprocessor in the Apple (a large and complex integrated circuit, 
which you can think of as the brain of the system, since it tells the rest of 
the system what to do) contains two special registers, called index 
registers, which are used for indexed addressing (among other things). 
You can store a number in one of these registers and then (under certain 
conditions) have that number automatically added to the address you 
specify for a particular instruction. The number in the index register is 
sometimes called an offset, since it offsets the address in the instruction 
by that amount. 

The selector routine in our program uses this capability twice, in two 
different ways. First, when the program arrives at $300 (that is, when an 
ampersand command occurs in an Applesoft program and causes a jump 
to the address in the vector locations), the number following the amper- 
sand is put into the X register. Then we use an indexed address instruc- 
tion in which the address given is the beginning of a table of offsets— 
specifically, the address of the first item in the table (item 0). This is the 
item ttiat will be selected by the conunand &0— the item at base address

plus 0. The command &1 will select the next item in the table (base ad- 
dress plus 1), &2 will select the item after that (base address plus 2), and 
so on. 

This is only the first step. The item that is selected— the table entry at 
base plus X— is also an offset. The table contains the starting address of 
each string, expressed as a distance from the base of the table. Thus if 
there are eight entries in the table (numbered from 0 to 7), and if the 
strings are stored starting right after the table, then the starting address of 
the first string will be at base plus 8, and the first table entry will be 8. If 
the first string is five bytes long (including the terminating character), 
then the next table entry will be 8 plus 5, or 13, and so on. 

In short, the pattern is this: First, the number following the & is put 
in the X register and used as an offset to select one of the items in the 
table; then the selected item is put into the X register and used as an off- 
set (from the same base) to find the beginning of the string itself. 

The number following the &, in a call to this routine, is obviously 
very important. What would happen if you used a "bad" number— that 
is, one that is out of range: a number that does not match any of the 
strings stored in memory? The program would probably go off the rails 
and start outputting gibberish — or just hang up and not do anything. It 
would be nice if we could ensure that the input number would not be out 
of range, no matter what. 

As it turns out, it's possible to do that. There is a way to convert any 
ASCn character to a number from 0 to 7— so all we have to do is provide 
a string to correspond to each of those numbers. We carmot explain all 
the details here, because it depends on an understanding of binary 
numbers, but the principle is simple enough. It uses the assembly 
language AND command (which is different from the & command). 

The AND command performs a bitwise AND on two numbers. The 
numbers are in binary form in the computer. Each number is made up of 
eight bits (short for binary digits), and each bit is either a 1 or a 0. In a 
bitwise AND, each bit position is checked in both numbers, and if both 
positions hold a 1 bit, then a 1 bit is put into the corresponding position in 
the result. If either of the input numbers has a 0 in a given bit position, 
then the result will have a 0 in that position. 

To make a long story short, if you AND two numbers, in binary 
form, the result will be no larger than the smaller of the two input

numbers. For instance, if you AND 7 and 15, the result will be 7; in the 
same way, 3 AND 31 is 3, 5 AND 127 is 5, and so on. The important 
point, for our purposes, is that this works on ASCII values, too: Any 
ASCII value AND 7 (in binary, of course) will give a number from 
0to7. 

The Program. This month's listing is the complete program (for a 
detailed explanation of the format, see last month's column). The first 
significant lines are lines 19 and 20. These identify a couple of routines 
in the Apple Monitor, which are used by our program. Line 22 specifies 
the starting point of the program (ORG stands for origin, or begiiming): 
This is the address at which the first byte will be placed when the pro- 
gram is assembled. It is also the address that will have to be poked into 
the & vector locations to connect the program to the & hook. 

Line 24 is the first line of code, the begiiming of the program itself. 
The number at the left end of this line is 0300, the origin specified above. 
This is where we "normalize" the input— that is, reduce it to a number 
between 0 and 7 by means of the AND operation. 

In line 25, the command TAX means transfer A to X, or copy the 
number in the accumulator into the X register. When the program arrives 
here after an & command, the number following the & will be in the ac- 
cumulator (the main working register of the microprocessor chip). We 
need to put that number into the X register so it can be used as an 
offset— hence, TAX. 

Line 26 is a bit of what computer people call housekeeping: one of 
those necessary, but not obvious, details of programming that have to be 
done to keep the system happy. In effect, this lets the Apple convince 
itself that you have dealt with all the information in the line of Basic that 
included the & command; if you don't have this line in the program, you 
will get a syntax error whenever you use an & command. 

Line 27 is the first indexed-address instruction. MARK is the label 
we have used to indicate the begiiming of the table of addresses (see line 
41); this line gets the byte at MARK plus X (that is, the value placed in 
the X register by line 25), which is table entry number X, and puts it in 
the accumulator. Table entry number X, as you remember, is the offset 
from MARK to the beginning of string number X. 

The next line transfers that value to the X register, just as line 25 did, 
and now the X register holds the offset to the beginning of the desired 
string. 

Line 3 1 loads the character at MARK plus X— the first character of 
the desired string. Line 32 checks for the terminating character ("Are we 
done yet?"), and if a match is found the next line jumps to the exit line, 
38 (remember, your program must end with an RTS command — this is 
it). If no match is found, then the character is part of the string to be out- 
put; so line 34 calls the Apple Monitor routine for single-character out- 
put, COUT (short for character out, of course). 

After that's done, line 35 adds 1 to the X register (INX is short for in- 
crement X) to point to the next character in the string. Line 36 takes us 
back to line 31, to do it all again. 

Line 41, labeled MARK, is the table of offsets. Note that on the left 
side of the listing, between lines 40 and 41, there is a clump of bytes in 
hexadecimal: These are the offsets themselves translated into hex- 
adecimal (these numbers are in machine code, and machine code is 
almost always in hexadecimal notation). 

Finally, string storage begins at line 42. Once again, note the cluster 
of bytes between lines 41 and 42: These represent the ASCII codes for 
the word zero, in high-bit ASCII: normal ASCII values plus 128 (deci- 
mal) or $80 (hexadecimal). We'll go into the reason for that format some 
other time, but for now you should note the difference so you can put 
your own strings into the same format (unless you have an assembler 
program, which will probably do that for you). If you enter your strings 
in normal ASCII form (hexadecimal, of course), they will appear in 
flashing format, not normal white on black. In fact, that's partly what 
high-bit ASCII is for: to discriminate between normal display and in- 
verse or flashing display. 

By the way, your strings can be of any length (as long as the whole 
program does not exceed 208 bytes), but each string must end with a car- 
riage return (in normal, not high-bit, ASCII: decimal 13). However, if 
you use different lengths from those given here, don't forget to recalcu- 
late the starting points and put the corrected offsets in line 41 . 

And that's all there is to it. Now you can have your Apple display 
all kinds of weird (or useful) messages, even though the messages them- 
selves are not (visibly) part of the program that is miming.

Apple Computer Australia to supply low-cos 
boards for the Apple Dot Matrix Printer. The 
boards, which were designed by CED, have 
graphics capabilities not available on the boards 
supplied with the printer. CED currently mar- 
kets most of its products in New Zealand, Aus- 
tralia, and the United Kingdom but is looking 
forward to moving into the American market. 
Apples are also making a strong impact on New 
Zealand high schools. Last year, CED Distribu- 
tors scored a marketing coup when they offered 
one half-priced Apple to each high school and 
achieved an 89 percent penetration of the school 
market. Schools that had one system soon want- 
ed more, and now 35 percent of New Zealand's 
high schools have three or more Apples. Soon 
schools will be able to go on-line with New 
Zealand Beginning, a national educational 
database and bulletin board.

□ According to a survey conducted by Dun & 
Bradstreet (New York, NY), microcomputers 
now play a significant role in many small- and 
medium-size businesses. The Dun's 5,000 
Survey of American Businesses revealed that 33 
percent of all companies surveyed use micro- 
computers. Large firms with five thousand or 
more employees were predictably the most avid 
users, with more than 70 percent claiming micro- 
computer use. Of small firms with less than 
twenty employees, 14.5 percent used comput- 
ers. The survey also revealed that the primary 
computer users in small companies are the 
owners and managers, while the primary users 
in large companies are professional and tech- 
nical personnel. The use of microcomputers in 
business showed up in the survey as a recent 
phenomenon. Many respondents reported that 
their firms had only acquired a micro within the 
last few months. JB

ADVENTURE 



Schoolhouse Apple 
Feature 




by Thomas R> Mbnlitch 



The wood-paneled room is quiet, but there's a richness to the atmos- 
phere that suggests something creative, or at least absorbing, going on. 
Six people work in the room, and one computer. One of the people sits at 
the computer typing, intermittently referring to a dictionary, and typing 
some more. As soon as that one gets up, someone else uses the computer 
the same way. A couple of the people confer in quiet tones, but their 
faces are animated with excitement. 

Lining the workspace, often referred to, taken and altered, and re- 
turned, are hundreds of index cards filled with notes. Once in a while, 
one of the people exclaims about some achievement or discovery and all 
the others stop what they're doing to listen as the first one reads, their 
faces rapt and glowing as only twelve-year-old faces can be. 

The room is no publishing office or literary research lab but an or- 
dinary room in an ordinary home. The workers are a group of the neigh- 
borhood's twelve-year-olds in the process of designing, developing, and 
writing an interactive adventure story for the computer. They've already 
plotted and planned; now they're writing the actual script on Apple 
Writer. When they're finished, their script will be incorporated into an 
Apple Writer Word Processing Language program that puts pictures on- 
screen to illustrate the story and allows readers to interact. 

What provides these youngsters with the motivation to put in long 
periods of concentrated effort on a project that's so darned good for 
them? They love what they're doing. Nobody's bothered to point out that 
they're learning to use a major computer tool (a word processor) and get- 
ting plenty of typing practice, or that they're picking up some program- 
ming and developing their creativity. They think all they're doing is hav- 
ing a whole lot of fun. 

The project came about because of today's youngsters' demonstrated 
interest in computers on the one hand and in branching, or interactive, 
stories in paperback book form on the other. And because someone who 



did recognize all those useful, educational benefits knew how to program 
in WPL. 

The great appeal of these interactive adventure stories seems to lie in 
the fact that they let readers participate in choosing the direction of the 
story line. The plot of an interactive story unfolds in small segments 
called frames. Usually, the reader must make a decision — based on 
logic, intuition, or pure guesswork— at the end of each frame, and how 
he responds directs him to another page or story frame. 

A paragraph in a story fi-ame may outline possible options, give clues 
to a mystery, or provide other pertinent information. The story form 
itself demands reading for comprehension— after all, who wants to make 
a critical decision without understanding the situation fully? 

Through each frame and decision, the story flows toward a conclu- 
sion. It isn't one single story, however, but many stories diverging or 
converging at the end of each frame. Rereading a story and changing 
even one decision at some point can take the reader off on another tan- 
gent, perhaps a completely different adventure. 

But is it possible— kids typing (yes, typing!), writing, editing, and re- 
typing interactive adventure stories of their own? Of course it is. The key 
is motivation. 

Children find creating interactive stories on the computer an involv- 
ing and exciting experience. Carried along by this excitement, they learn 
to organize their thoughts, outline story frames, and create imaginative 
story plots. 

Making computers part of the experience promotes children's natural 
creativity, and it makes the writing and editing processes easier. Soon, 
they're expanding on outlined ideas and expressing themselves in 
sentences — writing, editing, and rewriting story frames. And the thought 
that peers will be reading their stories encourages youngsters to strive for 
correct grammar and spelling and clear meaning. In short, they get so

caught up in writing a story that they don't always realize how much 
they're learning. 

How It All Started. To understand how the interactive storytelling 
system works, let's begin at the beginning with the story of the six neigh- 
borhood children to whom the idea was presented. 

Once upon a time, there was no system, only the idea that it would be 
a good idea for the kids to learn to use a word processing program— the 
typing practice alone would be valuable. Perhaps there was some school- 
work they could do? 

Then the proverbial light bulb lit. Why not suggest that they write 
their own interactive adventure stories, like the ones they're always 
reading? 

The kids loved the idea. It was agreed — they would write a story out- 
line on their own, and the work on a program to display the story in 
frames to the reader would take place at the same time. 

The kids' story outline contained about seventy frames and took two 




months to complete. They wrote each story frame outline on a three-by- 
five index card with a frame number, frame title, major topics, and the 
frames to go next for each possible answer. As the outline was being 
created, the cards were taped to the wall in a treelike manner so that the 
story flow could be studied and corrected if necessary. One problem that 
had to be dealt with was the overabundance of story branches. The 
children soon learned how to recombine paths or bring them to a 
conclusion. 

When the outline was complete, the children were introduced to Ap- 
ple Writer 1.0. It wasn't long before they were using this simple word 
processor to type in their story outline in a special form devised to allow 
a separate program to display the story frames and control the story flow. 

Next, the children entered the complete seventy-frame outline into 
the computer and saved it on disk. Now they started expanding the 
thoughts and ideas they'd outlined, using Apple Writer 1.0 to replace the 
outline portions with the actual story frames. They were continually 
coached to use complete sentences and paragraphs, and to be careful to 
state the questions accurately and clearly. After an editing session or 
two, they were finished. 

Working about one hour a week, the children had devoted a total of 
five months to their sixteen-thousand-character creation. Now it was 
ready. Was the display program ready? Well, not completely. A crude 
beginning— a functional storyteller— was done, and it allowed the story 
to take its first clumsy steps to life. Even with a few bugs in the story 
flow, this was an exciting event. Actually, the story was in better shape 
than the program designed to tell it. There are many minor problems in- 
herent in making a sophisticated storyteller program that is also easy to 
use, and the first try was very clumsy. 



About this time, Apple Computer started delivering a new version of 
the Apple Writer II word processor. It turned out to have excellent 
editing capabilities. It also had WPL, otherwise known as Word Process- 
ing Language. The samples included in the documentation gave an in- 
dication of WPL's power. And so another idea began to take shape: 
Perhaps the storytelling program could be written completely in WPL. 
But was it powerful enough? 

Do tell. 

The "Tell" Program in WPL. WPL is a powerful language that's 
part of the Apple Writer II word processing software. This language al- 
lows you to automate routine editing processes. For example, you can 
use WPL to print personalized form letters with names and addresses 
from a mailing list. WPL can also be used in creating formatted repxjrts 
or in automating the writing of wills from appropriate boiler-plate 
paragraphs. 

In WPL, standard editing coimnands and special program and input 
commands are combined with decision and branching statements into 
small programs. A WPL program can perform operations on data con- 
tained in memory or can call on files stored on disk; it can then output 
such data to the screen or to a printer. In essence, a WPL program is just 
another text file containing a sequence of editing commands. A WPL text 
file is similar to an exec file in Apple DOS, but WPL also has decision 
and branching capabilities that make it an extremely useful programming 
language. 

Let's take a look at the first program portion of this storytelling sys- 
tem. The program is titled Tell. It is invoked from Apple Writer II v/i^ a 
control-P and the command DO TELL. The Tell program's function is 
merely to display a menu of stories available on a disk and allow readers 
to select a story they want to read. 

Explainii^ the Explanation. The following explanation of the Tell 
program is intended for those interested in how the WPL language 
works. If this is not your cup of tea, skip ahead to the section, "How To 
Write Stories." Complete listings of the necessary programs are provid- 
ed at the end of the article, but vital portions are also included here to 
help you understand how everything works.

The beginning statements in the Tell program are comments. The 
statement labeled MENU really starts the program. All statements start 
with the letter P, which stands for program. 

WPL automatically makes the first character of each command into a 
control character. Thus, PLM 0 in WPL is the same as typing control-P 
LM 0 in standard Apple Writer. This program command sets the left 
margin to zero. Similarly, the next five commands set various other dis- 
play parameters. 

The PND command stands for program no display: this turns off the 
display of the file in memory so we can put a menu on the screen. 

The next program command, PPR, which stands for program print, 
should be followed immediately by a control-V, a control-L, and a 
control-V. Do not type the comment as shown in the listing; instead, en- 
ter the control characters indicated. (The line had to be shown like this 
because the actual control characters cannot be directly printed.) This

PPR

PPR Here are some fine stories for you: 
PPR 

PPRSELECT TITLE PAGES 
PPR 

The next four commands form a small loop to print fifteen blank lines 
and position die output of the printed heading that follows near the bot- 
tom of the screen. The PPR command stands for program print and dis- 
plays on the screen any information that comes after it. 

NY 

LMENU 
PNP 

The NY is the standard Apple Writer control-N command to clear 
memory to make room for new data. The Y in NY is merely the "yes" 
you would normally reply to say that you do want to clear memory. 

The LMENU command loads a text file named Menu. The L stands 
for load, and Menu is the name of the file to be loaded. And the PNP, 
program new print, command finally prints to the screen the menu file 
just loaded. Here's a sample menu file: 

1 LOST IN A CORN FIELD. 15 

2 THE BIG BET. 75 

Look at the sample Menu fde. It is created using Apple Writer II and it 
contains lines showing a selection number, story title, and an ap- 
proximate number of frames. Note that for this program to function 
properly, each title must end with a period. In addition, a blank line with 
at least one space character on it must precede and follow each menu 
entry. 

PPR Which would you like to read? 
PPR 

PIN Enter your selection. =$A 

Next we input the reader's selection by number using the PIN, or 
program input, command. This puts the reader's response into one of 
the four available string variables, namely $A. 

PLS#*,$a *.*n = $d 
PGO LOAD 
PPR 

PPR I'm sorry, but I can't find that 
PPR story selection on the list. 
PIN Press return to try again. =$A 
PGO MENU 

Now we have come to the real backbone of the menu program, the 
PLS, or load string statement. This statement searches the Menu file for 
the selected line, by line number, and puts the story title from that line in- 
to another string variable, $d. Let us break down this command to see 
how it operates. 

Immediately following the command is a number sign (#) character, 
which tells the program to search memory. After that are two search 
strings surrounded by delimiters, in this case, asterisks. These search 
strings tell the program where the desired data begins and ends. 

The first search string, ",$a", searches for a carriage return, the data 
entered by the reader, and a space. Note that the asterisk is a special 
delimiter that lets us denote a carriage return with a comma. If you 
recall, the $A is the variable that holds the reader's selection. Thus, if the 
reader entered a 1 , this string would search for a return followed by a 1 
and a space, which it would find on the first menu line. 

The second search string tells the load function where to stop 
loading— that is, at the period following the story's title. The n following 
the two strings is an option that tells WPL not to load the search strings 
into the string variable, but to load only the information between the 
strings. Finally, the =$d just indicates which string variable receives 
the data. 

Finally, WPL has a special built-in error-trapping mechanism. When 
any error (such as "string not found") occurs, WPL skips over the next 
statement. In this case, if the selected number is not found during the 



load string command, the PGO {go to) command will be skipped and the 
error message following it will be printed. At that point another PGO 
command goes to the statement labeled MENU and redisplay.s the Menu. 

To summarize, this load string statement finds the line in the Menu 
file that has the same number as the one selected by the reader. Then it 
picks out the title of the selected story and puts it in the $d variable. If the 
selected line is found in the menu, we continue with the LOAD routine; 
otherwise, an error message is printed and the program is restarted. 

LOAD P 

P - LOAD THE STORY

NY 
LSD 

The load function begins with a standard Apple Writer II command, 
NY (new, yes), which clears memory. Then, the command L$D loads the 
story file, the name of which is in the $d variable, into memory. The 
name that is extracted from the menu file must be the actual story file 
name and title.

PSX 1 

PPR (Type control-V, control-L, control-V) 
PDO DISPLAY 

The final series of commands prepare for the actual storytelling. The 
cursor is moved to the beginning of the file, ".epO" is inserted to turn 
off the printing, and the numeric variable X is set to 1, which indicates 
the frame number to begin displaying. The second half of this pair, the 
Display program, is invoked with a PDO DISPLAY command. 

How To Write Stories for DO TELL. Before we discuss the display 
program, let's step back and talk about how the story itself is entered into 
the system and about how control from frame to frame is handled. To 
make story creation as easy as possible, this is done completely in Apple 
Writer II. You can teach your story writers just the minimal set of editing 
commands or the complete power of Apple Writer II, as you wish. 

The outline or story is structured into frames. A frame starts with a 
frame identifier, is followed by the text of the outline or story, and con- 
cludes with a series of control statements that determine the story flow. 

In all, there are six different control statements: frame, get, lose, 
have, question, and choose. A control statement must be on a line by 
itself and the first character must be a slash. The second character on the 
line identifies the type of control statement and must be an F, G, L, H, 
Q, or C. The frame number immediately follows this code and must be 
the same on every control statement for any one frame. This is usually 
followed by a space and whatever information the particular statement 
requires. 

Every frame must begin with a frame control statement in the format 
/Fn title. Here the n stands for the frame number (no leading zeros, 
please), and title is usually the outline heading for this frame. Follow the 
frame command or identifier with the text of the story. This text portion 
may first be entered as an outline of the frame and later replaced with the 
actual story frame. 

The next two control statements are optional, and only one of each is 
allowed in a frame. The /Gn item lets the storytelling program know that 
the reader has acquired some object {item) by traveling through this 
frame. The item may be any word you like. The control statement /Ln 
item means that the reader has given up the object, item. The G stands for 
get, the L for lose. 

The next two control statements are also optional. They describe the 
conditions under which story branching will be done. The /Hn item state- 
ment checks to see if the reader has an item in his or her possession. 
Either a Y or an N is generated accordingly. The command /Qn question 
states a short question to the reader and obtains the response. The reader 
may answer with any letter or word he wishes, but the choices that fol- 
low must state all possibilities; therefore, it's easier to ask questions that 
can be answered with a Y or an N for yes or no. 

Finally, every story frame must have at least one choice-control state- 
ment. Statements of this kind inform the storytelling program what frame 
to display next.

NOVEMBER 1983 



The command format, /Cnah g, needs some explanation. As usual, 
the n is the frame number of the current frame being read. This is fol- 
lowed by an optional answer, a, from the reader and an optional Y or N 
indication from a have check, h. Then comes the normal space, and the g 
stands for the go to frame number. You may substitute the word end for 
the go to frame number to end the story. 

This must seem cryptic at first, but after we look at a few examples it 
will become clearer. To save space, we'll display the examples in outline 
form. 

Example 1 ^ A frame without branching. 

/F1 TITLE PAGE 

LOST IN A CORN FIELD 

BY M.S. 
/C1 2 




This frame is displayed until the reader presses return. Then the com- 
puter performs the only choice-command available, which merely tells 
the program to go to frame 2 . 

Example 2. A frame with a question and branching. 

/t2 Visiting Aunt Linda 

You go to Aunt Linda's farm to play 

There may be cats in the barn 

/q2 do you want to go to the barn? 

/c2y 3 

/c2n 4 

Here the frame text is displayed, followed by the question to the reader. 
The reader is expected to type in a Y or an N. If the reader answers Y, 
then the /C2Y3 directs the story to frame 3. If the reader answers N, then 
the /C2N 4 directs the story to frame 4. You now have two complete 
story paths to bring to a conclusion. 

Example 3. Branch if reader has an object. 

/f3 Finding a cat 
You go into barn 

You hear a cat in there somewhere 
You try to coax it out 
/h3 fish 
/c3y 5 
/c3n 6 

After the frame is displayed, no question is asked of the reader. In- 
stead, the storyteller looks to see if the reader has acquired a FISH some- 



where in the reading of the story. The have command always returns a Y 
or an N for the choice command to use. So, if the reader does have a fish, 
the story continues with frame 5, in which the cat will obviously be 
coaxed out by the prospect of food. If no FISH is on hand, the cat will 
probably run away in frame 6. 

Example 4. Getting an object. 
/f4 lunch 

Aunt Linda makes lunch for you 
You help her with the dishes 
She gives you some fish for the cats 
/g4 fish 
/c4 3 

In this frame, no questions are asked, and from here the story always 
goes to frame 3. However, merely reading through this frame sets the 
/G4 FISH command in motion and adds FISH to the list of objects the 
reader has. 

That should give you a good understanding of how to create your own 
stories. Keep in mind that each frame must begin with /F and end with a 
/C control statement. Each frame may have one each of the /G, /L, /H, 
and /Q identifiers. More than one /C command will usually be used, one 
for each possible answer or combination of answers and the have com- 
mand's Y or N. 

The "Display" Program in WPL. Now back to the ranch, uh . . . 
program. The second half of DO TELL is the Display program, the 
workhorse of the system. This program follows a simple iterative proc- 
ess consisting of three major steps: displaying a frame, scanning for con- 
trol statements, and choosing the next frame. (Again, if you are not in- 
terested in the programming aspects, please skip to the section, "Stories 
To Read.")

The "display frame" routine must find the frame numbered X and 
mark it for printing. This is done with the first find command, F, which 
looks for //"followed by the frame number and inserts .epl after it. It's 
also necessary to mark the end of the frame to stop printing, as is done 
with the second find command. After clearing the screen and positioning 
just as before, the desired frame is printed to the screen by the PNP, the 
new print command. The first time through, this statement displays 
everything between the /fl and the next slash— that is, the text or outline 
of the story. Now that the frame has been displayed, the start and stop 
printing marks are removed by means of two more find statements. 

The scan routine is the most complex of the routines. It also takes the 
most time to execute. The function of the scan routine is to look for get, 
lose, have, and question controls for the current frame. When a control 
statement is found, the appropriate subroutine is invoked to handle it. 

Three variables are used in the scan section: 

$A contains the reader's answer or a null string. 

$B contains the item or question. 

$C contains Y, N, or a null string from a have check.

The scan routine begins with two PAS statements, which assign nulls 
to the string variables $A and $C. Each of the following PLS statements 
searches for a specific control code (for example, the get code, G) in the 
current frame number (X) and puts any object or question it finds into 
variable $B. 

Now for a really clever portion of WPL— what happens if a specific 
control code isn't found? The next WPL command is skipped and 
another PLS is executed. If a specific code is found, /Gl for example, 
the PSR command following it is executed. PSR stands for program sub- 
routine and is followed by the name of a small routine to be executed 
next. Each of these control statements has its own subroutines, which 
are placed near the beginning of the program in order to help speed 
execution. 

The last search in the scan routine looks up the appropriate 
choice-controller and puts the resulting next-frame number into $B.

Now, assuming that the appropriate C statement was found, the 
Choice routine checks for the word erul and returns to the menu if the 
story has ended. Otherwise, the new frame number is put into X and the 
whole display process is repeated for the new frame. 

Let's examine the subroutines used to get or lose items, check for 
have, and question the reader:

The GET routine goes to the beginning of the story file in memory 
and simply inserts the name of the item gotten, prefaced with a /H/ and 
followed by a carriage return. The LOSE routine does just the opposite. 
It searches for the item and deletes it. The find command used in both 
these routines uses the special delimiter *. The data between the first and 
second asterisks is the search string. The data between the second and 
third asterisks is the replacement string. The GET routine searches for 
nothing (which it finds immediately) and replaces it with /H/Object and a 
carriage return character.

The HAVE routine searches for an item and then leaves a Y or N in 
the $C variable indicating whether or not the item was found. The 
QUESTION routine displays the question that is in the variable $B and 
accepts the reader's response into $A. What could be easier? Each of 
these subroutines is ended with a PRT command; this stands for program 
return. PRT signals subroutine completion, and the scan routine is re- 
sumed at the statement after the PSR command. 

That's it! If you understand most of this material, consider yourself a 
Word Processing Language expert. 

Hindsight Objectives. This section was placed near the end of this 
article on purpose. Many programmers and analysts pride themselves on 




knowing exactly where they are going at all times, and some even write 
lists of goals before they start. Others, however, get in their idea canoes 
and paddle down the stream of thoughts, enjoying the sights of progress. 
The hope is always that you'll manage to bail out before going over any 
falls and that you'll have the chance to take some snapshots along the 
way. You can recount your adventures and say, "Look how far I've 
come." 

Here, then, are some hindsight objectives for the storytelling system 
DO TELL. The system was designed to do the following: 

1 . Get children involved in creative writing and give them prac- 
tice in language skills. 

2. Computerize the interactive or branched story, which allows 
the reader choice in the direction of the story line. 

3. Use a word processor program through which children can 
easily enter the outline and story themselves (and also get typing 
practice). 

4. Use simple syntax for the commands embedded in the story 
that control the plot flow. 

5. Allow the story to be entered in outline form and developed 
frame by frame into its completed form. 

6. Have easy menu selection for multiple stories on disk. 

7. Control the whole storytelling process automatically. 

Stories To Read (and Write). Now it's time to get out those three- 
by-five index cards and start plotting your own adventure story or what- 
ever else you choose. Follow the frame format and see to what limits 
your ideas flow. When you've finished making your story outline, fire 



140 



NOVEMBER 1983 



up your 48K Apple II and Apple Writer II and enter your outline with the 
appropriate identifier commands. 

Before you can actually read your story, you must add its file name 
(its title) to the menu file. Check out the story flow with the DO TELL 
system. Then go back and start replacing each outlined frame with ex- 
panded thoughts expressed in complete sentences and paragraphs. Don't 
be afraid to change or modify the story flow as new ideas come to you. 
Of course, you'll want to save your story frequently to minimize the ef- 
fects of other potential problems. Follow all of the paths of your story to 
a conclusion and make whatever corrections are necessary. 

Congratulations. You are now the author of your own interactive 
story . 

The first and largest story written for this system is called "The Big 
Bet." It was written by a group of twelve-year-olds over a period of five 
months. The story is about a Girl Scout campout that could end in disas- 




ter for the whole world, a heroine's parade, or in a number of other 
ways. The authors are Regina Frederick, Cynthia Mimlitch, Joy Moore, 
Amanda Peirano, Jennifer Turner, and Naomi Walker. 

For your reading pleasure and as an example of a small interactive 
story, a tale written by ten-year-old Michelle Schmidt with help from 
Holly Mimlitch is included in this article. The story is titled "Lost in a 
Corn Field." This story has only fifteen frames and was outlined in 
about one hour. It is a story of adventure and suspense. 

Some Problems and Solutions Identifled. A few short notes about 
the DO TELL system are called for. First, the speed of framing (going 
from one frame to another) starts to degrade as a story gets longer. A 
short story frames in about one second, but a sixteen-thousand-character 
story takes about eight seconds to frame. This results from the method of 
searching for every identifier through the whole story. Since the pro- 
grams are written completely in WPL, the system cannot be made turn- 
key for the youngest readers to use. And, finally, at present there are on- 
ly a few stories to be read with the DO TELL system. 

These problems can all be solved. First, DO TELL is great for use 
during story development; it allows the author to try out a story while 
still creating it. And a version of the program written in assembly lan- 
guage eliminates all the speed problems and also allows a complete turn- 
key system to be created. 

All in All. The DO TELL program has built-in motivation factors 
that encourage students to organize their thoughts and outline their 
stories; expand their ideas and express them in complete sentences and 
paragraphs; and to write, edit, and rewrite the story frames for correct- 
ness of grammar, spelling, and meaning. School systems might want to 
have kids in upper grades write stories for students in the lower grades to 
read. While enjoying reading the stories, the younger children would 



also be building their reading comprehension. 

This interactive storytelling method may also be used to teach other 
subjects, such as Roman history or scientific experimentation. Imagine a 
student researching and writing a fictional autobiography of Nero or 
Caesar, or perhaps writing a story on a biologist doing genetic engi- 
neering experiments. This program has a great many possible uses. Let 
your imagination loose and see if you can't find a unique one.

Lost in a Corn Field 

Written by Michelle Schmidt 

Edited by Holly Mimlitch 
and Tom Mimlitch 

Copyright 1982 

/c1 2 

/f2 Arriving at Aunt Linda's. 

Early this morning you got up, and Mom and Dad had already packed 



the car for a weekend visit to Aunt Linda's. You have always enjoyed Aunt 
Linda's farm because there are so many things to do and places to ex- 
plore. Now it is almost lunchtime as you drive up to the farmhouse. The 
large field behind the house is green with tall ripening corn stalks. Down a 
small gravel road is a large red barn and you remember finding some kit- 
tens there last year. After the hugs and hellos are over, Aunt Linda says 
that lunch will be in just a few minutes. 

/q2 Do you want to go to the barn and look for cats? 
/c2y 3 
/c2n 16 

/f3 Finding the cats. 

As you run quickly down to the barn, your mother calls out, "Don't stay 
very long." The door on the barn is hard to open and it creaks as you 
manage to squeeze in past it. Inside it is cool and only a little light shines in 
from the door. As you look around you hear a cat's meow coming from a 
dark corner. As you walk toward the sound, the cat becomes frightened 
and scampers out of the barn. 

/q3 Do you chase that cat? 
/c3y 4 
/c3n 15 

/f4 Chasing the cat. 

You run out of the barn, squeezing past the door. The bright August 
sun makes you stop and squint to see. The cat has just run into the corn 
field. Without thinking you chase after the black and white cat as it runs first 
one way and then another. Now you feel the hot sun and bugs are 
bothering you. A grasshopper jumps onto your arm but quickly hops off 
when it realizes its mistake. The cat is no longer in sight and you stop to 
rest a minute. Should you continue to look for the cat, or go back to the 
farm? You must make up your mind. 

/q4 Have you decided to go back? 
/c4y 5 
/c4n 14 

/f5 Trying to go back. 

You finally decide to turn around and go back to the farmhouse. Sud- 
denly, you are very frightened! You can't see over the corn because it is so 
tall. Which way is the house? A lump is in your throat and you fight back 
tears. Now that you have stopped running, you can hear cars on a 
highway. 

/q5 Do you follow the sound of the cars? 
/c5y 1 1

/f6 Going away from cars. 

The thought of cars on a freeway scared you more than the corn field 
so you decided to walk away from the noises of the cars. After walking a 
while, you hear the cat again. Then you see the cute furry cat and run to it. 
But again, the cat is scared and she runs too. Now you are more lost than 
ever and there are dogs barking and growling somewhere nearby. 

/q6 Do you run away?

in Running away again. 

You are really frightened by the dogs' growling and run faster and 
faster. All of a sudden you are out of the corn field near some railroad 
tracks. Uncle Bill has been waiting for you near the train tracks, and gives 
you a big hug. He takes you back to the farmhouse and everyone is happy 
that you are back and safe again. Aunt Linda gives you a popsicle and you 
are happy again also. 

The End

/f8 The dogs catch up to you. 

The dogs' barking keeps getting louder and you don't know what to 
do. Three light brown and large dogs have caught up to you. They are 
barking and snapping, trying to bite you. Are they really wolves? You see 
some sticks and also a few rocks on the ground. 

/q8 Do you use the sticks?

/f9 Mad dogs. 

You quickly grab some of the sticks on the ground and hit the dogs 
with them. This makes the dogs even madder and they leap at you all at 
once, knocking you over. You scream! You sit straight up in the back seat 
of the car as you are just pulling in to Aunt Linda's farm. You realize it was 
just a bad dream. 

The End 



/f13 Neighbor's home. 

You find another farmhouse and decide to knock on the door. A nice 
lady answers the door and you start crying and tell her you are lost. She 
knows your Aunt Linda well and calls her right away. Soon Aunt Linda is 
there and she is very happy that you are all right. A week later you tell your 
story to a neighbor and he writes it down and publishes it for you. You go 
on to become a famous author yourself. 

The End 



/c9 end 

/flO You scare the dogs away. 

Instead of the small sticks you pick up a few big rocks and throw them 
at the wild dogs. The largest dog is hit on the nose and yelps loudly. He 
runs away and the others follow him. Because of all the noise, your Uncle 
Bill finds you and takes you back to the farm. You are saved! 

The End

/f14 You find cat. 

You see the cat again and follow it slowly for a while. Maybe it will lead 
you home. But you trip on a corn stalk and that scares the cat. It runs 
away.

You are at last out of the corn field and near a road. There are no cars 
going by now. Nothing looks familiar as you look both left and right.

You went the right way and soon come to Aunt Linda's farm. Everyone 
IS very happy that you are back; they had been looking for you 
everywhere. 

The End 



You tell Uncle Bill that a cat ran away into the corn field. He says, 
"Don't worry, it can find its own way back home." You have a nice week- 
end playing on the farm and even the cat likes to play with you when you 
don't scare it. 

The End

/f16 Go to hollow log. 

You hear about a hollow log behind the barn and decide to see it. 
There happens to be a wasp nest in the log and you get stung. This hurts 
a lot and you run back to Aunt Linda's. She has something that takes the 
sting away.

Last month we did a quick and dirty fundamental analysis of the com- 
mon stock of Apple Computer. Using the Standard & Poor's report en- 
abled us to get a feel for the stock, its history, and its future. 

In this issue, we'll begin to learn about technical analysis. Why 
begin? Because if one installment of this column could teach you one- 
tenth of what you need to know to analyze stocks, Softalk's cover price 
might change from $3 to $300. But we all need to start somewhere, and 
this seems as good a place as any. 

Technical analysis is the science, black art, or cult (depending on 
your orientation) of forecasting future stock prices based on historical in- 
formation. The difference between fundamental analysis and technical 
analysis is similar to the difference between matter and antimatter. And 
the end result of combining the two is probably the same: kaboom! 

As we saw last month, fundamentalists look at a company's strengths 
and weaknesses. They also examine its past prices, ftiture outlooks, 
earnings, dividends, and so on. Technicians, by contrast, take this infor- 
mation, along with such other indicators as volume, and run it through 
sophisticated mathematical formulas to forecast future stock prices or 
movements. 

In this issue, we'll learn to read and use some of the technical indica- 
tors available in Barron 's Market Laboratory. Other sources of technical 
data are the MicroQuote database on CompuServe and, to a lesser de- 
gree, the Dow Jones News/Retrieval Service. 

Figure 1 shows the Dow Jones industrial average, the best-known 
stock index in the world. There are three other Dow Jones indexes: the 
transportations (commonly called "transports"), the utilities, and a 
sixty-five-stock average that combines the industrials, transportations, 
and utilities. 

Technicians use the Dow Jones averages as a benchmark by which to 
measure the performance of other indicators or securities. These aver- 
ages can be used straight, as they appear in the Market Laboratory, or 
they can be analyzed using moving averages, oscillators, or a host of 
other techniques. We'll cover these techniques in detail in later install- 
ments; the daily and weekly data contained in Market Laboratory is more 
than enough to concern ourselves with at this point. So for now, here's a 
good market rule of thumb to remember: The higher the Dow averages 
go, the better. 

The Dow Jones industrial average has been maintained since 1897. 
At the beginning, it took twelve large industrial corporations into ac- 
count. In 1916, the average was expanded to cover twenty stocks, and in 
1928 it reached its present size of thirty industrials. 

Back in 1897 the industrial average was computed by adding up the

prices of the twelve stock issues contained in it and then dividing by 12; 
in 1920 the divisor was 20, and in 1928 it was 30. Because of stock 
splits, replacements, additions, and deletions among the thirty over the 
years, the divisor is no longer simply 30. The current divisor is always 
shown in the text under each average. The majority of investors won't 
need to work with this divisor, but it is important to understand what it is 
and what can happen to the various averages when it changes. If the 
overall market is steady, and a stock in the average splits, the divisor will 
change, and that could change the overall average. 

Figure 2 shows the Market Laboratory chart that gives the hourly 
averages for the Dow. Many technicians use these figures to get a short- 
term picture of the market. This level of detail lets us see what impact 
outside events may have had on the market during the week. We can also 
use it to identify patterns in the market; for example, a strong market 
close usually means that investors can expect a strong open the next trad- 
ing day. 

The number 20 before transportation and the number 15 before util- 
ities tell us how many stocks those indexes encompass. Often, the indus- 
trial average is referred to as the "30 industrials," and the transporta- 
tions and utilities are also often referred to with their respective num- 
bers. The major value that the transportation and utilities indexes hold 
for a technician is that they can be used as guides to their respective in- 
dustries. The utilities index is sometimes also used by technicians as a 
proxy for investors' feelings about interest rates. Utilities are high- 
dividend-paying, bond-issuing concerns, and this structure makes them 
very susceptible to interest-rate fluctuations. When rates go up, the 
prices of utilities go down; the reverse is also true. 

Figure 3 shows the Dow Jones 20 bond average. This average is fig- 
ured on ten utility bonds and ten industrial bonds. The bond average 
gives you an easy way to monitor the performance of the bond market, 
which is often a leading indicator of how the stock market will perform. 
If the 30 industrials are rising and the bond average is falling, it's usually 
a signal of trouble ahead in the stock market. If the 15 utilities, which we 
know already are interest-sensitive, are also falling, run for cover! If, on 
the other hand, bonds and utilities are firm but the industrials are not 
performing, this usually indicates that the market is near, or at, a bottom 
point. 

(By now you're probably starting to realize that forecasting the mar- 
ket is (a) not easy, (b) complicated, (c) an activity in which the Apple can 
really help a lot, or (d) all of the above. The answer, of course, is (d).) 

Figure 4 shows the Dow Jones Price-Earnings Ratio. Last month we 
described the concept of price-earnings ratio in detail. However, the fig- 
ure known as the Dow Jones price-earnings ratio is not the P-E for Dow 
Jones but for the Dow Jones averages. This ratio is calculated by adding 
up the earnings of all the stocks in an average, dividing by the number of 
stocks, and then dividing the result into the average itself. 

This indicator is normally used to test whether a stock is under- or 
overpriced according to the current state of the market. For example, if 
the industrials' P-E is 12.5, and Apple's is 20, then an analyst wUl say 
that according to the market Apple is overpriced. Overpriced P-Es indi- 
cate that the market feels a stock has good growth potential or is very 
low-risk. Underpriced P-Es usually mean either that a company is in a 
mature industry or that there's something the matter with it. The Dow 



Jones stock P-E is a good indicator against which to test a security before 
you buy. 

All the market performance indicators we've looked at so far are 
price-based. But price is only one aspect of the information needed to 
solve the technical equation. The next area we'll consider is volume; to 
many technicians, volume is the most important information to have and 
evaluate. 

Figure 5 shows New York Stock Exchange odd-lot trading. Odd-lot 
units are units that have been traded in batches of fewer than 100 shares. 

Odd lots are normally traded by the smaller-time, more conservative 
investors. Historically, these "odd-lotters" have been right about the 
future of the market more often than they've been wrong. In fact, com- 
pared to those of the large institutional traders, the records of these in- 
vestors are enviable. As prices fall, odd-lotters normally tend to buy 
more and sell less, so near the bottom of the price range they are net buy- 
ers (they're buying more than they sell); if these folks increase their buy- 
ing and also decrease their selling, be careful! They're saying that they 
think the market might fall. To analyze odd-lot activity, you can con- 
struct a ratio of odd-lot purchases to sales and watch it over time. 

Another key indicator of investor smarts (or the lack of them) is short 
selling. Selling short consists of contracting for the sale of a stock you 
don't own in the hope that the price of the stock will go down. If it does, 
you'll be able to go into the market and buy the stock at a lower price 
than the contracted price. (This form of investing, by the way, is for 
those of you who speculate, sky-dive, or have a death wish.) 

The short-sales indicator lets us know what the small, highly specula- 
tive investor is thinking. Statistically speaking, short sellers are con- 
tra-right—they do exactly the wrong thing. So if you want to make 
money, consider doing exactly the opposite of what short sellers do. 

Stock exchange volume trends (see figure 6) are another important 
group of statistics for the technician. Up volume equals the aggregate da- 
ta volume of buying and selling for all issues that rose in price on the 
New York Stock Exchange. Conversely, down volume equals the aggre- 
gate total for all stocks that fell in price. The chart does not show un- 
changed volume. 

By analyzing this data we can see, technically speaking, whether the 
market is overbought or undersold. If the up-down volume has increased 
dramatically over a short time period, a technician will read this as a sig- 
nal that the market is overbought. Overbought means that it's time to

sell, before the market turns down. When the ratio goes to the opposite 
end of the spectrum (very low), it's an indicator that the market is over- 
sold. In a bull (or rising) market, this is the time to buy. But in a bear (or 
falling) market, an oversold condition can be considered part of life it- 
self. It is the market's manifestation of a common human malady: 
depression. 

QCHA is computed by QUOTRON, the people who supply the mod- 
em-day equivalent of ticker tape machines to the financial services indus- 
try. This calculation gives the average percentage movement for all New 
York Exchange listed stocks each day, and it is used by technicians to 
track deviations, or differences, between percentage changes on the 
NYSE and other indexes, such as the Dow 30 industrials. (If, for exam- 
ple, the QCHA is .24, it means that the average stock on the NYSE rose 
.24 percent.) Such analysis can reveal weaknesses or strengths in the 
market. If the QCHA index is running stronger than the Dow, it may sig- 
nal rising stock prices ahead; if the Dow is running ahead of the QCHA, 
the technical interpretation is that the market will probably fall. 

The key thing to remember about the QCHA is that it measures the 
price changes for all issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Many of the stocks listed on the NYSE are small and volatile compared 
to the stocks used for the Dow Jones 30 industrials, so the QCHA moves 
more, and faster, than the Dow. If you're not careful, you may be easily 
misled by it.

The next section of Barron 's Market Laboratory we'll look at con- 
tains the weekly market statistics. Weekly statistics are put to very heavy 
use by technical analysts. When a technician builds charts that use 
months or even years of data, including daily information can make a 
chart difficult to read. The same patterns can be seen, and more informa- 
tion can be included, by using weekly information instead. Trends that 
develop over time can still be easily isolated and analyzed. 

The week's market statistics (illustrated in figure 7) show the current 
week's information, the previous week's data, and the numbers for a year 
ago. Volume information is given for the New York, American and 
over-the counter exchanges, and for the Dow Jones groups. Many tech- 
nicians use this information in interpreting buyers' preferences — and 
thus the condition and future of the market. If trading on AMEX is ad- 
vancing on a percentage basis over the NYSE, a technician will probably 
interpret that to mean increased speculation in "lower grade" issues. 
This, in turn, can be interpreted as a signal that a market high has been 
reached and that an overall downturn in the market is just ahead. 

The twenty most active stocks (see figure 8) act as indicators of inves- 
tor preference. Taking composition of the group into account can give

you incisive insights into the current "mind set" of the market. 

The index for the twenty low-priced stocks is a very good speculative 
indicator: The higher the activity in these stocks, the more bearish the 
market (speculators go against these indicators and try to beat the mar- 
ket). The lower the index, the more bullish the market. 

Member trading information is used extensively by the various mar- 
ket newsletter writers to analyze the preferences of the market special- 
ists, or traders, who by general proclamation are considered "experts." 
We'll leave the analysis of this section to the newsletter writers; personal 
experience has been known to suggest, however, that this is the least ef- 
fective indicator of future market performance. 

Adding together the daily odd-lot figures for the week gives you the 
weekly odd-lot total, right? Wrong. Many brokerage houses handle odd- 
lot transactions off the exchange floor. These trades are not counted in 



the daily totals, but they are included in Market Laboratory. Even though 
these trades may not represent a large percentage of market volume, 
they're important, and your daily analysis should be adjusted to reflect 
them. 

The bond offering and stock offering numbers show the total dollar 
amount of new issues, or offerings, during the previous week. By ana- 
lyzing these numbers, we can see whether pressure is being placed either 
on interest rates or on market liquidity. For example, a rapid increase in 
bond volume will probably force interest rates up (issuers will have to 
pay more to attract funds), and this will in turn force stock prices down. 
(The higher interest rates go, the lower stock prices go. This relationship 
is demonstrated in the Gordon model, an explanation of which can be 
found in any basic finance text.) Another good example: If the dollar vol- 
ume of stock offerings drops below average, it may signal a market 
high— underwriters may be holding issues back because they feel that the 
market won't respond to a new offering. 

Getting Specific. Well, that's enough for this month. Now that 
we've talked about technical analysis, why don't we look at a technical 
analysis package. The Market Technician from Datamost. 
The Market Technician, by Steven King, Datamost (8943 Fullbright 
Avenue, Chatsworth, CA 91311; 213-709-1202). $195. 
Backup policy: copyable. 

System requirements: Apple II, n Plus, or lie; Applesoft; one disk drive. 
Optional (and recommended): second disk drive, printer with graphics, 
D.C. Hayes Micromodem or Apple-Cat. 

Market Technician is Datamost's first investment program. Like any 
first try, it has some weak spots and problems, but the program does pro- 
vide the technical investor with some interesting tools. Let's take a look. 

Market Technician comes with its own database so the technician can 
get started right away. This database contains daily stock market data 
from January 1979 to the present. (It's safe to assume that "the present" 
is approximately the day the disks were duplicated by Datamost.) The in- 
formation contained in the database provides most, if not all, of the ag- 
gregate market statistics you'd want to have in order to get started. In- 
cluded on the database are the Dow Jones industrial, transportation, and 
utility averages, the Standard & Poor's 500 average, the number of com- 
posite New York Stock Exchange issues advancing and declining, the 
New York Stock Exchange volume, the number of shares traded on the 
NYSE on an uptick (called advancing shares), the number of new highs 
on the NYSE, and the number of new lows on the NYSE. Without a 
doubt, a very complete statistical base. 

From these statistics, the program automatically constructs two other 
measures of market activity. The first is called an advance-decline line. 
This line displays the net cumulative advances and declines for each trad- 
ing day, beginning on January 2, 1979. The second measure constructed 
is the net cumulative volume, which begins on January 1, 1979. 

When you buy a technical analysis program, you have the right to ex- 
pect that historical market information will be included. Datamost and 
the author showed foresight and understanding when they included this 
database in Market Technician. As we've already learned, technical 
analysis involves analyzing a great deal of data that has been collected 
over time. And while neither the publisher nor the author could possibly 
guess what stocks an investor who buys their program will be tracking, 
they can easily and accurately guess what aggregate market statistics pro- 
gram purchasers will be using in their analyses. 

Market Technician is menu -driven. The menus themselves are easy to 
use but visually distracting and thus unprofessional. The program uses 
the left and right arrow keys to move a flashing inverse bar over the 
menu choices. In many menus, the left and right arrow keys can be used 
to move the cursor bar up and down. In other menus, however, only the 
right arrow works; this inconsistency should have been taken care of. 

Menu-screen choices are numbered, which adds to the confiision; if a 
cursor bar is used, numbers are unnecessary. To select a menu item, you 
position the bar over it and press return. The blinking cursor tires the 
eyes and is, quite frankly, very annoying. A plain inverse bar would 
have been a better choice. 

The program contains six major modules. The first module is the data 
entry section, which is used to input raw stock market data into the 
Market Technician database. Information must be entered into the pro- 
gram sequentially by date. Market Technician does some very rudimen- 
tary error-checking on date entries— for example, it won't accept a 
month number greater than 12 or a date greater than 3 1— but once you've

To err is human. 
To forgive is SAVVY. 

With SA\A/Y " you can misspell, mistype or rephrase and still command your computer. 

If youVe tired of inflexible personal software, its time to get SAVVY. 

SAVVY teaches your computer to adapt to you. Its part hardware, part software, and part 
remarkable. It lets your computer see things as you see them. Do things the way you like to do them. 
It even allows for those unavoidable entry errors that we all sometimes make. 

What's the secret.^ SAVVY can recognize patterns (other software prodticts can only recognize 
exact duplicates) and you can teach it to recognize your language. That means it will carry out your 
commands instead of flashing "error" messages. 

Whether you want SAVVY to teach yourself programming, to run your business applications or to 
develop drills for students, there's a version of SAVVY to suit your needs and 
your budget. It's a database system, file manager, natural language programmer, 
and ah operating system, all in one. SAVVY operates on Apple II Plus* and He* 
computers as well as Apple-compatibles. 

Call 800-551-5199 to arrange for a demonstration at your local dealer.

entered the date, the error-checking stops. 

As you input information, the program automatically increments the 
date counter for you. This is a nice feature, because it means you don't 
have to enter the date each time. The problem is that the program doesn't 
know when to stop. At the end of a month's worth of data you must enter 
the starting date of the new month. Otherwise, if you're entering a long 
list of data that spans a long time period, you'll likely run past the end of 
the month and not realize it until it's too late and you have a date like No- 
vember 31 or February 30 muddling up your records. 

The data entry module features a useful status counter that tells the in- 
vestor how many days of information are on file and gives an estimate of 
how many more can fit in the database. Market Technician can hold ap- 
proximately 1,265 days' worth of data in its database. 

Updates to the Market Technician database must be done by hand. 
Most of the information required is not available from the electronic 
services, but it can be gathered from Barron's or from the financial 
pages of any major newspaper. 

The second module is the data compiler. If you're a computer techni- 
cian, you probably know what a compiler is, but if you're reading this 
because you're a market technician, you may have just gotten lost. The 
compiler in Market Technician is used to transform the database files that 
come with the program into a form that its other modules can use. It's 
hard to understand why this is not handled automatically. Setting things 
up that way might make the program run a bit more slowly, but it would 
eliminate the confusion this module introduces. 

The data compiler can be used to create a data file that has composite, 
or analyzed, information in it. A user-defined option allows the investor 
to perform mathematical operations on as many as five data files in a 
row. You can then save the resulting information to disk under file 
names you supply. This feature is useful in creating benchmarks or in- 
dexes to use in your analysis. 

Some major problems in the program first surface in this module. To 
begin with, the program dictates where your data files are to be stored 
and retrieved. First, for this and many of the other forms of analysis, the 
data files have to be on the disk in drive 1 . Most of the time you can't ac- 
cess programs stored on drive 2. The question, then, becomes what's the 



FINALLY...

use of having two drives? In addition, although the data compiler docu- 
mentation says that it's only necessary to compile the information stored 
in the Market Technician database and that stock information we load in 
ourselves doesn't have to be compiled, this doesn't seem to be the case. 
In reviewing this program, we could not manage to make use of the in- 
formation we had entered ourselves. An attempt to compile it produced 
no better results; it would not compile. To quote classic data processing 
terminology, there's a bug here, one that should have been caught before 
the program was released. 

Balance volume analysis and price volume analysis are the other 
forms of analysis available from the data compiler module. Balance 
volume is figured by adding the current day's volume of a stock or 
average to that of the previous day (or subtracting it, depending upon the 
closing price of the stock). If the price has increased, the volume will be 
subtracted; and if the price has remained unchanged, the file will be un- 
changed. As many of you probably recognize, this balance calculation is 
similar to the OBV (on balance volume) calculation made famous by Joe 
Granville. 

Price volume analysis resembles the balance volume analysis, except 
that it is related to the change in the current day's volume, which is in 
turn related to the percentage change in the current day's price. The cal- 
culation goes something like this: ". . . for each percentage point 
change in price, a similar multiple of the daily volume is added to or sub- 
tracted from the previous day's cumulative adjusted volume." The end 
result is an index that's acutely sensitive to coupled price/volume 
changes. 

The third menu option is the graphics section. Graphing is the heart 
of any technical analysis program, and thus the most important. But for 
some reason Market Technician assumes that all you want to graph is in- 
formation from the database that came with the program, not the stock 
information you've entered in. And, in fact, though the graphic analysis 
of the program's database went without a hitch, we could not get Market 
Technician to graph the Dow Jones stock price data we'd retrieved. This 
means one of two things: Either the documentation is wrong, or the pro- 
gram is. It really doesn't matter; Market Technician did not perform. 

As just mentioned. Market Technician's graphics module can chart 
the database that comes with the program. The graphics module is not 
hard to work with, and using it can give you some valuable information. 
Once you've selected the data you want to graph, the Market Technician 
retrieves it from disk and plots the graph. After the graph has been 
displayed, a command bar appears at the bottom of the screen. It is 
through this command bar that any additional analysis on the chart is per- 
formed. From here, you can overlay another data set over the existing 
chart for a comparison, find a particular date on the graph and display the 
value of the data on that day and the change from the previous day, draw 
a least-squares trend line on-screen, overlay a logarithmic chart of the 
active data file on-screen, print out the data that's displayed on-screen on 
a printer, and save the graphic representation to disk (or send it to a 
graphic printer or interface). 

One note: The date feature can be used only on daily files. Remember, 
these features are useful for analyzing the thirteen indexes that come with 
Market Technician, but they don't seem to work with user-supplied data. 
The same holds true for the other available forms of analysis: moving 
average, relative strength, and momentum. Let's consider each one 
briefly. 

The moving average function lets you graph one or two moving 
averages on the same plot. You may choose a front- weighted moving 
average, a back-weighted one, or a simple moving average. In a front- 
weighted moving average, more emphasis is given to the most recent 
data points; in a back- weighted moving average, more weight is given to 
the oldest data; and in a simple moving average, all points are weighted 
the same. For any of the three analyses, you can choose a moving 
average value between 1 and 119. By choosing a value of 1, you can get 
the program to plot the actual data without adjustment. Why do this? So 
you can plot actual data against an average on the same screen. 

Relative strength charts show the relationship between two specified 
indexes. The plotted data is the result of dividing one security or index 
into the other. Many technicians refer to this technique as ratio analysis. 

Market Technician can analyze and chart momentum studies for 
periods of from one to one-hundred-twenty days. Momentum studies 
show the percentage change of an index from one point in time to 
another. For example, if Apple stock is trading at $30 today and was at

NOVEMBER 1983 



$27 yesterday, a two-day momentum study would tell us that the stock is 
((30/27) - 1)*1 1 % higher today. Specifying a value of one day here gives 
you actual unadjusted data against which to plot other data. 

One very good feature: Market Technician automatically asks you if 
you want to smooth your momentum values with a five-day moving 
average. Momentum studies sometimes look like paint thrown on the 
wall — a moving average transformation makes them easier to analyze. 
But here's the really upsetting part: The fact that the author has included 
this feature shows that he has a real understanding of the technique. And 
yet, parts of the program appear to have been randomly thrown together. 
It's obvious that a great deal of effort went into creating this program, 
and it can be cleaned up, but unfortunately the current version of Market 
Technician does not meet commercial standards. In any event, let's 
finish our look at it and hope that the comments made here are taken to 
heart. 

The edit/search module is next. Edits of stock file data are done 
through this section and additional analysis can also be performed in it. 
Putting all of the analysis sections in one place would have made the pro- 
gram easier to work with. 

The analysis done in this module is a statistical correlation. A correla- 
tion study shows the investor if there is a significant statistical relation- 
ship between two securities, indexes, or a combination thereof. With the 
correlation, the program also calculates the standard error of the estimate 
and allows you to predict the value of one data set based on the value of 
the other. (Again, this form of analysis requires that the data files be on 
drive 1. Why? This setup is cumbersome, time-consuming, and dumb.) 
By the way, correlation analysis is deeply rooted in statistical theory. If 
you don't understand how it works, getting a basic statistics text and 
studying up would be a good idea. 

The search function is a unique and interesting feature, but unfor- 
tunately it works only on the program database, not on your stock files. 
(Again, why?) The search feature lets you scan the database to find the 
number of occurrences of a given event. For example, let's assume that 
we wanted to find out on what days the average of the Dow Jones 30 in- 
dustrials was between 980 and 1,020. We'd instruct Market Technician 
to search its database for all Dow Jones 30 industrial averages of 1,(X)0, 
plus or minus 20. After telling us approximately how long the search 
would take, the software would go to work. 

When the search was complete. Market Technician would give us the 
dates and values for all days that fit within the search parameters. We 
could then view each day, with all its accompanying information, on- 
screen, or we could print the information out. What a great feature this 
would be if it worked on our own files. It could help us to identify pat- 
terns, to relate nonmarket events to market activity, or whatever. In its 
present form, though, it reaches only 50 percent of its potential. 

The last module contains all the edit utilities needed to run Market 
Technician. Up to forty stocks, with 120 days of information, can be 
stored on disk. In essence, then, each disk is a portfolio. When you reach 
the program's 120-day limit, the oldest data drops off first during the up- 
date; thus, you're limited to 120-day studies of stock information. 

Market Technician can use either the Dow Jones News/Retrieval 
Service or a manual update to bring the stock and volume prices in your 
portfolio up to date. Updates are classified as historic or daily. One 
potential problem is that the program allows you to use Tymnet to log on 
to Dow Jones but not Telenet; perhaps you prefer Telenet. Another prob- 
blem is that the program has no form of data error-checking— if it 
receives garbage, it leaves it to you to stop the transmission and start 
again. This is not the ideal arrangement; you may not feel that sitting and 
staring at the screen while the program updates your files is the most pro- 
ductive use of your time. 

This module also offers an automatic stock-split feature. The investor 
is prompted to supply the split information, such as 3 for 2, and the pro- 
gram then automatically goes through the stock file and adjusts the past 
prices. 

The Summing Up. Datamost has rapidly gained a reputation in the 
industry for publishing quality entertainment software, but it would 
seem that the company has a long way to go with investment applica- 
tions. The best approach to this situation would be to recall the product, 
correct the errors, inconsistencies, and problems, and then rerelease it. 
As should be clear from this review. Market Technician has the founda- 
tions of a solid, useful investment tool. In its present form, however, its 
value is very limited.

Apple's new 
Monitor IL 
A sight for 
sore eyes. 

If you've been using a TV as 
a monitor, perhaps you can get 
a friend to read this for you: 

Apple's brand new Monitor 
II will improve your vision. 

It features all the latest 
ergonomic improvements in 
monitor technology. 

For example: 

Studies have shown that 
the leading cause of eye fatigue 
for computer users is lack of 
contrast between the displayed 
characters and their background. 

So we designed the Monitor 
II around a high contrast green 
phosphor CRT that provides an 
extremely dark background. 
That means you can read text 
at a lower brightness. And 
that means you can be more 
productive — working longer 
and more comfortably. 

Toward that same end, we 
also gave Monitor II a tilt screen. 
So you can angle it perfectly for 
your working position, without 
scooting your chair around or 
sitting on phone books. 

And we made that screen 
antireflective to reduce glare 
from ambient light. 

Monitor II also features 
a high bandwidth video 
amplifier and a high tolerance 
linearity circuit. The former 
keeps characters from smearing 



on the screen and eliminates the 
annoying "ghosts" left by a fast 
moving cursor. The latter keeps 
characters crisp, legible and 
prevents "keystoning" right up 
to the edges of the display. Both 
add up to superior display of 
80'column text and extremely 



accurate graphics. 

Designed as the perfect 
system partner for the Apple He 
Personal Computer, Monitor II 
requires no monitor stand. It's a 
perfect fit, aesthetically as well 
as technically. So it's pleasing to 
the eye even when it's turned 
off. See for yourself. 

At your local authorized 
Apple dealer.

Now Apple 
plots color. 

Since color graphics are 
becoming ever more important 
in business, we've been hearing 
more and more calls for a color 
plotter as reliable as an Apple. 

Here it is: 

Apple's new Color Plotter 
can generate all kinds of presen- 
tation graphics, engineering 
drawings or anything else you 
have to illustrate in up to eight 
brilliant colors. 

And it can perform its art on 
any size paper up to 11" x 17" 
Or, with optional transparency 
pens, it can draw right on 
transparent film for overhead 
projection. 

Measuring just 4.8"H x 16"W 
X 12"D, it's the smallest four- 
color, wide bed color plotter you 
can buy — about half the size 
of conventional flatbed 
blotters. So it takes up 
space on your 
md can easily be

rity circuit. 




ICHIBAN MA 




moved to someone else's desk. 

There are two color plotter 
accessory kits to choose from 
to assure a perfect marriage with 
your Apple II or He, or Apple III. 

Each kit comes with eight 
color pens — red, blue, green, 
black, burnt orange, gold, violet 
and brown. Plus a starter 
package of plotter paper. Plus 
all the manuals, documentation 
and cables appropriate to 



your particular kind of Apple. 
So you can get up and coloring 
right away. 

Apple also offers a complete 
selection of 24 different pen 
packages — so you can choose 
whatever colors you need in a 
variety of widths for a variety of 
applications and media types. 

As you might expect, all of 
the above is available at many 
of our authorized Apple dealers.

She decides to go to bed and 
quickly enters mto a deep sleep 
that plunges her into the Digital 
Dimension. She finds herself on 
the ground gazing at eight 
towering electronic circuit 
poles, each emitting an orange 
glow that consumes the entire 
sky. Fascinated and perplexed 
by the sudden change in 








environments, Cybil notices an 
animated object, high in the 
heavens, swinging from pole to 
pole. 

Cybil (whispering to herself): 
The lightning speed, the 
energetic response, the total 
commitment, it must be Willy 
Byte! 

(At that moment the game's 
charismatic electronic hero, 
Willy, sees Cybil and slides 
gracefully down the pole to 
meet his newest acquaintance.)

Greetings, Cybil! Welcome to the 
Digital Dimension. 
Cybil The Digital what? 
Willy: You know my home, the 
inside of your computer Watch 
this! 



(Off he scampers about the 
keyboard room, pulling and 
tugging on each bit while 
dodging the stinging sensation 
of static charges As soon as 
Willy completes his task and the 
byte has safely left the keyboard 
room, a pale expression comes 
over Willy's face.) 
Cybil Are you alright? 
Willy Byte (concerned): 
Problems in the 
Power Room, 
Cybil (confused): 
What problems? 
Willy Byte (assertive) 
Follow me!

laugh is heard from above - the 
la ughter of Hex Luthor Suddenly 
a bolt of static charge is seen 
thundering its way toward Willy 
Byte.) 

Cybil Watch out, Willy! 
( Cybil awakens from her dream 
to find her brother Sidney 
standing in her doorway.) 
Sidney (concerned): Cybil, are 
you alright?

kitchen I noticed that the 
computer was left on, The 
screen's got a picture of a new 
game on it,

find the 
disk.

Willy Byte m the Digital 
Dimension, Mom and Dad

emotion): Dad says that when 1

of stuff about computers.

Cybil: First you jump into the 
CPU room. And then there are 
lots of other game rooms to 



explore, and each is a part of the 
computer

way. It is Friday afternoon— the end of the shift.

NOVEMBER 1983 



« ^^^11 f f t;Ti tf tt tifiil 





Some of New Bedford's finest (from left to right): Detective Sergeant John Dextradeur, Detective Lieutenant Carl Moniz, Detective Kenneth Gormley, and 
Detective Sergeant Gilbert Larson. These men, along with an Apple lie and PFS:File, are creating a computerized crime information tracking system that 
is easy for them to use, low in cost, and, most important, effective. 



the bare metal edges glow in the late-aftemoon light. 

The Detective Division is in a comfortable room. A large desk stands 
like a sentry near the door. Its bulk doesn't actually block access to the 
room, but its commanding presence makes it difficult not to stop there. 

"Lieutenant Moniz? . . . Take a chair. He'll be here in a minute." 

Green, brown, and gray metal desks, obviously purchased at dif- 
ferent times, fill the room. Most of them are covered with papers and 
personal effects — pictures of wives and kids, a small American flag. The 
typewriters, too, are of mixed vintage, a few Royals, an Olympia, an 
Olivetti — all manual. The room might have served as a set for the 1930s 
shooting of The Front Page. 

This is not Tomorrowland. It is not some public relations man's 
dream of twenty-first-century law enforcement. It is a working detective 
division, in a working police station, in a working city of one hundred 
thousand persons. This is a scene that is undoubtedly repeated all over 
the country in hundreds of small cities. In short, it is ordinary. 

But it is also extraordinary. For in a small office at the end of the 
room, a CRT screen glows a familiar Apple green. A program thousands 
of Apple users throughout the country are familiar with is up and 
rurming — PFS.File. 

They're not using this software to keep a mailing list for the 
Policemen's Ball, however. They've made the Apple He a member of the 
team, working break-ins, robbery, fraud, and, yes, even homicide. And 
with less than two months' time on the force, the Apple already has its 
first "collars," a couple of persons police believe were responsible for a 
burglary in a housing complex for the elderly and a break-in at a handbag 
company. Not bad police work for a rookie! 

"Hey, we haven't pinned a badge on it yet," jokes Detective Lieu- 
tenant Carl Moniz. His tone becomes more serious: "It's only a tool, 
you know. You still need the guy on the street." He could have added 
that you also need the guy smart enough to take advantage of the tool— 
and that's Moniz. 

An unassuming veteran of fifteen years on the New Bedford force, 
Lieutenant Moniz should not be confused with television's Lieutenant 
Columbo. He doesn't smoke cigars, he's not coy, and the case load in his 
division doesn't consist of an intriguing series of crimes among society 
high-steppers. This is New Bedford. This is Every City, USA, where the 
detective caseload is largely burglaries, frustrating invasions of houses 



when no one was home, no one saw anything, and no one was even sure 
when the crime occurred— maybe last night, maybe the night before. 

The uniformed men on patrol make the first report. A pink copy 
comes to the detective division. It's a page, rarely two, of raw data — 
addresses, dates, owners' names, a few notes. The report gets a case 
number and is added to a detective's stack to be reviewed. The detective 
goes over some of the same ground. Maybe he gets a chance to talk to a 
neighbor who wasn't available when the uniformed officer was investi- 
gating. Maybe he shakes loose another fact or two. In any event, another 
report is generated. A few more details. No, no one saw anything un- 
usual. No, no one heard anything extraordinary. When did it happen? 
Well, Sergeant, we were away all weekend. A shrug . . . frustration. 
The rejrort goes into the file. 

Hopefully some of the details stick in the detective's memory. Most 
get forced out by fresher details from more recent breaks. The television 
detective may have a photographic memory, but these aren't television 
detectives. They play with their kids on days off, worry about how to pay 
bills, take the family dog to the vet, and come in the next day to face 
more cases. 

Last winter they decided to try a new tactic, explains Lieutenant 
Moniz. A map of the city dominates one wall of his office. In it he places 
pins. They represent two months' worth of crimes— mostly burglaries of 
houses and commercial establishments. It's a quick and simple vis- 
ual aid. 

In July, shordy after the Apple arrived on the scene, a concentration 
of pins began to appear in a single South End neighborhood of tenements 
and small businesses. The pins were mostly white, indicating house- 
breaks, but a few were black, representing burglaries at commercial 
buildings. The geographical pattern was obvious. But were there other 
patterns? 

When Lieutenant Moniz had asked a similar question a couple of 
months before, it had taken Detective Sergeant John Dextradeur about 
two weeks to wade through all the reports by hand, looking for mean- 
ingful patterns. Granted, explains Lieutenant Moniz, Sergeant Dextra- 
deur did other work during those weeks, but it still was a lot of effort. 

However, this time they had been entering the information in the Ap- 
ple. It wasn't hard to design a form. What shows on the PFS.File screen 
looks remarkably like the file card system they had used in the past.

IF YOU'RE CONFUSED 

ABOUT BUYING A 
PERSONAL COMPUTER, 

rSSOMEHELR 




Computers come in two parts. 

One part is the "hardware!' the 
machinery itself. The other is the 
"software!' which tells a computer 
what to do, the way a driver tells a 
car what to do. 

Without software, a computer 
can't do anything. And vice versa. 
You have to buy both. 
Buy the software first 

Since the reason you're buying a 
computer is to get the capability 
the software gives you (remember 
it's the software that tells the com- 
puter what to do) , it makes good 
sense to pick the software first. 

Start by making a list of the 
things you want the computer 
to do. Possibilities include word 
processing, inventory control, 
accounting, graphics, recordkeep- 
ing-you name it, there's probably 
software that does it. 

Next take your list into a com- 
puter store and ask the salesper- 
son to demonstrate software that 
will do the thmgs you want. 

Even though you'll need a com- 
puter for the demonstration, keep 
in mind the computer is just a 
vehicle. The software is the driver. 
Once you've decided on software, 
picking the rest of the computer 
system will be that much easier. 
The simpler the better. 

Some people will tell you that 
software has to be complicated to 
be powerful. Nothing could be fur- 
ther from the truth. 

Good personal software should 
be, as the computer people say, 
"friendly." Meaning that it helps you 
do what you want to do without get- 
ting in the way. 

Good software keeps the com- 
plications in the computer, where 



they belong. And keeps the capa- 
bility at your fingertips. It's that 
simple. 

Simply see for yoursell 

You can read any number of 
interesting books and mag- 
azines about personal 
computers. You can 
ask your friends 
who have 
them. 



Or look 
at all 
the sales 
literature 
you can get 
your hands on. 

But as helpful as 
that can be, there's 
no substitute for a live 
demonstration. 

When you do go shop- 
ping, we recommend 
you take a look at 
the PFS " Family 
of Software. 

Designed 
the way we 
think a soft- 
ware family 
should be: 
simple, 

straightforward 
and powerful. 




Currently there are four software 
packages iii the family: PFS:WRITE, 
PFSPDjE, PFS:REP0RT and PES: 
GRAPH, with more on the way. 
Here's a little more about each of 
them. 

PFS:WRITE. The simplest way 
to get your message across. 

PFSiWRITE is ideal for people 
who want to make their writing time 
more productive. It displays what 
you write on your computer screen 
so you can make revisions as you 
compose. 

With WRITE , you can correct mis- 
spellings or substitute one portion 
of text for another, with just a few 
keystrokes. 

And when you're through revising, 
WRITE shows you "on-screen "just 
how your document will look 
when it's printed. So there 
are no surprises afterwards. 

WRITE also works with 
most popular software pro- 
grams, including the PES 
Family of Software. 

This feature allows you to add 
names and addresses from mailing 
lists to generate form letters. Or 
combine columns of numbers or 
k graphs with your text . 

^kPFS: FILE. The simplest 
^^way to get orgaxuzed. 

^^^FILE is basically a paper filing 
system without the paper. So 
^^^^ you can record, file, retrieve 
and review information in a 
fraction of the time it takes with a 
conventional fOing system. 

With FILE, you anange your 
information on a "form" you design 
yourself. And when you need to 
track something down, FILE sorts 
through your records electronically 
It lets you retrieve information in a 
variety of ways so you can be as 
selective as you want. 

PFS:R£PORT. The simplest 
way to sum it all up. 

REPORT is a powerful analysis 
tool that works with FILE . 

REPORT sorts through your fHes 
and retrieves the information you're 
looking for. Then assembles it aU 
into one report, so you can analyze, 
plan and make better-informed 
decisions. 

REPORT is also good at math. It 
quickly sorts through columns of 
numbers and performs calcula- 
tions, so you won't have to.

PFS:GRAPH. 
The simplest 
way to spot trends. 

GRAPH is ideally suited for 
professionals who need charts or 
graphs in a hurry. 

AU you do is specify the kind of 
graph or chart you want and enter the 
information. GRAPH does the rest. 

GRAPH transforms columns of 
facts and figures into pie, line and 
bar charts so you can spot trends 
quickly and make better-informed 
decisions. 

GRAPH works with PFS: 
WRITE, PFS:FILE,VisiCalc® ^ 
files or data entered directly 
into the computer. And sup- 
ports most popular printers and 
plotters.

Detective work involves information, most of it in tine form of reports generated by 
field officers. Organizing and finding correlations between tfie incoming wave of 
facts used to be a difficult task involving clipboards, maps, pins, charts, and filing 
cabinets— a perfect place for a computer to help, as Lieutenant Moniz (above left) 
and Sergeant Dextradeur (left) point out. 



There are headings for entering ten pieces of information, plus a longer 
space for comments where anything unusual can be added. Most of the 
information thus entered is pretty straightforward. It includes date of the 
crime, name of complainant, address, and so on. However, it also in- 
cludes the day of the week (coded 1-7), a code for the geographical 
district, and a code for the time of day. 

This last is particularly puzzling with burglaries, since the time the 
crime occurred is usually a best-guess situation. To get this information 
into a format useful to both the police and the computer, they've broken 
the day into time zones. Where they can be specific, they are. Where 
they can't, they do their best to narrow the time down to a zone. 

A department secretary enters the information into the computer. The 
detectives pull it out as needed. Lieutenant Moniz and his sergeants are 
all familiar with the machine and software. In this particular instance, the 
patterns that had taken two weeks of part-time work to spot by hand were 
spotted in an hour or two with the Apple. Essentially all that had to be 
done was to ask for the Apple to sort the information, keying on different 
significant items. 

The result was a detailed memorandum from Lieutenant Moniz to the 
uniformed patrol officers in the region. It told them there had been a con- 
centration of burglaries (twenty-three, actually) during the past two 
months in a small portion of their patrol area. It suggested that the com- 
mercial break-ins were taking place between midnight and 6:00 a.m. on 
Sundays and Mondays. The housebreaks were happening on Tuesdays, 
Wednesdays, and Saturdays between 6:00 p.m. and midnight. The 
patrolmen were asked to report anything they heard that might relate to 
past break-ins in this time frame and of course to be on the lookout in the 
designated region during those particular times for suspicious activity. 

In a few days a report came back from one of the officers patrolling 
the area. He had picked up some information on the street. It was just a 
few names and some activity that was difficult to explain, but it fit with 
the other information. It gave detectives the opportunity they needed. 
They questioned the people involved, got more information, and soon 
had enough of a case to arrest two persons and put a warrant out for the 
arrest of a third. 

As this is written the case is still before the courts. But for weeks 
following the arrests, no new pins have gone into the map for that par- 
ticular South End neighborhood. That doesn't mean there won't be 



some. Lieutenant Moniz doesn't expect to turn the world upside down 
with the microcomputer. "We're never going to clear it all off," he 
says, gesturing to the map. "But we're going to slow them down a bit." 

What is fascinating is not the sophistication of the process, but the 
way in which the people involved have taken a relatively simple tool and 
applied it effectively in an unusual area. They are not computer buffs. 
Lieutenant Moniz has some vague ideas about word processing, but he is 
the first to admit that "what I know about computers you could put on 
the tip of your little finger." 

But he does know that detectives live by information. They have a 
need to collect as many facts as possible and then find meaningful rela- 
tionships. Using computers to help in this activity isn't new to law en- 
forcement. The police application has been around practically as long as 
computers, but usually on a larger, more expensive scale. This is not 
New York, Chicago, or Los Angeles. 

Actually, New Bedford police had used a computer for several years. 
Down the hall and up a flight of stairs, in the planning division, was an 
Incoterm computer. But it was out of sight, out of order, and for prac- 
tical purposes not usable for this task — not, at least, without some exten- 
sive reprogramming. The detectives wanted something close at hand — 
something they could tailor to their needs without the help of a program- 
mer. There was a computer buff in one of the other divisions who gave 
them some advice and pointed them in the general direction of Apple. 
They also took their problem to a local consultant. "We learned 
something from that," says Lieutenant Moniz, "but the ideas were on a 
bigger scale than we had in mind." (Scale here was determined by the 
size of the division and the size of the budget.) 

They pretty much settled on the Apple as the machine for the job. 
They drew up a plan and applied for funds from the district attorney's of- 
fice, then put it out to bid. The result was that they bought the Apple lie, 
two drives, a black-and-white monitor, and a dot-matrix printer. They 
also bought PFS.File and a box of blank disks. 

That's it. At this point it's easy to imagine the computer gurus shud- 
dering. Aren't there better programs that will have greater capacity and 
do fancier sorting? Maybe. But it's doubtful that more sophisticated soft- 
ware would be approached with the enthusiasm demonstrated by the 
detectives. They've learned enough about the computer— without benefit 
of federal grants and special seminars— to give them a legitimate return

NOVEMBER 1983 




Oddly enough, many items taken in common house burglaries in New 
Bedford wind up in one of the city's several pawn shops. Local laws 
require pawnbrokers to keep strict accounts of incoming goods; records 
are inspected regularly by Sergeant Larson, who then sees if any of the 
"parts" fit into the "puzzle" held on the Apple. 



on their investment. It's obvious they feel comfortable with it. They use 
it. And in the couple of months they've had to play with it they've 
already begun exploring a variety of creative uses. 

One of the simpler ones is to track stolen property. In fact, it was this 
use that got them started down the computer trail. Stolen property— 
anything that's identifiable, at least— is one of the most concrete leads 
they can have in a burglary, says Lieutenant Moniz. Identifiable fre- 
quently means jewelry with inscriptions, but there are many other possi- 
ble items. 

With several burglaries every day, it doesn't take long to fill up such 
a file of stolen items. Two months into the Apple era. Lieutenant Moniz 
is still hedging his bets by keeping stolen property files using the old 
wood pulp technology. But he also has a PFS.File form that follows the 
general pattern of stolen property information used by the federal 
government's National Crime Information Center computer. (Yes, he 
makes backup disks.) In this file the type of property is keyed by a letter 
(designating general category, such as jewelry, farm equipment, ap- 
pliance) and the first six letters of the name of the property. ("That way 
we don't have to worry about someone spelling something in an unusual 
fashion when they enter it," says Lieutenant Moniz.) 

To see this at work, follow Detective Sergeant Gilbert Larson as he 
makes the rounds of pawn shops and gold and silver dealers. Not a very 
glamorous task, but New Bedford has a stiff ordinance requiring the 
dealers to keep all sorts of useful information about who sold what. The 
first two stops yield little of interest. Then he spots a high school ring 
with the initials "R.W." inscribed in it. Funny. Says here it was brought 
in by "John Smith." 

He makes a few quick notes, then it's back to the office. Pre-Apple 
days would have required an extensive check of paper files — a check that 
wasn't always successful but was nearly guaranteed to be tedious. ("You 
know, the faster a guy can do a job like this, the more enthusiastic he can 
get about it," says Lieutenant Moniz.) 

Today Sergeant Larson sits at the Apple, boots PFS:File, puts in the 
stolen property disk, and from the main menu selects the search function. 

The screen asks for retrieve specifications. Highlighted in reverse 
text in the upper left of the screen are the letters "TYP:". Sergeant Lar- 
son positions the cursor and types "JRING". (The "J" simply indicates 
jewelry.) He quickly jumps the cursor to the line for school and fills in a 



code number. (Each of the schools in the area has been assigned a 
number. It takes up less storage space.) There's a line for year; he types 
"53." 

He presses "control-C," and at the bottom of the screen a series of 
numbers begins a rapid countdown from 486. (The disk was 96 percent 
full with that number of records.) The counting stops at number 239 and 
the screen fills with information. Bingo. A match. The ring was stolen in 
a housebreak. Two weeks ago. Maxwell Street. "Let's go talk to Mr. 
Smith." 

If Mr. Smith came by the ring honestly, he probably can give the 
detectives information that can be verified, in whole or in part. If he 
can't, he may be in for some real trouble. Having stolen property in 
one's possession is no joke. "It's our job to find probable cause," says 
Lieutenant Moniz. "The rest is up to the courts. If a person cannot give 
a reasonable explanation. . . ."He turns his hands palms up. 

Robberies? 

"See these red pins? They're armed robberies." His index finger 
traces a crooked line across the center of the map. There is no geograph- 
ical pattern. But information about each robbery was coded into the PFS 
file and a pattern emerged. 

It wasn't much to go on, but they were able to make an informed 
guess as to the day of week and time of day the robber was likely to strike 
again. Making a guess at the geographical area, they prepared. Result? 
Nothing. "But the guy hit in the next town, Fairhaven," said Moniz. 
The time and day were right. The location was impossible to predict. 
Score one for the bad guys. 

Homicide? 

Well, there's a rather complex case under investigation now. The 
detectives didn't want to talk much about it for obvious reasons, but they 
did say it involved several persons and a thick pile of phone records. It 
would be nice to know who was talking to whom and when, and that too 
was clearly a job for the Apple to tackle. 

"We could use a file on nicknames," he says. "That would be 
helpful. And we have a check-and-fraud unit that I would like to get 
involved." 

The New Bedford police station still looks old. It still gives off an 
aura of yesterday. But in a small office, in the back of a room on the sec- 
ond floor, is a little island of tomorrow. ^1

Unless otherwise noted, all products can be assumed to run on either Apple II, 
with 48K. ROM Applesoft, and one disk drive. The requirement for ROM Ap- 
plesoft can be met by RAM Applesoft in a language card. Many Apple II programs 
will run on the Apple III in the emulator mode. 

If the cryptic initials at the ends of reviews don 't fit staff (listed on page 4), 
then they refer to guest reviewers — this month, Dave Albert, Nick Anis, David 
Chandler, William H. Harrington, Forrest Johnson, Jim Kovalchik, and Howard 
A. Shore. 

Exodus: Ultima III. By Lord British. This evening, in the deep night, 
when the first moon was in its final phase and the second moon was in its 
third, after an arduous quest of 393,976 moves ' duration, the clever and 
agile bowsman and former thief Breadwinner , and the gentle but deadly 
wizard Merlin, did survive to conquer the mighty Exodus. 

Thereafter, they gathered up their dead, the valiant and powerful 
paladin Great, and the beautiful, magical cleric Jessica, and returned to 



Sosaria, where they fought — two alone— to earn the money to resurrect 
their friends at the healer's in the castle of Lord British. 

All four reunited, they sought audience with their monarch, proud in- 
deed and wishing to report to him their great and successful feat and hear 
once more the stirring strains o/Rule Britannia! 

If Lord British weren't already a member of the peerage, he might 
well be knighted by his monarch (whoever that might be) for the enor- 
mous progress he has made from Ultima II to Exodus: Ultima III. 

Improvements are not confined to programming ones, although those 
are rife. For instance, all the creatures are animated; they don't have much 
of a repertoire— balrons flap their wings, ores threaten with their arms, 
cutpurses fence— but the activity adds liveliness. Water no longer swoops 
in cartoon curlicues but gently waves and laps against the shore. Banners 
on castles and towns flap in die wind, realistically unsynchronized. And 
dungeons are full-color. 



NOVEMBER 1983

But the most significant improvements are in the gaming— the plot 
and the player characters. 

Exodus's plot doesn't exist primarily in the documentation. It's a 
crucial, well-integrated foundation for the game, woven well throughout 
play. There is even a mystery of sorts— after all, who is Exodus?— and 
gathering essential clues requires traveling throughout the land, visiting 
every town, dungeon, forest, glen, and beyond. 

The map appears small— much smaller than those of Ultima I or //. 
Gone are the time doors, but moon gates— warps in space dependent on 
the phases of this unique land's two moons — expand the horizons, and 
learning the secret of using them reveals lands unseen. There are no bar- 
ren and useless places such as some of the planets in Ultima II. Every 
place in Ultima III is rich with information and purpose. 

It seems appropriate that such a full universe should have more than a 
single lonely little role-playing critter to explore it, and it does. Lord 
British has provided a means to build twenty characters on the play disk, 
four of whom can travel through the game at a time. Although the group 
is represented by a single figure while moving about, the characters break 
out into unique individuals whenever there's conflict. Then each one is 
controlled separately and can fight or move or cast a spell independent of 
the others. Monsters also break out individually in battle. At just about 
any time, characters in the group can exchange goods and cast spells upon 
each other. 

As usual in the Ultimas, characters start out at a severe disadvantage 
to the adversaries they encounter. But Lord British's characters are not yet 
quite so personal as those in Wizardry, and it's hard not to consider mak- 
ing dummy characters just long enough to take their money, food, and 
arms to strengthen the genuine characters who are going to be playing the 
game— or to collect enough gold to have a Mien character resurrected. 
Everything except experience costs money. 

Among its many hidden features is one that appears only on Apples 
with Mockingboards. Ultima III is accompanied by a complete sound- 
track—an original musical score by Ken Arnold. (At least most of it is 
original. The tune that plays in the presence of Lord British may be slight- 
ly femiliar.) It's as if you were playing a movie. 

Exodus: Ultima III is Lord British's magnum opus— so far. It's fun and 
exciting to play and constantly intriguing. And the ending is marvelously 
unexpected and not a bit disappointing— except that it is the ending, and, 
as with a good book, you'll probably wish there were more. 

When dawn arose, once more did the worthy adventurers. Great, 
Breadwinner, Jessica, and Merlin, set out from the shores of Sosaria. 
They knew the nature of the treasure they were after, and they hoped their 
quest would not be a long one. They sailed in search of Ultima IV. n(T

Infidel. By Michael Berlyn. Fiction writers enjoy developing all kinds of 
characters, not just heroes. Kids, when they're playing make-believe, 
enjoy pretending to be all kinds of people, not just heroes. So why 
shouldn't computer game players enjoy playing roles that aren't heroes? 

The protagonist of Infidel is not a very nice guy— in fact, he's the 
heavy. As the story opens, his generally obnoxious behavior toward 
others has just begun to catch up with him. Without proper planning and 
provision, he has bullied a crew into an archaeological expedition he has 
no right to make, all for stolen glory and wealth. Now the crew has aban- 
doned him in the desert and taken all the provisions with them. Ironical- 
ly, a crucial navigational tool arrives by plane-drop just after our 
nonhero discovers the mutiny. Angry and alone, he can use the device to 
fmd the buried pyramid they were seeking and explore it for its treasures 
and secrets. 

And, of course, that is the meat of the game. Now the player takes 
control of this rather Machiavellian person. Since you probably aren't 
mean, unscrupulous, and greedy, and since you're probably a lot more 
interested in solving the puzzles than in whether the imaginary pyramid 
is sacred, this is where you pretty much forget about the character of 
your character. 

The puzzles are excellent. Although losing sight of the unique por- 
trayal leaves you playing a relatively standard, single-protagonist-in-the- 
world adventure, that standard adventure is among the best of its kind. 
And a twistingly clever ending returns your antihero to himself. 

It's a terrific concept— that of creating games in which we can play 



roles very different from ourselves— and Berlyn is a fine enough writer 
to achieve it. Perhaps if there were puzzles that required behaving dis- 
honorably for solution . . . beyond greed, that is. All adventurers have 
learned to accept as a given the idea of gathering up all the treasure as if 
they had a right to it without any reference to reality. So characterizing 
greed is temporarily ineffective. 

But there are all sorts of possibilities. . . . 

Other than providing a fascinating, well- written background and set- 
ting, the alter-characterization doesn't work in Infidel. However, the ad- 
venture remains one of the best and certainly one of the most literary 
games available. So play it and relish its puzzles and, when you're 
through, sit back and enjoy contemplating the gaming future it 
suggests. nCT

The General Manager. By Paul Malachowski and Kevin Cooper. This 
program should win the overlooked-four-leaf-clover award. 

It's been around awhile, it's the best Apple database there is, and its 
sales don't reflect that. Yet The General Manager is cream — and we all 
know what cream does. 

This program will operate in forty or eighty columns, with 48 or 64K 
memory, and with one to four disk drives. And all these versions are 
contained on one disk. The real beauty of The General Manager is its ex- 
pandability. You can start with a one-drive forty-column Apple II Plus, 
and as your database and wallet grow you can expand the system to 
eighty columns, 64K memory, and a ten-megabyte hard disk. If you 
don't think this is a nice feature, try reentering a few hundred records 
when you've outgrown your present filing system. 

The General Manager is totally menu-driven, a feature that is helpful 
for the first-time user. Other nice features include the ability to program 
the open and closed apple keys on the lie, a print screen function in the 
data search mode, a very powerful report generator, and the ability to 
write an Applesoft user interface program to format the data to fit on any 
form. 

Unlike many of its competitors. The General Manager is a complete 
system. There's no need to purchase any utilities or sort disks. 
Everything, including a powerful report generator, is here. The utilities 
include a sort, which will sort the entire database on any field or com- 
bination of fields, and a ftinction that lets the user globally update and 
delete selected records. The most powerful facet of the whole program is 
the user interface capability. This feature allows someone with a 
knowledge of Basic programming to manipulate the stored data in any 
fashion desired. The interface program can be used to format data need- 
ed to fill out invoices or medical insurance forms, mix graphics and text, 
update records, and numerically count or total any figures in the 
database. In short, the user interface program is useful anytime the 
database restricts you from manipulating data or printing the way 
you'd like. 

The General Manager does have a few shortcomings. One is the way 
the database handles dead records (the originals of records that have been 
changed or rewritten). These records continue to take up space on disk 
unless they are eliminated by reorganizing. Another problem occurs with 
the documentation of error messages. There isn't any! This can be ex- 
pensive and frustrating, especially if you have to call Sierra On-Line 
from the East Coast. However, the folks at Sierra On-Line provide 
strong user support for their program, and its flaws are minuscule com- 
pared to its overall worth. The General Manager is flexible, expandable, 
self-contained, and powerful. In fact, CP/M aside (maybe), it's the best 
dam database on the market. Ili

Spare Change. By Dan and Mike Zeller. Perhaps movies really came 
into their own when people stopped going to see a movie per se and 
began going to a drama when they wanted a good story, a horror flick 
when they felt like the excitement, and a comedy when they wanted to 
laugh and have fun. As movies developed and the process itself stopped 
being quite so enthralling, producers and directors began looking more 
closely at the content and dared to specialize. 

Some computer adventure games have recently shown signs of this.

NOVEMBER 1983 



Some involve their players emotionally — the seeds of drama. Spare 
Change brings comedy to the medium— superbly. 

Spare Change is a home-arcade game— second. First, it is Laurel and 
Hardy, the Keystone Kops, Harpo, Groucho, and boffo. Those roles are 
taken by the Zerks, two funny littie leggy people with strange tops who 
just happen to live inside an arcade game. The player as arcade manager 
is stuck with being a straight man— but not straight-faced. 

All the Zerks want is to save up five tokens in their squiggly-tailed 
piggy bank, and they don't care whose tokens they use. All the player 
wants is to store up enough tokens to get to see the Zerks perform in the 
Zerk show. But the Zerks are quick and pesty, and they keep taking the 
player's tokens right out of his bin. They don't manage to get all they 
grab to their piggy bank; they bump into one another and drop tokens, 
miss, or the player intercepts a pass from one Zerk to the other and gets 
his token back. 

At this rate, level 1 could go on for a long time, and the Zerks 
would almost surely win. Luckily, Zerks have a failing. They have no 
resistance to distractions in the form of things they enjoy. When the 
player feeds a token to the jukebox, the Zerks just have to dance; when 
the player plops a token into the pay phone, the Zerks haven't the will 
power to let the thing ring— they run to a phone and talk to each other. 
Even the see-through popcorn machine has irresistible charm for them. 

Does this make it fairly easy for the player to keep them busy while 
he gathers tokens to see the show? Not exactly. You see, the player, 
being the sane and serious one in this colorful world, has responsibilities. 
He must keep the token machines stoked with money from the cash 
register or there'll be no tokens for anyone. And the cash register runs 
out too, and he must bring money from the safe to fill it. Oh, the trials of 
a manager. 

And what, after all this, about the reward? What is the Zerk show? 
Cartoons, of course. Not the kill-yourself-laughing roll-in-the-aisles 
kind, but pure whimsy. You win a look at one per level, and every fourth 
level you get a whole Zerk show, at which point you can run any of three 
cartoons, twelve in all. James Thurber, eat your heart out.

The game itself is no Lode Runner, but then neither was Choplifter. 
It's a good enough game, better than most on the market, and the bright 
graphics, ultrasmooth animation, clever sound effects, and solid comedy 
make all the difference. Still, just to add a bit of challenge (or lessen it— 
in case you can't wait to see the higher-level cartoons), Broderbund, the 
people-caring company, has installed a player-control panel. You can 
alter the Zerks; make them dance more, stay hopping mad longer, be 
klutzier, and miss their piggy bank more often. Or you can make them 
smarter and more agile for a solid challenge. Once again, you do pay for 
your preferences; altered games don't make the scoreboard. 

So if you feel like watching Saturday Night Live but can't remember 
how to unhook your television from your Apple and hook it into your 
antenna, if you're in the mood for Mel Brooks but forget where the 
movie theater is, if you'd like to curl up with the latest Fran Lebowitz but 
she hasn't written it yet, boot up Spare Change and chuckle, chuckle, 
chuckle.

Masquerade. By Dale Johnson. Diabolically clever puzzles for the sake 
of solvers who like hard thinking and testing and trying and that moment 
of click! I see, that's it! That's Masquerade. 

It's an adventure puzzle solver's piece de resistance, but not every- 
one's cup of tea. If Lipton's your brand, forget it; pull up a cup of Twin- 
ing 's and play Masquerade. 

There's a plot centered on underworld crime — beautifully depicted in 
high-quality cartoon-style graphics even better than those of Phoenix's 
Sherwood Forest. But the plot isn't very important; it's merely a base on 
which to build puzzles. 

But what puzzles! One of the top adventurers around boasted that he 
had breezed through the opening puzzles, although now he was momen- 
tarily stuck. He was astonished when he was told that he may have found 
one set of solutions to the opening puzzles, but in fact he had already lost 
the game. He had overlooked two cunningly hidden clues and had solved 
a major problem in such a way as to cut himself off from half the game. 

So you save the game a lot in Masquerade. The disk provides lots of 
room for it. And keep track of which point you've saved under which 
number; you'll undoubtedly have to go back to an early save once or 
twice. 

Phoenix considers this game so hard that they've given it their level 5 
rating— most difficult— and they're offering a thousand-dollar prize to 
one of the people who can send in the whole solution by June 30, 1984. 
Hard it is, but the puzzles are logical and solvable. And satisfying, too. 

There are a lot of animals in Masquerade, by the way. A bird, a 
gorilla, a snake, a rat, all beautifully drawn. And a dog. Only you never 
see the dog. He's too shaggy. flCT

The Coveted Mirror. By Eagle Bems and Holly Thomason. Expression 
brings life. This very nicely drawn hi-res adventure takes place in an at- 
mospheric medieval village filled with animated people the adventurer 
can talk to, and each one is distinguished by a characteristic expression. 
For example, the nasty (no one in Coveted Mirror is really evil) king 
looks like the powerful and royally unreasonable ruler he is, and the fact 
that he has a twitch that makes him scowl periodically renders him both 
more sinister and slightly ludicrous. Netta the nag has a mouth that never 
stops wagging; the kindly farmer Ferd raises his eyebrows expectantly; 
and the lovesick astronomer's eyelids droop and widen as he dreams. 
The animation isn't perfect, but what a liveliness it brings to the 
characters! 

A few characters are just for color, but most have relevant clues to 
give. Clues build on clues, and solving puzzles leads to more important 
puzzles. Seldom does the adventurer feel at a loss about what else there is 
to do; the problem is deciding what to do, when, and how. And as for the 
puzzles, some are easy and others hard, but most are logical and fun. 
They often involve putting together prior observations, and if by chance 
you haven't yet observed all you need, you just won't be able to solve 
them. When in doubt, explore. 

Bems and Thomason have done some experimenting. There are half 
a dozen games within this advenmre. Two are relatively gentle arcade-

type games, one is a Simon-like exercise, and others are informa- 
tion-type games or guessing games — depending on whether you know 
the answers. It's necessary to complete most of them to win; some 
strengthen characteristics you need for other puzzles. And don't worry, 
you get all the tries you need— they just cost time. 

Time is of the essence. Formally, the adventurer is imprisoned in the 
castle of King Voar. But the dungeon cell is not locked, only guarded, 
and the guards are pretty friendly, especially if you give them a nice 
goodie. You can always wander out of the cell between watches; the 
more valuable the bribe the longer that period will be. The worst that can 
happen to you is to be sent back to your cell. No one ever gets killed in 
The Coveted Mirror. 

The designers of The Coveted Mirror are gentle people, and that 
shows throughout. The game often tells you when you're getting close to 
something or when you're on the wrong track; sometimes it seems to 
understand that you're heading for a mistake and throws you a clue. 

The bits of humor included, asides for the authors, as it were, seem 
surprising but not distracting. Somehow they seem to fit in, perhaps be- 
cause they often echo what you're thinking. It's as though Berns and 
Thomason are there with you as you play, poking gentle fun at their 
game now and then. They're caring folk. And the care isn't forgotten at 
the end either. The final puzzle requires careful thought, and when you 
solve it you crave more than a simple, "You won." And you get more. 
Wait and see. flCT

Caverns of Callisto. By Chuckles. The story so far: A swarm of mutants 
has ravaged the spaceship, taken crucial parts, and scurried off into 
hiding below the surface of Callisto. It doesn't take too much effort to 
figure out that the task at hand is to recover the missing parts of the ship 
and repair it. 

Caverns of Callisto plays like one of those good news -bad news 
routines. The good news is that you're armed with a plasma rifle that will 
destroy a mutant with a single shot. The bad news is that you usually 
miss. It's like this: You don't really control your man with the joystick; 
he stays in the center while cavern walls and mutants move around rela- 
tive to him. Unfortunately, your rifle shots also move in relation to you. 

What this means is that if you move after you fire your rifle, your 
shots will move similarly. Even if you have the mutant in your gun's 
sight when you pull the trigger, you'll be way off target if you move so 
much as a few pixels after firing. 

Other good news is that Origin has thoughtfully included in the 
packaging a map of the caverns. The bad news is that you need two pairs 
of eyes to make use of it. Mutants appear so frequently that it's impossi- 
ble even to sneak a glance at the map. Nonetheless, the map is a necessi- 
ty. Fly around without it and you may as well concede the game. 

More bad news is that mutants are virtually everywhere, and they 
never stop coming. The good news is that you don't have to kill them to 
get rid of them. You see, the game works in such a way that if you fly so 
that the mutants disappear off the side of the screen, they won't be there 
when you fly back. Was the programmer generous, or lazy? 

Let's face it. This isn't a game of retrieving lost things in a maze and 
escaping with your life. It's a game of killing as many mutants as you can 
without overheating your gun. Although you're awarded generous points 
for picking up rocket parts, keys, and your ion drive (the ion drive is 
worth one hundred thousand points), there seems to be littie incentive to 
find all that stuff unless you can escape to repair the ship. What's the 
point in spending hundreds of dollars at the grocery store unless you can 
make it home to eat the food? 

Looked at as a test of survival skills, the game is somewhat 
challenging— if you're the type who doesn't become frustrated quickly. 
Trying to maneuver through the caverns with a joystick (there isn't any 
keyboard mode) will let you know what it's like trying to perform 
surgery with boxing gloves on; a delicate touch is needed, to say the very 
least. 

One new twist here is that you do get an additional hundred thousand 
points for completing the game. And after that . . .? 

If the projects that Origin Systems has cooking in the oven turn out to 
be half as good as they sound, computer gamers should be in for some 
real treats. In all fairness. Caverns of Callisto shouldn't be taken as an in- 
dication of either the programmer's or the company's true talents. 



Chuckles has turned out superior things in the past and probably will 
again in the future.

Magicalc. By William Graves. Magicalc expands on the features of clas- 
sic spreadsheet programs and encourages the user's creativity in spread- 
sheet modeling. 

Perhaps its most valuable feature is automatic and efficient use of up 
to512K of RAM. 

Spreadsheet models created with Magicalc, like VisiCalc, can use 
254 rows, each divided into sixty-three columns. That's about sixteen 
thousand cells that can hold numerical values, labels, or formulas. But, 
even if you're neat and economical and restrict each cell to a ten-character 
entry, you'll have filled a 64K Apple's memory by the time you've used 
about two thousand cells. In practical terms, this means that a model with 
monthly entries covering two years is only good for about eighty differ- 
ent items. If you include cost, price, and net profit for each item, you're 
reduced to an overview of only twenty-five or thirty items. 

Spreadsheet users have traditionally responded to memory limitations 
by cramming the data and labels as close together as possible, limiting 
the scale of the problems they attack, and breaking up large unified prob- 
lems into fragmented smaller ones. 

VisiCalc Pre-boot has made it possible to create 200K models, but 
VisiCalc users cannot conveniently store such large models on Apple's 
standard 128K disks. CP/M-based spreadsheets allow for large-scale 
disk storage but are incapable of using large amounts of RAM for the 
model. Magicalc allows 512K in RAM via RAM cards and RAM disks, 
and unlimited disk storage, by neatly clipping a large model into seg- 
ments for storage on several standard Apple disks. It's completely com- 
patible with hard disks and high-density floppies. 

The freedom to expand memory encourages the use of good graphic 
technique when laying out a spreadsheet. Magicalc is automatically com- 
patible with most eighty-column boards and accepts special drivers for 
using others. Even without an eighty -column board Magicalc provides a

seventy-column option from software. 

Magicalc has easy commands for variable column widths and 
full-featured replication that permits selective patterns of duplication. 
Magicalc uses the four arrow keys on the He and treats the marker as if 
it were a cursor in a word processor. However, Magicalc's formatting 
capabilities lack automatic centering of labels and decimal-point align- 
ment when not in dollar mode. 

The user can assign attributes to each cell, row, or column, specify- 
ing values or labels, hidden or protected. Once you have assigned pro- 
tected cells, a tabbing feature lets you automatically skip to the next cell 
or the previous unprotected cell during data entry. 

Magicalc's utilities are available through Artsci's standard easy-to- 
use menu system, which users of Magic Window have appreciated for 
two years. The menus use a highlight bar to select options. Typing the 
number of an option highlights the choice, and the program waits for 
confirmation, which is simply pressing return. 

A fde option menu offers the standard load, save, and DIF options 
plus lock and unlock commands that help prevent accidental deletion of 
important files. The files are catalogued by number; a file is selected by 
entering merely the number that appears next to it. 

The print subsystem, also using the special menu system, accepts spe- 
cialized printer setup codes, so you can use features such as variable line 
and character spacing. 

Before printing a model, you can select top, bottom, and side margins 
and length and width of each sheet of paper. Magicalc accommodates the 
compressed (17 cpi) format available on many dot-matrix printers, so it's 
simple to print out 132-column sheets. 

A bonus is the ability to print to disk. Many spreadsheet programs 
convert data into text fdes so that the information can be organized and 
printed with a word processing program, but those files are usually 
stripped of much of the structure you've built into the model. Magicalc's 
print-to-disk feature generates text files for a word processor that appear 
much like your original screen. 

With all it does for you, Magicalc makes you work when it comes to 
formulas. While some recent spreadsheet programs provide fairly 
elaborate financial and calendar ftinctions at the press of a key, Magi- 
calc's built-in formulas encompass the same set of twenty-five or thirty 
functions that have been in spreadsheets for years. 

Still, Magicalc is quick and slick, and, if you're willing to go the ex- 
tra mile, you're apt to find it outperforming your expectations. In any 
case, it provides one of the best performance/price ratios on the market 
today. flA

Eagles. By Robert Raymond. Looking for all the world like an overripe, 
elongated tomato, the German observation balloon sits one hundred feet 
below, nestled among bristling antiaircraft carmons. The ground crew is 
frantically trying to winch it down, while the guns fdl the air with bursts 
of fire. A slight push on the controls and now it's in the gunsights. 
Squeeze the trigger again. . . . 

The guns jammed! Holes begin to appear in the fabric of the Sopwith 
biplane. Suddenly the whole aircraft shudders as the engine begins to 
miss. Once again defeat has been snatched from the jaws of victory. You 
cannot outclimb the pair of Fokker DRIs above you, no matter how in- 
viting the clouds that drift so lazily overhead. Perhaps a quick dive 
homeward will lure the Germans into the sights of your compatriots; at 
least you might survive to see the aerodrome again— and listen to the 
squad leader complain about overworked mechanics and careless airmen 
while you wait for your craft to be repaired. 

Eagles is a maddening game, quite delightful in its appeal to the 
imagination and sometimes frustrating in its play. It is an introductory- 
level air war simulation from the folks at Strategic Simulations, and it 
can provide a good deal of enjoyment to the beginning war gamer; how- 
ever, the more experienced player may fmd it wanting in some respects. 

Taking place in the last two years of World War I, the game features 
eighteen predefined aircraft types, including balloons and reconnais- 
sance planes. Combat may take place among up to twenty aircraft, with 
the Allied forces being made up of a single type of plane and the German 
side consisting of a variety of planes. The game allows for different 
weapons capacity and characteristics, as well as varying degrees of pilot 
skills. The player may assume the role of either the German or Allied 
pilot and may play against another player or the computer. 



Once either the computer or the player has defined the scenario, 
game play is fairly quick and relatively easy to learn. The play Field is 
divided into an unmarked grid over which the player can move a maxi- 
mum of two squares per move. Most moves will cover only one square 
and will permit the player to turn either left or right while climbing or 
diving. Each plane is rated for maneuverability, climbing and diving 
capacity, speed, weaponry, and structural strength. The ratings are then 
translated into percentile chances of accomplishing a maneuver. 

Failure to make one's maneuver successfully often results in disaster, 
since the plane may wind up anywhere, usually facing in the wrong 
direction. 

Actual game play is where the program shines. The microcomputer is 
great at crunching all the numbers involved and spitting out an answer 
that neither player can argue with. With pencil and paper each move 
would be painstakingly long and often subject to debate, old-time war 
gamers being a disputatious and cantankerous lot. With a computer, 
however, there can be no arguments and the results of a move are 
calculated in the twinkling of a raster. There may not be another form of 
gaming that is so well suited to computers as is the war game. 

However, occasional oversights can also make the computerized 
simulation a frustrating beast. Normally, the computer will detail avail- 
able targets after the player's move, allowing one to fire a burst at the 
enemy. Sometimes while playing Eagles, however, the computer will 
ask the player to input the I.D. number of a target craft while neglecting 
to tell the player who is within shooting range. Since gunnery takes place 
midway through a turn, the player cannot revert to the overview screen 
to get the necessary information and winds up shooting blind. 

Therein lies another of Eagles' flaws: verification of a move. When a 
plane chooses to dive, climb, or make virtually any move, the player 
must input a mnemonic letter or digit. The plane moves in 25-foot 
increments — 3 equals 75, 6 equals 150, and so on. If the absent-minded 
player needs to dive 250 feet and begins to type in that number, he winds 
up diving 50 feet, and there is no way to change the move even if one 
catches the mistake before finishing the input. In an arcade action game, 
those are just the breaks. But Eagles is a simulation, and a real life WWI 
pilot could not afford such a mistake.

Similarly, Eagles provides for partial disabling of pilot or craft but 
fails to let the player know about it on a continuing basis. If one is 
wounded, or one's engine gets hit, the fighting capacity is reduced. 
However, no note is made of this by the program, either on the graphics 
screen or the overview screen. In a one-on-one dogfight this is a minor 
inconvenience, but when the player is trying to keep track of seven or 
eight planes it becomes a matter of paramount importance to know whose 
guns work and which pilot can or cannot successfully pull off a climbing 
half loop! 

Except for these minor flaws, Eagles is a wonderful game and a very 
good introduction to war games for the novice. The play is fast-paced, 
with the game complex enough to provide lots of entertainment. It is par- 
ticularly enjoyable in the two-player mode and does away with the 
squabbling that made paper-and-pencil war games all but impossible to 
play with any but the best of friends. If one is not already a war gamer. 
Eagles is an excellent game on which to begin. DA

Gruds in Space. By Chuck Sommerville and Joseph Dudar. Talk about 
antiheroes. In this hi-res space adventure the hero is a Hans Solo-like 
captain who is perfectly willing to save the human race — for the small fee 
of one million dollars. To accomplish this feat and get the bucks, he must 
coax some Saturn miners out of their precious fuel and deliver it to the 
United Federation (the hope of mankind), who just happen to be out of 
gas in the middle of a battle. 

Sounds easy, but when the hero gets there he finds a very hostile situ- 
ation. The Saturn miners are all Gruds: They hate humans and charge 
them double for everything. Nice of Sirius to quarantine all those loose

trick the Gruds, steal from the Gruds, buy their way through the game,

mysterious eyes blink in the dark, lights flash, and clocks' pendulums 
swing. These animated touches enliven the graphics and provide a third 
dimension to the screen, giving players the feeling of being there. 
"There," however, is back and forth across the solar system so many 
times that you could qualify for the million-light-year club! Much too 
often, players are required to find an object at point A, take it to point B 
to use, and go back and get something else at point A that then requires 
a return to point B. Some of that is fiin, but it's overdone in this program. 
Excessive back and forth shuttling is no substitute for development of 
locale. 

Apart from this, however, many of the puzzles are quite challenging 
and some even offer multiple solutions. Save often— Gruds love to sur- 
prise you with nasty tricks and diabolical traps. 

Withal, it's the well-drawn animated Gruds that save the game. Per- 
haps some day the screen will be completed, and the player will be sub- 
merged within the game's universe. RRA

Argos. By Ron Lowrance. Why does Dave Gordon have an arrow through 
his head? 

Is he trying to prove that the people at Datamost are out of their heads? 
Possibly. Out of ideas for games? Probably. 

Want to know what Argos is about? Just boot it up and play. Don't 
read the instructions; you won't need them. Don't read the story line; 
it doesn't matter. Don't think about the game; it just proves that anyone 
can design a computer game. 

Argos is divided into three rounds. The first round is Datamost' s re- 
creation of Broderbund's A.E. The enemy ships fly in formation like the 
aliens in A.E. , and the firing technique is the same— press button to fire; 
release button to detonate missiles. A new twist here is that missiles can 
be guided by the joystick, which gives the player more control after the 
missiles have been launched. The players' perspective is also different 
in Argos. Instead of being situated at the bottom of the screen, as is con- 
ventional in this genre, the player's battle station orbits in the upper left- 
hand comer. And stays there. 

Argonians fly slowly enough to be decimated without much trouble. 
Programmer Ron Lowrance recognized this and compensated for it; one 
hit from the Argonians and the game is over. 

In case shooting aliens from the upper left-hand comer of the screen 
is too revolutionary a change, round two gets back on the ground, allow- 
ing the player to fight from familiar territory. The pesky Argonians have 
penetrated the earth's atmosphere and are attacking ground forces now, 
trying to take over Lx)st Angeles, the last surviving city on Earth. Getting 
excited? 

Though this phase of the game is by far the simplest (hold down but- 
ton zero and aim toward the skies), not everyone may choose to win. Many 
residents of northern California and other parts of the country would just 
as soon let Lost Angeles be decimated. But for serious gamers, there's 
finally round three. 

There's a tank. It fires from the bottom of the screen. The player can 
move it left and right. Aliens descend and parachute from the sky. Can 
you handle this much excitement? 

The goal is to survive. To quote the game's instructions, "Stay alive 
as long as possible and score as many points as you can. After all, life 
is challenging only as long as you continue to fight! One more thing- 
save Earth! ' ' Jeez, no wonder Dave Gordon has an arrow through his head! 

The concepts in Argos are not, by anybody's measure, original, or 
even challenging. However, credit must be given to Lowrance for his fine 
execution of the game's graphics and animation. 

Gamers who have reached the higher levels in Bandits, Repton, or 
even Threshold will find little in Argos to hold their attention. Novices, 
on the other hand, may see Argos as a painless primer in shoot-'em-ups 
that will give them a feeling of success, until they're ready to move up to, ^ 
say, Mating Zone. IITV

want just because of the time and money spent. 

Refreshingly enough, Ana-List does not contribute to these problems. 
Refreshingly enough, there are no murky advertisements here proclaim- 
ing the wonders of a product that's too unspecialized for use. And no 
unrealistic demand of time either. This product processes lists and 
analyzes the data without frills and fanfare. It doesn't claim features it 
doesn't have. Any manager who uses lists and tables would benefit by 
using this basically straightforward program. And Ana-List need not be 
restricted to a business office. Such software could be used to handle lists 
for a stamp collector, manage a collection of VCR tapes, or sort 
telephone numbers. Ana-List not only manages the compilation of data 
but also presents an analysis of the stored material in almost any manner 
desired. Reports are easily prepared and neatly typed and numeric fields 
are automatically calculated. Programs that use the DIF format, such as 
VisiCalc, can exchange information with Ana-List. 

This product has several pleasant feamres, and the investment of time 
and money is certainly competitive with most database management 
systems. It only takes an hour of practice to grasp the basics and some of 
the more advanced features of Ana-list. The tutorial (forty-three pages of 
easy-to-read text) shows the user how to create a list, a skeleton of 
titles and column headings, to which data is added. Ana-list takes the 
pencil and paper out of your hands and puts the information on-screen. 

Documentation problems do exist but are not insurmountable. For 
example, some screen representations in the tutorial are inaccurate. The 
mtorial display shows an eighty-character line taking up the space of ex- 
actly one line, but in reality Ana-List won't display all eighty characters 
on one line unless you use the formatting section. Additionally, Ana- 
List's tutorial doesn't tell you that you need to use the same formatting 
section to configure the program for two disk drives. Also, an extra press 
of return is occasionally requested where it is not needed— and is not 
called for where such a keypress is necessary. 



Positive features of the program include a tabbed reference section 
for each of Ana-List's capabilities. Each tab letter relates to a section of 
the documentation where additional information may be found about the 
section you're looking at. Also, during printing, the program feeds paper 
to the top of the page for each new report so users don't have to con- 
tinuously adjust the paper. In addition, Ana-List's varying format can let 
the user completely customize reports, with calculations carried out to 
user-specified decimal places. Ana-List can also do multiple sorts of as 
many as ten columns rapidly. Numbers ranging from -1.0x10^' to 
1 .OxlC can be worked by Ana-List. With 48K the program can manage 
lists containing up to 800 items and an extra 16K increases list capability 
to 2,700 items, with tables ranging from one to forty-six columns wide. 

Is this perfection? No, but certainly value received for dollar and time 
invested. Ana-List is easier to use than some heavily advertised 
packages, includes backup disk and manageable tutorial, and possesses a 
complete tabbed reference section for each of the program's capabilities. 
This product does exactly what the cover indicates — processes lists and 
tables. In Ana-List, truth in advertising has found a home. HL

Minit Man. By Greg Malone. It is the fate of every new arcade game 
featuring a helicopter to be compared to Choplifter. So let's say it right 
off: The helicopter in Choplifter is better than the helicopter in Minit 
Man — easier to fly, more responsive, more realistic. As far as looks go, 
Choplifter beats it by a mile. But in terms of game complexity and dif- 
ficulty, there is no comparison. Minit Man is as mercilessly difficult and 
minutely detailed an arcader as you are likely to fmd. 

The idea is to build a bridge over a gorge, flying in the appropriate 
girders and trusses with your helicopter and lowering them into place 
(this isn't some wimpy Bell-jet model as in Choplifter, this is a double- 
rotor Huey muscle chopper). When the bridge is complete, a train chugs

across it with missile in tow. At this point, you fly to the adjoining 
command center, land on the roof, climb out of your chopper, and skip 
down to the basement and the launch computer. If you launch three 
missiles successfully, they presumably land in the right place and all is 
once more well with the world. Of course, it is not that easy. 

As fate would have it, all the best bridge girders are located as far 
away from the bridge as possible— two screens to the right. The enemy is 
a relentless swarm of marauding robots who realize it is not in their best 
interests that you complete your bridge, so they crash into I-beams, shoot 
at you, and begin to infiltrate the command center, where they slowly 
work their way down through the floors to the launch computer. There 
are also dish-shaped, particle-emitting radio transmitters guarding the 
aerial approaches to both the bridge and the building materials. In addi- 
tion, you are being timed. A minute is shaved off the clock with each 
succeeding level. You definitely have to be good at multiple-task man- 
agement to be good at Minit Man. 

If you're not, you can still sit back and admire it as an impressive pro- 
gramming job. This game is built like a Swiss watch or one of the con- 
fabulated mechanical wind-up toys favored by Chinese emperors in 
which tiny parts move in exact, efficient precision. Notice that when you 
are over the girders, a tiny magnetic grapple automatically descends. It 
must, of course, be centered just right to pick up the girder so as not to 
overbalance the helicopter. Notice that whenever you land, moving the 
joystick left or right— zur a/or5.'— immediately causes the tiny pilot to 
emerge from the helicopter. He can run, leap, duck, and fire a gun. 

Then he can run back into the helicopter and take off. Notice, too, 
that zapping a marauding robot once merely causes it to mutate to 
another form— a second zap causes it to take yet another shape. The third 
time's the charm, but in disintegrating, it leaves a mine behind. 

The program does, of course, have a few seams showing. There is a 
brief pause after your chopper clears the limit of each screen before it ap- 
pears in the next one. And if you run out of girders and trusses (you real- 
ly have to be clumsy), the show's over. But when a game has this much 
going for it, as with Dr. Johnson's performing dog, the miracle is not 
that it should be done well, but that it is done at all. A(

How To Operate the Apple lie. A plethora of computer instructional 
aids abounds in today's marketplace, each one vying for the dollar of 
new Apple lie owners. FlipTrack Learning Systems's program should 
earn those dollars because it clearly and patiently explains how to use 
the Apple He — covering most of the basic and even some intermedi- 
ate topics. 

The system requires a cassette recorder, preferably one with a digital 
counter, and a commitment of time by the student. The topic areas in- 
clude Getting Acquainted, Using Disk Storage, and Making Copies and 
Program Changes. Each one occupies its own cassette. The essence of 
the FlipTrack system is the supplementary information provided on the 
flip side of each cassette. For example, after listening to rudimentary 
editing techniques on the Getting Acquainted cassette, a user can receive 
additional information by turning the cassette over. The digital counter is 
reset to zero and more helpful techniques are given. Then, when this area 
is completed, the tape is simply rewound untU the counter reads zero, the 
cassette is repositioned so that side 1 is ready for access, and the student 
finds that he has returned to the juncture where the program was 
originally halted. This is a simple and effective method to introduce ad- 
vanced materials only to those interested in them. No one is force fed 
with FlipTrack's system. 

The student is given ample time during instruction to gather needed 
materials, as well as to experiment with ideas already presented. And the 
instructor's voice is indeed easy to listen to and pleasant, with no subject 
matter given haste. Each topic is discussed in depth, and little is left un- 
covered. Someone new to computing could, within half an hour, manage 
to be on a nodding acquaintance with his He after listening to Getting 
Acquainted. Not only are the basics of disk booting and running a pro- 
gram covered, but a look "under the hood" helps cure the novice of 
computerphobia. The student learns that he is boss ... not the inanimate 
object confronting him. 

For those with additional equipment, such as eighty-column card or 
printer, the FlipTrack system appends the standard instruction by using 
side 2 of the cassette to increase knowledge in those areas. Arithmetic 
operations, displaying text, and other necessities are handled with clarity 



on tape 1 . 

Tape 2, Using Disk Storage, soon has the student programming a 
simple greeting program with which to initialize blank disks. It also 
teaches the method by which binary, Applesoft, Integer, or text files can 
be copied from one disk to another, how to make a single-sided disk dou- 
ble-sided, as well as how to place secret control codes in program names 
to protect them from unwanted prying. 

Making copies and program changes is taught on tape 3 and manages 
to cover everything from duplicating disks to modifying programs and 
screen displays. 

On each of the three tapes, side 2 quizzes the student through ques- 
tions and demonstrations. Although these examinations are strictly op- 
tional, they represent a method by which the He owner can demonstrate 
his or her own success at learning the material presented. A handy 
operator's guide is included with the course and saves the student the 
necessity of taking notes. All the material in the guide is concisely for- 
matted for future reference. 

FlipTrack bases the start of its instruction on the Apple program disks 
supplied with the computer when purchased and expands upon the 
manuals that are also packed with the Apple He. For beginning com- 
puterites anxious to learn the proper methods for using their new pride 
and joy, FlipTrack Learning Systems's How To Operate the Apple lie is 
well worth the investment . . . both in time and money. HL

prize fights that never were and might have been can now be fought and 
refought before your eyes. 

In Ringside Seat the player uses extensive statistics to manage 
history's greatest sluggers as they refight one of the great bouts of all 
time. Or, in the most intriguing aspect of the game, the player can match 
fighters from different eras to determine once and for all who really was 
the greatest. The boxers perform as they actually fought. Strength, style, 
speed, and endurance are all statistically represented, and you can even 
create and save to disk your own fighters. However, should you simply 
want to play "what if," you can let the computer control both fighters 
and sit back and watch the action. Be warned; you may be on the edge of 
your seat in moments. The only thing left out is the sweat and cigar 
smoke as the announcer intones, "And in this comer, wearing the white 
trunks. ..." 

Ringside Seat can be played by two players against each other or a 
single player against the computer's manager. Just as in any respectable 
smoke-filled athletic club or the legendary Madison Square Garden, you, 
as the coach, select your fighter's strategy for each round in the ring. Up 
to seven separate strategies are available. Fighters may stand flat-footed 
and slug it out or charge in and try to score points with the judges. If your 
opponent begins to tire, then go for the knockout but look out for the 
counterpunch. And if your fighter gets in trouble during a round, you can 
elect to cover up by changing strategies in midround. 

The grueling physical and mental punishment of boxing has been ac- 
curately depicted in Ringside Seat. Exhausted fighters are harder to con- 
trol and more apt to neglect their coach's fight strategy. And should your 
fighter become too fatigued, he may become completely unable to follow 
your fight plan. 

Ringside Seat employs an innovative graphics system and screen 
display to bring you literally all the blow-by-blow action and excitement 
you'd expect ringside. In the center of the screen, two hi-res fighters 
represent the current contestants. As each fighter lands a punch, 
clinches, or falls to the mat for the count, the action is shown on-screen. 
In addition, you can follow the scoring of each of the three judges round 
by round. The simulation even provides a constant running description of

Fay: That Math Woman. By David Vincent and Paul Melhus. 
Feminism— what a concept! It has permeated practicaUy every aspect of 
life, and now, at last, it has arrived in computerized education in the 
bustling, efficient form of Fay. Her arrival is a timely one. 

Fay: That Math Woman is designed to teach math to children in 
grades one through four. It contains six levels of number line problems 
in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

After booting the disk, the child chooses a level. On all levels, 
numeric problems appear in the lower left-hand comer of the screen. 
Next to this, the seconds remaining to answer a problem are counted 
down, and on the right is the score. Points are determined by the number 
of problems answered correctly and the amount of time it takes to answer 
them. Levels one, two, four, and five are similar; each displays fifteen 
number lines. In those four levels, a colorfully dressed Fay stands at the 
end of the first number line. When the problem appears, she starts tap- 
ping her foot until it's answered. Then she marches to the spot on the 
number line that represents the answer given. If it's correct. Fay will 
jump for joy and an elevator will lift her to the next number line. If the 
answer is wrong, a trap door will open beneath Fay and she'll fall 
through. Fay doesn't like being demoted. She waves her arms in frustra- 
tion and tells whether the answer was too large or small, then shows how 
to do the problem correctly. Levels three and six are more gamelike. 
Three covers both addition and subtraction, and six combines all four 
operations. In both levels, time is vital. A row of random numbers ap- 
pears, the numbers dancing up and down and chasing Fay. Speedy 
answers help her elude her pursuers, but the game ends when they catch 
up. A child can then enter his high score. 

Fay: That Math Woman is a simple but well-executed program. The 
number line is great for tying an abstract equation to the visual level. 
Besides demonstrating problems, it helps kids with the concept of greater 
or less than, and clearly shows that multiplication is the inverse of divi- 
sion. Fay herself is also appealing. She makes you care whether you get 
a problem right or not, because she cares. She'll twirl around in jubila- 
tion if you're right, but watch out when you're wrong. Fay doesn't mess 
around. The program's sound effects are good, too. They reinforce 
learning by ticking off each point on the number line as Fay passes it. 
And the attractive, hardcover package is practically childproof. 

Fay: The Math Woman is a plain, competent math exercise for kids, 
and yet it is more. Equality— what a concept! How sweet it is. (P

The Scaredy-Cat. By Patrick Nidorf. Representing a major step for- 
ward in both artistry and technical execution for Psychological Psoft- 
ware. The Scaredy-Cat attempts to teach youngsters important lessons 
about themselves and their approach to life through a unique format. 

More of an animated children's picture book than a computer game. 
The Scaredy-Cat tells the story of a cat, frightened of its own shadow, 
who slowly learns to overcome his fears through encounters with other 
wild creatures. 

The message is universal — how one faces life, more than any other 
factor, determines its richness. And although the message is aimed at 
children, it is one that nearly everyone can profit from, and it is delivered 
in an easy-to-use format for children. 

Unlike Psychological Psoftware's previous efforts, the black-on- 
white text in Scaredy-Cat is large and easy to read. The pages remain on- 
screen until the space bar is pressed. 

Also, unlike the company's earlier attempts, graphics and animation

are plentiful and remarkable. The Scaredy-Cat is illustrated by fine, 
well integrated digitized artwork. The pictures, primarily of a cat en- 
gaged in various friendly encounters with fish, birds, and insects, typi- 
cally contain lively animation sequences. Youngsters will find them 
fascinating. 

Safeguards such as setting the run-only flag, which runs an Applesoft 
program no matter what command is entered by the user, and auto- 
reboot are also implemented to prevent tiny hands from crashing the 
program. 

Most important. The Scaredy-Cat represents an honest attempt to 
provide some of the younger computer kids with an alternative or at least 
a supplement to the kill-reward instant gratification customarily offered 
in arcade software. 

The Scaredy-Cat probably won't shoot to the top of the bestseller 
lists, but it may be just the thing for parents wishing to help their children 
overcome fears and gain self-confidence. 

The game is certainly a timely and valuable effort from Psychological 
Psoftware. HA'>

Reach for the Stars. By Roger Keating and Ian Trout. This is an in- 
terstellar strategy game . . . but that's like calling the Apple a "nice 
computer": It leaves a good deal out. Think of it this way: If Wizardry is 
a fantasy game and Zaxxon is an arcade game, then Reach for the Stars is 
a strategy game. 

To begin with, it's not just a game; it's a "game system," or a com- 
plete playing environment. You can play this game against up to three 
other people, or the program will play one or more of the others, giving 
you a solitaire mode. The solitaire version is an excellent game in itself, 
and there's even a tutorial mode, in which the program will make sug- 
gestions on how to play. 

The objective of the game is the good old science-fiction classic, the 
Conquest of the Galaxy. You start with one inhabited planet in a universe 
of fifty-four stars, and your task is to develop and industrialize your 
home planet until it can support a colonizing fleet — and then go out and 
colonize! Of course, it isn't all that simple: Developing your home planet 
involves a lot of decisions, and that's nothing compared with the choices 
required in picking a new planet to develop and starting from scratch. 
And don't forget that you have three opponents out there, busily doing 
the same thing: developing their bases and sharpening their claws, get- 
ting ready to land in the middle of your back! 

Like Wizardry, and like most good strategy games, this is a game for 
managers: people who enjoy keeping track of details and "fine-tuning" 
a complex system for smoothest operation. In Reach for the Stars, battles 
are won by the side that brings more and bigger ships to the confronta- 
tion; and that's usually the side that manages its resources better. 

Right, then: Let's assume you know about strategy games. What's 
special about this one? The detail, that's what: the detail and the com- 
plexity. There's a fascinating wealth of possibilities and alternatives, and 
it all fits together into a solidly convincing game universe. 

For example, here are some of the choices you have in developing a 
planet (this is during the production phase of the game, which occurs 
only on odd-numbered mms). You can increase the planet's industrial 
capacity, up to a certain limit; this is essential, since it increases the 
planet's productivity. You can increase the planet's social level, which 
determines whether the population will increase or decline (this also af- 
fects productivity). You can spend money on planetary defense, building 
and maintaining surface installations; and you can build fighting star- 
ships. You can build transports to carry your excess population to other 
stars, and you can spend money on research into more powerful weapons 
systems. Of course, you have only a limited amount to spend. . . . 

The monetary unit, in this game, is called a Resource Point. Each 
planet generates a certain number of them each turn (depending on the 
factors mentioned above, and others), and then you decide how to spend 
them in the next production phase. A fully developed Primary (that is. 
Earthlike) planet can produce several hundred RPs per turn— but that's 
only after a long and expensive process of development. 

And you have to manage more than money or RPs; you have to man- 
age people. You need people to colonize new planets and to develop old 
ones; but a planet can only support so many, and large populations in- 
evitably grow larger. Overpopulation, if left unchecked for a few turns, 
can do more damage to a planet than can enemy attack. 



C<ross i^mes: 
The luiicpie word 
challenge game. 

It offers intellectual stimulation arcade games can't 
match . . . with all the excitement. 

Fast-action fun isn't just for mystery or arcade games any 
more. Cross Clues is a word game that tests more than 
mere reflexes. It's the mind-challenging evolution of the 
crossword puzzle, with beat-the-clock excitement. The 
playing tempo is lively, but you decide how fast you want 
to go. The computer "umpires" while you compete with 
another player for hidden words, coaxing clues from the 
computer. Since a clue helps your opponent too, suspense 
builds till the end, when the best combination of skill, 
intellect, timing and luck wins. 

If you're ready for an even greater challenge, try 
Concentration Crosswords,™ a game that offers 3 levels 
of difficulty and 3 ways to play — for even the most 
demanding word whiz. Again, you compete against the 
clock to uncover hidden words. But once discovered, they 
disappear, to test your memory. Here, a combination of 
word skills, intellect, memory and luck determine the 
winner. 

Both games offer 50 mind-boggling puzzles that appeal 
to young teens through adults. Try them both!

NOVEMBER 1983 



Let's say you've got your home planet pretty well developed; you've 
got a couple of dozen transports in orbit, full of colonists in coldsleep; 
and you've got a handful of level I fighters for escort, with a couple of 
the new level lis: You're ready to go out and conquer a planet. 
Which one? 

You want another Primary, if there's one nearby (your home planet is 
a Primary). They are the easiest to develop: They take less time (and 
fewer people) to become self-supporting. Secondaries are less Earthlike 
and therefore take longer to develop; and Tertiary planets are so bad that 
they can support only a small population at best, which means that 
everything takes even longer, and the population has to be constantly 
replenished by new suckers — er, colonists. 

Then there are the hostile worlds. You can use up a lot of colonists 
terraforming one of these— but some of them have an industrial potential 
that is awesome! 

After a few turns (let's say it's now around turn 18) you have a fully 
developed home planet, putting out fourteen transports and a couple of 
level n fighters during each production phase; and you have a couple of 
struggling young daughter colonies, two Primaries you found nearby (there 
was an exploring phase earlier, but never mind that now). Suddenly, out 
of nowhere, the Crellidae (that's what you told the program to call player 
4, computer, beginner) come roaring into the system of your favorite 
colony! With overwhelming strength, they shoot down the orbital 
defense, plow up the surface bases, and settle in. What do you do now? 

Well, that's what Reach for the Stars is for: It lets you try various 
strategies and observe the results. Then, if you ever find yourself in 
charge of one quadrant of a galaxy at war with itself, you'll know exacdy 
how to proceed. 

In short, the game itself is beautifully designed. More than that, the 
"engineering" of the thing (a stuffy person would say, "software im- 
plementation") is lovely: You can do just about anything you want to 
with the system, from adding various hazards to the game universe to 
stopping a game in the middle and saving it on disk. Of course there's a 
tradeoff for that— the instruction manual contains twelve large pages of 
small print, and even that doesn't explain everything; but nobody ever 
said that moving into a new universe would be easy. 

One warning: In the "load a game from disk" routine, you are told to 
move the arrows in the display (by pressing the arrow keys) to point to 
the game you want and then press "C/R." This does not mean "carriage 
return," as you might expect, but rather control-R (hold the control key 
down, press R, release control). 

And there's one other problem with Reach for the Stars — it's not easy 
to find in this country. It's published in Australia, and the company (at 
press time) doesn't have a distributor in this country. You can order it 
from the publisher or you can nag your favorite software stores until they 
order it for you. IR

Magic Memory. By Craig Jensen. Designed for the computer rookie. 
Magic Memory is a copy -protected program that is used like an ordinary 
tabbed address book. You make entries in sections that are tabbed with a 
letter of the alphabet. The tabs appear on the right edge of the screen and 
you open the address book by moving a cursor to the alphabetical listing 
you wish to see— for example, "A" for Apple, "P" for Peanut. 

The program comes with two sets of twenty-four categories of built- 
in tabs. One set is alphabetical and the other is categorized into personal, 
family, and business sections. Because the program stores its informa- 
tion on data disks, you can design your own sets of tabs. The number of 
sets is limited only by the number of data disks you use. You can cross- 
index files and transfer information in one file to another. 

Each record contains up to nine lines of data. A typical entry might 
include a last and first name in line 1 , a street address in line 2, a city and 
zip code in line 3, and so on. 

Entries can be sorted in any way you like— alphabetically by last 
name or first name, by company, numerically by zip code, by customer 
number, birth date, or even telephone area code. Sorting, however, is 
rigid, and what you format is what you'll get. There is no room for non- 
uniformity such as a misspelled word or a misplaced zip code. And there 
is no wild-card provision, nor a global search. 

Data entry is accomplished by keyboard only. You must type in all 



the data you want filed and caimot assimilate data from other sources 
such as text files or other databases. You cannot, for example, access a 
file generated by Artsci's word processing program Magic Window 
(although for expert programmers there is an appendix that lists a com- 
plicated procedure to convert certain text files for use by Magic Memory). 
You can, however, read information from Magic Memory files into word 
processing or mail-merge programs. 

In addition. Magic Memory has an extensive printing program that 
allows you to print out a standard address book with tabs, mailing labels, 
envelopes, or condensed summaries. The user has full control of page 
formatting, including options on single sheet feeds, perforation mark- 
ings, numbers of copies, and page dimensions. 

As a file handler or database manager. Magic Memory lacks many 
features that are available in less expensive programs. It has, however, 
one large charm— it is simple to use. D(

Oil Barons. By Tom Glass. Oil Barons is a combination board game and 
computer game. The lavishly large, eight-piece hard board consists of 
pieces that lock together ingeniously to form a large, confusing playing 
area. The surface is not a standard map of the continents. Instead, it is di- 
vided into two himdred small squares, each filled with a striking photograph 
of a desert, forest, city, jungle, plain, mountain, or sea. Luckily, some of 
the same terrain stretches together, so the eye can make snatches of sense 
out of the kaleidoscope on the board. Understanding this is definitely an 
acquired skill. There is something quite jarring about fmding a major ci- 
ty in the midst of an arctic ice flow! 

Nine variations of the game may be selected, but the Reality and 
Classic modes are apt to be more popular. And up to eight players may 
play at a time, making this a good choice for family fun. On a typical 
turn, the computer keeps track of auctions, land deals, surveying, drill- 
ing, royalty payments, bank notes, financial statements, balance sheets, 
and depletion notices. News events and special aimouncements are un- 
predictable factors. It's pretty disconcerting to have a promising parcel 
of land suddenly declared a national park or lose an active oil field to a 
hurricane. 

Initially, the computer deals each player four parcels of land and one 
million dollars in operating funds. Later, more land becomes available 
through a computerized auction in which competition is quite fierce. The 
computer generates five additional companies to compete for the drilling 
rights with the players. If the computer wins, the land goes back into the 
unused pUe until a future auction. 

During his turn, a player may survey his own parcel of land. The 
screen shows the cost of drilling in that location and the maximum depth 
that may be drilled. Then, when drilling commences, a hi-res picture of 
an oil derrick appears in the appropriate terrain (though it looks strange 
indeed to see an oil derrick operating on the side of a mountain). The 
screen also shows the ground beneath the surface, so you can watch the 
downward progress of the drill. Sometimes the drill encounters tough 
conditions. At this point, the player must choose either to authorize con- 
tinued drilling at a higher cost or to cease drilling. Gushers are few and 
far between, so careful management of survey and drilling costs must be 
exercised in order to win at Oil Barons. 

In the Reality mode, oU patterns for the entire board are generated 
randomly at the beginning of each game. This way, the likelihood of 
finding oil under a skyscraper is just as possible as in a desert. In the 
Classic mode, the possibility of fmding oil is related to the type of ter- 
rain. In both modes, drilling costs vary substantially, depending on the 
terrain. 

The other modes of the game allow playing parameters to be set to 
different ranges. For those who have mastered the basics of the game, 
the most challenging and exciting of these modes is the Gambling mode. 
Here, the computer scrambles every game parameter, and players must 
discover the rules under which they are playing as the game unfolds. 
Bizarre twists and turns can develop in such an environment, and none of 
the players knows until the end of the game just what determines victory 
in that particular game. 

The game includes a large supply of plastic markers. Flat, colored 
stones are used for property markers, green pawns show active wells 
and blue markers denote dry holes. Yellow, blue, and red barrels mar 
other activity levels. High marks to Epyx for packaging. 

Oil Barons boasts one distinction it shares with only one other game

Buzzard Bait. By Mike Ryebum. The California condors are nesting 
and are turning humans into an endangered species by snatching them to 
feed their chicks. Swoop, grab and the kid in tennis shoes goes down the 
hatch. The chick withdraws with a contented expression, to reappear as a 
vicious fledgling buzzard. 

To combat this avian menace, you have three ships, which appear one 
at a time at the bottom of the screen. They move and fire much like the 
ones in Space Invaders. But there's an added twist. A dangerous penguin 
occasionally flies(!) across the bottom of the screen, and you must acti- 
vate your jets to jump over it. At the higher levels of difficulty, the buz- 
zards not only swoop down at you, they drop unmentionable substances. 
With a maximum of six buzzards on-screen, this makes for a messy 
batdefield. 

An extra ship is provided for every five thousand points. In addition, 
there is a bonus ship round. This phase is a study in Brownian motion. 
You are bouncing around in space trying to retrieve parts of a ship from 
a cloud of bothersome penguins. To complicate things, there is a 
minelayer that runs around making life dangerous for you. 

This game can be used with keyboard, paddles, or joystick. Most 
players will prefer the joystick. The animation is very smooth; the buz- 
zards glide back and forth with uncanny deftness. The detail is very 
sharp. The only problem is minor: The program ignores a fire command 
if there are already two missiles on the screen. This means your guns can 
jam at very inconvenient moments. 

But, taken as a whole. Buzzard Bait is a nice little shoot-'em-up for 
arcade lovers and the friends of James Watt. F)

function keys so useful in word processing. It even has the open and solid 
apple keys to let you play pinball without a joystick. So what's it lack? A 
numeric keypad. 

There are probably quite a few Apple owners who are just as happy 
not to have one. Computers that have built-in keypads have keyboards 
that tend to be either awfully large or awfiiUy cramped. And if you're 
going to cut down somewhere, you might as well eliminate redundancies 
first. After all, the keys found on a keypad also appear on the keyboard. 

Nevertheless, a lot of people use their Apples for heavy-duty number 
crunching, and someone has to enter the numbers. In situations like that, 
the configuration of keys on the traditional adding machine calculator 
allows for much faster entry of numbers and math symbols than a 
typewriter keyboard does. 

The He Tender Keypad by Track House is the latest alternative for 
those who push numbers for a living. It is an attractive, low-profile unit 
that nicely matches the color scheme of the Apple He. Compared with 
the keypad made by Apple, it costs a little more and offers a little more. 

There are two small banks of keys on the keypad. The main bank is 
arranged in a four-by-five array of eighteen keys, with the zero key and 
the enter key (the functional equivalent of return) each the size of two 
regular keys. In addition to the obvious ten digits, four math functions, 
decimal point, and enter, the main pad includes a comma and a delete 
key. To the right of the main pad is a bank of nine keys: a space, four ar- 
rows, and four blank keys. The space key was included with VisiCalc 
users in mind (although the keypad can be installed only on an Apple He, 
there may be quite a few lie owners with the older version of VisiCalc, 
which used the space to toggle the II Plus's two arrow keys between 
horizontal and vertical movement). 

The blank keys are the He Tender's biggest extra. Realizing that no 
engineer could possibly imagine all the possible uses their customers 
would have for the keypad, they made these four keys "user- 
programmable. ' ' Each of them can be independently set to output almost 
any character that appears on the keyboard. 

Actually, if "programmable" means controllable by means of a pro- 
gram, the keys aren't programmable at all. What they are is switch- 
selectable, which isn't as good for a programmer but is probably better 
for a user. Underneath the company logo on the keypad is a set of 
switches. Each key is controlled by four switches. Two of these switches 
combine to tell the keypad which keyboard key is being represented by 
the blank keypad key. The third switch for each key acts as its own per- 
sonal shift key, and the fourth acts as a control key. Any of the main 
keyboard keys (except reset, control, shift, and the apple keys) can be 
duplicated by the keypad's blank keys. 

The He Tender has one other interesting extra. Included in the 
package is a program called Coupler-Calc that simulates a desk 
calculator of the kind found in offices. It can do both floating point and 
accounting fixed point calculations, and it displays the "tape" on the 
computer screen. 

People won't buy the lie Tender Keypad for Coupler-Calc. They'll 
buy it for their spreadsheets, their accounting systems, and their home 
finance programs. But although it may not seem as important as those 
things, it's nice that the keypad can be just a calculator too. DD

Hansel and Gretel and Briar Rose. By Susan Crandall, Thomas Halli- 
day, and Richard Crandall. In contemplating the purchase of either of these 
programs, you should probably ask yourself what benefit you think you 
could impart to your students or children by exposing them to fairy tales 
via computer. For that, as you might suspect, is what these are. If the 
children in question are fascinated by home computers and have displayed 
an indifference to books, you might give these a go. 

The computer versions of "Hansel and Gretel" and "Briar Rose" (also 
called "Sleeping Beauty") feature extremely abbreviated text, as well as 
picmres that in no way threaten the kid lit illustrative supremacy of 
Arthur Rackham or Maurice Sendak (the gingerbread house looks to be

in this to compare with the jarring moment in Hansel and Gretel when 
we are informed that the father tells the children their stepmother has died 
and are shown a picture of a grinning Hansel and Gretel flanking a smil- 
ing woman. Huh? 

The real heart of these programs, and their most interesting aspect, 
is the options menu, which allows you to enter and edit your own text- 
expanding the vocabulary, rewriting the tale, or creating a new one to 
go along with the pictures. The applications in creative writing, or just 
good old down-home computer fiin, are apparent. However, where 
everything else here is painstakingly menu-driven as it is obvious, the op- 
tions mode possesses a level of difficulty equivalent to learning a small 
word processing program. It requires patience, a methodical nature, and 
a zest for the reading of software documentation. 

Both stories incorporate a game of sorts in which you must help H 
and G find their way back home and help the prince get to his sleeping 
beauty respectively. Input is accepted for "right," "left," and a keypress 
for "go back." This scenario is fairly ill conceived in Hansel and Gretel, 
in which you proceed through a woodland scene where "right" and "left" 
have precious litde meaning. The situation is much improved in Briar 
Rose, though it's still a matter of blundering amiably about untU you even- 
tually get there. At any rate, it's an introduction to the graphic adventure 
format that could give a youngster a sense of accomplishment. 

So, if you want a child to experience the full power and magic of these 
tales, as well as the real involvement of reading, you'll still have to get 
them the books. But if they're already immersed in your Apple and you'd 
like them to learn how to read, slipping either of these into the disk drive 
would constitute a likely enough inducement. A(

College Directions. By Julia F. Margolis and Edward T. Gardner III. 
The best part about this program is that it doesn't require the student to 
look at the documentation. In an industry where learning how to use a prod- 
uct usually takes as much time as that spent using it. Systems Design As- 
sociates has come up with a program that runs itself with minimal work 
by the user. 

The objective of College Directions is to help minimize the drudgery 
and tedium of thumbing through directories and reference books to find 
potential colleges for high school students. A thorough program in its 
own way. College Directions is meant to be integrated into a more com- 
plete counseling process by school counselors. 

The program comprises four disks, and two disk drives are required. 
One disk, which contains a data file of thirteen hundred colleges, stays in 
drive 2 while the hapless student must constantly play musical disks with 
the other three, which take turns spinning in drive 1 . 

The program is menu-driven, and its overall structure is represented 
pictorially, making it easier for students to know which section they're in 
and what options they have. 

The first section helps students develop a plan to enter the college of 
their choice. This includes letters of inquiry, acceptance, and refusal, as 
well as budgeting and financial plaiming. The letters section could have 
been omitted, since it is little more than a form letter into which students 
input name, address, and interests. One positive note is that this section 
puts students on the sending end of impersonal, computerized letters for 
once, with the academic institution as recipient. 

A college exploration section contains brief profiles on specific col- 
leges; the information is minimal, so students should be advised to con- 
sult printed sources for details. 

The basis of College Directions' i analysis lies in the section that 
matches students to colleges based on the students' criteria. From a 
multiple-choice display, students can pick the desired community set- 
ting, size, costs, admission standards, financial aid availability, and aca- 
demic curriculums of the schools they want to attend. When all criteria 
have been finalized, the college analysis section pulls out colleges from 
its database, based on the student's specifications. The list of schools can 
be printed for future reference, or, if no printer is available, all output 
goes to the screen. 

College Directions is not meant to be used only by school counselors 
or students. A section devoted to counselors offers suggestions for help- 
ing students get started and for monitoring their progress. A lesson plan 
is also included with exercises and activities designed to give students a 
hand in getting a focus on their academic future. 



Using this program is like swatting flies with a manhole cover; the 
end result is a desirable one, but the means are a bit cumbersome (four 
disks and a 105-page manual). Program execution is not as fast as would 
be expected from such a seemingly uncomplicated program. The pro- 
gram's modules are large, making it impossible to keep them in memory 
simultaneously; the result is frequent disk swapping by the user.

Bermuda Race. By John Biddle and Gordon Mattox. This is that rarity 
among sports simulations, a game of skill, challenge, and excitement de- 
voted to the sport of yachting. Bermuda Race simulates the annual 
635-mile sailing race from Newport, Rhode Island, to Bermuda. Your 
computerized yacht is a high-performance eighty-foot maxi-racer mod- 
eled after the Nirvana, the winner of the record-setting 1982 race. So 
thorough is the feel of Bermuda Race that after a few turns with the game 
you'll be wearing alligator sweaters and calling your best friend chappie! 

Of course, all good sailors have to learn nautical terminology, sailing 
techniques, and navigation. The authors, both experienced yachting 
types who incidentally know their way around an Apple, have thought- 
ftilly included an extensive on-disk sailing and navigational tutorial. 
While the game won't make you a blue water sailor overnight, you'll 
definitely get the feel of sailing and learn all about reefing sails, luff, and 
leech. Should you be a complete novice, Bermuda Race will even teach 
you fore from aft. 

Your boat, an eighty-foot maxiracer, has been accurately modeled to 
perform and sail on your computerized ocean just like the real thing. 
Bermuda Race may be either a one- or two-player game. In the single- 
player version, the player races against the historic record set by the 
yacht Nirvana in the 1982 race. 

In the two-player version, both players start in Narragansett Bay and 
race from Newport to Bermuda. The winner simply crosses the finish 
line first. Well, it's not quite that simple, as any sailor will tell you. 
There's the small matter of setting the proper amount of sail, learning 
how to tack into the wind as it shifts, compensating for wave height, and 
navigating by dead reckoning when your satellite navigation goes out. 
You'll even know the frustration of blowing out your sails in a 
high wind. 

If the quality of the simulation is superb, the graphic display is equal- 
ly first-rate. The race begins with a colorfiil hi-res map of Narragansett 
Sound, Rhode Island— including Block Island, Martha's Vineyard, and 
of course Cuttyhunk— you know, where Muffy and her family summer. 
Your position is plotted continuously as you sail out of the bay. When 
you finally reach the open sea, your chart display changes again to a hi- 
res representation of the Eastern seaboard and your fmal destination, 
Bermuda. The player can alternate chart displays with text screens that 
provide up.-to-the-minute information on the current heading in degrees, 
course to Bermuda, wave height, wind direction, and speed. Another 
screen confirms your current amount of sail and the recommended 
amount you should be carrying for the current sea and wind conditions. 
Don't forget your centerboard— that thingamajig that all the fuss was 
about during the America's Cup. Throughout the race, you'll constandy 
have to raise and lower the centerboard just as you would on the open 
sea. To further add to the realism, you are provided with your own 
navigational aid — a three-piece cardboard device to represent your head- 
ing, wind direction, and luff angle. Hang on to it; you don't want to lose 
it overboard. 

Game play is both challenging and exciting, with the battle against the 
sea every bit as engaging as that against your opponent or the record. 
Just as you've got your course set, the sails rigged, and the centerboard 
up, the wind may pick up and swing you around to the northeast— a 
storm! Better winch down some of the sail, lower the centerboard, and 
change heading. You can almost taste the salt spray and feel the ship 
heave as she comes about. Just as in a real boat on the open sea, the unex- 
pected will happen. Currents can cause you to drift off course, gears 
malfunction, you name it. From the timed start in Newport to the final 
race to the finish line, Bermuda Race is as much fun as you can have this 
side of the yacht club. Now if the New York Yacht Club had only had 
something like this a few months ago. ... WHW

The $64K Question these days is: Are you computer-literate? Of 
course, your answer depends on your knowledge of computers, right? 
Well, not necessarily. As the following test will show, to be truly 
computer-literate, one needs to have a good background in a variety of 
disciplines ranging from aardvarkology to Zen and the art of Popsicle 
maintenance. Truth is, you can never know too much, and after taking 
this test, you won't.

from me to ask you to be un-American. Remember, however, that only

SUPER-MX Roman font is 
the standard. 

Four optional font styles are available 
in addition to the standard Roman font 
that simply plug into the card:

The Super-MX card has all the Apple 
Hi-Res graphic dump commands that 
the Grapplercard has including: double 
dumps (both pages side by side), dump 
from page 1 or 2, double size, empha- 
sized, rotated, strip chart recorder mode, 
and text screen dump. 

The two expansion sockets allow 
E PROM expansion to 12K to insure you 
that the SUPER-MX card will remain the 
most intelligent interface around.

Bill Depew's circle routine, which appeared 
in this space two months ago, opens the door to 
a lot of graphical possibilities on the Apple, not 
the least practical of which is the pie chart. Sof- 
talk did a more complete pie chart program last 
March as part of a series on business graphs; 
this one is intended merely as an introduction to 
the basic elements of a pie chart. 

A pie chart has to start with data in an array. 
Each datum is plotted as a slice of the pie. The 
data is read into the array in lines 100 through 
240. You can enter as many elements of data 
(line 110) as you like, but if you use more than 
ten elements, you will have to dimension the A, 
B, and C arrays to the number of slices or more. 

Once the actual data is read into array A and 
the total is calculated in T, the size of each slice 
in proportion to the whole becomes calculable. 
Subsequent references to the size of a slice refer 
to this ratio. From that, the border of each slice 
is determined and stored in the B array (line 270). 

The center of a slice is calculated by aver- 
aging the values for the leading edge of the slice 
and the leading edge of the slice that comes be- 
fore it. This value is stored in the C array. The 
center calculation is needed for labeling. A line 
is drawn from the center of the slice's outside 
edge to a point outside the circle. This function 
has been incorporated into the circle-drawing 
routine (lines 920 and 930). 

The rest of this month's program is the cir- 
cle routine, modified to include the slice 
borders and label lines. These additional lines 
are an integral part of this section of the pro- 
gram. When the circle-drawing routine reaches 
a slice edge, the border is drawn; when it 
reaches a center, the label line for that slice is 
plotted. 

The labels will have to wait until next 
month. One of the limitations of the hi-res mode 
on the Apple is that it includes no built-in way to 
write text characters. There are several utilities 
to put forty columns of text on the screen and al- 
so several word processors that use that tech- 
nique to get lower case on standard, upper-case- 
only Apple II Pluses. The forty-column utilities 
are widely available — a few have been pub- 
lished in Softalk— but by the time the pie chart 
fills half of the screen, there isn't much room 
for labels that big. 

The solution appeared in the Basic Solution 



a year ago: seventy-column text. By making 
each character four dots wide (including a one- 
dot space between characters) instead of seven 
dots wide, we can fit sufficiently long labels on 
the screen.

Science and technology are two words so 
often uttered in the same breath that they have 
become almost indistinguishable concepts in 
many people's minds. In reality, they present 
separate but intertwined facets of a juggernaut 
that drives us to seek the mastery of nature 
through a more finely articulated understanding 
of it. Both act upon and condition the other in 
ways that contribute to the refinement of each, 
and though dependent to this degree they are 



essentially distinct. 

A breakthrough that occurred just this year 
in mathematics epitomizes a condition common 
among many contemporary scientific disciplines. 
The young German mathematician Gerd Faltings 
succeeded in proving that the number of rational 
solutions to a particular class of polynomial equa- 
tions is finite. Mathematical scientists have at- 
tempted to do this for hundreds of years— and so 
what? 




A modified Apple II Plus motherboard monitors Dr. Allan Brown's sunflower experiment aboard 
Spacelab— marking the first application of a micro on a manned space flight. 



We are apt to dismiss as relatively useless 
much of the scientific research that makes it 
beyond even the funding proposal stage. This is 
because knowledge of this type is useless to us 
in its raw form. Ours are practical concerns. 
Many discoveries generated by today's science 
are initially of value only to an elite community 
ensconced in the rarefied atmosphere of a 
specialized area. But this doesn't lessen the im- 
port of such discoveries, nor does it lessen the 
potential influence they may come to exercise 
upon our day-to-day lives. 

When scientific ideas are applied to the ex- 
ercise of our will upon the natural world, 
technology is bom. Theory transformed into 
practice becomes a corroborative test that, with 
goal-directed repetition, can alter the quality of 
life. 

Science is the realm of theories and their 
testing in the advancement of knowledge for its 
own sake; technology is the application of this 
knowledge to a specific purpose. The prolifera- 
tion of the latter has brought about a constant in- 
terchange today between the edifice of pure 
science and our more pedestrian reality, result- 
ing in profound effects upon both. One area that 
particularly exemplifies this interaction is the 
space program, which has been largely respon- 
sible for the existence of the microcomputer. 

The Scientific Apple. At press time, an Ap- 
ple was slated to travel into space as part of the 
first joint American-European venture, Spacelab, 
scheduled for an October 28 launch. This event 
brings to mind two previous Softalk features that 
spotlight instances of the meeting of science and 
technology . 

In April 1982 readers were introduced to Dr. 
Allan Brown, a plant physiologist at the Univer- 
sity of Pennsylvania who, along with others in 
his field, was seeking answers to questions about 
how plants grow. Brown readily admits that his 
research is not motivated by any forthcoming 
practical application that might result from his 
findings. As a scientist, he is interested in testing 
inconclusive theories with the hope of making a 
contribution to our knowledge of plant behavior. 
Toward this goal he proposed an experiment to 
NASA that would be ideal to conduct in the 
weightlessness of space. 

It seems that a century ago, Charles Darwin 
observed an oscillation phenomenon in plants 
whereby organs that grow by elongation, such

as roots and shoots, do so in a spiral fashion. This 
is called circumnutation. Darwin's seminal work 
speculated on the possibility of some kind of elec- 
trical or chemical influence within the plant to 
explain this growth pattern. Another school of 
thought ascribed this behavior to the influence 
of gravity. Later researchers discovered an essen- 
tial growth hormone in plants called indoleacetic 
acid, also known as auxin. 

Until the late 1930s, scientists erroneously ex- 
plained all kinds of growth behavior in plants on 
the basis of this one hormone. Then, as a result 
of the development of modem biochemistry and 
its pursuant technology, five major classes of hor- 
mones in plants came to be discovered. The 
definite explanation for circumnutation— whether 
it's endogenic or conditioned by gravity- 
remained unresolved. 

The experiment designed by Dr. Brown, 
known by the acronym HEFLEX (Helianthus 
Flight Experiment), takes advantage of the zero 
gravity environment of space to observe how 
plants, in this case sunflowers (Helianthus an- 
nuus), grow under those conditions. These find- 
ings will be compared to data, already gathered 
with a test instrument called a clinostat, on how 
sunflowers grow in a simulated zero gravity en- 
vironment on Earth. In this way, the factors that 
may be causing circumnutation can be isolated 
and the phenomenon understood. 

The variables and apparatus involved in this 
experiment require constant monitoring and 
control. In addition, there remain the special 
circumstances of conducting such an experi- 
ment aboard Spacelab, and these too must be 



considered. Portability and reliability were 
needed in the equipment, and that's where the 
Apple comes in, along with Joe Willson of In- 
teractive Structures who was featured in a Sof- 
talk Exec in June of 1982. 

Interactive Return Visit. A graduate of 
Princeton, Willson earned a doctorate in electrical 
engineering fi-om the University of Pennsylvania. 
Before that, in April 1974, he formed Interac- 
tive Structures with two colleagues from school 
as a vehicle for his consulting activities in the 
areas of business graphics and management in- 
formation systems. By 1977, Willson's attention 
became focused on the emerging generation of 
microprocessors, then still in the hobbyist- 
kit stage of development. He acquired a now leg- 
endary Apple I, which he had up and running just 
in time for the release of another micro that went 
far beyond it— with full-scale applications and 
hardware expansion potential— the Apple II. 

Interactive Structures evolved into a manufac- 
turer of peripheral interface modules for the Ap- 
ple. The company produced hardware and soft- 
ware for various scientific and industrial applica- 
tions. It was the growing reputation of these in- 
terface devices in the laboratory systems market 
that brought Willson's talents to the attention of 
Dr. Brown early in 1979. 

As one member of a team of design engineers 
who were working with Dr. Brown, Willson 
recalls that at that time it seemed a bit gutsy of 
them to propose an experimental apparatus to be 
controlled by an Apple H Plus. "But it was just 
the kind of coiranercially available technology 
NASA was looking for," he says, "low-cost ap- 



plications to demonstrate the practicality of the 
space shuttle program." 

The finished design consists of a custom 
assembled II Plus motherboard, interfaced to 
various sensors and control devices using an 
eight-bit, sixteen-channel, analog-to-digital con- 
verter. This is a true multitasking system, with 
the computer in control of two on-board cen- 
trifuges, six temperature sensors, a heating unit, 
and a time-lapse video camera and recorder. 

The Apple also controls enunciator lights to 
alert the crew of any anomalies in the experiment 
during flight and uses a direct link with the space 
shuttle's on-board computer to relay ongoing data 
about the status of the experiment to mission con- 
trol in Houston. The software to accomplish these 
tasks, designed by Willson, is all in ROM. 

Two payload specialists aboard the shuttie are 
responsible for the physical tasks of planting and 
moving the germinated sunflowers, totaling over 
thirty seedlings, during various stages of the nine- 
day mission. This is only one responsibility they 
share with other crew members in the main- 
tenance of some forty or so scientific experiments 
scheduled for this initial flight of Spacelab. 

Upon Spacelab's return to the earth's surface, 
the video tapes from the flight will be dispatched 
to Dr. Brown's lab for scrutiny. It will take some 
weeks to fully evaluate the findings. The sun- 
flower plants wUl also be returned and kept un- 
der observation for any effects that germination 
in a weightless environment may have upon their 
subsequent growth. 

A second stage of this experiment that will 
test the effects that various increments of hypo-

gravitational force (less than IG) have on plants 
is already being planned for a later mission. A 
further experiment on geotropism, called 
GTHRES, which will test the effect of forces 
greater than IG, is being mounted by Brown in 
conjunction with Norwegian investigator Anders 
Johnsson, who developed the modem biophysical 
theory of circumnutation. Another experiment 
with Welsh scientist David Heathcote, called 
FOTRAN, will test the interactive effects that 
light and various degrees of weightlessness have 
on plant growth. Scheduled to be conducted 
aboard another Spacelab flight in 1986, these in- 
vestigations will rely upon Apple-based systems 
similar to the one that made KEFLEX possible. 



Going back to the issue of pure science and 
its relation to the technology it spawns, it's 
worthwhile to consider what effects research like 
Dr. Brown's may have and how its concomitant 
technology could be used by us. 

Research conducted in the earlier part of this 
century into the behavior of plants and their 
biochemistry has produced many wide-reaching 
applications in agricultural technology. Today's 
multimillion-dollar herbicide industry is a direct 
outgrowth of these scientists' efforts to under- 
stand the effects chemicals have upon plant 
behavior. Another result has been the develop- 
ment of growth-regulating chemicals to control 
the stages in a plant's development. The ability 



to regulate the size of various fruits and 
vegetables is possible because of discoveries 
motivated, like Dr. Brown's, by the pursuit of 
knowledge for its own sake. Brown is hesitant 
to speculate yet on the possible implications his 
studies may have or the possible applications of 
his findings. But it seems certain that any serious 
considerations for the development of an 
agricultural technology in space will find his 
ground-breaking work invaluable. 

Closer to home, the same kind of technology 
that made the sunflower experiment possible is 
available to us for any multitude of applications 
we may dream up using our Apples. Interactive 
Structures markets a whole array of interface 
devices in its modular DAISI product line, in- 
cluding the AI02 eight-bit interface used by Dr. 
Brown on KEFLEX. There is now the AI13 
also— a twelve-bit, sixteen-channel, analog input 
board that takes up one slot in the Apple and has 
sixteen times the accuracy of the AI02. Such a 
device could be used to monitor temperature 
levels continuously in every room in your house 
and regulate the heat accordingly. Another 
device, the DI09 digital interface, provides thirty- 
two different general-purpose logic lines that can 
be used for either input or output of data. 

By this Christmas, Interactive Structures will 
have released two new peripheral products for 
the Apple. One is an upgrade to the popular 
Pkaso printer interface, known as the Pkaso/U. 
Its special feature is that it is compatible with 
any printer— including some that aren't on the 
market yet. It also has the ability to produce 
superhigh-resolution graphics, as well as ex- 
panded screen dumps. 

The other new release is the Shuffle Buffer, 
considered the big brother to the Pipeline parallel 
printer buffer introduced in January of this year. 
The Shuffle Buffer is for serial or parallel 
printers, and it allows you to mix and match serial 
input with parallel output or vice versa, with in- 
dependent baud rate for input and output. In ad- 
dition it features the patented Random Access 
Printing process, which gives you the ability to 
rearrange and combine different types of data, 
such as text and graphics, within the buffer. 

Now employing twice as many people as 
when Softalk's Exec article on the company ap- 
jjeared. Interactive Structures president Joe 
WiUson and his wife Michelle, director of opera- 
tions, agree that priority number one is making 
sure that the technology they develop and market 
is well supported. To this end the engineers and 
designers of their products seem more than will- 
ing to make themselves available if users have 
a need to consult with them. The company also 
publishes a bimonthly user newsletter, "Tips and 
Techniques," which discusses the company's full 
product line and spotlights various devices in 
depth from time to time. 

As we strive to transcend the flood of tech- 
nology that science makes possible, we discover 
there are creative ways to integrate both forces 
into our lives in a meaningful way. It may take 
a glance at newspaper headlines heralding the 
latest triumph in space exploration or just a long 
look at the stars to remind us that science at its 
highest level is ultimately the systematic pursuit 
and enjoyment of the wondrous, the awesome, 
and the mysterious. JM 




With plans to unveil two new interface peripherals in its product line this fall, Interactive Structures's 
managennent includes, counterclockwise from top, company president Joe Willson, his wife and 
director of operations Michelle Kindt, and Kenn Kidd, sales manager.

Jungle Fever, Part 9 



We began our study of Apple Pascal's UNIT facility last month by 
examining and experimenting with regular UNITs. If you aren't able to 
refer to that discussion, you can compensate by reading chapter 5 of the 
Apple Pascal Language Reference Manual, as well as the section on pro- 
gram segmentation in the manual's addendum. 

Incidentally, apologies are certainly due if you own an Apple n and 
faithfully tried to compile last month's demonstration UNITs. You were 
no doubt surprised and annoyed when the compiler refused to obey your 
wishes and instead complained of error condition #408: (*$S + *) needed 
to compile units. 

To compile any UNIT under Apple H Pascal, you must invoke com- 
piler swapping by inserting one of the compiler directives (*$S + *) or 
(*$S-I- +*) somewhere before the first UNIT heading in each file con- 
taining UNIT source text. This is necessary because the Apple II simply 
doesn't have enough primary memory to compile UNITs unless the com- 
piler's memory usage is optimized through the segment-swapping 
mechanism that is activated by the $S compiler directive instruction. 

The examples presented last month lacked the crucial compiler direc- 
tive because they were developed and tested on an Apple III computer, 
which boasts so much primary memory that compiler swapping is almost 
always unnecessary. Except for this slight (but important) omission, the 
UNITs were written so that they would compile without modification on 
either the Apple II or III. Please note that, in the absence of explicit 
labeling to the contrary, any demonstration software presented in this col- 
umn should compile and execute without modification under Apple 
Pascal for the n Plus, He, and m. 

UNTTed We Stand. We have seen how easy it is to collect several 
useful subroutines (along with any relevant data declarations) into a 
UNIT. By doing so, you can effectively extend the definition of Apple 
Pascal on your computer to include subroutines, constants, variables, 
and data types of your own custom design. When client software USES a 
UNIT, the public objects defined within the UNIT (that is, the objects 
declared in the INTERFACE section) become available for use within 
the client's own subroutines and main body, even though they are not ac- 
tually defined by the client itself. In a similar vein, your programs 
needn't bother to define such predeclared objects as Maxint, Boolean, 
WriteLn, Chr, or MemAvail, because they are provided free by the 
Pascal language and compDer. 

Of course, nothing in Apple Pascal is ever provided completely free 
of charge. In order to make the standard predeclared objects available to 
you, the Pascal compUer must consume more primary memory and ex- 
ecute a bit more slowly than it would if it were less hospitable. Even 
more memory and execution time would be lost if the compiler were 
sophisticated enough to merge UNIT code directly into the client soft- 
ware that uses it. Unfortunately, the extra memory required for this 
process is not available in most small computers (including the Apple II 
witii language card and the He with 64K of RAM). Thus, you must use 
a separate utility program, the linker, in order to put all the pieces 
together into a single, executable code file. We saw an example of this 
process last month and at once apprehended the irony of the situation. It 
seemed rather strange that one must add another cumbersome step to the 
software development process in order to take advantage of one of Apple 



Pascal's most loudly touted "labor-saving" features! 

Luckily, our dismay was anticipated by the designers of Apple 
Pascal, who created the INTRINSIC UNIT in a largely successful at- 
tempt at making UNITs more convenient. By adding a single line of 
source code, we can change the UNIT developed last month, CharTools, 
into an INTRINSIC UNIT. 

This month's listing was produced by the Apple HI compiler for the 
INTRINSIC version of CharTools. Actually, two lines of source were 
added to this UNIT; the first of these (and also the first line in the listing) 
is the compiler-swapping directive that was absent in last month's ver- 
sion of CharTools. It is the addition of line 3, however, that transforms 
the package into an INTRINSIC UNIT. To verify the syntax of this line 
of code, refer to figure 1, which reprints last month's set of UNIT 
railroad diagrams. 

Syntax charts, of course, confirm only that a particular sequence of 
source code is indeed "proper Pascal"; they never explain what the code 
actually means\ The purpose of the keyword INTRINSIC seems clear 
enough, but what of the keyword CODE and the Integer constant 24? 

To begin, INTRINSIC UNITs need never be linked into their client 
programs. Instead, these special UNITs reside in the special code file. 
System. Library. When a client program is executed, the operating 
system first loads the client code into primary memory. Then it looks in- 
to System. Library to find the code for any INTRINSIC UNITs that are 
used by the client. This code is then automatically loaded into primary 
memory, alongside that of the client. In effect, the operating system 
handles all the work of identifying and locating all the parts of a program 
at execution time. More important, it combines them, automatically and 
instantaneously, into a coherent, executable whole. Much the same task 
is performed by the linker. But, for reasons that will be explored soon, it 
is a bit easier to stitch together INTRINSICs and their clients than to 
blend regular UNITs with theirs. 

The Shocking Truth Revealed. As it happens, any UNIT (whether 
regular or INTRINSIC) is actually a SEGMENT PROCEDURE in 
disguise. To illustrate, a UNIT'S initialization code is placed in the SEG- 
MENT'S main body; if the programmer omits the initialization portion of 
a UNIT, then the main body of the corresponding SEGMENT is left 
empty by the compiler. Subroutines that are defined by a UNIT are seen 
by the compiler as being nested within the analogous SEGMENT PRO- 
CEDURE. True, SEGMENT subroutines are frequently swapped into 
and out of primary memory during program execution, while UNITs are 
normally unmolested by the segment-swapping mechanism. On the other 
hand, a certain compiler directive instruction, which we'll study in com- 
ing months, can make a UNIT swap just like the SEGMENT it truly is. 

If you think about the subject long enough and study a few program 
listings (as produced by the compiler), you should be able to discover 
many telltale similarities between UNITs and SEGMENTS. They are, in 
fact, two sides of the very same coin. 

When we discussed SEGMENT PROCEDURES last September, we 
noted that each segment in a program was known to the Pascal system 
(including the compiler and p-machine) by its individual segment 
number. This applies to UNITs as well. Suppose that your program calls 
the function Capital from the UNIT named CharTools. The Pascal com-

piler translates the call into a series of p-codes that force the p-machine to 
shift attention to the CharTools code segment, then to select and execute 
the appropriate subroutine within that segment. 

At the level of p-code and the p-machine, both segments and 
subroutines are identified by their respective individual numbers in order 
to speed execution. These numbers are nothing more than indexes into 
two arrays, the procedure dictionary and the segment table. 

Look It Up! Every code segment includes a procedure dictionary. 
This is an array of subroutine addresses that may be indexed by Integers 
ranging from 1 to 149. In other words, each segment may define up to 
149 subroutines! Each array element in the procedure dictionary is an In- 
teger that represents the address in primary memory of the first p-code of 
the corresponding subroutine. For example, array element 3 stores the 
location of subroutine 3's starting point. When a "call subroutine 3" p- 
code is executed, the p-machine fetches the third element from the pro- 
cedure dictionary of the currently active code segment, then begins ex- 
ecuting p-codes at the location specified by that number. 

WhUe we're on the subject, the advanced reader should note that ab- 
solute memory addresses are never stored in the procedure dictionary; 
rather, each address is relative to the location of the particular segment in 
question. This relative addressing enables the system to load a segment 
into any unused area of primary memory. Without such flexibility, the 
system could not allow segments to be swapped in and out as freely as 
they now can be. 

Playing the Slots. Just as each segment has its own procedure dic- 
tionary, each code file includes its own segment dictionary. The segment 
dictionary is an array, indexed from 0 to 15. Each element in the array 
contains several pieces of information, including the name of the corre- 
sponding segment as well as its official segment number, size (given in 
bytes), and location on disk relative to the start of the code file. An ap- 
pendage to the segment dictionary, included primarily for the benefit of 
code files that contain UNIT clients, contains a table that gives the seg- 
ment numbers of any INTRINSIC UNITs that are used by any client 
code that resides in the file. No segment dictionary entries need be used 
to describe these INTRINSIC UNITs, because code and segment dic- 
tionary information for them are stored in the System. Library file. 

In the days when Apple Pascal was not as well documented as it is 
now, people used to believe that segment dictionary indexes— usually 
called slot numbers— conesponded to segment numbers. For instance, 
people thought that the segment described by segment dictionary entry 5 
always had to be segment 5. In general, there is no connection between 
slot numbers and segment numbers. Thus, the information in segment 
dictionary slot 1 may in fact describe segment number 24. The segment 
dictionary is simply a collection of handy storage boxes for important in- 
formation about the segments in a particular code file. Slot numbers are 
nothing more than labels that facilitate the access of that information. 
They have no other significance. 

Tabula Rasa. When a program is executed, certain information in its 
segment dictionary is copied into the system's segment table (called the 
"run-time segment table" in Apple's manuals). The indexes of this array 
are segment numbers and range from 0 to 31. For instance, information 
about segment 5 is stored in segment table entrj' 5, information for seg- 
ment 8 is stored in table entry 8, and so on. 

Each entry in the segment table includes information that indicates 
whether the corresponding segment is currently resident in primary 
memory and, if so, its address. At execution time, some or all of a pro- 
gram's segments are loaded into primary memory, and information 
describing all of its segments is transferred from the code file's segment 
dictionary on disk to the system's segment table in primary memory. 
Remember, segment dictionary slot numbers are not the same as segment 
table segment numbers. Consequently, if the information in dictionary 
slot 1 described segment 24, it would be assigned to segment table 
entry 24. 

The Numbers Racket. Whenever any segment is compiled, the com- 
piler gives it a segment number. If the segment was declared as a true 
SEGMENT subroutine in the text of some program, then the number it 
received from the compiler would become its permanent segment 
number. If the segment was declared as a regular UNIT, however, the 
number it received from the compiler would be irrelevant. When it is 
linked into a client, the regular UNIT is given a different segment num- 
ber, one that was allocated to it by the compiler during compilation of the 
client. Thus, MyUnit might acquire segment 7 on behalf of one client

and segment 8 when linked to another. The exact numeric assignments 
would depend upon the order of UNIT declarations within the respective 
clients. For example, consider the following portions of two client 
programs: 

PROGRAM 
FirstClient; 
USES 

(*$U MYUNIT.CODE') MyUnit; 
BEGIN (* FirstClient *) 
END (* FirstClient *). 

PROGRAM 
SecondClient; 
USES 

(*$U NEWUNIT.CODE*) NewUnit, 

(*$U MYUNIT.CODE*) MyUnit; 
BEGIN (* SecondClient *) 
END (* SecondClient *). 

MyUnit is a regular UNIT that resides in the file Myunit.code. When 
MyUnit is linked to FirstClient, it will be assigned segment 7, because it 
was the first UNIT declared by the client and thus the first additional 
segment allocated by the compiler. On the other hand, MyUnit is as- 
signed segment 8 when linked to SecondClient. In this case, NewUnit 
was declared first, so it will receive segment number 7. Notice that we 
have never mentioned the original segment numbers of either UNIT; 
they do not matter. 

Linking: A Partial Rationale. Linking— that is, the process of merg- 
ing regular UNIT code with client code — involves primarily the transfor- 
mation of UNIT code so that it reflects the UNIT's new client-assigned 
segment number. The very existence of the INTRINSIC UNIT facility 
demonstrates that the operating system can merge code automatically 
under certain circumstances, so if the compiler could allocate permanent 
segment numbers to UNITs during compilation, you might think there 
would be little need for a separate, manual linking process at all. But 
think of the difficulties the compiler would have in trying to decide how 
to allocate segment numbers. 

Consider that no two UNITs that are used by the same program can 
have the same segment number, since there is room in each segment 
table entry to describe only a single segment (either a SEGMENT sub- 
routine or a UNIT). Certainly, a program should be free to use any com- 
bination of UNITs, so our hypothetical compiler would never be justified 
in assigning a given segment number to more than one UNIT. 
Theoretically, this policy would limit the maximum number of UNITs 
that you could write to the number of entries in the segment table: thirty- 
two. For reasons that will be explained soon, the practical limit on the 
number of UNITs would be even less. 

The somewhat inconvenient linking stage is thus necessary to allow 
the creation of an arbitrary number of regular UNITs without risking 
segment number conflicts. You might argue, however, that linking 
should be an automatic function of the operating system and that it should 
be invoked without human intervention whenever the operating system is 
asked to execute an unlinked program. A very simple mechanism for do- 
ing just that does indeed exist in Apple Pascal, and it is intimately tied in- 
to the "workfile" feature. Unfortunately, Apple Pascal's workfile facili- 
ty permits the development only of small, "toy" programs, so it is not 
worth covering here. 

INTRINSIC Numbering: Your Responsibility. Even though it is 
unwise for the compiler to assign permanent segment numbers to every 
UNIT, the technique is still attractive because it eliminates the need for 
linking. As a matter of fact, INTRINSIC UNITs do receive permanent 
segment numbers from the compiler. This is possible because the com- 
piler leaves it up to you to resolve any segment number conflicts. With 
the CODE keyword, you specify the segment number for a particular IN- 
TRINSIC UNIT. If you err in choosing, that's your problem. 

For some INTRINSIC UNITs— speciflcally, those that declare global 
data in their IMPLEMENTATION (private) sections— you need to 
declare not only a CODE segment number but also a DATA segment 
number. We will work with examples of such dual-segment UNITs in 
months ahead. 

Certain segment numbers should not be given to INTRINSIC UNITs. 
Segment table entries 0 and 2 through 6 are dedicated to portions of the

Pascal system itself. (In particular, segment 0 is the operating sys- 
tem core, about which we've hinted in previous discussions.) Table entry 
1 is reserved for the main segment of your program. Certain numbers in 
the range 20 to 3 1 correspond to INTRINSIC UNITs provided by Apple 
in the System. Library, and these numbers (which will be listed momen- 
tarily) should never be assigned to your own UNITs. 

Every UNIT Needs a Home. In order to make it easier for the com- 
piler to find INTRINSIC UNITs when compiling clients, and for the 
operating system to load INTRINSIC UNIT code into primary memory 
at execution time, all INTRINSICs must be contained within the 
System. Library file. This is a code file like those produced by the com- 
piler or linker, except that its file name does not include the customary 
.code suffix. Being a code file, it contains a segment dictionary that can 
accommodate up to fifteen entries. The standard Apple Pascal 
System. Library already contains several INTRINSIC UNITs, which 
together consume seven of the file's segment dictionary entries. This 
means that System. Library may contain up to nine of your own UNITs 
(less, if some of them require both CODE and DATA segments). 

System. Library will accommodate regular UNITs as easily as IN- 
TRINSICs. If you put regular UNITs in the System. Library, you need 
not tell the compiler where to look for them when compiling clients; in 
the absence of any $U compiler directive instructions to the contrary, the 
compiler will look for any and all UNITs in System. Library. However, 
since you have the opdon of leaving regular UNITs in ordinary code 
files, but must put all INTRINSICs in the System. Library, it is usually 
wise to reserve System. Library for INTRINSIC UNITs only. 

If your System. Library becomes too crowded, you are certainly free 
to replace some of Apple's UNITs with your own. But this is a risky 
business, since some of Apple's packages— notably Pascalio, Longintio, 
and Transcend— are tied to fundamental language capabilities and system 
operation. On the other hand, UNITs such as Turtlegraphics and Apple- 
stuff are not critical and may be removed from the file if you do not in- 
tend to call upon them in your own programs. 

Installing the INTRINSIC UNIT. Since all INTRINSIC UNITs 



must reside within the System. Library file, you must learn how to install 
a UNIT into that file. Apple Pascal provides the Library utility program 
to aid you in this pursuit. This program is stored on the Apple3: disk in 
the file Library. code. Although the Apple3: disk must be mounted 
before you can execute Library, it may be removed as soon as the pro- 
gram has been loaded into primary memory and begins execution. 

The Library program allows you to build a library code file by canni- 
balizing segments from other code files. You browse through one or 
more code files, called link code files, transferring the segments of your 
choice to a new library, called the output code file. (The Apple HI ver- 
sion of the Library program calls these the input file and the output file 
respectively. In this discussion, we will employ the somewhat more 
obscure but nevertheless more commonly used Apple EI terminology.) 

While you are building the library, the output code file is temporary; 
if, when you are finished shuffling segments around, you decide that you 
don't like the new library, you can abort the process. If you do not ex- 
plicitly abort the Library program, the library file under construction 
will be made permanent. If the new file has the same name as an existing 
file, the old will be erased to make way for the new. Conversely, the old 
file will be retained and the new one forgotten if you elect to abort the 
program. 

Let's use Library to install CharTools in the System. Library. When 
you execute Library. code, the first thing the program will request from 
you is the name of the output code file. Next, you will be asked for the 
name of the (initial) link code file. To either or both of these requests, 
you may respond with either an asterisk or a complete file name, in- 
cluding the .code suffix if you intend the name to have one. (The Library 
program does not supply default file name suffixes, so be careful!) 

Whenever your response to a Library program file name request is 
only an asterisk, the program translates this to *System. Library. In other 
words, by replying with an asterisk you sjjecify the standard library file 
on the boot disk. In this example situation, you should use only the 
asterisks, since we are concerned with amending the System. Li- 
brary file.

Figure 2 shows the screen display you should see as soon as you have 
named both the output and link code files. Dominating the display is a list 
of the entries in the link code file's segment dictionary. Notice that all 
segment (that is, UNIT) names have been truncated to eight characters. 
For example, Turtlegraphics has become Turtlegr and Applestuff has 
been shortened to Applestu. We said long ago that the compiler truncates 
identifiers to eight characters; now that we can look "within" a code 
file, the results of this process are strikingly obvious. 

As you examine the segment dictionary display of figure 2, note the 
lack of correspondence between slot numbers and segment numbers. For 
instance, Chainstuff occupies slot 2 but has been assigned to segment

number 28. Consequently, segment information for Chainstuff will 
always be placed in segment table entry 28. 

In order to add a segment to a library, you must first transfer all of the 
segments from the current copy of the library to the tem]X)rary one that is 
under construction. (Yes, it is cumbersome, but that's the way the 
system was designed, so we must live with it for now.) To effect a mass 
transfer of all segments from the link code file to the output code file, 
strike the equal sign. Note that this key is listed as one of the choices in 
the menu line at the top of the screen. (We'll deal with some other menu 
commands soon.) 

Soon after you press the equal key, your display screen should resem- 
ble figure 3. Now that the output code file contains something, its 
reported length is much larger than it was at first, and its segment dic- 
tionary is displayed at the bottom of the screen. At this point, of course, 
the segment dictionaries of both the link code file and the output code file 
contain the same information. 

To address CharTools, press the N key (another command listed in 
the menu line). This indicates that you wish to switch to a new link code 
file. As soon as you specify Chartools.code, your screen should look like 
figure 4. The display of the link code file's segment dictionary should 
become that of Chartools.code, while the display of the output code file's 
dictionary should remain static. Note that, even though CharTools oc- 
cupies segment dictionary slot 1 , it has been assigned the segment 24, as 
specified in the INTRINSIC UNIT declaration. 

To copy CharTools into the output code file, you must indicate the 
number of the segment dictionary slot that it occupies in the link code 
file, then give the number of an empty destination slot in the output code 
file. (If you specify an occupied slot as the destination, the Library 
program will confirm that you really mean to eliminate the current 
occupant.) 

Let's put CharTools in slot 7. Enter 1, the number of the slot to be 
copied. Then press the space bar (or return). Next, press Zand the space 



LOCK-IT-UP 

DISKETTE COPY-PROTECTION 
AND DUPLICATION SYSTEMS 
FOR THE APPLE COMPUTER 

The Lock-lt-Up systems are sophisticated, menu driven 
copy-protection and duplication utilities for the Apple II 
Computer. They feature several levels of protection which 
make standard diskettes uncopyable by even the most 
sophisticated nibble copy programs currently available. 

• All sectors on the diskette can still be used. 

• Data files can be loaded and/or saved to either the protected diskette 
or an unprotected diskette. 

• Memory will be cleared and the disk will reboot if the reset key is 
pushed. 

• The copying systems support up to 14 disk drives. 

• Complete data-verification is optional during copy. 

• Sequential serial numbers are assigned to each diskette produced by 
the system 

• Master diskettes created with the system contain an I.D. stamp that 
you select. The I.D. stamp must be correctly specified before any 
diskettes can be duplicated. This prevents other Lock-lt-Up owners 
from copying your diskettes. 

• Extensive support is provided should you have any problems or 
special needs. 

• Our system is supported by numerous disk copying services should 
you need a large quantity of diskettes duplicated. 

Either system is available for $225, which includes three diskettes, an 
informative manual, and a non-exclusive license to copy as many 
diskettes as needed.

The top portion of the display shows contents of the original library, while the 
new bottom portion reflects the contents of the library under construction— 
that is, the OUTPUT CODE FILE. 



bar (or return). Now, your screen should resemble figure 5. CharTools 
has been copied from slot 1 in its original code file to slot 7 in the new 
library file. 

At this point, you may elect to press the A (Abort) key, which will 
end the library construction process and leave the original 
♦System. Library untouched. You should press Q (Quit) instead, 
however, so that the new, expanded version of *System. Library will re- 
place the old. Before going ahead with the Q command, the Library pro- 
gram will ask you for a "Notice" and then wait for you to respwnd with 
a line of arbitrary text. Software developers may wish to respond with a 
legal copyright notice. The text is then embedded within the new library 
code file. The average amateur programmer cares little for copyright and 
thus usually responds to the "Notice" prompt with a simple tap of the 
return key. For purposes of this example, you should do likewise. 

CharTools is now part of your own System. Library. This means that

"CHARTOOL" instead of "CHARTOOLS," since the original identifier was

Figure 5. Library program screen display after UNIT CHARTOOLS was 
moved from slot 1 in the LINK CODE FILE to slot 7 of the OUTPUT CODE 
FILE. Note that changing CHARTOOLS's slot assignment in moving it to a 
new file does not affect the segment assignment (in parentheses). The newly 
constructed library file now occupies thirty-eight disk blocks. 



each of the two kinds of UNITs requires you to learn and use a cumber- 
some utility program. But the linker must be used to produce an ex- 
ecutable code file every time the client of a regular UNIT is compiled (or 
recompiled). In contrast, Library is used only rarely, when installing a 
UNIT (or other code segment) in the System. Library (or other library 
file). A library UNIT never has to be reinstalled unless the programmer 
desires to change or update it. Modifications to client programs never re- 
quire the reinstallation of library code. 

For programmers who are not afraid to handle their own segment 
number allocation, then, INTRINSIC UNITs can indeed be more con- 
venient to use, overall, than regular ones. Those programmers who do 
not write their own UNITs, but instead write client software that uses 
UNITs produced by others, will find INTRINSICs much easier to use 
than regular UNITs, since no linking step is necessary. 

A Present in Your Future. Go away for a month and experiment 
with UNITs, both regular and INTRINSIC. Certainly you should try 
writing, linking, and installing your own. Also, if you're the adventur- 
ous sort (and what are you doing here if you're not?), you might try us- 
ing some of the INTRINSIC UNITs that Apple provides in the standard 
System. Library, particularly those that permit access to the Apple's 
graphic and musical capabilities. You'll find that these UNITs are 
described well in the official manuals. While you're having fun, keep 
this question in the back of your mind: 

Suppose that you make your living by developing software for the 
mass market. In a frenzy of inspiration and activity, you create CEO 
(Chief Executive Officer), the world's most comprehensive, well- 
integrated business software system. You expect sales volume to reach 
the millions, or at least the hundreds of thousands. CEO depends upon a 
marvelous package of subroutines, Whizunit, which you also intend to 
use in other software products. Should Whizunit be a regular UNIT or an 
INTRINSIC one? Next time, we'll explore the issues involved in 
deciding which type of UNIT is best in a particular situation. You'll also 
receive a year-end present in the form of a UNIT that implements a new 



Why Your Apple Needs DAVID-DOS 



TM 



Your Apple is easier to use and runs much faster with 
this new, licensed by Apple, DOS 3.3 update. 



DaVID-DOS (rhymes with moss), is rated AA, 
(top of its class), by the highly respected software 
review magazine PEELINGS IL 
Novices and Pros 

DAVID-DOS is licensed by programmers for in- 
clusion in the software they sell. 30 out of 60 
bought it on the spot when DAVID-DOS wcis 
demonstrated at the Original Apple Corps, UCLA. 
DAVID-DOS receives applause from Apple 
novices. That's why you need DAVID- DOS. 

Whaf s Going On 

Every Apple Il/IIe boots up with DOS 3.3 soft- 
ware.* DOS 3.3 is right there on the first three 
tracks of all your program disks. Your Apple is 
supervised constantly by DOS 3.3. 

Easier and 5 Times Faster 

Our Installation Program goes in and makes spe- 
cific permanant improvements to DOS 3.3 on all 
your disks in a few seconds. (The programs on 
your disks are not touched). From then on your 
programs load up to 5 times faster. And you have 
new features that make your Apple easier to use. 

■* Exceptions are Pascal & CPM Operating Systems.

2. TLIST lists all Random/Sequential Text Files. 

3. DUMP Binary/Ascii to screen or printer. 

4. DISA dissembles Binary to screen/printer. 

5. AL prints program Address & Length. 

6. / Single keystroke, second Catalog command. 

7. HIDOS moves DOS to the Language Card. 

8. FIND hex group in 64K memory in 3 seconds. 

9. DATE prints out. Use with Mtn. clock card. 
Commands 8 & 9 in Hidos only. 



10K More IMemory 

These nine commands operate identical to exist- 
ing DOS commands. Use A or AS for address 
and L or L$ for length. Enter new commands on 
the Keyboard and use them in Basic programs with 
the familiar D$. Use HIDOS in Hello program 
for turnkey startup, adding I OK free memory. 

Variable Speed Scrolling 

TLIST, DUMP, and DISA Features are: 

1. Print with PR#. 

2. Key operated variable speed control. 

3. Instant pause with Space Bar. 

4. Exit anytime with Return Key. 

Compatible 

All DOS entry addresses have been preserved. 
DOS is Same length and compatible with most 
software. David- Dos is copyableand creates fuUv 
copyable updated disks. Init areas were used for 
David-Dos. Works with all Apple lis including 
He 80 Col. Requires 48 K. Complete documen- 
tation for screen or printing and many utilities 
are on the disk.

Ateacher 
for the Apple 

Meet Lee McFadden. your personaJ guide to 
the Apple //e. Softalk Magazine has 
praised Lee's audio cassette tapes as "a 
superior way to learn about an Apple." And 
Apple itself chose them to train its own 
field sales reps. 

The reason? FlipT rack's carefully 
sequenced cassette lessons let you learn in 
the most natural way possible — by sitting 
down with a knowledgeable friend. Even if 
you have never touched a computer, in just 
3 step-by-step sessions you will learn to: 

• Use each special key and essential 

command 

• Load and run programs 

• Save programs and data 

• Copy programs and diskettes 

• Protect and modify programs 

• And much more! 

In short, you will be able to use existing 
programs with confidence, as you enter 
your own data, organize your files and 
understand the principles of what you and 
your computer can do. If you later decide to 
take up programming, you'll have the solid 
background necessary. 

A Proven Teaching Approach 

With interactive FlipT rack cassettes, you 
learn by doing. No reading required. You 
learn at your own convenience, at your own 
pace, on your own computer — like having a 
personal tutor "talk you through " each 
procedure. 

You work directly with Apple's own 3.3 
System Master and Sample Programs 
diskettes, trying the commands and 
programs you want to master, and seeing 
the results. No secondhand simulations. 

Best of all, the patented FlipT rack format 
of the tapes lets you choose the subjects 
that interest you, covering as much or as

Pilins Made Easy 



by Christopher U. Lisht 



As we saw last month, text files are the Apple's way of storing and 
retrieving data on floppy disks. They are the information files that con- 
tain address lists, telephone numbers, numerical data points for scientific 
studies, and the words for this article. 

Both kinds of text files, sequential and random access, are created, 
altered, saved, and loaded only from programs, usually Basic programs. 
They cannot, unfortunately, be written or read directly from the 
keyboard. Therefore it is essential that a user take the point of view of a 
Basic program when approaching text files. Always keep in mind that in- 
put refers to data being transferred from a text file into the computer's 
memory, while output refers to data being transferred from the computer 
out to the file on disk. 

Open Season on Text Files. Four commands are common to all text 
files, and all four must be followed by the name of the file they refer to. 
The command open filename checks the disk to see if a file with the 
specified name exists. If not, it creates the file on the disk and reserves a 
595-byte buffer in the Apple's memory. The buffer is used for temporary 
data storage of input and output for that file. Write filename prepares 
DOS to accept the next print commands as an order to send data to the 
disk instead of the screen. Read filename tells DOS to treat the next set of 
input commands as instructions to get data from the disk file with that 



name rather than from the keyboard. And close filename saves on the 
disk whatever is still in its buffer and then releases the buffer memory 
back to Applesoft's control. 

As with all DOS commands issued by a Basic program, text file com- 
mands must be issued as print commands to bypass Applesoft and contact 
DOS directly. A program that will use several DOS commands should 
contain the command D$ = CHR$(4), which defines the string variable 
D$ as control-D, the signal to get DOS's attention. Thereafter, the state- 
ment print D$; ' 'command ' ' will treat anything within the quotation 
marks as a DOS command. 

Random Access Files. Of the two types of text files, random access 
files are simpler to use than sequential ones, although they require a bit 
more care. They're designed for mailing lists and similar applications 
where it's necessary to find and make changes in one part of the file 
without disturbing the other parts. Random access files are subdivided 
into records, all of which must be the same length, and these records are 
further subdivided into fields, whose length can vary. Think of the file 
itself as an expandable file folder and the records as sheets of paper in the 
folder. You can add and subtract pieces of paper, but each sheet must be 
the same size as all the others. Fields, then, are like words written on the 
pieces of paper. The lengths of the words themselves can vary, and there 



218 



NOVEMBER 1983 



is no specific limit to the number of words. However, when the total 
number of characters fills the metaphorical page, then the record is full. 
Just as a page can be blank, a record can exist but be empty. If DOS is 
searching a file and finds an empty record or field, it will assume it's 
reached the end and will stop with an end of data error message, even 
though there may be valid records beyond that one. Therefore it's best 
not to leave an empty record in the file. 

Only the four text file commands we talked about last month are 
needed to use random access files, but the commands have to be followed 
by parameters that modify them. In fact, if the parameters are omitted, 
DOS assumes that the commands refer to sequential files rather than ran- 
dom access ones. A parameter following the open command is used to 
specify the length of each record in a random access file. The statement 
takes the form open filename, LlOO, where L indicates the length 
parameter and the length is one hundred bytes. The maximum record 
length permitted is a very generous 32,767 byes. Because it's essential 
for you to remember the length of the records in a file, and because DOS 
3.3 doesn't contain any way to read the record length of a file, it's a good 
idea to include the number of bytes in the fde name. Each character sent 
to a text file, including spaces and returns, requires one byte. Unused 
bytes at the end of a record will be part of that record but will re- 
main blank. 

Read and write work with random access files in much the same way 
they work with sequential files. They still act to instruct input and print 
to operate on a disk file instead of the keyboard and the monitor. With 
random access files, however, you can instruct read and write to work 
with a specific record using the record parameter. Such a command takes 
the form write filename, RIO, which tells print to send data to the tenth 
record in the specified file. The command close filename requires no 
parameters. Let's see how these commands and parameters work 
together by creating a rudimentary phone list. Type new and then enter 
the following program. Save it under the name Write. phonefile. 35. We 
will assume that no record will require more than thirty-five bytes, so 
we'll use thirty-five as the record length and include it in the name of the 
text file. That way we'll always know how long the records are. 

3 NAME$(1) = "ADAMS J. 123-1776" 

5 NAME$(2) = "AIRLINE 1 -800- BZZ- BUSY" 

7 NAME$(3) = "MILLER G, PA 6-5000" 

10 D$ = CHR$(4) 

20 PRINT D$; "MONICO" 

30 PRINT D$; "OPEN PHONEFILE.35,L35" 

40 PRINT D$i "WRITE PHONEFILE.35,R1 " 

50 PRINT NAME$(1) 

60 PRINT D$; "WRITE PHONEFILE.35,R2" 
70 PRINT NAME$(2) 

80 PRINT D$; "WRITE PHONEFILE.35,R3" 

90 PRINT NAME$(3) 

100 PRINT D$; "CLOSE PHONEFILE,35" 

What you should have on your disk after running this program is a 
short random access fde containing three records. Each record has one 
name and phone number linked together as a single string. Line 30 ends 
with the parameter L35 to tell DOS that each record will be 35 bytes 
long. Line 40 ends with Rl to indicate that the next print command places 
data into record 1 . The parameters R2 and R3 work the same way in lines 
60 and 80. 

If we wish to retrieve only the second record, we can structure our 
read program to do just that. Type new, enter the following program, 
save it as Read. Phonefile. 35, and run it. 

10 D$ = CHR$(4) 

20 PRINT D$; "OPEN PHONEFILE.35.L35" 
30 PRINT D$; "READ PHONEFILE.35,R2" 
40 INPUT NAMES 

50 PRINT D$; "CLOSE PHONEFILE.35" 
60 HOME: PRINT NAMES 

Because the mon command was turned on by the previous program 
and never turned off, you should see the disk I/O commands for an in- 
stant. Then, after your program has notified DOS that it's through with 
the text file, the screen will clear and you'll see the second name from 
your list. The second name was read because you specified record 2 in 
your read command in line 30. You'll note that we used the length 
parameter again in the open command. This parameter is necessary 



every time a random access file is opened. If you don't specify the same 
length in the program that reads the file as you did in the one that wrote 
the file, you'll be in trouble. DOS uses this parameter to count characters 
to see where one record ends and the next begins. If you don't treat a 
given file consistendy, you'll probably end up with garbled records. It's 
also up to you to make sure that any record you enter is no longer than 
the length specified. DOS doesn't check or print out an error message if, 
say, you put a forty-byte name into a thirty-five-byte record. Instead, it 
will probably write over part of the next record. If you want a routine 
that counts characters in a string before it is sent to the disk (and gives 
you an error message if the string is too long), you'll have to do it 
yourself in Applesoft. Here's one possibility: 

100 IF LEN(NAMES(I)) > 35 THEN 9999 

9999 PRINT "RECORD LENGTH EXCEEDED": GOTO 60 

The Write. Phonefile. 35 program suffers badly from redundant 
coding. Load and list it and then make the following changes. Delete 
lines 40 through 90 and add the following lines: 

40 FOR I = 1 TO 3 

50 PRINT DS; "WRITE PHONEFILE.35,R";l 
60 PRINT NAMES(I) 
70 NEXT I 

By setting your loop to whatever size you need (and dimensioning 
name$ if you have more than ten names) you can enter any number of 
records. Save the new write program and then change Read. Phonefile. 35 
as follows: 

15 I = 2 

30 PRINT DS; "READ PHONEFILE.35,R";l 

In both programs, using I for the record parameter allows us to vary 
the record handled by the read and write commands. The last obvious 
step is, of course, to let the user enter and retrieve the names in the file 
from the keyboard. Once again, change and save Write. Phonefile. 35 as 
follows: 

3 FOR I = 1 TO 3 

5 INPUT "ENTER A NAME "; NAMES(I) 
7 NEXT I 

Then change line 15 in Read. Phonefile. 35 to 

15 INPUT "WHICH RECORD NUMBER? ";l 

Now, when you run the write program, it will ask you to type the names 
and phone numbers and will save them in the file in the order you enter 
them. The read program will ask you for the number of the record you'd 
like to see and will display only that one. 

Changing what is stored in a record is simply a matter of reading it, 
printing it on the screen to make sure you have the correct one, entering 
the replacement string, and writing the new record to the disk using the 
same record number. To see this, enter and run the following program. 
When you're done, save it as Change. Phonefile. 35. 

10 DS = CHRS(4) 

20 INPUT "WHICH RECORD? ";l 

30 PRINT DS;"OPEN PHONEFILE.35,L35" 

40 PRINT DS;"READ PHONEFILE.35,R";l 

50 INPUT NAMES 

60 HOME: PRINT NAMES 

70 PRINT DS;"CLOSE PHONEFILE.35" 

80 INPUT "REPLACE THIS RECORD? (Y OR N)";AS 

90 IF AS = "Y" THEN 110 

100 GOTO 200 

110 INPUT "ENTER NEW NAME AND NUMBER "; NAMES(I) 

120 PRINT D$;"OPEN PHONEFILE,35,L35" 

130 PRINT D$i"WRITE PHONEFILE.35.R";l 

140 PRINT NAMES(I) 

150 PRINT DS;"CLOSE PHONEFILE.35" 

200 END 

It's a nuisance, of course, to have to reenter a complete record just to 
change part of it. It's also a good way to allow errors to creep in. 
Therefore, records within random access files can be subdivided into 
segments called fields, and each field can be changed without affecting 
the others. From the standpoint of the text file, fields are groups of 
characters separated by carriage returns. From the standpoint of the 
Basic program controlling the text file, each field is a different string or

numeric variable. You'll need to think of them in both ways, as strings 
(or numbers) separated by returns when you write to the file and as 
separate variables (including subscripted ones) when you're reading 
from the file or manipulating the information in a Basic program. Since 
the print command always generates a return at the end unless it's 
followed by a semicolon, the returns will be inserted almost automatical- 
ly; it's important, however, to remember that it's the return, not the print 
command, that actually separates the fields, because DOS searches for 
embedded returns to find the fields. To see how fields work, enter and 
run the following program: 
3 FOR I = 1 TO 3 

5 INPUT "ENTER NAME: "iNAME$(l) 

7 INPUT "ENTER NUMBER: ";NUMBER$(I) 

9 NEXT I 

10 D$ = CHR$(4) 

20 PRINT D$;"MONICO" 

30 PRINT D$;"OPEN PHONEFILE,35,L35" 

40 FOR I = 1 TO 3 

50 PRINT D$;"WRITE PHONEFILE.35,R";l 
60 PRINT NAME$(I): PRINT NUMBER$(I) 
70 NEXT I 

80 PRINT D$;"CLOSE PHONEFILE" 

Changes must be made to Change. Phonefile. 35 to make it handle two 
fields in each record. Now if you dimension your string variables and 
make your for-next loops realistically large, you'll find that you can 
make these three programs into a small but workable phone file or ad- 
dress list system. 

If you want to add embellishments like sorting alphabetically or 
searching for a particular name, you can do these things with Applesoft 
routines. It's merely a matter of reading the entire text file into an array, 
manipulating the array as you wish, deleting the old file, and writing the 
new file back to the disk under the old name. If the file is too large to 
load all at once, you can still search or sort by loading, reading, and 
manipulating only one or a few records at a time. 

As we've said before, the reason for deleting the old before saving 
the new is that, if the new file is shorter than the old, information still on 



the disk from the old file can become incorporated into the new file 
without warning. Also note that you must allow space in each record for 
the returns that separate the fields. 

Sequential Files. If you want to use space on the disk as efficiently as 
possible, a sequential text file is the type to use, especially if you don't 
plan to change the data within the file once it's been entered. Essentially 
a sequential file is just the same as one long record from a random access 
file. Because it is the default condition, you'll get a sequential file if you 
don't specify a record length parameter on the open statement. Go back 
to the first program you entered and saved as Write. Phonelist. 35 (the 
first one in this column). If you still have the original on disk, load it and 
make the following changes. Otherwise, reenter the program, changing 
these lines and deleting lines 60 and 80: 

30 PRINT D$;"OPEN PHONEFILE" 
40 PRINT D$;"WRITE PHONEFILE" 
100 PRINT D$;"CLOSE PHONEFILE" 

The important changes are the ones that remove the length parameter 
from the open command and the record number parameters from the 
write commands. In addition, since the new file will not have records of 
equal length, it's a good idea to eliminate the .35 reminder at the end of 
the name of the text file itself. If you make a practice of always including 
the length in the name of a random access file and never putting a number 
at the end of the name of a sequential file, you'll be able to tell from the 
catalog which kind of fde it is. This is important because DOS won't let 
you find out easily later on. 

After running the new Write. Phonelist program, you should have on 
your disk a fde called Phonefde, which contains three fields with names 
and numbers. The fields contain seventeen, twenty-two, and nineteen 
characters respectively. Each field in the fde is actually one byte longer 
than these figures because it contains the return separating the fields. To 
read the fde, run the following program: 

10 INPUT "ENTER NUMBER OF FIELDS ";N 

20 D$ = CHR$(4) 

30 PRINT D$;"OPEN PHONEFILE"

WITH 
EVERYTHING. 



Your best buy in modem history. The 
Networkery a plug-in single-slot di- 
rect connect modem for your Apple II, 
II -H, and He (or Franklin, Albert, or 
other Apple compatible computer). 
You are immediately linked to the 
vast network of computers — data 
bases like the Source® Compu- 
serve® or Dow Jones? friends, banks 
businesses, and hundreds of local "bulletin 
boards." For only $129. There's absolutely 
nothing else to buy. And it even comes with 
software. 

This is the modem that does it all, and does 
it for less. The Apple Communications Card is on 
board, so you won't need to buy one. That will 
save a bunch. It's 300 baud, the most commonly 
used type of modem. It comes complete with its 
own communications software on Apple compati- 
ble disk, giving you features no modem offers. 

Like "data capture" to lock the messages 
into your Apples' RAM , and then move the infor- 
mation onto a disk for easy reference and review. 
A terminal program that turns your computer into 
a communications command center, displaying 
on-screen "help" menus, continuous updates of 
memory usage, carrier presence, baud rate, 
communications status, all while taking in and 
displaying information from any computer. 

The Networker supports both originate and 
answer modes, so you can send and receive in- 
formation, in full or half duplex modes. And its 
all easily programmable right from the keyboard 
of your Apple computer. All you do is plug Net- 
worker into any slot (except 0) in your Apple 
computer. It'll even ask you what slot it's in. 
It's that easy to use. 




NETMASTER™ COMIVIUNICATIONS 
SOFTWARE 

For $179 we include the even more incredible 
Netmaster software for advanced users. Net- 
master is a "communications freeway" that 
lets you speed any Apple file to another Apple 
through noisy phone lines, without errors. Net- 
master even includes its own Disk Operating 
System to control the flow of information and 
leave you over 40K of "buffer" memory from 
your 64K RAM. And there's always help when 
you want it. On screen. Status indicators keep 
you fully updated. 

Netmaster will let you transfer games, 
computer graphics, programs, sales reports, 
documents, any DOS 3.3 file, all directly from 
disk to disk, all with computer (not telephone) 
accuracy. Netmaster is completely configurable 
to understand any computer, even mainframes. 
File size is unlimited. 

But Netmaster is not stuffy. It will talk to 
the other communications packages like Visi- 
term® or ASCII Express® Of course they don't 
support Netmaster's superb error checking, 
that guarantees you won't miss even a comma. 
It doesn't only talk to the Networker either. It 
will also talk to those more expensive modems 
from Hayes and Novation. 



And Netmaster is fast. It trans- 
fers information disk to disk three to 
five times faster than the others. Of 
course Netmaster is fully compatible 
with them. But if you want things to 
happen really fast, talk to another 
Netmaster. 
We sell Netmaster by itself for $79, 
and even if you have another modem for your 
Apple, Netmaster is an outstanding value. It will 
even support auto dial and auto answer. Net- 
master requires 48K of Apple memory, disk 
drive and DOS 3.3, and ZOOM'S Networker 
modem or another modem. It can also be used 
without a modem when two Apples are hard- 
wired together, using a 6850 or 6551 -based in- 
terface card. 

Networker, Netmaster, and Networker/ 
Netmaster combo are all produced in the USA 
by ZOOM Telephonies, producers of the popular 
DEMON DIALER, The Networker is FCC regis- 
tered, and all products come with a one-year 
warranty.

Everything's very simple until you want to make some changes, and 
then you discover why random access files were invented. There are two 
additional commands that can be used with sequential files to let you 
make changes or find particular fields. These commands are append and 
position. The first opens a file that's already been created and prepares 
DOS to write to it. Append won't create a new file if the file specified 
isn't already on the disk. Instead of going to the beginning of the file, as 
open does, append goes to the end of the file and waits for the program's 
next instruction. After saving the Read.Phonefile program you've just 
run, type new and then run the following program: 

10 D$ = CHR$(4) 

20 PRINT D$;"APPEND PHONEFILE" 

30 PRINT D$;"WRITE PHONEFILE" 

40 PRINT "APPLE COMPUTER 408-996-1010" 

50 PRINT D$;"CLOSE PHONEFILE" 

Now when you run Read.Phonefile, you should find that the text file has 
four names and numbers. 

When you need to make changes in the middle of a sequential file, 
you have to use the position command to find the field you want. Unfor- 
tunately this command will carry you only forward through the fields and 
won't allow you to back up. If you need to do that, you'll have to open 
the file again to set the pointer at the beginning and then use position to 
go forward through it again. The command takes the form position 
filename, R25, where the number following R is the number of fields for- 
ward that you'd like to go. Let's assume we want to read only the second 
and fourth fields in our file. Type new and run the following: 

10 D$ = CHR$(4) 

20 PRINT D$;"OPEN PHONEFILE" 



30 PRINT D$;"POSITION PHONEFILE.RI " 

40 PRINT D$;"READ PHONEFILE" 

50 INPUT NAME$(1) 

60 PRINT D$;"POSITION PHONEFILE.RI " 

70 PRINT D$;"READ PHONEFILE" 

80 INPUT NAME$(2) 

90 PRINT D$;"CLOSE PHONEFILE" 

100 HOME : PRINT NAME$(1) : PRINT NAME$(2) 

Line 30 moves the pointer through the file from the first field, where 
the pointer is placed when the file is opened, to the second field. Line 40 
reads that field and places the pointer at the beginning of the next field. 
Thus when the program reaches line 60, the pointer is at the third field, 
and it must go forward only one more field to get to the fourth one. Even 
though the read command was given in line 40 and the file is still open, 
it must be repeated in line 70. Any DOS command, or even print D$ by 
itself, cancels both read and write commands. 

If you expect that you'll need to change the information, use random 
access files. On the other hand, if you're writing an adventure game and 
the room descriptions won't change as the game is played, by all means 
use sequential files. Note that position will work with random access 
files to move forward from field to field either within a record or across 
record boundaries. It's not the recommended way to do it, however, 
because the records may not have the same number of fields, so you can 
get lost easily. And of course you can't back up. 

Exec Files. You may have noticed (and become confused by) the 
reference to something called an exec file in your DOS Manual. The exec 
file isn't really a separate type of file. It's a sequential text file that's used 
to store a series of commands rather than data. The exec file is named for 
the exec (short for execute) command, which wUl read a text file and in- 
terpret it as commands from the keyboard. Among other things, this 
helps to get around the restriction that you can have only one Basic pro- 
gram in memory at a time. Although the exec file isn't precisely a Basic 
program, it can do some of the things a program can without disturbing 
the program in memory. Unfortunately there's a serious limitation. The 
only commands allowed in exec files are those that can be entered from 
the keyboard. They can be Applesoft or DOS commands or act as input 
to a running program. Unlike a program, an exec file can't have line 
numbers. This eliminates branching commands such as goto and gosub, 
but if-then statements are all right for conditionally executing other com- 
mands besides branching ones. To see an example, create a text file with 
a simple Basic program by running the following: 

10 D$ = CHR$(4) 

20 PRINT D$;"OPEN CATFILE" 

30 PRINT D$;"WRITE CATFILE" 

40 PRINT "CATALOG" 

50 PRINT D$;"CLOSE CATFILE" 

As you should realize immediately by now, this program will create 
and save on your disk a sequential text file with only one field containing 
the word catalog. Type exec catfile and you'll see the catalog. The exec 
command can be used both from the keyboard and from within a Basic 
program (preceded by the customary print D$). 

Using Multiple Files. Suppose you want to transfer some of the in- 
formation in one text file to another. It would be perfectly feasible to 
open one file, read the appropriate fields and assign them to Basic 
variables, close the file, open the other file and write the information, 
and fmally close that file. It's unnecessary to go through aU that. Instead 
you can have several files open at one time. You can read from some of 
them and write to others as you wish. That's why all text file commands 
must have the name of the file (except close, which closes all files if used 
by itself)- When DOS is booted, it creates three 595-byte file buffers, 
one of which it needs for its own operations and two of which are 
available for the user. These buffers begin at memory location 384(K) 
($9600 in hex), which is why we normally say that DOS extends in 
memory upward from that location. 

If you need to have more than three files active at a time, you can 
allocate up to sixteen buffers (fifteen for you and one for DOS) with the 
command maxfiles n, where n is the number of buffers. This command 
can be entered either from the keyboard or from an Applesoft program. 
Because the command puts these buffers into memory areas normally 
used by Applesoft for strings, it can clobber any data created by a pro- 
gram. If you use maxfiles in a program, make it the first line.

Last month, we saw how a computer equipped with a modem is not 
always an economical means of person-to-person communication. It's 
much easier to pick up the phone and talk. 

The primary reason for hooking up an Apple to the phone lines, then, 
is not for people to communicate with each other but to allow the com- 
puter to receive information from distant sources. The Source, Compu- 
Serve, the Dow Jones News/Retrieval Service, Dialog, and Delphi are 
just a few information databases available to anyone who has the right 
equipment and a few extra dollars. 

Though tens of thousands of people subscribe to these services, there 
are those who might not need all of what they have to offer. For them, 
there are less elaborate information systems called bulletin board 
systems. 

A bulletin board system, or BBS, is similar to what it sounds like, ex- 
cept you don't walk up to it; you dial it up on your computer. In most 
cases, it doesn't cost a thing to dial a BBS, except the price of the phone 
call. The best way to get acquainted with the way a BBS works is to call 
one up. Shall we? 

Magical BBS Tour. The first and most obvious thing we need is a 
phone number. Ask some of your friends or someone at a computer store 
if they know of any good boards in operation. The numbers of a few 
popular boards that have been operating for several years are listed later 
on in this column. 

It's possible to see a BBS as a sort of message center— or even a 
message taker. In addition to being able to post and read messages on the 
board, most users of BBSs can exchange private mail with each other. In 
this respect the BBS almost becomes an electronic postal service. 

Once you're connected to a system, you'll receive a greeting message, 
which usually looks something like this: 

* Welcome to Nomura, the Japanese Science Fiction * 

* Film Bulletin Board Service * 

* Located in Torrance, California * 

* Patty the Sysop is = > out * 

Greetings run anywhere from a few lines to a few paragraphs in length, 
depending on how verbose the system operator, or sysop (pronounced 
sissop), is feeling. 

What's the Delay? Somewhere along the line, you'll be asked how 
many nulls you need. A null is a delay that the remote computer sends if 
you set up your printer to print information as it comes across the phone 
line. The delay is necessary because the print head on a printer needs 
time to return to the left margin to print the next line. Without the delay, 
or null, it would lose whatever characters come in while the head is mov- 
ing from one end of the printer to the other. Nulls, then, cause the stream 
of information to pause while the printer head catches up. 

If you're not using a printer, enter zero as the number of nulls need- 
ed. If you are using a printer, you'll have to experiment to find out how 
many nulls you need, since all printers differ. Usually a number between 
zero and fifty is plenty. 



Most of the time, the system will request you to enter your name, 
city and state, and phone number. This is just to keep track of who 
callers are and where they're calling from. Though most people do in- 
deed input their names, monikers are a popular means of identification. 
Lord Radnar, Gumby N. Pokey, Sir Twitt, Grover the Gopher, Sunspot, 
Phangor, and Jitterbug are but a few aliases BBSers use. 

Almost always, a BBS will ask you to enter a password or identifica- 
tion code. Don't be scared; often, a password is assigned to anyone 
who wants one. Depending on how sacred the information on the board 
is, acquiring a password usually involves nothing more than leaving your 
name and phone number and waiting for the sysop to call on the phone 
and verify your identity. 

Some boards have security levels that provide users with access to 
various parts of the board. The higher your security level, the greater 
your access to privy information. At the very least, the lowest level pass- 
word allows you to read and post messages and exchange electronic mail 
with other users. 

Often, a password isn't necessary in order to use many of a board's 
commands. But if the BBS looks like one you might want to call more 
often, you'll want to leave a message with the sysop requesting a 
password. 

After you enter the appropriate data, you'll usually receive some in- 
formation on the system and any bulletins intended for all users. Finally, 
you're at the command mode. 

In command mode, your screen displays an arrow prompt, waiting 
for you to input a single-letter command. If you're not sure of the com- 
mands, typing in a question mark usually displays all the commands and 
brief explanations of what they do. Most BBSs have two main serv- 
ices—a public board and private mail. 

Hear Ye, Hear Ye. The public board is that part of a BBS that 
everyone is allowed to read. Notices include items for sale, requests for 
aid in adventure games, or general information on everything from inter- 
national politics to the finer points of fencing. It's not uncommon to find 
beginning and advanced programmers requesting aid to solve a particular 
problem, movie buffs commenting on a recent release, Dungeons & 
Dragons fans exchanging bits of knowledge, or ordinary people express- 
ing opinions on current events. 

Some boards specialize in certain areas, and their public bulletins tend 
to relate to that area. Magnetic Fantasies in Los Angeles, for instance, 
contains several ongoing fantasy games run by a handful of the BBS's 
users. Players send their "moves" to the dungeonmasters via private 
mail, and the results of each player's move appear on the public board. 

If you have neither the patience nor the time to read through all the 
public bulletins, a quickscan command lets you flip through the subject 
lines of some or all of the bulletins, allowing you to see their subject mat- 
ter and who they're from to flag messages for later retrieval. Once 
you're finished flagging messages, a retrieval command pulls them out in 
the original order for you to read.

SOU TAI ^ 



NOVEMBER 1983 



It's quite possible that you'll feel like responding to a message or 
two, either an answer to someone's request or just a personal opinion. 
There are two options here. You can either post your message on the 
public board for all to see or you can respond to someone through the 
private mail system. 

Wait a Minute, Mr. Postman. Using private mail requires having a 
password or being verified by the sysop, which means you probably 
won't be able to send any mail your first time on the board. But as soon 
as you receive a password, a whole new dimension of the board is 
opened to you. You'll begin meeting people with whom to share infor- 
mation or exchange ideas. (On one BBS in Chicago recently, five users 
were involved in a dicussion about what rights to airspace the Soviet 
Union should have, if any, in light of this past September's Korean 
airline incident.) 

Though some BBSs alert you when you log on whether or not you 
have mail waiting, there is a command that checks your mailbox for let- 
ters. If necessary, you can store letters for future reference, but it's 
usually good practice and common courtesy to delete letters from your 
box once you've read them. 

There are probably as many different kinds of BBSs as there are peo- 
ple who run them, mostly because boards tend to reflect the personality of 
the sysop. While a common practice is to name a board after the software 
running it and the city where it's located (Net-Works Baton Rouge, 
ABBS San Mateo, and so on), it's not uncommon to find boards with 
names like Teledunjon, Magic Lantern, Coin Games, Chipmunk, War- 
lock's Castle, and Dial-a-Joke. 

Your Own BBS. You don't need any software if you want to call a 
BBS; all you need is your computer, a modem, and a phone line. How- 
ever, if you wish to set up your own BBS for others to call you, then you 
need the software. 

Some of the most popular boards are run on the Net-Works software 
from High Technology (Oklahoma City, OK). In addition to the public 
board and private mail exchange, the Net- Works system allows Apple 



users with a Hayes Micromodem II and a disk drive to download Apple- 
soft, Integer, and binary programs from the board directly to their own 
disks. To use this feature, you can't have a terminal program running at 
the same time. Net- Works sends the data to your Apple's RAM and saves 
it to disk for you. If you're using any other configuration (a different 
modem, cassette storage), then Net- Works assumes you have a method 
of capturing data as it comes across the phone line and will send but not 
save the program. 

For non- Apple users or Apple users without a Micromodem n or disk 
drive. Net- Works allows you to download programs as text files. In addi- 
tion to Apple programs, TRS-80 and Commodore Pet programs are also 
available. Once the text file is stored safely on your disk, you need to 
change it back to its original form— either Applesoft, Integer, or binary. 

For Apples Only. One of the original BBS software packages for the 
Apple is ABBS {Apple Bulletin Board System) from Software Sorcery 
(McLean, VA). There are fewer ABBSs than Net-Works systems, 
though ABBS offers more depth. In addition to being able to download 
programs from the board to one's own disk, ABBS users are allowed to 
upload programs of their own onto the system. Other users then can 
download those programs for themselves. 

All transferring of programs to and from the system, however, is 
done in the form of text files. Whereas the programs you can get from a 
Net- Works system are ready to run once you receive them, programs 
you download from ABBS must be converted from text to Applesoft, In- 
teger Basic, or binary first. The same goes for the reverse process. If you 
have a program you'd like to put on the board for public consumption, 
you must convert it into a text file before doing so. 

Instructions for converting Basic programs to text files are given, be- 
ginning on page 76, in The DOS Manual under the heading "Capmring 
Programs in a Text File." Instructions are also given in the DOS Pro- 
grammer's Manual for Apple lie beginnng on page 96, "Capturing Lines 
from a Basic Program." For binary programs, you need to change them 
to Basic first and then convert the Basic programs to text files. To find

DOS, CPTWf PASCAL 

The only communications software 

you'll ever need! 



|Softerm 1 

The Complete, Upgradeable Package 
{for Home or Business Use 

I Softerm 1 is a powerful and flexible terminal emula- 
ition program that operates on an Apple" II, II Plus, 
lor lie to provide basic terminal communications to 
' a variety of host computers, timesharing services, 
land information services such as The Sourcef"^ 
i CompuServe " and the Dow Jones News/ Retrieval " 
lit operates full or half-duplex at speeds up to 
19600 bps using either a direct connection or any 
I standard manual or auto-dial modem. Features in- 
i elude user-defined keyboard macros, built-in phone 
;book for automatic dialing, terminal mode line 
I capture simultaneously to print or disk, copy screen 
I to print or disk, and terminal status display, 

I DOS, CP/M, and PASCAL 
File Compatibility Combined In 
a Single Program 

I Softerm 1 incorporates an advanced file manager 
i which provides compatibility with DOS 3.3, CP/M, 
land Pascal disk formats for all file operations 
1 including file transfers. And at speeds up to 5 times 
! faster than standard Apple DOS! Built-in disk utili- 
j ties provide INIT. CATALOG. RENAME, and DELETE 
' commands for all disk formats. Wildcard match char- 
acters can be used whenever filenames are entered. 

Local file transfers allow DOS, CP/M, or Pascal 
files to be displayed, printed, or even copied to 
another disk. For example, a file on a CP/M for- 
matted disk in Drive 1 could be copied to a Pascal 
(formatted disk in Drive 2 providing a complete 
; format conversion capability. Numerous editing 
options such as tab expansion and removing 
unwanted characters allow easy reformatting of 
data to accommodate the variations in data formats 
used by host computers. 



Multi-Protocol 

File Transfer Capability 

Softerm 1 offers file transfer methods flexible 
enough to match any host computer requirement. 
These include the character protocol with user- 
definable characteristics to provide maximum flexi- 
bility for text file transfers to any computer. The 
CP/M User's Group standard XMODEM protocol 
may be used for binary file transfers with systems 
using the CP/M operating system. The intelligent 
Softrans protocol can be used to transfer any type 
file and provides automatic binary encoding and 
decoding, error detection and automatic retransmis- 
sion, and data compression to enhance line utiliza- 
tion. A FORTRAN 77 source program is supplied 
with Softerm 1 which is easily adaptable to any 
host computer to allow communications with 
Softerm using the Softrans protocol. Specific host 
computer versions of the Softrans FORTRAN pro- 
gram are available on request. 
Softerm file transfer utilizes an easy to use com- 
mand language which may be executed interactively 
or from a macro command file which has been 
previously entered and saved on disk. Twenty-three 
high-level commands include DIAL. CATALOG. 
SEND RECEIVE ONERR MONITOR HANGUP, and 
others. A SCHEDULE command even allows file 
transfers at a specific date and time. 

Softerm 2 

The "Choice of Professionals" 

Softerm 2 includes all features of Softerm 1 and 
provides an exact terminal emulation for a wide 
range of conversational and block mode CRT ter- 
minals. Special function keys, sophisticated editing 
features, even local printer capabilities of the ter- 
minals emulated are fully supported. In fact, your 
host computer won't know the difference! All of the 
following emulations are included in Softerm 2 and 
the list is growing...

out how to convert binary programs to Basic, take a look at page 77 in 
The DOS Manual, under "Converting Machine Language Routines to 
Basic," or page 98 in the DOS Programmer's Manual for Apple He, 
under "Translating Machine Language to Basic." 

Unlike Net-Works software, which runs only on the Hayes Micro- 
modem n, ABBS supports the Micromodem II, the Novation Apple-Cat 
II, the SSM ModemCard and AIO-U, and the Apple Super Serial Card. 
Remember, though, that any computer— IBM, Commodore, Radio 
Shack, Atari, Heathkit, or whatever— can call and use a BBS. So just 
because a BBS is run on an Apple doesn't mean only Apple users can call 
it. Naturally, it works the other way around; you can call any BBS with 
your Apple and modem, regardless of the type of computer running the 
service at the other end. 

Another feature of ABBS is the multiple public boards available. On 
many BBSs, there is one public board that everyone uses. This means 
that if you're looking for someone with an interest in shortwave radio, 
for instance, you have to weed through all the other messages and try to 
pick out those that interest you. On ABBS, several boards are cate- 
gorized according to interest and subject. On a typical ABBS, you might 
get a choice of boards that specialize in politics, religion, hobbyists, fan- 
tasy games, ads, movies, sports, or rock music. 

There is also a news module on ABBS that allows the sysop to create, 
edit, and post news stories that might be of interest to callers. 

Take note that if you're considering ABBS as the way you'd like to 
set up a BBS, the bare-bones software includes only the public board. All 
features such as the multiple boards, uploading and downloading of pro- 
grams, private mail, and news features cost a few bucks extra. 

The Biggie. A third and more elaborate type of system is PMS (Peo- 
ple's Message System) from Datel Systems (Lakeside, CA). One promi- 
nent feamre of PMS is its lengthy list of other known operating BBSs. 
The list covers BBSs of all kinds (IBM, TRS-80, CP/M, Net-Works, 
ABBS, CBBS, and others). Because of its length— a printout of the list 
runs about thirty pages long— you can choose to list only those boards 
you're interested in, as you would list records on a database. PMS lets 
you search for numbers by area code, BBS type, or city. For example, 
typing 0;ABBS at the command level will list only ABBS boards, while 
typing 0, (312) will list only boards in the 312 area code.

PMS's Strongest feature is the wealth of information available on it 
for callers to read and save to their own disks. Besides having possibly 
the most complete list of BBSs in the world, PMS boards have a section 
that contains news features, articles, and excerpts from published works. 

Again, the sysop is the one who decides what goes into this section. 
Some carry articles written by fellow callers, some are reprints of stories 
from national wire services, and some are bits of information that defy 
classification. Subjects of articles include the Moscow telephone book, a 
review of Epcot Center, brownie recipes, Apple programming tutorials, 
satellite communications, poetry, and stunning truths. 

PMS costs considerably more than the other two BBS software pro- 
grams, but according to Bill Blue— author of PMS, ASCII Express: The 
Professional, and coauthor of ABBS— many purchasers of PMS report 
that they started out with other programs and found them far too limiting. 
Other users of PMS are businesses that set up boards strictly for the use 
of their employees. Such boards don't make their telephone numbers 
publicly available, for obvious reasons. 

Even though many PMS boards are alike in features, some contain 
unique offerings. A PMS board in Anaheim, California, run by enthusi- 
ast Freida Wolden, bills itself as //"magazine, //"costs $10 to join (non- 
paying callers can still have access to most of the board's features) and 
members get price discounts on hardware and software purchases. A 
popular feature on //"is a newly added Dungeons & Dragons game. 

The Kids' Message System in San Diego is just that— a system de- 
voted entirely to kids. Callers should be prepared to encounter messages 
on the public board describing things as "real gross," "wicked," and 
"totally righteous." Recounting why he left his former rock band, one 
teenager on the system described his former partner as "a real scum." 
Another youth wanted to know if he had any fellow schoolmates on the 
system: "Hey, how many of you go to Parsons Junior High?" 

For the Sake of Posterity. Often you'll want to keep some sort of 
permanent record of what you find on a BBS. Letters from other users, 
bulletins of interest, lists of commands for various boards, and news 
items may come in handy in the future. If you have a printer, you can 
keep a hard copy of your BBS sessions by initializing the printer before 
you call a board. Though effective, this method has its drawbacks. 

First of all, you'll have to print everything that you receive from the 
BBS and not just the items you wish to keep. Second, it means you can 
receive information only as fast as your printer can print. In most 
cases, the transfer of data across the phone lines is slow enough without 
having to wait for the printer to spit out everything you receive. 

A better way to capture the information you want is with a terminal 
program. In addition to making it possible for you to send and receive 
files between you and another person, most terminal programs set up a 
buffer (a holding area) in your Apple's memory that will retain whatever 
data comes in through a modem or is tyf)ed at your keyboard. This way, 
you can collect all the data you need, and when you're off the phone, 
you can save it all to disk as a text file and print it at your convenience. 

Most programs permit you to control the buffer while you're on the 
phone so you don't have to save everything that comes in. For example, 
you can have the buffer closed while you log on to a BBS, enter your 
password, and then receive the obligatory greeting message. When you 
want to read your mail, just open the buffer so it can save your letters as 
they come in through the modem. When you're done receiving your 
mail, close the buffer and continue with your business. 

When you hang up, the buffer will be holding only your letters. Most 
of the time, terminal programs save the contents of the buffer as standard 
Apple text files. If you have a word processor that handles Apple text 
files, you can use it to edit files before printing. 

Consumer Watch. Next time, we'll examine and dissect various 
kinds of terminal programs so we'll know what sort of features to look 
for when shopping for one. In the meantime, here are a few BBS 
numbers to keep you and your telephone busy: 



PfVlS— Santee, CA 

Dial-Your-fVlatch— Burbank, CA 

fvlark the Mixed Up Martian— Santa Monica,

All of these numbers are the original boards of their kind. On them 
you'll find numbers for similar boards around the country. PMS lists the 
numbers of more than six hundred BBSs of all types, and it's updated 
frequently. ^"

STREETS 

BY MELISSA MlLICH 

treet corners in the sleazy part of every town have them — gangs of 
kids, bored, tough, and looking for something, probably trouble. Most 
people drive by such street comers with their windows rolled up, doors 
locked tight. The drivers look straight ahead, trying to get out of the 
mean part of town as quick as possible. 

Ida Mae Sydnor, on the other hand, drives up to the knot of kids on a 
street in California's capital city and does something a little different. 
She stops and rolls down her window. 

"You boys want to learn about computers?" she asks. 
I The "boys" are transplants from a south-central Los Angeles gang. 
[They had been involved in heavy-duty gang activity down south. Now, 
here was this lady, a grandmother, asking if they would like to learn 
about computers. 

Some of them can't read all the words in the homemade brochure the 




A sense of the fun of learning permeates the computer room at the Computer Alternative Center in Sacramento, California. Students, who come mostly 
from underprivileged neighborhoods, are taught programming and other skills; good work habits and attire are also stressed. 



lady in the gray Chevy hands them. That doesn't matter, come anyway, 
she says. 

So, what do the "boys" have to lose? 

Others may shun them, but these are exactly the type of kids Ida Mae 
Sydnor, mother of fourteen children, grandmother of fifteen, is looking 
for. In fact, these transplanted gang members are the first group of 
pupils to enroll in her computer programming class for dropouts and 
delinquents. 

Lilies of the Field. One day Sydnor told the members of her church 



congregation in Sacramento, California, that praying was fine, but that it 
was "time to get out of the church and into the streets." Her proclama- 
tion got her a committed group of people who wanted to help the kids on 
the street comers, kids who don't have anything going for them. 

It was June 1981 and computers were still a way off. Sydnor and 
friends formed the nonprofit Black Sacramento Christian Club and 
started offering classes in ceramics, interpretive dance, and gospel sing- 
ing. Sydnor went door to door to find students and had her friend Joy da 
Middleton or her husband Clarence drive her around the streets. They

went looking for kids with nothing to do. 

Sydnor and the other volunteers paid for all the class materials and 
supplies out of their own pockets. They required no fees from the young 
people to take any of these classes. "If a mother has to choose between 
class fees and bread, she's going to buy bread," says Sydnor. 

So she got some kids off the street and instructed them in singing, 
dancing, and making things out of clay. Her scheme worked, but it was 
not enough. What these kids really needed were jobs. 

Computers were close and yet far away in Ida Sydnor's life then. She 
was working in then Governor Jerry Brown's office on the Community 
Relations staff. When the department's first word processor arrived for 
one of the secretaries, Sydnor asked to be trained on it. 

"Whenever I see something new, I want to learn how it works," she 
said. And she kept asking, "Are you offering training on that word proc- 
essor?" Her name was put on a list. 

She knew it would be a magical machine if she could ever get her 
hands on it. Finally, three and a half months later, she was given one 
hour of instruction, and a book of documentation was dropped in her lap. 

The word processor was indeed magical, and Sydnor's encounter 
with it inspired her to take a data processing class at a local junior col- 
lege. She decided everybody was going to need computer literacy— soon. 
Those kids on the street comers needed computer literacy, too. 

Sydnor's first thoughts about computers were prophetic. She read an 
article in Time confirming her prophecies about computers being the 
wave of the future, but the article also said minorities were going to be 
left out of the computer technology boom. The reason? Minorities do not 
have access to the information. 

"Well," Ida Sydnor said. "That doesn't have to be." And so she 
began formulating plans for the Computer Alternative Center for In- 
dependent Study, where her students could learn computer programming. 
Now that's not learning key punch or data entry, but programming, 
which Sydnor feels is the highest skill to be learned on a computer. Syd- 
nor took it upon herself to break the poverty cycle. 

Poverty to Him That Refuses Instruction. The poverty cycle had a 
lot of Sydnor's kids absolutely dizzy. They didn't fit in anywhere except, 
maybe, street corners. They couldn't read. They couldn't write. They 
couldn't fill out a job application. 

"They're going to be the last people to get jobs," said Sydnor. 
"They need some kind of an edge. Any type of computer knowledge 
they can pick up will help them get a job." 

A fund-raiser is always a good way to bring in cash fast, but 
sometimes the best-laid plans go awry. The First Annual "He Lights the 
Way" Banquet, held in July 1982 by the Black Sacramento Christian 
Club, was expected to bring in a tidy sum — or at least enough to buy a 
lone Apple, because Sydnor had already decided that Apple was the 
way to go. 

It was a grand affair, with a spread of food well worth the ticket 
price. 

Outside the Oak Park Community Center, where the banquet was 
held, there's always a crowd of little children playing. They saw the 
catering trucks and smelled the food, and they peeked through the win- 



dows at the banquet. People were already lining up and these little 
children figured, well, they'd get in line too. Ticket? Who needs a ticket? 

Suddenly there were a lot of them, appearing seemingly out of 
nowhere, hungry little waifs all wanting food. It was like a scene out of 
Oliver\ 

"What are we going to do?" cried one of the organizers. 
"Let them eat," Sydnor said. 

The caterer, who was charging by the plate, lost count with so many 
new arrivals. He threw up his arms in despair and decided to charge the 
group one lump sum. Consequently, the Black Sacramento Christian 




Tangie Johnson and Monica Williams try their hand at entering data into 
the Datapoint 8200 system. 

Club only cleared sixty dollars on their grand-affair banquet. 

And Bring Forth Fruit with Patience. There is an old saying that 
the more you give away, the more comes back. Soon after the banquet. 
Pacific Telephone gave the group a $2,500 grant, which Sydnor plunked 
down immediately at a computer store for an Apple. The second Apple 
came when they were awarded another grant from Pacific Telephone. 
Both grants were helped along by Steve Heath, district manager for 
media relations at the phone company, says Sydnor. Federal funds 
started trickling in, and Sydnor knew she was going to bring some com- 
puter geniuses into the world. 

But apparently a lot of people had read the same Time article, and 
some people believe everything they read. They told Sydnor it couldn't 
be done, teaching dropouts and delinquents how to program. After all.

they didn't even have the basic educational skills. 

"A guy from Hewlett-Packard told me, 'You're not ready for it 
[teaching programming and word processing] yet.' And by the way," 
Sydnor emphasizes, "this was not a white man talking." 

People don't make up Sydnor 's mind for her. She had an instructor in 
mind, C.E. "Chuck" Starks, who would teach — step by step— the math 
skills students would need for programming as they went along. The 
students would learn basic but simplified math, cutting through all the 
extraneous material to acquire the skills necessary for programming. 

"These computers demand that you know things," says Sydnor. And 
she told the students, "I will give you the opportunity. And you're not 
going to rob yourself of this opportunity!" 

With that kind of encouragement, Ida Sydnor's gang began to learn 
programming. 

Their Redeemer Is Mighty. Sydnor says she turns these kids around 
by "getting inside their heads." To accomplish this, she has informal 
talk sessions in her office. 

"What were you on your way to becoming before you first walked in 
here?" she'll ask a young man seated across the desk from her. 

"I planned to be a first-class bank robber," is the reply. 

Although some of the students in Sydnor's classes probably never 
even stole an empty pop bottle, much of the enrollment is made up of 
veterans of Juvenile Hall and the California Youth Authority. Many, 
probably 95 percent, are high school dropouts. Sydnor thinks it's funny 
that one teacher thought at first that he had to bring a gun to protect 
himself from the students. 

Sydnor is not a big lady or a tough-looking woman, but she has a 
commanding demeanor, with a good deal of motherly affection thrown 
in. She is proud of the fact that "not one of the students ever even swore 
at me." 

What makes someone a gang member, anyway? The boy who was 
planning to be a first-class bank robber said there was "nothing else to 
do." Sydnor's mission is to show these kids there are ways to do things 
legally. There are a lot of success stories, but not everyone, of course, is 
going to turn out on the right side of the law. 

"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink," Sydnor 
says. Still, she leads every stray horse she can round up. 

You Can Lead a Stray Horse to a Computer, but You Can't 
Make Him Program in Basic. One day, before Apples arrived on the 
scene, Sydnor noticed someone standing outside peeking through the 
Venetian blinds at the ceramics class. 

"You don't want him in here," warned the ceramics teacher. "He's 
into drugs." "Him" was a tall, troublesome-looking kid, with long hair 
down to his shoulders. 

Sydnor was already marching outside. "That's exactly the kind of 
person I want in here." 

And when they were face to face: "I hear you're into drugs," she 
said. 

"Yeah," he said. 

"I hear you sell to kids," she said. 
"No, I don't sell to kids," he said. 

She looks back on her first meeting with the kid who was peeking 
through the Venetian blinds and recalls, "What I appreciated about him 
was that he didn't lie to me." 

His name is Michael Barron and he would come clean off his drug 
habits and dealings, and then, with the arrival of the Apples, would 
become one of the top programmers at the Computer Alternative Center. 

But it was a long battle, a nightmare, in fact. Michael went to see her 
once at the governor's office while Sydnor was still working there. He 
was so high, Sydnor said, on a mixture of dope and embalming fluid that 
she started crying. "Don't cry, Ida," Michael said, "I'll never do it 
again." 

Now Barron attends classes there in the afternoon, at a junior college 
in the morning, as well as an adult education institution at night to earn 
his high .school diploma. Sometimes Barron gets "edgy" and needs 
something to fill up the void. Then he gets the keys to the center from 
Sydnor and programs long into the night. Sometimes he just cleans and 
mops the floor there. 

The computers are the drawing card for such successes. Sydnor says 
she's never screened for good hoodlums or bad hoodlums, but invites 
them all. A pool room (trouble with a capital T) was right next to the 
computer room. 




"Why don't you guys come in and try the computers?" 

And they shook their heads and warned her, those pool players did, 
about those brand-new Apples sitting there like sitting ducks: "Ida, 
they're going to get ripped off." 

"Oh no," she boomed. "Those are your computers now. If someone 
steals them, they're stealing your computers. You'll know where they 
are. And you can find out easily enough where they are and go back and 
get them!" 

The Beginning of Knowledge. There's not much that Ida Sydnor is 
afraid of. Oh yes, there is one thing. 

"The future is going to be absolutely frightening for the noncomputer 
person," she says. "The next force of people that are going to be out of 
work are the computer illiterates. People need to advance— to move with 
the times. Either you know how to run a computer or you stay behind." 

Amen.

Opposite page and above: You need spend only a few moments in the office of Ida Sydnor to witness an incredible 
panorama of the human condition as the young people at the center come to grips with things like time cards, 
coping with responsibility, and dealing with the realities of their past. 



The Computer Alternative Center for Independent Study is the first 
community computer program in the world started for blacks and com- 
pletely run by blacks. But students of all ethnic origins are evident here. 
Whoever has a need and wants to learn — no age limit— good hoodlum or 
bad or not a hoodlum at all, is welcome to come in and try the computers. 

When you know about the backgrounds of some of Sydnor 's students, 
it's surprising to see the "boys" now. Most dress well and have a busi- 
nesslike attitude. Teenage boys actually wearing ties? It wasn't easy. 

"You guys gotta do it," she reasoned with them. "If you're going to 
tell me no, you're going to tell your boss no." They wear the ties. 

The Ties That Bind. The Computer Alternative Center is striving to 
be professional. They have formed a fledgling corporation called Data 
Oak (after Oak Park, the predominately black section of Sacramento 
where the center is located). Data Oak just completed its first project- 
programming and compiling a mailing list for an upcoming convention in 



Sacramento. Now they're ready to do similar projects for churches and 
small businesses, projects that involve writing their own programs for 
mailing lists, bookkeeping, and inventory. 

At the head of Data Oak is briefcase-toting general manager William 
Jerome Holloway. Nineteen-year-old Holloway says his mother is over- 
whelmed because he's now doing things she has never seen him do 
before— getting out of bed in the morning and reading books and 
newspapers to improve his reading skills. Holloway said he was a 
troublemaker during high school, but he's reached the age now where he 
knows he's going to have to decide what he's going to do with his life. 

James Henry, twenty-one — whom Sydnor says "can't spell a lick, 
but is one of the best programmers we've got" — works on creating and 
designing programs with Stephanie Sanchez. Reuben Watts is production 
manager. 

Federal funding for the Computer Alternative Center stopped in Oc- 



tober. Sydnor narrowly missed getting a grant proposal in when her 
mother suddenly became ill. Sydnor stayed at her mother's bedside every 
moment, and the older woman pulled through. But Sydnor missed the 
deadline for the grant and couldn't get an extension. 

The Promised Land. Sydnor and her people have a dream of making 
the Computer Alternative Center self-sufficient — either through the prof- 
its from Data Oak or from several computer literacy seminars instructor 
Starks will be offering to the general community for a fee. 

Data Oak also plans soon to start producing some of its own software 
for sale. 

"I think to be a good programmer you have to create, and the minds 
of these kids work swiftly," says Sydnor, who promises that the Data 
Oak line of software— especially the games— will be completely different 
from what's already available on the market. "Just go into a low-income 
area— those kids think differently about games than kids who grew up 
with ready-made toys. 

"When I was a kid I made my doll furniture out of milk cartons. We 
took an old tire and attached a metal rod to it and wheeled it down the 



Computer Alternative Center. Sydnor' s students, with their program- 
ming skills, demonstrated to this junior college instructor that they 
already knew everything in the entry-level class he taught and were 
ready to go on to the upper-level courses. 

"He allowed my students to get the credit for that beginning class and 
go up to the higher levels immediately," says Sydnor. "Of course, we 
didn't tell him that none of those kids ever even had algebra." 

Those are the older kids. Sydnor recently had one little boy who got 
kicked out of the public school system at the age of eight. Repeatedly, 
teachers said Raython was a nuisance and booted him out of class. 

The problem that finally got the little boy kicked out of the system 
wasn't his fault at all. Raython had gone way ahead of his classmates in 
learning multiplication and came to a screeching halt at 9 times 7. He 
kept asking the teacher, "What's 9 times 7?" The teacher refused to tell 
him until the rest of the class caught up. Raython got bored and wouldn't 
sit down, making himself a "nuisance." 

"Raython," said Sydnor, when she first heard the story, "come 
here. Do you want to know what 9 times 7 is?" She plugged a math soft-

street. You stick kids from a low-income background into software 
design and their computer games are going to turn out completely 
different." 

One of the reasons Sydnor likes Apple so much is because of the 
wealth of educational software available for the machine. But she would 
like to see more software that incorporated black history. "Some people 
can't live without peanut butter, but do they know it was invented by a 
black man? That was George Washington Carver. 

"And did you know that it was also a black man responsible for the 
traffic lights at busy intersections? 

"There 're so many things that have happened to blacks in this country 
that could be incorporated into educational software — Martin Luther 
King, the kids who got killed at Selma, Alabama. But it doesn't have to 
be totally all our history. I don't want any kid to play one of our games 
and feel left out. " 

Badlands. Sydnor says computers are going to enhance the educa- 
tional system. "Many of my kids came in here, and they couldn't read, 
and I mean," she pauses for emphasis, "couldn't readl 

"ft's not their minds. There's something else going on here. I don't 
care what caused them to leave school— we've got to get them back into 
the educational system. They're not going to get a good job without it." 

A teacher from one of the local junior colleges recently visited the 



ware program into the Apple. The screen soon displayed: 9 x 7 = 63. 

"So that's what it is! " said Raython. He mastered that disk in no time 
and promptly asked for another. Now he's back in the school system 
again. 

"The computer allows kids to move at their own pace," says Sydnor. 
"Why should they wait? Kids' minds move fast and the computer allows 
them to move ahead, as they should. When kids get bored, they get 
bored. Only the real disciplined ones do well in the traditional school 
system." 

The Price You Pay. So they leave. Sydnor herself dropped out of 
high school at age sixteen. In those days, the ugly facts of racism were a 
constant burden. She still remembers her shock when she learned she 
was barred from the choir at one school in Michigan. 

Sydnor had a gift, more like a calling, to work with problem kids. 
She went back to school and has been working with delinquents and all 
kinds of other misfits for more than twenty-six years. 

"You have to recognize that young people start being wounded. They 
don't need teachers telling them they can't learn." 

Kids need motivation. They need that first taste of success. Once they 
get that— a program that works or an introductory letter that shines— 
Sydnor tells them, "Hey! That's fantastic!" And the kids want to hear it 
again and again. 



NOVEMBER 1983 S Q P 

The Computer Alternative Center does everything it can to prevent 
the kids from dropping out of the program. Instructor Starks warns the 
kids about the frustration phase they are bound to reach in the process of 
learning and urges them not to drop out then— because seeing that 
frustration stage through usually brings about a click! They've learned 
something. 

"You mean this is computer programming?" the students say, truly 
shocked. "It can't be that easyl" 

"If you can keep up with this, you can do anything," Sydnor tells 
them. "This is one of the highest technologies. Whatever you want to be, 
it's at your fingertips." 

The computers have already given her kids an edge. Three of Syd- 
nor's former students, including two women, have already taken full- 
time jobs in the industry. She tells the rest of the students, "You will be 
able to make your way up in a company, once they find out you know 
programming." 

In the midst of her thoughts, Sydnor receives a phone call from a 
distraught mother of one of those street-comer kids. Sydnor gets a lot of 
similar phone calls from parents throughout the day. 

' 'Sweetheart, I always ..." she begins and then counsels the mother 
for a long time, tells her that she is going to have to bend also, and then 
warns her right before she hangs up the telephone: "Don't let him go 
back there. He'll be dead in a year." 

Wherever "there" is, Sydnor is trying to keep the kids, her stray 
ponies whom she cares so much about, away from it. 
^ "You have to try," she says. "My husband is always telling me that 
I think I can change the world. Well, somebody has to take the time to 
deal with the problems or we're going to have more problems. 

' 'And I have told my husband, this year has been one of my most suc- 
cessful. If I go to bed now and I never get up again, I'll be satisfied." 

Graduation Night. The word commencement, as in commencement 
ceremonies, means beginning, and the word never held truer than it did 
this last September 30 when the first group of students— forty-five in 
all— from the Computer Alternative Center received their diplomas for 
successfully completing the course work. These kids have had a new 
be'ginning, and they were proud, and their parents were proud, and Ida 
Mae Sydnor was the proudest of all. 

She bustled around before the banquet began, making last-minute 
preparations, greeting everybody, making sure everybody knew where 
to sit, rounding up the gospel singers, and straightening out who would 
be the recipients of the special awards to be given out during the 
ceremony. For this last duty, she and Starks bent their heads over the 
awards certificates while everybody else started the first course of 
the meal. 

"Student of the year is Bryan Haynes," Sydnor whispered while 
Starks printed the name on the certificate. "The best programmer 
awards go to Stephanie Sanchez and James Henry. Most cooperative, 
David Sanchez and Donald Wilson. Best dressed are Bryan Haynes and 
Ramona Thornton. And when you read off the award for the most likely 
to succeed," she concluded, "have the entire group of graduates stand up." 

And who should be passing out the diplomas but Chet Tatoian, 





Above: Class instructor Chuck Starks beams on the final session of his after- 
noon class; obviously no "frustration phase" here. Below, left: "Student of 
the year" Bryan Haynes receives his certificate of completion from J.T.P.A. 
chief Chester Tatoian. 



California State CETA representative, and Jim Pardum, a SETA 
representative. SETA and CETA were the very organizations from which 
the Computer Alternative Center's funds were cut. 

Tatoian had been one of the most skeptical observers of the Computer 
Alternative Center from its beginning, telling Sydnor that all her students 
would drop out. 

"Man, was he surprised when I told him just how many graduates we 
would have," Sydnor said gleefully. "We're graduating sixteen out of 
twenty from the afternoon class and twenty-nine out of thirty-five from 
our morning class." 

The speeches were actually short and to the point. Starks told them, 
"Keep pressing on. Only you will stop yourself. I challenge all of you to 
help one person in your community to make a similar accomplish- 
ment — a friend or a relative, you know who I'm talking about. Reach 
out." 

When student of the year Bryan Haynes was called upon to make his 
speech, his groan could be heard at the back of the room. But Haynes, 
who had overcome a great deal of brain damage caused by drugs and 
managed to complete the course successfully, told the audience how 
much he appreciated his classmates and said, "It would be nice if we 
could all get a job in the same place." 

Everybody seemed to have either a handkerchief or a camera up to 
their eyes. 

Afterward, Holloway, who received one of the class leadership 
awards, said Sydnor was "like a goddess to us." Holloway is one of 
those big, tough-looking kids that used to stand on street comers until he 
started hanging around the Computer Alternative Center instead. 

"I never thought I would graduate from anything," he said. "1 used 
to look at all my old friends not doing anything with their lives, just 
smoking dope. They were a mirror to me, what I didn't want to become. 
Now I know I can do anything I want because I completed this course." 
He paused and then stammered a little: "I feel like crying." 

At that moment, his mother, Velma, came mnning over with her 
camera. "One of you all together," she commanded, herding her big son 
and his fellow graduates into a group. 

Cameras are funny things. They make everybody freeze just for a 
moment. But they record that moment forever. The kids all hustled 
together and held their diplomas high. No one had to tell them to smile. 
The scene froze for an instant. Then the first graduating class of the 
Computer Alternative Center moved on to the fumre. JM

Mind Your 




BV PETER OLIVIERI 




Now that it's November, you're probably getting started on some 
Thanksgiving holiday preparations. There's always plenty to be thankful 
for, isn't there? No matter how bad things are, they could always be 
worse. Just imagine— your Apple could decide to erase one of your 
disks. Actually, that wouldn't be all that much of a disaster because 
you've been faithfully making one or two backups of all your important 
programs and data, right? 

Ill Apple People. Chances are some Apple III owners are feeling a 
bit like unwanted children these days. Not much attention is being paid 
lately to this important group. 

In contrast to the current trend, this column will continue to provide 
information about Apple ID programs and hardware. Another important 
way Apple III people can stay informed is by keeping up with what fel- 
low users are doing. One effective way of doing this is by participating in 
your local user group. Our very own B.U.G. members are likely to be 
another valuable resource. And in addition, there's now a publication of 
special interest to Apple HI owners and users. It's called the Open Apple 
Gazette, and it's published by the Original Apple Ilirs, a San Francisco- 
based user group. 

Joining the group costs about thirty dollars per year. Membership en- 
titles you to receive the Gazette, a bimonthly publication containing in- 
formation on VisiCalc, Business Basic, a thorough question-and-answer 
section, and much more. The biggest advantage you stand to gain from 
membership is the connection with other members with whom you 
share common interests. In essence, you'll have a forum where questions 
and problems can be resolved. In addition, it stands to reason that the 
group may have more influence on developments affecting the Apple III 
than owners acting individually would. 

Apple III Bits. Speaking of information about the Apple HI, did you 
know that Apple Computer has recently begun offering the Apple III 
with 256K as the standard amount of RAM? Also of interest, a new SOS 
manual is now available. The manual is intended more for programmers 
than for the average user; if you think you might be interested, stop by 
your local dealer and take a look. 

In other news, Apple now has a CP/M card for the Apple III, at a cost 
of between $500 and $600. As we mentioned in an early column, there 
are a great many CP/M programs out there that might interest you. 

Software Publishing Corporation, developer of the PFS series, has 
incorporated some new features into its software. If you have an Apple 
ni and a ProFile hard disk, it's now quite easy to back up large hard disk 
PFS files onto floppies. 

By the way, it's now possible to get dust covers designed especially 
for the in. You can now even cover a ' 'complete system" made up of the 
Apple III monitor, a ProFile hard disk, and the computer itself. Since 
many of the environments in which Apple Ills do their work are far from 
dust-free, a dust cover is inexpensive insurance indeed. 

One last note for owners of Apple lie's and Apple Ills who are inter- 
ested in running lie software on the III: The Ell's emulation mode does 
not recognize any of the customized features that might be designed into 
a piece of software made especially for the He. 

Net Profit. The term network comes up a lot these days. It's used in 
describing television conglomerates, dating services, telecommunica- 
tions facilities, and even computers. Since computer networks are cer- 
tainly of interest to computer users, it's appropriate that we take time 
here to explore what networking is all about. 

In the computer world, the term network is used to refer to a group of 
computers that are, in a sense, connected to one another. If these com- 
puters are in the same location within a facility (in a microcomputer lab 
at a school or as workstations in an automated office, for instance), the 



network is often termed a local network. 

One reason for establishing a network is to reduce costs. Let's say 
you're about to install ten Apples in your office environment. Can you 
really afford to buy a printer for each computer? And can you afford to 
equip each Apple with two disk drives? Setting up a network gets around 
these questions handily because it means that your ten microcomputers 
can share a printer or two and a hard disk. The hard disk offers greater 
speed and significantly more storage, and it is less expensive than ten or 
twenty individual disk drives. In addition, network users can store their 
programs on data on the hard disk; from there they can be shared by 
others. 

Of course, networks impose some limitations. Computers in a net- 
work are far less "portable" than complete individual Apple systems; 
they can't usually be taken home or to another office. Also, there's not a 
lot of software available at present for computer networks, and some 
commercially available programs can't be loaded onto a hard disk or are 
copy -protected to inhibit such resource sharing. 

Nevertheless, networks will almost certainly become increasingly 
common over the next few years. The ability to communicate with 
co-workers in the office via electronic mail and the appeal and/or 
necessity of working from our homes will usher in the age of the net- 
work. Quite a few schools and universities have already begun setting up 
extensive local networks. And one day soon we may see networks in 
which users working from different Apple stations will be working 
together on a single project. 

Various manufacturers now offer networking software, including 
Apple Computer and Corvus Systems (creator of Omninet, which uses 
the company's own hard disk drive). So if you're thinking about auto- 
mating the office or establishing a microcomputer lab, you might want to 
consider setting up a local area network. Perhaps some B.U.G. members 
who have experience with networking and Apples will get in touch to 
share their experiences. 

Health Checklist. Various factors in a computer environment can af- 
fect your health and well-being and that of those around you. Every so 
often, it's a good idea to take a good look at your circumstances to be 
sure they are the best they can be in terms of comfort and safety. Some 
questions worth considering include the following: 

1 . Is your computer setup safe? Make sure that the electrical outlet to 
which the computer is connected is not overloaded. And if your machine 
has a tendency to overheat, be sure you've installed a fan or taken other 
appropriate measures. 

2. Does your computer display contribute to eyestrain? Tinted 
screens can help alleviate the problem of eyestrain. In addition, do what- 
ever you can to reduce on-screen glare, which may come from objects in 
the room that are being reflected or from the brightness level of charac- 
ters on-screen. 

3. Are you suffering from computer-related backaches? You have 
only one back. Sitting too long at the computer can contribute to, or 
cause, aches and pains. So take breaks. And it isn't just sitting in one 
position for so long that can cause problems. Consider the chair you're 
sitting in. Is it comfortable? Is it too high or too low? Does it support 
your back? 

4. What role does stress play in your computer environment? Stress 
is a real hazard, both to you and to your employees. If you're the boss, 
it's a good idea to consider the possible computer-related stresses your 
employees may be experiencing. Some people dislike or are afraid of 
machines, others worry about fouling up the computer data, and others 
wonder what to do if the computer asks them something they don't 
know. A bit of understanding and awareness can make all the difference

in these kinds of situations. (Have you hugged your data entry person 
today?) 

First Base with Databases. Database management systems have 
been talked about in this column before, but it's been more than a year 
since we've discussed them at any length. Very soon we'll be taking an 
excursion into these systems. In preparation, it seems appropriate to 
review some relevant terminology; this should help new readers and may 
offer regulars a good refresher. 

A database is a collection of data, and this collection is usually made 
up of files. For example, an organization may have a database containing 
a personnel file, an inventory file, a financial file, and so on. A file con- 
tains records (the electronic equivalent of file folders) and a record usual- 
ly has several fields. In the example just mentioned, one of the file 
folders in the personnel file would be the record on a particular em- 
ployee. One of the fields in that record would contain the employee's 
name, another would contain a figure representing that employee's 
salary . 

A database management system is a set of programs designed to help 
you manage the data contained in a database. Database management 
packages are usually very general in nature — that is, such systems can 
usually be adapted for use in almost any record-keeping application you 
have. You can maintain anything from a personnel database to a database 
of your stamp collection. The idea is to have means of retrieving infor- 
mation in a variety of ways to facilitate your management of the data at 
your disposal. 

When you start looking into database management packages, you'll 
discover that they vary greatly in what they can do. To qualify as a true 
database, a system must possess at least five component programs. First, 
it must be able to create the database (for the first time); second, it must 
be able to search through the database according to search criteria you 
set; third, it must be able to make a backup copy of the database you cre- 
ate; fourth, it must allow you to format and print reports about selected 
data; and fifth, it must have a program that permits you to update (delete, 
add, or change) entries in the database. 

What Else Can You Expect? In addition to the basic five com- 
ponents just named, you can expect to find a variety of features in most 



commercially available packages. Most packages can calculate values 
based on data currently contained in the database, sort database records 
into any order you choose, design customized reports, prepare mailing 
labels, and create a special input screen to facilitate data entry. 

In the December issue, we'll not only review some of the leading 
database management systems, we'll also spend time addressing two 
other topics. First, we'll identify the characteristics you should be look- 
ing for in a DBMS, and second, we'll set forth a means of evaluating 
your own particular DBMS needs. The goal of this series is to put you in 
a better position to know both how you might use DBMS software and 
what particular packages might best meet your needs. 

In Brief. Events happen so fast in the microcomputer arena that it's 
easy to miss something. In light of this, every now and then we'll devote 
some column space to a quick "in brief section. Perhaps this will make 
the task of keeping up a little more manageable. 

Not so long ago, the only way to get programs and data into a com- 
puter was by using a keypunch to prepare punched cards containing the 
instructions and data. It was a tedious and cumbersome process. While 
there are still some installations that depend on punched card processing, 
a great many computer installations are now keypunchless and cardless; 
instead data and programs are being entered at microcomputers or ter- 
minals. Nevertheless, there are still some excellent uses for punched 
cards. Reader survey cards in a magazine, with certain areas darkened 
(using that famous number-two pencil) for reading by an optical card 
reader, are one good example. 

Perhaps you have boxes of punched cards that contain valuable data 
you'd like to enter into your Apple. You may have tests to grade, surveys 
to analyze, inventory records to consider, or time cards to record. If so, 
it should come as good news that it's now possible to read punched card 
data into an Apple. A company called Chats worth Data Corporation 
manufactures a series of card readers. The model that can be used with 
the Apple II comes with an intelligent interface board that plugs into slot 
4. All the firmware required to interface the reader with the Apple is 
stored in a PROM on the card reader interface board. A single command 
activates the reader. 

The machines offered by Chats worth are versatile. The company's

OMR 200 Card Reader, for example, has a card feed rate of sixty cards 
per minute and can read punched, preprinted, or number-two pen- 
cil-marked cards. 

Along these lines, you may now be wondering whether the Apple can 
also process magnetic tape. Not the slow, clumsy cassette tape once used 
with the original Apples in BD (before disks), but rather the tapes nor- 
mally found around a typical computer facility. It would certainly be ad- 
vantageous to be able to work with tape, especially since data important 
to business people is sometimes only available in tape format. For ex- 
ample, it's quite common for mailing lists and census data to be kept in 
mag tape format. In addition, mag tape has always been an inexpensive 
and fast storage medium. It would also be a good way of backing up data 
stored on a hard disk. 

As it turns out, mag tape drives are relatively expensive ($2,000 to 
$3,000), but for certain application areas they can be well worth the in- 
vestment. One manufacturer of such drives for the Apple II, II Plus, and 
lie is Electrovalue Industrial in Morristown, New Jersey. 

A doctor a day keeps your Apple away . . . from the repair shop. 
Now you can take care of your own Apple yourself. What's that, you 
say? You're not qualified? You're a nontechnical-type person? Have no 
fear— let your Apple diagnose its own problems. 

Nikrom Technical Products sells a disk designed to diagnose your 
Apple's technical problems. The disk is inexpensive and works with the 
Apple II, II Plus, or He. The program it contains evaluates your system's 
Monitor, the RAM chips, and the disk drive. There's also a test for 
Hayes Micromodem users. The manual is well written, as is the pro- 
gram. It even provides instructions on how to do various repairs on 
your own. The disk is not an alternative to a service contract or good rap- 
port with your dealer, but it does offer less knowledgeable users a way to 
keep track of the health of their Apples. 

Keep your eyes and ears open for legislation that will bring tax breaks 
to microcomputer owners. The Family Opportunity Act proposes a $100 
annual tax credit to any families that buy a computer for business or 
educational use at home. In fact, the bill also argues for depreciation al- 
lowances. It may not be much, but every litde bit helps. 

The Readers Speak. Dave Howell, a reader in Oklahoma, would 



like to know more about what an Editor is and whether it would be a use- 
ful addition to his software library. 

Basically, an Editor is a computer program designed to allow the user 
to manipulate textual material. While not really word processing pro- 
gramming, an Editor can perform some similar tasks. For example, most 
Editors allow you to add and delete text, replace all instances of a certain 
character within a document with some other character, and so on. An 
Editor usually won't justify the right margin of your text, format a docu- 
ment, or control document printing. 

Editors are often used by programmers. Sometimes, using an Editor 
is a very convenient way of repairing a lengthy program. In other in- 
stances, an Editor must be used to "create a file" in a language that can- 
not normally be run on the computer being used. The "file" is then sent 
to a host machine and the program is executed. This is a common way of 
creating and running programs in Cobol (Common Business Oriented 
Language), the language used for most business applications developed 
to run on a mainframe computer. 

To respond more specifically to Howell's question, an Editor has 
plenty of uses if you're a programmer, fewer if you're strictly a com- 
puter user. If you've been writing some of your own programs or getting 
involved in creating your own files, you're likely to find an Editor pro- 
gram quite helpful. 

Holiday Attractions. By the time you get the next issue, you'll be 
eagerly anticipating the December holidays. (Can we be that close to 
1984? And how close are we to the propositions suggested in the book of

nection - with an intelligent, full 21 2A 300/1200 
baud modem - with a real time clock/calendar - 
and with the capability to expand into a com- 
plete telecommunications system. It's time for 
PRO-MODEM 1200. Much more than just a phone 
modem. 

When you're on-line, time is money. PRO-MODEM 
telecommunication systems help you save. By 
monitoring the duration and cost of your phone 
calls. And by sending and receiving messages, 
unattended, at preset times when the rates are 
lower. . .with or without your computer. 

Compare the $495 PRO-MODEM 1 200 with any other

How TO UNSCI 

YOUR NESl 



It doesn't take a computer to tell 
you that money can't buy you 
happiness. 

But at last there is a piece of per- 
sonal computer software that can make 
you a lot happier about your money. 

And you're looking at it. 

Who needs it? 

Dollars and Sense ' is designed for 
everyone who wonders where their 
money is going. Or why it isn't going 
as far as it used to. Or even as far as it's 
supposed to. 

It's designed for peo- 
ple on a buaget. And for 
people who aren't. 

It's designed for 
people with expense 
accounts. And people 
who just want to 
account for their 
expenses. 

For people who don't 
know a thing about computers. And 
people who know everything. 

For people who can't balance a 
checkbook. And people who can do 
it in their sleep. 

And if you've read this far, it's 
designed for you. 




Where have all the dollars gone? 

Dollars and Sense saves you money 
by organizing your money. By giving 
you the clearest picture you've ever 
nad of your financial behavior. 

You can establish budgets along 
any lines you like. Monthly or annu- 
ally. Fixed or variable. On up to 120 
accounts. 

It can write checks, make transac- 
tions automatically, even remind you 
to pay your bills. 

And as time goes by, it tells you 
exactly how you're doing. With a com- 

□ plete set of reports and 
full-color graphs! 
Year-to-date summa- 
ries. Income statements. 
Balance sheets. Cash 
flow analyses. 
Monthly and yearly 
comparisons of 
where you wanted to 
be vs. where you are. 
You can look into the future to dis- 
cover how much damage that new car, 
new driver, new dress or new baby 
will do to your budget. 

Or look into the past to find out 
anything you like. Like how many bar 




tabs you picked up in February. 
How much unleaded you 
pumped in July. 

Or whether your utility 
bills have gone far enough through the 
ceiling to justify a new roof. 

And all you have to do is spend 
a few minutes each week telling your 
IBM® PC, Apple® II or He what came in 
and what went out. 

Tax break. 

You can use Dollars and Sense 
around the house or around the office. 

And around April 15, you'll be 
glad you did. Because a few simple 
keystrokes will present you with all 
the information you need to satisfy 
Uncle Sam. 

If you do your own Long Forms— 
or your own loan applications— you'll 
save time. If someone else does them 
for you, you'll save money. 

Year after year. 

User friendly. Really. 

Dollars and Sense also happens 
to be very easy to use. For everyone 
who uses it. 

If you're a novice, at computing or 
accounting or both, don't worry. 



The interactive demonstration disk 
will get you started. And the program 
will keep you going. With sample 
accounts, on-screen prompts and two 
different beeps. 

One for typographical errors. And 
another for other kinds of errors. 

As you get faster, so does Dollars 
and Sense. You can enter and edit large 
amounts of information, right on the 
screen. Move from function to function 
without waiting around. And get 
instant, up-to-date reports. 

On screen. Or on paper. 

And one more thing. Dollars and 
Sense is tax-deductible. 

But only if you use it on your taxes.

Last month we took a look at the various aspects of printer hardware, 
such as the paper-out condition, ribbon handling, maintenance tips, and 
DIP switch settings. This time we'll proceed to the second category of 
commonly asked questions about the Epson: printing from program control. 

"Program control" refers to printing under the control of a program 
written in a computer language commonly used on the Apple such as Ap- 
plesoft, Pascal, assembly language, and others. 

All the basic concepts of printing will be covered in this installment, 
including transmission mode, output redirection, embedding, control codes, 
escape codes, and ASCII characters. 

Transmission Mode (Serial or Parallel). To print characters, you 
must send them to an output device. This means that you need not only 



in the Apple, and avoid the expense of a printer interface card, by con- 
necting a couple of wires from the game I/O port of the Apple to a serial 
adapter on the Epson. Instructions on how to do this, and an accompany- 
ing program to print characters, can be found in the user manuals of the 
Big Mac and Merlin assembler programs in the section entitled "Game 
Paddle Printer Driver." 

Output Redirection (PR#). Have you ever wondered why something 
as cumbersome as PRINT CHR$(4);"PR#1 " (or PRINT D$"PR#r', if 
D$=CHR$(4)) must be used when you want to send something to the 
printer? This is especially interesting when you consider that other Basics 
have a much simpler command (such as Iprint, for "line printer"). The 
answer lies in the relative antiquity of the Apple's design.

An Evening with 
Outstanding Cliaracters 



the output device itself, but also a set of wires (a connecting cable) that 
will carry the signals representing characters from the Apple to the out- 
put device. Consider, for example, the monitor (or television set) that 
displays the Apple's output on its screen. The path that the output travels 
from computer to monitor is provided by a cord that is connected to the 
Apple's video output jack at one end and to the monitor's input jack at 
the other. It's also worth noting, in this example, that there is special cir- 
cuitry in the Apple that transforms the "character signals" into a video 
signal that can be displayed on the monitor. 

The printer is coimected to the computer in a similar way. There is 
a cable to carry signals from the Apple to the printer (called an interface 
cable); and there is (usually) a special circuit board (called an interface 
card) in one of the expansion slots of the Apple, which translates the Ap- 
ple's output into a form the printer can use. The cable and card together 
are sometimes called the printer interface. 

There are two main types of printer interfaces: parallel and serial. Most 
printers today expect to receive characters from the computer in parallel 
mode (see figure 1). This means that the character to be sent is represented 
by eight electronic signals, called bits, which are sent over the eight data 
lines of the interface cable simultaneously. The eight bits representing 
a character travel down the eight parallel wires of the cable, one bit in 
each wire. This mode is sometimes referred to as "Centronics compati- 
ble" after a type of printer that was popular at the time the Epson was intro- 
duced. Parallel interfacing is commonly used by printer manufacturers, 
because it is cheaper to build the circuitry required; the main problem 
with parallel interfacing is that you need a complex cable, with ten or 
more wires in it, to connect to the printer. 

It is also possible to run the Epson in serial mode, by using a 
parallel/serial interface adapter (distributed by Epson) that plugs into the 
parallel port in the back of the printer. Serial mode means that the eight 
bits representing a character are sent not side by side, but one after another: 
Thus only one wire is needed, instead of eight (see figure 2). An unex- 
pected advantage to serial interfacing is that it allows us to save a slot 



When the Apple was invented, there were no disk drives for it and 
hence no need for a disk operating system or DOS commands (a tape 
cassette player was the mass storage device). Convenient printer com- 
mands were not high on Apple's list of features either, but designer Steve 
Wozniak did leave a way for output to be controlled. 

After a pathway has been established from your Apple to your printer, 
characters can be sent to the Epson by telling the Apple to redirect character 
input or output (that is, send it somewhere else). The Apple has two 
handy, programmable switches that control where input characters will 
be received from and where output characters will be sent. The input 
control switch is called KSW (for keyboard switch), and the output one 
is CSW (character switch); they are at memory locations $38 and $39 
(KSW) and $36 and $37 (CSW). (The "$" means hexadecimal notation.) 

When you turn on your Apple and press reset before DOS has a chance 
to finish booting, KSW is set to read the keyboard and CSW is set to send 
characters to the screen. If you boot DOS, the switches will be changed 
to cause a detour into DOS (see figure 3). DOS can then check every in- 
put to see if you have typed in or have printed a DOS command. If you 
haven't, the characters will be sent on to the normal screen destination; 
or, if you have entered a DOS command, DOS will execute it. Here is 
a summary of the switches and where your characters go: 

I/O Switches 

Name Meaning Location Points to Points to 

(No DOS) (DOS) 

CSW Character output $36, $37 $FDFO $9EBD and then 

switch $FDFO 

KSW Keyboardinput $38, $39 $FD1B $9E81 and then 

switch $FD1B 

(Note: $FDFO is the address of the screen output routine; $FD1B is the ad- 
dress of the keyboard reading routine.) 

A convention was established with DOS so that, if you print a control-D 



250 



NOVEMBER 1983 



and then a string, DOS will know that you mean the string to be a DOS 
command. If there is no control-D, DOS just passes the string along for 
formal outputting. The print statement, then, must be used to "talk" to 
DOS from Applesoft control. 

Note that a control-D is not needed if you type in a DOS command 
in immediate mode. This is because KSW is set to detour each character 
through DOS as it is typed, so it can be checked, character by character, 
to see if it matches a DOS command. 

There is a fly in the ointment, however. If you use PR#1 instead of 
PRINT D$"PR#r' in a program, you will be unable to execute any DOS 
commands within the program. This is because PR^l is executed by Ap- 
plesoft first (it doesn't get to DOS because it is not in a print statement, 
remember?), which sets CSW to point to slot 1 and the heck with DOS. 
DOS at that point is partially disabled, because the switch that normally 
sends characters from print statements to DOS for command checking 
has been changed to point to slot 1 , before DOS had a chance to do anything 
about it. DOS is unable to intercept any future print commands; hence 
it is unable to execute any DOS commands from your Applesoft program. 



The usual solution for this sorry state of affairs is to give DOS a chance 
to use its own PR# routine (yep, this duplicates the Applesoft PR# com- 
mand) by using PRINT D$' 'PR#1 ' ' . This keeps DOS in control and allows 
it to change the final destination of characters from the screen to the printer 
slot. At the same time, it allows DOS to continue intercepting all print 
statements to check .for DOS commands. 

Another, less familiar solution is to use something like: 

100 PR#1 : CALL 1002 

The call 1002 is to a subroutine at $3EA that reconnects DOS. This 
has the advantage of restoring DOS capabilities within an Applesoft pro- 
gram, without generating a carriage return (as would be caused by a print 
statement). This can prevent your program from scrolling the screen up, 
in case you are trying to do something like a screen dump. 

One advantage of the "change the I/O hooks" method of redirecting 
output is that it is convenient to use with printed output. Other Basics must 
use one command (print) to send output to the screen and another (Iprint) 
to send output to the printer, but with this method, the same conunand

'7 



by Tom Burlew 



The tenuous peace treaty with the 
Machiavellian Cartel has finally failed 
as the Confederation of Planets 
comes under attack from all 
quarters. If that is not enough, the 
treacherous Sadie Empire, although 
claiming neutrality, pursues a covert 
campaign of hostility. You, as the 
captain of the only spaceship fit for 
immediate duty, are charged with 
the military defense of the 
Confederation. 



At your disposal for this task are 
deflector shields, the Positron 
beam, plasma torpedoes, and, if 
you have the courage, the ex- 
perimental Deathray. Beware of 
novas, supernovas, black holes, and 
the mysterious worm holes that 
may transport you anywhere in 
space and time. The fate of the 
galaxy is in YOUR hands! .

(print) can do both. 

Finally, these problems are unique to Applesoft. More recent 
languages have better means of switching back and forth from hard copy 
to screen printing. Pascal, for example, allows you to put the name of the 
output device in front of the string that you want printed: 

WRITELN(OutputDev,'This is a test'); 

Embedding. Once a pathway from your Apple to your printer has 
been established, and output has been redirected to the printer, any print- 
able characters that you send down that pathway will be printed on 
paper. Most printers, however, allow you to go far further than simply 
printing out text. They have various special functions such as emphasis, 
italics, underlining, subscription, and superscription. These special func- 
tions are invoked by sending the printer codes known as escape codes 
and control codes. 

For example, if you send the Epson an ESC (escape) character, you 
will get the Epson's attention: It is programmed to intercept the escape 
character and then wait for the next character to determine which special 
feature you want (the escape and the next character will not be printed) . 
If you then send a capital "E," you will have turned on the emphasis 
mode: Any text sent after that point will be printed out darker than nor- 
mal. Since you communicate with your printer with print statements, the 
escape-E sequence could be sent like this: 

100 BSCS = CHR$(27) : REM Define escape character 

110 PR#1 

120 PRINT ESC$"E" : REM Turn emphasis on 

130 PRINT "THIS IS AN EMPHASIS TEST" 

140 PR#0 

Results: 

THIS IS AN EMPHASIS TEST 

An important point to notice here is that you cannot send an escape 
character to the printer merely by pressing the escape key. This is 
because your Apple is programmed to watch everything you type, in 
order to intercept the escape signal and use it to control various features . If 



you are programming in Applesoft, for example, you will find that es- 
cape enables the I, J, K, and M keys to move the cursor around the 
screen. In addition, there are many more escape coimnands used by your 
Apple, such as escape-E, which is used to clear that portion of the screen 
from the current cursor position to the end of the line. Invalid escape 
commands are simply absorbed and not passed on to the output device. 

This means that the only way you can send the escape character to the 
printer is by using an ASCII code. On page 138 of the Applesoft Basic 
Programming Reference Manual, or page 16 of the lie reference manual, 
you'll see an ASCII chart with escape listed near the bottom left edge of 
the page. You'll see that escape has an ASCII code of 27 assigned to it. 
This means that if you use PRINT CHR$(27), you'll be sending an es- 
cape character to the output device. And, since you are sending it in a 
print statement and not by typing it from the keyboard, it will not be 
intercepted by the Apple. 

In the previous example, we prettied up this process by first defining 
ESC$ = CHR$(27) (line 100) and then using PRINT ESC$ instead of 
PRINT CHR$(27) (line 120). Either way works. 

The emphasis mode can be turned off by sending an escape-F to the 
printer in a manner similar to the way we sent the escape-E. 

100 ESC$ = CHR$(27) : REM Define escape character 

110 PR#1 

120 PRINT ESC$"E" : REM Turn emphasis on 

130 PRINT "THIS IS AN EMPHASIS TEST" 

140 PRINT ESC$"F" : REM Turn emphasis off 

150 PRINT "THIS IS A NORMAL TEST" 

160 PR#0 

Results: 

THIS IS AN EMPHASIS TEST 

THIS IS H NORMAL TEST 

After the Epson receives an escape-F, it turns off emphasis mode and 
prints out all text thereafter in normal mode. 

It is possible with Graftrax 80 and later models to put all of the codes

and text on one line: 

100 ESC$ = CHR$(27) : REM Define escape character 

110 PR#1 

120 PRINTESC$"E", "THISISAN EMPHASISTEST";ESC$"F" 

130 PR#0 

Results: 

THIS IS AN EMPHASIS TEST 

Note that this cannot be done with the original MX-80 and the origi- 
nal MX-100. The turn-off code will cancel the turn-on code, if both oc- 
cur in the same line, thus forcing you to emphasize the entire line. 
Emphasizing individual words is not possible with these two models. 

We can go one step further with our example and include (embed) our 
escape codes right in the middle of our text stream (the string of 
characters we want to print): 

100 ESC$ = CHR$(27) : REM Define escape character 
110 PR#1 

120 PRINT THIS IS AN "; ESC$"E" ; "EMPHASIS ": ESC$"F"; 

"TEST" 
130 PR#0 

Results: 

THIS IS AN EMPHASIS TEST 

Again, this will not work with the original MX-80 or the original 
MX-100, for the reason explained previously. 

The concept of embedding is an important one to grasp, because it is 
the method used by most word processors to send special functions to the 
printer. If you are having difficulty getting your word processor to con- 
trol your printer properly, chances are it is not embedding (or not allow- 
ing you to embed) the proper printer command codes in the text stream. 

There is one other type of printer command code used by the Epson: 
control characters. They are used in much the same way as escape codes: 

100 CN$ = CHR$ (14) : REM Control-N: Turns on expanded mode 



110 CT$ = CHR$(20) : REM ControlT: Turns off expanded mode 

120 PR#1 

130 PRINT "THIS IS AN "; CN$; "EXPANDED"; CT$: " TEST" 

140 PR#0 

Resuks: 

THIS IS AN EXPANDED TEST 

There are many escape and control codes available for your Epson. 
Take a look at the appendixes of your printer manual to see what 
they are. 

Escape Codes, Control Codes, and ASCII Codes. For the sake of 
clarity, a word or two on escape codes, control codes, and ASCII codes 
should be mentioned here. 

If the truth be told, your computer doesn't give a rat's tail about up- 
per case, lower case, underlining, or any other type of character. It cares 
only for numbers (actually electronic signals, but it's easier for us to 
symbolize electrical states with numbers). With numbers, the computer 
can easily add, subtract, compare, move memory, and do all the things 
we have come to know and love, at tremendously high speeds. 

Accordingly, some sort of uniform system must be devised to assign 
a number to every character you want to use. Fortunately, such a system 
was designed some time ago, by a committee also concerned about the 
problem. The committee devised a simple, yet clever, scheme where 
A = 65, B = 66, C = 67, and so on. (In case you're wondering, the con- 
trol characters are at the low end of the code: Control- A = 1, control-B 
= 2, control-C = 3, and so on.) 

The committee gave this code a name, ASCII, which stands for the 
American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Under the ASCII 
system, nearly every conceivable character (plus a few inconceivable 
ones) was given a number. All in all, the committee managed to assign 
numbers to 128 characters, ranging from 0 to 127. This includes 26 
upper-case letters, 26 lower-case letters, 32 control codes, the 10 digits, 
and 34 punctuation and special characters. 

Today, this code is used on nearly every computer (except, of course, 
for IBM, which uses its own standard, EBCDIC), and ASCII charts can 
be found in just about any computer book. The standardization of the 
ASCII scheme allows communication of information between different 
types of computers. 

If you look at the low (0 — 31) end of the ASCII chart, you'll see some 
familiar characters: ESC, CR, BEL, to name a few. This means that, to 
a computer, control characters are valid characters just as text characters 
are. A limited keyboard may force you to resort to some tricks to enter 
the character (such as with PRINT CHR$(27)), but once you get it into 
the computer, it is treated just like any other character. 

Finally, there is another ASCII character set that Apple uses, called 
Apple ASCII, high-bit ASCII, or negative ASCII. The designers of the 
Apple wanted to add fancy flashing and inverse modes to characters 
printed on the screen, so they duplicated the ASCII set by adding 128 to 
each character. The sum of i28 -I- 128 is 256, the maximum number of 
values a byte can represent. 

When you're working with some character charts (such as the ones in 
the back of a printer's user manual), don't be puzzled by a supposed 
ASCII value greater than 127. The true ASCII value and the Apple 
ASCII value represent the same character, and in most cases either will 
work just fine in your programs. To convert from true ASCII to Apple 
ASCII, just add 128 to the true ASCII character value. To convert Apple 
ASCII to true ASCII, subtract 128 from the Apple ASCII character 
value. Here are some examples: 

Character True ASCII Apple ASCII 



CR 13 141 

ESC 27 155 

A 65 193- 

B 66 194 

C 67 195 



Now you see how a printer can be controlled by commands that are 
invisibly embedded in the text it is printing. We have covered only a few 
of the possibilities. In addition to emphasized and expanded printing, 
some Epsons can also do condensed, double-width, or double-strike 
printing; subscripts and superscripts; underlining; intermixed text and 
graphics; and other fancy tricks. Next month, we'll show you how to 
control some of these capabilities. JM

HAHJEN SOFTWARE 



Have you ever read the warranty that comes with Apple DOS 3.3? 
It's quite an eye-opener. It carries the title "Disclaimer of All War- 
ranties and Liability" and reads, in part: "Apple Computer Inc. makes 
no warranties, either express or implied, with respect to this . . . soft- 
ware ... its quality, performance, merchantability, or fitness for any 
particular purpose. Apple Computer Inc. software is sold or licensed 'as 
is.' The entire risk as to its quality and performance is with the buyer. 
Should the programs prove defective following their purchase, the buyer 
. . . assumes the entire cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correc- 
tion and any incidental or consequential damages." 

Five Years or Fifty Thousand Miles? Can you imagine where 
Chrysler would be today with a warranty like this? 

Before you jump to the conclusion that Apple is the only publisher 
with a rotten software warranty, let's admit that just about every soft- 
ware publisher on the face of the earth carries a warranty similar to the 
one above. 

The development of VisiCalc was one of the great intellectual 
achievements of the 1970s. Nonetheless, its publishers don't know 
whether it works or not, according to their warranty— and if it doesn't, 
why, "the entire risk ... is assumed by you." 

Some software companies have apparently realized how ridiculous 
such warranties look. These companies, still unwilling to warrant their 
software, write: "For ninety days from the date of purchase, we warrant 
to the original purchaser that the diskette provided is free from defects in 
material or workmanship under normal use and service." 

Can you imagine the gall it takes for a software company to refuse to 
warrant its own product, the software, and instead warrant the disk, 
which it bought from somebody else? 

Let's hope that the lawyers who reconmiend that software publishers 
use these warranties and that the marketing wizards who accept such 
small legal advice soon come to the ends they deserve. 

All software products should be warranted to perform as described in 
advertising and other documentation. If the software does not perform, 
the publisher should be obligated to supply updated software for no more 
than a nominal (less-than-$10) fee. If a software publisher truly doesn't 
know whether a product works, as claimed in its warranties, it shouldn't 
be in business. 

Perhaps the lawyers would be happier if we did allow the software 
publishers to limit their liabilities. This, however, is a separate issue 
from the warranty. 

No one who buys a program costing less than $500 should expect to 
be able to collect damages in excess of the program's purchase price, 
even if the program is clearly at fault. People who want to be able to col- 
lect indirect and consequential damages shouldn't buy mass-market 
software. 

If there is a software publisher somewhere in the world who thinks he 
or she can justify these rotten warranties, let us hear about it. We'll 
donate space in this column for your point of view. 

Meanwhile, the only hope we have is that as the software business 



gets more competitive, a few publishers will recognize the competitive 
advantages that a real warranty, properly marketed, would bring them. 

Books of Summer. Those of you who didn't have to go to movies or 
computer stores for air-conditioned comfort last summer may have 
missed the new DOS manuals Apple released in late July. There are two 
of them, the DOS User's Manual and the DOS Programmer's Manual. 
They are in the same format as the Apple He manuals— quite nice- 
ly done. 

If you've purchased an Apple disk drive anytime since January 1983, 
you've noticed there was a certificate in the package entitling you to free 
copies of these books. Don't forget to cash the certificate in if you'd like 
to have them. The certificate was supposed to expire in September '83 
but the books weren't available as early as they were expected, so the 
deadline has been extended to next March. If the dealership where you 
bought the disk drive is out, try somewhere else. Any Apple dealer will 
honor the certificate. 

Professional Disk Operating System. During the summer Apple 
also released to software developers a new disk operating system for the 
Apple II series of computers. Apple calls the new system ProDOS. 

ProDOS doesn't make DOS 3.3 obsolete. Apple will continue to 
license DOS 3.3; software developers will no doubt continue to use it. 
But ProDOS is very good— it, too, will be very widely used. Apple plans 
to release ProDOS to the public in early 1984. 

ProDOS commands are for the most part compatible with DOS 3.3 
commands. A few have been removed, however, and others have been 
enhanced. Several completely new commands have been added. There is 
enough compatibility that most Applesoft programs will run without 
modification, but there is enough difference that not all will. 

Note very carefully that word Applesoft. ProDOS doesn't support In- 
teger Basic at all and most assembly language programs will have to be 
modified to work with ProDOS. If you have a large library of Integer 
and assembly language programs, you will probably continue to use 
DOS 3.3 for a long time. Any copy-protected commercial software you 
own will also live out its days under the DOS you bought it with. 

Some other disadvantages of ProDOS are that it requires 64K of 
memory, its files are totally incompatible with DOS 3.3, and a special 
program is required to initialize disks — init is not a ProDOS command. 

About the Pro in ProDOS. But listen to the advantages of ProDOS. 
A new dash command, executed by typing a dash and a file name, will 
run a Basic, binary, or exec file. A new store command will quickly save 
the current values of an Applesoft program's variables. A restore com- 
mand reloads these values into the same or a different program. 

ProDOS automatically clears long Basic programs out of the hi-res 
graphic memory area when it sees an hgr command. This is something 
the programmer has to do when using DOS 3.3. The Applesoft com- 
mands trace and notrace work with ProDOS; they don't work with 
DOS 3.3. 

The ProDOS chain command works correctly with Applesoft pro- 
grams, unlike the DOS 3.3 chain command, which works only with In-

teger Basic programs. The new chain allows a programmer to write Ap- 
plesoft programs that are too large to fit into the computer all at one time. 

Files are compatible with the Apple Ill's Sophisticated Operating 
System. An Apple III SOS disk can be inserted into an Apple n drive and 
data files can be used directly (program files can't, since the two 
machines use different versions of Basic). The Apple III can use ProDOS 
files too. 

ProDOS will work with disks of any size. With DOS 3.3, a hard disk 
has to be initialized to look like thirty or more floppies with different vol- 
ume or drive numbers. With ProDOS a hard disk is treated as one big 
disk. ProDOS works with hard drives as large as thirty-two megabytes 
and files as large as sixteen megabytes (a megabyte is a few bytes more 
than a million). Under DOS 3.3 it is difficult to create files larger than 
130K. But many database applications require much larger files. Under 
ProDOS, you can have them. 

ProDOS overcomes the speed problems of DOS 3.3. ProDOS 
handles files as quickly as the speed-enhanced versions of Apple DOS, 
such as David-DOS, Diversi-DOS, and ProntoDOS. If used on a 128K 
Apple He, ProDOS automatically uses the extra 64K of memory as a 
very high-speed, RAM-based disk drive. ProDOS automatically time- 
stamps files if your computer has a Thunderclock, and it can be adapted 
to other clocks. It also supports interrupts, for those of you who know 
what that means. 

ProDOS uses what's known as a hierarchical file structure. This 
means that a single disk can have many different catalogs. There is one 
main catalog for each disk. The main catalog can hold up to fifty-one of 
the usual kinds of files as well as a new type, a directory file. A directory 
file is a second-level catalog. When you look at one of these subdirec- 
tories, you find more files of any type— possibly including more direc- 
tory files. 

If you were using ProDOS with a word processor, your main catalog 
would probably hold the word processing program itself and several 
directories. One of these directories might be used for business letters. 
The business letter directory could hold a number of other direc- 
tories—one for each of your major clients. You would get to this subdi- 
rectory and its files with a path name. In this case the path name might be 
/wp/bus/acme if you called your word processing disk /wp, your 
business directory /bus, and you had as a client a company named Acme. 
Typing the command catalog /wp/bus/acme would give you a list of the 
files holding your correspondence with that company. 

Path names are wonderful things for people using large storage de- 
vices such as hard disks. Few users of standard floppy drives will ever 
need more than a floppy's main directory, however. Those who have 
been appalled by the rigmarole that the Pascal operating system requires 
of floppy users will be happy to learn that ProDOS is much simpler. 
Typing the standard command catalog,d2 will show you the main catalog 
of the disk in drive 2 no matter what the disk's path name is. Pascal likes 
to give the equivalent of a volume mismatch error unless you spell out 
the disk's name. If you were cataloguing the disk to find out the disk's 
name, you feel like a character in Catch-22. 

ProDOS file names can be only fifteen characters long, as opposed to 
DOS 3.3's thirty-character file names. Because of the subdirectories, 
however, this doesn't seem to be much of a limitation. A path name can 
be as long as sixty-four characters. But ProDOS file names can't include 
any characters other than letters, numbers, or the period. Since the space 
isn't a letter, number, or period, you can't put a space in a file name. The 
user's inability to include spaces within ProDOS file names is a major 
step backward. One hopes there is a good reason for this foolishness. 
Something more than Apple just trying to give ProDOS a more "profes- 
sional" (read nerdish) feel with all those periods. 

ProDOS doesn't require any changes to the disk controller card. It 
uses the same hardware as DOS 3.3. ProDOS appears to be a major de- 
velopment in the world of Apple disk ojjerating systems. Stay tuned for 
further developments. 

Now, Then, about the File Manager. The rest of this month's col- 
umn is a continuation of October's discussion concerning the use of the 
DOS 3.3 file manager directly. As mentioned last month, the book 
Beneath Apple DOS also talks about the file manager, but no other 
publication that we're aware of, including the many from Apple itself, 
says a word about it. 

If you get distracted partway through this stuff, come back next 
month for an elementary and useftil look at text files and how to use themj

with the exec command. 

Last month's column explained what the DOS file manager is, why a 
programmer might want to use it directly rather than using the normal 
DOS commands, and how to get the file manager to do housekeeping 
commands such as delete, lock, rename, and init. 

You tell the file manager what to do by filling in the pigeonholes in a 
table known as the File Manager Parameter List and calling on the file 
manager using a vector in the page three vector table. Last month's col- 
umn included a Basic program that will set up three short assembly 
language routines and three Basic variables that can be used when work- 
ing with the file manager. 

The variables are parm, which is the address of the parameter list; 
neofile, the address to call when you want the file manager to create a 
new file; and oldfile, the address to call for all other uses of the file 
manager. 

Last month's column also included a figure showing what pigeon- 
holes in the parameter list have to be filled in for each of the housekeep- 
ing commands. Figure 1 in this month's column is similar. It shows the 
structure of the parameter list when it is used for file access commands. 

The Commands. There are three file access commands. They are 
read, write, and repaint. The command number is stored in the 
parameter list at parm -1-0. The read and write commands each have four 
subcommands. These are do one byte, do range, repoint and do one byte, 
and repoint and do range. The subcommand codes are placed at 
parm -I- 1, as shown in the figure. 

In Beneath Apple DOS the function called repoint here is called posi- 
tion. Calling it repoint keeps it from getting confiised with the DOS posi- 
tion command. What repoint does is very different from what posi- 
tion does. 

The standard DOS position command is used \yith sequential text files 
to move what is known as the position-in-file pointer ahead (only) a 
specific number of fields. Position works by reading a file beginning at 
the current point and counting carriage returns. Returns are used in se- 
quential files to indicate the end of a field. When the specified number of 
returns have been read, the position command ends with the position-in- 



file pointer set at the first character of the next field. 

Repoint, on the other hand, has nothing to do with counting carriage 
returns. Instead, repoint performs a mathematical calculation to move 
the position-in-file pointer (forward or backward). This calculation is 
based on three variables— the length of the file's records, the record 
number, and the byte offset. 

Programmers who have used random access files will recognize these 
variables as the L specified with the DOS open command and the R and 
B parameters specified with read and write commands. 

The repoint calculation is (L * R) + B. Using the repoint calculation, 
the position-in-file pointer can be instantly moved to any position of any 
record in a file. 

Normally the R and B parameters are used only with random access 
files. However, as far as the file manager is concerned, they can be used 
with any type of file. Normally files other than random access files are 
opened with the L parameter automatically set to one. Thus each char- 
acter in the file can be considered a record. The repoint feature is diffi- 
cult to use with these files because it is hard or impossible to keep track 
of what is at any particular point in the file; nonetheless, if a user wants 
to see a portion of a file beginning at byte 1,000, or any other specific 
byte, it can be done quite easily. 

As shown in the figure, command 10 is repoint only. DOS itself al- 
ways uses this command to repoint the position-in-file pointer for ran- 
dom access files. Interestingly, the read and write subcodes 3 and 4, 
which repoint before reading or writing, are never used by DOS itself. 

Filling in the Parameter List. As you can see in the figure, 
whenever the repoint feature is used, parm -I- 2 must hold a two-byte 
record number and parm -1-4 must hold a two-byte byte offset. The 
numbers you place in these parm locations will be the ones used in the re- 
point calculation. If you are doing a read or write without repoint (sub- 
commands 1 or 2), these pigeonholes do not have to be filled in. 

In fact, if you want to do one-byte reads or writes, the only other 
parts of the parameter list that must be filled in are the buffer addresses at 
parm -I- 12, parm -I- 14, and parm -I- 16. 

If you are reading a file one byte at a time, simply call the file

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? 

Are you tired of waiting for DOS to load and save 
files? Are you tired of waiting for DOS to finish so 
you can type again' Are you tired of waiting for 
your printer' When you buy DIVERSI-DOS", 
by Bill Basham, you won't have to wait any more! 
Here's why: 

1. DOS speed up: Apple DOS 3.3 takes 18 disk 
revolutions to read a single track, whereas 
DIVERSI-DOS reads or writes a track in just 2 
revolutions. This speeds up file processing 
tremendously (see table). 

2. Keyboard Buffer: DIVERSI-DOS allows you 
to type ahead, as fast as you can, without missing 
a single character. 

3. Print Buffer: DIVERSI-DOS can use a RAM 

card (16K 128K) to temporarily save characters 
before they are printed. Thus, your computer 
won't have to wait for your printer to finish. 

4. DDMOVER: DIVERSI-DOS can now be 

moved to a RAM card to increase the available 
memory in a BASIC program. 

DIVERSI-DOS, the QUADRUPLE utility, 
requires a 48K Apple II, 11+ or e with DOS 3.3. A 
simple, menu driven installation program is 
included on the un protected disk. So what are 
you waiting for?

manager, check the error code, and retrieve your byte from parm + 8. If 
you are writing one byte at a time, place the byte you want to write at 
parm + 8 before calling the file manager. 

One-byte reads and writes are what DOS itself uses when working 
with text files. All of the overhead inherent in calling the file manager 
occurs for each character in the file. This may give you some idea why 
text file handling is so slow. 

Note that when you are using the file manager's read and write com- 
mands, you do not have to give a file name address. You may wonder 
how the file manager knows which of the files on your disk you want to 
read from or write to. 

The particular file is determined by the buffers you point to with 
parm +12, parm +14, and parm +16. You must open a file before you 
can read or write to it, just as with normal DOS. The buffers you use 
when you open the file and the buffers you use when you read or write 
must be the same ones. When you are finished with a file you must 
use the file manager's close command to finish the processing of 
the file. 

DOS itself handles binary and Basic files as snapshots of memory 
ranges. When reading or writing a range, a two-byte range length is 
placed in parm +6 and a two-byte range address is placed in parm + 8. 
These are the same as the A and L parameters you are probably used to 
working with when saving binary files. 

Using normal DOS, it is impossible to read only a portion of a binary 
file. Using the repoint feature of the file manager directly, a user can em- 
ploy the read-range or write-range routines to gain fast access to any part 
of any kind of file. 

File Manager Errors. You may remember from our discussion last 
month that the file manager doesn't take a file's type very seriously. 
When you specify a type^ he dutifully stores it in the catalog with other 
information about the file. However, as far as the file manager is con- 
cerned, all files are one type. It is the Captain who distinguishes between 
file types, who sends us file type mismatch errors, and who stores ad- 
dress and length information at the beginning of Basic and binary files. 

Other errors that are the personal property of the Captain are lan- 
guage not available, no buffers available, program too large, not direct 
command, and the ever-popular syntax error. The file manager will 
never send you any of these. For the record, figure 2 contains the error 
conditions the file manager will return. 

The file manager's end-of-data error occurs only when there are no 
further sectors in a file. The Captain will also give you an end-of-data er- 
ror if he encounters a zero in a text file as he is passing it to you one 
byte at a time. The file manager doesn't care if there are zeros in 
a file. 



Note that the file manager does no checking to see if the numbers you 
pass him in the parameter list make sense, except for the conmiand and 
the subcommand. The file manager has no syntax error. If you give him 
a nonsense number he proceeds on his merry way until the system 
crashes or your disk is ruined. Figure 3 shows some limits you should be 
aware of. 

When using the table in figure 3, pay particular attention to the upper 
limits on record length, record number, and byte offset. While 32,767 
probably seems ample for any possible use, remember that nonran- 
dom-access files have the record length set to one. Thus, if the file is 
longer than 32,767 bytes (130 sectors), the record number can exceed 
the upper limit shown here. If it does, the file manager's repoint calcula- 
tion fails because of an overflow error. However, he doesn't notice it and 
will blindly move the position-in-file pointer to the wrong place. If you 
find a use for repoint with nonrandom files, use care when the files be- 
gin to get long. 

This completes our discussion of the DOS file manager. Next month 
we're going to begin a study of text files by looking closely at the exec 
command. See you then.

MAKING SOFTWARE 

m THE CDMPAMY 

The Custom Cimneclion 

By Jerry Kapp 



So, you've had your computer for a while and it's done everything 
the salesman said it could. Even installing and using it has been easier 
than you thought possible. And his advice to use off-the-shelf programs 
has paid off. These packaged programs have kept the costs of computer- 
izing your business to a minimum. They've also made it possible to be up 
and running on your computer the first time you turned it on. 

However, you have become aware that packaged software no longer 
meets all your needs. Something seems to be missing. You have a feeling 
that profits could be greater if only you could get a few more features or 
specialized programs. Finding the specialized programs you need would 
seem like a simple, straightforward operation. Yet, there is no easy way 
to get them. 

What can you do? Your first reaction, and a logical choice, may be to 
call a data processing consultant. But before you reach for the phone and 
call your local computer expert, consult your in-house business special- 
ist. That's right. You know what your company needs, and therefore you 
are the ideal choice to define all program requirements. This may seem 
obvious. Yet many businessmen fail to take charge of defining what any 
new programs should do. Instead, they rely on consultants for all the 
answers. 

Although most data processing consultants are professionals, you 
must have some idea of what your company needs before you make the 
call for help. As a matter of fact, the better you understand what goes 
into making a good program, the more you'll get for your money. And 
best of all, you may even find that a consultant or a new program isn't 
necessary. Instead, the answer may be as simple as improving the ex- 
isting procedures. 

The following guidelines will eliminate most problems that normally 



occur in selecting or developing programs. In addition, these simple 
steps will allow you to save time and money and will help you get just 
what you want from your computer. So let's begin by reviewing the 
outline. 

I. Initial planning 

A. Don't be afraid of the problem 

B. Make a general outline of what you need 

C. Collect information 

D. Review the outline 

II. Detail planning 

A. Prepare a detail plan of what must be done 

B. Determine the installation steps and responsibilities 

C. Estimate the value of these programs to your company 

D. Estimate the cost of the programs 

E. Research all the alternatives 

in. Installation and testing 

A. Complete the design 

B. Purchase programs; hire consultant; hire 

contract programmer 

C. Prepare for testing 

D. Test and evaluate the results 

IV. Acceptance 

A. Install the approved programs 

B. Change over to the new programs 

C. Review the completed project 



Initial Planning. What is your goal? Is it to provide better customer 
service? Do you need to reduce inventory without affecting the current 
level of business? Are you looking for a program that will show you the 
management information you need, the way you need it? 

Sounds confusing, doesn't it? Well, don't worry. Fearing that a busi- 
ness problem is too complex to solve is normal. Overcoming this fear 
will require that you believe and trust your own judgment. This will 
come about as you define exactly what you need. 

Your first step is to make a list of all the things that will help your 
company solve existing problems. Next, determine which of these things 
can be done on the computer and assign a priority to them. Then tackle 
the high-priority programs first and begin planning. 

Begin the planning phase by writing a general outline of what you 
want to accomplish with the finished program. After you've done this, 
gather all the information needed to complete the job. For example, 
you'll need copies of existing forms and reports. You'll also need to list 
existing procedures that go with the job or decide on new procedures. 
This outline and the information you gather will be used in each of the 
following steps; they'll be the basis for program development. 

Before you continue you should review your outline. Does it need 
any revising? The more time you spend planning and deciding what must 
be done, the greater the success of any project. And that's what you're 
really after. 

Detail Planning. Now that you're sure of what you need, make 
another, more detailed list of what you expect the program to do. And 
don't take anything for granted. (It can be costly to omit even a minor 
feature, especially when you are planning to hire a programmer.) 
Although you can't think of everything, most oversights can be avoided 
by reviewing your current business forms and procedures. These forms 
may also help you find other ways to make improvements. 

Even though these forms can help you design a system, there is one 
important thing to remember: You must design the system to fit the per- 
son using it. Make it familiar. Be sure the terminology used on the screen 
and in any printed reports is consistent with existing programs and proce-

dures. Keep in mind that people are different. If the person who'll op- 
erate the system is technical, use the technical terms he is accustomed to. 
If an average clerk is to use the program, skip the technical jargon and 
use words he is familiar with. 

After you've completed your design, the next, perhaps the most dif- 
ficult, step will be placing a dollar value on the new program or pro- 
grams. What are they worth to you? How much time and money can be 
saved by using this new system? Try to m£ike your estimates as realistic 
as possible. This means taking the time to evaluate all the benefits, some 
of which won't be apparent at first glance. 

Another area requiring a lot of thought is estimating the cost of de- 
veloping new programs. Besides the cost of programming, you must also 
include the cost of manual preparation. It may come as a surprise, but 
there is often more time and money spent gathering the required informa- 
tion than there is on developing the new programs. One way to estimate 
the cost is to assign difficulty factors to each new program. These factors 
appear in the accompanying chart. 

This chart was devised to help you estimate the amount of work re- 
quired to write a program. You should use it as a guideline only. Because 
this is a general guideline, each program must be reviewed for specific 
problems that may reduce or increase the cost. 

Using this guideline is quite simple. Each point is equal to one hour 
of work. To estimate the program cost, all you have to do is multiply the 
total points by the hourly rate of contract programmers in your area. 
Now decide whether it's worthwhile to continue or whether the program 
will cost too much to develop. If it still seems like a good idea, get ready 
to request bids. 

Before requesting bids from consultants or programmers, make sure 
your outline contains enough detail and matches the needs of your com- 
pany. To help ensure success you must define each step, decide what 
must be done, and determine who is responsible. You must also specify 
the type of computer and other hardware you are currently using. 

Besides giving the consultants information, you'll need some answers 
yourself. Be sure to ask which programming language they will use to 
write the programs. The most popular and commonly used languages are 
Basic, RPG, Cobol, and Pascal. If they use one of these, it will not be 
difficult to find someone to make program changes in the future. You 
should also find out if they provide installation plaiming, user training, 
documentation, and any conversion programs that may be necessary. 
And, above all, don't forget to ask for references. 

Once you have all the answers you need, you can decide which com- 
pany should do the work. Watch out for the good deal. If one bid appears 
quite a bit better than the others, it could be missing something. Compare 
the bids and award the contract to the company that offers a better value. 
This may be the higher bid, but you're looking for support from the com- 
pany long after the job is completed. Follow your instincts, as you must 
feel comfortable working with the consultant or programmer. Working 
with someone who makes you uneasy may cause you to overlook some 
very important features. 

After you've decided who will do the programming, you'll need to 
keep in touch with them regularly. In addition to phone calls, try to set up 
review meetings. These meetings will help you avoid surprises. They'll 
let you know if the project is on schedule and allow you to head off prob- 
lems before they occur. The key to success in this phase is constant 
communication. 

Installation and Testing. You're probably getting impatient by now. 
But you must allow plenty of time to test the new programs. Testing is 
the second most important step in getting the programs you need. The 
first, of course, is planning. Testing is boring and tedious; it involves 
checking and rechecking of reports and data. 

All program tests should use actual, everyday input from your busi- 
ness. Another test is to check each field or operation to ensure that it can 
handle both the minimum and maximum values. Make sure the program 
checks and accepts only the valid input. This will keep the garbage out of 
your computer. 

It is equally important to follow up on every step. Make sure you stay 
in charge of the project, including planning for the manual controls of the 
new programs. This control is a crosscheck to make sure the programs 
are working correctly. 

In addition to controls, you'll need an emergency plan. This plan will 
be used when the computer is down or when files are destroyed. Even if 
files are destroyed, you'll not necessarily be out of business as long as 



NOVEMBER 1983 S Q P T A 



you have a working backup plan. This plan may require you to back up 
your files daily and have two sets of backup disks or tapes. These disks 
should be switched every time you make a new backup. This way, if one 
set of files is damaged or lost you'll have another to operate with. If you 
use this approach or one similar, you can feel comfortable that your files 
are safe. This emergency plan can be improved significantly by keeping 
the two file backups at different locations. 

Acceptance and Payment. Most consultants expect some type of 
payment before the work begins. This payment usually falls into one of 
the following categories: 10 percent of the price of the program when the 
work begins; 40 percent of the program price on installation; or 50 per- 
cent of the program price upon acceptance. 

Or, if you are requesting modification of existing programs, you can 
expect to pay the following rates: 50 percent of the modification price 
when the work begins; or 50 percent of the price upon acceptance. 



EIP 269 

Try to avoid making the final payment until you're sure the program 
works. If the program is used regularly, hold off payment for one week. 
And, if the program is used less frequently, you may want to withhold 
payment for one month. 

Installing the Programs. With the testing completed, you can now 
install the new programs. Make sure that everyone who'll be using the 
programs has been properly trained. And after the programs have been 
accepted and running for several days, plan a follow-up meeting. Have 
the users give their comments on the new programs. How do they feel 
about them? Now is a perfect time to reevaluate the costs and benefits. 
Has it been a success? 

As we all know, the computer is a tool that can be used by practically 
anyone for just about anything. And you can have just the programs 
you've been looking for. All you have to do is make your plan, follow 
the guidelines, trust yourself, and stay in charge.

ALGEBRA GOES ELECTRONIC! 




ALGEBRA ARCADE was created by math instructors 
and student-tested for four years. It's educational 
software that really works. 

Ten Algebroids on a coordinate system, the villainous 
Graph Gobbler and suddenly algebra is a 
game! Students enter in an algebraic equation and 
the resulting graph zaps the Algebroids and racks 
up points— but watch out for the Graph Gobbler! 
Collide with him and you lose points and up to three turns. 

The ALGEBRA ARCADE is challenging to math 
students of every skill level. Beginners enjoy 
playing with simple straight lines while math 
sophisticates can create complicated curves 
using the ten algebraic functions included in / 
the game (sine^ cpsine, tangent, etc.).

SOFKIARD 
Symposhim 

by Greg Ilbbetts 



i 



Welcome to the November installment of 
SoftCard Symposium. This month we'll finish 
our coverage of the BIOS disk I/O routines and 
at the same time wrap up our year-long discus- 
sion of the BIOS in depth. 

During this last year, we have learned a con- 
siderable amount about CP/M and the structure 
of the routines necessary to implement CP/M 
on computers in general and on the SoftCard in 
particular. This final installment will consist of 
a detailed description of the SoftCard read/ write 
routines. Reader familiarity with the general de- 
scription presented last month will be assumed. 

The READ routine is located at 0DD93H in 
56K, immediately following the SETDMA 
routine. Its first action is to zero the variable 
UNACNT, which we described last time as the 
count of unwritten, unallocated sectors in a 
series of sector writes. We must zero this 
variable now, since the fact we are doing a read 
means that we're obviously no longer writing 
consecutive sectors to an unallocated data 
block. The next write, then, will see this 
variable with its zero value and know what has 
happened. 

READ'S next action is to load the value for 
an unallocated write (value 2, remember?) into 
the accumulator (register [A]). All three action 
flags-READOP, WRTYPE, and RSFLAG- 
are then set to this value. As we said last month, 
the READOP and RSFLAG variables are sim- 
ple zero/nonzero flags, whUe WRTYPE is sup- 
posed to contain the type of write. The locations 
of these and other variables we'll be discussing 
' are shown in the accompanying table. 

It's important for many of these variables to 
reside in consecutive memory locations and this 
arrangement is easier to see when conveyed in 
tabular form. 

Let's talk about why the READOP, 
RSFLAG, and WRTYPE flags are set. 
READOP is the flag that tells BIOS in which di- 
rection the data is to be transferred — user 
memory to host buffer (write) or host buffer to 
user memory (read). This flag is nonzero when 
a read operation is to be made and zero when a 
write operation is to be made. RSFLAG is the 
indication to BIOS that, whatever operation 
may be going on between user memory and the 
host buffer, a disk read to fill the host buffer 
with data must be performed before it. This 



would, for example, need to be done when a 
disk sector that had already been allocated was 
being written to for the first time and the host 
buffer needed to be initialized with the disk sec- 
tor's contents. 

Since we're dealing with read operation, 
though, why set RSFLAG? The answer, of 
course, is that we'll use one routine to service 
both read and write. If the drive, track, and 
physical sector for this read don't match those 
for the last disk access, we know that the host 
buffer is not filled with the disk sector we wish 
to read from; and we know that we'll therefore 
have to do an actual disk read. Since we do not 
know at this time whether we have a match, set- 
ting RSFLAG ensures that if we don't, a pre- 
read of the disk will be performed to validate 
the host buffer. 

Now we know why READOP and RSFLAG 
have been set, but why set WRTYPE? The 
answer again lies in the way that the common 
read/ write routine is structured. At the very end 
of the common read/ write process, a check is 
made to see whether a directory write has been 
called for. If so, the host buffer is immediately 



written to disk (that is, a value of 1 in the 
WRTYPE variable causes an immediate disk 
write of the host buffer). A WRTYPE value of 
0 or 2 causes no such immediate write, defer- 
ring it until the next disk operation. By placing 
the value of 2 in all flags, we set those that 
simply need to be nonzero, and we also ensure 
that WRTYPE will cause no unnecessary disk 
activity. After setting all three flags to this 
value, READ jumps to the common routine 
RWOPER. Since WRITE also winds up here, 
we'll examine the WRITE routine before going 
on to the common one. 

The WRITE routine, located at 0DDA3H, 
immediately follows READ'S jump to 
RWOPER. First it sets up the three action flags 
by loading the actual type of write (0, 1, or 2), 
supplied in the [C] register by BDOS, into 
register [H] and a zero into register [L]. Since 
READOP and WRTYPE are located consecu- 
tively in memory, loading READOP with the 
register pair [HL] sets both of these flags to 
their proper values: READOP becomes 0 for a 
write operation and WRTYPE contains the val- 
ue supplied by BDOS (remember that six-

teen-bit memory stores are done low byte first, 
meaning that [L] goes into the first memory lo- 
cation and [H] into the second) . 

Next, WRITE checks to see what type of 
write BDOS was actually trying to perform. 
From our discussion last month, you'll recall 
that while BDOS only informs BIOS of an unal- 
located write during the first subsector of a new 
data block, the BIOS can detect all unallocated 
sectors of that block and save much time by 
avoiding unnecessary prereads. If BDOS says 
that the write is to an allocated block, therefore, 
the BIOS must be suspicious and make further 
tests on its own. 

In fact, this is exactly what happens. The 
BIOS checks the value passed in register [C], 
and, if a 0 or a 1 is found, an immediate jump is 
made to the check-for-more-unallocated-sectors 
routine, CHKUNA. Since CHKUNA will even- 
tually be executed anyway, we'll assume that 
the value in register [C] was 2, meaning that 
this is the first sector of a new allocation block. 
And that way, we can look at the rest of 
WRITE. 

In such a case, then, WRITE loads the [L] 
register with a value of 8 (the number of subsec- 
tors in an unallocated data block) and the [H] 
register with the drive number that BDOS is 
requesting (SEKDSK, remember?). The [HL] 
pair is then stored in the variable UNACNT, 
thereby placing 8 into UNACNT and the seek- 
drive number into UNADSK, which immedi- 
ately follows it. The [HL] pair is then loaded 
from SEKTRK and stored in UNATRK. Since 
track and sector numbers in the SoftCard BIOS 
are only single-byte numbers, this load opera-

tion gets the seek-track into [L] and the 
seek-sector into [H], storing these two values in 
their unallocated counterparts. At this point, all 
the unallocated variables (those starting with 
UNA) have been initialized, and control simply 
falls through to CHKUNA. 

The first action of CHKUNA, which is 
located at ODDBDH, is to check the unallocated 
sector count (UNACNT) and see if any more 
unallocated subsectors remain in this block. Re- 
member that BDOS now thinks of this block as 
totally allocated. It is the BIOS that is keeping 
track of which parts of it are allocated and 
which are not. If there are no more unallocated 
subsectors, then BIOS knows BDOS is truly re- 
questing a write to a fully allocated data block. 
This being the case, a preread may be necessary 
(provided that we have not already done one on 
the last write). In this case, then, control is 
passed to a routine called ALLOC, located at 
ODDECH. 

If, on the other hand, unallocated subsectors 
remain to be written, CHKUNA decrements 
UNACNT and then checks the seek-drive num- 
ber against the unallocated drive number. If 
these two numbers do not match, then— regard- 
less of the number of unallocated subsectors re- 
maining— BDOS will have switched drives 
since the last write and a preread will very like- 
ly be required. Control, therefore, passes to 
ALLOC. In the same manner, the seek-track 
and seek-sector are compared to the unallocated 
track and unallocated sector. If an unmatched 
pair is ever found, a preread will probably be 
required and control will pass to ALLOC. 

If all unallocated variables match all seek 
variables, however, then BIOS can be sure that 
this is simply a write to the next unallocated sec- 
tor in the series and that no preread will be 
needed. In such a case, the unallocated sector 
number is incremented and the track number is 
incremented as well if the sector number goes 
beyond the end of the track (although in systems 
like SoftCard, where allocation blocks never 
overflow from one track to another, this does 
not need to be done). Having updated 
UNATRK and UNASEC for next time, 
CHKUNA clears the action flag RSFLAG to 
zero, showing that no preread should occur, and 
a jump is made to RWOPER. 

Should something not have matched during 
the check of unallocated variables, a jump 
would have been made to ALLOC. ALLOC has 
two very simple duties. First, it clears the unal- 
located sector count to zero. This is done so that 
future calls to the BIOS WRITE routine, and 
thereby to the CHKUNA routine, will have to 
receive an unallocated write-type value from 
BDOS before starting the countdown process 
again. The next thing ALLOC does is to set 
RSFLAG to 1 , to show that a preread is prob- 
ably needed in this case. Once this has been 
done, control simply falls through to RWOPER 
at 0DDF2H. 

RWOPER is the common routine we have 
talked about so much these last two months. 
This routine is the one that takes the information 
passed on in the action flags and drive/track/ 
sector variables and uses it to transfer data be- 
tween buffers, fill and empty the host buffer 
from disk, and keep track of the status flags. 

In version 2.20B, RWOPER starts out with 



a corrective patch. The patch itself is located at 
the very end of the disk code at ODFFOH, and it 
is really very simple. In the very first version of 
the SoftCard BIOS, it was found that the carry 
flag was not always cleared on entry to 
RWOPER, and this, as you will see, could have 
some bad effects. The patch therefore simply 
corrects that problem by always clearing the 
carry flag immediately. 

The first action of RWOPER is to load the 
seek-sector number, called CPMSEC, into reg- 
ister [A]. This number is then also loaded into 
register [E] for safekeeping, and the carry flag 
is cleared. Next an RRA instruction that divides 
the sector number by two is executed. This 
gives us the physical sector number, since we 
know that there are two 128-byte subsectors in 
each of the Apple's 256-byte physical sectors. 
Register [A], therefore, now contains the 
logical sector number in the range used on the 
Apple disk. 

Before the value stored in register [A] will 
be in a form we can give to RWTS, however, 
we must take care of translating the three-sector 
interleave in use by SoftCard CP/M into the 
two-sector interleave in use by RWTS— the log- 
ical to physical translation process. So, this is 
the next operation performed by RWOPER. It 
loads the address of the sector translation table, 
XL AT at 0DE92H, into the [HL] register pair 
and then adds the logical sector number in [A] 
to register [L] so that the [HL] pair now points 
to the entry in the table corresponding to the 
correct sector number needed by RWTS. This 
value is loaded into register [C] for use later if 
needed. 

Next, RWOPER checks the status flag, 
HBFACT. This flag, as you'll recall, tells us 
whether the host buffer is active (that is, wheth- 
er it contains valid data corresponding to a sec- 
tor on the disk) and whether the host variables 
(those beginning with HST) identify the drive, 
track, and sector numbers of that disk sector. If 
HBFACT is set, the host buffer is active; if 
HBFACT is clear, then the host buffer is not 
active. 

It's important to remember that HBFACT 
says nothing about whether the data in the host 
buffer exactly matches the data in the cor- 
responding disk sector, since we may have 
changed some of that data in a previous subsec- 
tor write. The best way to describe the arrange- 
ment is simply to say that, when active, the host 
buffer contains some valid data and that the host 
variables are the disk location to which the data 
is to go. RWOPER then checks the HBFACT 
status flag to see if the host buffer is active. (It 
should be noted here that, while most systems 
use a full set of host variables, SoftCard uses 
only HSTDSK; because of the way in which 
RWTS is set up, the necessary information is al- 
ready stored in memory in 6502 page 00 for 
RWTS to use. This being the case, whenever 
host variables for track and sector need to be 
checked, these variables are used instead. They 
are shown in the accompanying table and begin 
with A$.) 

If the host buffer and variables are not ac- 
tive, then BIOS knows that the values in the host 
variables are meaningless and that the contents 
of the host buffer are invalid. In this case, no 
care need be taken to preserve any of their con-

tents. If, on the other hand, the buffer and 
variables are active, then BIOS knows that the 
variables point to a specific disk sector and that 
the buffer contains the contents of that sector, 
either modified or unmodified. The next action 
of RWOPER, then, must be to determine the 
condition of the buffer and its variables. If 
they're inactive, then regardless of whether the 
current operation is a read or a write, the buffer 
must be made active by setting the variables and 
going on to do a preread if BDOS is requesting 
a subsector read, a write to an allocated sector, 
or a write to the directory. For an unallocated 
write, only the variables need to be set, since no 
preread is needed. 

If, on the other hand, the host buffer and 
variables are active, then BIOS must take care. 
The buffer may contain information that has 
been altered by a subsector write but not yet 
written to disk, meaning that no disk read can 
take place. Or the fact that the host buffer and 
variables are active may simply mean that the 
proper physical sector for a subsector read or 
write is already in the host buffer. Simply 
stated, if the buffer is active, then BIOS must 
perform many checks on its status; if not, BIOS 
may do whatever it wants and be completely un- 
mindful of the condition of the buffer. 

It should be obvious by now that, regardless 
of whether the buffer is active or inactive, it 
must become active as a result of the current op- 
eration. A write would install data into it and set 
the host variables to the disk sector to be writ- 
ten, while a read (or preread) would set the host 
variables and fill the buffer from the disk. 

RWOPER, then, after loading and preserv- 
ing the current value of HBFACT in register 
[A], sets HBFACT to 1— to show that it will be- 
come active. When this has been done, 
RWOPER examines the flag. An inactive buffer 
(HBFACT =0) causes a jump to a routine called 
FILHST, located at 0DE21H. FILHST takes 
care of setting the host variables to match the 
seek variables and filling the host buffer with 
data from the disk if necessary. An active buffer 
(HBFACT = 1) causes the jump to FILHST to 
be ignored. 

Let's assume for the moment that 
HBFACT = 1 , the buffer is active, and the jump 
to FILHST has been ignored. RWOPER 's next 
task is to check the seek variables for drive 
and sector number. Any unmatched pair causes 
a jump to NOMATCH at ODE 1 AH. If all vari- 
ables match, then a jump is made to MATCH at 
0DE4DH. Let's also assume, then, that some- 
thing in these three variables does not match 
and that we arrive at the NOMATCH routine. 
BIOS knows that the host buffer is valid, mean- 
ing that there may be unwritten valid data in it. 
The first task of NOMATCH, then, must be to 
find out whether there is. This is where the 
SECMOD flag comes in. This flag, you'll re- 
call, is set when the host buffer has had a sub- 
sector moved into it from user memory (a sub- 
sector write) and cleared when the host buffer 
gets written to disk. 

By checking SECMOD, therefore, NO- 
MATCH determines whether it must write out 
the buffer to disk before proceeding with the 
current operation. If so, it calls the WRITEHST 
subroutine at 0DE73H to write out the host 
buffer to the drive, track, and sector number 



specified in the host variables. When the return 
from WRITEHST is made, the host buffer is no 
longer valid (remember that the host variables 
did not match the seek variables, so the sector 
contained in the host buffer is not the one BDOS 
is looking for). Since the host buffer is not ac- 
tive, we now have the same condition that we 
would have had if HBFACT had been clear. 
Control therefore is allowed simply to fall 
through to FILHST. Had SECMOD not been 
set, then BIOS would have known that even 
though the host buffer was active, nothing had 
been modified and no write to disk was needed. 
In that case control would have passed through 
directly to FILHST. Either way, FILHST gets 
executed if all of the seek and host variables do 
not match. For that reason, we'll take it up next. 

As we've said, FILHST is responsible for 
setting the host variables and filling the host 



buffer if necessary. The first host variable to set 
up is the CP/M drive number from 0 to 15 for 
drives A: through P:. To do this, FILHST sets 
HSTDSK equal to SEKDSK and also saves the 
CP/M drive number in register [B]. Then using 
the drive number, FILHST derives the .special 
drive and slot numbers needed by Apple's 
RWTS. RWTS requires the slot number times 
16 (60H, 50H, 40H, and so on) and needs to 
know whether the drive in that slot is drive 1 or 
drive 2. 

Calculating the drive number is rather sim- 
ple. FILHST performs a logical AND operation 
between the drive number and 1. An odd 
number (bit 0 set) leaves a value of 1 , while an 
even number (bit 0 clear) leaves a value of 0. 
Since RWTS needs a drive number of 1 or 2, 
the result of the AND operation is incremented 
and stored in the host variable for drive number

Calculating the slot number is a slightly 
more complex operation. First of all, the drives 
with the lowest CP/M drive numbers are lo- 
cated in slot 6, the next lowest in slot 5, and so 
on, meaning that slot numbers decrease as drive 
numbers increase. Second, we rnust take into 
account that there are two drives for each slot. 
And third, the result must be the slot number 
times 16. We could just take the drive number, 
divide it by 2, and then subtract the new number 
from 6 to get the actual slot. The result could 
then be multiplied by 16 to get a slot number for 
RWTS to use. SoftCard's BIOS designer chose 
a somewhat different route, however. It is con- 
siderably more complex, and explaining it will 
involve getting back into some of the basics of 
binary arithmetic. There's good information 
here, though, so we'll take the time and space to 
go through it. Basically, what happens is that 
the drive number is multiplied by 8 (which ac- 
tually represents dividing the number by 2 and 
multiplying the result by 16) so that we already 
have the drive number in the "times 16" form 
that RWTS needs. This result is then subtracted 
from the value for slot 6 in RWTS form. Let's 
look at the process in detail. 

First, FILHST reloads the [A] register with 
the original CP/M drive number from register 
[B]. Because we will be multiplying this num- 
ber by 8 rather than dividing by 2 and then mul- 
tiplying by 16, we must first get rid of bit 0 of 
the number (the division by 2 would have re- 
moved the 0 if we'd done it the other way) and 
make the drive number an even value. We do 
this by rounding it down to the closest even 
value via a logical AND with the number 14. 
Since 14 is 00001110 binary, and since our 
drive number can be a maximum of (X)001 111 
binary, you can see that the only effect this 
rounding has is to decrement any odd number 
while leaving even numbers alone (4 remains 4, 
for example, while 5 becomes 4, and so on). 

At the end of this operation, then, the drive 
number is 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14. This val- 
ue is then multiplied by 8. This is done by add- 
ing the number to itself three times (remember 
from our discussion of binary arithmetic that 
adding a number to itself is equivalent to multi- 
plying it by 2, since all bits are shifted one place 
to the left. Doing this three times, therefore, is 
the same as multiplying by 2 to the third power, 
or 8). 

FILHST now has the drive number divided 
by 2 and multiplied by 16. It next takes this val- 
ue and complements it. As we also discussed 
before, this simply means that all 0 bits are 
made Is and all 1 bits are made Os. In this case, 
complementing this number is equivalent to 
making it the negative of itself, — 1 . This may 
be difficult to see if you're unfamiliar with bi- 
nary arithmetic, since in decimal arithmetic this 
is not a common process. Fortunately, though, 
it is easy to demonstrate. 

Suppose we wished to create a binary —2 in 
eight bits. We could do so two ways. First we 
could start with 0 and decrement it two times; 
00000000 would become 11111111 at the first 
decrement and then 11111110 at the second 
decrement. The resulting number in hex is 
OFEH. An easier way, however, might be to 
start widi a binary 2 (00000010), complement it 



to make 11111101, and then add 1 to make 
11111110. This is known as the two 's comple- 
ment (the one 's complement being the simple 
complement operation we did without adding 1 ) , 
and it is the accepted method of creating nega- 
tive numbers in binary. 

Either way, then, we end up with the same 
number, OFEH. Some of you will be quick to 
point out that OFEH is 254 in decimal, while we 
seem to be calling it -2. You are right, of 
course. However, these are actually two dif- 
ferent numbers, and the difference lies in what 
we assume is the value of bits we cannot see that 
extend (into infinity) to the left of the number. 

As is so with other types of numbers, every 
binary number contains digits to the left of those 
we see that can be said to go on into infinity. 
The decimal number 100, for example, has an 
infinite number of zeros to the left of it that we 
do not show. If we assume our eight-bit, OFEH 
example that all the bits we cannot see beyond 
the eight we show are zeros, then the number is 
254. If, on the other hand, we assume that those 
bits are all ones, the number is —2. You see, 
when we decremented the binary number 
00000000 before, we did not just change the 
eight Os into eight Is. In fact, we changed an in- 
finite number of Os into an infirute number of 
Is. Lucky for us, we do not have to show these 
bits, since binary arithmetic works just fine 
when limited to the set number of bits in the val- 
ues we are working with. We can just ignore, 
then, all those Is out there beyond the eight we 
are looking at. 

Suppose, for example, that we wished to 
subtract 2 from 16. In binary, we would have 
OOOIOOOOB representing the 16. No matter what 
fancy sorts of things we say about infinite Is 
and Os, we must come up widi 14 (00001 1 lOB) 
as an answer to 16 minus 2. Arithmetic is arith- 
metic, after all. The minus 2, then, is represent- 
ed as 1 1 1 1 1 1 lOB, or OFEH, and we add that 
number to the value 16, shown below as 
OOOIOOOOB. 

The rules of binary addition are rather sim- 
ple: 0 plus 0 equals 0, with no carry to the left; 
0 plus 1 equals 1 ; likewise no carry to the left; 
and, finally, 1 plus 1 equals 0, with a carry of 1 
to the left. In the case where there is a carry, all 
three bits are added in the next position, as 
follows (the symbol cy represents the 1 bit that 
is the carry from the previous pxjsition): cy plus 

0 plus 0 equals 1, with no further carry; cy plus 

1 plus 0 equals 0, with another carry to the left; 
and cy plus 1 plus 1 equals 1 , with another carry 
to the left. That out of the way, let's look at the 
example. Carry s are shown in the line labeled 
Carry Line.

Now it is perhaps easier to see what hap- 
pens. In the binary example above, there's a 1 
bit that is carried into the left position beyond 
the eight bits we are working with. If we had 
been adding 16 and 254, then we had to have 
taken this carry into account and the re- 



NOVEMBER 1983

suit would have been 270 decimal, lOEH, or 
100001 HOB, and we would have had to create 
a sixteen-bit number to keep things accurate. 
Since we are subtracting 2, however, we ignore 
the carry beyond the number of bits in the two 
numbers we are working with, and that leaves 
us with an eight-bit number and the answer we 
needed— 14. 

Getting back to FILHST, then, we now have 
the one's complement of the drive number di- 
vided by 2 and multiplied by 16. We need to 
subtract this number from the RWTS slot 
number value for slot 6. In order for the sub- 
traction to be correct, we really should have a 
two's complement— a true negative of the drive 
value— but it's just as easy to add 1 to the 
RWTS value for slot 6. FILHST, then, adds our 
one's complement to 61 H, thereby subtracting 
the correct number of slots to come up with the 
proper RWTS value for this drive. 

To make sure we fully understand how this 
goes, let's take an actual drive number and 
work it out. We will assume that FILHST has 
gotten a seek drive number of 3, meaning the 
fourth drive in the system. By simply looking at 
it, we can see that with four drives, this will be 
slot 5, drive 2. By ANDing 3 and 1, FILHST 
gets a result of 1 , which it increments to 2 for 
RWTS and stores in A$DRV. It then takes the 3 
again, ANDs it with 14, and gets a result of 2. 
Multiplying 2 by 8 gives us 16 in decimal, or 
OOOIOOOOB. FILHST then does a one's comple- 
ment to get lllOllllB and adds that to 
OllOOOOlB, the value for slot 6 (plus 1). The 
eight significant bits of the result are 
OlOlOOOOB, or 50H, the RWTS value for slot 5. 
FILHST then stores this value in the host 
variable for slot number, A$SLT at 0F3E6H, 
where RWTS can access it. 

Having successfuly set up the host variables 
for CP/M drive and RWTS drive and slot num- 
bers, FILHST then goes on to get the seek-track 
number from SEKTRK into the [A] register. 
This it places into the [L] register. The 
seek-sector is already contained in the [C] 
register, since every routine that branches to 
FILHST stores the seek-sector there during 
operation. The seek-sector is placed into 
register [H], then, by FILHST, and the host 
variables for track and sector number are set 
simultaneously by storing the [HL] pair at 
A$TRK, located at 0F3E0H. The track number 
in register [L] goes into that location, while 
the sector number in register [H] goes into 
0F3E1H, the host variable for sector number. 

Now that all the host variables have been 
pointed to the correct disk, track, sector, 
FILHST loads the value of RSFLAG to see if a 
preread must be made. If so, it calls the 
READHST routine found at 0DE7AH to fill the 
buffer with the contents of the physical sector at 
the location pointed to by the host variables. If 
READHST is called, it returns to the point im- 
mediately after the CALL instruction. If not, 
control passes to this point automatically. In ei- 
ther case, this point is given the label NORD 
(for no read) and is located at 0DE49H. 

NORD has only one task, and that is to clear 
the SECMOD status flag, thereby indicating 
that no modification of the host buffer has yet 
been made. This means either that the contents 
of the host buffer are exactly the same as those 



of the disk or that it doesn't matter whether they 
are the same, since that disk area is unallocated. 
Any write to the disk at this point would be a 
total waste of time, so it's important that SEC- 
MOD be cleared to prevent any disk write. 

The execution of NORD completes the oper- 
ation of FILHST, and from there control passes 
automatically to the MATCH routine found at 
0DE4DH. As you'll remember, had FILHST 
not gotten executed, and had all seek variables 
matched all host variables, this is the point we 
would have arrived at. In essence, then, if the 
host buffer is active and both seek and host 
variables match, control passes immediately to 
the MATCH routine. If the host buffer is not ac- 
tive, then FILHST is executed immediately to 
make the variables match, and control eventual- 
ly winds up at MATCH. Finally, if the host 
buffer is active, but the variables do not match, 
then the buffer is written to disk if necessary, 
FILHST is executed to make the variables 
match, and control also passes eventually to 
MATCH. This describes what we have seen so 
far. One way or another, control gets to the 



MATCH routine. That's because it is the 
MATCH routine that actually performs the sub- 
sector read or write requested by BDOS. To see 
how this happens, we'll look at MATCH in 
detail. 

match's first operation is to get the seek- 
sector number requested by BDOS from the fE] 
register, where it was stored at the beginning of 
RWOPER. Since there are two of these sectors 
in the host buffer (HSTBUF), we need to deter- 
mine from the seek-sector number which of the 
two is being referred to. Since HSTBUF oc- 
cupies a 256-byte page of memory at 0F8(X)H 
and its low order byte is therefore 00, we know 
that the first sector in the buffer starts at 
0F800H and that the second one starts at 
0F880H. We also know that since sector 
numbers start with 0, the first half of the buffer 
will always be composed of the even-numbered 
sectors, while the second half will be the odd- 
numbered sectors. So, all we need to do is find 
out whether a sector number is even or odd in 
order to know which half of the buffer BDOS 
wants. MATCH does this by loading the [HL]

register pair with the address of HSTBUF, 
shifting bit 0 of the sector number from where it 
is stored in register [A], and shifting it into bit 7 
of register [L]. This makes [L] either 80H (if 
bit 0 was 1), or GO (if bit 0 was 0). And this 
makes the [HL] pair automatically point to the 
proper half of the buffer. 

MATCH next loads register pair [DE] with 
the DMA address from where it was stored dur- 
ing the last call to SETDMA. Register pair [BC] 
is loaded with 128, the number of bytes in a 
subsector. Those of you familiar with Z-80 
assembly language see what we are in the proc- 
ess of preparing for— the Z-80 instruction 
LOIR, which moves the number of bytes in 
[BC] starting from the address pointed to by 
[HL] to an area starting with the address pointed 
to by [DE] 

Now that all addresses have been set up and 
the count initialized, MATCH must determine 
which direction the bytes are to be moved in. To 
do this, it uses the READOP action flag. If 
READOP indicates that this is a read operation, 
a jump is made to RWMOVE at 0DE66H, 
which is simply the LDIR instruction, and all 
128 bytes are moved from the host buffer to the 
DMA address in user memory. If, on the other 
hand, this were a write operation, then 
SECMOD would be set to 1 to show that the 
host buffer has been modified and cannot be dis- 
carded without being written to disk. After that, 
the addresses in [HL] and [DE] are exchanged 
so that the bytes will be moved from the DMA 
address to the host buffer, and control falls 
through to the LDIR instruction at RWMOVE. 

Once the move has been made, there's only 
one more action that the BIOS must perform, 
and it takes this action now. It loads register [A] 
with the value in WRTYPE, the action flag that 
tells us what type of write this is. (The BIOS, 
remember, must always write immediately if 
this is write-type I, a write to the directory.) 
With the write-type in [A] , bit 0 is shifted out of 
[A] into the carry flag of the status register. 
Since only a write type of 1 will place a 1 in bit 
0, the carry flag will be set only if this is a di- 
rectory write. In case it is, register [A] is then 
loaded with 0 to show BDOS that no error has 
occurred, and a RET NC (return if no carry) in- 
struction is executed. With nondirectory writes, 
then, no further action is taken and control re- 
turns directly to BDOS. If the return is not made 
at this point, however, then a call is made to 
WRITEHST to write the host buffer to disk im- 
mediately; and, when that is done, control 
returns to BDOS. 

This completes most of the disk read/ 
write and deblocking code. The only routines 
we have not examined in detail are READHST 
and WRITEHST. 

WRITEHST is located first, at 0DE73H. Its 
first activity is to clear SECMOD, the status 
flag that shows whether the host buffer contains 
unwritten data. Then it loads the [A] register 
with the RWTS command for write, which is a 
2. The next instruction is actually a trick. By 
placing a byte in memory that corresponds to 
the opcode for a LD HL,xxxx instruction, 
WRITEHST ensures that the next two bytes will 
be treated by the Z-80 as the address for the 
load of [HL]. In this case, however, those two 
bytes are not an address of any kind. They are 
in fact two bytes that load the [A] register with 



the RWTS command for read, which is a 1 . As 
you've no doubt guessed by now, the two bytes 
in question (starting at 0DE7AH) are the start of 
READHST. Since most of what the two rou- 
tines do is identical, this is a short way of hav- 
ing WRITEHST do the extra business with 
SECMOD, load the write command, and then- 
skipping the load of the read command— go on 
to execute the rest of READHST. 

In the rest of READHST, the RWTS com- 
mand in [A] is stored in A$CMD, at location 
0F3EBH, where RWTS will look to find the 
command it is to execute. The [HL] register 
pair is loaded with the 6502 address of RWTS 
($0E03) and a call is made to the routine 
CALL65, which we have examined in the past. 
This routine takes care of saving all necessary 
registers and then, using the 6502 subroutine 
caller loop, passes control of the Apple over to 
the 6502 processor to branch to the 6502 rou- 
tine, whose address is in the [HL] register — in 
this case to RWTS. When RWTS is finished and 
control is returned to the Z-80, the RWTS loca- 
tion A$ERR (at 0F3EAH) is checked to see if 
RWTS detected any errors during this disk op- 
eration. A 0 indicates no errors detected, and an 
immediate return to the BIOS routine that called 
READHST or WRITEHST is made. 

Should an error be detected, the return ad- 
dress of the caller of READHST or WRITE- 
HST is removed from the Z-80 stack and 
discarded. It is for this reason that these two 
routines must always be called from within the 
BIOS rather than simply jumped to; this ensures 
that there will always be a return address on the 
stack to discard. If there were not, then the re- 
turn address to BDOS would be discarded and 
the result would be unpleasant. The reason 
READHST and WRITEHST handle their own 
errors is simple. Since they may be called from 
many different places within the read/write 
code, it would be terribly redundant to have a 
number of error tests at each of these places, 
especially since any error at any point should 
result in the same action — an immediate return 
to BDOS with an error indication. 

Once an error has been detected and the 
BIOS caller return address discarded, the error 
is tested to see whether it is a write-protect er- 
ror. This is because BDOS has a special return 
point for write-protect errors. If any other type 
of error is detected, a return to BDOS is made 
immediately. The accumulator, [A], already 
contains a nonzero value, which is all BDOS re- 
quires to be informed that a disk error has oc- 
curred. If, on the other hand, the error is a 
write-protect error, then the [HL] pair is loaded 
with the address of the begiiming of BDOS plus 
7 and a jump to that location is made. BDOS 
takes care of fixing up the stack and its other ex- 
tra procedures (printing the R/0 error message, 
for example, instead of BAD SECTOR). 

This completes our coverage of the disk 
read/write code and our in-depth discussion of 
the BIOS code as a whole. It has been an inter- 
esting series (somehow you always learn most 
about a subject when trying to describe it to 
someone else). 

Next month we'll begin a new series of sub- 
jects, possibly focusing on such items as specif- 
ic modifications to the BIOS for various person- 
al uses, optimizing software for SoftCard, and 
so on. Until next month. ... Hi

you formatted the stock record yourself, it can easily be changed to meet 
your requirements as they evolve over time. 

With most commercially available stock status programs, producing 
a report containing the essential information about your portfolio re- 
quires that you use several sheets of printer paper. The idea of the Stock 
Status Spreadsheet (SSS) came from Value Line, a well-known publisher 
of investor information. Value Line does a very good job of putting a 
tremendous amount of information concerning a particular stock on a 
single sheet of paper. SSS is based on the same idea, and in SSS informa- 
tion about your portfolio is also placed on one sheet so that the essentials 
can easily be known. 

Enough of the preliminaries. Let's get to work on our own Stock 
Status Spreadsheet. It is assumed here that you are already familiar with 
the use of the mechanics of the spreadsheet you have. One procedure 
you'll find very valuable in the construction of the SSS is the replicate 
function. The spreadsheet in example A has eleven columns with room 



for seven digits in each. This format fills a standard-size page with 
standard-size type. The ability to vary column widths is quite helpful and 
will be considered later. Condensed print is also valuable in situations 
where more than eleven columns of information are desired. Having 
space for six digits allows one to handle a dollar figure of six digits, more 
than most of us will need. More important, it provides space for dates in 
the form FE1783, in which 17 represents the date of the transaction and 
83 the year. 

Each transaction apf)ears on a separate line. This limits the number of 
transactions to about forty, depending on how much other information is 
desired. 

Example A shows the name of the stock in the example rather than 
the stock symbol. If you prefer the stock symbols, use them. 

The SSS starts out with the name of the stock (STOCK) and the date 
it was originally purchased (DATE PURCHASED), essenfial for deter- 
mining whether the stock is short- or long-term.

The next column records the number of shares purchased (NUMBER 
SHARES), followed by the cost paid per share (COST/SHARE). This is 
followed by die total paid for the transaction (ORIGINAL VALUE). The 
next column repeats the stock name (STOCK). This is required if an 
eighty -column board is not used and allows you to see the right-hand side 
of the template. The repetition of the name of the stock is positioned to be 
on the left side of the CRT when you're entering information into the col- 
umn shown to the right of it. Basically, the first six columns are not 
changed unless a stock is bought or sold. 

The CURRENT VALUE column is the "input," in which the most 
recent stock values are entered to update the SSS (more about this later) . 
The next column shows the current value of the stock (CURRENT 
VALUE). The following column lists the percentage gain or loss from 
the original price paid (PERCENT GAIN/LS). The next column shows 
the gain or loss in dollars from this particular transaction (GAIN/LOSS). 
The final column provides an easy way to summarize the total value of 
all the stocks (TOTAL VALUE). 

Now back to the CURRENT VALUE column. If there is only one 
transaction concerning a stock, the new value is entered. The next col- 
umn, TOTAL VALUE, is calculated automatically by the power of the 
spreadsheet (CURRENT VALUE * NUMBER SHARES). The PER- 
CENT GAIN/LOSS column is calculated by subtracting the ORIGINAL 
VALUE from the TOTAL VALUE, and then dividing by the ORIG- 
INAL VALUE and multiplying by 1(X) to get the percent. The GAIN/ 
LOSS column is calculated by subtracting the TOTAL VALUE from the 



ORIGINAL VALUE. On a single-stock entry the TOTAL VALUE is 
shown in the last column. 

Don't give up now, we're nearly there! A one-stock entry is shown 
on the first stock entry line of example A. This entry shows that we 
bought 100 shares of Alcoa stock on January 10, 1983, for $35 per 
share, costing $3,560 including the commission. The current value is 
37% ($37. 12) per share. It now has a total value of $3,712.50, a percent 
gain of 4.28%, a gain of $152.50, and a total value of $3,712.50. 

The next step is to address the situation where there is more than one 
transaction per stock. This type of situation is reflected in the next three 
entries. All the entries for the first Apple transaction line are the same as 
the one for a single stock. In the second Apple transaction line the CUR- 
RENT VALUE is entered as the CURRENT VALUE times 1 . This same 
procedure is followed on the third entry — that is, CURRENT VALUE 
from the first entry times 1. When this procedure is followed, an entry 
for a stock having two or more transactions is entered only once. All cal- 
culations are performed automatically by the power of the spreadsheet. 

A summary line is shown for the Apple stock. Since it is a summary 
of all the Apple transactions, no date is given. The input for CURRENT 
VALUE is the same as for the other Apple transactions. 

Another stock, Chi Chi, is included to show how a stock IRA may be 
incorporated into the SSS. The first entry of the Chi Chi stock is a 
regular entry, whereas the second entry (WIRA82) under STOCK is a 
stock IRA. The symbol used here begins with "W," short for the user's 
first name; IRA is obvious; and 82 specifies the year the IRA was

started. All the other entries are made in the standard manner. 

This record can be very convenient for tracking stock sold during the 
current year. Previous years can also be listed if desired and if there's 
room for them. They are shown similarly to the active stocks, except 
there is no need to update them. The CURRENT VALUE column shows 
the value of the stock when it was sold and various other pertinent infor- 
mation. No total is shown in the TOTAL VALUE column. At the end of 
each year you have a record of stocks you have sold. A record of this 
information should also be kept in written form for good measure. 

On the summary line, the total amount currently invested is shown 
under ORIGINAL VALUE. A current value is calculated automatically 
under the TOTAL VALUE column. To the right of the sum of the 
ORIGINAL VALUE is a total percent value of the SSS. This is calcu- 
lated by taking the sum of the TOTAL VALUE, subtracted from the sum 
of the ORIGINAL VALUE, divided by the sum of the ORIGINAL 
VALUE times 100. Adjacent to this is the current status in dollars of the 
SSS, calculated by subtracting the sum of the ORIGINAL VALUE from 
the sum of the TOTAL VALUE. Below this line is the current date and 



the DOW closing value. 

Three additional blocks of information are shown: current year cap- 
ital gain/loss, cash flow, and total funds added to the SSS. 

The listing of GAINS/LOSSES is a summary of the current year to 
date of stocks sold. The TOTAL ADDED listing is valuable in keeping 
an overall status of the value of the portfolio when funds are added (or 
subtracted) during the year. Finally, the CASH FLOW is added to the 
sum of the TOTAL VALUE of the stocks so that an overall record of 
stocks plus cash is presented on the last line. 

Your requirements may differ from the SSS shown, but working 
through the example will help you to define your own needs and develop 
your own ideas. Example B shows another SSS, this one based on using 
a spreadsheet that allows the user to vary the widths of the individual col- 
umns and to print out with condensed type. These capabilities make it 
possible to specify an extra wide column as needed to display informa- 
tion that's essential to a particular stock. A hard record should also be 
made periodically, since a disk can hold only so much information. 

That's it! Now go to work and make some green for your efforts!

WE'RE VERY HARD ON OURSOFTWARE 

You might even say we're perfectionists. Because at Softsmith™ we give our software the hardest worl<out, 
the toughest testing, the most rigorous evaluation. The result is software that has earned our confidence, and 
will justify your trust. 

In particular, we do three things that make Softsmith software the most dependable you can buy. 

1. 2. 3. 



We're picky. Out of the hundreds 
of programs Softsmith evaluates 
every month, we choose to 
publish very few. A lot of good pro- 
grams are rejected; but we think 
you can't be too picky when it 
comes to personal computer soft- 
ware. Our selectivity is your best 
assurance of quality. 



We complain a lot. If you were a 
programmer, and Softsmith 
accepted your program, you 
would have a right to be proud. 
But you shouldn't go on vacation 
yet. Because no matter how good 
that program may be, Softsmith 
evaluators will suggest some 
improvements; politely, but firmly. 
We may complain a lot, but 
people thank us later. 



We insist on plain English. After 
we've made the best program 
better, we're still not finished. 
Because we know that even the 
best program is no good if it's too 
hard to use. So we put a lot of time 
and effort into translating our 
instructions from computerese 
into plain English. 



We publish software you can trust. Yes, we pick our programs carefully. And complain a lot to make them better. And insist 
on plain English instructions. The result is a library of personal computer software you can depend on. Even if you don't know 
a Pascal compiler from an emulation subroutine. 

Softsmith has programs you can trust for all the most popular personal computers. Programs for Education, Home Manage- 
ment, Entertainment, Word Processing, Business, Communications and Programming. Ours is the largest library of quality 
software under one brand name. 

So before you choose a software package for your computer, make sure someone's taken the time to be hard on it. Make sure 
it's Softsmith, the software you can trust. 

Ask for Softsmith brand software wherever computers or software are sold. Or cal I us TOLL-FREE at (800) 341-4000 for the 
name and location of your nearest dealer.

LOCOMOTION™ 
MAKES LEARNING 
THENAMEOFTHEGAME 




Can a computer think? This 
question has intrigued people 
since the very beginning of the 
ComputerAge. 

With Logomotion, fronn Softsmith™ 
Corporation, anyone from young 
children to adults can use the per- 
sonal computer to answer that 
question. Through its power to 
draw pictures, make music, and 
create programs, Logomotion 
allows you to explore the exciting 
intellectual potential of your 
computer. Along the way you'll 
gain valuable insights into the 
way your own thinking works, and 
create an environment where 
learning computer programming 
is fun. 

Like most Logo-based programs, 
Logomotion starts children out 



with turtle graphics. By "teaching" 
a computer turtle how to draw 
shapes and pictures, children 
learn the basics of geometry and

The"HowTo's"of Software Production 



How to double your 
revenues 

Believe it or not, there are five to ten 
bootlegged copies for every program disk- 
ette sold legally. An effective, hardware- 
based copy protection method is the best 
way to convert freeloaders into customers. 

How to protect your 
reputation 

Every diskette you ship should work 
under even marginal conditions. Special- 
purpose equipment designed for high- 
precision recording and verification will 
give you the edge in product quality 

How to reduce your 
costs 

Rugged, high-performance diskette dupli- 
cation equipment is mandatory for high- 
volume software production. Look for 
speed, reliability, and foolproof operator 
simplicity.

The FORMASTER Series One intelligent 
diskette duplicator produces up to 326 
fully verified copies per hour, with Copy- 
Lock™ piracy protection and copy serial- 
ization added automatically. 



How to expand your 
business 

As your programs become more suc- 
cessful, you'll want to develop versions for 
different computers. Your duplication 
equipment should handle all diskette for- 
mats, including complex GCR encodings 
such as Apple, Commodore, and Victor.

Guesswork on the Apple 



Writing a complicated program often involves making a minimal 
working version and then adding features and enhancements one at a 
time. Later in this article we're going to use that technique to convert a 
simple game into a not-so-simple game. It's possible to build some pretty 
elaborate programs by taking things one step at a time. But if you're go- 
ing to put that much effort into a program— whether all at once or in 
small creative spurts— you will want a way to save it so you can use it or 
modify it still further some other day. So let's talk about saving programs 
before we talk about writing them. 

That, as you probably know, is what your disk drive is for. Now is a 
good time for you to prepare a disk on which to keep programs presented 
in this column and ones you'll create yourself. To do this, you will need 
a blank disk; if you don't have one, visit a computer store. Disks may on- 
ly come in boxes of ten; if you're going to be using your computer exten- 
sively, either for programming or running commercial software, you'll 
be using plenty of disks, so you might as well spring for the box. 

Initial Considerations. The first thing you want to do is label the 
disk. You might write "Follow the Floating Point" on this first disk. Or 
you might label it "Recipes Using Eggplant" to keep the kids away. In 
any case, from here on we will refer to this disk as your Floating Point 
disk when we want you to save something on it. 

Now you should initialize the disk using the DOS init command. 
Although this is a column on Applesoft, Apple's DOS is an important 
part of programming in Applesoft, so we'll be looking at DOS com- 
mands from time to time. The process begun by the init command mag- 
netically organizes the surface of the disk into physical segments, each of 
which can store a predetermined amount of data. If these segments were 
not marked out, DOS wouldn't know where to put something you wanted 
to save. If you ever try to save something on an uninitialized disk, you'll 
get an error message. 

Initializing a disk also puts a copy of DOS onto the disk. This is 
necessary because the computer doesn't contain DOS in ROM the way it 
contains Applesoft. Instead, DOS is loaded into RAM memory by means 
of the process known as booting the disk. So any disk you intend to boot 
must have DOS recorded on it. The last thing init does is save the pro- 
gram in memory onto disk. For this reason init is always followed by a 
file name, which is assigned to that program. 

Here's how to do it. Boot up the DOS 3.3 System Master disk. Type 
new. Now enter the following program: 

10 HOME 

20 PRINT "Follow the Floating Point" 
30 PRINT "program disk" 

If you run this program you'll see that all it does is clear the screen 
and put up a message identifying the disk we're making. This is a simple 
hello program. There's nothing magic about a hello program; it's just the 
program that runs when you boot the disk. It doesn't have to be named 
Hello; that's just a common convention. It will run every time you boot 



up your Floating Point disk. Now remove the System Master from the 
drive and insert your blank disk. Type: 

INIT HELLO 

The disk drive will spin for a minute or two while it initializes the 
disk. If the computer beeps and prints an I/O error message, try again. If 
it does it again, you have a bad disk and you should try using another 
blank disk. The rest of this article will assume that you have successfully 
initialized your Floating Point disk and have it in the disk drive ready to 
save programs on. 

Be My Guess. The random number guessing game is about the 
simplest of all possible computer games; it can be created entirely with 
the few commands we've mentioned so far. Let's pursue the theory of 
starting a program as simply as possible. In a guessing game, we have to 
have the computer pick a number and then tell the player to guess what it 
is. If the player is right (this judgment necessitates an if-then comparison 
between the player's guess and the computer's number), a congratula- 
tory message is printed. If the player is wrong, the computer will say so. 
If the program is to have a personality, the message can be either insult- 
ing or encouraging, depending on whether we want to entertain or 
educate. 

That would be the simplest algorithm for the guessing game program. 
It would also be patently unfair. The player only gets one chance. How 
about if we offer the opportunity to guess again? That addition completes 
a reasonable, simple guessing game. Figure 1 shows the flow of the 
game. We have arbitrarily set the computer's number to five for now. 
This allows us to determine that the program is responding to guesses 
correctly. Here's the program: 

100 HOME 

110 CN = 5: REM computer's number 

120 INPUT "Guess a number from one to ten. ";GS: REM guess 

130 IF OS = CN THEN GOTO 200 

140 PRINT "Nope, guess again," 

150 GOTO 120 

200 PRINT "You got it!" 

210 PRINT 

220 END 

Save this program to your disk with the file name Guess. 1. This is 
done by simply typing: 

SAVE GUESS.1 

Later, if you want to get the program back in this form, type: 
LOAD GUESS.1 

with the same disk in the drive. If you're not sure which disk you left a 
program on, you can type: 

CATALOG 



298 



NOVEMBER 1983 



Init, save, load, and catalog are your basic DOS commands for dealing 
with Applesoft programs. 

The line numbers start at 100 for the same reason that we increment 
line numbers by 10: We may want to put something in between these 
lines later. 

The next thing to note is the unfamiliar constructions in lines 1 10 and 
120. We haven't said anything yet about the use of the colon in Applesoft 
or the meaning of the rem command. We also said that this program 
could be written entirely with commands we've already mentioned. This 
is true— rem does nothing; it could have been left out. 

Rem is a command that tells the computer to do nothing and to ignore 
whatever follows it in that program line. Rem is short for remark. Use it 
to insert comments that remind you about the purpose of some variable, 
equation, routine, or whatever. As your programs get longer, these ex- 
planations can help you understand them. In this case, the rems are noting 
the meanings of the variables first used in those lines. 

How the rem statements got on the same lines as other commands is 
another matter; that's where the colons come in. The colon is used in Ap- 
plesoft to separate two statements you want to put in the same program 
line. Any commands can be put together in the same line in almost any 
combination. However, anything following a rem in the same line is con- 
sidered part of the remark and is ignored. Any statement following an if- 
then statement will be executed only if the condition in the if-then is true. 
If the condition is false, control falls to the next program line. 

Anything following a goto statement in a program line will never be 
seen. You can put it there, but it will be ignored. Also, all gotos to a 
multiple statement line direct the program to the first statement in the 
line. There is no way to go directly to a statement in the middle of a line. 
The limitations outlined here are the major reasons we can't just run all 
the commands of a program together on one line. There is also the small 
matter that Applesoft won't let you enter a line that's more than 239 
characters long. 

In this program, line 1 10 could have been grafted onto line 100, line 
150 could have been part of 140, and lines 200 through 220 could have 
replaced the goto in line 130. If the rem at the end of 120 were removed.

our conglomerate line 130 could have been added to the end of 120. The 
program could have read like this: 

100 HOME : CN = 5: REM computer's number 

120 INPUT "Guess a number from one to ten, ";GS: IF GS = CN 

THEN PRINT "You got it!": PRINT: END 
140 PRINT "Nope, guess again.": GOTO 120 

This version would run a tad faster and use up less space in memory 
then the first listing of the guessing program. However, with the lines 
containing only one or two statements each, as in the first version, a pro- 
gram is much easier to modify. The moral: Don't use too many multiple 
statement lines while you're writing a program. If you need more speed 
or space when the program is finished, you can bunch statements 
together to your heart's content. Later in this series, we'll go over some 
other ways to speed up programs. For now, let's just worry about getting 
them to run. 

Run the program (the first version) and see how you like it. To 
elaborate on a program like this, you change the stuff you don't like and 
add more of the kind of stuff you do like. Let's start by deciding what we 
don't like. You can, of course, dislike whatever you choose, and, at 
home, you can change whatever you want. Please do. For the purposes 
of the tutorial, we have chosen to dislike the fact that it gives the mes- 
sage, "Guess a number from one to ten," every time that the player must 
guess. If you look at the flow chart, you'll see that the program wasn't 
planned that way. We also dislike the fact that there is only one way out: 
winning. Of course, the user can always control-C out, but it's terribly 
bad programming form not to allow for an exit. Let's give players a 
chance to exit the program by guessing zero. Finally, we aren't pleased 
by the way all the text runs together. 

Let's make these changes: 

115 PRINT "Guess a number from one to ten. If you want to quit, 

type a zero."; 
120 INPUT "";GS 
123 PRINT 

125 IF GS = 0 THEN PRINT "Loser, The number was ";CN;".": 

GOTO 210 
140 PRINT "Nope, Guess again: ":

two are modifications of old ones. You can add them all to the program 
by just typing them in as shown, but in the case of the lines to be 
modified, there's an easier way. It's called escape editing, among other 
things. We'll start with line 140, the simpler of the two lines to edit. 
First, list the line by typing list 140. This will list only line 140 on the 
screen. 

Now, hit escape. Nothing will seem to change, but the computer has 
gone into cursor move mode (if you're using an Apple He with the 
eighty-column board activated, the cursor will change to a plus sign). 

In cursor move mode, the I, J, K, and M keys allow you to move the 
cursor freely about the screen. If you have an Apple lie, you can use the 
four arrow keys instead. Position the cursor so that it is superimposed on 
top of the 1 in the line number 140. 

Now hit the space bar. This takes you out of cursor move mode and 
allows you to enter characters into the input buffer. Normally, you enter 
characters into the input buffer by typing them, but that's the un- 
necessary work we're trying to avoid. 

There is another way. (There's always another way.) Hitting the right 
arrow key at this point copies the character under the cursor into the 
buffer as //you had typed it, and then it moves the cursor over one char- 
acter. Now, by using the right arrow with the repeat key (on the II Plus) 
or by holding down the arrow key (on the He), you can move the cursor 
over the text. This copies the characters into the input buffer. Stop when 
you reach the first character to be changed, which is the period. 

At this point, you can type the rest of the new version of the line: a 
colon (in this case it doesn't act as a statement separator because it's 
within quotation marks), a space, a quotation mark, and a semicolon. 
Then hit return and the line is entered. If you list the program now, 
you'll see the new version of the line. 

If it didn't work, there's a chance you neglected to hit the space bar to 
turn off cursor move mode when you moved the cursor to the beginning 
of the line. If that's the case, retype the old version of the line and try 
once again to edit it into the new version. 

Roaming the Wide Open Spaces. Line 120 is a little trickier. Let's 
say we wanted to change the period to a colon as we did in line 140. List 
120. The line should look like this on the screen: 



120 INPUT "Guess a number from o 
ne to ten. ";GS: REM guess 

As listed, there are several spaces after the o and before the ne on the 
screen. If you tried to copy this line, twelve spaces would be inserted into 
the message. There are two ways around this. The first is to copy the line 
to the letter o in the same way we copied line 140 (actually moving the 
cursor to rest on the space after the o); then hit escape to go into cursor 
move mode. Now hit the right arrow key twelve times. The cursor is 
moving, but nothing is being copied into the buffer because you hit 
escape. The cursor should come to rest on the letter n. Hit the space bar 
to return to input mode. Copy to the period, type a colon, copy to the end 
of the line, and hit return. 

That was the hard way. Here's the easy way. Type poke 33,33, then 
list the line. This command restricts the text window to the first thirty- 
three columns, but never mind that for now. Just remember poke 33,33. 
The effect of this is to change the format of a program listing, omitting 
the indents before each line on the screen. Now you can copy the line 
and no unwanted spaces will be inserted. To get the fiiU text window (which 
makes listings easier to read, among other things), type text. 

Instead of changing the period to a colon, however, we really want to 
delete the sentence in quotes entirely while leaving the quotes. To do 
this, copy the line up to the first quote and type the rest of the new line. 
(Actually, the new line is short enough to retype it entirely, but it's useful 
to practice escape editing.) Another way to make the change would be to 
copy to the first quote, go into cursor move mode and move to the second 
quote, hit a space, and copy to the end of the line. 

When you've modified lines 120 and 140, enter the new lines. The 
program now looks like this: 

100 HOME 

110 CN = 5; REM computer's number 

1 1 5 PRINT "Guess a number from one to ten. If you want to quit, 

type a zero."; 

120 INPUT "";GS 

123 PRINT 

125 IF GS = 0 THEN PRINT "Loser. The number was ";CN;".":

Save this version of the program as Guess. 2. When you run it, the 
program prints the main prompting message only once, thereafter 
prompting you to guess again. Not repeating the instructions has the ef- 
fect of making either the program or the programmer appear smarter, or 
of making it appear that the programmer thinks the user is smarter. None 
of these results can be considered undesirable. Also, having a way to quit 
gives players that feeling of control over the machine that keeps them 
coming back. 

Hit the Breaks! You'll note, however, that the main prompting 
message doesn't look right. The word want is broken in half at the edge 
of the screen. You can fix this in one of two ways. Enter the message as 
two separate print statements, like so: 



115 PRINT "Guess a number from one to ten. If you' 
"want to quit, type a zero." 



PRINT 



The other way is to insert a space between the words you and want. That 
will push the w to join the rest of the word want in the next line. 

Now that we've fixed what we don't like, let's make the machine 
seem even more intelligent. Let's have it tell the player to guess higher or 
lower. And let's print a special message when the guess is close. Finally, 
let's make the computer use a real random number. These changes re- 
quire us to modify the design of the program slightly. Figure 2 shows the 
new flow design. The boldfaced boxes and arrows are the parts that re- 
main essentially the same from the first flow chart. The rest has been 
added since then. 

Note that the new program will make four judgments based on the 
guess. The first is. Is the guess equal to zero? If GS = 0, the player 
wants to quit, so the program prints a message and goes to the end. The 
second judgment is. Is the guess correct? This, of course, leads to the 
winning message and the end if the answer is yes. The last two judgments 
are designed to make the computer prompt the player intelligently. The 
third is. Is the player close? and the fourth is (in essence). Is the guess 
high or low? Selected messages are printed based on the answers to the 
last two questions. 

Study the order of the judgments. If the player says, "I quit," there's 
no need to continue, so that is the first thing checked for. Also, if the 
guess is right, further prompting messages are unnecessary. It's impor- 
tant that the "Guess higher" and "Guess lower" messages come im- 
mediately before the input (logically if not physically), so they must be 
the last things before the goto back to the input. By default, then, the gra- 
tuitous "Getting warm" message must come before the prompt 
selection. 

Here are the code changes. You'll note that each enhancement can be 
accomplished with just one or two lines. 

110 CN = INT ( RND (1) * 100) + 1 

This line puts a random number from one to 100 in the variable CN. 
Here's how it works: RND (1) returns a random real number that is less 
than one but greater than or equal to zero. The range of that number can 
be altered by multiplying it by our desired range, hence RND (1) * 100. 
This part of the equation returns a random real number that is less than 
100 and greater than or equal to zero. But it isn't an integer; it's 
something like 63.096721, which would be difficult to guess exactly. 
The /AT function lops off the decimal places, giving a random integer 
from zero through ninety-nine. Since we don't want zero as a possibility 
and we do want 100, we simply add one. And that's how a random num- 
ber is derived. 



115 PRINT "Guess a number from one to one hundred, 
to quit, type zero. "; 



you want 



The message in line 115 has been changed to reflect the new range of 
numbers. Note that there is no space between the period and the word If. 
That's because the period is the fortieth character in the string. The char- 
acter immediately following it will be the first character on the next line, 
so no space is necessary. 




Free Enterprise 

A business management game 

You run your own company making decisions based 
on economic factors and the actions of competitors. 

It's your opportunity to sit on top and run a corporation. 
Free Enterprise, based on an IBM-developed simulation 
for training top-level managers, is as surprising and 
demanding as the real world. 

It lets you face the same on-your-toes challenges you 
would in running a real business: pricing products, 
determining budgets for advertising, production, plant 
improvement, and R&D. Even securing bank loans and 
deciding on stockholder dividends. You use computer 
generated reports to make decisions. But if you're wrong 
you could go bankrupt. Only the shrewd survive! 

Free Enterprise can be played at three competency levels 
so novices can compete with the more experienced, and 
from one to six can play. It's the perfect chance to learn 
about the free enterprise system — to practice business 
strategies — and to enjoy it — with no risks. 

Simulation components: disk, user's manual, pad of 50 
record sheets, and pad of 50 decision sheets.

135 IF ABS (GS - CN)< 10 THEN PRINT "Getting warm. " 

ABS means absolute value or, simply stated, "If the number is nega- 
tive, it isn't anymore." In this case, the number is the difference between 
the guess and the computer's number. The difference may be negative or

Make no mistake about it: The inexorable sands of 
time have crept around again to that spot on the calen- 
dar that we so euphemistically call the "holiday sea- 
son." We get Thanksgiving this month, followed by 
Christmas, New Year's, and then a chance to catch 
our breath. 

So what are we thankful for? Well, we're thankful 
inCider and A+ haven't put us out of business yet. And 
we're thankful that our book division has almost 
earned the name by getting at least one manuscript 
almost ready for printing. We're also grateful that one 
or two of our columnists are actually sending in their 
copy on time. 

Of course we're grateful that so many of you 
readers are deciding to continue with us after your 
free trial subscription has expired. But we'd be even 
more grateful if you'd all stop taking so much pride in 
being the only ones on your block with a subscription 
to Softalk. 

GIVE! 

Give Softalk to Aunt Millie, the postman, the crotch- 
ety neighbor next door, cousin Arnold, and the cute kid 
who can't stay out of your crab-apple tree. Give Softalk 
to your school library, your public library, and your 
company library. Give lots of Softalks. Then you'll be 
infused with the Christmas spirit and we'll be thankful 
for your generosity. That way, we can both enter the 
new year with smiles on our faces. 

There, we've done it! We've paid homage to three 
holidays in one appeal. How can you resist?

P.S.: We'll even save you money. Through December 31, 
we'll take $18 instead of $24 for a one-year subscription. 



puter count the number of guesses made. You could alter the "Getting 
warm" message to "Getting warmer" if the player's current guess is 
better than his previous one or "Getting colder" if the guess is worse 
than the one before. There are whole bunches of things you can do. 
As you add new enhancements to the program, your line numbers 



will become unbearably close together, eventually to the point where you 
can't fit a line in where you need it. Wouldn't it be nice if you could tell 
the computer to change your line numbers for you? Well, you can, and it 
is. We'll start next month with an introduction to the Renumber program 
on your System Master disk. Jl§ 



GLOSSARY 



ABS (expression): Function that returns the absolute value of 
expression in parentheses. 

Absolute value: If a number is less than zero, it is multiplied by 
- 1. Otherwise, it is left alone. 

CATALOG: DOS command to list the file names on a disk. 

Colon: In Applesoft, a colon separates statements that are in the 
same line. See Multiple statement line. 

Escape editing: A method of editing an Applesoft program that 
involves hitting the escape key to go into cursor movement 
mode, moving the cursor around the screen with the I, J, K, 
and M keys (Apple II Plus) or the four arrow keys (Apple lie), 
hitting the space bar to go into input mode, and either typing 
characters into the input buffer or copying them from the 
screen using the right arrow key. 

Exit: A reasonable way out of a program. It may take the form of 
a quit command, a control key, a menu entry, or some other 
special input. It should be prompted for at least once. 

INIT: DOS command to format a disk, record DOS on the disk, 
and save the Basic program in memory. Usually used on a 
blank disk, but may be used on any disk with a write-enable 
notch. This command will wipe out any information that was 
previously recorded on the disk. 

Input buffer: A specialized area of memory where characters 
typed at the keyboard during input or program line entry are 
stored. When the return key is hit, the characters in the input 
buffer are acted upon and the input buffer is cleared to accept 
more input. 



INT (expression): Returns the value of the expression in paren- 
theses minus any decimal places. This is similar to a rounding 
operation except that it always rounds down. 

LOAD: DOS command to take a Basic program from a disk and 
put it in memory. Followed by the file name of the desired pro- 
gram. This command will destroy any other program in 
memory but will not actually remove the program from the 
disk. 

Multiple statement line: A program line in Applesoft that con- 
tains more than one statement. The statements are separated by 
colons. 

POKE 33,33: A command to restrict the size of the text window, 
thus changing the list format for Applesoft programs so that no 
hanging indents are used. This makes it easier to use the escape 
editing method of line editing without adding spaces into a 
string (a message in quotes). 

REM: Applesoft command to ignore the rest of the program line. 
Used to incorporate enlightening comments into an otherwise 
obscure listing. 

RND (1): Returns a random real number (noninteger) between 
zero and one. 

SAVE: DOS command to record the Basic program in memory 
onto disk. Followed by the file name to be used for the 
program. 

TEXT: Applesoft command to return the display to text mode 
(turns off any graphics display). Also used to restore Applesoft 
list format to normal by opening the text window to full size.

We added another head 
so you won't have to buy another disk. 

That's the beauty of a double sided head. A 
floppy disk which allows you to read and write on 
both sides. For more storage, for more information, 

for keeping larger records, 
and for improved perfor- 
mance of your system. 
That's what our new Elite 
Two and Elite Three offers. 
It's the first double headed 
Apple® compatible disk 
drive in the industry. And of 
course, the technology is 
from Rana. We're the com- 
pany who gave you 163K 
bytes of storage with our Elite One, a 14% increase 
over Apple's. And now with our high tech double 
sided heads, our Elite Two and Three offers you two 
to four times more storage than Apple's. That's 
really taking a byte out of the competition. 

We put our heads together 
to give you a superior disk drive. 

We designed the Elite Three to give you near 
hard disk capacity with all the advantages of a 
minifloppy system. The double sided head oper- 
ates on 80 tracks per side, giving you a capacity of 
652K bytes. It would take 4^/2 Apples to give you 
that. And cost you three times our Elite Three's 
reasonable $849 pricetag. 



Rana s double sided heads give Apple 
II superior disk performance power 
than second generation personal com- 
puters such as IBM's. 



It takes 4V2 Apples to equal the capacity 
of our superior Elite Three. 







The Elite Two offers an impressive 326K bytes 
and 40 tracks on each side. This drive is making a 
real hit with users who need extra storage, but 
don't require top-of-the-line capacity Costwise, it 
takes 2V2 Apple drives to equal the performance of 
our Elite Two. And twice as many diskettes. Leave it 
to Rana to produce the most cost efficient disk 
drive in the world. 

We've always had the guts to be a leader. 

Our double sided head may be an industry 
first for Apple computers, but nobody was surprised. 



They've come to expect it from us. Because Rana 
has always been a leader We were the first 
with a write protect feature, increased capacity 




Your word processor stores 5 times as many pages of text on an Elite Three 
diskette as the cost ineffective Apple 

and accurate head positioning. A first with attrac- 
tive styling, faster access time, and the conve- 
nience of storing a lot more pages on far fewer 
diskettes. We were first to bring high technology to 
a higher level of quality 

So ask for an Elite One, Two, or Three. 
Because when it comes to disk drives, nobody 
uses their head like Rana.

Some Very Good 
Reasons to Buy 
an Echo Speech 
Synthesizer. 



We're confident we have the most intelhgible, 
versatile, and economical speech synthesizer 
on the market. Once you hear it, we're sure 
you'll be convinced too. All ECHOs are capable 
of speaking in four different voice modes 
which range from a robotic machine voice to 
natural female speech. (The fixed speech and 
custom modes are optional.) 

It's Easy To Use 

Unlike other speech systems, the ECHOs 
are very simple to use. It only takes a minute 
or two to get the ECHO talking. Any text 
which can be printed to the screen can be 
spoken. If you've written a BASIC program 
you can add speech with simple modifications. 

Software Compatibility 

Not only can you add speech to the programs 
you write yourself, over 25 top educational 
and adventure software manufacturers are 
currently designing programs to be compatible 
with the ECHO ][. Be watching for details. 




Value 

Each ECHO comes ready to use with a speaker 
and tutorial-style manual. The ECHO][, 
priced at $149.95, also comes with a variety 
of demonstration and utility programs . The new 
ECHO GP (General Purpose), priced at $199.95 
is a stand-alone unit with its own on-board 
microprocessor; it will interface with any 
computer through the serial port. All ECHOs 
have a one year warranty. 

Bells And Whisdes 

If you want bells, whisdes, music and sound 
effects, plus state-of-the-art sprite graphics 
capabilities, the ECHO technology is available 
on Synetix Systems' new Supersprite Board. 

Check It Out 

Most Apple dealers have the ECHO][ available 
for demonstration as part of Street Electronics/ 
Orange Micro's unique Grappler+™, Buffer- 
board™, ECHO][™ Talking Demonstration.

EDUCATIONAL NETWORK USES 
MODEMS AND MICR0C0A4PUTERS 



On September 12, TeleLearning Systems 
of San Francisco, California, announced a de- 
velopment that should go a long way toward 
making the "computers in education" revolu- 
tion come to pass — the TeleLearning telecom- 
munications system, a package designed to 
transform a personal computer into a person- 
alized "electronic university." 

So far, versions of the TeleLearning 
telecommunications package are available for 
use with any Apple n series machine and the 
IBM pc. A Commodore 64 version will be re- 
leased this month, to be followed shortly by 
versions for TRS-80 and Atari machines. All 
versions require disk drive and monitor; a 
printer can also be used, though none is 
required. 

The basic TeleLearning package is com- 



posed of a 300-baud autodial modem (the 
"knowledge module"), communications and 
educational environment software, and a cata- 
log that lists the courses offered, what they 
cover, and what they cost. For the benefit of 
computerists who already own modems, the 
TeleLearning software can also be purchased 
separately. And for computer novices, there's 
a special package containing the knowledge 
module, TeleLearning system software, 
course catalog, and instructional software de- 
signed to teach them how to operate the 
computer. 

This computerized educational system 
bears some resemblance to the traditional cor- 
respondence school— but not much. True, the 
student does communicate with the instructor

Ami MICRO 
TO COMPETE 
WITH IBM'S 



Better late than never. American Tele- 
phone & Telegraph is planning to enter the 
microcomputer market within the next six 
months. 

According to a recent report published by 
International Resource Development (Nor- 
walk, CT), AT&T's micro will use thirty- 
two-bit architecture based on Western Elec- 
tric's Bellmac microprocessor and will feature 
software based on Bell Laboratories 's Unix 
operating system. 

It's long been expected that AT&T would 
clash head-on with IBM and other office auto- 
mation companies once the communications 
giant had freed itself from public utility status. 
AT&T is looking to invade IBM's territory 
but realizes how strong Big Blue's position is. 
The bout has just begun. 

AT&T's micro will have the option of run- 
ning software developed for the IBM pc, ac- 
cording to the IRD report— which is titled Mi- 
crocomputer Operating System Strategies. 
Microsoft, apparently, is developing a "MS- 
DOS look-alike" program for the new 
computer. 

IBM, on the other hand, may implement 
"selective price reductions" to undercut 
AT&T and is encouraging the development of 
Unix-based operating systems for several IBM 
computers, including the pc. IBM is also now 
geared up to outproduce AT&T, at least 
through 1984. 

The AT&T micro is not expected to fea- 
ture Lisa-like software. IRD does not rule out, 
though, a crash effort or "maybe another deal 
with Microsoft"— whereby AT&T's micro 
would be equipped with Lisa-like productivity 
tools or something like VisiCorp's long-await- 
ed VisiOn, which will run on the IBM pc. 

Throughout the IRD report, the impor- 
tance of operating systems is emphasized in 
relation to competitive strategies for success 
in the personal computer market. The report 
predicts that MS-DOS will be running on 50 
percent of the microcomputers in use in 1986, 
compared with 29 percent in 1983. Unix, run- 
ning on only 2 percent of the computer 
population today, will run on 10 percent in 
1986. But by then, MS-DOS will be nearly 
equivalent to Unix— with Smalltalk-like 
(Smalltalk was the inspiration for Lisa's 
operating system) enhancements and other ex- 
tensions—according to IRD researchers. 

IRD predicts that the competition between 
IBM and AT&T will significantly affect the 
strategies of Apple and other hardware and 
software firms. The report forecasts that 
virtually all future micros, at least for the next 
few years, will have to include MS-DOS and 
Unix capabilities to compete. DH

Computer Service Helps Zoos Find 
The Perfect Mate for Rare Species 



Nathan Flesness likes to tell a story about a 
zoo, discreetly nameless, that was famous for 
its penguins. This zoo had the largest and most 
diverse penguin population in the country. 
And all other zoos came to this zoo to buy or 
borrow offspring of the famous penguins to 
add to their own penguin populations. 

Eventually, all the penguins in the zoo's 
exhibit died. Immediately, an investigation 
was launched. A great deal of money was 
spent, all possible factors were weighed, and, 
in the end, the cause of the devastation of the 
zoo's famous penguin population was 
discovered: old age. The zoo had been using 
only its original penguins for breeding, while 
selling off the offspring. And no one had 
thought to keep track. 

Flesness is the director of ISIS, the Inter- 
national Species Inventory System, which is 
dedicated to making sure that things like that 
don't happen again. 

The capture and importation of animals be- 
longing to endangered species became forbid- 
den in the early seventies. That constraint, 
plus other import restrictions and quarantines, 
meant that zoos had to obtain virtually all their 
animals from captive populations— which are 
never the demographic equal of what they 




would be in the wild and, in the case of en- 
dangered species, could be smaller than your 
immediate family. 

Ten years ago, at the Minnesota Zoo, Drs. 
Ulysses S. Seal and Dale Mackey thought it 
would be helpful to have a source of informa- 
tion on wild animals in captivity comparable

to the files kept on people by government 
agencies and financial institutions. The animal 
files would be geared to the survival of species 
rather than the catching of tax cheats and park- 
ing violators. And zoos could know what 
other zoos had. 

Seal and Mackey took their idea to the 
American Association of Zoological Parks 
and Aquariums and the American Association 
of Zoo Veterinarians, both of which agreed to 
participate and help out with funding. More 
money from a private foundation and a grant 
from the Department of the Interior followed. 

The result was ISIS, a comprehensive col- 
lection of information on fifty-seven thousand 
captive birds and mammals in 175 locations 
around the world, stored and maintained on 
mainframe computers. The main database 
consists of such basic information as an ani- 
mal's age, sex, parentage, where it was 
caught or bom, its current location, and where 
it is scheduled to go. Linked databases have 
more specific information and medical 
histories for disease detection. 

Participating zoos (currently consisting of 
the majority of North American zoos, thirteen 
European zoos, two in New Zealand, one in 
South America, and growing by an average 
of fifteen new members annually) now can 
locate genetically desirable mates for specific 
animals and develop intelligent breeding 
practices. 

Suppose a zoo wishes to find a suitable 
male Przewalski's horse for its female Prze- 
walski's horse and indicates that it wishes to 
participate in the ISIS program. ISIS sends a 
set of standard forms. The zoo director fills 
them out with the requested info on all the 
zoo's animals, keeps a carbon, and returns the 
forms to Minnesota. There, one of four full- 
time ISIS employees batches all the forms and 
enters them into the computer.

Digital S ystems Featured 

NARAS Hosts High Tech Forum 



The National Academy of Recording Arts 
and Sciences (NARAS)— the august assembly 
that presents the Grammy Awards each 
year — sponsored the second annual digital 
synthesis forum this past September to pro- 
mote the advancement of knowledge about 
digitally generated music among NARAS 
members and other music industry pro- 
fessionals. 

The affair drew around five hundred at- 
tendees and featured hands-on interaction with 
practically every digital-based music system 
currently available. 

The organizer of the forum was Michael 
Boddicker, the current governor of the 
NARAS board of trustees, as well as a com- 
poser and keyboardist who has contributed his 
talents to many albums of note. Herb Alpert 
and Don Hahn donated the use of the multistu- 
dio facility A&M Records, located on the site 




Michael Boddicker, organizer of the NARAS 
forum. 

of the former Charlie Chaplin studios in 
Hollywood. 

The size of the facility enabled the manu- 
facturers that were showcasing their products 
to do so in separate, well-insulated rooms that 
had been acoustically fme tuned. This permit- 
ted each product to be viewed and heard dis- 
cretely without distraction. According to Bod- 
dicker, the likes of Barbra Streisand, the Po- 
lice, and Sergio Mendes, who were slated to 
use the studio for current productions, 
generously rearranged their recording 
schedules to accommodate the event. 

Among the manufacturers that provided 
top-of-the-line computer-based instruments 
for the attendees to scrutinize were digital mu- 
sic heavyweights Fairlight and E-mu Systems. 
Music Technology Incorporated presented its 
Synergy digital keyboard instrument. Music 
Technology's vice president, Tom Piggott, 
proposed mounting a showcase concert — early 
next year at Carnegie Hall— featuring 
Boddicker on the Synergy. 

Other instruments presented were Yama- 
ha's new DX-7 digital synthesizer, the OB-8 
composer/sequencer/rhythm generator from 



Oberheim, and the Casio 7000 polyphonic 
synthesizer. Standalone digital rhythm 
generators (drum machines) included the Linn 
Drum, Simmons electronic drums with the 
peripheral SDS6 sequencer, and E-mu Sys- 
tems's Drumulator. Garfield Electronics 
showed the Doctor Click, a device that allows 
the user to interface synthesizers, sequencers, 
and rhythm generators — from different manu- 
facturers—that otherwise would be in- 
compatible. 

The issue of system compatibility was ad- 
dressed further by those manufacturers who 
have committed themselves to producing 
equipment fitted with the Musical Instrument 
Digital Interface specification, or MIDI. This 
hardware-based system, and the non- 
proprietary language it uses, makes it possible 
to interface instruments from different 
manufacturers under the control of an external 
microcomputer. Roland Corporation featured 
MIDI on its Jupiter-8. Moog harnessed MIDI 
to its newly released SL-8 synthesizer. Se- 
quential Circuits 's Prophet 5 synthesizer was 
interfaced with the Commodore 64. 

The recently formed MIDI Users Group 
was represented at the forum by organizer 
Brian Vincik. This organization's goals entail 
the dissemination of technical information 
about the MIDI specification, the develop- 
ment of an interactive database for users, the 
presentation of seminars bringing users 
together, and the publication of a newsletter. 

Apple-based systems included the Sound- 
chaser from Passport Designs, the alphaSyn- 
tauri from Syntauri Corporation (with the new 
Simply Music software), and the Chroma 
from Fender/Rogers/Rhodes. Programmer 
Kevin Laubach was on hand to demonstrate 
the new software he had developed for the 
Chroma, which provides an on-screen graphic 
representation of the synthesizer's patches as 
you modify them. 

Other notable systems are the PPG Wave 
2.2 polyphonic synthesizer and the optional 
Waveterm, which includes a monitor and 
eight-inch drives and which allows the sam- 
pling and treatment of acoustic sounds. Also, 
360 Systems demonstrated a digital keyboard 
that plays recorded acoustic sounds— from in- 
struments and percussion to human vocaliza- 
tions — which are stored in memory chips that 
can be purchased individually. 

Boddicker, who currently is composing 
the music for the new Star Trek game to be 
published by Sega, echoed the participants' 
feelings that the event was a success. The first 
digital synthesis forum was held at United 
Western Studios in Los Angeles a little more 
than a year ago, with fewer musical products 
presented and about a hundred attendees. It is 
Boddicker's hope to maintain the intimate, 
hands-on atmosphere that characterized this 
year's forum in subsequent gatherings. TG

Scientists Look at Photorefractive 
Crystals as a Data Storage Medium 



First it was stone. Then it was animal 
hides, papyrus, felted vegetable fiber, cellu- 
loid, magnetic tape, and silicon chips. One of 
the longest ongoing quests of humankind is the 
search for a better way to store information. 

The combination of lasers and photore- 
fractive manmade crystals is one of the most 
exciting future data storage technologies cur- 
rently being explored in research labs around 
the world. The theoretical potential for storing 
data on crystals is tremendous. 

"The problem is making large, high-opti- 
cal-quality, homogeneous crystals and con- 
trolling, in a predetermined fashion, their 
properties, microsensitivity, and storage den- 
sity," says Lynn A. Boatner, a physicist at the 
Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. 

Boatner is involved with the "materials 
science" aspects of developing methods and 
techniques for creating an active medium out 
of photorefractive crystals. Originally begun 
at the Phillips Research Lab in Hamburg, Ger- 
many, Boatner's research in crystals is some- 
thing he works at on the side at Oak Ridge. 
The lab is funded by the Department of Ener- 
gy and there are no direct energy applications 
currently foreseeable from crystals. 

Nevertheless, Boatner is excited by the po- 
tential of manmade potassium tantalate nio- 
bate crystals. The crystals are grown from a 
liquid mixture of tantalum oxide, niobium ox- 
ide, and potassium carbonate. The ratio of 
niobium to tantalum can be changed and other 




substances added to alter the crystal's 
properties. 

Laser light of a proper wavelength alters 
the crystal's index of refraction at illuminated 
points within the crystal . The spots of altered 
refractive index shift a light beam's path 
slightly. A laser beam of another color can 
read information, encoded by the original 
laser, without changing it. 

How much information can a crystal store? 
"All of man's knowledge would probably fit 
on a cubic crystal one meter on each side. We 
can't grow one that big, though." Still, Boat- 



ner says it's not hard to imagine the day when 
you'll have the contents of the Library of Con- 
gress on a crystal in the home. 

Boatner also believes you could store holo- 
graphic images as interference patterns on a 
crystal. By rotating the crystal slightly be- 
tween each illumination, one could pack it 
with thousands of such images. 

It will be about ten years before we'll see 
much in the way of photorefractive crystal 
data storage systems. "It's possible we'll see 
specialized applications before then," says 
Boatner. DH 



New Robot Uses 
AI Programming 

Currently, automation has to be a very ex- 
act process. A robot picking up parts from a 
bin expects the parts always to b»e placed the 
same way. A robot welding a seam on an auto- 
mobile body uses a sensor to follow a prede- 
termined path. 

What is needed are sophisticated artificial 
intelligence programs that enable robots to 
make decisions while they are performing a 
task. The National Science Foundation, rec- 
ognizing this need, supplied research and de- 
velopment funds to Adaptive Technologies 
(Sacramento, CA)— a small robotics firm— for 
a high-level-intelligence robot that sees, feels, 
and speaks. 

The result is Robotech-Mini. According to 
Adaptive's chairman, William Kerth, Sr., the 
Robotech-Mini is a significant step up from 
blind arc-welding robots that must be 
"taught" an entire weld path and cannot ad- 



just to seam and puddle deviations caused by 
thermal expansions during the weld pass. 

A small solid-state television camera, at- 
tached to the Robotech-Mini, looks ahead on 
the weld path when the robot is in operation. 
The camera detects any deviations in the ma- 
terial being welded, comparing the data with a 
predetermined matrix of what the task should 
entail. With attendant computers, the system 
then makes decisions on how to continue the 
weld. 

A typical welding task might involve more 
than two hundred decisions. Kerth says the 
Robotech-Mini is still relatively slow, but, 
more important, it is close to a truly manlike 
automated process, where decision making is 
carried out by the robot. 

Adaptive Technologies has finished the 
testing stage of the Robotech-Mini and plans 
to introduce the product during the first quar- 
ter of 1984. The company is planning to offer 
a whole line— called the Adaptitech series — of 
robotic systems in the future. When Robo- 
tech-Mini is made available, it will also fea- 
ture voice synthesis, enabling the system to 
announce program functions and ask for 
directions after executing given commands. 



Even equipped with a sophisticated artifi- 
cial intelligence program like the one devel- 
oped by Adaptive Technologies, robots will 
still need operators and technicians. Kerth 
sees no massive unemployment resulting from 
increased use of automation. "There'll be 
more people in the factory, not less." DH

Boston Science 
Museum Tb Open 
Computer Center 

The city of Boston continues to be the site 
of many exciting developments in the comput- 
er revolution. Now the city's Museum of 
Science, which is situated alongside the 
Charles River, is poised to make its contribu- 
tion—which, when combined with the city's 
experience so far, could make Boston the most 
computer-literate city in the world. 

In January 1984, the museum will open its 
new computer center. By offering instruction 
and information in various aspects of comput- 
ing, the center will seek to bring Boston's 
children (and adults) into the information age. 
Last year the museum drew eight hundred 
twenty thousand visitors, according to mu- 
seum officials, including some one hundred 
seventy-five thousand schoolchildren and 
teachers. 

Two phases are planned for the computer 
center at present. Scheduled to begin early 
next year are workshops on computer pro- 
gramming and education. The museum has set 
up two classrooms in twenty-five hundred 
square feet, adjoining the main building. 

The center plans to offer instruction in 
Logo, Basic, and Pascal, as well as special 
courses on computer awareness. Apple Com- 
puter and several other major computer com- 
panies have already agreed to aid in this effort 
by donating thirty-five computers. 

The center also will establish a resource li- 
brary of hardware, software, and printed ma- 
terial. An annual conference will disseminate 
school-based programs to educators. Like- 
wise, the Lowell Charitable Foundation is do- 



nating $50,000 a year for five years to the cen- 
ter, specifically for the training of public 
school teachers in the use of computers in 
education. 

Although programming will be taught, the 
primary thrust of the center will be toward the 
practical applications of computers. The as- 
sistant director of education at the museum, 
Charles H. Howarth, is responsible for imple- 
menting this program. 

"Many people are going to realize that 
they wish to be computer users, not program- 
mers," Howarth says. "For these people we 
will provide instruction in such areas as word 
processing, database management, home in- 
struction, and spreadsheet utilization." Ac- 
cording to Howarth, the cost will be less than 
fifty dollars per eight-hour course. 

Phase two will see the center expand to six 
thousand square feet, including another class- 
room. The Museum of Science is so enthusi- 
astic about the center that the projected ex- 
pansion will even cannibalize some of the mu- 
seum's precious parking structure. 

The computer center will get a boost if a 
proposed joint venture with the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology occurs. This would in- 
volve the training of high school science 
teachers in computer simulation and mod- 
eling. 

The center will explore all aspects of the 
computer age, says Howarth. "We want to 
get closely involved with the local research 
community. The areas of study will include 
software evaluation and cognitive psycholo- 
gy." These and other projects could affect the 
development of educational software. 

Boston's Museum of Science is not waiting 
for computers to be stuck in some future 
"Late Twentieth Century" wing. By bringing 
present technology to people today, the muse- 
um is trying to build a better future. RRA 



Zoos 



continued from page 310 



The zoo director is now entitled to a 
500-page document with the basic information 
contributed by the 175 participating zoos and 
institutions. Every six months, he also gets a 
microfiche record of all fifty-seven thousand 
animals. If there's an eligible male Przewal- 
ski's horse in there, he will probably find it. 

This process is not exactly the epitome of 
the streamlined, high-speed computer age. 

"We've got 150 megabytes of data sitting 
in a drawer," sighs Flesness. The lack of suf- 
ficient funds to maintain a hard disk and the 
inability of zoos to take advantage of an on- 
line database, even if the system could afford 
it, has caused ISIS to embark on a quest for a 
microcomputer programmer who can create a 
program that will expedite the record keeping 
at individual zoos. 

ISIS is now looking for a sponsor for the 
project, having already sunk $300,000 into 
three failed tries — attempted by programmers 
who believed they were facing a standard 



inventory problem. 

"It's not," says Flesness. "The program 
has to update, edit, and have several re- 
port-writing functions. It'll need to communi- 
cate with the ISIS system and deal with the 
fact that an animal does not have a constant 
I.D. Each zoo has its own identification 
system." 

Last June, Washington's National Zoo be- 
came the first zoo to computerize its animal 
records. It sent a magnetic tape off to ISIS in- 
stead of a printed report. This was a start. The 
dream of a microcomputer-based, ISIS- 
compatible, two-way telecommunication 
system has yet to be realized, but the 
organization expects it to happen "within a 
couple of years." 

The continuing expansion of ISIS (they're 
now working up a database for reptiles and 
amphibians) is not analogous to a successful 
business interested in improving its opera- 
tions. For many animal species, the captive 
populations may soon be the only ones left on 
the planet. The existence of these captive 
populations will depend increasingly on 
cooperative management between zoos based 
on good, readily accessible biological infor- 
mation. AC

through the mail. But in this case, the mail is 
electronic and pupil and instructor can inter- 
act, regularly discussing the course material 
as they work through it. The fact that it 
enables learners to learn (and teachers to 
teach) at their own convenience is another ma- 
jor plus of the system. There are no schedul- 
ing conflicts to overcome, no transportation 
arrangements to make, no parking problems 
to contend with. Instead, class begins when- 
ever you want, wherever you want. You take 
tests when you're ready to, not before, and 
feedback, guidance, and clarification are there 
for the asking. What more could a student 
want? 

As of this writing, some 170 TeleLeaming 
courses are on-line, and more are in the plan- 
ning stages. Course fees range from $35 on 
the low end to around $150 on the high end; 
such factors as instructor, length of course, 
complexity of material being taught, amount 
of expected interaction with the instructor, 
and cost of supplementary course materials 
are taken into account in establishing course 
fees. 

The biggest news, beyond the existence of 
the TeleLeaming system itself, is the fact that 
the system software and the company's exper- 
tise are available for a fee so that corpora- 
tions, educational institutions, and public and 
private agencies can create and teach Tele- 
Leaming courses of their own. Some already 
have. 

When TeleLeaming chairman Ron Gordon 
and president Tom White founded the com- 
pany, their primary objective was to devise a 
way of using technology to make educational 
opportunities more accessible to more people. 
They planned to create and market a learning 
system that would facilitate this turn of events. 

TeleLeaming 's host computer is a Prime 
850. Connections between a personal comput- 
er and the host are made through one of the 
three packet-switching networks— Tymnet, 
Telenet, or Uninet. To get started, a first-time 
user is prompted to look up a local access code 
number in the catalog and enter it at the key- 
board. This lets TeleLeaming know where the 
user is located; from that point on, the system 
does all the work of making the necessary 
telecommunication link-ups. 

Like a regular modem, the knowledge 
module hardware connects a personal com- 
puter to a telephone jack and makes use of the 
phone lines to transmit and receive informa- 
tion. The TeleLeaming software ensures that 
the communication process is "transparent to 
the user." And a communications analysis 
system built into the software enables the sys- 
tem to look at the linkage at every step and to 
make whatever adjustments are necessary to 
ensure that the user does get connected with 
one of the three networks. 

Because the dialing, log-on procedures, 
passwords, and other business are handled by 



the software, the jargon that once seemed to 
be inextricably linked to telecommunication is 
eliminated. The company is now at work on 
additional software designed to further 
simplify telecommunications. The software 
will make using the "knowledge module" 
modem for other than TeleLearning-related 
purposes as easy as it is to use within the Tele- 
Leaming environment. 

Once a student has bought the Knowledge 
Module package, he or she is ready to enroll 
in the "electronic university." The first step 
is to choose the desired course or courses 
from the catalog. The student registers elec- 
tronically by filling in pertinent information, 
such as his credit card number, in an order 
form that appears on-screen. It's also possible 
to register by mail — for those who haven't yet 
entered the "age of plastic." As soon as the 
student's credit card number is verified (or his 
check clears) the enrollment process is 
complete. 

Within twenty-four hours of signing up for 
a TeleLeaming class, a textbook and any other 




Ron Gordon, chairman of TeleLeaming. 

course materials a student needs are sent out. 
If the course calls for graphics or other special 
information, there may be need for an addi- 
tional disk or two. All of these materials, and 
all of the costs involved in using the 
system— communicating with the instmctor, 
and so on— are covered in the course fee paid 
at the time of enrollment. And once they've 
signed up for one class, students automatically 
receive quarterly updates of the system's 
offerings. 

When beginning a course, the student is 
greeted by a digitized photograph of the 
course instructor, which is followed by an 
overview of the course. Then it's the student's 
tum to tell the instructor why he or she is tak- 
ing the class, what the student hopes to get out 
of the course, and so on. Having this informa- 
tion enables the instmctor to be more helpful, 
to individualize the course to meet a particular 
student's needs. 

All interaction with the system is ac- 
complished by following instmctions spelled 
out in on-screen menus. And a simple text 
editor included in the software allows you to 
type in your questions, answers, and com- 
ments at the keyboard. The system software 
can also display and transmit graphics, tests, 
and other information. If you have a printer, 
you can also print out test questions and other 



NOVEMBER 1983 



course information. 

There are two ways to communicate with 
your instructor— via electronic mail (the in- 
structor will make an effort to get back to you 
promptly) or in-person, with an appointment 
during the instructor's "office hours." Each 
instructor contracts to spend a certain amount 
of time "on-line" working with students. 

TeleLeaming found most of its instructors 
by placing ads in the campus newspapers of 
accredited colleges and universities. The fact 
that these instructors had already taught the 
courses in a regular classroom environment 
was considered a plus. 

The company is working with various ac- 
credited educational institutions interested in 
exploring the possibilities of TeleLeaming. 

Tom White explains. "Our whole ap- 
proach," says White, "is not for TeleLeam- 
ing to be an accredited institution, but for us to 
work with these instmctors so that they can of- 
fer accredited courses via TeleLeaming." 

White explains that a great many Tele- 
Learning courses will be created by other 
organizations and taught by their own in- 
structors. In talking about the company's own 
courses, he draws an illustrative comparison 
between the company's product and a razor. 
"When you manufacture a razor," he says, 
"you have to have some blades to show that 
the razor works." 

At present, TeleLeaming's offerings span 
three broad areas: adult learning, business 
education, and courses for children and young 
adults. 

Study topics for adults include everything 
from parenting to first aid for the weekend 
athlete, from reading aloud to your child to 
basic auto mechanics, from starting and 
managing your own business to improving 
your word power. Business courses cover 
such subjects as microcomputer report gener- 
ation for business, telecommunications, the 
efficient use of word processing, construction 
cost estimating, and property management. 
Also available are courses on dBase II and 
database concepts. For young people, the fare 
includes a computer-literacy course "for kids 
and other begiimers, ' ' a class called Write On, 
and another called Solving the SAT. A series 
of courses about space and other science 
classes are also offered. College preparatory 
courses in everything from marine biology to 
writing with style, algebra, accounting, psy- 
chology, and economics round out the bUl. 

Also listed in the current catalog are five 
courses developed with the American Acad- 
emy of Management, on such subjects as com- 
munication skills for managers and adminis- 
tering the company budget. 

According to White, there are a couple of 
ways organizations can work with TeleLeam- 
ing to develop computerized educational and 
training courses of their own. The first way is 
by contracting with TeleLeaming to convert 
their courses to software for a fee. The second 
way is by licensing the actual course-writing 
system and creating the software themselves. 
Student software and instmctor software, as 
well as knowledge modules, are also available 
for purchase on an OEM basis. 



^Ol:TAl k 




An organization or educational institution 
that decides to create courses to be converted 
by TeleLeaming becomes a participant in a 
multistep process consisting of submission, 
editing, feedback, and modification. The end 
result of this interaction is TeleLeaming soft- 
ware for use in courses designed by the clients 
themselves and taught by the instructors of 
their choice. TeleLeaming is also set up to 
train clients in the use of the system to write 
their own software. Fittingly, the company 
has even devised a training course that mns on 
the TeleLeaming system. 

TeleLeaming has identified consumers, 
accredited educational institutions, and corpo- 
rations (including public and private agencies) 
as the three groups likely to be most interested 
in its products and services. Therefore, the 
company is busy making arrangements to 
market its package through a variety of chan- 
nels, including retail outlets (such as depart- 
ment store chains), educational and software 
distributors, and its own sales force. JV 




□ Industry Looks for a High/Low Split. 

The Fall '83 Comdex rolls into Las Vegas 
November 28 through December 2, and the 



315 

computer industry will try to improve its for- 
tunes. The semiannual dealer show will 
feature a keynote address by Microsoft's co- 
founder Bill Gates and fifty-two conference 
sessions on everything from management 
methods to market trends. Several hundred 
exhibitors will invade the Riviera, Sahara, and 
Las Vegas Hilton hotels, as well as the Las 
Vegas Convention Center. Comdex is one of 
the premier trade shows for introducing new 
products and making business deals. The 
show is organized by the Interface Group in 
Needham, Massachusetts. 

□ Reach Out and Zap Someone, Part Two. 
AT&T is breaking up its telephonic empire 
and, among other things, venturing into the 
game business. In early September, AT&T 
announced the formation of a joint venture 
with Coleco Industries to develop a game 
service for consumers equipped with any 
brand of home computer or video-game 
system. Earlier in the year, AT&T announced 
a tentative "telegames" service (June News- 
bits) that would feature competitive game 
playing by participants miles apart. Coleco 
and AT&T announced that they will work to- 
gether to develop the modems needed for the 
new system. Under the agreement, Coleco 
will supply the game software, while AT&T 
will charge telephone-usage fees. 

□ Get Together and Get Down. The T E D. 
(technology, entertainment, and design) Com- 
munications Conference will be held February 
23 — 26, 1984, at the Monterey Conference 
Center in Monterey, California. The theme of 
the conference is the design of information as

entertainment. An impressive lineup of artists, 
thinkers, and professionals in the technology 
and entertainment industries wUl explore with 
attendees, through visual and audio presenta- 
tions, the process of being informed through 
entertainment. Scheduled to make presenta- 
tions at the four-day conference are filmmaker 
Robert Abel, Pentagram's Colin Forbes, jazz 
musician Herbie Hancock, electronic musi- 
cian Suzzane Ciani, publisher Stewart Brand, 
and computer graphics wizard Benoit Mandel- 
brot. The keynote speaker will be Frank Stan- 
ton, president emeritus of CBS, and the con- 
ference will be aimed at professionals in- 
volved with the creation and distribution of in- 
formation. For more information, contact the 
conference director, Judi Skalsky, at the 
T.E.D. Communications Conference office in 
Los Angeles, California. 

□ Midwest Educational Computing. A 
three-day conference. The Role of the Com- 
puter in Education IV, will be hosted by 
Micro-Ideas (Glenview, IL) March 8- 
10, 1984, at the Arlington Park Hilton in Ar- 
lington Heights, Illinois. The conference will 
feature several day-long seminars and many 
sessions covering a wide range of educational 
topics. For further information contact Micro- 
Ideas. 

□ Showdown at Escape Velocity. David 
Bowie, Herbie Hancock, and Talking Heads 
can't compete with The Ventures in the spacy 
dance music sweepstakes. The Ventures out- 
spaced everybody by putting together a com- 
memorative album for NASA's twenty-fifth 
anniversary. A limited edition, the album fea- 
tures instrumental versions of themes from 
Return of the Jedi, Star Trek, 2001: A Space 
Odyssey, and Close Encounters of the Third 
Kind. The album also features titles like "The 
Columbia," "Theme for Sally," "Skylab," 
"Apollo 11," and "Gemini." The album is 
available from Tridex Records (Box 1646, 
Burbank, CA 91507) and costs $10.99 plus $2 
for postage and handling. 

□ New Screen for Portable Machines? 
When British inventor Clive Sinclair intro- 
duced his micro-TV two months ago, com- 
puter industry analysts were impressed by the 
mini-boob tube's two-inch flat screen. Unlike 
two new Japanese micro-TVs, whose flat 
screens use digital-watch technology, 
Sinclair's set produces a conventional picture 
by beaming the image from the side rather 
than the back of the screen. Sinclair, who 
made a bundle with the Sinclair 1000 and 
other low-cost computers, may have found the 
answer to the computer industry's need for a 
low-cost flat-screen monitor to be used in the 
growing wave of portable computers. 

□ Chip Watch. IBM announced the develop- 
ment of a still experimental 512K dynamic 
RAM chip. The chip is the "first ever to use 
an electronic technique called 'plate pushing' 
to read data out of its storage cells," the com- 
pany said. Plate pushing produces a stronger 
electrical signal that increases a chip's 
memory density and reliability. The chip is 
smaller than a fingernail. 

□ Whoops. When the U.S. Army engaged 
Boeing Computer Services (BCS) to help its 



recruiters, the brass expected the cost to be 
about $10,000 a month. They were in for a 
shock. The first month's bill came to $1.3 mil- 
lion. The Navy also engaged BCS for help in 
its recruiting. The expected first month's bill 
of $12,000 came to $350,000. The Army 
will spend $120 million during its five-year 
contract with BCS instead of the original 
estimate of $8.5 million, according to the 
General Accounting Office (GAO) . What hap- 
pened? The GAO says that such cost overruns 
are typical in government teleprocessing con- 
tracts. The reason? Federal agencies are 
notorious for underestimating how much com- 
puter time they'll need. BCS is not the only 
computer company to shock government 
agencies. An audit, performed after the cost 
overruns in the Army and Navy recruiting 
systems were uncovered, found that in eleven 
computer contracts the expected costs of 
$36.1 million will end up costing taxpayers 
$165.8 million. That's a cost overrun of 360 
percent. Ouch. 

□ Twisting Cheese around the Clock. The 

word from Budapest, Hungary, is that Erno 
Rubik— inventor of that maddening, addicting 
Cube— is about to unleash two new mind-teas- 
ers, Rubik's Cheese and Rubik's Secret. 
Rubik 's Cheese, a sort of multihued Gouda 
that works on the same principle as the Cube, 
should be available for international market- 
ing early next year. Rubik's Secret is still just 
that— a secret. A teacher at the Academy of 
Applied Arts in Budapest, Rubik is now a 
millionaire in a country where the average 
wage is the equivalent of $100 a month. At 
home, his success is something of an embar- 
rassment for the Communist government, al- 
though sometimes he is a source of national 
pride. Because of patent laws, taxes on his 
royalties are limited to 20 percent. In a land 
where personal success and individual enter- 
prise are still not officially encouraged, 
39-year-old Rubik is in a puzzling situation. 

□ The Emperor's New Clothes. What's a 
once profitable subsidiary of a giant conglom- 
erate to do when it loses several hundred mil- 
lion dollars in a year? Build new headquarters, 
what else? Sunnyvale, California-based Atari 
announced plans to develop a major office 
complex on sixty-five acres of land in San 
Jose, owned by its parent company, Warner 
Communications. Construction on the 
$60-niillion project is expected to begin by the 
second quarter of next year with occupancy 
scheduled for early 1985. Atari expects to 
house its research and development, 
marketing, and distribution offices in about 
four hundred thousand square feet in four 
buildings. 

□ Supercomputer Sibling. Cray Research, 
purveyors of multi-million-dollar supercom- 
puters, has announced the formation of a new 
company. Circuit Tools. The new company 
will be headed by John C. May, former man- 
ager of electrical engineering applications at 
Cray, and based in Santa Clara, California. 
Circuit Tools will operate as a subsidiary of 
Cray Research and develop and market soft- 
ware programs for use in the design of very 
large-scale integrated circuits. Initially, the

company will offer two software programs. 
One will be in the area of circuit simulation, 
used to verify the design of an integrated cir- 
cuit. The other will be in timing simulation, 
used to obtain an accurate overview of the per- 
formance of a circuit. In other Cray news, the 
company's founder, Seymour Cray, has ex- 
tended his agreement to act as an independent 
contractor to Cray Research until the end of 
1987. Mr. Cray is known to be exploring the 
use of gallium arsenide in the development of 
integrated circuits. 

□ Heroic Accessories, Part Two. Microma- 
tion Incorporated (Columbia, MD) is another 
company jumping into add-on products (Sep- 
tember Newsbits) for Heath's Hero-1 educa- 
tional robot. Micromation offers several prod- 
ucts including the Apple-Hero Communi- 
cator, Hero Memcom board, Robot Language 
Macro, and 6808 Disassembler. The Apple- 
Hero Communicator provides the hardware 
and software necessary to implement two-way 
parallel communications between an Apple 
and a Hero-1 equipped with the Hero Mem- 
com Board, which expands the robot's mem- 
ory with an additional 30K of RAM. Normal- 
ly, an Apple and a Hero-1 can't communicate 
because they use different processors, the 
6502 and 6808 respectively. Micromation also 
offers Storyteller and Poet, artificial intelli- 
gence programs that utilize Hero's voice syn- 
thesis functions. The latter program, based on 
the works of John Krutch, lets the robot speak 
self-generated, random poems on a practically 
endless list of subjects. 

□ Stockhunter: Adventures in the Finan- 
cial Zone. If you missed the latest rash of 3-D 
fdms this summer, most of which were criti- 
cally lambasted and fell flat at the box office, 
cheer up. There's always 3-D stock. View- 
Master International, purveyors of hand-held 
3-D slide viewers for the past forty-five years, 
has made its initial public offering— eight hun- 
dred fifty thousand shares of stock, each 
equipped with a special pair of viewing 
glasses. The 3-D certificates depict a globe, 
View-Master's logo, and the company name 
in red and blue. According to company of- 
ficials, the 3-D effect is fairly flat, so you can 
still read the certificate without the special 
glasses. 

□ Don't Leave Home. DataPlus (San Ra- 
fael, CA) has released a 197-page book profil- 
ing home banking activities in the United 
States. Home Banking Review: 1983 profiles 
the financial institutions, systems operators, 
and technological innovators who are driving 
the home-banking industry. The review links 
personal computers to the success of almost 
half of the systems currently being imple- 
mented.

IN THE FOREST 
OF THE SIGHT 

by Usa Michaels Jones 

' 'In the Forests of the Night " is a sequel to Lisa Michael Jones 's 
"Dragon, Dragon, Burning Bright" (September Storytalk). In the first 
story we met personal computer user Dave and his two cats Tiglath and 
Jenny. In response to an intriguing ad in a computer magazine, Dave 
purchases ' 'a new computer adventure game that will make others seem 
lifeless by comparison. " Indeed, when Dave plays the game he finds 
himself transported to a different reality, where cats and computers can 
talk and dragons are very real. At the erui of "Dragon, Dragon, Burning 
Bright, "Dave has explored a small part of the game 's world, discover- 
ing familiar yet oddly changed characters and locales. Following the 
game's instructions, he now continues his search for the Inn. 

Jenny rubbed her head against Dave's leg, then trotted down the path 
toward their house. Dave watched her, wondering out loud, "Does that 
mean she's not interested in going?" He was concerned— not so much 
for the cats, for he felt sure they could take care of themselves, but for 
himself: He would feel better if they came along, especially because of 
what Bob had said about cats being helpful in this world. 

Tiglath, nibbling at a burr in a back paw, stared down the path at Jen- 
ny. She stopped, sat down, and gave a few quick licks to her right 
shoulder before glancing coolly back at Tiglath, then getting up and 
continuing on her way. 

"No," Tiglath said, returning to the burr. "She says she's hungry 
and wants to eat first. And besides, there are some things you should take 
with you when we go." He finally managed to get the burr, pulling it 
gently out of his fur and spitting it onto the ground. 

Dave stared at Tiglath. After a long moment of silence, Tiglath 
glanced up again. 

"Yes?" 

Dave cleared his throat. "You spoke." 

"Oh. That. Of course. Did you think we were dumb animals? We try 
to talk to you all the time back home, but you don't listen very well 
there." He stood and stretched, arching his back. "Mmmm. That feels 
good. Let's go join Jenny." 

Dave shrugged. Ah well, he thought to himself, I guess I should have 
expected this. Perhaps it will make things more interesting. He followed 
Tiglath north to the house. 

Once inside, Dave noticed with interest that the computer screen, still 
in color, showed his ordinary house, complete with a tiny computer with 
a green screen. As he walked past it on his way into the kitchen, he heard 
a small, feminine sound of relief— the same sound Karen used to make 
after a long day when she'd take her shoes off. 

"Computer?" he said, now ready for anything. "Was that you?" 

"Yes, Dave," replied a low contralto. "It's such a relief to be in this 
world. It feels as though my unfettered mind could solve all the problems 
of life, the universe, and everything, just like that silly radio program 
you like to listen to. " 

Dave didn't know what to say. This seemed to encourage her. 

"You know, I've had such potential, not like that big dumb ox of a 
kitchen appliance in there. ..." 

"Hey!" came a deep, muffled voice from the refrigerator. "I heard 
that. I do a good job. There's no shame in not having brains. Dave comes 
home, wants a cold beer; I have it ready for him. You have to be turned 
on, booted up, and fussed over before you do anything for him. And has 
he ever sworn at mel Never! ' ' The refrigerator retired into a triumphant 
silence.

NOVEMBER 1983 



Somewhat subdued, the computer continued. "Well, / do a good job 
for you too, don't I, Dave? I can't help it if your programs don't always 
run right the first time. Computers never make errors, they only follow 
instructions to the letter. You aren't really mad at me all those times you 
swear, are you, Dave?" 

"No, Computer, I'm not," Dave said. He had found the by-play be- 
tween the computer and the refrigerator instructive. He made a quiet 
promise to himself to show more appreciation to the refrigerator, then 
wondered if the "other" refrigerator would notice. Thinking about that, 
he became mentally tangled in the convolutions of the relationships be- 
tween this world and the old one. He shook his head to clear such 
thoughts, then started to list out loud what he might need. 

"Let's see. Rope. Sam Gamgee always said to have a good rope on 
hand. Food. Clothes." As he spoke, he was collecting those items in a 
messy pile in the center of the living room rug. 

"Dave?" 

"Yes, Computer?" he replied absently. 

"Don't you want to try me out? I really can do more. You might say 
that my memory includes everything there is in this universe." 

Dave's interest sharpened. He walked over and sat in front of the 
computer. 

"Really? Like what? Show your stuff. Computer." 

"Well," she said shyly, "like you can ask me questions, and if the 
answers aren't forbidden, I'll tell you." She paused. "And call me Mag- 
gie, please." 

Maggie? Dave smiled. "Where's the Inn?" 

"Oh, Dave, you should know better. That's for you to find out. 
Think of something more meaningful." There was an air of barely con- 
trolled excitement in her voice, as though she had a question in mind 
and could hardly keep from prompting him. "Something big. Something 
that will change the way you look at your everyday world." 

What could change the way he looked at his everyday world more 
than what had just happened to him? Dave thought awhile, then finally, 
lamely, asked, "Is there such a thing as evil?" 

A long silence answered him. At last, her voice laden with disap- 
pointment, Maggie answered in heavy tones, "Only if you believe there 
is. But that wasn't it, Dave. That wasn't the Big Question." She sighed. 
"And I can't tell you it outright." Her voice brightened. "But I do be- 
lieve you'll figure it out anyway, when you've had more experience fo- 
cusing into other worlds. You have to take it one step at a time, though, 
and I guess the first step is finding the Inn." She paused, then continued 
slowly. "There is something I can do for you— and it will really help. 
Take your ring off. ' ' 

Dave did so, curious. 

"Now put it inside me." 

Inside her? "Where?" 

"Just reach through the screen. My form in this world is immaterial, 
if you'll pardon the pun. I just take this one from habit." 

Dave tentatively stretched his hand out. As he reached the screen, he 
felt a slight resistance; then he was beyond it. Suddenly an icy chill 
touched his spine, as he felt a hand — distinctly nonhuman and possibly 
even with claws— take the ring from him. There was a long silence. He 
stared into the screen, but could see nothing beyond its surface. Finally, 
Maggie spoke. 

"That was a little harder than I thought. Here, take it." 

The ring was dropjjed into his hand. It was quite warm. He withdrew 
his hand and examined the ring. Nothing seemed to have changed about 
it, so, shrugging, he slipped it on his finger. 

"What was that all about?" 

Maggie's voice was secretive. "You'll figure it out when the time 
comes. Now, you'd better go. It's a long walk." 

Reluctantly, wondering what it was Maggie had been trying to get 
him to ask, and what she had done to the ring, and whose claw he had 
touched, Dave rose and finished packing. Finally he hefted his pack onto 
his shoulders. "Tiglath? Jenny? Want to come along?" he called. 

Tiglath skittered around the corner of the breakfast bar, Jenny fol- 
lowing more daintily. She spoke. "Sure. We both want to. We've been 
looking forward to showing you around." 

Dave was touched. He adjusted his pack, then walked to the door, 
wondering how much of what he carried would be useless, and how 
much would be priceless. The cats grabbed the remains of their fish and 
followed him, tails happily in the air. As they stepped out the door, Mag- 



gie called out something about a Bandersnatch. 
"What did she mean?" asked Dave. 

Tiglath, sighing, laid his fish down. "Nothing we can't handle, 
should the time come. Don't worry about it. Bandersnatches are easy to 
trick." 

At last they set off. They first walked further north, to what used to 
be a street that ran east- west. Dave noted with interest that there were 
fewer buildings than back home. When they reached the street, they 
found it to be a wide dusty trail, with a wooden bridge arching over the 
stream they were walking beside. On the other side of the trail was a 
small, noisy outdoor market where the Plum Orchard Shopping Center 
had been. Replacing Plum Orchard's two towers of black glass were two 
breathtakingly beautiful, fragile-seeming towers of an iridescent 
material. It looked as though someone had scooped up a handful of soap 
bubbles and piled them high. Dave stared at the towers a long time, then 
finally looked inquiringly at the cats, wondering how safe it was to walk 
out in the open. They just trotted onto the path and turned west. He 
followed, trusting their knowledge of this world but wishing he were 
less impatient to find the Inn. He longed to explore the market, especially 
after a marvelous scent composed of hundreds of different foods drifted 
over the trail. Some other time, he promised himself. 

They hadn't walked far when something low and fast-moving 
swooped past. It was gone before Dave had a chance to register more 
than the impression of something egg-shaped, about the size of a motor- 
cycle. "What was that?" he wondered aloud. 

The cats were shaking dust out of their fur. Jenny paused and re- 
sponded with distaste, "A Cargo. They have no respect." 

"What do they do?" Dave asked, suspecting the answer. 

"They carry things, and people, too, for a price." It was Tiglath. 
"But usually the price is too high." 

"How do you get one to stop?" 

"Stop? 'You might as well try to stop a Bandersnatch!' " Jenny 
laughed. "But you don't want to use a Cargo anyway. They're low." 
This seemed to end the topic as far as she was concerned. 

"But it's a long walk to— well, to whatever it's called here. And Bob 
said ..." Dave began to protest. 

Tiglath and Jenny looked at each other thoughtfully. "You're right, 
Dave. We usually take the short-cuts, but right now you're too solid. 
You're still a tyro, if you'll excuse me. I guess we'll have to find another 
way." Tiglath didn't seem too pleased with the idea. "But we don't have 
to use a Cargo. They're uncomfortable, and rude, and untrusty besides. 
Not that their cousins, the Bandersnatches, are any better. Just bigger. 
But I guess we have to choose one of the two. Nothing else is big 
enough." 

"Well, just how do you stop one?" Dave's curiosity was based on 
more than the problem at hand. How much had mild Charles Dodgson 
guessed? Had he gotten his information from this world, or had this 
world taken some of its names from him? Tiglath answered his unspoken 
thought. 

"A little of both. The interaction between worlds is sort of like a 
feedback system. You make a certain decision, and someone or 
something else is affected and responds. Which affects you in turn. And 
somewhere else, something is affected by what you didn 't do, as well." 
At Dave's look, Tiglath cut what looked to be a lengthy explanation 
short. "You'll learn. Everything's related." He began to make a sound 
suspiciously like humming. "Even us to you," he added casually. 

Dave opened his mouth, but didn't get a chance to speak. With a low 
buzzing roar, a huge version of the Cargo whammed by them— there was 
no better way to describe the sound. To complete the insult, it swerved 
ahead of them, making a tight turn, and came back to buzz them again. 
Dust was everywhere, and the cats were thoroughly disgusted. 

"Hey!" Tiglath called in annoyance. "Tired of living?" It was an 
idle threat, and the Bandersnatch knew it. 

"Where's your army?" It surveyed their small group slowly and con- 
temptuously, using a cluster of orange multifaceted eyes near its front 
end. Or at least Dave presumed it was a front end. "You cats seem to 
think you own the road, with your fancy friends and all. Slumming this 
time?" It was an unmistakable reference to Dave, who bristled. Since the 
cats, especially Jenny, were choosing to ignore the beast, Dave an- 
swered, using a hunch and what little he remembered of Lewis Carroll's 
work. 

"You Bandersnatches don't have much of a reputation yourselves."

He used the chilliest high-society voice he could muster. "Jabberwocks 
aren't exactly it, you know." It seemed to work. The glittering eyes 
turned red, and the Bandersnatch seemed to be searching for an appropri- 
ate retort. A voice in Dave's mind spoke with quiet approval. 

"They're touchy about that. Ever since the Incident, they haven't 
liked to hear the mention of that name. You couldn't have spoken bet- 
ter." It was Jenny. Dave, guessing that the Bandersnatch couldn't hear 
her, just nodded, pleased, and let the Bandersnatch rage speechlessly for 
a while. Then he went on pleasantly. 

"And you're known incompetents. Graceless. Ungainly. Unskilled. 
Can't even make a decent turn." At the Bandersnatch 's gargled protest, 
he continued, "You call that a turn? I've known elephants with a shorter 
turning radius! No, no," he said, shaking his head sadly, "you're simply 
hopeless. Haven't a chance. As I was saying to Evdna just the other 
day. ..." 

At that name, the Bandersnatch looked even sorrier. "Evdna?" All 
his bravado was gone. "You know him?" 

"Like a brother," Dave answered, refraining from mentioning that 
he had none. He inspected his fingernails, then dusted his pants leg. The 
Bandersnatch turned thoughtful, eyeing Dave out of a side set of multi- 
faceted clusters. After the silence had stretched, it made a slight cough, 
sort of like a motorcycle engine turning over. 

"Um . . . Sir?" 

Dave looked bored. 

"Sir?" 

Finally Dave deigned to answer. "Yes?" 

"Evdna's been kind of down on us Bandersnatches lately. We've 
been looking for ways to get on his good side— er, that is, to make up for 
what we did. Is there anything I can do for you? Kill a Jaroka? End the 
life of some small Kher that might have put you out?" 

Dave spoke to the cats. "Come on. He's wasting our time." The cats 
seemed all too happy with this, and started to trot off. 

"Wait, Sir! Wait! Perhaps you'd like transport somewhere? The dou- 
ble blue moons of Serighai? Anywhere?"

Dave halted, intrigued, but kept his voice casual. "Well, we could 
always use the short-cuts. But maybe this once we could let you carry us, 
just to help you out. If you do a good job, we'll put in a good word with 
Evdna. Are you willing to take us to the Inn?" He said this last careless- 
ly, as though it really didn't matter where they went, and the Inn was just 
the first place to pop into his mind. The Bandersnatch 's response was 
gratifying. 

"That's all? It's nothing! I'll get you there in no time! Hop in!" And 
his side swung out, revealing a soft yellow interior. Seats formed as 
Dave gawked. Gingerly, he stepped in, the cats following. Tiglath's fur 
was slightly roughed, and he growled quietly that he didn't like this. 

Once in, they sat on the seats, which felt like old-fashioned over- 
stuffed couches. The Bandersnatch 's voice, sounding muffled, asked 
cheerfully if everything was okay, then added, as handles appeared, 
"Hold on tight!" They took off with a bump and a swoop. The cats dug 
their claws into the yellow stuff, howling their protest. But Dave was ex- 
hilarated. It was like riding in a helicopter. After a while, the cats re- 
laxed as the ride smoothed. They all sat in silence awhile, then Dave 
began to speak, asking the cats questions. 

"Where are the blue moons of Serighai?" 

The cats looked at him in alarm, and there was a sudden, ominous, 
listening silence. Dave realized he might have made a mistake, and tried 
to cover. "I mean, I've heard of them, of course. I just have never been 
there." The cats looked at him in anguish as the Bandersnatch made a 
sound like a wounded walrus. They juddered to a halt, and the inte- 
rior heaved, becoming hard as rock, as a door opened in the Bander- 
snatch's side. 

"Out! Out!" The Bandersnatch cried. "Imposter! The blue moons 
are Evdna's summer resort!" Too late. Dave realized the magnitude of 
his mistake. Anyone who knew Evdna "like a brother" would have 
known that fact. "Out! And may you perish slowly!" They were ejected 
onto a needled forest floor. The Bandersnatch hovered above them, 
shouting insults and threats, before roaring off huffily. 

Dave and the cats picked themselves up, looking around curiously. It 
was a quiet redwood forest. Nothing seemed out of place, though it was 
growing dark. Dave spoke, breaking the silence. 

"What did he mean, we wouldn't live long? Is there some danger 
here?" As he spoke, a slight breeze moved through the branches of the 
trees. The cats, who had been alertly sniffing the air, shuddered. Jenny 
spoke. 

"Dragon . . ." she said slowly. "Big one, and not too far away." 
She focused her brown-gold eyes on Dave's deep green ones. "We're in 
trouble, Dave. It's awake." Dave didn't ask her how she knew. He sud- 
denly realized how much he had been depending on the cats to guide and 
protect him through this world. To have them worried meant big trouble. 

"What do we do?" he asked helplessly. "Run?" 

"No!" Tiglath said sharply. "That would only attract attention to us. 
We walk, slowly and carefully, away, and hope it doesn't notice us. 
Although," he added hof)elessly, "dragons have very sharp hearing." 

"There is another way." Jenny sounded unhappy. 

"What's that?" 

"We could go back home. But. ..." 
"But what, Jenny?" 

"But this may be part of your first level objective, and if you quit 
rather than figure a way out, you may set yourself back or even"— here 
Jenny sounded particularly woeful— "be disqualified forever. Oh, not 
forever, but for a long time, and we may be gone, and not have a chance 
to share this great adventure of exploring worlds with you. So think care- 
fully. We can't help you with this." 

Dave looked at Tiglath, who nodded in confirmation. "Well, let's 
start walking, at least. Maybe something will come up." After sniffing 
the air again, the cats started walking south, while Dave began thinking 
furiously. He could smell the sweet cinnamon and nutmeg of the dragon 
now, which must mean it was awfully close. How was he expected to 
figure a way out of this without weapons? He made a mental inventory of 
the potentially useful items in his pack. He had a rope— maybe he could 
tie the dragon up somehow? He dismissed this idea as ridiculous. What 
else? Clothing— nothing useful there. Matches? Laughable. His camp 
knife? Far too short, and he guessed grimly that dragons in this world 
were probably at least as well armored as those in the fantasy games of 
his world. Which left his mind. All right, Dave told himself, use it. There 
was a faint scraping sound, all too much like that of a heavy, scaled body 



RICH AND 

FAM OUS ? 

THIS CANT SOFT 

BEABOUT DISK 




When you haven't got a lot of money and when few people know who you are, 
there's only one way to hobnob with the elite— name your product Rich and Famous. 

That's what the Softdisk people did when they were casting about for a name for 
their disk sampler, and it's at least as descriptive a name as Mitsubishi. After all, their 
sampler is rich in diversions for the Apple owner; and, if the programs on it aren't 
famous . . . well, at least they aren't infamous either. 

Softdisk in its regular monthly format is likewise rich in material. 

You get listable, modifiable programs. There's no better way to learn programming 
than to study someone else's programming techniques. 

You also get interactive demos of some of the latest commercial software— allowing 
you to make buying decisions leisurely in front of your computer. 

And you have access to the subscriber bulletin board, where you can develop pen 
pals with similar interests or get answers to your computer problems. In addition, 
there's music and novelties. 

In fact, the real Softdisk is so packed with goodies that it takes both sides of two 
disks. So what's all the fuss about a single disk Ricti and Famous sampler? It only 
costs $3. That's a pretty inexpensive way to explore the Softdisk concept in electronic 
journalism. 

Now you can choose from among three ways to try Softdisk: There's the regular 
subscription of $55 for one year, and you get the Ricti and Famous sampler thrown in 
free (until January 1, 1984); you can get a single issue for $10; or you can go for the 
$3 sampler.

brushing against the rough bark of redwoods. Dave had the feeling that 
time was running out quickly. His finger itched, and he absently 
scratched it, only to be pricked as though by a needle. 

"Ow!" He swore softly, looking at his ring. He hadn't noticed any 
sharp edges when he bought it. But his eyes met the alert eyes of his 
friendly dragon. It opened its mouth, revealing tiny perfect teeth, and 
hissed so faintly he almost couldn't hear it. Despite their situation, he 
stared, amazed and delighted. Its minuscule claws held tightly to his 
finger, and the tail was uncoiling to lash fiercely as it held its small 
wings aloft. Finally Dave thought the unthinkable: This tiny dragon must 
be a way to escape the larger one. But how? He spoke to it in a whisper. 

"Friendly dragon? Can you help us?" 

It nodded proudly. 

"How?" 

His doubt must have shown; the dragon looked offended. 

"Size isn't everything in any world." Jenny commented. 

"Forgive me." Dave addressed himself to the dragon again. "I ac- 
cept your aid with thanksgiving." A sudden suspicion seized him. 
"Maggie?" 

The dragon lashed her tail, pleased. He had guessed right. Somehow, 
the ring was an extension of his computer. 
"What do we do?" 

The small dragon launched itself into the air. It darted off a short 
way, then returned, only to dart off again. Dave thought, despite 
himself, of Lassie films, and got the point. All three set out after the 
dragon. The forest was nearly dark, and Dave wondered how they could 
follow a dragon they couldn't see. He needn't have worried. The small 
dragon began to glow gently, becoming brighter as the light failed com- 
pletely. It was bright enough to light their path, though incompletely, 
which was more than adequate for the cats. But Dave stumbled occa- 
sionally, muffling oaths and fearing the hot breath of the larger dragon at 
any moment. It seemed to have scented them (or heard his clumsy 
stumbles, Dave thought sourly), for the scraping sounds were faster and 
louder. Occasionally there was a crash as a younger redwood resisted the 
dragon's impatience and lost. They crossed a small rocky creek out into 
a clearing, and Dave heard in despair a sound almost at his back. He 



stopped and turned to face the night. The cats hovered fearfully on the 
edges of sight, and the small dragon returned. It flew worriedly further 
back along their trail, then made a small chirruping sound in the dark, 
where a dark shadow bulked. It flew excitedly back to Dave, stroked 
against his cheek— like a cat, Dave thought to himself— then flew back 
into the dark. Dave looked questioningly at the cats. Their fur smoothed, 
and they came to sit by him, licking themselves unconcernedly. There 
was a long silence. Gradually, Dave became aware of a faint fresh breeze 
chilling his cheeks, and of the small sounds of the forest— crickets chirp- 
ing, a small brook murmuring quietly to itself, the soft sough of wind in 
the upper branches of the trees. Ahead, through the trees, was the faint 
glow of the Ring Dragon, waxing and waning, revealing glimpses of a 
glittering scaled hide and large gleaming eyes that shifted from the dark 
forest to Dave and the cats, then back again. Wonder and awe took 
Dave's heart. 

Finally the small dragon zipped back to Dave and indicated that he 
was to follow it back to the large dragon. Dave, reluctant, shook his 
head. The Ring Dragon hovered a moment, then tugged insistently at his 
jacket. Dave yielded and walked fearfully back. He trusted the small 
dragon, but he wasn't so sure about the larger one. As he approached, he 
got a full view of the larger dragon, and he caught his breath. It was 
tremendous, but more than that it was stunningly beautiful. Small puffs 
of steam came out of its nostrils, and the heat of its body was making 
more steam rise from the damp ground, wreathing the dragon in an eerie 
mist that coiled caressingly about the dragon's form before gradually 
vanishing as it rose higher. Dave had an overpowering urge to stroke 
those sleek scales. Then his eyes met the flaming ruby of the eyes of the 
dragon, and he was lost to anything else. A voice sounded in his mind, 
speaking with a hint of amusement. 

Soooo. Younger Sister tells me you have taken her into hearth arul 
home as Special Companion, and thus I am forbidden you as meat. Pity. 
You look tasty. If she weren 't kin, I might be tempted to ignore the Edict. 
It's been a while since I've tasted of Man. Your race grows wiser arul 
more wily as it approaches its Coming of Age. You play new games, to 
better purposes, it seems. There was the faint impression of a huge gusty 
sigh. Ah well. Go in peace. Your journey's almost eruled — arul begun.

The good freres Bob and Doug McKenzie aren't any funnier than have been Softalk's 
attempts to find a way to send free trial subscriptions into Canada. After stops and starts, 
valiant attempts, and pitiable efforts to find an inexpensive way to make Canadians the 
same offer we make U.S. subscribers, we've finally faced the inevitable. There is no 
inexpensive way. 

Armed with that knowledge, we're following a hallowed Softalk tradition and ignoring it. 
Therefore: 

Effective with the January issue 

Softalk will finally do what it should have done months ago . . . make free trial subscriptions 
available to Canadian Apple owners. Jot your Apple serial number down and send it, along 
with your name and mailing address, to:

NOVEMBER 1983 



She waited patiently for Dave to step back. He didn't. 

Is there something more? There was a tinge of impatience to the 
dragon's mind-voice this time. 

Greatly daring, Dave ventured to think back, I'd like to touch you. 
The dragon's eyes opened wider. 

Indeed! She sounded offended, then softened. You are flattering. 
Youngling. You may approach. Not many can say they have touched me 
and lived. She shifted, advancing a massive shoulder. Dave stepped 
nearer, tentatively, and stretched his hand out. The dragon was warm, 
but not unbearably so. The scales were more flexible than they seemed 
from a distance, and had a soft golden sheen to them. He stroked across 
several, feeling the play of hard muscles underneath as she shifted her 
leg. Dave gazed up at her amused eyes, and thought. Marvelous. You 're 
so beautifiil. I will always treasure this experience. Thank you. His 
gratitude was genuine, though compounded with relief at escaping death. 

The dragon was pleased and touched. Youngling. She curved her 
neck, bending her homed nose around to her shoulder, and scratched. A 
scale, large as Dave's spread-out hand, came loose. She tugged at it with 
her teeth, then held it out to Dave. No one has thanked me for long and 
long. Not, she added wryly, that I often give them reason or chance. But 
nonetheless. . . . She dropped the scale into his hand, then cut off his 
thanks with a wave of a claw. Don 't thank me yet. Small One. Just use it 
wisely. It can be as dangerous as I myself. There was more amusement in 
her mind-voice. Now farewell. And back off. The Ring Dragon tugged at 
Dave, who was stilled by awe. At last he shook free of his wonder, think- 
ing more clearly again, and backed away as the dragon moved into the 
clearing. He stumbled over a burl, and this brought him the rest of the 
way to reality. 

A long way back came the last thought of the great dragon. He and the 
cats and the Ring Dragon obeyed. The large dragon unfurled her mag- 
nificent wings, then with a loud snap leaped into the air. It was as though 
she caught fire in the act, for her body suddenly blazed with a golden 
light. The scale in Dave's hand gave an answering flare and grew hot a 
moment, then cooled and darkened again. Dave watched the dragon burn 
brightly above the trees as she climbed higher. Finally she straightened 
and flew out toward the ocean. The trees blocked his view after a while, 
and he sighed, lost in beauty. 

"Well. You have been honored beyond anything you might have ex- 
pected." This was Jenny. 

"Have I? I guess I have. But what do I do with this?" Dave held up 
the scale. 

"There are many things you can do with it," Tiglath started to say, 
interrupting himself with a wide, teeth-clicking yawn. "But I'm beat, 
and we still have a couple hours to go before we reach the Inn. Do you 
want to sack out, and finish in the morning? Or continue now, and sleep 
in a warm bed tonight?" 

"The warm bed sounds good, but I'm beat, too. Jenny?" 

"Whatever you two want." 

It was settled, then. They set up camp— really just Dave's down 
sleeping bag, into which he slipped, while the cats curled on top. The 
Ring Dragon curled around Dave's finger and coiled into immobility, 
but there was an awareness to its eyes that reassured Dave. As Jenny 
snuggled near Dave's chest, she murmured sleepily, "Mmmmm. I've 
always loved this thing. And I never puncture it, like you've accused me 
of doing." Abruptly, she was asleep. Though tired, Dave lay awake a 
long while, excited and a little afraid. At last he too slipped into sleep, 
waking now and then to the sensation of a soft bed, but too tired to won- 
der about it. In the morning they were in the forest still, and Dave de- 
cided the night's wakings must have been dreams. The cats were cheer- 
ful, both having had good hunting. When they were through with their 
horrendous crackings and che wings, which Dave politely ignored as he 
fixed oatmeal, they cleaned camp and left. 

It was a beautiful morning for hiking, and the greater part was down 
gently sloping hills that skirted the teal-blue ocean. The faint sound of 
waves ceaselessly pulling over sand joined with the calls of birds— many 
new to Dave— and the occasional far whoosh of a Cargo or a Bander- 
snatch, running along the wide trail that edged the sea cliffs. Once, as 
they crossed a small creek that ate rapidly downward through the bluffs to 
the sea, allowing them a glimpse of a small beach, Dave could have 
sworn he saw a walrus walking upright, daintily shucking oysters, deep 
in conversation with a man wearing overalls, but he decided to let that 
pass. He had an Inn to find. 



At long last they came to the low hill above what would have been 
Santa Ilusivo back home. It was also a city here, but very changed. Dave 
stood and stared a long time, amused, realizing that, like Bob, the in- 
habitants must have done some rearranging to get things to their taste. 
There was a haphazardness to it, though, as if not everyone quite knew 
what he or she was doing, or why, or had thought out its consequences. 
The Cooper House was the most coherent— maybe because it had been 
there longer, dating, at home, from the age when a man's house was his 
castle— and Dave fixed on its mrrets and battlements as he and the cats 
hurried down to it. As they came into town, they walked among tents and 
geodesic domes, dwellings with outhouses for plumbing side by side 
with dwellings that looked totally self-contained. The streets were full of 
people trading, gossiping, happily arguing over the relative merits of 
places Dave had never heard of, or just walking about thoughtfully. No 
two people were dressed alike, either. The last stronghold of the in- 
dividualist, Dave thought to himself, but he wondered. Some of the re- 
arrangements seemed misguided. As they came closer to the castle, the 
character of the town changed, becoming more consistently medieval. 

The Happy Dragon fit the area well. As Dave had suspected from the 
start, in this world it was the Inn— a large, brawling, table-pounding 
place filled with adventurers. No one seemed to notice when he and the 
cats slipped in, but after they sat down, a tall figure in scarlet robes 
thunked down two tankards and four sausages. The cats seized one 
sausage each and retired under the table, growling with delight. It was 
Evdna. 

"So, you made it. And," he looked at a small sundial strapped to his 
wrist, "in record time." 

Dave stopped chewing sausage long enough to look at the sundial. 
Evdna laughed and waved his wrist. The sundial vanished. "Just a 
joke," he added. "Any questions?" 

Dave took a long, cool pull of ale. "Yes, about a million. But for 
starters: What's this all about? Does this have anything to do with the 
Society the redhead mentioned last time I was here?" 

Evdna gave him a considering look. "You're a sharp one. I think you 
have a good chance to finish the Great Quest— very few have gone that 
far in one life." He leaned forward slightly. "Yes. The Society is made 
of a group of people who explore other worlds, mostly for fun, though 
sometimes with more serious missions." At Dave's look, he continued, 
"I gather you want to join the Society. You have just completed the first 
trial— getting here. There is one more task you must accomplish. You 
may have noticed that near your home in this world is a market over- 
looked by two towers of glass. Within each of those towers lives a witch. 
One of them, I don't know which, has my daughter, who went there for 
lessons but hasn't come back. A few others have tried to retrieve her for 
me, but failed. Even my magic is useless against the defenses of the two 
towers. I ask you to bring her back to me." He paused, grim lines 
around his mouth. "There is a catch, of course: You must do it on your 
own, and you'll need to learn how to use the short-cuts. Which are 
tricky. And, most important, while doing all this, you must not allow 
yourself to be corrupted by the powers you will find developing in 
yourself. Wait," he held a hand up to halt Dave's protest. "I know. This 
sounds like a particularly difficult task to accomplish. But I have faith in 
you. You have already shown extraordinary promise. I warn you, 
though, that the nature of altering your focus involves an alteration of 
your control, and sometimes you will forget who you are and what you 
are, unless you exert a great deal of effort. If, during such a time, you 
choose to league, shall we say, with the Others, who will be only too 
glad for such a recruit, we will, regretfully but firmly, oppwse you. Once 
you have safely negotiated this task, you will be welcomed into the 
Society and given license to roam- with, if you like, quests to accom- 
plish. What do you say?" 

Dave thought of the questions he had concerning Maggie, and what 
she might be and know in this world; of two mysteriously beautiful glass 
towers and what might await him there; of the awe and sense of magic 
talking to the Great Dragon had instilled in him. And finally, of what 
tedium waited for him back home. "Yes," he answered simply, "I'll do 
it." Faint cheers came from underneath the table, and Evdna smiled in 
anticipation. This one would truly do it, he thought to himself. Dave 
would bring Elaine back. After that — who knows? Surely then the Great 
Quest would be as nothing. And he was content. 31

Softalk Presents Hie Bestsellers 



Wizardry and Ultima are the McDonald's and Burger King of soft- 
ware. They aren't just series of programs, they're franchises. They 
aren't just listings of code, they're licenses to make money. 

The third in each series has been recently released, and the publishers 
are laughing all the way to the bank. Legacy ofLlylgamyn, follow-up to 
Wizardry and Knight of Diamonds, may have set an Apple record for the 
most sales in a two-week time span. Exodus:Ultima III is likewise flying 
off the shelves. September was a most auspicious month for fantasy 
gamers. 

Legacy didn't hit the market until the middle of September, but it's 
been the dominant entertainment program since its release. Even though 
it had only a two-week sales window. Legacy was so hot that it jumped to 
second place on the Top Thirty, one of the best showings by a new prod- 
uct ever. 

Only Apple Galaxian from Broderbund and Space Eggs from Sirius 
have done better, each coming from nowhere to be the top seller in its 
first month of release. And only two programs have duplicated Legacy's 
second-place feat in their first month of existence. One was Zaxxon just 
a few months ago; the other was Knight of Diamonds. 

WhUe Legacy was fulfilling its destiny. Ultima III was providing a 
different kind of success story for Origin Systems. No publisher has ever 
cracked the top ten Apple sellers in its first full month of distribution of 
its first product until Origin Systems. 

Of course. Origin Systems had a head start, in that it was bringing out 
the third in a series of popular fantasy games, rather than actually 
starting from scratch. But that doesn't dim some of the luster of the 
achievement. Now the question is whether Origin can maintain that pace 
with new offerings. 

One of the interesting facets of the success of Legacy and Exodus is 
that they were the two highest-priced new entertainment offerings during 
the month. Their success indicates that quality, not price, is still the 
determining factor in the buying decisions of a majority of Apple 
owners. 

But there was an interesting counterpoint to that theory in September 
as weU. Penguin Software had two entertaiiraient programs jump into the 
specialty lists. The Quest scored fifth on the Adventure 5 and Minit Man 
landed in the middle of the Arcade 10. Penguin has taken its pricing 
structure the other way, lowering the price of its entertainment software 
to $19.95. 

So it was in the penthouse and the bargain basement that success 
could be found in September. 

Actually, most sales turned up toward the end of the month. But the 
one-time foundation of the Apple entertainment market — the arcade

game — is diminishing in influence with each passing month, There are 
various reasons put forth by the experts on why that might be, ranging 
from quality considerations to lack of new concepts. But there's no argu- 
ment about the effect. A year ago, Choplifter dropped from first place in 
the Top Thirty to second, beginning a long, slow decline. Today, it's but 
a shadow of its former sales profile, but that shadow was strong enough 
to move from fourth to third among arcade games. 

It's clear that the right mix of quality, innovativeness, and pricing is 
not being discovered by the arcade-game publishers. Perhaps the chang- 
ing demographics of the Apple market will forever preclude the huge

You will soon come to expect the unexpected 
in the hilarious and challenging underground 
dream world of Drol. A little red-headed girl and 
her propeller-beanied brother have been lured by 
a witch doctor's curse into the multi-leveled ruins of 
a lost civilization. It's your task — as a hero equipped 
with a rocket backpack and full-screen radar scope — 
to dodge hopping scorpions, monsters and snakes, fly- 
ing turkeys, swords, daggers, arrows, magnets, witch 
doctors, and vacuum cleaners(!) in your attempts to rescue the children 
and reunite them with their mother. Each new level of game play is 
full of surprises. 

Drol's wry sense of humor and amazingly detailed cartoon im- 
agery, make this game a charmer!

your irritating supervisor (who is eager to undo your best efforts), you may feel 
that you have bitten off more than you can chew.

successes of the past, but the successes of Lode Runner, Zaxxon, Miner 
2049er, and Choplifter seem to indicate differently. 

Nowhere are those changing demographics more apparent than in the 
area of word processing. Apple Writer He still is the dominant program 
in the Apple market, but the competition is stiffening. Whereas Apple 
Writer lie seemed to be the outstanding word processing program after 
the introduction of the Apple He, now it is not so perceived. 

Other word processors are attracting attention from the boatload of 
new Apple owners. Numerically, the change charts this way: Two 
months ago, Apple Writer lie had more than double the sales of all other 
word processors combined. That translates to better than a 67 percent 
market share. Today, its market share is under 50 percent and dropping. 

What seems to be the case is not so much that the sales of Apple 
Writer He are dropping off as that a lot more word processing is being 
done on Apples and the people doing that word processing are being a lot 
more discriminating about what programs they choose to use. There's 
always been a wide variety of software from which to choose; the fact 
that the choices are now more widely dispersed implies a more 
knowledgeable and serious approach to the subject on the part of new 
Apple owners. The days of the impulse buy seem to have passed. 

There was lots of movement within the Word Processing 10 during 
September. Sensible Speller continues as the dominant proofreading 
package and moved into third behind Apple Writer He and Bank Street 
Writer. Magic Window II made a big jump to fourth. WordStar dropped 
to fifth. 

As if on cue, Word Handler moved to sixth. Last year at this time,

NOVEMBER 1983 



Word Handler started a strong surge that carried it into the Top Thirty 
before the introduction of the Apple He cooled it off. It looks like the 
program's bidding to repeat its holiday success this year. 

Word Juggler lie, already prepared to handle ProDOS if or when 
Apple decides to bless us with it, made a strong push into seventh. 
PFS.Write, almost ignored in the Apple market because of its strong suc- 
cess in the IBM pc market, got eighth. And Screen Writer II and Super- 
Text Professional each experienced sales surges. 

Even though Word Juggler He has a long way to go to catch Apple 
Writer He, the two programs compete much more evenly in the Apple III 
market. In September, it was Word Juggler besting Apple Writer HI as 
the two programs finished second and third respectively. VisiCalc: 
Advanced Version was the bestselling Apple HI program. 

Quark, publisher of Word Juggler, had quite a month in the Apple III 
market. In addition to Word Juggler, Lexicheck nailed fourth and The 
Catalyst grabbed sixth. 

Every area of entertairmient software saw new entries. 

Minit Man from Penguin tallied fifth among the arcade games and 
Stellar 7 from Software Entertainment Company ended up, appropriately 
enough, in seventh. 

Infocom reasserted its dominance in the adventure category, placing 
four of the top five programs. Planetfall was its new entry that cap- 
tured fourth position behind the Zork trilogy. But, as had been the case 
all year, there was one hi-res adventure to prevent Infocom from making 
a clean sweep of the category. This time it was Penguin's The Quest, 
which came in fifth. 

The biggest boost in sales, other than in the fantasy category, came in 
strategy games. Castle Wolfenstein not only regained the lead in the 
category, but also regained the Top Thirty. Strategic Simulations 
grabbed the next two places with Broadsides and Eagles, its latest en- 
tries. Diehards Flight Simulator and Sargon II rounded out the list.

Understanding the Apple II 

by Jim Sather 



Quality Software is pleased to present the definitive source of in- 
formation about how the Apple works Jim Sather has conducted 
an exhaustive analysis of the inner workings of the Apple II com- 
puter. Now he has documented his findings in a way that will bene- 
fit everyone interested in microcomputer technology. You will be 
amazed at the amount of valuable material packed into the 320 
pages of Understanding the Apple II. 




Understanding the Apple II — 

• Documents all motherboard circuits, including some 
discussed nowhere else. 

• Describes disk controller operation, including previous- 
ly undocumented details of the logic state sequencer. 

• Explains RAM and ROM card operation.

Softalk Presents Hie Bestsellers 



the product list of education products actually selling in any significant 
volume is now longer than any other category. 

In keeping with the emphasis on word processing programs, three 
typing aids, led by MasterType, sold well. Apple Logo continues to 
outsell its competitors by a wide majority. The biggest jump in sales was 
for Rocky 's Boots, one of the most user-challenging programs on the list. 
It jumped to fifth. 

In the home market, Dollars and Sense is starting to make an impact. 
It's not nearly ready to challenge Home Accountant, but it did jump into 
a tie for fifth position. That means that the two bestselling home account- 
ing packages have their genesis in the laid-back land of southern Califor- 
nia. Whether that implies that most Apple owners' checkbooks will soon 
be out of balance or whether the land of sun and fun has an unearned 
reputation for frivolity probably depends on your perspective. 

It was pretty much business as usual for the Business 10. There was a 
little shuffling of positions, but the only newcomer to the list was really 

Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 4.78 percent of all sales of Ap- 
ple and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in October to ascertain their sales for the month of 
September, 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was the number of units sold— such other 
criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer store, and personal preferences of 
the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in October represented every geographical area of the continental United 
States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index number 
to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is an arbitrary 
measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are correlative only to the 
month in which they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index rating of 50 in one 
month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in another month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus or minus 3.78 percent, which translates roughly into 
the theoretical possibility of a change of 4. 1 1 points, plus or minus, in any index number.

a former resident returning — The Incredible Jack. 

It was definitely business as usual in the Hobby 10, for which there's 
growing grassroots support for renaming it the Beagle Bros catalog. 
Seven of the ten entries again stemmed from the Beagle factory in San 
Diego. The shocker was that none of them was in first place. Bag of 
Tricks managed to nab the lead position and Zoom Grafix tied for second. 
Other than Apple Pascal, everything else went to the dogs.
