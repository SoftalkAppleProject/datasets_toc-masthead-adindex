Picture this. Presentation-quality bar charts, line 
graphs, and pie charts. In black and white or color. On hard 
copy or a CRT. In seconds. 

That's PFS: GRAPH. The fastest, easiest, most econom- 
ical computer graphics software package you can buy. 

For the first time ever, computer graphics 
without computer programming. 

With GRAPH, all you do is enter your information and 
specify the kind of chart or graph you want GRAPH does 
the rest So instead of making a lot of complicated calcula- 
tions, you can make graphics. 

GRAPH is so straightforward, you can begin 
creating graphs and charts almost immediately. 
But it also has powerful capability you can stay 
with for years to come. 

For example, you can mix and match line and 
bar graphs, stack or compare up to four bar graphs 
simultaneously, even display as many as four 
graphs on the same set of axes. 

Software that pays for the system. 

Compared to hand-drawn graphics, GRAPI^^^ 
can save you enough money on your first set of^ 
overlays to pay for itself. And over the course of a 




few months, it could save you enough to pay for the 
Apple® computer system it works on. And that includes a 
Hewlett-Packard 7470A color plotter 

It even works with VisiCalc® files. 

GRAPH is so flexible it allows you to work with raw 
data, other members of the PFS Series, or even VisiCalc files. 

No other computer graphics package gives you all this 
capability. Combine it with the beautiful simplicity of PFS 
for information management, and PFS: REPORT for infor- 
mation analysis, and you have a software family that works 
hard without being hard to work. 

So if you're thinking about making it in pic- 
tures, go see PFS: GRAPH. It's at your computer 
dealer now. And if they don't have it, ask them to 
contact Software Publishing Corporation, 1901 
Landings Drive, Mountain View, CA 94043.

No, the cover of this issue has absolutely 
nothing to do with Softalk employees. Well, 
okay, maybe a little. You see, we were plan- 
ning to have the First Annual Softalk Thanks- 
giving Banquet right before the Applefest in San 
Francisco at the end of this month. The guest 
list included everyone who works at Softalk, 
our columnists, and a few derelicts who hang 
out at the hamburger joint across the street. 

If you know us like we know us, you know 
that we just love to eat. So, we went out to the 
local North Hollywood turkey farm and traded 
them some magazines and BasiCalc disks for a 
whole bunch of turkeys — enough for everyone 
to have at least two. An even trade, wouldn't 
you say? Then, Softalk' s construction depart- 
ment got right to work and built a turkey pen to 
hold the little gobblers until we were ready 
to eat. 

For your viewing pleasure, here they are, all 
one hundred and. . . , Hey, wait a minute. Some 
of them have escaped! Most of them have es- 
caped! Word has it that our trustworthy, yet 
hungry, writers saw some of them strutting 
around and began to hoard them, stashing most 
of them away in their columns. Boy, as if an in- 
vitation to this epicurean extravaganza wasn't 
enough! 

If we can't recover the birds, we're all going 
to go hungry. 

So, we're calling on you to give us some as- 
sistance. Help us round up the turkeys that got 
away, and you'll be handsomely rewarded. All 
you have to do is peruse the magazine and cap- 
ture any stray turkeys you see aimlessly tiptoe- 
ing through the typefaces. Once you think 
you've caught them all, count them up and sub- 
mit your tally to us. 

Whoever catches all the turkeys will be eli- 
gible to win $100 in goods made by Softalk ad- 
vertisers. 



Here are the rules: 

1 . Any photographs of turkeys don't count. 
We're just looking for escaped hi-res roasters 
like the ones on this page. 

2. Then, to make sure you have the right to- 
tal, add the number of turkeys you captured to 
the number of turkeys on this page. We're look- 
ing for the total number of turkeys before the 
massive breakout. 

3. In the case of more than one correct en- 
try, the names of those who tie will go into the 
Random Sandwich Generator. Whoever is able 
to make the most turkey sandwiches from left- 
overs will be the winner. The RSG will oversee 
this part of the contest in all its awful majesty, 
cruel and magnificent. 

That's all there is to it. So, get going and 
have a ball!

CONTINENTAL'S 
HOME ACCOUNTANT IS NUMBERONE- 

AND CLIMBING 



For the past several months, Softalk magazine has 
rated Continental Software's Home Accountant™ 
No. 1 in its "Home 10" best-seller list. 

A lot of programs would have "peaked" by 
now. But with over 10,000 copies in use. Home 
Accountant just keeps getting stronger. 

There's a reason for this spectacular suc- 
cess—and it's not just the low suggested price 
of $74.95. 

The fact is. Home Accountant is one of those 
rare programs that virtually everybody can profit 
from using. It's powerful enough to handle even 
the most complicated family budget — yet it's so 



easy to use that one quick trip through the manual 
may be all you'll ever need. 

With Home Accountant you can track up to 
100 budget categories, 5 different checking ac- 
counts, and all the credit cards you can carry. Just 
press a few keys and watch the program print your 
checks, net worth and other financial statements. 
And when you see the full-color graphs of actual vs. 
budgeted expenses, trend line analyses, etc., you'll 
know you bought the best. 

See your Apple dealer soon for a demonstra- 
tion. And start watching your fortunes climb with

NOVEMBER 1982 



Mesi Winners 



An Ounce of English Gold. Eureka! That's 
what the old-timers yelled when they discov- 
ered gold in California more than one hundred 
thirty years ago. It's also what Jack English of 
Piscataway, New Jersey, will be thinking all the 
way to his computer store to pick up his prize 
for having won Part 4 of the Oracle '82 contest, 
predirting the closing price of gold on the New 
York market on September 7, the day after La- 
bor Day. 

And this was no small task; remember that 
all contestants were making their predictions 
more than eight months before the day. Predic- 
tions ranged from $159.46 to $1,372.63. Inves- 
tors from Beverly Hills were clawing at Sof- 
talk's door to get the names of those whose pre- 
dictions came close. However, swinging joy- 



dentally, both Tobias and Lewis were a dollar 
under the closing price, while winner English 
was a dollar above. Perhaps the Random Num- 
ber Generator knows . . . nawww. 

Close, but No Cigar. Near-misses were 
Dale Culler (Ames, lA) with $483, Chris Grant 
(La Mesa, CA), who bought at $485, Rick 
Jones (Spokane, WA), who sold at $486, and 
Gary Geniesse (Osprey, PL), who tied with 
Kevin Park (Bloomington, MN) with predic- 
tions of $475. As usual, runners-up win a set of 
personalized So/talk InvisiTabs; Tobias and 
Lewis win a gold-plated set. 

In the race for the grand prize of a new disk 
drive, field positions are always shifting. Charles 
Lewis (told you so) is still holding a command- 
ing lead over everyone with an amazing score of 

BASIC 




That's Carl "AoDle Trivia" Webb receiving his Disl< II drive from Marty Potashnick of Computerland 
of Carlsbad, California. Carl later bought an Apple II Plus to go with his new drive. 



sticks and hurling disk drives at them seemed to 
keep them at bay. 

English's prediction of $482 was just a slim 
dollar above the actual closing price of $481. 
Only two others came that close, so English 
dragged them into the Random Number Gen- 
erator with him. What happened inside would 
have made The Texas Chainsaw Massacre look 
like Mister Roger's Neighborhood and is un- 
printable here. Anyway, English emerged un- 
scathed and was last seen clearing way for some 
TG paddles and a Select-a-Port from TG 
paddles and a Select-a-Port from TG Products. 

The dust finally cleared, and one of the vic- 
tims of the wrath of English (and the RNG) 
turned out to be Charles S. Lewis of Rich- 
mond, Virginia. So/talk contest fans will recog- 
nize Lewis immediately — he's the winner of 
June's Apples in History contest and the hus- 
band of Oracle '82 Part 1 winner Elizabeth 
Lewis (don't go away; C. Lewis will appear 
again in a few paragraphs). 

The other RNG casualty was Daniel To- 
bias from Poughkeepsie, New York. Coinci- 



—7.6 points. Hot on his tail are Tobias at — 14.4 
points, English with —20.7 points, and Jones, 
hanging on with -21.9 points. 

Part 4 of the Oracle really spread the field 
out; the last place entry currently has -909.73 
points. People who were neck and neck after 
Part 2 are now scattered throughout. But this is 
the Softalk Oracle contest, and anything can 
happen. 

Picking Kumquats. This is absolutely the 
last time we ever run one of these creativity con- 
tests — at least until next year. These things are 
so hard to judge, and the contest staff can nev- 
er agree on a winner. Here's how it worked this 
time: 

The contest meister read all entries and se- 
lected the best twenty or so, based on originali- 
ty, cleverness, entertainment value, and general 
niceness (neatness should have been a criterion, 
but if it were, lots of entries would have been 
disqualified. When we said double-spaced, we 
meant it). 

Next, the entire staff selected their favorite 
five finalists in order of preference. Six points 



were given for each first place vote, four points 
for second, three points for third, and so on. 
Simple, right? Wrong. Even with such a point 
scheme, we still had tied scores. And we all 
know how contest ties are broken around 
here — the all-powerful Random Number Gen- 
erator. When we approached the RNG, it told 
us it would have none of that. RNG said that 
breaking ties in creativity contests was not in its 
job descripfion, and that it wanted a bonus and 
two months' extra vacation time for deciding 
the winner in this one. 

Upon hearing this, the contest meister set 
the RNG on fire and began gouging it with 
pointed sticks. One hour and two citations from 
the North Hollywood Fire Department later, 
the contest staff gathered in the Softalk Kum- 
quatorium where each member presented rea- 
sons why his favorite entry should win. Every- 
one was limited to ten minutes at the podium. 
At the end, whoever had the fewest tomatoes 
and overripe fruits thrown at him won. 

Winner. Congratulations are in order to 
Bernie Mulaskey of Fairfax, California, be- 
cause when the contest staffer who presented 
Mulaskey's case emerged from the Kumqua- 
torium, he had only six tomatoes, three plums, 
and an eggplant on his coveralls. 

This was the first Softalk contest ever en- 
tered by Mulaskey, a former inventor for Chev- 
ron Research. "I usually don't have time for 
these things, but when I saw the word 'creative,' 
I just couldn't resist." 

Mulaskey has more than forty patents un- 
der his belt, mostly in the area of chemical 
catalysis for the oil industry. He uses his Apple 
at home and another one at work, both with 
CP/M systems. However, Mulaskey won't be 
choosing any CP/M software as his prize from 
Computerland of Marin, his local store. "I'm 
going to leave choosing the prizes to my daugh- 
ter," he explains. "She rarely gets a chance to 
play with the Apple, so I'll let her choose her fa- 
vorite games." 

Here's Mulaskey's blue ribbon entry. For a 
unique approach, he took a typical inventor's 
angle — get the final product and work 
backward. 

Woz and Jobs really needed a name 
for their new company. Woz, in his usual 
left-brained manner, wrote down the first 
bigger name than IBM he could think of. 
"ABCDE will be our new name," he said. 

"That's not a name," replied Jobs. 
"At least put 'IBM' in the middle. Our 
new name is AIBME." 

Finally, using his right brain, Woz 
said, "That's too obvious. Let's change 
IBM to HAL like they did in the movie, 
2001. Our new name is AH ALE. It al- 
most sounds Hawaiian." 

They both liked this name, and the 
new company was born as AHALE 
Computer. In those days it was neces- 
sary to use the ASCII character code to 
enter their new name into the primitive 
AHALE computer. So, they input 65-72- 
65-76-69 in ASCII to spell their new 




Somewhere on each floor of the Soviet diplomatic mission in 
Pyongyang are the nine parts of an encoded message. Your 
future is assured if you can just find those pieces and put 
them together, and then solve the puzzle. But to do so you 
must avoid the embassy guards who make frequent rounds at 
unscheduled intervals. They don't ask questions first, either. 





You got a late start looking for that summer job, and all you 
could find was a baker apprentice position at the Automated 
Bakery Company. Simple enough, since the pies are made 
by machine ... all you have to do is add topping and put 
the pies away when they come out on the conveyor belt. 
Shouldn't be too difficult of a summer, you think to

MICROBUFFER WIU 
SPEED UP ANY PROGRAM 
THAT REQUIRES PRINTING. 



MICROBUFFER ALIOWS YOU 
TO PRINT AND PROCESS 
SIMULTANEOUSLY 

Now you don't have to wait for 
the printer to finish before you 
can use your computer again. 

YOU CAN DUMP 
PRINTING DATA DIRECTLY 
TO MICROBUFFER. 

Unlike your printer, Microbuffer 
accepts data as fast as your 
computer can send it. So there's 
never a bottleneck. 

Microbuffer first stores the 
data in its own memory buffer 
and then takes control of your 
printer. This frees the computer 
ifor more productive functions. 

Additional output may be 
dumped to the buffer at any 
time and it will be printed in 
turn. 

THERE IS A MICROBUFFER 
FOR ANY PRINTER/COMPUTER 
COMBINATION. 

Microbuffers are available in 
Centronics-compatible parallel 
or RS-232C serial versions. 

FOR APPLE II COMPUTERS, 
Microbuffer II features on-board 



firmware for text formatting and 
advanced graphics dump 
routines. Both serial and parallel 
versions have very low power 
consumption. Special functions 
include Basic listing formatter, 
self-test, buffer zap, and 
transparent and maintain modes. 
The 16K model is priced at $259 
and the 32K, at $299. 

FOR EPSON PRINTERS, Microbuffer 
is $159 in either an 8K serial or a 
16K parallel version. The serial 
buffer supports both hardware 
handshaking and XON-XOFF 
software handshaking at baud 
rates up to 19,200. Both Epson 
interfaces are compatible with all 
Epson commands 
including GRAFTRAX-80 and 
GRAFTRAX-80 + . 

ALL OTHER PRINTER/COMPUTER 
COMBINATIONS are served by the 
in-line, stand-alone Microbuffers. 
Both serial and parallel versions 
are expandable up to 256K. The 
serial stand-alone will support 
different input and output baud 
rates and handshake protocol. 
The 32K model starts at $299, 
64K for $349. 64K add-ons for up 
to a total of 256K are just $179. 

When you think of how much 
time Microbuffer will save, 
can you afford to not have one?

SIMPLE TO INSTALL. 

Microbuffer II is slot-independent. 
It will fit directly inside the Apple 
II in any slot except zero. 

Microbuffer for your Epson 
mounts easily in the existing 
auxiliary slot directly inside the 
printer. 

The stand-alone Microbuffer is 
installed in-line between virtually 
any printer and computer.

name, AHALE. 

"Wait a minute!" shouted Jobs. "I 
can use my right brain, too. Let's put the 
name of our 6502 chip into AHALE. 
That would be really clever. We should 
name the company 65 65 02 76 69 in 
ASCIL" 

"Dumb again, Jobs," Woz protest- 
ed. "Anyone knows that would spell 
AA(ctrl-B)LE. We can't even print the 
control character. But we know that our 
6502 chip is twice as good as two Z-80 
chips or any 8080, so let's use 80 80 in- 
stead of 65 02." 

"Great idea again, Woz," agreed an 
enthusiastic Jobs. "The new company 
will now be known as 65 80 80 76 69, 
translated as APPLE." 

And so to this day, what might have 
been AHALE Computer is called "Ap- 
ple" because of the Great Wizard of Woz. 

Good going, Bernie. A real kick in the 
ASCII. 

Place and Show. Yes, it was an ugly scene 
amidst flying tomatoes, and everyone agreed 
that all the finalists should have won. But re- 
member, our contestants don't like to share 
prizes. Here are the other finalists in no par- 
ticular order. 

Andy Ihnatko of Westwood, Massachu- 
setts, was our man in the field covering the 
Great Penguin War which pitted the King's 
United Military Quarry for Upper Antarctic 
Terrestrials (KUMQUAT) against a scrappy 
and sCTawny Agency for Penguin Parity of Land- 
ed Edibles (APPLE). Ihnatko defined the war 
as a great big bicker over which group of pen- 
guins had rights to a limited supply of herring, 
the Antarctic equivalent of Twinkies. 

APPLE, it seems, was fighting for personal 
liberty, while KUMQUAT was fighting for 
sheer gluttony. Flipper-to-flipper combat en- 
sued and, according to Ihnatko, the death toll 
rose to forty penguins within a month. The fol- 
lowing is a firsthand account of how the alter- 
cation was resolved: 

Pelnius Penguin, the APPLE colo- 



We got a bizarre phone call the other day. 
Remember last month's "Contest That's Out of 
This World"? Apparently only a handful of peo- 
ple came close to the right answer to the game 
part of the contest by the deadline and the Bez- 
nardians, ofFworid authors of a game distrib- 
uted by Southwestern Data Systems, were in- 
censed. "Who are these humans, who can't un- 
derstand simple Gluebedopey? We demand that 
you continue this contest until someone gets it 
right. If not, we will turn everyone in Silicon 
Gulch into semi-sentient gnats." What could we 
do? Certainly not doom all those high-tech resi- 
dents to a life of semicoherent buzzing in the 
wind and fog. So we decided to make the game 
part two separate contests. The first one closes 
on the original date of October 31. The second 
closes on November 30. The prize for both con- 
tests is $100 worth of software or hardware from 
your local dealer. 



ny's genius, was putting the finishing 
touches on his latest invention. The ma- 
chine attracted all the other APPLEs be- 
cause of the lovely pictures it drew and 
the pretty sounds it made. Since old Pelni- 
us was an APPLE, and therefore kind- 
hearted, he let KUMQUAT play with 
the invention also. Soon, the entire colo- 
ny was using the machine and playing 
games that Pelnius had written for it, and 
no one had any time to fight. 
Ihnatko tells us that the war was settled by 
the leaders of each side playing Flight Simula- 
tor, Time Zone, and Sabotage. The APPLEs 
won, and Pelnius named his invention after the 
ragtag band of diehards. 

Finalist Bruno Lanvin from Brooklyn, New 
York, offers the French Connection, or Explica- 
tion Francaise: 
P ourquoi pomme? Why Apple? Who 
knows that? 

Qui salt c A? 
O range would be too much; 

orange en dirait tro P 
M ais, poire ferait un bide; 

but pear would be a flo P 
M elon would be fatal. 

Melon serait fata L 
E t, done, pourquoi pas pomme? 

So, well, why not Appl E? 
Tres bien, Bruno. Vous avez gagne des In- 
visiTabs. 

During all the tomato flinging, we found 
ourselves a poet in Marsha Hague, who lives in 
Rochester, Minnesota. Not only did her entry 
possess more esthetic quality than just a few 
rhyming words, but it was the only Woz-'n'- 
Jobs story that took place before the Apple's 
creation. And here it is: 

On lovely Erin long ago, of times 
Which only legends tell, a Siren cast 
her charming spell. With voice like silv'ry 
chimes 

she sang, and gUs'ning dew-dropped 

shamrocks cried 
while unicorns that frolicked stopped and 

sighed . . . 
A gentle rain began to fall, aglow 
with scintillating shards of sunHt hues ' 
that spawned a rainbow; most intense its 

blues! 

Then two enchanted strangers found their 

way 

across a magic threshold's mist of time. 
At rainbow's end they found a pot sublime! 
Twas filled with apples! Knowing smiles, the 
two 

exchanged. Their search was done and home 
they flew 

while shouting, "Here we'll build a plant 

someday!" 

The Softalk Grammy goes to Bruce Hahne 
of Iowa City, Iowa, who sent in not only the 
words to his entry, A Star Is Bom or What to 
Name the Baby, but also enclosed full sheet mu- 
sic with piano accompaniment. The contest 
staff had a good time singing in an unintended 
sixteen-part harmony (there was only one part); 
if you'd like to sing, too, it goes to the tune of 



The Ship Titanic. Hahne points out that the Ti- 
tanic in no way reflects the Apple or its quality. 
Here's part of it: 

Oh, they built a small computer with a 6502. 

They knew they had a system that the people 
would love, too. 

But they scratched their heads in vain when 
they tried to think up a name 

A star was born when Apple got its name. 
Chorus: 

Oh, it was new, 

and it was good 

and its chips were working like they should 

(like they should). 
They had worked 'til it was done, and now 

finally it would run. 
A star was bom when Apple got its name! 
They argued over "Lemon," considered 

"Cherry," too. 
Said Steve Jobs, "We'll decide it before this 

day is through — 
for computers without names are like a micro 

without games." 
A star was born when Apple got its name. 

(Chorus) 

At ten o'clock there entered Jobs's great aunt 

of eighty-three 
sipping cider through a straw as the case 

would happen to be, 
but while coming through the door, she 

spilled her juice on the motherboard. 
A star was born when Apple got its name. 

(Chorus) 

"Don't mind that spill!" cried Wozniak, "I 

swear it must be fate! 
We'll call it 'Apple,' " he decided, but then 

his aunt hollered, "Wait! 
'Apple' will not win, for it caused mankind's 

first sin!" 

A star was born when Apple got its name. 
(Chorus) 

Said his aunt, "I wouldn't use it; it's sure to 

be your bane." 
"Never mind," smiled Wozniak, " 'Apple' it 

remains." 

"I'm sure that fate won't lie — it'll be the 

apple of our eye!" 
A star was born when Apple got its name. 

(Chorus) 

Very few tomatoes were flying when the 
contest staff reviewed the entry sent in by 
Shawn R. Smith of Greendale, Wisconsin: 
A few years back, two men were put 
on assignment to build a means of trans- 
portation for veteran cavalrymen. Their 
idea was to build a twenty-four-foot-tall 
horse with a large passenger area in the 
torso. 

After a few weeks of hard labor, they 
finally finished it. They named it Jake. 
Jake was a computerized horse, even 
though he acted as if he were alive. He 
also had a lot of extras such as AM-FM 
radio and air conditioning. 

When he was unveiled, the cavalry- 
men cheered, hollered, and wanted a 
ride. Jake was more than delighted. 

After a few days of transporting peo-

lb Do It Right 

To make a Winchester disk for just Apple®II. 



That's how we set out to design our hard disk for 
the Apple®II. To understand the needs of serious 
users and programmers, and to correct the errors 
of our predecessors. 

You want user-friendliness. So we wrote hard disk 
versions of Apple DOS, CP/M® and Pascal that 
are highly user-friendly and loaded with 
useful features. 

□ Auto-boot hard disk 

□ Menu-driven utilities 

□ Single-keystroke program execution in DOS 

□ Disk search with wild cards, and many more 

You want flexibility. So we made every 
feature variable. 

□ From 1 to 16 operating systems on each disk 

□ Operating system spaces grow as needed 

□ Slot independence 

□ Variable size volumes (to 400K in DOS) 

□ Mountable and unmountable volumes (even in CP/M) 

□ Custom DOS allowed 

You want reliability. We use Seagate drives only. 
And Corona's unique data protection technology. 

□ DataGuard™ 32-bit error correction code 

□ Failsafe™ read-after-write and automatic bad-sector reallocation 

□ 2-level impact-protection packaging 



You want low-cost backup. So we wrote backup 
utilities that make floppy backup convenient. 

□ File compacting to reduce the number of floppies 

□ Volume selective backup in all operating systems 

□ Date selective backup in Pascal 

□ Automatic diskette sequencing to ease floppy handling 

You want compatibility. We maximize compati- 
bility with existing software and peripheral cards. 

□ 9K interface card leaves main memory untouched 

□ Interrupts are allowed 

□ Boot protected floppies from slot 6 without removing hard disk 

□ Automatic slot/drive to hard disk remapping 

And you want support. We do that right too. 

□ Hardware depot service in every region 

□ Programmer's guides at each level 

□ Software theft-protection on the hard disk 

Compare the features that matter to you. 
And visit our local dealer or distributor for 
a demonstration. You'll see the difference 
specialization makes.

For more than thirty years, a real bear 
named Smokey reigned as the mascot of the 
United States Forest Service and as the con- 
science of campers all over the country. He was 
well qualified to speak against forest fires: he 
was a victim of one as a cub, which is how the 
service found him. The original Smokey is gone, 
but his image remains to remind us about the 
disasters we can help prevent. 

Just such a mascot, just such a lovable con- 
science, seemed the ideal reminder to us as com- 
puterists to help keep the fire of program pira- 
cy under control. 

It seemed only natural to the people at Pen- 
guin Software, concerned as they have been 
with the issue of piracy and innovative as 



they've been in dealing with it, that their al- 
ready lovable company pet, the penguin, should 
carry the standard for its prevention. 

What's in a Name? Such is the genesis of 
the software piracy penguin. All he lacks now 
is — and here's where you come in — a name. 
Obviously, it can't be Smokey. 

What would you name the friendly poster 
penguin? 

Send as many choices as you like for a name 
(male or female — darned if we can tell), but 
each entry must be on a separate card or piece 
of paper, along with your own name, address, 
and phone numbw. 

All entries will be judged by the staff of Pen- 
guin Software, who's also providing the prizes. 



"Remember, 
only you 
can prevent 
software 
piracy." 



If you'd like to tell why you chose the name you 
did, you may well influence the judges. On the 
other hand, if your name is perfect, it will win 
even if you don't explain it. 

Why Bother. The thinker-upper of the win- 
ning name will get the very first "??? the Pen- 
guin" T-shirt produced, plus $100 worth of soft- 
ware from any Softalk advertiser. Ten runners- 
up will receive the second through tenth "??? the 
Penguin" T-shirts. 

Mail your entry by December 15, 1982, to 
Softalk Bear, Box 60, North Hollywood, CA 
91603. And remember, No-Name Penguin says, 
"Only you can prevent contest failure." 

This contest is sponsored and will be judged by Penguin 
Software. Geneva, Illinois.

what educational games are all about? 

Our games are educational, because 
you can't Kid parents. 

As a parent, you're probably very con- 
cerned with how much time your Kids 
spend playing mindless video games. 

Sure, they're fun. But they don't do 
much more than develop reflexes and 
hand-eye coordination. Spinnaker 
games are different. 

All our games have true 
educational value. They 
help develop a child's 
learning skills. And thafs 
something your kids can 
take with them wherever 
they go. 

Our games are fun, 
because you can't Kid Kids 

Kids like Spinnaker games for the 
same reasons they like roller coasters, 
going to the beach and ice cream 
sundaes. 

They're fun. Lots of fun. So much fun 
your kids will probably forget they're 
learning. 

Our games make the computer 
screen come to life. With colorful graph- 
ics, animation and sound. 

And they're easy to use. In fact a lot 
of our games are easy enough for kids 
who've never even used a computer 
before. 

How do we maKe our games both 
educational and fun? 

We're glad you asked. 

Educators and game programmers 
write our software. 

Educators, because they've been in 
the classroom and know how children 




learn. And what it takes to keep their 
interest. 

(jame programmers, because they 
know how to have fun with computers. 
These programmers give our games the 
high resolution graphics, animation and 
sound that make them so entertaining. 

And right now, we're introducing four 
new games that can be played on the 
most popular computers, Apple,® Atari,® 
and IBM® 

nrst there's EACEMAKER. It's for 
young computer users, kids ages 4-8, 
EACEMAKER helps children improve 
memory and concentration and provides 
familiarity with the computer 

Another game for young 
users is STORY MAChlME. 
This game lets children 
ages 5-9 write their own 
stories and see them 
acted out on the screen. 
STORY MACHIME helps 
children learn to write 
correctly and acquaints 
them with the keyboard. 
Our SMOOPER TROOPS™ 
detective series gives your child mys- 
teries to solve. As a Snooper Trooper, 
your child will have to do some daring 
detective work, including crawling 
through dark houses and talking to mys- 
terious agents.

SNOOPER TROOPS helps children learn 
to take notes, draw maps, classify infor- 
mation, and develops vocabulary and 
reasoning skills.

Many people think just because a computer does 
difficult things, it must be difficult to operate. Not so. 
At least not with PFS and PFS: REPORT. 

PFS and PFS: REPORT let you concentrate on 
doing your work, not on working your computer. There's 
no complicated programming or computer language to 
leam. Using the PFS Series is so straightforward, you 
can leam it in as little as 20 minutes, and that's some- 
thing both experts and beginners can appreciate. 

Design your own management system, simply. 

PFS lets you arrange your information in "forms" 
you design yourself. Once you've created your form— 
with spaces for all the necessary data— you simply fill 
in the blanks. 

If you don't like the original form, PFS lets you 
change ^Ms^ the form, without having to totally re-enter 
the information on it. 

To use your forms, just call up the information 
you want in a variety of ways such 
as "less thani' "more than," "equal 
tor 'TDetween" or "not." You can 
even find specific charac- 
ters, words, names or num- 



40-column format to accommodate larger printouts, 
and tell you how much room you have left on your disk. 
Get more out of what you put in. 

PFS: REPORT sorts, calculates, totals, formats 
and prints presentation-quality reports with up to 9 col- 
umns, in alpha or numeric order, with automatic 
entering and justification. With your information in 
this format, you can analyze it quickly to help spot 
trends, plan and make decisions. 

A whole family of software for Apple® 11 and III. 

PFS consistently ranks among the 5 top-selling 
business software packages for Apples. Because you 
can use it for almost anything— from chemical analyses 
to keeping track of your wine collection, from bal- 
ancing your checkbook to computing your payroll. 
And there are more programs on the way. 

For a free, hands-on demonstration of PFS and 
PFS: REPORT, stop by your local computer store. If

A 

communications 
package 
that's slightly 
easier to use 
than 

MICRO/TerminaL 



But 

a lot less 
functional* 




At MICROCOM we've made communicating with 

all kinds of computers easier and less expensive. Now, with 

MICRO/Terminai; users of Apple IF," Apple in™or IBM® 

Personal Computers can easily access any in-house or 

remote database. Directly, with a minimum of effort. 

With MICRO/Terminal, communications set-ups 

and log-on routines are entered only once. From then on 

they can be called up automatically. A built-in editor lets 

you change part of a program without re-doing all of it, 

and you can edit off-line. 

Plus you can access your company computer and more 
than 1,000 commercial services. The price? Under $100. 
So that by comparison with other systems, anything else 
is like talking through a tin can. 
Just ask your computer dealer for more details.

For the best 
Talking Game 




For the 
Apple®II+ 



Usingthe VOICE BOX ; Speech Synthesizer 

Nowyou can make your Apple® II"*" games and other programs come alive with the VOICE BOX bythe 
Alien Group — the first low-cost, smart speech synthesizer with urilimited vocabulary. 

Add jokes to your programs, Insults. Compliments. Help messages. Stories. Alien voices. Animal roars. 
Have your computer talk to the tire department or police in emergencies. To kids. Or blind people, 
Teach touch typing with immediate spoken feedback. Or just about any other subject — the fun way. Or 
help a speech-impaired friend communicate , , . the possibilities are limitless. 

The VOICE BOX plugs into any Apple II slot. No power supply or special interfaces needed. 

Just select from its simple screen menu. A dictionary with thousands of common words (on diskette) 
automatically translates your text into speech. It's that easy. 

But don't let its friendliness fool you, The VOICE BOX has all 64 phonemes (basic sounds, like "ah" ) built 
in. So you can precisely create any word or sound you can imagine. And store it all on diskette. Names 
or foreign language words, for example. Or wierd non-human languages. 

Let me entertain you — The VOICE BOX is creative too. It will crack you and your friends up with 
non-stop random, grammatically correct sentences, using words you specify. It also has an amusing 
talking face -with lip-sync animation — a real crowd-stopper. Best of all, you can call the VOICE BOX 
from any BASIC program and make your program really hum —literally! 

The VOICE BOX comes in two versions. For $ 1 39.00 you get a card plus a diskette (with programs and 
dictionary). And there's a deluxe version with the dictionary in ROM (no diskette to bother with), 
speaker, and ability to "sing" in any key, (Both versions require 32K or more Applesoft and DOS 3,3), 

Not Dumb — Don't confuse the VOICE BOX with "dumb" speech synthesizers that can't learn new words. 
Or software-based ones with lower speech quality — and an annoying tendency to blank out the 
display when they talk. The VOICE BOX is a true breakthrough in speech synthesis. Small wonder 
thousands of Apple owners hove already bought the VOICE BOX. 

The VOICE BOX is available now at leading computer stores throughout the world. Or direct from the 
Alien Group, with 10-day money back guarantee if you're not completely satisfied.

Discussion 



Open Discussion gives you the chance to air your views 
and concerns, to seek answers to questions, to offer so- 
lutions or helpful suggestions, and to develop a rapport 
with other readers. It's what you make it, so share your 
thoughts, typed or printed, and double-spaced (please), 
in Softalk'5 Open Discussion. Box 60, North Holly- 
wood, CA 91603. To ensure the inclusion of as many 
contributions as possible, letters may be condensed and

Skirmishes on a Family's Front Lines 

My father-in-law has absolutely lost his mind 
over Castle Wolfenstein. For the last five 
months he has used his Apple for nothing else, 
and his study is wallpapered with castle maps. 

The family is in despair. At dinner he re- 
lates the adventure of the day, complete with 
bullet counts and the number of SS men be- 
tween grenade boxes. He tells us how he lures 
pursuing SS guards into side rooms where he 
robs them at gunpoint and leaves them 
stranded. He never fails to remind us that hold- 
ing down the repeat key and space bar lets him 
open chests at double speed. He loves to 
describe blowing a hole in a wall so he can lob 
grenades at passing guards through it. His idea 
of ecstasy is recounting how he ran out the front 
door of the castle, seconds ahead of three ag- 
itated guards, and was rewarded by the sight 
of a pastoral landscape with a cloud the shape 
of a supersonic rabbit. 

I desperately need to find a new game to dis- 
tract him from his headlong pursuit of Nazi 
escapism. Any suggestions? Would Wizardry 
get his attention? He barely looked at Robot- 
War. Softporn Adventure amused him for a day. 
Alien Rain diverted him for nearly two weeks, 
but I need something more permanent. He's a 
General now, and today he found the war 
plans. It's only a matter of time before he gets 
promoted again. If that happens, I won't be the 
only field marshal in the family anymore. 
Bruce D. Clayton, Mariposa, CA 

Hobbyist Turns Pro 

I bought my Apple over three years ago as a 
new toy. I didn't know a thing about hard, soft, 
and firmware. Learning Finnish was easier than 
learning assembly language. The hobby soon 



turned into a small (micro) business, and in- 
stead of learning how to program I bought pro- 
grams to use. I became a user-hobbyist. One of 
the first things I wanted to do with my Apple 
was to maintain a mailing label database for 
the local Mensa chapter. With more than 
fifteen hundred names, the task seemed insur- 
mountable. 

Along came Bob Clardy and Synergistic at 
the West Coast Computer Faire two years ago. 
He had a neat little program called Mail List 
Database for sale for thirty dollars. A quick 
look at the manual and a demonstration of the 
fast sort on a binary file produced a sale. That 
program turned out to be one of my most used. 
It took three of us seven days to enter the mem- 
bers' mailing information onto three disks. 
Later, Synergistic came out with a sort/merge 
utility for the program. This allowed us to 
merge up to five files into a zip sort. The time 
required each month to enter new members and 
make changes of address was less than one hour 
because of the ease of entry and the error-free 
operation of the program. The runoff of labels 
also was fast, considering the old printer used. 

The time came when we outgrew the need 
for labels, but we did need to maintain a local 
roster as we made print-outs available to local 
members once a year. Early in the game, I wrote 
to Bob Clardy about the possibihty of printing 
the information on a single line, roster style. He 
wrote back some time later with a few listing 
changes, and I had a roster program. An up- 
dated Mail List Database has incorporated this 
feature. Because of our long-distance customiz- 
ing sessions, I actually learned a good deal 
about Basic programming. 

But the best was yet to come! Late last sum- 
mer several of us in our group wanted to start 
publishing a literary magazine. The first couple 
of months we generated labels as we had be- 
fore. But we foresaw the need to keep track of 
subscription numbers, expiration dates, and so 
on. Another letter to Bob produced much help 
on customizing the program. Our Subscription 
Mail Label Database now consists of subscrib- 
ers entered in order of subscription, a field with 
the expiration date, the usual name and ad- 



dress fields, and an extra long zip field to cover 
foreign subscribers' country names. 

We now have more than five hundred sub- 
scribers and it takes less than two hours each 
month to update, sort by zip, and print labels. I 
have sent our aggregate customizations to Bob 
Clardy, and he mentioned at this year's fair that 
a technical note will soon be available to all reg- 
istered owners that details these changes. In all 
the time that I've been using this (steadily over 
two years) I have not had one single problem 
with the software. It is completely listable, mod- 
ifiable, and trouble-free. If this isn't testimony 
to the advantages of unlocked disks, I don't 
know what is. All the people I talked to at 
Synergistic were extremely willing to help, and 
my letters were answered promptly. This is not 
to imply that other publishers haven't been 
helpful, but I want to underscore my feelings 
when I get three hundred dollars' worth of serv- 
ice and program from only thirty dollars. 
Tod Wicks, Palo Alto, CA 

Databases Ahoy! 

Open Discussion provides an excellent means 
for readers to learn about software that is, or is 
not, worth their hard-earned money. I would 
like to call attention to a software package that 
is definitely impressive It's The General Man- 
ager by Sierra On-Line. I am so pleased with 
this program that I hardly know where to begin. 

The General Manager is a hierarchical data- 
base manager. Hierarchical is a term to de- 
scribe the way it structures a database defined 
by the user. Such data structures are built 
aroimd a parent-offspring relationship (off- 
spring can be parents of subsets of offspring al- 
so). Without delving too deeply, if you think 
about this scheme for a few minutes it will be- 
come apparent that you can have multiple data- 
bases on-line whenever you are running the pro- 
gram. Furthermore, databases do not have to 
be related. The system automatically seeks and 
loads into a RAM card, if available, upon boot- 
ing. It will run on a single disk system if it has 
to, but two disk drives are recommended, and 
three are optimum. It will also work with aCor- 
vus or Santa Clara hard disk system without 
any patch or program modification. 

Its most impressive feature is that it can be 
interfaced to a user- written program. It will gen- 
erate DOS 3.3 text files that can be edited with 
word processors and text editors such as Screen 
Writer //, Apple Writer, and Apple PIE. The data- 
base can even be proofread by The Dictionary, 
The Sensible Speller, and a number of other 
proofreading programs. The text file feature 




Protection for the Apple II

tive, professional keyboard cover. Qwk is that protection. Made of high impact, textured black

gives the program incredible flexibility. You can 
either use the very capable built-in report mod- 
ule or customize your reports using your word 
processor. 

Sierra On-Line devoted a whole chapter in 
the very thorough manual to explain how to 
write programs that access your database. Con- 
trast this with the paranoia exhibited by many 
other publishers when it comes to revealing the 
inner workings of their software. The databases 
you build allow you to specify types and lengths 
of fields, create screens to look like forms that 
you are now using, output information from 
one field to another, or create a field solely for 
displaying data generated from computations 
performed on other fields. After you create your 
database, but before you begin using it. The 
General Manager runs a syntax check on it to 
make sure that your specifications are correct. 
Nice touch! 

I could go on and on. I checked out such 
programs as The Data Factory and DB Master 
before I settled on The General Manager. Al- 
though my final choice was the least expensive 
of the many I tried out, I truly beheve that it is 
the best at any price. It would be worth any- 
one's time to take a close look at this package if 
they're in the market for a powerful, user- 
friendly database management system. It al- 
lows the user to dictate his or her own terms in- 
stead of having to conform to some program- 
mer's idea of how people should manipulate in- 
formation.

Sharing Time and a Good Experience 

I would like to commend Ed Magnin of Tele- 
phone Software Connection for his excellent 
Terminal Program and, more important, for 
his excellent support. I purchased the program 
via modem to use with my university's IBM sys- 
tem using the MUSIC timesharing system. 
When I called TSC after experiencing some dif- 
ficulty with properly configuring to the half-du- 
plex protocols of the IBM system, Ed placed 
several long-distance calls to our system in or- 
der to test patches to the program. He quickly 
modified the program to operate properly. 

The program is versatile and reasonably 
priced. I recommend this company without 
qualification. Some of the big names in soft- 
ware should give this level of support. 
Bill Allbritten, Murray, KY 

Keeping up with the Dow Jones 

As a result of your excellent article about The 
Dow Jones Market Analyzer I purchased the 
program. It does everything as noted, and the 
documentation is excellent and user oriented. 
Vendor support is also excellent as I received a 
prompt response to a written inquiry from RTR 
Software. 

One of the features of the program that was 
not noted is its ability to treat most any indica- 
tor as a stock and use it as a base in making com- 
parison charting. For example, I put in the Dow 
Jones closing prices for the last year, treating 
them like a stock with the name "DJI." Other 
indicators or indexes could be treated the same 



way. The only added requirement to chart this 
would be compiling the historical data, as it is 
not available for retrieval from Dow Jones. 

The main disadvantage to the program is 
the lack of spieed in charting. About one hun- 
dred fifty units (days, weeks, and so on) takes 
about a minute to project. Secondly, there is the 
lack of a menu printer program. The documen- 
tation does include suggested user jump rou- 
tines that may be set up in the program disk by 
a program-wise user. , 
Merle Zmak, Clayton, CA Kf^ 

More PIE Please 

Allow me to echo Apple PIE diehards and say 
to the new PIE Writer users that either PIE is 
an outstanding word processor. Because of the 
need to place formatting commands within text, 
and the inability to see exactly what the finished 
text looks like on screen while entering text, PIE 
is initially more difficult to learn than other 
word processors. However, PIE has the ability 
to enter and edit without having to toggle from 
an entering text mode to an editing text mode. 
This shortens total time at the keyboard. 

I am attempting to do a mail list merge with 
a database sequential text file and PIE. Pres- 
ently, PIE can only read a /*/£-produced file. 
From each record it will read the fields sequen- 
tially. The fields must be separated by the block 
terminating character (<). The use of a file like 
this is limited. A file made for one form letter 
may not be compatible with a different form 
letter. 

Does anyone out there know how to do a 
patch to PIE so that it will, with a new format 
command .field x (or with something more 
compatible that does not conflict with the .fi 
command), read field x from a file when re- 
quested and include it in the document? This 
would allow PIE to scan for a field when re- 
quested and not have to look at each field se- 
quentially. The records would be sorted by the 
database and placed in a sequential text file for 
use in PIE. PIE would pick the field from each 
record and include the necessary information in 
the document. This feature would greatly en- 
hance PIE and make it probably the most 
powerful word processor around.

A Verdict of Acquittal 

It was with mixed emotions that I read your re- 
view of Client Management System II in Sep- 
tember Softalk's Marketalk Reviews. It was for 
the most part extremely positive. For this I am 
extremely pleased as well as grateful. Our phone 
has been ringing off the hook, as calls keep 
coming in from all parts of the country since 
that issue hit the stands. 

The criticisms, in part, were absolutely in- 
valuable. Because of this, we have made a few 
changes. Back-up copies are now furnished at no 
charge upon receipt of a completed product reg- 
istration card. Furthermore, the instruction 
manual is currently being reorganized and re- 
written to include a hands-on tutorial. 

I must, however, take exception to the fol- 
lowing statement that appeared toward the end 



of the review: ". . . the system, when config- 
ured as suggested in the manual, uses about 
thirty disks; in a large, busy office the disk stor- 
age could easily require more than a hundred 
disks and frequent disk swapping." A hundred 
disks is about fourteen megabytes! Fourteen 
megabytes on mini-floppy disks! Out of the 
more than one hundred attorneys that are cur- 
rently using our software nobody is using near- 
ly that many disks. The only offices that are us- 
ing any more than eight disks are those that re- 
quire each attorney to have his data kept 
separate in accordance with his own account- 
ing requirements. Our Apple III version, using a 
ProFile five megabyte hard disk drive, will hold 
a thousand open cases, plus hundreds of critical 
dates cases! 

According to our research, more than 90 
percent of the law offices in this country consist 
of four attorneys or less. Our experience shows 
that the average attorney bills approximately 
forty to seventy cases per month. Client Man- 
agement System II (mini-floppy version) holds 
more than 260 cases, on eight data disks. Your 
figures state that the system requires from thir- 
ty to one hundred disks (enough storage to hold 
from 990 to 3,3(X) cases). However, don't sell us 
short, Softalk. Our enhanced Apple III version 
(scheduled to be introduced at the San Bernar- 
dino Bar Convention in October) as well as our 
IBM pc and Displaywriter versions (scheduled 
to be introduced in December) will easily han- 
dle numbers in excess of those mentioned here. 

I can only assume that this mix-up was the

Harvesting the Slack 

You now have the notable distinction of being 
the first major computing magazine to feature 
computers in agriculture. Congratulations!? 
Computing farmers have been around as long 
as computing anybody else. Farming is as so- 
phisticated a business as any other business; the 
potential for farm computerization has never 
been more potent. So where has everybody 
been? 

We realized over a year ago that the com- 
puting farmer was going to be neglected, so last 
winter we started our own full-fledged, farm- 
computing magazine (not mentioned in your ar- 
ticle). We now have readers all over the conti- 
nent wanting to know the things nobody else 
bothered to find out for them. Please tell your 
readers (do you even know how many of them 
are farmers?) that there's a magazine that pulls 
up the slack you other guys left behind.

Micro Scopes in Focus 

The article in August Softalk by David Hunter 
titled "Down on the Farm with Apples" both- 
ers me. 

I think the author did an excellent job in re- 
searching and writing about the little-known 
and growing use of Apples on America's farms. 
It is certainly to be expected that our farmers 
would adopt and adapt the latest technology in 
their continuing quest to increase their in- 
comes. This "selfish" motive has enabled them 
to outproduce most other farmers in the world. 

Yet, the article begins on a contradictory 
note. In the preamble Genesis is quoted, in 
which Yahweh comments on Noah's sacrifice 
to him after the Flood, stating that he will never 
again "smite every living thing." The article 
proper then begins: "About ten thousand years 
ago, our Neolithic ancestors discovered agri- 
culture. Before, for untold millenia . . ." 

First the author quotes God, who, true be- 
lievers hold, created the universe a few thou- 
sand years ago. He then expresses the usual re- 
count of evolution that requires billions of 
years for its workings. It should be realized that, 
for all intents and purposes, the geological ages 
are synonymous with evolution. 

The point is that either one or the other is 
true. Either God created the universe no more 
than some eight thousand years ago or life be- 
gan perhaps four billion years ago in a warm 
mud puddle and blindly squirmed its way up- 
ward and onward, branching into different 
forms thousands of times and culminating in 
man. Either one or the other there is no com- 
promise. Any and all attempts to harmonize 



evolution and the Bible have been, or can be, 
shown to be entirely and utterly useless and 
nugatory. 

Consider the fact that it is truly impossible 
to scientifically prove or disprove any particu- 
lar concept of origins. The essence of the scien- 
tific method is experimental repeatability. The 
most outstanding scientist is incapable of ob- 
serving or repeating origins. Incidentally, since 
scientists now reserve the term "theory" only 
for propositions that can be experimentally 
proven or disproven, evolution does not quah- 
fy for that classification. 

Then, contrast the laws of thermodynamics 
with the fundamental tenet of evolution — that it is 
a process, essentially irreversible, that tends to 
ever higher levels of organization. If there is any 
law firmly established in modern science, it is 
the second law of thermodynamics, of energy 
decay. This law states that every system in iso- 
lation always tends to move from order to dis- 
order — its energy tending to be transformed 
into lower levels of availability, finally reaching 
the state of complete randomness and non- 
availability for further work. For the universe, 
this leads ultimately to heat death. Obviously, 
this second law by itself negates evolution. 

David Hunter's article is excellent insofar as 
its main theme is concerned. But it starts off on 
the wrong theological foot so far as Christian 
believers, many of whom are farmers, are con- 
cerned.

National Logo Invitational 

The National Logo Exchange is a monthly news- 
letter dedicated to the Logo teachers in the 
classroom. Each issue contains articles by fel- 
low teachers, columns by informed educators, 
reviews, listings, tips, techniques, and opinions. 
As the practical methods of teaching with Logo 
emerge, we wish to serve as a vehicle for the ex- 
change of ideas and strategies, and to help with 
the development of working Logo philoso- 
phies. 

We would like to issue to David Greene and 
any other interested readers of Softalk an invi- 
tation to share their thoughts and experiences 
with other teachers by writing short articles for 
publication. In general, our readers are inter- 
ested in practical matters: ideas and techniques 
that can be put to use right away.

Resounding Novation 

David Palmer's letter in September Open Discus- 
sion prompted me to finally write about what 
I consider to be the most monumental example 
of product misrepresentation in the microcom- 
puter industry. The product, the Apple-Cat II 
by Novation, has been widely advertised as of- 
fering communication capability up to 1,200 
bps. I had the misfortune to take Novation at 
their word. 

Last May, I purchased an Apple-Cat II with

the 1 ,200 bps capability. When I was unable to 
communicate with a mainframe computer at 
1 ,200 bps (300 bps worked fine), I called Nova- 
tion. Novation informed me, after some hem- 
ming and hawing and switching me from one 
party to another, that their Apple-Cat II would, 
in fact, communicate with another computer at 
1,200 bps — but only if that computer was an- 
other micro with an identical Apple-Cat II 
setup. This limitation never quite gets into No- 
vation's ads. 

I certainly hope the new Hayes modem, 
which has just been released and is being adver- 
tised as having 1,200 bps capability, is truly ca- 
pable of doing what the manufacturer claims 
it will. 

Robert Berman, Vienna, VA 

The manufacturer responds: 

We at Novation are most unhappy to learn of 
the confusion that our advertising has caused. 
The information subsequently given to Robert 
Berman also appears to have been too narrow 
and somewhat confusing to him. I would like to 
attempt to clear the air by providing some ad- 
ditional information on the subject of Nova- 
tion's product offerings. 

Our Apple-Cat II product line is composed 
of two main units. The first is the basic Apple- 
Cat II board which plugs into a single slot of a 
standard Apple II. This board, when properly 
installed and operated, will support dial tele- 



phone line communications at data rates of 1 10, 
300, and 1,200 bits per second. More properly 
speaking, we say that the Apple-Cat II is on- 
line compatible with the Bell 103 and Bell 202 
standards. 

The 103 modem standard is full duplex, 
meaning data may pass in both directions at the 
same time. It covers the speed range of 0 to 300 
bps. The 202 standard is half duplex, meaning 
data passes in one direction at a time only, and 
it covers the speed range of 0 to 1,200 bps. 

The Apple-Cat II product can play with 
computers that are equipped with modems 
compatible with these Bell 103 or Bell 202 
standards. It is most definitely not the case 
that it will play only with Apple-Cat equipped 
systems. 

Quite the contrary; we provide with every 
Apple-Cat II, at no additional cost, a complete 
disk-based communicating operating system 
called ComWare. This software will turn the 
Apple II into a communicating terminal at 
speeds up to 300 bps, full duplex, or 1 ,200 bps, 
half duplex. No ComWare is needed at the 
other end, just a computer that has a Bell 103 or 
202 compatible modem. The software will do a 
lot more than this, such as file transfers, auto 
dialing from software directory, and so forth, 
but let's leave that for some other time. 

In addition to the ComWare software, we 
also offer as an option a ROM-based firmware 
program. This program simplifies the use of the 
Apple-Cat II from user-written software and 



eliminates the need to boot a disk before op- 
erating the modem card. 

The second main Apple-Cat product is our 
2 12 Expansion Module. This is a second print- 
ed circuit board that can be mounted in a sec- 
ond Apple II slot or, optionally, can be op- 
erated completely off the motherboard using 
our Slotsaver kit. The 212 Expansion Module 
increases the capability of the Apple-Cat II. It 
permits communication with any Bell 212A 
compatible modem, operating at speeds of 
1,200 bps in full duplex mode. Most of the ma- 
jor public database systems allow access 
through the Bell 212A. 

Both our firmware ROM and the Com- 
Ware software fully support use of the optional 
212 Expansion Module. We believe that we are 
currently the only company offering an integral 
212 compatible product for the Apple II 
computer. 

I'll be happy to explain further any details 
that remain unclear to Apple-Cat users or po- 
tential users of these Novation products.

Hung up on Students 

I have written a database program to use for 
student records and schedules, and I've fol- 
lowed pretty much the same format used by 
most databases. In the program I store thirty-six 
pieces of information on each student. The in- 
formation is input as strings, one at a time. Af- 
ter each of the student's data strings is com- 
plete, it is stored in a random access data file be- 
fore continuing to the next one. 

When a series of students is entered, the 
computer hangs up right in the middle of 
inputting the information. I am forced to hit re- 
set and run the program again to continue. This 
problem always seems to occur in the same 
place, about halfway through the thirty-six 
entries on the fourth student being inputted. 

In September Open Discussion, a letter 
from Charles Wells indicated that he was hav- 
ing a similar problem with File Cabinet. What's 
causing this problem and what can I do to 
eliminate it? 

Lynn Leopard, Chillicothe, MO 

Stringtime in November 

Charles Wells's letter in September Open Dis- 
cussion gave a good explanation of why Apple- 
soft Basic sometimes gets uncommunicative 
while it does garbage collection on the strings 
that it no longer needs in storage. He pointed 
out that this is the price Applesoft makes us pay 
for being allowed variable-length strings. 

In addition to the nuisance of having your 
Apple go out to lunch at unexpected moments, 
the length of time Applesoft takes for garbage 
collection can get downright frustrating if your 
program uses a lot of string variables. Here is a 
short program that allows you to time the gar- 
bage collection function:

20 DIM A$(N)

After you tell this program how many strings 
you want the garbage collection to work on 
while you time it, the program stores the strings 
in an array. Then it rings the bell so you'll know 
to start timing when the garbage collection be- 
gins, and the bell rings again when the garbage 
collection is finished. After you've experiment- 
ed with timing the garbage collection for small 
numbers of strings (between 100 and 1,000), 
you're ready for the big time. Run the program 
again and tell it to work on 5,000 strings. Note 
the time when the first bell rings, and head for 
your back issues of Softalk to find those arti- 
cles you always meant to reread. You'll have 
plenty of time — Applesoft's garbage collection 
for 5,000 strings takes about thirty minutes. 
Try it! 

I got so frustrated at the slowness of Apple- 
soft's garbage collection that I decided to write 
a program to do this function more quickly. As 
soon as I have finished writing the documenta- 
tion for my program, I will begin exploring 
ways to make it available so others won't have 
to suffer so long while the Apple is out to lunch.

CATS in the Public Domain 

In September Open Discussion Ellis McDan- 
iels submitted an excellent letter stating the need 
for freer exchange of information concerning 
development of educational software. While I 
am a speech-language pathologist and not a 
teacher, users of microcomputers in rehabilita- 
tive settings share many of the problems ex- 
pressed by teachers such as Mr. McDaniels. 

The purpose of this letter is to inform those 
interested that the Audiology and Speech Pa- 
thology Service at the Veterans Administration 
Outpatient Clinic (425 South Hill Street, Los 
Angeles, CA 90013) has developed a series of 
reading treatment and testing programs on a 
single disk for the Apple II Plus. These pro- 
grams are collectively called CA TS {Computer- 
ized Aphasia Treatment System) and can be list- 
ed and copied; CA TS is not copyrighted and is 
under public domain. While CA TS was written 
for adults suffering from aphasia (a language 
disorder resulting from brain injury), it is also 
appropriate for younger people in need of read- 
ing testing and treatment. 

CATS is available free of charge. Anyone 
interested in getting more information about 
CA TS should write to me at the above address.

One Reader's Good Reading 

In reference to Ernie Brock of Sirius, whose let- 
ter questioning Softalk's polling procedures for 
Bestsellers appeared in the September issue — I 
say, more power to Softalk\ It seems that Mr. 
Brock's capitalist dreams are influencing his 
ideas, and Sirius Software too for that matter. 
He certainly should research his accusations be- 
fore making them. 

While on the subject of Sirius, I think that 
calling the people who sell Locksmith crooks is 



way out in left field. What is really crooked is 
charging five dollars for a replacement disk no 
matter what the problem is. Come on, what 
kind of policy is this? Perhaps Sirius and others 
in the industry should take a look at what the 
Carlston family is doing. I'm not even going to 
bring up the Joyport fiasco. 

Now, on another subject, I think Softalk 
should print examples of what the programs 
listed in the tutorials should look like when 
they're run, if it's applicable. Either that, or a 
very clear explanation of what's supposed to 
happen when they're run. As it is, I'm not al- 
ways sure if a program is running correctly, and 
I'm almost positive that the shape maker pro- 
gram isn't working properly. 

Lastly, isn't that Bill Budge pictured at the 
opening of Beginners' Comer, of all places? 
Thomas E. Burns, Stevensville, MI 

Bill Budge a beginner? Ridiculous! Or is it? 
Let's ask our readers. Drop a postcard to Sof- 
talk Budgie, Box 60, North Hollywood, CA 
91603. If you think the "beginner" is Bill Budge, 
write "It's him all right!" If you don't think it's 
Budge, write "No way!" Also include your name 
and address. If it is Budge, one person drawn 
from all the yes cards will win a copy of the real 
Bill Budge's new game { whenever it arrives). If it 
isn't him, all no way answers will receive a set of 
Softalk InvisiTabs — and one person chosen at 
random will still get a copy of Bill Budge's next 
game. 

All About Being Oobbered 

I was playing around with a program from 
All About Applesoft by Doug Carlston that ap- 
peared in Softalk, March 1982, and changed the 
following lines to: 

5 PRINT "Type a number between 0 and 
255": INPUT A% 
10 POKE 1024 + X, A% 
20 X = X+1: IF X<1024 THEN 10 

This worked fine; then I added 

30 GOTO 5 

and this resulted in a syntax error message. I ran 
it again, and the result was: 

?syntax error in 65054 

This clobbered the program, and even with line 
30 deleted the same error message resulted. 
Typing new gave me a syntax error message but 
did work. I reentered the program without line 
30, ran it, and got the same syntax error mes- 
sage in line 65054. 

Next, I turned off the Apple and just start- 
ed over, adding line 30, which worked once but 
then gave me a syntax error in line 30, then a 
syntax error in line 65054 over and over again. 
The only thing I can find out about 65054 is 
that it's in ROM. What's happening here? 
Eloise King, Big Timber, MT 

Adding goto 5 to the end of the sample pro- 
gram put the entire program into a loop, as you 
intended. However, it did not reset the value of 
X to zero. The first time through the program, x

increased from 1024 to 2048. When you poke 
into these addresses, you are poking data di-

However, the second time through the pro- 
gram, X starts equal to 2048. This area of RAM

program is stored. So the moment line 10 tries

Right in the Corner with Lights 

In the August Beginners' Comer it is stated that 
using more than two or three if-then tests on 
string variables in the same program will cause 
a crash, according to Apple. The Applesoft Ba- 
sic Programming Reference Manual (page 77) 
appears rather ambiguous on this: "//(string) 
then . . . when executed more than two or three 
times in a given program, causes the message 

7F0RMULA TOO COMPLEX ERROR 

to be printed." 

in the example given in Beginners' Comer, 
however, the variable (A$="Y") being tested 
was not a string at all. It would be evaluated 
simply as a variable. Moreover, Apple's caveat 
does not encompass string variables, only 
strings. At least on my Apple II Plus the fol- 
lovkdng program never hangs: 

10 GET A$ 
20 FOR K=1 TO 100 
30 IF A$ THEN X=1 
40 NEXT 

Nor does it hang when I substitute for line 30 // 
AS = "Y" then X=I, the specific test that con- 
cerned you. 

Evidently the only variation on this theme 



APPLEDEXTEROUS* 




* The ability of an Apple II® computer to perform more than one function 
concurrently when using the BREM-239D buffered serial interface. With an 
Appledexterous Apple, it is possible to print, compute or write to disk without 
interrupting or losing incoming data. In the output mode, the 239D spools data 
either to the on board printer port or the serial output channel. The 
BREM'239D is plug compatible with popular serial boards, is easily installed 
and costs only $299.00. What this means is a lot more juice from your Apple.

that creates a problem is of the form if "A" 
then. . . . This will produce the error message as 
predicted. And it is, of course, a string — not a 
variable, not.a string variable. It's a string con- 
stant, a term never employed by Apple, per- 
haps because they perceive it as redundant. Af- 
ter all, if it's not identified as a variable, then by 
default it's a constant, right? 
John W. Field, Fairfax, VA 

John Field is absolutely correct. I confess to 
misreading the manual, but I wonder why 
anyone would ever want to use if "A" then. 
This is logically exactly the same as if'a'oO 
then, which produces the "?type mismatch er- 
ror" message. When used with a string (but not 
a string variable) both are completely meaning- 
less when you remember thato means "nei- 
ther greater than nor less than" in the mathe- 
matical sense rather than "not equal to" (that is, 
not the same as) in the string sense. 
Nevertheless, since Applesoft doesn't realize 
that there's an implied conflict between types, it 
evaluates the expression anyway. Try in your 
example first 

30 IF "A" THEN PRINT SOFTALK 

and then 

30 IF ■■ " THEN PRINT SOFTALK 

The first treats the string as something and 
prints Softalk two or three times before bomb- 
ing; the second, recognizing the null string as 
nothing, prints nothing and causes no line feeds 
but bombs anyway. You'll also notice that 
if "a" then doesn't respond properly to onerr 
goto while if "a" <> 0 then does. Ah, the mys- 
teries of Applesoft. 
Christopher U. Light, Chicago, IL 

Indirect Access 

Can anyone tell me how to find out if a second 
disk drive exists from within a program with- 
out accessing the disk drive? Obviously a DOS 
command could be used, like verify (file name), 
but there you're accessing the drive. 
Chris Riley, Pompano Beach, FL 

Missing the Value . . . 

I'm heavily involved with the Apple II, mostly 
in a teaching role, normally using Applesoft. As 
the local Apple polisher, I get asked many 
questions about other features for the Apple. 
One frequent area is that of UCSD Pascal, with 
which I'm only slightly acquainted. 

It appears to me that the language is an 
abortion, and certainly unworthy of the lavish 
praise many heap upon it. It was so obviously 
designed by professional programmers operat- 
ing from a mainframe, rather than designed for 
user convenience in personal computers, that it 
makes me puke. 

One question that comes up quite frequent- 
ly is, "How do I tum the printer on?" There is 
obviously no equivalent of PR#1 or Lprint in 
the language, or at least in the Apple im- 
plementation of it. How could Apple Comput- 
er ever endorse a product with such a fun- 
damental weakness? They must have ghtter in

their eyes; unfortunately, all that glitters is not 
gold! 

With no thanks to Apple, their instruction 
manuals, or several Pascal for the Apple books, 
I have finally figured out how to use the printer 
to dump a disk catalog list or to transfer a text 
file to the PRINTER:, though hardly a sophisti- 
cated implementation. I've also figured out, 
after fruitless searches through the gob- 
bledygook of the language manual, how to send 
output to the printer during a running pro- 
gram. Creating an imaginary file and writing to 
it is hardly what one would call user-friendly.

ries on the PRINTER: or screen, is the subject 
of a future Pascal Path. I hope that my past and 
future efforts may be of help to you and those 
you advise. 

We always seek to explain the unfamiliar us- 
ing familiar terms. Being unfamiliar with the 
Apple Pascal environment, you quite naturally 
and reasonably want to have it explained in 
terms of a system you understand, namely, Ap- 
plesoft. You need a Pascal to Applesoft dic- 
tionary, which neither Apple nor The Pascal 
Path provides. I do recall, however, seeing one 
Pascal for Basic programmers book during my 
last visit to the bookstore. Check the sources for 
computer books in your area to see what's 
available, and good luck! 

I'd like to issue a word of warning, though, 
to any experts in Basic who want to learn Pas- 
cal. You never become fluent in a foreign lan- 
guage as long as you persist in mentally translat- 
ing between it and your mother tongue. This 
also holds true for programming languages. To 
use any language most effectively, you must first 
see problems and solutions in ways amenable to 
expression in that language. In other words, you 
must think in Basic, or think in Pascal, to take 
fullest advantage of either. 

On the other hand, experienced Basic pro- 
grammers often remark on the neatness and 
clarity of Basic written with a "Pascal accent," 
while Pascal programmers easily recognize (and 
grimace at) Pascal programs written by those 
who customarily work with Basic. Similarly, I 
enjoy hearing English spoken with a French ac- 
cent (even if the grammar isn't always perfect), 
while the French find it appalling to hear their 
language "butchered" by Americans. 

In any case, the task of learning a new pro- 
gramming language is made more difficult by 
any preconceptions (or misconceptions) that 
you bring with you from your experiences with 
other languages. For instance, why should Pas- 
cal include special output instructions tailored 
for the PRINTER: (such as Applesoft's Lprint) 
when regular, file-oriented I/O is equal to the 
task? For those with a background in Basic, I 
caution you to explore thoroughly the motiva- 
tions and history behind a Pascal construct or 
feature before forming your opinion of it. As I 
try to show in my column, there is a reason. 



usually quite persuasive, for every Pascal fea- 
ture (or lack of one).

Positive and Negative Overflow 

This is a modified version of "Short Work of a 
Short Routine" from September Open Discus- 
sion. It places a minus sign immediately before 
a dollar-formatted number, when needed, in a 
field of length L. If overflow occurs, the string 
V$ is filled with **♦*, except for the leftmost 
character position which either remains blank 
for positive or contains a minus sign for nega- 
tive overflows. In line 61010, Kis checked both 
for length and magnitude; without the latter 
check, an incorrect cents value could result for 
very large (exponential-format) numbers. With- 
out the length check, the most significant fig- 
ures in a dollar amount could be omitted. Line 
61005 should be included to guard against near- 
zero numbers in exponential format, which may 
result from a prior computation of V. 

61000 V$ = " ":IF V<0 THEN 
V$ = "-":V = ABS{V) 

61005 IF V<.005 THEN V = 0 

61010 IF V>9999899 OR V>10A(L-4) 
THEN V$=V$ + RIGHT$ 
("*** 1):RETURN 

61020 V$ = RIGHT$(" " + 

V$+STR$(INT(V+.005)) + ","+ 
RIGHT$(STR$(INT((V4- 100)* 
100 + .5)),2),L):RETURN 

To illustrate the subroutine's use, try this: 



10 L=10 : X= (expression) 

61000 
15 P$=V$ 

20 L=15 : Y= (expression) 

61000 
25 P$ = P$+V$ 
30 L=12 : Z= (expression) 

61000 ij. 
35 P$ = P$+V$ fkf 
40 PRINT P$ 
45 GOTO 10 V 



V = X:GOSUB 



V = Y:GOSUB 



: V = Z:GOSUB 



If the expressions used to compute X, Y, and Z 
yield reasonable dollar figures, the example 
print should be three properly aligned columns. 
Just for fun, try using the expression 
X=-IE5+IE7*(RND(I))a6 to get some really 
interesting results!

1 wish to say a few more things on the subject of 
mod. I noticed very early in using Applesoft that 
it was lacking the mod function that can be quite 
useful. Mod stands for modulo and that is a 
mathematical term for number systems where 
the remainder is used to represent a number. 
Generally, it is only defined in integer number 
systems. To illustrate the idea, consider that 
numbers like 47, 157, and 37 have something in 
common. That is, the right-hand digit is the 
same. A way to show this is to drop all multi- 
ples of 10, which is the base, of course. The num- 
ber 157 is really 10x10x1 + 10x5 + 1. Drop- 
ping multiples of 10 leaves 7. We say that 157 =

7 modulo 10. Similarly Al = 1 modulo 10 and 
31 = 7 modulo 10. The three numbers are said 
to be congruent using the base 10. You might 
recall from plane geometry that congruent fig- 
ures are identical in side length and angles. In 
other words, they are identical. Using modular 
arithmetic we might say that if X = 157 and Y 
= 47 that X = Y (modulo 10). 

Modulo can use any number as a base. Us- 
ing a base of 6, we might say that 8 is con- 
gruent or "equal" to 2. This is because remov- 
ing multiples of 6 leaves 2 in either case. We can 
also add multiples of 6 to prove congruency. 
For instance, -4 -I- 6 = 2. So -4 is congruent 
to 8 and 2 also. 

Now let us try to do the same operation in 



Applesoft. We want to remove multiples of the 
base, so we might say: 

MODNUM = NUM - INT(NUM/BASE) * 
BASE 

The int function finds how many times base di- 
vides into num without exceeding it. We would 
like to use a function like: 

DEF FN MOD(N,B) = N - INT(N/B) * B 

Unfortunately, Applesoft only allows one pa- 
rameter so we have to specify the base. We 
should also only use two-letter names to avoid 
confusing them: 

100 DEF FN M6(N) = N - INT(N/6) * 6 




500 
600 



110 Y = FN M6(10) 
120 PRINT "Y = "Y 

Running this program produces Y = 4. This is 
the modulo 6 value of 10. 

I find the modulo function useful for wrap)- 
around phenomena. Suppose we want to print 
a set of sixty-two characters on a line of twenty- 
six columns. We could specify the x location to 
use by the character number modulo 26 (line 
length). Here is the program: 

100 C$="ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU 
VWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 
0123456789" 
200 FOR I = 0 TO 61 
300 X = I - INT (1/26) * 26 
400 Y = INT (1/26) 

HTAB X + 1 : VTAB Y + 1 
PRINT MID$(C$,I + 1,1) 
700 NEXT I 

If the MOD function were available, statement 
300 would be: 

300 X = I MOD 26 

Pascal has a function in addition to mod 
which is an integer divide called div. If that were 
available in Applesoft, statement 400 would be: 

400 Y = I DIV 26 

The modulo function always uses a zero origin 
starting point. The HTAB, VTAB, and MIDS 
functions all use a unit origin which causes the 
"+ 1" in those cases. 

The modulo function is also used to calcu- 
late the low order byte of a computer address, 
namely, address modulo 256. Another applica- 
tion area is in error correcting code theory. 
Modulo 2 (which is equivalent to exclusive-or) is 
the fundamental operation.

Mystery of the Meddling Monitor 

I am a high school student who enjoys pro- 
gramming with several of my friends on the Ap- 
ples we have at school. Recently we encoun- 
tered an interesting phenomenon that other 
readers of Open Discussion might help us ex- 
plain. 

We had two disk drives placed on top of an 
Apple II Plus with a green phosphorous NEC 
monitor sitting on top of the drives. Everything 
worked fine until one day some of our disks 
failed to boot. The drives would just whirl 
around indefinitely, never managing to find 
anything on the disks. At first we thought the 
problem was that the disks were old, but some 
of the new disks did the same thing, while others 
worked just fine. 

Next we figured that the drives might be 
faulty, so our instructor decided to check the 
cards in them. While checking the cards he set 
the monitor aside. Nothing appeared wrong 
with the cards so he tried to boot the disks

again, this time while the monitor remained sit- 
ting where he had placed it, beside the drives. 
Now they booted just fine. Apparently either 
the magnetic field produced by the monitor 
screen or just the weight of it pushing down on 
top of the drives was responsible for the 
problem. 

I have never heard of a situation such as 
this. Does anyone have a more perfect explana- 
tion of the cause? 
Tony Raney, Ozark, MO 

Oversight Uncovered 

I would like to make a comment regarding 
what I feel is an oversight by the manufacturers 
of the Apple. When one buys a typewriter from 
IBM, one of the standard items that goes along 
with it is a dust cover. That piece of machinery, 
up until a few years ago, was totally mechani- 
cal. If IBM thought it was important enough to 
cover a mechanical device from dust, I am sure 
it is just as important, if not more so, for the 
Apple to be protected from Mother Nature. 
Stephen P. Bobko, Honolulu, HI 

Switch of Allegiance 

At first I did not side with those who felt that 
you should be publishing critical software re- 
views. This was because we were not paying for 
the magazine, and your first duty was to your 
advertisers. Now that your readers are charged 
for a subscription, it is as much your duty to 



steer us away from inferior software as it is to 
inform us of high-quality software, 
David Temkin, Highland Park, NJ 

Boldface Lettering 

Open Discussion is my favorite section of 
Softalk. However, I do have one criticism. Each 
month an increasing number of letters refer to 
letters from previous issues. At the present rate, 
in six months no new material will appear — 
only a constant rehashing of old ideas. 

I question printing any letter which argues 
that a previous letter should not have been 
printed. This is a common theme. Doesn't the 
second letter merely provide an additional 
reference point to the first? In the early months 
of Softalk, there was much discussion about 
what constituted appropriate advertising. Now 
I see letters asking that letters referring to the 
advertising not be printed. Finally, there is my 
own metaletter asking that these letters refer- 
ring to the earlier letters not be printed. 

Perhaps you will consider this letter to be a 
member of the class of letters that best not be 
printed. Would it help if I dared you to print 
this? 

Bob Wiseman, Cincinnati, OH 

Sour Grapes, or Rather, Potatoes 

There is a reason I have written this letter on 
yellow lined paper from a pad rather than on a 
word processor. The reason is simple as well as 



sad. It is also the reason I am writing to Open 
Discussion. 

Yes, I have an Apple II Plus, 48K, disk 
drive, and all. Yes, it works all right. Yes, I 
know how to use it. The trouble is, "it" and I 
don't get along. I'm stingy, and "it" always 
needs just one more accessory to do the re- 
quired job. All the marvelous things it does best 
are of no use to me. 

Gripe number one: I just don't like the dis- 
play of program hstings as I'm typing them. 
They are too close together, making them hard 
to read. It's even worse when they come back 
from a list command. 

Gripe number two: There is no decent way 
to edit while programming; using I-J-K-M is 
just too cumbersome. Now don't tell me to buy 
something — I can't read the listing anyway. 

Gripe number three: The keyboard feels 
gritty and there's no numeric keypad. Yes, I 
know what the response will be, but they're 
really nicer right next to the keyboard. 

Actually, I do admire the audacity of the 
makers of the wormy thing. It does sell soft- 
ware, doesn't it? I'll never understand who has 
the patience to key in those programs. I would 
really appreciate any comforting words from 
some kind soul who can make me understand 
why they make the machine the way they do, or 
some suggestions that don't cost upward of 
$300. I remain frustrated in Idaho.

NOVEMBER 1982 



THE BASIC 




One of the most versatile features of the 
Apple is the hi- res display. Yet it wasn't until a 
bit more than a year ago that the Apple's hi-res 
capability was used in commercial software to 
simulate seventy columns of text. The machine 
language character generators in some of these 
programs have reached such a state of sophisti- 
cation that the simulated text acts exactly as you 
would expect real text to behave. Once again, 
we will set out to prove that what the profes- 
sionals do in machine language, we can do in 
Basic, just more slowly. This month's program 
allows you to print in seventy columns on the 
hi-res screen. 

Why seventy? With hardware modifica- 
tions, you can get eighty columns. Well, the 
number wasn't arrived at arbitrarily. The hi-res 
screen can display 280 points of light, called 
pixels, from left to right. Two hundred and 
eighty divided by seventy is four. This means 
that at seventy columns we have a width of four 
pixels in which to display each character. Be- 
cause we have to leave a space between charac- 
ters so they won't run together, this leaves us 
with characters three pixels wide. You just can't 
make them any smaller. 

The routine is designed for efficiency and 
adaptability. It should be easy to adapt for use 
with your own programs; that's why it is struc- 
tured as it is. The section at the end, starting 
with line 10000, is the first part to be run. It 
merely sets up an array, C$(X), and stores the 
data for creating the characters in it. This rou- 
tine is at the end because it's used only once. 

Each character is three pixels wide and five 
pixels high. Another way to put that — one that 
better describes how the actual plotting in this 
program works — is that each character is com- 
posed of five rows of three pixels each. Since 
each pixel can be only black or white, that 
means that there are eight possibilities for each 
row, as shown in figure 1. 



By Wm.V R.Smith 



. . . = 0 

• .* = 1 

.*. = 2 
•** = 3 

♦ . ■ = 4 

* ■ * = 5 
** ■ = 6 

★ = 7 

■ - black dot 
* - white dot 



Figure 1 . 



Now perhaps you can see how these eight 
possible rows can be combined to create a char- 
acter. Figure 2 shows how the letter A is cre- 
ated. 



. *■ = 2 

★ ■ ★ = 5 
★** = 7 

★ • ★ = 5 
*•* = 5 



Figure 2. 



Each row of three pixels is a three digit bi- 
nary number; the digits to the right in the fig- 
ures are the decimal equivalents. Put five rows 
of decimal equivalents together and you get a 
code from which the program can reconstruct a 
character. An A is created from the code 25755. 
That's how all the numbers in the data state- 
ments at the end of the program were deter- 
mined. Each represents one character. You 
should be able to modify this character set to 
your own special uses; for instance, foreign al- 
phabets, lower case, or graphics characters. 

The program works in steps that break the 
job down to its component parts and perform 
them sequentially. Lines 1000 through 1020 
accept input from the user, put it into 0$, then 
send it to the output routine. These lines are 
separated from the others because if you use the 
routine from your own programs you won't 
need this input section. 

Lines 400 through 510 take the string in 0$ 



and break it into individual characters. The pro- 
gram then translates each character into an 
ASCII code, puts the value into the variable C, 
and sends it to the routine starting at line 300. 

The routine in lines 300 through 390 deter- 
mines where a character goes on the screen, 
looks up the character in the array C$(X), and 
determines from the code how each of the five 
rows should look. Then it puts the number code 
for each row into PL and sends it to the row 
plotter in line 100. 

Lines 100 through 260 plot a single row of 
three dots based on the number in the variable 
PL. Though this is the last step in the process, it 
appears first in the program because it's used 
most often. This may seem to confuse the issue, 
but it speeds things up a bit. 

A possible use for printing simulated text 
characters on the hi-res screen is to label hi-res 
artwork or graphs. Whatever your use, you just 
have to put the string into 0$ and gosub to line 
400. If you want to change the way the pro- 
gram determines where on the screen to put it, 
the variables X 1 and Yl in hnes 3 10 and 340 de- 
termine the screen coordinates. If you don't 
want the routine to clear the rest of the line (this 
feature can destroy parts of anything you might 
be labeling), the section that does that begins at 
line 470. 

Happy computing!

I Software 
Publishing 




In the Front File, 
Personally 




BV JOnATUAn tllLLER 

About two months after Software Publishing Corporation launched 
its first product, general manager Janelle Bedke received a disturbing 
call. It was from a dealer who'd bought PFS — the Personal Filing System, 
program — and apocalyptically pronounced it too simple. He was typical 
of the breed at the time, a disguised hobbyist who delighted in intri- 
cacies. To him, a program wasn't a program unless it had all those bells 
and whistles. Yet a week after his first call, the guy was back on the blow- 
er, only this time with a grudging admission. 

"It's deceptively simple," the dealer conceded. "When I got in and 
used it, it was exactly what I wanted." 

Says Bedke of the first call, offering a story postscript with a "more is 
less" moral, "I knew he wasn't right. I was running our entire company 
on that program. Order forms, checking accounts, equipment pur- 
chases. Most programmers then were proud to have more features. We 
were proud to have less." 

The dealer's about-face made one of Bedke's twelve-hour days in 
November 1980, when she was Software's only full-time employee. She 
was directing operations single-handedly from the proverbial Silicon Val- 
ley garage, while partners Fred Gibbons and John D. Page held on to 
jobs at Hewlett-Packard. Years of software experience had gone into de- 



signing the company's deceptively simple product, and the effort was al- 
ready paying off. Orders, which were a respectable garage-size 70 the first 
month, jumped to 159 by October. Then, in November, Bedke — man- 
ual writer, boxes stuffer, and all-purpose gopher — ^received orders for 500 
more PFS packages. Software had a winner, all right, and Bedke 
couldn't help but savor the delicious frustration. She'd temporarily run 
out of product. 

Since Software's auspicious launching, in September 1980, the cor- 
poration has been writing its own Silicon Valley success saga. One mil- 
lion in sales (and an unheard of profit) the first year in business, four mil- 
lion the second — the recession notwithstanding — and a projected nine 
million in fiscal 1983. The company has been so successful that venture 
capitalists were courting them six months after launching. With their 
product a hit and their more-is-less philosophy vindicated, the trio of 
Bedke, Gibbons, and Page was at the crossroads. To expand or not to 
expand, that was the question. Recalls Gibbons, "We just sat around one 
day and looked at each other and said, 'Now what do we do?' " 

What they could have done was go with the flow. They could have 
paid themselves comfortable salaries and waited in leisure for John Page 
to write his next program. Or, as wind-surfer and pilot Gibbons phrases 
it, they could go for all the marbles. They could take the plunge — ar- 
ranging for a $250,000 transfusion from Jack Melchor Venture Manage- 
ment of Los Altos and hiring their first employees. 



"We felt that the timing was positive," Gibbons explains. "We had 
the ideas, we had the product, and we just wanted to be in the market- 
place." 

Software wants to be in the market in a big way. They're working to 
become a household word among first-time computer users looking for a 
simple package of office and professional programs priced around $100. 
To judge by the second-year numbers, the trio is gaining on that man- 
agement objective. A cumulative total of one hundred thousand units 
sold; three programs— Pfi', PFS.Report, and PFS.Graph— in Softalk's 
top ten business management systems; and plans to introduce a fourth 
PFS, an easy-to-use word processor, sometime in the first half of 1983. 
Staffing is scheduled nearly to double, from thirty-nine to sixty-five, by 
next September. Additional plans call for some fme-tuning of the adver- 
tising, greater penetration of European markets (now 10 percent of 
SPC's sales), and, perhaps most important, the release of PFS programs 
compatible with two other popular machines, the IBM Personal Com- 
puter and the TRS-80. 

Gibbons takes pains to stress that the expansion to other computers 
implies no disrespect to Apple. "We have a tremendous loyalty to Ap- 
ple; they're still the leader," he says. It's just that a company, especially 
one with a growing number of shareholders, is obliged to leverage its in- 
vestments. Which is Gibbons's diplomatic way of saying you don't want 
to put all your eggs in one basket, not in a market as volatile as 



The management trio from Software Publishing Corporation has 
reason to smile. They've parlayed a good idea for a packaged series 
of easy-to-use office management programs into a $4 million-a-year 
business. The principals in this Silicon Valley success saga are, from 
left to right, Fred Gibbons, president; Janelle Bedke, general 
manager; and programming guru John D. Page, software 
development manager. 



computers. 

"You make 90 percent of your investment doing the first implemen- 
tation of a program," programmer John Page points out. "With the 
other 10 percent of the effort you can put it on two or three more ma- 
chines and double or triple your sales." 

This shift in emphasis will be reflected in Software's new ad cam- 
paign. The sell is softer, even tutorial; the approach conceptual rather 
than product-oriented. The campaign targets Software's principal mar- 
ket, typically the inexperienced user and self-employed professional. The 
intent, says SPC, is to reach the potential purchaser a step earlier in the 
buying cycle with ads that zero in on why he needs a computer as much 
as why he needs PFS. 

"Two years ago, when we started, this was a technologically 
knowledgeable marketplace," explains Gibbons. 'Today, the market is 
much less computer literate. We want to take a leadership role in help- 
ing educate these people."

A science fiction niglitmare by David Mutiich. 




The task of putting a 
charting program on the 
charts fell to Bessie 
Chin, co-author and 
project manager of 
research and 
development for 
PFS: Graph. 



Keeping It Simple. To appeal to that market, according to the Soft- 
ware trio, you have to demystify the computer. When the powerful 
WordStar system hit the retail outlets a couple of years ago, the typical 
untutored purchaser blamed himself, not the program, when he found it 
too complicated to use. Today, the buyer blames the system — and right- 
ly so in Page's view. 

"The hardest thing to do in programming is to know what to leave 
out. A programmer's path of least resistance has always been creeping 
elegance and it has to be stamped out. It's easy to figure what to put in. 
You can think of an infuriating number of little gizmos and options that 
have some conceivable use, but pretty soon the program's incomprehen- 
sible and loses all consistency." 

Software's commitment to consistency and simplicity is rooted in the 
varied experiences of its management team. They've been able to build a 
better program family, they say, because they understand all aspects of 
the computer business — from the hardware to the software to the mar- 
keting. In the case of Gibbons, a Harvard MBA, resident cheerleader, 
and founding father, the Software idea took hold when he was develop- 
ing vertical business packages for Hewlett-Packard minicomputers 
in 1979. 

"The work was interesting enough," Gibbons recalls. "We wrote the 
programs, but the difficulty was that we had to train people on what is 
accounting. It was very support and service intensive." 

Down the hall from him at this time was John Page. He was having 
similar misgivings about the state of the software art. A transferee from 
Hewlett-Packard's London, England, division, he was plugging away de- 
signing software for data management systems on the H-P 3000 mini- 
computer yet felt it wasn't really getting the job done as it should. For 
one thing, Hewlett-Packard couldn't recruit enough people into data 
processing who knew enough about computers. 

"Computers had stagnated in the early 1960s in their complexity of 
use, but they were proliferating all over the place. People in data proc- 
essing departments didn't know what was going on with these machines. 
And then when Fred came along, it sort of crystalized my ideas about de- 
signing easy-to-use software." 

It had been Gibbons's initial plan to get outside authors to develop 
the product with SPC publishing programs for a royalty — hence the 
Software Publishing name. But his encounter with Page suggested an- 
other approach, and he found himself musing aloud about how great it 
would be if someone did a filing system for the self-employed profes- 
sional. That thought ultimately became PFS, the first in the packaged se- 
ries of integrated products designed, engineered, manufactured, and mar- 
keted by Software. 

To design for an Apple you first had to have one, so Gibbons went to 
the source. "I talked with Steve Jobs (cofounder of Apple). He was en- 
couraging and arranged to give us equipment at a store discount." For 
the next eight months. Page labored by day and created by night, fine- 
tuning the PFS program. Shortly after launching. Gibbons realized SPC 
couldn't be run on the fly. He needed an experienced hand at the helm 
and it so happened that Bedke, another Hewlett-Packard alumnus, was

available. After eleven years at H-P, she had decided in November of 
1979 that she was ready for a new career direction. Fred made her an of- 
fer the Godfather might have refused, but it was just the opportunity she 
was looking for. 

"When I called her up, I asked how would you like to do this for stock 
in the company and no pay," says Gibbons, laughing. "And she says, 
'But what do I have to do?' 'Everything,' I said. 'Write the manual, stuff 
the boxes, negotiate with Apple, be the gopher, and work with and paci- 
fy John.' " 

Bedke worked closely with Page because she wrote the manual as he 
developed the program. That collaboration has become a metaphor for 
what the company perceives as the key to its success: a few ideas well 
thought out, to borrow the cadences of the U.S. Marines ad. 

"I remember when we were doing the manual," Bedke recalls. "I'd 



go back to John and say, 'I can't write this, it's too complicated. I can't 
write it so I can read it.' And he'd say, 'Yeah, maybe you're right,' and 
alter the program." Adds Page, "If you can't explain it, it's not right. We 
take the position that the manual is as important as the program itself." 

The Acid Test. One of the ways he tests a program feature, says 
Page, is to explain it to somebody else. If he can't do that in a few choice 
words, can't do it without rendering his hominoid guinea pig senseless, 
it's not that he explained it badly, just that he designed it wrong. 

Creative give-and-take stamps all interdisciplinary relations at Soft- 
ware, says the management trio. The operative premise is simple enough. 
In mass product design, a few good heads are better than one. So it fol- 
lows as no surprise that Software products are developed by four-mem- 
ber teams consisting of a program director, manual writer, marketing 
person, and manufacturing manager. 

"We don't tell people how to do their jobs," says Gibbons. "After all, 
we hire them to be creative. What we do expect is that those who sign on 
be committed to our management objective — developing easy-to-use 
products for the low end of the package software market." 

The bottom line, of course, is quality control. When you design, 
manufacture, and market your own product, you necessarily have more 
of it. According to Gibbons, Software is the only company at its level of 
success that engineers its own products. 

"VisiCorp didn't, Microsoft didn't, MicroPro didn't, and Digital 
Research didn't," he says excitedly, "so we have been the only company 
that took an integrated engineering and marketing approach right from 
the beginning." Software further enhances its product control through 
in-house manufacture — assembling the disk, manual, and boxes right on 
the premises, in its airy new office complex (sixty-eight hundred square 
feet, upstairs and down) on Landings Drive in Mountain View, Cali- 
fornia. 

Such organization, unique for a small company, characterizes the 
trio's professional approach to management. The implied message: 
We're steady and dependable, just like those nearby Moffet Field pilots 
who bank their prop-engine P3 sub watchers right over Landings Drive,

regular as clockwork. The right stuff and all that. They keep their cool, in 
short, which is why they managed to avoid the common mistake of re- 
leasing a program too soon. They stuck to their basic plan, which, to 
summon the Marines once again, has been to produce a few good pro- 
grams. That has meant devoting more time to planning and to regular 
product-team meetings and resisting temptations to jump into other

bons's favorite words, stayed focused. "We approached that like we would 
the picking of a partner," says Gibbons. Software considered three of- 
fers, finally deciding on the Melchor group for two powerful reasons — 
their offering price on Software stock and their management experience 
should the trio seek their advice (which they gladly do). In point of fact, 
SPC has actually raised two rounds of venture capital — the quarter mil- 
lion in April 1 98 1 and another million a year later. Underwriting the sec- 
ond round was the Melchor Group, New Enterprise Associates of San 
Francisco, Crown Associates of New York, and the investment banking 
firm of L. F. Rothschild, Unterberg, and Towbin. The SPC partners de- 
liberately sought second-round financing from other geographic re- 
gions, explains Bedke, because the company distributes nationally and 
hopes one day — she can't say when — to go public. 

In any event, if a man be judged by the company he keeps and a busi- 
nessman by his investors. Software is in very good company indeed. 
Owning a piece of their rock are some of the valley's brighter lumi- 
naries — Bob Noyce, president of Intel; Les Hogan of Fairchild Indus- 
tries; and Ken Oshman of Rolm Corporation. "We're the star in their 
portfolios," Gibbons gloats. While these investors are obviously looking 
for a good return, he says, he feels their support is inspired by a larger 
motive. What these investors really want, says Gibbons, is to see the 
computer industry grow, and what more promising field of green could 
there be than an up-and-coming company in the burgeoning software in- 
dustry? "They want to be among the people planting seeds back in the 
ground and continuing the technological revolution." 

Job Satisfaction. On a day-to-day basis, it's doubtful that Bedke, 
Gibbons, and Page see themselves as technological crusaders, but it's evi- 
dent that the trio is very pleased with their accomplishments — as indi- 
viduals and as a company. His commitment to writing the first PFS pro- 
gram, for example, put John Page straight into what he wanted from 
his work. 

"My heart was in building stuff. I like creating things, particularly 
things that turn out to be useful for a lot of people. When you can build a 
company the way you think it should be run, build a product the way 
you think it should be built, and then see them get the kind of accep- 
tance that we have . . . well, it's kind of addictive. It's a ball, really. The 
highs you get out of it far outweigh the problems." 

The problems, such as they are, have been little ones, the normal 
pains that come with growth. Like seemingly endless conferences and 
personnel interviews, getting carpet for the atrium stairway, forcing your- 
self to take a Hawaiian or Virgin Island vacation (as they did), and deal- 
ing with the Great Unknown. The latter refers in part to a squadron of 
high-flying bees that no one has ever seen but that has been leaving drop- 
pings on cars in the parking lot. In a huge corporation like Hewlett-Pack- 
ard such matters are handled by unseen people in personnel and build- 
ing maintenance, but when you run your own show, the buck begins and 
ends with you. There are times. Page reflects, when it seems like every- 
thing's going to fly apart, that they're losing control. But then, he adds, 
that uncertainty forms an integral part of the fun and excitement that is 
building your own company. "It's a ball, really." 

And what of Software's future in the brave new computer world, a 
world that will see Macy's and Sears peddling product along with Com- 
puteriand? "Excellent," says Gibbons. Software Publishing Corpora- 
tion is ideally positioned to grow with the mass consumer market, he 
believes. 

"We're a safe buy. We don't let the customer fail and I think the deal- 
ers are getting that. If the dealer has a problem, we'll step right up there." 

Three years ago, when software products were in short supply, shelf 
space wasn't a problem, contends Gibbons. A new product could win 
credibility and generate enough cash to underwrite an enhancement 
cycle. Today, the individual author is competing against firms like Soft- 
ware, VisiCorp, and Microsoft, all of which are producing integrated 
program families. They're building a name as well as a product. 

Ultimately, Software would like to assume a leadership position 
among this select group. 

"I find that we're in the lucky situation of having found our niche," 
observes Gibbons. "Sometimes those niches close up because the giant 
comes in and squashes you, but in our industry there are no giants. No- 
body's going to squash us."

□ Aftermath. Two months after the Us Festi- 
val, the dust has finally settled in Devore, Cali- 
fornia. The helicopters and RVs have gone 
away. The freeway is wide-open and free. 

Not to be overly dramatic, the spirit of the 
festival lives on and is spreading around the 
world. Soon the Us Network will be opera- 
tional and the spirit will travel farther and 
faster. 

Just what is the Us Network? During the 
Labor Day festival it was a two-way video link- 
up with the Soviet Union. Festivalgoers saw a 
traveloguelike short about Moscow one night 
and live scenes from a Moscow radio station the 
next night. The latter consisted of three hun- 
dred Soviets gathered on a sound stage dancing 
to the music of Soviet group Stas. 

The video feed from the Us Festival was fea- 
tured one evening on the Soviet Union's only 
major television station, Bremja. Generally a 
news and educational medium, Bremja features 
three minutes of cultural offerings every night. 
The broadcast from the Us Festival was given 
the whole three minutes and was seen by ap- 
proximately 150 million Soviets. 

"It was a big event in the Soviet Union. Un- 



heard of," said a Unuson spokesperson. "This 
was the first demonstration of the Us Net- 
work's capabilities for interactive communica- 
tion." 

The full scope of Wozniak and Unuson's in- 
tentions with the Us Network is staggering. In 
the years to come, universities, colleges, high 
schools, and special computer centers around 
the world are projected to be linked together 
with the help of computers and space-age tech- 
nology. 

Using a Westar satellite, educational pro- 
gramming, future Us Festival concerts, lec- 
tures, and conferences could be downloaded to 
many different locations. At first the system will 
consist mainly of straight video networking and 
will be targeted at universities and colleges. 

A likely scenario runs something like this: 
Bigtown State contracts out a network system, 
with the initial cost falling on Unuson. Bigtown 
is expected to pay back its debt with profits 
earned from charging admission to broadcasts 
of future Us Festivals. The system would also 
be used for sending and receiving educational 
programming and other services, like news. 

Currently, Unuson is talking to a dozen uni-

versities on how best to set up this kind of sys- 
tem. Once a firm video network is established, 
personal computers will enter the scene to make 
the system more interactive. Even individual 
homes may someday become part of the Us 
Network. 

The idea is to create a broader sense of com- 
munity and be able to share human resources 
better than before. It's the feeling of Wozniak 
and Unuson that science and art together can 
help unite people and improve our worldly 
situation. 

One additional advantage will be not al- 
ways having to rely on the telephone system for 
long-distance interactive communication. The 
use of satellite technology should greatly en- 
hance the viability of the Us Network. 

There may be another Us Festival at the 
same location in Devore as early as Easter 1983. 
Regardless, the Us Network should be around 
for a long time and benefit an ever increasing 
number of people. 

□ Touch-Tone Therapist. At the Veterans 
Administration Medical Center in Birming- 
ham, Alabama, the burden of follow-up care 
for the speech, language, and hearing impaired 
has been lightened a little bit — electronically. 
Since therapy clinicians can't make house calls, 
it was necessary to invent a computerized ver- 
sion of one that did. Its name is Remate (re- 
mote machine-assisted treatment and evalua- 
tion), the brainchild of Dr. Gwenyth Vaughn, 
audiologist and speech pathologist at the medi- 
cal center. 

What Remate does is call patients via Touch- 
Tone phone. It asks the patients if they are ready 
in a recorded voice. If a patient is, the lessons 
begin. This telephonic therapy (as Dr. Vaughn 
has nicknamed it) doesn't replace traditional 
face-to-face drill work with a clinician; it's de- 
signed to complement it. 

Remate can provide drill work in several 
areas. 

In speech therapy, words and phrases are re- 
peated by the patient and then played back for 
him to hear, using the patient's own voice. 

An attachment called the Telewriter permits 
handwriting tests, and the handwriting is 
modem-translated for analysis. 

For stroke therapy, a patient is asked four to 
six questions with a measured response time. 
Remate can recognize whether the answer is 
right or wrong. 

Traveling for long-distance therapy can be 
expensive and exhausting — both physically and 
emotionally. Three factors figure into a veteran 
getting quality therapeutic follow-up care; park- 
ing, weather, and travel, according to Dr. 
Vaughn. 

"The average visit is 175 miles round trip 
per patient, and most of them try and come for 
daily care. The cost to travel averages forty-two 
cents a mile these days. Remate can save a pa- 
tient about five thousand dollars a year and 
provide him with care as good as face to face. 
In fact, it's identical." 

And it's vastly less expensive for the medi- 
cal center as well without sacrificing the quality 
of the therapy. "We can save five million dol- 



NOVEMBER 1982 



65 



lars for every thousand patients over a six- 
month period. That's for two sessions a week of 
drill work per patient." 

The Remate system is a combination of mi- 
CTOS and mainframes that work together to 
make Touch-Tone therapy seem easy. Hardware 
configurations were designed by Dr. Thomas 
Donald, who set up the "black box" housing 
the line interfaces connecting the various ma- 
chines. John Kramer, computer specialist with 
the medical center, is the man who keeps it all 
up and running. 

"The medical center has twelve Motorola 
68000 micros that do all the talking, typing, 
writing, and dialing," Kramer explains. "Each 
one can handle twelve phone lines at a time. 
They're not set up yet for automatic dialing — 
the software hasn't been written — so the calls 
are made manually at the moment. 

"Four Motorolas are each connected to 
three PT 1 1 /22s over high-speed channels. They 
have operating systems that can handle multi- 
ple tasks. These machines hold the programs 
currently being used. 

"The central computer is a PDP 1144. It 
handles all the evaluation and research as well 
as the scheduling. It has a catalog of about 
thirty programs, or lessons, for clinicians to 
choose from. Remate is only in its infancy — the 
PDP is set up to hold a thousand different 
lessons." 

The prize piece of equipment in the Remate 
system is the TEL-plus, a Touch-Tone telqjhone 
with a device that lights up when buttons are 
pushed next to pictures or words. This is espe- 
cially useful wiien treating stroke victims with 
aphasia, a condition characterized by under- 
standing and comprehension within the brain 
but no discernible way to communicate it. 

For the last three years. Dr. Vaughn and her 
crew of computer specialists have been wres- 
tling with getting Remate set up. "We kept hav- 
ing to get things approved, approved, and ap- 
proved," she explains. Funding was handled by 
the Veterans Administration Rehabilitation 
Research Department, set up to support re- 
search, do reviews, and award projects. "We 
just got an award to go another three years," she 
notes. 

"We're going to study the telephonic sys- 
tem versus face-to-face care. This is called effi- 
cacy testing. It's a crucial undertaking, since no 
actual data exists at the moment. We're confi- 
dent about Remate here at the medical center, 
but we're going to have to prove the system 
really works." 

To date, some eight thousand patients have 
benefited from clinician-assisted telephonic 
therapy. Remate can handle many more. As 
Dr. Vaughn says, "We're aiming for a nation- 
wide VA service network for speech and hear- 
ing impaired persons. Remate could be en- 
larged at a very small cost." Right now, several 
Veterans Hospitals across the country are set up 
to call in and schedule their own local therapy 
using Remate. 

"One person can monitor all the input right 
now," Kramer explains. "But it's hectic in a 
crunch, I'll tell you." And he's the one who 



would know — but it looks like Remate can han- 
dle the load. 

□ Customized Taxes. A controversial bill that 
exempts custom computer programs from a 6 
percent state sales tax has been signed into law 
by California Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. 

Industry sources say the legislation, the first 
of its kind nationally, could have pace-setting 
implications given California's traditional lead- 
ership role in technology and lawmaking. The 
measure, which was pushed by a fledgling soft- 
ware group that felt it was being victimized by a 
tax-strapped State Board of Equalization, up- 
holds the industry's longstanding view that cus- 
tomized programs are one-time services which 
are not subject to the sales tax. 

The California bill only applies to custom- 
ized computer programs that are developed 
primarily for mainframes. It does not affect 
mass-produced, commercial software pro- 
grams sold for personal computers. The latter 
will continue to be taxed as tangible personal 
property, as they are in most states. 

The new measure was lobbied through the 
California legislature by a coalition of compa- 
nies under the banner of the Software Services 
Association. Paul Connolly, a member of the 
group and the vice president and general man- 
ager of Informatics of Palo Alto, said they had 
sought legislative relief as a defense against the 
policies of the State Board of Equalization. In 
the past year, he says, the board slapped scores 
of software developers — some of whom weren't 
even aware of the policy's existence — with as- 



sessments for unpaid sales taxes going back 
from three to eight years. One firm received a 
back- tax bill of $285,000, he says. 

The association appealed to the legislature, 
according to Connolly, because there was no ef- 
fective administrative remedy. Assessment ap- 
peals are not heard by an independent review 
authority, he says, but by the board itself. State 
law does permit a company to sue the board in 
civil court, Connolly adds, but only after 
they've gone through the appeal process and 
paid the disputed taxes. By that time, many 
companies could have wound up out of 
business. 

The bill became a hot political issue this past 
summer when a member of the board labeled 
the legislation a hundred million dollar special 
interest tax break for "some of the most af- 
fluent members of our society." Industry 
sources ridiculed the figures of William M. 
Bennett, claiming he was confusing sales with 
taxes. Connolly says it's doubtful that annual 
statewide sales of custom programs total $100 
million, and only a portion of that would be 
subject to tax anyway under the board's inter- 
pretation of the regulations. "This is not a tax 
break," he declares. "Sales taxes are paid by the 
customers. All the companies do is collect the 
monies and pass them on." 

One provision of the bill does provide a spe- 
cial, one-time tax consideration, however. J. D. 
Dotson, head of the board's business tax de- 
partment, characterized as "very unusual" a 
condition refunding $1.2 million in previously

paid sales taxes to custom program purchasers. 
The rationale behind the refund, Dotson ex- 
plains, was that the taxes should never have 
been levied in the first place, because custom- 
designed programs are a service not subject to 
taxation. 

Dotson, whose department furnished Ben- 
nett with his $100 million tax-loss figures, still 
believes that the board and his department were 
correct in their interpretation of the regula- 
tions. "Any manufactured article has a lot of la- 
bor and service involved," he says, "but the ul- 
timate thing that the customer uses is a piece of 
tangible personal property — a machine-read- 
able program." 

According to Dotson, his department had 
been following this interpretation since 1975 
when the board adopted it as official policy. 
During that time it had been enforced "equally 
and fairly," in line with the availability of audit 
staffs. In the last couple of years, however, at 
least according to Connolly, the enforcement 
has become more aggressive. Did this suggest, 
as some in the industry have speculated, that a 
money-strapped state government was casting 
about for additional revenue sources? Not by 
Dotson's lights. ' 'There's no truth to the charge 
that we did it to raise money." 

And now, as if to mock the notion, they 
have to give some of it back. 

□ May the Source Be with You. A portrait of 
the average videotex user emerges from the 1982 
subscribers survey taken by the Source. The re- 
sults indicate that the average user of the elec- 
tronic information and communication service 
is forty-two, three years older than last year's 
average. 

Eileen Friend, marketing research director 
for the Reader's Digest Association, owners of 
the Source, says that the data gathered by the 
survey suggests "a more serious approach to 
videotex services" and rebuts the theory that 
personal computing is only a hobby for young 
people. 

"Twenty percent of subscribers now use the 
Source most often from their place of work. 
Fifty-three percent say they spend at least half 
their time on the Source for either their pri- 
mary or their secondary occupations." 

Subscribers this year tended to form net- 
works with each other, and twice as many as the 
year before contacted the Source on a daily 
basis. The highest occupational jjercentage was 
among professionals (doctors, lawyers, CPAs). 

The eight-page questionnaire was distrib- 
uted to four thousand randomly selected sub- 
scribers on May 16 and achieved a 39.9 percent 
response rate before the June 20 stop date. 

□ Crossing Borders. Shycon Associates has 
been in the business of computer logistical 
models for twenty years. Their latest, Logistek- 
Europe, is a financial model of the European 
continent as a unified system. 

The model figures transportation costs be- 
tween countries, warehousing costs, inventory 
costs, currency exchange rates, raw material im- 
ports, transfer pricing, taxes, and other factors; 
then sets up a what-if scenario to allow com- 
panies to try different strategies for satisfying 



market requirements at the lowest total cost. 

Company presidait Harvey Shycon refers to 
the model as a "hybrid structural simulator/ 
optimizer. It attacks a previously impenetrable 
area of corporate fat: inefficient manufacture 
and distribution operations caused by national 
boundaries." The end result is the elimination 
of guesswork from inventory, distribution, and 
transportation decisions and identification of 
different levels of customer service for the crea- 
tion of a specific customized business strategy. 
□ The Bank Shot. The banking business is feel- 
ing the impact of the personal computer revolu- 
tion — seven years before it thought it would. 
According to the report Consumer Electronic 
Banking, j ust issued by International Resource 
Development, a specialized management con- 
sulting and market research firm, the personal 
computer has made home banking a reality far 
in advance of the predictions of retail banking 
experts. 

"Small and medium-size banks have been 
cozily assuming that bank-at-home wouldn't 
become really important until videotex systems 
became widespread — perhaps around 1990," 
says IRD study project manager Cari Frankel. 
"Now they see 1983 as the year in which they 
may lose all their remaining profitable cus- 
tomers, having already lost many big earners to 
Merrill Lynch in 1981 and 1982." Merrill 
Lynch, along with American Express and other 
"financial supermarkets," now offers various 
telebanking services to the consumer that com- 
pete with traditional bank offerings. 

The past two years have seen an overwhelm- 
ingly positive response from consumers to the 
conveniences of paying bills, switching deposits, 
and performing other fiscal chores in the pri- 
vacy of their own homes. "The average upper- 
income banking customer," says Frankel, 
"hates standing in line." 

The manufacturers of specialty terminals like 
Micro Peripherals's Bank Box or Chase Man- 
hattan's Telecredit Paymatic are hkely to feel 
the effects most acutely as their market con- 
tinues to erode before the advance of the home 
computer. Of the three milhon personal com- 
puters that will be in place by the end of 1983, 
about two million of them will be in the hands 
of individual consumers, says IRD. Frankel de- 
scribes the specialty terminal manufacturers as 
"sucking their teeth" as they watch the per- 
sonal computer wave engulf many of their 
projected markets. 

Additional direct impact of home computers 
on banking in the near future will result 
in fewer tellers and smaller buildings, which will 
result in turn in a major reconfiguration of tra- 
ditional bank investment policy. "As early as 
1987," Frankel predicts, "the banking industry 
may become a net seller, rather than a net 
buyer, of top retail exposure real estate." 

Having grasped the fact that the families buy- 
ing home computers are the same families that 
have long provided the deposit base for com- 
mercial banking, Chemical Bank now has a per- 
sonal computer telebanking service, "and soon 
Citi, Chase, BankAmerica, and other biggies 
will be sweeping into the market." 3M

Where is the Apple III clock? 

The program is done, 

But the chip won't run, 

Hickory Dickory Dock, Turn Turn. 

Considering that Apple III made its first public appearance less than 
two years ago, it's amazing how far the machine's development has 
come. The 96K Apple III is gone; the 256K machine is common. A 
second-generation operating system, SOS 1.1, has been distributed to all 
users, and even that has been further upgraded. Extensive revisions of 
Utilities, Business Basic, and the Apple II Emulator are in the hands of 
every registered owner. And all early models of Apple III have been 
recalled and exchanged to eliminate the disastrous problem of chips 
working loose in their sockets (an exchange program possibly unique in 
modern manufacturing, not just computers). In fact, Apple III is 
definitely "up and running" with major new programs and applications 
appearing all the time. Just one dangling, unfulfilled promise remains: 
the Apple III clock. 

Ticks and Bugs. The great clock flap began with the earliest adver- 
tisements announcing Apple III. The machine was to have its own in- 
ternal real-time clock with battery back-up. The exact time and date 
would be available instantly to all programs, and the machine would 
automatically stamp each file with the date and time of creation and 
modification. A really neat feature, and a big selling point whose appeal 
in our time-pressured society far exceeds any practical value that might 
actually be realized. After all, you don't really need the clock, but it 
is . . . neat. 

Then — disaster. After months of waiting, the first Apple Ills were 
shipped. They crashed, repeatedly, with "System Failure" plastered 
across the screen. The chips wouldn't stay in their sockets. Immediately 
Apple began exchanging defective machines for new ones, no questions 
asked. But word of the problems spread quickly. And to top it all off, the 
clock didn't work. And wouldn't work. Nothing could be done. The 
available clock chips were no good and there was no other source. One 
can imagine the frustration and rage at Apple Computer. Geologists 
doubtless believed Cupertino was having earthquakes. Finally Apple 
simply withdrew the clock from its specifications. The clock was no 
longer part of Apple III, and if you paid for one they sent you a fifty 
dollar rebate. 

So it was over, right? The clock was gone, right? Not on your life. The 
clock is gone only from the ads. At position B3 on the motherboard of 
every Apple III is an empty chip holder neatly labeled "58167." And over 
on the other edge is a nice round hole labeled "batt." The circuits are all 
there. And the access routines are also there, in SOS, the Sophisticated 
Operating System. When, eventually, you get the clock and the battery, 
you can just plug them in and you'll be in business. The clock is far from 
dead. It's merely in suspended animation, awaiting more fertile times. 

By a strange coincidence National Semiconductor recently an- 
nounced the MM58167A real-time clock chip for less than fifteen dollars 
in May 1982. If you buy one of these chips and stick it in that empty chip 
holder (orient it the same way as its neighbors) it works just fine. 

For intrepid tinkerers, the battery hole on the motherboard is "pos" 
on the bottom and is marked "-" on top. Three penlight batteries in a 
holder from Radio Shack will give you 4.5 volts,which is just about right. 
By placing the battery holder up front next to the speaker you can get to 
it easily should the batteries ever need to be replaced. You should then 
connect a couple of longish wires to the battery site on the motherboard. 
Apple warns that major permanent changes to the computer may jeopar- 
dize the warranty, so we don't recommend that you solder these wires. It

is rumored that this is the approach Apple will take when it finally makes 
an "insert" package available. 

A Variety of Clocks. Just so we are all talking about the same thing, 
there are a number of different clocks associated with Apple III. So far 
we have been discussing the functioning clock chip MM58167A, but there 
are several others. We shall try to keep them straight as we go along. One 
such clock, for example, is the 6502 CPU clock, which, in Apple III, runs 
at around 1.8 MHz. This clock governs operation of the 6502 processor. 
It is very important to the computer, but it has nothing to do with 
keeping track of dates and times-of-day. We shall not refer to it again. 

Another clock is the "system time and date." If you have an Apple 
III without a functioning clock chip (as all Apple Ills are currently de- 
livered), you still have a "system clock." But it isn't really a clock at all, 
merely a set of numbers in memory. You may set these numbers to any 
time and date you wish, and that becomes the official time and date for 
the operating system. These values are then used to mark the time on 
files and are accessible to programs through the system's access routines. 
If you don't have the MM58167A chip, then these remembered num- 
bers are the system clock. 

Of Time and Space. The system time and date values are held in a 
very special part of memory. Apple Ill's memory is much too large for all 
of it to be handled directly by the 6502 CPU chip. Instead, various 32K 
banks of memory are switched in and out, two at a time, so that the 6502 
always has exactly 64K bytes of memory to play with. Any other quanti- 
ty would make it very unhappy. One bank, the "s" (system) bank, is 
almost always on-line. It holds SOS, which monopolizes memory loca- 
tions BCOO to FFFF. We are talking now about RAM memory, which is 
volatile and is lost when the power is turned off Every time you boot the 
machine, SOS is reloaded into this section of RAM from the file 
SOS. Kernel on the boot disk. Whatever was previously stored in that 
RAM is overwritten and lost. You start again with a clean slate. 

But there is one small area of the system bank that is normally 
not RAM at all. This is a thirty-two byte stretch from FFDO to FFEF. 
Apple III has two 6522 Versatile Interface Adapter chips, or VIAs for 
short. These are "helper" chips that handle intake and output and are 
deeply involved in the complexities of bank switching by which Apple I II 
manipulates its huge memory. Each VIA is allocated sixteen memory lo- 
cations for its access ports. So when the 6502 CPU addresses locations 
FFDO to FFEF it gets these VIA ports. The section of ordinary RAM 
memory that otherwise would lie in this area is normally switched off- 
line and can be reached only by a special technique known as 8F ex- 
tended addressing. It turns out that this special area of RAM, being off- 
line, is not overwritten during a boot. In that sense it is protected, and it 
is, in fact, the only area of Apple Ill's memory that can be counted on 
to retain information through a reboot. So that is where they put the sys- 
tem clock. Once set, the system clock will retain its values through suc- 
cessive (control-reset) bootstraps until the values are deliberately changed 
or the power is cut. 

As Time Goes By. When you insert the MM58167A chip, the sys- 
tem clock is instantly transformed into a real, ticking clock. Now, when 
you set the clock, you set both the functioning clock chip and the time 
and date values in protected RAM. The time and date values serve as a 
back-up for the clock chip. They hold the last known valid time should 
the clock chip later be found defective. 

SOS provides two access procedures for communicating with the sys- 
tem clock. Both are SOS calls. They are named set time and get time. 
SOS calls are machine language commands that execute various subrou- 
tines in the operating system. There are some thirty-five different SOS 
calls and they perform a wide variety of complicated tasks. You should 
think of them as new 6502 op-codes. SOS calls may be used directly from 
any assembly language functions or procedures you may write. High- 
level languages, such as Basic and Pascal, also define commands for 
talking to the system clock. But when these high-level commands are exe- 
cuted, their code paths must always flow through the common pathway 
of these two SOS calls. 

The set time SOS call accepts information in the form of an eighteen 
byte sequence of ASCII digits that contains the time and date informa- 
tion. Set time always attempts to set the hardware clock, the MM58167A 
chip, whether it exists or not. And it also stores the information in pro- 



tected RAM as just discussed. 

Get time first attempts to read the clock chip. If there is no opera- 
tional clock chip then get time retrieves the last valid time and date from 
its storage area in protected RAM. And finally, if there is no valid time 
and date in RAM, then get time returns a string of eighteen ASCII zeros. 

Since all languages and application programs always access the sys- 
tem clock through these two SOS calls, it follows that all programs writ- 
ten in those languages will continue to work in the same fashion whether 
there is a functioning clock chip or not. If there is a functioning chip, you 
get a current time and date. If not, you get the time and date values 
stored in RAM. But you don't have to make any changes in your pro- 
grams when you install the chip. You just start receiving more up-to-the- 
minute information. This is an excellent example of Apple Ill's ability to 
cope with upgrades of both hardware and software while continuing to 
support programs already in use. 

Using the System Clock. Some application programs such as Apple 
Writer HI have special commands with which you may set the sys- 
tem clock (that is, the functioning chip and/or the time and date mem- 
ory values). The computer then uses the current values to time stamp files 
whenever you save your work to disk. This can be a great help in keep- 
ing track of files. The time stamp is displayed with the file name when- 
ever you catalog a disk. 

Programs written in Apple III Basic can read the time and date 
values very easily. Although it doesn't say so in the current Basic man- 
ual, DateS and TimeS are reserved variables. DateS returns the date in 
the format yy/mm/dd, and TimeS returns the time as hh:mm:ss. These 
are read-only variables. If you attempt to assign a new value to one of 
these variables you get zapped with a syntax error. Reading the system 
clock from Basic is easy, but setting it is considerably more complicated. 

One way to set the system clock from Basic is with the Basic pro- 
gram Timeset which comes on the Business Basic disk. Timeset displays 
the current clock values and accepts changes. Any new values are then 
transferred as parameters to a subroutine in the Timeset.Inv invokable 
module. Invokable modules are machine language procedures, and this 
one is particularly simple. It pops the specified values off the stack and

stores them in an output buffer. Then it issues a set time SOS call and the 
job is done. 

The program Timeset is a separate, independent, Basic program. It 
works very nicely but you cannot (easily) use it from the middle of some 
other program. Oh yes, it can be done, in a roundabout way, using exec 
files or by chaining from one program to another. But that's messy. The 
intention seems to be that you will use Timeset to set the system clock 
when you first turn on the machine and then read those values as needed 
from any programs you may subsequently run. 

Planned Obsolescence in the Year 2000. If you want to set the sys- 
tem clock from your own Basic programs you can invoke the Time- 
set.Inv module yourself Unfortunately there is no available documenta- 
tion for using the module except what you can ferret out by listing and 
studying the Timeset program. Briefly, what is required is a set of inte- 
gers, each of which specifies one digit of the time stamp. In this case 
eleven digits must be specified. They are sent to the invokable module as 
parameters of the external procedure Timset (no "e"). The digits are yy 
mm dd w hh mm, which in your program you might store as the eleven 
integer variables Yl%, Y2%, Ml%, M2%, Dl%, D2%, D3%, Hl%, H2%, 
MI1%, and MI2%. SOS always sets the century value to 19. You don't 
get to change that. Also, this invokable module will not accept values for 
the seconds. They will be assigned (X). 

Notice that w is stored in D3%. W is a value between 1 and 7 that 
represents the day of the week, where Sunday is 1. The Timeset Basic 
program actually calculates this value from the year, month, and day us- 
ing a formula known as Zeller's Congruence. But you really don't need 
to do this. Just assign any value in the appropriate range whether it's cor- 
rect or not. Something must be sent, but the particular value chosen is ig- 
nored by the subsequent set time SOS call. The SOS routines prefer to 
calculate the correct value for themselves. 

When you have input or otherwise assigned all these integers, you 
send them to the Timeset.Inv module, and thence to SOS, by the com- 
mand 

100 PERFORM TIMSET (%Y1% * 256 + Y2%, %M1% * 256 + M2%, 
%D1% * 256 + D2%, %D3%, %H1% * 256 + H2%, %MI1% * 256 
+ MI2%) 

Giving Pascal the Time of Day. Pascal has two separate schemes 
for setting and reading the system clock. One is for use in programs; the 
other is a command in the Pascal Filer. The Filer date command is acti- 
vated by pressing D. It displays the current time and date and accepts 
changes. The Filer date command is unique in that it not only sets the 
clock chip (if there is one) and the time stamp in protected RAM, it also 
stores the date in the file System. Miscinfo on the Pascal System Disk. 
This disk time stamp is then available should you later boot Pascal and 
the system is unable to find either a functioning clock or a valid time and 
date in protected RAM. Only the date is stored on disk; not the time. The 
date is reduced to two bytes by an ingenious coding system and is stored 
at bytes 002E and 002F of System. Miscinfo. Expressed as hexadecimal 
nibbles, these two bytes are DMYY where M := $month; D . = $day 
MOD $10; and YY := (Syear *2)+ ($day DIVSW). In other words, the 
year value is doubled and then summed with the carry-from day. If the 
result is an odd number, you know that D := D + $10. 

From within Pascal programs all communication with the system 
clock is performed by four procedures in the Applestufl" Library Unit. 
They are Date, Timeofday, Clockinfo, and Settime. The Date and Time- 
ofday procedures each take a string variable parameter. They each re- 
turn an ASCII string, yyyymmdd or hhmmss, respectively. Clockinfo 
takes eight integer parameters and returns integer values for year, mon, 
day, dayofwk, hr, min, sec, and thou. Finally, to set the system clock 
from a Pascal program, there is Settime (T), where T is a string variable 
of eighteen ASCII characters. The string must be in the format 
yyyymmddwhhnnssuuu, which is exactly the same format used by the set 
time SOS call. This last procedure, Settime (T), is similar to the Time- 
set.Inv invokable module used in Basic. It accepts the parameters, does 
some range checking, and issues a set time SOS call. Once again, the w 
value and the uuu millisecond values must be sent but need not be accu- 
rate. The SOS call ignores them. 

Even More Clocks! If you are not content with the system clock you 



can buy several others. One popular external clock is the Thunderclock, 
made by Thunderware, Inc. This is a completely independent clock on a 
peripheral card. It has its own battery back-up and fits in one of the ex- 
pansion slots in Apple III. The Thunderclock is actually designed for Ap- 
ple II but will also work in Apple III if you know how to set it up. Un- 
fortunately, the Apple III documentation that is available is a bit 
sketchy. 

Whenever you buy a new device for Apple III you must not only 
plug in the device, you must also install the device driver that comes with 
it. Apple dealerships distribute a disk containing the necessary driver for 
using Thunderclock in Apple III. A driver is a program. It is written es- 
pecially for one particular device, and it acts as an intermediary between 
SOS and that device. SOS sends the driver a read or a write request and 
the driver then translates that request into the special requirements of 
that one device for which the driver was written. 

A new driver must always be placed within the collection of other 
drivers on the boot disk. The entire collection is kept in the file 
SOS.Driver. You must use the System Configuration Program on the 
Utilities disk to add your new driver to SOS.Driver. Complete instruc- 
tions begin on page 5 of the Standard Device Drivers Manual. It is very 
important, when installing the Thunderclock driver, to specify a slot as- 
signment. This tells the driver where you have put the Thunderclock 
card. You also have an opportunity at this time to review and perhaps 
change the device name. Every device (driver) has a name. It is essen- 
tially a file name except that it begins with a period. The Thunderclock 
driver is generally called .tclock, but with the System Configuration Pro- 
gram you can change the name to anything you wish. All that really mat- 
ters is that whatever name you choose, it must be the name your pro- 
gram uses when it wants to talk to the Thunderclock. If your program 
uses any other name, SOS will be all at loose ends and will zap you with a 
device not available error. 

The What's-Its-Name Driver. It is this confusion over device 
names that has caused much grief and confusion for people trying to 
make Thunderclock work in an Apple III. The System Configuration 
Program is confusing enough to Apple III beginners, but, to compound 
the problem, the people who put together the Thunderclock Driver disk 
made a rather distressing error. They used two different names for the 
driver. 

On the Thunderclock Driver disk is a file called Tclock.Code. This 
file contains the new driver, and in this version the driver's name is 
.tclock. In this version also, the slot number is unassigned. Tclock.Code 
is the file you are expected to use when you add the Thunderclock driver 
to the various SOS.Driver files on your own boot disks. Using the Sys- 
tem Configuration Program, you read in the old SOS.Driver file from one 
of your boot disks. Then read in the new driver from Tclock.Code, 
assign whichever slot holds your Thunderclock, and "Generate a New 
System." The new SOS.Driver file thus created is then written back onto 
the boot disk you started with. That disk now holds the Thunderclock 
driver and, once that altered disk is booted, your programs can access the 
Thunderclock by means of the name .tclock. 

So far, so good. But at this point somebody decided that the disk con- 
taining the new Thunderclock driver, which Apple would distribute, 
should also be a boot disk, and further that this boot disk should con- 
tain a demo program that could be used to set the Thunderclock. The 
idea was good. The execution leaves something to be desired. 

In order for the demo disk to be a boot disk it must, of course, con- 
tain all the usual SOS files required of all boot disks. And it does. It is, in 
fact, a copy of Business Basic. And, to the SOS.Driver file of this boot 
disk, they added the new Thunderclock driver. Naturally, in a working 
boot disk, the slot assignment must actually be assigned. So they 
assigned slot 2. And that is why the demo boot disk will work if your 
Thunderclock is actually in slot 2, and otherwise it will not. 

The Reckless Driver. If your Thunderclock is in one of the other 
slots you could, of course, fire up the System Configuration Program and 
change the slot assignment in the Thunderclock driver, in the SOS.Driver 
file, on the demo boot disk. But that's asking quite a lot of a total Apple 
III novice who has not yet attained the level of familiarity with drivers 
that you, gentle reader, now possess. Worse yet, if the demo program 
cannot find the Thunderclock (perhaps because it is not in slot 2), it

doesn't say so. The program just fails. The error message refers to a bad 
subscript. What has happened is that the program has tried to read 
Thunderclock and assign the time stamp to a string variable. If there is 
no clock, the string variable ends up with meaningless and illegal values. 
Then the program tries to use these values as subscripts for indexing an 
array. This works great if the string contains a valid time stamp from 
Thunderclock. But an illegal value gives a bad subscript error to the pro- 
gram and heartburn to the user. So the slot assignment problem is likely 
to be a source of grief. One cannot really blame the creators of the disk 
for requiring slot 2. After all, they did have to assign some slot number, 
and it might as well be that one. But they could, rather easily, have ar- 
ranged for a more informative error message should an error occur. 

Unfortunately, there's even worse to come. Through some inexplic- 
able lapse of judgment, when the Thunderclock driver was placed in 
SOS. Driver on the demo disk, they also changed its name to .clock. 
There is no reason whatever for this inconsistency; it is simply an error. 
Since the machine now expects all references to the Thunderclock to use 
the name .clock, that is also the name used in the demo program. So the 
demo program will run only on the demo disk. If you have placed . /c/ocA: 
driver on some other Basic disk, then the demo program won't run on 
the second disk. There is a conflict of names. 

Since, by Murphy's Law, the worst possible disaster is bound to oc- 
cur, we have the most unfortunate victims of all. These are the people 
who have vCTy carefully added .tclock driver to the SOS.Driver file on the 
demo disk. Now there is universal confusion of names and nothing runs 
except rampant frustration. 

If you have successfully threaded your way through these mine fields 
your Thunderclock will work. Most of the time. There are, however, 
some rumors of erratic performance. And indeed, upon careful disas- 
sembly of the driver code file it is apparent that an error was missed by 
the writers. In one subroutine, instead of sending to the clock the hexa- 
decimal value SOO, the error sends the contents of zero-page location $20. 
Usually the contents of zero-page location $20 do happen to be $00, but 
presumably they are not always so. This could well be a source of inter- 
mittent and unpredictable failure. But we hasten to add that we have 
used our Thunderclock with that same driver for many months and have 
never, so far as we know, encountered any problem with this bug. 

Using Thunderclock is somewhat different from using the system 
clock, and perhaps a bit easier. You just treat it like any other file. From 
Basic you use the same commands you would use for talking to a text file 
on disk. First the file must be opened. Information is then transferred by 
the usual print and input commands. The following program segment 
reads eleven ASCII digits from Thunderclock and places them in the 
string variable T$. 

200 OPEN #1, ".TCLOCK" 1$ 
210 INPUT #1 ; T$ 

T$ now contains Thunderclock's time stamp in the format 
mmddwhhnnss. Note that Thunderclock neither stores nor supplies a 
value for the year. 

Setting Thunderclock is equally easy. You put the information in T$, 
in the same format, and execute: 

300 PRINT #1 ; T$ 

Of course the set /protect switch on the Thunderclock card must be in the 
set position or nothing will happen. 

The Good Old Days. The only snag is that with Thunderclock you 
are expected to provide an accurate value for w, the day of the week. This 
calculation requires a figure for the year, which Thunderclock doesn't 
store. To perform the calculation you can either lift Zeller's Congruence 
from the Basic program Timeset, or you can simply run the date infor- 
mation into the system clock and then read it back out again. SOS will 
have calculated w for you. Note that in Apple III the Thunderclock value 
for w ranges from 1 to 7, with Sunday being 1, just as it does in the sys- 
tem clock. This is different from Thunderclock's output in Apple II, 
where w ranges from 0 to 6, with Sunday being 0. 

Pascal also uses standard file commands to talk with Thunderclock. 
The input file should be of the type "interactive." After appropriate 
variable declarations execute: 



reset (clockfile, "TCLOCK"); 
readin (clockfile, timestring); 

The string variable Timestring now contains Thunderclock's time stamp. 
Setting Thunderclock is done with: 

writein (clockfile, timestring); 

which writes the contents of Timestring back out to Thunderclock. 

If you have ever used Thunderclock in Apple II you will find many 
differences when you use it in Apple III. The Thunderclock has a rather 
complicated Apple II program stored in a ROM chip right on the Thun- 
derclock card. When you talk to Thunderclock from Apple II you get the 
full benefit of information processing provided by this private program. 
So you can do a lot of things. Unfortunately, the ROM chip subroutines 
are specific for Apple II. They send output data directly to Apple II's in- 
put buffer at memory location $0200. There is no such animal in Apple 
III. So few, if any, of the ROM chip subroutines can be used in Apple 
III. All the tricky things that the ROM chip is supposed to do must in- 
stead be done by the .tclock driver. 

Well, some of Thunderclock's abilities were put in the driver, and 
some were not. It's largely a question of economics and deadlines. The 
Apple III market at that time wasn't nearly as big as it is now, and writ- 
ing a more complicated driver would have been expensive. There was no- 
body to pay for it. There were not enough Apple Ills around to antici- 
pate a huge sales volume, and there was no additional charge for the Ap- 
ple III driver program when you bought a Thunderclock. Furthermore, 
a more complicated driver would take longer to write and debug, with re- 
sulting delays in distribution to the public. So they opted for a minimal 
driver. You can read Thunderclock and write to it. And that's about all. 
There is only one format for the time stamp instead of the variable for- 
mat you get in Apple II. And you cannot use the BSR/X-10 interface. 
Nor can you use any of Thunderclock's interrupt facilities. None of these 
things is supported by the current driver. It is not the fault of Apple III. 
The limitations are in the driver program. To our certain knowledge, at 
least two programmers have written drivers for their own private use 
that fully support Thunderclock's interrupts. So it can be done. 

Perhaps the worst problem with this minimal driver is the lack of 
adequate documentation for its use. The three pages of mimeographed 
material that are available presuppose considerable familiarity with the 
Apple III operating system. They are probably incomprehensible to most 
Apple III novices. And with Apple III novices we must include the Ap- 
ple dealers. Until very recently, few dealers have possessed sufficient 
depth of knowledge about Apple III to cope with previously undocu- 
mented problems. Unfortunately, the setup problems and driver limita- 
tions have generated so many hostile letters that the folks at Thunder- 
ware appear to have lost all enthusiasm for another effort. It's a pity. 

According to a spokesman for Thunderware, the adaptation of 
Thunderclock to the Apple III was actually instigated and carried out by 
Apple. Apple apparently wrote and distributed the driver to assist Apple 
III owners who were devastated by the missing system clock. The ensu- 
ing problems, of course, all descended on the people at Thunderware, 
who think of themselves as innocent bystanders. 

A word about Apple II emulation mode. There is not, hiding within 
Apple III, a miniature Apple II just waiting to emerge. The machines are 
totally different. What the emulator does is create, within Apple III, a 
virtual Apple II that exists only in a shadowland of swirling electrons. 
So it is absolutely uncanny how exactly the image is drawn. For most 
purposes the machine becomes an Apple II, right down to the arrange- 
ment of the keyboard. But it's not perfect. There are limitations, and one 
of those limitations is no interrupts. In emulation mode the Thunder- 
clock is back in its natural home. It works perfectly, until you try to use 
interrupts. The Thunderclock sends its interrupt, but the computer isn't 
listening. This is not true in Apple III native mode where interrupts from 
the slots are fully supported, provided you have an appropriately written 
driver. 

If you have a Thunderclock for your Apple III, what can you do with 
it? Well, you can read it and use the information in any program you 
may write. It does have a battery back-up and it does keep modestly ac- 
curate time. You can use it in any programs that require the time or date, 
such as a check writer. But perhaps the most important use for the Thun-

You're not alone, you know. 

We've all been through that same excru- 
ciating moment when we realized that we were 
going to have to learn a lot more than we wanted 
to know about programming, in self-defense. 

But most of us survived. 

Many of us with a little bit of help called 
dBASE II, the relational database management 
system (DBMS) for micros. 

The best defense is a strong offense. 

Don't get seduced by BASIC, because 
basically BASIC is weak. And to make it do 
anything useful can take 10 times as much 
programming (and time) as with dBASE II. 

dBASE II is much easier because it's a 
relational DBMS, and you control your informa- 
tion with powerful, English-like commands. 

With a word or two, you CREATE data- 
bases, APPEND new data, UPDATE, MODIFY 
and REPLACE fields, records and entire data- 
bases. DISPLAY some or all of your data for 
any conditions you want to apply. Organize 
months worth of data in minutes with REPORT. 

You can prepare your forms and formats 
precisely the way you want them. Do calcula- 
tions on fields, records and entire databases 
with 10-place accuracy. 

And do even more with dozens of other 
commands. 

Here's the catch. 

With any language, you'll need to under- 
stand relational operators ("less than" "greater 
than;' "equals") and a bit of logic ("or!' "and!' "not"). 

With dBASE II, you'll also get an easy 
way to make choices (IF. .THEN.. ELSE) and a 
powerful way to perform repetitive tasks 
(DO WHILE..). 




With these tools, you're ready to tackle 
your accounting and time billing, project man- 
agement, and any other data handling and record 
keeping. You can work interactively and get your 
answers right now. Or save your instructions and 
repeat everything with two words: DO Man- 
hours, DO ProjectX, DO whatever has to be done. 

Use dBASE II to help make your choice. 

If you've got a 48k CP/M micro with a 
disk drive (96k IBM PC), send us $700 ($400 
for a 56k Apple). We'll send you a copy of 
dBASE II to use free for 30 days. 




Instead of just poring over a manual, run 
it and make certain that dBASE II does what you 
need done. 

Then if you find it isn't right for you, 
send it back and we'll return your money, no 
questions asked. 

But we know that you'll probably keep it. 

Because having dBASE II is like having 
a black belt in micros.

derclock is setting the Apple III system clock. Then you have a proper 
time stamp on all your files, and that really is nice. 

If you have the MM58167A chip in your Apple III, but no battery, 
then the Thunderclock is still a handy time source each time you power- 
up your computer. Once properly set, the system clock chip will, of 
course, go on keeping time as long as power is applied. 

On this line of reasoning it would seem that once you have acquired 
both the MM58167A chip and a battery back-up for Apple III, you 
would then have no further use for Thunderclock. This may not be 
entirely true. For one thing, you might reasonably hope that someday 
you will get a driver that supports interrupts, if you have a particular pas- 
sion for interrupts. Perhaps you may wish to write one yourself. It's a 
pleasant challenge of rational proportions. 

Where Does the Time Go? More important, there is the question of 
timekeeping accuracy. Neither Thunderclock nor the MM58167A chip is 
likely to win any awards for surpassing accuracy. The Thunderclock is 
susceptible to changes in environmental temperature, although this has 
not been a problem for us. Our Apple III seldom gets turned off! Even 
so, it is nothing like a quartz watch. We have not yet succeeded in ob- 
taining accuracy specifications for the MM58167A chip; nor do we know 
what nefarious influences may prey upon it. But we do know that the 
two MM58167A chips we have tried each lose several seconds a day in 
Apple III. 

It would seem then that you aren't going to get a terribly accurate 
clock either way. But at least the Thunderclock is adjustable. You can 
jimmy the rate control occasionally and, with some patience, get it timed 
fairly well. So you may just prefer to continue setting your MM58167A 
chip from the Thunderclock, from time to time, rather than soldering 
that battery into the Apple III motherboard. 

The accompanying program is designed to do just that. It sets the sys- 
tem clock from the Thunderclock every time you reboot. It is, however, a 
strange sort of program. It is a driver. A single-purpose driver called 
. update (unless, of course, you rename it). It works as follows: Using the 
System Configuration Program on the Utilities disk you place Update in 
the SOS.Driver file of any or all of your boot disks. Any, that is, that also 
contain .tclock driver. When you boot the disk the drivers are read into 
operating system memory. During boot, SOS sends each driver an ini- 
tialization command. This gives each driver an opportunity to set up its 
device, load arrays, and generally do whatever needs to be done before it 
is ready to face the big world and your programs. 

When Update gets its initialization command it queues an event. This 
means that it notifies SOS that there is a program segment to be run at 
the end of boot, before SOS turns control over to the user's programs. So 
when SOS has finished the boot it checks the Event Queue and finds 
Update's message. It then branches to the Event Handler which, of 
course, is another little routine embedded in the Update driver code file. 
The Event Handler opens the file . tclock, reads the Thunderclock, and 
immediately sends that information to the system clock with a set time 
SOS call. Then it tidies up its open file and exits. The deed is done. SOS 
turns control over to the interpreter and you are in business. Sounds 
complicated? Maybe so, but it's quick. The system clock is set in a frac- 
tion of a second during an otherwise normal boot, so you never have to 
think about it. Update driver will work in any boot disk and is com- 
pletely independent of the language or application being booted. 

System Prerequisites. Update driver does make some assumptions. 
It assumes, of course, that you actually have a functioning Thunder- 
clock in your Apple III and also that you have installed the Thunder- 
clock driver (properly configured) in the SOS.Driver file on your boot 
disk. The Thunderclock driver and Update driver must both be there. 
Finally, it assumes that the name assigned to your Thunderclock driver is 
.tclock. Update seeks the Thunderclock driver by name, and the only 
name it knows is . tclock. If these conditions are not met, or if any other 
error occurs. Update simply gives up the attempt and does nothing. An 
otherwise normal boot still occurs, but the system clock will not have 
been set. 

Since the system clock requires the year, and Thunderclock doesn't 
have the year, that bit of data is provided by the Update driver. The year 
is stored in Update's configuration block data. It can be changed, as re- 
quired, using the System Configuration Program. Instructions for editing 



configuration block data may be found on page 16 of the Standard De- 
vice Drivers Manual. Only two digits of the year may be changed. SOS 
always requires that the century be 19. 

You don't need to know anything whatever about programming to 
use the Update driver. In fact, you don't actually do anything. Its func- 
tion is entirely automatic. All you have to know is how to get it into 
SOS.Driver using the System Configuration Program, and most dealers 
ought to be able to help you with that. The program is fairly short, par- 
ticulariy if you leave out all the remarks. But you do need Apple III 
Pascal in order to assemble it, unless you know somebody who could be 
persuaded to assemble it for you. It shouldn't take long.

Wright State University seems an unlikely place for Apple comput- 
ers to be making their mark. Named for Orville and Wilbur Wright, 
nearby Dayton's two most famous native sons, the semirural Wright 
State campus sits quietly in the middle of central Ohio's thunderstorm 
country, like a twentieth century Currier and Ives. 

But appearances are deceiving. Underneath it all, Wright State is the 
site of one of the most exciting and advanced computer-aided bioengi- 
neering projects underway today, and Apples are in the thick of it. Here 
Dr. Jerrold S. Petrofsky, associate professor of biomedical engineering 
and physiology, is using computerized muscle stimulation to make it pos- 
sible for people paralyzed by spinal cord injury to ride bicycles and, even- 
tually, to walk again. 

The study of physical handicaps isn't new here. The college has one 
of the most modern campuses in the Ohio State University system, and 
wheelchair access is designed into the plant. During the winter, an un- 



derground tunnel system makes it possible for wheelchair-bound students 
to avoid slush altogether, all of which has attracted to Wright State a 
large population of physically limited students. 

Petrofsky's story goes back more than fifteen years to his undergrad- 
uate days at Washington University in Saint Louis, where he transferred 
after a year at Missouri School of Mining and Metallurgy. It was at 
Washington University that Petrofsky developed his passion for 
computers. 

"While I was getting my undergraduate degree, I needed money, so 
in my junior and senior years I worked part-time as the electronics techni- 
cian for Saint Louis University School of Medicine's department of 
physiology. And two days a week I worked on their computer system, 
adding some core memory to it." 

That was a LINC (Laboratory Instrument Computer) system, Pe- 
trofsky recalls, one of the first minicomputers made for medical use, in 
1959, with 1 K of internal memory and magnetic tape with 250K on each 
dual tape drive. 

"If they'd had any sense, they'd have hired somebody who knew 
what he was doing," Petrofsky chuckles. "But in 1967, who knew what 
he was doing? There just wasn't such a thing as a computer engineering 
degree or a computer engineer — it was all people from other fields trying

A Dream of 



Walking 



Opposite page: With an Apple acting as tlie motor cortex for Inis legs, Wright State University student Jeff Housch pedals an indoor 
stationary training cycle. Housch was the first subject in Petrofsky's earliest computer-controlled leg extension tests. 



to make computers work. Microprocessors weren't even invented for an- 
other five years." 

He stayed at Saint Louis University to get his Ph.D. in physiology 
with a minor in biomedical engineering at Washington University by 
special arrangement between the two schools. Then, while he was doing 
his postdoctoral work at Saint Louis University, he went to night school 
at Washington University in computer engineering (last May he finally 
finished enough credits to get a bachelor of technology in computer 
engineering). 

Setting His Goals High. About 1969, the young physiologist/ 
computer whiz began to toy with an idea suitable for a science-fiction 
yam. Since electrodes can cause muscle contractions in people with 
spinal cord injury, Petrofsky reasoned, and since computers can simu- 
late central nervous system activity, then it should be possible to use 
computers to bypass the spinal injury and enable paraplegics and quadn- 
plegics to use their muscles again. And Petrofsky isn't timid: the goal was 
walking. 

"I looked at the basic problem logically. The muscles are like a motor 
in your body, and when you've been paralyzed, let's say, from the neck 
down, your brain keeps thinking 'move,' but the messages can't make it 
down to the rest of your body. You have a motor down there that's 



healthy, a perfectly functional system. It's just turned off. So how do you 
bring that system back up again without blowing it apart?" 

In 1969, two things were still missing that Petrofsky needed to realize 
his goal. The first was microcomputers, although even then it was obvi- 
ous to anybody working in the field that miniaturization was the wave of 
the future. The second thing missing, however, was something Petrofsky 
could do something about. There was a void in fundamental knowlege of 
using outside electrical stimulation to control coordinated movement. 

Thus began a long period of experiments with cats, first to determine 
how a cat wills itself to walk — the algorithms of cat walking — and then 
to see if a computer could take over the direction of a cat's hind leg. Pe- 
trofsky trained cats to walk on a treadmill in a special leg brace that 
limited them to a simple, manageable range of motion. Electrodes on a 
cat's muscles recorded the impulses from the cat's brain to the leg. Later, 
Petrofsky would play back the stimulation pattern on a denervated or 
anesthetized cat to see if the computer could reproduce a walking 
motion. 

Progress was slow, but the basic research paid off with answers. Still, 
Petrofsky knew that there was a limit to how far animal experiments 
could take him. 

In 1979 he came to Wright State, primarily because of the Universi-

ty's commitment to paralysis research. There his work benefited from as- 
sociation with Chandler Phillips, M.D., associate professor of engineer- 
ing and physiology and a mathematical modeler, and Roger Glaser, 
Ph.D.. a professor of physiology and an expert on wheelchair design and 
exercise physiology in paralytics. 

Then in September 1981, a casual remark of a colleague changed the 
course of Petrofsky's research. At a think tank of paralysis researchers, 
another worker in the field said to Petrofsky that perhaps his research 
had already produced valuable results. Even though he couldn't make 
paraplegics walk yet, he could help them exercise their atrophied mus- 
cles with electrical stimulation. 

Petrofsky immediately saw the advantages. "There were things we 
couldn't get out of animals. Animals are safe. If you screw up an experi- 
ment, you feel bad about it, but with people you've got to be God-awful 
careful, because you sure don't want to injure anybody," Petrofsky says. 

"But there were things we needed to know. We know for a fact that if 
you take a muscle and paralyze it for three months and stimulate it, it'll 
come back, but who knows after ten years or twenty years? Cats don't 
live that long, and I don't have ten years to wait. Nobody else does 
either." 

He realized that he needed a population that had been injured for a 
long time to test muscles' ability to come back again. 

"Obviously, what we're trying to do is to get somebody to walk. 
That's an absolute. But that's really a complex problem. There is an awe- 
some distance between stimulating gross muscle movement in a para- 
lyzed leg and the fine muscle coordination needed for a movement such 
as walking or pedaling," Petrofsky says. 

"One of the things you have to find out is how badly paralyzed is 
paralyzed muscle? If a guy's been in a wheelchair for ten years, can that 
muscle come back to normal strength and endurance? Well, Mike, who's 
on the indoor bike right now, has been paralyzed for eight and a half 
years, and his legs are back to normal strength and size. So apparently 
the answer to that is yes. Nobody knew, because nobody had ever tried 
to train paralyzed muscle to bring it back again. The assumption was, 
'Once in a wheelchair, always in a wheelchair. Why bother?' "

Nan Davis provides the motive power for the outdoor tricycle. The more 
complicated movements required to ride the "Zap Bike," as it is 
affectionately called, are controlled by a Z-80 microprocessor running an 
assembly language program developed by Petrofsky on the Apple. 

The Questioning Begins To Pay Off. As a physiologist, Petrofsky 
saw other questions that had to be answered with human test subjects. 
"Another thing was, even if the muscle's fine, how about the bones? Al- 
so, you're not using your heart that much when you sit in a wheelchair 
for ten years. It's just idling, especially for a quadriplegic. If you put it 
under the stress of walking again, it could cause a heart attack. 

"And we had to find the best way to train muscle to try to get muscle 
to come back. We know for the average guy, if he wants to become a 
weightlifter, the best way to build up strength is to go into a gym and lift 
weights at about 60 percent of his maximum strength, very slowly, doing 
isokinetics. But who knows with muscle that's been sitting in a wheel- 
chair for ten years? Maybe 10 percent of their strength is best; maybe bi- 
cycling is the fastest way. So what's the best mix to bring the muscle 
back, maximizing strength and endurance?" 

In February 1982, Petrofsky was ready to start tests on human sub- 
jects, and the miracles began. Paralyzed student volunteers ("We'll take 
anybody we can get," Petrofsky says with a grin) began to make regular 
trips to the noisy, crowded labs on the second floor of Allyn Hall, where 
Petrofsky and his co-workers chum around in chaotic good humor. The 
place is jammed with micros: Heathkits, Intertecs, TRS-80s, and Ap- 
ples, Apples, Apples. 

A space was cleared in the clutter, and Petrofsky and Harry Hea- 
ton, his technician, built the first strength-training machine ever de- 
signed for paraplegics — a leg extensor chair. When it came to choosing 
the computer that would act as the exerciser's brain, it was no contest. 

"It had to be an Apple II. As far as I'm concerned it's the best value 
for the money that there is on the market," Petrofsky says. "It's an ex- 
tremely fast, sophisticated little machine. I can go to some of the bigger 
systems, the S-100 systems, that cost four to eight times the price, and I'll 
get a little bit higher speed, but that's not worth the price. 

"The Apple's also got a beautiful high-resolution graphics display. 
The other brands don't give as good graphics — block graphics instead of 
single dots. You don't get the resolution that you need. 

"Best of all, it has a built-in bus so I can plug in boards, which I can't 
do with Radio Shack or Pet or some of the other machines. In this proj- 
ect, I've had to build components on cards, and I need places to plug 
them in. I've got direct access to the rest of the bus, and the cards are pre- 
decoded, which is great because I don't have to waste chips on the boards; 
decoding the slot numbers since they have device-select lines set up right 
on the boards." 

But computemiks aren't always totally logical, and Petrofsky's dedi- 
cation to the Apple II has an irrational component. "We've got a little 
TRS-80 in the other lab, and we have chess on both," he says. "One time

Physiologist and computer whiz Dr. Jerrold S. Petrofsky. 

Chan Phillips and I took the outputs and hooked the two computers to-

A New Training Season. With the leg extensor in place and the Ap- 
ple ready to act as a motor cortex, the moment of truth had arrived. The 
first subject was Jeff Housch, a Wright State junior (now a senior) ma- 
joring in economics and philosophy. Electrodes were fixed over the 
stimulus points on Housch's quadriceps, and after Petrofsky fine-tuned 
the delays in the computer program, Housch watched with as much sur- 
prise as the others while his leg extended itself and then relaxed. 

For Housch and the other volunteers, a period of physical training 
started, for now they had become athletes of a new kind. Getting them 
walking remained Petrofsky's ultimate goal, but more realizable inter-

mediate goals were identified first — physical training on the leg extend- 
er, pedaling on an indoor, stationary bicycle, and developing a muscle- 
powered outdoor bike for paraplegics. And each intermediate goal had 
its own special programming challenges for Petrofsky to solve. 

Where programs are just straight loop programming, like the leg 
trainer, Petrofsky uses Applesoft floating-point Basic ("Although it's in 
ROM now, so it's not really a 'soft' anymore," says Petrofsky the purist). 
"And that's what most of the other programs run in, too. Just floating- 
point Basic. The leg trainer runs in Basic because the Apple's fast enough 
to do what I need to do," he says. 

"I use fjeek and poke statements to look at the machine code mem- 
ory locations where I've stored A to D [analog to digital] converters. I do 
my A to D in memory locations off of the peripheral slot, and then 
there's some other circuitry built into the cards for the control systems, 
but aside from that I'm just running it in Basic. It only takes ten to fif- 
teen milliseconds on the outside to code an instruction, and that's plenty 
quick for my purposes." 

With the success of the leg trainer, things were moving quickly, but 
the smooth motion of bicycling is far more complex than simple leg 
straightening. Now the computer needed to stimulate four major muscle 
groups in a cyclic pattern, and it also needed to know the relative posi- 
tion of the feet, hips, and knees at all times. 

"Originally, when the bike was put together, it got its position read- 
ings out of knee and ankle sensors, but then we found that it really 
wasn't necessary. The only thing you need to do is get the position of the 
feet," Petrofsky says. 

"We started with an optical sensor on the bicycle pedals, and it just 
counted spokes when they broke the beam of light. It made a nice little 
sensor. 

"The first time we got it to work just fine, and the university wanted 
to bring a photographer up to take some pictures, because it was the first 
time a quadriplegic had ever pedaled a bike, and everybody was excited. 
We had the guy pedaling and they shot a picture — **foomp** — good- 
bye optical sensor. It bombed out and screwed the whole computer pro- 
gram up, so we dropped optical sensors right there. 

"Now we're using a 360-degree potentiometer, which I think will 
probably be the final way we'll do it. It's hitched to the sprocket wheel so 
that with each rotation you get a rotation of the potentiometer. That's 
all you need; that gives you position, and then the computer program 
handles the rest." 

Growing at a Geometric Rate. Not all Petrofsky's concerns were 
programming problems. "If you take a look at an X ray of someone 
who's been in a wheelchair, the bones are like paper — like somebody 
who's a hundred years old. People in wheelchairs often break their legs if 
they bang them into things," he says. "But we're finding that the bone is 
coming back fairly quickly; still, fairly quickly for the bones means about 
six months, whereas it takes about two months for the muscles to 
come back. 

"So we've got a flag of caution that's thrown up: 'Be very careful 
when you bring the muscles back, because if you bring them back too 
fast, you'll snap the bone.' The muscle comes back two to four times 
faster than the bone." 

Even with all that caution, the group had a protocol-related hairline 
fracture that Petrofsky still finds very strange. 

"We haven't figured it out yet. A normal person's leg extension 
strength might be about seventy-five pounds. Well, we had one of our 
subjects start out with about twelve pounds of leg extension strength, and 
after about two and a half months he was up to ninety pounds. We fig- 
ured, 'Fine, he's going to level ofi".' Because that's at least a little bit 
above normal strength. 

' "Every two weeks we test the subject's strength, so two weeks later 
we tested him, and he broke the meter at one hundred thirty pounds. He 
was just training for thirty minutes a day, three days a week, and with 
that type of workout, he doubled the strength of the average man. His 
bones just weren't ready for that kind of stress, and he got a hairline 
fracture. 

"So, one of the things I'm doing this week is modifying the equip- 
ment so that if strength exceeds a certain limit mechanically the system 
shuts down."

I SOFTAI 1/ 



NOVEMBER 1982 



Despite this setback, the outdoor bike project went ahead. But in this 
endeavor, Petrofsky tempered his admiration of the Apple II with a little 
of his old love of 8080 assembly language. 

"The Apple is a nice machine. For most of our applications where we 
have to run something in Basic, the Apple does just fine, although it just 
about gets overrun by controlling four muscles simultaneously. 

"So, for the outdoor bike, I used Z-80 assembler because I'm very fa- 
miliar with it and with CP/M. I've got the Lisa assembler for the Apple, 
but I'm less familiar with Lisar 

But the outdoor bike's central controller was also developed on the 
Apple as an indoor simulator with the Z-80 card. 

"That whole system is handmade. I use the Z-80 board on the Apple 
in the far lab, which is set up to run CP/M. Then I run a cable from a 
plug-in Apple port to the I /O to the outdoor bike. Then there are wheel 
stands under the outdoor bike to prop it up, so when we have somebody 
pedaling the bike, it runs the output through the Apple. That way, if I 
have any software errors on the on-board Z-80 computer, I can find 
them on the Apple. 

"The Apple ports are set to be identical to the ports on the little com- 
puter that I built with the hardware Z-80, so when everything looks 
good, I get the program in machine code and store the assembled binary 
version in high memory. I have a program for burning PROMs on disk 



in CP/M Basic, and I call that program in, go into high memory, and 
burn a PROM off. 

"That Apple is strictly for testing the outdoor bike, modifying it, and 
burning PROMs. Actually, I was happy with the second one I burned. I 
also have a couple of PROMs I blew that check the system out. They 
generate sine waves and triangular waves in different channels and check 
the different inputs to see if the system's running right." 

Now that true mobility was the issue, other conditions had to be con- 
sidered, and Phillips's mathematical models became more important in 
Petrofsky's programming. Away from the controlled conditions in the 
laboratory, the programs had to handle the effects of ambient tempera- 
ture on muscle performance and each subject's strength and work ca- 
pacity. And, of course, there are always hardware glitches. 

"When we got the outdoor bike running, I didn't like one of the pa- 
rameters. It was okay when we were using it on the Apple as a simula- 
tor, but when we actually got it in the field and had the bike going down 
the street instead of sitting on a jack stand, I didn't like one of the timing 
parameters, so I blew a second PROM," Petrofsky explains. 

Then there was throttle control. "I built a throttle control that was 
like a motorcycle throttle, and Harry didn't like it," Petrofsky says. 
"Then he built one that was nicer looking, but it started causing cross- 
talk with one of the other A to D channels and was screwing up the out- 



The Algorithms of Movement 

All of Petrofsky's control programs share a similar design. Every- 
thing is done in "closed loop" programs, simply meaning that the com- 
puter sends a stimulus; then monitors a sensor to see what the leg did; 
and then goes through a logic tree, deciding whether to increase stimula- 
tion (or decrease it or stay the same) depending on what happened. 

On the single leg trainer, the program generates a synthetic saw-tooth 
wave with a period of three seconds up, three seconds down, and then 
adjusts the output current to the electrodes until the leg sensor has the 
same output voltage as the wave. If the leg is too low, it increases the 
stimulation; if the 1^ is too high, it decreases the stimulation. 

Obviously, Petrofsky says, the trick on something like that is real- 
time constants. "You've got to recognize that this is not a computer," he 
says, slapping his leg. "It's not going to respond in a microsecond. So, if 
the Apple gives the leg an additional increment voltage, it's got to wait 
the right amount of time before it tries to give it more voltage to get a 
response. 

"In fact, one of the really nice things about the Apple is, like all mi- 
croprocessors, it's a little bit slow, which gives me the time delays I have 
to have to allow the body to respond. So rather than being a detriment, 
the slower speed of running Basic helps the program." 

But Petrofsky needed more speed for the bicycle programs. "I had to 
do some programming tricks in Basic to make the thing run. In order to 
get the speed up, I spend the first few lines in the program defining all the 
variables that are stored in floating point. And then I concatenate all the 
statements, so I only have a few program lines, with everything in vari- 
ables; no hard numbers. That way it runs faster than all get-out." 

However, Basic gets left behind with walking. "The trainer was sim- 
ple," Petrofsky says. "The indoor and outdoor bikes, not too bad. But 
the standing algorithm is a lulu, and the walking algorithms are even 
worse, because suddenly you've got pressure sensors on the front and 
back of the foot and on three joints on each leg, then a gyroscope show- 
ing equilibrium, and you've got to test and coordinate every sensor 
constantly. 

"You've got say, ten sensors, and with every individual change of 
each sensor you want a whole different action depending on the other 
readings, '//^this is here; and that is there; and that is going there; xor 
something else is going somewhere else; then do this; else do that' — a 
couple of thousand permutations in the control program. 

"And that's just for smooth ground. If you were to go up steps or up- 
hill or downhill, all hell breaks loose. If you try to sit up out of a chair, it 
gels even worse. And if you're on ice or grass, it gets really nasty."Dl

that doesn't crosstalk and doesn't look like the guy's playing Pac-Man." 

The Apple Gets Zapped. Eventually it worked. The "Zap Bike" — 
actually a large, adult-style tricycle that eliminates the problem of bal- 
ance — took a tour of the Wright State campus with Nan Davis provid- 
ing the motive power and a home-built Z-80-based microcomputer 
comprising a half-dozen chips providing the coordination for her move- 
ments. 

Petrofsky, however, is ambivalent about the success of the Zap Bike. 
He sees it as having contributed two things to their overall progress. 
First, he appreciates the practical experience for everyone on the team, 
especially Phillips, whose mathematical modeling benefited. "I write the 
programs, but he does the equations," Petrofsky says. "It was a chance 
for him to look at his equation and for me to check out control pro- 
grams." 

The second benefit was that it gave additional training to the test sub- 
jects. Instead of one muscle moving, now whole legs were moving, put- 
ting even greater stress on the heart and lungs and pushing training one 
step further. 

"I've got mixed emotions about the outdoor bike," Petrofsky con- 
fesses. "In terms of an engineering design, it was well worth the effort, 
because it's designed up from scratch so a paraplegic or quadriplegic can 
head out on a pretty day and pedal all over the park with it. It makes 
them mobile again, and they don't have to sit in a wheelchair. 

"And so it's very easy for them to hop in the chair or get helped into 
it and off they go, pedaling around the neighborhood. In fact, we're 
working on putting carbon electrodes in some slacks, so they can pull the 
slacks on and all the electrodes are automatically on. That's practical. 

"In terms of physiology and the whole project, it didn't do a lot. 
Aside from the fact that it was a fun piece of engineering, and also it was 
the first time paralyzed muscles had ever been used to get somebody to 
move again, to propel themselves, it was a God-awful waste of time. One 
month down the tubes on that stupid computer, getting out the cross- 
talk between the different circuits — that computer has only got about

eight chips on it, so I had a lot of problems with software and hardware. 
It went through a couple of drafts and a lot of broken boards before I got 
it up the way I wanted it, all battery operated and independent. 

"In that respect, we could have had somebody walking by now if we 
hadn't been messing with that bike," Petrofsky laughs. "I've got a lot of 
nights tied up in that bike." 

So the target is, and will always remain, walking. The latest addition 
to the lab is a walking support consisting of an I-beam supported on a 
two-inch by four-inch frame. The researchers have suspended a para- 
chute harness from a free-running wheel on the beam, so that their para- 
plegic volunteers can practice computer-controlled standing and walk- 
ing without fear of falling. 

With walking, however, the project leaves the venerable Apple 1 1 be- 
hind. "The Apple couldn't keep up with it really," Petrofsky says. "I 
need to control four times as many parameters ten times as fast, and the 
Apple was a little bit marginal as it was for the bicycle. So I'm using a 
Z-80 S-lOO system for the walking experiments." 

How can all this be measured in human terms? The paralyzed volun- 
teers make it clear that more is involved than just mobility (all of them 
are already equipped with motorized wheelchairs). Kevin Leonard, a 
Wright State sophomore who has been with the project since May, says 
that since he started exercising his legs, the involuntary muscle cramps 
that used to wrack his legs have all but disappeared. 

And although Leonard hasn't ridden the outdoors bike yet, he's 
looking forward to it. "Given a choice between the Zap Bike and my 
wheelchair, I'd take the bike," he says. "I'd be getting more exercise that 
way — and there's something about using your own muscles to move." 

Housch agrees with Leonard on that, but, hke Petrofsky, Housch is 
looking to the future. "I'd like to see us walking," he says. "I don't see 
how Jerry's going to do it, but he says he will, and so far he's done every- 
thing he said he was going to do."

Mind Your 




BY PETER OLIVIERI 




For many readers, it's nearly time to get out the long underwear, 
throw another log on the fire, and snuggle up with a good user manual. 
One thing about winter is certain ... it makes you appreciate summer. 

This month we'll be talking about a variety of things. We'll hear from 
a BUG (Business User Group) member, examine a business applica- 
tions package, and begin our long-awaited look at the Apple III. 

Apple III Overview. Most people have heard something or other 
about the Apple III. Indeed, there are a lot of impressions of this ma- 
chine and its capabilities. To Apple Computer's credit, the "new" Apple 
III has none of the problems the earlier machines had. The Apple III is 
now exactly what it was intended to be originally: a quahty machine de- 
signed specifically for the small business user. 

This month we'll examine the hardware that might comprise a typi- 
cal small business system. Next time we'll focus on the documentation, 
the systems software, and some of the applications software available for 
the Apple III. In future columns, there'll be a special section devoted ex- 
clusively to Apple III items. 

The Hardware. An Apple III system designed for the typical small 
business user would probably consist of these basic components: the Ap- 
ple III itself with 128K of main memory (a 256K version is available) 
and a built-in 5 '/4 -inch floppy disk drive; an Apple III monitor (or simi- 
lar display device); a second disk drive, which could either be the Apple 
III 5 '/4 -inch floppy drive or the ProFile hard disk; and a printer. 

This represents a typical arrangement, but it's not the only way to put 
together an Apple III system. As your business grows and your needs 
change, you can upgrade and expand your system, adding equipment as 
you need to. You can, for example, connect as many as three floppy disk 
drives. 

The machine itself is thoughtfully designed. The Apple III monitor 
fits well on top of the main machine and the built-in floppy disk drive is 
convenient and just as easy to use as the separate disk drive unit. 

The keyboard on the Apple III differs considerably from the Apple 1 1 
keyboard. It has a numeric keypad that facilitates the rapid entry of 
numbers. On the main keyboard, you'll find up and down arrow keys; a 
tab key (that actually works); some new symbols, such as a back slash, 
ellipsis points, and two sets of brackets; and two special programmable 
keys. The enfire keyboard has a nice feel to it, and touch typists are like- 
ly to appreciate the raised dots that have been strategically placed on 
some of the keys. 

The reset button is tucked behind the keyboard proper, well away 
from wandering fingers. It is evident that thought went into the design of 
this keyboard. In addition, there are a couple of different character fonts 
to choose from. 

The back of the Apple III has the usual on-off switch and AC cord 
connection in addition to seven other plugs. These include an external 
disk drive connector (no more having to take off the cover), two joystick 
ports (one of which can also be used as a place to connect a Silentype 
printer), a color video port, a black and white video port, an audio port 
for sending audio to a speaker or a tape recorder, and a serial port that 
allows you to connect the Apple to all devices that use the RS-232-C 
standard communications format. 

Inside the Apple III. The most important parts of the Apple III are on 
the inside. You won't need to do much on the inside of the machine, 
however, particularly given the arrangement whereby the printer and 
disk drives connect to ports at the back. Removing the cover entails turn- 
ing two screws that are located underneath the machine itself When you 
remove the cover, a small light warns you if the power is still on. 

As you peer inside the machine, you'll notice the disk drive and 



power supply almost immediately. Between these two items are four long 
connector slots. It is here that the interface cards are placed. These cards 
might connect to a plotter, to test equipment, or to a modem for com- 
municating with another computer. 

The most likely card to include is the one that connects to the Pro- 
File hard disk system. Once this card is installed, the ProFile itself can be 
attached without removing the cover of the machine. 

Rounding out the inside of the Apple III are an internal speaker and 
a security mount. This mount enables you to bolt the Apple to a table or 
shelf or secure it to a chain to discourage theft. The III also has a 
built-in fan. 

Profile of a ProFile. The Apple III hard disk is called the ProFile. 
It's about the size of a shoe box (size 12 sneakers would fit in nicely). The 
ProFile consists of a Winchester hard disk drive (which essentially means 
that it is self-contained, environmentally sealed, and very fast) that can 
store five million characters, approximately equivalent to what can be 
stored on thirty-five floppy disks. To put it in even more familiar terms, 
the ProFile can store about the equivalent of twelve hundred typed pages 
of single-spaced text. 

The ProFile is fast, quiet, and very easy to use. Graphics can be dis- 
played at a speed that is certain to surprise you. In addition, the ProFile 
does an automatic surface analysis and error-detection routine each time 
it is started up — to ensure the integrity of the stored data.

us into ladies' fashions, have you?" 

Dow: "No, Mr. Jones. That's a computer store, and our software 
products allow investors and business professionals to use 
a personal computer like this one here to easily manage 
financial information." 

Jones: "But what about our reputation? We've been leaders in 

serving the business and financial community for over 100 
years. Are you sure this new software will be as reliable as 
The Wall Street Journal and Barron's?" 

Dow: "Of course, Jones. Our software is so reliable we back it up 
with a full-year warranty. People trust Dow Jones Software 
the same way they trust the Journal. And we have a toll- 
free Hotline number in case they want expert help." 

Jones: "Couldn't that be a lot of phone calls? After all, we've got 
the Dow Jones Averages to get out every day." 

Dow: "Don't worry, Jones. Our software is very easy to use, and 
we have a fully staffed Customer Service Department to 



respond to our dealers and customers." 
Jones: "Just what can our software do?" 

Dow: "In a nutshell, Jones, with a personal computer, a tele- 
phone, a modem and Dow Jones Software, you can easily 
perform complex analyses on the information available

The only drawback to the ProFile hard disk system is that there's no 
simple way to back up the information you have stored. You would have 
to back up to floppies, which, by the way, store 143,000 characters. 
Nevertheless, once you get used to using a hard disk, you may find it very 
difficult to adjust to using anything else. 

Pluses and Minuses— a Quick Summary. Using the Apple III is easy 
and, in many ways, a real pleasure. Among the machine's major 
strengths are its large main memory (from 128K to 256K), the ease with 
which the system can be expanded, the microprocessor speed, and the 
comfortable keyboard with its new capabilities. The separate keypad is 
useful. It's also handy to be able to connect devices at the rear of the ma- 
chine, instead of having to hook them up inside. 

Both upper case and lower case characters can be generated, con- 
trolled by the shift key. Text can be displayed in either forty columns or 
eighty columns and in color if you have a color monitor. There are three 
graphics modes on the III: 280 by 192, 140 by 192, and 560 by 192. 

Another plus is the Apple III operating system (SOS), which handles 
files easily and makes possible the interchange of data from different ap- 
plications programs. 

The Apple III is reliable, with none of the problems that had been as- 
sociated with its introduction. Designed with both the user and the busi- 
ness in mind, the machine is attractive, functional, and human engi- 
neered. 

What about the Apple Ill's disadvantages? Well, one weakness is 
that the operating system and the device controlling programs take up a 
fairly large chunk of memory (as much as 64K). Also, while the machine 
does operate faster than the Apple II, its actual processing speed is 
slowed down considerably by the number of SOS instructions needed. 
Some floppy disk space is taken up by device drive programs and such, 
which are stored on disk. 

The machine itself is much heavier than the Apple II; consequently, 
it's not as easy to move the III from room to room or to take it home. 



And, as we discussed earlier, the ProFile hard disk drive has a cumber- 
some back-up procedure. 

All things considered, the Apple III is a well-designed machine. Cer- 
tainly, it is a leading candidate for small business users to consider. A 
machine must be more than attractive and reliable, however, if it is to be- 
come "the machine of choice" for people who are involved in small busi- 
nesses. It must be supported by good documentation, good systems pro- 
grams, and a wide variety of applications software. 

Next month we'll see how the Apple III measures up in these areas. 
We'll look carefully at the documentation that comes with the III and at 
many of the currently available applications packages. We'll conclude 
with a comprehensive summary and critique of the Apple Ill's strengths 
and weaknesses as a business computer. 

Business User Group. We're beginning to get responses to the re- 
quest for information about your experiences with printers and word 
processing packages. Please keep them coming; other users will find your 
input helpful. Send your comments to Softalk BUG, Box 60, North Hol- 
ly wod, CA 91603. 

Meanwhile, Robert Jordan from Memphis, Tennessee, mentions that 
he is quite happy with his IDS 440G Paper Tiger Printer, for which he 
paid $900. He cites the strengths of the machine as its speed and rugged- 
ness. Two of its drawbacks are the fact that its letters have no true de- 
scenders and that replacing the printhead is expensive. While Jordan 
likes the 440, he feels that the 460 and 560 may be better machines. 

Our thanks to Bob Jordan for kicking off our BUG printer/word 
processing comments. 

On to Applications — Investigating Infotory. One very common ap-

management systems now on the market can perform an inventory con- 
trol function. And, in fact, tiie inventory control situation is sometimes 
cited as an example of a database application. Nonetheless, organiza- 
tions that are well versed in the problems associated with the day-to-day 
control of inventory would probably welcome a package specifically de- 
signed for that purpose. 

One such package is Infotory, an inventory management program by 
SSR Corporation. 

Managing inventory is important to an organization. Members of a 
company's sales force want the inventory available so their customers 
can get the best service in the shortest time. The finance department 
wants to keep the inventory at a level that minimizes storage and carry- 
ing costs. The Infotory package is designed to help manage these some- 
times competing objectives. 

The system offers the following features: 

1. It can keep track of and report on as many as fourteen hundred 
items. 

2. Inventory is managed from its receipt to its sale. 

3. Purchase order management information is provided. 

4. New items can be added to the inventory. 

5. Item inventories can be updated. ^ 

6. Inquiries can be made about any item. * 

7. Inventory reports, price lists, and sales/cost analysis reports can 
be printed on request. 

8. A complete audit trail is printed for all transactions made. This is 
an unusual and most welcome feature. 

9. A special feature, called Anyreport, makes possible the creation of 
customized reports. 

The system requires an Apple II Plus with 48K and ROM Apple- 
soft, a monitor, an eighty-column printer, DOS 3.3, and two disk drives. 

To begin using the Infotory system, you must first prepare your cur- 
rent inventory information for entry into the computer. The initial chap- 
ter in the user guide explains what you must do to make this conversion 



successfully. The manual includes a data collection form to aid you in 
this process, and it's easy to make extra copies of this form to accommo- 
date large inventories. 

All terms that are used on the form (or anywhere in the package) are 
introduced and clearly defined. Following the explanation of how to con- 
vert your existing data so that it is ready for Infotory, you're presented 
with a glossary of terms, a definition of all data fields, and examples of all 
formulas that are used in calculations (for example, cost on hand, gross 
profit, margin, and so on). 

The user guide is among the best available. It is clearly written and 
contains more than one hundred screen illustrations. Sometimes, what 
you get for a screen illustration is a blank screen. But then if that's what 
you're going to see when you start up the system, perhaps displaying it in 
the manual is not such a bad idea. The authors of the manual seem to 
have anticipated all the possible little mistakes new users might make. 

When you start up the system, you can enter daily information (deal- 
ing with items received, items sold, items on order), look at or generate 
information and reports (choices include item information, inventory re- 
ports, price lists, sales and costs analyses, the Anyreport generator), or 
take care of data maintenance tasks (add or delete inventory items, 
change or update items, clear sales and cost data, initialize new disks). 
The user guide describes each of these menu items in detail. 

Each inventory item has an item number, a description, a price, a re- 
order level, a location, and a vendor associated with it. As you use the 
system over time, additional information about the inventory becomes 
available. For example, you can get period sales, average costs, quanti- 
ties on hand, quantities on order, profits, margins, order costs, and car- 
rying costs. 

The Anyreport feature, which is much like a typical database search, 
is one of the most useful features in the package. You can use the Anyre- 
port option to search through the inventory and find all items currently 
in stock that cost more than $50. 

The setup for making selections is particularly nice. First, a list of all

the fields is displayed on screen and you're asked to type yes next to those 
you want printed up. Next, a list of all the fields is displayed once again 
and you're asked to type a field number, a comparison operator (a less 
than, more than, or equals symbol), and then another field number or 
some specified value. This option makes possible the printing of some 
pretty fancy reports. 

Not much has been left out of this system. There are times when the 
extended costs (costs times quantity) must be calculated manually before 
entry, a task the system might have been designed to do. In addition, it 
might have been nice to have the capability of entering more informa- 
tion about a vendor, although this would have no doubt used up some of 
the storage space available for storing inventory data. Finally, no men- 
tion was made in the documentation about back-up copies of the pro- 
gram disks, although backing up one's data disks was discussed in de- 
tail. These are relatively minor complaints, however, considering the ad- 
vantages the system offers. 

Before we conclude our discussion, it might be helpful to look at 
some of the data limitations of the Infotory package. As mentioned ear- 
lier, the system accommodates fourteen hundred items. The allowable 
field lengths of the data items are shown in figure 1. 

If these parameters are within the range of those you're working with 
in your inventory system, it would be worth your while to give serious

AND DUPLICATION SYSTEMS 
FOR THE APPLE COMPUTER 



The Lock-lt-Up systems are sophisticated, menu 
driven copy-protection and duplication utilities for the 
Apple 11 Computer. They feature several levels of pro- 
tection which make standard disltettes uncopyable by 
even the most sophisticated nibble copy programs 
currently available. 

• All sectors on the diskette can still be used. 

• Data files can be loaded and/or saved to either the pro- 
tected diskette or an unprotected diskette. 

• Memory will be cleared and the disk will reboot if the reset 
key is pushed. 

• The copying systems support up to 14 disk drives. 

• Complete data-verification is optional during copy. 

• Sequential serial numbers are assigned to each diskette 
produced by the system. 

• Master diskettes created with the system contain an I.D. 
stamp that you select. The I.D. stamp must be correctly 
specified before any diskettes can be duplicated. This pre- 
vents other Lock-lt-Up owners from copying your diskettes. 

• Extensive support is provided should you have any prob- 
lems or special needs. 

• Our system is supported by numerous disk copying services 
should you need a large quantity of diskettes duplicated. 

Either system is available for $225, which includes three diskettes, an 
informative manual, and a non-exclusive license to copy as many 
diskettes as needed.

One of the most fascinating and powerful capabilities of your Apple 
is its ability to manipulate strings. A string is a sequence of characters — 
any characters. This sentence is a string. The number "1000" is a string 
(four characters long); so is "one thousand" (12 characters long). You 
can define any variable ending with a dollar sign as a string, like this: 

A$ = "GOOD MORNING" 

Now, whenever you print AS, the phrase "Good Morning" will ap- 
pear on the screen. Old hat, you say? Perhaps, but take a look at the list 
of new Applesoft commands that we are going to learn this time, most of 
them designed specifically to manipulate strings: 



STR$(x) 


VAL(a$) 


LEFT$(a$,x) 


RIGHT$(a$,x) 


INT(x) 


MID$(a$,x,y) 


STEP 


PEEK (-16336) 



With these few additional commands, we will be able to manipulate 
strings in countless useful ways — but let's count them anyhow. 

First, we will design a formatting routine that will take any number 
and turn it into dollar and cents format, with two digits to the right side 
of the decimal and commas dividing large numbers every three digits. 

Second, we will design a string analyzer that can separate first and 
last names in a mailing list for proper use in a form letter. (Yes! You too 
can create junk mail with a personal touch!) 

Third, we will design a routine that will take any message and scroll it 
across the screen Teletype-style. The usefulness of this routine is some- 
what uncertain, but it is fun. 

Fourth (and last), we will design a very efficient branching routine 
that will search keyboard input for a given list of control codes and then 
jump to the appropriate line in a program. The usefulness of this routine 
is more than sufficient to make up for number three above, although it 
doesn't have much pizzazz. 

Now let's see if we can deliver on all those promises. The first rou- 
tine should be able to take a number, such as 12345.6, and convert it to 
dollar format ($12,345.60) before displaying it on the screen. This will 
make numbers much more readable. 

The way to do this is to take the numeric variable value and change it 
to a string, which we can then play with: 

10 INPUT NUMBER 

20 A$ = STR$(NUMBER) 

Line 10 allows us to enter any number, which is stored as the nu- 
meric variable Number. Line 20 converts the numeric variable to a string 
of characters and stores the string in the string variable A$. For exam- 
ple, if we type in the digits 00123, the variable Number becomes the value 
123. Then line 20 converts the number 123 to the string of three charac- 
ters 1, 2, and 3, and stores that string in the variable A$. 

To add the dollar sign to the front end of the string we just con- 
catenate our string with another: 

50 A$ = "$" + A$ 

It's a little more complicated to get the cents part right. If a number 
has too many digits to the right of the decimal point, it's pretty simple to 
round it down to two, using the INT function. INT takes the value of 
whatever numerical value it is given and turns it into an integer by throw- 
ing away that part to the right of the decimal. For example, if N = 
INT(3.14159), then N equals 3. 



Using this to round our number off to two decimal places is sim- 
ple—just multiply the number {not the string) by 100, INT it, and then 
divide the result by 100. Like this: 

15 NUMBER = INT{NUMBER*100) / 100 

This works fine as long as our number has too many digits to the 
right of the decimal — 1 .2345, for example. But what about numbers with 
too few digits? We have to pad them out with zeros so they come out 
even — 1.1 becomes 1.10, and 5 becomes 5.00. 

It's easier to do this by fiddling with the string A$. We know that if 
the number had at least two digits to the right of the decimal point, then 
line 15 will have handled it properly, and there should be a decimal point 
exactly three characters from the right end of the string. We can look for 
that decimal point by using the mid$ command. 

Mid$, lefts, and rightS are three commands that return part of a 
string to you. They work like this. Suppose that 

A$ = ■•A123BCD" 
and that 

B$ = LEFT$(A$,3) 
Then B$ will be equal to the left three digits of A$ or, in this case, "A 12." 

As you can see, leftS has two parameters. The first one is the string 
that we are going to take the left part of. The second tells how many

characters to take. If we had set B$ equal to right$(A$,3), then B$ would 
have been equal to "BCD." 

Here is an example. Can you figure out the value of AnswerS with- 
out running the program? 

T1$ = "VERTICALLY ': T2$ = "FOOD" 
ANSWERS = LEFT$(T1$,3) + RIGHT$(T1$, 1) 

+ RIGHT$("B U G",2) + RIGHT$(T2$,3) 

Mid$ is a little more complicated. As its name implies, it can be used 
to pick a string out of the middle of another string rather than just one 
end or the other. However, to do this it not only needs to know the 
source string and the length of the segment it will be copying, it also 
needs to know where to start copying from. For example, let's say you 
want to pick out two characters from a string, starting four characters 
from the left. Your command might look like this: 

ANSWERS = MID$("UNANOLOG",4,2) 

Answers is equal to the substring "No." The first parameter in pa- 
rentheses is the string to be examined. The second is the starting position 
in the string (counting from the left), and the third is the number of char- 
acters to be taken. 

Let's get back to our problem now. We want to find that decimal 
point and, one way or another, make sure that there are two digits to the 
right of it. The first thing we can do is check to see if the decimal point is 
already in the right place. If it is, we're all set and don't have to worry 
about monkeying around with the string. What should our test look like? 

25 IF MID$(A$,LEN(A$)-2,1) = "." THEN 40 

What this says is find the last character in A$ and back up two char- 
acters. Then look and see if the third character from the end is a decimal 
point. If so, glory be, home free; skip this section and move straight on to 
line 40! 

Before we go any further we should probably back up a little and 
make sure that all strings have a decimal point somewhere. The only 
numbers that don't are integers, and we can test for integers and add a 
decimal to the end of the string using our old friend INT once again: 



NOVEMBER 1982 



22 IF INT(NUMBER) = NUMBER THEN A$ = A$ + "." 

The reason for this will soon be clear. If A$ fails the test on line 25, it 
is because there are too few digits to the right of the decimal. So we can 
just add a zero to the end of the string and then run the test on line 25 

again: 

30 A$ = A$ + "0":GOTO 25 

We're almost done. All that remains is to put commas in wherever 
they are needed. If the number is smaller than one thousand, there will be 

no commas: 

40 IF NUMBER< 1000 THEN 50 

Let's set up a new string equal to all of A$ above the hundreds place. 
Then let's eliminate all of A$ to the left of that first comma: 



45 B$ = LEFT$(A$,LEN{A$) - 6): A$ 



+ RIGHT$(A$,6) 



Now if B$ is less than four digits long we can just tack it onto the be- 
ginning of A$ and exit this part of the routine, having inserted (in line 45) 
the number's one and only comma: 

46 IF LEN(B$) < 4 THEN A$ = B$ + A$:GOTO 50 

However, if B$ is longer than that, we are going to have to add more 

commas: 

47 A$ = "," + RIGHT$(B$,3) + A$: B$ = 
LEFT$(B$,LEN(B$)-3):G0T0 46 

What we have done is to add another comma to A$ followed by the 
right three digits of B$. We then knocked three digits off the right end of 
B$ and returned to the test in line 46 to see if B$ was now less than four 
digits long. The program will stay in this loop, gradually taking digits off 
B$ and adding them back, with commas, to AS until the full number has 
been reassembled as AS. 

Finally, let's add two lines to permit us to see our results and do it 
again and again:

And one final warning. Don't enter numbers over one billion. The 
Apple stores very large numbers in exponential form (and doesn't keep 
very good track of more than eight digits either), so you can expect some 
errors when using very large numbers. 

Getting Personal. Some of that was pretty heavy sledding. The sec- 
ond project is a good deal easier. Perhaps you have suffered from the re- 
cent outpouring of computerized "personal" letters trying to sell you 
subscriptions to magazines other than So/talk, or real estate, or used 
cars. The thing that makes these letters particularly irritating is their fa- 
miliar tone: the way they call you by your first name, talk about the 
benefits they are about to bestow on the entire "Carlston" family, and 
comment on how all your neighbors in "San Rafael" are buying their 
used cars by mail too. 

Well, the only way to fight fire is with fire, so now we are about to 
impart to you the secret of how to personalize your own junk mail. There 
isn't much to it really. Suppose that you want to type in a hst of names 
and addresses. For the envelope you need to use the full name of the 
party in question. In the greeting, you would like to use just the first 
name, and in the text you want to refer to the family, requiring the use of 
the last name. 

Separating out the first and last names from a string containing a per- 
son's entire name is not particularly difficult. You merely have to search 
the string for spaces. You can usually assume that everything before the 
first space is a person's first name and everything after the last space is 
the last name (although even the best made plans sometimes go awry — 
that's why you occasionally see form letters addressed to "Mr. Jr."). 

Here's a little routine that separates FullnameS into FirstS and LastS:. 

10 INPUT "ENTER FULL NAME: ";FULLNAME$:L = 

LEN(FULLNAME$) 
20 FOR X = 1 TO L 

30 IF MID$(FULLNAME$,X,1) = " " THEN Y = X: X = L

100 PRINT "THE FIRST NAME IS ":FIRST$

THEN Y = X: X = 1 



AND THE LAST 



Take a close look at the use of the for-next loop in line 60 for a mo- 
ment. Usually the value of the counter in a for-next loop increases by one 
each time you go through the loop. In other words, it steps the counter 
by one each time through. However, by addition of the step command at 
the end of the for command, one can change the step to any other value. 
In this case we wanted to work from the back of the string to the begin- 
ning. In other words, we wanted to count backward by one until we 
found our first space. Therefore, we used step —1. 

Scrolling Along. Our third roufine is fun. Load a message into the 
string A$, jump to this subroutine, and watch the message go rippling 
across the screen. Since scrolling messages are sometimes hard to read, 
this routine is designed so that pressing any key will stop the scroll. 
Another press will start it up again.

That routine was not exactly written for maximum readability. How- 
ever, this is more or less how it works. The string G$ is the display string. 
At first it is filled with ten blanks. Then A$ is tacked on to the end of it. 
Forty-character-long chunks of G$ are then displayed on the screen. 
Each time through the for-next loop, the starting point of the forty char- 
acters is incremented by one. In other words, the first time through, char- 
acters one through forty are displayed. The second time through, char- 
acters two through forty-one are displayed, and so forth. The peek 
(— 1 6336) is just a reference to the speaker location in the Apple. Peeking 
it causes a clicking sound (peeking it very quickly can generate music, but 
that's another story). 

Branching Out. Our final project is much less amusing but very use- 
ful. Think back to last month's project. We wrote a program to create 
shape tables. There were many keys we used to move our cursor about 
the screen, load in shapes, or save them to disk or cassette. We tested for 
each one of those keys with an if statement. Simple and effective but not 
very economical — and very wasteful indeed of computer memory. 

Suppose that we had created a string of all of the keys we used to 
control the program, like this: A$ = "IJKMCSRXY" (you can even in- 
clude control characters in such a list, although you won't be able to see 
them). Then the use of a command called the computed goto statement 
permits a very elegant branch. It looks like this: 

100 GET A$: FOR I = 1 TO 9: IF A$ = MID$("IJKMCSRXY",I,1) 
THEN J = 1:1 = 9: NEXT : ON J GOTO 
1000,2000,3000,4000,5000,8000,7000,8000,9000 

1 10 NEXT : GOTO 100 

If J equals one, then the program branches to the first line number 
listed in the list after the goto statement. If J is two, then program con- 
trol shifts to the second line number listed (2000 in the example above) 
and so forth. And the best thing is that, if the key pressed is not one of 
those in the string, the program immediately returns to line 100 and waits 
for you to try another key. 

That's enough for this month. Your homework assignment is to use 
the commands illustrated in this month's column to design a routine that 
creates random but pronounceable names. Another truly useful routine 
for your library of tools.

First, just a note to remind you that we are looking for graphics crea- 
tions on your Apple for use in this column. Along with the usual how- 
to's, we'll be doing some issues about all the different ways people are us- 
ing the Apple's graphics. Please send any disks, printouts of artwork, or 
descriptions of your graphics applications to Softalk Gallery, Box 60, 
North Hollywood, CA 91603. 

We've talked about using graphics from Basic. However, the speed 
limit on Applesoft requires the use of machine language for animated 
graphics. The most difficult part about machine language is learning to 
think in hexadecimal, or base sixteen. Base sixteen is a kind of short- 
hand for binary, the number system that your computer actually "under- 
stands." The best way to handle hexadecimal is not to convert to base ten 
and back unless it's really necessary. Most of the time it's not. The only 
time you'll have to convert is when you are trying to reference your ma- 
chine language routines or addresses from Basic. 

In base ten (decimal), you count 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1 1,.... In base six- 
teen (hexadecimal), you count 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F,10,11,.... 
The numeral A is really what we call ten, B is eleven, C is twelve, and so 
on. F is fifteen, after which comes 10, or sixteen (it's base sixteen, 
remember?). 

To keep things straight, when referencing hexadecimal numbers, 
we'll precede the number with a dollar sign (Why? Because everyone else 
does). So 2000 is the good old number two thousand you all know, while 
$2000 does not mean two thousand dollars (drat); it means two thou- 
sand hexadecimal, which is really 8192. "Slow down!" you say. . . . 
Okay. Lx)ok at table 1. It shows numbers in binary, hexadecimal, and 
decimal. Notice how conveniently the numbers $0 through $F corre- 
spond to all combinations of binary numbers that can fit in four bits. Re- 
member also how conveniently a byte, the basic storage unit, has eight 
bits. That means that two hexadecimal digits can give you all the pos- 
sible values for one byte ($00 through $FF). That's why they picked base 
sixteen as such a convenient shorthand; 

The largest hexadecimal number you'll be dealing with is $FFFF. It's

a four digit number because the Apple and other similar computers use 
two bytes to store addresses, $FF and $FF, in this case. The number 
SFFFF in decimal is 65535, which gives the 64K that you hear about as 
the Apple's maximum memory size. One K is approximately 1,000 bytes; 
it's actually 1,024, or two to the tenth power. To understand the process 
of converting hexadecimal numbers to decimal, see figure 1 as an exam- 
ple. The rightmost of the four places is the ones column, the next is the 
sixteens column, the next column over is for sixteen to the second pow- 
er, or 256, and the leftmost of the four places is for sixteen to the third, 
or 4,096. 

Machine Language Coding. The first thing we'll do with machine 
language is to take the program in listing 4 from last month and convert 
the graphics part. In case you don't have it on hand, it's included this 
month as listing 1. The program first creates a Y look-up table (lines 
150-250), then cycles through a loop, putting bytes with all the dots set 
onto the screen. 

Our first task will be to create a permanent Y look-up table for our 
machine language routines. There's no need to recompute it all the time; 
once we have it we can bload it into any program that needs it. To make 
it easy, we'll use a Basic program to do the computations and poke the 
values we want into memory. Then we'll save that portion of memory to 
disk, and we've got it whenever it's needed. 

We'll put the look-up table just above the hi-res page 1 screen mem- 
ory. Page 1 is located from addresses 8192 ($2000) to 16383 ($3FFF). 
That means our table should start at 16384, or $4000. For reasons that 
will become apparent at some later date, we'll store the table in two sec- 
tions; first the high bytes of all the addresses, then the low bytes. By high

and low bytes, we mean that for an address such as $4F8A, the high byte 
is the left half, or $4F, and the low byte is $8 A, the right half. Since there 
are 192 Y values on the screen, the first part of the table, the high bytes, 
will take 192 bytes, from 16384 to 16575 ($4000-$40BF). The second 
half, the low bytes of the 192 addresses, will be put in 16576 to 16767 
($40C0-$417F). 

The high byte of a value is computed from decimal by dividing by 
256 and chopping off the remainder. The low byte is the remainder of 
that same division. The program in listing 2 does all the same computa- 
tions for the look-up table that we did last month, but then splits the ad- 
dress into high and low bytes and pokes those into memory. Type it in, 
then run it. 

After you run the program, your look-up table is in memory. Now 
you want to save it to disk. Type: 

BSAVE LOOKUP,A16384,L384 

or, alternately, 

BSAVE LOOKUP,A$4000,L$180 

The A means starting at which address, and the L means length. As 
shown, you can define these parameters with either decimal or hexadeci- 
mal numbers. Bsave means binary save. 

You may want to bsave the file the same way on a few disks. We'll be 
using this look-up table a lot, and if you wind up doing much graphics 
programming in machine language, you will probably use it frequently. 

Now for a short introduction to assembly language. Did we say ma- 
chine language before? Well, assembly language is almost the same as 
machine language, except that machine language is just numbers (hexa- 
decimal ones, at that). Assembly language corresponds one-to-one with 
those machine language numbers, but its commands are mnemonics in- 
stead. In other words, you use letters that mean something to you in- 
stead of the numbers that the machine understands. To convert your as- 
sembly language mnemonics to machine language numbers, you need an 
assembler. An assembler is a program that interprets the assembly lan- 
guage instructions you write and pokes the corresponding numbers into 
memory for the machine to read. Two assemblers that we know will 
work with the listings we've included are the DOS Tool Kit assembler 
from Apple and Merlin from Southwestern Data Systems. Some of the 
necessary mnemonics may be different on other assemblers. Of course, if 
you don't have an assembler and want to use the routines in these ar- 
ticles, you could just enter the finished numbers in the listings, but that's 
dull and boring and you really wouldn't learn much about writing in as- 
sembly/machine language. 

This first little machine language routine (listing 3) takes an X and Y

value that you give it, finds the Y look-up value in the look-up table, then 
puts the value $FF (255) at the corresponding byte on the screen. Not 
much, but it does illustrate a few of the instructions and addressing meth- 
ods used in machine language. Going through listing 3 line by line; 

The first line (ORG $6000) says that the machine language routine 
will originate (ORG) at address $6000 (24576). The assembler will start 
putting our instructions at that address in memory. 

The next four lines are equate commands (EQU), or label defini- 
tions. The first says that whenever we use TEMPLO, we'll really mean 
the location $06. We could just as easily use the number $06 throughout, 
but it's not as easy to remember or to change later. In all the cases in this 
example, the equates refer to addresses in memory that we'll be using in 
our program for storing things. We use them like variables in Basic, ex- 
cept we tell the computer exactly where in memory these storage loca- 
tions should be. TEMPLO and TEMPHI refer to addresses $6 and $7 in 
your computer. The first 256 bytes (addresses $0000 to $00FF) are re- 
ferred to as zero page, and can be accessed much faster and do some spe- 
cial things that other memory addresses cannot do. Most of the zero 
page is used by Applesoft and DOS (both of which are machine lan- 
guage programs, in reality). Addresses $6 through $9 are free, however, 
so we'll use two of those. 

LOOKHI and LOOKLO are also equated; they are the starting ad- 
dresses of the two parts of our look-up table that we created and saved. 
Again, we could just use the addresses in our assembly language pro- 
gram when needed, but the labels allow us to give them a little more 
meanmg. 

Next, we define two more bytes of storage (DFB means define byte). 
With these two we don't really care about where exactly they go in mem- 
ory; we just want them in there. As it is, they are the first two bytes ac- 
tually set aside by our assembly language program, so they'll be put at 
$6000 and $6001 (the ORG told the assembler to start at $6000, and the 
equates don't really count, since we were just telling it that a label means 
a particular number). We defined the bytes as having values of zero, al- 
though that doesn't matter, because it's in these locations that we'll poke 
our X and Y values. 

Now the program starts. The first instruction (LDY YVALUE) is to 
load the Y register with the number in YVALUE. The Apple has three 
main registers, which are single bytes set aside inside the 6502 micro- 
processor. These are accessed very quickly, and most instructions center 
around the use of these bytes (and one other). The registers are labeled A, 
X, and Y. A is the accumulator, where most everything happens, includ- 
ing all mathematics and logic operations. The X and Y registers are used 
mostly as pointers, offsets, and counters. LDY YVALUE means to load 
the Y register with the number in the memory location represented by 
YVALUE. We'll be using this number as an offset, much as you would 
use the parameters of an array in Basic. In fact, we'll use it as an offset in 
our look-up table, just as we did in the Basic examples with look-up 
arrays. 

The next line says to load the accumulator with the value in the ad- 
dress LOOKLO, offset by Y. Given the equate command in line 5, that 
means that it will load the accumulator with the value in address 
$40C0-I-Y. Exactly like using an array in Basic! 

That is followed by STA TEMPLO, or store A in TEMPLO. This in- 
struction takes the value that we just loaded into the accumulator from 
the look-up table and puts it in address TEMPLO ($06). Note that in as- 
sembly/machine language, you can't really say "take something from 
here in memory and put it over there" in one command. You have to 
load it into one of the registers fi-om a memory location, then store the 
contents of that register in another memory location. 

The next two instructions duplicate the load and store commands for 
the high byte from the table. That was easy. . . . 

Next, we load the accumulator (LDA) with the number $FF (255). 
Note that the # sign means to use the number following it. If the # were 
left off, the instruction would mean "load A with whatever is in address 
$FF." A frequent mistake of beginners and experts alike is to leave off 
the # and wonder why the program does such strange things. Just when 
you're sure that your computer's broken or that you've found a bug in 
the ROM, you discover the missing # that changed the entire meaning of 
things. Grrrr. . . . You have to tell it everything! 

Now for some tricky maneuvering. As we mentioned, zero-page ad-

dresses have some special functions that can do things other addresses

TEMPLO and its following byte (TEMPHI), offset by Y. In other 
words, take the address stored in TEMPLO and TEMPHI, add the 
value in Y, and store the contents of the accumulator in the resulting lo- 
cation. In our particular application, this takes the base address of the 
line that we stored in TEMPLO and TEMPHI, adds theX value, which 
was loaded into the Y register, and stores the number $FF in the result- 
ing location. 

Confusing perhaps, but that's about as tricky as machine language 
addressing gets. If you can handle that, you've got a good start on un- 
derstanding how machine language works. 

The last line is a return from subroutine (RTS), which is the equiva- 
lent of a Basic return statement. It means to go back to the instruction 
from whence it was called. 

Listing 4 shows the same program after it has gone through the as- 
sembly process. After assembling, you are shown the addresses of each 
assembled instruction and the actual hexadecimal values to which those 
instructions were converted. If you don't have an assembler, you can en- 
ter this short routine by hand with the commands in listing 5. 

Finally, listing 6 is a Basic program that bloads the look-up table and 
machine language program, then loops through, pokes the X and Y 
values into locations 24576 ($6000) and 24577 ($6001), and calls the sub- 
routine at 24578 ($6002). Notice the similarities and differences between 
listing 6 and 1. The new version may not seem much faster than the old, 
since most of the work is still being done in Basic, and the machine lan- 
guage routine is very short with no repetition. But as the tasks become 
slightly more complex, the speed differences in machine language are 
awesome, as you'll soon find out for yourself.

Everyone's Guide to Assembly 
Language, Part 26 



Earlier this year in the January and February columns we discussed 
how Applesoft variable data could be passed from Basic to machine lan- 
guage and back again. The rationale was that in many cases a program 
created by combining Applesoft and machine language is an effective ap- 
proach to a problem. Successive issues on hi-res graphics included these 
techniques so as to have a convenient way of experimenting with the 
various routines. 

It is highly recommended that you review the appropriate issues if 
you're not entirely familiar with the nature of Applesoft variable stor- 
age. This article will not extensively review the material presented there. 
Pages 127 and 137 in the Applesoft Reference Manual also provide very 
valuable information well worth referring to in the course of reading the 
material presented here. 

For the most part, however, all the past discussions were limited to 
dealing with two-byte integer data. That is to say, the possibility of deal- 
ing with true floating point data was not considered. In many cases, in- 
teger values from 0 to 65,535 or -32,767 to 32,767 are more than ade-

quate for our purposes, as was the case when passing tone routines or X 
and Y coordinates for plotting. There are times, though, when greater 
precision, or fractional values, are required. 

Dealing with floating point numbers from a pure machine language 
program is a fairly complex topic, and our intent here is not to explain 
completely the inner workings of floating point operations. Rather, let's 
explore the options made available by taking advantage of the existing 
routines already present in the Applesoft Basic interpreter. These can 
generally be considered to be always present in the background of an op- 
erating machine language program. 

For those of you who hope to speed up floating point operations in 
Applesoft, writing your own routines may not be that effective. This is 
because the routines in Applesoft are already written in machine lan- 
guage. We can, however, gain important speed improvements just by 
calling the routines directly. This is because we can eliminate the normal 
process of interpreting Basic statements that would otherwise occur in 
Applesoft. This is what the currently available compilers do, and we can 
expect similar speed improvements to a Basic program by using routines 
directly from machine language (two to five times faster than straight 
Applesoft). 

Internalization of Data: Integer versus Real Variables. The first 
step in our inquiry is to investigate how Applesoft stores numeric data 
and to look at the differences in how integer variables and real variables 
are stored. 

Start by initializing your Apple's memory with an FP statement. 
Then enter 

A% = 10:A=10 

The result is that two variables and their values have been set up in 
memory. Now to find them! 

Enter the Monitor with the usual call— 151. Then enter 

67 68 AF BO 
and press return. You should get: 

67- 01 

68- 08 
AF- 03 
BO- 08 

You may recall from a previous discussion (January 1982) that these 
four memory locations (67,68 and AF,BO) are used to store the begin- 
ning and the end of the current Applesoft program. We can see from the 
display that the program resides from $801 to $803. A very short pro- 
gram, indeed, but that's understandable since we haven't entered any 
program lines. 

Now let's examine the pointer at $69,6A and $6B,6C. Do this by 

typing: 

69. 6C 

and pressing return. You should get: 

69- 03 08 10 08

Starting at $803, we find the variable A% stored from $803 to $809. 
The first two bytes are the name characters. Two bytes are always used. 
If the variable name is only one character then a null ($00 or $80) is 
stored in the second position. Note that integer, real, and string variable 
names are differentiated by the combination of high bit settings in the 
two-name character bytes. Since only bits 0 through 6 are used for the

character (ASCII is only a seven-bit code), bit 7 (the high-order bit) is 
available for encoding the variable type. 

Integer variables always have both high bits set. Real variables al- 
ways have both high bits clear. String variables always have the first 
name character clear and the second character set. (The notation for 
string variable names to the opposite effect on page 137 of the Applesoft 
Reference Manual is in error in this regard.) 

The next two bytes, $(X) and $0A, are the high and low order bytes 
for the value 10. You have probably noticed that integer variables are 
stored in a very simple way, with the value being broken down into the 
low and high order bytes. About the only peculiar item is the fact that the 
two bytes are stored high order byte first, which is backward from the 
way we normally see them paired in most machine language code. 

The three remaining bytes are unused. 

$80A to $80F is where the real variable A is stored. You can see that 
the first two bytes again make up the name characters, this time with the 
high bits set. The remaining bytes make up the value for the variable A. 

It should be obvious that although the values of the integer and real 
variables are stored as equal, the manner in which they are stored is not. 
The real variable has been encoded into a five-byte sequence, the logic 
behind which is not readily apparent. Well, don't despair; it is not ac- 
tually necessary for us to understand the exact details of the conversion 
routine. 

In general, it will suffice to say that an exponential notation is used to 
store the number. This is how numbers of such large magnitudes (+/— 
10^38) are accommodated by Applesoft. If you rouse some of your 
more ancient high school memories, you'll recall that the basic idea to ex- 
ponents is that any number can be expressed with two numbers, the ex- 
ponent and the mantissa. 

For example, the number 10 is equal to 10 A]. The number 100 is 
equal to 10^2. It is reasonable to assume, then, that a number like 50 
might just happen to be equal to 10^1.5. As it happens, that's not quite 
right, but the basic idea is there. In fact, 50 is really equal to 10 a 1.69897 
(or thereabout). The 1 part of the number is called the exponent (or oc- 
casionally the order of magnitude) of the number. The 69897 is called the 
mantissa. You may have fond memories of spending pleasant hours in 
math classes looking through books with look-up tables to find these 
values for given numbers. 

In any event, it's precisely this type of technique that is used to en- 
code the values of real variables. Fortunately for us, it will not be neces- 
sary to create our own routines to handle numbers in this format, since a 
wealth of such routines already exists in Applesoft. 

The remainder of this article will concentrate on some brief exercises 
in passing floating point numbers back and forth between Applesoft and 
machine language. Then in upcoming articles we'll explore how to per- 
form various mathematical operations once your machine language pro- 
gram has possession of the data. 

The Floating Point Accumulator (FAC). Applesoft has its own in- 
ternal set of registers that it uses during its various calculations. The most 
important of these by far is the floating point accumulator. This is usual- 
ly labeled FAC in source listings that access this register. 

The word register is used in a slightly different way here than it is 
when referring to 6502 registers such as the accumulator or the X or Y 
registers. Because a floating point number is represented by a series of 
bytes, the FAC occupies the bytes from $9D through $A2. 

You may be puzzled as to why the FAC uses six bytes when variable 
storage uses only five. This is because the FAC uses $A2 as the sign byte to 
indicate the positive or negative status of the value. When finally en- 
coded, the sign is included in the exponent and mantissa bytes and thus is 
no longer needed. Floating point numbers in the five-byte format are 
said to be "packed." The six-byte format is "unpacked." The unpacked 
format is faster for the calculation operations. The packed format is used 
to minimize storage space. 

In general, whenever any type of calculation is done by Applesoft, 
the FAC is the primary register used to hold the result. A second regis- 
ter, ARG (for Argument), is used for two- value calculations, such as 
1.5 X 17. ARG uses the bytes $A5 through $AA. For the time being, 
though, we need only concern ourselves with FAC. 

Passing Data from Applesoft to the FAC. The first area to investi- 



NOVEMBER 1982 



117 



gate is how to get a floating point number passed from Applesoft to a 
machine language routine. The easiest way is by means of the USR func- 
tion. The USR is a rather neglected part of Applesoft, probably because 
of the lack of documentation on its nature and applications. A program 
statement using USR might look something like this: 

10 X = USR (Y) 

When this statement is executed, three things happen. 

First, the expression or variable within the parentheses is evaluated 
and the result put in the FAC. 

Second, a call to location 10 ($0A) is done. This is equivalent to a call 
10 in Applesoft. There is a three-byte jump instruction at location $0A. It 
is assumed that the user has inserted the location of an existing machine 
language routine. For example, the code J MP $300 might be found at 
$0A. The program would then jump to $300 to execute whatever routine 
the user might have put there. 

Third, when the user routine eventually does an RTS, the contents of 
the FAC are assigned to the variable to the left of the equal sign. 

For example, type in and run this program: 

10 POKE 10,0 

20 Y = 10 

30 X = USR(Y) 

When run, the program should fall into the Monitor. Then type in: 

9D.A2 (return) 

You should get: 

9D- 84 AO 00 
AO- 00 00 00 

This is the same data we saw for the value 10 when examining the 
real variable storage. Here's what happened Line 10 set location $0A to 
a BRK. When the USR function was called, it put the sequence for 10 in 



the FAC and then called $0A as expected. Since this was a break, we 
went into the Monitor and could then immediately examine the FAC. 

It is not possible to set the FAC from Applesoft and then to verify 
the status of the FAC by entering the Monitor with the usual call- 151. 
Since the FAC will be used in calculating the value of -151, any prior 
data would be overwritten. 

While you're in the Monitor, let's set up $0A for our next experi- 
ment. Type in: 

OA: 4C 00 03 (return) 

This will set the vector to point at location $300. Now create a trivial 
program (in this case, an immediate RTS) at $300 by typing 

300: 60 (return) 

Now return to Applesoft and enter and run this program: 

10 Y = 10 . T-gi 

20 X = USR(Y) fef 
30 PRINT X V 

You should get the number 10 printed out. If you consider what 
we've discussed so far, it should be apparent why. The value 10 held by Y 
was passed to the FAC by the USR function. When our "routine" at 
$300 was called, the FAC remained unchanged. Upon return from our 
routine, the FAC (still equal to 10) was assigned to the variable X. 

Although the USR function is a convenient way of passing data, it is 
rather limited in terms of syntax. If you wanted to pass a number of pa- 
rameters to a routine, another technique would be required. You may re- 
call from previous issues a routine called FRMNUM (for Formula Nu- 
meric evaluator — $DD67) that we used to evaluate variables being 
passed to machine language routines. After calling FRMNUM, 
GETADR ($E752 — Get Address) was used to convert the number to a 
two-byte integer LINNUM ($51, $52— Line Number). 

Well, since what we want is the FAC, we've already got the solution:

($B8,B9 — Textpointer) past the comma following the 768. Line 15 then 
calls FRMNUM, which evaluates the variable or expression following 
the comma and puts the result in the FAC. Line 16 then does the BRK 
to leave us in the Monitor, from which we can check the FAC to verify 
that the correct value has been stored. 

We have now, then, two techniques for passing data from Applesoft 
to the FAC. The first is to use the USR function (being sure, of course, to 
set up the vector at $0A). The second is to use FRMNUM ($DD67) to 
evaluate the expression or variable as part of a parameter list following a 
call statement. 

Moving FAC to a Memory Location. Since the FAC is so heavily 
used, it is sometimes helpful to move the data in the FAC to another lo- 
cation for use later. In Applesoft, this is most often a temporary register 
or an actual variable. For now, let's see if we can move the data to an ar- 
bitrary location.

"I can do nothing for the men who will not bring nne his problems." 

More than two thousand years ago the Chinese philosopher Confucius taught his simple truths about life 
in pointed stories and clever aphorisms. But with all his wisdom and wit, Confucius could only help those 
willing to help themselves. 

For the past two years, the novice assembly language programmer has found wisdom in the writings of 
Roger Wagner. Unfortunately, not everyone has been able to follow Wagner's work from the beginning. 



Now you can help yourself to become a better assembly programmer with Assembly Lines: The Book, a 
compilation of the first fifteen installments of Wagner's "Everyone's Guide to Assembly Language," pub- 
lished in SoHalk from October 1980 to December 1981. 

Complementing the fifteen updated and expanded columns, Wagner has added new material to benefit 
the novice and experienced programmer alike. Five appendices, an index, and an introduction help 
make Assembly Lines: The Book one of the best treatments of the subject. 

$19.95 gets you more than 270 pages of graphs, listings, and exercises. Assembly Lines: The Book is 
available at finer computer stores across the country or directly from Softalk. If you order from Soffalk, 
please add $1.50 for shipping and handling.

der bytes of the address to be used as the data source for the FAC. (Note 
that there is a difference here. MOVMF uses X and Y; MOVFM uses X 
and A!) 



BASIC->FAC 
HI BYTE 
LO BYTE 
FAC-->MEM 



The key to this technique is a routine in Applesoft called MOVMF 
($EB2B — Move to Memory from FAC), which takes the value in FAC 
and moves it to the location pointed to by the Y and X registers (X,Y = 
low byte, high byte). 

The listing given here uses our previous FRMNUM technique to get 
a predictable number into the FAC. TheX and Y registers are then load- 
ed to point to $380. When MOVMF is called, the contents of the FAC 
will be deposited there. 

To see this, run the program, then enter the Monitor and type in: 

380.384 (return) 

You should get: 

380- 84 20 00 00 00 

This proves that we have successfully moved the data from FAC to 
an arbitrary place in memory. 

Moving Memory into the FAC. The converse of this operation is ac- 
complished in much the same way. In this case, the Applesoft routine 
MOVFM ($EAF9 — Move to FAC from Memory) is used. It requires 
that the Y register and accumulator be loaded with the high and low or-

SLIP INTO SOMETHING COMFORTABLE. . . 

The BnSI^(Yp^f n Computer Station! 



The BASIC COMFORT II computer station puts everything in an orderly, 
productive arrangement for the operator. A multi-shelf design: the 
first shelf supports disk drives, CRT, and a small printer. It 
features a unique work area approx. 15"x25"; the second shelf 
places the keyboard at a comfortable typing level and by sliding 
the keyboard forward takes advantage of the "dust cover" 
which the first shelf provides; the third shelf located in the 
knee hole area is for additional work storage. Proper venting 
is built in with adequate area for ribbon and wire hidden from 
sight in the knee hole area. A 2" opening at the bottom of the 
back allows easy access to wall outlets. Finished on all sides for 
use as a free-standing station, in a choice of walnut or light oak 
high pressure mica laminate, the BASIC COMFORT II is a rugged

program, preferably into the variable of our choice? Again, the answer is 
to use the MOVMF routine. In this case, rather than moving the con- 
tents of the FAC into an arbitrary memory location, we'll find the loca- 
tion of the data bytes of a given real variable and then move the FAC 
into them. This has the effect of setting the variable equal to the contents 
of the FAC.

This routine again assumes that the floating point data for the num- 
ber 10 still exists at $380. When this routine is run, lines 16 through 18 
duplicate the previous listing to move the floating point data from $380 
through $384 into the FAC. 

Line 20 uses CHKCOM to check the comma and move TXTPTR to 
the first character past the comma. Line 21 uses the PTRGET ($DFE3 — 
Pointer Get routine) to locate the variable currently pointed to by 
TXTPTR. PTRGET is handy also in that it will create the variable in the 
variable table if it does not already exist. PTRGET returns with the Y 
register and accumulator pointing to the data bytes of the specified vari- 
able. This will be precisely where we want the data in the FAC to be 
moved to. The only correction to be made is in regard to the fact that 
MOVMF requires that the Y and X registers (rather than Y and the ac- 
cumulator as was left by PTRGET) hold the destination address. Line 22 
solves this by the TAX command, at which point MOVMF is called. 
We're now done, and the RTS will return to the calling program. 

Test this routine with the following listing: 



10 CALL 768,X 
20 PRINT X 



X gets set to 10 by having our routine transfer the floating point data 
from $380 through $384 to the data bytes for the variable X. 

Putting It All Together. For a real test of these combined tech- 
niques, let's see if we can successfully pass data from Applesoft to the 
FAC to a memory block and then back to the FAC and back to Apple- 
soft. The following routine should demonstrate the entire operation as an 
overall example of the ideas presented thus far.

Notice that since the USR function calls the routine with the FAC al- 
ready loaded with the value for Y, the first section of the previous rou- 
tine is not needed. Also, since the USR function will automatically as- 
sign the contents of the FAC to the variable X, the last section of the pre- 
vious routine is not needed. 

The calling program for the routine would look like this: 

10 POKE 11,0: POKE 12,3: REM SET UP USR VECTOR 

20 Y = 10 

30 X = USR(Y) 

40 PRINT X : REM SHOULD PRINT '10' 

Conclusion. By now you probably feel fairly comfortable with the 
idea of the floating point accumulator (FAC) and how data can be 
moved about between Applesoft and machine language. Next month 
we'll begin looking at some of the more sophisticated routines Applesoft 
uses to perform the various arithmetic fimctions. See you then!

dation grant he received early in 1980, Pillsbury 
has just seen the first fruit of a project that has 
occupied much of his spare time for nearly three 
years. He has just paged through the first print- 
ed copy of his new book. 

Setting the Scene. A professor of econom- 
ics at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, Dr. 
Pillsbury began writing about computers and 
accounting in the late sixties. In 1970, he pub- 
lished two textbooks for South-Western Pub- 
lishing Company, the first intended for the non- 
majors college course, the second for the first 
course at the high school level. 

The computers Pillsbury wrote about in the 
early seventies came from corporations like 
IBM, Burroughs, Honeywell, and Control 
Data and were, of course, of the mainframe va- 
riety. Because his books met a real need, both 
were quite successful, selling well and seeing 
three editions in the years that followed. 

But times are changing, and so are comput- 
ers. Fittingly, Pillsbury's most recent book, 
written with the assistance of William Ripper- 
ger and also published by South-Westem, bears 
the title Microcomputer-Oriented Accounting: A 
CAI Approach. Intended for use in a high 
school introductory course in financial ac- 
counting, the newly released volume is accom- 
panied by software that runs on the Apple II. 
The college-level text, scheduled for publica- 
tion next spring, will also come with Apple- 
compatible software. 

Both publishing projects began because 
South-Western and Pillsbury believed that mi- 
cros would play a significant role in education 
in the future. The plan was to adapt the basic 
course material to take advantage of the micro- 
computer's flexibility, menu-driven programs, 
and other special features. 

The Apple Education grant that was award- 
ed to Pillsbury's project in March of 1980 
helped to make this possible. The grant took the 
form of equipment — a 32K Apple II Plus, two 
disk drives, a monitor, and a printer. Pillsbury 
already had a contract from South-Western to 
do the new project; all he had needed was the 
equipment that would enable him to move 
ahead. (The equipment is also used by others in 
the economics department.) 

Working Together. The traditional ac- 
counting course, which has been offered for 
many years, has been altered for the last twelve 
years by the use of computers. Students who 
study this material learn to journalize, post, and 
do various kinds of balances. They also pre- 



pare worksheets and balance sheets, do cost ac- 
counting, and do interest accounting (figuring 
such things as simple interest, compound inter- 
est, present value of an annuity, and so on). 

The text of Pillsbury's Microcomputer-Ori- 
ented Accounting is designed so that chapters 
can be studied in any order. It is intended to 
take students "step by step through a financial 
accounting course." The programs on disk are 
menu-driven, and there's room on each disk for 
fifty students to store one set of data, ten stu- 
dents to store five sets of data, or any equiva- 
lent combination. Data stored on disk can be 
recalled, altered, or added to. 

As many authors and editors will attest, it's 
no simple matter to create a learning package 
that really teaches the material it's intended to 
cover. The task requires the effort, expertise, 
and cooperation of many people. In the case at 
hand, author and publisher had the advantage 
of being able to draw on their experiences work- 
ing together on other books. 

In addition, the agreement between South- 
western and Apple Computer called for the 
materials to be class-tested in various high 
schools and to be revised in response to the cri- 
tiques received. South-Western made arrange- 
ments to test the package in four high schools. 
This ensured that author and pubUsher would 
receive feedback from teachers and students 
who had actually used the book and its accom- 
panying software in various stages of develop- 
ment. 

Pillsbury says that the feedback they re- 
ceived made a real difference in the final prod- 
uct. Participating teachers and students filled 
out a questionnaire prepared by Pillsbury, and, 
to learn firsthand what kinds of experiences 
people were having with the package, Pillsbury 
visited each of the high school classes twice dur- 
ing the year. 

So what did teachers and students have to 
say? Well, one initial reaction, which Pillsbury 
says came as a bit of a surprise, was that the 
computer was doing too much. At first, for in- 
stance, the program was set up so that the com- 
puter closed the books automatically. Experi- 
enced accountants would have welcomed such 
an arrangement as a real time saver. But for 
high school students it was all wrong — they 
would never learn how to close the books them- 
selves. So the program was revised. 

The matter of worksheet preparation pro- 
vided a similar lesson to the creators of the 
package. The program had originally been set 
up to prepare a complete worksheet automati- 
cally, but, as it turned out, a much better ar- 



rangement was for students to prepare a por- 
tion of the worksheets themselves. Once again, 
what would have been handy for professionals 
was not right for novices — it would have taken 
away too much of the learning experience stu- 
dents needed. 

Little Big Difference. Asked what differ- 
ences he sees between using micros in the class- 
room versus working with the larger comput- 
ers, Pillsbury is reminded of the first time the 
University of Puerto Rico asked him to come 
there and help teachers learn to use computers 
in the classroom. 

"At that time, we had to bring two large 
boxes with four thousand IBM cards in them. 
This year," he reports, appreciatively, "we will 
bring one diskette for the Apple. The disk will 
have more information on it than the four thou- 
sand cards did." 

Chances are that students and teachers who 
get the opportunity to use the Apple in an ac- 
counting class will soon have their own stories 
to tell about the advantages the microcomputer 
offers. 

In Capsule Form. Let's look now at some 
more companies that produce educational soft- 
ware for the Apple. 

Developmental Learning Materials, One DLM 

Park, Allen, TX 75002; (214) 248-6300. 

DLM produces the Arcademic Skill Build- 
ers in Math series, six programs for learning ba- 
sic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and di- 
vision skills. The programs are drill and prac- 
tice but with a difference — they have sound, col- 
or, and graphics designed to give them the ap- 
peal of arcade games. 

Although the programs can be used sepa- 
rately, they are actually intended to be a "total 
approach to building essential mathematics 
skills." The series includes Alien Addition, Mi- 
nus Mission, Meteor Multiplication, Demolition 
Division, Alligator Mix, and Dragon Mix. 

Each of the games has a different theme but 
the same basic objective — you must eliminate 
the problems that are coming at you by firing 
the correct answers at them before it's too late. 
Each game has three different skill levels and 
nine different speeds. Paddles or sets of desig- 
nated keys can be used in playing the games. 

A central premise in the design of these pro- 
grams is motivation. Motivation can be an espe- 
cially important factor in promoting learning 
that involves drill and practice. Students are 
likely to learn better and to spend more time on 
learning if they feel motivated and engaged than 
if they feel bored or if they beUeve that some- 
thing is beneath them. According to the com- 



128 

pany, young people in grades two through 
eleven have used these materials successfully. 
Field testing has shown that students using the 
programs learned rapidly and were highly 
motivated. 

Programs can be purchased separately or as 
part of the complete package. Each individual 
program is accompanied by a teacher's manual 
that explains how to set up individualized learn- 
ing plans for each student and various other in- 
structional components. Included are an in- 
struction sheet, reproducible master work- 
sheets and record sheets, and fifty-two four-col- 
or flashcards that contain the game's problems 
and match its motif. The record sheets include a 
sheet to be used by the student in recording per- 
formance, a progress chart to be used for re- 
cording goals and charting progress over a ten- 
week period, and a strategies for improvement 
sheet on which to record specific plans for help- 
ing individual students improve their skills. 

Six new programs, Arcademic Skill Builders 
in Language Arts, are scheduled for January re- 
lease. 

Right On Programs, Box 977, Huntington, NY 
1 1743; (516) 271-3177. 

As former high school English teacher Don 
Feinstein explains. Right On Programs was 
formed two years ago "out of need" and some- 
what by accident. 

Don's wife, Barbara, an elementary school 
librarian, had access to a school computer but 



T A I V 



NOVEMBER 1982 



almost no software for it. After thinking about 
the kinds of library skills she wanted to help 
kids learn, Barbara asked their then high school 
age son whether he could program some soft- 
ware to her specifications. He agreed to give it a 
try, and the program that resulted from their 
collaboration soon caught the attention of other 
librarians in the district. When a number of 
them wanted to buy that first program, a small 
company was born. 

This pattern of seeing a need and respond- 
ing to it has been repeated many times now. At 
present, the company offers 130 software pro- 
grams for the Apple. In addition, a series of ele- 
mentary school language arts programs will be 
released around the first of the year. 

For students in elementary school, the com- 
pany has programs in library skills, social stud- 
ies, science, and math. The programs are de- 
signed by teachers, programmed by program- 
mers, and tested by young people in various 
parts of the country. Don Feinstein stresses how 
valuable children's input is — it lets the com- 
pany know what they should be doing, what 
they may have missed, and to what level a pro- 
gram should be geared. 

The library programs cover such areas as 
the Dewey decimal system, understanding and 
using the card catalog, locating books on the 
shelf, understanding the title page, and using an 
index. Two library management programs — 
one for dealing with overdue books, the other

Social studies titles include Farm Life, a pro- 
gram that introduces elementary school stu- 
dents to the basic concepts of farms, farm ani- 
mals, and farm products; Community Helpers, a 
discussion of community services and the peo- 
ple who provide them; and Who Built America, 
a program about why people came to this coun- 
try, what they brought, and what they 
contributed. 

Among the science offerings are programs 
on the solar system, light, electricity, matter, 
energy, birds, mammals, and insects. Math pro- 
grams cover such areas as basic arithmetic 
skills, math measurements, telling time, and 
dealing with money. The elementary school 
programs are geared to cover information that 
is part of the current curriculum. They can be 
purchased individually or as part of various 
multiprogram packages. 

Secondary school programs include a com- 
prehensive language arts series and a series of 
programs designed to help high school juniors 
improve their skills in preparation for the SAT 
test. 

Vernier Software, 2920 S.W. 89th Street, Port- 
land, OR 97225; (503) 297-5317. 

All nine programs from Vernier Software 
run on the Apple and are designed pri- 
marily for use in introductory level high school 
and college physics courses. Program titles in- 
clude Wave Addition, Projectiles, Vector Addi- 
tion, Kinematics, Charged Particles, and Orbit. 
All programs feature hi-res graphics. 

Wave Addition, for example, employs hi-res 
graphics to demonstrate the superposition of 
waves. Eight different operating modes are 
available; some are preprogrammed to demon- 
strate various principles, while others require 
that the student select the waves to be added. 
The program can be used in the classroom to 
show the relationship between wavelength, fre- 
quency, and wave speed; constructive and de- 
structive interference; and how wave shape is af- 
fected when various overtones are added. It can 
also be used to simulate the shapes of the waves 
produced by the sounds of various musical 
instruments. 

In Projectiles, students get the chance to 
study a projectile's motion under various con- 
ditions. Seven modes are available. This allows 
for launching from the top of a cUff or from 
ground level with or without air resistance and 
with or without horizontal wind. 

The company recently announced the re- 
lease of three new programs — Graphical Analy- 
sis, which plots graphs in hi-res; Precision Tim- 
er; which allows you to use the computer as a 
lab timer that displays times to a tenth of a 
millisecond; and Ray Tracer, which draws ray 
diagrams to illustrate the principles of geo- 
metrical optics. Ray Tracer can be used to il- 
lustrate concepts in an optics lesson or as an 
educational game to help students learn to an- 
ticipate how the optical devices and interfaces 
that a ray encounters will affect it. 

All of Vernier's programs are written by 
company founder David L. Vernier, an experi- 
enced physics teacher. All have been field-test-

ed and modified to take the feedback received 
into account. 

Each program's documentation includes a 
user guide for students and a teacher's manual 
containing background information and sug- 
gestions about how to use the program in the 
classroom. The programs have been left unpro- 
tected, and Applesoft program listings, with 
special notes explaining program operation, are

Review of Delta Drawing. Designed espe- 
cially for youngsters ages four through twelve, 
this easy-to-use, class-tested program turns the 
computer screen into a drawing board. Because 
of the way the commands are set up, even chil- 
dren who haven't yet learned to read can use 
Delta Drawing once they've learned to associ- 
ate the correct letters with the correct com- 
mands. 

Delta Drawing teaches young learners about 
lines, shapes, and colors. They'll become more 
adept at recognizing patterns and thinking 
visually. In the process, the program introduces 
children pleasurably to the kind of deliberate, 
step-by-step approach that is required for solv- 
ing problems on the computer. 

The orientation of Delta Drawing'?, creators 
is refreshing. They stress the value of explora- 
tion, rather than concern with right and 
wrong answers. As the manual puts it, in Delta 
Drawing, "There are no mistakes, only unex- 
pected results." 

The program requires 48K and works best 
with a color monitor or television set. This al- 
lows the user to draw in green, blue, orange, 
and purple in addition to white. Shapes can al- 
so be colored in or a background color can be 
added as a finishing touch to a child's elaborate 
"creation." 

Drawings are created by means of logically 
named single-keystroke commands. Each com- 
mand controls a single, separate function. 

The drawing instrument is the delta cursor, 
a small pointer similar to the Logo turtle, whose 
start state is the center of the screen. The cursor 
has two attributes, position and heading. Posi- 
tion refers to where the cursor is on the screen; 
heading refers to the direction it's going. The 
cursor's voice (a beep tone that can be turned 
off) lets the user know that a command has 
been "heard" and acted on. 

The commands that a young learner will 
start out using include D for drawing a line of 
fixed length on the screen; M for moving to 
various locations on the screen without draw- 
ing anything; L, R, and U for turning the cur- 
sor left or right (in thirty-degree increments) and 
executing a U-turn; and E, the erase command. 

With a bit of assistance from a parent, a 
teacher, or an older child, a small child can 
learn to use the half-draw and half-move com- 
mands (which involve using the control key) 
and the color commands. 

Several qualities make Delta Drawing more 
than and different from a sketch pad or color- 
ing book. To begin with, the delta cursor re- 



SOU ATTT^ 

members what it draws, and it records this in- 
formation in the form of a simple drawing pro- 
gram. Pressing T for text reveals a program list- 
ing showing what sequence of commands pro- 
duced a particular shape. G returns to graphic 
mode. 

Being able to toggle with single keystrokes 
makes it easy to see the relationship between 
pictures on the screen and the step-by-step pro- 
grams that create them. And understanding this 
relationship opens up a whole new way of mak- 
ing pictures — creating a program in text first 
and then viewing the results in graphic form. 

There are, in all, thirty-five command keys 
and eight types of commands, including those 
for drawing and editing, for storing and execut- 
ing programs created by the user, for color and 
display, for prinUng, for system manipulation, 
and for repeating action. It's great that the pro- 
gram offers all these capabilities, and it's also 
nice that a child can enjoy using the program 
without needing to know about many of them. 

The keys for numbers one through nine can 
be used for storing that many drawing pro- 
grams in memory at once. These programs can 
be recalled and reused throughout one session. 
It's also easy to nest programs within one an- 
other to create more elaborate designs or more 
complex illustrations. 

The pictures and designs a user creates can 
be saved on a data disk. Picture files can be re- 
loaded at later sessions to be worked with some 
more or to be shared with a user's admiring 
friends. A Centronics parallel printer can be 
used to print out the text of a drawing pro- 
gram, while an Epson with the Grappler inter- 
face card makes it possible to print out both 
program text and pictures. 

Certain things about this program take 
some getting used to. It's important to realize, 
for example, that the delta cursor always begins 
drawing from its current position and heading. 
This means that when a stored program is exe- 
cuted the result may differ from the way the 
drawing looked originally. This is because the 
cursor's position and heading when the pro- 
gram is called differ from its start position when 
the program was created. 

And, as good as this program is, it has its 
limitations. Some of these, such as a jagged, 
striped effect you get when you put certain col- 
ors next to each other, can be traced to the idio- 
syncracies of the Apple's hi-res graphics. 

Learning to take advantage of the pro- 
gram's more complicated features — such as the 
capacity to edit one's own drawings and pro- 
grams — will require time and effort, even on the 
part of an older user. Nor will the program turn 
a child into a great artist; but, then, that's not its 
intent. 

But don't let these factors dissuade you 
from seriously considering this program. Fid- 
dling with Delta Drawing will remind you just 
how exhilarating it can be to explore, experi- 
ment, discover, and create.

When is a house not a house? When it be- 
comes a tire, of course. 

What? How can a house become a tire? 

Simple. When a bug is not a bug. 

If that's one too many riddles for you, stick 
around. Logo has a wonderful way of working 
out puzzles. It's full of possibilities that will 
make you think. 

Brenda is a young mother who recently en- 
rolled in a beginning Logo class. Her son is in 
kindergarten and is a member of the Young 
Peoples' Logo Association. Brenda became fas- 
cinated with the Logo language and wanted to 
learn more about it, both for her own benefit 
and to be able to work with her child. 

As might be expected, adults learn Logo 
much the same way children do, by means of 
lots of experimenting. After using the initial ran- 




dom commands, you find yourself wanting to 
"make something" — a defined shape. The logi- 
cal sequence is to move on to a triangle and 
then to put a triangle and a square together to 
make a simple house. To make a suburb, you 
simply repeat HOUSE a certain number of 
times. Thus, each step builds logically on the 
step before. 

One of the things that makes Logo such a 
powerful tool for children is that it teaches them 
to break problems down into pieces and to 



NOVEMBER 1982 



Perhaps even more powerful is what can 
happen in the imagination when pieces don't do 
"what they're supposed to." That's when the 
"art" of programming comes in — the inspira- 
tion that sends someone down a totally new 
path of discovery and creation. It happened to 
Brenda, and she turned a house into a tire. 

First, Brenda went through the process of 
defining a square and a triangle. Then she put 
them together to make a house. When she had 
one house on the screen, she decided that she'd 




Figure 1. Making a house. 



solve the pieces first. Before they ever try to like to put another one there also, so she typed 
draw a neighborhood, they learn to draw a in the command "HOUSE." The turtle, of 
house. Before they try to draw a house, they course, followed directions. And since Brenda 
learn to draw a square and a triangle. And all had not moved the turtle from its ending posi- 
this is preceded by doodling with simple com- tion on the first house, she wound up with the 
mands and numerical inputs just to see,\/hat new house growing sideways out of the roof of 
will happen. "'the original one. See figure 1. 

A bug? Well, yes, if Brenda had really had 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ her heart set on trying to develop a suburb. But 

to her, the "bug" just presented new possibil- 
ities. She wondered out loud what would hap- 
pen if she just kept repeating HOUSE. She did 
this and when the design was completed, the an- 
gular lines of the squares and triangles had gent- 
ly curved into a circular pattern. To one per- 
son, it looked like a sun, another said it looked 
like a Ferris wheel, and to a third, it was a tire. 
Take a look at figure 2. 

And then, as so often happens, the artist in 
Brenda came out and took over. The conversa- 
tion had turned to auto racing and what had be- 
gun as a simple house procedure turned into a 
TIRE. It wasn't long before TIRE became 
TIRES, and by then it wasn't hard at all to 
visualize a custom-made sports car to fit on 
such stylish tires. See figure 3. 

And thus the bug was not a bug and the 
house was not a house. Not anymore.

Word Geometry. The turtle isn't the only 
feature of Logo that can be used to make geo- 
metric figures. Some of the list processing fea- 
tures can also be used to make a variety of dif- 
ferent shapes. Rena Upitis, of Queen's Univer- 
sity in Ontario, Canada, submitted a procedure 
to make a triangle using BUTFIRST. 
BUTLAST can also be used. In fact, if you 
want to print out some graphic shapes, com- 
bine the two commands. 

Here's one way to make a word triangle: 



TO WORDTRIANGLE :STRING 
.PRINTER 1 

IF :STRING = " [STOP] 
PRINT :STRING 

WORDTRIANGLE BUTFIRST :STRING 
END 

The first two lines set up the procedure. 
First, output is directed to the printer through 
slot 1 . Then the conditional statement says that 
if : STRING is equal to " then STOP. 

The : STRING is then printed by the next 
line. The last line then tells the program to 
repeat but without the first element of 
iSTRING. Here's what happens:

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? 



Are you tired of waiting for DOS to 
load and save files? Are you tired of 
waiting for DOS to finish so you can 
type again? Are you tired of waiting 
for your printer? When you buy 
Diversi-DOS^", you won't have to 
wait any more! Here's why: 

1. DOS speed-up: Apple DOS 3.3 
takes 18 disk revolutions to read a 
single track, whereas Diversi-DOS 
reads or writes a track in just 2 
revolutions. This speeds up file pro- 
cessing tremendously (see table). 

2. Keyboard Buffer: Diversi-DOS 
allows you to type at any time, as 
fast as you can, without missing a 
single character. 



APPLE DOS DIVERSI-DOS 

SAVE t 27.1 sec. 5.9 sec. 

LOAD t 19.2 sec. 4.5 sec. 

BSAVE* 13.6 sec. 4.1 sec. 

BLOAD* 9.5 sec. 2.6 sec. 

READ** 42.2 sec. 12.4 sec. 

WRITE** 44.6 sec. 14.9 sec. 

* Hi-res screen t 80-sector BASIC program 
** 52-sector random access text file 



3. Print Buffer: Diversi-DOS can use 
a RAM card (16K-128K) to temporari- 
ly save characters before they are 
printed. Thus, your computer won't 
have to wait for your printer to 
finish. 

Diversi-DOS, the TRIPLE utility, re- 
quires a 48K Apple II or ll-i- with 
DOS 3.3. A simple, menu-driven in- 
stallation program is included on 
the un-protected disk. So what are 
you waiting for?

A tATItFIED CUiTOMER 

Sandy Smith is one of many who've found Softdisk to be an exciting phenomenon in the Apple 
world. She wrote a letter and told us so: 

"In the current (September) issue, you published my 'Ask' about reading and 4^ 
changing text files that have already been created. In today's mail there arrived a disk 
from Dave Garson, the head of the Political Science Department of the School of 
Humanities and Social Sciences at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. It contains 
a whole bunch of useful text file utilities, tutorials, and demos (all public domain). It's just 
what I needed! If I weren't a So/fc//s>f subscriber, I would hever have been able to get 
these programs. . . . And the speed of the response was really unbelievable. 

"Have you ever figured out why the subscribers send in programs? It certainly isn't 
for the money, because there isn't any! ' 

"Keep up the good work." ■^^c' „

NOVEMBER 1982 



SOFTCARD 
Symposium 

by Greg Xlbbelts 



Welcome to the November edition of SoftCard Symposium. This 
month we'll continue our in-depth reexamination of the CP/M opera- 
ting system as implemented on the SoftCard. Specifically, we'll begin a 
step-by-step examination of the booting process: what comprises it, how 
it works, and so on. Last month we got a brief overview of the subject in 
the context of describing the complete system; now we'll get down to 
details. 

In CP/M, the booting process is broken down into two distinct 
types, a cold boot process and a warm boot process. These processes are 
then broken down even further into single modules, each of which com- 
pletes a subprocess that's necessary to bringing up the system. Since these 
modules are themselves made up of routines with their own individual 
functions, our definition of what constitutes a module and our explana- 
tion of why we treat a particular collection of routines as a module may 
sometimes seem arbitrary. However, in each case it will become appar- 
ent that the module defined is capable of operating more or less inde- 
pendently as a single unit, while the individual routines that form a par- 
ticular module are dependent on one another to perform their functions. 
Treating these modules in their chronological sequence offers the clear- 
est means of describing them since, in many cases, those modules that ex- 
ecute later on in the booting process are totally dependent on the ones 
that precede them. 

In order, then, the modules are: 

1. Apple Disk II controller boot ROM 

2. boot sector 

3. cold loader and Z-80 finder 

4. warm loader 

5. Z-80 cold boot code 

6. Z-80 warm boot code 

These names are intended to be descriptive only and aren't necessarily 
recognized officially. We will examine each of the modules in order. This 
month, so as to cover the subject in proper detail, we'll consider only the 
6502 modules, items 1 through 4. We'll save the Z-80 modules for De- 
cember's column. 

Sweet Little Sixteen. The first module is the standard boot ROM on 
the Disk II controller card. Note that we'll deal only with the sixteen-sec- 
tor version of this ROM because it is the latest and the most widely used. 
In this version of the ROM, the Apple disk is divided into thirty-five 
tracks of sixteen sectors each. Each sector contains 256 bytes of usable 
data that have been translated into 342 specially encoded disk bytes. As 
the disk spins under the read/write head of the disk drive, a separate 
ROM, called a state machine, reads and writes the actual bits stored on the 
disk. The translation of encoded disk bytes to usable data bytes and vice 
versa is handled by software that accesses the state machine when more 
data is ready to be read or written. 

The theory of operation of the state machine is complex and beyond 
our scope in this case. Luckily, though, we can treat the state machine as 
a "black box," such that when the software calls for an encoded disk 
byte, the state machine supplies it from the disk. Conversely, when the 
software wishes an encoded byte written, it passes the byte to the state 
machine and the state machine writes it to the disk. 

Besides reading and writing disks, the state machine controls the disk 



drive motor that spins the disk and the stepper motor that moves the 
head from track to track — all in response to software commands. Note 
that all of the actual work is done by the state machine, whether it's op- 
erating under the control of software in the computer's memory or under 
the control of the software in the boot ROM on the controller. 

Meet Your Mapper. The communication required to pass bytes 
back and forth and activate the various mechanical disk processes 
through the state machine is handled in the manner described last month 
as memory-mapped I/O. In this system, external devices have access to 
the lines comprising the computer's address bus, and the circuitry is de- 
signed in such a way that when the computer reads or writes certain 
memory locations, it is in fact communicating with the external device. 
Each slot, except slot 0, is allocated one 256-byte page of memory in the 
SClOO to $C7FF memory range. The address of this range is $C«00 to 
$C«FF where n is the slot number. 

In addition to that page of memory addresses, sixteen more ad- 
dresses are allocated to each slot (including slot 0) in the $C080 to SCOFF 
range, such that $C080 to $C08F are for slot 0, $C090 to $C09F are for 
slot 1, and so on. How these 272 memory locations are used by a peri- 
pheral is up to the designer of the card. In the case of the Disk II con- 
troller, the page of addresses is used simply as memory (in this case, read- 
only memory) corresponding to the 256 bytes contained in the boot 
ROM. The other sixteen locations, however, are used as control ad- 
dresses for the state machine. Accessing one of the control addresses for 
the slot occupied by the controller causes the state machine to perform a 
function. For example, turning the drive motor on requires an access of 
address $C089-f-Sfj0 where n is the slot number. For slot 6, this address is 
$C0E9. There are sixteen such functions for the state machine activated 
by means of the sixteen control addresses assigned to the slot. 

Head of State. The boot ROM itself is comprised of 251 bytes of 
6502 machine code. Its primary function is to operate the state machine 
and read track 0, sector 0, into memory page $08 ($800 to $8FF). Parts 
of the boot ROM can also be used as a general-purpose disk-read sub- 
routine, as we will see a little later. 

When executed from the beginning, the boot ROM first builds a 
table of values in memory page $03 that are needed to decode the disk 
data bytes read by the state machine. Next, by calling the address of an 
RTS instruction in the Monitor ROM and then looking at the return ad- 
dress created on the stack, the boot ROM determines the slot in which 
the controller card is located. That information is necessary before any 
activity can be performed with the disk drive. This is so, of course, be- 
cause the control addresses for the state machine are slot-dependent. 

Once the table has been set up and the slot determined, the boot 
ROM module proceeds to initialize the state machine. Among other 
things, it enables drive 1, turns on the drive motor, waits for the motor to 
come up to speed, and recalibrates the read/write head position by seek- 
ing track 0 (against the mechanical stop) several times. This latter opera- 
tion causes the rattling sound you hear on boot-up. 

Once everything is in readiness, the boot ROM starts reading bytes 
from the disk, using the state machine. It checks for the pattern of bytes 
that indicates the start of a sector address field — that portion of the sec- 
tor that indicates which of the thirty-five possible tracks and sixteen pos-

sible sectors it is. As the boot ROM finds each address field, it loads the 
bytes corresponding to track and sector numbers and compares them 
with the values of the track and sector being sought. The values it com- 
pares the disk data against are not in the ROM at this point but are kept 
in temporary locations in memory page $00, which it initialized at the be- 
ginning of the ROM. This is an important point since, if these tempora- 
ries are set to some other value and the beginning of the ROM is by- 
passed, this same code can be used to load tracks and sectors other 
than 0. 

Once the appropriate sector of the disk is found, in this case, 
sector 0, byte after byte is loaded from the data field of the sector and 
translated using the table in memory page $03. As each byte is trans- 
lated, it is written to a page of memory whose value is contained in still 
another temporary location. This location was initialized in the begin- 
ning of the ROM to $08 so that sector 0 will load from $0800 to $08FF. 
After this sector has been loaded, the temporary location containing the 
load address page is incremented and the byte now stored at $0800 is 
checked. This byte, which was the first one on the disk, indicates to the 
boot ROM how many sectors to load before ceasing operation. With 
SoftCard, this value is 01, meaning load the single sector at $0800 and 
then exit. On exit, the boot ROM always branches to location $0801 to 
continue execution. Location $0801 marks the beginning of our next 
module. 

Sector Skewing Speeds Things Up. Module number two, which 
we've named the boot sector, consists of forty-five bytes of 6502 code and 
sixteen bytes of data. The data bytes in this case are a sector interleave 
table. The term interleaving, also called sector skewing, describes a proc- 
ess whereby sectors on the disk are not stored in the sequence they will be 
read. This is done because the software is seldom fast enough to process 
all the data just read from the last sector in time to read the next sequen- 
tial sector on the disk as it passes under the head. If sectors were stored 
sequentially, an entire revolution would be required to bring the sector 
back under the head; consequently, only one sector per revolution could 
be read in. When an interleave factor is used, the next sector to be read is 
placed two or more sectors away, allowing time for the software to finish 
its task and be ready to read again when the sector comes by the head. In 
this way, as many as eight sectors can be read on a single revolution, re- 
sulting in a possible eightfold increase in disk access speed. 

There are two types of interleaving, physical interleaving and soft- 
ware interleaving. With physical interleaving, the actual sectors on the 
disk are numbered out of sequence, as in the series: 
0,8, 1 ,9,2, 10,3, 1 1 ,4, 1 2,5, 1 3,6, 14,7, 1 5 
This is an example of a two-sector interleave, and in such interleaving the 
sectors would actually be written in this order during the format process. 
When you want to simplify the code required for reads and writes, this 
method is easiest, since reading a particular sector only requires that the 
software look for the proper sector address mark. 

Double Trouble. Software interleaving is somewhat more compli- 
cated, however, and two sets of numbers must be taken into account 
when dealing with it. First, there are the actual sector numbers appear- 
ing in the address field. This set we'll call the physical sectornumbers. The 
other set of numbers corresponds to the order in which we wish to read 
or write the sectors, and these we'll refer to as logical sector numbers. In 
software interleaving, the physical disk sectors are still sequential on the 
disk, that is: 

0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 
To make it possible to use this method, a table is set up in the program 
that lists the physical sector numbers in the order they have to be read or 
written to correspond to the logical sector numbers. To form a two sec- 
tor interleave, we would have to write first in sector 0, then sector 2, then 
sector 4, sector 6, sector 8, and so on. By making up a table of this se- 
quence, we can use it to tell where to find our appropriate logical sector. 
The table is: 

0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15 
Thus, when we wish to find the fifth logical sector, we look at the fifth 
entry in our table (remember, we begin with zero) and we see that it is 
physical sector 10. Using this method, we can maintain the proper dis- 
tance between logical sectors on the disk, making fast disk access 
possible. 



Apple disk systems to date have used the software interleaving 
method; SoftCard is no exception. In SoftCard CP/M, the first three 
tracks (which contain the system) have an interleave factor of two and 
the interleave table is exactly hke the one just given. Two is a sufficient in- 
terleave factor for the system tracks, since very little processing is done 
between reads just to load those tracks into memory, and therefore only 
a small amount of time between reads is required. The data portion of the 
disk has an interleave factor of three, given that with applications soft- 
ware, the processing required between disk reads is more extensive, re- 
quiring more delay between reads and therefore more separation be- 
tween sectors. 

Move Over, Rover. The code in the boot sector is basically very sim- 
ple. Its function is to load the next nine logical sectors from track 0 into 
memory beginning at SOAOO. It accomplishes this by using the read rou- 
tines in the boot ROM beginning at $C«5C and altering the memory 
page $00 temporary locations used by the boot ROM to store sector 
number and load address values. 

The boot sector module can be kept simple because the boot ROM 
handles all the necessary state machine access and byte translation and 
because the nine sectors are loaded sequentially from $0A00 to $13FF. 
These sectors consist of the Apple RWTS routines ($0A00 to $OFAC), 
which are the much more complex state machine access routines that 
allow us to read and write to the disk. They are the warm loader ($OFAD 
to $OFFC), which will use RWTS to load the remainder of CP/M; the 
cold loader and Z-80 finder ($1000 to $1 188), which is our next module; 
and finally the lOCB ($1200 to $13FF), which will be moved down to 
memory pages $02 and $03 for final use by the system. The IOCS is 
loaded high because loading at memory page $03 is difficult (remember 
this page is used to store the byte translation table the ROM uses when 
reading the disk). At the completion of this nine-sector load, the boot 
sector branches to the cold loader and Z-80 finder at $1000. 

Clean-up Time. The cold loader has several functions, but its 
primary one is to identify the system hardware. This is accomplished by 
examining the contents of the 256-byte page of memory allocated to each 
slot. Before that process begins, however, some housekeeping items are 
taken care of. First, any RAM board in the system is set to a ROM-read, 
RAM-write condition. This means that when the processor attempts to 
read memory in the $D000 to $FFFF range, it will read the ROMs on 
the Apple motherboard; but when attempts to write to this area of mem- 
ory are made, it will write into the RAM on the RAM board. In this 
way, the routines in the Apple Monitor ROM can be executed by this 
and subsequent modules, but, at the same time, if a RAM board is 
present in the Apple, necessary CP/M system data can be written to 
that RAM. 

Next, the drive motor is turned off since no further reads will be done 
using the boot ROM and future disk access will be through RWTS, 
which will control the drive motor itself The third step is to initialize two 
temporary track-pointer values in page $00. These will be used by RWTS 
so that no annoying recalibration of the heads will need to be made on 
the first disk access while RWTS locates the head positions. The fourth 
housekeeping function is to call three subroutines in the Monitor ROM 
at $FB2F, $FE93, and $FE89, in that order. These three routines set and 
initialize text mode, set output to the video screen (PR#0), and set input 
from the keyboard (IN#0), respectively. Fifth, the stack pointer is initial- 
ized to its unused value, clearing any previous items on the stack. At this 
point, everything has essentially been brought to the power-on/reset con- 
dition. Finally, the boot slot value, which has been stored in the pC] reg- 
ister, is checked to ensure that CP/M was booted from slot 6, since Soft- 
Card CP/M makes assumptions based on that premise. If not, the mes- 
sage must boot from slot six is printed to the forty-column screen via the 
Monitor COUT subroutine at $FDED and, when complete, the loader 
branches to the general Monitor entry point at $FF65. If booting did oc- 
cur from slot 6, the loader continues its process. 

Z-80 Shuffle. The loader's next step is to perform several memory 
moves. The first of these is to move a short Z-80 program originally 
loaded from $1 169 to $1 176 to address $1000, overwriting the first part 
of the loader itself. This, of course, is a 6502 address, as are all those 
we've mentioned so far, but it is significant since $1000 to the 6502 is the 
Z-80 address OOOOH. (Note: To avoid confusion, we will continue to

NOVEMBER 1982 



show all 6502 addresses in the form Sxxxx and all Z-80 addresses in the 
form xxxxH.) 

When activated for the first time, the Z-80 always branches immedi- 
ately to location OOOOH . This program is preparation for turning on the 
Z-80 and provides the means for the Z-80 to recover when activated. The 
next two memory moves bring the lOCB down to its final location as we 
saw earlier, and once the moves have been completed, three variables are 
initialized. 

The first of these variables is the lOCB variable at $03B8, which rep- 
resents the number of disk drives in the system. It is initialized to 0 since 
the module will go on to identify dynamically the number of drives (by 
finding the number of controllers and multiplying by two) as part of its 
hardware identification process. The second variable is a page $00 tem- 
porary location we'll call ADDRl which is used in the identification 
process, as we'll see later. It is also set to 0. Finally, the third variable, 
also a page $00 temporary, we'll call FLAGl; this variable is used as an 
indicator of the presence of the Z-80. It, too, will be discussed later, but 
for now it is initialized to 255. 

Ready, Steady, Go ! Now that everything is in the correct place and 
variables have been initialized, the loader begins execution of its Z-80 
finder portion. This general-purpose routine not only finds the Z-80 but 
also identifies all recognizable peripheral cards. The finder starts at slot 7 
and proceeds downward, examining each slot in the same way by sys- 
tematically inspecting various parts of the 256-byte page of addresses 
allocated as I/O area for that slot. 

First, the ADDRl variable and the byte following it (ADDRl 4-1), 
which are used together as a two-byte address vector, are set to the value 
of the first byte of the I/O area. Since ADDRl has already been set to 
00, the finder simply sets ADDRl -I- 1 to the page number of the slot, that 
is, $C/7. 

Its next step is to alter itself, changing the address field of a memory- 
write instruction to the same address that is contained in ADDRl and 
ADDRl -1-1. The finder then attempts to execute the memory-write in- 
struction. If the card in the slot is a SoftCard, this write will activate the 
Z-80, causing it to execute the Z-80 routine we placed at OOOOH earlier. 
That routine performs two functions: first, it changes FLAGl from 255 
to 00; and second, it uses the value at ADDRl -1-1 to perform another 
write to the SoftCard to return control to the 6502, which will pick up 
where it left off in the finder code. At that point, the finder loads the 
value at FLAGl, and if it is 00 rather than 255, it knows it found the 
SoftCard and goes on to place the SoftCard's slot address in two places 
where the system will use it as part of normal operation. If FLAGl is still 
255, then the Z-80 code did not get executed and therefore the card in 
that slot is not a SoftCard. If the SoftCard was found, the finder code 
goes on to the next slot; if not, it continues its examination. 

What's the Slot Got? The next step is to determine whether the slot 
holds any card that contains ROM. This is done by two successive reads 
of all 256 bytes in the slot's I/O space, creating a checksum of the values. 
A checksum is simply some mathematical process performed on a series 
of values that results in a single number. In this case, each byte is added 
to a running total, creating a two-byte sum. 

Doing a checksum of two sets of numbers will show within reason- 
able limits if the individual values are identical. If a ROM is there in the 
slot, both reads will find the same string of values and create the same 
checksum value. If no ROM is present, the values will change from one 
read to the next and create a different checksum. You can verify this 
by using DDT to read an empty slot's I/O space several times. If no ROM is 
found, a value of 00 is placed in the SLTTYP table at $03B9 plus the slot 
number in the lOCB. If ROM is found, the identification continues. 

The next step involves the protocol established by Apple Computer 
for peripheral card manufacturers. It involves looking at the two bytes at 
$C/705 and SCnOl and comparing them to a table of values for various 
types of cards. Disk controllers have values of $03 and $3C respectively, 
Apple Comm cards have values of $18 and $38, Apple parallel printer 
cards have values of $48 and $48, and, finally, Apple serial cards have 
values of $38 and $18. 

Although all of these cards contain firmware (ROM-based soft- 
ware) that can be used to control them, knowing which card you're deal- 
ing with makes it possible to operate the card independent of its firm- 



ware by accessing the control addresses for its hardware components — 
just as RWTS operates the disk controller without using the firmware in 
the boot ROM. Other manufacturers' cards that use the same control 
addresses and hardware and therefore can be manipulated in the same 
way as Apple cards can be recognized as one of the types we've been dis- 
cussing by following this protocol. 

Just Your Type. In a revision to the standard (which occurred after 
the Soft;Card system was written), Apple added an additional category, 
called a Type 6 firmware card. This card type was designed to give more 
freedom to peripheral manufacturers whose cards do not fit the catego- 
ries we've just mentioned or for cards that do fit the categories but have a 
different control address structure or hardware components. Identifying 
a card as a Type 6 opens up methods by which system software can iden- 
tify entry points in the card's firmware to branch to and from that per- 
form the card's various functions. A Type 6 card looks, at $Cn05 and 
$C/j07, just like a serial card. Separating the two cards requires examin- 
ing further all serial cards at $C/iOB. 

Since SoftCard preceded this new standard, it doesn't recognize the 
Type 6 card, and since the two bytes examined show the card to be a 
serial card, SoftCard CP/M will attempt to deal with it as a serial card. A 
new version of SoftCard CP/M scheduled for release soon corrects this 
problem, but for now. Type 6 cards such as the Epson 100 parallel 
printer interface will be identified incorrectly and will not work. In the 
case of most standard cards, however, the finder code will properly 
identify them and set the bytes in the SLTTYP table in the lOCB to the 
proper values. 

Missing in Action. If after examination of all the slots no SoftCard is 
found, the message "can't find Z-80 SoftCard" is printed to the forty- 
column screen via COUT and the finder branches to the Apple Moni- 
tor. If the SoftCard is located, however, the finder code goes on to its 
next task and initializes a series of vectors in memory. These vectors 
occupy the last sixteen bytes of memory page $03 in the lOCB. We dis- 
cussed these in an earlier column, referring to them as the Apple break, 
reset, Applesoft ampersand. Monitor control- Y, nonmaskable inter- 
rupt, and interrupt request vectors. Together with three vectors in high 
memory, $FFFA to $FFFF, they provide the means to recover from such 
things as interrupts and the pressing of the reset key. In the Apple II, 
these events cause an automatic (and nonstoppable) branch by the 6502 
to the address contained in $FFFA and $FFFB (nonmaskable inter- 
rupt); $FFFC and $FFFD (reset); or $FFFE and $FFFF (interrupt re- 
quest). 

Since these addresses are in the Monitor ROM and cannot be 
changed, and since at the time not all future requirements were known, 
Apple Computer implemented the vectors in the most flexible way pos- 
sible. This meant setting up a separate set of vectors in low memory that 
could be changed and arranging the high memory vectors so that the 
6502 would wind up at these low memory vectors eventually. In this way, 
no matter what was created in the future — DOS, CP/M, Pascal, and so 
on — a means was left open to allow the 6502 to wind up at the proper 
point to recover the system, as when the reset key is pressed in DOS and 
the system reinitializes itself, leaving DOS active and in control. 

Low Commotion. The vectors just moved by the finder code are the 
low memory vectors for CP/M, and they point to the subroutine caller 
loop in the lOCB. In this way, whenever a reset is encountered, for ex- 
ample, the Z-80 will have been turned off and the 6502 will have been en- 
abled and directed to the reset vector in high memory. After executing 
some Monitor code, the 6502 is eventually directed to the reset vector in 
low memory and through this to the Z-80 reactivation side of the sub- 
routine caller loop. Executing this loop, the 6502 restarts the Z-80, which 
immediately branches to OOOOH and executes the code found there. If 
CP/M has already been completely booted, this code will be a JumP to the 
Z-80 warm boot code to reinitialize and recover the system. Since we 
have not yet fully booted CP/M and OOOOH still contains the Z-80 re- 
covery program stored there by the cold loader, the finder code now 
places a Z-80 JumP instruction and the address of the Z-80 cold boot 
code at $1000 (OOOOH) for later execution. 

Call the Whole Gang In. Obviously, the next step is to get theCCP, 
BDOS, and the rest of the BIOS into memory, especially since the BIOS 
contains the Z-80 cold boot code! This is done by the finder code calling

the 6502 warm loader subroutine at SOFAD. This loader is the last 
module we'll examine this month. But first we'll complete the finder 
code. 

For now, assume that the warm loader has executed and that all of 
CP/M has been loaded from disk. The finder now patches the warm 
loader code itself, so that in future warm boots the warm loader will load 
only the CCP and BDOS (twenty-two sectors) and not the high memory 
BIOS portion (an additional six sectors). After performing this small 
step, the finder places the same restart vector address (the Z-80 side of the 
subroutine caller loop) into the last six addresses of the RAM board if 
one is installed, and these become the new high memory restart vectors. 

At this point, then, a system restart or interrupt will be handled prop- 
erly no matter how it occurs. The finder code is now complete, and it will 
branch to a point in the caller loop that properly shuts down the 6502 
(saving registers and status) and starts the Z-80. Next month we'll pick 
up the Z-80 boot code from this point, but for now we'll go on to cover 
the last 6502 mocjlqle. 

The warm loader is similar in some ways to the boot sector, since its 
primary function is read a set number of sectors from the system 
tracks into 'memory. Using RWTS, however, involves dealing with a 
table called the I/O block or lOB, not to be confused with SoftCard's 
lOCB area. The lOB is a concept that Apple has used with RWTS since 
the first thirteen-sector DOS, and it is the way that RWTS keeps track of 
all needed information about the current disk access it is performing. 

With a Twist. SoftCard's lOB is structured differently than that of 
standard DOS, and SoftCard's version of RWTS has been altered to 
handle those differences. Made up of twelve bytes beginning at $03E0 in 
the lOCB, this table has entries for the following items in the order 
shown: 

1. current track 

2. current sector 

3. current volume (unused) 

4. last volume (unused) 



5. current drive (1 or 2) 

6. last drive , 

7. current slot (times 16) 

8. last slot (times 16) 

9. buffer address (two bytes) 

10. error code 

1 1 . command (read, write, and so on) 

If the proper values are placed in the proper entries, RWTS can be told 
which track and sector to read or write to and where in memory to get it 
from or write it to. RWTS will also place an error byte in entry 10 that 
signals the calling routine that there was an error and, if it's idenufiable, 
what the error was. Command codes are 00 for seek track and sector, 01 
for read, 02 for write, and 04 for format. 

Using RWTS and the table, the warm loader begins bv placing 
$E400 into the buffer address entry for 56K CP/M ($B400 for 44K) and 
track 0, sector 1 1 , slot $60 into their appropriate entries. Then the warm 
loader calls RWTS at address $0E03. Decremenfing and keeping track of 
the number of sectors remaining to load, the warm loader increments 
track, sector, and buffer address in the JOB table, repetitively calling 
RWTS until th^ entire system has been loaded. Once done, the loader 
places $0800 into'the buffer address entry, since this will be the standard 
disk buffer in alt future reads and writes. It then returns to the finder 
code as we saw above and is patched by the finder code to load only 
twenty-two sectors, CCP and BDOS only, when it is called in the future 
by the Z-80 warm boot code. In future calls, the warm loader is accessed 
via a special vector at $0E00 that contains a 6502 JumP instruction with 
the address $OFAD. 

This completes our in-depth examination of the 6502 boot routines. 
Although direct use of this information is limited, it does provide a much 
clearer pirture of the means by which the system becomes operational. In 
addition, certain areas or routines we have discussed, such as RWTS and 
the lOB table, can be accessed by your own programs. Until next 
month. ... -,_

An AppLs Keeps 
TRAck oF tUe Flock 

BV AUDREW (URISTIE 

TTie holiday meal about to weigh down your groaning board did not 
while away a leisurely existence ambling about a barnyard pecking at com 
feed and chasing the farmer's dog. There is no longer such a thing as a 
turkey in the straw; that material long ago proved insufficiently absorbent 
as litter and is no longer used. Times change, and our hallowed traditions 
now depend on automation — and in some cases, a powerful little com- 
puter — to keep running smoothly. 



Every four weeks, a tractor trailer from the Land O' Lakes hatchery 
in Foley, Minnesota, pulls up to Dick Christiansen's turkey farm on 
Route One in Newell, Iowa, with a new flock of five thousand toms. 
Dick's son Mike drives out to the Newell Co-Op Elevator and delivers 
the feed order to mill man Don Piercy. While Piercy grinds the feed, the 
tiny toms are quickly deposited in the brood pens that will serve as giant 
incubators until they are moved into one of seven containment build- 
ings — their home for the next twenty weeks and the rest of their lives. 



Call him Sam. He's a white tom. He was separated out from the hens at 
the hatchery, desnooded to prevent infection, debeaked to discourage him 
from picking at or devouring his fellows during moments of stress, and the 
inside two toes on each foot have been clipped to reduce the possibility of 
injury, preserving him in the optimal grade. 

Sam arrives at the farm and is put into a brooder ring with four hundred 
of his peers. The floor of the ring is covered with three inches of wood shav- 
ings. The brooder hover stove, a circular metal affair resembling the saucer 
from The Day the Earth Stood Still, hangs from the ceiling on a safety 
chain and radiates a comforting ninety-five degrees of welcoming heat to the 
apprehensive little poults. Five long feeder troughs extend out from the 
center of the ring, alternating with water jugs. Things look okay. Sam 
relaxes. The poults spread out across the ring, each giving the other his own 
space. Sam is content. Everyone commences to peep. 



The Christiansen family farm, like most American farms, is more 
than a hundred years old and is a hereditary business. It went into the 
turkey management business in 1954, but Dick Christiansen still raises 
corn and soybeans, products nicely complementary to the farm's main 
product. 

The first Apple arrived in 1978, when it was perceived that there 
might be a certain fiscal advantage to knowing the exact costs involved in 
putting a flock of five thousand turkeys on the market every month. 
Suddenly the Iowa Office Supplies Center became vital to the Christian- 
sen farm. With no computer experience, Dick Christiansen bought an 
Apple system and hired commercial programmer Kim Catania — "He 
didn't know anything about turkeys and I didn't know anything about 
computers" — to write the farm's first program, Turkey Production Rec- 
ords Systems. Christiansen was then able to see a weekly summary of 
feed to each flock, keying in average sample weights for cost of produc- 
tion per pound. 



There was tension in Sam's ring. The water jug and feeder troughs had 
been gradually removed until there were none left. Many of the young toms 
were starting to panic, piling up under the brooder stove and attempting the 
forbidden feather picking. Other toms felt that the automatic fountains that 
had been noticed in the immediate vicinity of the last water jugs, as well as 
the automatic feed line inside the periphery of the ring, coidd sustain life. 
Many of the toms didn't believe it; they resisted changing from the old 
ways. Life had seemed so much simpler in the old days the week before. 
Some pined away and died as starveouts, but the majority of the flock rose 
to meet the challenge of the new technology and thrived.

It was the light they loved, and the light loved them. By the magic of its 
endless candlepower, the electric days could last up to eighteen hours. 
"Night" itself did not plunge them into darkness but was symbolized by a 
dim light that allowed them to see and kept them calm. Their growth accel- 
erated, their feathers became thick and white, and they began to exhibit the 
full rotundity of form that is the traditional mark of success in life. 



In poultry management, feed represents 60 percent of total produc- 
tion cost. Dick Christiansen uses a complete turkey feed. The Land O' 
Lakes feed programs on which Christiansen and most other turkey 
farmers depend permit selection of ingredients in the manufacture of the 
feed, allowing consideration of ingredient costs plus the costs of grind- 
ing, mixing, and hauling the feed. A complete feed program delivers feed 
with ingredients mixed to the farmer's specifications; a base feed pro- 
gram gives the farmer a formula of protein/fat starter, to which he adds 
his own soybean meal or corn, manufacturing the feed himself. Com- 
plete feed is more what you might call an assembled feed; basic, of 
course, is slower. 

How Do You Soar with Eagles ... No successful turkey grower 
works in isolation. Merlin Sletton is the Christiansen's turkey produc- 
tion specialist. Dealer support in the world of poultry management is just 
as important as it is in some other fields. He monitors the feed ingre- 
dients and flock condition and prescribes necessary medications. 

At Iowa State University, extension poultry specialist Bill Owens 
labors to discover more economical feed formulations and alternative in- 
gredients, working from the basic equation of one pound of meat pro- 
duced for every three pounds of feed. His job is to find ways to bring one 
end of that equation down, or the other end up, or both. He must work 
within Food and Drug Administration established guidelines regarding 
permissible drug use and combinations with species and age of bird. 
Added fat comes in handy for increasing the energy concentration of the 
ration, improving palatability, reducing dust and feed wastage, and im- 
proving the "finish" of birds. 

. . . When You're Working with Turkeys? Dick Christiansen is one 



of twenty-six Iowa turkey growers on the board of the Iowa Turkey Fed- 
eration, a commodity organization for the state turkey industry that or- 
ganizes educational meetings and research and keeps consumers in- 
formed with new recipes and articles on the correct preparation of tur- 
keys. Through the National Turkey Federation in Reston, Virginia, it 
keeps lowans informed of legislative developments. According to ITF 
executive secretary Carolyn J. Taylor, "Every time a processing plant 
opens its doors, it has to meet a whole set of FDA rules and regulations, 
and we have to keep our people informed of pending legislation. The 
government can even tell you how much water you can use at the plant. 
(In processing, each turkey must undergo a "chill cycle" in which it is 
submerged in chilled water for two to three hours.) 



It was time to leave the brooder ring for the real world of a confinement 
growing unit. At eight weeks. Sam was entitled to two feet of floor space, 
but eventually he would grow to command a fidl four square feet. He con- 
sidered himself lucky. His cousin Dan had been a range turkey. One day it 
had rained. Before the workers could get Dan to a range shelter, he had 
looked up to see what rain was and drowned. Then there was little Mary Jo, 
a white range hen who had met up with a migrating water fowl and con- 
tracted Avian Influenza. 

Not that life in the confinement unit was all corn and soybeans. Some of 
the toms had grown too fast and succumbed to aortic rupture. The turkey 
serviceman came and ordered a pound of copper sulfate per ton of feed. At 
a farm across the way, respiratory disease had claimed a dozen, and the 
litters, walls, and ceiling were sprayed with calcium proprionate mold inhib- 
itor and Poul-Dine was put in the water. A minor Bluecomb outbreak made 
some of them depressed and morbid. Others were felled by Round Heart or 
Water Bellies. Life went on. 



Turkey Tribulations. Through the Veterinary Medical Research In- 
stitute, the Iowa Turkey Federation has funded $130,000 in turkey 
disease research since 1972. Carolyn Taylor is philosophical about the 
matter.

NOVEMBER 1982 



"Turkeys are always plagued with some kind of disease problem. 
Right now the institute is working on Newcastle Disease and Avian In- 
fluenza. A while back we had a lot of trouble with Coryza. We're getting 
so we can pinpoint them, but you get one thing licked and something else 
always crops up. What it amounts to is that the turkeys get themselves 
sick. If someone walks into the room, if they get excited, if a germ gets 
into one of these disease-free buildings. . . . You've got to remember 
that these birds are bred for meat, not brains. They're susceptible." 

The second Christiansen farm program was a farm accounting sys- 
tem. Now there were profit-and-loss statements at the end of the month 
and for the year to date, and at year's end, a complete cash flow printout 
for all farm operations, business and personal. A balance sheet pre- 
sented completed assets against liabilities and equity, causing much ap- 
proval from the vicinity of Citizens First National, bankers enjoying such 
things as they do. 

As it was for so many others, the advent of VisiCalc was manna from 
heaven for the Christiansen Apple. Plugging in an additional twenty-four 
cents per bushel of corn and subtracting a dollar ten per ton of soybean 
meal, then projecting a change in the selling price per pound of turkey in 
a what-if program involving thirty-two feed items, did indeed seem like 
magic. Every two weeks, the Land O' Lakes feeding program, with the 
cost of all ingredients, gets plugged into VisiCalc for the least cost ration 
to feed proportions. The Christiansens now have about three years of 
data and are able to plot it with a data plotting system, creating separate 
graphs with overlays for cost per bushel of com, turkey prices (a record 
low of $2.87 in June 1980; a record high of $4.95 by October), and 
monthly rainfall with a ten year average. The payoff is efficiency. 

"Because the economy is what it is," says Dick Christiansen, "our 
profit picture looks poor, but it would look a lot poorer without the 
Apple." There was a bumper crop of turkeys last year, depressing the 
market for eighteen months. Breeders accordingly cut back, producers 
are producing less, and now turkeys are in short supply; in higher de- 
mand, at higher prices. 

The turkey's higher visibility is certainly due in large part to the tire- 
less efforts of the National Turkey Federation, who, while not having the

economic clout of their organizational bedfellows who promote the 
edibility of eggs or the sophistication bestowed on the consumer by the 
drinking of milk, try harder. It is through their efforts that turkey (low 
calorie, high protein, low cholesterol) has become an accepted ingredient 
in the nation's frankfurters, as well as establishing itself in the deli section 
as a luncheon meat in its own right. Early this year, during the critical 
"turkey fatigue" period following the holiday season, the NTF offered 
retailers free radio advertising time if they would use it exclusively to 
promote turkey products sold by their stores. The effort paid off, to the 
relief of growers and processors, offsetting the potentially grim effects of 
the seasonal turkey depression combined with the production surplus. 



On Sam 's kill date he is herded into the turkey loader when it pulls up to 
the building and pokes its nether end through the door. He finds himself 
briefly on a conveyor belt, and is plucked out at the top of the loader and in- 
stalled in a crate with several other turkeys, then deposited in the Dil-Mar 
Foods truck below with many other crates. The flock makes its way to the 
processing plant at Storm Lake, where Sam will meet the workers in rub- 
ber aprons and the long hooks moving along the ceiling, then greet the world 
at large, shrink-wrapped and labeled "Mr. Turkey." 

But, in the meantime, in the loading and unloading, with his head im- 
mobilized against one wooden slat of the crate, he has one eye turned up to 
the sky, and he regards the surprising light of the sun. 



After the flock has gone, all movable equipment — feeders, waterers, 
and brooder guards — is taken out of the building, washed, and sanitized. 
A high-pressure sprayer is used to wash down ceilings, walls, floors, fans, 
and any remaining equipment. The building is allowed to dry, then 
building, floor, and equipment are sprayed with disinfectant. Next, they 
are sprayed with Environ, a phenolic germicidal detergent, to take care 
of pathogenic bacteria, virus, and fungi. Finally, poultry spray and larva- 
cide are used, along with Ronnel Concentrate for beetles. 

Waiting for the Class of '83. No one will be allowed to enter the 
building until the arrival of the next flock. As much as possible, it will be 
kept open and free-flying birds will be kept out. 

Dick Christiansen, at fifty-one, works the land his great-grandfather 
worked, along with his twenty-five year old son Mike and one full-time 
man. They make up the labor force of the Christiansen Turkey Farm. 
Dick Christiansen is content. 

"I haven't moved more than a quarter of a mile off this land since I 
got out of the service. There's not much money in it, but I live good; I eat 
good. I wouldn't trade it for anything." 

Some things don't change.

THANKSGIVING 0. 198 




BV AHDI^EW CHRISTIE 



As the fourth Thursday in November bears down upon us once 
again, it's time to take a long, critical look at the infrastructure of our tra- 
ditional holiday system. We must ask: can Thanksgiving make it in the 
information age? Though there have been modifications over the years in 
food prq)aration hardware and technique, these are essentially minor 
changes; its basic holiday technology has remained unchanged for 361 
years. 

More than any other holiday, the American Thanksgiving Day is an 
intriguing amalgam of pagan celebration, rendering homage to the spirits 
of successful agricultural endeavor, and the European Pietistic mode. 
Thanksgiving's design structure is dissimilar to that of the standard mod- 
ern holiday, bypassing, as it does, the grid overlay of church tradition on 
a locus of preexistent native ceremonial data — the favored method of fif- 
teenth and sixteenth-century Catholic field engineers faced with the prob- 
lem of integrating Qiristian programming with that of a possibly incom- 
patible host culture, sometimes requiring brute force technique. It is, 
rather, uniquely indigenous. But it is not a new invention. Several thou- 
sand man-years of basic myth development went into Thanksgiving's 
current streamlined civil/religious hohday configuration. 

The first known version to have been run successfully was designed 
by Israeli agrarian engineers in an Exodus emulation mode. Designated 
the Feast of the Tabernacles (SUCCOTH I), its elegantly simple four- 
function design provided for harvest-thanks, folk dance addressing, fore- 
bear history recall, and full display of the fruits of harvest, serving as a 
model for many future systems. The documentation, in the book of Ne- 
hemiah, remains a marvel of user-friendly clarity 



Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and branches 
of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and 
branches of thick trees, to make booths. ... So the people went 
forth and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one 
ujjon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of 
the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate . . . and 
there was very great gladness. 



A major later development was the Greek Thesmophoria, or feast of 
Demeter, goddess of the harvest. This was configured for Athenian mar- 
ried women in the month of November, an important early retrofitting 
of agricultural harvest effect with human fertility. Two wealthy women 
were chosen to supervise the sacred meal task management. On day one 
of the feast,, while the general populace executed the mirth/rejoicing rou- 
tine, the women proceeded sequentially to the promontory of Colias and 
initiated a seventy-two hour Thanksgiving celebration function in the 
temple of Demeter. Their return poked a public celebration for the same 
time period, beginning in solemnity before branching to an orgy se- 
quence and livestock execution. The input values of a fruitful goddess in- 
cluded poppy arrays and ears of corn, a basket of fruit, and a little pig. 

The Roman Cerelia, or feast of Ceres, added little to the borrowed 
Greek Thanksgiving technology, essentially moving back the time frame 
to October 4 and introducing a fasting subroutine among the common 



people, who offered Ceres a sow and initial harvest cuttings. Most sig- 
nificant to the evolution of the present-day version, sports and field pro- 
cession event scheduling were added to the feast routine, prefiguring the 
modern NCAA/Macy's parade sequence. 

The Pilgrim Process. By the seventeenth century, the basic har- 
vest/fertility/thanks components were in place, requiring only consoli- 
dation and modulation to be formed into the final Thanksgiving proce- 
dure. At this time, the Puritans, a high-mobility English group, during a 
ten-year stay in Leyden, Holland, had occasion to effect a study of the 
Netheriands' annual thanksgiving celebration of delivery from Spanish 
rule. The Puritans did not care for the sloppy holiday programming tech- 
nique that had jammed the English event calendar with feast days, but 
they were attracted to the efficient holiday pathways of the Dutch, 
which also demonstrated the viability of religious linking loader 
implementation. 

Eventually establishing a base in America, the Pilgrims made an ini- 
tial New World harvest test in October 1621. It provided enough raw 
material for team leader William Bradford to command a three-day feast 
and celebration based on the English harvest home model. Though this 
first New World holiday model was deemed a success, it proved difficult 
to repeat, research in subsequent years yielding frequent disappoint- 
ments marked by recurrent crop failures. Droughts and inadequate har- 
vest, however, increased the Thanksgiving celebratory factor in an in- 
verse ratio whenever a measure of agrarian success was achieved, and so 
the various Massachusetts groups celebrated their harvests at random for 
the next fifty years. 

Federal Aid. Though this time is considered the Thanksgiving gold- 
en age by some, with participants freely sharing festivity techniques and 
thankfulness theory, it is clear that there could have been no advances in 
the field as long as the holiday base remained a loose, decentralized ag- 
gregate of local independents. 

In this regard, the 1789 Thanksgiving Proclamation of George Wash- 
ington must be considered a landmark in Thanksgiving development; the 
first proposal for a standard format, universal celebrating system: 

"Now therefore, I do recommend and assign Thursday, the 
twenty-sixth day of November next, to be devoted by the people 
of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who 
is the Beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that 
win be; that we may then all unite in rendering unto Him our sin- 
cere and humble thanks for His kind care and protection of the 
people of this country, previous to their becoming a nation; for the 
signal and manifold mercies, and the favorable interpositions of 
His providence, in the course and conclusion of the late war; for 
the great degree of tranquility, union and plenty, which we have 
since enjoyed; for the peaceable and rational manner in which we 
have been enabled to establish Constitutions of Government for 
our safety and happiness, and particularly the national one now 
lately instituted; for the civil and religious liberty with which we 
are blessed, and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing use- 
ful knowledge; and, in general, for all the great and various fa- 
vors, which He has been pleased to confer upon us."

That just about covered it. (Note the founding father's typical great 
foresight in giving thanks for "the means we have of acquiring and dif- 
fusing knowledge.") But the ex-colonies proved to be backsliders, and 
Thanksgiving soon lost what ground it had gained in the market to the 
major organized forces of Christmas and Easter, falling back to its pre- 
vious undated regional level, where it stayed for many years. 

In the end, it was only the tireless efforts of Thanksgiving booster 
Sara Josepha Hale, editor of Godey's Lady's Book, that succeeded in 
marshaling available technology to produce the Thanksgiving product in 
the form we know it today. Through her editorializing, and by her per- 
sonally prevailing upon President Lincoln, a reproclamation was issued 
declaring the fourth Thursday in November as the official date of obser- 
vation. Each president since then has performed the dynamic memory re- 
fresh; all state governors have received the protocol and relayed it, nam- 
ing the same day, completing the subroutine and improving program 
modularity. 

Thus did Thanksgiving Day become the only religious festival op- 
erating system celebrated in the United States by authority of the civil 
government. A program interrupt occurred in 1939 when FDR tried to 
retrofit it to the third Thursday in November, causing widespread chaos. 
Thanksgiving crashes occurred regularly, and all the states slipped back 
into their random habits again. It took a joint resolution of Congress in 
1941 to perform the final debugging process: "That the fourth Thursday 
in November in each year after the year 1941 be known as Thanksgiving 
Day, and it is hereby made a legal public holiday to all intents and 
purposes." 

Overseas Competition. We can reasonably conclude that our 
Thanksgiving system is now basically sound and performs its designated 
functions with maximum efficiency and minimal required energy out- 
put. As the old folk proverb goes, "If it works, don't fix it." But how 
does our fundamental system stack up on the international market? 
(See figure 1 . ) 

In Canada, Thanksgiving is the second Monday in October, incre- 
menting from the harvest-home ceremony bus of the Sunday preceding. 
Outside North America, Thanksgiving formats are somewhat less . . . 
sedate. 

In Peru, the harvest is in May and the celebration is the Invention of 
the Cross, the Christian program update for the Incan Ayllihuay, a noc- 
turnal bash for the life-giving forces input to the soil of the earth from the 
night skies. The cross was everywhere in the early sixteenth century, re- 
placing the native home gods as preferred hearth-protection mnemonics. 
In the mountains, on the eve of Cruzvelacuy, bonfires are burned-in 
around all Christian processing units, which are enhanced with votive 
candles, lights, ornaments, and flowers. 

Christianity hit Finland in 1200 A.D. and the unpronounceable Mid- 
summer's Eve celebration and fertility feast, in which the fishermen gave 
thanks to the rivers and lakes for their bulk storage and retrieval capac- 
ity, was moved to the Saturday closest to the June 24 feast day of Saint 
John the Baptist. Dwelling units decorated with cut branches effect sym- 
bolic new-life simulation. The Midsummer's Eve kokko (bonfire) re- 



quires a long and tedious wood-gathering process, as it must bum at least 
until midnight along all the lake shores and the sea coast. Theoretically, 
if a girl bathes her face in the dew concurrent with the midsummer sun 
power-up sequence, no additional supplementary beauty enhancement 
will be required. As she is homeward bound, if she retrieves flower ar- 
rays of maximum fragrance potential and tucks them under her pillow, 
she will dream of the man she is to marry. This innovative design appar- 
ently accounts for the high correlation of marriages performed on Mid- 
summer's Day to the number of engagements contracted around the 
bonfire the evening before. 

The rest of Europe is generally based on standard Ingathering Feast 
techniques and need not be elaborated on here. 

Liberian Thanksgiving is configured on technology exported by a 
boatload of American colonial engineers who interfaced with the Afri- 
can coast in November 1820 and held on-board Thanksgiving services in 
recognition of same. Two years later, colonists had the ceremony up and 
running as a national Liberian holiday after successful battles against the 
Dey, Mamba, and Vai tribes. At church services, funds are prompted to 
flow to areas of lesser concentration, followed by a jump command to 
feasting/entertainment with costume /exhibit array enhancement. 

On Taiwan, the Chinese celebrate the Festival of the Harvest Moon 
on the fifteenth day of the eighth moon of the lunar year, usually late Au- 
gust to early September. On the night of the Moon Festival, Yueh Lao, 
the old man in the moon, links designated couples together with invisi- 
ble red silk thread. (How do they know it's red? Hush, child.) Moon 
cakes are the high-order element of the festival. These were field-tested 
during the Yuan Dynasty (1368 A.D.) when the Chinese were attempt- 
ing a program for the deletion of the alien Mongol rulers. A senior bak- 
ery analyst hit upon the idea of concealing delete message units in round- 
cake dedicated registers. The cakes were exchanged as gifts, and com- 
mands were successfully entered without authorities breaking the code 
protection. The revolution was successful, and the round, flat cakes filled 
with sweet, starchy filling became referred to in the jargon as moon 
cakes. 

Meanwhile, across the broad Pacific, the descendants of the Puritans 
sit grimly before electronic oracles, where the images of the designated 
celebrants combine in colorful gridiron formations. Belts are loosened, 
and the uncles snore in the parlor in the rich and heavy afternoon, 
breathing like dolphins. I made a snowman and my brother knocked my 
snowman down and 1 knocked my brother down and then we played 
Snack Attack. 

Though the variables are always changing, the values remain 
constant. 

Harvest home! Harvest home! 
We've plowed, we've sowed, 
We've reaped, we've mowed. 
We've brought home every load. 

We are too hip, hip, hip, harvest home!

BY LIhDA A. hEl^klLL AHD DAVID mm 



The history of American politics is peppered with sound and fury, 
war and peace. Bloody, Wagnerian battles have decided many an elec- 
tion, lightened only by the court jesting of a Will Rogers or a Rich Lit- 
tle. The great dream of Jefferson and our founding fathers survives in the 
elemental clash between donkey and elephant. Controlled by mysterious 
forces, like the movement of continental plates. Republicans and Dem- 
ocrats grind against each other while mountain ranges rise and fall, lakes 
dry up, and coastlines shrink. 



Our most powerful chieftains meet in a great domed hall on the Hill. 
The Daleys and the Rockefellers leave local strongholds for the battle- 
ground named after our greatest warrior, Washington. They wield 
mighty clubs and lead loyal legions of supporters. Here the will of the 
common people decides, except when an assassin takes that right away. 
And then there is great sorrow, sorrow only a stricken people can know. 

November has been chosen for the month of the greatest battles. As 
the autumn leaves fall, so do the hopes of many bright and young-at-

heart candidates. It's the way of things. 

Put Up Your Dukes. Like the drive against the Germans in World 
War 11, it's the campaign that wins an election. Republican and Demo- 
cratic candidates usually have to survive a primary bout in June. Only 
the politically strongest and smartest survive. There are many skirmishes 
and minor clashes before this time, and more fierce confrontations 
follow all the way up to the final election. 

This year's gubernatorial election in California is a tough one. The 



major candidates are battling for one of the prize gems in the empire, the 
proving ground for our current chief executive. There can only be one 
winner. With all the big guns used in this type of campaign, the presence 
of an Apple among the support troops on one side is worth an 
investigation. 

Election campaigns, like wars, are only made possible with money. 
All those thirty-second television spots, billboards, posters, bumper 
stickers, fliers, radio commercials, and buttons cost bucks. The two main

contenders for governor in California have each required more than two 
million dollars to wage media-intensive campaigns. 

In an effort to keep the political game aboveboard, the Political 
Reform Act (PRA) was passed in 1974 by the voters of California. The 
PRA requires all political candidates to report every monetary donation 
of more than a hundred dollars. With the total amount of donations 
running into millions of dollars and the total number of donors adding 
up to thousands of people, this reporting process can quickly escalate 
into an enormous task. 

Faced with such a responsibihty, in this case for Republican candi- 
date George Deukmejian's campaign for governor of California, Pat 
Formby, campaign treasurer, decided to use an Apple II Plus to help 
with the campaign's Schedule A reporting forms. Six times a year, these 
reports must be filed. The time of filing is called a threshold. 

The Searcher. Shortly after he made this decision, Formby realized 
he would have to find someone who was knowledgeable about both 
computer programming and the complicated Schedule A reporting. If 
that person could design a program to meet his accounting requirements 
for the duration of the campaign, then Formby's computer could do the 
job for him. James Lorenz turned out to be just the right person for 
the job. 

Lorenz, a software designer with Orion Business Systems in San 
Diego, California, had run for the office of California State Assembly- 
man in 1980. During his campaign, Lorenz had tracked his Schedule A 
reporting manually. When Formby contacted him about creating a pro- 
gram to do the job, Lorenz recognized immediately the enormity of the 
assignment and the timesaving and laborsaving potential if he could 
design such a program. 

To satisfy the PRA requirements, the program has to accumulate 
donations so that as soon as a supporter's total dollar amount con- 
tributed exceeds one hundred dollars, that person is included in the 



Schedule A listing. The report must include the date of the contribution 
and the person's name, address, occupations, and, under certain cir- 
cumstances, employer. 

Lorenz designed the program to use Cobol on CP/M and contracted 
Fritz Sands to do the programming; thus Formby's Apple had to be con- 
figured to the task. Lorenz added a Z-80 card, an eighty-column card, a 
16K RAM card, a twenty-megabyte Corvus hard disk, and two printer 
cards. A Qume and a high-speed TI810 were the chosen printers. The 
Apple system could then accommodate both Formby's Schedule A 
reporting and Sands's complex array of interactive programs. 

A problem developed almost immediately. With all the cards that 
Lorenz had added, the inside of the Apple became so hot that the com- 
puter malfunctioned after a very short period of operation. To solve the 
problem, Lorenz cut a hole in the computer's floorplate near the speaker, 
moved the speaker over, and inserted a twenty-cubic-foot-per-minute 
muffin fan over the hole. Then he masked the ducts so that the air would 
flow past the slotboards, over the motherboards, through the keyboard, 
and out the front left. Now the Apple ran at room temperature with no 
overheating problems. "It's loud, but functional. We call it the Orion 
Turbo," says Lorenz. 

True Grit. Lorenz is quick to point out that the Schedule A is not just 
a matter of who, when, and how much. One of the most valuable as- 
pects of Schedule A reporting is the information it provides the cam- 
paigners for tracking donor records. For example, it's financially helpful 
to know if a multiple donor is contributing an increasing or decreasing 
amount of money with increasing or decreasing frequency. If either the 
amount or the frequency factor is increasing, that donor is a political 
supporter who deserves some special courting. Lorenz's program tracks 
this kind of information. 

With the reported information on a computer database, it's also pos- 
sfble to get to it from whatever point you want. For example, you can get 
a geographical breakdown if you want to know what area you are get- 
ting the most donations from. Or it can tell you how many donors have 
contributed a given amount of money. Or it can tell you the amount in 
total donations on a given day. 

One of the features that fully uses the computer's capacity to save la- 
bor time is what Lorenz calls a self-teaching zip code directory. When 
the computer operator enters the address of a contributor, the computer 
encodes in its memory the city and state that correspond to the zip code 
that was entered. The next time that an address has to be entered with 
that city and state, all the operator has to enter is the five-digit zip code. 
When the computer sees that code, it will automatically call up the city 
and state for that zip code without requiring the operator to rekey those 
characters. 

According to Lorenz, the average input per day per operator is four 
hundred donors. An average city and state combination is about ten 
characters long, so Lorenz figures that this built-in zip code directory is 
saving the computer operator up to four thousand characters a day. 

Since he is the campaign treasurer, Formby is held personally re- 
sponsible for all campaign dollars. So when Formby asked Lorenz to de- 
sign this program, one of Formby's requirements was that there be an 
audit control system built into it. Lorenz was happy to oblige. 

Stagecoach. When Formby receives a group of contribution checks 
for the campaign, the checks are broken down into batches. Each batch 
is assigned a batch control number. Then when the computer operator 
enters a donation into the Schedule A database, the batch control num- 
ber that was assigned to that contribution check is entered in the donor's 
file along with the other required information. In this way, an audit trail 
is created. 

This batch control system gives Formby the ability to keep in his 
computer database the information that he must also store in his hard 
copy files. With the audit trail, Formby can reconstruct an entire batch 
of checks if, for some reason, the hard copy file that contains the xero- 
graphic copies of the checks and deposit shps for that batch is misplaced. 

For example, if batch x is missing from his file drawer, Formby can 
ask the computer to reconstruct batch x. The computer will search every 
record on the database and pull the records that have batch control num- 
ber X in them. When it pulls those records, the computer notes the do-

In this way, the audit trail can serve as a file back-up system in the event 
that the paper records are misplaced or destroyed. 

Lorenz's program also includes a way to handle contribution checks 
that bounce. If a donor writes a check that later is returned to Formby 
because of insufficient funds, the computer operator can go into the 
database and alter the batch to show that a bad check was received. The 
record of the donation is not deleted from the database, but the amount 
of the returned contribution check is subtracted from the Schedule A re- 
port. The contribution will not show on the Schedule A, but it will show 
on the audit trail. In this way, a person cannot make a donation with a 
bad check, claim a tax deduction, and get away with both the dollar

amount of the returned check and the deduction. 

Lorenz admits that a software designer without an intimate knowl- 
edge of the Political Reform Act and its legal ramifications would not 
have been able to create a very satisfactory software program. The fact 
that he had run for office himself made him uniquely qualified to design 
the program. Lorenz is proud of his creation. Having done manually in 
1980 what Formby's Apple II Plus now does, he can truly appreciate his 
program's success. 

The Quiet Man. As for Formby's reaction to Lorenz's program, he 
couldn't be more pleased. "The project has definitely been a success. I 
am happy that I chose my Apple computer to take care of this task for 
me," says Formby. "Although we can use it for blitz mailings, the pro- 
gram is primarily used as a reporting and fund-raising tool. Because it in- 
cludes dollar amounts, the database is much more useful than a straight 
mailing list. 

"The candidate doesn't know where the money's coming from. He's 
too busy. We have a list now of twelve thousand to fifteen thousand 
names." 

Formby also points out that the database provides easy access to in- 
formation needed for sending out thank-yous in response to every con- 
tribution. In addition, the data can be retrieved easily if necessary to 
respond to donors' tax claims. 

Lianne Porter is the computer operator who has been working on the 
Apple for the campaign. According to Porter, "The program is saving 
time and labor for the campaign. It's simple to input data into the com- 
puter and easy to look up in the database if you need to find a certain 
piece of information. 

"It's easy, but you still have to catch yourself from making mis- 
takes," Porter adds. "I work on the Apple about six hours a day. We get 
enough money in each day to keep me busy." 

Formby is a CPA who's "kinda retired." Working out of a two story 
office building across from a racetrack in Los Alamitos, California, 
Formby is volunteering his time as treasurer for Deukmejian's cam- 
paign. Formby has performed his present duties for Deukmejian before, 
in races for the state assembly, senate, and attorney general. 

"The old way was to hand post everything in a general ledger book 
with carbon paper. If you took the information to an outside computer 
house, the preparations were intense and the turnaround time forever." 

Reap the Wild Wind. The day may come when people vote from the 
comfort of their homes. The telecommunications revolution promises 
this and more. In the future, political campaigns will rely heavily on in- 
teractive videotex systems for polling. The voice of the people will be 
heard louder and faster than ever before. 

Still, it's going to be difficult to serve up a thousand-doUar-a-plate din- 
ner through a monitor. The traditional forms of political parlay and ma- 
neuvering will never completely disappear. The wars will just escalate, 
bringing in more participants and creating more casualties. 

It's the way of things.

Arcade Machine. By Chris Jochumson and Doug Carlston. Somewhere 
trumpets blare, crowds of hobbyists cheer, and game manufacturers 
cringe. Arcade Machine, after an eleven-month delay, has finally arrived. 
Although this program does not perform black magic at the wave of a 
joystick, it certainly shines alone in territory no one else has walked. A r- 
cade Machine produces (with some help from you) exciting, animated, 
graphic games. These games can have as polished a professional look as 
many of the games you see in the stores. 

If you've ever been enjoying a game but wished it could do this in- 
stead of that, you'll thoroughly enjoy custom-designing your own games 
to suit your moods and tastes — and the Arcade Machine requires just 
enough of you that you'll feel immense satisfaction and pride in your ac- 
complishment. And therein lies the other side of the coin. 

Nirvana is not quite at hand. Even though you need no program- 
ming knowledge, using the Arcade Machine requires that you learn quite 
a bit about the way graphic games are constructed. In fact, you'll soon 
come to appreciate the enormous skill and effort that the authors of 
home-arcade games put into them. This program handles at least nine- 
tenths of the work for you, yet the remaining tenth will take several ses- 
sions to learn and longer to master. It is not that any of these concepts or 
procedures are difficult in themselves but that there are so many of them. 
Still, A rcade Machine strives to make things as easy as possible for you to 
learn; the manual even contains layout sheets for practice. 

The main menu contains a shape editor to determine what your 
pieces are going to look like, a path creator to implement how they are 
going to move on the screen, a game options section, a level options 
selector (up to five), a background/ title creator (here is where you get to 
put your name), a load/save game function, a run-game mode for test- 
ing as you are created, and, finally, a create -game-disk feature for 
making copies of your finished product. 

Each of these sections contains other submenus, where even more in- 
credible options are considered. One of the nicest features is the option to 
make any game a two-player game. Shapes and backgrounds from dif- 
ferent games can be merged into new games, allowing for updating and 
improvement in case you tire of your old games. 

You needn't be able to draw well to use the Arcade Machine's 
graphics. For example, tell the computer where you want the center to be 
and where the outside should go, then hit O and, presto, a circle. Tri- 
angles and rectangles are similarly easy. Another command draws them 
and fills them in with color at the same time. Color on the Apple is not a 
simple matter. When dots are placed side by side, they look white. Only 
when they're staggered do you see color on the screen. Different com- 
binations of the basic colors yield different colors. This can take some 
getting used to when designing your character shapes. 

To show the range of the Arcade Machine and possibly to provide 
prototypes, the back of the disk contains five games generated by the Ar- 
cade Machine. A couple of them, like Pizza Man, are quite remarkable. 

Naturally Arcade Machine does have some limitations; for instance, 
it doesn't provide for designing maze games. But it is the manual itself 
that is the program's biggest limitation. Perhaps Broderbund will pro- 
duce a supplementary manual to clarify some of the more obscure 
points. (Hints hint.) 

Broderbund is encouraging amateur game makers by sponsoring a 
contest. Starting January 1983 and ending in June, Broderbund will 
award two hundred dollars' worth of prizes to the best game design pro- 



duced with the Arcade Machine. The monthly winners will compete for a 
fifteen-hundred-dollar grand prize. Who knows, the game you create 
may even be good enough to publish! If not, at least you'll have the fun 
of testing your game-designing instincts against the pros. 

Using the Arcade Machine isn't a cinch. But it's a lead-pipe cinch 
you'll never get more for your money — or more for your effort. RRA

our country lived primitively compared to those who remained in the 
established cities. New frontiers often are characterized by primitive 
ways, yet they are the great breakthroughs that lead to progress. 

In The Mask of the Sun, a new company shares with us major break- 
throughs in adventure graphics; but, if we are to appreciate most this 
welcome into a new frontier, we must accept some compromises. It's well 
worth it. 

When you play Mask, you will never see a picture fill with color on 
SCTeen. You move through fully colored graphic scenes; if once in a while 
the color bleeds a little, you're not apt to care. Not only because of the 
ready fill, but because move is the precise word. 

In Mask, when you say "Go west" or "Left," you don't flash to 
another place, you move there — watching the scenery go by on the way. 
This is most exciting and effective when you're approaching something 
significant and can see it in the distance. The fact that most of this action 
takes place in the rather gamely tunnels of old pyramids does not take 
away from the importance of the concept. 

On top of this, individual scenes are animated. A statue transforms 
before your eyes; an animal attacks; a carved face talks; an island sub- 
merges and arises in molten lava. Often you must interact with the 
animation. Like in Escape from Rungistan, a prompt appears during the 
animated sequence and you must act quickly to avoid dire con- 
sequences. 

All these fine effects are plenty to make up for substandard drawing 
on the graphics. Fortunately, they're not called on for this in The Mask 
of the Sun. The pictures are full-bodied, well done, detailed illustrations, 
surpassed in the world of adventure only by Penguin's new Transylvania. 

Sound effects occur occasionally, like the animation. When they 
occur they are appropriate and add to the fun. 

Now for the meat — the adventure itself. It's a good one. The puzzles 
vary in difficulty; some appear quite obvious. Don't be overly confident 
about these, though. The great Russian playwright Anton Chekhov once 
said, "Never hang a gun in the first act if it isn't going to go off in the 
third." A puzzle easily solved, an apparently innocuous statement casual- 
ly made in the beginning of Mask may well be the sole key to a crucial 
puzzle toward the end. This is absolutely delightful. Let nothing escape 
you; count nothing irrelevant. 

The people at Ultrasoft claim an ambition for and a dedication to 
creating the finest software possible. Their willingness and effort to 
implement suggestions from bela. testers attests to their claim. As their 
first release, The Mask of the Sun is vivid evidence. It's not perfect, but 
neither was the aircraft at Kitty Hawk. A year from now we may look at 
an old graphics adventure and say, as we watch the colors fill, "How 
come they released it before it was finished?" 

We anticipate great pleasure and more surprises following the prog- 
ress of this innovative company.

game might remind you of Star Blazer, but in an underwater scenario. 
Then the many differences and unique features i^ecome apparent. Seafox 
is a submarine whose duty it is to sink enemy shipping. Needless to say, 
the enemy frowns on this activity and exerts tremendous effort to stop 
the Seafox. The sea is full of enemy subs that try to ram you. On ad- 
vanced levels these subs also fire torpedoes at you. On the surface, mer- 
chant ships cruise slowly by, protected by a screen of faster moving Red 
Cross ships. (Judging by the nonstop flow of these hospital ships, our 
side must be trouncing the enemy on other fronts.) 

The Seafox has two weapons — torpedoes to fire forward and Polaris 
missiles to fire upward. One really nice feature, which Star Blazer didn't 
offer, is your ability to shoot in both directions at the same time. You 
don't have to wait to rise to a certain level before you can fire the Polaris 
missiles. You have, however, a limited amount of ammunition. Supplies 
and gas — the Seafox'?, tank depletes rapidly — arrive regularly via a sup- 
ply ship that comes along the bottom and are released on the back of a 
dolphin. The Seafox must intercept the package before giant clams steal 
it or enemy submarines destroy it. If you shoot the dolphin, an inde- 
structible giant orange shark roars from the sidelines and gobbles up the 
Seafox. 

In Seafox, the Red Cross has realized the vulnerabihty of its ships. 
The hospital ships now have antimissile shielding on their hulls; any mis- 
sile striking one is immediately defected downward at the sub firing it. 
The returning missile is easy to avoid; the penalty resides in the time lost 
as it slowly makes its way to the bottom. Since no missile can be fired in a 
single direction until the first shot detonates or disappears, you can miss 
opportunities. Sinking all the enemy merchant ships completes a level. 

On the second level, enemy destroyers join the surface parade, drop- 
ping depth charges that explode at the level you occupied when they were 
discharged. You can turn this peril to your advantage by maneuvering so 
that the charge will explode on enemy subs. As the underwater arena be- 
comes crowded, the enemy depth charges are as likely to blow up their 
own subs as yours. 

On the third level, the enemy subs add torpedo fire to the fray, and 
on the fourth, they discharge magnetic mines. The fifth, final level? You 
tell us.

Starcross. By Dave Lebling and Marc Blank. If it takes a minimum of 
two instances to form a proposition, then Starcross, adventurous Info- 
com's first foray into science fiction and second departure from the dun- 
geons of Zork, enables the proposition that this young company is one of 
remarkable versatility and apparently unerring ability to implement fresh 
and fitting approaches to multifarious subjects. Deadline, the you-solve-it 
mystery, was, of course, instance one. 

Starcross resembles Deadline and the Zorks only in the benevolent in- 
telligence that is a hallmark of Infocom's work. In every other regard, it 
serves its own identity — that of a sci-fi situation and story. The scope, the 
structure, the language, the events, the requirements on the player are all 
dictated by the genre and its time and setting. 

Where the Zorks are set in the fantasy world of Dark Ages magic and 
myth, where Deadline is set in the very mundane world of the Britishlike 
parlor murder mystery, Starcross is set in the no less fantastic and no 
more obvious world of the possible future. 

As the game begins, you find yourself on a one-person spaceship, 
searching for black holes. With you are only your smart-aleck computer 
and your mass detector. Amazingly, when the mass detector proffers you 
a pictorial map of nearby space, you the real person can reach in your 
Starcross package and pull out the exact map in four glossy colors. 
You'll need it to direct the computer as to the course to take to your des- 
tination (why on earth didn't you pop for the gadget that interfaces the 
mass detector directly to that cantankerous computer?). 

But instead of a black hole, you find an asteroid-size spaceship, the 
kind that might be devised to transport entire civilizations to new ho- 
rizons when their own corner of the universe is becoming uninhabitable. 

What you find there and what you do with it all are the meat of this 
outstanding adventure. As with so many excellent adventures, determin- 



ing your purpose is an integral part of the plot. 

Starcross is painted in briUiant colors with ultra-high-resolution 
detail; as usual, Infocom has created these splendid graphics entirely with 
words. This is a text, or, as the authors prefer, and appropriately so, a 
prose adventure. 

No puzzle in Starcross is illogical, although many require good imag- 
ination and truly innovative thinking. Picture facing an apparent dead 
end. Nothing you'd expect to work solves this puzzle. You mull the 
problems and all the pieces a long time, and finally an idea comes. It's 
complex, it's far out, it's got to be out of the question — no one else would 
have thought of that — but it's thoroughly logical. Just for kicks, you try 
it, expecting another dead end. Instead, the program understands, re- 
sponds — you weren't crazy; those guys actually think like you. But 
wait — they've taken it even farther; you'll have to stretch your mind even 
more. Like most good stretches, it feels delicious. 

Infocom's adventure vocabulary continues to expand. The famous 
Zork parser allows you to speak to the Apple as though it were a per- 
son. When it doesn't understand, it makes perfectly clear what it doesn't 
understand. No guess-the-right-synonym games here. 

In the realm of science-fiction adventure for the micro, only Cyborg 
holds a candle to Starcross. Both deserve places in the computer sci-fi 
hall of fame. A year younger and benefiting from Infocom's extraor- 
dinary technical tools, Starcross is the smoother, the more playable; 
Cyborg still wears the crown for plot. 

No adventurer should pass up Starcross. And, if you've never ven- 
tured into this kind of game, Starcross is a good place to start. f1(T

This rather staggering vocabulary of seventy-five thousand words re- 
sides on two disks. There is also room to add ten thousand words of your 
own choice. 

Second, this spelling verification program works with most word 
processing packages available for the Apple. The company is putting out 
four versions of Sensible Speller. The DOS 3.3 version works in conjunc- 
tion with Screen Writer II, Apple Writer 1 3Ln6 II, Apple PIE, Magic Win- 
dow, Executive Secretary, Text Editor, and Word Power. It will handle 
any word processor that generates standard DOS 3.3 text or binary files. 
There are also Pascal, CP/M, and Super-Text versions available. 

Third, the program does much more than verify spelling. It tabulates 
the total number of words used in the entire text and the number of 
unique words (counting only the first use of every word). The printer op- 
tion prints alphabetic lists of both, with the number of times each word is 
used printed next to the word. This is a tremendous boon to the profes- 
sional writer or editor, making it easy to spot overusage of words and 
phrases. Each potentially misspelled word is screened "within context" 
(showing several words before and after the problem word in the manu- 
script), and the program provides for wild card search of the entire dic- 
tionary to locate the correct spelling. 

Fourth, the dictionary is upgradable through the program. New 
words can be flagged during the verification process for later automatic 
addition to the dictionary proper. While the main program is protected 
(a back-up copy is included), the two dictionary disks are not, so the fre- 
quently used main files can be backed up for safety. When the diction- 
ary adds the new words, it automatically re-sorts all files onto a new disk, 
adding the new words in at their proper place. 

Fifth, the package is special. The looseleaf manual has a special 
pouch on the inside front cover holding a hardback copy of the com- 
plete Random House Dictionary used on the disks. This provides val- 
uable support for the program by affording easy access while writing, 
thus cutting down on the verification time. Special plastic pages hold the 
four disks that come with the program, so everything is kept neat and 
orderly. 



Yet, however good this program, it doesn't eliminate the need for hu- 
man editing. As the manual notes, the sentence "Dead ewe right too 
hymn?" will be verified without question. Also, errors in syntax will not 
be picked up by the computer. 

Sensible Speller is a topnotch professional package that belongs on 
your desk if you're involved in word processing. RRA

Bioomfield, MI 48033; 313-399-8877). S125. 

Honinbo Warrior. By Mark Watson. There's a lot of game software out 
there — programs that play some kind of game against you; programs 
whose purpose is to be an "opponent on disk" whenever you want to 
play. There are programs to play you at chess and checkers, bridge and 
blackjack, tick-tack-toe and twenty questions — not to mention those 
pushy young upstarts like Pac-Man and Wizardry. But in all this abun- 
dance, one game is missing: a game that is older than chess, and at least 
as popular. There is no program that will let you play go with your 
Apple — until now. 

In case you're not familiar with go, it's a Chinese/ Japanese board 
game, somewhat similar to chess. As in chess, the pieces used by the two 
players represent units of two armies in combat, and each player's task is 
to position his pieces so they can capture the enemy — but there the re- 
semblance ends. Go is to chess as a diagramless crossword puzzle is to a 
normal one: the structure develops during the game. 

For this and other reasons, it's difficult even to describe the game to a 
computer in a useful way, let alone ask the computer to evaluate pos- 
sible moves. The "value" of a particular move at a particular point in a 
particular game depends on two and only two things: the relative loca- 
tion of each stone played so far — probably about a hundred of them — 
and the relative location of every stone yet to be played (another hun- 
dred or so). 

How do you tell a computer about that? 

The result is, if you're a go player, that you either find "soft people" 
(fiesh-and-blood humans) to play with, or you go without. Which can be 
difficult, for a beginner. 

But that, as they say, was yesterday. Honinbo Warrior is no super- \ 
hero, but he knows the moves. Now you can learn the basic patterns of ) 
play and experiment with them to your heart's content, with a tireless ( 
sparring partner. Now you can play go with your Apple! ! 

It won't be a master-level game. Honinbo-san is what you might call 
a well-trained novice: he knows how to place his stones properly, but he 
falls into traps a lot. However, from a beginner's viewpoint, that's not at i 
all bad — you want to be able to beat the teacher every so often. It's very 
satisfying to see the message, "Honinbo resigns," even after a fairly easy 
game. [ 

On booting the disk you will see a title page, which is followed (press i 
any key) by several pages of introduction and instructions. Finally you 
will come to a go board, with the columns lettered A through N across 
the bottom and the rows numbered 1 through D (hex) up the side. 

That's smaller than a normal go board (nineteen by nineteen) and not 
much use for heavy exercises in strategy; but it gives plenty of room to 
practice your local tactics — you can have four or five attacks going at 
once — and it's a size the Apple can handle in reasonable time. 

A moment after you see the board, Honinbo will announce his move: 
the message "C4 Honinbo" will be displayed, and a black stone (actual- 
ly a blue circle) will appear on the board at the intersection of vertical hne 
C and horizontal line 4 (sometimes Honinbo will open on C3 or D4 in- 
stead, but he always uses one of the classic corner openings). 

Then you will hear a short musical phrase from the speaker, reminis- 
cent of a battlefield trumpet-call, which you will soon learn to recognize 
as Honinbo-san's way of saying, "Your move!" 

Type in the column and row designations of the point you want to 
play on. Your move will not be entered until you hit return — if you have 
second thoughts, press the back-arrow two or three times and start over. 

When you press return, your move will be listed under Honinbo's, 
and a white stone will appear on the board at the designated point. Hon- 
inbo-san will think about it for a while and then announce his next move 
as before. Frequently he will also add a little comment, such as "I want 
more territory!" or "You think you can invade?" or — after you've pulled 
off something particularly neat — "Smallpoint!"

The system takes care of saying "atari!" (a go word similar to 
"check!" in chess) for both sides and uses another musical phrase, this 
one with overtones of panic. It also manages captures, removing the 
dead and hning them up beside the board. In other words, it does pretty 
much what you'd expect of a go-playing program. 

And it includes a neat personal touch. Your name is written perma- 
nently into the program when you buy it, so you are always listed auto- 
matically as Honinbo-san's opponent. 

This is a byproduct of the author's elegant approach to the matter of 
copy-protection. You can make as many copies of the disk as you like — 
but they will all have your name on them! Whenever one of your moves 
is listed during a game, it is credited to the buyer of the disk. And the 
program includes several hidden validity checks, so unauthorized tam- 
pering will crash the system. (Note: for this and other reasons, Honinbo 
Warrior is not distributed through retail stores. It is only available direct 
from the author.) 

So much for the good stuff. It must be said that the program is not 
perfect — in fact, it's not finished. This is version II, and III is expected 
early next year (updates will be available, at a nominal cost, to pur- 
chasers of II). 

There is a small bug in the program. When you capture a stone by 
playing on the edge of the board, the system sometimes gets confused 
and redraws the captured stone on the point it was taken from, still sur- 
rounded by your men. However, the fault seems to be in the display only, 
the system logic knows that the black stone is not really there, and it will 
let you play a stone on that point if you choose to. 

Another problem is that there is no manual for the program. You get 
a disk and nothing else. However, system operation is so simple that you 
don't really need a book with this one— except, of course, a good book 
on go, which you get on your own. 

Or, to make a long story short: 

Once upon a time there was a man who traveled a great distance to 
see a horse which could, it was said, walk upright on its hind legs. The 
horse performed as advertised, but with much wobbling and little grace. 
When asked about this, the man replied; "How well it is done is not the 
issue. What is remarkable is that it should be done at all!"

Star Maze. By Gordon Eastman, based on an original game design 
by Robert Woodhead. From a technical standpoint Star Maze is an 
incredible accomplishment. Utilizing eighteen hi-res colors, it features 
multidirectional scrolling. As the position of your ship changes, the speed 
at which the screen ripples is something to behold. The object of the 
game is to recover nine power jewels randomly scattered around a large 
maze. This is not your ordinary puzzle, however, as the maze is con- 
structed of passageways through and around giant multicolored marsh- 
mallows of varying shapes and sizes. Anything that hits these marsh- 
mallows bounces off them at ninety degrees, unless your ship is going 
slowly; then it sinks partway into the wall before bouncing back. Shots 
fired from your spaceship carom off the walls. It is also possible to be 
going up a narrow corridor and, by angling your shots, lay down an 
incredible crossfire in front of you. Your ship has unlimited shots and an 
auto-fire button. If you are surrounded by aliens, you can either jump 
around the maze in hyperspace at the cost of fuel, or you can use one of 
your few antimatter bombs to wipe out every alien on the screen. When 
the jewels are recovered, they must be returned to your mothership for 
credit. Refueling is also possible at the mothership, but it is a rather 
tricky maneuver matching speeds. 

Speed control is really the crux of this game. Although there are nine 
varieties of alien enemies that have to be fought (some of whom mutate 
upon being hit), the focus of the game is on controlling the speed and 
direction of your ship through the maze in search of the power jewels. 
This is very difficult to do, as the slightest thrust in the wrong direction 
can amplify your velocity and make the ship very difficult to slow down 
and control. The speed of the ship goes from 0 to about 980 and is meas- 
ured along each component of the x, y axes. To stop and change direc- 
tion means nullifying all of the component vectors. To make things more 
fun, the ship has limited fuel that can only be replaced at the mother- 
ship, if you pass through the ship at a speed of under 100. The fuel gauge

on this ship resembles that of an old Chevy for the first half of the gauge 
it goes really slowly, but the last half goes really fast. Being annihilated 
for running out of fuel is the most common cause of destruction in this 
game. 

Capturing all nine of the jewels gains you the next level. There are six- 
teen different mazes, and winning your way through all earns you the 
title of ace. Unfortunately, the game lacks a level indicator, so the player 
has a difficult time keeping track of how many more levels he has to go 
to win the title. The successful player will have to have a very delicate 
sense of control to tame the ship, but then it can be a really fun game to 
play. RRA

Prism. By Mark James Capella and Ronald N. Roberts. Everyone loves 
a good fairy tale, and, when you combine one with a fabulous treasure 
hunt, the result is a very exciting product. Prism is the first program in 
International Software Marketing's Storydisk line. The tale is woven 
around the adventures of a young boy, Hubert, as he strives to recover 
the three stolen "keys of color." These keys, each representing a primary 
color, activate the mystical prism. The prism functions as the source of 
all the color in the world, and with its deactivation, the whole world is 
drained of color. The story is told in text and thoroughly illustrated in hi- 
res panels with some very slick animation. 

After many heroic qjisodes, Hubert manages momentarily to retrieve 
the three keys from the evil Lord Grane of Yolsva, but at the last mo- 
ment he loses them and they are scattered across the face of the earth. 

Herein lies the treasure hunt. ISM has actually hidden three real keys 
somewhere in the continental United States. The yellow key is ten karat 
gold with a three-quarter carat topaz on the handle. The red key is four- 
teen karat gold with a three-quarter carat ruby, and the blue key is eigh- 
teen karat gold with a three-quarter carat blue-white diamond. The first 
f)erson who physically finds one of these keys is the winner of that key. 
The story contains clues to the location of each of these keys. Some of 
the clues are readily apparent; others are diabolically hidden within the 
story. There are meanings upon meanings, enough to keep puzzle solv- 
ers going for quite a while. 

Only when the three keys are physically united with the prism, which 
resides at ISM, will the conclusion to the Prism story unfold. 

The reading level is geared for ten-year-olds to twelve-year-olds, and 
younger children enjoy watching the pictures and having the story read 
to them. With the treasure hunt thrown in, this can be fun for the whole 
family. RRA

Odin. By Larry Atkin and Peter Frey. Its origins are obscure, a condi- 
tion probably contributed to by the several name changes it has under- 
gone over the years of its existence. It has been called Annexation, Re- 
versi, and most recently, Othello, and has undergone changes in rules as 
often as changes in name. The most recent incarnation has given it both 
renewed popularity and a degree of standardization; tournament play is 
now regulated by the United States Othello Association. 

For those unfamiliar with the board game, the rules are simple. The 
playing field is an eight-by-eight square field. The playing pieces are small 
plastic disks, black on one side and white on the other. One player plays 
black and the other white, and in the initial setup the four innermost 
squares are covered by one piece each. The pieces on two opposite cor- 
ners of this innermost square have the white side up, and on the other 
two pieces the black side is up. 

The white player goes first, placing a piece white side up on any 
square where, with other white pieces, it will surround one or more black 
pieces. The word "surround" is being used here in a two dimensional 
sense. Any number of black pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal 
line may be surrounded by two — and only two — white pieces positioned at 
the ends of the line, one of which must be the piece just placed. The 
placement of a single piece may cause opposing pieces to be surrounded 
in any or all of eight directions around it. The black pieces surrounded 
are then flipped over to become white pieces. The black player then does 
the same thing, attempting to surround and flip the white player's pieces. 



The players take turns until either the board is filled with pieces or 
neither player can move, at which point the player with the most pieces 
on the board is the winner. 

See? Simple. Actually, it is much easier to understand with a board in 
front of you, or, in the case of Odin, a computer screen. Odesta has de- 
veloped a program that not only plays a devastating game of Othello, but 
also helps you get the hang of it as you go along. It is like playing against 
a brilliant opponent who is also a patient teacher. 

All input is accepted through a single game paddle, or the arrows and 
the return key if you don't have paddles. Turning the paddle dial or 
pushing the arrow keys moves a cursor on the screen through the board 
positions of all your possible moves and a menu of other options that are 
designed to provide maximum flexibility. Pushing the paddle button or 
the return key either accepts that position as your move or selects that 
option. This is an excellent method of input. It doesn't stand between you 
and the game. 

The menu options available are designed to help you study the game. 
Change lets you change any pieces on the board. This is useful for setting 
up hypothetical situations and studying how to play them. 

Expect shows you what the computer thinks is your best move, based 
on the look-ahead analysis it has made on its previous turn. Scores shows 
you the relative strengths of all the moves open to you. This assessment, 
unlike the one in the Expect option, is not based on a long-range analy- 
sis, but on the immediate number of positions to be gained or lost by the 
moves. Experience will show that the move that turns the most pieces is 
not necessarily the best move to make. The player who seems in the lead 
in the middle of a game of Othello may be thoroughly trounced by the 
end. This is a lesson that Odin is particularly adept at teaching. 

Move is an interesting command. It tells the computer to take over 
your position in the game and allows you to play its position. This is an 
act of desperation for the student. It can often teach Oiat even a hopeless 
situation has some escape. It can also teach that you have no chance 
against Odin in the higher levels of play. Which brings us to another 
unique feature of Odin. It allows you to choose from among fifteen 
levels, and to change the level at any time during the game. 

Restore will take back the last move, allowing you to go again. 
Replay shows you the whole game as it progressed from beginning to 
end. Both of these are useful as learning tools. 

The care that went into the programming of Odin is matched by the 
care that went into the preparation of the manual. It is clean and well 
organized, with diagrams to help explain the fine points of the game. 
Each option is fully described in a logical sequence. An appendix dis- 
cusses the history of the game and some observations on the strategy 
behind it. Experts can't seem to agree on the best strategy for Othello. 
This is probably because experts suffer from human frailties. Most of the 
observations on strategy in the manual seem to come from the way the 
computer plays the game. With its being able to look ahead as far as 
twelve moves into the future, the computer is as close to infallible as an 
Othello player can be. 

That fact can make Odin a frustrating opponent. It is not recom- 
mended that you give up human opponents for Odin. We doubt that the 
human ego can survive that kind of abuse. What Odin can provide for 
the beginner and expert alike is a way of learning new strategies and 
keeping in practice for your favorite flesh-and-blood opponent. And 
when that match occurs, Odin has an option for supervising a two-player 
game as well. DD

Spy's Demise. By Alan Zeldin. There is no such thing as an Everyman 
video game. Rarely on the hi-res screen will you see glorified the life of 
Joe Normal. Your character in Penguin's latest entry in this larger-than- 
life medium is an adventurer, but he is also a loner. He is the secret agent, 
the international spy; unable to trust anyone, unable to confide in any- 
one. Not even the elevator boy. 

How's that for a role model? In Spy's Demise, every move you make 
is at risk of bodily harm. This game requires daring and quick reflexes. 
As a nice change from the typical arcade format, it doesn't require you to 
kill anything. That doesn't mean that you won't get killed. You will. Fre- 
quently. 

Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to get to the top of a 
building while enemy spies attempt to crush you with elevators. This may 
seem a bit odd, but to get to the top of a building, you have to run your 
figure, a thoroughly suspicious-looking chap wearing a trench coat and 
dark glasses and stealthily carrying a briefcase, from one side of each 
floor to the other. At the end of each floor is a lift that takes you up a 
level. 

Meanwhile, an evil cadre of even more Sam Spadeish types constant- 



Hi 



ly ride a set of elevators up and down the building at varying speeds. They 
never leave the elevators, but if one happens to intersect your path as you 
run by, you vanish in a very smoky explosion (what was in that brief- 
case?). This traumatic event is accompanied by the opening bars of 
"Secret Agent Man." 

The points you get for each level depend entirely on how quickly 
you can reach your goal. The seconds tick away on a digital display at 
the top of the screen, but don't let them pressure you. Try to go too fast 
and you won't make it at all. On top of that, there are flashing dots that 
appear for bonus points. Do you risk your neck to go back to get them, 
or do you just try to survive? Think fast; the meter is running. 

As an added bonus, when you complete each of nine screens part of 
a coded message will appear. Penguin is offering a Spy's Demise T-shirt 
to the first person from each state to solve the cryptogram. This may 
actually take a while. Not that cryptograms are very diflicult, but com- 
pleting nine levels in Spy's Demise will take a James Bond of video 
games. DD

the leaders, and Spectacular Bid regains the ground he lost. Vigors and 
Exceller trail. 

Into the far turn, the pace is telling on the leaders, but J. O. Tobin 
continues to race neck and neck with Ack Ack. Stymie is looking for 
room along the rail, War Admiral is forced wide, and Spectacular Bid 
has moved up to challenge. Vigors and Exceller are starting their moves 
and are closing ground rapidly. 

Into the stretch, they're four across the track. Stymie found room 
along the rail and has moved into first. Ack Ack is inside J. O. Tobin and 
has him by a head. War Admiral's in the middle of the track in full stride 
and Spectacular Bid is looking for an opening. Vigors and Exceller are 
closing fast. 

Past the eighth pole. Stymie has the lead. War Admiral's moved into 
second. Ack Ack holds third, but the pace has gotten to J. O. Tobin, 
who's veered out. Spectacular Bid and Exceller make for the space left by 
J. O. Tobin, while Vigors goes way wide in an attempt to circle the field. 

As they come to the finish, it's Stymie and War Admiral neck and 
neck. Exceller has Spectacular Bid by a nose as both gain ground. Vig- 
ors is in high gear on the outside as Ack Ack and J. O. Tobin drop back. 

At the finish, Vigors gets up for the win. Spectacular Bid gets his 
nose to wire ahead of War Admiral as Stymie falters to fourth and 
Exceller is fifth. Ack Ack and J. O. Tobin trail. 

Horse Racing Classic comes as near as anything yet to capturing the 
excitement of the racetrack on an Apple II. The folks from British Co- 
lumbia have pulled off a programming tour de force to pack a disk this 
full. You get one hundred horses available to run on a nine-race card. 
There's an official track program that announces the entrants in the next 
race along with the weights they are carrying and the odds. 

There's a racing form that includes data on the odds, jockey, trainer, 
number of times in the money, and charts for the last two races run by 
each horse. You're provided with one hundred dollars pocket money to 
bet as you will as the card progresses. 

The races themselves are fully animated, although Bill Budge won't 
lose any sleep over the techniques used. And the results are automatical- 
ly updated to the horses' files at the end of the race. There are a lot of 
niceties that make this program a pleasure. 

But is it a good simulation of a day at the races? Absolutely not. The 
fault lies not so much with the programmers or their choices as with the 
6502. The Apple II, with 48K of RAM and three or four screen re- 
freshes a second, just can't do justice to something as complicated as a 
seven-horse race. On the other hand, imagine these Canadians loose with 
an Apple IV! They're three-fourths of the way to a superior program, 
given the speed and memory we're led to believe the Apple IV will have. 

A cynical reviewer could have a lot of fun with the flaws. The horses 
round the curves sideways, thus appearing ready to bolt into the infield 
or through the fence back to the barn. The players do not have the op- 
tion of controlling which horses will enter which races. The horses do run 
true to their electronic racing form, but any resemblance between that 
form and its real-life counterpart is purely coincidental. 

These things take on less importance in the middle of a race, when 
you're urging Secretariat to make his move while the person next to you 
is pleading for Foolish Pleasure to hold on. Horse Racing Classic may be 
less than perfect, but punters everywhere will love it. 

It's the real McCoy, and let me tell you, boys; you'll have a ton of fun 
backing Equipoise. Can do. Can do. On your Apple II you can do. ART

The Cosmic Balance. By Paul Murray. Paul Murray's Warp Factor is 
among the best of the space battle games for the Apple. It's challenging 
and exciting, with a wide variety of spaceship types and scenarios to keep 
it interesting for either two players or one player against the computer. 
But despite its popularity, it has one glaring drawback that it shares with 
most games of its type it is painfully slow. 

This isn't too surprising, as a really good space battle simulation has 
to do a lot of complicated calculations just to monitor the game. Playing 
the game requires that the computer make moves in a logical way. Even 
a beginner could easily beat a computer that was just tossing around ran- 
dom numbers, so the computer as player takes even more time. 



Now we have The Cosmic Balance by the same author, a game that is 
not only in the same genre but seems to use a lot of the same conven- 
tions as well. Is this Warp Factor II, The Wrath of Murray? The first sce- 
nario involves two starships fighting a battle to the death. Their names 
are — you guessed it — Enterprise and Reliant. 

So why has Strategic Simulations released a game that is so similar to 
The Warp Factof! Well, The Cosmic Balance is a member of their new 
Rapid Fire line, and as that implies, it plays much faster than its prede- 
cessor. There is actually no time lapse between the moment the player 
finishes giving orders and the beginning of battle display. This is not the 
only change or improvement over the earlier game, but in view of how 
slow most space simulations are, it is surely the most impressive. 

For those who are unfamiliar with this sort of game, it plays like this: 
certain victory conditions — most commonly, your survival and the ene- 
my's demise — are assigned at the beginning of the game. You are given a 
ship or a fleet of ships with which to accomplish your objective. Here lies 
one of the differences of The Cosmic Balance. In this game you must ac- 
tually design your ship before you start the game (except in the first sce- 
nario, which allows the newcomer to gain some experience as a com- 
mander before donning the role of designer). 

Designing a ship of the complexity required would seem to be an ex- 
tremely difficult task. You have only one resource to limit what you put 
into a ship: space (the final frontier). The manual lists all the things you 
might want to put into the ship — engines, drives, weapon systems, and so 
on — and how much space each occupies. All you have to do is select a 
component from the menu and the computer will tell you how much 
space is left. If you run out of space and still need to add something cru- 
cial, you'll find that it is as easy to remove a component as it is to add 
one. All the information is efficiently gathered on one screen, so you 
aren't required to remember what you have done already; it's all there in 
front of you. 

The great thing about being able to design your own ships is that you 




184

can specialize them for a given purpose. In the Planetary Raid scenario, 
you must attack a planet that has very strong defenses. However, you 
will find that it is better defended against guided "seeker" missiles than 
against siege phasers. Solution: design a ship with no seekers and use the 
space to augment your power supply. 

If you are playing against the computer, after designing your own 
ship you must also design your opponent's. If you think it will ruin the 
surprise to play against a ship you just designed, the manual suggests that 
you make several and select among them randomly. The recommended 
method of selection: rolling dice, of all things. 

Now you're ready to begin. Movement is simultaneous. In the two- 
player game, player one enters orders secretly, then player two goes, and 
then the computer executes all the orders. In the solitaire version, the 
computer seems to be making its decisions at the same time as the play- 
er. Orders for charging shields, charging and firing weapons, and mak- 
ing course and speed changes can be given in any order. All the orders 
are displayed on one screen at all times (except when you request a hi-res 
tactical display, which is necessary for determining the relative positions 
of the enemy ships), so it is easy to see what you've done already and re- 
scind any bad commands. 

Like its predecessor, The Cosmic Balance has only a partial alle- 
giance to the laws of physics. It takes as much energy to decelerate your 
ship as it does to accelerate, which is as it should be. However, it takes no 
energy at all to turn. All you have to do is point the ship's nose in an- 
other direction and all forward momentum is deflected — which is fine if 
you're an airplane, but the same rules should not apply in a frictionless 
environment. Admittedly this won't annoy most people, and it doesn't 
really detract from the fun of this game, but there are a few hard-core 
science-fiction fanatics out there who are dying to see somebody get it 
right.

computer arcade games. Even before the advent of that pie chart refu- 
gee, Pac-Man, maze games were common microcomputer fare. And 



there have been some memorable meals, so to speak, but more often 
than not one is hungry again in an hour. 

Yet maze games are something of a constant in any computer gam- 
er's diet. And a pleasurable one, even if only in a fleeting way. Most pub- 
lishers serve up some maze game variant, but the biggest eater in town 
these days seems to be DataMost. And they got Master Chef Bob Bish- 
op to prepare their latest offering. 

The name says it rather succinctly. Each maze in Money Munchers is 
carpeted with dollars. You are the kid in the candy shop. Actually, 
you're a small fellow who seems to swim through the mazes, raking in 
the dough just as fast as he can. There are the Money Munchers, of 
course, who are also intent on reaping the pecuniary harvest. They wan- 
der about scarfing up money whenever they chance upon it, paying little 
heed to anything else in the maze. Should one latch onto you instead of a 
greenback — well, bye-bye. When the loot is all gone, colorful kaleido- 
scopic patterns entertain you while the next maze is readied. If you sur- 
vive a level, you gain an extra life. 

The next two mazes also contain spiders — lethal ones, naturally. But 
they do not pursue you either; they merely patrol patches of money. You 
could simply avoid them, but it would be such a shame to leave all that 
nice cash to the ambling Munchers. 

By the time you reach the fourth level, a truly inimical presence is felt. 
There are these snakes, and they hunt you. No matter where you are, the 
closest serpent will home in on you, and the others all begin to wriggle to- 
ward you. They, too, can be avoided, but only with a great deal of effort 
and persistence. Unfortunately, the Money Munchers and the spiders are 
still there, making it quite crowded. 

And just in case you get any silly notions about figuring out the pat- 
terns to run in the mazes, chef Bishop has prepared a true surprise: You 
never see the same maze twice. For these are random mazes, thousands 
of them! 

Like most good maze games. Money Munchers is quite addictive. 
While it does not have the distinctiveness of some recent variations on 
the eternal formula, it is a lot of fun. The denizens of the mazes are clear- 
ly identifiable and quite nicely animated, while the money carpet changes

only in area, never in design. Green is a constant throughout the game. 

DataMost is becoming quite reliable for this particular genre. Money 
Munchers is the sixth game they've released that is played in mazes. It has 
its own identity and easily stands apart from the others. It is a lot of fun 
to play. 

But, as with most maze games, one is left feeling hungry after an hour 
or so.

Watson. By Bill Sefton and Mark Pump. As Holmes had his trusted as- 
sistant, so does the Inspector from Omega Microware have its com- 
panion. Watson is a sophisticated disk sleuthing utility that requires the 
Inspector to be resident in memory to work. More than just an add-on, 
Watson actually piggybacks the Inspector. The program is unique be- 
cause it is available on either a plug-in chip (replacing the current D8 
EPROM) or, for those who own language cards, on a disk. There are 
twelve new functions that Watson will do. 

One of the most important features is the ability to reconstruct 
VTOC for a blown disk. This allows the VTOC from the bad disk to be 
read, and then Watson rebuilds the track bit map from the catalog track. 
Another function provides for hex ASCII disassembhng, which is a 
great aid for programmers. All track and sector lists can be displayed, 
thus aiding the reconstruction of a blown catalog. Sectors can be locked 
in or freed and extra space cleared by killing DOS on tracks 1 and 2. 

If you have ever made a copy of an important file disk and won- 
dered, in the back of your mind, whether all of it copied, then the disk 
verification function will be much appreciated. It compares the sector 
checksums of each disk to make sure they are the same. Another very im- 
portant utility for programmers is the File Follower. This program great- 
ly aids in debugging your own programs. It allows a file to be scanned 
sector by sector automatically. It is this bloodhound talent that really 
earns this package its title. It's certainly not for the average user, but 
geared for the sophisticated progrmmer who needs such utilities. RRA

Plaza, Chicago, IL 60606; 312-648-4844). $49.95. 

Dnieper River Line. By Bruce A. Ketchledge and Gary Sipes. Avalon 
Hill has for many, many years been the premier war game company in 
the United States. Many people's first contact with strategic games was 
over an Avalon Hill board game like Tactics II, Gettysburg, or D-Day. 
To date, their efforts in the computer field have been directed primarily 
at the TRS-80 cassette market, with a few programs translated for the 
Apple. Now, however, the company is directly addressing the Apple 
market also. 

Dnieper River Line is certainly Avalon Hill's best effort yet to trans- 
late their vast board experience onto the computer. The lack of graphics 
is partially compensated by the enclosed playing map. The 8x11 map is 
broken into a 12 x 12 grid. Accompanying the map are 352 standard 
cardboard counters. Each counter represents a different division. 

The scenario of the game is the Soviet crossing of the Dnieper River 
in late 1943. The computer plays the Russians and you play the German 
officer commanding the Army Group South. There are six objective 
areas on the map. At the start, the computer will secretly select three of 
these areas as objectives. If the computer achieves those objectives, it 
wins. The German commander is given only fifteen initial units to de- 
ploy along the river, but he can lay down mine fields and deploy garri- 
son troops in the towns. The Russian side has a random mix of twenty- 
two possible units deployed secretly across the river. 

The game moves very fast. The German commander is always strain- 
ing to catch glimpses of the enemy forces and to determine the Russians' 
objectives. The computer, with words alone, does a credible job of show- 
ing garbled communications and disjointed visualization as the Russians 
lay down heavy artillery and smoke barrages. The terrain makes rapid 
deployment of reserve forces difficult, and, seemingly at the worst possi- 
ble moment, one of your key divisions may not be able to move due to 
mechanical breakdowns. Erratic off-map artillery can provide miracu- 
lous support or be unavailable for hours. 

Mastery of this game will take quite a while, as it is very difficult for 
the German side even to get a draw. Dnieper River Line is not for the be- 
ginning strategy player. It is more like a tough, middle-game, chess prob-

lem. If Avalon Hill ever develops the ability to achieve complex color 
graphics on the Apple, they would certainly become one of the most for- 
midable forces in microcomputer games. I^RA 
Dnieper River Line, by Bruce A. Ketchledge and Gary Sipes, Microcomputer 
Games, a division of the Avalon Hill Game Company (4517 Harford Road, Bal- 
timore, MD 21214; 301-254-5300). $30. 

Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. By Stuart Smith. One of the famous 
stories from the Arabian nights is retold in delightful hi-res color as a 
role-playing fantasy game. You are the famous Ali Baba and the sultan 
has asked you to rescue his daughter Princess Buddir Al-Buddoor, who 
has been kidnapped. Ali Baba can call on a variety of allies to assist him 
in overcoming ferocious tigers (great image), bandits, magical swords, 
and a large variety of monsters — more than one hundred at last count. 
Each ally and monster has its own strength allotment, weapons, and 
armor. There is even a deadly dragon with incredible statistics. If this 
does not sound hard enough, the monsters have a reincarnation ratio, 
which, luckily, you can adjust for difficulty. 

Trading posts exist where better weapons and armor can be bought. 
Until he can equip himself better, it is very hard for Ali Baba to survive. 
The game is divided into dungeons and outside areas. Each section has a 
different feel to it. Gold can be found throughout both sections, in chests. 
Unfortunately, some of the chests are booby-trapped, and most are 
guarded by monsters. The trapped chests inflict damage to the person 
opening the chest. When a character's strength goes down to zero, he 
dies. Resurrection is occasionally possible, but it means starting over at 
Ali Baba's house. 

One of the finest parts of the game is its music. The computer plays 
Scheherazade very well, at many different spots in the program. One of 
these places is when you find a mystical rune. These runes (to musical ac- 
companiment) convey special secret messages that can be of great aid in 
playing the game. However, these runes also have a nasty habit of 
exploding after they are read. 

On your wanderings you might free two other captives, Abdalla and 
Morgiana, who are so grateful that they follow you and assist you in 
your quest. Beware of moving statues and collapsing tunnels. If you are 
very virtuous, a unicorn may aid you in fighting the monsters. Things are 
not what they seem in many parts of the dungeon, so explore very 
cautiously. 

The author of this program has included a private challenge to each 
person playing it. The player must use only Ali Baba (no allies) and not 
strike out at a single monster, even in defense. Then when he rescues the 
princess and returns her to the sultan, a special message comes on the 
screen with the author's personal congratulations on achieving a non- 
violent solution to the game. 

Since the game plays very easily, children can enjoy this as an intro- 
ductory fantasy role-playing game. In fact, whole groups can play at 
once, each person being a different ally of Ali Baba and aiding him on his 
quest. This very different hi-res adventure should be part of every game 
player's collection. RRA

Battlesight. By Major C. Hanselmann, D. Lubar, V. Bauman, J. An- 
derson, and E. Wolcott. Finally a serious tank-to-tank warfare game has 
been developed. It's the first day of World War III. The Warsaw Pact 
forces have crossed the West German border in full force. Your job is to 
try to stop them, or delay them as long as possible, with your force of five 
M60A3 tanks dug in on the high ground overlooking the Russian ave- 
nue of approach. Your intelligence team delivers a profile of the oppos- 
ing forces. They consist mainly of the Soviet T-62 tanks, which are 
medium tanks but hold the world's record for firing the fastest tank 
rounds. There are also, scattered throughout the attack force, the heavi- 
er armored T-64 and T-72 tanks which are more accurate at greater 
distances. 

The Soviets have also deployed some of their Hind-A missile-launch- 
ing helicopters, which are very accurate at long range. The enemy is using 
low-flying aircraft to try to spot out your position, so that their forces 
can zero in on your tank force. Fortunately, the Soviet forces are ap- 
proaching in a spearhead formation; thus each wave consists of slightly 
more tanks than the previous wave. The game is over if all five members 



of your tank force was destroyed, or if you let five of the enemy tanks 
slip by. 

The movement of the tank and its operations are what makes this 
game unique. Tremendous attention to detail has been incorporated in- 
to Batdesight. Both the turret and the treads are movable. Taken into 
consideration are the speed of the individual tanks on both sides, the 
time to reload, the speed of the tank rounds and the missiles in flight, the 
turret traversal speed, the rate of fire, the kill probability at varying dis- 
tances, and the firing accuracy while stationary or moving. Far shots have 
a lower probability of hitting than close ones, but if you wait too long the 
reload time and the turning speed of your turret will delay your shooting 
another enemy, enabling him to escape. 

Designed for the TG joystick or its equivalent, Batdesight gives a 
very realistic feel to the handling of a tank under battle conditions. The 
low-flying observation planes are shot down with the tank's machine 
gun, fired by hitting the space bar. Your tank can also suffer varying de- 
grees of damage before it is fully destroyed. The turret can get damaged, 
or the treads blown off, immobilizing the tank. You even have the op- 
tion to repair the tank, although you are defenseless during that time. 
Surviving successive waves with the same tank can increase the effi- 
ciency rating of its crew, thus bettering their odds on hitting a far target 
and shortening the reload time. 

When you feel you have become really proficient at this game, then 
you can add the option of night warfare for a really fantastic challenge. 
Every other wave makes its attack under cover of darkness. The only 
time you can get a quick glimpse of the advancing force is from the flash 
of their muzzles when they fire, or from a quick magnesium flare. The 
player has to develop a keen sense of distance and rate of tank speed in 
order to fire accurately under these conditions. 

Battlesight even provides a lesson on strategy for the player. It is ap- 
propriately called "Helpful Hints for Hopefiil Heroes." At the end of the 
game a detailed profile is given showing tanks destroyed, shots fired, 
crew efficiency, and overall tank performance. 

This is Versa's first action game, and it is certainly hoped that this 
fine team will produce other high-quality games. Battlesight is a superb 
modern tank warfare simulation. RRA

Warp Destroyer. By Thomas Ball and Eric Varsanyi. It's nice how some 
games naturally go together. Zorksl and II, Wizardry and Knight of Dia- 
monds, and the S.A.G.A. Series, for instance. And after a few rounds of 
Warp Destroyer, you'll feel like playing another Piccadilly game: Sui- 
cide, for instance. 

You'll be having a ball shooting up probots and enemy craft while 
producing enough noise to make punk rock sound like Mantovani. Then 
it will hit you: "What's the point of all this, anyway?" 

Warp Destroyer features some fine graphics, luscious and noisy 
sound effects, and a story line that justifies all the seemingly pointless 
shooting and bombing that goes on. According to the instructions, it is 
the year 3526, and your lifetime enemies, the Zalbians, have broken the 
Neutrality Pact of 3103 (after four hundred years, isn't it time for a new 
pact?). Your mission is to recapture your twelve planets from these im- 
perialist expansionists. 

You must go through five phases to rescue each planet. The first re- 
quires you to keep a small cross lined up in your crosshairs while you go 
through subspace. If you let it drift too far, you have to start over. The 
next three phases involve shooting at mines, fighters, and probes, before 
finally making your assault on the Zaibian base. Positioning the cross- 
hairs is a breeze with a joystick; don't even attempt to use paddles or the 
keyboard unless you're a glutton for frustration. 

The hard part is making a hit. Warp doesn't afford you the luxury of 
light-speed laser blasts or ion cannons. Instead, you get missiles that look 
more like diminishing rectangles than anything else as they fade into the 
distance and take what seems hke forever to find their targets. Firing 
them is fun, though. You are allowed to fire several shots at a time, so 
many that the screen will fill with flying rectangles obstructing your view 
of the targets. 

And obstruct they will, because the only way to hit anything is to fire

like CTazy and hope that your missiles happen to explode as your target 
drifts by them. If you're good at predicting where randomly moving ob- 
jects will be a half second later, you'll do fine. 

The attack on the Zalbian base is faintly amusing at best. After firing 
through gaps in the base's moving shield and spreading several shots 
evenly across the base, you must hit the return key to detonate them. 
Bopm ! Now what? Those crazy Zalbians seem to go on living as though 
nothing had happened. Boom! Boom again! Still nothing. Unfortunatdy, 
the instructions don't give the slightest hint on how "evenly distributed" 
your shots should be to destroy the base successfully. Maybe if you keep 
shooting, they won't have time to eat and you can starve them to death. 

There are twelve levels, one for each planet you rescue, each more 
difficult than the last. If you like good graphics and strong sound eff"ects, 
if you like shooting at things and have a tireless button-pushing finger, 
then Warp Destroyer is for you. If you enjoy the feeling of achievement

Early Elementary I. By Steven Shotwell. Lo and behold a teaching 
program in which the manual starts out by specifying exactly what the 
program intends to teach! This program is aimod at students in pre- 
school through second grade, and will teach them to recognize and name 
fifteen colors, the numbers from one through twelve, and seven geo- 
metric shapes. As children work with the program, their eye-hand coor- 
dination will improve as well. 

Yes, this program is set up so that a child can run it alone. Once the 
system has been started, all the child has to do is press any key to indi- 
cate the answer. 

The basic format is this: a geometric shape (for example) is displayed 
on the upper half of the screen while a series of different shapes is dis- 
played, one after another, on the lower half. When the matching shape 
appears, the child may press any key to indicate the match. 

Correct answers are rewarded with a short musical phrase from the 
speaker and a message on the screen like "Great, John!" or "Super, 



Marsha!" (assuming the student typed in one of those names when 
prompted at the beginning) followed by a smiling face that winks. 
Wrong answers get a frowning or sorrowful face and no music. 

The program offers four different kinds of drills: Shape Match (de- 
scribed above); Color Match, which works similarly with blocks of dif- 
ferent colors; and two forms of number behavior — Number Drill and 
Count the Shapes. In Number Drill, a number word ("three" or "seven" 
or the like) in large characters fills the top half of the screen, and a se- 
quence of numerals, also large, flashes by on the lower half for match- 
ing. In Count the Shapes, a group of of objects (squares, circles, and the 
like) appears in the top half, and a sequence of numerals is displayed 
belovk^ the child must pick the numeral that matches the quantity of 
shapes displayed. 

In all of these modes, the system is always "busy": something is hap- 
pening all the time. This, plus the simple but effective animated graphics 
and the music, make it seem more like a game than a teaching device. 
Clearly the intent was to make the system fun for the kids to play with — 
if you don't tell them it's good for them, they'll probably love it! 

The system was obviously designed by a teacher with an orderly 
mind. It not only scores each run, it automatically records the score in a 
class record file under the student's name. Class records are only acces- 
sible through the teacher management file, which is locked by a 
password. 

Other options available through the teacher management file include 
turning the music on and off, changing the presentation speed of the 
answer choices, changing the number of questions in a drill, and the like. 

This is a very limited program in certain ways: it has a limited audi- 
ence and limited objectives. But that's not necessarily a disadvantage; 
tight limits permit a very sharp focus. The author knew exactly what he 
wanted to do, and he seems to have done it very well. If you're trying 
to teach these behaviors to a child in this age group, then this program 
could save you a lot of time!

Voyager I. By William Volk. Voyager I represents Avalon Hill's first ef- 
fort in the realm of computer graphics. Do not be put off by the picture 
on the box, which features the much cruder TRS-80 style graphics. The 
Apple version features the 3-D graphics perspective that Wizardry has 
made famous. 

The game revolves around your attempt to single-handedly destroy 
an alien spaceship from the inside. The Voyager I was built by a world of 
robotic warriors bent on galactic conquest. You have fought your way 
aboard and are trying either to capture the ship by killing all the robots 
or, failing that, to blow the ship up. The game is a combination arcade 
game and role-playing game in real time. There are four levels to the 
ship, each containing thirty-six rooms. 

A rapidly discharging laser rifle is your only weapon. Luckily, there 
are a few fully charged laser rifles lying around the ship waiting to be 
picked up. The screen shows the 3-D view of the ship's interior and three 
status thermometers, graduated from 0 to 100. One reflects your 
strength, another the charge left in your laser, and the third the per- 
centage of generator power left to run the ship. Strength points are lost 
with movement and as a result of battle with the robots. If your strength 
goes to zero while you're fighting, you're dead. 

The game is self-mapping. Areas that you've explored remain on the 
map until an entire level is revealed or until you change levels. When you 
go up or down the elevators to other levels, any part already explored is 
shown to you. Unfortunately, Voyager I suffers from a severe playing 
problem — it's impossible to lose! Every time you're killed, not only are 
you resurrected but you retain all your previous mapping. Any robots or 
generators you destroyed before your death remain destroyed. For those 
who prefer perseverance to skill development, it is always possible to win. 
Also, a special non-prize goes to the first person who can explain how a 
single rifle, held by one person, can fire, from the bottom corners of the 
screen, twin shots that converge on the center! 

Despite these problems, the game is fast-paced and enjoyable. The 
robots shoot fast and are hard to kill. A late suspense factor comes when 
you destroy the last generator. You have sixty seconds to reach a hidden 
shuttle craft and escape before the ship explodes. For a first effort in col- 
or graphics, Avalon Hill has done well. RRA

Oil Rig. By Kevin Bagley. J. R. Ewing may find that he has competi- 
tion. Now anyone can be as loathsome and greedy as he is. 

No matter how much they may curse OPEC and Exxon when prices 
go up at the pump in the real world, players of Oil Rig will pray for 
shortages when all their assets are in petroleum products and the gov- 
ernment is regulating them from here to Sunday. You laugh now, but 
when you are itching to sell your first-bom child to pay for that drilling 
platform before the price goes up another ten thousand dollars, and you 
suddenly realize that your last shred of humanity has long since disap- 
peared, don't say we didn't warn you! 

The game is played on what looks like a real-time VisiCalc spread- 
sheet. The display shows constantly fluctuating prices on six commodi- 
ties from crude to refined oil and eight kinds of equipment necessary in 
the oil business. The player starts armed only with one thousand dollars 
and his own business acumen. That amount of money is just exactly 
enough to prospect for oil once, but it won't begin to cover the expense 
of drilling for any oil that is discovered. So where is one supposed to get 
the kind of money necessary for the big time? Even J. R.'s senile old 
grandmother could tell you that buy low, sell high. 

For this reason it is best to start out dealing in commodities, which 
begin well within the lower price ranges (ten lo one hundred dollars per 
unit) and lluctuate from there to as high as one thousand dollars a unit 
based on such capricious events as OPEC price hikes (or reductions), 
government regulations (or "recommendations"), and the old standby, 
inflation. 

Each item on the display has a letter from A to N assigned to it, so 
business transactions are as easy as typing B F 10, which means buy (B) 
ten units of petroleum products (F). The display then changes to show 
how many of the item you now own and the current value of your hold- 
ings, constantly updated based on fluctuating prices. When you have 
enough cash on hand to cover the costs of drilling, as well as the losses 



that could be incurred by a dry well, the high-stakes wheeling and deal- 
ing can begin. 

Drilling is handled on the hi-res screen using paddles. A black rec- 
tangle moves across the screen, underground. You control the position 
of a drilling rig on the surface. When you push the button, a black line 
moves down from the drill. If it intersects the moving oil field, you get 
some income. While this may not be too realistic a simulation of the 
process of drilling for oil, it is welcome as an occasional change of pace 
from the market activity that takes up most of the game time. 

The game takes some time to grow on you. In the first few rounds 
of play you will lose for reasons you don't understand. Having totally 
realistic expectations of the way that commodities, oil wells, the Arabs, 
and the government behave in the real world won't be an immediate help 
here. Things go by their own rules in Oil Rig. For instance, inflation can 
make your prices drop (what?). Or an even better example: a refinery 
that cost you less than a thousand dollars (really) can blow up even be- 
fore you start to use it, costing you $15,000. Ha, ha; you lose. 

Taxation is based not on your income, but on your cash on hand. If 
you are holding more than a hundred thousand dollars, you are liable to 
be taxed right into bankruptcy without warning. Ha, ha; you lose again. 
Need a tax dodge? Sink a few hundred thousand into a refinery. Wait a 
minute, didn't a refinery cost only one thousand dollars last year? Sho' 
'nuff It's a jungle out there, Bobby. 

Oil Rig is surely not the most accurate attempt at a simulation we 
have seen, but as we said, it can grow on you. Learn to play by Bagley's 
rules instead of what common sense tells you is right, and you may have 
some fun. DD

The Linguist. By Robert C. Clardy and Charles J. Fleishman. This is not 
a program for everybody. If you're not working with a foreign lan- 
guage — learning, teaching, writing, translating, or whatever — then The 
Linguist probably will not help you. But if you are, and especially if you 
have to deal with a language that uses a special typeface such as Rus- 
sian, Hebrew, or Japanese, this might be just the program you need. 

The Linguist is a highly specialized file manager it creates, edits, and 
(if desired) drills you on foreign language dictionaries. 

So what's new and exciting about that? Anybody who's into com- 
puters has seen file management programs before. Right; but how many 
file managers have you seen that come with six different typefaces built 
in? This one not only manages files but also displays the words of each 
language in the correct character set for that language, both in upper and 
lower case. It also includes all the characters used by the International 
Phonetic Alphabet, the Trager-Smith phonemes, and other commonly 
used phonetic symbols. 

Typefaces and special characters required are provided for twenty 
different languages: all the familiar European ones, the others men- 
tioned earlier, and even Latin and Esperanto. 

Or, if you're into Tengwar, or Sanskrit, or High Martian, that's all 
right too: the system will accept additional typefaces designed by the user 
(though you will need Higher Text, another program from the same pub- 
lisher, to design them with). 

When you're working in a foreign typeface — for example, adding 
words to your Greek/ English file — the Apple's keyboard is automati- 
cally modified by the program into a "foreign language typewriter": for 
Greek, the A key prin^ the character Alpha, B prints Beta, and so on. 
("Prints" refers to a display on the screen, of course, not the printer; 
you'd need a dot-matrix printer with a special graphics driver to handle 
this output.) The manual provides several pages of charts showing the 
various keyboard layouts. 

The system offers three modes of operation, with the same group of 
activities in each mode. The translator mode matches a word or short 
phrase (up to fifteen characters) in one lai)guage with a word or short 
phrase in another; the definer mode matches a word in one language 
with a definition (a phrase up to forty characters long) in another; and 
the phrasebook mode matches a phrase (forty characters) in one lan- 
guage with the equivalent phrase in another. 

In each mode, you have the following options: you can sort the list of 
pairs alphabetically, in either language, and then scan the list; you can 



NOVEMBER 1982 



191 



"look up" a word or definition — input one half of a pair and get the 
other half (English to foreign or foreign to English); you can add to or 
edit the dictionary; or you can have the system drill you either on the en- 
tire dictionary or on a selected subset of it. 

In a drill, the system will display one half of a pair, randomly chosen 
from the specified list, and wait for you to supply the other half. You can 
get a hint — the first letter of the missing word — by typing a question 
mark. The system displays a running tally of your answers. 

Note: word lists and dictionaries are not provided with the system ex- 
cept for a few short demonstration lists. None of the above functions (ex- 
cept "add more words") will operate until you input a dictionary. And 
each mode requires its own list; you can't get a definition from a list of 
word pairs, for example. 

There is also a slight problem with the manual it is not as clear, or as 
easy to read, as one might wish. The necessary information is all there, 
but it is organized to explain what the system does instead of how to use 
the system. However, this will only trouble you in the beginning, if at all; 
once you're familiar with the system, it runs very smoothly. 

The bad news is that you will have to create all your own data files, 
like dictionaries and such. The good news is that here is a tool you can 
do it with, no matter what typeface you need to work in.

Magic Spells. By Leslie M. Grimm. Magic Spells is a debghtful chil- 
dren's program. It's from the same team that currently creates the Learn- 
ing Company games that are inspiring much excitement in the educa- 
tional world. The programming and design work is done by Leslie 
Grimm, but all the hi-res and lo-res graphics are done by the very 
talented Corinne Grimm, age ten. 

This is a fun educational program for children of elementary school 
age and above. Merlapple, the Wizard of Spells, welcomes you to the 
Kingdom of Magic Spells. Inside the castle are many chests of gold and 
jewels. Each chest can only be opened if you know the correct spell. 
These spells are anagrams, words that students must unscramble. There 
are eleven different lists, each twenty words long. If students give the cor- 
rect spell, they receive all the treasure in the chest; if they miss, then the 
lurking Spelling Demon takes a share. The more tries required to get the 
correct answer, the more the Demon takes. 

The game has a good self-help feature: every correct letter in the cor- 
rect place is acknowledged. So if the scrambled word is isucrc, and the 
first guess is scrius, the program wall show your answer as "??r?us." The 
question marks indicate which letters are still wrong. (Got the answer 
yet?) Delightful graphics and musical reinforcement make this a game 
that children come back to time after time. 

Magic Spells is not a program that a child will master and then be 
bored by. It's designed to grow with the child. There is a separate seg- 
ment of the program, called Spells Writer, that enables parents and 
teachers to program new word lists. Each list is twenty words long and 
can contain words up to fifteen letters long — so even high school stu- 
dents striving to increase their vocabulary can use the programs. 

Magic Spells would be appropriate in every family library and should 
be seriously considered for any school using Apples. RRA

Wiz-Mate Megaman. By Louis Simmons and Dick Hodgkins. 
Wizmaker Wizardry Character Editor. By Ron Richards. Wizardry is a 
huge game; it takes a long time to develop characters strong enough to 
take on to Knight of Diamonds, and even longer to build ones who'll sur- 
vive in the new environs. 

But building characters is 90 percent of the game in Wizardry. Few 
things in gaming are as gratifying as seeing your Wizardry characters 
gain levels with the attendant improvement in attributes and mastery of 
new spells. One of the activities that keeps Wizardry players glued to the 
chair for one more, and just one more, expedition into the maze is the 
realization that a character is within a successful expedition's booty of 
earning a new level. 

Conversely, it takes guts and confidence to change a carefully 
developed character's class from mage to samurai, from priest to bishop, 
from fighter to lord. Yet you know the character deserves the higher class 



with its greater long-range capacities. But making the change means 
casting your character back to level one and lowering his attributes to 
puny proportions. Only his hit points and knowledge of some spells are 
retained. But you do it, and you begin building him again. You know it 
was worthwhile when your former fighter begins to master spells, when 
your former mage adds priest spells to her repertoire, and when your new 
bishop can identify the amazing magical items Boltec would have 
charged hundreds of thousands of gold pieces to inspect. 

All this is bypassed with the Wizardry oriented utilities, or can be. 

Then what's the point of playing, you may ask. Well, each Wizardry 
scenario has a plot and puzzles that must be mastered to win the sce- 
nario. But playing Wizardry for those alone is to make a great, full game 
a mere fantasy game; it isn't even role-playing anymore, because the roles 
are divorced from the player — are invincible characters produced by 
megamachines. 

Appropriately, then, the first Wizardry oriented utility to hit the 
market is called Wiz-Mate Megaman. With it you can make a full 
roster's worth of supercharacters: all will be level 768, know most and 
sometimes all spells with maximum casting ability, have between seven 
hundred and twelve hundred hit points, and be equipped with such 
goodies as lords' garb, rods of flame, and healing rings (which make cur- 
ing spells obsolete). Visiting Adventurers' Inn with these monstrosities 
becomes a necessary bore to refresh spells. The number of experience 
points needed for anyone to rise another level is so enormous that the 
computer must delay several seconds to announce it; none requires less 
than hundreds of millions, most require billions. 

The Megamen are various and are the combinations chosen by the 
people at Wiz-Mate. There are good, neutral, and evil; all classes. There's 
even a neutral ninja. And they're named, but of course you can change 
that. That's all you can change. Nothing else you do with the characters 
makes a dent in their attributes or abilities. They're dead hulks, machines 
for mapping, weapons for killing monsters for the satisfaction of saying 
you got to the end. 

But if you got to the end using Megamen, that's all you did. You cer- 
tainly didn't win. 

Megaman has one excellent utility. It allows you to print out your 
roster and each of your characters with all attributes, possessions, and 
spells. 

Wizmaker is a different story. Wizmaker allows you to alter already 
made characters in any number of ways. You can make megacharacters 
with it if you choose; the one thing it won't give them that Megaman will 
is possessions. You must still earn those. 

But Wizmaker will also allow you to do as little as you hke. So you 
can restore the level that the lifestealers sucked away, for example. It's 
still cheating, but not quite as game-destructive. 

To those not of the cheating bent, Wizmaker can be a palatable 
utility. Wizardry itself allows you to back up your characters, but all must 
return to back-up status if one is to be restored. With Wizmaker, you can 
restore just the character who needs it. You can take characters to more 
than one scenario simultaneously — lending your youngster your main 
party's leader to help her get her band started, for example — without 
removing the character from your disk. 

And, if you're a person who keeps regenerating a character at the 
beginning until you randomly get seventeen or more points to distribute 
instead of the normal seven to ten, you can settle for seven and doctor 
the resulting character to reflect the extra ten points you otherwise would 
have spent five or ten minutes rolling for. (If you're like this reviewer, 
though, you'll keep rolling; this still feels like cheating.) 

Neither of these utilities' publishers has any connection with Sir-tech 
and the real Wizardry. The Sir-techians believe, as we do, that using in- 
stantly created superheroes to play causes much of the value of their 
games to be overlooked. 

Also, people out to make an independent profit on someone else's 
success are precariously balancing on a contradiction in terms. H(T

Lazer Maze. By James D. Spain. If you ever wake up one morning and 



192 



WUTAI 1^ 



NOVEMBER 1982 



find yourself about to fight for your life in an alien arena, then you 
will be glad you had this training. Lazer Maze is a very different game 
and one of the most intriguing ones to come from the prolific Avant- 
Garde stable. The game challenges your mental agility and quickness of 
thought, rather than the blinding reflexes that are required for playing 
most arcade games. 

The arena is filled with varying amounts of laser baffles, which reflect 
an incoming laser beam at right angles. Around the edge of the arena are 
numbers indicating position. You stand on one number and calculate the 
number of the point of exit for your laser beam as it ricochets around the 
arena. When you have determined the exit point for the beam, you enter 
this number. The computer then places your alien opponent on the exit 
number that you have indicated, and your laser gun is fired. If the beam 
does indeed exit where you have forecast, then the alien is destroyed and 
you are awarded points. The points earned are determined by the com- 
plexity of the path and the time it took you to enter the destination 
number. The complexity factor refers to the number of reflections within 
the maze, such as a four-bounce shot or a thirty-five bounce shot. For 
the more intricate shots, large bonuses are awarded. 

This is all well and good, but what happens when you miss the alien? 
Well, then the alien gets to lob a nuclear grenade over the maze at you. 
And the alien never misses! So it certainly pays to be accurate, even more 
than it does to figure the exit point quickly. There is also a large bonus 
given at the end of each round if you have had no misses. 

The rounds are divided into skill levels, starting with novice and 
working up to master level. The novice level has only twenty baffles in 
the arena, while the master level has seventy. Unfortunately, the game 
does not have a cumulative scoring system or a limited amount of men 
on your side. Basically, you are playing each round against a previous 
high score while trying to exceed it. This is not easy, as the mazes 
generated are random, so the highest possible score for each maze is 
quite different and not necessarily higher than any of the previous mazes. 
Once the player reaches the master level, he must keep playing seventy 
mirror mazes one after another in the hope that one will come along that 



will allow higher scoring combinations. RRA

Math Strategy and Spelling Strategy. By Robert B. Dilts. These two 
unusual educational programs, developed by Behavioral Engineering 
(Scotts Valley, CA), are built on principles that have been discovered in 
the field of neurolinguistic programming. Studies have correlated sen- 
sory representation and the way people organize their experiences; these 
"sensory cuing mechanisms" relate eye movement to learning and re- 
membering. The theory underlying this discovery asserts that you re- 
member best when you can picture what you're trying to recall in your 
"mind's eye." This is purported to be a spot up and to the right or left of 
normal forward eyesight. 

In developing this training, computers are placed in front of students 
with the monitors placed in raised positions either to the left for right- 
handed students or to the right for left-handed students. Students are 
asked to look up at the monitor and visualize the questions, then dthw to 
repeat back the problem, to solve the problem, or to enter the problem 
backward, all while not looking at the original problem. To aid stu- 
dents, eyes on the screen are looking up in the direction the students need 
to focus. Also, students can select one of eight colors and all the correct 
answers will be shown in that color, reinforcing the technique. Two levels 
of expertise are provided, and additional lessons can be created by the 
parent or teacher. 

There appears to be disagreement among educators about the value 
of this technique. Some school systems might feel that learning this tech- 
nique would interfere with the traditional learning habits in which the 
children are presently being instructed. Parents would be well-advised to 
check with their children's teachers before purchasing either of these 
highly innovative programs. RRA

tern mine-laying. Your ship is inside a force field and is being at- 
tacked by beasts from another dimension. Only six of these creatures can 
attack per level. Your job is to eliminate them before they touch your 
ship, or before your ship comes in contact with the force field. You 
cannot shoot at these beasts; all you can do is lay down energy probes 
similar to space mines and lure the beasts into contact with the probe, 
thus destroying them. Unfortunately, sixteen is the maximum number of 
probes allowed at one time within the force field. Any contact with your 
own probe will destroy you also, so it can get rather crowded within that 
force field very quickly, with maneuvering space at a premium. 

There are five levels to overcome. On the first level, the instant the six 
beasts are neutralized, the whole group is regenerated, and each beast has 
six lives. On levels two and three, each beast resurrects instantly. The 
fourth and fifth levels introduce killer beasts who dive straight at your 
ship like kamikazes. These never completely die, but are reborn time 
after time until they finally overwhelm your ship. Frazzle! can be played 
by one person or two, competing to see who is the better sower of mines 
against the hordes of beasts. The game is unlike the regular arcades and a 
good choice for young players. RRA

Death Race '82. By Don Fudge. Once again, Don Fudge (compiler of 
Hi-Res Secrets and author of the unique Zero Gravity Pinbalt) has come 
up with a game that knocks at the frontier of arcade design and doesn't 
quite get in. Combining the twisting-turning style of Monte Carlo Grand 
Prix racing with the grim reaper shadow of Deathrace 2000, this game is 
intended to keep you on the edge of your seat. 

You're the driver of a turbo car trying to escape at high speed 
through ten convoluted mazes, hotly pursued by robot cars firing lasers. 
Your only weapons are bazooka rockets, portable oil slicks, and, if you 
have superhuman driving skills, the ability to cause the robot cars to 
crash. It is the driving skill that enables you to survive the later mazes. 
The rockets, though, are especially useful for blasting shortcuts through 
the walls of the mazes. Each time you crash you lose points, and, if the 
enemy gets you, you must start all over. 

If you pursue the game long enough to master its "unique paddle 
control," you can increase the speed of the game for the next try. The ten 
possible speed settings raise the difficulty quotient. RRA

Early Games for Young Children. By John Paulson. There is a tremen- 
dous shortage of good preschool computer programs, so any new one is 
welcome. Early Games for Young Children is not a flashy program, it 
does impart basic training in numbers and letters in a competent man- 
ner. Even the menu is a picture menu, so no reading skills are needed. 
The program is geared for kids two years old to seven years old. 

There are nine programs, each providing training in a different area. 
One of the nicest features of this program is that it starts out teaching 
children the Apple keyboard. The numbers and letters are shown full 
screen in color. 

Then children are asked to count multicolored blocks. Mastering 
that, they move on to easy addition and subtraction, using the same 
blocks. The drills are slow paced, and children like to do them over and 
over again. For the older group, alphabet drills ask children to enter the 
letter after the one shown on the screen. A shape comparison program 
trains perception of similarities and differences. 

Children love to print their names. The Name program requires an 
adult to enter a child's name. Then the child is asked to spell their name 
in small letters on the screen. When the youngster gets it right, the com- 
puter prints the name in multicolored screen-high letters. The squeals of 
delight when children see this are worth the price of the program. 

Included also is a neat little drawing program that enables children to 
draw on screen with very simple commands. Upper keys draw upward, 
lower keys draw downward, corner keys draw diagonally, and the space 
bar changes color. That is all they need to know. Any picture they make 
can be saved to disk for later retrieval, perhaps to show parents when 
they get home. RKA

DIETICIAN™ 

THE BEST USE OF THE MICROCOMPUTER 
IN PERSONAL CARE 

No single food can provide you all the nutrients you need. That is why it 
is important to eat a balanced meal. It is in this effort to achieve balance that 
most people get confused and frustrated. Trying to add up calories of foods, 
while keeping an eye on the carbohydrates, fats, and other components can get 
out of hand very quickly. This is the type of work that the computers perform 
admirably. Now with the help of our program, you can use your microcomputer 
to select foods that best fit your needs. 

• Program comes complete with the composition of 700 foods. Italso 
lets you add foods of your own choice to expand the data base. 

• Allows you to make up a diet menu with specified content of 
calories, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, cholesterol, and sodium. 

• You examine the composition of each food instantaneously before 
deciding to include it in your diet 

• A special recipe- entering module and plenty of raw ingredients 
allow you to make up almost any kind of meal. How is that for 
adding variety to your dieting? Make up a different menu for each 
day of the month. 

• The diet menus can be printed out in a most comprehensive format, 
with each item's weight and composition listed individually. 

• Costs less than the price of a dinner for two. Only 859.95 plus 32.00 
for postage and handling. 

WE FEEL THAT NO OTHER SOURCE CAN GIVE THE TYPE OF 
INFORMATION THAT THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES YOU IN THE PRI- 
VACY OF YOUR HOME, AT YOUR OWN LEISURE, WITHOUT RUSH, 
AND WITHOUT A CHARGE EACH TIME YOU WISH TO USE IT. 

System requirements: APPLE II Hus or APPLE II with Applesoft in

Apple II is a trademark of Apple Computer Inc. 



□ Syntauri (Palo Alto, CA) has announced 
completion of a private placement financing led 
by Steve Wozniak, cofounder of Apple Com- 
puter and independent investor. Elected to Syn- 
tauri's board of directors: Nicholas Fortis, 
previously vice president of finance for Nestar 
Systems; Ellen V. B. Lapham, founder and 
president of Syntauri Corporation; Philip 
Roybal, manager of communications pro- 
grams for Apple Computer; and Thomas A. 
Skornia, recently vice president and general 
counsel for Advanced Micro Devices and 
cofounder of Third Wave Investors, a venture 
capital investment fund. 

□ Anthony P. Morris, president of Morris 
Decision Systems (New York, NY), the 
national account support dealer for Apple 
Computer, has named three new vice presi- 
dents to the company. Roger A. Williams, vice 
president of sales and marketing; Kevin S. 
Clougherty, vice president of research and tech- 
nology; and Robert M. Bowen II, vice presi- 
dent of finance and administration. 

□ Advanced Logic Systems (Sunnyvale, CA) 
has appointed Tech Plus (Boston, MA) its ex- 
clusive sales representative in the United States. 
Tech Plus will handle the ALS Synergizer 
product line for adding CP/M to the Apple II. 
"This will complete the support of our existing 
dealer or distributor relationships," comments 
Dick Ribas, vice president of sales for ALS. 

□ Artsci/Softape has moved. The software 
company is now located at 5547 Satsuma Ave- 
nue, North Hollywood, CA 91601. 

□ To accommodate rapid growth experienced 
during the past year, SofTech Microsystems, 
marketer of the UCSD p-System, has relo- 
cated to a 33,000-square-foot facility in the com- 
munity of Rancho Bernardo, California, in the 
northern part of San Diego. The new quarters 
are located at 16885 West Bernardo Drive, San 
Diego, CA 92127. The new phone number is 
(619) 451-1230. 

□ Sierra On-Line (Coarsegold, CA), for- 
merly On-Line Systems, is budgeting nearly one 
million dollars in the coming year for various 
dealer support projects. The company has 
leased CompuVision, a computer/video "robot 
sales device," and is featuring actor Richard 
Kiel in a series of "infomercials" in one hun- 
dred stores. A WATS line and dealer support 
newsletter are available, and the marketing de- 
partment is creating several other dealer sup- 
port programs involving posters, point of pur- 
chase displays, and an ongoing publicity 
program. 

□ Dan Illowsky, best known as the author of 
the popular Snack Attack from DataMost 



(Northridge, CA), has formed his own compa- 
ny, Funtastic, in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania. At 
first, Funtastic will publish only Illowsky's new 
games; late next year. Snack Attack and 
County Fair will also become available through 
the new company. Meanwhile, DataMost has 
withdrawn the apparently prematurely released 
Illowsky game. Space Kadet, from the market. 
The future of Tom Corbett is as yet unknown. 




Actor Richard "Jaws" Kiel and director Roberta 

"Hot Tub" Williams take a break during the 
shooting of a video "infomercial" for Sierra On- 
Line. 



□ Dr. Robert Harp, formerly chairman of the 
board of Vector Graphic, has announced the 
executive team and corporate strategy of Co- 
rona Data Systems (Westlake Village, CA), the 
firm he established in the summer of 1981 and 
has managed as board chairman since his resig- 
nation from Vector last April. Dan Carter, for- 
merly executive vice president of Televideo 
Inc.'s computer systems division and general 



manager of the microcomputer systems divi- 
sion at Commodore Business Machines, has 
been named president of Corona. George Mc- 
Murtry, Corona's vice president of sales, was 
previously nadonal sales manager for micro- 
products at Pertec Computer Corporation. 
Robert Kramarz will continue as marketing 
vice president for the firm. He was Vector's 
manager of market development and director of 
corporate communications. A vice president of 
finance and operations has also been selected, 
according to Dr. Harp, but his name has not 
been released. 

In its first overseas distribufion contract, 
Corona has signed with Management/Per- 
sonal Computers (London, England) to mar- 
ket Corona's line of hard disk subsystems in 
Great Britain. The agreement reportedly does 
not limit Corona's right to sell products in 
British retail stores such as Computerland. 
Corona's announced two-step distribution 
policy for worldwide sale and support of its sub- 
systems will make end-user sales the responsi- 
bility of Independent Sales Organizations — re- 
tail dealers, OEMs, and system houses — and 
stocking master distributors will be responsible 
for supplying the ISOs. Corona will then sup- 
ply and support the distributors. Three new 
North American offices will be responsible for 
training distributors in selling to dealers and for 
providing back-up support to the distributors. 

Corona expects to ship a thousand units per 
month by year end. Current plans call for shift- 
ing production facilides from Chatsworth, Cali- 
fornia, to corporate headquarters in Westlake 
Village, California. 

□ Taurus Software (San Francisco, CA) has 
been formed to provide user-friendly, nontech- 
nical applications software and control pro- 
grams for CP/M-based systems. Their initial 
product, CP+, was introduced at the West 
Coast Computer Faire in March. Taurus in- 
corporated in February, obtaining venture capi- 
tal from Merrill, Pickard, Anderson & Eyre, 
Bank of America's high technology specialists 
for managing venture capital investments. 

□ Entech, the computer skills center (Com- 
mack, NY), has opened to provide hands-on 
training in microcomputers and word process- 
ing equipment to businesses, self-employed profes- 
sionals, and individuals. Seminars range from 
the essentials of operation — assuming no prior 
knowledge — to the advanced operation of the 
most sophisticated hardware and software 
available. Custom training programs can be ar- 
ranged off-site. Philip Ackerman, president, co- 
founded Databit and served as vice president 
of engineering. Brochures, seminar schedules,

□ Computer Learning and Software Services 

(Marquette, MI) is a combination educational 
and retail service offering a variety of computer 
education classes for business professionals, ed- 
ucators, home users, and children. In addition, 
C.L.A.S.S. provides consultation and support 
services, consumer education classes, and soft- 
ware/hardware sales. C.L.A.S.S. welcomes in- 
quiries from dealers who wish to sponsor semi- 
nars in their areas. Call (906) 225-0433. 

□ The College of Education at the Universi- 
ty of South Alabama (Mobile, AL), in cooper- 
ation with the School of Continuing Educa- 
tion, will sponsor a two-day workshop on "Mi- 
crocomputers in Education" in Biloxi, Missis- 
sippi, on November 11 and 12, 1982. For de- 
tails and registration forms, contact Judy 
Campbell, University of South Alabama, Mo- 
bile, AL 36688; telephone (205) 690-6528. 

□ Information Systems and Supplies is the 
latest division of Leading Edge Products (Can- 
ton, MA). The division was formed, according 
to chairman Michael Shane, "as a result of our 
recognition of the special needs of the National 
Office Products Association and the concept 
that these markets have outstanding growth po- 
tential for microcomputer products and serv- 
ices. We intend to work very closely with the 
members of these groups to provide them with 
the kind of products and information that will 
help them to greater sales and better service for 
their customers." Louis Sebok, former head of 
Wang's office supplies division, has been ap- 
pointed general manager of the NOPA/ 
NOMDA divison. 

□ One hundred software packages, spanning 
virtually every popular operating system, are 
being introduced by Single Source Solutions, a 
new software company in Concord, California. 
President Michael L. Dean says the company 
plans to market its programs — currently in- 
cluding utilities, languages, business and word 
processing applications, educational tools, and 
games — through computer dealers and OEMs, 
developing a strong dealer /OEM network to al- 
low lower prices for the end user. 

□ Business and Professional Software (Cam- 
bridge, MA), developer of Apple Business 
Graphics, has contracted with ten independent 
sales organizations representing Apple Com- 
puter and peripheral manufacturers to market 
their Screen Director and PIK software pack- 
ages. The move marks BPS's first step toward 
developing a national sales network. "These ten 
rep contracts will significantly bolster our deal- 
er network, which already comprises more than 
three hundred companies nationally," says sales 
manager Jeffrey Turner. "Our plans call for us 
to have the entire country covered with rep ter- 
ritories and to double the number of our deal- 
ers this fall. In addition, we have contracted dis- 
tributors in Europe, Asia, Australia, and South 
America." 

□ Shugart Associates (Sunnyvale, CA) has 
decentralized the majority of its operations and 
formed five major divisions. The new divisions 



and their respective vice president/general man- 
agers are rigid disk drive division, Tom Gard- 
ner; floppy disk drive division, Carl Neun; Sun- 
nyvale division, Paul Penney; marketing and 
sales division, George Sollman; and Optimem 
division, Peter Lloyd. Shugart's central corpo- 
rate staff now consists of four groups, headed 
by their respective vice presidents: quality, Tom 
Gilmer; finance and planning. Bob Bledsoe; 
personnel and administration, Chris Carlton; 
and technology, Mike Feldstein. The company 
has reduced its thirty-five hundred member 
work force by approximately one hundred 
twenty-five indirect (salaried) employees. Ac- 
cording to president James Campbell, the re- 
duction in indirect labor eliminates job duplica- 
tion and streamlines the division and central 
corporate staffs. 

□ Vem Raburn, former vice president of con- 
sumer products with Microsoft (Bellevue, WA), 
is now executive vice president and general 
manager of Lotus Development Corporation 

(Cambridge, MA). He will oversee marketing 
and operations, and the launching of Lotus's 
latest product, 1-2-3. Raburn states that he wel- 
comes "the opportunity to work on a key prod- 
uct to fill an important need for integrated pro- 
ductivity tools." 

□ Software Distributors (Culver City, CA) 
has appointed Jack Hennessy sales manager re- 
sponsible for the company's domestic and in- 
ternational sales. His additional responsibilities 
will include marketing liaison, customer serv- 
ice, and development of new sales markets. 

□ Queue (Fairfield, CT), the publisher of the 
Microcomputers in Education newsletter, has 
opened its first Computer Learning Center at 161 
Kings Highway, Fairfield, CT 06430. The cen- 
ter offers computer-assisted tutorials on a wide 
variety of academic subjects, using the Apple II 
and Apple III, among others. They also offer 
specialized programs on SAT and GRE prepa- 
ration, computer literacy and programming, 
and computer applications in business. Queue is 
planning to open additional learning centers 
and is seeking people, particularly teachers, in- 
terested in owning or operating a Computer 
Learning Center in other areas. 

□ Following the opening of new production 
and administration facilities at 7 Hangar Way in 
Watsonville, California, Ultra Magnetics, a 
flexible disk manufacturing company, has ap- 
pointed Robert Glass director of manufactur- 
ing and William Swain vice president of fi- 
nance and administration. Glass, former head 
of the flexible disk media division at Memorex, 
will be responsible for all manufacturing opera- 
tions including production, manufacturing engi- 
neering, materials scheduling, and facilities 
planning and maintenance. Swain has been pro- 
moted from the position of vice president, con- 
troller, for Frank Scott Enterprises, the Aptos, 
California, venture capital firm backing the 
company. 

□ George Sass, president of Apple Advertising 

of Annapolis, Maryland, and Jane Sass, presi- 
dent of Sassafras Studios, have announced the 
merger of their two companies. The corporate 



structure of Apple Advertising remains the 
same, except that it will now trade as Sassafras. 
States George Sass, "Our companies have been 
working closely during the past year, and there 
will be several advantages to working under one 
corporate structure." Also, a survey indicated a 
lot of positive awareness for the new name. And 
there was one other thing, regarding the ad 
agency's original moniker. "We chose the name 
five years ago in connection with the first ad on 
earth before Apple Computer became a house- 
hold word," says George Sass. "It's time to 
change our name and end the confusion." 
□ The Denver Software Company (Aurora, 
CO) is spending one million dollars in the initi- 
ation of a national distribution network of six- 
ty manufacturers' representatives for its prod- 
ucts, part of a mass merchandising effort in- 
cluding on-site product demonstrations, dis- 
play racks for software and literature, national 
advertising, product comparisons, and video- 
tape presentations. DSC will conduct quarterly 
training programs for reps and has created a 
product support department with a hot line 
number to provide additional support to deal- 
ers and end users. Purchasers of DSC's new 
"password registration system" application pro- 
grams must call the hot line number and ask for 
the individual package code password to un- 
lock the product for use. The product support 
department uses the system to conduct market 
research and control inventory. 




Blue Lakes Software Is now reintroducing 
the most powerful statistics package on 
the Apple II & III. The manual and programs

Tools of the Craft, Part 17 

Plymouth Rock and Dinner Rolls. You 

should be reading these words sometime in 
early November, before any of us has had a 
chance to sit down to a sumptuous Thanksgiv- 
ing feast. It's unlikely that we'll be worth much 
of anything afterward, and, besides, you'll prob- 
ably prefer to busy yourself with holiday 
frolicking, rather than sitting, hermitlike, at a 
computer console. However, to keep the well- 
known effects of the impending holiday season 
from impeding our progress along the Pascal 
Path, we'd better bite off a big chunk of the ca- 
ble TV data-manipulation program now, while 
we still enjoy the clarity of thought that comes 
from having comfortably empty stomachs. 

Here is the program Cable, which was left 
unfinished (but operational) at the conclusion

NOVEMBER 1982 

This month, we'll develop the stub proce- 
dure NewTown and prepare ourselves for the 
"big jobs" of writing DisplayTown and 
ChangeTown next month. With any luck, the 
groundwork we do now will help us to dispose 
of the last two procedures without too much 
difficulty. The less effort we need to expend to 
finish the program over the year-end holiday, 
the better! 

NewTown. If we had to use "plain Enghsh" 
in expressing the "emptying" of a town relative 
to the requirements of our model, we might de- 
scribe it this way: "For each streiet in the Town 
T, mark every house on it as containing no sub- 
scribers." Use of the word for in the description 
suggests that we might profitably employ a 
FOR loop in turning the computer's attention 
from one street to the next. We need only have 
the FOR loop control variable — which we'll call 
StreetNow — step through all the values of type 
StreetName. Within the loop body, we may 
then use StreetNow as the first index to T. You 
can see that if we do so each successive itera- 
tion of the loop selects a new street automati- 
cally. 

The process of selecting successive Houses 
on a Street is not different in concept from that 
of selecting successive Streets within a Town. 
Thus, we may nest a second FOR loop within 
the body of the StreetNow loop and use it to 
empty the houses on the street indicated by 
StreetNow. We'll give this "inner" loop a con- 
trol variable, HouseNow, which, because it can 
assume integer values in the HouseN umber 



SOMALIA 




subrange, is therefore suitable as the second in- 
dex to T. We may now replace the stub for 
NewTown with a very concise and elegant Pas- 
cal translation of the rough description present- 
ed earlier. 

VAR 
StreetNow 
:StreetName; 
HouseNow 
:HouseNumber; 
BEGIN (* NewTown *) 
FOR StreetNow := Redwood TO Drittwood 
DO 

For HouseNow := 1 TO MaxHNum DO 
T[StreetNow][HouseNow] : = 
NoSubscriber; 
END (* NewTown*); 

This method of emptying a town is perfect- 
ly satisfactory from a procedural standpoint. It 
does exactly what we want, and its similarity to 
our rough description makes it very readable. 
However, try compiling and executing a ver- 
sion of Cable that uses this code for NewTown. 
From the time you see Cable'!, "header" to 
the time that the program's prompt line ap- 
pears on your video screen, several seconds — 
perhaps several uncomfortable seconds — 
elapse, in which you have time to wonder if the 
program is working at all. NewTown is the cul- 
prit, requiring nearly eight seconds to empty an 
entire Town. Eight seconds may not sound like 
a great deal of time, but studies have shown that 
even this brief interval can seem like an eternity 
to someone who is sitting (helplessly) at a com- 
puter terminal, waiting for a response. If you 



199 

compiled and executed the Cable skeleton, us- 
ing NewTown as presented earlier, and then 
proceeded to fidget during the "dead air" that 
characterizes NewTown's operation, you may 
be wondering if this pause can possibly be 
shortened. 

The execution of any Pascal statement re- 
quires some small amount of time, although 
any single statement generally executes in much 
less time than you can perceive. Complicated 
programs often seem to take a while to do their 
jobs, because hundreds and thousands of state- 
ments must be executed before you see any re- 
sults. For instance, any call to NewTown re- 
sults in the execution of at least 3,996 state- 
ments — one assignment statement for every ele- 
ment in the Town T. This is a direct conse- 
quence of NewTown's design. We can change 
the design slightly and achieve substantial in- 
creases in NewTown's speed by exploiting two 
facts: 

1. Pascal permits entire arrays to be as- 
signed with only one statement. 

2. "Mass assignments" are faster than 
equivalent assignments to individual elements. 

The first fact reminds us that it is possible to 
empty an entire Street of 999 Houses at once, 
while the second exhorts us to do so whenever 
possible. 

Let's take a moment to discuss the rather re- 
markable second claim. Remember that the 
Pascal compiler produces P-code, which is in 
turn interpreted by a 6502 machine-language 
program, the Apple Pascal P-machine. Usually,

NOVEMBER 1982 



the compiler translates a single statement into 
several different P-codes. About the same num- 
ber of P-codes are produced for any assign- 
ment statement, whether it deals with individ- 
ual variables, array elements, or entire struc- 
tures, so let's simplify the discussion by suppos- 
ing that one assignment translates into one P- 
code. In other words, in our hypothetical ex- 
ample, one P-code may symbolize the transfer 
of any amount of information from one loca- 
tion in memory to another. 

For every P-code, the P-machine has to take 
four separate steps: fetch the code, recognize it, 
identify (and often fetch) the data on which it is 
to operate, and perform the operation. To sim- 
plify the discussion, let's say that each of the 
first three steps requires one unit of time to 
complete, and that the fourth can last for one or 
more units, depending on the complexity of the 
operation being performed. The fourth step in 
transferring a single Boolean value from one 
variable to another might take just one time 
unit, while transfer of a hundred-element array 
might require 100 units. Thus, the P-code cor- 
responding to the assignment of a single value 
executes in a total of four time units, while that 
corresponding to the assignment of an entire ar- 
ray requires 103 units. 

Given these assumptions (which model the 
P-machine's behavior well enough for this dis- 
cussion), let's compare the speed of a FOR loop 
containing a "single-value" assignment state- 
ment as its body against one "mass assign- 
ment" statement in copying the contents of one 
100-element array into another. Since the FOR 



loop's body consumes four time units every time 
it is executed and must be executed one hun- 
dred times, it's easy to see that the FOR loop 
cannot finish in less than four hundred time 
units. In reality, the loop probably requires at 
least twelve hundred units, since some extra P- 
codes must be executed in order to increment 
and test the value of the loop control variable 
prior to each execution of the body. As we've 
seen, the mass assignment P-code needs only 
103 time units — between one-half and one- 
fourth of the FOR loop's time — to do the same 
job. This substantial improvement in perform- 
ance stems mainly from the fact that the mass 
assignment P-code spends more time doing use- 
ful work and less time dealing with "bookkeep- 
ing overhead" than one hundred (to three hun- 
dred) separate P-codes. 

We oversimplified in the explanation given 
earlier so that we could concentrate on acquir- 
ing an intuition for the reasons why whole-ar- 
ray assignment is inherently faster than ele- 
ment-by-element assignment. In doing so, we 
overlooked many aspects of the P-machine ar- 
chitecture and the Pascal system environment 
that affect execution speed. So, even though we 
can be reasonably sure that we can cut New- 
Town's execution time by clearing entire Streets 
at once (thus reducing the total number of P- 
codes executed) whenever possible, we should 
actually try out the new technique to get a feel 
for the degree of performance improvement it 
promotes in the real world. 

The following body for NewTown uses 
mass assignment as often as possible. First, it

empties Redwood Street, House by House. 
Then, it uses Redwood as a template to clear all 
subsequent Streets through mass assignment. 
This version of NewTown's body should re- 
place the one presented earlier; note that the 
declarations for StreetNow and HouseNow re- 
main necessary. 

BEGIN (* NewTown— fast version *) 
FOR HouseNow := 1 TO MaxHNum DO 
T[Redwood][HouseNow] := NoSubscriber; 
FOR StreetNow := Succ(Redwood) TO 

Driftwood DO 
T[StreetNow] := T[Redwood]; 
END (* NewTown *); 

Granted, this latest NewTown doesn't cor- 
respond as well as its predecessor did to our ini- 
tial description of the initialization process. On 
the other hand, while remaining perfectly read- 
able and understandable, it reduces the number 
of distinct assignment statements executed, 
from 3,996 to 1,002, and cuts execution time to 
just over two seconds — only about 30 percent of 
the time needed by the first routine to do the 
same job. 

Of course, you shouldn't worry overmuch 
about optimizing your code for speed or size as 
we've done here. The more important thing is to 
concentrate on getting the method right, so that 
your code works and is readable. Good pro- 
grammers usually defer optimization until the 
entire program operates correctly. However, 
initialization code rarely involves critical meth- 
odology. More often, it consists of nothing 
more than dozens — sometimes hundreds — of 
assignment statements. Intelligent restructuring 
of assignments can often result in big savings of 
both execution time and RAM memory space, 
with little or no effect on program clarity. 
Therefore, such economies are often included 
by concerned programmers right from the very 
start, especially when they are writing initializa- 
tion code. In particular, a good initialization 
strategy is to use mass assignment whenever the 
initialization code involved will be called regu- 
larly or at times when human beings are wait- 
ing to see results. 

Prelude to DisplayTown and Change- 
Town. The vague specification for Display- 
Town states that it permits us to display an en- 
tire town or just part of one. Offhand, our in- 
tuition tells us that display, like initialization, 
can be driven by simple loops. The real chal- 
lenge here is to find a mechanism that lets the 
user specify the entire Town or a subset of it 
with equal ease. 

It seems reasonable to identify a Home by 
its address, consisting of a HouseNumber and 
StreetName. Given a mechanism for collecting 
an address from the user, we can acquire two 
addresses, then display all Homes from the first 
address to the second. ChangeTown also re- 
quires the collection of at least one address from 
the user, so this same mechanism, designed cor- 
rectly, can be employed by both routines. Simi- 
larly, some means for displaying the address 
and contents of a Home must be created, and, 
while it will certainly be of use when we write 
DisplayTown, it may also prove handy for 
ChangeTown. 



NOVEMBER 1982

Clearly, our "address collection and display 
mechanism" is simply another variation of data 
conversion, this time between the character rep- 
resentation of an address and its internal form 
(as a HouseN umber and StreetName). Let's fol- 
low common sense and agree that the character 
representation of a Home address is an integer 
in the range of 1 to 999, followed by one or 
more blanks and then the name of a Street (for 
example. Redwood, Driftwood, and so on). 
How do we deal with the character representa- 
tions of an address? 

Prior to Cable, we have written programs 
that interact with the human user without re- 
quiring the entry of words, phrases, or names. 
Single-character yes or no answers and the oc- 
casional number or two are all that our pro- 
grams have ever needed to acquire from the 
outside world. Of course, we have been able to 
send the user wordy prompts, and even long 
messages, by encoding them as String con- 
stants within our programs. 

We already know how to acquire a num- 
ber from the user; either we can take advantage 
of the facilities that are built into Read and 
ReadLn, or we can use our own Integerlnput 
routine. But how may we receive a sequence of 
characters, and where may this kind of input 
data be stored while our program examines it? 
It should be obvious that we can use arrays to 
solve our problem. For instance, we could de- 
clare a variable. Answer, to be an "ARRAY 
[1..40] OF Char." It would be a relatively simple 
matter to write two procedures, one that would 



accept input characters into this structure from 
the keyboard and another to display the char- 
acters held by Answer on the screen. However, 
Apple Pascal already includes a predeclared 
data type, named String, for which these and 
many more operations are provided. 

Strings. Since we have already been using 
String constants and literals for many months 
now, we won't spend any time reviewing them. 
Instead, we'll dive right into the thick of things, 
covering String variables and the various pre- 
declared routines that Apple Pascal provides for 
String manipulation. 

String Variables. A String variable (from 
now on, just called "String") is a container, like 
any other variable. The job of any String is to 
hold a (possibly empty) sequence of characters. 
Strings are declared, along with all other vari- 
ables, in a VAR section. 

There are two parts to the type descriptor of 
a String variable. One is the identifier "String," 
and the other is a bracketed Integer constant 
that determines the maximum length — the 
physical length — of the String in question. For 
example, "String[l]" indicates a String that can 
contain only one character, while "String[40]" 
defines a String that can hold up to forty char- 
acters in a row. The physical length specifica- 
tion is optional; the lone identifier "String" is 
equivalent to "String [80]." The smallest per- 
missible physical length is 1; the largest is 255. 

For any Integer constant PLen, valued from 1 
to 255, "String[PLen]" is equivalent to writing 
"PACKED ARRAY[0 .. PLen] OF Char." (Al- 



though included for reasons of accuracy, the 
keyword PACKED is irrelevant to this discus- 
sion and should be ignored here; its meaning 
will be explained in a future column.) A String, 
however, is no ordinary Char array. Consider 
the String variable S, declared as "S: String." 
Under normal circumstances, S[0] is not sub- 
ject to direct access by your program. If you as- 
sign a String constant to S, Pascal will put the 
characters into the variable starting at S[l]. Any 
attempt by your program to use S[0] causes a 
"Value Range Error" to occur at run time. In 
fact, in writing your program, you should treat 
S as if it were declared with the typ)e descriptor 
"Array [1 ..80] OF Char." In other words, you 
should forget S[0] entirely. 

The Pascal system doesn't forget S[0], 
though. It uses that slot to keep track of the 
String's dynamic Imgth. For example, after the 
assignment "S := 'Hello' " the String S logically 
contains a tive-character value. Appropriately 
enough, Ord(S[0]) becomes 5, indicating that 
only the first five slots in S contain meaningful 
characters and that all other character posi- 
tions should be considered unoccupied. In fact, 
if your program tries to access a String array 
element using an index value larger than the 
current dynamic length of S, a "Value Range 
Error" will occur. Rather than try to use S[0], 
you should employ (and, unless you know ar- 
cane tricks, you must employ) the predeclared 
function Length(S) in order to determine the dy- 
namic (logical) length of S, where S is a vari- 
able or constant of any String type. Note that

"Length(S)" is conceptually equivalent to 
"Ord(S[0])." However, by making the length of 
a string available only through a function, the 
designers of Apple Pascal tried to help make 
your programs more readable and also to re- 
move the possibility that a program might acci- 
dentally change the value of a String's length 
count, perhaps rendering the String value in- 
valid. 

To summarize, a String variable's dynamic 
length (as reported by the Length function) can 
change, depending on the String values as- 
signed to it. The variable's physical length, how- 
ever, is fixed, limiting the maximum number of 
characters that a String can hold. 

Apple Pascal String Facilities. Besides 
Length, there are several other predeclared func- 
tions and procedures that manipulate String 
values. The function Concat takes one or more 
arguments, all of which must be valid String 
values. It produces a String value that is the 
concatenation of all the arguments. To illus- 
trate, the following Boolean expression is True: 

(Concat('Abra', 'cadabra') = 'Abracadabra') 

The Pos function takes exactly two String 
arguments, a Pattern and a Source, in that or- 
der, and produces an Integer result, which is 
zero if the Pattern does not appear in the Source 
and greater than zero otherwise. If the function 
value is nonzero, it indicates the character posi- 
tion in Source at which the leftmost occurrence 
of Pattern begins. Note that Pos does not treat 
capital letters as equivalent to their lower-case 



counterparts. "Pos('in', 'winching')" returns the 
value 2, while "Pos('IN', 'winch')" and 
"Pos('123', '456')" both return 0. 

The useful function Copy accepts three 
arguments: a String value, Source; and two In- 
teger expressions, Position and Count. Copy re- 
turns a String value that is the substring, which 
begins at the specified Position in Source and in- 
cludes the number of characters specified by 
Count. For instance, Copy('12345',3,l) yields 
the result 3, and Copy('12345',3,2) gives 34. 
Copy returns the empty String if Source is 
empty, if Position is less than 1 or greater than 
Length(Source), if Count is less than 1, or if 
(Positions- Count- 1 ) is greater than 
Length(Source). To illustrate, Copy('ABC',0,3), 
Copy('ABC',l,4), and Copy('ABC',2,0) all re- 
turn the empty (null) String. You can prove this 
for yourself by experimenting with the follow- 
ing program, which asks for Source, Position, 
and Count and displays the value and Length of 
Copy(Source, Position, Count): 

PROGRAM 
TestCopy; 

(* Exercise Apple Pascal's Copy function *) 
CONST 

Empty= "; 
VAR 

Source, . 
CopyVal 
:String; 

Position, 'V 
Count 
: Integer; 
BEGIN (* TestCopy*) 



REPEAT 
Write(Output, 'Source: '); 

ReadLn(lnput, Source); 
Write(Output, 'Position; '); 

ReadLn(lnput, Position); 
Write(Output, 'Count: '); 

ReadLn(lnput, Count); 
CopyVal := Copy(SourGe, Position, Count); 
Write(Output, 'Copy(Source, Position, 

Count) = "'); 
Write(Output, CopyVal, "' Length = '); 
Write(Output, Length(CopyVal)); 
WriteLn(Output); 
WriteLn(Output); 
UNTIL (Source = Empty); 
END (* TestCopy *). 

In using this program, make sure you enter 
a null Source as your last experiment, since that 
will signal the end of the REPEAT loop and 
also the end of the program. Try verifying the 
examples given above and feel free to invent 
your own. Don't be afraid to use negative num- 
bers for either Position or Count; Copy deals 
sensibly with them. 

Three procedures, Str, Insert, and Delete, 
round out Apple Pascal's repertoire of String- 
manipulation facilities. Str takes two argu- 
ments — an Integer expression and the name of 
a String variable — and sets the value of the vari- 
able to the character representation of the ex- 
pression value. Assuming S is a String variable, 
Str(3, S) would leave the String 3 in S, while 
Str(2-l-3M-l-7, S) would put 21 in S. 

Insert requires three arguments — a String 
expression, the name of a String variable, and 
an Integer expression. The String expression is 
inserted into the String variable just prior to the 
character position specified by the Integer ex- 
pression. For instance, let's suppose that String 
variable S contains Path. After either of the 
procedure calls Insert ('seal Pa', S, 3) or 
I nsert(' Pascal ', S, 1), S would contain Pascal 
Path. 

Delete also takes three arguments — the 
name of a String variable and two Integer ex- 
pressions. The first expression is taken as a 
character position in the String variable, and the 
second expression is the number of characters 
to remove from the String. Starting at the speci- 
fied character position, Delete removes the giv- 
en number of characters from the String. If S 
contains the result of the Insert example just 
given {Pascal Path), then Delete(S,3,7) would 
restore the String value Path to S. So, by the 
way, would Delete(S,l,7). 

Strings, Functions, and Parameters. Al- 
though Apple Pascal predeclares functions that 
return String values and that can be used in 
String expressions, a String is still considered an 
array type by the compiler, so you are not per- 
mitted to define functions of your own that re- 
turn Strings. Of course, you can write proce- 
dures that manipulate arbitrary String vari- 
ables through the VAR parameter mechanism. 

Note that the physical lengths of actual and 
formal VAR String parameters should match 
exactly. At the very least, the physical length de- 
clared for the formal parameter must not be 
greater than that of the actual parameter. 
Otherwise, a procedure or function would be 
"fooled" into thinking that the actual parame-

ter was larger than it really was and might try to 
assign a very long String value to it, overwrit- 
ing any important information that had the mis- 
fortune of lying next to the actual String pa- 
rameter. In the case of a mismatch, the com- 
piler will issue error message #175("Actual pa- 
rameter max string length < var formal max 
length"). For value parameters, the dynamic 
length of the actual parameter cannot be great- 
er than the physical length of the formal pa- 
rameter or a String Overflow error will occur 
during execution. 

String or Char? Single character constants 
and literals may be treated by the compiler as 
data of type String or Char, depending on the 
type of the variable to which they are assigned. 



For instance, A would be viewed as a Char 
datum in the assignment "ChVar := 'A' " pro- 
vided that ChVar is of type Char. Elsewhere in 
the same program A would be treated by the 
compiler as a String of length 1 in the state- 
ment "StrVar := 'A' " assuming StrVar is of 
type String. In "Ord('A')" the constant would 
be seen as a Char, but in Concat(A, B) both sin- 
gle-character constants would be taken as 
Strings. 

For another example of the dichotomy of 
Chars versus single-character strings, note that 
regular array indexing may be used to access in- 
dividual characters of a String as Char values. 
Thus, if S contains This is a String, then S[4] is 
the Char value s. However, Copy(S,4,l), al- 



though also the value s, is considered a String. 

The ambiguities between Char and String 
values confuse many beginning programmers. 
It is tempting to consider Char values and sin- 
gle-character Strings as equivalent, but they are 
not, and one should never be used in a context 
that requires the other. In Cable, and subse- 
quent programs that use Strings, you'll be 
shown various spots where you can sidestep 
(and sometimes even exploit) the strange rela- 
tionship between these two data types. As a 
matter of fact, we'll do so several times in de- 
veloping DisplayTown and ChangeTown. 

Looking under the Tree. Now that you've 
filled your head with Pascal knowledge for 
another month, you deserve to fill up on that 
holiday dinner, so go to it! After your meal, nes- 
tle cozily by a warm fire (or a warm computer if 
you have no hearth) and prepare for next 
month by thinking about how you'd imple- 
ment the following data conversion routines: 

PROCEDURE 

lntToString(Source: Integer; VAR Dest: String; 
MinFW: Integer; LPad: String); 

(* Build the character-string representation of 
decimal Source, such that it contains at least 
MinFW characters. Pad on the LEFT using Pad 
string, if necessary to achieve the Minimum 
Field Width, MinFW. Concentrate the final, 
padded representation of Source onto the right- 
hand end of Dest. *) 

FUNCTION 

Goodlnteger(VAR S: String; VAR SP: 

Integer; VAR Dest: Integer) 

:Boolean; 

(* Return True if character sequence in S, starting 
at position SP, represents a valid decimal 
Integer (ignoring leading blanks). If so, SP 
becomes SP + (length of sequence), and 
Dest acquires the value of corresponding 
Integer. On False return, SP and Dest remain 
untouched. *) 

Right away, you can see that IntToString 
and GoodString bear striking resemblances to 
our old friends IntegerOutput and Integerln- 
put; indeed, the clever reader should be able to 
rewrite those two earlier routines to the new 
specifications without much difficulty. A couple 
of new wrinkles are evident in IntToString, 
though: the concepts oi minimum field width and 
left-padding. These were included in the specifi- 
cation in order to permit IntToString to mimic 
Write and WriteLn's output formatting capa- 
bilities. However, where Write and WriteLn 
"pad" on the left with blanks only, IntToString 
can use any pattern specified by the LPad 
parameter. 

If you wish, you might want to try writing 
IntToString and GoodString on your own, be- 
fore "official" versions are presented next time. 
(No fair using the built-in Str procedure to 
make quick work of IntToString!) These two 
routines will form the heart of our address con- 
version facilities and will be made global to the 
Cable program, for the same reason that the 
function Capital was: to facilitate their use in 
several different routines. An updated version 
of Cable, including the global IntToString and 
GoodString as well as all routines we've de- 
veloped so far, will be presented at the start of 
next month's column. Ifl

So You Think You Know Applesoft ! 

BY DAVID WISEriAn 



So, you think you know how to use an Apple. You've been reading 
All About Applesoft for ten months, you've keyed in all the programs, 
maybe you've even taken a few courses in Basic programming. Maybe 
you even teach courses in Basic programming. Whatever your level of ex- 
pertise, you may be surprised to find out what you don't know. We're all 
still learning. 

Even short, simple Applesoft programs can contain syntax puzzles. 
So we present a brief exercise for the Apple student. Some of Applesoft's 
oddities are collected in this quiz. These are not Applesoft bugs; each is 
fully explained in the Applesoft manual. 

Applesoft is the ultimate judge of this quiz. If the answers do not sat- 
isfy you, try the program on your Apple and see for yourself. The quiz 
programs are shown exactly as they should be entered. Applesoft will 
parse the lines according to its own rules. If you list the program, you will 
see how Applesoft has grouped the letters into reserved words. The re- 
sults are often surprising. Take the quiz and see how you rate. Are you 
really the Applesoft heavyweight that you think you are? 

1 . This program gets a character from the keyboard and displays its 
ASCII value. Will it work for all keyboard input? 
10 GET A$ 
20 PRINT ASC (A$) 
30 GOTO 10 

■V 2. The following program accepts numeric input from the keyboard 
and prints it out. If an "A" is entered instead of a number, a "?reenter" 
message will result. Are there any nonnumeric characters that will be ac- 
cepted? 

10 INPUT A 

20 GOTO 10 



3. One of the four lines in this program produces a syntax error 
when the program is run. Which line is incorrect? 

10 PRINT 
20 PRINT"".; 
30 PRINT E"" + 
_ 40 PRINT AOE; 

\ 4. Which line in this program produces a syntax error message? 

10 PRINT ROTTEN 
20 TABS = SCRN (MID.DLE) 
30 LETTUCE = CABBAGE 
40 SCALES = FISH 

'"\ 5. Which lines of this program contain syntax errors? 

10 IF TUBA THEN 20 
20 GRIND = COFFEE 
30 REM SLEEP: FOR EVER 
40 VAL ("E - E") 
50 ? A 

■ > 6. Each of these lines produces an error message. What are the mes- 
sages that will be displayed? 

10 A$ = 2 

20 GOTO 60 

30 IF "B" THEN POP = WEASEL 

40 HIMEM: 0 

50 CONTENTMENT 

- 7. Here are three one-line programs. Describe what happens when 
each is run. 

10 FOR X% = 1 TO 5 : PRINT X% : NEXT 
10 GOSUB 10 

10 POKE 33,0

% 8. Match up the items on the two lists below. Match the memory lo- 
cations in the lettered list with the functions in the numbered list. 

1. Speaker A. -16287 

2. Enter Monitor B. 37 

3. Button zero C. -16336 

4. Cursor vertical D. -936 

5. Clear screen E. -151 

9. Describe the actions of the following immediate mode commands. 

DATA "THIS","AND","THAT" 

RESUME 

STOP 

DIM PR (LEN ("BONE")),FR$(PR(0)) 

V 10. Here is an opportunity for independent study. Basic uses many 
English words as commands. Write a program in Applesoft that makes 
sense in English. Can you write a one-liner that makes sense? Will it run? 
You will probably be able to write something more clever than the 
simple examples that follow. 

10 STOP : WAIT A.MINUTE.MR POSTMAN 

20 STOP : WAIT SO.PATIENT.LY 

10 HOME ; HOME : ON THE RANGE GOTO 10 

10 IF BAD ENGINE THEN RECALL MY CAR 

The Answer Key: Don't Peek! Here are the quiz answers. We work 
on the honor system, so you can grade yourself. Score 10 points for cor- 
rectly answering each question. Give yourself partial credit where 
applicable. 

1 . The get command halts the program until a single key or a key 
combination is pressed. The variable A$ is assigned the value of the key 
that is pressed, with one exception. Control-shift-P creates a null string, a 
string with no characters. Then ASC ("") gives a value error halting the 
program. If line 20 is changed to: 

20 PRINT ASC (A$+CHR${0)) 

the program will work correctly. A control-shift-P will print zero. Note 
that typing control-C will not stop this program when it's waiting for a 
keyboard input. 

2. The input command peculiarities make foolproofmg program da- 
ta input difficult. Let us limit our discussion to single character input. 
The input command graciously accepts the numbers 0 through 9. In ad- 
dition, several other characters will be accepted as valid numbers: 

The colon (:) and comma (,) both produce an "extra ignored" mes- 
sage. A zero is put into the variable A. 

E is accepted. Again, a zero is put into the variable A. Applesoft as- 
sumes that this is an abbreviated exponential entry. 

The plus (+), minus (-), period (.) and right arrow or control-U are 
all acceptable. Applesoft assumes that these are numeric zeros. 

3. Line 30 is the only line with a syntax error. The ending plus sign is 
the offender. Line 10 will space one line regardless of the number of 
quote marks that follow. Note that in line 20, the period prints as a zero. 

4. Line 20 has the only syntax error in this program. It is not the tab 
combination that causes the problem. Tab must be followed by a left pa- 
renthesis to be parsed as an Applesoft command. Here Applesoft is at- 
tempting to use the ABS function (absolute value). Line 10 contains the 
reserved word rot, but this is only reserved if it is followed by an equal 
sign. Line 30 will assign the value of Cabbage to Tuce. Let is a noise 
word that Applesoft recognizes as part of a value assignment statement. 
Finally, line 40 contains the word scale. Like rot, this is a hi-res graphics 
command only when followed by an equal sign. 

5. Let us take the lines one at a time. Line 10 contains a common er- 
ror. The A in tuba and the T in then combine and parse as the word "at." 
This creates a syntax error. Variable names ending in A are bad news. 

Line 20 will produce a syntax error. TheGR in Grind will put you in- 
to lo-res graphics, and Applesoft will not make sense out of what 
remains. 

Line 30 is fine. Once a rem is encountered, the remainder of the line is 
treated as a remark. "For ever" Ls part of the remark. 



Line 40 also produces a syntax error. Applesoft can readily evaluate 
the line, but it has no instructions on what to do with the value. There 
would be no problem if we had written: 

10 A = VAL ("E - E") 



or 



10 PRINT VAL C'E 



Line 50 has no problems. The question mark is another way of writ- 
ing print. If you list this line, the question mark will display as print. 

6. Here are the errors for each line: 

Line 10 Type mismatch error 
Line 20 Undefined statement error 
Line 30 Syntax error 
Line 40 Out of memory error 
Line 50 Syntax error 

Line 30 gives us some insight into what Applesoft does. If we drop 
the = weasel from the line, then the pop is executed by Applesoft, re- 
sulting in a return without gosub error. 

Line 50, of course, contains an embedded cont command. When cent 
is executed within a program, it halts the program, and Applesoft ap- 
pears to hang up. A control-C returns control to the operator. 

7. Each of the three one-liners has a problem. The first produces a 
syntax error. The variable in a for-next loop must be a real variable; the 
integer variable X% is unacceptable. The second quickie program pro- 
duces an out of memory error. After twenty-five gosubs without a re- 
turn, Applesoft's internal return stack is full. The third program runs 
fine. Unfortunately, it sets the width of the text window to zero, which 
hangs Applesoft. 

8. You should have matched the two columns as shown here: 

1. Speaker C. -16336 

2. Enter Monitor E. -151 

3. Button zero A. -16287 

4. Cursor vertical B. 37 

5. Clear screen D. -936 

9. Some commands will not work in immediate mode. Data will not 
generate an error message, but the values on the data line will not be 
available to any read command. The data line does nothing. Resume is 
used to return from an error procedure. In immediate mode it has no 
meaning and may hang the system or generate a meaningless error mes- 
sage. Stop is a valid immediate mode statement, but it accomplishes lit- 
tle. The word "break" is printed. The final line dimensions two arrays 
without any problem. 

10. Grade this exercise as an essay question. Give yourself one point 
for each guffaw.* 

Midterm Grades Are In. Now that you have completed the quiz and 
totaled your score, you must be eager to find out how well you have 
done. Here are the ratings:

Bob Wiseman has owned an Apple for three years. He teaches an introduc- 
tion to personal computers class and has occasionally thought of himself as 
an Applesoft expert. He credits the oddities presented in this quiz with keep- 
ing him humble in that respect.

why does EDU-mRE bother 



to captuie 
a moment 
in 

time? 

Decause the single most 

valuable tool in any 
instructor's repertoire is a 



moment of the learner's 
attention — when eyes are open 
and interest is high. That 
moment is too valuable to waste 
playing games. With this in 
mind, we design Edu-Ware 
instructional systems and craft 
Edu-Ware screen displays to 
capture that moment for all it's 
worth. 

The Al gebra Series and 
Edu-Ware® Fractions and 



Edu-Ware® Decimals illustrate 
the results of this design process. 
While the systems share solid 
instructional principles, their 
screen displays have been 
developed to meet their 
respective conditions of learning. 
Fractions and Decimals use color, 
graphics, and animation to link 
the mathematical with the 
concrete. Al gebra focuses on the 
logical operations between 
abstracts. 



Upper/lower case and 
double-sized fonts are 
clear and easy to read 



Fractions aqd Decimals 
use color-keying more 
freely, often to 
designate similar 
concepts, to 
standardize "correct" 
or "wrong." or simply 
to increase visual 
impact. 



Screen boundaries contain, 
eye movement, making it 
less likely for a learner's 
attention to stray. 

Titles displayed at the top 
of every screen identify 
unit, concept, and 
location within that 
concept. These "advanced 
organizers" increase 
comprehension by 
structuring the 
information which 
follows. 

Regions of information 
are placed to maximize 
the presentation's 
effectiveness. 



The animated figure in Edu-Ware® Fractions and 
Edu-Ware'^ Decimals is a character with which 
learners tend to identify, helping create a benign 
environment for instruction. The figure's movements 
cue attention to individual components of a concept 
or equation, helping to break a process down into 
sequential steps. 





Requests for the learner's 
response are presented in 
either color or inverse 
type. The learner has no 
doubt that he or she is 
being asked for an 
answer or to do a task. 



A touch of the 
arrow key will turn 
a "page." advancing 
to a new concept or 
backtracking to a 
previous one at the 
moment the learner is 



A moment makes all the difference.

Whenever energy manager Robert Bonoff wants to explain what he 
does for a living, he resorts to a parable. He calls it the parable of 
the pails. 

A person occupied a large room, Bonoff relates. In the room were 
2,880 empty pails, representing the number of quarter-hours in a thirty- 
day month. It was raining outside — a deluge that was to make a run at 
the Biblical record of forty days and forty nights. 

To amuse himself, the person in the room pretended that each rain- 
drop represented a kilowatt of electricity. Every fifteen minutes, he 
opened a window and placed one of the pails outside. When a quarter- 
hour had elapsed, he retrieved the outside pail and replaced it with 
another. At the end of a month — he had planned for this vigil, of 
course, by stocking in some good books, his Apple, and assorted junk 
foods — he was sitting in a room of buckets that were no longer empty. 

From the side the buckets looked the same — standard high-tech 
galvanized gray. From the top, however, it was a different story. Be- 
cause the rain had fallen at different rates during each fifteen-minute 
interval, the water levels in the pails were different. Some of the pails 



Super-Text Energy 

were nearly empty, others half-full. One pail demonstrated the differ- 
ence a drop makes. It was much closer to being full than the others. 

Data Bucket Management. For all the water he collected, our friend 
paid a price per drop. Then he paid another fee based on the amount of 
water in that one most nearly filled pail. Had he been able to control the 
rainfall, to make the water level in all the nails even, he would have paid 
much less. For one thing, the utility charging the fees could then have 
provided smaller pails. 

The man couldn't control the rain. But he could study the rain and 
change buckets more often when the fall was heavy, less often when it 
was light. 

Which just goes to show that he who manages his buckets wisely 
shall reap a pail of profit. That one full pail represents the typical com- 
mercial user's peak demand, the greatest usage of power during a fifteen- 
minute period in any given month, for which the user pays a premium. 
Some utilities may use a thirty-minute or hour-long demand period in 
their rates, says Bonoff, but all of them charge their commercial cus- 
tomers for two things — units of usage and highest usage. In other words, 
there's a special rate for the most filled bucket and another rate for all the 
buckets. 

The rationale behind the demand charge is simple enough, Bonoff

prepare by hand. 



explains. The utility has to have the capacity to meet extraordinary as 
well as ordinary demands, which means they have to invest in sufficient 
generators to supply the peaks. It seems only fair, they argue, that those 
who impose this additional capital burden on the system pick up the 
tab — and that tab's a charge that can represent up to a third of a com- 
pany's monthly power bill. 

Baby, It's Cold Inside. Which brings us back to our protagonist, 
your relationship to him, and the moral of this tale. To see dramatic de- 
creases in your monthly power bill, you have two concerns — overall 
usage and peak usage. To keep costs down, you must find a way to even 
out your usage demands. Enter the energy manager. Bonoff is the 
forty-eight-year-old founder and president of the Energy Savers Group, 
of Stamford, Connecticut. The name — picked from among combina- 
tions randomly spewed out by his Apple II Plus — conjures up images of 
placard-waving consumerists, but it actually refers to Bonoff s $300,000- 
a-year energy management company. Unlike the typical news-at-eleven 
meteorologist, Bonoff actually does something about the weather — at 
least inside buildings. He installs sophisticated microprocessors and pro- 
grammable controllers that can manipulate up to seventy different elec- 
tric load factors in commercial buildings and factories. The trick is to do 
more than smooth out the peak loads while lowering overall usage — it's 
to deliver promised reductions in both areas so that no one is really 
aware you did it. 

"A good energy system should be totally transparent to the people in 
the building," Bonoff explains. "If people become uncomfortable, they'll 
start to override the system and defeat the whole thing." 

On a simplistic level, the way to manipulate loads for fans, lights, 
water heaters, air conditioners, pumps and compressors, to name the 
most obvious juice guzzlers, is to shut off one or more of them. On that 
plane, energy management is your basic binary on-off proposition — 
unless you leave such piddling details to a human, in which case the air 
conditioners that were supposed to go off at five o'clock are still hum- 
ming away at eight the next morning. 

The binary proposition gets considerably more complicated when 
you're also trying to flatten demand peaks. If that is also the objective, 
you have to rely on a sophisticated program that produces a minimum 
number of simultaneous equipment starts. 

"When we cost up a job," says Bonoff, "what we're really talking 
about is what it costs us per load or group of loads to control." 

Micros Don't Take Holidays. Generally speaking, the most profit- 
able deal for him is an all-electric factory-office complex that isn't going 
twenty-four hours a day. The environment presents more problems in 
one sense, but it also yields many more solutions because you have more 
load-factor combinations to play with. Such a challenge is made for the 
microprocessors and programmable controllers Bonoff uses to combine 
and manipulate load factors. 

"What these things are essentially are computers that interface with 
the real world," he explains. "You can make them do virtually anything 
you want." 




In a typical building, says Bonoff, he's dealing with perhaps sixty to 
seventy load factors. His equipment not only turns lights on and off at 
prescribed times, it remembers to shut the system down on the Fourth of 
July when no one shows up for work. A school district near Bonoffs 
adopted home of Stamford gloats about its energy-management fore- 
sight every time a snowstorm forces the superintendent to cancel classes. 
Because the schools are under microprocessor controls and linked via 
modem, the superintendent can turn the system off by dialing a single 
number. 

Short of holidays and retooling furloughs, Bonoff isn't dealing with 
total system shutdowns. He's optimizing. He's calculating — factoring in 
historical energy use patterns and data from strategically placed sensors 
inside and outside the building to determine the latest possible moment 
to turn off the air conditioner, the lights, the heat. He is creating a subtle

new environment. The building is alive, waking up and turning in at dif- 
ferent times every day. And during those days, he's manipulating the on- 
and-off cycles of water pumps and air conditioner compressors, an 
energy-management technique known as duty cycling. 

According to Bonoff, it's been found that a compressor actually 
works more efficiently (draws less electricity) if it is made to work 
harder — by, for example, being deliberately turned off for, say, ten minutes 
every half hour. 

"Instead of cycling on and off five or six times as it would under ther- 
mostat control," says BonofT, "it will maybe only run and cycle off two 
or three times." 

If at the same time, you engineer different recycling schedules for 
multiple compressor units, you can further increase savings by reducing 
the demand charge that is linked to simultaneous tum-ons. 

In some cases, says Bonoff, an energy manager will arbitrarily estab- 
lish a demand target of, say, 15 to 20 percent of historical usage, which 
will automatically turn off noncritical load factors if that energy goal is 
threatened. 

"You can almost always turn off an electric hot water heater, and 
nobody will miss it if it goes off for fifteen minutes," says Bonoff 

There are other times when a target-minded energy manager will 
cause a little discomfort, such as when he shuts off the air conditioning in 
a building a half-hour before it empties at rush hour. But a well-de- 
signed system always allows for overrides of the target goal when it 
threatens critical load factors. The trick is to make sure a minor incon- 
venience doesn't become a major discomfort. 

Too Cheap To Be True. If Bonoff takes on a job, he says he usually 
can cut a company's monthly fuel bill upward of 15 to 20 percent. For 
Burndi, a leading manufacturer of electrical connectors, the savings ran 
in the neighborhood of $8,600 on a system cost of $58,000. Generally 
speaking, Bonoff is able to ensure a full payback on the installation 
within eighteen months to two years. That would certainly seem grist to 
the mill for bottom-liners, but Bonoff first has to get his foot in the 
door — literally. "Most people just don't believe you can save them that 
kind of money," he says. 

To overcome such resistance in post-OPEC-crisis America and get by 
that door, he offers his prospective clients that time-honored no-cost-or- 
obhgation free survey, along with a copy of his client list. All they must 
do is have someone show him around the facility and furnish him with 
fuel bills for the past fifteen months. 

Once he has determined what load factors are controllable through 
his on-site inspection, he pores over the fuel bills, extrapolates the energy- 
use patterns, and — voila! — he has a proposal to make. It's your basic, no- 
nonsense, fourteen-page contract, with all these boiler-plate paragraphs 
and options for this and that combination of load factor refinements. An 
absolute time-busting horror that, in the company's not-so-distant 
founding four years ago, took Bonoff the better part of three days to prepare 
by hand. 

Until, in the dawning of a better idea, he discovered word processing and 
Super-Text, ranked among the leaders of Soflalk's word processing 
top ten. 

They Yawned When He Sat Down at the Keyboard. In the begin- 
ning, it was just Bonoff, his typewriter, a programmable Texas Instru- 
ments calculator, and a secretary. 

"I'd write the letter by hand, then she'd type it up rough. I'd make 
ten million corrections and then she'd type up a new rough draft and I'd 
make more corrections." 

Well, you get the idea. The man was making a lot of unnecessary 
work for himself Here he was in the business of conserving energy and 
he was wasting his. It wasn't long before he realized there had to be a 
better way. 

Bonoffs first move toward word processing was to contract with a 
local computer service bureau. Bonoff still had to do his figuring on his 
T.I. calculator, but now he could manipulate paragraphs like load fac- 
tors on the bureau's mainframe word processor. What had taken him 
three days was now only taking an hour. It was a vast improvement over 
his Stone Age ways, but it, too, had its shortcomings. You had to pay for 
the computer time and on-line storage, so Bonoff started investigating 
the possibilities of having his own terminal. 



"At least I wouldn't have to leave to go over to the bureau." 

Owning his own computer was the furthest thing from his mind 
when, in late 1978, he punched a magazine bingo card for this strange- 
sounding company "with a name like a fruit. What the hell was an 
Apple?" Company literature that answered that question was dutifully 
filed away, but early in 1980 it was read in earnest as Bonoff took the 
plunge and bought an Apple II Plus. 

When he dived into the software end of the pool, he first went for 
VisiCalc, a half gainer that saved him another, shall we say, fruitless day 
in the preparation of proposals. His second foray was into word proces- 
sors, but Bonoff frankly admits he probably didn't make as many com- 
parisons as he might have. He was familiar with Data General and 
Wang office systems, tested WordStar, Apple Writer, and Super-Text in 
the store, and read all that he could on the others. He basically knew 
what he wanted in a word processor — global search and replace and an 
ability to patch and paste — but in the final analysis, there was no one fea- 
ture that tipped the scales in Super-Text's favor. 

"It just seemed to me that Super-Text could do more for the same 
money than the others," says Bonoff "All I can say now is that I can 
make Super-Text stand up and go through hoops." 

Some Frills Are More Basic than Others. Bonoff freely admits he is 
no software freak. When he decided on Super-Text, he did so with the at- 
titude that he could always buy another moderately priced program if it 
didn't pan out. What he was looking for, and what he feels he found, was 
something as easy to use as his typewriter. Instead of hitting a tab key to 
indent a line, now he simply had to strike a control key. 

He became so comfortable with the program that when Muse 
Software sent him an enhancement allowing for eighty-column as well as 
forty-column display he passed on buying the Videx card enabling him to 
use it. "I guess it would be nice," he reflects, "but to me that's just a frill." 

It's a frill because he can look at his forty-column display, he says, 
and know pretty much how it will appear on the printed page. Besides, if 
he doesn't want to rely on his educated eye, he can always fall back on 
another program update — a preview screen, in the print mode, that 
permits him to see the left and right margins of a page and reformat ac- 
cordingly. 

Speaking of screens, another useful feature that bewitches Bonoff is 
the ability to split his monitor. He finds this particularly useful because 
he can put one part of a file page on the upper part of the screen and 
display a related section occurring four pages later in the file on the 
lower half 

But the basic beauty of the program lies in the ease with which it 
permits him to whip off "a terrific letter" or knock out fourteen-page 
proposals at a clip of three a week. And the key to that accomplishment 
is another program adjunct, a Form Letter module, whose name Bonoff 
regards as a very poor description of such a powerful word process- 
ing tool. 

"You can create any kind of document you want — a report, or a 
letter — with as many variables in the body of the file as you want," he 
says admiringly. 

What the program permits a user to do is personalize form letters 
and documents of all types. Which means he can punch in the name and 
address of the form letter recipient; refer to that individual by name in 
the body text; adjust the content for particular occupations so Dr. Jones 
is schmoozed as a member of the medical fraternity; use prompt state- 
ments to insert data directed at one individual in a group mailing; include 
extra text for special subsets of a mailing Hst (like complimenting Sun- 
belt residents on their wonderful weather), along with the sine qua non of 
form letter packages — formatting and printing the envelope. 

The personalizing touch comes into play for Bonoff when he's 
fashioning a proposal that can have as many as a half-dozen options. One 
of these would be interfacing a microprocessor with an Apple via a 
modem to generate a print-out of energy-use data at specific times or to, 
say, dial a maintenance man at home. So when the monitor asks Bonoff 
what options are to go into the proposal to T. Jackson Witherspoon of 
North American Widget Company, the program knows enough to 
execute page breaks regardless of which ones he selects. Concludes 
Bonoff: "It's ideal for any businessman who wants to print out pro- 
posals that aren't exactly the same."

When SIERRA ON-LINE INC. began work on SCREENWRITER II, we wanted to make it the 
most powerful word processor on the market. We began by putting in boldfacing, 
underlining, form letter capabilities, global search and replace, support of multiple disk 
drives, full macro capabilities, generation of up to four indices, complete formatting 
capabilities, a software based keyboard buffer, full editing capability of any DOS 3.3 text 
or binary file (including APPLESOFT programs) and all other features you need for professional word processing. That was just the 
beginning 

Our next step was to make SCREENWRITER II hardware independent, so we eliminated the lower case adapter and the 80 column 
board. SCREENWRITER II is the only word processor on the market to offer true software based lower case and 70 column screen 
available today. 

The move that put us over the top was the introduction of printer spooling* which allows you to do your editing while printing, 
making your word processing time more efficient. 

With SCREENWRITER II, we've added all the features you need, did away with all the problems you can do without, and we did it all 
at a price that you can afford-$l29.95.

The Formatting Years. As Bonoff tells it, he fell into word process- 
ing much as he did into low-voltage electronics and energy manage- 
ment — sort of by accident. As a kid growing up in Rockville Center, 
Long Island, Bonoff was drawn to technical things: erector sets, chemis- 
try sets, the challenge of turning a pile of junk into an elegant piece of 
hardware. But this hobby didn't suggest a possible career until he was 
home sick one day with a broken television set. The repairer who came 
to fix the TV had very narrow skills, yet he was able to make a living — 
doing what Bonoff had a gift for. If the repairer had been an engineering 
type expert, Bonoff wonders where his life might have gone; he might 
never have recognized the potential for himself in this kind of career. 
Bonoff signed up for a mail-order electronics course from RCA Institute 
and learned how to fix all manner of household appliances. He was a 
Hardy boy right there in the Big Apple, running a repair business out of 
the basement of his parents' home. 

Later on, he took a stab at running his own stereo store, but when the 
industry leapt from hobbyist purity to cutthroat merchandising, he cast 
about for something new. And kind of by accident, he found himself in 
burglar alarms. His job performance was such that it attracted the atten- 
tion of a rival company, which in turn led to the Saga of New Mexico. 

Bonoff, who managed an alarm company for his new employer, was 
always on the lookout for new product lines. Sometime in 1977, an 
executive in that company sent him an ad for some electronic gadget 
about the size of a table-model radio. 

"You were supposed to be able to plug this gadget into a wall and 
control more than a hundred electronic operations going on all over a 
building. It was being advertised as an energy-management tool and I 
didn't even know what energy management was." 

His education was beginning fast. 

When he wrote the company for information, he received a dealer- 
ship application along with the promotional material. 

"They were trying to sell pie-in-the-sky franchises," he recalls. But 
the concept still intrigued him, so much so that when the sudden bank- 
ruptcy of his employer deposited him on the street, he decided to investi- 



Olivieri's Outline 

of 

Word Processors 

by Peter Ollvierl 



It's time now to begin examining some specific word processing 
packages. We'll look at two packages this month and at two or three 
more in each of the next several articles. Then, in a special installment of 
the series, we'll evaluate each package and include the reactions and ex- 
periences users have reported. 

It was tempting to print an enormous table with program character- 
istics listed down one side and the package names across the top — a fair- 
ly common approach to presenting this kind of material. But such an ar- 
rangement does not make it particularly easy to become familiar with the 
attributes of a particular package, nor does it allow for the inclusion of 
special features or unique aspects of a product. So we'll cover each pack- 
age separately, including such information as the package name, the ven- 
dor's address, the package price, the equipment needed, and comments 
about special features or interesting characteristics. 

The comments sections are likely to be especially useful. If you've 
listed your word processing needs, as we suggested last month, you'll be 
able to determine how close a given package comes to meeting them. 
One more bit of advice: when you're ready to buy, look carefully at the 
commands summaries provided by most packages' documentation. By 
referring to these, you'll be able to determine what options a package al- 



gate the funny radio more thoroughly. 

Somehow or other he managed to scrounge up a business partner, 
hopped a plane to New Mexico where the company was located, and 
returned with a draft dealership contract and two boxes in hand. Then 
things went sour again. His attorney declared the contract to be too one- 
sided. Then the company went bankrupt. Then the equipment blew up. 

Hardly a propitious b^inning, but Bonoff pressed forward, looking 
for other companies in the elertronics field. He finally latched on to Pa- 
cific Technology, in Kirkland, Washington, the largest manufacturer of 
microprocessor-based energy management systems in the country, ac- 
cording to Bonoff. His experience in New Mexico had scared him off 
franchising, but a nonrestrictive dealership was something else again. No 
protected territory, on the one hand, but no restriction on handling other 
products either. 

Today, four years later, he is installing or subcontracting installa- 
tions on Pacific Technology and Texas Instruments equipment. His 
client list is growing: the Crest Line leather goods division of Swank, 
Burndi, Walden Books, and New Medical Associates, operators of a 
chain of nursing homes. The business has increased tenfold, from 
$30,000 to $300,000 annually, and his work crew now includes four 
installers, two salesmen, and a secretary. 

It's Always Fair Weather. The force, in short, is definitely with 
energy management. The conservation ethic appears firmly entrenched 
in the public consciousness at the same time market-oriented utilities, 
faced with growing overcapacity, are actively promoting all-electric 
buildings. Load management has become the utility industry buzz word 
and electric heat pumps (that heat and cool buildings more efficiently 
than standard equipment) its sexiest product. The greater the conver- 
sions and rate breaks for off-peak users, the greater the prospects for 
BonofPs business. 

So when you pose the standard question and ask where he thinks the 
industry's going, he comes straight back with an answer. He has a 
popular product and the word processing power to market it rapidly. 
Says Bonoff, "The growth potential is tremendous." IW 



lows and how much effort is required to accomplish a particular task. If, 
for example, you have to press eight different keys just to erase a single 
character, it's easy to deduce that the system is not a winner when it 
comes to ease of use.

4122, Australia. Action-Research Northwest, 11442 Marine View Drive 
S.W., Seattle, WA 98146; (206) 241-1645. $295. 
Equipment required: 48K, a shift-key modification (hardware supplied), 
one or two disk drives, monitor, printer. 

Zardax was designed with the human in mind. Most people can learn 
to use it in a relatively short period of time. Like most word processors, 
Zardax can handle form letters, contracts, mailing lists, and report prep- 
aration. 

The program gives you a forty-column format that has upper and 
lower case and on-screen underHning. Since this is done on the hi-res 
screen, no lower-case chip is required. Optionally, the very same pro- 
gram can be used with a Vision-80, Doublevision, Smarterm, Sup'R 
Terminal, or Videx eighty-column board to get eighty columns and up- 
per-case/lower-case display. In addition, the program will take advan- 
tage of a 16K RAM card. 

. Zardax is compatible with a variety of printers, including NEC 
5510, NEC 5515, Diablo, Vista V300, Qume, Sprint 5, Centronics 737, 
Silentype, and the Epsons, among others. You can control page width, 
margin size, and justification. You can do single-sheet, continuous-sheet, 
and multiple-copy printing. Escape or control characters can be sent to 
the printer to produce emphasized characters and double-width charac- 
ters or to take advantage of any other special features of your particular 
printer. If you have a daisy wheel printer, you can use subscripts, super- 
scripts, overstriking, various line-spacing options, and different charac- 
ter pitches. 

The program enables list processing. You can create a form letter 
with certain fields left blank and merge a list of names and addresses with 
the letter, allowing for personalized communication.

For Line Surge Suppression 

The SYSTEM SAVER provides es- 
sential protection to hardware and 
data from dangerous power surges 
and spikes. 




SYSTEM SAVER 
APPLE II 



By connecting the Apple II 
power input through the SYSTEM 
SAVER, power is controlled in two 
ways: 1) Dangerous voltage spikes 
are clipped off at a safe 130 Volts 
RMS/175 Volts dc level, 2) High fre- 
quency noise is smoothed out be- 
fore reaching the Apple E. A PI type 
filter attenuates common mode 
noise signals by a minimum of 
30 dB from 600 khz to 20 mhz, with 
a maximum attenuation of 50 dB. 



For Cooling 

As soon as you move to 64K RAM 
or 80 columns on your Apple n you 
need SYSTEM SAVER. 

Today's advanced peripheral 
cards generate more heat. In addi- 
tion, the cards block any natural air 
flow through the Apple n creating 
high temperature conditions that 
substantially reduce the life of the 
cards and the computer itself. 



For Operating Efficiency 

SYSTEM SAVER contains two 
switched power outlets. As shown 
m the diagram, the SYSTEM 
SAVER efficiently organizes your 
system so that one convenient, 
front mounted 
power switch 
controls SYSTEM 
SAVER, Apple fl, 
monitor and printer. 




SYSTEM SAVER provides cor- 
rect cooling. An efficient, quiet fan 
draws fresh air across the mother 
board, over the power supply and 
out the side ventilation slots.

Documents created with Zardax can be up to 13,500 characters long. 
Longer documents must be treated as separate files (although this 
doesn't really present a problem). 

When you get ready to use the system, you're instructed to "install" 
the software and hardware. Installing the software means informing it 
about how your system is set up. Installing the hardware requires a 
keyboard modification. This must be done inside the machine itself and 
requires that you remove a chip and attach some clips. This process is 
easy and painless — and makes your word processor work better. While 
the procedure for the modification is clearly explained in the manual, 
some photographs depicting what must be done would also have been 
nice. In fact, there are no illustrations at all in the user manual. 

Despite the absence of illustrations, the user manual is among the 
best. It's very clearly written and thorough. Well-written documentation 
is, of course, one of the most important characteristics to look for in a 
system, because if you can't understand the manual your problems are 
likely to be many. 

The Zardax user manual begins with an overview of the system and 
then guides you through it by means of a tutorial that makes use of many 
of its features. 

The next section contains reference material for using the system; the 
menus you'll see on screen are given and explained in detail. There's also 
a section containing technical information about the operation of the sys- 
tem. Listings of many of the printer drivers and other routines are pro- 
vided in full. If you know a bit about programming, you're likely to find 
this information useful. At the back of the manual is a tear-out refer- 
ence card. 

Should any questions or problems arise, program users can take ad- 
vantage of a user hot line. If a disk is damaged and is returned within the 
first year after purchase, it will be replaced for $15. 

The Zardax package offers even more nice features. Brief descrip- 
tions of some of these follow. 

Transfer. Documents can be transferred easily from one disk to 
another (leaving the original file intact on the original disk). 

Screen display. On the forty-column on-screen display, words are sep- 
arated by a dot located about mid-character vertically. You might think 
this would be distracting, but it didn't turn out to be. Carriage returns are 
indicated by curving arrows on both size displays. 

Moving within a document. Moving around within a document is 
easy. To go to the beginning, for example, type control-B; to go to the 
end, type control-E. Up, down, left, and right are also designated by their 
logical control letters. 

Videoprint. This option lets you see what the document will look like 
when printed before you actually commit it to paper. 

Centering. Text can be centered automatically. 

Stop printing. This command allows you to stop printing in the mid- 
dle of a document. 

Conditional paging. This option allows you to specify that a new page 
should be begun under certain conditions. It allows you to prevent pages 
having only one line on them or lists being broken up between pages. 

Find and replace. With this feature you can locate and alter all occur- 
rences of a particular word or phrase in your document. 

Cut and pt^te. This allows you to move sections around in a docu- 
ment. You can "cut" something out of one area and "paste" it in 
another. Single paragraphs — or entries in a list — can be moved simply by 
pressing controi-M once and then hitting U or D to move up or down 
paragraph by paragraph. 

Glos.sar)). You can maintain a glossary of frequently used phrases and 
have them printed in your document by simply pressing the previously 
designated key. 

Labels. Mailing labels can be printed. 

Multiprinting. Two or more very long documents can be linked to- 
gether for final printing. 

Zardax is an excellent and very thorough word processing system. 
It's easy to use, contains most of the features you're likely to want as part 
of your system, and has a good user manual. 

Word Handler II, Silicon Valley Systems, 1625 El Camino Real, Suite 4, 
Belmont, CA 94002; (415) 593-^344. $199. 

Equipment required: 48K, one or two disk drives, monitor, printer. 



The Word Handler II word processing system is designed to run with- 
out requiring any hardware modifications whatsoever. It also offers 
some other capabilities that aren't found in the typical word processing 
package. One such feature is direct-to-disk editing, which allows you to 
work with documents that are larger than the Apple's main memory. 

Some of the strong points of this package include its ease of opera- 
tion and the clarity of its display format (which includes lower case, un- 
deriining, superscripts, subscripts, boldface type, justification, and un- 
limited tabs). You can move forward (or backward) by character, word, 
line, or page, and you can move to any particular phrase you specify. 
Blocks of text can be copied and/or moved, and your printed document 
can include page headings and page footers. 

Word Handler II displays a full sixty-six columns on screen. In effect, 
what you see on screen is what you get on the page. The displayed char- 
acters are, as you would expect, somewhat small and you may experi- 
ence some problems with resolution on some color television sets. Never- 
theless, it's very nice to be able to see the final form a document will take 
without having to add special hardware to your system. 

The program is compatible with a variety of printers including the 
Epson MX 80/100, Qume, Diablo, NEC, and the IDS 460/560. The 
standard word-wrap feature is included in the system. If you want upper- 
case letters, you can either use the escape key or install a shift-key modi- 
fication (not included). 

If users need questions answered or encounter problems, they are in- 
vited to call a special hot line. The reference card provided with the pro- 
gram is also quite a good source of information. 

In addition to displaying the text of the document on the screen, the 
program includes some lines at the bottom of the screen that tell you 
such things as the name of the document, what page you are on, 
and so on. 

The current version of the program has no provision for moving 
quickly to the beginning or the end of a document. Also, you can't send 
special control characters to the printer. 

The user manual is brief (fewer than fifty pages). The program's de- 
signers believe that users can learn to use Word Handler II in about 
twenty minutes, and it is simple. That's a good thing, because the man- 
ual is not especially appealing. It would be improved by a more profes- 
sional appearance. For example, a key is symbolized by a letter enclosed 
in a rectangle that looks hand-drawn. Trivial? Yes. But it does reflect on 
the product. 

It appears that the manual was created using Word Handler II. This 
is certainly a good idea. But if figures and drawings are going to be in- 
cluded they should be well done. The content of the manual is not diffi- 
cult reading, and it does indeed achieve the goal of getting the user work- 
ing with the system after only a short time. 

Word Handler II offers some more attractive features: 

Fabulous fan fold. Documents can be printed to appear on fan-fold- 
ed paper. In other words, you can print a document in such a way that it 
can easily be turned into a brochure. 

Twenty questions. Included in the package is a pamphlet answering 
the twenty "most asked questions" about Word Handler II. This is one 
example of the manufacturer's concern for and responsiveness to users of 
the program. 

Moving around and through. Cursor movement around and through 
the text is relatively easy (for example, control-W moves the cursor 
through the text one word at a time). The arrow keys handle the direc- 
tioh of movement. 

Space identification. Unbreakable spaces can be identified. This pre- 
vents certain combinations of words from being split between two lines. 
Many professional authors demand that this or some other hyphenation 
capability be a part of their system. 

Replace and conquer. Global replace is included as a standard part of 
the program. 

Field insertion. The insertion of fields into a predefined form letter is 

available. 

The system works rather well despite some of the aforementioned 
limitations. As always, it's up to you to decide which features are most 
important to your particular application. Then you're in a position to 
make the most cost-effective decision given your definition of need. 31

Videx, a frontrunner in 
microcomputer peripherals and software, 
announces two exciting new programs that 
will make existing software compatible with 
the 80-column VIDEX VIDEOTERM. 

APPLE WRITER ][ 

pre-boot with 80-Column Display 

This program allows an 80-column display for your APPLE 
WRITER ][, and access to true upper and lower case input 
from the keyboard. When combined with the ENHANCER ][, 
this program will provide a complete word processing 
package. 

Interested in word processing in different languages? The pre- 
boot program has been set up to allow APPLE WRITER ][ to 
prompt in other languages. With 
an Enhancer ][, the keyboard 
can be programmed to be 
compatible with different 
languages. 

$19.00 

Suggested retail price 




VisiCalc' 



pre-boot with 80-Column Display 

Now you can view the VisiCalc electronic worksheet window in 
80 columns. Since the entry line is also 80 columns wide, 
complex formulas can now be seen in their entirety for editing 
ease. An added bonus is the ability to display upper and lower 
case $49.00 

Suggested retail price 

For those who need even more power, a more advanced ver- 
sion combines all the above features with the ability to use 
many of the memory expansion boards currently available. A 
configuration editor allows VisiCalc to use a mixture of dif- 
ferent kinds of memory expansion cards. Just tell it what 
memory cards you have and which slots they are in. For exam- 
ple, you could use more than one language card equivalent. The 
memory cards can be combined 
to give you access up to 
1 76 K of memory!

VENTURES WITH 
— VISICALC 



BV )OE SHELTOn 



"What if just might be VisiCaltfs forte. Even users who are just be- 
ginning to use VisiCak can quickly see ways of using this program in 
what-if analysis. There are some other less well known ways of using 
VisiCalc as an aid to decision making. This month we'll look at two such 
methods: decision matrix and probability /value matrix, both of which 
can be used by managers in arriving at qualitative or quantitative 
decisions. 

Ever wonder if you could have fun with VisiCalc'^ Well, if you're a 
person who likes to gamble, VisiCalc could be an eye opener. In the 
course of this installment we'll also take a look at some ways of using 
VisiCalc to determine probabilities. 

Probabilities in Business. Managers often make decisions based 
upon unconscious calculations of probabilities. Decision matrix and 
probability/value matrix are two methods of quantifying the decision- 
making process. 

The decision matrix facilitates the decision process by helping to de- 
fine the important factors and their significance to the outcome. The de- 
cision matrix method is a cousin to probability theory. The probabil- 
ity/value matrix uses probabilities to provide quantitative answers. These 
two decision-making methods are similar. The first provides a numeric 
method of choosing a nonnumeric alternative, while the second provides 
a numeric solution to a numeric problem. 

Decision Matrix. How do managers make decisions? Often, their 
process runs something like this: look at as much of the available infor- 
mation as possible; apply judgmental factors (probabilities); make a de- 
cision. But often managers who have enough information available to 
make a good decision don't take enough time to weigh the facts. Here's 
where a decision matrix comes in. 

A simple decision matrix can be used for making decisions about 
anything from buying a company to what color rug an office should 
have. If you want to apply this method to your own life, try using it to 
decide which car to buy or where to take the family on vacation. 

As always, the first thing to do is boot VisiCalc. 

Our next step is to define the format of the matrix. Let's put decision 
criteria down the left side of the matrix and decision options across 
the top. 

For purposes of example, why don't we decide which of three people 
to hire for the position of company sales manager. In this instance we'll 
rate Smith, Jones, and Brown only on the three criteria shown in col- 
umns A and B, although you could add as many decision criteria as you 
wanted. 

Enter the decision criteria shown in figure 1 into columns A and B of 
the matrix. Then enter the candidates shown in row 2 into the appropri- 
ate cells.

Next comes the evaluation. In each cell in the matrix, enter a value 
that subjectively or objectively evaluates each decision point against each 
decision criteria. Any numeric reference can be used, but for our pur- 
poses, let's use I to 10 (with 10 being the highest rating). For example, we 
would rate Smith as a 7 in technical experience by entering a 7 in cell 
C3. Complete the remainder of the matrix by entering the values shown 
in figure 2.

Summing each of the columns (for example, @SUM(C3...C5)) would 
give you a gross estimate of each manager's potential. See figure 2 for the 
result. 

Based on the assessment illustrated in figure 2, Brown seems to edge 
out the other two candidates. But is this really a fair assessment? A case 
could be made that managerial experience is worth more than either 
technical experience or educational background. One easy method of 
weighting the values would be to fudge the managerial section by adding 
additional points to values in the managerial experience row. 

A more professional (and more useful) approach would be to apply 
weighting variables to each selection criterion. Move to cell A9 and B9 and 
enter MGR EXP WEIGHTING. You could weight each of the values, 
but for our example we'll weight only managerial experience. Assume 
that managerial experience is worth 1 .5 times the other criteria and enter 
1.5 in cell C9. 

In C6 enter +C3+(C4*C9)+C5. Replicate the formula into D6 and 
E6 using Relative, Relative, No Change, and Relative references. 

Brown and Smith are now tied. We might give the nod to either one 
of them based on personality or on our own instincts. Or, we might add 
another decision criterion and base our decision on that. Remember, we 
could have many more decision criteria, each with a different weighting.

You can see that using VisiCalc can make the process of determining a 
solution much easier. 

Now try ' 'what if?" See what weighting value allows Smith to have 
the highest score. Enter 1 .6 in C9 and you can see a .2 difference. Enter- 
ing 2 in C9 gives a 1 point difference. 

Probability /Value Matrix. Forecasting is a perfect example of a 
numbers game that business people often play ineffectively. Assume that 
you're going to forecast the sales of anchor cable. A number of factors 
can affect sales. For example, bad weather could mean that fewer people 
are boating, the price of the cable could be so high that people aren't re- 
placing it regularly, or the manufacturer might not be producing enough 
cable to meet the demand. In addition, each of these factors might have a 
different effect on each month you're trying to forecast. With all this in 
mind, how would you go about forecasting sales? 

The probability /value matrix involves using subjective estimates to 
determine a factor that can be applied against a base forecast to deter- 
mine an actual forecast. 

The first step is to set up the matrix shown in figure 4. You'll notice 
that this matrix is similar to the one shown in figure 1. 

Next, some assumptions about the model. We will once again enter a 
value between 1 and 10 in each cell. This value will indicate how we as- 
sess each factor against the sales of the previous year. For example, the 8 
that has been entered in D3 indicates that we expect to do 80 percent of 
last year's January sales based on the assumption that we'll have poor 
weather in January. Imagine that you are forecasting the sales of cable 
and fill in the cells in columns B, C, and D with values from 1 to 10 based 
upon whatever assumptions you choose. 

Next, determine the factor to apply against historical sales. Move to 
cell E3. Consider what we are trying to accomplish. We have assump- 
tions for three of the factors that might affect January sales. You'll no- 
tice that the prior columns are supply and demand oriented. If we look at 
the value in D3, we assume it to mean that we expect to do 80 percent of 
last year's sales. If last year's sales totaled one thousand feet, we can ex- 
pect to sell eight hundred feet in January of this year, based on the sea- 
sonal adjustment. The same reasoning can be applied to the remaining 
two values. Then it's a simple matter to average the factors in column E 
and apply the factor that results to historical sales. This will provide a 
forecast in column G. The formula in cell E3 would be: 

©AVERAGE (B3...D3)/10 

Enter some historical sales values (in feet) in column F. Then, in 
column G, multiply cell E3 times F3 (-(-E3*F3) to get the forecast for 
January. You can complete the matrix by replicating the formulas in col- 
umns E and G and entering the remaining historical sales. 

What if you feel that one sales factor should carry more weight than 
the others? Let's say that the seasonal factor is twice as important as the 
supply or the price. Then the formula in cell E3 would be: 

@AVERAGE(B3,C3,D3,D3)/10 

or 

@AVERAGE(B3...D3,D3)/10 

If you use the second formula, it's quite easy to enter additional sales 
factors into the model. Add some columns between columns B and D

and the ©AVERAGE expression will include them in computing the av- 
erage. If these additional factors should be weighted, you'll have to in- 
clude them a second time after the range (B3...D3) in the expression. 

It's Fun Time — Place Your Bets. Let's try a favorite form of proba- 
bility: tossing a coin. It is well known that the probability of throwing 
heads or tails on one toss of a coin is 50 percent. In other words, the odds 
of throwing either one are one chance out of two possibilities. If you 
throw a coin three times, the probability that it will come up heads is 50 
percent for each throw. The question is, what is the probability of throw- 
ing a coin and getting heads three times in a row? 

It's obvious that the odds of heads coming up on the first throw are 
50 percent. But what about the odds on the second and third throws? 
Well, if you throw one coin three times, you have a chance of getting the 
combinations shown in figure 5. 

For three throws there are eight possible outcomes and, as you can 
see, only one possibility of getting heads three times in a row! The odds 
are one out of eight, or 12.5 percent. 

There's a numeric method of determining probability that is easier 
than writing down all the possible outcomes and figuring the results. 

Let's begin with the total possible outcomes. There are two possible 
outcomes for each toss and three tosses. The total number of outcomes is 
determined by multiplying the number of possible outcomes for each 
toss times itself for the number of throws being made. In our example 
you would multiply 2 to the third power, or 2x2x2 = 8. If you tossed 
the coin five times, there would be thirty-two possible combinations. 

If you're interested in throwing something other than straight heads 
or tails, it's important to consider what the odds are of throwing two tails 
and one heads. Look at figure 5 and you'll see that it's possible to throw 
two tails and one heads in three different ways. But if the question is 
couched, "What are the odds of throwing heads followed by two tails in 
three throws?" the odds would be 12.5 percent, or one in eight. Heads- 
tails-tails occurs only once. 

The next question is, can VisiCalc compute the odds of throwing 
heads five, six, or seven times in a row? Let's give it a try. 

Clear VisiCalc (/CY). 

In A3 enter POSS/EVENT. This is the total number of combina- 
tions that are possible with each throw of the coin. Enter the answer 2 in 
B3. If we were throwing dice, the answer for throwing an individual die 
would be 6. 

You'll probably want to set the column width to 12 (/GC12). 
In A6 enter "# OF ROLLS. 

In B5 enter TTL POSS for total possible and in B6 enter COMBIN 
for combinations. 

• In A8 through A17 enter 1 through 10. 

In B8 enter +B3AA8. This expression will evaluate 2 (the possible 
occurrences per roll) to the nth exponent, where n is the total number 
of rolls. 

Replicate B8 into B9 through B 17 using No Change and Relative ref- 
erences. 

Column B should display some interesting information. The odds of 
throwing heads ten times in a row are 1 in 1,024. That translates into a 
probability of .0009 percent. Want to bet you could throw heads ten 
times in a row? 

VisiCalc can be used to determine many other types of probabilities. 
In future columns, we'll examine some other ways to have fun with 
probability. JM

VisiCalc was a swell Idea 

for then. 



The next generation. First generation electronic 
worksheets were a good idea. They were early software 
managennent tools that could eliminate a lot of hours 
with a spreadsheet, calculator, pencil and eraser. Enter 
Multiplan, the next generation electronic worksheet 
that's as easy to use as it is useful. 
Make comparisons. Compare Multiplan to any of 
the earlier electronic worksheets. We've given you some 
"prompts" above. 

Compare learning time. Multiplan's tutorial book brings 
you up to speed. Fast. But Multiplan doesn't stop there. 
Multiplan's On-line Reference Guide gives you instant 
help if you have questions. It knows where you are in 
Multiplan and offers information related to your problem, 
right on the screen. 

Compare ease of use. All Multiplan prompts are 
full length words or phrases. And Multiplan provides 
"naming," the ability to assign a plain English name to any

cell or area. "Gross Profit = Sales— Cost" rather than 
"AA44=AZ23— BK154." Which means you can work 
more intuitively. And faster. 

Compare utility. Multiplan lets you link related work- 
sheets so that information is transferred between them 
automatically. For instance, you can keep regional sales 
forecasts on separate sheets but link them with your overall 
company forecast. Then, just change the forecast for 
any region, and the company forecast sheet is updated 
automatically. Something you can't do with first generation 
worksheets. 

Compare reports. Not just the work you can do, but the 

way you can present it. Multiplan's flexible formatting 
options allow you to produce presentation-quality reports. 
And its sorting capability lets you sort by either alpha- 
betic or numeric order. So a sales manager who normally 
lists sales regions alphabetically could sort by amount 
sold and conveniently rank by sales performance. The

result is a more meaningful and useful presentation of data. 
Compare availability. With Multiplan, you're not 
limited to a single range of computers. Multiplan is avail- 
able for Apple® and for microcomputers that run 
MS™-DOS, XENIX,™ or CP/M-80® operating systems. 
Multiplan supports both 40- and 80- columns on the 
Apple II. 

Compare the source. Microsoft was the world's first

DOS PIE 

in CP/M 



NOVEMBER 1982 SOI^TALK W 231 

BV Don WORTH 



There is a small but very vocal group in the Apple user community 
who will tell you that the PIE full screen editor, pubhshed by Hayden, is 
the last word in editors for a microcomputer. Despite the risk of exag- 
geration, many will claim that PIE is more flexible and responsive than 
most high-powered editing systems even on large time-sharing systems. 
Perhaps it is PIFs well tuned command structure and careful "user en- 
gineering" or perhaps it is just that its aficionados have used it so long 
that they have become overly biased (perhaps a bit of both). Whatever 
the reasons, the thought of having to work under another operating sys- 
tem, such as CP/M, without one's favorite editor can be likened to fix- 
ing a watch while wearing boxing gloves! Even if another full screen edi- 
tor was available, having to juggle two sets of control key layouts in one's 
mind while simultaneously trying to keep straight the differences be- 
tween DOS and CP/M is a task that is next to impossible. Why can't 
PIE run under Apple CP/M? 

Why not? The 6502 processor is still there, albeit hidden behind the 
SoftCard's Z-80. A small front end cou\d be written in Z-80 assembly lan- 
guage that would read a text file into PIE's memory buffer, switch 
CPUs, and pass control to PIE. When PIE exits, the front end, running 
under the Z-80 again, could save the edited file back to the CP/M disk. 
To give credit where credit is due, this is exactly how Randall Hyde did 
an early, somewhat experimental, forty column version of PIE that ran 
under CP/M. What was needed was a reliable front end that would sup- 
port both forty and eighty column versions of the PIE editor as well as 
providing support for both text editing and program development. Enter 
CPMPIE. 

How It Works. CPMPIE consists of an assembly language front end, 
written in Z-80, wrapped around the 6502 machine language PIE editor. 
The PIE shell, or command mode, is removed and functionally replaced 
with the Z-80 code. The front end reads a CP/M text file into memory 
(exactly where the PIE editor expects to find it) and then calls PIE in 6502 
mode. Should the editor exit back to the front aid (using shift-control- 
P) the Z-80 code writes the modified memory image back out to the same 
(or any other) CP/M text file. Obviously, since PIE must run in 6502 
mode, CPMPIE will only run on an Apple II wath a Z-80 — so owners of 
other CP/M machines are out of luck! In theory, any version of the PIE 
editor will work with CPMPIE, although it has only been tested with the 
Smarterm eighty column version and the standard forty column version. 
The new PIE Writer should also work if certain changes are made to the 
front end (the editor takes up more space in memory and zero-page 
assignments are slightly different). This will be left to the enterprising 
reader. 

When writing the front end, several special features were added for 
editing files with a suffix of .asm. When an .asm file is read, all tab char- 
acters are expanded to PIE'% default tab positions (every eight columns). 
PIE is also placed in upper case lock upon entry. When the file is later 
written back to disk, tabs are inserted whenever possible and blanks are 
removed. This was done to save disk space (about 33 percent over files 
without tabs) and to provide a more natural appearance to assembler 
listings. Tabs are not inserted within quoted strings, however, as this 
could play havoc on define byte ASCII strings! 

As a CP/M file is read, line feeds are discarded and the most signifi- 
cant bit is forced on. As a file is written back to disk, the most significant 
bit is turned off and a line feed is inserted after each carriage return. A 
control-Z character is added to mark the end of the file. These are all 
standard CP/M conventions. 

Using CPMPIE. The procedure outlined later will create a com 
(command) file called CPMPIE.com. (Of course the file may be renamed 
to PIE.com, P.com, or anything else if typing six letter commands is dif- 
ficult.) To invoke CPMPIE, one may type any of the following: 

CPMPIE (newfile.typ) 

or 



CPMPIE (oldfile.typ) 

or 

CPMPIE (oldfile.typ outfile.typ) 

In the first case, no file is loaded, and upon exit, CPMPIE will save the 
text that has been entered as a new file using the name given. In the sec- 
ond case, the file substituted for oldfile.typ is first read into memory, and, 
when PIE is exited, the old file is overwritten by the changed text. In the 
third case, an existing file is read, but the modified text is written to the 
file designated as the output file. For example: 

CPMPIE PROG .ASM PROG.BAK 

will read from Prog.asm but will write to Prog.bak. Note that the above 
syntax is not entirely standard for CP/M but is probably less confusing. 
Remember also that if the input file has the .asm suffix then tab process- 
ing will be done and PIE will initially be placed in upper case lock. To 
exit PIE without saving to the output file (in any of the three cases above) 
simply press reset. CP/M will warm start and the input file, if there is 
one, will not be affected in any way. 

Procedure for Creating CPMPIE. To create CPMPIE, first boot a 
PIE distribution disk and configure the editor to your hardware and 
your own tastes (upper/lower case display modes, bell column, shift key 
modification, and so on). Also, tabs should be set at every eight columns 
(this is the default). Now, boot DOS and isolate the PIE editor in a bi- 
nary file as follows: 

BLOAD APPLE PIE 

BSAVE EDITOR,A$1280,L$2080 

To the author's knowledge, the address and length here are identical for 
all versions of PIE. PIE Writer'^ editor begins at the same location but is 
greater in length. After you have created a file containing the editor (the 
PIE command shell has been removed), boot CP/M and create a new 
CP/M disk containing only the APDOS.com and DDT.com files found 
on the CP/M master disk. Your first job will be to move the editor over 
to CP/M: 

APDOS 

A:EDITOR=A:EDITOR 

You will be instructed to insert the DOS disk containing the binary file 
you previously created and then the CP/M disk you have prepared (this 
cycle will occur twice). Now you are ready to type in the CPMPIE front 
end. Type: 

DDT 

to get into DDT. The computer will respond 

DDT VER 2.2 

? 

Type: 
S100 

and the display will return: 
0100 00 

DDT is showing you the contents of location 0100 in hexadecimal. It 
may not be 00 on your machine but that's okay. Type the new value 
shown in Hex Dump, Part 1 (location 0100 is to be a C3). DDT will 
then show you location 101. Type its value (CD) and continue until all of 
Part 1 has been entered (through address 259). When you are finished, 
type a period to exit the Set mode. You can do this at any time during en- 
try if you make a mistake and use the S command with another address 
to start from where you left off or to back up. Now type S2416 and re- 
peat the above procedure to type the data in Hex Dump, Part 2. When

appears, type: 

SAVE 38 PIEFE

This will save the memory image you have entered and return you to 
DDT for further work. Now type the following DDT commands (omit- 
ting the comments in parentheses):

Smarterm installed, you can cause CPMPIE to switch the Smarterm 
over to forty column mode by setting addresses OlOC and OlOD to BF 
and EO, respectively (SEOBF causes the Smarterm to select forty column 
mode). Don't do this if you are using an eighty column version of PIE or 
if you do not have an eighty column board! If you have some other form 
of eighty column board and want to do this, consult the manufacturer's 
documentation for the proper I/O address to select. 

When all of the above has been done (phew!), type control-C to exit 
DDT and, when the system prompt reappears, type: 

SAVE 38 CPMPIE.COM 

CPMPIE is now ready to use! For those who are curious about inner 
workings, we have included a memory map showing the organization of 
the CPMPIE front and back ends, the PIE editor itself, and the working 
space for the text file. There is also a complete listing of the CPMPIE 
source file, fully commented, which was done on the ASM assembler.

LIST HANDLER 



The List Handler is, without doubt, 
much more than a mailmerge 
program. 

Presto! List Handler turns your 
Apple® into a quick response file cab- 
inet with room to grow storage space. 
With List (Handler you can hold up to 
3000 records per drive so that 24000 
can be kept on-line at the same time 
with multiple disk drives. 
These records can be addresses if 
you choose, but here's where the ver- 
satility and flexibility come in. 



Put what you like on those records! 

• inventory • product lists 

• form letters • short newsletters 

• mailing lists • personnel directories 

• invoices • labels 
The list is endless. 

The List Handler will run on one or 
more drives, read and write DIF for- 
mat and has unlimited sort fields. 
List Handler can stand alone or as an 
interface with your Word Handler (or 
most other word processors) for the 

Simply the best. . . 



most efficient word processing duo 
around. 

The List Handler will surprise you, 
but the first surprise will be the price! 
At 89.95 the List Handler is the best 
and the only buy of its type around. 
The enormity of Santa's job may have 
you skeptical of Santa's exist- 
ence—but when you see the List 
Handler you might just believe in 
Santa again! See your Apple dealer 
for the List Handler.

$19.95 

Edited by 
Jeffrey Stanton, 
Robert P. Wells, Ph.D.,

Software can be a significant 
investment. But many times 
it's difficult to compare similar 
programs to find exactly the 
program you want. 

Enter The Book of Apple 
Software 1983. It's the only 
source that evaluates (not just 
lists) hundreds of programs 
available for Apple micro-

Each evaluation is written by 
an expert in the type of program 
being reviewed, be it Utilities, 
Accounting, Education, Word 
Processing or Games and 
Entertainment. So you get top- 
notch, impartial information. 



Not only does each evalua- 
tion tell you all the hard facts 
(like price, hardware require- 
ments, language, etc), it also 
gives you a letter grade (A 
through F) in categories like 
Ease of Use, Reliability, 
Creativity, Visual Appeal and, 
most importantly, Value for 
Your Money. 

What's more, the reviews are 
readable and entertaining, so 
you'll not only spend more 
wisely on software, you'll have 
a good time doing it.

It's finally available. Every- 
thing you wanted to know about 
creating arcade games - from

who to ask. 




Jeffrey Stanton takes you 
from game concept through Lo- 
Res and Hi-Res color graphics 
at the machine language level. 
And he gives you a thorough 
grounding in the Apple's screen

Using flow charts and work- 
ing examples he discusses 
scoring, laser fire, explosions, 
and bomb drops in both single 
screen and scrolling games. 

This is the "must-have" book 
for anyone who wants to under- 
stand and create a computer 
game.

Volume TWO! 



^^^^ by Bob Nacon 



The success of the original Amper-Mag i c" program package and the 
introduction of its technigue for attaching new commands to Applesoft 
programs has stimulated the production of Command Library" packages 
designed around a 'theme' such as information display or output. Input, 
memory management, etc., which will enhance your Applesoft programs. They 
will give your program a professional operation and appearance by 
increasing speed, reducing size, and giving you features you never could 
have before, while still allowing you to program with the ease of BASIC. 

Ampei — Magic Command Library No. 2 is dedicated to information display 
and output capabilities. Read on and enjoy the new programming power 
Ampei — Magic Command Library No. 2 wil I give you. 

This disk contains 27 machine language routines ready to be inserted 
quickly and painlessly into your own Applesoft programs. Included among 
them is the most powerful PRINT USING routine yet created for Applesoft, 
as well as some small but very handy routines for controlling the appear- 
ance and activity on the display screen. 

In order to use these commands, you wil I need the Ampei — Magic program 
itself which is contained on Volume One. SOME commands on this disk are: 

** Access the most powerful PRINT USING command EVER for the Apple. 
It sure does more than just line up decimal points! It works with 
strings of characters as wel I as numbers, and lets the program de- 
cide whether to make them Flash or Inverse or Normal depending on 
conditions you specify. With numbers, you can have fixed or 
floating dollar sign and/or optional commas and a variety of fill 
characters. You can embed standard phrases within your format de- 
sign. You can even print to the screen WHILE outputtinq to the 
printer! And generate NO GARBAGE to collect! All in all, the 
most powerful PRINT USING yet! 

** Print to the screen while a peripheral is active 



«» 



Save and restore instantly any text screen, no matter how complex 
with flashing, inverse, and any window settings... 



•* Make your program WAIT a length of time specified in ordinary sec- 
onds (to the tenth of a second); the time may be a variable or 
expression which can be controlled by the program... 



«» 



»« 



Print anywhere on the screen under program control, either with 
absolute movements or with relative movements... 

Print string arrays to any device, with or without an appended 
special character, and WITHOUT A LOOP... 

** Set, clear, or toggle ANY bit or bits anywhere in RAM memory... 

** Check the keyboard when called, pause if SPACEBAR is pressed, then 
continue If SPACE is pressed again or GOTO a location if RETURN is 
pressed. .. 

** Print the current text screen on command or from the program... 

** Send ASCII characters to peripheral devices and POKE peripheral 
card memory to set or clear bits for control purposes...

BV PAUL LUTUl A(ID PHIL TUOMPIOII 



Last month's Maxwell animation can be broken down into a few 
simple steps: Three separate images are displayed, each followed by a 
short pause, altogether showing Maxwell take one step. The area that 
will not be overwritten by the next step is erased, and the block is posi- 
tioned one character space to the left. This process is repeated and Max- 
well takes one step after another, moving to the left. 

Two aspects of this animation are worth exploring: the length of the 
pause and the number of images displayed before repeating the cycle. 
Both of these contribute to the overall smoothness of the animation. 

The question of how long to pause between images is, of course, very 
subjective. In most cases, some kind of pause will be needed to view the 
image being displayed before it is erased or overwritten. A ghost effect 
can be created by printing and immediately erasing a character block. 
Too long a pause can also cause problems. It allows people to notice the 
individual steps in the animation, changing it from a movielike motion to 
a rapid slide show. The pause in the Maxwell animation is about a tenth 
of a second. Depending on the application, a good pause between im- 
ages will usually range from one twenty-fifth to one quarter of a second. 
The pause can be created by drawing other graphics elsewhere on the 
screen, using a sound effect, or simply wasting time with an empty loop. 

The second, and more important, contributor to smooth animation 
is how far to move the object before redisplaying it. (We'll call this the 
step size.) Obviously an image that moves a third of the way across the 
screen with each frame will not be very smooth. The most convenient 
step size to use is one character width (assuming we're moving horizon- 
tally). Here the process is simple: draw the block, wait, erase any por- 
tions of the image that will not be replaced by the next block, reposition 



one character space over, and repeat. Only one block image is needed, 
the program is short, and the animation is reasonably smooth. 

The quality of the animation can be improved by using a step size 
smaller than one character width, however. Since character blocks can 
only be printed on character boundaries, two or more separate images 
are used, each subsequent image shifted a portion of a character width. 
This is what is done in the Maxwell demonstration. Three separate 
blocks are displayed on each character position, and each image shows 
Maxwell about a third of a character position farther to the left. There- 
fore, the step size is a third of a character width. You may want to have 
another look at the Maxwell images from the character editor. Type: 

READ " CHAREDITOR '■ 
HOME RUN 

■ Get the file Chr. Maxwell, select a Blocksize of 2 by 3, then Read 
character numbers 64, 70, and 76, one after another. You can see that 
Maxwell moves to the left with each image while the block itself is 
printed in the same place. 

Since there are seven pixels in the width of one character, the limit to 
step size is seven images per character position. With this step size, a new 
image could be drawn starting on every pixel. When using smaller step 
sizes, the wait pauses can usually be of a shorter duration, since each im- 
age will not be very different or far away from the previous one. 

Step sizes need to be considered before creating the character sets. 
Suppose you want to create an image that fills a three by two character 
block and moves three steps per character width. Three separate blocks 
are needed to show the image in each of the three positions. If you draw

your three by two image in the character editor using a three by two 
bloci<, there will be no room within the block to shift the image from side 
to side. The solution is to define a block that is four characters wide, 
rather than three. The first image will leave some free space on the left, 
the next will be centered, and the last will leave space on the right. 

If you wish to create duplicate images in the character set that are off- 
set by a few pixels, redrawing each image can be time consuming. 
Fortunately, the combination of a new routine and a feature built into 
the character editor can make the task much easier. 

When an image created in the character editor is saved into a charac- 
ter set, the editor reads the image directly off of the high-resolution 
screen. This means that anything that can be drawn in the upper-left cor- 
ner of the screen can be written into a character set by the character 
editor. This is exactly why the editor does not automatically erase the 
screen as it starts up. It allows you to place an image on the screen, run 
the editor, and save the image as a character block. The screen area used 
starts at 1 viab I hlab, which is the hi-res point (7, 8), and extends to the 
right and downward according to the block size selected in the editor. 

If we had a way of plotting character blocks starting on any pixel (in- 
stead of just on character boundaries), then we could save the shifted im- 
age back into the character set. Below is a routine to do just that. It reads 
a given character block from memory and plots it point by point at any 
position on the screen. Type edit to enter the GraForth text editor, type in 
the word definitions, save them to disk, then compile them into the word 
library. Typing the comments is, of course, optional.

It balances your checkbook 
and creates a valuable library 
of financial facts. 



Sort checks or deposits by category codes. 
See totals for expenditures or income. 
Get 100 user-defined categories. 



You'll see totals for anything: household 
budgets, financial forecasts, or tax items. See 
detailed listings or get totals only. Either way you'll 
get up-to-date information about making and 
spending money. You'll save time and money at 
tax time too. 

More: if you own a small business, you can 
generate income statements, get sales by 
category, or see cash flow. Best of all, most 
accounting is an automatic result of checkbook 
balancing. You can put Double Check in a non- 
checkbook mode and create "aged accounts 
receivables", assets, or petty cash accounts. It 
also works for credit card control. 

THE EASIEST BALANCER YET 

On your computer screen, you see a facsimile of 
your checkbook. You see 17 items per screen; you 
can scroll for more. You'll see checks, deposits, 
plus a running balance. . . it's a computerized 
replica of your checkbook. Balancing is easy 
because checkbook errors appear immediately. 

Bank statement balancing is even easier. Just 
enter the numbers of "cleared checks". Instantly, 
the computer displays all the matching data (date, 
payee, amount, etc.). Compare with statement 
totals for super-fast balancing. 

POWERFUL CODING SYSTEM 

Double Checks coding system is simple, yet 
very powerful. As the computer balances your 
checkbook, you give each check or deposit its 
own category code. In the process, you build files 
of financial information which you can sort, list, 
or total. 

Thus, Double Check creates a unique financial 
data base. You get totals for anything. You can 
label, change, or delete categories anytime. . . 
without effecting data. We even give you an on- 



screen category dictionary: Just press "Ctrl-O"; 
you'll see code numbers plus your labels. 

You get 100 categories. . . enough for budgets 
or bookkeeping. You can sort by any category or 
sort by month. You can list the entire file, or 
selected codes. You can print it out or display on 
your screen.

The variables you need to set are not changed when Pixelblk is run, 
so they do not need to be reset every time. 

Let's run the whole pixel-shift-and-save procedure through, assum- 
ing GraForth has just been booted. Since Maxwell is already a shifted 
set, we'll shift one of the helicopter images from the Chr.Stuff character 
set (discussed on page 7-9 of the GraForth manual), so that it starts mid- 
way between two character positions: 

1 . Read the pixel-shifter routines onto the word library. Use the file 
name you saved the pixel-shifter with;

2. Read the character editor in above the pixel-shifter

3. Load the character set:

5. In one line, erase the screen, draw the block, and enter the char- 
acter editor:

character editor. ) 



6. Now that you're in the character editor, set a block size wide 
enough to fit the new image. Press B: 

Enter Block Horizontal Size :6 
Enter Block Vertical Size :3 

7. Write the image into the character set. We're going to overwrite 
the three happy-face images here. Press W: 

Enter character number 
to be written : 78 

From here you can either edit the image further or save the character set 
to disk. Pixel-shifting can also come in handy for changing the colors in 
character shapes, as we'll see in a few moments. 

GraForth can also display characters in eight different sizes, using the 
word chrsize. Chrsize removes a number ft-om the stack to determine 
what size subsequent characters will be displayed in. A character size of 
zero selects the normal text display. Character sizes one through eight use 
a different method for displaying characters; each dot, or pixel, of the 
character is plotted as a small rectangle, similar to the rectangles created 
with the fill command. Typing 1 chrsize results in a normal size display; 
8 chrsize draws characters eight times larger. 

The rectangle-type character plotting allows some additional capa- 
bilities. The color of the characters can be selected with the word color, 
while the normal text display will only display color if the characters were 
created with color. The larger character sizes can also be used in Gra- 
Forth's exclusive-or mode (exmode), so that characters can be plotted 
over graphics and then erased without disturbing the underlying graph- 
ics! The price paid for these features is speed The normal display can 
print characters much faster. The larger sizes don't have the speed neces- 
sary for smooth, animated character graphics. They are best used for dis- 
playing assorted messages or still character images. 

Let's have a look at how GraForth keeps track of the characters on 
the screen, and how this affects character display. When your Apple is in

text mode (no graphics), all of the characters on the screen are stored as 
ASCII values in a reserved area of memory. The hardware continuously 
reads these values and creates a character video display from them. 

The hi-res graphics mode uses one of two other areas in memory for 
its display. Here, each dot on the screen is stored as a bit in memory. 
Changing the bits changes the display. 

When GraForth displays a character on the hi-res screen, it stores the 
ASCII value of the character in the unseen text memory space. This al- 
lows GraForth to keep track of what characters are where without hav- 
ing to read through a lot of hi-res memory. It then looks up the shape of 
the character in the current character set and writes that shape into the 
hi-res space, which causes that character to appear on the screen. 

As mentioned on pages 7-14 and 7-15 of the GraForth manual, be- 
fore GraForth decides to print a character, it first checks the text area to 
see if that character is already on the screen. If it is, then the character is 
not reprinted. This speeds hi-res scrolling considerably. However, char- 
acter set changes and unblk commands do not affect the contents of the 
text page and can produce discrepancies between what you see and what 
you get. This is best clarified with an example. Enter the following lines: 

CR 132 PUTC PRINT " BLOAD CHR.SLANT,A2816 " CR — 
2816 CHRADR 

HOME PRINT " ONE LINE " CR 

CHRSET CHRADR 

0 VTAB PRINT " TWO LINES " CR 

We first printed the line "one line" using the slant character set, then 
printed the line "two lines" over the top of it using the standard charac- 
ter set. Note that the "line" in "lines" is still in the slant set. GraForth 
checked the text screen, and since it found the characters already there, it 
did not reprint them in the new character set. 

One solution is to clear the text memory. If this is done, GraForth 
will not find any identical characters and will always reprint. The com- 
mand —936 call will clear the text window to spaces without affecting the 
graphics screen: 

2816 CHRADR 

HOME PRINT '■ ONE LINE " CR 
CHRSET CHRADR 

-936 CALL 0 VTAB PRINT " TWO LINES " CR 

The call cleared the text window and allowed the entire line to be re- 
printed in the new character set. 

If you ever find characters not printing when you think they should, 
then their ASCII values are probably already in the text memory, pre- 
venting them from being reprinted. This is especially true if you want to 
print a space character (ASCII 160, or character number 0) that has been 
redefined to be a visible graphics image, since there are many space char- 
acters already lurking in the text page of a screen that is mostly blank. 

The large size characters also use the text screen. This means that (for 
example) if you print a normal size character at 2 vtab 1 htab, and then 
print a character in 8 chrsize also at 2 vtab I htab, GraForth will lose 
track of the first character even though the characters occupy different 
portions of the hi-res screen. This won't cause any problems unless you 
try to scroll or reprint the character. 

An amusing and enlightening effect can be created by going into text 
mode before running a program that uses character graphics. All char- 
acter blocks will be printed simply as groups of letters on the text screen. 
The following example runs the character graphics portion of the Gra- 
Forth demonstration program from text mode. If you've been following 
the above examples, you'll first need to clear the character editor from 
memory with forget X to prevent some word names from being dupli- 
cated. 

READ GRAPHICS2 " 
TEXT RUN 

Press reset when you want to exit; otherwise, the demo will continue. 

Another aspect of animated charaaer graphics worth exploring is 
color. The larger character sizes allow you to select color as characters 
are printed, but, as mentioned above, the slower speed can get in the 
way. The best method is to use the normal character display and design 
the color right into the character sets. This also means that intricate col- 



The Pizza Program 

Announcing the first dinner menu planning system. 
It will save you time and add new zest to your meals. 
It may even convince your wife buying an Apple* 
was a stroke of genius. 



ENDS HO-HUM DINNERS 

Are you tired of the same old 
thing for dinner? Would you like 
more variety in your evening 
meal? Is there something you'd 
rather have but don't get very 
often? The Pizza Program is 
designed just for you. It's a de- 
lightful new software package 
designed to end the dinner-blahs 
with computer generated menus. 
Here is how it works. 

You review wnat you like from 
the pre-selected food groups in 
the system. Delete any foods 
you don't enjoy. Add anything 
new at any time. Then decide 
how often you like to eat certain 
items. For example. Don't like 
liver? Then eliminate it with a few 
simple keystrokes. Or, you can 
plan for it as seldom as once every 
99 weeks or as often as daily. 

Want to go out to your favorite 
restaurant? Enter the restaurant's 
name as a "Main Course." Now 
your computer will automatically 
remind you to go out to eat— and 
as often as you select. It will de- 
lete all other items from that meal 
except the name of the restaurant. 

AUTOMATIC SHOPPING LIST 

You get a new menu each week 
or for just a few days if you want. 
And, it generates a detailed shop- 
ping list, automatically It can 
arrange each item on the list in 
sequence according to the aisles 
at your favorite store. Studies 
show a shopping list will discour- 
age impulse buying and save 
you money. 

Also, it generates a per serving 
calorie counter This is easy to 
delete anytime you are not in a 
diet mood or want to celebrate 
for any reason. You never count 
calories unless you want to. 

RANDOMLY DELICIOUS 

Say goodby to boring meals. 
Your computer will remember 
variety is the spice of life. This 
system makes eating at home a 
pleasure again. Each menu is 
randomly generated from major 
food groups according to the 
specific criteria you select. The 
system is easy to learn and easy 
to operate. Yet it is a sophisti- 
cated piece of software which will 
prevent menu mix-ups. 

It will add a new dimension to 
your home meals without increas- 
ing your food costs. It is rumored 
The Pizza Program may actually 
reduce the climbing divorce rate. 
Husbands now have something 
to look forward to for dinner 
Wives think it is terrific because 



it saves time and effort. And, kids 
love anything computerized. This 
is a useful and practical applica- 
tion you'll appreciate day after 
day, week after week. 

TRY IT FOR 30 DAYS 
WITHOUT RISK 

This tested system is guaran- 
teed to make your life easier and 
happier Our home trial lets you 
actually use The Pizza Program 
for a full 30 days before you de- 
cide to keep it. Watch the fun and 
convenience it creates. Enjoy 
better meals and see how much 
time it saves. If you are not satis- 
fied for any reason, return it 
within 1 month for a prompt and 
courteous refund. Your invest- 
ment is just $34.50 plus $2.00 for 
shipping and handling. (Califor- 
nia residents add 6V2% sales tax.) 
Full documentation is included. 

OUT OF THE RUT 

One housewife's reaction to 
this program is typical. She wrote, 
"Before using your system I found 
myself getting into a rut of serv- 
ing the same things over and over 
The Pizza Program has changed 
all of this for me. We now have a 
wider variety of dinners and best 
of all I don't have to decide what 
they will be. If this was all it did, 
I'd be thrilled. But it isn't. The 
shopping list I receive along with 
my menus has been such a time 
saver I quickly run through it 
and delete anything I feel I don't 
need and add something I might. 
I would have a hard time going 
back to doing my menus by hand." 

This system requires an Apple II 
Plus' with 48K and 1 disk drive.

or patterns can be used, rather than a single color. Using the GraForth 
character editor, you can select colors as you're creating the image, sub- 
ject to the usual color hmitations of the Apple. 

Pages 19 and 20 of the Apple II Reference Manual discuss the basics 
behind the Apple color limitations, and the Softalk column Assembly 
Lines explored the subject in depth recently. Let's take some time out 
here to look more closely at how the Apple stores pixels and keeps track 
of color in memory. Then we'll see how it affects character display in 
GraForth. 

The pixels in each horizontal row of the Apple screen are stored in 
memory in groups of seven, one group per byte of memory. A single bit 
in each byte determines what colors the pixels in the group can have. A 
byte can contain either green and violet pixels or orange and blue pixels. 
If for some reason the color bit is changed, then all of the pixels in that 
byte will change color. If any two adjacent pixels are plotted, their colors 
will combine to form white. A true white is always two pixels wide. 

Here's how to determine the color of an individual pixel If the color 
bit is set to one (orange and blue pixels), then a pixel will be orange if it is 
in an odd numbered column, and blue if in an even numbered column. If 
the color bit is cleared to zero (green and violet pixels), then a pixel in an 
odd column will be green, and a pixel in an even column will be violet. 
Thus the actual color of an individual pixel is determined by the setting 
of the color bit for the byte in memory the pixel occupies and the col- 
umn the pixel is plotted in. 

For most kinds of plotting, GraForth takes care of all of this for you. 
If you plot, for example, a green dot, GraForth will clear the color bit to 
zero, then check what column the dot is being plotted in. If the column is 
odd, GraForth will simply plot the pixel. If the column is even, Gra- 
Forth will automatically move the pixel one column to the right, since 
green dots cannot lie in even columns. In general, when a color is speci- 
fied, GraForth shifts the dots if necessary; if the color is set to white, the 
dots are always left in place. 

Let's try a few examples. If you haven't specified a color, GraForth 
will use white (i color, which has its high bit cleared to zero). Enter

Another dot plotted adjacent to it changes it to white.

A single dot in this column is green.

We're forcing this dot to be green. Since a green dot could not be 
plotted in an even column, GraForth moved it into column I. 

5 COLOR 
5 20 PLOT 

Surprise! Plotting an orange dot near the green dot changed the green 
dot to orange, too. Here's why: Since orange was specified, GraForth set 
the color bit for that byte to one. But the green dot occupies the same 
byte (the same group of seven pixels) and required the color bit to be zero 
to keep it green. When the color bit changed, the pixel then satisfied all 
the requirements of being orange, namely being in an odd column with 
the color bit set to one. 

Let's pull back from the digression on bytes and color and apply it to 
character graphics. The first revelation can be found by remembering 
that character shapes in GraForth are seven pixels wide by eight pixels 
tall. The character width of seven pixels hapjDens to coincide with the sev- 
en pixels per byte (with one color bit) discussed above. Therefore, each 
hi-res character is one byte wide and eight bytes tall, and each row of the 
character has its own color bit. 

Suppose that you've created and printed at the left a single character 
shape that is a solid green block. This means that the color bits for the 
character are zero and all of the odd columns (1, 3, 5) contain pixels. 
Suppose that the same shape is then printed one character space to the 
right. That means it will be offset by seven pixels from the original. The 
odd pixels (1, 3, 5) will now fall into even (1+7=8, 3+7=10, 5+7=12) 
columns, changing the green block to violet! Second revelation: colored 
character blocks change color when moved between even and odd col- 
umns. Actually, character blocks do not have a true color while in the 
character set. Color and color changes only become apparent when the 
blocks are plotted on the Apple screen. 

This brings us to the realization that if we want to keep the colors con- 
stant while moving horizontally across the screen, two sets of character 
shapes will be needed. They will be identical, except that one will be off- 
set by one pixel. One set will be used in even columns, the other in odd. 
As the blocks are moved one character space, or seven pixels, at a time, 
the one pixel offset in every other block will actually make the distance 
either six pixels or eight pixels. Even columns will stay even, and odd will 
stay odd. 

The pixel-shifter routine we used earlier can easily be used to create 
the other color images. Two things should be kept in mind First, since 
the character editor edits the images starting on an odd character col- 
umn (/ htab), then the colors will coincide with the editor when the block 
is printed on any odd column. Printing a colored character block on an 
even column will show colors reversed from those in the character edi- 
tor'. Second, when we created a shifted character image above, we needed 
a wider block to save it. The same is true for shifts of one pixel. The 
actual image must be at least one pixel narrower than the block it is 
saved in, to leave room for the one-pixel shift. 

Designing character sets and animating character blocks is, of course, 
a very new art. Questions of what looks best and how best to do some- 
thing are always subjective and depend on the particular application 
being written. We've tried to give you the tools you need for working 
confidently with GraForth's character graphics, and some ideas on 
smooth animation. 

Next month, we'll turn to the three-dimensional capabilities of Gra- 
Forth, showing how to create, save, and manipulate 3-D shapes. See 
you then. ^

BUY SOME TIME 

F0R$]69 



Time is money. You have a computer 
system because you know that it saves 
you money by simplifying procedures and 
reducing time normally involved in your 
work. Time is an important resource which 
should not be wasted. You are wasting 
valuable time if you ever wait for your 
printer. 

No waiting. Now with Microfazer by 
Quadram there is no more waiting. 

Microfazers are inexpensive universal 
printer buffers which any computer user 
cannot afford to be without. Any 
computer— any printer (or plotter!), 
whether parallel or serial. Microfazer 
receives information from the computer at 
ultra high speeds causing the computer to 
think the printer is printing just as fast as 
the computer can send. Microfazer holds 
the information until your printer can 
handle it, and then sends it on. 



More copies. Microfazer is equipped 
with a copy feature allowing additional 
copies of the buffered information— from 
one to as many as you want— with the 
mere press of a button. When you need 
your information repeated, for whatever 
reason, it's always right there— inside 
Microfazer 

Microfazer™ stacli. Microfazer can be 
stacked with popular modems or other 
peripherals. Some models can plug directly 
onto the back of your printer. Install it in 
less than 60 seconds, and choose the 
amount of buffer memory you need— 8K, 
16K, 32K, or 64K. One model even comes 
with up to 512K! You may use several 
Microfazers in series to create just what's 
right for you. Take data in from a serial 
computer and out to a parallel printer. Or - 



in from a parallel computer and out to a 
serial printer. Microfazer is just as flexible 
as you need it to be. 

Low price. Only $169 for 8Kof 
buffering, $189 (16K), $225 (32K) and v 
$299 for a full 64K. Serial-to-Parallel, 
Parallel-to-Serial and Serial-to-Serial

Last time we looked at the traps that are built into Applesoft and 
DOS to prevent a program from, for example, launching a space shuttle 
without loading the shuttle's landing instructions. We'll look now at 
error traps you can create and include in your own programs so that 
users who hit keys by mistake won't have to run your programs again or, 
worse yet, be required to reboot them. Error traps, at least those that are 
intended to trap simple errors of carelessness, are the mark of a pro. 
They're also just common courtesy toward your users. 

Error traps make sense in any program. Even if you expect to be the 
only user of your own programs, you'll be better off if you've at least de- 
vised ways of catching and correcting keyboard errors. This is twice as 
important, of course, if your output will be going to a chairman of the 
board who has no idea what break in nn means. 

To Trap or Not To Trap? The two extremes in error trapping are 
neglect and bludgeon. The first approach depends solely on Applesoft's 
error messages and lets any user with clumsy fingers be damned. The sec- 
ond uses Applesoft's error message cancellation routine for everything 
and begins every program wdth an "onerr goto" command. Neither ap- 
proach is likely to be appreciated by users of your programs. 

The best approach to error trapping is to figure out what errors your 
users are likely to make and devise appropriate methods of handling 
these errors if they should occur. Good error trapping should involve the 
minimum disruption in the running of a program. If a print-out is part of 
the program, you shouldn't allow your error trapping to mess it up. 

For certain potential errors, however, neglect may be the preferred 
solution. Suppose, for example, that your program attempts to load 
another program from disk. The most likely error a user could make that 
would affect this part of the program would be to insert the wrong disk 
or leave the wrong disk in the drive. Apple's DOS message "file not 
found" conveys the information very well in these instances. If there's no 
disk at all in the drive, the message "I/O error" is a bit more cryptic, but 
users soon realize that this always indicates a problem in reading from or 
writing to a disk. You may feel that anybody who leaves a drive door 
open or inserts the wrong disk not only deserves Apple's DOS messages 
but also deserves having to run your program again from the beginning. 

Disk Drive Dropouts. On the other hand, you might feel that it's on- 
ly common courtesy to have the program stop itself at that point and 
print a message such as "Insert correct disk. When ready, type return to 
continue," and then go on. Let's do it. First create a small .program so 
you have something to load. Type S^' 



NEW 

10 HOME 

20 PRINT "OH, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MORNING." 

Save the file under the name Morning. Now write your main pro- 
gram. 

NEW 

10 HOME 

20 INPUT "IS IT MORNING OR AFTERNOON? A$ 
30 IF A$ = "MORNING" THEN GOTO 50 
40 GOTO 60 

50 PRINT CHR$(4); "RUN MORNING" 
60 PRINT "IT'S A LOVELY AFTERNOON" 
70 END 

Save this one under the name Example, then run it to make sure it's 
entered correctly. You will have to load Example again if you answered 
"morning." 

By the way, this program accomplishes in one line something we used 
two instructions for last month. In last month's program, we put a DOS 
instruction inside an Applesoft program with the commands D$ = 
chr$(4) and print D$; ". . . ", which is more efficient than our new way, if 
you need to refer to DOS several times. However, both work. It's worth 
noting in passing that print " "; ". . ." also will work if you type control- 
D between the quotes when you enter the line. Unfortunately, you won't 
be able to read the control-D and may forget what was there later. 

You'll notice that this program has no error traps of any kind. If 
users type "night," or "yellow," or "hello," they'll still get the afternoon 
response. To correct that, add 

35 IF A$ <> "AFTERNOON" THEN GOTO 99 

99 PRINT "YOU GOOFED. START OVER": GOTO 20 

The addition of these two lines will take care of any incorrect 
response from the keyboard except a reset. Be sure to save again after 
making any changes. 

Suppose a user has inserted the wrong disk or none at all. To see 
what will happen, open the door to your drive after typing "morning" 
but before hitting return. You should get the message "I/O error break 
in 60." Although you should avoid the indiscriminate use of onerr, in this 
case it's the only thing that can save you from an I/O error without re- 
quiring that you rerun the entire program. So add the lines: 



262

NOVEMBER 1982 



50 ONERR GOTO 95 

55 PRINT CHR${4); "RUN MORNING" 

65 POKE 216,0 

95 INPUT "INSERT THE CORRECT DISK, THEN HIT RETURN. ";B$: 
GOTO 55 

Note that instead of putting a general onerr command at the begin- 
ning of the program, we've inserted it just before the line that could cause 
a DOS error. If the error occurs, a prompting message is printed, and the 
program stops and waits for the user to signal (by hitting return) that he 
has inserted the correct disk. 

The only reason for asking the user to signal when ready is to stop 
the program and provide time to insert the correct disk. Actually, hitting 
any sequence of keys followed by return will work. Since the variable B$ 
is never used again, it doesn't matter what value it has, and it doesn't 
seem worthwhile to put in a test to make sure that return is the only key 
hit. Return was chosen, of course, because it's the minimum necessary. 

Then the program goes back to line 60 and tries to load from the disk 
again. If there is a successful load, the program goes to hne 65, although 
the user is unaware of this. The command in line 65, poke 216,0, turns off 
the onerr command so that later errors in a long program won't also go 
back to line 60. Onerr is a powerful tool that should be used for specific 
errors and turned off when the possibility of those errors occurring is past. 

Coded Messages. Applesoft's error handUng can also distinguish be- 
tween several possible errors because, when an error is encountered, the 
code number of the error is stored in location 222. Applesoft's syntax 
error, for example, is number 16, while DOS's is 1 1. Thus, if you want to 
have separate error messages for different errors, you can. Let's make the 
following changes in our program. 



50 ONERR GOTO 80 
80 Z = PEEK (222) 
85 IF Z = 6 THEN GOTO 95 
87 IF Z <> 8 THEN GOTO 99 
90 INPUT "CLOSE THE DOOR, 
RETURN";B$:GOTO 55 



DUMMY. THEN HIT 



Error message 6 is "file not found," while message number 8 is "I/O 
error." The result is the same — another attempt to load Morning — but 
the messages are specific to the error. Try running the program now with 
the wrong disk, the door open, and so on. 

Now, replace the goto 55 in lines 90 and 95 with the command 
resume. When the error flag, set by onerr goto, is on and an error occurs, 
resume returns the program to the line in which the error occurred and 
tries again on the assumption that the user has corrected the error. Try 
running the program now with the wrong disk or the door open. 

Although resume is handy, it's not really recommended for general 
use. For one thing, you must make certain that your program branches 
around it if there's no error. If a running program reaches resume with- 
out encountering an error first, unpredictable things can happen, the 
most likely of which is a hung system. If there's an error in the error 
handling routine with resume, the program will go into an infinite loop. 

Another reason for caudon in the use of resume is that it's lazy pro- 
gramming. It lets you get by without anticipating the errors a user might 
make and deciding for yourself what you want the program to do when 
it encounters an error. The use of goto, on the other hand, directs the 
program exactly where you want it, and you remain in full control of it. 

Variable Resistance. The onerr goto command cancels Apple's 
built-in error messages, allowing you to substitute your own. It also lets 
you continue running from any point in the program you wish (presum- 
ably the point where the error occurred), but it does not cancel the error 
itself. Thus, as with any error message, the values of all variables are re- 
tained, but certain pointers and stacks are reset to zero. These include the 
internal counter used in for-next loops and the pointer that tells a sub- 
routine which gosub line to go back to when it finds return. Therefore, if 
you have an error in a loop or subroutine, you must restart the loop or 
the .subroutine. In other words, your error handling rourine must go to 
the line that contains the for or gosub command, not to the one contain- 
ing next or return. 

It's worthwhile to take a look at what happens to an error in a loop. 



Type new and then enter: 

10 HOME 

20 FOR I = 1 TO 3 

30 INPUT "TYPE A NUMBER "; X 

40 PRINT X 

50 NEXT I 

60 END 

As usual, run the program to make sure it's okay. Notice that the 
variable X in line 30 is numeric and not a string; it does not have a dollar 
sign and therefore cannot represent words or letters, only numbers. For 
the inputs, first enter 1, then 2, and 3. 

The next time around, enter 1, then Q or some other letter. You'll get 
the built-in input error handling response, ?reenter. If you enter a num- 
ber, say 2, the program will print this and then look for the third 
number. 

Suppose, for some reason, that you wanted to have the program sim- 
ply repeat "type a number" rather than ?reenter and wanted to use the 
onerr command to direct the program. There are three alternatives, none 
of which works satisfactorily. The first format is to go back to the for 
statement; the second is to return to somewhere within the loop, and the 
third is to go to the next I. Try all three with the line: 

25 ONERR GOTO 20 

and, after running the program, try making it goto 30 and then goto 
50. When you go back to the for in line 20, you start the loop all over 
again and have to reenter all data entered prior to the error. When you 
jump to next in line 50, the system hangs. When you go to your input line 
inside the loop, you end up with an infinite loop and can enter numbers 
forever without exiting it. 

Indexing the Loop. There is a way to have only three inputs before 
the end of the program and yet avoid the ?reenter message. That is to 
keep your own counter for the loop and to reset to the value of that 
counter after the error. It's really quite easy. Just make the following 
changes: 

15 N = 1 

20 FOR I = N TO 3 * 
23 N = I 

25 ONERR GOTO 20 
55 POKE 216,0 

Your counter in this case is the variable N. Run the program and 
you'll see that it will continue asking for input if you type a letter by mis- 
take. It will end after the third number it receives even if you enter sever- 
al letters in error first. 

Because Applesoft has ?reenter as an error handling routine already 
in ROM that does essentially the same thing as this method, you may 
never want to restart a loop in the middle after an input error. Neverthe- 
less, the technique may be useful for covering other error situations in 
which it would be disadvantageous to start the loop all over again. The 
basic trick is to set up your own counter, use that counter to initialize the 
loop, and, after an error, restart the loop at the value of your counter. 
From Applesoft's point of view, you are beginning the loop at the begin- 
ning again (that is, with for), so there's nothing wrong. As before, we've 
added the poke command to turn off the error flag when the particular 
error trapping routine is over, even though this precaution is unneces- 
sary in this short program. 

These are a few suggestions. Undoubtedly you'll come up with many 
more error traps. The specific techniques are not very important; in any 
program, there will usually be half a dozen methods of doing a job. What 
is important is to develop the habit of anticiparing ways that users can 
mess up your program while it's running and then to force them to cor- 
rect their errors in a manner that allows the program to continue where it 
left off. After all, if the only thing you want users of your programs to do 
after they make a mistake is to run them over again, you don't need any 
error traps. Applesoft will quit and print its own error messages, or it'll 
get hung up, or something. But it won't make you any friends and it'll 
probably create a few enemies.

Welcome back to Basicland. Before we 
plunge waist-deep into today's exciting episode, 
it's time to congratulate Arnold Bailey of New 
York State for his intrepid solution to our chal- 
lenge on two-byte reads from the console. For 
those who missed the last two cliffhangers, we 
wrapped up the discussion of nifty .console fea- 
tures by challenging you, the studio audience, to 
come up with a routine in Business Basic that 
allowed a program to tell the difference be- 
tween the enter and return keys. Last month a 
solution was furnished in this column, but be- 
cause of publishing lead times, it had to be sub- 
mitted before the challenge itself could be is- 
sued (maybe a better name for the column is 
Tomorrowland!). 

The published solution relied heavily on the 
desire to read one keystroke at a time and sam- 
ple each one, simulating the get statement in Ba- 
sic. Arnold took advantage of the fact that the 
console still terminates a read on an ASCII 13 
(which return and enter both generate) and cor- 
rectly identified that an input# statement was re- 
quired to correctly read both bytes. It was an 
excellent solution, and well documented (em- 
barrassingly well documented compared to the 
abbreviated listings we normally foist upon you 
in this column). For being first with a valid so- 
lution, Arnold wins a copy of Quickfile III and 
the thanks of a grateful nation. 

Sorting It All Out. One of the key ingredi- 
ents of most business and scientific programs 
that handle large amounts of data is the ability 
to arrange that data in an ordered sequence. 
"Arrange data in an ordered sequence" is, of 
course, a windy way of saying "sorting." There 
are as many sort techniques as there are people 
to think them up, but for the purposes of this 
column and its Christmas (December) cousin, 
we will stick to four or five fundamental meth- 
ods. Business Basic has several nifty features 
that make sorting more efficient, and the huge 
memory space makes it practical to sort large 
collections of strings or numbers in memory. 
For that reason, merging, the flip side of most 
sort techniques, will be covered only briefly in 
the December issue. For now we'll stick to in- 



Exploring Business Basic, Part 14 

memory sorts to illustrate the techniques. 

We're Forever Showing Bubbles. The most 
common sorting technique, and the one guar- 
anteed to show up in every elementary text- 
book, is the bubble sort. So named because of 
the technique of taking a value and shuffling 
(bubbling) it up to its proper place in the list, it 
depends on comparing each value to the one 
next door and exchanging them if the order is 
wrong. If you compare each element with its 
neighbor enough times, eventually the list will 
be sorted. For the purposes of the sample pro- 
gram, and all the rest of the programs in this se- 
ries, we will assume the desire is to sort the lists 
in ascending (lowest to highest) order. Let's 
plunge into the first example to illustrate how 
this works: 



10 REM sort using bubble technique 
20 REM n is number of elements 
30 REM sarray is the array to be sorted 
50 REM 

100 DIM sarray (1000) 

110 INPUT"Sort Routine. Number of 

elements to generate: ":a$ 
120 n = CONV(a$):IF n<2 THEN 200 
130 FOR i=1 TO n:sarray(i) = RND(1):NEXT 
135 PRINT"Start of Sort" 
140 GOSUB 1000 
150 PRINT"Sort complete. First 10 

elements are:" 
160 FOR i = 0 TO 10:PRINT 

sarray(i);" ";:NEXT 
170 PRINT:PRINT:GOTO 110 
200 END 
1000 top=n-1 
1010 madeswap=0 
1020 FOR i= 1 TO top 
1030 IF sarray(i)>sarray(i+1) THEN SWAP 

sarray(i),sarray(i + 1):madeswap= 1 
1040 NEXT i 
1050 IF madeswap THEN 

top=top- 1:G0T0 1010 
1071 RETURN 



This first program sorts a numeric array, re- 
arranging it in memory. For purposes of test- 
ing it, lines 1 10 through 140 ask for the number 
of elements to sort, load sarray with random 
values, and then call the subroutine at line 1000 



to perform the actual sort. After returning from 
the sort, lines 150 through 200 print out the first 
ten elements (just to demonstrate that the data 
is sorted) and end. Remember that this frame- 
work is deliberately simple, so we can concen- 
trate on the sort technique itself 

Line 1000 establishes the upper limit of our 
check for correct order and line 1010 estab- 
lishes a variable madeswap, which is a Hag we'll 
use later to determine if more sorting needs to 
be done. That leads us to the main routine in 
lines 1020 through 1040. Line 1030 scans each 
element and compares it to the next higher ele-

ment. It the first element is greater than the sec- 
ond, then the swap statement is used to ex- 
change them, and the madeswap flag is set to 
show that an exchange was made. Then the 
process repeats, with that next higher element 
compared with its next highest companion, un- 
til the top is reached. That's why top is set equal 
to the number of elements minus one. 

When a complete scan is made, line 1050 
checks to see if any swaps were made in the last 
pass. If there were none, then the array must be 
in order. If not, the array might not be in order, 
and it needs to be processed again until all pos- 
sible swaps have been made. Notice that hne 
1050 resets top, the limit of checking, since after 
each pass the smallest number found anywhere 
in the array will be forced to the top of the list 
(try it out if you don't believe it). This is some- 
thing that some versions of this routine miss, 
and it leads to a lot of unnecessary scanning. 
Notice also that we take advantage of the swap 
statement. Some Basics don't have this state- 
ment, and the result is that you have to assign 
one value to a temporary variable and do the re- 
assignments. This is a nuisance and also takes a 
lot of time, whereas swap is very fast. 

As long as things are being noted, it's prob- 
ably worth pointing out that this routine could 
be rewritten for descending order by rearrang- 
ing the sense of the if statement and having the 
search go from a varying bottom to a fixed top 
instead of the other way around. One last com- 
ment: Although this sort technique is the sim- 



plest, it is also the slowest, except for those 
situations where the list is very short or almost 
sorted already. Simple timing tests will con- 
vince you that the routine slows down nonli- 
nearly as the size increases. "Nonlinearly" 
means it goes from bad to awful without pass- 
ing through worse. 

Getting the Point. The routine below is 
another variation on the bubble theme, with 
one important exception. Sometimes it doesn't 
make sense to actually rearrange the data, but 
rather only to create a list that describes what 
the order would be if the data were physically 
sorted. For example, consider the following list 
(as it might have been read from a file): 

Record number Item 

1 Henry 

2 Bill 

3 Gloria 

4 Alphonse 

5 Gaston 

One way to sort this list is to simply arrange 
it in the following sequence: 

Alphonse, Bill, Gaston, Gloria, Henry 

That's ascending alphabetical order. How- 
ever, we could represent that same sequence by 
listing the record numbers: 

4 2 5 3 1 

Not only is this second representation more 
compact, it may actually represent less work to 
rearrange the record numbers than the actual

data itself. Such numbers are called pointers, 
since the value that is listed is just a pomter to 
the actual data location, not the data itself. If 
you want to construct the sorted list of names, it 
is easy to look them up using the record num- 
ber (pointer) list. Some languages and systems 
make a great deal out of this pointer concept. 
For now, we suggest that you use the technique 
wherever it makes sense from a performance, 
storage, and convenience standpoint. The fol- 
lowing example is an adaptation of the first pro- 
gram to incorporate this pointer sort technique:

130 FOR i=1 TO n:sarray(i) = RND(1)

135 PRINT'Start of Sort"

= 1 

1040 NEXT i 

1050 IF madeswap THEN 

top = top-1:GOTO 1010 
1060 RETURN 

Notice that we have introduced a new array 
in the program at line 1(X). Parray% contains the 
pointers to the actual locations in sarray that 
represent the sorted order. Notice in line 130 
that parray% is set initially to the sequence 1, 2, 
3 . . . , the same sequence as we find the data in 
sarray initially. However, since the pointer ar- 
ray contains only references to locations in the 
original array, it can be declared an integer ar- 
ray (maximum value 32,767) to save space. Hav- 
ing set up aU the values, the gosub to line 1000 
sorts the data, as in the first example; except 
that now, in line 1030, instead of testing the ac- 
tual sarray values directly, we use parray%(i) 
and parray%(i+ 1) as pointers to where the real 
data is. Once the comparisons are made, the 
pointers (not the values themselves) are 
physically exchanged. When the sort is fin- 
ished, the routine returns to hne 1 50 to print out 
the sorted data. The print statement in line 160 
illustrates how the pointer array is used to look 
up the correct sequence of values, even though 
they are actually scattered around within sarray. 

One of the interesfing possibilities of this 
technique is that it is possible to have more than 
one pointer array to a given data array. In that 
way, you could have an sarray that had asso- 
ciated with it a parrayup% and a parraydown% 
pointer array, so that listings and searches could 
be done in either order, depending on the pro-

gram requirements, without re-sorting. These are 
sometimes called indexes, and are very useful in 
many applications. More typically, pointer ar- 
rays are used in situations where the original ar- 
ray consists of string values, or fields within disk 
records. In that case, the economy of storage of 
an integer array is very valuable, and the 
pointers consist of actual disk record numbers, 
which are then easy to look up in any specified 
order. Next time we will consider some sort 
techniques and pointer arrays that are particu- 
larly suited to disk look-ups. These techniques 
are sometimes generalized under the heading of 
access methods. 

A Mild Speed Lift. All this is fine, but the 
original warning is still worth considering. Bub- 
ble sorts are simple and easy to understand, but 
they are painfully slow on any reasonable 
amount of data. The fundamental problem is 
that the algorithm requires lots of compari- 
sons, and even if the comparison indicates that 
the data needs to be moved, a move of one cell 
at a time is all that is possible. That means that 
for a small value to get from the top to the bot- 
tom on an ascending sort requires lots of ex- 
changes (one for each value in the array). One 
way to speed up this process is to make com- 
parisons across larger distances and thereby cut 
down the number of compares and exchanges 
necessary. A sorting algorithm called the Shell- 
Metzner sort accomplishes this. Usually called 
the Shell sort (which is appropriate considering 
its similarity to the shell game switching tech- 
nique), it depends on long-distance compari- 
sons and swaps to speed up the sorting process. 
For simplicity, we'll look at the Shell sort in 
standard form, without the additions for point- 
er sorting. A typical Shell sort routine looks like 
this: 



10 REM sort using Shell-Metzner technique 
20 REM n is number of elennents 
30 REM sarray is the array to be sorted 
50 REM 

100 DIM sarrray(IOOO)

120 n=CONV(a$):IF n<2 THEN 200 
130 FOR 1=1 TO n:sarray(i)=RND(1):NEXT 
135 PRINT-Start of Sort" 
140 GOSUB 1000 
150 PRINT"Sort complete. First 10 

elements are:" 
160 FOR 1= 1 TO 10:PRINT 

sarray(i)" ";:NEXT 
170 PRINT:PRINT:GOTO 1 10 
200 END 

1000 IF n<2 THEN RETURN 

1010 span=INT(n/2) 

1030 newspan = n-span -V 

1040 FOR i= 1 TO newspan 

1050 temp=i 

1060 upper=temp+span 

1070 IF sarray(temp;>sarray(upper) THEN 

SWAP sarray(temp),sarray(upper): 

temp=temp-span:IF temp > OTHEN 

1060 
1080 NEXT i 
1090 span=INT(span/2) 
1100 IF span THEN GOTO 1030:ELSE 

RETURN 

As you can see, the initial routine in lines 10 



through 200 is essentially the same as in the 
other routines. The subroutine in line 1000 im- 
plements the Shell algorithm, starting with a 
quick check in line 1000 that there is more than 
one element to be sorted. Once that is estab- 
lished, line 1010 divides the array into halves, 
and line 1030 establishes the center point 
around which swaps will be made. It would be a 
good idea to create a small array on paper and 
follow through on exactly how this routine 
works for your own satisfaction. Briefly, the 
newspan variable establishes a pivot point, with 
the loop in lines 1040 through 1080 facilitating 
comparisons and swaps between the upper and 
lower portions of this pivot point. After each 
swap, the range of search is narrowed by de- 
creasing the temp value in line 1070, and the 
process is repeated. After each major pass with 
a span value, line 1090 cuts the span value in 
half and repeats the process, until the span is 
one, at which point the array is sorted. Line 
1100 checks for that happy occurrence, and re- 
turns if it has come to pass. 

Several things are worthy of note in this rou- 
tine. First, the Shell sort will work faster on 
sorted data than unsorted data, and in nearly 
every unsorted case, it will outperform the bub- 
ble sort, dramatically so in cases above fifty to 
one hundred values. Also, this routine can easily 
be adapted to a pointer sort, using the tech- 
niques outlined in the second example above. 
String arrays can be sorted simply by replacing 
the numeric comparison in line 1070 with a 
string array compare. The swap statement 
works equally well with string and numeric 
data. 

Sort of a New Way To Sort. The preced- 
ing algorithms are fairly standard and safe and 
will reliably sort any kind of data. Sometimes in 
application programs we are more fortunate 
and can have special knowledge of what kind of 
data we are sorting. This allows for special tech- 
niques which are faster than any general-pur- 
pose routine could be. Although the Apple III is 
one of the fastest personal computers around, 
it's not exactly a Cray I, so it often pays to be 
able to use special tricks. Imagine a situation 
where there are lots of records to sort, but there 
are only a few unique values among all the rec- 
ords. One classic example is sorting mailing ad- 
dress records on the basis of the value of the 
state field. Obviously, there may be thousands 
of records to sort, but there are only fifty pos- 
sible states, each typically represented as a two- 
character code. There are many other exam- 
ples, but that is one that is easy to imagine. 

The following program generates random 
string values and then lets you test the prac- 
ticality of a sort technique based on a concept 
called an inverted list. Inverted lists are a fa- 
vorite topic among access method and data- 
base experts, but the same principles can apply 
to sorts. Basically, an inverted list is not an up- 
side-down version of a regular list, as you might 
expect from the title. Rather, you can think of it 
as a list of all the unique values in another list, 
with sublists that contain the record numbers of 
all the records sharing the same field value. In 
our example, if we had the following situation:

Then the inverted list of this data would look

The two representations contain the same 
information, but in a considerably different 



form. Note also that the mverted list is assem- 
bled in ascending alphabetical order. That's not 
necessary to the example, but once the unique 
values are established, it is generally easy to sort 
them. This is especially true if the number of 
unique values is much smaller than the total 
number of values. The following program lets you 
generate random string arrays, with up to a 
thousand values, and then pick a group of col- 
umns on which to sort. Try it initially by sort- 
ing only on the first column. This will guar- 
antee that there are only twenty-six unique 
values (since the routine generates only upper- 
case letters), no matter how many strings you 
generate. First, the main routine:

Lines 10 and 20 set up a lot of values that 
will be used later, while line 30 sets up the main 
string array, arrayS, and the array that will con- 
tain unique values, valueS. After prompting for 
the number of strings and the size of each string, 
lines 60 through 90 build the string array by 
randomly creating character strings composed 
of upper-case ASCII characters. Line 100 prints 
out the created array, and line 130 requests the 
columns on which to sort. Unless you create 
very few strings, it is best to sort on only one 
column, since the unique combinations possi- 
ble in sets of more than one column are prob- 
ably too great for the routine to work properly. 
Note that in a controlled (nonrandom) set, like 
the states, this might not be a problem. 

In any case, once the columns are chosen, 
lines 132 and 133 initialize values and prepare 
for the main sort loop in lines 140 through 170. 
Note that for each record (rec%) to be sorted, 
the variable itemS contains the value extracted 
from the main record that will become the sort 
key for that record. The routine at line 2000, 
which we will examine shortly, adds the current 
value to the list of unique elements if necessary 
and inserts its record number in the general list. 
The subroutine at line 3000 then orders the 
unique value list, creates the sorted pointer list 
in sarray%, and returns to lines 196 through 220 
to print the list on demand and start the proc- 
ess over, if desired. 

Let's look now at the routine that creates 
and adds to the inverted list:

2040 startval%(x)=rec% 
■ 2050 endval%(x)=rec% 

2060 RETURN 

This routine makes good use of the INSTR 
function to search a string called sortvalS. Sort- 
val$ contains all the unique values, separated by 
the ASCII value 0. This means that the unique 
values can easily be identified, assuming that 
none of the values contain an ASCII 0 them- 
selves. Once INSTR either finds or doesn't find 
the itemS value in sortvalS the rest of the rou- 
tine is set into motion. In the case that itemS al- 
ready exists in sortvalS, line 2010 updates the 
pntr% array by putting the current record num- 
ber into the space reserved for the last record 
number in the list of that unique value. That is, 
endval% is an array that remembers the index in 
pntr% of the last occurrence of any particular 
unique value. That means that the next occur- 
rence of that value gets automatically put into 
the location in endval% that matches the start 
location of the value in sortvalS. This is an- 
other good one to try on paper until you get a 
feel for how it works. Assuming that the value 
was found, the routine's work is finished for 
now, and it returns to look at the next value. 

If the item was not found in sortvalS, that 
means it is a new, unique value. Line 2020 gets 
the next possible location for storing the new 



value, and line 2025 checks to see if there is 
room for the value. You could probably come 
up with something more friendly than the stop 
statement to solve the problem. In any case, if 
there is room, line 2030 adds the value to the 
sortvalS string, with the zeroS spacer, and lines 
2040 and 2050 establish start and end locations 
for this new value and then return to get the 
next record. 

This process continues until all the records 
are examined and all unique values are added to 
sortvalS and their beginning and ending point- 
ers are established in the appropriate arrays. At 
this point pntr% contains a linked bst for each 
unique value of sortvalS, with the starting point 
of the list pointed to by the appropriate ele- 
ment of startval% and the end point defined by 
a zero in the location pointed to by endval%. 
Now the fun begins. Having assembled the list 
of pointers to all values, it is necessary to sort 
the unique values themselves into the appro- 
priate order and then assemble the individual 
linked lists into a total sorted list. The routine to 
break out the unique values and sort them looks 
like this: 

3000 sorWal$ = MID$(sortval$,2) 

3002 FOR n= 1 TO 255 

3005 x=INSTR(sortval$,zero$) 

3010 IF x = 0 THEN 3050 

301 5 value$(n) = LEFT$(sortval$,x- 1 ) 

3020 sortval$ = MID$(sortval$,x+ 1) 

3025 NEXT n 

3050 value$(n)=sorWal$ 

3055 last= 1 

3060 FOR 1= 1 TO n 

3070 FOR i = last TO 255 



3080 IF startval%(j)<>0 THEN spointer% 

(i) = startval%(j):GOTO 3100 
3090 NEXT j 

3095 PRINT"ERROR, startval not found": 

STOP 
3100 last=j+1 
3110 NEXT! 
3120 GOSUB 4000 

Lines 3000 through 3050 scan the sortvalS 
array and break out each value into a separate 
element of valueS for ease of look-up and sort- 
ing later. It relies on zeroS as a delimiter be- 
tween values in sortvalS. One note here may 
make things clearer. The whole reason why 
sortvalS was used instead of going with a string 
array for the values was because INSTR is an 
infinitely (nearly) faster way of searching for a 
given string value than a for-next loop plowing 
through values, and since that operation has to 
be done for each record, speeding up the search 
was a critical issue. In any case, once valueS is 
built, a corresponding list of the start values for 
each string is built in spointer% by lines 3055 
through 3110. This leaves us with a Hst of the 
actual values and the beginning values of the 
linked list for each. Now all that remains is to 
sort the values themselves and rearrange the 
spointer% list to match. That's done in the sub- 
routine at line 4000: 

4000 IF n<2 THEN RETURN 

4010 span=INT(n/2) 

4020 newspan=n-span 

4031 FOR 1= 1 TO newspan 

4040 temp=i 

4050 upper=temp+span 




$ HORSERACING $ 




The KEL-CO SYSTEM, developed by Dr. A.S. Kelsey, Professor of Matfiematics, and Mike Cox, an expert in horse race handicapping, has been 
available separately for Thoroughbred and Harness racing since the late 1960's and has increased in popularity as the technical presentation of 
it has improved. 

The in depth analysis of 10,000 races for each of Thoroughbred and Harness racing was conducted to determine which measurable variables 
were most predictive and which of the intangibles could be organized into a workable form. 

CANNELLA SALES CORP. NOW INTRODUCES TWO KEL-CO SOFTWARE PACKAGES FOR ANALYSING 

THOROUGHBRED AND HARNESS HORSES! 

THE PROGRAMS 

Because of Computer technology, a novice need only learn how to interpret the racing papers (clear instructions included) to operate these 
programs. You'll enjoy becoming a Railbird! 



THOROUGHBRED PROGRAM (RS-5): Horses' ratings reflect 
True Class levels. The Program takes into account the levels of 
racing at all North American racetracks so that ratings always 
remain consistent; Fitness of the horse is also a major element 
brought out in the analysis. Ratings may then be adjusted in 
consideration of factors like Distance, Weight, Surface etc. 



TROT PROGRAM {RS-6): Horses' ratings are derived through the 
mathematical links among Speed, Finishes, Post Positions and Track 
Lengths. Adjustments are then made for Current Form, Class 
Changes, Driver Changes etc. This method can be used at any 
Harness racetrack for which normal past performance data is avail- 
able. 



INPUT/OUTPUT - The Programs operate on the basis of prompts where the user responds with material from the racing papers, and in some 
cases personal judgement. 

Results may be produced one horse at a time or for complete races; horses are rated, ranked and qualified on a list (screen copy or hard copy). 
Wagering guidelines for Straight-Win, Place, Show and Combination Bets, eg. Daily Doubles, Exactas - are given in the Programs. These rules 
are applied in accordance with the horses' ratings and qualifications.

That's right, campers, it's our old friend 
(well, not that old) the Shell sort. The only 
change is that we are sorting string data, and in 
addition to swapping the string values, we swap 
the spointer% values as well. The important 
thing here is that even though we may have 
processed thousands of records, we only have to 
sort the unique values among them. As long as 
we have lots more records than unique values, 
this routine will save significant amounts of 
time. Anyway, to finish up, once the values are 
sorted, we can assemble the whole list of record 
pointers by following the start values in the 
spointer% array and loading all the elements of 
the linked lists in the new order. That will finish 
the subroutine, and it looks like this: 



3130 
3140 
3150 
3160 



3190 
3200 



k=0 

FOR 1=1 TO n 

index=spointer%(i) 

k=k+ 1:sarray%(k) = index:IF 

pntr%(index) <>0 THEN 

index=pntr%(index):GOTO 3160 

NEXT i 

RETURN 



Notice that each linked list starts with an in- 
dex in spointer% and ends when the value in 
pntr% is zero. By assembling the lists one by one 
in the sorted sequence determined by spointer% 
we guarantee that the whole list is in order. 

Glancing way back up to the original main 
program, you can see that lines 196 through 220 
can now take the sarray% list as a pointer list in- 
to the original records and print out that list in 
order. 

It's hard to believe that the original bubble 
sort program in the beginning of this tome can 
be so short and so simple and yet take the long- 
est to execute, while the last program, which 
seems so complicated and so long, can do cer- 
tain types of sorts at least a hundred times 
faster. Many times it's not how much code is in 
the program, but how many times it must be 
executed, that really makes the performance dif- 
ference. For that reason, in sorting as well as 
any other activity, it really pays to examine your 
loops and repetitive code and to think of the 
best algorithms possible. Remember, too, that 
the last program is useful only if there are only a 
few unique values, and the safest bet in the gen- 
eral case is the Shell sort. 

Next time we will take up some other inter- 
esting sort techniques, including an improved 
Shell sort called the Quick sort and a complete- 
ly different sort called the Binary Tree sort. The 
Binary sort, like the inverted list sort discussed 
in this article, can also be the basis for an access 
method. In fact, Apple Ill's Record Processing 
Service package uses a modified version of this 
algorithm. We hope to get the chance to get in- 
to those techniques as well. Until then, don't get 
out of sorts! )| 



STRIKE IT RICH! 

First there came the forty-niners. Then came Sam Spade. San Fran- 
cisco attracts all types. Now the Apple world is gathering there for a long 
awaited gold rush. 

San Francisco is a stone's throw from Cupertino and Silicon Gulch. 
Can you imagine a better place to hold an Applefest? 

Well, we can't, and that's why Softalk Publishing will be present 
November 18-21 in full force. 

If you're one of the lucky ones attending this show, drop by our 
booth. Loads of goodies are available for the asking. 

And we'll have Assembly Lines: The Book, by Roger Wagner, for 
sale. We'll also have samples of Softdisk, a monthly magazine on disk, 
available for $3. 

Copies of BasiCalc, an easy-to-use spreadsheet program, will be 
available for $8. You can also pick up a copy of The Jeppson Disas- 
sembler for the Apple III. The boot disk is $8. You can get both the 
boot disk and the data disk for $1 1. 

San Francisco is getting ready for one heck of a good Applefest and 
so are we at Softalk. Friendly fun and publishing magazines are what 
Softalk is all about. 

Come by our booth and see what we mean.

pie, Jake went home to his warehouse to 
take a break and watch the Wild, Wild 
West on TV. 

The two men were right next door to 
Jake working on a toilet seat heater when 
they heard a window-shaking, bone-jar- 
ring growl. At first they thought it was 
just the neighbor's Chihuahua, but it was 
coming from Jake's warehouse. They 
went next door to find Jake lying on his 
Persian rug grasping his stomach. The 
men quickly deduced that he was hun- 
gry, but the problem was what to feed 
him. They decided to try feeding him sili- 
con chips, microprocessors, wires, 
printed circuit boards, and some other 
odds and ends. Jake happily wolfed 
down the goods. 

They kept Jake on this diet for sever- 
al days and also followed him on his 
usual route. One day on his route, they 
found a box with a keyboard on it. They 
picked it up and found several others on 
Jake's trail. 

When they arrived at their lab, they 
hooked it up to a TV set. It looked like a 
computer! It worked like a computer! It 
smelled like a computer! It was a 
computer! 

They rejoiced and went to tell Jake 
about their great find. When they ar- 
rived, they were amazed at all the com- 
puters lying around Jake's house. When 
they put two and two together, they real- 
ized that Jake was somehow reprocess- 
ing the odds and ends into computers. 

"So," they said to each other, "these 
must be horse Apples!" 

They all played Ring Around the 
Rosie and went into partnership selling 
Apple computers. Jake and those two ge- 
niuses are now making money together; 
occasionally the men feed Jake some 
higher quality parts and higher technol- 
ogy to make the Apple II, Apple II Plus, 
and the Apple III. 

And that is how the Apple computer 
got its name. (Besides, did you ever hear 
of a horse kumquat!?) 
When Samuel Swersky of Rockville, Mary- 
land, sent in his entry for Softalk's Etymology 
contest, he warned us, "IVIy entry for the Kum- 
quat contest is so good it really won't be worth 
your while to read any others. Though I've al- 
ready received six-figure prepublication offers 
from such other journals as the National Mid- 
night Star and the National Enquirer, I will 
probably mail it to you guys. So, get ready to 
fork over the loot." 

Well, we received Swersky's entry, Simon's 
Song, and it was long. Really long. This sucker 
came in bound volumes. We are not talking 
short story. Simon's Song made the finals be- 



cause of its sociopolitical color and internation- 
al intrigue and was a favorite of many of those 
at the Kumquatorium. In this sampling, "Si- 
mon" refers to Simon Applebaum, the protag- 
onist of the epic and the man to whom Swersky 
tells us we owe so much: 
Postscript: 

But though thousands now key in their 

programs. 
And some are addicted to Zork, 
If it weren't for Simon Applebaum, 
We'd all be watching Mindy and Mork. 
The Also-Rans. Well, that's it for the final- 
ists. Here are some other entries that merit men- 
tion and a giggle or two. 

Douglas Titchenal of Columbus, Ohio, tried 
to con us into picking his as the winning entry. 
His song, sung to the tune of Groucho Marx's 
Hello! I Must Be Going, ends thus: 

A is for abilities far-reaching. P is for 
potential yet untried. P again, this fime 
for size and setup — corripact, efficient, 
yet personalized. L is for the fine com- 
mand of language. E for rating — excel- 
lent overall! Put them all together they 
spell Apple, and from its tree 100 bucks 
will fall! 

Goodbye, Douglas, you must be going. 

Jean Coulombre from North Quincy, Mas- 
sachusetts, is our computer widow of the 
month. While her husband tapped away at the 
keyboard, he challenged her to enter the con- 
test. Of course, Jean would have none of this 
"$100 in advertisers' goods" tomfoolery. If she 
had won, her husband would have selected the 
Videx Videoterm. Jean wanted $100 worth of 
new clothes, "and I want them now!" Come on, 
Mr. Coulombre, give her a break. Looks like 
you lost twice this month. 

Some contestants added visual touches to 
their poems. Stephen Heywood (Framingham, 
MA), Ben Moore (Carpinteria, CA), and John 
D. Redfield (Forth Smith, AR) are credited for 
their hi-res verse and added artistry. Eleven- 
year-old Clint Wilson (Olathe, KS) sent us a 
hand-drawn computer with his story on the 
screen and the story's hero, Harold the Worm, 
wearing a cap with tassel at the keyboard. These 
entries are now on display in the Softalk 
Museum. 

The also-rans will receive kumquats for 
their efforts. Be sure to contact us before stop- 
ping by to pick up your prize. 

Be True to Your School. In the school- 
house division, it was East versus West for the 
title of National Educational Kumquat Cham- 
pion. In this corner, from the East, weighing in 
at nineteen double-spaced pages on the green 
and white computer paper, from Farrell, Penn- 
sylvania, is the entire Farrell School District. 
And their opponent, representing the West, 
from the hometown of Apple Computer itself, 
Cupertino, California, weighing in at half of a 
double-spaced page and one-half hand-written 



page, are two fourth-graders from Faria School. 

The match-up never even got to the first 
round because the Farrell District was using en- 
trants in grades from elementary through high 
school. So, each school will reign as its respec- 
tive regional champion. 

From Faria, Martha Fulton's fourth-grade 
class was represented in the boys' division by 
Sam Chi. Here's his story: 

Why they named it Apple? I think be- 
cause it looks good and it's fresh, and al- 
most everybody likes apples, and it's 
shiny, and it tastes good. I think that's 
why they called it Apple Computer. 
Representing the girls is Kelly L. McCon- 
nell, and here's her version: 

I think that the people that work with 
computers didn't want to have any of the 
other fruits like banana computer or 
orange computer. I think that "banana" 
computer sounds gushy, and "orange" 
computer sounds bumpy, but I think 
"Apple" computer sounds shiny, like 
when you first get a new computer it's 
really shiny. "Apple" computer also 
sounds very bright like when you turn on 
an Apple computer. Apple computer al- 
so sounds very strong like when you bite 
into an apple it is very hard. So why not a 
name that's shiny, bright, and strong, like 
an apple, for a great new computer. 
These are some of the many reasons why 
I think Apple Computer got its name. 
Look out, Kelly; Chiat/Day, Apple's ad- 
vertising agency, may be giving you a call with a 
job offer. 

Over on the East Coast, Farrell really 
wanted the prize badly. Under the command of 
computer instructor Donna DeBonis, Farrell 
barraged us with more than fifteen entries. 
Leading the assauH were the sibling troops of 
Frank, Gabriel, Michael, and Mina (two en- 
tries) Gargiulo. 

But the best entry from the Farrell group 
was an atypical Adam-and-Eve story whose ap- 
proach and style departed from other entries 
starring the Bible's first humans. Anita Shaw 
was the author of the masterpiece; but when we 
talked to the folks at Farrell, we discovered that 
Anita is the school nurse. We should have 
known that from her prize selection: 

"If I win, I don't want a meager $1(X) worth 
of software. I want an enfire Apple II system, 
complete with a printer. Disk II drive, a color 
CRT, and a selection of database management 
software programs. And I want it now!" 

Let's Get Personal. And, finally, here's a 
letter we received, written on personalized sta- 
tionery, that sums it all up: 
Dear Mr. Kumquats: 

I would appreciate the chance to set 
the record straight. Surely Woz and Jobs 
selected "Apple" because the name de- 
notes dignity, strength of character, grace 
under pressure, unusual intellectual ca- 
pacity, sensitivity to the downtrodden, 
comfort in the company of the powerful, 
and humble, unassuming ways. 

Sincerely, Cass Apple, Atherton, CA

When most people think of Minnesota they remember the bone- 
crushing Viicings's defense, or the migration of the Lakers, or Rod 
Carew, who came to fame with the Twins. Very few realize that Minne- 
sota, especially Minneapolis, is quite active in the world of computers. 
Sports is big there, but computers might be bigger. 

The home of Control Data (whose Plato is finding its way onto 
Apples), Honeywell, and Cray Research, Minneapolis seemed Hke a logi- 
cal location for holding an Applefest. It's not quite Chicago, but it's 
closer than Boise, Idaho, Columbus, Missouri, or Gary, Indiana. 

Mid-September was too early to go ice-fishing, a major winter 
pastime in Minnesota, and the Vikings were on strike along with the rest

of the National Football League. The Twins were in last place. In short, 
there wasn't much else to do in Minneapolis that weekend. Barring any 
unpleasant surprises, the timing seemed perfect. 

The big surprise at the Minneapolis Applefest was that it was also the 
Twin Cities Computer Show. Running one on one with Apple exhibi- 
tors were the likes of Radio Shack Computer Centers, Datamark Busi- 
ness Systems, Northwestern BeU, and CompuScribe. Total attendance 
for the four-day show exceeded all estimates, but there were still grum- 
bles from exhibitors who expected an exclusively Apple affair. 

Big surprises behind us, at Minneapolis there was little of the excite- 
ment and panache that have characterized the previous Applefests in 
Boston. Exhibitor turnout was noticeably light. The West Coast was rep- 
resented by only a handful of companies; R.H. Electronics, Cameo Elec- 
tronics, Syntauri, Passport Designs, and Orange Micro were about it. 
The East Coast pulled a little better, while the majority of exhibitors orig- 
inated from the Midwest, mainly Ilhnois and the Minneapolis area. 

Despite the poor showing overall, this Applefest was successful on 
other levels. Local exhibitors added a new flavor to the show not always 
found in such computer-conscious environments as San Francisco. The 
pace was slower and the stakes smaller. Exhibitors and attendees 
achieved greater communication than in larger, more competitive af- 
fairs. 

Perhaps it was the Midwest and its residents' reputation for being 
straightforward, hard-working, and honest. Without a doubt, the aver- 
age attendee at this fair was serious about computers and not afraid to 
ask questions. Even those who didn't own a computer seemed like they 
sincerely planned to get one. 

Business programs and peripherals were in abundance, while there 
was only a smattering of games. Hardware highlights were provided by 



Micro Display Systems (Hastings, MN), with its generic full-page dis- 
play monitor called the Genius, and Cameo Electronics's new Winches- 
ter hard disk with a removable cartridge. Rhino Robots (Champaign, 
IL) drew quite a crowd around their booth all four days. Their pick-and- 
place tabletop robot arm, called theXR-1, is meant for educational and 
research applications. 

Dayton's, a top-of-the-line department store chain in the Midwest, 
had an impressive booth, punctuated with ten-foot-tall gray monoliths. 
Selling systems and software, Dayton's Computer Centers dramatically 
demonstrate the possibility of offering more than just computer games in 
big department stores. 

A generous spirit was displayed by some of the exhibitors. North- 
western Bell gave away cigarette lighters embossed with their slogan 
"The Knowledge Business." Softalk gave away InvisiTabs. R.H. Elec- 
tronics held a drawing for nine top prizes. All nine winners in the R.H. 
contest came from the Minneapolis/Saint Paul area, including small 
towns like Chaska, Burnsville, and Maple Grove. 

Minnesota is a major agricultural state and the concerns of farmers 
were addressed by Countryside Data, a farm software distributor. More 
than one educator gathered under the bright yellow banner of Banana 
Educational Software and discussed the present and future of learning 
with Apples. 

When all was said and done, the Minneapolis Applefest was enjoy- 
able because the pressure was off. It was a long four days, but it had 
none of the madness of the West Coast Computer Faire or the National 
Computer Conference. Minneapolis will be remembered for sophisti- 
cated attendees and their irrepressible curiosity about Apples. Plenty of 
money passed hands and yet Mammon paled next to the gods of com- 
puting. 31

s o i: T A I 




Let's continue last month's sector-reading experiments and write a 
useful utility that sorts catalogs by file type and puts available file slots 
where you want them. We'll actually be writing data to a disk this time, 
so make some back-up copies of a disk that's seen lots of action (load- 
ing, saving, deleting, and so on) and join the fun! 

A Quick Review. A disk's catalog is stored on track 17, with seven 
file names in each 256-byte sector of that track. The first seven file names 
are in sector 15, the second seven in sector 14, and so on, down to sector 
1 . The first eleven bytes of each sector are wasted, with the exception of 
bytes 2 and 3, which point to the next sector of the catalog. The last 245 
bytes of each sector contain seven thirty-character file names and five 
bytes of file information, with thirty-five bytes allotted per file. Got it? If 
not, then goto October. 

The objective of this month's utility is to regroup the files on a disk 
by file type (B, A, I, and T). We also want to group deleted file names 
(which remain in a catalog until overwritten) so that we can predict 
where the next file names written to the disk will appear. Running the 
Bait Sort program reads track 17 of the disk in the drive sector by sector, 
prints a sorted catalog on the screen, and then lets you decide whether to 
"permanently" write the changed catalog to disk. 

Armed with the techniques outlined here, you should be able to ex- 
pand the program so that it can alphabetize files and do all sorts of in- 
teresting things. For now, we'll leave alphabetizing to someone else's col- 
ums (SortTalk?). 

Here's the program; have at it.

If you don't care how the program works, no problem; just type it, 
save it, and run it with an expendable disk in your drive. If you want to 
learn a few things, however, read along. . . . 

The Bait Sort Rundown. Line 100 contains the string fileS, which de- 
termines the order of our sort. FileS must contain only the letters B, A, I, 
T, and D, standing for Binary, Applesoft, Integer, Text, and Deleted. 
Each letter must appear only once and must fall in the order that we 
want our catalog's file names to appear. Lines 120 through 140 proof- 
read fileS for us. 

Line 1 50 sets the array F$( ) according to the file-type codes predeter- 
mined by DOS. This string array will be used in our dummy print-out of 
the sorted catalog. Remember, byte 3 of each file's thirty-five bytes says 
what file type it is: 



0 = Text 

1 = Integer 

2 = Applesoft 
4 = Binary 



If the particular file is locked, the value 128 is added to these values. 
Since the code 3 is unused, we've used that number to look for deleted 
files. DOS actually designates deleted files by a 255 in a file's first byte. 

Line 160 pokes a couple of default zeros into the Input /Output Con- 
trol Block. Poke 47083,0 accepts any volume number. Poke 4 7091 .0 tells 
the program to read each sector in its entirety. Other numbers in this 
block (locations 47080 to 47096) will be poked soon. Stand by. . . . 

Line 170 pokes in our little machine language jump to DOS's RWTS 
(Read-Write-Track-Sector) routine at location 768 ($300): 



280 



NOVEMBER 1982 



300- 20 E3 03 JSR $03E3 
303- 4C D9 03 JMP $03D9 

Just think of this as computer code for "Go read from or write to a 
disk." From Basic, call 768 is the trigger. 

Data Duplication. Line 180 determines where in memory to store the 
data to be sorted. For sorting purposes, we'll store two copies of the cata- 
log, so two sets of locations are chosen: sector 15's 256 bytes will be read 
from the disk and stored first at location 10000 or Ll( 15), and then at lo- 
cation 20000 or L2(15). Sector 14 will be stored twice, 256 bytes higher, 
and so on, continuing through sector 1. 

Line 190 sets the pointer telling RWTS to read the disk rather than 
write to the disk. Be careful; a 2 poked into 47092 in this program line 
would probably ruin your disk (not to mention your day). 

Line 210 starts the loop that reads our fifteen sectors. A 17 is poked 
into location 47084, designating track 17. This poke could have been 
done prior to the loop, by the way. Each sector number (SEC) is poked 
into 47085. Lines 220 and 230 first tell RWTS where to store data. For 
poking purposes, Ll$( ) and L2$( ) need to be broken into two bytes 
each, high and low order. Call 768 triggers the reading of sector SEC. 

Now our sort search begins. We'll look for each file type in the first 
storage area, Ll(15) through Ll(l), and store each file name found and 
its accompanying data in the second storage area, L2(15) through L2(l). 
Every file name on the disk must be accounted for (once only!) in order 
for our sort to be successful. Line 250 starts our sort search by setting the 
number of files (NF) and number of sectors (NS) counters to zero — tidy, 
but not really necessary since they haven't been used yet. 

The variable LOC in line 260 holds the location of the byte where the 
next piece of found data will be stored. LOC is increased by one after 
each poke in line 360 and by eleven after each sector is full in line 400. 

Line 280 starts the actual search through the five types of files. The 
value of the variable type tells the program what value to look for in the 
third byte of each file.

Line 290 starts a search loop on sector 15 and counts down to sector 
1 . Line 300 finds the first byte of each file's thirty-five bytes, then line 310 
checks to see if that byte is a zero. If it is, that means that the file slot has 
never been used, so there won't be any more file names following. The 
program will quit looking and go to the beginning to look for the next 
file type (next N). 

Line 320 looks at byte 3 (X-l-2) and subtracts 128 from it if the file is 
locked. Locks is the lock code that will be used in our dummy catalog 
print-out. 

Line 330 looks for deleted files, which always have the value 255 
stored in byte 1. 

Line 340 looks for R, S, and other odd file types and stops the pro- 
gram if they are found. We're avoiding these rare file types mainly be- 
cause doing so makes this program much simpler to explain. Include 
them if you want. Unlocked S files have a value of eight in byte 3. R files 
use a sixteen. 

Line 350 checks for the correct file type and skips to the end of the 
loop (line 410) if it's not found. If we have successfully located a file, line 
360 copies the file's thirty-five bytes to location LOC and consecutive 
bytes. 

Lines 370 and 380 print the file locked code, file type, and sector 
numbers for our dummy catalog. Then line 390 pokes the file's name 
(bytes 4 through 33) onto the bottom line of the screen, or into memory 
locations 2007 through 2036. This line could read: 

390 VTAB 24: HTAB 7: FOR A=X+3 TO X+32: PRINT 
CHR$(PEEK(A));: NEXT: PRINT 

except that the program would then be unable to print non-normal 
(flashing, inverse, and control) characters. Finally, line 400 counts found 
file names. On every seventh name, we must jump eleven characters to al- 
low for the eleven bytes at the beginning of each new sector. Lines 410 
and 420 complete the loops. 

No More Fooling Around. Line 430 makes sure we like what we see 
on the screen. So far, we've only played around in memory. You can fool 
with the program and debug it to your fingers' desire up to this point, but 
now things get dangerous! 

We are about to (fanfare?) write to the disk! If there are any mistakes 
in this program code other than errors that halt execution, it's almost 
guaranteed that lines 450 through 490 will render the files on your disk 
inaccessible (although the disk itself can be reinitialized). So use a disk 
you didn't really like anyway, fearlessly run the program, and answer 
"Y" to the query in line 430. 

The next few lines set the parameters for the RWTS routine. Line 450 
pokes a big 2 into location 47092, telling RWTS to write instead of read, 
and line 460 starts the write loop. Then line 470 pokes the track and sec- 
tor values into 47084 and 47085, the same as line 210 back when we were 
reading the disk. Finally, line 480 tells RWTS where in memory to get 
the data that will be written to the disk. 

Line 500 is the moment of truth. 

There you have it. The deleted files that had a "<DEL>" printed 
next to them in the dummy catalog won't show when you actually cata- 
log the disk, of course, even though they are there. Deleted file names are 
significant, however, because the next file saved, bsaved, or written to the 
disk will appear in the slot occupied by the first deleted file name (or at 
the bottom of the catalog if there are no deleted files). If you put deleted 
fik names, for example, right after your Applesoft file names, your next 
saved file name will appear, logically, at the bottom of that group. If you 
want, you can piit a loop in the program that will insert as many deleted 
file names as you want into your new catalog. Just make the program re- 
peat the same deleted file name several times. Or store a bunch of dum- 
my file names on the disk and then delete them before running Bait Sort, 
like so: 

10 FOR FILE=1 TO 25: PRINT CHR$(4); "OPEN FILE ";FILE 
20 PRINT CHR$(4); "CLOSE": NEXT 

30 FOR FILE=1 TO 25: PRINT CHR$(4); "DELETE FILE ";FILE 
40 NEXT 



That's all for now.

While there is certainly a wide range of printers to choose from, there 
may be even a bigger selection of printer interface boards for the Apple. 
The March installment of this column described how these boards work 
and evaluated most of the products that were available at that time. Since 
then, quite a few additional devices have emerged, many of which pro- 
vide a lot more features than just a connection between printer and 
computer. 

PKASO Printer Interface. The PKASO printer interface boards 
from Interactive Structures provide comprehensive text and graphics ca- 
pabilities for most popular printers. The on-board firmware allows nu- 
merous printer operation and formatting commands. Figure 1 lists many 
of these commands. 

As you can see, all the standard Apple-convention commands, such 
as control-I 80 N to set the line length to eighty characters, are available. 
Some of the other commands merit explanation as well. 

The B command allows you to send any ASCII character to the 
printer by entering its equivalent decimal value. This capability is used by 
several of the printer mode commands (see figure 2). For text and graph- 
ics screen dumps, several options can be selected, including size, polar- 
ity, screen, and so on. These options are controlled by the number pre- 
ceding the command character and may be combined for various ef- 
fects. Thus, a rotated print of hi-res screen 2 could be generated by typ- 
ing control-I 9 H. The 9 is derived by adding the value for screen 2(1) 
and the value for the rotate command (8). 

The F command is a simple way of setting the font size for printers 
that support multiple fonts. In the PKASO board we tested, which was 
intended for use with the NEC 8023A and C. Itoh 8510 printers, there

Sets character font to fit n columns within an eight- 



were also commands that enabled the user to select the normal and 
double size proportionally spaced fonts. 

Control-I M is a lead-in to another series of commands that control 
the printer mode. These commands vary according to which printer ver- 
sion of the card you have. Figure 2 lists the commands for the 
NEC/C. Itoh printers. 

Some of the commands hsted in figure 2 must be followed by one or 
more parameters. These parameters can be sent with the control-I B 
function. For example, the vertical line spacing can be set to 16/144-inch 
by means of the command sequence control-I M T control-I 16 B. 

Besides being able to do hi-res graphics dumps, the PKASO board 
can produce lo-res pictures. In this mode, the board produces sixteen 
shades of gray — one for each of the lo-res colors. Since some of the Ap- 
ple's colors have the same brightness level, a bit of translation is required 
to produce the distinct gray scale. While the end result may look differ- 
ent from what is seen on the screen, it can be quite pleasing when viewed 
from a distance. 

Figure 3 shows how a hi-res picture with sixteen gray levels can con- 
vey more information than a normal hi-res picture. If you find this hard 
to believe, consider the television picture you're accustomed to looking 
at. The horizontal resolution of a black-and-white television picture is 
not that much greater than the Apple's 280 pixels. One reason the televi- 
sion picture looks so much better is that it has a continuous gray scale 
(equivalent to more than two hundred discrete levels between white and 
black) that carries a significant portion of the information you take in 
when viewing a single frame. When color and real-time moving images 
are added, you can begin to appreciate how much further computer 
graphics must progress in order to match the quality of film or television. 

Another unique feature of the PKASO board is the abihty to print 
special characters. Loading a small driver routine and character set 
makes possible the embedding of special symbols, subscripts, superscripts, 
and so on within ordinary text. These special characters are printed in the 
same way ordinary text is printed; thus, they can be accessed by your 
favorite word processor with little trouble. A copyright symbol, for 
example, might be produced by typing control-I 1 S 5 control-I S. In this

or L will appear in the lower right comer of the screen. This is a nonde- 
structive display; anything that was previously on the screen in that loca- 
tion will be replaced when the printer condition is remedied. 

The printer must be on and ready to print whenever the Pascal or 
CP/M ofjerating system is booted. When the board is operating in these 
systems, the lead-in character automatically defaults to control-Y since 
control-I is used as the tab command. Another useful feature of the sys- 
tem is the capability to set strobe polarity and to enable interrupt-driven 
operation from machine language. This information is supplied in a well- 
written and produced owner's manual. 

All in all, the PKASO board is a very powerful interface for your 
printer. There are only two aspects of the board that could cause trou- 
ble. One is that the graphics dump command formats are unique to this 
board. Most graphics boards have conformed to the format used by the 
Grappler from Orange Micro. These commands, such as control-I G D I R 
to print out a graphics screen double wide, inverted, and rotated, are a 
little easier to remember. Because this format has become somewhat of a 
standard, programs designed to interface with graphics boards may have 
to be modified to work with the PKASO. 

The other possible drawback to the PKASO board is that several 
common functions, such as page length control (when to skip over page 
perforations) and high order bit control, are not provided. These func- 
tions are not often used and may be provided external to the interface 
board (for instance, from a word processor); therefore, in light of the 
many positive features of the PKASO, it is a very good buy at $165. This 
price includes a cable and a utility disk containing sample pictures. 

PKASO ID12 Color Printer Interface. The PKASO ID12 interface 
provides all of the functions we've just been talking about plus some ad- 
ditional commands that can be used to control the color printing capa- 
bilities of the Prism printer from Integral Data Systems. This printer uses 
a four-color ribbon to create color print-outs. Any color (yellow, magen- 
ta, cyan, or black) can be selected manually with the control-I n R com- 
mand. Each of the Apple's lo-res and hi-res colors can be produced by 
using a combination of ribbons (see figure 4), or you can let the firm- 
ware dump full-color print-outs of the graphics screen automatically. 

Mixed colors are printed by making several passes of the printhead 
across the paper. The lightest color is printed first. Then the vertical po- 
sition of the ribbon is changed to expose the next color. Another pass is 
made, placing a dot of the new color over the previous one. To avoid 
contamination, colors are always printed starting with the lightest color 
ribbon. Contamination happens when the second color is printed direct- 
ly over a previous dot. As the ribbon contacts the paper, a small amount 
of ink from the first color can get transferred back onto the ribbon (of 
the wrong color). Obviously, it's much better to get a little yellow ink on 
the black portion of the ribbon than vice versa. The PKASO board also 
has a special Mosaic mode that reduces this problem even further. More 
on that later. 

Notice in figure 4 that the board prints black for white and white for 
black. This arrangement is similar to the way other graphics dumps swap 
the two to prolong ribbon life. This also corresponds more naturally to 
the video picture, even though the background on the screen is black as 
opposed to the white background of paper. With a simple command, the 
true black and white can be restored. For lo-res graphics dumps, two 
other color schemes are possible. Besides the equivalent-color represen- 
tation, a set of spectrum colors or sixteen levels of a single color can be 
selected. This is shown in figure 5.

Figure 5. Printing of Apple's lo-res colors. 



For large print-outs of low resolution, it is possible to "paint" pic- 
tures from a sixty-four— color palette that the PKASO board can man- 
age for you. Each color pixel consists of a 6 by 5 matrix of dots. The way 
to produce any color in the palette is specified by a four-byte definition. 
This allows each color to be specified by an eight-level degree of satura- 
tion in each of the four ribbon colors. That's more than four thousand 
possible colors (although many would be indistinguishable from one 
another). 

To deal with the contamination problem mentioned earlier, the 
PKASO board has the special Mosaic mode. Instead of being printed on 
top of each other, different color dots are mixed by being placed very 
close to each other. To produce an area of a given color mixture, the area 
is filled with dots in the proper proportion to achieve the desired shade. 
The Mosaic mode uses exactly the number of dots needed to fill the 



space, and no two dots are ever printed on top of one another. 

Another advantage of the Mosaic mode is that fewer dots are print- 
ed and therefore less ink is used. This can as much as double ribbon life 
(no small matter considering the price of the four-color ribbon). Al- 
though the Mosaic mode produces pictures with a more pronounced dot 
pattern, it is not objectionable when viewed from a distance. In fact, if 
you look closely enough at any printed picture or at a color television 
screen you'll see the same thing. 

Another feature is the reduced color option. This is useful when 
printing graphs and charts. When this option is selected, any isolated 
dots will be printed in black instead of color. This can also be helpful in 
overcoming some of the shortcomings of the Apple's color video gen- 
eration scheme. 

As if all this were not enough, the PKASO ID 12 has one more ma- 
jor function — the Super-Res Color Graphics System. This system aids in 
the generation of images that are much too complex even to be dis- 
played on the Apple screen. It allows full access to the color graphics ca- 
pabilities of the Prism printer — namely, horizontal and vertical resolu- 
tion of eighty-four dots per inch. The Super-Res system uses a 4K-byte 
buffer in memory to construct one line of the printed output (that is, a 7- 
dot high by 1 ,024-dot wide by four-color deep buffer). This buffer is first 
set up with the proper data (using plot and clear commands) for each of 
the four colors. Then the buffer is printed out, in four passes, to create 
one line of the finished picture. The buffer is then repeatedly set up and 
printed until the entire image has been created. 

A software driver routine available on disk will interface the IDI2 
with the Apple Ill's SOS. 

Skyman 2001 Printer Interface. The Skyman interface from Nutek 
International is a little different from the other interface boards. To be- 
gin with, it must be installed in slot 1 ; it won't work in any other slot! Al- 
though this is quite an uncommon requirement for this type of board, it 
really makes little difference since almost all Apples have their printer in- 
terface installed in slot 1 . Another rarity is the use of several dip switches 
to select what type of printer is being used. Currently, graphics dumps

are available only for Epson and Centronics printers. 

With the exception of the control-I, N, and K commands, all the 
Skyman functions are accessed through a unique set of codes. Most of 
these begin with a special escape character that defaults to control-W. 
This escape character can only be changed by poking. Figure 6 shows the 
other available commands. 

Although dumping graphics is certainly one of Skyman's major fea- 
tures, its rather cryptic command format leaves something to be desired. 
It also suffers from compatibility problems with graphics software. On 
the other hand. Skyman offers one more graphics feature. This feature is 
made possible by Skyman's graphics logical register, which allows logi- 
cal and, or, and exclusive-or operations to be performed between the two 
graphics screens. One example of how this might be used would be the 
creation of a composite picture from two separate images. The back- 
ground could be loaded into one hi-res screen while the foreground 
image was placed in the other. The and operation would print the com- 
posite image of the foreground and background (for those purists among 
you: sorry, hidden lines don't count!). A special overlay function is also 
provided to enhance this effect; this places a two-dot wide border around 
the foreground image. Other functions of the graphics logical register are 
to select normal versus inverted images and to change colors into a gray 
scale representation. 

Although this board works with Pascal and CP/M, it has a few 
quirks. For example, it must be initialized from Basic before booting 
either operating system. The Skyman 2001 Parallel Printer Interface sells 
for $169 including cable and demonstration disk. While it has some im- 
pressive capabilities, its several limitations should be taken into account 
by those who are considering it. 

MPC AP-80 and AP-SIO. MPC Peripherals Corporation offers two 
low-cost interface boards for the Apple — the AP-80 parallel and AP-SIO 
serial interfaces. The AP-80 is almost a clone of the Apple parallel print- 
er interface. It has the same jumper configuration block to set strobe and 
acknowledge polarities and offers a limited number of commands due to 



its small 256 byte PROM. It's not fancy; it offers no graphics or text for- 
matting features. But then it doesn't present any compatibility problems 
either. The best part is the price — $89.50, including cable.

[1-4], vertical magnification [1-3], and so on). 

The parameters n3 through n7 are optional and 
allow partial screen dumps. They specify the starting 
dot position, ending dot position, starting line number, 
ending line number, and left margin position, 
respectively.

The AP-SIO provides the Apple with a serial communications port. 
This can be used to drive printers, plotters, modems, external terminals, 
and so on. Any device using the RS-232 standard can be connected to the 
AP-SIO for one-way or two-way communication with the Apple. This 
board features fourteen switch-selectable baud rates from 50 to 19,200 
and provides for hardware handshaicing. Another handy feature is the 
Serial Protocol Block. This is a small IC header that configures all of the 
connections to the DB-25 connector. Thus it is possible to swap input 
and output data lines or to select the proper handshaking signals with- 
out taking apart the interface cable. 

There is a limited amount of firmware provided that allows the card 
to be accessed with PR# and IN# commands. The card will also func- 
tion with Pascal and CP/M. It does not have a terminal mode the way 
the Apple's communications card does, so when the AP-SIO is used to 
connect a modem, a separate terminal program must be employed. 
There are four options that the firmware does support. These are lower 
to upper case translation, delay after carriage return, line feed after car- 
riage return, and Apple video echo. Each of these options defaults to a 
value selected by dip switches but can be altered from software. The price 
of the AP-SIO is $129.50. 

Intra Computer PSIO. The Programmable Serial In /Out board from 
Intra Computer provides both RS-232 and current loop operation. One 
possible use for this card would be for connection to the Telex/ TWX 
network. The design of the board allows direct connection to the net- 
work in most cases; some installations may still require a Telex Line 
Adapter, however. Other features of the PSIO's current loop operation 
are active or passive modes, nonpolarized connections, and automatic 
dialing on the Telex/TWX networks. Of course, either the EIA (RS-232) 
or current loop interface could be used to connect a printer or other se- 
rial device. 

On-board firmware connects the board from Basic, Pascal, CP/M, 
and so on, but no other commands are offered. Data format, baud rate, 
line width, and auto line feeds can be set by means of pokes or from ma- 
chine language. One unique feature provided by the firmware is auto- 
matic baud rate selection. This allows the PSIO automatically to detect 
the speed of the incoming data and to adjust itself for the proper rate. In- 
terrupt-driven operation is also possible with the appropriate machine 
language programming. 

The documentation provided with the PSIO is fairly comprehensive 
and comes in a three-ring binder. A complete hardware description and 
ROM listing are included. One of the sample programs provided shows 
how the Apple can emulate a Baudot Teletype machine. 

Practical Peripherals Serial MicrobufTer II. The Microbuffer II 
was described fully in the March column. At that time, Practical Periph- 
erals had only a parallel interface card for the Apple. The Serial Micro- 
buffer is designed to offer the same features (up to 32K bytes of buffer- 
ing and extensive text formatting commands) to those people who own 
serial printers. Graphics dumps are not available, however. 

Note also that the Serial Microbuffer is a printer interface board 
only; it is not meant for duplex operation with devices such as modems. 
For this reason, the command structure is identical to the parallel Mi- 
crobuffer. These boards support numerous text formatting commands, 
most of which were described in the earlier article. Since our initial re- 
views, the Microbuffer firmware has undergone several revisions, in- 
cluding the addition of some new commands. Figure 7 is not a complete 
description of all the Microbuffer commands; it is only a summary of the 
new ones. 

Another change in this board is the default lead-in character used in 
Pascal and CP/M. This has been changed from control-Y to control-Q. 
The new character makes it possible to send commands directly to the 
card from the keyboard. This is accomplished by using the Filer Trans- 
fer command and specifying CONSOLE: to PRINTER:. The Serial Mi- 
crobuffer II sells for the same price as the parallel versions — $259 with 
16K buffer, $299 with 32K. A little expensive, but well worth it! 

Prometheus Graphitti Card. This board is another Grappler look- 
alike. It uses the same command structure but includes a double hi-res 
dump (page 1 and page 2 printed contiguously). It also has two jumper 
plugs for selecting strobe and acknowledge polarities. 



Another improvement has been made in the graphics dump routine 
that allows pictures to be printed in approximately the same aspect ratio 
as they appear on the Apple's screen. Most other graphics cards print a 
dot-for-dot representation of the hi-res screen. The space between verti- 
cal dots on most printers is not the same as the space between horizontal 
dots, however. For example, an Epson prints sixty dots per inch hori- 
zontally and seventy-two dots per inch vertically. Thus when a graphics 
dump is made of a circle on the Apple screen, it usually comes out look- 
ing like an ellipse. The Graphitti firmware has a special routine that in- 
terpolates extra points throughout the picture to compensate for these 
discrepancies. The result is an image on paper that has the same propor- 
tions as the original picture. Another fine point of the Graphitti card is 
its price — only $125.

Versacard. Like other multifunction cards, this board combines four 
functions onto one board using phantom slot addressing. This means 
that while the board may physically be in slot 2, the parallel port may be 
assigned to appear as if it were in slot 1 . Before getting the idea that this 
will free some extra slots in your Apple, note that you cannot place 
another board into a phantomed slot (Z-80 type boards excepted). The 
serial port always appears in the physical Versacard slot and the clock 
and BSR devices always share the same slot. 

The parallel port can be configured for either polarity of strobe and 
acknowledge signals. Aside from the control-I n N command to set line 
length, all of the other commands use a nonstandard format. These in- 
clude enable/disable line feed, turn on/off video display, automatic pag- 
ing, and high-order bit control. The Versacard now also performs graph- 
ics dumps in a similar fashion to the way the Graphitti card does. 

The serial port handles all popular baud rates, data formats, and so 
on and has hardware handshaking. The firmware supports the same 
commands as for the parallel port. A terminal mode is also available for 
using the Versacard with a modem. In the terminal mode, you can tog- 
gle the printer on and off with a control-P, select half or full duplex with 
control-D, send a software break via control-B, or exit the terminal mode 
with a control-R. 

The clock/ calendar is set up to emulate a Thunderclock Plus. On- 
board batteries keep the clock running when the computer is off. Seven 
different formats for the clock data are available depending on the exact 
command used to read the clock. For example, in response to these Ap- 
plesoft commands: 

IN#n 

INPUT "%"; T$ 
the variable T$ will be assigned a string in the form of 

SAT FEB 09 10:23:55 PM. 

The clock can also generate interrupts at one of three frequencies: 1,024 
per second, I per second, or 1 per minute. The interrupt rate is selected 
by a small jumper on the board. 

The BSR X-10 wireless AC control interface is also designed to emu- 
late the Thunderclock Plus. An optional ultrasonic transducer must be 
connected to the Versacard and placed near a BSR command console. 
The Apple can then control those appliances that are connected to the 
BSR system by sending ultrasonic signals to the command console. Up 
to sixteen devices can be controlled including variable brightness on the 
lamp modules. A time and event scheduler program is now available to 
set up an automated system for controlling these devices. 

The Versacard packs a lot of power onto one peripheral card. It 
suffers from some of the same drawbacks as other multifunction cards 
(see the May 1982 Hardtalk) but is still a bargain at $199. 

Other Changes. Some of the other boards have been improving al- 
so. For example, the Grappler board we looked at in March has since 
been renamed the Grappler-I-. This board now has graphics routines for 
all of the printers on one EPROM. Thus the board can be configured for 
any printer by moving a few dip switches instead of removing and swap- 
ping EPROM chips. It also adds dual hi-res graphics with a side-by-side 
print-out of both screens. 

It seems safe to say that this is not the last word on printer interfaces. 
As newer and better printers are announced, along with continually 
dropping prices, more and more Apple owners will be buying printers. 
This creates a great demand for interface boards ranging from the sim- 
plest, bare-bones parallel port to full-featured graphics boards with buff- 
ering. You should have little difficulty finding a board to suit your needs 
and budget. l '

Saves you from creative speling 



No matter how good your 
Apple's word processor, the 
user is human. So, the odds are 
that spelling mistakes will 
occur in almost every letter, 
document, or proposal. Many 
errors will be caused by those 
who never won a spelling-bee 
and are addicted to 'creative' 
spelling. . .while others will be 
due to keystroke 'typos'. Either 
way, spelling errors can be em- 
barrassing to you — to your 
image — to your business. 

DIC-TIO-NARY 
solves the spelling 
problem for you, 
and does it at com- 
puter speed, easily 
and almost effort- 
lessly. How easily, 
how effortlessly? 
Well, with DIC- 
TIO-NARY you 
have the option to 
correct a word 
immediately . . . 

right at the time you're doing the spelling check. No 
waiting necessary. And if, by chance, you don't know 
the correct spelling of the word, you can go into the 
wordbook right then and there and have it displayed for 
you! (Ask for these features on competitive programs, 
no matter their price, and see how fast they change the 
subject.) We think you'll find that for helpfulness our 
DIC-TIO-NARY is on par with having your favorite 
English teacher or even Mr. Webster at your elbow! 

words, words, words 

The DIC-TIO-NARY starts you off with more words 
than you'll probably ever need: 25,000 of the words used 
most often. Plus it lets you add 3000 words of your own 
choosing, so you can customize it to your specific 
needs. (By making back-up "wordbooks" you could 
have many additional lists of 3000 words!) 

how it works 

In simplest form, the DIC-TIO-NARY races through 
your document at a 2+ page-per-minute speed. It looks 
at every word in your text. At the same time it compares 
each word with those in its 28,000 wordbook . . . checking 
for any misspelling. When it catches a goof, you get to 
see the word as it was used in your text, on the screen. 
The DIC-TIO-NARY then asks how you want that par- 
ticular word handled. 




choices, choices 

The DIC-TIO-NARY will dis- 
play for you any word not listed 
in its wordbook and any mis- 
spelled word. It then offers you 
a choice of word-editing op- 
tions. For example: You may 
decide to ignore the word. You 
may have it marked in your text 
and /or on the printout, for later 
identification, correction or 
replacement. You may have the 
word automatically added to 
your wordbook. Or, you may 
immediately correct the spell- 
ing (using the 
wordbook for ver- 
ification, if de- 
sired) . . . and all 
occurrences of 
that word will 
automatically be 
corrected through- 
out your text, keep- 
ing the original 
capitalizations or 
lower case letters! 



extras, extras 

For ease of use, for efficiency and true proofreading 
effectiveness the DIC-TIO-NARY provides you with 
many other useful goodies. You may add or delete in- 
dividual words from the wordbook ... or do the same 
with an entire list of words. You may have any portion 
of the wordbook listed, and may search it even while 
processing documents. When you add it up, you'll find 
you can't get our total combination of features in any 
other spelling program at any price. 

All in all our DIC-TIO-NARY may well be the most 
valuable and useful program since the little red school- 
house disappeared. Yet, you can enjoy all its benefits 
for only $99.95. If you buy our special Screen Writer 
Professional, you get the $129.95 SCREEN WRITER II 
word processor described on the left, plus The DIC-TIO- 
NARY, at the package price of $199.95. Be creative! Save 
$29.95! 

DIC-TIO-NARY works with Screen Writer II, Super- 
Scribe II, Apple Pie and Apple Writer. Requires 48K 
Apple II or 11+ with DOS 3.3. Available at your local

Who 
Hii Mind 



At 12:45 p.m. Harlan's head fell off, for the 
last time. He had lost his head before; it had 
teetered and tottered, it had rolled away; but 
it had always returned. Snapped back into 
place. Home for lunch, as it were. 

Not this time. It was gone for good. Spht, missing, 
inescapably off; to be forgotten. After all, it did have a 
mind of its own. The only problem was that it was 
Harlan's mind too, and he was going to miss it. 

He shrugged his three shoulders. Not really three 
shoulders, but that's what it looked like he had. Three 
shoulders to cry on if his head ever came back. 

His nerves began to panic. It was over, the deed 
was done. Scared, headless, alone, what had he done? 
He had been of two minds lately; had the conflict been 
too much? At least it had been a clean break, he 
thought. 

He thought? Wait a minute, what was he thinking 
with? He thought again. He was still on his feet, his 
pulse rushing as thoughts poured from some- 
where into the nowhere of his mind. He couldn't see, 
hear, or speak, but he was thinking. How could that 
be, he thought. (A dizzying, wonderful feeling, to be 
able to think on one's feet without benefit of a brain.) 

A phantom head. That's what it had to be. Of 
course. The last scrambled dreams, desires, and con-

volutions of the body in the few seconds after the final plug is pulled. A 
few sputtering, smokeless moments of brilliant clarity courtesy of the 
central nervous system. 

People around him were pointing, he realized. Horse laughs, blank 
stares, incredulous gasping. They were seeing it and it was unbelievable, 
despite the first-hand proof It could really happen. Nobody had any 
idea what was going on inside the man, but from the outside nothing had 
really changed. He just didn't have a head. He must have had one just a 
minute ago, but nobody could say what it looked like, so what was the 
difference? 

Lots of people are loose in the world without a brain in their bodies. 
Harlan took his mind off the crowd and walked away. 

He thought he might be using his precious last moments, and he 
didn't want to waste them on idle speculation. Ease up, think quiet 
thoughts, keep the juice running low. He could actually live like this, he 
thought. For how long, he couldn't guess. 

A three-shoulder goon, that's what he felt like. A hulking, headless, 
hamfisted guy, the type who grabbed at life — no pleases or thank-yous — 
and never thought for a moment there was any other way. He was one of 
them now. With only his fingers to do the talking. 

He had upset his delicate mental process for the last time and lost his 
head over it. He slowly scrolled over the last few years: all the movies, 
magazines, television, and computers he had slowly given his mind over 
to. He had forfeited his imagination to technology and he had paid the 
price. Detachment. Of the final, ultimate kind. 

He smiled. 

He smiled? With what? Well, he thought he smiled. A thin, ironic 
smile snaked across what he remembered of his lips. Robbed, that's how 
he felt. Robbed of himself, by himself, for the good of himself. In the 
name of progress. Even for the good of mankind. A funny, flimsy Hne of 
reasoning. Fitting that it matched the negligent style of the crime. 

A deep sigh somehow filled his lungs with air. Nourishment flooded 
his veins; he wasn't hungry anymore. A good sign. He was learning to 
take care of himself. 

Beep. 

Bolstered by that small fact, he chanced a speculation. There was a 



NOVEMBER 1982 



time when it was natural for him to ponder deep meanings, weigh alter- 
natives, consider moves, articulate all his choices, then make them 
smoothly. Like everybody, he cried through the rough spots and laughed 
when things went easy. Without a clear head and with four senses less to 
connect him to the outside world, could he ever hope to do all this again? 

Getting his hopes up, that's what he was doing. A noble and fine 
thing to do, even possible without really thinking. Perfect for a headless 
person. 

Beep. 

There was plenty to hope about. 

Somewhere a computer booted a program with Harlan's name on it. 
All by itself. 

He hoped he would live a long life and never go hungry. Whirrr. He 
hoped for friends and lovers to share his dreams with. Clackity clack. He 
hoped for inspiration to fuel his ambitions. Hummm. 

Up and running, the program sealed itself in its disk drive and locked 
its power switch on. This was one disk that was never going to crash. 

Beep. He heard it again. Beep. 

Harlan feh a tingling, then a chill, as he realized what was happen- 
ing. A network of personal computers was booting inside his phantom 
mind. Giving him hope. His new head was suddenly a collision of charts, 
bars, mazes, treasure rooms, and dancing graphics. Endless menus to 
choose from, ever-expanding subroutines, all the ROM space he could 
ever hope to use. Words in process, access to files, calls via modem. 
Powerful stuff. All of it — crunch! rumble! collide! — shooting straight 
through him. 

He was connected to the invisible world of the microcomputer. He 
was one of them somehow. 

Harlan was overjoyed. It was more than a headless person could 
have hoped for. 

Beep. 

Somewhere another computer booted. Whirrrr. Its cursor glowed 
with impish perversity. Clackity clack. A buffer dumped out some gar- 
bage across its monitor screen. Hummm. It looked like. . . . 

Yes. 

It looked like it was smiling.

You haveni lived until youve died in space. 

And here's your chance. 
Software author Peter Folkos has created 
Alien Ambush, a space age nightmare. It's a hi-res, 
full-color arcade game, fiendishly written to give 
those nasty aliens every advantage. 

So if you have access to a 48K Apple* with 
DOS 3.3 or a 16K Atari 400/800** with a disk 
drive, and you're hot for some new thrills, Alien 
Ambush was written for you. But be warned: it just 
got a lot tougher to survive in space.

NOVEMBER 1982 



Softalk Presents Tlie Bestsellers 



September was the best of times for the folks from VisiCorp, but Oc- 
tober brought a bag of mixed blessings. VisiCalc, the company's bell- 
wether program, regained the lead as the bestselling piece of software in 
the two largest software markets in September. And a special promotion 
started October off strongly for the industry leader. But the announce- 
ment that one of their former employees was in strong competition with 
them didn't augur well for the future. 

In the Apple market, VisiCalc regained the lead from Broderbund's 
Chopiifter after running second for three months. The lead is decisive, 
but it's not an indication that Choplifter's about ready to fold up its tent 
and steal away into the night. Dan Gorlin's hostage scenario was so 
strong that the Softalk convention of applying an index rating of ap- 
proximately one hundred was applied to the third rated program. Chop- 
lifter was far ahead of third-place Personal Filing System. 

VisiCalc had also fallen temporarily on hard times in the IBM mar- 
ket, where it was displaced in August by WordStar. But the pioneer 
spreadsheet resurged in that market as well to regain the lead. 

Then came October. VisiCorp unveiled a new marketing plan — buy

the Top Thirty came from one publisher and, interestingly enough, each 
of the programs has a different author, which indicates breadth as well as 
talent in the Broderbund stable. 

Although new packages are entering the market on an almost daily 
basis, it's notable that there's not one new product on the Top Thirty 
other than Seafox. Other programs that are listed as new to the list this 
month actually are regaining the Top Thirty from prior months. These 
include VisiFile, Super-Text 40-56-70, and Zoom Grafix. It was a pretty 
ho-hum month at the top.

Trend/VisiPlot, VisiFile, and VisiSchedule and all was looking reason- 
ably rosy, even with the advent of Microsoft's MultiPlan into the Apple 
market as a spreadsheet competitor. 

But along came Mitch Kapor, now president of Lotus Develop- 
ment, author of VisiTrend/ VisiPlot, and formerly a VisiCorp product 
manager, with the announcement of 1-2-3 for the IBM. The product is a 
combination spreadsheet, text processor, and database that bids fair to 
give VisiCorp a run for its money. Everyone takes aim at the champs. 

Alas for the Apple II market, it's not likely ever to get a chance at 
1-2-3. The program requires at least 128K of RAM and Lotus recom- 
mends 256K to achieve maximum performance. That clearly leaves the 
Apple III as a viable machine for the product, however. 

September saw an increase in software sales, but most game publish- 
ers would be hard pressed to vouchsafe that fact. In a sea of essentially 
undifferentiated arcade and hi-res adventure games, few titles were able 
to rise above the average. The result was that the greater sales were 
spread more evenly over a larger number of titles. 

An exception to that rule was Broderbund product, which consis- 
tently outperformed the rest. Not only did Chopiifter have an iron grip 
on second, TTie Arqade Machine rose from a tie for twenty-seventh to 
eighth. Serpentine rose from twenty-sixth to a tie for twelfth. Star Blazer 
fell from eleventh to a tie for nineteenth, but the newest Broderbund en- 
try, Seafox, jumped into twenty-seventh. That means that one-sixth of

1985 WAS NOT A VERY GOOD YEAR. 

THE RUSSIANS INVADED GERMANY, 

STORMED THE PERSIAN GULF, 
lit ATTACKED NORVWAY, AND 
OVERRAN THE BALTIC. 




INTRODUCING OUR NEW SERIES OF WARGAMES: 

WHEN SUPERPOWERS COLLIDEI 



SSI has just turned the Cold War into 
a very hot one. We've produced an 
entire line of wargames under the title: 
WHEN SUPERPOWERS COLLIDE* Each 
game in the series presents a different 
scenario of probable U.S.-Russia con- 
frontations in various parts of the world. 

The first four releases are GERMANY 
1985," RDF ' (in the Persian Gulf). 
NORWAY 1985,' and BALTIC 1985.' 

Designed by Roger Keating, creator of 
SS/'s highly-acclaimed SOUTHERN COI\/l- 
!\/IAND ' these strategy simulations boast 
the same successful look and play as 
his previous masterpiece: beautiful color 
graphic displays, easy-to-use movement 
system and realistic combat rules. 

In GERMANY 1985, battalions of 
Soviet infantry, tanks, artillery units, and 



'48K disc tor the Apple II witfi Applesott ROtl/l card. 



paratroopers have breached the southern 
center of West Germany through the 
Fulda Gap. NATO forces must contain 
and repel the Red invasion. 

We've introduced several innovative 
rules to this game: Speed of movement 
is inversely proportional to the number 
of enemy units that can see you: smoke 
screens can be called upon to help cover 
an attack or retreat: and the concepts 
of HQ units, divisional integrity, and air 
superiority are fully incorporated. 

For improved playabllity, the computer 
can actually move and fire for you. For 
example, if you wish to move from point 
A to B. simply order the computer and it

NOVEMBER 1982 



WU 1 , 



Kabul Spy jumped back into contention while its running mate, Escape 
from Rungistan, continued as the leader. Infocom's three entries stayed 
on the list and the former undisputed adventure champ, Sierra On-Line, 
had to be content with a single contender. And that was Hi-Res Adven- 
ture #2: The Wizard and the Princess, an oldie but goodie. 

There were no real shockers in the Strategy 5. Rendezvous closed on 
leader Castle Wolfenstein. Former entry Hi-Res Computer Golf regained 
the list, pushing Sargon II to fifth. Strategic Simulations's line of Rapid 
Fire games hovered just outside the limit. 

The inclusion of AH Baba and the Forty Thieves in the Fantasy 5 list 
rectifies a Softalk error. Had it been included in this category in the prior 
two months, it would have been third in July and fourth in August. As it

is, the Quality Software entry scores fourth in a category still dominated 
by Wizardry and Knight of Diamonds. 

Home Accountant continues to dominate the Home 10 listing. Other 
than personal finance packages and communications software, this list 
tends to reflect seasonal requirements; for example, tax packages fare 
well during the early part of the year. Now is no different. With high 
school students going back to school and preparing for their college 
boards. Micro Lab's SA T English I package came from nowhere to 
edge into the list. 

The other change of note was a resurgence of strength by Micro- 
soft's Typing Tutor. For a time, it looked like MasterType would blow 
Typing Tutor out of the Apple market, but the pioneer typing teacher is 
making a comeback. 



1st CLASS MAIL. By Bob Schoenburg and Steve Pollack. 
Here's a pair of authors who may be software's answer 
to Irving Wallace. Wallace is the bestselling author who 
hears the murmuring of general populace and caters to 
their desires. Bob Schoenburg and Steve Pollack seem 
to have the same trait. 
Consider. 

The pair brought out Home Money Minder, a 
perfectly respectable home finance package. Then they 
listened to the user feedback. The result was Home 
Accountant, one of the phenomenal success stories of the 
first half of 1982. 

Around the same time Home Money Minder hit, the 
team also tested the market with The MaiJroom. 
Mailroom never was the success of HMM, but the authors 
used the same technique — listen to the users and in- 
corporate all the good ideas. The result is 1st CLASS 
MAIL — a program that, incredibly enough, manages to 
live up to its double-entendre name. 

All of the above is not to accuse Schoenburg and 
Pollack of putting out the programming equivalent of 
stalking-horses to do their market research for them. 
Their original efforts do stand on their own merit. They 
just pale next to the sequels. 

1st CLASS MAIL is so well thought out and so easy 
to use that other publishers who call their programs "user 
friendly" should bow their heads in shame. 

SOFTALK got an early release of the program sans 
documentation. Yet a rank computer illiterate was able 
to apply the program to two separate uses with relatively 
little trouble. This is high praise indeed: that a novice 
operator could use a powerful program with no more 
than the screen menus. 

The program allows for twelve fields, clearly more 
than the traditional name and address of a mailing label. 
The implication is that the software can be put to other 
innovative uses as well. The built-in ability to sort and 
filter on any field or combination thereof enhances the 
chances that users will find multiple applications for 
the program. 

Continental Software will actually be publishing 
four versions of the program.* The one already in release 
is for the Apple II using floppy disks. A hard-disk ver- 
sion will follow. Both versions are pending for Apple III 
as well, awaiting the development of a rapid binary sort 
subroutine. 

Ist CLASS MAIL is a first-rate program for special- 
ized data base applications.

There was a significant shakeup in positions in the Hobby 10 list, al- 
though Beagle Bros's DOS Boss retained the lead. Zoom Grafix jumped 
to secxjnd and DOS Tool Kit jumped to third. 

For the past two months, Apple Computer's aggressive marketing of

"MasterType is an excellent instructional 
typing game. We had fun reviewing it, and 
we highly recommend it to those who 
want to learn typing in an unconventional 
but motivating way" 

Infoworld also went on to rate Master- 
Type as Excellent in all categories.

essors. It seems now that the emphasis on word processing has rebound- 
ed to the benefit of everyone. 

Even discounting Apple Writer II giveaways, the package took over 
the lead from Screen Writer II. But Word Handler, Super-Text 40-56-70, 
and PIE Writer all appeared stronger in September. Chief losers ap- 
peared to be Screen Writer II and WordStar. 

There was a tremendous increase in the number of business pack- 
ages being sold by dealers, belying the theory that the Apple cannot com- 
pete with IBM or other personal computers for the business market. The 
BPI Accounts Receivable package regained the list, while VersaForm at- 
tained the list for the first time. 

BPI appears to have a clear lead as the accounting software of choice, 
but Great Plains, Accounting Plus, and newcomer State-of-the-Art ap- 



Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 6.7 percent of the sales of 
Apples and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in October to ascertain their sales leaders for the 
month of September. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was number of sales made — such other cri- 
teria as quality of product, profitability to the computer retailer, and personal prefer- 
ence of the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in October represented every geographical area of the continental 
United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index 
number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is an 
arbitrary measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are correla- 
tive only for the month in which they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index 
rating of 50 in one month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in an- 
other month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus-or-minus 4.7 percent, which translates roughly 
into the theoretical possibility of a change of 3.94 points, plus or minus, in any index 
number. 



pear neck-and-neck for runner-up position. 

VersaForm also performed well in the Apple III market, where it 
jumped from tenth to sixth. Apple III Business Graphics made a three-po- 
sition jump from sixth to third. 

The big news brings us full circle to where we started — VisiCorp. 
VisiCalc — Advanced Version jumped into tenth place in its first full 
month of distribution, indicating that Apple III users are intent on get- 
ting the most out of their powerful desktop tool. 

That's good news for VisiCorp, even if 1-2-3 is not.

£^he reason you bought a 

computer 

1^1 in the first place. 



The Agony... 
You 
expected 
your new computer 
to perform miracles 
— to bring order out «, ^ 
of cliaos. You looked i 
for it to organize and 
manage your business 
information. You looked forward 
to the end of errors, the end of 
frustration . . . and the saving of 
time, effort and money. Afterall, 
that's the reason you invested in 
a computer in the first place. 
Yet, there it sits. Nothing. 

...and the ecstasy. 

Well, your computer can per- 
form all the miracles you hoped 
for. It needs just one profes 
sional addition. The 
General Manager. 

The General Man 
ager is what the com- 
puter industry calls a 
data base management 
program (DBM). In 
everyday words — it 
allows you to organize 
store, file, find, save, re- 
treive, interrelate, control 
and print outall orselected parts 
of your information. The result: 
your information, or data, is 
managed totally, completely, 
automatically. 

Ordinary 

The ordinary DBM system 
expects your business to con- 
form to its program design. So 
you must change your records, 
your forms, your way of having 
information cross-referenced, 
saved and . . . well, you almost 
end up with a different business! 
Certainly a morefrustratingone. 

Extraordinary 

The General Manager on the 
other hand is extraordinary in 
the DBM field, because it makes 
no such demands on you. In- 
stead, It lets you make demands 
on it! The General Manager was 
designed so that your business 




The General Manager 




routines can be kept as indivi- 
dualized as you want ... so your 
data is managed and de- 
livered in the ways which 
are most useful, effi- 
cient and effective 
for you. 

It works so easily 
and so well because 
of its "hierarchial" 
structure. This sen- 
sible "family tree" 
type of design starts 
with the main subject, then 
branches out to related informa- 
tion. You enter data on "Blank 
Forms" which you may construct 
to your exact needs. The data 
may be updated, deleted or 
modified to 
your heart's 
content. To 
know The 
General Man- 
ager will be to 
love it! 



P-N'"RAI,MANAG[--R 



Power & 
Price 

Nothing 
near the price 
of the General 
Manager (by 
hundreds of 
dollars) gives 
you all the 
power, fea- 
tures and benefits it does! At 
$229.95, The General Manager is 
the absolute value in its field. 




Consider this: it supports 1 
to 4 floppy disk drives (even 
hard-disk systems). It includes 
utility programs which others 
charge hundreds extra for. 
Upper and lower case characters 
in the data base are provided 
without need for additional 
costly hardware. If someone 
goofs, the "error message" is 
displayed in understandable 
English. There is an on- 
screen "Help" function 
available any time. It 
creates Applesoft usable 
files for your program 
needs. And many espe- 
cially useful printing 
commands are built-in 
for 

greater flexi- 
bility. When 
you consider 
all these ad- 
vantages, and 
more, we think 
your business 
sense will a- 
gree, there's 
no contest at 
any price. 

The fantasy... 

Almost 
everyone 
claims user 
friendly docu- 
mentation. The fact remains 
much of it is convoluted, com- 
plicated and defies under- 



standing. You can't afford 
that! — - for a program 
without excellent 
documentation is 
/, frustrating and basi- 
cally useless. . 

...and reality! 

^' At Sierra On-Line we've 
spent the time and the effort 
to create superb documentation. 
It is so good that you can have 
The General Manager up and 
running after the first two 
chapters! And after you're 
thoroughly at home with it, you 
can move on to the other 
chapters as you have need for 
the many additional functions 
and capabilities. 

The reason you bought... 

... a computer in the first 
place was, we know, twofold: 
for word processing (our Screen 
Writer program is the leader) . . . 
but mainly for information man- 
agement. The General Manager 
is your powerful 
answer . . . the 
truly outstand- 
ing value in 
DBM's, bar 
none, at only 
$229.95.
