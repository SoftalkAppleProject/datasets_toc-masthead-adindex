JULY 1981 




Such a contradictory breed are war 
gamers that they're reminiscent of the 
old poem about the frog: 

"The froggy, him am a queer 
bird/him ain't got no tail almost hard- 
ly/him jumps when he runs/and sits 
down when he jumps/the froggy, him am 
a queer bird." 

For the most part, war gamers 
camouflage their interest behind mild de- 
meanors and thoughtful appearances— 
hardly as macho and bellicose as might 
be expected. A war games tournament 
bears great resemblance to a chess tour- 
nament, except that the players might 
seem a trifle unbalanced. 

This penchant for slight dementia is 
most notable during heated debates 
about the rules — occurrences never 
found at a chess tournament. 

By their very complex nature, war 
games are not susceptible to clear, con- 
cise rule books. And when war gamers 
congregate, there's bound to be discus- 
sion about whose interpretations are cor- 
rect. Such discussions are generally un- 
solvable among the participants, neces- 
sitating an umpire with the authority to 
make binding arbitration decisions. 

Another trait of war gamers, one 
more closely akin to their chess-playing 
cousins, is infinite patience. Players sit 
for hours, surrounded by their maps, 
charts, and playing pieces, merely con- 
templating a move. One move sequence 
having been completed, they cut card 
decks, spin spinners, and/or roll dice to 
determine the outcome of their strategy. 
As likely as not, the outcome will be a 
standoff, necessitating a repeat of the en- 
tire procedure until one player breaks off 
the engagement or a conclusive winner is 
determined. 

Not so many years ago, one of the 
bright young lights in war gaming cir- 
cles was Joel Billings, then a student at 
Claremont Men's College. Billings was 
one of the true talents at the art, some- 
times entering as many as three divi- 
sions of a war gaming tournament si- 
multaneously. This is roughly akin to

Garaventa, and

Murray. 



playing a couple of dozen simultaneous 
chess matches against near masters. 

Billings's finest hour came when he 
won one division of a tournament, placed 
second in another division, and reached 
the semifinals in yet a third division. 

When Billings graduated from Clare- 
mont with the bachelor's degree in eco- 
nomics in the spring of 1979, he had an au- 
tumn date with the University of Chica- 
go graduate school of business to be pre- 
ceded by summer employment with Am- 
dahl, a computer mainframe manufac- 
turer in northern California. 

He also had his continuing interest In 
war gaming and a new curiosity about 
the personal computers that were then 
just beginning to make their mark. 

He perceived that computerizing war 
games could add to their enjoyment by 
providing an impersonal umpire, in the 
form of the computer, who would know 
beyond a question of a doubt what the 
rules were. 

Also, the computer could carry out 
both players' moves simultaneously, thus 
making unnecessary the bogus simula- 
tions in which moves are executed in 
turns, with no chance for the opposing 
player to react until the result of the first 
player's move has been determined. 

Billings started scouting the possibili- 
ties for computerized war gaming and 
was referred to two progframmers at 
IBM's San Jose facility who were not 
war game fanatics. Their enthusiasm for 
the project— initially high— waned con- 
siderably when they learned that Bill- 




ings might have in mind a full-time, full- 
line software publishing company. They 
had no objections to some part-time ef- 
forts, but they couldn't see the computer 
war game industry as having the bright 
future of an IBM. 

War gamers are nothing if not thor- 
ough, so by that time Billings had devel- 
oped other avenues of finding program- 
mers who also were war gamers. He dis- 
tributed questionnaires in stores that fea- 
tured war games, asking for indications 
of interest in computerized war gaming 
and searching for programming talent. 

One of the respondents to that ques- 
tionnaire was John Lyon, who was to be- 
come a partner with Billings at the for- 
mation of Strategic Simulations. 

Lyon's background was as checkered 
as Billings's was pristine. He had 
dropped out of graduate school — coinci- 
dentally, it was the University of Chica- 
go's graduate school of business — sev- 
eral years before. 

In the course of doing a friend a fa- 
vor, he got involved in computer pro- 
gramming. He had given his friend a ride 
to an employment agency in Chicago 
and, while his friend applied for a job, 
Lyon filled out an application form him- 
self. He was sent on an interview for a 
novice programming position and was 
hired. 

He subsequently went to work for 
Control Data Corporation, where he 
spent nearly ten years working at tele- 
commvinlcatlons systems applications. 

At the end of that stint, Lyon was pro-

grammed out. His disenchantment was 
so great he swore he'd never program 
again. He studied gems, but found that 
jewelry stores were only looking for 
salespersons. 

The result was a return to program- 
ming in a totally different environ- 
ment — he began providing software for 
Atari pinball machines. Later he went to 
National Cash Register as an applica- 
tions programmer. 

After leaving Control Data, Lyon had 
become interested in painting ancient 
miniatures. As a war gamer, he chose 
ancient over other period miniatures be- 
cause there was a consistent set of rules 
followed nationally for the use of ancient 
miniatures in gaming and no such con- 
sistent set of rules existed for use of min- 
iatures of other periods. 

It was during a search for new minia- 
tures at the Game Table in Campbell, 
Cahfornia, that he saw a mimeographed 
flyer soliciting interest in computer war 
games. At the bottom was a request for 
interested programmers to call a phone 
number. 

In Lyon's words, "I thought to my- 
self, 'This is what opportunity looks like 
when it comes knocking.' " He called the 
number and reached Billings. 

Also responding to that questionnaire 
was Ed Williger. Lyon became author of 
SSI's first product, Computer Bismarck. 
Williger authored the second product. 
Computer Ambush. 

But it wasn't all that simple. In the be- 
ginning. Billings and Lyon hadn't even 



determined which computer might be 
best for the type of product they were in- 
terested in producing. So, while addition- 
al market studies were being made, de- 
velopment of Bismarck started on a bor- 
rowed North Star computer. 

At the West Coast war gamers con- 
vention, Pacificon, Billings conducted a 
survey— with a fifty-dollar door prize 
drawing as an incentive for participa- 
tion — to determine how many war 
gamers already had computers and 
which kind they had. 

That survey was followed by tele- 
phone interviews with a representative 
sampling of the initial respondents. 

Apple and TRS-80 were approximate- 
ly even in ownership by war gamers, 
with all other personal computers to- 
gether having only a minuscule share of 
that segment of the marketplace. 

Meanwhile, summer was coming to 
an end and Billings had to bite the bullet. 
He had to decide whether to cast his lot 
with SSI or proceed with his plans for 
graduate school. 

SSI won the nod. By that time Lyon 
had programmed a relatively simple fox 
and hounds game on the borrowed North 
Star; that achievement convinced Bill- 
ings that if they formed SSI, the compa- 
ny would be able to deliver product. The 
decision was made to convert the North 
Star code for the Apple, and business was 
set up in Billings's apartment. 

While Lyon set about the code con- 
version and the continuing program- 
ming effort. Billings bent his talents to 



marketing. One of the results was a 
breakthrough in computer software 
packaging. 

Bismarck was the first software mar- 
keted in a bookshelf size box, emulating 
its board game predecessors. Although 
the box is now slimmer, SSI has contin- 
ued its policy of bright, four-color boxes 
as its means of packaging. 

Bismarck also broke new ground in 
providing plastic movement charts, 
maps, grease pencils, and other manual 
game accoutrements. 

These innovations stemmed less from 
a conscious effort to distinguish the prod- 
uct from other software games than from 
Billings's familiarity with board war 
games, which usually contain maps and 
charts and are boxed. 

As with other embryonic companies 
in the microcomputer software industry, 
SSI's genesis gives lie to the old term cot- 
tage industry. It's been an apartment in- 
dustry. Like the other software publish- 
ers with similar roots, packaging mate- 
rials, documentation, and disks soon 
overran all available living space. 

In addition, an Apple and a TRS-80 
were set up in Billings's bedroom. When 
Lyon would finish his regular job at NCR, 
he'd go to the apartment and program 
well into the night — the beeps and whirrs 
and clicks of the computer providing a 
lullaby for Billings. 

Lyon went full-time with SSI in No- 
vember 1979, as he and Billings strove to 
wrap up their first product. 

The original management team was

JULY 1981 



completed with the December addition of 
Susan Billings, formerly a hospital ad- 
ministrator in Santa Barbara. 

Bi.smarck was introduced in late Jan- 
uary 1980 and, by early March, it was 
clear that either Billings or SSI would 
have to vacate the premises. Naturally, it 
was SSI that did the moving — the first of 
two moves to larger quarters within a 
year's time. 

For a company that originally set out 
to do war games for the Apple, SSI has 
developed a remarkably diverse soft- 
ware portfolio. Computer Quarterback 
was the first of what may become a full 
line of sports simulation games for the 
computer. A second product in that line. 



a computerized baseball simulation, was 
being play tested as this article was be- 
ing written and should be on the market 
by the time you're reading it. 

Cartels and Cutthroats marked SSI's 
first venture into business simulation 
games. It was written by Dan Bunten, 
also the author of Computer Quarter- 
back. 

The company's product flow stut- 
tered at the beginning but now has fallen 
into a pattern that calls for a new prod- 
uct each month. 

Ambush didn't follow Bismarck until 
June 1980 and it was September before 
Quarterback and Computer Napoleonics 
reached the market.

Computer Conflict and Computer Air 
Combat followed in November, but it was 
February 1981 before Warp Factor made 
its appearance. Apocalypse and Cartels 
were released in March and Torpedo 
Fire hit the market in April. 

In the works at the present time is 
SSI's first battle game involving ele- 
ments of fantasy games such as magic 
and mythical monsters. Fueled by 
Lyon's interest in ancient miniatures, it's 
a simulation with mythical elements 
such as Homer might have written. 

Computer Bismarck remains the all- 
time bestseller of the company, but a war 
game with a twist — Warp Factor — is bid- 
ding for that honor. Written by Paul Mur- 
ray, it's a war game of the future, not of 
the past, and it's currently one of the hot- 
test pieces of software on the market. 

The company is constantly working 
to upgrade the product line from a 
programming standpoint. There are 
plans for some of the older products to be 
converted to assembly language to en- 
able the programs to run faster, al- 
though Ambush has so far defeated the 
best efforts of three programmers who 
attempted it. SSI has also developed its 
own disk operating system, which speeds 
access to the disk considerably, an im- 
portant consideration because the games 
require constant disk accessing. 

Billings is hesitant to draw the paral- 
lel because of the obvious competitive as- 
pects, but his goal is essentially to make 
SSI the publisher of a complete spec- 
trum of strategy games for the compu- 
ter, just as Avalon Hill has been success- 
ful in publishing a wide line of board 
strategy games. 

SSI's success was noted in the 1980 
game survey conducted by The Space 
Gamer, the magazine for fantasy 
gamers. Bismarck and Ambush rated 
first and second as the most popular com- 
puter war games. 

SSI was among the most recogniz- 
able of the computer game manufac- 
turers and were rated in the top ten of all 
gamemakers in the same survey. 

Billings believes that the company's 
image as a war game publisher has pre- 
vented some authors from offering other 
types of strategy games to SSI. He hopes 
that the sports and business simulations 
will convince authors to give SSI a shot at 
their efforts. 

Still dedicated war gamers. Billings 
and Lyon are looking forward to this 
year's Paciflcon in San Mateo; it will be 
doubling as the national Origins conven- 
tion of war gaming. They'll be exhibiting 
instead of playing, but it's the first time 
the national convention has been held on 
the West Coast and there's a certain re- 
gional pride in the recognition that gives 
to western war gamers. 

If, at that convention, someone has 
come up with a board game simulation of 
software publishing, bet the mortgage on 
Joel Billings to win. He's a proven war 
gamer who's also a proven publisher.

oPEti Discussion 



Apple on Drugs 

We have five Apple computers here at 
Salem Hospital. The one in the phar- 
macy is being used extensively as we de- 
velop our own software. We showed some 
of these progn^ams at the New England 
Council of Hospital Pharmacists spring 
seminar at Nashua, New Hampshire, in 
May. 

Two of our pharmacists have also 
purchased Apple computers for use at 
home. 

We're interested in talking with any 
other pharmacists who have developed 
programs for hospital pharmacy.

macy, Salem Hospital, Salem, Massa- 
chusetts 



One-Key Printing 

I read "Homespun Hopes" in Open Dis- 
cussion {Softalk, May 1981), and I have 
found one of those little hidden functions 
that Doug Chang mentioned. To the best 
of my knowledge, it is not in the Apple- 
soft manual. 

It was actually a programming error 
that I intentionally made. I typed in a 
program that would, theoretically, never 
end. So, just for the heck of it, I entered 
END as the last line of my program. I 
thought I would be funny, so I put a ques- 
tion mark after the END statement, that 
is, END?. I didn't think anything of it un- 
til I listed the program. Instead of being 
END?, it was END PRINT. I then sub- 
situted a question mark for PRINT while 
programming, and, after hitting re- 
turn and running the program, it 
worked! To make a long story short, in 
Applesoft, you may substitute a question 
mark for PRINT while programming. It 
is a lot faster! Please try it. 
Charles M. Haire, Las Vegas, NV 

Mr. Haire's method of discovery is a 
far more delightful one, but the use of the 
question mark as an abbreviation for 
PRINT can also be discovered on page 70 
of the Applesoft Basic Programming 
Reference Manual. 



Enough To Turn My Green Eyes Blue 
When I bought Apple Post software 
twenty months ago, I had long golden 
hair to my waist. I now have straight 
gray hair and am almost bald from fight- 
ing "error encountered" problems with 
the program. 

I called Apple, CA, a dozen times. 
Then I called Apple, TX. I hired two soft- 
ware experts. I parked on the local Apple 
Computer rep's doorstep. All this was in 
addition to bugging the local dealers. 

No one . . . and I mean no one could 



tell me what caused the "error encoun- 
tered" or how to get around it. I spent 
more time retyping clobbered disks than 
running progn^anis. 

I finally went to CAA for a mailing 
program and redid my ten thousand plus 
names. 

Most purchasers of Apple Post are 
probably dumb bunnies like me. We get 
no help from the experts. 

The solution is simple: 

CATALOG 

DELETE ZIP 

DELETE SOUNDEX 
Go back into Apple Post and these two 
modules (where the error has occurred) 
will set up new files without errors. 

It also works faster starting from 
scratch. I would advise deleting those 
two files before any update. 

I don't know a RAM from a ROM or a 
Control-D from a GOTO, but I know when 
I have problems. 

Claudine Moffatt, Manchester, MD 

Softalk has not encountered this prob- 
lem and has not tested Ms. Moffatt's 
rather radical fix. If you recognize these 
problems and wish to attempt the fix, it's 
safest to save these programs on a 



separate disk rather than delete them en- 
tirely. 

tsiugnlL eht htiw tnemugrA nA 

If you look at page 69 of the May 1981 
issue, you will see an ad from Synergis- 
tic Software for their Linguist package. 

Line three of the screen is supposed to 
be Hebrew, Well, folks, someone really 
goofed! The letters are Hebrew, all right, 
but you've (or they've) got them going 
the wrong way. 

In Hebrew, we read from right to left 
(just like APL, hmmm). But in the ad, 
the screen shows them backward. Not a 
very good ad for a package which sup- 
posedly teaches linguistics. 

Also, the proper translation is "Who 
speaks Hebrew?" not "Do you speak He- 
brew?" 

Perhaps you should tell your adver- 
tiser (or better — proofread the ads you 
accept). 

I don't think I'll buy that package. 
L. P. Lewis, White Plains, NY 

The program itself does indeed print 
Hebrew to the screen and on the printer 
from right to left, thanks to the facility of 
the Apple. Typesetters are often not so 




THE SAGA CONTINUES . . 

IV inuunin's insi redoubt 

The cruel Emperor Tawala has been forced from 
his throne on the world of Galactica and has fled 
for his life to the planet of Farside, where he and 
a small bank of adherents prepare to make their 
last stand. Extreme solar conditions have 
isolated Farside from the rest of the galaxy, and 
so it remains to Benthi, leader of the local insur- 
rectionists, to press the final assault on Tawala 
and his minions. 

TAWALA'S LAST REDOUBT puts you in the 
position of rebel leader. You must intercept and 
decipher Tawala's secret messages to his sup- 
porters, form alliances with local chiefs, detect 
Tawala's spies in your midst, separate hard intel- 
ligence from enemy disinformation, avoid Ta- 
wala's military forays against you and, finally, 
lead the assault against the Prince's stronghold.

views. ) 

Incidentally, "Do you speak He- 
breivf" seems a reasonable idiomatic 
translation, just as On parle francais 
("one speaks French") and Se habla es- 
panol ("Spanish speaks itself") are prop- 
erly taken to mean "French spoken 
here" and "Spanish spoken here." 

Mlnot To Reason Why . . . 
I teach computer programming to high 
school juniors and seniors here in Minot. 
We have twelve Apple II Plus units with 
disk drives and language systems. Our 
semester course is based on Pascal, 
touching on Fortran the last four weeks. 



Our advanced class works with Pascal, 
Fortran, Pilot, and machine language. 

I have enclosed copies of two pro- 
grams that show how to use special out- 
put features in Pascal. I hope you can use 
these hints. 

The first program defines a character 
variable T as a blank. It would also have 
been declared as a constant. This makes 
the T;10 is the Writeln similar in ap- 
pearance to the T F'ormat control in For- 
tran. 

The variable LF is assigned the line- 
feed character. I get tired of seeing 
students' programs, programs in periodi- 
cals, and books cluttered with Write Ins. 
Some of them have twenty in a row.

Using the LF variable is similar to the / 
Format control in Fortran. 

The VT variable tabs straight down 
the screen in the middle of a Writeln. I 
would normally use a name like MC in- 
stead of Movecursor in my own pro- 
grams. This function can easily be added 
to the System. Library.

Adventuresome Youth 

I am a fifteen year old who's in the pro- 
cess of learning machine language and 
dabbling in Pascal. I have known Apple- 
soft and Basic for quite a while now and 
enjoy programming very much. I am 
also a software nut ; I especially like ad- 
ventures, and your magazine has helped 
me greatly. This leads up to my prob- 
lem. I have played almost every adven- 
ture on the market today, from Zork and 
Adventure to Prisoner and Mystery 
House, and not one has kept me busy for 
more than four days. So please, if you or 
your readers have information on new, 
hard.'! adventures, please let me know. 
Thank you.

□ What a robin redbreast is to spring, such is Organizing (the 
capital oh intended) to an industry's coming of age. So it was 
no small thing when a few software publishers and a few pro- 
grammers got together, separately, at the West C!oast Com- 
puter Faire to lay the foundation for professional interest or- 
ganizations. The former, temporarily dubbed the Software 
Publishers' Association, dedicated itself to establishing indus- 
try standards for hardware and software. Just since the Faire, 
it has expanded its scope to include software authors, and it's 
considering organizing under the modified name of Associa- 
tion of Software Producers. In June, about fifty participants 
and observers representing software interests throughout the 
United States met at Boston's Applefest '81 to exchange ideas 
and concerns important to producers. The purpose of the or- 
ganization is twofold, according to steering committee chair- 
man Mitch Kapor (Micro Finance Systems, Cambridge, MA) : 
it will serve an advocacy function, addressing itself to issues 
such as tax treatment of software royalties and legal protec- 
tion of software rights ; and it will serve as a forum for discus- 
sion and coordination among producers. The committee will 
also propose membership requirements and dues structures, 
Kapor said. He stresses that the term producer subsumes 
authors as well as publishers and invites both to send sugges- 
tions, solutions, and questions to him at Micro Finance, 180 
Franklin Street, Cambridge, MA 02139. Other members of the 
new organization's steering committee are: Jennifer Bodine, 
Biverbank Software (Denton, MD) ; Alan Boyd, Microsoft 
(Bellevue, WA) ; Stan Goldberg, Micro Lab (Highland Park, 
IL) ; David Lindbergh, Lindbergh Systems (Boston, MA) ; A. 
Richard Miller, Miller Micro Systems (Natick, MA) ; Evan 
Scharf, Information Unlimited Software (Berkeley, CA) ; Bar- 
ney Stone, Stoneware (San Rafael, CA) ; and Ken Williams, 
On-Line Systems (Coarsegold, CA). 

□ Vernon Publishing Services (Vernon CT) , a company spe- 
cializing in sales support items for the life insurance industry, 
has branched into software publishing by acquiring 50 percent 
ownership of the L.P.A. Tech Corporation (Springtown, PA). 
L.P.A. adapted the Capital Need Analysis and Financial Need 
Analysis computer programs. Vernon created them in non- 
computer form. 

□ Through a cooperative advertising and promotional pro- 
gram from Automated Simulations (Mountain View, CA), 
dealers and distributors can receive credit toward purchase of 
promotional goods— T-shirts, catalogs, and newsletters, for ex- 
ample — based on retail value of each order they submit. Cre- 
dits may be used at time of purchase or accumulated. 

□ Steve Peterson has taken the reins as president of Edu- Ware 
Services (Canoga Park, CA) , following his graduation from 
UCLA. Peterson will continue to serve as chief financial offi- 
cer. Sherwin Steffin becomes chairman of the board and di- 
rector of research and development for all products. 

□ Information Unlimited Software (Berkeley, CA) annoimces 
Chris Hegarty as chairman of the board. Lecturer and consul- 
tant to more than four hundred Fortune 500 corporations, 
Hegarty is also author of How To Manage Your Boss (Raw- 
son, Wade: 1980). lUS has expanded its facilities with a new 
products development office. 

□ Peachtree Software (Atlanta, GA) has acquired Small Busi- 
ness Applications (Houston, TX) , maker of Magic Wand word 
processor for CP/M Apples. Peachtree's modified, more 
powerful Magic Wand will be distributed through its three-hun- 
dred-plus dealers worldwide. 

□ John Williams has returned to the helm as general manager 
of On-Line Systems (Coarsegold, CA). He's also in charge of 



advertising. John Harris, formerly of Gamma Scientific, has 
come onboard as On-Line 's first Atari 800 programmer. Inci- 
dentally, Ken Williams reports that several hundred people re- 
sponded to his Softalk ad for programmers to program in the 
wilds of Coarsegold. What does it all mean? 

□ Apple Computer (Cupertino, CA) heard the cry of dealers 
and customers who've had to look all the way to Cupertino for 
technical help. Apple has moved its technical support into the 
field, creating technical centers in Sunnyvale and Irvine, Cali- 
fornia; Boston, Massachusetts; Charlotte, North Carolina; 
Carrollton, Texas; and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. . . . New Ap- 
ples are certified by the Federal Communications Commis- 
sion as complying with commission standards for electromag- 
netic interference. As a result, Apples cost more and weigh 
more, and the disk drive interface cord is short and battleship 
gray instead of conveniently long and bright with Apple's rain- 
bow colors — but your neighbors can presumably glut them- 
selves on "As the World Turns" without static. Rebels may 
note that rainbow-colored interface cords (not a product of Ap- 
ple) , in various lengths, are available separately in many com- 
puter and electronic stores. 

□ Someone, maybe you, will win a 32K Apple system with two 
disk drives and a twelve-inch Sanyo monitor in Inmac's sum- 
mer sweepstakes, designed to introduce the micro community 
to Inmac's new lifetime-guaranteed diskettes. Entry blanks 
are available in the summer Inmac catalog, which you can get 
by writing to Inmac, 2465 Augustine Drive, Santa Clara, CA

THE BASIC 




By Wm. V R. Smith 



This month the Basic Solution uses 
two of the subroutines in your library to 
create a stand-alone program titled 
Video Tape Calculation (VTC) . 

VTC uses the dollar formatter and the 
screen read subroutines. The dollar for- 
matter is the heart of a numeral input 
routine introduced in this program. 

The screen read routine is used to pro- 
vide a video "paper" tape of the past cal- 
culation. You may wish to delete this sub- 
routine to speed up the execution time. 

VTC uses the Reverse Polish Nota-

SOPTAI 1/ 



JULY 1981 




BY (wic mson 



If you're an ardent VisiCalc user, you've probably heard by 
now: there are some fancy new kids on the block. Personal 
Software has finally upgraded its celebrated number crunch- 
er to DOS 3.3, and, more or less at the same time, the compa- 
ny has also released a small armada of related business soft- 
ware. The new line-up includes VisiPlot, VisiTrend, VisiDex, 
and VisiTerm, as well as the venerable VisiCalc itself. 

VisiPlot takes data from VisiCalc — or any other source — 
and converts it to graphic display ; VisiTrend manipulates the 
data in various ways and performs statistical analysis upon it. 
VisiDex is a cross-referencing electronic index card program, 
and VisiTerm is a communications package. 

In this month's column we will review the first four new 
products. A review of VisiTerm will follow next month. 

Besides compatibihty with DOS 3.3, there are two other ma- 
jor areas of improvement in the new VisiCalc. First, there's a 
new storage format that eases the transfer of data from Visi- 
Calc to other programs (or from other sources to VisiCalc) ; 
second, VisiCalc now includes a number of conditional and 
logical operations that were missing before. 

What's the DIF? The new filing option is called Data Inter- 



change Format (DIF). Here's how it works. When you save 
via DIF you set your cursor at the upper left comer and speci- 
fy the lower right comer of the area you want filed. You don't 
have to save the whole work sheet. 

The program sends your data to disk either row by row or 
column by column, according to your choice. Which you 
choose will depend on what you want to do with your data later 
on. Each column or row, depending on which way you save, 
will be treated as a separate series of data points for the pur- 
pose of plotting or analysis by VisiPlot or VisiTrend. 

The DIF procedure stores only sequences of numbers and 
labels. Formulas, formats, and the original VisiCalc coordi- 
nates all get left behind. Numbers are filed in full precision, al- 
though, if you don't want all those decimal places, you can 
round off before filing. 

DIF is intended to facilitate transfer of data from one ap- 
plication to another. For temporary storage of a VisiCalc work 
sheet in progress, you probably wouldn't want to use this op- 
tion, because reloading the DIF file would require re-creating 
all those formulas and formats. 

There are some situations, however, in which it might be

HAVE YOU EVER WORKED ON A PROGRAM LATE INTO THE NIGHT? 

Now with the Program Line Editor (PLE), pro- 
gram development and modification take only a 
fraction of the time previously required. PLE is the 
most sophisticated program development tool ever 
made for the Apple II* computer, letting you devote 
your energies to design, analysis, and testing instead 
of the drudgery of repetitive keying of program lines 
requiring slight changes. 

FEATURES INCLUDE: 

SOPHISTICATED PROGRAM EDITING FEATURES - More than eleven editing commands, such as INSERT, DELETE, 
PACK, and FIND allow you to change a program line with a minimum of keystrokes. 

VERSATILE ESCAPE FUNCTIONS - User definable command sequences can be assigned to any key, then invoked when- 
ever desired by pressing ESC and that key. Twenty-seven predefined functions come with PLE (ROM version 
functions cannot be modified). 

LISTING CONTROL - This feature allows you to control program listings, CATALOGS, etc., with the touch of a key - 
stopping and starting them at will, or terminating them entirely. 

LOWER CASE - Lower case characters can now be entered directly from the keyboard without any cumbersome software 
patches. 

PROGRAMMABLE CURSOR CONTROL - Fancy screen displays are made possible with the Programmable cursor 
feature. Four characters control cursor movement in all four directions from within PRINT statements. 

INVISIBLE AND INDESTRUCTIBLE - When booted, PLE actually makes itself a part of the Disk Operating System, 
and thus is unaffected by INT, FP, and MAXFILES commands.

useful to reload a DIF file onto a VisiCalc work sheet. For one 
thing, when you load, you get the same column- versus-row 
choice. So, if you have any reason to, you can reorganize data 
from columns into rows, or vice versa, using DIF. 

More importantly, DIF data can be brought back to any 
part of the VisiCalc work sheet. So, for example, if you had sev- 
eral people in the field gathering and storing data via Visi- 
Calc, you could consolidate their input on a master work sheet, 
and the master could both summate the individual input and 
display it separately. 

Until now, Apple VisiCalc work sheets could be overlaid, 
but any data you wanted to Juxtapose in the overlay had to 
come from distinct coordinates to begin with — which required 
hassle upfront. 

The DIF feature permits the integration not only of one 
function with another — VisiCalculating with VisiPlotting, for 
example — but also of one VisiCalc application with another. 

New Conditions. The other major improvement in the up- 
dated VisiCalc is the inclusion of conditional operators. There's 
now a function called (5 CHOOSE that works like an On . . . 
Goto statement in Applesoft. ^CHOOSE (E7,10,-8.98,F2) first 
looks at coordinate E7; if that location holds the number 1, the 
function returns the value 10 ; if E7 holds a 4, the function yields 
the value held by F2, and so on. The function only works, of 
course, if the possible values at E7 are consecutive positive in- 
tegers. 

Other kinds of conditional branching can be brought about 
through the use of Boolean operators. Now you can plug in a 
formula like A1/A2 < A3 at a given coordinate, say A4. The for- 
mula will yield true, false, error, or NA (the last case if you're 
holding Al, A2, or A3 open for data to come) . Then, at another 
coordinate, you can apply an if . . . then . . . else type of 
branch. The function (SIF (A4, 100,200) looks for a Boolean 
value at A4; if that value is true, the function returns 100; if 
false, 200. The first field has to be a coordinate location holding 
either true or false; the second and third fields can be any- 
thing. 



So now you can put extensive alternate scenarios into 
distant, unrelated sections of a VisiCalc work sheet and sum- 
mon results from different corners using the conditional op- 
erators. VisiCalc's range of uses have taken on new dimen- 
sions of complexity. 

Two other changes are important. First, the new VisiCalc 
will run on either 3.2 or 3.3 systems. If you don't want to Muffin 
over your old 3.2 data files, you just throw in the Basics disk be- 
fore booting VisiCalc. Second, the program now takes advan- 
tage of the extra memory provided by the langtiage system. 
The VisiCalc is larger than the old one, so if you don't have the 
language system, you'll find yourself with a little less avail- 
able workspace in RAM. If you do have the language system, 
you'll come out slightly ahead. 

Plotting against VisiCalc. Of the other new products from 
Personal Software, the most natural companion to and exten- 
sion of VisiCalc is the VisiPlot/VisiTrend package. VisiPlot is 
available as either a stand-alone or as part of the Trend com- 
posite, so we'll consider it first. 

The first thing one is apt to notice when booting up VisiPlot 
(or VisiTrend) is a comfortably familiar style. Wherever pos- 
sible, the outward appearance and manner of VisiCalc have 
been preserved. Communication with the user is via a status 
area, commands are preceded with the slash key, and the pro- 
gram is menu-driven throughout. 

Although it will process any numerical data you care to 
feed it, VisiPlot has be'en designed to use DIF files created by 
VisiCalc. When you transfer a full or partial work sheet from 
VisiCalc to VisiPlot by way of DIF, each row or column de- 
pending on how you saved the work sheet, becomes a single 
plottable set of data points. The entire DIF file goes on disk as 
one unit, with each row or column a subunit. The program uses 
the term file to designate the overall structure and series for 
the subunits. Up to sixteen series, or a maximum of 645 data 
points, may be loaded into memory at one time; if the Visi- 
Calc sheet you're saving exceeds those limits, you'll need to 
break it up.

Applied to DIF data or not, VisiPlot's file and series ap- 
proach makes sense, because it allows you to load or save a lot 
of related information all at once. With eight or ten or sixteen 
data series in memory at the same time, you can overlay sev- 
eral graphs— up to a maximum 150 data points— for quick and 
easy comparison. 

The kinds of graphs VisiPlot offers include line charts, area 
charts, bar graphs, pies, high-low plots, and scatter plots. 

The line chart option draws simple graphs with points con- 
nected by straight lines. Up to three can be displayed simul- 
taneously, with the data points of each series marked by dif- 
ferent symbols and a legend provided below. The program will 
actually display as many line plots as you want, up to the maxi- 
mum 150 data points, but it has distinct symbols for only three 
series. 

Bars to the Left, Bars to the Right. The area chart is sim- 
ply a line graph with the area between the line and the x axis 
shaded in. 

Bar graph bars come in three styles: normal, left, and 
right ; the left and right afford side-by-side comparison of two 
data series. Bars can be open, shaded, or hatched, allowing 
easy distinction in side-by-side overlays. You can also com- 
bine two bar graphs in an over-and-under fashion, to illus- 
trate, for example, growth in various categories from one year 
to the next. 

The high-low and scatter charts require two data series 
over a common range. The high-low is useful for something 
like tracking high and low stock prices per day for a given 
stock; on this graph, you could also overlay a line chart of the 
closing prices. The scatter plot puts one series on the y axis and 
the other on the x axis and marks all points of coincidence ; it's 
useful for demonstrating the presence and manner of correla- 
tion between two series of data. 

The different kinds of graphs can be combined in various 
ways — such as a line over a bar graph or a line over an area 
chart. Using the window option, the hi-res screen can also be 
split in half — vertically or horizontally — to display two entire- 
ly separate minigraphs at the same time. 



Titles come in boldface or regular type. The program pro- 
vides up to three lines of legend and an unlimited number of la- 
bels that you can move around on the graph. These movable ti- 
tles can be displayed either normally or in inverse video. 

Aside from the normal editing functions of changing, add- 
ing and deleting data, VisiPlot can also Interpolate any num- 
ber of values between two existing points. It can even drop in 
any specified number of points in an arithmetic or geometric 
series of your own devising. 

Additional features Include color control of both data dis- 
play and background and the option to include horizontal 
and/or vertical grid lines. You can also restrict the range 
along either axis, making it possible to zoom in on a particular 
area of your data. If you alter a scale so that some of your 
points are off the screen, the program politely tells you you've 
done so and asks for confirmation. Then it displays what it can. 

VisiPlot graphs can be printed on the Sllentype, Trendcom 
200, Paper Tiger 440 and 445, or the graphics-equipped NEC 
Spinwriter 5510, 5515, 5520, and 5525. Hi-res Images can also be 
saved as such on disk and incorporated into your own pro- 
grams. 

Taking Care of Business. VisiPlot is Intended for business 
use. All the various graph formats expect to see dates along 
the X axis. That's nifty for most business applications. If your 
data is monthly, the program will even drop in initials for the 
appropriate months. On the other hand, if you're going to plot 
pH against milliliters of titrate, you'll find VisiPlot a. touch 
clumsy. 

The only other caveat worth mentioning is the possibility of 
overkill. For those who do not require or want all that VisiPlot 
provides, the program might be unnecessarily unwieldy. It's 
too large to fit into memory all at once, and going from the 
plotting module to the file-handling/editing module can cause 
some vexing delay. 

The same comment holds for the composite of VisiTrend 
and VisiPlot. In this package, there are three separate, large 
modules— the plotter, the trender, and the flle-handler/edltor. 
For some reason, the program does not allow direct move- 
ment from plot module to trend module ; you have to go by way 
of the file handler, an expedition that may leave you with 
hands in lap for a minute or more. 

That's a trivial annoyance, however, considering the power 
of the combined Trend/Plot package. The Trend menu offers 
three major areas of functionality, under the headings Ana- 
lyze, Fhanction, and Xform. 

Analyze displays several series of data in tabular format — 
up to the limits imposed by Apple's forty-column output. It also 
calculates various statistical indices and performs linear mul- 
tiple regression analyses on as many as five independent vari- 
ables. 

The statistics available include: number of points, mini- 
mum and maximum, mean, variance, standard deviation, and 
the coefficient of correlation between any two series. 

The regression analysis is done by the least squares meth- 
od. Besides constant and coefficients, the program also calcu- 
lates the T statistic, R-bar squared statistic, corrected R-bar 
squared statistic, the standard error for the regression and for 
the coefficients, the sum of the squared residuals, the F statis- 
tic, and the Durbin-Watson statistic. The regression analysis 
also generates two new series of data that can be displayed by 
the plot program: a fitted series, which uses the calculated 
constant and coefficients; and a residual series, which shows 
the difference between actual and fitted data. 

The second main division of the menu. Function, manipu- 
lates original data to provide more information: options are 
moving average, single exponential smoothing, percent 
change, lag, lead, and a running total. The moving average is 
calculated by the N + 1 method, although the user can choose 
to convert the results to the N or centered methods. 

Each manipulation generates its own ancillary data series, 
which can be plotted alongside the original data. 

In case the choices under Function still don't give you the 
angle on your data that you want, Xform allows you to define

your own transformation formulas, using up to eighty charac- 
ters. All Applesoft operators and functions are at your dis- 
posal: arithmetic operators, logical operators, comparative 
operators, trigonometric and logarithmic functions, and mis- 
cellaneous functions like INT, RND, and SQR. Among other 
things, Xform lets you do the equivalent of plotting a second or 
higher-order function on log paper. Using the EXP function, 
you can also make higher-order data available for linear mul- 
tiple regression analysis. 

All Hands on Dex. Turning now from complexity to artful 
simphcity, VisiDex is a freeform data storage and retrieval 
program. The basic unit of storage is a forty-column by twen- 
ty-line index card, filed under user-specified keywords or 
dates. Within this simple, flexible format, VisiDex offers 
myriad search, sort, print, and calendar options for myriad po- 
tential uses. 

Like VisiPlot and VisiTrend, VisiDex employs a code struc- 
ture and status display that will provide fond remembrance of 
VisiCalc. When you've finished creating a data card, for ex- 
ample, you hit /K for keyword and designate one or many 
words, numbers, or phrases that will become index entries for 
subsequent retrieval of the card. Up to eighty characters may 
be used in keywords for any given card. The current date — or 
any other — can also be used as a keyword, a feature that per- 
mits the use of VisiDex as an appointment book and as a file 
cabinet. If you have a clock from Mountain Computer or Cali- 
fornia Computer Services, VisiDex will handle date functions 
automatically. Otherwise, you Just tell it the date when you 
boot up. 

Keywords don't have "to be part of the screen's contents. 
Designating a keyword that doesn't actually appear on the 
screen could be handy at print time. You could, for example, 
file a bunch of names and telephone numbers, all under the 
keyword phone ; you could then print all the cards stored un- 
der that heading, without having to print the keyword itself 
with each entry. 

Another way to accomplish this would be to put the key- 
word on the screen in inverse video ; the program glveS you the 
option of ignoring inverted material on the printout. 

For that matter, you could put the keywords near the bot- 
tom of your index cards and tell the program to print only the 
top five or ten lines. The print routine defaults to twenty- two 
lines per card, which leaves two line spaces between each, if 
you fill the cards, and makes for an even three per form on fan- 
fold paper. But of course, you can override the default value. 

Other data entry and editing featiires include five fixed tab 
stops, flashing display, a stack-oriented line delete and insert 
that allows you to move whole lines around on the screen, and 
word wraparound. The program also supports the Dan Pay- 
mar lower-case adaptor, but only with the optional shift-key 
modification. Without the shift-key mod, the Paymar chip is of 
no avail. 

Besides the freeform approach to data storage, VisiDex 
also offers the option of defining and laying out recurrent data 
fields. You can set up a template card with fields for, say, 
name, address, phone number, age, income, or whatever. 
Then, anytime you want to create a card with those fields, you 
just call up the template— by its own keyword, of course. The 
predefined fields on the template draw the cursor, saving key- 
strokes, and if you put them in inverse, they can be included or 
excluded at print time. 

Data retrieval can be accomplished either by way of key- 
words or by literal portions of screen text. The keywords, of 
course, bring it back a whole lot quicker, since the program 
only has to scan an index; when you hit /KG (get keyword), 
the disk starts to spin even before you type the keyword. Once 
you've typed it, retrieval is practically immediate. 

In case you forget how you've spelled a keyword, there are 
two kinds of wildcards at your disposal. The asterisk can stand 
for single characters, the hyphen for any number of charac- 
ters. 

There's also an option to review the entire index of key- 
words. The program presents them in alphabetic order and 



shows you how many cards you've stored under each key- 
word. 

Since the program knows how to sort alphabetically, you 
can, if you like, devote an entire data disk to a single purpose, 
such as mail or phone list. If all your keywords are surnames, 
you can ask for a sorted print and have VisiDex run off your 
entire list — or any segment of it — in alphabetic order. 

You can search for numbers in screen text using relational 
or comparative symbols like greater than or less than. For ex- 
ample, an agency that solicits contributions could establish a 
list of donors and selectively recall those who had contributed 
within a particular range, and so on. The program will ignore 
dollar signs, commas, and decimals during a numeric search. 

The Dating Game. The calendar features allow you to 
make dated reminders to yourself. When you use a date as a 
keyword, the system also asks you to specify a warning pe- 
riod — between zero and fifteen days. Then whenever you boot 
VisiDex, the program starts by reminding you of any current 
messages. You can also ask VisiDex to display the reminder at 
various regular intervals — weekly, monthly by date, or month- 
ly by weekday. 

The system also displays or prints on command the calen- 
dar for any month in the twentieth century with brackets 
around any date for which there's a reminder stored on disk. 
Or you can get it to display or print a daily, weekly, or month- 
ly schedule of stored reminders. 

Unlike VisiCalc, VisiPlot, and VisiTrend, VisiDex does not 
use or create DIF files. It does, however, provide the option of 
printing a text file to disk, in the manner of VisiCalc' a /PD 
command. The text file thus created can, of course, be incor- 
porated into other programs. 

VisiCalc is by Dan Bricklln and Bob Frankston ; the price is 
$199.95. VisiPlot, as a stand-alone, sells for $179.95; the price 
with VisiTrend is $259.95. Both programs are by Mitchell Ka- 
por. VisiDex, by Peter Jennings, retails for $199.95. 

All four programs require 48K and a disk drive. Plot and 
Trend need Applesoft as well. JM

Mind Your 




BY PETER OLIVIERI 




This month, we'll look at the stages a typical business goes 
through in implementing its first computer system, and we'll 
consider ways to prepare yourself for that first computer ap- 
plication. 

All businesses, regardless of size, must keep records, man- 
age operations, and plan for the future. Toward these ends, the 
computer can provide very useful service. Improved speed 
and accuracy enhance record-keeping and can reduce clerical 
costs. Operations may be improved by more effective inven- 
tory control, reduced product costs, and better scheduling. 
Planning can provide better information to managers, en- 
hancing decision making. Historical data can be used to make 
predictions for the future. 

Sounds great! But there's no turnkey business computer 
system that arrives on site and manages the business for you. 
Before the computer can help, you have to do your homework. 
You'll have to do a lot of self-evaluation along with substantial 
document and data collection. In addition, you must make a 
commitment to spend a significant amount of time planning 
each new application. Over the years, this column will provide 
resources to help you in these efforts. 

There are, indeed, stages firms go through in applying the 
computer. First, the emphasis is on cost-reduction accounting 
applications. The usual applications include payroll, customer

billing, and accounts payable and receivable. When comfort- 
able with these areas, the business often turns to applying the 
computer in other functional areas. The computer may be 
used for inventory control, forecasting, general ledger, capital 
budgeting, and personnel management. 

Typically, there comes a time when there are so many new 
applications that the business calls a halt to any new pro- 
grams and turns instead to an emphasis on control. Initially, 
this might just be control over the existing applications. 
Eventually, various scheduling and purchasing control appli- 
cations may be instituted. 

The final stage occurs when the business turns toward data 
base applications. At this time, you'd find a system with 
financial planning models, simulations models, and, perhaps 
in each, the capability of direct inquiry into the data base it- 
self. 

The Impact of the Microcomputer. The microcomputer's 
impact on these stages has been rapid, because computer pro- 
grams necessary to accomplish many of these applications are 
currently available for microcomputers. (This does not neces- 
sarily mean that such programs are easily implemented in a 
business, a common misconception.) Thus, you could actually 
start at any of the stages. Despite the temptation to start at an 
advanced point in this typical growth pattern, you are prob- 
ably better off starting with the more common and easily man- 
aged applications, growing into the more complex and de- 
manding ones. Not only does this pattern improve the likeli- 
hood of early successes, it also provides the groundwork for 
you to plan the computer's role in other business areas. 

The Most Common Applications. The most common busi- 
ness applications on the computer are billing and sales 
analysis, accounts receivable and payable, payroll and labor 
analysis, sales order/transaction processing, general account- 
ing, and inventory control. We'll study these applications in 
more detail in a future column. 

Regardless of the application you select as the first candi- 
date for computer processing, you need to take certain pre- 
liminary steps. 

First, make a list of what information you need to run your 
business. How many transactions are there? What type of in- 
formation is needed? What reports are required? What should 
these reports look like? What files are needed to produce these 
reports? What data is needed in each of these files? 

The most important point made here is the need for organ- 
ization. Being careful and thorough will pay off later. Each 
area you're considering for computerization must be 
thoroughly analyzed. You'll need to look at current forms, 
study existing procedures, interview personnel involved, and 
gather lots of data. This will be true whether you're com- 
puterizing an existing application or designing an entirely new 
one and whether you're writing the programs yourself or buy- 
ing software. 

It's useful to put together a notebook containing the fruits of 
your labor. The notebook should contain the following sec- 
tions : 

Section 1: A Narrative. This section briefly describes the 
application. At the least, it should include the objectives of the 
proposed application. 

Section 2: Interviews. Unless you're truly a one-person 
business, you'll have to talk with others about their current and

future information needs. Record the information gathered 
throug^h these interviews for reference. 

Section S: The hiputs. During the familiarization process, 
try to gather all the information you can about the input re- 
quirements. 

What volumes are involved? 

What form does the input take? 

When is the input received? 

How is the input recorded? 

From whom is the input received? 

Is the input modified or manipulated in any way? 

Where is the input filed? 

Is there a retention time for the document? 

Where do copies go? 

If available, samples of any input forms should be col- 
lected. 

Section h: The Outputs. Determining the output require- 
ments is one of the more critical steps. Once you know what 
output is required, it's rather easy to ensure that you have the 
necessary inputs to produce those outputs. In addition, you'll 
be more aware of what processing must take place. Questions 
you should answer include: 

What does the output (or report) look like? 

Where does the output go? 

What is the purpose of each report? 

How long does it take to produce the output? 

How long is the report kept? 

How are errors corrected? 

Once again, samples of any existing reports should be col- 
lected. If none exist, rough drawings of the proposals should be 
provided. 

Section 5: The Operations. The input and output documents 
are linked by the processing that transforms one into the other. 
You'll need to find out as much as you can about these 
processes. 

What is done? 

Who does it? 



When is it done? 
How is it done? 

Are there any special formulas? 
How much time does it take? 
What rules are followed? 

What are other people's perceptions of the system? 

Section 6: Nature of Files. Every business maintains rec- 
ords. Your investigation of file requirements will help deter- 
mine your computer system's storage needs. Collect this da- 
ta: 

What is the name of the file? 
Where is it located? 

How is it stored — in a filing cabinet? On cards? 

How old is the oldest record in the file? 

How old is the youngest record in the file? 

How is the file organized? 

Is it alphabetical? By part number? 

How many records are there in the file? 

How many fields are contained in each record? 

How many characters are contained in a record? 

How will data be deleted from the file? 

Section 7: Resources. What resources will be needed to im- 
plement effectively the proposed application? 

Will additional people be needed? 

What equipment will be required? 

Are there any forms that will be needed? 

Will the new system impact available space? 

What supplies will be required? 

What will the financial commitment be? 

As you can see, lists can be a great help in preventing you 
from forgetting to gather a particular piece of data or ask a 
certain question. These lists aren't exhaustive, but they pro- 
vide a beginning point from which to organize your computer 
planning efforts. We'll continue with such check lists in future 
issues. 

Now, if you've been thorough in gathering background in- 
formation, you can determine whether your Apple system is 
complete enough to handle the application that interests you. 
One key factor is the volume of data that must be stored. A 
diskette or cassette tape can only hold so much. (The fact is, a 
tape system is inappropriate for any serious business applica- 
tion and should not be considered an option.) If your applica- 
tion has a large amount of data, you may need more than one 
disk drive. Indeed, your data storage needs may be so great 
that the application is presently impractical. 

In addition, your review of the output needs for your appli- 
cation will have pointed out the requirements for a printer. 
Should the printer be able to handle special forms? Must it pro- 
duce multiple copies of a document? What size paper will be 
required? 

It is critical that you have the right hardware for the job. 
The best software doesn't work quite as well with inadequate 
hardware, and great hardware can't improve poor software. 
Don't consider the minimum system for your needs; rather, 
choose the most appropriate system. Remember that there 
are other applications you'll be considering. What will their 
hardware requirements be? Plan for growth. 

Let's assume you have the hardware to implement the ap- 
plication you've selected. Your next step should be to check the 
market for software packages that meet the needs you've de- 
scribed. Do this even if you are a crackerjack programmer 
and are considering writing all your own software. There'll be 
plenty for you to do, and there's no sense in reinventing the 
wheel. See what's available. Find out the costs. Evaluate. Then 
make your decision. 

Unfortunately, this isn't any easy task. There's such a pro- 
liferation of microcomputer software that it's very difficult to 
find out what's available and determine what's right for you. 
Softalk is an excellent source of information. You might also 
consult catalogs such as Vanlove's 1981 Apple Software Direc- 
tory "Master Catalog, " published by Vital Information (Kan- 
sas City, MO) and The Book of Apple Computer Software 1981, 
published by The Book 1981 (Marina Del Rey, CA) . There are.

however, very few sources for software evaluation, such as 
user ratings. While this situation will eventually change (we'll 
be reviewing and comparing packages in this column), the 
change will be slow. For now, decisions must be made with in- 
complete information. 

A good beginning is to rely on the reputation of the vendors. 
Call them. The cost of the call is apt to be small compared to 
the value of the information you'll receive. You'll be surprised 
at how much information you can get this way. The vendor 
won't build your system for you; but, if you've done your 
homework, you're likely to get direct answers to most of your 
questions. By the way, have your questions ready before you 
dial that number. 

After reviewing what's available, you may decide that it's 
better to write your own programs or have someone else write 
them for you. The packages that interested you might be too 
expensive, or perhaps your needs are very specific and would 
require too much customizing. In any event, because of your 
earlier efforts, you'll be prepared to make an informed deci- 
sion. 

There are a few packages that a business should have be- 
cause they provide such a variety of applications. One of these 
packages is a data base management system (hereafter called 
a DBMS). This is a powerful package that talks the user 
through an application. The DBMS can create your data base, 
make modifications, and print a variety of useful reports. The 
specific application for the DBMS is up to the user. 

A second package recommended for any business software 
library is VisiCalc or a FisiCaZc-like program. This type of 
package is designed to serve a variety of needs ; it is quite a 
valuable resource. 

In our next tutorial, we'll look closely at data base manage- 
ment systems and how they can be applied in business. Our 
software review section will then describe and evaluate some 
currently popular DBMS packages. 

Review Preview. Mind Your Business is receiving for re- 
view many of the business application packages available to- 
day. We spend a good deal of time with each, reading all the 
supporting material, familiarizing ourselves with the particu- 
lar package, and thoroughly testing it. As the number of appli- 
cation packages increases, we'll provide the basis for making 
product comparisons. This way, buyers can refer to a table 
comparing all the packages in an area on a variety of charac- 
teristics. You can weight the different characteristics as you 
see fit to reflect what's important to you. 

You can participate in the review process by sending Sof- 
talk your reactions to systems with which you've had experi- 
ence. This will build a file of user ratings to share with read- 
ers. 

Product reviews appearing in Mind Your Business will 
comment on each of the following: What application area is the 
product best suited for? What equipment is needed to use this 
product? What is the quality of the documentation? Is it pro- 
fessionally done? Is it easy to read? Comprehensive? Com- 
plete? What is the cost of the product? What documentation is 
provided with the package? Is the product currently avail- 
able? Can the applications be customized by buyers for their 
particular businesses? Can the package be expanded or en- 
hanced as the business grows? What support is provided? iM 
the vendor accessible? Are backups provided? What about up- 
dates to the package? Are there companion products that 
make this package more powerful? What do other users say 
about this product? 

And, of course, we'll add personal comments when appro- 
priate. 

The Readers Speak. "I have an Apple II Plus and I also 
have a business. I originally got the Apple for home use, pri- 
marily for entertainment. It would seem, however, that I 
should be using it in my business. My problem is not knowing 
where to start. Do business owners usually write their own pro- 
grams, purchase a set of programs from a vendor, or hire a 
consultant?" 
R. L., Baltimore, MD 



Whether or not you should be using your Apple in your busi- 
ness is a question only you can answer — considering, of course, 
the potential problems that might follow when you remove the 
entertainment from your home. The question is a common one, 
yet there's no common answer. Each of the methods you sug- 
gest has been used as the start-up step of a business. In each 
case, the desired application was successfully developed. The 
outcome depends a great deal on the people involved. Some 
Apple owners would rather do anything than write a computer 
program. Others would not even consider the alternatives. 

Our recommendation is to purchase a generalized package 
(for example VisiCalc) and experiment with it. This will give 
you some experience with a vendor-supplied package, some 
experience with customizing an application, and practice 
using a business-oriented tool. 

We assume you know how your business works and are par- 
ticularly competent in the area you're considering for comput- 
erization. If you have no knowledge of accounting, it wouldn't 
be wise to begin with an accounting package or application. If 
it's your first business application on a computer, start small. 
Create a mailing list, record expenses, or generate a monthly 
income report. 

Once you're familiar with what's involved, you'll be in a 
better position to select from the alternatives that you men- 
tioned. My personal ranking would be (1) purchase from a ven- 
dor, (2) write it yourself, and (3) hire a consultant. Some of the 
material discussed in this month's tutorial should help you 
plan future computer applications. 

For Your Bookshelf. From time to time, we'll suggest 
books that could be valuable additions to your business book- 
shelf. We'll include business books, computer books, and books 
of general interest. As a start, we recommend a glossary to 
help you deal with some common computer jargon : The Illus- 
trated Computer Dictionary , by Donald Spencer, pubhshed by 
the Charles E. Merrill Publishing Company. A paperback, the 
book retails for $6.95. We think you'll find it quite helpful.

you have already, add or subtract any number by using a loop 
of repetitive operations, but this would be a bit tedious, not to 
mention slow. Fortunately, a better method exists. But, first, a 
quick review of some binary math facts. 

Earlier in the series, we discussed the idea behind binary 
numbers and why they're so important in computers. In case 
you missed it, or your memory has faded, here's a fresh look. 

By now you're certainly comfortable with the idea of a hyie 
being an individual memory location which can hold a value 
from $00 to $FF (0 to 255) . This number comes about as a di- 
rect result of the way the computer is constructed and the way 
in which you count in base two. 

Each byte can be thought of as being physically made up of 
eight individual switches that can be in either an on or opposi- 
tion. We can count by assigning each possible combination of 
ons and offs a unique number value. 

In the following diagrams, if a switch is off, it will be repre- 
sented by a 0 in its particular position. If it's on, a 1 will be 
shown. When all the switches are off, we'll call that 0. 

In base two, each position of the byte is called a bit, and the 
positions are numbered from right to left, from 0 to 7. 

The pattern for counting is similar to normal decimal or 
hex notation. The value is increased by adding 1 each time to 
the digit on the far right, carrying as necessary. In base 10, 
you'd have to carry every tenth count, in hex, every sixteenth. 
In base two, the carry will be done every other time\ 

So . . . the first few numbers look like this: 



Hex 
$00 
$01 
$02 
$03 
$04 



Decimal 

0 
1 
2 
3 
4 



Binary 

0 0 0 
0 0 0 
0 0 0 
0 0 0 
0 0 0 



Notice that in going from 1 to 2, we would add 1 to the 1 al- 
ready at the first position (bit 0) . This generates the carry to in- 
crement the second position (bit 1). Here is the end of the 
series : 



$FD 253 
$FE 254 
$FF 255 



1 1 1 
1 1 1 
1 1 1 



1 0 1 
1 1 0 
1 1 1 



Now the most important part. Observe what happens when 
the upper limit of the counter is finally reached. At $FF (255) , 
all positions are full. When the next increment is done, we 
should carry a 1 to the next position to the left; unfortunately, 
that next position doesn't exist! 

This is where the carry bit of the status regfister is used 
again. Before, it was used in the compare operations (CMP, 
for instance), but, as it happens, it is also conditioned by the 
next command, ADC. This stands for add with carry. When 
the next step is done using an ADC command, things will look 
like this: 

Carry 

$100 256 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 

The byte has returned to a value of 0 and the carry bit is set 
to a 1. 

We discussed the wrap-around to zero earlier, with the In- 
crement/decrement commands, but we didn't mention the

carry. That's because the INC/DEC commands don't affect 
the carry flag. 

However, the ADC command does set the carry flag. The 
carry will be set whenever the result of the addition is greater 
than $FF. With the ADC, you can'hiake your counters incre- 
ment by values other than one — rather like the FOR I = 1 to 10 
STEP 5 statement in Basic. But ADC is used more often for 
general math operations, such as calculating new addresses or 
screen positions, among a vidde variety of other applications. 

Whenever ADC is used, the value indicated is added to the 
contents of the accumulator. The value can be stated either di- 
rectly by use of a immediate value or with an indirect value as 
you've done previously with commands such as LDA. 

Important Note: ADC only sets the carry if there is an 
overflow past $FF. It does not clear it (set it to zero) if the re- 
sult is $FF or less. Also, you'll notice that ADC did stand for 
add with carry. This means that if the carry bit is set before 
the addition, an extra unit will be added along with the value 
you wanted. This is to accommodate two-bji;e numbers such as 
addresses, which will be discussed shortly. 

Example : 

Accumulator Value Carry Set? Result 

$80 $05 no (0) $85 

$80 $05 yes (1) $86 

What all this means is that the carry bit must be cleared be- 
fore the ADC operation. The command for this is CLC, for 
clear carry. 

Here are some sample programs for using the ADC. Note 
the use of the CLC before each ADC.

In the first two programs the value in Nl is added to the 
contents of Nl and the immediate value $80. Note the CLC be- 
fore the ADC to ensure an accurate result. This result is then 
returned in location $0A. This routine could be used as a sub- 
routine for another machine language program, or it could 
called from Basic after passing the values to locations 6 and 8. 

The latter two progframs are a more elaborate example 
where the indirect modes are used to find the value from a

table starting at $300. In program 3, an index value is passed to 
location $08. That is used as an offset via the X register. In pro- 
gram 4, the low-order and high-order bytes for the address $300 
are first put in a pair of pointer bytes ($1E,$1F) and the offset 
is put in the Y register. 

The main disadvantage to all these programs is that we're 
limited to one-byte values for both the original values and the 
result of the addition. 

The solution is to use the carry flag to create a two-byte ad- 
dition routine. Here's an example :

Notice that Nl, N2, and RSLT are all two-byte numbers, 
with the second byte of each pair being used for the high-order 
byte. This allows us to use values and results from $00 to 
$FFFF (0 to 65535) . This is sufficient for any address in the 
Apple II, although, by using three or more bytes, we could ac- 
commodate numbers much larger than $FFFF. 

A few words of explanation about this program. First, the 
CLC has been moved to the beginning of the routine. Although 
it need only precede the ADC command, it has no effect on the 
LDA, so it is put at the beginning of the routine for aesthetic 
purposes. It also helps identify the overall unit as a math 
routine. Once the two low-order bytes of Nl and N2 are added 
and the partial result stored, the high-order bytes are added. If 
an overflow was generated in the first addition, the carry will 
be set and an extra unit added in the second addition. Note that 
the carry remains unaffected during the LDA NH-l operation. 

The monitor listing is given for this one so that you can^ 
enter it and then call it from this Basic program :

zero. Although there are conventions for handling negative 
numbers, this routine is not that sophisticated. 

Many times, the number being added to a base address is 
known always to be $FF or less, so only one byte for N2 is 
needed. A two/one addition routine looks like this :

For speed, if a carry isn't generated on line 14, the pro- 
gram skips directly to the end. If, however, the carry is set, the 
value in Nl+1 gets incremented by one, even though the ADC 
says an immediate $00. The $00 acts as a dummy value to allow 
the carry to do its job. If speed is not a concern, the BCXi; can 
even be left out with no ill effect. Program 5C shows an alter- 
nate method using the INC command. In this case, the BCC is 
required for proper operation. 

Subtraction. Subtraction is done like addition except that a bor- 
row is required. Rather than using a separate flag for this 
operation, the computer recognizes the carry as sort of a re- 
verse borrow. 

That is, a set carry flag will be treated by the subtract com- 
mand as a clear borrow (no borrow taken) ; a clear carry as a 
set borrow (borrow unit taken). 

The command for subtraction is SBC, for subtract with 
carry. The borrow is cleared with the command SEC, for set 
carry. (Remember, things are backward here). A subtraction 
equivalent of program 5A looks like this:

The program can be called with the same Basic program 
we used for the addition routine (program 5 A) . 

These two simple ideas will prove very valuable and are 
well worth the time to master. With these, you have enough 
commands to write a great many programs. In fact, some 
popular commercial programs can be assembled using just 
the commands you've learned so far. To show the power of 
what's been learned, next month I'll concentrate on a specific 
application (disk access via RWTS) to provide some solid ex- 
amples of what can be done with these commands.

Compu T Party! 




It's a hot summer day and you are driving down California 
Interstate 8 counting the sheeplike power-line towers and try- 
ing not to doze off. A scruffy looking, tattooed biker zooms by 
wearing a T-shirt with Biff Bludgeon and the Ice Crushers 
printed on it. Your tires screeching, you barely miss hitting the 
car in front of you. On the bumper of that car is a thin rec- 
tangular sticker that asks you to "Honk If You Love Parsley." 

Later in the week, you are walking through Manhattan's 
Central Park on your way to the Plaza Hotel. You run head- 
long into a brown-haired goddess wearing a T-shirt that de- 
clares : "CXir Computers Put Out." You ask her if she'd like an 
ice cream cone, but she's heard that line before. 

Walking away broken-hearted, you realize that people are 
trying to communicate something to you. 

The Voice of the Chest. Entirely visual forms of commu- 
nication abound in our society. By looking at a person's house. 



car, attire, and place of employment, you can glean a certain 
amount of information. Looking, it must be noted, is a poor 
substitute for the real thing: a one-on-one dialogue. 

Nonetheless, one highly specialized form of visual com- 
munication, like the bumper sticker and the tattoo, is the T- 
shlrt. 

Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defines a T-shirt as a 
"collarless short-sleeved or sleeveless cotton undershirt for 
men" or "a cotton or wool Jersey outer shirt of similar de- 
sign." 

This story concerns T-shirts that have ironed, printed, or 
scrawled on them something to do with computers. In other 
words, computer T-shirts. 

But first, a little history. 

A Backward Glance. It is well documented in Turkey Mc- 
Nugget's Cotton Comes to Town: A Brief History of T-Shirts 



that, In 2750 B.C., King Sargon of the Sumerian Akkadian Em- 
pire had painted on his battle shield in the Semitic alphabet : 
"Mediterranean Sea or Bust." This is the first major example 
of a slogan being communicated visually with the use of some- 
one's daily accouterments. 

In 521 B.C., King Darius failed to vanquish the Scythians be- 
fore exhausting his supplies and army. One night, without in- 
forming the victims, he took his army and left the sick and 
wounded in the camp to fool the Scythians, making good his es- 
cape. Broken-bodied, but not broken in spirit, those left behind 
wore shirts with "I Survived the Great Fink Out" em- 
broidered on them. This is one of the most dramatic early ex- 
amples of commemorating an event on apparel. 

McNugget is full of examples of early T-shirt history. 

In 751 A.D., Pepin Martel got the go-ahead nod from the 
Pope and emblazoned on his armor, "Try Pepin, the Real 
King." Moving from kingly advertising to simple declarative 
statements, we can find Cardinal Mazarln touting his philos- 
phy during off hours in a black tanktop with "Machiavellians 
Rule" stitched in white on it. 

McNugget also makes clear that esoteric messages have 
found their ways onto people's backs. A serious John Milton 
boasted, "I FWed the Infernal Serpent" on his. 

In the 1760s, people were confused by James Watt, father of 
the steam engine, sporting on the back of his waistcoat the 
phrase, "I'd Rather Be Sailing." He was prophetic in many 
ways. 

Facetious and deliberate confusing of messages in a clever 
and humorous fashion is evident in Charles Darwin's classic 
rib, "Never Give an Ape an Even Break." 

A rare item from the early years of this century is a shirt 



fivDAYiD mt\m 



meant to glorify what turned out to be the Wright Brothers' 
biggest failure. The blue cotton shirt has a two-color illustra- 
tion and the catchy line, 'You'll Believe an Elephant Can Ride 
a Bike." 

Finally, we come to Immanuel Velikovsky. In support of his 
incredible theories concerning Mars and Venus being shot 
from the Red Spot of Jupiter into their present orbits, he had 
"You've Come a Long Way, Venus" printed on his T-shirt. 

So much for a little history. 

Seriously, folks. As king and cardinal of old declared their 
viewpoints on their chests, so do millions of people today. The 
variety of messages found on human fronts and backs is stag- 
gering. T-shirts glorify just about everything. 

For the Aficionado. To get back on the track, the best place 
to look for computer T-shirts is at a computer convention. 
These gatherings offer a gluttonous concentration of even the 
most esoteric devils— T-shirts unavailable in any store or from 
any company. Prospective T-shirt wearers can get good ideas 
for custom designs by merely walking around with their eyes 
open. 

Getting a custom design pressed or silk-screened on a sin- 
gle T-shirt costs anywhere from $7 to $15, depending on how 
fancy you want to get. You can cut down the cost by supplying 
your own unadorned T-shirt. 

For those too lazy to make their own, here are brief de- 
scriptions of shirts available from some of your favorite soft- 
ware companies. 

T-8hlrt Shopper. Creative Computing, 39 East Hanover 
Avenue, Morris Plains, NJ 07960, offers eight different com- 
puter T-shirts, decorated with everything from the company 
name over a computer portrait of Albert Einstein to the Pro- 
gram Bug from the book Katie and the Computer. Specify S, 
M, L, XL, or children's sizes. Shirts are $6 plus $.76 handling. 
Two or more shirts can be charged to VISA, MasterCard, and 
American Express.

From the novice to the professional, Apple-Doc more than pays for itself in 
time savings alone! You can change any element throughout the listing 
almost as easily as changing a single line. Apple-Ooc includes Variable 
Xref which creates a table of every variable used in a program, every line 
occurence of the variable, and lets you create your own variable descrip- 
tors which con be stored in a separate disk file. Line Number Xref creates a 
table of every line in the program called by a GOTO, GOSUB, etc., and all 
lines each is called from Any reference to a line not present is specifically 
flagged for your attention Constant Xre( is similar but documents all 
numeric constants — great for scientific and business uses. With Replace 
you can easily rename any or all occurrences of any variable making it 
indispensible for custom programming. Finally. Lister creates a professional 
program listing with top. bottom. & left margins quickly defined. Our all- 
time best seller! 
Price: S34.95 on disk 

LIST MASTER 

List Master, an excellent companion to Apple-Doc, provides a number of 
utilities for performing large scale changes to your program listing in a high- 
speed and automatic way List Master includes Applespeed which can 
remove I^EMarks, shorten variable names, combine lines, and renumbers 
by I s in any Applesoft" program. Smart Renumber not only renumbers but 
also gives you the option of preserving logical blocks of line numbers you 
hove established for various routines thereby retaining the original logic 
and workability in the renumbered program. Also contains merge routines 
that allow you to quote blocks of lines from one part of the program to 
another and automatically renumber appropriate line references. Comp- 
list compares any two Applesoft or integer programs and lists any lines 
added, deleted or changed.

Left to right, top: Robot Rabbit and Computer Bum from Creative Computing; the 
original Apple shirt. Bottom: Broderbund mascot shirt; custom-pointed Tempting Ap- 
ples shirt; Sirius's Space Eggs iron-on ironed on. 

Rainbow Computing, 9719 Reseda Boulevard, Northridge, 
CA 91324, offers a shirt with the curious "Our Computers Put 
Out" on the front and the company's colorful rainbow logo on 
the back. Shirts come in S, M, L, XL, and children's sizes, at $5 
plus $2 handling. 

Shirts in myriad colors from Broderbund, Box 3266, Eu- 
gene, OR 97403, show the company's mascot in a karate pose 
with "Always Wear Software" positioned underneath. Broder- 
bund's shirts are $6.95 plus $1 handling and come in S, M, L, 
and XL; VISA or MasterCard okay. 

"I Survived the Night at Mystery House," announce the 
shirts from On-Line Systems, 36757 Mudge Ranch Road, 
Coarsegold, CA 93614, embellished by a reproduction of the 
eerie old mansion you've seen in their ads. "Hi-Res Adventure 
by On-Line" is the message for those walking behind you. Same 
sizes, several colors, all for $6, nada for handling. 

Sirius Software suggests you celebrate victories, but they 
don't actually sell a T-shirt. Instead, they give each piorchaser 
of Space Eggs a decal that you can iron onto your own shirt 
and thereafter put the world on notice with, "I Fried the Space 
Eggs," surrounded by some of that game's nasty little crit- 
ters. 

C.A.S.H. (Computer Assisted Shirt Hucksters), 155 Yale 
Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, offers a handsome shirt com- 
memorating the sixth annual West Coast Computer Faire. 
Standard sizes, $8. 

From Apple Computer Inc. come two styles of T-shirt for 
adults or children without a written word on them. Base shirts 
come in several colors. In the old style, each shirt is adorned 
simply with a large rainbow-colored bitten Apple apple. Prices 
range from $5.96 to $7.95 depending on size. The new style 
shows a smaller apple to one side of the front on an Apple rain- 
bow of stripes that gird the chest. Women's sizes are $9; chil- 
dren's and men's, $7. Many Apple dealers carry these or can 
order them for you. 

There are dozens — maybe hundreds — of computer-related 
T-shirts to be found if you keep your eyes open. 

Users Speak. Why wear a computer T-shirt? George 
Snoozeoff of Slipshod Software commented, "I want people to 
know exactly where I'm coming from." 

Beer B. Ash of Moonshine Computing offers that "It's a 
great way to meet women programmers in the local bars." 

Figby Leaf boasts, "It's the only thing I'll wear." 

Patsy Coder claims it's terrific for breaking the ice at a 
party or in the library, but she advises, "Don't ever wear them 
in local bars." 

Whatever one's reasons, it cannot be denied that T-shirts go 
hand-in-hand with summer. The weather's warm, the trees are 
in bloom, school's out, and vacation time is in the air. 

Summer's here and the time is right for wearing computer 
T-shirts.

Turn your Apple into the world's 
most versatile personal computer. 



The SoftCard™ Solution. SoftCard 
turns your Apple into two computers. 
A Z-80 and a 6502. By adding a Z-80 
microprocessor and CP/M to your 
Apple, SoftCard turns your Apple into 
a CP/M based machine. That means 
you can access the single largest body 
of microcomputer software in exist- 
ence. Two computers in one. And, the 
advantages of both. 

Plug and go. The SoftCard system 
starts with a Z-80 based circuit card. 
Just plug it into any slot (except 0) of 
your Apple. No modifications required.

SOFTALK INTERVIEW: WADE and NANCY HARRIS 

a candid conversation with a couple about their much maligned occupation 
and the impact of computer technology on their business and family. 



News travels fast in this competitive industry. Author Jim 
Salmons had just left his position in marketing management 
with a major software publisher in Baltimore to start his oum 
business. We understood his desire to explore innovative mi- 
crocomputer marketing strategies; but wouldn't he have to 
pay the bills until his own business became profitable? So, 
when the Softalk data base of interesting people doing unusual 
things with their Apples turned up Wade and Nancy Harris, a 
couple in the chimney sweeping business in Ellicott City, 
Maryland, we called Salmons. After feigning, "Let me see if I 
can work this into my busy schedule, " he jumped at the chance 
to make some spare change. Here is Salmons's report: 

"Somewhere between chimes and chimpanzees I found 
them: chimney sweeps. An even dozen sources were cited in 
the subject index at the Eisenhower Library of Johns Hopkins 
University. A good investigative reporter does homework be- 
fore raking muck or, in my case, soot. 

"Sure, Softalk wants a cutesy Us-and-Our- Apple profile of 
this couple using their computer in an unusual business. But 
what about those saltpeter-scabbed knees and elbows of the 
consumptive innocent climbing boys whose flue-scraping la- 
bors are repaid by abuse and neglect at the hands of their sa- 
distic masters. Was Dickens's Oliver Twist to be the last ex- 
pose on these occupational abuses? Or would we have to wait 
till the evening news brings us live coverage of the indelicate 
recovery of the suffocated body of a child forced up a too-nar- 
row flue? 

"My resurrected bleeding heart surged with the adrena- 
line of moral outrage. The sudden flow of blood to my head re- 
freshed memories of my early investigative interview train- 
ing in journalism school — not my professors' lectures on pyra- 
mid writing style, but the subliminal training from obligatory 
scans of Playboy interviews before copiously studying details 
of the photographic art. 

"These interviews cut below the surface, providing psy- 
chosocial insights into the souls of the interviewees. The good 
apples show as good; the bad, rotten . . . all in their oum words. 
This would be the gauntlet to which I would subject Wade and 
Nancy Harris. And this is how I found myself in the bowels of 
Hopkins Library on a glorious Baltimore Memorial Day week- 
end. 



"A quick scan of the scant literature confirmed my worst 
fears. Only one contemporary author had seen fit to follow up 
on this significant social disgrace of the early nineteenth cen- 
tury. The abuses of the English and European sweeps had been 
well chronicled a century earlier but none since until, in 1957, 
George Lewis Phillips published his scathing historical ex- 
pose, American Chimney Sweeps (The Past Times Press, 
Trenton, NJ ). For more than a century we had hidden this ugly 
thread under our colonial round-braid carpets until Phillips 
had the courage to weave it back into the fabric of our Ameri- 
can collective consciousness. Unfortunately, his book didn't 
make it to paperback; consequently, we didn't see these tid- 
bits on television's 'Bicentennial Minutes.' 

"Fire was a major environmental hazard in most colonial 
towns. The log and thatch houses huddled together to afford 
protection from Indian attack were volatile prey to any blaze 
started by a careless neighbor's chimney fire. The cure, hud- 
dled houses, was worse than the disease, Indian attack. 

"So combustible a hazard were these unplanned communi- 
ties that the local governing councils took it upon themselves to 
create subsidized positions called town master sweeps. It was 
as if the councils thought giving an official title to the job would 
erase the social stigma chimney sweeping carried in the minds 
of the early settlers who had witnessed scandal and degrada- 
tion within the trade before coming to the New World. In a land 
where there were so few people for too many jobs, would you 
expect anyone to volunteer for a job for which your neighbors 
hated you and in which a major occupational health hazard 
was cancer of the scrotum? 

"So it was in 1662 when the toum fathers of Salem, Massa- 
chusetts, appointed John Milke the first American town mas- 
ter sweep. He and others in similar positions in other colonial 
toums were empowered to obtain fees for services rendered as 
well as to fine neighbors whp harbored dirty flues. This en- 
viable catch-22 of inspector/contractor was not enough to over- 
come the degrading work and social rejection, so many mas- 
ter sweep positions went unfilled. 

"For nearly a century, the houses burned while most toums 
constantly advertised for sweeps in the help-wanted sections of 
the early colonial press. Some towns even foreshadowed the 
draft and jury duty by passing legislation appointing sweeps 




"If one of the little beggars balks, 
I jxist give htm a shot to the buns 
unth this. That gets them up the 
chimney. " 



"This is the soot the boys coughed 
up onto the keyboard when we 
invited them in from the shed to 
play Space E^g^s. " 



"When the boys are too sick to 
work, I tie a rope around the neck 
of a goose and drop it doum the 
chimney, like this."

"The boys seem to last longer if 
we hose them doum once a month 
or so, unless it's below freezing in 
the shed. ..."

by lottery. Only the wealthiest citizens could afford the pro- 
hibitive fine for refusing the appointment. 

"Other toivns encouraged private sector sweep monopolies 
i)i which the sweep ventures split fees and fines with the toivn 
treasu7-y. The monopolies were allowed to establish their own 
collection agencies; the collectors were as large as the climb- 
ing boys were small. 

"In some lucky towns, there were some unlucky souls who 
couldn't make it at any other trade, so they took up chimney 
sweeping. While working conditions were poor, the pay was 
worse. Many made ends meet by moonlighting as carpet beat- 
ers, white washers, wood choppers, even cesspool emptiers. 

"In rural towns too small to attract their own sweeps, a 
rather foul method of chimney cleaning developed. One sim- 
ply tied a rope around the neck of a large goose, dropped the 
bird down the chimney, pulled it back up, and repeated the op- 
eration several times. The distressed bird's flapping wings 
loosened the soot. The blacker the bird, the cleaner the flue. 
This method gave new meaning in colonial times to the age-old 
expression, 'Wanna get goosed?' 

"Other sweeping methods were less flamboyant. In the ear- 
liest times, colonial houses were one story high with large 
diameter chimneys. For these, a sweep had only to stand on a 
ladder and use a long handled broom. At these homes, master 
sweeps were notorious for saying such things as, 'Hey, I'll bet 
TB really takes it out of you. Why don't you take a breather. I'll 
get this one and you can do the next. ' 

"Of course, the next was invariably a newer, multistoried 
residence where unschooled builders constructed the most con- 
voluted flues imaginable. For these, the master would suggest 
that the climbing boy, with scraper and broom in hand, crawl 
up the flue to clean it. These suggestions took the form of swift 
kicks or pin pricks to the boy's bottom. If a boy became stuck 
in a flue, masters found that a small straw fire in the hearth 
had a persuasive effect in coaxing the boy up and out. 

"If a chimney was particularly narrow, the boys got a rest. 
A canvas bag of bricks or a bundle of sticks was forced through 
the flue. This urban variation on the goose method was more 



humane but less effective. In this and all cleaning methods, the 
master pinned a blanket across the hearth so as not to soil the 
homeoumer's rooms and furnishings. 

"At the end of a job, the climbing boys gathered all the de- 
bris in the blanket to take back to their shed. There they sifted 
cinders from the soot to sell as fertiliser. They were then al- 
lowed to sleep, unwashed, in the shed, using the hearth blanr 
ket to protect against the cold 

"If this sounds scandalous, it actually became worse. 
America's most heinous management solution to the need for 
rapid national growth was the unconscionable acceptance and 
exploitation of slavery as a labor source. All manner of work 
considered too disgusting for 'humans' was relegated to black 
slaves. 

"And so it was that, for almost a century, white America's 
chimneys were cleaned by black climbing boys. With the in- 
vestment they had in the developing society, it was little won- 
der that the blacks were notoriously ineffective sweeps. Un- 
fortunately, it also explains the blind spot America had to the 
growing social consciousness that rose against the abuses of 
the trade in England and Europe. 

"In the late eighteenth century, Jonas Hanway was instru- 
mental informing a society to lobby against labor abuses and 
lobby for support of technological developments to replace 
climbing boys. There was no comparable organised group in 
America, though isolated humanitarians did show some con- 
cern. 

"An example of 'reform' in American trade comes from 
my hometoum of Baltimore. In the 1190s, a white master 
sweep, John Conrad Zollikoffer, advertised in the Baltimore 
Daily Repository that parents consider indenturing their sons 
as sweeps for a period of five to seven years. In return, at the 
end of their servitude, Zollikoffer would finance the boys' train- 
ing to enter more elevated professions. Come on, John, after 
kicking these kids' butts up and doum the flues of Baltimore's 
rowhouses for seven years, did you really expect any of them 
to have the vigor to enter vocational school? 

"So it was until mid nineteenth century, when the first era

of American chimney sweeping technology was ushered in. By 
1830, at least six patent applications for sweep devices were 
pending. Some were original devices, others were variations 
on the Smart and Glass devices invented in England in the late 
1700s. Master sweeps who incorporated these devices into their 
work were called fluonomists, technological sweepers. The 
transition between old and new was rocky, in-fighting and pro- 
fessional jealousy abounded. 

"And here is where the literature breaks down. Phillips's 
book was a recent addition, but it was purely an historical 
retrospective. What's needed is an investigative report. What's 
happening out there in A merica 's chimneys ? Have the techno- 
logical innovations been incorporated into the sweep trade? Or 
is America still harboring wasted, abused children in the hid- 
den sheds of alleged good citizen master sweeps? Are Apple- 
using Wade and Nancy Harris cyberfluonomists or debased 
climbing boy molesters? 

"With these questions burning, I arrived in Ellicott City, a 
quaint town frozen in time, nestled between the throbbing me- 
tropolis of Baltimore and the pristine crispness of Columbia, 
urban developer James Rouse's vision of the city of the future. 
As I walked the streets, the sense of beauty and history almost 
distracted me frora my purpose: I was about to rip the lid off 
this lazy burg and expose the maniacs in its midst. ..." 
WADEt Hey, what the . . . You down by the shed, may I help 
you? 

SOFTALK: Oh ... a ... Hi! Jim Salmons, Softalk magazine. You 
must be Wade Harris. 
WADEi Right. 

SOFTALKi We talked earlier about doing an interview, remem- 
ber? I know this looks funny, me breaking in your shed and all. 
But I dropped a penny when I got out of the car and it rolled 
down here, so. . . . 
WADEi It rolled through the grass? 

SOFTALKi . . . Yeah, ah, well it was only a penny. . . . Say, how 
about we go on in the house ; I'd like to talk and meet the rest of 
the Harris clan. [I'll get photos of the wasted little climbing 
beggars later.] 



WADEi Sure. Can I get you anything? Iced tea, soda, beer? You 
must be tired after your ride. . . . 

SOFTALKi [So it was. I got inside and what I thought was going 
to be a huge scandal turned out to be a fascinating discussion 
with what, in many ways, was a typical suburban American 
family. What wasn't so typical was the sideline they chose for 
making extra money and the fact that they are experiencing 
the excitement of becoming microcomputer literate together.] 
SOFTALKi Thanks, Wade, for holding up those props and read- 
ing the little quotes for the photo teasers. I'm sure they will at- 
tract a lot of readers. Now, could you introduce your family? 
WADEi My son, Mark, is fourteen and he's been helping me 
ever since I started this part-time business three years ago. He 
helps me carry equipment, hands me brushes, helps me in and 
out of the air respirator and long gloves, sets up the vacuum, 
and now he even cleans some of the easier chimneys and fire- 
places. 

Nancy holds down the operation back home, answering the 
phone, setting schedules, keeping the business records. In a 
service business like this, your customer contact is critical. 
She does a great job in a professional and pleasant manner. 
SOFTALKi I can attest to that. Nancy, you were most helpful in 
arranging this interview. 

NANCYi We're really excited about being in the magazine. 
SOFTALKi You mentioned that this is a part-time business, but 
it sounds like full-family involvement. 

WADEi Yes. It's part-time work for all three of us. And during 
our main season from about Labor Day till Christmas, I guar- 
antee we collectively put in a hundred hours a week or more. 
Nancy has even gone part-time with her office job in an insur- 
ance company. 

NANCYi Right. Sometimes it gets to be a hectic home around 
here. Come Labor Day, the phone starts ringing. We have to 
turn work away. Some people get frustrated when we put them 
on a seven-week waiting list, but there's a limit to how many 
chimneys we can clean. So I only schedule so many a week. 
WADEi It's about fifteen tops on weeks when I work my regu- 
lar job. In the fall, when I take most of my vacation time to

sweep, we do many more. It's still less than the demand. I 
could probably hire and train some helpers and make it a full- 
time family-run business. But that's not our goal. 

I work for the government in the procurement of main- 
frame computer systems for health care agencies. It's satisfy- 
ing head-type work . . . and I've built up about twenty years of 
government service and benefits, which are tough to give up. 

Sweeping is different. I really enjoy the physical aspects. 
There's something very satisfying about the activity and the 
sense of accomplishment when I see the difference an hour and 
a half of my work can make. The funny thing is, while it looks 
like one of the dirtiest jobs around, it's more appearance than 
reality. Those climbing boys you mentioned could have been 
clean as a whistle every night, it was just that the sanitary con- 
ditions provided them were so poor. I shower and it just melts 
away down the drain. My clothes clean easily too. 
NANCY: So it's no big messy problem around the house. I find 
the contact with the customers and the administrative work 
challenging, yet I have time for some of my own interests . . . 
especially cooking, my biggest hobby. 

The name of our business is Top Hat Chimney Sweeping, so 
many of our first-time customers call and want to know if we 
wear the hats and tails or if it's just a name. When I tell them 
it's for real, they schedule right away, especially if they have 
children. 

MARKs People seem to have a real curiosity about us. The hats 
probably increase the attention we attract. 
WADEi I believe if you're going to be a chimney sweep you 
should wear the hat. It's tradition and a trade superstition to 
bring good luck. So when I started the business I decided I was 
going to wear the hat and, in cooler weather, tails, regardless 
of what people might think. And you know, it's the cheapest 
and most effective form of advertising I've found. 
SOFTALKi How much of a factor have the energy crisis and in- 
creased awareness of alternative energy sources been to your 
business?

the reason I got into it. When the cost of heating this house went 
up so much, I bought a wood stove inset for the family room 
fireplace almost five years ago. Wood stoves are much more 
efficient in heating the home, but they make the chimney 
much dirtier. Heat stays in the house rather than going up the 
flue where it would burn off the condensed chemicals resulting 
from wood combustion. So it's much more important to clean 
your chimney regularly if you have a wood- burning stove. 

Research shows the heat of a chimney fire can exceed three 
thousand degrees, which can easily set the rest of your house 
on fire. And sure enough, after the first year of using the stove, 
my chimney was extremely dirty. The closest sweep I found 
was in Baltimore City, and he had a backlog of several months. 



"Apple . . . offered far more than any of its 
competition." 



So, I figured there would be more and more folks in my situa- 
tion and that sweeping might be an up and coming business. 

While looking into the subject, I learned of Black Magic 
Chimney Sweeping School in Stowe, Vermont. They have an in- 
tensive training program and they sell the equipment you 
need. They also help you set up a business. People from all 
over the country go there to learn the trade. There was even a 
sweep working out of Alabama in my class of eighteen. You get 
to know each other after a week of walking on steep New En- 
gland roofs. I still keep in touch with some of them. We even 
have our own trade journal, The Chimney Sweep Times. And 
there's a National Chimney Sweep Guild that I belong to. 
We're a kind of subculture. 

NANCYt When Wade went down to place a newspaper ad, the 
editors were very interested since they had never run an ad for 
a local chimney sweep. 

WADEi So instead of running the ad, they did a feature story 
about us. 

MARKi And the rest is history. The phone started ringing and 
hasn't stopped yet. 

NANCYt That really got us started. We put in the business 
phone, the answering machine, had brochures printed, and all. 
WADEi We just didn't realize it was going to grow as quickly as 
it did. 

SOFTALKi You've mentioned growth, but you haven't told us 
how your Apple figures into the business. Can I venture a wild 
guess that, like most growing businesses, your need for organ- 
ization and efficiency created a need for the computer? 
WADEi Right. I've mentioned the heavy seasonal aspect of this 
work. In the fall, we often have more than a hundred cus- 
tomers on the waiting list. It was very difficult coordinating all 
that paperwork. Sure enough, we started messing up — losing 
track of customers. I was rionning all over the county like a 
chicken with its head cut off. 

So I realized we needed help. Either we needed a time- 
share computer service four months out of the year or — well, 
I'd heard of these new small computers like Apple and the 
TRS-80. So I started shopping around. I quickly focused on the 
microcomputer alternative because it looked like a wondrous 
instrument for keeping track of scheduling and expenses. I 
picked the Apple because I felt it offered far more than any of 
its competition. 

While I knew a lot about what big computers could do in 
terms of massive data processing systems, I wasn't too famil- 
iar with what the small ones could do. So the salesman showed 
me the simple data base system. File Cabinet, that you get free 
when you buy your computer. It comes in the contributed soft- 
ware. In fact, that's what I currently use almost exclusively 
for keeping records. 

NANCYi It's beautiful for what we do. After Wade shopped 
around, he took me to the store and showed me what we would

be getting. The computer was a lot different from what I ex- 
pected, but I could see that it would be a big help, especially 
since I was coping with most of the headaches resulting from 
fast growth. 

WADE: First, we entered all our pending customers. I came up 
with a record format including standard things like name and 
address. Then, we started tracking when folks called, when we 
made appointments, and any helpful notes about the cus- 
tomers' chimneys. 

But the absolutely most helpful thing I did was to go 
through my entire customer base and assign neighborhood 
codes. Cleaning the chimney takes a fixed amount of time, but 
travel is variable between jobs. So I knew I could do more 
chimneys if I could schedule jobs closer together. 

Now, if I have a commitment to clean a chimney on a Sat- 
urday in East Columbia, I just do a search of my computer rec- 
ords for EC code. I take care of the longest pending ones first, 
then fill my day out by arranging jobs near these commit- 
ments. 

NANCYi It sounds simple, but it works. Wade's averaging about 
one more chimney a day since we started with the computer. 
Now our travel expenses are down, and I don't have to deal 
with frustrated customers because we don't lose them any- 
more. And happy customers are critical to this business since 
so much work comes by word of mouth. 
WADEi That was our first application. Of course, we've ex- 
panded our uses. We now keep all our records for taxes and ac- 
counting purposes on the computer. Our family payroll is on 
the Apple. That's what we've done so far with our II Plus, disk 
drive, and television. 

SOFTALKi And what does the future hold for the business appli- 
cations of your system? 

WADEi You noted that we don't have a printer. That's because I 
had a tip on the new Epson sheet and form feed printer that is 
just now coming out. That's the one I want. I couldn't see 
spending more for one of the superduper printers than I had 
spent on the whole system, so I've been waiting. The Epson 
will be just right for what we want to do. 



T A L 1^ JULY 1981 

As soon as we get that, we'll do several things. We'll gen- 
erate our invoices through the system. In fact, I've started 
learning to program in Applesoft, and I'm writing an invoice 
program now. 

Then I intend to go strictly to direct mail advertising. In th6 
three years we've been working, we now have a past customer 
base of close to a thousand. 

NANCYs Some of those have become regular customers, but a 
lot more of them could be if we followed up more effectively. 
WADEi We want to smooth out our season work flow. We get all 
the business we can handle in the fall, but at other times of the 
year it's slow. By using direct mail, with special pricing and 
refer-a-friend coupons, I believe we can build up our regular 

"We're liable to have his-and-her computers 
before too long." 

customer base. This would save the fall for concentrating on 
servicing new prospects who can then be encouraged to shift to 
regular customer status for cleaning during the slower times 
of the year. 

I can pretty accurately determine when a regular cus- 
tomer will need a sweep. I'll be using a form letter capability to 
remind them it's time to call me. I'll be cranking those letters 
out as soon as I get the printer. 

NANCYi Once the printer goes in, it's going to be even harder 
for me to get to the Apple. We're liable to have his-and-her 
computers before too long! 

I told you I really like to cook. Well, I'm working on setting 
up a disk file of all my recipes. I want to be able to cross-refer- 
ence them so I can find things quickly and easily. So many of 
my friends ask for copies of my dishes — soon I'll be able to zip 
a recipe off the Apple when someone asks for it. It'll be great — 
a tremendous timesaver for me . . . besides wowing my 
friends. The computer is still a stranger to almost all of them. 
MARKi — except the kids in the neighborhood who love to play 
games. You would think my friends figure our house is an ar- 
cade. I even had to tell one friend the computer broke to get a 
rest from him coming over to play Invaders. 
SOFTALKi Yes, I remember that scenario when our family was 
one of the first to get a color television. 
NANCYi Right. Between the neighbors' kids and Mark starting 
to learn to program at school and using the Apple for his home- 
work, we have to schedule time for each of us to get a chance to 
use it. This business computer has really become a business 
and home computer. It's something I never dreamed of. But 
the longer it's here, the more uses we find for it. So we're not 
kidding when we joke about needing more than one. 
MARKi I'd like one totally to myself. In school, we're getting 
more time on computers and learning more about them all the 
time. 

WADEi — I think he still puts golf and girls ahead of computers. 
It's amazing how the local school system is bringing compu- 
ters into the curriculum. These kids will have grown up on 
them. It's very exciting. Here I've worked with the old main- 
frames for so long, and this stuff is new even to me. I never 
dreamed we would have so much computing power at home in 
my lifetime. 

SOFTALKi I can see you're all hooked. It's fascinating what 
you're doing as a family. An exotic family business and pio- 
neers of personal computing, right here in EUicott City. 
Thanks for being so cooperative. Any closing comments? 
WADEi Well, if folks would like to know more about their chim- 
neys and fireplaces, the bible is The Wood Burner's Encyclo- 
pedia by Jay Shelton, a Dell paperback. If they want to know 
more about computers, they should head down to their local 
Apple dealer. 

NANCYi We're glad we did. 
MARKi For sure.

Apple Writer Extended Features. By 

Paul Malachowski and Kevin Cooper. 
When a useful software package is un- 
protected, creative minds will find ways 
to make that package even more useful. 
Sometimes they'll share their methods 
with the rest of us. 

That's what Brillig Systems has done in 
the Apple Writer Extended Features 
package. Apple Writer lacks some of the 
power of more recent word processors, 
but it's unlocked. Consequently, pro- 
grams such as Graphtrix by Data Trans- 
forms could be developed to increase the 
power and value of Apple Writer by en- 
abling you to format your Apple Writer 
files with chapter titles and running 
heads and to include graphics in your re- 
ports, calling graphic figures directly 
from Apple Writer to be printed at the 
first appropriate place in the text after 
their first mention. 

Now Brillig's Extended Features en- 
ables you to capture just about anything 
into an Apple Writer file for easy proces- 
sing and to do all sorts of things with 
those or any other Apple Writer files. In 
addition, these utilities make it possible 
to produce multiple copies of Apple 
Writer files and to insert variables in 
those copies ; one use of this feature is the 
printing of personalized form letters — 
from Apple Writer. 

If you write programs rather than 
form letters, this package's utility for 
capturing Applesoft programs on the 
word processor is worth the price of the 
whole package. Once your progfram is in 
Apple Writer, you can edit single charac- 
ters instead of full lines, change variable 
names, find specific GOTOs and 
GOSUBs or all of them in context. When 
you're satisfied, a simple procedure con- 
verts your file back to a program. 

One of the features of Extended Fea- 
tures is the ease of using them. Some pro- 
cedures require several programs to 
complete ; Brillig has provided exec files 
that handle all these details. When you 
want to convert one kind of file to an- 
other, you just make sure your choosing 
the correct conversion and say EXEC 
that procedure; the program takes care 
of the manipulations after that. 

Specifically, Apple Writer Extended 
Features contains programs: to convert 
text files to Apple Writer files and Apple 
Writer files (binary) to text files; to con- 
vert Applesoft programs to Apple Writer 
files and vice versa; to edit a DOS text 
file to easily create and change exec 
files; and to print the text file produced 
by the print time exit procedure. 

In addition, a print time exit provides 



the ability to underscore and use a bar in 
Apple Writer; The generation of hex 
characters for enhanced mode printing; 
the ability to send all printed output to 
disk instead of to the printer; and the 
ability to override the fill justify mode of 
Apple Writer when you like. 

As a bonus, Brillig has included a pro- 
gram to intercept the reset key with auto- 
start ROM. 

The convenience of the facilities pro- 
vided by Apple Writer with the Apple 
Writer Extended Features might well 
justify the purchase of Apple Writer it- 
self, if you haven't already got it, just to 
be able to use these utilities. n(T

The Warp Factor. By Paul Murray. Pa- 
tience is not only a virtue, it's a require- 
ment for playing a game with the depth 
of The Warp Factor. 

Already flying high on the Top Thirty 
charts because of the inherent interest 
Apple owners have in anything dealing 
with space and the future, the program 
appears to have the kind of universal ap- 
peal and playing depth that could result 
in it becoming one of the all-time best- 
sellers. 

But patience it does require. This is no 
aim-and-shoot game where all the skill 
and knowledge you'll ever need can be 
acquired in the first five minutes with the 
program. This is truly a game of strat- 
egy and tactics — in their truest and fin- 
est sense — and it will take multiple play- 
ings to gain rudimentary skill and under- 
standing. Clearly that dictates against 
purchase by those who don't have the pa- 
tience to master a complicated game. 
For those who do. Warp Factor prom- 
ises untold hours of enjoyment as their 
proficiency grows. 

Author Paul Murray has introduced 
sufficient variables into the progfram that 
no two encounters will ever be so similar 
as to invite ennui. The program contains 
information on the space ships of six na- 
tions. Twelve different ships are pro- 
vided for, each with their own unique 
weaponry, staffing levels, and maneu- 
vering ability. 

The genius of Warp Factor Is that 
each player chooses his nationality and, 
within the bounds of the weaponry avail- 
able to that nationality, his fleet. 

What this leads to Is ever more com- 
plicated scenarios as the player's skill in- 
creases, but the difficulty factor can be 
controlled by the player himself to suit 
his competency. Will It be one Reman de- 
stroyer or five Klargon dreadnoughts? 



The program basically provides for 
two modes of play — solitaire or two play- 
er. In the solitaire mode, you choose yoior 
own force and the Apple's force. Be ap- 
prised that Apple is a formidable oppo- 
nent. In the two-player mode, each 
player chooses his own fleet. 

At the end of the Starship Operations 
Manual that accompanies the game is a 
tip on how to convert the game to handle 
as many as eight players. Eight equally 
capable players in a free-for-all makes 
for as dynamic and interesting combat as 
has been witnessed on the Apple. 

Software reviewers have found to 
their sorrow that it is never appropriate 
to proclaim any program as the epitome 
of the programmers' art for a particular 
genre. For as certainly as such rash 
proclamations are made, the very next 
software release will represent a quan- 
tum leap in the art. 

But no matter how cleverly some sub- 
sequent programmer makes a space bat- 
tle game, it seems unlikely that the chal- 
lenge and diversity of Warp Factor will 
soon pale. ART

The Complete Graphics System. By Mark 
Pelczarski. It's hard to write about a pro- 
gram like this one, because there are so 
many different things it will do. The 
Complete Graphics System lets you draw 
in two dimensions, assemble two-dimen- 
sional panels into three-dimensional 
figures, manipulate your three-dimen- 
sional figxires in all sorts of ways, design 
hl-res text fonts and Incorporate text into 
hi-res pictures, create shape tables. All 
drawings with standard and composite 
hi-res colors — and more. The progfram 
earns its name, because it brings 
together at a modest price so many dif- 
ferent graphics tools. 

Two-dimensional drawings are made 
with the game paddles, using a system of 
fixed and movable cursors. You set one 
cursor at the beginning of a desired line, 
move the other to the end of the line, and 
hit the paddle button. Or you can just 
hold the button down while you move the 
movable cursor. Besides this point-to- 
point method, there's an option that al- 
lows you to draw a lot of lines radiating 
from a single point. In addition to 
straight lines, you can create circles, el- 
lipses, or portions of either. The pro- 
gram offers the six Apple hl-res colors for 
lines, but the autofill routine will shade 
enclosed spaces with any of 108 com- 
posite hues. A palette feature shows all 
the colors at your disposal. 

For more painterly effects, the sys-

tern offers a set of nine paintbrushes. 
Just set brush to canvas with a paddle 
button and turn the dial. The various 
brushes yield different stroke widths and 
textures. 

As you draw, the program displays 
available commands and the x and y 
coordinates of your movable cursor in a 
text window at the bottom of the screen. 
Pressing escape makes the text disap- 
pear, allowing you to use the full hi-res 
screen for your picture. 

Unfortunately, the system lacks a 
convenient way to erase. If you can find 
your way back to the exact end points of 
a line, you can try redrawing it in black, 
but results are unpredictable because of 
the way the Apple plots hi-res colors. You 
may just wind up with a dotted line. If 
your drawing is complex, the safest ap- 
proach is to prepare for error by saving 
frequently. 

The text module comes with two 
somewhat antique-looking default fonts, 
one large, one small. With these you can 
add text to your pictures, in destructive, 
nondestructive, or reverse modes. The 
large font is available in all 108 colors, al- 
though the documentation warns that 
some colors will not produce acceptable 
resolution. 

You can edit these fonts or create and 
save entirely new ones in either of the 
two sizes — a seven-by-eight grid for the 
smaller and a fourteen-by-sixteen for the 
larger. The fonts also include control and 
escape characters, so you can design spe- 
cial symbols or logos to go with your 
alphabets. 

A panel module lets you create three- 
dimensional figures by drawing two-di- 
mensional faces one at a time and join- 
ing them. Once you've got a three-di- 
mensional object assembled, you can 
manipulate it with the system's 3-D 
graphics module. Here your options in- 
clude rotation on any of three axes and 
about any center you choose; linear 
movement of the entire figure, expansion 
and contraction from any center point, 
and distortion. The last of these choices, 
distortion, is in effect a one-dimensional 
scaling operation in the direction of 
height, width, or depth. 

Additional features of the system are 
a shape module, which allows you to cre- 
ate shape tables either with paddles or 
with keyboard, and a shrink utility, 
which reduces three-dimensional ob- 
jects by factors of four and puts them into 
any of the four quadrants of the screen. 

The Complete Graphics System will 
take a little time to master. Fortunately, 
the author has provided a thorough and 
clearly written manual. Besides describ- 
ing every aspect of the program, the 
manual explains how to use pictures, 
shape tables, font, and the 108-color rou- 
tine in your own progframs. Another nice 
touch in the manual is a complete outline 
of the command structure, listing every 
menu and submenu in the system. 

The Complete Graphics System is 



available either as a single package, or 
as two separate items. The smaller units 
are the 100-Color Drawing System, con- 
taining the drawing, text, shape, and 
shrink modules of the complete system, 
and the 3-D Drawing System, which con- 
tains the 3-D and 3-D panel modules. (\

Beneath Apple DOS. (Book review.) By 
Don Worth and Pieter Lechner. With in- 
credible hardware and software appear- 
ing daily, it's hard to get excited about a 
new book, even one specifically written 
about the Apple. However, Worth and 
Lechner unveil so many of the mysteries 
of Apple's Disk Operating Systems that 
you may find it difficult to put the book 
down before finishing it. In fact, so much 
information is crammed into this 160- 
page spiral-bound manual that it could 
have been titled Everything You Ever 
Wanted to Know About Dos (But Apple 
Didn't Tell You). 

Beneath Apple DOS serves two pur- 
poses. First, it provides a general de- 
scription of the entire disk system, in- 
cluding how data is actually stored on the 
diskette. This is invaluable if you're try- 
ing to recover a clobbered disk. Machine 
language access to DOS is fully covered 
with an entire chapter devoted to de- 
tailed analyses of Read/Write 
Track/Sector (RWTS) and the File Man- 
ager. Exactly how much you ingest on 
the first reading will depend on your 
prior knowledge about the workings of 
DOS. 

The book's second function as a com- 
prehensive reference manual ensures it a 
prominent place on many bookshelves. 
Beneath Apple DOS includes a tear-out 
reference card much like that found in 
the Applesoft II and Apple DOS man- 
uals. 

Although this book is by no means 
aimed at the neophyte, it is very well 
written in clear, easy language aug- 
mented with numerous charts and fig- 
ures. There's even a sprinkling of car- 
toons to illustrate some of the major 
points, and there's a complete glossary of 
disk-related terms. 

A real plus is in Appendix A: five as- 
sembly language disk utility programs. 
The source code is given (a valuable 
learning aid itself) , but all programs can 
be entered from the Apple's monitor. 
Another appendix describes some of the 
earUer disk protection schemes. In this 
area, the book only scratches the sur- 
face ; those with ulterior motives are not 
served. 

Beneath Apple DOS begins with a 
brief history of DOS (3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.2.1, 3.3) , 
pointing out most of the changes made at 
each phase. Next, diskette formatting is 
covered for both thirteen-sector and six- 
teen-sector types, describing exactly how 
data is nibbUzed for storage on the disk.

Although this is one of the most compli- 
cated and misunderstood concepts about 
DOS, the authors have done an excellent 
job explaining this process in detail. Or- 
ganization of the diskette is then pre- 
sented, giving treatment to the VTOC 
(volume table of contents), catalog, and 
track sector Usts. The precise formats of 
Basic, binary, and text files are also de- 
picted. With this information, you should 
be able to repair many of the typical 
problems that can make a disk unread- 
able. 

The book continues with a detailed look 
at the DOS program itself, including the 
booting process and zero page usage. 
Here, one will find the real meat of the 
subject, annotated to the DOS on almost 



a byte-by-byte basis. Programmers at- 
tempting to modify DOS for their own 
uses will appreciate the mammoth 
amount of work that went into this sec- 
tion. For copyright reasons, a disassem- 
bled listing of DOS is not included. 

Beneath Apple DOS is not for all Ap- 
ple users. For example, there's nothing 
on Basic programming; the Apple DOS 
manual covers this. But if you're writing 
machine language programs that inter- 
face with the disk or customizing DOS for 
special uses, this book is a must. IM

Battle Cruiser Action. By Frank Heffner 
and Bob Reynolds. In the tradition of 



warfare, it's perhaps fitting that an issue 
featuring the first wargame publisher for 
the Apple, Strategic Simulations, should 
also mark the debut to these review 
pages of what may well be SSI's first ma- 
jor competitor. Mytopia Gameware In- 
stitute was also founded by people who 
were both avid war gamers and comput- 
er enthusiasts; there the resemblance 
ends. Where SSI strove for immediate 
production of large-scale, elaborately 
packaged, fully equipped translations of 
their favorite games to the Apple, MGI 
chose the long-range approach to create 
an original war game for the Apple, 
spending three years in meticulous re- 
search to ensure historical accuracy and 
in careful program planning to achieve 
simplicity of game mechanics. 

Says game designer Frank Heffner in 
the notes to Battle Cruiser Action, "We 
wanted a game that featured naval ma- 
neuver in its purest form ; one that elimi- 
nated outside paperwork and calcula- 
tions so that we could spend more time 
enjoying the game." 

So this war game has no parapher- 
nalia, save its manual and disk; it comes 
in a modest package, the manual cover 
serving as the display. On the screen too, 
elaborate graphics have been scorned in 
favor of straightforward tactical space 
and memory room for historical strate- 
gic detail. Each ship is carefully defined 
with the specific characteristics it ac- 
tually had in terms of armor thickness 
and positioning, structural integrity, 
crew quality, damage control ability, 
gunnery ranges, shell effectiveness, and 
speed. All these are taken into account in 
the three characteristics the player must 
be concerned with: speed factor, turret 
factor, and defense factor. 

Once the ships were defined, Mytopia 
concerned itself with the player: re- 
moving the necessity for mechanical aids 
such as graph paper, reducing the time 
needed to enter data while retaining the 
maximum possible player control of 
ships. 

Finally, the focus became making the 
game challenging to everyone, regard- 
less of expertise or lack of it. Six levels 
were built in to the game ; levels are ac- 
complished primarily through varying 
the ability on the part of the German ad- 
miral and through differing CJerman gun- 
nery effectiveness and aggressiveness. 
The novice will shortly be able to beat 
level one ; the authors still can beat level 
six only 50 percent of the time. 

The entire process took Mytopia three 
years. Upon first booting Battle Cruiser 
Action, hearing its one-line melodic call 
to arms and seeing its utile no-res 
graphics, the war gamer sated on color- 
ful hi-res and animation, on elaborate 
charts and maps, may wonder where the 
three years went. But playing the game 
tells the tale. Tactics are all. You can try 
the tactics actually used by the British 
with these very ships in World War I, 
then try other approaches you Invent;

Six Micro-Stories and His Majesty's Ship 
"Impetuous." By Robert Lafore. The 
name of the publisher — Interactive Fic- 
tion — heralds a new fantasy genre for the 
Apple. These stories are like adventure 
games in that they require you to make 
decisions that control your fate. But they 
are more literary than gamelike. The 
pleasure they offer is akin to that af- 
forded by an engaging, well-written 
novel. Naturally, you're the protagonist. 
In "Impetuous, " you captain a British 
ship of the line in her battles with the 
Spanish and the French. In every chap- 
ter there are tactical and moral dilem- 
mas to be solved. Do you engage the 
enemy or not? Do you dare defy orders 
for the sake of chivalry? Are your own 
subordinates plotting against you? You 
make the fatal decisions by entering your 
end of the dialogue. Decisions have con- 
sequences, of course, some of which you 
may not see until you are five chapters or 
more down the pike. 

The Six Micro-Stories are little 
vignettes that suggest, more than fulfill, 
the possibilities of the form. In one, you 
meet the lady of your dreams in Golden 
Gate Park. Can you persuade her to 
spend some time with you? In another 
story, you are caught trying to return a 
piece of jewelry stolen by someone else. 
Can you explain your way out of this un- 
likely predicament? 

Part of the appeal of both "Impet- 
uous" and the Micro-Stories is that they 
are nicely written. The language is a 
pleasure to read. And while the author 
suggests that you keep your dialogue 
fairly straight and pithy, the programs 
will understand and respond to most of 
what you're likely to say. (S

Real Estate Analyzer. By Dr. James 
Howard. Howard Software Services 
claims to publish software for the se- 
rious user; in the Real Estate Analyzer 
they aren't just whistling Dixie. 

The Real Estate Analyser is so power- 



ful that anyone less than a serious in- 
vestor in income properties will believe 
the program a bomb because the data it 
generates oftentimes belies common 
sense. 

Dr. James Howard has packed so 
many esoteric, albeit important, vari- 
ables into 48K that only the investing 
cognoscenti will recognize the worth of 
the program and its data. 

Analyzer is reminiscent of VisiCalc in 
its ability to answer the question "What 
if?" The difference is that this is a dedi- 
cated, special purpose piece of software. 

While it's conceivable that a home 
buyer might find the program useful, the 
strength of the software, for the most 
part, is in dealing with relatively conven- 
tional income property transactions. 

The program will definitely not han- 
dle the kind of transactions so 
euphemistically called creative financ- 
ing that allow would-be home owners to 
buy with unconventional loans. And 
that's as it should be. Anyone who needs 
creative financing instead of a conven- 
tional mortgage to buy a home is not in 
the market for income property in the 
first place; and it's income property 
transactions to which the program is 
dedicated. 

To say that Analyzer doesn't handle 
creative financing situations is not to in- 
dicate that it isn't versatile in almost 
every facet of conventional financing. 

You can conjure up a scenario that 
calls for a forty-thousand-dollar first 
mortgage at 15 percent being paid on an 
amortization basis, a two-hundred- thou- 
sand-dollar second mortgage at 19 per- 
cent on which you pay interest only, and 
a seventy-thousand-dollar third mort- 
gage to your brother-in-law at 12 percent 
on which you only pay two thousand dol- 
lars a year. 

You then plug in all manner of vari- 
ables: closing costs of the purchase, sev- 
eral common operating expenses that 
are then totaled, assumptions about in- 
flation, the rate of increase of property 
values, the rate of change of purchasing 
power of the dollar, your tax bracket for 
income, your tax bracket for capital 
gains, the income you expect from the 
property, ad infinitum. 

•Then the program goes to work. It will 
do cash flow analyses to determine if the 
project will be self-sufficient. It will also 
do six different analyses of investment 
return. 

If you don't like the results, go back to 
the beginning and plug in different as- 
sumptions. If the project looks good to 
you, find two bankers and a brother-in- 
law who agree. 

The strength of the program is that it 
takes into account almost every penny 
that will be spent or earned and even 
calculates the tax consequences should 
you decide to sell. 

The weakness of the program lies in 
the old saw: "Figures never^lie, but liars 
figure." You can make an investment

tions that are favorable — even if they are 
also unrealistic. 

If you are not sophisticated enough to 
know that you've seeded the program 
with favorable data, you could close a 
deal that will send you to the poorhouse. 

On the other hand, if you can provide 
the program with a realistic set of para- 
meters within which to work, you could 
soon be rolling in green stuff. One thing's 
for sure: if this program can't enhance 
your investment chances, you're not as 
smart as you thought you were. 

The software includes a versatile 
print report module that allows you to 
print results of analyses or to print the as- 
sumptions you originally fed the com- 
puter. 

The documentation includes some 
brief appendices that will help the novice 
by defining terms and giving a brief dis- 
cussion of the technical basis of invest- 
ment analysis. Also included is a chapter 
on making investment decisions. These 
concise explanations should take some of 
the mystery out of the program for those 
who come to ft green. ART

Pulsar II. By Nasir. What you've seen in 
the arcades as Star Castle has now been 
adapted to the Apple in Pulsar II. 

The problem with that lies in the origi- 
nal game itself. Star Castle may be the 
second most overrated of all the arcade 
games, made popular mainly by virtue of 
its luminescence. Nevertheless, Pulsar II 
is an interesting diversion. 

Your ship circles the shielded star, 
either clockwise or counterclockwise. 
From your ship, you shoot straight- 
pathed missiles at the shields. As in the 
original, hitting the shields causes an 
enemy missile to form and come out at 
you; after a time, its duration depending 
on the level, the missiles actively chase 
your ship. 

There are some good innovations on 
this disk. Pulsar II is accompanied by a 
second game, Worm Wall. Scores of the 
two games can be maintained cumula- 
tively, so that you can finish a level of 
one, move to the other for a level of it, 
then go back to the first game for the next 
level. 

Worm Wall is an extremely fnostrat- 
ing game, but that's its intent. It consists 
of a simple maze of concentric areas with 
moving half -openings in the walls. You 
travel through one layer of the maze, 
waiting for two half-openings to meet and 
form an opening you can jump through. 
Better be in the right spot at the time, 
though. This is the only way to get to the 
next layer. 

Oh, yes, there's the matter of the hun- 
gry little worm heads. There's one in 
each layer, and when it hears you jump 
in, it immediately starts after you In 
hopes of supper. If it catches up with you 
or you run into it, you're the supper. And 



if you don't get through to the next level 
smartly, the worm, as is the way of 
worms, becomes two worms, proceed- 
ing after you at different speeds. 

On the other hand, if you make it to the 
middle circle, you win the round (no, you 
don't have to eat the worms). 

Both programs are in colorful hi-res 
animated graphics; but the fine detail 
and rich color of other Nasir works are 
missing. ART

Orbitron. By Eric Knopp. Eric Knopp 
has a fine instructor at his disposal, and 
that master's touch is recognizable in 
Knopp 's first professional programming 
effort. We can see Nasir in the color and 
shapes and in the careful graphic design. 
But beyond these hints, Orbitron is all 
Knopp's. The student has learned well, 
and he has made the knowledge his own. 

Orbitron is a first-rate arcade game 
for the Apple. Aim and timing are the 
skills required. Born of an idea taken, not 
from the arcades, but directly from the 
middle-teenage imagination of Eric 
Knopp, Orbitron places you in the semi- 
shielded center of the screen. First, if 
you're quick, you might pick off one or 
two wandering asteroids for a very large 
score gain. If you're very quick. 

More likely, you won't even realize 
the game's begun until a warning flashes 
on the screen, with appropriate sound ef- 
fects. The warning is against seven 
enemy orbs that zoom into an arc forma- 
tion above you. As they begin building 
shields, they take turns sending out mis- 
siles to get you. The missiles orbit you 
about once before they attack, and it's 
wise to get them during the orbit ; when 
they do attack, your shield is ineffective. 

Orbs score more than the missiles, 
but the missiles are the danger. Once 
each orb has fired a missile and the last 
missile has been exploded — either by you 
or on you — the rest of the orbs take off. 
Assuming you're still alive— you get five 
ships— when the orbs are either 
destroyed or gone, you score for each 
ship you have left and prepare for the 
next level. 

But you're not there yet. First, two 
enemy space ships appear in succession, 
leaving one stationary but deadly missile 
each. You must draw a bead on the mis- 
sile and take it out immediately; you only 
get three or four shots before it attacks. 
Having survived this ordeal, you are 
really promoted to another level, and are 
immediately beset by another siege of as- 
teroids, another warning, seven more 
orbs, etc., etc. 

If Nasir himself had authored 
Orbitron, it would be well-received, but 
the fact that it is the first effort of a teen- 
ager makes Orbitron very special in- 
deed. Eric Knopp'^appeeirs to be on the

Tools of the Craft, Part One 

In my opinion, programming is a craft, requiring, as does 
any craft, the application of special skills and special tools to 
produce objects — programs — that are valuable at least for 
functionality, if not also for their aesthetic qualities. The be- 
ginner's first "toolkit" is simply a programming language, 
and, as any craftsman will tell you, it's impossible to master 
your craft without first mastering your tools. In the next in- 
stallments, then, we'll study the features of Apple Pascal, pay- 
ing close attention to the philosophical issues that motivated 
their inclusion in the language. 

Knowing the "why" of a language construct allows you to 
use that construct most efficiently, wherever and whenever it 
can do the most good, and also helps you identify situations 
where its use would be inappropriate. For instance (to borrow 
from another craft), driving nails with the blunt end of a 
hatchet, although possible, is not something you would nor- 
mally do, since a hammer is not only suited, but intended, for 
the job. My task for the next few months is to teach you to dis- 
tinguish Pascal's "hammers" from its "hatchets." Once you 
are familiar with the tools in Pascal, you can apply them crea- 
tively and effectively to the solution of your own problems. 

A computer program does three things: it defines certain 
data, specifies the actions that are to be performed on that 
data, and prescribes the sequence in which those actions must 
occur (the control flow) . Let's examine the concepts of data, 
action, and control flow individually and cover a little Pascal 
syntax in the bargain. 

The job of any program is to manipulate, transform, trans- 
mit, or receive one or more forms of data. The data can come 
from the outside world or can be contained within the pro- 
gram itself. The word data is the plural of datum, which we de- 
fine as the representation of some unit of information. Both the 
representation and the information it signifies are entirely up 
to the programmer. Much of programming involves defining 
the information you want to process, then defining data struc- 
tures to represent that information during the execution of a 
program. 

Data Types. Pascal provides four different types of data 
values that you can use to represent your particular informa- 
tion. These are Pascal's fundamental data types, and their 
names are Char, Boolean, Integer, and Real. (A fifth funda- 
mental type. Pointer, is also available; its underlying philos- 
ophy and use will be the subject of a future column.) 

Char. The Char type consists, in Apple Pascal, of all the 
ASCII characters, including both the upper-case and lower- 
case Roman alphabets, the ten digits 0 through 9, several 
punctuation marks, and certain invisible characters that are 
used to control I/O devices (for example, to tell a printer to 
eject a page of paper). A datum value of the Char type is 
exactly one character. 

For those who haven't yet learned, ASCII is a standard, or- 
dered character set, in which a certain character value is 
mapped onto a whole number in the range of 0 to 127 inclusive. 
The character A, for example, corresponds to the number 65. 
The lower-case version, a, corresponds to 97. 

Take a look right now at the complete listing of the ASCII 



character codes, given in Table 7 of the Apple Pascal Lan- 
guage Reference Manual. Note that the characters corres- 
ponding to the numbers 0 through 31, and also 127, are invisi- 
ble control characters. Should such a character be sent to an 
output device, you are not likely to see displayed any of the 
two- or three-character names given for these codes. The 
names are provided in the table only to help you identify the 
standard special function of the character. (We'll talk about 
some of these in the months to come.) The character corres- 
ponding to 32 is a blank, or space, and that's what you'll see 
(not the name "SP") if you send it to an output device. All the 
other characters correspond to the letters, digits, or punctua- 
tion marks shown in the table. 

Boolean. The Boolean type is very small, consisting only of 
the values true and false. These two values, however, 
are ubiquitous in Pascal, and so we'll be speaking of Boolean 
data quite often. 

Integers and Reals. Two of the four fundamental types. 
Integer and Real, are numeric in nature. An Integer number is 
a whole number (i.e., no fractional part) and, in Apple Pascal, 
may range from -32768 to +32767. Real numbers include both 
a whole part and a fractional part. Numbers such as 3.33333

and -1.414 are examples of Pascal's Real numbers. People 
seldom differentiate between Integers and Reals in daily life — 
numbers are numbers. Pascal includes the distinction be- 
cause numbers are used quite often in programming, and it 
turns out that the representation of Integers at the level of the 
computer chip itself can be made much simpler and more 
compact than that for Reals. Computations with Real numbers 
also tend to take longer for the machine to accomplish than 
Integer arithmetic. (Because the machine is so much faster 
than you anyway, you may never be aware of the difference in 
computing speed between the two types of numbers, unless 
you compare the performance of the program that does thou- 
sands of Integer operations with the performance of one that 
does the same amount of similar Real operations.) 

Literals. There are two ways to refer to datu^ values in 
Pascal programs: expUcitly or by name. If you wanted to use 
the number 10 in the program, you could simply include the 
number itself at the appropriate point. An example of this 
would be the statement 

WriteLn(lO) ; 

which would cause the number 10 to be written out onto the sys- 
tem's primary output device (the console). This illustrates

the use of a literal constant (abbreviated as literal). You 
may form and use literals for the values of any of the four fun- 
damental data types. Figure 1 includes the syntax graphs for 
each kind of literal, and you should try following different 
paths through each of the diagrams to get a feel for the proper 
way to form the corresponding literal. If you do, you should no- 
tice certain facts: 

1. Char literals must begin and end with an apostrophe (') . 
and contain exactly one character between the two apos- 
trophes. A special case is when you wish to denote the apos- 
trophe itself. Then, you use two consecutive apostrophes, so 
the resulting literal consists of four apostrophes in a row ("") ! 

2. Boolean literals must not be surrounded by apostrophes 
or any other characters. A Boolean literal value is written in 
programs as is. The syntax diagram doesn't tell you, but true 
and false are actually identifiers, so Pascal doesn't care 
whether you write them in upper case, lower case, or mixed 
case. 

3. Real literals must contain a decimal point and include at 
least one digit to the left and one digit to the right of the point. A 
real number is actually made up of two parts. The part that 
contains the decimal point is the numeric value itself and is 
called the mantissa. The second is an optional decimal scaling 
factor, called the exponent. Whenever an exponent is present 
in a Real literal, Pascal multiplies or divides the mantissa by 
the power of ten indicated by the exponent, in order to get the 
actual value represented by the literal. Whether it multiplies 
or divides is determined by the sign of the exponent (not the 
sign of the mantissa!). An exponent of "e2" means "multiply 
the mantissa by 10 to the second power, or 100." An exponent of 
"e-2" means "divide the mantissa by 10 to the second pow- 
er." If the exponent part is omitted in a Real literal, It is as- 
sumed to be "eO," that is, 10 to the zero power, or 1. The syntax 
diagram doesn't mention it, but the "e" in the exponent part of 
a Real literal may be upper case or lower case. Also, expo- 
nents may range from e-38 to e-l-38. 

Here are some legal literals, followed by some illegal ones. 
Each of the four fundamental types is represented. For each 
example, trace through the appropriate syntax diagram to 
convince yourself of the literal's correctness or Incorrectness. 

CHAR 

Correct: 'a' 'H' '*' ' ' '8' 

Incorrect: a " 'HH' 

BOOLEAN 

Correct: False True FALSE TRUE 
Incorrect: F T 'True'

Incorrect: .3 1 -46. 4.5el00 

Named Constants— the CONST Section. Suppose you must 
use a certain number, say pi, in many different parts of your 
program. Pi is roughly 3.14159. You could sprinkle this number 
around your program as a literal, but you might transpose a 
digit or two here and there, and that would play interesting 
(and frustrating) tricks with your program's accuracy. More- 
over, weeks or months after writing the program, you might 
decide that you want to use another number instead of pi. Try- 
ing to locate and change all occurrences of 3.14159 to occur- 
rences of the new number could be a major Job if your pro- 
gram is long and the number occurs often. 

Pascal permits you to associate meaningful names with ar- 
bitrary constants, and you can take advantage of this feature 
to solve both of these hypothetical problems. Constant names 
are formed according to the rules for identifiers that you have 
already learned if you have been following the Pascal Path 
from month to month. Otherwise, refer to Appendix F of the 
Apple Pascal Language Reference Manual. Equating names 
with constant values is done in the CONST section of the decla- 
ration area.

programmer. Its declaration area was, therefore, empty. 

The optional CONST section is, in most programs, the first 
in the declaration area. (It may be second, but we won't cover 
this situation until much later.) It consists of the keyword 
CONST, followed by as many constant definitions as you wish 
to list. Figure 2 gives the syntax diagrams associated with the 
CONST section. In each constant definition, an identifier name 
is equated to a constant value. That value may be expressed by 
a literal, or by an identifier that names a previously defined 
constant. Unless you take special action to the contrary, such a 
definition will hold throughout the rest of the program, and 
anywhere you use a constant name, it will be as if you wrote 
the corresponding literal. 

Now, we can give a name to the Real constant 3.14159: 
PROGRAM 
Dummy; 
CONST 

Pi= 3.14159; 

MagicNumber= Pi; 
BEGIN 
END. 

Note that the only reason I framed the CONST section within a 
dummy program was to depict graphically the placement 
of that section within the declaration area. 

I have defined two constants here to solve the two software 
development problems mentioned earlier. The compiler can't 
detect digit transpositions in numeric literals — one number 
looks like any other number to it. Use of the constant identifier 
"Pi" throughout the program, instead of the literal "3.14159," 
will ensure that the same constant value is referenced every- 
where and that no inadvertent digit transpositions due to typo- 
graphical error occur. You might, of course, misspell the iden- 
tifier, but if you do the compiler will probably be able to in- 
form you of your error, because, chances are, no other de- 
clared identifier will be the same as your misspelling of "Pi." 
So, the compiler will assume that you are trying to use an un- 
declared identifier (a name that hasn't been associated with 
any object). This is a syntax error condition (#104), and the 
compiler issues an error message whenever it occurs. 

Of course, should you misspell "Pi" as, for instance, "Pii," 
"Po" or "Pu," and any of these alternate spellings corres- 
ponds to another Real-number constant declared within your 
program, the compiler will use the wrong constant, not the one 
you really mean. Therefore, you should be careful to keep the 
spellings of your identifiers as distinct as possible so the com- 
piler can be of most help to you in detecting misspellings. 

In the second problem area, I associated the identifier 
"MagicNum" with "Pi." Throughout your program, there 
may be places where the use of the number represented by 
"Pi" is appropriate, but where other numbers could be used, 
as well, to achieve different results. Going in, after the pro- 
gram has been written, and changing all occurrences of the 
Literal "3.14159," or even the identifier "Pi," to something 
else, is boring, error-prone work. 

When writing your programs, you should relax and give 
yourself plenty of time to consider whether or not you will ever 
have occasion, during the normal evolution of the program, to 
change certain parts of it. Those parts should be written to per- 
mit easy change, whenever possible. In this case, defining 
"MagicNum" as equal to "Pi," then using its name instead of 
"Pi" wherever you feel you might want to use a different num- 
ber later, will make it possible to switch to that new number 
simply by updating the single definition of "MagicNum." In 
doing so, you will still have "Pi" around to use as you see fit. 

I realize that anticipation of the normal evolution of a pro- 
gram requires a reasonable amount of programming experi- 
ence on your part, and I don't expect you to be able to plan for 
every contingency when writing software. Even proven, sea- 
soned programmers consider themselves fortunate when it ap- 
pears as if they have covered all bases with a given program. 
Nevertheless, the sooner you accept that change (in the form 
of updates, bug fixes, and so forth) is a routine part of soft- 
ware development, the sooner you will incorporate into your

personal methodology techniques that allow for change, thus 
easing your overall programming burden. 

Your Own Types— the TYPE Section. One of the things 
that has helped give programming its unfortunate reputation 
as an arcane art is the fact that, typically, a programmer must 
take a clear, English language description of a process or pro- 
gram solution and reexpress it in specific computer terms of 
programming language. The resulting program bears vague 
resemblance to the original description, and this is primarily 
because of the necessary transformation of the program's da- 
ta descriptions into machine-acceptable ones. For example, 
suppose your program must process many yes and no deci- 
sions. The information that must be represented consists of the 
concepts yes and no, but no programming language, not even 
Pascal, gives you a data type that includes those values. In 
most languages you must force data values from other types to 
act as your yes and no. In Pascal, for instance, the following 
CONST section would establish two new named constants, 
"Yes" and "No," as integer values: 

CONST 
Yes= 1; 
No= 0; 

Or, the Boolean type could be used: 
CONST 
Yes= True; 
No= False; 

Finally, yes and no might be represented by values of type 
Char: 

CONST 
Yes= 'Y'; 
No= 'N'; 

There is nothing sacred about the specific values I chose to 
associate with the identifiers "Yes" and "No" in each case. In 
the Integer example, "Yes" could have been equated to 43 and 
"No" to -711. In the Boolean case, "Yes" could have been 
false, and "No" true. With Char, I could just as easily have 
used lower case as upper case, or even different characters al- 
together. "Yes" and "No" could also be represented by Real 
numbers, but I'll spare you an example because I think you 
get the idea. 

In a language like Pascal, in which it's possible to associate 
meaningful names to literal constants, it's quite easy to give 
new meanings to existing data values. In other languages — 
ones that require using the literals themselves instead of sym- 
bolic names — programs might lose clarity when this type of 
data aliasing is employed. For instance, try reading a pro- 
gram in which the programmer used 1 to represent yes, and 
used 0 to represent no. This can be doubly confusing if Is and Os 
standing for yes and no have been included in arithmetic 



formulas with Is and Os that are actually being used as regular 
numbers ! 

To avoid confusion with other forms of data, you might like 
to define entirely new data values corresponding to the infor- 
mation concepts yes and no. In effect, you would create a 
new data type, containing just those values. In Pascal, you are 
free to create your own custom data type, with a type declara- 
tion. Figure 3 gives partial syntax diagrams for the type dec- 
laration section. This section, like that for defining constants, 
is optional. If used, it is placed after any constant declaration 
section and before any other declaration section. The syntax 
diagrams for this section are incomplete, illustrating only 
those constructs we're now covering. The diagram, and this 
discussion, will be concluded further down the Path. We'll talk 
about two flavors of programmer-defined types this time : enu- 
merated types (also known as "scalars"), and subranges.

Fi-om looking at both the example and the syntax dia- 
grams, you can see that the declaration for a type is similar to 
that for a constant. One identifier is used to name the type it- 
self, and other identifiers are given as the type's individual 
data values. The list of values is enclosed in parentheses, and 
each element is separated from its successor by a comma. 

An important property of an enumerated type is that there 
is a definite ordering of its constituent data values. In the 
example type "YesOrNo," the value "No" is taken by Pascal 
to be "less than" the value "Yes," because it comes before 
"Yes" in the value list. There is no compelling reason why 
"No" should come first, in this instance. In many programs, 
however, the order of data values in enumerated types does 
make a difference and can make progframming more con- 
venient, as you'll see in future examples. 

Enumerated types are just one way that Pascal lets you 
shape your program in terms of the problem at hand, rather 
than the other way around. If you need a specific range of 
values for a certain purpose and would prefer not to make 
existing data values do double-duty, you can make up a com- 
pletely new type and use it as any other Pascal data type. 
Here are some more enumerated types, presented primarily 
to stimulate your imagination:

Boolean = 

(False, True) ; 

Did you notice the inclusion of Boolean in the list above? 
It turns out that Boolean acts as if it were defined in just the 
way shown here. Pascal would have left it to the programmer 
to define Boolean for every program needing it, but so many of 
the language's other built-in features and statements require 
the Boolean type that Pascal gives it to you for reasons of con- 
venience. Note that the name of every fundamental type is an 
identifier, not a keyword. 

In Apple Pascal, enumerated types may be of any size, but 
the compiler must consume memory during the compilation to 
store the name of a type and the names of all its values. If the 
compiler runs out of memory before making note of all the 
values in a given type, your compilation will fail. (This 
shouldn't happen until much later.) 

Subranges. You can also declare types to be subranges of 
other types. When a subrange type is created, the type from 
which it is taken is known as the base type. A subrange type is 
specified by giving a type name, a lower limit from the base 
type, and an upper limit from the same type. The limit values 
are separated by a Pascal-style ellipsis, which is only two dots 
instead of the three dots you may be used to seeing in English 
prose. The subrange type includes all values between and in- 
cluding the limit values. 

Here are some subrange type declarations. Some use the 
fundamental types for base types, while others are based on 
the examples given above for enumerated types. Your easy 
job is to identify the base type for each subrange. 
Summer = 

June . . August; 
Uppercase = 
'A' . . 'Z'; 
StndSex= 

Male . . Female; 
Undergraduate = 

Freshman.. Senior; 
Naturals = 
1 . . 32767; 

Note that it is impossible to create subranges containing 
noncontiguous elements. That is, a subrange must consist of an 
unbroken sequence drawn from the base type. To illustrate, 
you couldn't create "Primaries," a subrange of "Colors," con- 
taining only the values "Red," "Yellow," and "Blue." Nor, 
from the Integers, can you draw "Primes," containing only the 
prime numbers. Neither of these proposed subranges is con- 
tiguous. There is, however, a Pascal construct known as a SET 
that is provided specifically for the manipulation of such non- 
contiguous groups. We'll talk about SETs soon. 

I am slightly embarrassed that, at this stage of the game, I 
can't give you a truly convincing reason for the inclusion of 
subranges in Pascal. We will have to go a little farther before 
their true utility becomes apparent to you. In fact, we'll travel 
most of the way in the next installment, so I hope you'll be back 
next month, as we take up the concepts of variables, opera- 
tors, expressions, and assignment. lU

B! (RAIC STinSOH 



Beginners' Ckjrner began last month with an introduction to 
some of the programs on the System Master disk. In partic- 
ular, we looked at Little Brick Out, Applevision, Brian's 
Theme, Color Demo, and Color Demosoft. 

There are a couple of other interesting programs on the 
System Master that we didn't get to last month. In one — a 
game called Animals, written in Integer Basic — the computer 
asks you questions and tries to guess the animal you're think- 
ing of. What makes this game different is that the computer 
learns as it loses; every time you beat the program, you teach 
it something new about the animal world. 

The other goody is a program called Phone List, written in 
Applesoft, which allows you to create your own personal, com- 
puterized, little black book. You can store up to a hundred 




Backup— A duplicate of valuable programs or other data. 
Default — An answer that the computer presumes to be correct 
unless informed otherwise. Defaults serve a dual function: 
they save keystrokes and help the user avoid erroneous input. 
Disk controller card— A circuit board that interfaces the Ap- 
ple to one or two disk drives. 
Read— To retrieve data from a disk. 
Ribbon cable — A flat, multistranded connector. 
Write — To store data on a disk. 

Write-protect — To prevent the computer from storing data on 
a disk. This is accomplished by putting a piece of tape or a spe- 
cial write-protect tab over the notch near the upper right-hand 
corner of the disk.

names and numbers. Later, when you want to recall a num- 
ber, you can do so by typing as few as two adjacent letters of 
the name. ^ 

Before you can use either Animals or Phone List, however, 
you will need to copy them from the System Master onto an- 
other disk. That's because the System Master is a write-pro- 
tected disk. 

Our activities last month all required the Apple to get infor- 
mation from the System Master disk. This process is known as 
reading the disk. Nothing we did, however, required the com- 
puter to put material back, or write, on the disk. 

But if you're going to teach your Apple about animals or 
ask it to memorize the names and phone numbers of your hun- 
dred closest associates, you're going to have to give it a place 
to store its new information. So this month we'll be writing as 
well as reading. 

To begin, you will need at least one blank disk. Apple sup- 
plied you with a blank disk when you bought your system. If 




WHAT I COULD USE... 
IS A COMPUTER THAT 
UNDERSTANDS SANSKRIT.. 



you still have that one, we'll use it now. Otherwise, any other 
blank disk will do fine. 

Compare the physical appearance of your blank disk with 
the System Master disk. You'll notice one difference— a little 
notch on the blank disk, about an inch away from the end that 
bears the label. That notch makes it possible for the computer 
to write on your disk. If the notch is open, the disk is said to be 
write-enabled ; if it is covered or nonexistent, the disk is wrlte- 
inhibited or write-protected. 

Keeping Tabs on Your Disks. Apple made the System Mas- 
ter a write-protected disk so that you wouldn't accidentally 
overwrite or alter any of the crucial programs it contains. La- 
ter, when you have vital data of your own on disks, you can 
protect it the same way by putting a piece of tape — or a spe- 
cial write-protect tab, usually supplied with blank disks — over 
the little notch. 

The recommended procedure is to copy your entire Systiem 
Master disk to provide yourself with a backup in case the mas- 
ter disk should fail. It's unlikely, of course, but it is possible 
that someone will come along and put a cigarette bum in your 
disk, or bend it, or lose it. And even if nothing like that ever 
happens, you would still be wise to make a backup because 
disks have a finite lifetime— something on the order of forty 
hours of actual playing time (time when the disk drive's red 
light is on). 

The System Master contains two programs that are used 
for copying entire disks. They are Copy, for machines using In- 
teger Basic, and Copy A, for machines that use Applesoft. An 
additional program, FID (File Developer) will copy indi- 
vidual files or programs from one disk to another. FID is a ma- 
chine language program that can be run by both Integer and 
Applesoft Apples. 

We'll assume in this article that you're going to copy the en- 
tire System Master disk. 

Here's how the Apple goes about making copies. First it 
reads a portion of the disk you're going to duplicate (often 
called the original disk) , storing the information it reads in an 
area of the computer called random access memory (RAM) ; 
then it writes it on your duplicate disk (often called the 
destination disk). 

The fact that the data gets stored internally between the 
read and write phases of the copy procedure enables you to 



make copies using a single disk drive. If you have only one 
drive, the computer will know that, and it will prompt you at 
the appropriate times to remove one disk and put in the other. 
If you have a two-drive system, it will take your Apple much 
less time to make the copy ; you can just put the original in one 
drive and the destination disk in the other and watch the pro- 
gram go. But the copy will turn out exactly the same whether 
you have one drive or two. 

Under the Apple Skin. Before you can start copying disks, 
you need to know exactly how your system is hooked up. To 
find out, we'll digress for a moment and take a look at the in- 
side of your computer. If your machine is on now, you can 
leave it on while we do this ; just be sure not to loosen anything 
inside while the power is on. 

Reach around to the back of your Apple and apply a little 
pressure to the underside of the lid at the two corners. When 
the top pops loose, slide it straight back and out. 

The largest object inside your computer, that brass or sil- 
ver-colored oblong object on the left side of the Apple, is the 
power supply. Reach in and touch it. 

It's a small formality, perhaps, but it's not a bad idea to lay 
a hand on your power supply whenever you have reason to go 
inside the computer. First of all, it's nice to know that it won't 
shock you; second, and more important, when you touch the 
power supply you harmlessly discharge any static electricity 
you may be carrying. If you should happen to discharge a big 
shock on one of the electronic components, you could damage 
your system. 

Running from left to right across the back of your com- 
puter, there's a row of eight slots with little gold-plated con- 
nection points. These are the peripheral slots of your Apple; 
they allow you to expand your computer by connecting it to 
such devices as disk drives, printers, and modems. 

If you look behind the slots, you'll see that they are num- 
bered, starting on the left, from zero to seven. This brings up a 
little quaintness about computerspeak. Computer people have

a habit of numbering everj^hing from zero up, instead of start- 
ing at the number one, the way normal people do. If you've 
played Little Brick Out, you probably observed that the Ap- 
ple's game paddles are called paddle zero and paddle one, not 
paddle one and paddle two. It's just one of those things you 
have to get used to. 

The Rainbow Connection. Take another look at your ex- 
pansion slots. You probably have a circuit card plugged into 
slot six (be careful not to wiggle the card; Just look at it). Slot 
six is, of course, the seventh slot on the board, since the slot all 
the way over on the left is zero. You also probably have either a 
gray or a rainbow-colored umbilicus running from the circuit 
board out to your disk drive. If you have two drives, you'll have 
two umbilici (actually, those connectors are called ribbon 
cables) . Oddly, the points of connection for those ribbon cables 
are marked drive one and drive two — not zero and one. 

Be that as it may, the point of all this commentary has actu- 
ally been to get you to notice which slot is holding the card 
that's connected to your disk drive. 

The card, called the disk controller card, can be in any slot 
except zero, but six is a sort of standard or conventional loca- 
tion for it. A controller card can be connected to either one or 
two disk drives. If you have more than two disk drives, you'll 
need a second controller card, in which case the convention is 
to put the two cards in adjacent slots, typically six and five. 

Now that you know where everything is attached, you're 
ready to put the lid back on and do some disk copying. Pop the 
System Master into your disk drive and run the appropriate 
program — Copy or Copy A. 

The first thing that will happen is that the copy program 
will interrogate you a bit. It wants to know where it's going to 
be reading your original disk and where it will have to go to 
write to your destination disk. 

Winning by Default. For each question, the program will 
provide a default answer. A default is an answer the computer 
assumes to be correct unless you tell it otherwise. For ex-

ample, the first question asks which expansion slot holds the 
controller card attached to the disk drive containing your origi- 
nal disk. The program presumes that the card is in slot six; 
you can either accept the default answer by hitting return, or 
amend it by typing some other number. 

The default values for these two copy programs will be cor- 
rect if yours is a two-drive system with the controller card in 
slot six, and you put your original disk in drive one and your 
destination disk in drive two. If it happens that you have only 
one drive, with the card in slot six, accept the default answers 
to the first three questions and type "1" in response to the 
fourth. The computer will then know that it will be finding both 
the original and the destination disks in drive one and that it 
will have to tell you when to switch disks. 

After you answer the four questions, the computer will 
prompt you to insert your original disk in drive one. Since the 
original is also the disk bearing the copy program — i.e., the 
System Master— you don't have to do anything at this point. 
Just hit return again and you're on your way. 

The copy program will keep you informed about what it's 
doing. It will tell you, for example, whether it's reading or writ- 
ing. This is important if you have a one-drive system because 
you could conceivably screw things up a bit by putting in the 
wrong disk at the wrong time. Watching the display on your 
screen will make that mixup less likely to occur. 

Guard Your Writes. If you really want to play safe, put a 
write-protect tab over the disk that you're copying. That way 
the system can't possibly write to it, even if you have it in the 
drive at the wrong time. Of course, when you're backing up the 
System Master, you don't have to worry because the disk is al- 
ready write-protected. 

You'll notice that before the copy program writes anjrthing 
on the destination disk, it goes through a procedure called for- 
matting. What it's doing is structuring the disk so that the data 
will be laid down in an orderly fashion, enabling the computer 
to find it again when it's time to read the disk. The formatting 
process also erases anything that may have been on the disk to 
begin with. 

When you've finished making your backup, the best thing to 
do is store your original in some cool, dustless place and just 
use the copy from now on. Use a soft felt-tip pen to label the 
backup, since a hard ballpoint pen could damage the disk. 

If your system arrived with a disk marked "Basics," it 
would be a good idea to back that disk up too. We'll talk about 
the Basics disk in a future column. 

Now that you've finished making backups, you deserve a 
reward for your labors, so help yourself to Animals or Phone 
List. Since your System Master is now copied onto a write-en- 
abled disk, you can proceed to educate your Apple about the 
Kingdom Animalia or stock it full of names and phone num- 
bers. Later on, when you've put a lot of numbers or animals on 
the disk, you should probably copy Animals or Phone List onto 
a separate disk, just to give them a little breathing room. The 
System Master disk is pretty full to start with; in expanding 
those two files, you may eventually get a DISK FULL mes- 
sage from your Apple. 

No Copy from Scrambled Software. One more word about 
copying disks. Not everything can be copied with Copy or 
Copy A. As you may or may not know, software piracy is a big 
problem and a considerable threat to the microcomputer in- 
dustry. To prevent indiscriminate and unauthorized duplica- 
tion, quite a few commercial software publishers scramble the 
data on their disks in such a way that the copy programs 
you've just used will not be effective. Such disks are said to be 
copy-protetted. If you try to back them up with Copy or Copy A , 
you'll just get an error message; no harm will come in most 
cases, but no copy will either. 

That's frustrating, of course, if you have a legitimate need 
for a backup. Fortunately most of the companies that produce 
high-priced, copy-protected software other than games pro- 
vide you with one free backup. 

More about disks next time, and about that mysterious 
three-letter word, DOS. Dl

□ Sabotage. By Mark Allen, On-Line 
Systems (Coarsegold, CA). If you're 
tired of computer duck hunting and want 
to shoot down some people for a change, 
here's your opportunity. You man a gun 
emplacement with paddles or keyboard 
and try to knock out helicopters, 
bombers, bombs, and paratroopers. 
Mostly you've got to pick off those para- 
troopers. If as many as four of them can 
gather on the ground to either side of 
your cannon, they'll piggyback their way 
onto your battle station and zap you. 
Once a paratrooper gets on the ground, 
you ack-ack won't reach him, but you can 
arrange for him to be buried by falling 
helicopter debris or human body parts. If 
the saboteurs don't get you, look out for 
the bombers. They only come around 
once in a while, but they're trouble when 
to do. One bomb on target and you're 
gone. You score points according to the 
type of target you hit. Bombers count the 
most, paratroopers the least. You lose 
points for errant shooting, so don't fire 



wildly. You get to choose between normal 
shells and missiles that you can steer 
with the paddles after they've left the 
barrel. Colorful hi-res and sound effects. 
32K, $24.95. 

□ Galactic Attack. By Robert J. Wood- 
head, Siro-tech Software (Ogdens- 
burg, NY). Galactic Attack is one of 
those rare games that combines long- 
range strategy and immediate arcade- 
type action. You are the commander of 
the U.S.S. Blaise Pascal in this hi-res 
Milky Way Western, charged with lib- 
erating the solar system from the sav- 
age Kzintis. To start with, the bad guys 
control all the planets except earth and 
Luna. There's even a band of those devils 
on the asteroid Ceres. Your job is to orbit 
friendly territory, beam some troops 
aboard, and then get those troops onto 
enemy-held planets. En route, you'll need 
either to evade or to destroy the sharp- 
shooting Kzinti marauders. They know 
your position, course, and speed, so they 
fire their torpedoes and phasers with 



deadly accuracy. And there are a lot of 
them and only one of you. On the other 
hand, you have the same weapons plus 
shields that the Kzintis lack. You've also 
got a human brain, whereas the bad guys 
only have a 6502 and the Apple Pascal 
runtime system. So the odds may be with 
you, but not until you've developed both 
strategy and tactical keyboard dexter- 
ity. 48K, $29.95. 

□ Gamma Goblins. By Tony and Benny 
Gno, Sirius Software (Sacramento, CA). 
Here's an invader game where the shots 
coming at you are from little hypoder- 
mic needles with faces. You get twenty 
pints if you hit them. You have to wipe 
out the whole gang of needles, without let- 
ting any of them slip by you, before you 
get to face the forty-pint crew of maraud- 
ing viroids. Successful lysing of the 
viroids, corpuscles, and lymphoids gives 
you a shot at the nurses' station, where a 
direct hit in the lower orifice yields four 
hundred pints and an autonomic trans- 
fusion. Odds are you won't get that far. 
Seven hits from this weird battalion put 
you in the morgue. And even if the gob- 
lins don't get you, you only have so much 
time to get that transfusion before your 
own blood supply dwindles to nothing. On 
the other hand, if you do make it to the 
second round you may encounter a cou- 
ple of roving cardiacs with homing de- 
vices, who will try to zero in on you be- 
fore you blast them. A great old game 
freshly twisted. 48K, $29.95.

camp with a strong sense of the role of 
computers today and tomorrow. 

The California Pacific Campership 
went to John C. Brandstetter of South San 
Gabriel, California, a fourteen-year-old 
with a clear picture of his goals and a 
penchant for the pun. 

First runnersup were Tim Kehoe 
(Plymouth, MI) , twelve ; Greg De Cicco 
(Hinsdale, IL), thirteen; Robert Allen 
Mason (Moorpark, CA), twelve; Sarah 
Robinson (Modesto, CA), ten; Ivan 
Drucker (Los Angeles, CA), eleven; 
Patrick J. Moran (Snyder, NY), twelve; 
Brad Handler (Denver, CO), thirteen; 
Mark Paul Weatherwax (Richland, MO), 
twelve; Geoffrey Raynor (New York, 
NY), thirteen; Debbie Heuerman (Foun- 
tain Valley, CA), ten; and Sharinda 
Hummel (Bellingham, WA), eleven. 

The Oracle. The Rose Bowl and Su- 
per Bowl, the Academy Awards, and now 
the Indy 500 have transpired for our Sof- 
talk Oracles. With the scoring for guess- 
ing closest to the average speed of the 
winner of the Indy 500, we have a whole 
new order in the queue for a disk drive. 

With his prediction of 141 miles per 



hour, Douglas Stewart (Cape Elizabeth, 
ME) came closest to the actual average 
speed of 139 for the winner of the In- 
dianapolis 500. His score on this Oracle 
leg is -2. Runnersup are Craig Morris 
(Livingston, NJ) and Charles Lewis 
(Richmond, VA) who guessed 148 for -9 
points. 

Overall leaders so far, with their 
cumulative scores, are Tom O'Brien 
(Portland, OR), -2; Douglas Stewart 
and Jim Ganz (West Hartford, CT), -5; 
Tom O'Brien (again!) and Paul Shan- 
berg (Moraga, CA), -8; and Daniel 
Tobias (Poughkeepsie, NY), -9. 

Stewart opted for the cassette version 
of Sargon II as his prize. 

Secret Orders. Leaving no word un- 
turned, Tim Powers of Carrollton, Geor- 
gia, discovered eighty legitimate Apple- 
soft commands in the March 1981 Sof- 
talk. There were only twelve written 
commands Powers didn't find. Many 
contestants included Applesoft reserved 
words that aren't specifically com- 
mands in their entries, and Powers was 
no exception. If these were to be counted, 
Powers's score would be one hundred. 



Either way, he won by a solid margin. 

Powers will receive $100 worth of 
goods, including Computer Ambush, his 
primary choice, from his dealer, Compu- 
shop, compliments of Softalk. 

Rainy Day Chain. There must have 
been a great deal of precipitation in Mil- 
waukee during April and early May. S. 
Potts and M. Mayerhoff built us a men- 
tal roller coaster of curious associations 
and delightful twists and turns more than 
twelve hundred links long — for a total of 
6,020 points before bonuses for par- 
ticularly clever associations were added. 
Among the outstanding links in the 
Potts/Mayerhoff chain were : Edsel 
Ford/Meadowlark Lemon; Nero 
Wolfe/Itzhak Perlman; Arabian 
Nights/Sinbad/Marquis de Sade; Eydie 
Gorme/James Beard/Smith Brothers ; 
Henry Ford/Model T/Lipton's; Nancy 
Drew/Leonardo da Vinci; That Old 
Black Magic/Presto, Chango/Renee 
Richards/Arthur Ashe. For pure puns 
they outdid themselves in "King 
Midas /It Might as Well Be Spring" and 
"Dolly Parton/Pardon me, boys, is that 
the Chattanooga Choo Choo?" And, for 
esoteric knowledge, we like "Halley's 
Comet/Mark Twain." Twain was bom on 
the night that comet made its every- 
seventy-five-year appearance. 

Potts and Mayerhoff will receive $100 
worth of On-Line Systems games from 
Team Electronics of Southgate, Milwau- 
kee, compliments of Softalk. HI

Soflalk Presents 
The Bestsellers 

In the early months of the Softalk Top Thirty poll, Bill 
Budge had so many entries on the list that it almost seemed 
more appropriate to name it the honorary list of Bill Budge 
hits. It was noted at the time that none of those programs were 
particularly new entries — all had been seasoned for months in 
the marketplace before the first Softalk poll, making their con- 
tinued presence all the more remarkable. But another effect of 
the programs having aged was that none was strong enough to 
knock VisiCalc off for the top spot. 

All those other Budge efforts are gone from the Top Thirty 
while VisiCalc remains, although VisiCalc has now been six 
months in the second spot. VisiCalc is beyond question the sin- 
gle most dominant program in Appledom, but lately it's taken 
back seat to Alien Rain for three months. Space Eggs for two 
months, and now Raster Blaster, the pinball machine simula- 
tion both authored and published by Bill Budge. 

It was the first full month in distribution for Raster Blaster 
and it distanced the field. Only VisiCalc was even close. Space 
Eggs dropped to a far third, narrowly edging out DB Master. 

However, the author of Space Eggs, Nasir, was making his 
presence felt elsewhere. Pulsar II and Autobahn, the two of his 
latest efforts available in May, both made the Top Thirty for 
the first time. Neither appears to have the strength to chal- 
lenge Raster Blaster and VisiCalc, but Sirius Software, pub- 
lisher of Nasir's programs, has high hopes for Gorgon, just re- 
leased. 

With three games in the Top Thirty and a hot new one on the 
way, Nasir remains the king of arcademia, that comer of the 
Apple world where programmers import arcade game ideas to 
6502 sense. Nasir's most serious competition comes from Tony 



Suzuki, who has Alien Rain and Alien Typhoon in the top twen- 
ty, and Jun Wada, whose Snoggle is number five. 

On-Line Systems also found May a profitable month. All 
three hi-res adventures from Ken and Roberta Williams made 
the Top Thirty as did Sabotage and Missile Defense, two ar- 
cade games authored outside the company but published by 
On-Line. 

Previously unranked programs that hit the charts this 
month were lead by Pool 1.5 from Innovative Design Soft- 
ware. It was eighth in its first month of wide distribution. 

Sabotage, Pulsar II, Autobahn, and Space Raiders, from 
United Software of America, were also new. Space Raiders, 
also an arcade game, gives author Paul Lutus the unusual dis- 
tinction of being the first author to be represented on Softalk's 
various bestselling lists for business, home/hobby, and enter-

Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 8.5 percent of 
all sales of Apples and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in 
the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in June to ascertain their sales lead- 
ers for the month of May. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was number of sales made — 
such other criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer retail- 
er, and personal preference of the individual respondents were not consid- 
ered. 

Respondents in June represented every geographical area of the conti- 
nental United States as well as Hawaii. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in 
the index number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. 
The index number is an arbitrary measure of relative strength of the pro- 
grams listed. Index numbers are correlative only for the month in which they 
are printed; readers cannot assume that an index rating of 50 in one month 
represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in another month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus-or-minus 5.1 percent, which trans- 
lates roughly into the theoretical possibility of a change of four points, plus or 
minus, in any index number.

Programs reentering the Top Thirty were Planetoids from 
Adventure International and Missile Defense. Also new to the ' 
Top Thirty was Super Disk Copy, a venerable marketplace 
competitor from Sensible Software that had previously made 
the Home/Hobby Ten. 

The Home/Hobby Ten was marked by a predominance of 
programmers' aids. Only DOS 3.3, Data Capture U.O, and Typ- 
ing Tutor do not fall into that category. Sensible Software had a 
banner month, with three of its programs making that list. 

The Business Ten also underwent some changes, with three 
different entries on the list. Old timers returning to the list 
were Easy Writer from Information Unlimited and CCA Data 
Management System from Personal Software. 

New to the list and the marketplace was VisiPlot from Per- 
sonal Software. VisiPlot is sold both as a stand-alone package 
and in concert with VisiTrend. The ranking here is for VisiPlot 
as a stand-alone package ; if its sales with VisiTrend had been 
counted, it would have been third in the Business Ten. 

Business in general in May held even with the April upturn 
without showing significant advancement. About as many re- 
tailers reported a slowdown in business as reported an upturn. 

This market strength is being reflected in broader-based 
support for a wider range of product than had previously been 
the case. There are a far larger number of software products 
just below the last entry in each list than ever before. JM

WE'VE CREATED 
A WORLD 
JUST FOR 

OSGORTH! It is a wonder "^T^^JU© 
world of swords-and-sorcery 
adventure to serve as your personal playground. 

THE SHATTERED ALLIANCE™, first in a line of 
forthcoming games from SSI that comprise the 
Chronicles of Osgorth, is a sophisticated strategy 
simulation centered on this rich fantasy 
planet and its ethereal trappings: magic, 
rivalry between realms, war among 
exotic creatures. 

With the multitude of armies 
either preassembled or designed by 
you, you can conjure up limitless 
scenarios — even the unlikely con- 
frontation of Osgorthian forces 
against Alexander the Great's Com- 
panions or Caesar's Legionnaires! 

Ah, the possibilities! 

THE APPLE COMPUTER paints 
beautiful, color Hi-Res graphics an 
Osgorthian battlefield of knolls, mountains, 
forests, and open plains. Unit types are catego 

As part of our demanding standards of excellence, 

we use maxell floppy di 

I 




rized into five classes of infantry and four of cavalry. The tribes 
that populate this world are as varied as they are enchanted: 
dwarves, unicorns, amazons, centaurs — just to name a few. 

Your fantasy soldiers have been carefully rated for armor, 
speed, strength, and morale. Their weapons may be the bow, 
javelin, rocks, spears, pikes, swords, axes, clubs, or cavalry 
lance. ...and of course, spells that can magically enhance a 
unit's speed, defense, attacking power, or courage. 

AS RICHLY DETAILED as this game is, it never 
becomes unwieldly because the computer keeps 
track of everything. Its simple but elegant 
movement system was designed so that 
all action can proceed at a brisk pace. It 
also comes with a powerful and intelli- 
gent computer opponent for solitaire play. 
THE SHATTERED ALLIANCE is fun, 
fast, and easy to play — geared to incite 
your imagination. It comes with the 
game program disc (for a 48K Apple II 
with ROM card and a mini floppy 
disc drive), a rulebook, and four 
player-aid charts. For $59.95,get this 
fantastic piece of real estate today!

STRATEGIC SIMULATIONS INC. 



PLAY BASEBALL \ 
WITH AN " 
APPLE® I 



It may sound 
ridiculous, but 
that's exactly what 
COMPUTER 

BASEBALL™ lets you do. With this highly realistic 
strategy game and your Apple® computer, you can 
manage any team you like — from the neighbor- 
hood hackers to the 1944 St. Louis Browns! 

ALL THE OPTIONS of a big time manager are at 
your disposal. For example, you can tell your 
hitters to steal or bunt; your outfield to play 
shallow; your infielders to come in at double-pIay 
depth or in all the way. You can even visit the 
mound to see how the pitcher's doing and per- 
haps dig into the bullpen for a reliever. 

For you historical buffs, the data for over 20 great 
past and present major league teams are provided 
so you can re-create immemorable games 
that were and those that might have been. 

THE COMPUTER RESOLVES the action 
based on your decisions and the reams of player 
statistics you've fed into it, such as a pitcher's ERA, 
strikeouts, and won-Ioss record or a hitter's batting 
average, home runs, stolen bases.... 




Using animated, color Hi-Res graphics, the 
computer presents an amazingly realistic simu- 
lation of baseball. It is so true to life that a hitter 
with a high RBI total will be biased to hit 
more often when runners are on base. On 
potential double plays, it will check for the 
fielding abilities of the players involved and 
for the running ability of the batter and person 
on first base. It even accounts for streak hitting 
and pitching. 

As if all this weren't enough, the computer 
will also manage the opposing team during solitaire 
play. 

How much does it cost to own all the 
baseball teams in the world? Just $39.95. 
COMPUTER BASEBALL comes with the 
game program disc (for a 48K Apple II with 
ROM card and a mini floppy disc drive), a 
rule book, and various player-aid charts. 

So you see, playing baseball with an 
Apple isn't outrageous at all. In fact, it may 
be more fun than the real thing. Give it a 
try today! 

To order with your VISA or MASTER- 
CARD, can toll free 800-227-1617. ext. 335 
(800-772-3545, ext. 335 in California). To 
order by mail, send your check to Strategic Simulations Inc, 
Dept. S3, 465 Fairchild Drive, Suite 108, Mountain View, CA

Expediter II provides an easy means by which Applesoft BASIC programs written for the Apple II & III* 
Computer may be translated into machine language. As a result, the compiled version of the program will 
normally execute from 2-20 times faster. All features of Applesoft are fully supporting including the 
use of the Hi-Res graphics, shape, tables, Lo-Res graphics, defined functions and DOS commands. 

There is no additional BASIC syntax to learn, and most compilations can be performed with one simple 
command. 

i FEATURES ... 



Debugging of compiled code is aided through use 
of such tools as TRACE capabilities and a com- 
plete symbol table listing. 

All DOS functions are supported in exactly the 
same way as in the uncompiled BASIC program- 
nothing new to learn, 

All standard Applesoft error messages are 
supported. 



• Erroneous statements are flagged during program 
\ ... compilation. 



Comprehensive statistics are generated at compile 
times such as total memory requirement, starting 
address of the compiled machine code for each 
line of the Applesoft program, etc. 

Applesoft programs may be compiled to reside at 
any location in the Apple's memory. This feature 
permits multiple Applesoft programs to overlay 
each other and use the compiled Applesoft pro- 
grams as subroutines. 

Variables may be designated as "local" to an 
Applesoft program or "global" to all Applesoft 
programs in memory, thereby facilitating inter- 
program communications. 



Extensive use is made of pre-existing routines 

within the Applesoft ROM. This minimizes the • Compiles BASIC programs at approximately 30 
memory required by compiled machine code. lines per minute.
