HOME MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE FROM ELECTROMC ARTS 



Ifyou 




can learn to use this word processor 
in 90 seconds, can it really be any good? 




CUT & PASTE™ displays its commands on a single line at the bottom of the screen. This 
mahes working with it easier and also gwes you more usable space on the screen. 



Of all word processors on the 
market today, Cut & Paste may 
well be the easiest to use. In 
fact, by the time you finish reading this 
section of the ad, you'll know how 
to work with Cut & Paste. So read on. 
START TYPING. Working with Cut 
& Paste is like working with a type- 
writer. If you know how to use a type- 
writer, you already know how to type 
in your draft with Cut & Paste. The 
only real difference is, with Cut & 
Paste it's easier to correct typos. 
MAKING CHANGES. Let's say 
you've decided to make a cut in your 
rough draft. To do this you put the 
cursor (the bright block) at the start 
of the text you want to delete, and 



stretch it through to the end of your 
cut. Then you send the cursor down to 
the "CUT " command on the bottom 
of the screen. Done. 

If, on the other hand, you want 
to keep that line, but put it in a differ- 
ent part of your draft, you use the 
'TASTE " command. You mark the 
point of insert with the cursor. Then 
you put the cursor over "PASTE. " 
That's all there is to it. 
PRINTING IT OUT When you 
like the way your work looks, you print 
it. Put the cursor on the "PRINT" 
command. Then set your margins, in 
inches. That's it. 

You now know how to use Cut 
& Paste. 



OKAY, IT'S SIMPLE. BUT HOW 
GOOD IS IT? Cut & Paste has aU 
the features you'll ever need to use 
at home. Here are a few of them: 

1. Scrolling dynamic menus 

2. Automatic word wrap 

3. Simple cut & paste editing 

4. Block indenting 

5. Set margins and paper size in 
inches 

6. Tabs 

7. Automatic page numbering 

8. Controllable page breaks 

9. Headings 

10. Scrolling text windows 

11. Automatic widow and orphan 
control 

12. Clear and concise manual 
In other words. Cut & Paste 

will do just about everything other 
word processors do. But Cut & Paste 
will do it more easily. Without com- 
plex commands and modes. 

If you think about a word proc- 
essor in terms of what it replaces (type- 
writers, pens and paper, files), Cut & 
Paste begins to look very good indeed. 

And when you consider that all this 
power can be had for approximately 
$50, we think you'll see why we believe 
Cut & Paste is something of an 
achievement. 

A PHILOSOPHY OF DESIGN. 

The people who designed, devel- 
oped and programmed Cut & Paste 
have some fairly heavy credentials. 

They are people who worked on 
the internationally-famous user inter- 
face designs that led to the Xerox Star" 
and Apple's Lisa." They are also 




THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD. Until quite recently we used pens and paper 
and typewriters to write with, mostly because we knew how to use them.They have been good 
tools, but limited. You tend to mal<e messes when you work with them, and getting rid of those 
messes makes extra work. Cut & Paste is an inexpensive and practical alternative. Because it is as 
easy to use as a typewriter, you really will use it. Which may make it the first sensible word processor 
for the home. Thus an alleged labor-saving device has come to a position where it really can save a 
significant amount of labor, i.e., yours. 




THE MEN WHO MADE CUT & 
PASTE. Th£ Linotype machine pictured here 
was the 19th century's most important contri- 
bution to word processing technology. It let 
typesetters compose and rearrange text in the 
form of metal castings. The importance of Cut 
& Paste, of course, must await the judgment 
of history. Nevertheless, the seven men who de- 
veloped it look confident here. Standing left to 
right, they are-. Norm Lane, Steve Shaw, David 
Maynard, Dan Silva, Steve Hayes and Jerry 
Morrison. Seated at the console is Tim Mott, 
whose idea this was in the first place. 

people who have in common a very 
lucid philosophy of design. 

Computers and the programs they 
run are tools, they believe. Tools are 
never noticed unless they are bad tools. 
When they're good, they become, in 
effect, invisible. And if you want to 
make a good tool— an invisible tool— 



you'd best study the way people use 
the tools they already have. 

As a result of this thinking, Cut & 
Paste was designed to work much in 
the same way that you already work 
with a typewriter or with pen and 
paper The most complex and power- 
ful parts of the program are hidden 
from view. The work they do takes 
place deep in the machine. All you get 
to see are the results. 

But beyond that, there is something 
almost indefinable about a good de- 
sign. Things about it just seem to work 
crisply. Litde touches and features 
that you notice make you want to smde. 
If it's reaUy good, 
it feels good.

ware centers, and in leading department stores 
throughout the country. Both Cut & Paste

OUR COMMITMENT TO 
HOME MANAGEMENT 

Cut & Paste is just one of a growing 
number of products we're publishing 
within the category of "home manage- 
ment software." These products are all 
built around the same program archi- 
tecture, making them all equally "friend- 
ly," as well as remarkably straightfor- 
ward and practical. We believe that 
designs like these will soon make home 
computers as functional and efficient as 
today's basic appliances. 

Our next product in this line is called 
Firuxndal Cookbook. It's a realistic alterna- 
tive to the complex, pre-programmed fi- 
nancial calculators we all wish we knew 
how to use. With a few, simple keystrokes, 
Financial Cookbook lets you make more 
than 30 key time-value-of-money 
computations— just about all the ones 
you'd ever use for personal finances — 
like calculating 
mortgages with 
changing inter- 
est rates, com- 
pounding the 
interest on IRA 
and savings ac- 
counts, and buy- 
versus - lease 
comparisons for 
automobile pur- 
chases.

management products and about what 
we have planned for the future, call or

These Oracle contests just keep getting more 
popular all the time. 

The Oracle 1984 contest contains more pre- 
dictions, more challenges, and more prizes than 
any of the Oracle contests before it. Why? Be- 
cause we're crazy! We're giving away prizes 
left and right because we don't know any better. 

We do know that our readers love to win 
things, so the payoff is bigger for each part of 
the contest this year, and the grand prize . . . 
well, let's just say that we like to keep up with 
the latest developments at Apple (and we don't 
mean gossip). 

To enter this contest is easy. Just take a look 
at all the events listed on this page and make 
your prediction. That's it! 

Rules. You can enter as many times as you 
like, as long as each entry is different. Please 
submit no more than five entries per envelope. 

All entries must be on standard 8'/2 X 11- 
inch paper. Nothing smaller, nothing larger. Be 
sure to print your name, address, phone num- 
ber, and signature on each entry. 

All entries must be postmarked by Saturday, 
December 31, 1983. No exceptions! 

Anyone who hits a prediction exactly or 
comes closer than anyone else will win $200 
worth of goods made by our advertisers. In case 
of ties, the fearsome random number generator 
will pick a winner. All decisions are final. Keep 
a close eye on the Contest Winners section for 
announcements of winners. 

Each part of the contest will be scored. The 
person with the highest cumulative score at the 



end of the contest will reign as Softalk Oracle 
1984. And here's the good part: That person 
will win not two, not three, but one bright and 
shiny mystery computer from the dark recesses 
of Apple R&D. 

So, what are you waiting for? Get off the can 
and start predicting! 

Oracle '84. Predict the following: 

1. Who (or what) will be Time magazine's 
Man of the Year. Fifteen points. 

2. The greatest number of medals won by 
the United States in one sport (ice hockey 
excluded) during the Winter Olympics. Minus 
one point for each medal off. Bonus: five points 
for predicting the sport. 

3. Academy Award winners in the catego- 
ries of best picture, best actor, and best actress. 
Ten points for each correct answer. Ten bonus 
points if you get all three correct. 

4. The greatest difference between the high 
temperature in Sydney, Australia, and the low 
temperature in Juneau, Alaska, on any one day 
during the first seven days in April. Give your 
prediction in degrees Fahrenheit. Minus one 
point for each degree off. 

5. The top three finishers (drivers) in the In- 
dianapolis 500 stock car race. Ten points each. 
Bonus: five points for predicting the winner. 

6. The number of undergraduates to grad- 
uate from the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- 
nology at the end of the spring 1984 semester. 
Official count will come from the MIT office of 
the registrar. Minus one point for every hun- 
dred off.

7. The number-one-seeded players in men's 
and women's divisions at Wimbledon and the 
winners in each division (four things are being 
asked here). Five points for each correctly 
named player in the right category (seeded or 
winner). Bonus; ten points if you can name the 
players (man and woman) the winners will beat 
in the finals. 

8. How many runs will be scored (both 
teams combined) in the Olympics baseball final. 
Minus a point for each run off. Ten bonus 
points if you can name the country that will win. 

9. The closing price of Apple Computer 
stock on September 10, 1984. Submit predic- 
tion in the form of 25 Vi to mean $25.50. Frac- 
tions of dollars don't count in scoring, but they 
will count in deciding ties. Minus one point for 
each dollar off. 



10. The recording artist or group to have 
the number one single on Billboard magazine's 
Hot 100 for the week ending October 7, 1984. 
Twenty points for getting it right; ten points if 
the artist or group you predict has the number 
two single and is climbing. 

11. Who will win the 1984 United States 
presidential election. Twenty points. Bonus: 
Predict the number of electoral votes received 
by the winner. An exact prediction wins ten 
points. Nine points for being ten votes off; eight 
for being twenty off, and so on. 

12. The five companies to make the greatest 
number of appearances in the Softalk Top Thir- 
ty during 1984. Appearances in specialized cat- 
egories don't count; only appearances in the 
Top Thirty count. Five points per company. 
Bonus: ten points if you can predict the number

Oracle, Part Six. It's bad enough that we 
have to read it in the papers, see it on television, 
hear it on the radio, and fight about it over 
drinks. But to see such controversial subjects 
as politics in such a happy place as contests is 
too much. 

Nonetheless, it was part of this year's Ora- 
cle contest, so here are the results. Part six re- 
quired predicting who would have announced 
their candidacies for the 1984 presidential elec- 
tion by September 30, 1983.

A sure bet would have been Ted Kennedy, 
except that he announced at the end of 1982 that 
he wouldn't run in 1984. Oracle contestants 
didn't take that too seriously, since the Massa- 
chusetts senator always says that. However, it 
appears he was serious this time. Kennedy 
wasn't one of the seven who took the big step. 

Another name one would expect to see on 
the list is Ronald Reagan. So far, it looks like 
we'll be seeing his face on television a lot when 
campaign time comes around, but as of Septem- 
ber 30 nothing was official. Just about every en- 
try included Reagan as one who would have an- 
nounced by now, so in that regard everyone 
came out even. 

Pulling away from the pack of aspiring ora- 
cles was Eric Williams (Des Moines, WA), 
who correctly named all seven persons who de- 
clared themselves candidates by September 30. 
Each candidate was worth ten points; those 
named who didn't declare were worth minus- 
five points. Williams included Reagan on his 
list, so that gave him a total of sixty-five points, 
five more than the next highest contestant. 

The credit for $100 went toward PFS.File, 
which Williams picked up at his local dealer, 
Empire Electronics in Seattle. 

For those keeping score, the seven candi- 
dates were all Democrats: former vice president 
Walter F. Mondale, former Florida Governor 
Reubin Askew, Senators Gary Hart of Colora- 
do, Alan Cranston of California, John Glenn of 
Ohio, and Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, 
and former Senator George S. McGovern of 
South Dakota. 

As we come down the stretch in this year- 
long contest, a select few are waging a neck- 
and-neck battie for the contest's coveted prize, 
a brand-new Apple He. Part six of the contest 
turned the race completely around, bringing 
some new faces into the spotlight while drop- 
ping some others. 

Coming out of nowhere to take first place is 
Paul Shanberg (Moraga, CA), with eighty-eight 
points. Shanberg was accidentally omitted from 
the standings in the August issue, where he 
would have been third, with forty-three points. 
For the third time in a row, second place 
belongs to David Miles (Gillette, WY), with 



seventy-four points. John Estell (Maumee, OH) 
is third, with sixty-three points, and Gordon 
Bitko (East Brunswick, NJ) debuts in the top 
five with sixty-two points. Fifth place is held by 
a persistent Carl Webb (Vista, CA), with fifty- 
nine points. 

In January we'll find out who wins the Ap- 
ple lie. It might be one of the five contestants 
mentioned here; it might not. Who knows? 

Teenage Apples. The comment found most 
frequently in Reincarnation contest entries was 
that "most of your contests blow me out the 
door. Finally, here's a contest simple enough 
for me to enter! Thanks!" The second most fre- 
quent comment was that "this contest was a 
good idea, but it was much too easy. Make them 
more challenging in the future." 

Whether the contest was too easy or just 
right, everyone seemed to be having a good 
time, so we'll probably see more logic puzzles 
of this type in the future. 

In logic puzzles like the Reincarnation con- 
test, you know whether or not the solution 
you've come up with is right because it's pos- 
sible to check the solution against the given 
clues. With that in mind, the contest staff was 
sure that every entry received would be a cor- 
rect one, assuming that people wouldn't send in 
incorrect entries. 

Not so! Surprisingly, there were about the 
same number of incorrect entries as there were 
correct ones. And from the heap of correct en- 
tries (six and a half shovelfuls), Jeff Withum 
(University Park, PA) was yanked by the spleen 
from the infamous random number genera- 
tor. Ouch! 

Withum 's prizes include Megahaus's Mega- 
writer, Creative Computer Products 's Kleertex 
templates for Apple Writer II and VisiCalc, and 
some blank disks to round out the $100 tab. All 
prizes were picked up at Designware in nearby 
State College, Pennsylvania. 

In case you're still trying to figure out which 
computer became which person and what they 
did, the answers and solution are given at the 
end of this column. 

Humble Pie. As we said earlier, there were 
quite a few contestants who felt that the Rein- 
carnation contest was below the Softalk stan-

dards and that it provided little challenge for 
them. "I solved this in fifteen minutes," "This 
was a cinch," and, "Too easy! Make 'em hard- 
er next time" typify comments made by many 
contestants. 

Ironically, most of those who took the time 
to tell us how easy the contest was didn't take 
the time to double-check their entries. If they 
had, they might have gotten the correct solu- 
tion. As it turned out, they ended up in the same 
pile as those who didn't know the difference be- 
tween a word processing program and an arcade 
game (though some word processors behave 
like arcade games). 

And Now, the News. As usual, contestants 
covered just about every age group and every 
occupation. They ranged from the Sisters of 
Saint Francis of the Holy Family in Dubuque, 
Iowa, to seven-year-old Michael Sussman of 
River Forest, Illinois (both submitted correct 
entries). There were a lot of college students 
who scribbled away madly to meet the October 
1 1 deadline when they should have been study- 
ing for midterm examinations. 

Workhorse of the month is Joe Basile 
(Naugatuck, CT), who wrote an eighteen-page 
Applesoft program (more than eight hundred 
lines of code) to solve the puzzle. 

There were husband-and-wife teams and 
some who entered without their spouses. Prize 
selection usually tells the whole story of a cou- 
ple's marriage. "I want to win a KoalaPad 
Touch Tablet for my hubby," wrote Kathy 
Miller (Irwin, PA). On the other side of things 
was Sue Hamilton (Central City, NE): "I wan- 
na win cold, hard cash, 'cause if my husband 



wins, he'll just get some more junk for his 
computer." 

There were the kiss-ups. "Please remind the 
random number generator of all them swell 
times he and I had back in the old days," wrote 
C.H. Simonds (Lakeville, CT). 

Robert Hollister (Santa Barbara, CA) wrote, 
"Please tell the computer that runs the random 
number generator that if he could manage to 
pick my entry as the winner, there's a really 
cute word processor who'd just love to spend 
some time with him." Well, the RNG took a lot 
of offense to Hollister's remark because it was 
reincarnated as a female. 

There were the beggars. "At the very least, 
can I have my name in Softalk?'' and, "Even if 
I don't win, please mention my name in the 
magazine if my answer is right." Okay, you 
two have yourselves a deal. 

There were the confused. "Is there any 
name for the detachable pieces of paper used to 
advance the paper in pin-feed printers? I call 
them phuzzies, but I doubt that this is an official 
name," says Leah Larkin (Lafayette, LA). 

There were the proud. "The contest was so 
easy. I solved it before flight 554 got halfway 
from Nashville to Detroit," wrote Jim Bykow- 
ski (Falcon Heights, MN). From the looks of 
Bykowski's incorrect entry, it seems he should 
have kept flying. 

Finally, there were the sobbers. For Paula 
Giese (Minneapolis, MN), winning this contest 
was "wishful thinking. The only time I ever 
won anything in a contest was when I was 
twelve. I won a musical instrument called a 
cocolele for writing some loathsome adver- 
tiser's limerick. It had an awful tone, and even- 
tually a horse stepped on it." 

Enough rambling for this month. Next time, 
we'll see who got the most treats and the fewest 
tricks. 

Logically Speaking. And now, the solution 
to the I Was a Teenage Apple contest: 

To follow along, set up five rows of five 
squares. In the top row, put in the names of the 
computers and fill in the answers as we go 
along. 

Clue one tells us that the Lisa used to play 
fantasy games. 

Clue two says the Cobol-speaking computer 
was divorced. Put this one aside for now. 

Clue three tells us that the II Plus was en- 
gaged. He had a date with his fiancee. 

Clue four says that the III programmed 
things in assembly language. SOS, which stands 
for sophisticated operating system, is the Apple 
III operating system. 

Clue five lets us know the lie spoke Cobol. 
Combined with clue two, this tells us that the lie 
was divorced. 

Clue six says several things. The II was di- 
vorced twice, and "saved games in progress" 
implies he used to play either adventure games 
or fantasy games. Since the Lisa plays fantasy 
games (clue one), the II must have been playing 
adventures. 

Clue seven reveals that the single man didn't 
speak a high-level language. That means he 
didn't speak Basic, Pascal, Cobol, or Fortran. 
Therefore, he spoke assembly. Combined with 
clue four, we find out that the III is the sin- 
gle man. By elimination, this leaves the Lisa 



DECEMBER 1983 



as the married person. 

Clue eight, "The one who wrote in Pascal 
did a lot of word processing. ' ' Put this aside for 
the time being. 

Clue nine lays out an order of computers. 
All it tells us is that the samurai warrior was a 
more sophisticated Apple than the comic, and 
that the lawyer was an earlier model Apple than 
the comic. 

Clue ten tells us that the disc jockey played 
fantasy games (assuming Ultima XII is the same 
kind of game as Ultimas I, II, and III) and that it 
programmed in Basic (print and goto statements 
and for-next loops). Therefore, combined with 
clue one, we know that the Lisa, which spoke 
Basic, is now a disc jockey. 

Clue eleven tells us the doctor didn't play 
adventure games. He was listening to someone 
else talk about taking inventory, collecting ax- 
es, and parsing f- words, which are all actions 
performed in adventure games. Combined with 
clue six, we know the doctor was not the II. 

Clue twelve says the comic used to do data- 
base work (all his punch lines ended with "how 
many fields to sort" and other database 
phrases). 

At this point, the only languages left unas- 
signed are Pascal and Fortran, which must be 
either the II or the II Plus, since all the other 
computers have languages assigned to them. 
We know from clue eight that the Pascal speak- 
er did word processing; we know from clue six 
that the II played advenmre games. Therefore, 
the II Plus must have spoken Pascal and done 
word processing. Also, by elimination, the II 
spoke Fortran. 

Now let's combine clues nine and eleven. 
We know the Lisa is the disc jockey and the II is 
not the doctor. This means the II is the samurai, 
the comic, or the lawyer. Clue nine lets us 
know that because the II is the earliest form of 
Apple, it can't be the comic (the lawyer is an 
earlier model than the comic) and it can't be the 
samurai (the samurai is more sophisticated than 
the comic). Therefore, the II must be the 
lawyer. 

Three occupations and two applications are 
left to fill. Clue twelve says the comic did data- 
base work, so we know he couldn't have been 
the II Plus, which did word processing. That 
means the comic must be either the III or the 
lie. Clue nine says the samurai was a more so- 
phisticated Apple than the comic, so that makes 
the comic the lie, and the samurai the III. The 
doctor must have been the II Plus. 

Now that we know the comic was the lie, we 
can fill in the lie's application as database man- 
agement, and the Ill's as arcade games. 

The result: 

The Lisa spoke Basic, played fantasy games, 
and became a married disc jockey . 

The ni spoke assembly language, played ar- 
cade games, and later became a single samurai 
warrior. 

The He spoke Cobol, ran database programs, 
and was reborn as a comic who got divorced. 

The II Plus spoke Pascal, did word process- 
ing, and was reincarnated as a doctor who be- 
came engaged. 

The II spoke Fortran, played adventure 
games, and became a lawyer who went through 
two divorces (he handled his own cases).

Fastalk is a quick guide to popular, specialized, 
new, and classic software. When you need a particu- 
lar kind of program or just want to see what's new, 
Fastalk is the place to look for fast answers. 

If a program has been reviewed in Softalk, it car- 
ries the issue date of the review in italics at the end of 
its listing, and the capsule description given reflects 
the published review. 

A new software entry, which must be of profes- 
sional quality to be included, is designated by a check 
mark preceding its name. A new entry loses its check 
mark after its first appearance and drops out of 
Fastalk after one to three appearances (depending on 
genre) if it fails to gain popularity. 

A bullet preceding a title indicates a program that 
Softalk has designated as a classic, based on its ability 
to stand up over time, its significance for its time 
(breaking new ground or introducing a new genre), or 
its archetypal qualities. 

Other entries in Fastalk are there either by virtue 
of current activity (the programs are selling at least as 
much as the least-selling entry on any of the bestseller 
charts) or because they are representative of the best 
of programs for a special interest or need (such as 
card games or non-Basic-specific language terminal 
programs). 

Softalk may arbitrarily omit any package from 
Fastalk, whether or not it meets the foregoing 
criteria.

Introducing a computer game 
that will bring out the railroad buff, the ^coon, 
the adyenturer,and the kid in^our kid. 



TRAINS is one computer game that will really bring out 
the best in kids. Of all ages. 

Because TRAINS is a Spinnaker game, which means it's 
a learning game that's really fun to play. 

TRAINS puts kids in charge of an old-time railroad. And 
whether their railway empire gets bigger or goes out of 
business is entirely up to them. 

As theyjuggle the challenges of picking up supplies and 
delivering to various industries, paying their employees, 
keeping the locomotive filled with coal, and making enough 
money to venture into new territories, kids are actually 



learning the economics of running a business. 

They're learning to manage financial resources, and to 
use different kinds of information in setting priorities. 
And best of all, they're having fun while they learn. 
Look for TRAINS on disk at your 
local software 
retailer, and play 
it on your Appier 




We make learning fun.

HARD HAT MACK™ 

by Michael Abbot and 
Matthew Alexander 

"In many respects, this is the 
best game ever produced for the 
Apple II. Hard Hat Mack is 
the blue collar hero of this three 
screen climbing game and his 
tasks are far from simple." 
— Arcade Express 

"If you put Hard Hat Mack 
in the ring with all other 
games on the market, it 
would win most bouts in 
the opening seconds of the 
first round. It's that good."

ARCHON™ 

by Free Fall Associates 
"No review could possibly do 
more than hint at the manifold 
excellence of Archon. It is 
truly a landmark in the devel- 
opment of computerized 
strategy games." —Video 
"... you're bound to fall for it. 

Imagine a chess game in which 

you can cast spells." 

—Creative Computing 



A ^ 



. . . the offices of A.N. A.L.O.G. 
echo with the searing roar of 
dragon-fire and shouted 
obscenities from angry players. 
Archon turns friend against 
friend and inspires grudges that 
can last for days. What better 
compliment can you give to a 
computer program?"

AXIS ASSASSIN™ 

by John Field

You'll never see Infocom s graphics 
on any computer screen. Because 
there's never been a computer built 
by man that could handle the images 
we produce. And, there never will be. 
We draw our graphics from the 
limitless imagery of your imagi- 
nation—a technology so power- 
ful, it makes any picture 
that's ever come out of a 
screen look like graffiti 
by comparison. And 
nobody knows how 
to unleash your 
, imagination like 
Infocom. 

Through our 
prose, your 
imagination 
makes you part 
of our stories, 
in control of 
what you do 
and where you 
go— yet unable 
to predict or con- 
trol the course of 
events. You're con- 
fronted with situa- 
tions and logical puz- 
zles the like of which you won't 
find elsewhere . And you're immersed 
in rich environments alive with per- 
sonalities as real as any you'll meet 
in the flesh— yet all the more vivid 
because they're perceived directly by 
your mind's eye, not through your 
external senses. The method to this 
magic? We've found the way to plug 
our prose right into your psyche, and 
catapult you into a whole new ^ 
dimension. 

Take some tough critics' words 
about our words. SOFTALK, for 
example, called ZORK® Ill's prose 
"far more graphic than any depiction 
yet achieved by an adventure with 
graphics." And the NEW YORK 



TIMES saw fit to print that our 
DEADLINE^'^ is "an amazing feat 
of programming." Even a journal as 
video-oriented as ELECTRONIC 
GAMES found Infocom prose to be 
such an eye-opener, they named one 
of our games their Best Adventure 
of 1983. 

Better still, bring an Infocom game 
home with you. Discover firsthand 
why thousands upon thousands of 
discriminating game players keep 
turning everything we write into 
instantaneous bestsellers. 

Step up to Infocom. All words. No 
graffiti. The secret reaches of your 
mind are beckoning. A whole new 
dimension is in there waiting for you.

THE SENSIBLE SPELLER " IV 
CORRECTS SPELLING MISTAKES 

IMMEDIATELY. 



The most popular new word-processing 
product introduced for tine Apple 
computer in 1982 was not a word 
processor— it was thie SENSIBLE 
SPELLER IV proofreading program^ A 
perfect complement to your current 
Apple word-processing program, tfie 
SENSIBLE SPELLER IV is fast, friendly, 
and gives you the features you need in a 
spelling cfiecker. 

First in features** 

It only takes a minute or two for the 
SENSIBLE SPELLER to scan through a 
ten-page document and compare each 
word against its 80,000-word dictionary. 
Each misspelled word is shown to you in 
the middle of a small excerpt from your 
document, so you won't waste time try- 
ing to remember how you used the word. 

You can immediately correct the 
misspelled word by replacing it with the 
proper spelling. The SENSIBLE 
SPELLER even suggests the correct 
spelling for your misspelled words! 



First in dictionaries 

The SENSIBLE SPELLER includes the 
largest, most authoritative dictionary 
available for the Apple computer. Over 
80,000 words are supplied, direct from 
the official Random House Dictionary. 
And there is unlimited room to add your 
own special words. The official Black's 
Law Dictionary is available separately 

First in word-processor compatibility 

The SENSIBLE SPELLER works with 
more Apple word processors than any 
other spelling program, including: DOS 
3.2, DOS 3.3 (Apple Writer— all versions, 
Bank Street Writer, Magic Window, 
Screen Writer, etc.), SuperText, Word 
Handler, CPIM (Wordstar, etc.), and 
Pascal word processors. 

The SENSIBLE SPELLER is available 
for $125 and runs on all Apple lie, II + , 
and Apple-compatible computers with 
one or two disk drives.

Computer Survives Disaster 

Many of the letters I've read in Open Discus- 
sion talk about the reliability of certain prod- 
ucts. Recently both my hardware and software 
got the worst environmental testing that Mother 
Nature could possibly dish out. 

On May 311 was enjoying a quiet Memorial 
Day weekend at my in-laws' home in Farming- 
ton, Utah, when I heard the snapping and crack- 
ing of what sounded like a large bulldozer. Hur- 
rying outside I saw a fifteen-foot wall of mud 
and rocks coming down the mountain, taking 
out everything in its path! Having rushed to get 
a program finished for a company I write soft- 
ware for, I had taken my entire system to Farm- 
ington. This included my Apple H Plus, 
monitor, disk drive, Epson MX- 100 printer, 
and three hundred disks of software— not to 
mention all of my Apple manuals. 

As the mountain came crashing down, I ran 
back into the house to get my two-month-old 
daughter. I put her in the car and, making one 
last attempt to save something, I ran back into 
the house. I grabbed my Apple, disk drive, and 
monitor all in one handful. I was unable to get 
anything more before the mudslide completely 
destroyed the 150-year-old rock house as I fled 
to safety. 

Five days later, we were able to get back to 
the property to see what was left to salvage. 
There was nothing left standing of the house ex- 
cept one portion of a wall. The rest was either 
buried in fifteen feet of mud or crushed by giant 
boulders the size of cars. The roof was still in- 
tact but had shifted away from the rest of the 
house. While we were exploring under the roof, 
we found the microwave oven. As I was digging 
in the mud to get the oven, I found my Epson 
MX- 100 completely buried in the mud under 
the microwave. It was pinned between the 
microwave and a rock, and the entire weight of 
the roof was on the microwave. We used a hy- 
draulic jack to lift the roof away and remove the 
printer. The paper separator was mangled 
beyond recognition, the ribbon cartridge looked 
like it had been run through a shredder, the dust 
cover was shattered, and the power cord had 
been severed— not to mention that the whole 
thing was completely filled with mud. Thinking 
that I could do no worse, I took off the cover 
and squirted out the mud with a hose. Then I 
sprayed it with silicon to keep it from rusting. 

A close examination revealed that both of 
the circuit cards had been broken into pieces, 
severing more than twenty circuit paths. I 
stripped the printer down to its barest essentials 



and began the painstaking task of cleaning every 
little component. I glued the circuit cards back 
together and resoldered all of the paths. The IC 
sockets were so corroded that I desoldered and 
replaced them. After installing a new power 
cord and fixing the last of the broken paths, I 
plugged it in, and to my surprise the crazy thing 
worked! (This letter was printed on that same 
MX- 100!) I really must thank Epson for the 
quality of their printer. The insurance company 
said that a mudslide is an act of God; therefore 
they would not pay for anything, and there was 
no way I could afford to replace the printer 
given the cost. 

Instead of ending this amazing story here, I 
must go on to explain that after two more weeks 
of searching we found all of my software. All of 
the disks were in pretty bad shape, being buried 
in the mud for two weeks. I took my disks home 
and turned the hose on them and then let them 
dry for a couple of weeks. Finally, when they 
were dry, I opened the plastic jackets and 
removed the disks. I cleaned off each disk with 
alcohol and put it back in a clean jacket from a 
new disk. Then I booted it up in my drive. I was 
able to recover almost all of the programs and 
copy them onto new disks. I haven't been able 
to afford to replace all three hundred disks as of 
yet, but it looks like after some time I will be 
able to recover about 85 percent of all my soft- 
ware. I can't give credit to any one disk com- 
pany because I have a variety of different 
brands, which include Dysan, Verbatim, 
Scotch, and Control Data. I never did find the 
manuals for my Apple or my game paddles, but 
there is still a lot of mud left to search through. 
Mike Ostler, Bountiful, UT 

Strictly Okay 

I would like to put in my plug for Stricdy Soft- 
ware, because of a recent incident I had with 
them. I ordered a copy of Beagle Bros' Double- 
Take and found that the disk wouldn't boot. 
Strictly Software not only accepted my collect 
call but sent a new disk and paid for returning it 
by UPS as well. Then I found out that Double- 
Take and my Program Line Editor weren't com- 
patible. I again called Strictly Software collect 
and they called Beagle Bros, got some informa- 
tion on how to patch Double-Take, and sent it to 
me. Strictly Software has my business from 
now on! 

Rob C. Knauerhase I, HilHard, OH 
Eden's Repute 

Permit me to be the first to take exception to 
Frank Hammers 's misguided condemnation by 
association that appeared in the October Open 
Discussion. In that letter Mr. Hammers compli- 
mented Softalk on the lowered incidence of 
"advertisements for things like strip poker, 
Garden of Eden computers, and such." 

While I share his distaste for the "and 
such," methinks his brush is too wide. After 
looking over the past six months of Softalk for 
evidence to justify Mr. Hammers's tarring of 



)ECEMBER 1983 



39 



the Garden of Eden, I've concluded that he re- 
gards the company logo showing a Disneyesque 
Eve and Adam as too, too. . . . 

Try as I might, I just could not see the of- 
fense. I even searched Garden's free catalog 
for evidence of "strip poker . . . and such." 
Garden doesn't sell it. 

What Garden of Eden does sell is the paper, 
word processor, and printer with which I write 
to Softalk. The store has earned my continuing 
trade for its consistently low prices and benefits 
generously extended to the two local computer 
clubs to which I belong. The store's ability to 
offer such prices depends in part upon repu- 
tation, which I feel Mr. Hammers's letter un- 
fairly assails. 

John R. Vallaster, Tustin, CA 
Great Beginnings 

I just wanted to say how pleased I am with one 
of Softalk's contributing columnists, Matthew 
Yuen. I consider myself at a very low level of 
computer expertise. It takes a lot for me to pick 
things up as far as computer language goes. But 
the last four installments of Beginners' Comer 
have been incredibly easy to understand. Mr. 
Yuen writes in a way no textbook or Apple 
DOS handbook can. His articles have all been 
interesting, with a bit of humor and detailed ex- 
planations. I know I am probably asking a lot, 
but is Mr. Yuen planning a book for beginners? 
If so, send me one! I feel that a tutorial written 
by Matthew Yuen would benefit many oth- 
er people greatly. My wife, who has never 
touched a computer before, asked me to explain 
to her what RAM and bytes and kilobytes 
meant. Well, who was I to tell her when I did 
not know myself? After reading the appropriate 
articles by Mr. Yuen, she understood perfectly. 
Chuck Grubb, New York, NY 

Lamentable Limerick Louse-up 

At your contest announcement let 's gander 

Face it, folks, you have got up my dander! 

With your phrases unkind 

These words spring to mirul: 

Defamation . . . and libel . . . and slander! 

Ballot box stuffing? Who are these people 
anyhow? What right do they have to call me 
names like this?! Why, those . . . no! I will not 
lower myself to their level with name calling. 

H'lo, Stu? As my lawyer, I want you to de- 
fine "ballot box stuffing." Yeah? Oh, yeah? 
Well, not only did I not send in more than one 
vote for myself, I never voted at all. Sure, 
George sent in a vote for me, but husbands are 
allowed to be prejudiced, aren't they? Yeah, I 
asked friends to vote for me, but the rules never 
said that was wrong. And I'm sure no one voted 
more than once. 

Gee, Stu, I was so proud of being a finalist 
in a nationwide contest! Not a sweepstakes, 
mind you, but a contest where I felt I had to 
show some talent! So I stood up in front of the 
computer club and told 'em all about it. First I 
asked how many people there read Softalk, the 
magazine that ran the contest. Several people 
raised their hands. Then I stood there and gave 
the magazine a big plug (I probably increased 
their circulation, dam it). I told all the people 
who hadn't raised their hands that it was about 
the only magazine I read cover to cover. I told 



them about the contest and that I was one of the 
finalists. Then I asked if, after looking the lim- 
ericks over, they could vote for me "in good 
conscience." 

No, Stu, I don't really want to sue. I despise 
today's lawsuit mentality. But gosh, here I 
stand, your basic uptight, upright. Corn Belt, 
Bible Belt citizen, and I'm suddenly sorry I ever 
entered that contest. Oh, not because I didn't 
win. I would have liked to have won; at the time 
I even felt like a winner, being a finalist. If that 
was as far as I went, okay. But I do want my 
good name back. 

From North, South, East, and West 

The votes came in for the best. 

And though a rule ne 'er was broken 

Softalk has spoken 

Seeing crime that we hadn 't guessed. 

There 's a reason for my deep, heartfelt 
shame. 

I have cheated . . . or at least that 's the 
claim. 

What I told with pride 

It was thought I should hide. 

And for this you have dirtied my name. 

My name — it's always been something I 
could point to with pride! I told my children, 
there were very few things in the world you 
could call your own. One was your integrity and 
another was your sense of humor. I don't feel at 
all like laughing about this. And I feel like my 
integrity was raped. What's next? Do I find that 
the National Enquirer has named me tax evader 
of the year? 

And what about the other two people who 
were named? The lady who won threatened her 
students with failure. Humph! Who'd want to 
defend someone like that? But wait a second! 
People who write limericks are known to have a 
strange sense of humor. What would I have said 
if someone had called to tell me I'd won the 
contest— and by the way, how did I get that 
many votes? I'm perfectly capable of announc- 
ing flippantly, "I just told all my friends at the 
computer club that unless they wanted their 
homes TP'd they'd better vote for me. " Well, it 
would be half true. I did ask for votes at the 
computer club. I wonder how well the facts 
were checked. 

And then, of course, there's Mr. Sour 
Grapes. It's right to say that the matter of which 
limericks are best is a matter of opinion. Who's 
to say which limericks will have the widest pub- 
lic appeal? It's all very subjective. 

Sounds to me like the contest editor at Sof- 
talk saved those sour grapes, squeezed them, 
fermented them, drank them, let them go to his 
head, and then let them run through his fingers. 
Come on, Nancy, think a bit more positively. 
Lofty thoughts, lofty thou. •. . . 

We should all give our thinking some loft. 

Not just once in a while, but oft. 

So please be advised 

That as you 've advertised 

In your title, your talking is soft. 

Assure me dear ' 'softalk ' 'ing folk 

That those statements were just a bad joke. 

By one out of line 

Who 'd had too much bad wine. 

Or amazingly strange things to toke.

Well, do I stand a chance of being heard by 
these people? Am I wasting my time trying to be 
decent and hold my head up at the same time? 
Will the editors admit that there might be two 
sides to this story, and that we might not be the 
nefarious creatures they painted for all America 
to see? Stay tuned, America! It ought to get in- 
teresting real soon. 

/ can 't tell you just how much frustration 
Conies from bad-mouthing across the 
nation. 

But when all 's said and done 
This has been as much fun 
As three months of nonstop constipation. 
Nancy C. Docken, Minneapolis, MN 

Nancy Docken has explained to me her side of 
the limerick contest story. What is upsetting to 
her is that she has been accused of "stuffing the 
ballot box" in her behalf, and I can't blame her 
for that. 

Surely you must have realized that the po- 
tential for this existed when you invited your 
reading public to vote for their favorite lim- 
erick. I am not about to speculate on who might 
have stuffed the box for Nancy's limerick, or 
what the motive might have been. However, I 
assure you that the Nancy Docken I know 
would never do such a thing herself, nor would 
she condone anyone's doing it in her behalf. I 
have known her as a member of our congrega- 
tion for a number of years. She and her husband 
were the principal youth group advisers for 




many years, and their influence was both appre- 
ciated and solicited. I sincerely hope the recent 
misunderstandings can be cleared up. 
Otto A. Sotnak, pastor. Lake of the Isles 
Lutheran Church, Minneapolis, MN 

When I read in the contest section of the Sep- 
tember issue about voting for the best limerick 
and of all the attendant ballot box stuffing, 
bullying of voters, nepotism, griping from all 
quarters about the outcome, and Lord knows 
what all— there probably was pressure on some 
voters from the mob as well— it made me think 
of a bunch of children squabbling over a new 
toy. Too bad Softalk didn't give the contestants 
the chance to campaign and hold debates. I 
would have had a great time watching them 
scrambling around, digging up dirt on one 
another, slinging mud back and forth, and in 
general acting like children. Good sport, no? 
Vincent Morton, Underhill, VT 

The scatterbrained contest staff regrets that 
Docken took offense to the remark. Though 
many computer-generated ballots with the same 
handwriting, all mailed from the same post of- 
fice on the same day, were sent in for Docken 's 
limerick, Docken states that this devious act was 
not of her doing. And, of course, we believe her. 

Nancy Docken is a law-abiding citizen who 
abhors such things as crooked voting. She 
didn 't even vote for herself! The reference to 
Docken as a ballot box stuffer should be taken

nonseriously. Her minister attests to her char 
acter and we accept this as the gospel truth. 

Good Scientific Sense 

As researchers working in humanistic andJ 
transpersonal psychology, we would like to takee 
this opportunity to comment on Melissa! 
Milich's article, "The Sixth Sense" (June Sof 
talk), which discussed the study of ESP by Dr. 
Tart and his use of an Apple computer in hiS' 
research efforts. 

It seems to us that the article had three 
themes: the use of the Apple computer in a new 
area; the research and theoretical contributions 
of Dr. Tart to the philosophy of science and to 
the empirical investigations of ESP phenomena; 
and the scientific attitude toward, and empirical 
evidence supporting, the belief in ESP 
phenomena. 

We heartily support the use of microcomput- 
ers in all research (as long as they are used in a 
humanistic fashion), including parapsychology, 
for they permit greater experimental control, 
assist in stimulus presentation, help with re- 
cording and scoring data, eliminate human er- 
ror and bias, and reduce routine and drudgery. 
In this regard, we support the article's general 
orientation. 

We are also in agreement with the important 
suggestions Dr. Tart has made in his book, 
Transpersonal Psychologies, regarding how 
science may have led us to make serious and er- 
roneous assumptions about humans, their po- * 
tential, and their relationship to the universe 
around them (such as the possibility that 
through the use of thought we can manipulate 
objects). Nonetheless, simply because science 
has made certain assumptions does not mean 
that the assumptions are wrong; nor does it 
mean that these alternative assumptions are 
correct. 

Furthermore, it should be obvious that the 
advancements in physics, chemistry, medicine, 
as well as in computers, artificial intelligence, 
and programming theory have been the result 
of our current scientific and technological as- 
sumptions and not the outcome of belief in wit- 
ches, flying saucers, auras, ghosts, or ESP. 
These latter concepts have been around for 
thousands of years and have added nothing to 
our accumulation of knowledge regarding the 
prediction or control of natural phenomena. 
They seem to act only as potential hypotheses 
for retesting in each new generation of believ- 
ers. We suggest that, because of the lack of ESP 
research, many an experimenter testing ESP hy- 
potheses has wasted time and money. In spite of 
this negative evaluation, however, we do ap- 
plaud researchers and granting agencies who 
are willing to take on the sizable risk of investi- 
gating a difficult but testable area of research. 

Our most serious disagreement with the arti- 
cle centers on the presentation of the concept of 
ESP. In our judgment the author creates the im- 
pression that ESP exists but we simply do not 
have the right tools and scientific method to get 
it out. This is an unjustifiable impression given 
the current state of ESP knowledge. In fact, we 
propose an alternative hypothesis well known to 
computer freaks: garbage in, garbage out. The 
same lack of understanding and bizarre results

can be generated in scientific research if you try 
to investigate a phenomenon that does not exist. 

We certainly agree that there are numerous 
strange phenomena in the world around us, but 
we do not believe it wise to fall back automat- 
ically on paranormal explanations to understand 
what is happening. Scientists do not fear or 
avoid these topics, as the Milich article suggests; 
rather they have found, as we have through per- 
sonal experience, that ESP occurrences are un- 
reliable and difficult to validate. Moreover, it 
must be remembered that the vast majority of 
personal, cultural, and even scientific ideas 
about nature turn out to be wrong. There is no 
life on Venus, as pictured in ancient books; the 
sun is not eaten by a dragon during an eclipse, 
the earth is not carried by a large turtle in an 
ocean; and mental illness is not possession by 
the devil. While we certainly cannot disprove 
the existence of ESP, we believe that, given the 
frauds, mistakes, the natural phenomena in- 
volved, as well as the weak and inconsistent 
ESP research findings, the strong popular belief 
in these paranormal phenomena is misplaced. 

It is our feeling that this positive attitude 
toward the paranormal, the occult, and the 
mysterious is partially the result of countless 
present-day movies and books such as Chariots 
of the Gods, Psychic Discoveries behind the 
Iron Curtain, and The Bermuda Triangle, all of 
which lead people to become less skeptical than 
normal. We would like to suggest that people 
read the following nonbestsellers, which pre- 
sent a totally different and, in our judgment, 
more accurate evaluation of the whole paranor- 
mal field: The Psychology of Transcendence by 
A. Neher, Psychology of the Psychic by D. 
Marks and R. Kammann, Science and the Para- 
normal by G. Abell and B. Singer, and The 
Skeptical Inquirer, a journal on paranormal 
phenomena. 

Finally, we leave you with this small prob- 
lem: We are going to adopt the belief that the 
reason your Apple computer works is because a 
little devil eats electricity, likes to live in a clean 
little house called a microprocessor, and gets 
mad and won't work when you send him letters 
(programs) that are not up to his spelling stan- 
dards. Furthermore, we get to use circular 
arguments, ignore contradictory data, make our 
theory as complex as we like, create new con- 
cepts to explain away inconsistent results, and 
distort facts and overemphasize the importance 
of positive experimental results. It is now your 
job to conclusively disprove the existence of the 
little devil. 

If you come to the conclusion that you can- 
not do so, you are right! In the same fashion, if 
you want to believe in ESP, as most people do, 
then you can always find some manner of ex- 
plaining away the poor experimental findings. 
If you are willing to face the facts, however, 
you will eventually come to the conclusions that 
it is better to use the concepts of electricity or 
Boolean logic to explain computer phenomena 
and that it is better to use psychology, learning, 
and social interaction than ESP terms to explain 
human behavior.

A Closer Examination 

I would like to follow up on the Lisa article by 
Roger Wagner and Joe Holt ("Lisa— Up Close 
and Personal," September 1983) with some 
comments on Lisa's virtual memory. The arti- 
cle overlooked a very real barrier to fully utiliz- 
ing Lisa's virtual memory capability. 

Although sixteen megabytes of space may 
sound rather magical to the legions of eight- and 
sixteen-bit micro users, virtual memory is not 
magic. As described in the article, virtual mem- 
ory is only a process that manipulates memory 
images so that RAM appears (to the user and the 
processor) larger than it really is. But there 
must be some kind of auxiliary memory me- 
dium available to carry out that manipulation. 
And the size of RAM plus the auxiliary memory 
must be big enough to hold all of the used por- 
tions of the logical address space. Lisa's auxil- 



iary memory device is Apple's five-megabyte 
ProFile Winchester disk. 

The bottom line is that, while Lisa's archi- 
tecture provides a sixtecn-mcgabyte address 
space, it isn't nearly all usable in the presently 
available configuration. The five-megabyte 
ProFile (less the portion used for system and ap- 
plication software) plus one-megabyte RAM de- 
fines the maximum extent of usable virtual 
memory. (I don't know if Lisa allows using the 
two 0.8-megabyte "twiggies" to extend that, 
but it would be slow anyway.) 

Lisa's thirty-two-bit processor, one-mega- 
byte RAM, and other state-of-the-art features 
are certainly exciting— but don't get carried 
away just yet figuring out how to use all sixteen 
megabytes of address space. If Apple is really 
serious about touting Lisa as a sixteen-megabyte 
logical address space machine, it had better get

serious about offering a fast twenty-megabyte 
Winchester disk as part of the deal. 
Henry Burks, Dallas, TX 

I eagerly read the Lisa article in the September 
Softalk, but when I got around to studying the 
accompanying pictures, 1 noticed something 
strange. In figure 12 on page 151 there is no left 
parenthesis above the 9 key. There is a right pa- 
renthesis above the 0, but the other parenthesis 
is missing. If you look carefully at figure 10 on 
the previous page, you'll notice it is missing 
there, too. To see if this was a one-time phe- 
nomenon, I started to look at the other reviews 
of the Lisa. I finally found a picmre of the key- 
board in another magazine. In the two pictures 

X Z=yK H K H K HK H 



showing the Lisa keyboard, the left parenthesis 
is above the 9 key, but there is no asterisk above 
the 8 key. What gives? Is someone going 
around replacing normal keycaps with mutant 
keycaps? Is this another "feature" of the 
Lisa — nonphotographable keycaps? Please en- 
lighten me. I personally believe it is either Ap- 
ple's way of marking free Lisas or a silly pho- 
tographic effect. 

Richard H. Bums, Independence, MO 

The pictures of Lisa in Softalk 's article were 
of a prerelease model on loan from Apple. Since 
then, the keyboard has undergone some minor 
changes. Rest assured that production models 
have both the parenthesis and the asterisk. 



Another discrepancy you might run across is 
that early keyboards had a key marked "com- 
mand ' ' where the apple key is now. 

Vive la Difference 

Every week Softsel publishes a bestsellers sheet 
that presumably is the result of sales from some 
three thousand retail stores in all fifty states. Sof- 
talk publishes its monthly Bestsellers. Why is it 
that the two lists vary so much? Don't these stores 
give you guys the same information? The most 
obvious "error" is that Softalk has listed the 
Apple Writer lie word processor as the nation's 
bestselling disk for the past several months, but 
it doesn't even appear among the top thirty-five 
business programs (where the word processors 
are listed) on Softsel's listing! Hey, what's the 
story? Who's screwed up, and why is there such 
a difference? 

James C. Benton, Lake Bluff, IL 

Softalk and Softsel aren 't reporting on the 
same kinds of sales, which is why their reports 
do not agree. Softalk measures only sales made 
to end users. Softsel measures only sales they 
make to retail stores. The obvious difference 
there is that, when an end user takes home a 
disk, it 's his. When Softsel sells a disk to a retail 
store, they may get it returned. 

Second, Softsel is only a portion of the mar- 
ketplace, albeit the biggest portion. Softalk 
polls practically no stores that use Softsel as an 
exclusive source of supply. Most retail stores 
buy from more than one distributor arul, in the 
cases where it 's more practical, directly from 
the software publishers. Softalk 'j numbers are 
therefore more inclusive. 

Third, Softsel is reporting all their sales of a 
given title in all markets. When they report Zax- 
xon, for example, they are reporting Apple and 
Atari sales. Softalk measures only Apple sales. 

The final difference comes from the fact that 
Softsel doesn 't carry every product. All they 're 
reporting on is what they carry. In the specific 
instance you cite, Softsel is not authorized to 
carry Apple Writer, so they don 't report it. That 
doesn 't change the fact that Apple Writer is 
outselling everything else. 

One last word: Don 't be so anxious to im- 
pose order on an unorderly market. Both Soft- 
sel 's and Softalk 's numbers are accurate. But 
both are only reflections of the market from dif- 
ferent perspectives. By observing the differences 
and understanding them, rather than being 
frustrated by them, the astute observer will 
come to understand more about the market dy- 
namics than most of the so-called experts be- 
ing quoted hither and yon in other journals 
these days.

tember DOStalk article. It was most interesting, 
since I'm one of those considering use of 
Diversi-DOS to load DOS onto my language

between DOS and its buffers, and I use a slight- 
ly modified DOS. Therefore, the warning to 
commercial writers about finding DOS and

WE'RE VERY HARD ON OURSOFTWARE 

You might even say we're perfectionists. Because at Softsmith™ we give our software tlie liardest wori^out, 
the toughest testing, the most rigorous evaluation. The result is software that has earned our confidence, and 
will justify yourtrust. 

In particular, we do three things that make Softsmith software the most dependable you can buy. 



1. 

We're picky. Out of the hundreds 
of programs Softsmith evaluates 
every month, we choose to 
publish very few. A lot of good pro- 
grams are rejected; but we think 
you can't be too picky when it 
comes to personal computer soft- 
ware. Our selectivity is your best 
assurance of quality. 



2. 

We complain a lot. If you were a 
programmer, and Softsmith 
accepted your program, you 
would have a right to be proud. 
But you shouldn't go on vacation 
yet. Because no matter how good 
that program may be, Softsmith 
evaluators will suggest some 
improvements; politely, but firmly. 
We may complain a lot, but 
people thank us later. 



We insist on plain English. After 
we've made the best program 
better, we're still not finished. 
Because we know that even the 
best program is no good if it's too 
hard to use. So we put a lot of time 
and effort into translating our 
instructions from computerese 
into plain English. 



We publish software you can trust. Yes, we pick our programs carefully. And complain a lot to make them better. And insist 
on plain English instructions. The result is a library of personal computer software you can depend on. Even if you don't know 
a Pascal compiler from an emulation subroutine. 

Softsmith has programs you can trust for all the most popular personal computers. Programs for Education, Home Manage- 
ment, Entertainment, Word Processing, Business, Communications and Programming. Ours is the largest library of quality 
software under one brand name. 

So before you choose a software package for your computer, make sure someone's taken the time to be hard on it. Make sure 
it's Softsmith, the software you can trust. 

Ask for Softsmith brand software wherever computers or software are sold. Or call us TOLL-FREE at (800) 341-4000 for the

the doctor ordered. It is a chal- 
lenging, intelligent game that will 
help you improve your vocabulary 
while you're having fun. 

With Crossword Magic, you create 
your own puzzles to challenge your 
friends. First you choose a topic; 
then you enter words using the 
keyboard. Crossword Magic auto- 
matically fits the common letters 
together to form a familiar cross- 
word grid. If there is no opening for 
the word you enter, the program 
saves it and fits it in later 



Next comes the fun. After the 
puzzle is full, Crossword Magic 
prompts you for a clue to go with 
each word. Make your clues as 
obscure, humorous or serious as 
you want. You can save the puzzle 
and clues on disk for later play on 
the screen, or have them printed 
out to send to friends. 

Crossword Magic runs on the 
Apple®ll, II -I- and lie; Franklin 
Ace™ and Atari 800® computers 
with 48K RAM. A disk drive is re- 
quired; printer is optional. 
More than just a game. Crossword

appropriate, if it could be arranged, for every 
software house that is writing or nationally 
marketing assembly language programs to have 
these and similar rules carved in stone (or at 
least plastic) on their premises and included in 
some sort of prepublication check list. This 
would avoid "stuff" that might cause user 
problems from getting out die door and reflect- 
ing badly on the entire industry. 

Old subject wiUi perhaps a new twist: How 
about a real reader service card in Softalkl 
Limit die numbers of inquiries to perhaps diree 
to five items and also have those requesting 
more information to briefly describe their 
equipment on a check list of some kind. The 
twist is that suppliers privileged to be included 
on such a card should be restricted to an elite 
few who agree to respond wiUi hard information 
more fully describing dieir products, pointing 
out slot or communication card conflicts that 
might occur, and including information on what 
else is needed. No surprises! 

It is frustrating to send back the standard 
bingo card from other magazines only to re- 
ceive a photocopy of the original ad— when what 
you really wanted was hard information on 
which to base a buying decision. Too often the 
local dealer hasn't got the product in question 
and (unbelievably) knows less about it than 
you do. 

I enjoy and look forward to Softalk each 
month. I do wish, however, that you would con- 
sider a second CP/M card column, only this 
time at the beginner's level. Also, how about an 
occasional guest columnist discussing Forth? 

The new If Then Maybe column is a great 
addition. Keep it up! Relating to Tom Weis- 
haar's response about the disk I/O prob- 
lem (September issue), he is probably right 
about the shielding. I had similar problems with 
one drive. At first I thought it might be 
speed-related. The repair shop also failed to 
find any electrical or mechanical problem. At 
home again, after checking for possible low 
voltage at die outlets, I hooked up the system on 
the floor and tried again. It worked perfecUy. It 
seems my newly repaired television set was 
now putting out more interference; so if I keep 
that drive about eighteen inches from die televi- 
sion, it works just fine. Maybe diis experience 
will help odiers and save diem a few dollars in 
unnecessary shop time.

Ups and Downs in Pascal 

After reading die letters concerning die use of 
Apple Pascal on die Apple He, I too would like 
to make a comment. I have been working in 
Pascal recendy and I always felt it was a shame 
not to use the up and down arrows on my key- 
board. After some searching in the very confus- 
ing and not very helpful mess known as die Ap- 
ple Pascal Operating System Reference Man- 
ual, I realized diat it could be done. Since exter- 
nal terminals may be configured for Apple Pas- 
cal, I realized diat die key to my modification 
existed in die file System. Miscinfo, on Applel : . 
To make Apple Pascal use die up and down ar- 
rows (control-K and controI-J respectively), 
make the following change to your Applel:

Please note that the track and sector given

A Clue to the Culprit 

I have a question regarding the Base Converter 
program listed in the October Basic Solution. 
After loading the program, I found that I could 
not use the escape key (ASCII code 2) to return 
to the menu. It just wouldn't respond. I 
substituted "Hit M key to get Menu" and its 
ASCII code, which works just fine. 

Can you give me a clue as to the reason the 
escape key won't work? I have an Apple He 
with the Apple eighty-column card and the 
Microsoft Z-80 SoftCard installed. I do use the 
escape key with the Program Line Editor, so I 
know it can work. 
Duane AUman, New Berlin, WI 

David Durkee responds: 

Unless PLE intercepts escape codes (I tried it 
with GPLE, which turns out not to), the only 
thing I can think of is that your eighty-column 
firmware was on when you ran the program. 
With the eighty-column card active, escape 
turns on escape editing, even within a get state- 
ment! If this is what is happening, the cursor on 
the screen will turn into an inverse plus sign. To 
prevent this, add the statement: 

5 PRINT CHR$(27); CHR$(1 7) 

If this doesn't work, I can't imagine what the 
culprit could be. Leave it at "Hit M to get 
Menu." 

David Durkee, Burbank, CA 
More Contest 

One of the contest answers in the September 
Softalk is inaccurate, if not incorrect (page 299, 
the answer to question 5a). The first Apple II 
reference manual was a conglomeration of 
Steve Wozniak's notes and assorted listings 
from engineering, though Chris Espinoza did 
write the authoritative and erudite second Apple 

II Reference Manual. 

Bana Tognazzini, San Francisco, CA 

The question in the June quiz was to name 
the work written by Christopher Espinoza, not 
to name the source of the first Apple reference 
manual. 

Rank Response 

As a rank beginner who had the misfortune of 
starting with an Apple HI, I would like to com- 
ment on the letter from Julian LeRoi in the Sep- 
tember Open Discussion. I find that throwing 
the letter out of the window is preferable to 
sending it to Apple. When one throws the letter 
out the window, one needn't put postage on it; 
anyone who has had this experience will find 
that the results are identical.

More If Then 

I would like to comment on some of the things 
that have appeared in the new column, If Then 
Maybe. First of all, about using both sides of 
disks: If you can use a hole punch, kits are 
absolutely useless. I may not be a com- 
puter-repair person, but I do have over one 
hundred disks. I use the back of every single 
disk I buy that does not have a program on it. 
Even though I have never used one of those 
disk head cleaners, and my disk drive is about 
three years old, I have never had a single disk 
go bad (without messing it up myself, that is). 
Also, the disks I use are not fancy; most of 
them are the cheapest I could find at the time I 
bought them. All are single sided and single den- 
sity. So I would say that, unless your informa- 
tion is incredibly important, there is absolutely 
no problem with using both sides of any disk. 

I'd also like to comment on Ed Melo's let- 
ter in the September If Then Maybe. Word 
Handler uses A-type files for all its data. This 
has its merits, I suppose. Another program 
can't accidentally mess up the files. However, 
this does pose problems when you try to use a 
spelling program with a Word Handler file: 
Forget it. The only way would be to change the 
files to text or binary in the VTOC, run the 
spelling program, and then change the files 
back. That is not worth the trouble. 

Next, I would like to add to the list of soft- 
ware and hardware companies that have been 
praised; my contribution is Sir-tech. When I 
bought my Knight of Diamonds disk, I had 
many problems with it, but the main problem 



was very subtle and I wasn't sure whether the 
error had been there for a long time. I even- 
tually sent in the disk with a letter describing 
the problem. I knew that there was usually a 
ten-dollar charge for replacing damaged disks, 
but I just crossed my fingers. What I got back 
was a brand-new disk — free of charge— which, 
by the way, was a newer version of the pro- 
gram than my old disk. Also included was a 
friendly, handwritten letter that fully explained 
the problem. So now that Legacy ofLlylgamyn 
has been released, I have one thing to say: 
Don't give a second thought to after-sale sup- 
port from the company. 
Matthew Machlis, Temple City, CA 

I just wanted to make a little addition to the 
comments made by Roy Hicks in the September 
If Then Maybe column. Hicks was answering a 
question on how to adjust an Apple Monitor EH 
so that the display from a Videx Videoterm 
would not go off the screen. 

I recently had a similar problem when I was 
shopping for a monitor, and I tried my Video- 
term on a friend's Monitor III. The picture 
rolled off the screen slightly. I called up Videx 
and asked them whether the problem was due to 
the board or monitor. They replied that this 
problem occurs due to a small incompatibility 
between the Videoterm and the Monitor III. They 
also mentioned that if I decided to get a Monitor 
III, they could rebum the firmware chip on my 
Videoterm so that the display would be moved 
over. This would eliminate the need for messing 
with the controls on the Moinitor III. All I 



would need to do is send my firmware chip back 
to Videx, and they would rebum it and send it 
back to me— all at no cost! I think that this is just 
another example of great support from a great 
company.

SoftGraph Mods 

To David Durkee: 

I have been running SoftGraph since last 
April and have found it to be one of the most 
useful programs in n.y file. I am using it to keep 
track of the high, low, close, and net asset value 
changes of my mutual funds with the line 
graphing function and the data editor. How- 
ever, I have spent considerable time trying to 
incorporate an improvement with no success; 
perhaps you may be able to help. 

As an example, I bought a fiind at thirty -two 
dollars a share and it is now about thirty-seven 
dollars a share. When I try to graph the price- 
per-share movements (with the base at thirty 
dollars and the top at forty dollars) the high- and 
low-finder routine (lines 2950 through 3060) 
always sets the low Y at 0, thereby crowding 
the data at the top of the graph. (I realize that I 
could set the high Y at sixty dollars and get the 
data in the center of the graph, but the changes 
would be restricted to a very narrow range on 
such a large scale.) In this example, I would like 
to set the low Y at thirty dollars and go from 
there. I have tried setting LV at the initial 
V(Y,X) in line 2960, rearranging lines 3000 
and 3010, and other modifications that either 
did not work or caused unwanted changes else- 
where. 

Perhaps I'm asking for more sophistication 
than was originally intended in the program, but 
if you have a solution it would be super. 
Paul M. Wood, Danvers, MA 

David Durkee responds: 

This has been an oft-requested change to Soft- 
Graph. The code differences aren't that sophis- 
ticated, but it isn't as simple as changing the 
default value of zero for the low value to some 
value known to be included in the actual data, as 
you have tried. That is only part of the problem. 
There is also the consideration that zero was the 
assumed baseline for all graphs, meaning that 
the bars in bar charts start at the Y = 0 line, and 
a solid line is drawn at Y = 0 after the bars are 
plotted. The trick in allowing graphs in which 
the Y range doesn't include zero is assigning an 
alternate baseline value (BL) and substituting it 
for the zero in a number of equations. 

BL will equal zero, if zero is within the Y 
range. If the whole Y range is greater than zero, 
BL will equal LY (the lowest Y value). If the Y 
range is entirely negative, BL will be equal to 
GY (the greatest Y value), meaning bars will 
extend from the top instead of the bottom. This 
emphasizes that the values are negative. Re- 
moving the new line 1296 will defeat this fea- 
ture if you don't like it. 

Here are the necessary changes. These 
should be typed in to the Bar/Line Chart pro- 
gram fi-om the article in last April's issue. Some 
of the lines are new; some are modifications of 
old lines. If you've added your own changes to 
Bar/Line Chan, try to make these on an original

Because our new Micro Cookbook makes it easier 

than ever for you to bake, 
broil, roast, iry and fric- 
assee 'em. 
Not just by giving you 
over 150 recipes— which it 
does, but by simplifying the 
whole art, of cooking. 
You see, with Micro Cookbook, 
you no longer have to battle an over- 
crowded, confused box of worn index cards 
before you can make a meal. (A battle which can ruin 
anyone's appetite.) 

Instead, simply insert Micro Cookbook into your 
computer and call up the recipe your heart and stom- 
ach desire. Just ask for a recipe by name, ingredients, 
or category. And because the program works on a 
simple "fill-in-the-blank" method, you don't have to 
be a computer whiz to do it, either. 

The recipe you select can be one of the mouth- 
watering dishes we include, or you can create a disk- 
ette of your own favorites. And you can constantly 
modify your selections, adding new triumphs and 
removing recipes that, ah, bomb. 



But Micro Cookbook is much more than iiicxl 
em technology's version of the file box. With it, 
you can also get a clear, organized print-out of 
your shopping list, quickly adjust the serving 
size, even index the favorite recipes of your 
most finicky eater. 

And it includes a complete glossary and calorie 
and nutrition guides. 

What it all boUs down to, is that Micro Cook- 
book wiU make life in the kitchen a breeze. 

With this in mind, is it any wonder Micro 
Cookbook makes these guys so nervous?

Conveniently Copyable Data 

First, I want to compliment David Chandler on 
his fine review of Money Street in the Septem- 
ber issue of Softalk. A review can be so impor- 
tant for growing companies. 

Second, I want to clear up one minor inac- 
curacy, which is really more our fault than 
Chandler's. He mentioned that our utility disk 
was necessary to copy data disks. We failed to 
make clear in our documentation that any track 
copy program, like CopyA, will copy our data 
disks. The copy program on the utility disk is 
for convenience.

Quote Unquote 

In a letter in the October Open Discussion, I 
asked about the name of CHR$(96). It appeared 
in the magazine as a backslash, CHR$(92), 
whereas it should have been an alternate quota- 
tion mark ('). 

Jerry Van Cleeff, Montgomery, AL 

I have been an Apple II Plus user for about a 
year and a half now, and I am always out to im- 
prove the hardware. I bought the Videx Video- 
term and redefined most of the character fonts 
to my specifications. Now when I run Apple 
Writer II, everything looks real nice. I also 
made an inverse set. I recommend the Videx 
card to anyone serious about eighty columns. 
The customer service is the best! 

To answer Jerry Van Cleeff (October Open 
Discussion): This is a tilde (~'). This (|) is sim- 
ply a vertical bar; it can be handy in text format- 
ting. Lastly, the opposite of (/) is the backslash. 
Apple Writer cannot print the backslash because 
it is an underline command; ( ) is an under- 
score! 

Martin Veider, Camarillo, CA 

Penguin's Improvements 

Finally I get to give a simple answer to a simple 
question in Open Discussion! David Moore 
wrote a letter in the October issue asking about 



software available for the Houston Instrument 
Hipad. He even mentioned that he was looking 
for something like Special Effects or the Com- 
plete Graphics System from Penguin Software. 
Well, guess what! The new Complete Graphics 
System is acmally a vastly improved combina- 
tion of both the Complete Graphics System and 
Special Effects, and it works with paddles, joy- 
stick, trackball, Apple Graphics Tablet, Hipad, 
or KoalaPad— all in one version. (The stores 
should appreciate having to stock only one ver- 
sion instead of half a dozen.) Everything in the 
package has been modernized to make it a lot 
easier to use, from selection screens using icons 
to automatic packing of all graphic images. 
Users who own the Complete Graphics System 
and Special Effects should ask Penguin Soft- 
ware about updating their old versions. There is 
a fee that varies depending on what you current- 
ly have. Dealers should return any old stock for 
credit against the new versions. The way to 
identify the new version is that it's in a box, as 
opposed to flat packaging. 

Back to the Hipad: The new version of 
Graphics Magician is also compatible with all 
the input devices listed above. There are no 
longer separate versions of it either, and up- 
dates are available.

Legal Sleuth

developed software for the Apple that would 
prepare certain legal documents. Perhaps some- 
one could provide some more information re-

Count Your Blessings 

I was moved by the October Backtalk that told 
of Leslie Evans and her Apple. I hope I am but 
one of many to respond. If Leslie can operate 
the computer, designing an on/off device that 
she can operate is simplicity itself. I can think of 
any number of simple relay devices that would 
allow her to control her Apple. 

If there is a need, I will be happy to provide 
design and construction services, and I think 
it should be easy to get materials donated. 
Any donors among Softalk readers? Write me 
through Open Discussion. Let's get Leslie's 
Apple under her own direct control. 

I would also like Leslie to know that I ad- 
mire her spunk and her smile. She helps me 
realize how great my blessings and small my 
problems are.

Softalk to the rescue! If you've been stumped by some- 
thing Apple, then take heart: maybe someone from the 
Softalk Applewise Guild and Experts' Syndicate can 
help. Choose an expert from among the likes of Doug 
Carlston. Bob Clardy, David Durkee, Roy Hicks, John 
Jeppson, Mark Pelczarski, Jock Root. Roger Wagner, 
Tom Weishaar, and Matthew 'Yuen. 'You can direct 
your questions, typed or printed, and double-spaced 
(please), to a specific expert or just write to this col- 
umn. Send all letters to Softalk Sages, Box 60. North 
Hollywood, CA 91603. We can't answer questions 
about the products of .specific vendors: instead, we 
recommend you contact them directly or see your 
dealer. 




I need help. I recently 
bought an Apple lie, two 
drives, a dot-matrix printer, Thunderclock, and 
Hayes Micromodem. That was in March 1983. 
I'm still floundering on making my equipment 
function; I'm trying to learn. The manuals and 
the other books I have don't seem to cover 
things clearly. What do you recommend I do? Is 
there any disk with lessons that I can buy? 
Which disks do you recommend? John Ricksen,

The first thing to do is to 
try getting help from the 
dealer who sold you your system. Though the 
dealer has little to gain by helping you, except 
your future business, some dealers are quite 
helpful when it comes to after-sale support. If 
that proves futile, the best place to start is with 
someone who once was in the same situation. 

People with Apples like to band together in 
user groups. These are usually found wherever 
there are people with Apples. In other words, 
virtually everywhere. When user groups meet, 
members share Apple-related information in the 
form of help sessions, product demonstrations, 
and tips on how to do things better. This includes 
getting the most out of printers, clock cards, 
and modems. Computer dealers can sometimes 
recommend a local user group. Sometimes 
groups hold their meetings at the dealer's store; 
large groups sometimes meet in the local high 
school gymnasium. 

If your dealer can't recommend a group, the 
International Apple Core (908 George Street, 
Santa Clara, CA 95050) can probably let you 
know of one of its member groups in your area. 
Matthew Yuen 

A couple of issues ago 
Roger Wagner presented 
a hi-res character generator in his column. As I 
was going over some of my back issues, I saw 
an earlier program that gives the user 560 half 
pixels. Suddenly 1 realized it was probably 
possible to have eighty-column text. You would 
need to write a program to define shapes for use 
with the 560 half pixels. Then you could have 
the normal seven-by-eight Apple characters with 
eighty columns! Jeff Cook, Arlington, VA 




^Uft§ You're right! You can 

* I use the Apple hi-res 

screen to give more than a forty-column text 
display. The bad news is that you can't do 
eighty columns. The good news is that you can 
do seventy! 

Here's why: On each line of the hi-res screen 
you've got forty bytes that hold all the data for 



every possible dot that can be illuminated. Since 
7 bits are used in each byte (the eighth is not 
displayed), that gives a total of 280 bits (7 times 
40) to store our information in. For seventy 
characters, we should allocate 4 bits (280/70) 
per character. Unfortunately, for eighty 
characters the result is 3.5 bits (280/80) per 
character. I know you're thinking that the 
560-dot routine should somehow get around 
this, but the inescapable fact is that you can't 
avoid sharing a half bit each for two adjacent 
characters. Since you can't have a half bit, the 
last plotted character has the possibility of 
dominating that middle bit and thus distorting 
the first character. The 560 mode is possible, 
but remember it came with the warning that ad- 
jacent positions can affect each other. With 
seventy characters, each bit "knows" who it 
belongs to, so you don't have the obvious dis- 
tortion pattern. 

Mom always said not to believe authority 
(and since she was my mom, I had to believe 
her), so here's an experiment you can do to 
verify the 70/80 debate. 

First, here's an Applesoft Basic program to 
type in. It uses the PLOT. 560-1- routine given 
in the July '82 installment of Assembly Lines. If 
you don't have that issue handy, then shame on

When you run this program, you should get 
two rows of letter A's: one with eighty characters 
per line, the other with seventy. The program also 
counts the characters it's printing at the bottom 
of the screen, so you won't get eyestrain count- 
ing all those little buggers. The data statement at 
the end of the program is just an X,Y data table 
of all the points in the letter "A" pattern. If you 
really want a challenge, rewrite the program in 
machine language or, better yet, come up with a 
bit-mapping seventy-character generator. Roger 
Wagner 

I really enjoyed entering 
the final graphics pro- 
gram in Mark Pelczarski's series. However, I 
found that I needed to use the shift key to per- 
form the functions of paddle 1 . Could this be 
because I have modified my Apple II Plus for 
upper/lower case? Paddle 1 seems to be fine 
with other programs. Heather D. Mayor, Hous- 
ton, TX 




Yes and no. (Don't you 
hate those kinds of an- 
swers?) "Yes," because the only way that the 
shift key could be mistaken for a paddle button 
is if a standard shift-key-mod wire were in- 
stalled. The shift-key mod, as read by a number 
of Apple n Plus word processors, works by act- 
ting as button 2 (most joysticks and paddle sets 
use only buttons 0 and 1). The modifying of the 
typed characters to upper or lower case is done 
in software (see lines 20 through 140, especially 
line 40, of the program in Ilnd Grade Chats, 
October 1983, page 210, to see how this 
works). 

"No," because chances are that there is an 
error in the code for the Graphically Speaking 
program as you typed it. Check line 292 of the 
listing against the magazine. This is where pad- 
dle 1 is read. If the address in the peek state- 
ment there is -16285 instead of -16286, tiiat 
is where your problem is. Peek (-16286) reads 
button 1 . Peek (-16285) reads button 2, or the 
shift-key mod. 

The other possibility, and this is highly 
unlikely if your shift-key mod works with any 
of your programs, is that the modification wire 
is attached to the wrong line of the game I/O 




port. Examine it carefully: The wire should be 
connected to the fourth pin from the front of the 
computer on the right-hand side of the game 
connector. David Durkee. 

I own an Apple III and I 
need a program for 
dumping the graphics screen to my Epson 
printer. How .GRAFIX is coded is a mystery to 
me. All I really need is an efficient way to read 
the grafix driver (black and white, hi-res) into 
any sort of array; I can handle the printer in its 
graphics mode. The Pascal Programmer's 
Manual suggests reading a sequence of suc- 
cessive pixels with UNITREAD(3,...,12). This 
seems wrong; it reads only one pixel. My pro- 
grams using this take twenty-five minutes to 
print one screen. Also, by accident I found that 
SEPARATE is a forbidden identifier in Pascal. 
Is it a secret reserved word? Harley Flanders, 
Boca Raton, FL 



THCH 



UNITREAD will return 
as many bytes from 
.GRAFIX as you request (up to 32K). Unfor- 
tunately, however, it is just reading the same 
pixel over and over again — the pixel at the cur- 
rent cursor position. According to the Pascal 
Programmer's Manual and the Standard Device 
Drivers Manual, UNITREAD should return 
successive pixels in a given direction on the 
screen, and you are supposed to be able to pick 
the direction with a command to the driver. But 
no such command is documented. We assume 
that this entire section simply never got written 
or debugged in time for publication. 

There is a fairly quick way to move pixel in- 
formation into a Pascal array. Just save the 
screen to a fotofile on disk with GSAVE and 
then move it back into an array with 
BLOCKREAD. It's clumsy, and you wUl have 
to figure out the storage scheme within the ar- 
ray, but it works. For real speed, however, the 
grafix dump should be an assembly module that 
directly reads the graphics memory area (with 
extended addressing) and immediately transfers 
the data to the printer driver by a SOS call. 

You are absolutely right: SEPARATE is not 
allowed. Apparently it is an undocumented 
reserved word used at Pascal's system level. 
John Jeppson 

My first question is 
about the USR (X) func- 
tion in Applesoft. I would like to know the 
what, where, and how of this function. 

In the September If Then Maybe column a 
question was raised about using the character 
fonts in ROM. The person answering stated that 
this couldn't be done because the chip with the 
fonts was separate from everything else. My 
question is, can't you use the CHRGET rou- 
tine in the Apple to get these characters? The 
CHRGET routine is supposedly found at $00B1 
through $00C8. This routine is used by Apple- 
soft every time it wants another character. 
Chuck Heatherly, Raleigh, NC 




in the parentheses is also evaluated and the 
result put in a part of memory called the floating 
point accumulator (FAC), which specifically 
corresponds to locations $9D through SAB. 
This is contrasted to a normal call statement, 
which just jumps to the memory address of your 
choice without processing any data from the 
Applesoft program unless you use your own 
special techniques. The USR function is in 
some ways more like the ampersand (&) func- 
tion because it always jumps to the same loca- 
tion (1013 decimal for the &) and then expects 
to find a jump vector there. Like the call, the 
ampersand also has no provision for evaluating 
data following the ampersand, so the program- 
mer must provide for this in his or her own 
routine. For the in-depth answers to the USR 
function and the finer points of call and amper- 
sand statements, see the January, February, and 
November 1982 installments of Softalk's As- 
sembly Lines column. 

The reason you can't use CHRGET (or 
anything else, for that matter) to read the 
character generator ROM is that, although the 
ROM is a digital device with readable ad- 
dresses, none of those addresses are wired to 
the normal Apple memory address lines. In any 
given program you can examine only memory 
locations $0 through $FFFF. Because the 
character generator ROM is not wired into any 
of these locations, no program can see what the 
data in the ROM is. By the way, sorry about 
the length of that character set. It had to be that 
long to include the complete character set. 
Roger Wagner JM 



Jffllf Regarding the USR(X) 

I function of Applesoft, 

the simple answer is that the USR function is 
identical to a call 10 except that the expression

From Sargori

While the Computer Revolution may be an unprecedented force over 
on the Left Coast, such upheavals are old news in traditionally conser- 
vative New England. It is here, after all, that America's revolution was 
conceived and propagated, and, not long after, this comer of the country 
became the cradle of the Industrial Revolution. Manufacturing thrived, 
supplying the growing nation with everything from machine tools to 
armaments and later with the finer things of living, including quality 
tableware and woven cloth. Textiles in particular made efficient use of 
the Northeast's abundant water power, and mill towns that sprang up on 
the banks of every river came to be the economic hubs of the region. 

It was in this setting that the first industrial software was employed, 
in an era before the 1849 Gold Rush had elevated California from

frontier wilderness to an important population center. Borrowing 
technology from the mills of Europe, the early innovators in the Boston 
area used an ingenious punchcard device to program weaving patterns 
into their looms, dramatically reducing the amount of operator time and 
attention required to produce the raw material of clothing and 
upholstery. The mills themselves, even from our perspective a century 
and a half later, were remarkably advanced. 

In the city of Lowell, Massachusetts, a system of canals was built to 
distribute better the forces of an eastward-flowing river, and along those 
canals a highly refined manufacturing center flourished. Enormous tur- 
bines, doubly driven by the fall and the flow of the river, powered miles 
of machines that converted cotton to cloth; through these came great ad-

vances in efficiency and in achieving healthy working conditions. 

Home on the Technology Highway. It was to this setting that Oscar 
Rodriguez brought the newly formed Hayden Software Company in 
1982. Nowadays, of course, the Boston area's driving force is brain- 
power, not water power. State Route 128 is billboarded as America's 
Technology Highway; that's not an overstatement, but simply a reflec- 
tion of the many leading-edge, think-tank business concerns that are 
headquartered here. 

Oscar Rodriguez holds the title of president at Hayden Software, but 
that hardly describes his role. He was chosen for the post when the soft- 
ware division separated from the parent, Hayden Book Company, a sub- 
sidiary of Hayden Publishing that had been involved in microcomputer 
software since 1979. 

Rodriguez's first task in the creation of a front-line software company 
was to locate office space, and it was a refurbished textile mill along a 
canal of the Merrimack River that he chose as "the proper creative at- 
mosphere." The city of Lowell is a bit removed from the bustle of 
Boston but still near enough to tap into the intelligence pool that 
flourishes throughout the collection of colleges and universities in the 
vicinity. 

The challenge presented to Rodriguez was considerable — essentially, 
he was starting up a whole new software company with aspirations to 
become influential on every front of computer applications. Working 
from the basis of the original company's game offerings, Rodriguez ex- 
panded the product line to include professional, educational, business, 
and technical programs. That meant, for all practical purposes, forming 
a total of five companies to compete in an already hotly contested 
marketplace and making what Rodriguez terms "a breathtaking invest- 
ment on the part of Hayden." Fortunately he did not come to this arena 
unprepared; he already held degrees in math and physics from the 
University of Texas, and an MBA from Harvard. Rodriguez's expertise 
in the field of computer science and his interest in artificial intelligence 
matters led to work as a consultant to Digital Equipment Corporation, 
and later he helped to found American Business Systems, which special- 
izes in accounting software. 

Rodriguez sums up his psyche and enthusiasm best with a revelation 
of his boyhood dreams. "You know, I always wished I had grown up in 
King Arthur's time — I would have looked great in armor. But now I 
realize that this is the perfect point in history, both exciting and fun. For 
me, this is Camelot." 

Hayden Software's modus operandi reflects the transition of this in- 
dustry from small companies funded from the dedicated pockets of com- 
puter buffs to a world of wealthy publicly held corporations. A staff of 
fifty operates the Lowell facility, but a great many of the research and 
development duties are carried out by "captive groups" — outside pro- 
gram suppliers who are working for an essentially guaranteed income on 
Hayden projects. Together with the in-house R&D and on-call authors, 
the company can produce enough software to keep a considerable sales 
staff on its toes. And much of that work is directed toward the hardware 



produced by Apple. As Rodriguez puts it, "We have a list of five players 
who we feel certain will survive in this business, and Apple is definitely 
on it. We are what we are today because of Apple, so we feel a special, 
close relationship with them. They cleared the path for us." 

Under Pressure. The pressure of competition from the outside hard- 
ly rattles Hayden's president; really, it's what inspires him most. It even 
applies to the company's promotions— things like the $5,000 Kamikaze 
game contest held this year or the new dealer incentive program that 
could net a BMW automobile for workers who excel. In nonworking 
hours, Rodriguez's competitive urge is directed toward the game of 
squash, and there's a standing invitation for a round with every Hayden 
employee. "I think anyone would find it therapeutic to beat the boss at 
times," Rodriguez allows, but among the staffers it's hard to turn up 
anyone who has. His entirely infectious enthusiasm goes full throttle 
when the subject turns to the future of microcomputing, though, and the 
excitement is unmistakably genuine. 

"Most important, computers will have to learn to deal with people. 
Anyone who thinks it is the people who must adapt is missing the boat. 
Delivery systems will expand to include telephone and satellite broad- 
cast, and the 1985 marketplace is going past computers as tools to com- 
puters as decision-making partners, presenting alternative scenarios, not 
just performing calculator or data storage functions. 

"Games will be moving into participatory fiction. We've already 
progressed from the simple maze game to the logical chess scheme, and 
with videodiscs the player can be an interactive participant — in effect, 
becoming a character in a story. The technology is close by. It might be 
too slow or too costly today, but that's only a temporary obstacle." To 
that end Hayden is actively recruiting expertise in the field of artificial 
intelligence and computer simulation, either to hire or to finance as a 
captive resource. 

The wide range of Hayden's products and the enormous number of 
competitors make it especially appropriate that the company's head of 
marketing, Bruce Twickler, comes from the heady battleground of con- 
sumer electronics. Trekking back east from his former position at 
Pioneer Electronics, Twickler is all too aware of the consumer point of 
view and the fact that it often conflicts with that of some narrow-minded 
software producers. 

"Our fundamental difference is our belief that the concept of user- 
friendly does not mean the user's willingness to tolerate complex pro- 
cedures. We strive to make it easy for the user and to present the highest 
level of value." 

Twickler's out-of-the-mainstream views are especially useful in an 
industry populated by so many enthusiasts that they often cannot see 
what the consumer needs, only what they can make the micro do. "We 
see no end to the technical development for at last five years, but we 
must direct our work toward utility. Better program performance is in 
reach with the newest machines, but does no good if people don't need it 
and won't pay for it. " Suffice it to say that Bruce Twickler tries to keep 
Hayden pointed at what the market yearns for, rather than at the slickest

tricks that the program writers can dream up. 

The Eyes Has It. David Eyes, Hayden's director of technical prod- 
ucts, is a little past the point of being a prodigy, but he's the youngest 
visible member of the management team. Actually he's the company's 
most senior employee, dating back to its New Jersey origins, and his 
considerable mastery of the subject matter belies his limited formal 
training. 

Dropping out of his college computer science course after two weeks. 
Eyes did not get infected with the computer virus until his mother bought 
an Apple four years ago. Already settled in the New York book- 
publishing world. Eyes began commuting to his mother's Apple on 
weekends, and his fascination with the device led him to apply it to his 
full-time vocation. 

Perhaps because of his thorough technical understanding of them, 
Eyes is overwhelmingly sold on the superiority of Hayden products, pa- 
tiently explaining their virtues to the most computer-shy listener. No 
doubt his New York University degree in English literature helps his 
communication abilities, even if most of his conversations are held with 
an Apple. 

Eyes's biggest new project is a sixteen-bit processor for the Apple. In 
fact. Eyes is supervising the development of software for the processor, 
which is being developed by Bill Mensch of the Western Design Center 
in Mesa, Arizona. 

Western Design Center recently released the 65C02, the first 
6502-compatible processor to use CMOS technology. The 65C02 ex- 
panded the 6502 instruction set and added a few new addressing modes 
to the old set. The new chip is the 65816, which, together with the soft- 
ware being developed by Hayden, will bring enough power to the Apple 
n to give the IBM pc a serious run for its money, according to Eyes. 

Sixteen bits refers to the amount of data that can be shuffled around in 
a single operation (that is, one machine language instruction). A sixteen- 
bit number is the equivalent of an integer from 0 to 65,535. By com- 
parison, the 6502 can handle only eight bits in a single operation. Eight 
bits is the equivalent of an integer from 0 to 255. In order to handle 
larger numbers, the 6502 has to do things one byte at a time. 

Stated simply, a one-instruction task on the 65816 would require two 
or more instructions to perform on the 6502. This means that, although 
the instruction set and addressing conventions will be the same on the 
65816 as they are on the 6502, the sixteen-bit chip will be easier to pro- 
gram and will perform equivalent tasks more quickly. 

The 65816 will actually go far beyond that. It is capable of dealing 
with twenty-four bit addresses through either a bank-register scheme or 
actual three-byte addresses. This translates into direct access of sixteen 
megabytes of memory, or 256 times the addressable storage of a 6502, 
and hence, of your Apple. Unfortunately, this feature renders the 65816 
incompatible with the Apple and any other existing 6502 machine. 

In Like Flint. Enter the 65802, with everything the 65816 has except 
the sixteen-megabyte capability. The 65802 can replace the 6502 in a 
standard Apple n. When initially powered up, an Apple with this chip in- 
stalled will act like an Apple with a 6502; all the old software will still 
run. However, there's an unused bit in the 6502 processor status 
register, and there are several unused op-codes in its instruction reper- 
toire. With the 65802, the previously unused bit is used to indicate 
sixteen-bit status. So any current instruction affecting the accumulator or 
either of the index registers can be made to handle sixteen bits of data at 
a time instead of just eight. In addition, several new instructions and ad- 
dressing modes will be avaUable. Among the most exciting of these is a 
single instruction to move an entire range of memory from one location 
to another. 

Assembly language programmers will recognize the wide range of 
opportunities this chip opens up. What it means for the typical Apple 
user won't be clear, however, until there's software on the market to take 
advantage of the power of the new chip. 

This is where Hayden and Eyes come in. Hayden's assembler, 
ORCA/M, is being revamped to generate code for the 65802. Starting 
early next year, it will begin to run under Apple's ProDOS as part of a 
new package called ORCA (Object Relocatable Code Assembler) HOST 
(Hayden Operating System Tools). //05r provides an MS-DOS-like 
command level for ProDOS and a set of tools to be used in software 
development. 

The HOST tools will include a ftill text editor, code generators, disk 
utilities that act like an extended Fid, a symbolic code debugger, and 



other utilities. Hayden plans to use the text editor from PIE Writer as the 
HOST editor; as HOST will eventually play host to new versions of 
Pascal and Basic, in addition to the ORCA/M assembler, this will be the 
first time Apple programmers will be able to use the same editor that 
they use for word processing for a variety of programming languages. A 
text formatting and printing program to complete the word processing 
package will be available as a separate item. 

Talking Heads. Throughout the company, the various departments 
are headed by involved individuals charged with a personal mission. One 
such individual is Gail Rothenberg, director of the home software 
group, which covers the games and educational programs. Another is 
marketing communications manager Scott Marshall. 

"Hayden aims to provide substantive learning in our educational 
software— not simply play, but challenges to memory and intelligence," 
says Marshall. The same goes for the games division. We intend to pro- 
vide more cerebral products, with strategy as the cornerstone." 

Hayden's commercial products group manager, Bill Overholt, is 
responsible for the direction of business and professional software. 
Overholt is dedicated to supplying consumers with what they need with- 
out requiring that they buy capabilities they have little use for. To get Bill 
Overholt excited, you'll have to start talking low-priced, high-function 
productivity tools for the casual user— in other words, sensible software 
applicable to the average home micro user who has no desire for a cor- 
porate accounting system. 

While it would seem that there are already enough accounting pro- 
grams to cover anyone's needs, Hayden has gone in the other direction, 
simplifying rather than complicating. Bringing accounting and marketing 
experience with him, business products manager Bruce Lustig did an in- 
ternship at Wang before landing at Hayden. "We're after first-time 
users, giving them a sophisticated but flexible system that mimics the 
simplest manual accounting methods," says Lustig. That also includes 
the development of industry-specific systems, tailored precisely to the 
needs of the business owner without the excess complications found in 
general accounting programs. 

Professional software product manager Dick Leonard is typical of 
Hayden Software's atypical management team. A man who'd be just as 
comfortable as the corporate pilot or ski instructor, Leonard, a biologist 
by training, is charged with the responsibility of eliminating every bit of 
inefficiency from the company's products before they go out the door. 
The time-is-money axiom really hits home for this man — eighteen dollars 
an hour for simulator flight time at the airport versus a one-time cost of 
thirty-four dollars for a simulator program is one juicy example of how 
today's microcomputer revolution can come home to people no matter 
what their avocations. 

Pie Talker. Soft-spoken to the point of sometimes being hard to hear, 
Rodriguez is nonetheless confident of his mastery of the turf. Clearly 
recalling the beginnings of the software business as a cottage industry, 
Rodriguez believes that things are very different today. "We're getting 
more like the record industry. Marketing and merchandising capital re- 
quirements are high, so it's no longer so easy for newcomers to break in. 
Most of the other companies are single-product-based, but Hayden has 
the edge in being broad-based." As company president, and now a step 
removed from the hands-on involvement of his earlier ventures, 
Rodriguez sees Hayden's future closely tied to building consumer 
awareness. 

"A recognizable brand identity, fostered by advertising, packaging, 
and promotions, will be vital for survival as consolidation hits the soft- 
ware world and the less prepared companies disappear," he says. "In 
the late 1970s, there was a large, friendly fraternity of program writers, 
but today the stakes are much higher. No longer is it good enough simply 
to have one good product." 

From the president's desk, Rodriguez sees that perhaps twenty com- 
panies account for 95 percent of the market, and that field will narrow as 
user profiles mature from enthusiasts to everyday folks who need the 
utility a computer offers. 

The principals of Hayden Software are as aware as any astute 
observer that, although market penetration of computers will continue to 
grow, the number of sources for both hardware and software will 
diminish as the boom reaches a point of saturation. Hayden's broad base 
of attack, on every front, ought to go a long way toward making the com- 
pany what marketing communications manager Scott Marshall calls ' 'the 
Sears of software. "

Mind Your 




BY PETER OLIYIEW 




Here it is December— holiday time and time to consider what gifts to 
get for your friends, your loved ones, your Apple, and yourself. There 
are lots of goodies for the Apple that make good presents. Can you think 
of items you'd like to buy as Christmas gifts? If so, don't just put them on 
your shopping list and forget about them; order them today. 

If you're like most people, items you put on a list too often stay on 
that list or wind up on some other, more elaborate list. Some people even 
have lists that refer to other lists. To put things in a computer context, 
you might say that these people have trouble managing their data. That's 
what this month's column is all about— managing data. We first dis- 
cussed database management systems some time ago. Enough has 
changed since then, however, to warrant additional coverage. 

Stick with Lists. Why not just stick with lists, you ask? Why bother 
involving the computer? Well, if you have a list of moderate size, the 
computer can do a lot better job of managing the data than can any 
human being. And if some of your lists refer to other lists, and those lists 
to still others, keeping track of the available information from various 
lists becomes an almost impossible task without computer assistance. 
(Actually, lists is probably not the right term here. We should actually be 
talking about files, since most of our data needs can take this form.) 

Most organizations need information, not just data. Data is simply 
some grouping of letters and numbers stored together in some form. 
Once some action designed to affect the data is taken— once it has been 
organized, sorted, summarized, classified, and/or manipulated— data 
becomes information. And it is information that drives most businesses. 
Managers rely on it to contact customers, prepare financial reports, 
forecast the business environment, keep track of inventory, and much 
more. Thus, there are two concepts to consider when dealing with data: 
how to record it, and how to process it so that it becomes information. 

In most organizations, raw data is kept in file cabinets. One cabinet 
may hold personnel records, another may contain detailed information 
about customers, a third might hold financial data, and a fourth might 
contain information about the products in inventory. This collective set 
of file cabinets could be called a database. In fact, such a collection of 
data could rightfully have been called a database long before computers 
came along. Yet it is only since the arrival of computers that many of the 
terms we'll discuss here have come into common use. 

Say we have a database for a hypothetical company. Our database 
contains files of personnel records, customer and financial data, and in- 
formation about the products in inventory. If you were to open a file, 
such as the customer file, and withdraw one of the file folders, you'd be 
accessing one of the records in that file. A record contains all the infor- 
mation about one member of the file. Looking at the record more close- 
ly, you might notice the professional title of the individual whose record 
you were examining. That item (the job title) would be called a field. 

These terms — database, file, record, and field— are used in reference 
to database programs that have been developed for computer users. Such 
programs constitute database management systems (often abbreviated 
DBMS). 

General Expectations. A database management system is a collec- 
tion of programs designed to allow computer users to manage their data. 
Usually, the fact that a DBMS is a collection of programs, rather than a 
single program, is transparent to users— that is, it seems to most that the 
package is a single program capable of performing all necessary tasks. 

As we touched on last time, there are certain capabilities a database 
management system must have if it is to be worthy of the name. 

1 . The system must provide a way of creating a database: A file must 
be designed and named, disk space must be prepared, and initial data 
must be entered. 

2. There must be a provision for adding new members (records) to 
the database at any time. (After all, our business will probably get some 



new customers after the original database has been created.) Similarly, 
the system must provide a way to delete records from the database. 

3. Since there will always be changes, it must be possible to change 
any item in a file. Any field might, at some time or another, be a can- 
didate for change. 

4. Since data is of little use until it is recalled, the system must pro- 
vide the user with a variety of ways to search through the database look- 
ing for particular records. As the sophistication of a database increases, 
so does the variety of ways in which data can be retrieved. 

5. For data to become meaningful information, it must usually be 
manipulated and formatted into a report. Thus, we would expect a 
database management system to provide us with the ability to generate a 
variety of user-defined reports. 

6. Maintaining only the original database is a very risky business. A 
database management system must therefore provide some means of 
making copies of all the files being used. Many systems have a copy 
facility allowing the user to make a backup copy of the database at 
any time. 

In summary, a database management system should be able to create, 
add, delete, update, search, report, and copy. 

More Data for Your Mental Database. The preceding discussion 
should give you a pretty good idea of what a database is and what general 
features it should have. However, several other terms you might en- 
counter in your travels around Databaseland are worthy of mention. 

A file management system can be distinguished from a database 
management system in that the former simply contains independent 
records that relate neither to one another nor to those in any other file. A 
list of customers' names and addresses might be considered an example 
of a file management system. A database management system, by con- 
trast, manipulates files; thus, data in one file of a DBMS may point to or 
relate to data in another file. 

The database in a database management system may be one of (or 
some combination of) three basic types. 

A hierarchical database is structured much like a topical outline; it 
has various levels of data. For example, a hierarchical database for a 
company might divide that company into departments. The department 
files might in turn contain another level of information on the products 
manufactured by each department. 

A network database offers some flexibility not available in the hierar- 
chical design. In this system, additional "pointers" are inserted that 
create additional relationships between data items. Search criteria can 
then go beyond the limited boundaries provided by the hierarchical de- 
sign, allowing the user to establish linkages of interest. To illustrate the 
kind of flexibility a network database makes available, let's return to our 
earlier example using departments and products. Instead of searching 
one department at a time for a particular product (say, paper clips), with 
a network database you could search through all departments for all such 
occurrences. 

A relational database essentially organizes the relationships in a 
database into tabular form— that is, into rows and columns. This arrange- 
ment allows users to define literally any relationship that might interest 
them. From their standpoint, such a collection of files resembles one 
great big file. 

One other term you might come across when learning about database 
management systems is record key (or keys). The key is the most direct 
way of looking up data in a database when a search request has been in- 
itiated. For example, in a customer file the key might be the field con- 
taining the client's last name. There can be primary keys and secondary 
keys, but searching always goes faster when primary keys are used. 

While the terms we've been discussing are no doubt terms you'll en- 
counter at some time or other, they are not as important in the choosing

of a database management system as they might seem. If the system 
you're interested in does what you want it to, then it's the right system 
for you. 

Homework Time. No one knows your business as well as you do. 
The best way to ensure that you consider only software packages that are 
appropriate for your purposes is by doing some homework. This in- 
volves using your imagination, making various lists, and estimating your 
data storage needs. 

To begin, start at the end. Although it may seem odd, beginning by 
thinking about the design of all the reports you'd like your database to 
generate is one of the best ways to ensure that the DBMS you wind up 
with will suit your needs. Pretend that your database already exists and 
that you are sitting at your desk looking over the final batch of reports. 
What do they look like? What are the report titles? What are the column 
titles in each report? What data (information) does each contain? Are 
there subtotals? Totals? Are some columns derived arithmetically by 
manipulating others? 

Take your time here; this is a very important step. If you do a thor- 
ough job of imagining at this stage, it will not only be easier to select 
a software package, but it will be a good deal easier to design and imple- 
ment the system once you have it. 

Next, make a list of all the data items (fields) necessary to create the 
reports you wish to generate. Identify which fields are calculated and 
which are independent, original items. (You might wish to verify at this 
time that all the fields you've identified represent data that can actually 
be collected; sometimes the reports that are part of a wish list request 
data that simply isn't available.) 

Once you've identified all the data items to be included, look through 
your list for any redundant entries (some data may be used in several 
reports). Try to group all the data in a logical way; the idea is to identify 
individual files. It may help to keep in mind the file cabinet analogy used 
earlier. 

When you've finished organizing the data, you will have the skeleton 
of your database system: files, records, and fields. From here you can 
begin to estimate your data storage needs. How much data a particular 
system is capable of storing may be a significant factor in your choice. 
Do you need a hard disk? This is important to know, for several reasons. 
For one thing, some database management systems won't work with a 
hard disk. But if you have a lot of data to work with, you may find that 
using several floppy disks is somewhat unwieldy. The fact that data re- 
trieval speed is dependent to some extent on the device on which it is 
stored is also relevant here. 

To assess your data storage needs, first determine how many fields 
are in one record of one of your files. Next, count the number of 
characters in each field to calculate the total number of characters in one 
record. Multiply this number by the number of records your database is 
likely to contain. Don't forget to allow room for growth; if you're un- 
sure, it's better to overestimate than to underestimate. 

Now go through this same process for each of the files you'll be 
needing. When you've finished, add up all the totals. This will give you 
an estimate of the total amount of storage your system will have to have. 
As a rule of thumb, consider that a typical floppy disk stores less than 
one hundred fifty thousand characters, while a typical hard disk may 
store approximately five million characters. 

Armed with this information, you'll be in a much better position to 
match particular products with your needs. 

What To Look For. Obviously, the first step is to find a system that 
can meet the data storage needs you've just identified. If your application 
requires enough data to warrant a hard disk, you won't want to spend 
much time examining database management systems that can't accom- 
modate one. In addition to data storage capacity, various other capa- 
bilities may be important, essential, or just nice to have, depending 
on your application. 

1 . Mathematical manipulation. Does the system allow you to ma- 
nipulate your data arithmetically? Is it easy to get subtotals and totals? 
Does the system accommodate "derived" columns (arrived at by work- 
ing with one or more columns of data)? How easy is it to use the 
arithmetic functions? 

2. File size limitations. How much data can be stored in a file? How 
many fields can be contained in a single record? Are there any limitations 
on the number of records? 

3. The data input process. Can you design your own data collection 



ThinkTank 



TM 



Si 



IS NEW AND UNIQUE. 
IT IS VERY USEFUL. 
YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IT. 
READ THIS CAREFULLY. 

WHAT THE PROGRAM IS 

ThinkTank is an 'idea processor' for your Apple personal computer, an out- 
line editor with powerful features. It allows you to deal with the thoughts in 
your mind by providing a simple, versatile way of outlining, arranging and 
modifying text. Integrated into ThinkTank is a powerful, easy to use word 
processor. 

HOW ThinkTank WORKS 

You enter topics in 'headline' form — and then indent headlines under each 
other to create an outline format. With single keystrokes you change your 
outline to reflect new thoughts. You can put a page of text under your 
headline — when you move the headline the text goes with it. 

You can sort alphabetically, or search for key words or phrases. You can 
'expand' to reveal hidden detail or 'collapse' any part on the screen to 
see the big picture. You can edit and print it out. 

WHO CAN USE IT 

Virtually anyone with a personal computer needs ThinkTank. It is being used 
for project management, organizing, writing anything, notetaking, bibliog- 
raphies, lesson planning, scripting, action lists, and brainstorming. It can be 
your file cabinet, bulletin board, administrative assistant. Anyone who uses 
his mind to get through life will find ThinkTank an extremely valuable tool. 

USERS AND REVIEWERS LOVE IT 

The New lk>rk Times: "ThinkTank is so easy to use, and so relatively error 
proof that even a first-timer feels as if he's in charge of the computer, instead 
of the other way around. And being in charge of the computer is what en- 
ables you to do with it things you may never have thought of doing before." 

InfoWorld: "Your screen becomes a dynamic arena for your ideas," and "an 
amazing tool that emphasizes the power of the microcomputer." 

One customer wrote: "I use ThinkTank for more purposes than I have any 
other program in the five years I've owned a computer."

instrument on-screen so that the entry of data is a relatively simple task? 
The ability to customize a database application program to your own 
specific needs is a big plus. If your system allows you to create such data 
collection forms, you'll be able to make your system much easier for 
others to use. 

4. Printed reports. In the end, the reports a system generates are of 
great importance to you. They'll provide the information that motivated 
you to get organized in the first place. The more flexible and powerful a 
system's report generation capabilities, the better that system is likely to 
be. Can you design the formats of the reports yourself? Can data be 
placed anywhere on the page? Will it handle special forms in addition to 
standard and wide paper? 

5. Sorting. Very few reports are useful until the data they contain has 
been arranged in some meaningful way. Does the package you're con- 
sidering allow for the sorting of data? Sometimes you'll need an addi- 
tional disk drive in order to do this; sometimes you'll need more main 
memory, and sometimes the ability to sort data is just not available. 
Another relevant question: Does the system allow you to do multiple- 
level sorts? For example, if you have a report that has department names 
in column one and the names of employees in coluinn two, can you print 
a report that's alphabetized by department and, within departments, by 
employee? Finally, sorting takes time. How long it takes to sort the size 
of the files you plan to use may be an important consideration. 

6. Retrieval speed. The time it takes the system to find and display 
(or print out) a particular item is called the retrieval speed. If your ap- 
plication requires rapid access to data, this is a critical concern. Speed is 
the real problem with most microcomputer database management 
systems, and you may find that the only way to get the speed you need is 
to go to a system that can accommodate a hard disk. 

7. Multiple users. If you're part of an organization in which several 
people need to use the same database, you'll want to know whether the 
system you're considering allows for several stations to be coimected so 
that each user can access the data whenever necessary. This setup is 
more difficult to arrange than it might at first appear, because in order 
for a system to accommodate multiple users, special file-handling 
characteristics must be built into it. The list of available software for the 
system will also narrow considerably. 

8. Documentation. If you (a) can't read the manual, (b) need a Ph.D. 
to get through it, or (c) are told that the system is so easy to use that it 
doesn't need a manual, watch out! Look through the instruction manual 
accompanying any system you're seriously considering. Judge the 
system by the quality of the documentation that comes with it. 

9. Relationship to a mainframe. If you wish to use your microcom- 
puter database management system to manipulate data contained in a 
company database on a mainframe, you'll need to take a variety of 
elements into account. You'll need a modem to dial in to the host com- 
puter. You'll also need to ascertain whether the host computer will 
recognize the machine you're dialing in on. The DBMS package you 
have will have to accommodate downloading, which is the process of 
transferring all or part of the host computer's file to your particular 
system. This is not a common feature at present but is certain to be- 
come one. 

10. Backup. At the risk of belaboring the point, it bears repeating 
that one of the most important characteristics of a system is the provision 
it makes for backing up files. Be sure you understand what's in- 
volved in the backup process before you purchase a system. 

By all means, arrange with your dealer to try out the systems that in- 
terest you before you buy. Prepare and bring along a sample of twenty- 
five records from one of your files (more if you think it would help you 
determine the appropriateness of a particular system). Enter the data, try 
out some searches, and make comparisons. Make a note of how long it 
takes to retrieve a record and how long the sorts take. 

Over the next two months, we'll look at some of the database 
management packages currently available and evaluate them in terms of 
the criteria we've established this time. There will be some old friends, 
some familiar faces with revisions, and some newcomers. Among the 
packages we'll look at are the new version of DB Master, the PFS series, 
FlowerSoft's Data Bank, Quick File He, and some Apple III database 
management systems, to name a few. We'll also take a look at some in- 
tegrated packages. 

Until then, why not prepare by doing some serious thinking about 
your own database management needs? Hi

The Schoolhouse Apple 

by Jock Root 




Assuming that we all agree that the computer is potentially a powerful 
teaching tool, somehow it doesn't seem to be living up to its potential. 
There's getting to be quite a lot of good software around, but most of it 
is simply an enhancement of things we could already do. Where is the 
"revolution in teaching techniques" we were promised? 

Perhaps it's still ahead of us. After all, the computer is a very new 
tool, in the classroom as everywhere else, and we're still learning how to 
think about it. Let's take a look at what we've done so far and see if it 
suggests any new directions. 

One of the most exciting things computers have given us is the self- 
motivating drill program — a series of problems in arithmetic, grammar, 
or something equally boring offered in the format of an arcade game. 
The old pack of flash cards, which used to be a punishment, has become 
a game of skill and is now used as a reward. 

This mixture of teaching and entertainment makes some educators 
uncomfortable. They feel that with too much emphasis on entertainment, 
teaching is likely to suffer. Certainly, learning requires both effort and 
discipline— no "magic software" is going to change that. 

Teaching versus Learning. Maybe we're looking at the problem the 
wrong way. We know that most kids dislike "schoolwork," but also that 
any kid loves a new toy. There is a paradox here — namely, that from the 
kid's viewpoint, schoolwork has very little to do with learning. 

Every time you buy a new program for your Apple, you are faced 
with a "learning threshold"; you have to learn how to control the pro- 
gram before you can get any use out of it. This is true for any kind of 
program, from Txixxon and Wizardry to WordStar and VisiCalc. In fact, 
if you're a wise buyer of software, you give some thought to this before 
you pay for a program: "How difficult will it be for me to learn?" 

The same goes for any new toy, be it a stereo, a sewing machine, or 
a sports car. You have to learn how to use it before you can have any fun 
with it. And because you know this before you buy, you're probably 
looking forward to the prospect of getting acquainted with your new toy. 
You're looking forward, in other words, to a reasonably difficult learn- 
ing experience — and you can hardly wait! 

On this level, kids are just as smart as you are. They know perfectly 
well, if they stop to think about it, that they will have to learn to use 
whatever it is they want, but does that stop them from asking for it? 
No way. 

Children have no objection to learning as such; what they resent is 
having to learn stuff that seems to them to be meaningless nonsense- 
information they have no immediate use for. While it may seem silly to a 
teacher to invest time (and quarters) in learning to chop up a caterpillar 
or fly a spaceship in a video game, to a child it seems just as silly to 
spend time learning how to divide by seven, or memorizing the date Col- 
umbus sailed for America. 

If you want to see serious learning, watch a child who wants to get on 
a team— any team. She will exercise like you wouldn't have thought 
possible, change her eating and sleeping habits, and practice, practice, 
practice. All of this, you understand, for the privilege of playing a game. 

Clearly, a child can be motivated to learn by himself. In fact, children 
love to learn, need to learn, and cannot stop learning. In a sense, learning 
is the whole purpose of childhood. The question is, can we use the com- 
puter to help shape this drive? Or, more precisely, how can we use the 
power of the computer to motivate children to learn what we think they 
need to know? 

Game Behavior. We all know how video games can fascinate a 
person— child or adult, it makes no difference. And the effect is not con- 
fined to fast and highly visual arcade games; there are some pretty hyp- 



notic programs of the "slow and deep" variety as well (Wizardry, 
Sargon, the Zorks, and various other strategy games). These games re- 
quire a good deal of learning to play at all — and a whole lot of learning 
(plus experience, or practice) to play well. There is strong motivation 
here, but how can we apply it to learning French, or algebra? 

What does a game program do? For one thing, it offers you a trip to 
another world— an alternate reality, with its own rules and purposes. An 
imaginary world, but who cares? Thanks to the principle of cause and ef- 
fect, you can manipulate that whole world through your keyboard. What 
more could you ask? 

In this imaginary world, the game program offers you challenges. 
You have to master physical techniques (hitting the right key at the right 
time or moving the joystick in precisely the right pattern) and mental 
techniques (solving puzzles, anticipating dangers, managing resources). 
You have to learn a whole lot of new behavior, and learn it well, before 
you can even begin to win anything. And most games have several levels 
of difficulty, each requiring more learning than the last. 

Alas, once you have learned the game well enough to win at it fairly 
consistently, you've probably spoiled it for yourself by getting so good at 
it. The behavior patterns you have learned in order to win are probably 
not useful outside of the game, unless, of course, the program is Sargon 
(a chess program). In that case, you could use it to practice for the

Masters' Tournament, but then it wouldn't be a game program at all; for 
your purposes, it would be a teaching program. 

How To Use the Computer. Let's take another look at that. A chess- 
playing program is a game if you just like to play chess with your Apple. 
But if you're sharpening your skills to play against other people, then 
the program is regarded as drill-and-practice courseware. In other 
words, the factor that ultimately discriminates between "game" and 
"courseware" is purpose. If you're running the program because you 
like it, it's a game; but if you're running it because you need the skill, it's 
a teaching program. 

And that could be the answer we're looking for, or at least a pointer 
toward it. The computer might bring a revolution in teaching techniques 
by turning the school experience into a series of carefully designed 
games. These games would have the same challenge and excitement as 
today's entertainment games, but as you played one of them you would 
also be shown the principles of, say, algebra, which is the "magic 
language" in the world of this particular game. In order to win the game, 
you would have to learn those principles and use them correctly in your 
"spells." Winning the game would depend on mastering the subject. 

If that's what the "revolution" is going to be, what can we do to 
hurry it along? If you're into writing software, the answer is obvious — 
but suppose you're a software user? If the software you want isn't writ- 
ten yet, you can't very well start using it. 

In fact, though, you can't be sure it isn't written yet. All you know is 
that it isn't in the courseware catalogs— but have you tried the game soft- 
ware? For example, if you teach history, look at the strategy games. 
There are probably at least two or three games based on your favorite 
war, maybe even one based on your favorite battle. Some strategy games 
might be more appropriate to economics — they involve management of 
resources, development of weak economies, and the like. If you're look- 
ing for a way to demonstrate some event or situation to your students (or 
your children), try to find a computer game based on it. If you can find a 



reasonably accurate model in game form, it will probably teach them 
more successfully than any other tool you could provide. 

SpecialWare. We recently received a new kind of courseware 
catalog, the first major catalog we have seen that focuses specifically on 
courseware for the handicapped. It's called The SpecialWare Directory, 
from Line Associates. 

The main body of the catalog is an alphabetical listing, by publisher, 
of over two hundred educational programs. Those programs that are 
suitable for special education use are marked with an asterisk, and a few 
programs have two asterisks, meaning that they were specifically de- 
signed for special education. Both teaching and evaluation programs are 
included. 

One-third of the catalog is a set of cross-indexes: by handicap or 
special audience, by computer (Apple, Atari, Commodore, IBM pc, 
TRS-80, and others), by curriculum or subject, by educational level, by 
instructional approach, and other classifications. These listings could be 
useful to a teacher in any field, not just special education. 

The program descriptions given are based on manufacturers' infor- 
mation, and no attempt has been made to evaluate programs. The preface 
to the catalog advises you to "consult colleagues or professional review 
sources to obtain evaluative information." 

The catalog suffers from a few data-handling problems. Some of the 
programs don't appear in every cross-reference list, and programs are 
not always on the exact pages they're supposed to be, but you can usually 
find what you're looking for without difficulty. The convenience of hav- 
ing these listings in any form far outweighs the occasional lapses. The 
catalog also includes a user feedback form; the implication is that they're 
trying as hard as they can and will probably get rid of these minor bugs 
by the next edition. It costs $13.95.

LOGO 

DOnriA BEARDEn 

There was something about the way the shapes went together that had 
a look of a wreath with poinsettias. Someone else suggested a stained 
glass window; so off we go on another adventure of study, experimenta- 
tion, learning, and playing. 

What you can learn about stained glass windows and the geometry in- 
volved in creating the Rose masterpieces dating as far back as the twelfth 
century is awesome. It would take from now until next Christmas to 
transfer some of the more complex basic designs into Logo procedures. 
For this year's Christmas greeting, you'll have to settle for some fairly 
simple combinations of shapes and colors that give only a hint of what's 
possible. So Merry Christmas! Enjoy! And come back next year! 

Patterns and color can be very exciting to work with in Logo. Each of 
these designs was colored on and off the computer. Various pen colors 
were tried within the procedures and then the designs were printed and 
colored in a variety of ways, emphasizing a variety of shapes. 

Many of the famous Rose windows are divided by twelve spokes ra- 
diating from the center. Thus the first design evolved from a twelve-pet- 
aled flower.

CIRCLE was defined as: 

TO CIR :N 

REPEAT 36 [FD :N RT 10] 
END 

Various circles were tried and CIR 2 seemed to be a good size to start 
with. To divide the circle into twelve segments, divide 36 by 12. 
Therefore, each segment or arc can be drawn with: 

TO ARC 

REPEATS [FD 2 RT 10] 
END 

SPOKE was defined with a variable to make it easy to try different 
sizes of spokes: 



RAYS was defined to draw the twelve spokes and the twelve arcs of 
the circle simultaneously: 

TO RAYS 

REPEAT 12 [SPOKE 30 ARC]

After much experimenting, POINTS were added: 

TO POINTS 

LT 90 FD 30 RT 45 

REPEAT 12 [FD 21 RT 120 FD 21 LT 90] 
END 

To add the second ring of spokes, the turtle was positioned and sever- 
al different sizes of circles were tried. CIR II was chosen and RAYS I 
was defined. Once you figure out the size of the circle you need, it's not 
necessary to draw the circle first. You can combine it with drawing the 
spokes as we did earlier.

Another circle was added around the outside. It takes some experi- 
menting with various positions and sizes of circles to find the correct 
one. So don't be afraid to try several. Think of your screen as a scratch 
pad. Then when you find something you're pleased with, put it in a pro- 
cedure.

try changing the background color. Then, if you have a printer, dump the

Christmas cards.

WREATH began as an exercise in combining regular polygons. With 
the exception of the trapezoid, every side of every polygon in the design 
is the same length. The long side of the trapezoid is twice as long as the 
other sides.

First, put six triangles together to form a hexagon. Add squares at 
each side of the hexagons. Use diamonds to fill in the spaces between the 
squares. Then add trapezoids at the outer sides of the squares and, finally, 
pairs of "skinny" diamonds to complete the design. 

To add each new ring of shapes, two moves need to be figured out: 
one to move the turtle into the correct position to draw the first shape in 
the ring and the second to move the turtle from shape to shape within the

Have you experimented with filling shapes in with color? This is a 
beautiful design to try it on. Since Logo doesn't have a fill command, 
we'll have to define one. Let's start with the triangle. If we have the tur- 
tle draw progressively smaller triangles, we'll end up with a triangle 
filled with color. Try this: 

TO FILL.TRI :N 
IF :N = 0 [STOP] 
REPEAT 3 [FD :N RT 120] 
FILL.TRI :N - 1 
END 

Define similar procedures for the square and the diamond:

FILL.DIA :N - 1 

END 

When you use shapes filled with color next to each other, some colors 
bleed. Experiment with different color combinations. In this design, the 
poinsettias were found to bleed into the diamonds if the diamonds were 
filled with color first. However, if the poinsettias were drawn first and 
then the diamonds were colored, there wasn't a problem. So BRUSH. UP 
was defined to go back and brush up the diamonds. 




Let's add a ring of poinsettias to the wreath! Instead of S.DIA- 
MONDS, add POINSETTLaiS.

the trickiest part of this design. You have to figure out how much to ro- 
tate the turtle and how to get him back into position to begin drawing 
STARS again. 

Some hints. The interior angle of the pentagon is 108 (180 - 72). If 
you rotate three pentagons, you'll have 36 degrees left over to complete 
the circle (3 x 108 = 324; 360 - 324 = 36). Therefore, to divide the 
space equally, we should allow 12 degrees between each pentagon. Since 
we need to rotate the turtle through one interior angle of a pentagon, 
through the 12-degree space between the pentagons, and then through 
one-third of the interior angle of the next pentagon (the point of the star 
divides the interior angle of the pentagon into thirds), the first rotation of 
the turtle should be RT 156. Then go FORWARD 30 and turn RT 36 
(one-third of the interior angle of the pentagon) and you'll be ready to 
draw the next STARS pattern.

THE Fy^scA|.mrH 

By Jim Merritt 



Jungle Fever, Part 10 



The end of yet another year also brings us to the end of our tutorial 
overview of Apple Pascal's UNIT facility. We covered the major issues 
in the October and November columns; this month, we'll conclude with 
glances at some of the subtler aspects of UNITs. Accordingly, the mate- 
rial presented below presumes that you are at least passingly familiar 
with the UNIT mechanism. If you missed one or both of our previous 
discussions, read carefully the relevant portions of Apple's Pascal 
manuals, specifically chapter 5 of the Apple Pascal Language Reference 
Manual, as well as chapter 7 and the "System Librarian" section of 
chapter 8 in the Apple Pascal Operating System Reference Manual. 

Choosing Your "Favorite Flavor." Suppose you make your living 
developing software for the mass market. In a frenzy of inspiration and 
activity, you create CEO (Chief Executive Officer), the world's most 
comprehensive, well-integrated business software system. You expect 
sales volume to reach into the millions, or at least the hundreds of thou- 
sands. At the core of CEO is a marvelous package of subroutines, which 
you have named WHIZUNIT. This UNIT is so handy that you plan to 
use it in several future software products. Given all this, should WHIZ- 
UNIT be a regular UNIT or an INTRINSIC one? This question was 
posed at the end of the column last month; finding an answer (no easy 
task!) naturally involves comparing the relative strengths and 
weaknesses of the two types of UNITs. 

Let's assume that you make a regular UNIT out of WHIZUNIT. This 
decision will probably cause you a great deal of inconvenience during the 
software development process, since every time you change either CEO 
or WHIZUNIT, you must invoke the Linker to merge the client and 
UNIT object code together into a single, executable code file. During 
product development, both CEO and WHIZUNIT are likely to change 
several times, and you must invoke the Linker after recompiling either 
entity. The selling price that you ask for CEO will have to be calculated 
to compensate you for enduring such inconvenience. Furthermore, the 
final CEO object code file — using only regular UNITs— will be complete 
and self-sufficient. To move CEO to a customer's computer system (or to 
make a backup copy), it will be necessary to transfer only one file. Instal- 
lation of CEO on the customer's system is thus as simple as it can get. 
Consequently, you will find it reasonably easy to document and support 
this aspect of the software! 

Now, suppose that you bring your other products— all dependent on 
WHIZUNIT— to market. Because WHIZUNIT is not INTRINSIC, the 
object code file for each program must include its own, separate copy of 
the UNIT. If your software system involves many programs and 
WHIZUNIT is very large, a great deal of disk space will be occupied by 
redundant copies of WHIZUNIT. As a result, you or your customer may 
find it impossible to put all the code files on a single Apple-format disk 
and still leave room for any system software files or data files that may 
be required for successful execution. Of course, it's in your best interests 
to ensure that all files relating to CEO can fit comfortably on one disk. 
Your production costs (not to mention your customer's potential confu- 
sion) are likely to rise with the number of disks included in the CEO 
package. 

What if you find a bug in WHIZUNIT at some future time? You must 
repair it, relink the UNIT to each and every client, and supply entirely 
new, improved versions of each client program to those of your custom- 
ers who decide to participate in your software update offer. 

Designating WHIZUNIT as INTRINSIC would alleviate several of 
the aforementioned difficulties, but it would cause others. On one hand, 
your task of product development might be eased somewhat, because no 
linking is necessary between INTRINSIC UNITs and their clients. If you 
change a client, you can execute the compiled object code directly; 



merging of client and INTRINSIC UNIT code is done automatically by 
the system at execution time. On the other hand, every time you change 
the INTRINSIC version of WHIZUNIT, you must reinstall it in the Sys- 
tem. Library, so the time you save by not having to link could be lost if 
WHIZUNIT changes more often than its clients during the software de- 
velopment cycle. 

The client of an INTRINSIC UNIT does not actually include any of 
the UNIT'S object code; one copy of the UNIT code— residing in the 
System. Library file— serves for all clients of that UNIT. Therefore, by 
making WHIZUNIT an INTRINSIC, you may be able to shrink the ob- 
ject files for CEO and other clients by a margin sufficient to allow all of 
them to fit easily onto a single disk, while still leaving room for data files 
and any necessary Pascal system code files. 

The installation of software that depends on INTRINSIC UNITs is 
rather tricky, for several reasons. First, no client of an INTRINSIC 
UNIT can execute unless the object code for that UNIT is available in 
System. Library at execution time. Thus, in order to use CEO, the cus- 
tomer must not only transfer the client code file to her system, but also 
install any appropriate UNITs in the library. We saw in November that it 
is not easy to construct a code library, partially because the process in- 
volves interaction with an esoteric utility program. Library. In general, 
library manipulation involving the Library utility should not be at- 
tempted by any but seasoned programmers. Certainly, your customers 
should not be responsible for merging WHIZUNIT into their own 
libraries. 

But suppose now that you take it upon yourself to write a program 
called Install that will do the job of the Library utility but in an automated 
fashion, without human intervention. Even if you learn everything there 
is to know about how code libraries are organized and how to duplicate 
the functions of the Library program, you will still encounter two major 
problems. Given the requirement that Install should never require pro- 
grarrmiing expertise on the part of its user, one of those important prob- 
lems is probably insoluble, while the other one is definitely so. 

Last month, we saw that every INTRINSIC UNIT declaration must 
include at least one (and sometimes two) explicit segment numbers (for 
CODE and DATA respectively). These numbers are permanently and ir- 
revocably associated with the INTRINSIC UNIT, unlike the variable, 
"dummy" segment numbers that are assigned by the compiler to regular 
UNITs. If an INTRINSIC UNIT is given the CODE segment number 25, 
it will always be associated with segment slot 25 at execution time. In 
contrast, a regular UNIT that is given segment number 25 when it is 
compiled may in fact be reassigned to segment 7 when it is finally linked 
to a client. 

The first of our tough problems hinges on the inflexibility of IN- 
TRINSIC UNIT segment numbering: What if another INTRINSIC 
UNIT in the customer's library has already been assigned to WHIZ- 
UNIT's segment number? For reasons that we won't go into here, no 
two INTRINSICs in the same library code file should ever bear the same 
segment number. Facing a conflict such as this, the Install program 
should probably give up and admit its failure to the user (perhaps also 
mentioning the name of the conflicting UNIT in its "swan song" error 
message). 

Your Pathfinder is unsure at the time of this writing whether it is pos- 
sible for a program to identify all references to a specific segment num- 
ber within an arbitrary sequence of Pascal object code. If it is possible. 
Install could sidestep the problem of conflicting segment numbers by 
assigning another, unused segment number to WHIZUNIT. After install- 
ing the altered UNIT code in System. Library, Install could proceed to al- 
ter all of WHIZUNIT 's clients so that they would use the new segment

numbers. Even if such a scheme is feasible, however, devising it would 
involve much head-scratching and laborious effort on your part— perhaps 
too much to be worth the trouble. 

The other problem (the truly insoluble one) entails dealing with a full 
library file. Like any code file, System. Library can accommodate only 
sixteen segment definitions because its segment dictionary has only six- 
teen "slots." In the standard Apple Pascal library, seven of these slots 
are occupied by Apple's own INTRINSIC UNITs, while nine are left va- 
cant. Nine is not a very big number. It isn't hard to imagine filling all the 
available slots with INTRINSIC UNITs belonging to only a few different 
applications software systems, especially if some of the UNITs declare 
both CODE and DATA segments. (The DATA segment of an INTRIN- 
SIC UNIT is actually little more than a "dummy." Still, it must occupy 
its own slot in the library segment dictionary.) 

Should the Install program find the library full when it tries to install 
WHIZUNIT, it would simply have to admit its failure to the user, and 
then quit. There is no recourse, short of removing one of the established 
UNITs from the library. The decision of which (if any) UNIT to remove 
should be left to a programmer. This, of course, violates our requirement 
that successful use of Install should not require any programming 
expertise. 

It seems that no matter how much effort and ingenuity we put into our 
hypothetical Install program, it is very unlikely that we can automate IN- 
TRINSIC UNIT installation in anything approaching a foolproof fash- 
ion. We must reluctantly conclude, therefore, that as convenient as IN- 
TRINSIC UNITs are for experienced programmers, they probably cause 
more trouble than they're worth when used in freely distributed produc- 
tion software. Despite any drawbacks we've mentioned, then, it would 
probably be better to implement WHIZUNIT as a regular UNIT. 

When 16 Equals 32. We mentioned previously that a code file's seg- 
ment dictionary has only sixteen "slots." This affects the number of 
segments and (regular) UNITs that may be employed by any particular 
program. Although a program may consist of any mixture of UNITs and 
SEGMENT subroutines, the sum of the total number of regular UNITs 
and the total number of segments (counting the main program as a seg- 



ment) may not exceed sixteen. In other words, a main program may call 
upon up to fifteen additional segments, where a segment is either a SEG- 
MENT subroutine or a regular UNIT. Thus, if your program uses five 
SEGMENT PROCEDURES, it may call upon up to ten regular UNITs. 
A program that does not contain any SEGMENT subroutines (other than 
its own main body) is free to use up to fifteen regular UNITs. 

We've mentioned in previous months that the run-time segment table 
is a sort of master dictionary maintained jointly by the p-machine simula- 
tor and Pascal operating system. It contains entries that describe all seg- 
ments that are part of the currently executing program. The segment ta- 
ble has room for thirty -two entries, and this means that the currently 
executing program may include thirty-two different segments. 
Remember, however, that the only program the p-machine knows how to 
execute is the operating system. That is the program that may consist of 
thirty-two segments. Segment zero is the operating system core, for in- 
stance, and segments two through six are permanently allocated to other 
SEGMENT subroutines that are called by the core from time to time. 
Thus, six of the thirty -two available segments are reserved for use by the 
operating system, leaving twenty-six for your programs. One of those 
twenty-six segments— segment number one, to be precise— is always 
your main program, and this leaves twenty-five segment slots that may 
be filled by any combination of SEGMENT subroutines and regular or 
INTRINSIC UNITs. 

But wait, you say. If a code file can contain only sixteen different 
segments, due to limitations on the size of its segment dictionary, how 
can a program make use of the other ten segment slots in the run-time 
segment table? It can make up the difference by calling upon INTRIN- 
SIC UNITs, because the code for such a UNIT does not appear in any of 
its clients' code files, nor does an entry for it take up space in any of its 
clients' segment dictionaries. Indeed, a particular program's segment 
dictionary can be completely filled with entries for regular UNITs and 
SEGMENT subroutines, yet the program may still use up to ten IN- 
TRINSIC UNITs. Of course, a program is certainly not limited to using 
just ten INTRINSIC UNITs. If a main program uses fewer than fifteen 
"conventional" segments (in other words, if its own segment dictionary

is not completely full), it may call upon more than ten INTRINSICs. 

Noload. Normal SEGMENT subroutines are not loaded into primary 
memory until they are called, while all of a client program's UNITs 
reside in primary memory at once. This doesn't have to be the case, 
however. You can make UNITs (even INTRINSIC ones) act like the 
SEGMENT subroutines they really are by placing the "noload" com- 
piler directive instruction, (*$N+*), at the begirming of your program. 
Then, when your program calls a UNIT subroutine, the appropriate 
code segment will be loaded into RAM memory from disk. When that 
segment is no longer active, the space it occupies in RAM will be 
reclaimed by the Pascal system for the benefit of incoming segments and 
data storage. Just as with segments, you may use the "resident" com- 
piler directive instruction, (*$R filename*), to "hold" a UNIT in RAM 
for an arbitrarily long period of time, whether or not any subroutines in 
the UNIT are active. Space limitations prevent a thorough recap of the 
"resident" instruction here; see the September 1983 issue for more 
details. 

"Gotchas." A few aspects of UNIT usage are neither immediately 
obvious from Apple's documentation nor amenable to brief explanation. 
We'll note them here, with littie or no elaboration: 

1. Any UNIT may use another UNIT of the same type. A regular 
UNIT may use another regular UNIT, and an INTRINSIC UNIT may 
use another INTRINSIC. Regular UNITs may even use INTRINSICs. 
But no INTRINSIC may use a regular UNIT. If you violate this rule, you 
will receive error message number 353 ("Nonintrinsic unit called from 
intrinsic unit"). 

2. When one UNIT uses another— that is, when one UNIT is the 
client of another — the appropriate USES declaration must be the first 
thing in the client's INTERFACE section. Refer to syntax diagrams in 
the September and October columns or in Apple's own manuals. 

3. No USES declaration may appear within an IMPLEMENTA- 
TION section. If you try to do this, the compiler will complain of error 
number 192 (" 'Uses' must be in interface section"). 

4. Files may be employed by UNITs only if they are declared in the 
INTERFACE section. If you declare a "private" file within the IM- 



PLEMENTATION section, you will receive error message number 191 
("No private files"), and the compiler will refuse to process your UNIT. 

5. Suppose your program uses a UNIT named ToolsC, which uses 
another, ToolsB, which in turn uses a third, ToolsA. (Let's assume that 
each is an INTRINSIC UNIT, though one or more could just as easily be 
of the "regular" persuasion.) Even though your program does not make 
direct use of either ToolsB or ToolsA, its USES declaration must look 
like this: 

USES ToolsA, ToolsB, ToolsC; 

In other words, the USES declaration in a client must name all UNITs 
that are relevant to the compilation, whether or not the client itself uses 
them explicitly. What's more, the most indirectly used UNITs must be 
named first (which accounts for the fact that the identifiers ToolsA and 
ToolsB precede ToolsC in the example above). 

6. UNITs may not contain SEGMENT subroutines. Your attempts to 
include such subroutines in your own UNITs will earn you error message 
number 185 ("Segment declaration not allowed in units"). 

7. Although UNITs may be defined within programs, they may not 
be defined within other UNITs. For instance, you may "nest" MyUnit 
within My Program, so long as you observe the syntax rules for doing so. 
But defining OtherUnit within MyUnit is out of the question and will 
cause the compiler to report error condition number 182 ("Nested units 
not allowed"). 

Moving 1984-ward! With a veritable armload of "dos and don'ts," 
you should now be reasonably well prepared to develop your own 
UNITs, both regular and INTRINSIC. However, your Pathfinder is not 
so naive as to believe that you will actually spend your holidays slaving 
over a hot Apple! And why should you? Enjoy yourself and the company 
of friends and family with our blessings and best wishes. When you 
return in January, however, be prepared to give your undivided attention 
to absolute and pure rationality— in numeric computation, that is! If you 
hated working with fractions in elementary school, you'll whistle ap- 
preciatively when you see how next month's special-purpose UNIT 
allows you to foist the drudgery onto your trusty Apple. ^

— From Kids Say the Damdest Things! 

On July 15, 1929, with ten dollars in his pocket, seventeen-year-old 
Art Linkletter hit the road. For a long, memorable year and a half, 
Linkletter and his friend of the same age, Denver Colorado Fox, rode the 
rails and explored the United States. 

The pair began their stint as hoboes in San Diego. The ride up the 
California coast to the state of Washington was educational and tiring for 
the tall, big-boned Linkletter, who was fresh out of high school. The 
self-reliant Linkletter— always sure that his presence of mind would get 
him out of tough situations— was just beginning to enjoy the experience 
when he and Fox were robbed and scared out of their wits by two hoboes 
with a gun in a freight car near a Walla Walla switching yard. 

It was a momentous and frightening beginning of a vagabond trek 
across the tense, stormy landscape of the Great Depression. Continuing 
their journey, Linkletter and Fox worked and rode their way east. The 
times were rough. Some towns didn't like hoboes and some railroad 
yards had tough guys with fists like rocks and names like "Big Stick." 
Other towns were friendly to the two teenagers, providing temporary 
jobs at which they could earn an honest buck or two. 

Hoboes Say the Darndest Things. Linkletter left San Diego with at 
least one skill that would serve him well on the road. He could type 
about ninety words a minute. At a time when Underwood prowess was a 
first-class ticket to instant employment, Linkletter's earnings made the 
two hoboes respectable temporary citizens in many large towns and cities 
across the country. 

Now you know part of the reason why Art Linkletter has no trouble 
getting along with those strange computer things called Apples. The man 
has known his way around a keyboard since before many of us 
were bom. 

It's now been a dozen years since Linkletter's House Party left TV, 
but the funny nice guy who entertained millions of people five days a 
week, every week, for two and a half decades with his quick-witted, 
humorous style and natural folksy manners is still a familiar name and a 
familiar face across the nation. 

This holiday season, a company called HomeComputer Software 
(Sunnyvale, CA) is marketing an education/entertainment software 
program — Kids Say the Damdest Things to Computers! — that combines 
some of the spontaneity of House Party and the fun and philosophy of the 
book Kids Say the Damdest Things! with the computer's unique abilities 
to involve the whole family in the game-playing process. 

The program is targeted for kids five to eleven years of age. Kids Say 
the Damdest Things to Computers! can be played by kids younger than 
five, but they'll usually require assistance to feel comfortable at the 
keyboard. Linkletter sees the product as more entertaining than educa- 
tional, but it's far more than just another home computer game. 

A fifty-year veteran of radio, TV, stage, books, and movies, Linklet- 
ter is the man who can cause an interviewee to lose all semblance of a 
stable mental makeup, the man who gets kids to embarrass the hell out of 
their parents on national television, the man who can deliver devastating 
one-liners with the true aim of a comedic marksman. 

Linkletter's People Are Funny played on national TV for nineteen 
years and his book. Kids Say the Damdest Things!, with illustrations by 
Charles Schulz and an introduction by Walt Disney, appeared in 1957. 
The book, which includes hilarious bits from Linkletter's countless TV 
and radio interviews of children, was a bestseller for two years. 

With his mature mind and an easy style that made him a friend to kids 
of all ages, Linkletter was a funny and friendly pyschologist on the tube. 
He didn't make fun of people and there was more to his shows than just 
endless gags. He interviewed adults and kids, parents and their off- 
spring, coaxing them to say what was on their minds, asking them about 
their everyday lives, uncovering the one element of humor that could be 
cleverly poked and then amplified into hysterical laughter across the 
nation. 

Linkletter helps people feel good about themselves. He likes to go in- 



Welcome lo 

iIRT 

UNfi 

IIJITEKN 




to the homes of American families, one way or another, and stir things 
up with the ultimate goal of bringing people together. He's taken his 
responsibilities as an internationally known celebrity very seriously 
through the years and is continuing to do so right on into the com- 
puter age. 

Bound for Glory. There were countless other, nontyping, jobs in 
store for Linkletter during his youthful odyssey. He worked in steel 
mills, theaters, hotels, meat-packing plants, and restaurants. Eventually 
he and his friend found their way to New York City where Linkletter got 
a job as a typist at the National City Bank on Wall Street. It was a hell of 
a time to be working on Wall Street — Linkletter arrived in town on Oc- 
tober 11, 1929 — but it was an interesting time in Linkletter's life. 

Linkletter did not fully comprehend what the stock market crash of 
1929 signified. But he would not always be in the dark about the matters 
of high finance. After he became a successful entertainer, first in radio 
and then in the young TV industry, Linkletter made many investments 
and had his hand in a lot of commercial schemes — in 1969, Forbes 




i today may not be as familiar with Art Linkletter as their counterparts were 
sixties, but the funny nice guy who has made millions laugh is still getting kids 
darndest things. A fifty-year veteran of TV and radio and the author of seventeen b< 
Linkletter is best known for his family-oriented entertainment. Linkletter's House Pan 



magazine estimated his holdings at $20 million. 

He's had his business successes, failures, and near-misses. In the late 
fifties he got into the Hula-Hoop craze. Linkletter Spin-a-Hoops were 
manufactured by twelve factories across the United States. Fortunately, 
Linkletter got out of the business before the craze melted away. 

These days, Linkletter is into oil wells, livestock, tamper-resistant 
bottle caps (following through with a project started by his late son 
Robert), mining, gas, and he is on the boards of several large companies, 
such as MGM/UA, Western Airlines, and a national insurance company. 
And now he's getting involved with the software business. 

Apples Compute the Gosh-Darndest Things. Linkletter's involve- 
ment with the Apple software business began when he was approached 
by a software company to act as a spokesperson for its products. He says 
the original plan at that company was to provide both software and hard- 
ware to churches for bookkeeping applications. In addition, Linkletter 
was asked to help design a Biblical education program for the family. 
When the company split in two, Linkletter stayed with the folks who 
founded HomeComputer Software. 

It was his eldest son Jack who first introduced Linkletter to the Apple 
II. Jack Linkletter lives in Emerald Bay, California, and bought 
an Apple for the usual reasons — home finance, some programming, 
telecommunications. During one visit with Jack and his family. Art 



started playing around with the computer. Now, when he visits, Linklet- 
ter uses the Apple to look at the Dow Jones News/Retrieval Service. 

Will Linkletter ever get a computer of his own? 

"I'll have one as soon as I need one," he says. "For right now, I get 
along just fine using Jack's." 

A consultant on all of HomeComputer Software's products, Linklet- 
ter has even done his own programming. His days as a typist on Wall 
Street and on the S.S. American Legion were long ago, but Linkletter 
remembers them when he thinks about sitting in front of a computer. "I 
was one of the original Kelly Girls. I was also a sailor on this ship. When 
the captain found out I could type, I never chipped paint again." 

Linkletter came up with the first version of Kids Say the Darndest 
Things to Computers! on Jack's Apple. The concept was crude and not 
up to commercial standards, but the example Linkletter set here is in- 
dicative of his belief that kids should work hard and learn usefijl skills 
they can carry with them through life. Linkletter's skill as a typist, 
besides keeping him above water at other times in his life, helped make it 
easier for him to learn the basics of programming. 

The version of Kids Say the Darndest Things to Computers! that is 
now showing up in computer stores around the country was a collab- 
orative effort between Linkletter and a couple of professional program- 
mers at HomeComputer Software.

Welcome to Art Linkletter's Apple Party. A hi res drawing of 
Linkletter greets you when you first boot up the program. A dialogue 
balloon, where the text of Art's interview questions is displayed, fills up 
almost half the screen. After the greeting, the hi-res Linkletter asks you 
to type in your name at the keyboard. Then you're asked if that is really 
your name. The interviewer makes occasional comments, such as, "Oh, 
Jill is a nice name," or "It's hard for me to see out of this computer; is 
there anybody else with you?" It's a nice touch. 

When parents get hoodwinked into playing the game, they needn't 
fret about answering the question of "How old are you?" If you're 
honest, the interviewer replies, "Okay, have it your way. You look 
younger than thirty-five to me." Similarly, the interviewer doesn't let 
the young user get away saying no to playing a game. "Are you kidding 
me?" he says. "Here's a game that even people who don't enjoy playing 
games will like to play." 

Once the initial interview is finished, a menu of ten games appears 
on-screen— with the name of the interviewee incorporated in the titles. 
Another nice touch. The ten games are story-creation exercises, wherein 
a child's answers to seemingly unrelated questions are used to construct 
short tales. The stories are a lot of fun and each conveys a lesson 
about life. 

As voice synthesis and voice recognition technologies improve. 



Linkletter and HomeComputer Software would like to allow kids really 
to say their damdest things straight to the computer, without having to 
use the keyboard. But for the moment, it's worthwhile to recall a chapter 
in Kids Say the Darndest Things! entitled "Kids Write the Darndest 
Things!" (Who could argue with the insight of the well-meaning kid who 
wrote to the president of the United States: "If you keep on doing so 
great, I'll bet you will probably go down in history like Rodolf the Red 
Nose Raindear.") 

Once a selection has been made from the menu, the electronic 
Linkletter asks: "Do you want to help me make a story?" If you say yes, 
the program proceeds normally; if you answer no, the program supplies 
random responses to the questions normally answered by the child and 
constructs a story anyway. 

The second story creation on the menu is called "Visitors from Outer 
Space." The young computerist is first asked to supply the name of his 
or her best friend and then to name a favorite food. Several of the ques- 
tions are simple requests for such things as a random number, your sec- 
ond favorite color, the town you live in, and a place you visited. Others 
are designed to stimulate the imagination: "Spell a sound you can make 
with your mouth besides talking" and "What is one way to spell the 
sound the straw makes when you get to the end of your milkshake?" 

Still other questions are designed to cause kids to think about their

At seventy-one, Art Linkletter is 
still a very funny guy. He likes to 
go into the homes of American 
families, one way or another, and 
stir things up with the ultimate 
goal of bnnging people together. 
He sees home computers as 
having the same ability as radio 
and TV to unite families while 
educating and entertaining both 
children and parents. 



emotions and feelings: "Picture something that feels very unpleasant. 
Can you touch it in your mind? Good! What is a word for how the thing 
in your mind feels?" The last question asks you to name something 
you'd like to do with friends when they come to visit. 

Once all the questions have been answered, the story is created and it 
starts out something like this: "One day Jack and Jill were walking down 
the street when they saw a bright orange spaceship from the planet Gig- 
gle (sound the mouth can make) land in the street and 1,238 (random 
number) pea green (second favorite color) Pluurruups (sound the straw 
makes) jump out its window (part of house)." 

Aliens Say the Strangest Things. As the main character in the story, 
the child displays no fear of the 1,238 pea green Pluurruups; "They are 
trying to be friendly. They want to taste our burritos." The Pluurruups 
leave and Jack and Jill are sad to see them go. "Maybe they'll come back 
to North Hollywood again and play cards with us sometime!" 

After the finished story has been read, there's an opportunity to learn 
"more about what the story means." In the case of "Visitors from Outer 
Space," the lesson to be learned is not to judge strangers by appearances 
alone. Other lessons include patience, selflessness, and gratitude. In at 
least one of the story explanations, children are advised to seek out more 
information about the lesson from someone they trust, such as a parent, 
or a best friend. 

"The goal of the games is to make kids think about life, their house, 
and family," Linkletter says. "At the same time, we're trying to teach 
them positive values like humility, kindness, and hard work. The pro- 
gram will help kids improve their reading and it will help develop their 
imaginations." 

The family unit is very important to Linkletter— he and his wife Lois 
raised five kids — and he has written several books on the subject of rais- 
ing kids. Linkletter himself was denied a stable, happy childhood by cir- 
cumstances beyond his control. 

Linkletter was born in the little town of Moose Jaw, in the Canadian 
province of Saskatchewan. An illegitimate child, Linkletter was adopted 
as a baby by John and Mary Linkletter. An unsuccessful insurance 
salesman in Moose Jaw, John Linkletter first moved the family to 
Lowell, Massachusetts, where he opened a general store. When that ven- 
ture proved unsuccessful, the LinJdetters moved all the way across the 
continent to Point Fermin, near Los Angeles. 

When the family moved again, to San Diego, the elder Linkletter 
resumed the shoemaker's trade he had learned as a boy. The family was 
forced at first to live in a charity home run by a local church. While liv- 
ing in this house, the grateful and impressionable John Linkletter heard 
the call. The Reverend Mr. Linkletter, as he dubbed himself, believed in 
the direct approach to spreading the Lord's word, and his congregation 
consisted largely of passersby on the street corners of San Diego. 



Old-Time Religion. Young Art Linkletter would often be called 
upon to assist his father in helping people to see the light. More than a 
few times young Linkletter felt humiliated by the situation and, with the 
knowledge that he was adopted, grew more and more convinced that life 
with the Linkletters was a temporary thing. When the time came, he 
would strike out on his own. And he did. 

The situation hasn't changed much, fifty-four years after Linkletter 
and Denver Fox first hit the road. Seventy -one-year-old Linkletter still 
spends a large part of his time traveling, lecturing, and speaking to 
students, parents, and youth groups about drug abuse. He has become a 
crusader, a preacher in his own way, with an audience that he cares very 
much about. 

The death of his youngest daughter Diane, in an LSD-related in- 
cident, gave Linkletter something to fight against and something to 
defend. 

"Problems like drug abuse occur when parents aren't communicating 
with their kids. It's very important for kids and parents to do things to- 
gether," Linkletter believes. The family unit has a lot to offer the grow- 
ing child— love and companionship, friendship and support. Linkletter 
also believes that the teachings of Christianity are invaluable in the rais- 
ing of kids, though there are no religious elements in Kids Say the Dam- 
dest Things to Computers! 

Linkletter and HomeComputer Software are working on software 
programs based on some of his other books, such as How To Be a Super- 
salesman. Through the years, Linkletter has written several times about 
such subjects as positive thinking and self-improvement. He sees current 
crazes such as aerobics classes and health club membership as indica- 
tions that people like to improve themselves. 

"What's that joke going around? If God had wanted us to exercise he 
would have put Jane Fonda in the Bible." 

Computers Are Funny. Linkletter is perhaps the first big personality 
in the entertainment world to become directly involved with the mer- 
chandising of personal computer software. More will surely follow him. 
HomeComputer Software has released a golf game designed by pro 
golfer Tom Weiskopf, and other sports stars are getting into the act. The 
desire to link computers with such popular pastimes as entertainment ac- 
tivities and athletics is increasing as the software industry serves more 
consumers each year. 

Thirty years ago, Linkletter turned down an offer from Walt Disney 
to have first chance at acquiring the land immediately surrounding the 
site that would become Disneyland. Linkletter has kicked himself in the 
pants over that decision for the last quarter century. Luckily, kids and 
grown-ups never stop learning. As we enter the new year, Linkletter is 
not about to miss out on the fun, fame, and fortune of the computer 
revolution. HI

Your best buy in modem history Tiie 
Networkery" a plug-in single-slot di- 
rect connect modem for your Apple II, 
\\ + . and lie (or Franklin, Albert, or 
other Apple compatible computer). 
You are immediately linked to the 
vast network of computers — data 
bases like the Source'r Compu- 
serve?' or Dow Jonesf' friends, banks 
businesses, and hundreds of local "bulletin 
boards." For only $129. There's absolutely 
nothing else to buy And it even comes with 
software 

This is the modem that does it all. and does 
it for less. The Apple Communications Card is on 
board, so you won't need to buy one. That will 
save a bunch. It's 300 baud, the most commonly 
used type of modem. It comes complete with its 
own communications software on Apple compati- 
ble disk, giving you features no modem offers. 

Like "data capture" to lock the messages 
into your Apples' RAM, and then move the infor- 
mation onto a disk for easy reference and review. 
A terminal program that turns your computer into 
a communications command center, displaying 
on-screen "help" menus, continuous updates of 
memory usage, carrier presence, baud rate, 
communications status, all while taking in and 
displaying information from any computer. 

The Networker supports both originate and 
answer modes, so you can send and receive in- 
formation, in full or half duplex modes. And its 
all easily programmable right from the keyboard 
of your Apple computer. All you do is plug Net- 
worker into any slot (except 0) in your Apple 
computer. It'll even ask you what slot it's in. 
It's that easy to use. 




NETMASTER^" COMMUNICATIONS 
SOFTWARE 

For $179 we include the even more incredible 
Netmaster software for advanced users. Net- 
master IS a "communications freeway" that 
lets you speed any Apple file to another Apple 
through noisy phone lines, without errors. Net- 
master even includes its own Disk Operating 
System to control the flow of information and 
leave you over 40K of "buffer" memory from 
your 64K RAM. And there's always help when 
you want it. On screen. Status indicators keep 
you fully updated. 

Netmaster will let you transfer games, 
computer graphics, programs, sales reports, 
documents, any DOS 3.3 file, all directly from 
disk to disk, all with computer (not telephone) 
accuracy. Netmaster is completely configurable 
to understand any computer, even mainframes. 
File size is unlimited. 

But Netmaster is not stuffy. It will talk to 
the other communications packages like Visi- 
term"^' or ASCII Express.'' Of course they don't 
support Netmaster's superb error checking, 
that guarantees you won't miss even a comma. 
It doesn't only talk to the Networker either It 
will also talk to those more expensive modems 
from Hayes and Novation. 



And Netmaster is fast. It trans- 
fers information disk to disk three to 
five times faster than the others. Of 
course Netmaster is fully compatible 
with them. But if you want things to 
happen really fast, talk to another 
Netmaster. 
We sell Netmaster by itself for $79, 
and even if you have another modem for your 
Apple, Netmaster is an outstanding value. It will 
even support auto dial and auto answer. Net- 
master requires 48K of Apple memory, disk 
drive and DOS 3.3, and ZOOM'S Networker 
modem or another modem. It can also be used 
without a modem when two Apples are hard- 
wired together, using a 6850 or 6551 -based in- 
terface card. 

Networker, Netmaster, and Networker/ 
Netmaster combo are all produced in the USA 
by ZOOM Telephonies, producers of the popular 
DEMON DIALER. The Networker is FCC regis- 
tered, and all products come with a one-year 
warranty.

Not too long ago, we said something about terminal programs and 
how they instruct the computer to perform all sorts of nifty tricks with 
the modem. This time we're going to look at some of those nifty tricks. 
More important, we'll discover exactly what a terminal program is, what 
it's used for, who needs one, and why. 

What the Heck Is It? A terminal program is software that makes the 
modem and computer work together. Modems usually have programs 
built into them in the form of ROM chips, but these programs are of 
limited capability. For the most part, they offer sets of operating com- 
mands, access to memory locations, and routines that can be used by 
other programs, namely terminal programs. 

A terminal program allows you to manipulate the modem, much the 
way a word processing program lets you manipulate the computer. In 
this way, a terminal program acts more like a link between you and the 
modem than between computer and modem. 

For example, Smartcom I, the terminal program that comes on disk 
with the Hayes Micromodem lie, lets you change from pulse dialing to 
Touch-Tone dialing at the touch of a key. To do this without software 
would require a moderate knowledge of programming. 

It should be understood that it's possible to operate a modem without 
a terminal program, just as it's possible to use a computer without soft- 
ware; however, the scope of such use is extremely limited. It's also pos- 
sible to communicate with someone who's using a terminal program on 
the other end, even though you're not using one. What it comes down to 
is this: Using a modem doesn't require having a terminal program, but 
having one allows you to perform more functions. Terminal programs 
are the muscles that allow us to get the most out of the bare bones of a 
modem. 

What's in a Name, Revisited. Before we start finding out what ter- 
minal programs are for and how they work, it would help to know why 
they're called terminal programs. 

Information that moves along the phone lines can stop only where 
there's a "place" for it to get off, such as a telephone. When you reach 
out and touch Mom to tell her you love her, those endearing words jump 
onto the phone lines and don't stop until they get to her phone (unless the 
line is tapped somewhere along the way, in which case, the nosy person 
can eavesdrop, but the data continues to Mom's phone). 

Information that's being sent from one computer to another via 
telephone lines travels similarly. Just like passengers on a train, all those 
bits sent out from one computer are put on a nonstop ride to the other 
computer; they can't get off until they reach a terminal. For train riders, 
it might be Grand Central Station; for computer bits it could be an Apple, 



an IBM Personal Computer, or a DEC 10 mainframe. 

Because computers with modems can act as either points of origin or 
as destinations for information, they're referred to as terminals. A termi- 
nal program, then, is software that helps the computer function as a 
terminal. 

Two confusing words often used in describing terminals are smart 
and dumb. Dumb terminals are those whose sole purpose in life is to ma- 
nipulate other computers. An example would be the terminal an airline 
agent uses to book reservations and write tickets for passengers. This 
kind of machine is hooked up to a much larger computer and does noth- 
ing but let the agent communicate with it. Without the main computer, 
the dumb terminal is useless. 

Educated Apple. Smart terminals are like wise sages that the dumb 
terminals come to for enlightenment. In the previous example, the smart 
terminal is the airline's main computer that stores flight schedules and 
passenger lists. A dumb terminal can have access to this information, but 
it doesn't retain any of it permanently; rather, a dumb terminal looks up 
information in the smart terminal's storage system, sometimes modifies 
it, and then sends it back to the smart terminal. 

Think of a smart terminal as the teacher and dumb terminals as stu- 
dents. Students who want to learn consult and communicate with the 
teacher, but a teacher who wants to learn doesn't often go to the students 
for help (unless it has something to do with the latest in pop music). In- 
stead, the teacher asks other teachers, preferably those who sfjecialize in 
a particular field of knowledge. 

With a modem, the Apple functions as a smart terminal, but it can 
also act as a dumb one. An Apple-run bulletin board service is an exam- 
ple of a smart terminal, while an Apple used at home to communi- 
cate with the company computer at the office is an example of a dumb 
terminal. 

Whether your Apple functions as a smart or dumb terminal depends 
on the software running on it. Some terminal programs can turn the com- 
puter into a smart terminal or dumb terminal only; others let you switch 
the computer between being smart or dumb. 

When trying to determine what sort of terminal program is right for 
your needs, it helps to know what various programs can do. What 
follows is a summary of some common terminal program features and 
how they work. 

Walk This Way, Please. One of the most valuable features of a ter- 
minal program, if you plan to use it for calling up systems like BBSs, 
CompuServe, or the Dow Jones News/Retrieval Service, is its ability to 
route information to an area of the computer's memory known as the 



100 



DECEMBER 1983 



buffer. Though it sounds rudimentary, this function is not built into the 
modem. The modem knows only how to receive information and send it 
to the screen or a printer for the user to see. Terminal programs can open 
the computer's memory so it can hold information to be read later. 

At a transmission speed of 300 baud (bits per second), information 
comes in at almost forty characters per second; at this speed, it's hard 
enough to read information without having the screen scroll up for each 
new line. Most of the time, it's possible to stop temporarily the flow of 
data coming through, but that just means the computer has to be on the 
phone longer. As a result, phone bills go up, as do charges if you happen 
to be logged on to a subscription service. 

A capture feature puts all the information being transmitted into the 
buffer. With a capture feature, you can let the Apple receive all the infor- 
mation you're interested in without interrupting it and then read it after 
logging off the remote system. If the information is something you'd like 
to refer to later, such as stock market reports or news items, you can 
store the contents of the buffer on disk in the form of a text file or print 
a hard copy for permanent record. 

Message in a Bottle. The opposite of receiving and storing is the 
process of sending prepared information. A terminal program doesn't af- 
fect the way two people can "talk" to each other via modem; the pro- 
gram's terminal mode allows them to type back and forth the same way 
they can without a terminal program. That's one way to send informa- 
tion, but it's usually reserved for conversation. When you want to send 
information in bulk, file transfer is the way to go. 

In telecommunications, there are two kinds of files: text files and 
nontext files. That's not a very detailed description, but it's all that mat- 
ters when we're talking about transferring files by modem. The modem 
doesn't care what is being sent; it only cares whether it's a text file. 

Nontext files include Applesoft, binary, Pascal, and CP/M files that 
aren't composed of text characters. We'll look at how to transfer these 
kinds of files in a moment. But first, let's examine text file transfer. 

From the modem's point of view, sending a text file is the same as 
typing very fast; the modem thinks someone is at the keyboard inputting 
all the characters, when the data is really coming from a text file on disk 
or from the buffer. Earlier we said that inputting text characters from the 



keyboard and having the person at the other end see it doesn't require 
both parties to have the same terminal program. Thus, sending text files 
doesn't require both parties to have the same program either, since the 
modem thinks there's really somebody typing. 

Text files can be prepared with any word processor that stores data as 
standard text files, or they can be prepared by using a terminal program's 
editor. An editor is like a miniature word processor that's built into the 
terminal program. With it, you can create messages and store them on 
disk as standard Apple text files to be sent wherever and whenever 
you want. 

Editors are normally used to create brief messages such as business 
memos or public messages to be posted on a BBS. Letters, reports, and 
other lengthy documents are usually generated by a word processor and 
then sent by a terminal program. 

The text editors of different terminal programs have different capa- 
bilities, depending on the aim of the program. 

Programs like ASCII Express .The Professional include a simple 
editor which you can use to create text and edit lines. A program like Mi- 
cro/Courier, which is intended for jjeople who plan to transfer interof- 
fice memorandums, includes an editor with a few more capabilities. 
Micro/Courier's editor lets you delete and reposition words or even 
whole paragraphs with just a few keystrokes. 

Object Code Objection. Currently, it's not possible to exchange 
anything but text files if the communicating Apples aren't using the same 
terminal program. That means programs (object code files) can't be sent 
unless they're converted to text files first (the instructions for converting 
Basic and binary files to text and vice versa are found in The DOS 
Manual). Once a program is in text file form, it can be transmitted like a 
normal text file. 

Text files are transferred byte by byte as standard ASCII characters, 
which are generated by using a combination of seven bits. For the pur- 
pose of creating a character, the eighth bit doesn't matter; it does matter 
when defining whether to display a character in a normal or flashing 
mode. 

When text files are transferred, terminal programs sometimes 
manipulate the eighth bit for various reasons specific to each program.

Softerm 1 

The Complete, Upgradeable Package 
for Home or Business Use 

Softerm 1 is a powerful and flexible terminal emula- 
tion program tfiat operates on an Apple II, II Plus, 
or lie to provide basic terminal communications to 
a variety of host computers, timesharing services, 
and information services such as The Sourcef^ 
CompuServe"" and the Dow Jones News/ Retrieval " 
It operates full or half-duplex at speeds up to 
9600 bps using either a direct connection or any 
standard manual or auto-dial modem. Features in- 
clude user-defined keyboard macros, built-in phone 
book for automatic dialing, terminal mode line 
capture simultaneously to print or disk, copy screen 
to print or disk, and terminal status display. 

DOS, CP/M, and PASCAL 
File Compatibility Combined In 
a Single Program 

Softerm 1 incorporates an advanced file manager 
which provides compatibility with DOS 3.3, CP/M, 
and Pascal disk formats for all file operations 
including file transfers. And at speeds up to 5 times 
faster than standard Apple DOS! Built-in disk utili- 
ties provide INIT, CATALOG. RENAME, and DELETE 
commands for all disk formats. Wildcard match char- 
acters can be used whenever filenames are entered. 

Local file transfers allow DOS, CP/M, or Pascal 
files to be displayed, printed, or even copied to 
another disk. For example, a file on a CP/M for- 
matted disk in Drive 1 could be copied to a Pascal 
formatted disk in Drive 2 providing a complete 
format conversion capability. Numerous editing 
options such as tab expansion and removing 
unwanted characters allow easy reformatting of 
data to accommodate the variations in data formats 
used by host computers. 



Multi-Protocol 

File Transfer Capability 

Softerm 1 offers file transfer methods flexible 
enough to match any host computer requirement. 
These include the character protocol with user- 
definable characteristics to provide maximum flexi- 
bility for text file transfers to any computer. The 
CP/M User's Group standard XMODEM protocol 
may be used for binary file transfers with systems 
using the CP/M operating system. The intelligent 
Softrans protocol can be used to transfer any type 
file and provides automatic binary encoding and 
decoding, error detection and automatic retransmis- 
sion, and data compression to enhance line utiliza- 
tion. A FORTRAN 77 source program is supplied 
with Softerm 1 which is easily adaptable to any 
host computer to allow communications with 
Softerm using the Softrans protocol. Specific host 
computer versions of the Softrans FORTRAN pro- 
gram are available on request. 
Softerm file transfer utilizes an easy to use com- 
manct language which may be executed interactively 
or from a macro command file which has been 
previously entered and saved on disk. Twenty-three 
high-level commands include DIAL. CATALOG. 
SEND RECEIVE ONERR. MONITOR HANGUP, and 
others. A SCHEDULE command even allows file 
transfers at a specific date and time. 

Softerm 2

This doesn't affect the character; with the eighth bit on or off, an A is an 
A, a B is a B, and so on, because the other seven bits that define the 
character are still the same. 

The reason we don't send programs this way is because the bytes con- 
tained in a program's code use all eight bits. Thus, if the terminal pro- 
gram altered the eighth bit in any way, the program being sent would be 
garbled. Likewise, Pascal and CP/M program files aren't sent in the 
same manner as text files— data integrity must be ensured. 

Two computers using the same terminal program can perform some- 
thing known as protocol transfers, which make it possible to send and 
receive DOS, Pascal, and CP/M program files (nontext files). 

(Here, protocol transfer doesn't mean sending protocol from one 
place to another; it refers to a method of transferring information.) 

In political circles, protocol is a set of points that negotiators agree 
upon before signing a formal agreement. In telecommunications, proto- 
col means the same thing; it refers to a format of data transmission that 
both computers agree to use. 

This is very important because if the receiving computer expects data 
to come in a certain way and the sending computer sends it a different 
way, all sorts of confusion will result. Imagine what would happen if you 
decided to hold a formal party complete with shellfish, sushi bars, ice 
sculptures, and a string quartet. But you forgot to mention formal attire 
on the invitations, and your guests were too dim to call for more infor- 
mation. What a surprise everyone would be in for when they showed up 
in chinos and designer jeans and you (or the butler) greeted them wearing 
a tuxedo. 

And More Objections. Many terminal programs, including Tran- 
send, ASCII Express :The Professional, Smartcom I, and Micro/Courier, 
have protocol transfer features. However, an Apple using Transend can't 
do a protocol transfer with another Apple that's using Smartcom I. 
Makers of terminal programs can't be sure that another Apple you're 
communicating with will be using the same protocol. So the general rule 
is that, if you want to perform a protocol transfer, then both sides of the 
transfer must be running the same terminal software. 

The transfer of program files is done through verification protocol, 
which transfers all types of files (text or nontext) without any errors; if it 
can't transfer without error, it won't transfer at all. 

A constant source of aggravation for nontechnical users is the pro- 
liferation of initials and abbreviations that technical users introduce to 
the computing field. In protocol transfers, CRC is one of those abbrevia- 
tions, and it stands for cyclic redundancy check, which is what verifica- 
tion protocol uses to find errors. 

Very simply, here's how a CRC process works. Bytes of data are sent 
in blocks. By looking at certain characters, CRC compares how the 
block looked when it was sent and how it looks when it's received. If 
there are any discrepancies, the same block is sent again. Verification 
protocol is much like a music teacher; it demands that the process be per- 
formed repeatedly until it's done right. But even a music teacher's pa- 
tience has a limit; after about ten tries, the program gives up the transfer 
process as futile. 

For Strong Stomachs Only. For a detailed description of how a 
CRC works, let's look at a popular verification protocol, the Christensen 
protocol. This method transfers data in blocks of 128 bytes, with a 
checksum byte slapped onto the end of the block. A checksum is a crucial 
device in Christensen protocol that verifies that all data has remained in- 
tact. When a 128-byte block of data is sent, the sum of all the bytes' val- 
ues is sent with it; that sum is called the checksum. At this point, try to 
imagine this 128-byte block as a train carrying 128 people. The train's 
checksum would be the total weight of all the passengers and their 
baggage. 

When the other computer receives the block, it starts adding up all the 
bytes as they arrive (picture all the passengers stepping onto a huge scale 
as they get off the train). Once it's done that, it compares its checksum 
with the checksum of the sending computer. If the checksums match, it 
means all the bytes arrived safely, so the receiving computer sends back 
an "okay" character, signaling the sender to transmit the next block 
of data. 

But what if they don't match? That means that a byte was altered 
somehow, which is comparable to the train's losing baggage or unau- 
thorized passengers hopping aboard the train on the way. If the check- 
sums don't match, the receiving computer sends back a "not okay" 
character, signaling the sender to transmit the same block again. 



Here's where things get hairy. Let's suppose everything arrived in- 
tact and the receiving computer sent the "okay" character, but the 
sender didn't receive it. The sending computer waits awhile, concludes 
that things are "not okay," and sends the same block again. But now the 
second block will be a duplicate of the block the receiving computer just 
received. 

The Christensen protocol takes care of this potential problem by 
assigning a number to each block. If, as described, the sending computer 
resends the same block, the receiver sees the block number and 
recognizes that it's the same block all over again. When this happens, it 
sends back the "okay" character, discards the block, and waits for the 
next one. Now the two computers are caught up with each other. 

No More Busy-work. Logging on to remote systems can require 
anything from simply hitting the return key to spending several minutes 
typing in your name, identification number, password, and any other 
pertinent information. To help you get through the log-on procedure with 
minimal effort, some terminal programs provide macros. 

In assembly language programming, a macro is a type of instruction 
that represents several instructions. In culinary arts, the instructions 
"Fill the pot with water, put the egg in the pot, and boil the egg for three 
minutes" could be simplified to the macro "Fix a soft-boiled egg." 

Terminal program macros let you execute several instructions with 
one command. Using the program's macro editor, it's possible to assem- 
ble the kinds of input that would normally be typed at the keyboard. 

Let's suppose a BBS requires Jimmy Jack to input his name, phone 
number, and password in order to gain access to the system. He can put 
together a macro that would send all that information when prompted to 
do so. If the prompt looks like this: 

Please type your full name: 

Jimmy can create a macro to send the string Jimmy Jack, followed by a 
carriage return when the BBS sends the : (colon) character. 
Next, when the prompt asks for his phone number: 

Please enter your phone number (XXX-XXX-XXXX):

Jimmy's macro will send the string (617) 555-4334, followed by a car- 
riage return when it sees the : character again. 

So, not only can macros send the information Jimmy would otherwise 
have to type himself, they can send it when prompted by the remote sys- 
tem to do so. 

And Wait, There's More. The usefulness of macros goes far beyond 
the log-on process. They can send commands to read any mail sent to 
you, store it on disk, and even send messages stored on disk to the 
remote system. You have only to touch a few keys. Some terminal pro- 
grams can be configured to call a system at particular times (if a clock 
card is part of the computer's setup) and execute macros automatically. 
This little feature comes in handy when you want to take advantage of 
nighttime telephone rates. 

Macros can be thought of as very simple programs that run in the 
form of "Perform the first action on the list when the first prompt comes 
along; perform the second action on the list when the second prompt 
comes along, and so on." To use macros effectively, it's necessary to be 
familiar with the kind of system you'll be logging on to. In our earlier ex- 
ample, Jimmy Jack knew exactly what information the remote computer 
would ask for, in what order it would ask for it, and what character 
would be the prompt for his response. 

A typical ASCII Express macro for Jimmy Jack's favorite BBS might 
look like this: 

%AG'%:Y'<yo?42JJ3' 

Whoa! Say what? Here's what it all means: 

%aG That a G stands for control-G, which represents the bell 
sound. The percent sign tells ASCII Express to wait until it 
receives a specific character; in this case, control-G is that 
character. 

' This sends a carriage return, which tells the BBS to send its 

greeting message. 
%: Wait for the : character. On this BBS, the first occurrence 

of this character asks if Jimmy has a password. 
Y' Send a Y and a carriage return to tell it Jimmy has a 

password. 



%? Wait for the BBS to send the question mark, which asks 
Jimmy to enter his password. 

42JJ3' This is Jimmy's password followed by a carriage return. 

Jimmy is now logged on to the system. This is a very simple example. 
When Jimmy calls up the Source or CompuServe, things get much more 
complicated; the macro can read mail, post and remove messages, and 
download the latest sports stories from the wire services. 

Miscellaneous Junk. Text file transfer, text editors, protocol trans- 
fer, and macros are generally the most powerful features of terminal pro- 
grams. Of course, which features are considered important depends on 
how the modem is being used. Someone who intends to call Dow Jones 
News/Retrieval will find macros invaluable, while someone who uses a 
modem for exchanging programs with a friend will look for a program 
with protocol transfer abilities. 

Other things to consider when deciding on which terminal program to 
get: Does it handle CP/M and Pascal files (if that's pertinent)? What 
baud rates does it work with? Does it run in an unattended mode? How 
large is the capture buffer? Can it send text files to multiple addresses au- 
tomatically? And how much does it cost? 

Don't Talk to Strangers. So far we've looked at a communication 
setup between two Apples only. It's possible for modem-equipped Ap- 
ples to call and communicate with other kinds of computers, but it's not 
possible for Apples to exchange files with them. 

No matter what the setup, an Apple can't send a binary file to an IBM 
Personal Computer; it can't receive files from a DEC VTIOO; and it 
can't exchange text files with a TRS-80. Why not? Because each of these 
machines uses a different microprocessor and operating system. Where- 
as a standard Apple II uses a 6502 microprocessor and DOS 3.3 as an 
operating system, most IBM pes run the MS-DOS operating system 
through an 8088 microprocessor. 

Because of these differences among various computers, the exchange 
of information among them has been a problem. It can't be done. That is, 
not yet. 

Next time, we'll look at a change in the telecommunications field that 
should eliminate the problem of dissimilar computers not being able to 
talk to each other.

of speaking in four different voice modes 
which range from a robotic machine voice to 
natural female speech. (The fixed speech and 
custom modes are optional.) 

It's Easy To Use 

Unlike other speech systems, the ECHOs 
are very simple to use. It only takes a minute 
or two to get the ECHO talking. Any text 
which can be printed to the screen can be 
spoken. If you've written a BASIC program 
you can add speech with simple modifications. 

Software Compatibility 

Not only can you add speech to the programs 
you write yourself, over 25 top educational 
and adventure software manufacturers are 
currently designing programs to be compatible 
with the ECHO][. Be watching for details. 




Value 

Each ECHO comes ready to use with a speaker 
and tutorial-style manual. The ECHO][, 
priced at $149.95, also comes with a variety 
of demonstration and utility programs . The new 
ECHO GP (General Purpose), priced at $199.95 
is a stand-alone unit with its own on-board 
microprocessor; it will interface with any 
computer through the serial port. All ECHOs 
have a one year warranty. 

Bells And Whisdes 

If you want bells, whistles, music and sound 
effects, plus state-of-the-art sprite graphics 
capabilities, the ECHO technology is available 
on Synetix Systems' new Supersprite Board. 

Check It Out 

Most Apple dealers have the ECHO][ available 
for demonstration as part of Street Electronics/

Lining Up the Straight Facts 



From the information presented in last month's column, we now 
know a little about the Apple II and how its hi-res graphics screen works. 
The most important thing we learned was how to overcome the technical 
problems posed by the Apple's screen mapping. We saw how to do this 
very effectively using four simple tables. 

Hidden in all of that tech talk were some important facts about the 
Apple II that should be brought out now. These hi-res facts, like the axi- 
oms underlying a mathematical theory, shape much of what follows. 

Hi-Res Fact Number One: The hi-res screen is really just a piece of 
the Apple's memory, and it can be easily and quickly modified by the 
Apple's microprocessor chip, the 6502. 

This hi-res fact describes the architecture of the Apple II. While it 
seems obvious, we make a point of stating it because it is so important. 
Including the display screen in the computer's memory space is earth- 
shaking because it represents a new focus on rapid interaction. 

Before the personal computer explosion, most computers had display 
terminals attached to them, almost as if the user's relationship to the 
computer was an afterthought. Interaction was limited by the rate at 
which the computer could talk to the terminal, which was extremely slow 
compared to the rate at which the computer could execute instructions. 
Many of the first microcomputers followed in this tradition. They were 
just like little mainframe computers. 

But Wozniak and Jobs were visionaries. They put the text and hi-res 
display screens in the memory of the Apple n because they anticipated 
many of the highly interactive uses to which their new toy could be put. In 
this sense, they really did invent the personal computer, as Apple has 
sometimes claimed. 

Almost every personal computer that has followed the Apple II has 
had the same architecture: processor, plus memory, plus built-in display 
memory. In the future, this architecture may be the definition of "person- 
al computer," and it may become the only real difference between the 
microcomputer on your desk and the office mainframe. 

Hi-Res Fact Number Two: The hi-res screen memory is organized 
into scan lines. All of the dots on the same horizontal row of the video 
display are stored near each other in memory. 

Hi-res fact number two implies that, if we have just changed a dot, it 
isn't much more work to change another dot that's on the same scan line. 
Since all the controlling bytes of any horizontal line in the screen 
memory are always within forty bytes of each other (the width of the 
scan line in bytes), we can use the same scan line address to get at both 
dots. We saw this demonstrated last time when we wrote a simple loop to 



clear a scan line to black. We had to calculate the address of the scan line 
only once, even though we cleared 280 dots. Clearing 280 dots randomly 
located on the screen would have taken much longer because we would 
have had to have calculated the scan line address for each dot. 

Therefore, if we're smart, we'll design our algorithms so that they 
draw in what is called scan line order. What this means is that when we 
draw something, we will try to draw it in the same way that a bricklayer 
might build a brick wall: one row at a time, starting at the bottom and 
working upward (or going from top to bottom, since there's no such 
thing as gravity inside a computer program) . 

If we wanted to draw a rectangle, for example, we would draw it as a 
series of horizontal rows of dots, or bars, of the same length, each bar or 
row directly over (or under) the previous one. We would be crazy to try 
to draw it as a series of vertical bars, because we would be calculating 
the same scan line addresses over and over. The hi-res screen has a 
definite grain, and we'll always want to go with that grain. 

Hi-Res Fact Number Three: Each byte in the hi-res screen memory 
controls exactly seven dots on the video display. The seven least signifi- 
cant bits of the byte are switches, each of which turns one dot on or off. 

At the end of last month's column, we listed a program for mming on 
a dot on the hi-res screen. You may have noticed that it was some trouble 
to isolate a single bit from a byte and change it. This is always the case: 
It is easier to get a byte than it is to get a bit within a byte. Thus, fact 
number three implies that it is easier to change seven dots than it is to 
change one! (As long as the seven dots are all in the same byte.) 

If we are clever, then, we'll try to change the screen a byte at a time 
whenever we can. This will speed up our graphics operations by a factor 
of more than seven. For those of you who aren't sure, this is good. 

Now we have a much better idea of how we should operate on the hi- 
res screen. The most obvious approach would be to draw objects by 
breaking them up into individual dots and then use a point-plotting sub- 
routine to put them on the screen. While this strategy is simple, we saw 
that, because it doesn't take advantage of the peculiarities of the Apple's 
screen mapping, it requires a lot of extra calculation. It isn't efficient. 

A better drawing utility would be one that draws a horizontal row of 
dots in a single operation. Such a utility would be generally useful since 
we can break up any shape on the display screen into a collection of rows 
of dots. Geometrical shapes like rectangles, circles, triangles, and lines 
can be easily reduced to rows of the proper widths. Even a single point 
can be thought of as a very short row consisting of a single dot. 

This row-drawing utility, which we will call HLINE, clearly takes 



108 



WUTAI ]l 



DECEMBER 1983 



advantage of the Apple n screen mapping. We saw that we won big when 
we were able to draw a lot of dots on the same scan line at one time; this 
is just what HLINE tries to do. Also, it is easy to implement HLINE in 
such a way that, for long rows of dots, it operates on the screen memory 
one byte, rather than one bit, at a time. In fact, it's hard to implement 
HLINE poorly. 

HLINE exploits facts number one and two, and we can expect very 
good performance using it. There is, however, a danger. If the objects 
that we want to draw are composed of many tiny rows of dots, we will 
again find ourselves doing a lot of repetitive calculations, and losing big. 
HLINE will thrive on a few long rows of dots, but it will choke on lots of 
little rows. Unfortunately, objects like text and icons are made up of lots 
of tiny rows and will glut HLINE, so we'll have to think of a better way 
to draw them. Note that, for the same reason, point plotting is also un- 
satisfactory for drawing text and icons. 

For now we'll be satisfied with drawing simple geometrical objects. 
HLINE will let us draw these fast. We're almost ready to begin. 

But first, we need to explain what we mean by the word draw. What 
exactly do we want HLINE to do to a row of dots? We'll want to be able 
to turn dots on and off, but are there any other operations that we'll 
find useful? 

We are limited in our choice of operations only by the instruction set 
of the 6502 processor in our Apple. This is not really much of a limit. In 
fact, most people would be hard put to give an example of a function that 
was not computable on an Apple II. 

What operations make sense? We could multiply bytes in the screen 
memory, since screen bytes are, after all, just like other bytes in 
memory. This would not make sense because bytes in the screen memory 
are not numbers or characters. Rather, they are sets of seven switches, 
each one independent of the other six. We noted before that we should 
think of a byte of screen data as a group of separate bits, so we should 
really consider only operations that work on bits or groups of bits. 

The simplest operation on a bit is to leave it alone. This isn't terribly 
useful. 



The next simplest operations are those that force bits to either 0 or 1 . 
Forcing screen memory bits to take on the value 0 is the same as turning 
dots off on-screen, while forcing bits to take on the value 1 is the same as 
mrning dots on. We have already decided that we need to be able to per- 
form these operations. We will call them clear and fill. 

Another simple operation reverses the state of a bit. This operation 
will change Os to Is and vice versa. It is an interesting operation, because 
it is its own inverse. That is, it can be used to undo itself. Suppose, for 
example, that we invert some screen bits that are set to 0. This will mm 
on the bits and their corresponding display dots. Now we invert the same 
bits again. The screen bits that were just set to Is will be reset to Os, and 
the display dots will be turned off. The reversibility of this operation will 
make it a useful addition to our repertoire. We will call this opera- 
tion invert. 

There are more complicated operations that are also quite useful. 
Sometimes, we will want to turn bits on or off according to a pre- 
determined pattern. For example, we might want to draw a rectangle 
filled with a checkerboard pattern. This would be hard with the simple 
operations we have already described. 

What this requires is an operation that looks at the position of the bit 
in the screen memory and sets or resets it so that it complies with the re- 
quired pattern. This is a very different kind of operation, which we'll call 
pattern fill. 

The choice of these four operations might seem arbitrary. That's 
because it is. We could have chosen some very different operations. This 
particular set of four has proven useful for a lot of different applications, 
so our HLINE subroutine will be able to perform them. 

Well, we seem to have made it through a column without any ma- 
chine language. Instead of coding we have talked philosophy and 
developed a strategy for drawing geometrical objects. 

Next month we'll take the plunge and write the HLINE subroutine 
in assembly language. Because a lot of drawing programs will be de- 
pending on HLINE, we'll pull some tricks to make sure it is as fast as we 
can make it. 31

TO MAKE THE FIRST BASKET- 
BALL PROGRAM that feels like the 
real thing, it helps to start with two guys 
who know what the real thing feels like. 

Enter Larry Bird and Julius Erving. 
Bird — the hustler, the strong man, 
deadly from outside. Erving —The 
Doctor, maybe the most explosive 
player in the history of the game. 

We talked to them, photographed 
them in action, studied their moves and 
their stats and their styles. Then we 
set out to create on computer disc an 
event which may never happen in real 
life. We put the two of them together 
on a dream court of light, for an elec- 
tronic afternoon of one-on-one. 

It wasn't easy. When 
they talked, we listened. 
When they criticized, 
we made big changes. 
When they gave sug- 
gestions, we took them. 

And it shows. This 
thing is absolutely un- 
canny. You actually 
take on all the skiUs and 
characteristics of Bird 
or The Doctor — their 
own particular moves, 
shooting abilities, even 
strength and speed. 

You'll meet with 
fatigue factors, hot and 
cold streaks, turn- 
around jump shots, 
and 360-degree slam 
dunks. But there's some whimsy in 
here, too — a funny referee, a shattering 
backboard, even instant replay. 

It's called Julius Erving and Larry Bird 
Go One- on- One.™ You're Bird. Or you're 
The Doctor. And that's the last deci- 
sion you'll have plenty of time to make.

THE BASIC 




By Wm.YR. Smith 



This month the Basic Solution presents Ba- 
sicGraph, which uses two subroutines pre- 
sented in earlier Basic Solution articles to create 
a visually appealing pie and bar graph program. 

The subroutines used are the seventy- 
column hi-res character driver {Softalk, No- 
vember 1982) and the circle-drawing routine 
presented a few months ago. Both of these 
routines have been modified slightly to perform 
the desired functions, so the program is pre- 
sented here in its entirety . 

Those of you who have had a chance to see 
Apple's new computer, the Lisa, and its chart- 
ing program, Lisagraph, will recognize Basic- 
Graph's style of presentation. Apple's Lisa is 
an extremely powerful machine. Of course, its 
video display is greatly enhanced over that of 
the Apple IL If BasicGraph gives you some 
feeling of the power of Lisa, then it will have 
accomplished a great deal. 

The first thing regular readers will notice is 
that the remarks statements are greatly reduced 
in BasicGraph. This program makes use of the 
hi-res screen and a fair number of variables to 
do the seventy -column character display. This 
eats up a large amount of the available memory 
in the Apple n. 

The first problem caused by the memory 
limitations was that Applesoft started to store 
variables in the hi-res screen memory, destroy- 
ing the appearance of the BasicGraph display. 
The solution to this problem was quite easy . We 
simply used lomem: 16384 in line 10, which 
starts variable storage above the hi-res memory . 
The program itself stops just short of $2000, the 
beginning of hi-res page one. Adding further 
remarks would put it over the edge. Any part of 
the program that was higher in memory than 
$2000 would be cut off when the hgr command 
was executed. 

The accompanying illustrations show the 
two types of graphing functions available in 
BasicGraph. The pie chart and the bar chart 
sections can use the same data so you can com- 
pare the two different types of graphs. Of 
course, the type of data will usually dictate 
which one you use. Both graph functions will 
graph up to sixteen titles and values. Your in- 
formation can be stored to disk for later 
retrieval. 

The titles and amounts can be edited by 



selecting the appropriate command with the 
blinking cursor and hitting return. You can 
switch between pie graph and bar graph by 
choosing one at drawing time. You can even 
clear the entire display and start again from 
scratch. 

Now let's spend a little time and discuss the 
operation of BasicGraph. After you get the pro- 
gram entered in and type run, the program 
should go to the hi-res screen, draw the Basic- 
Graph screen, and display a blinking bar under 
the edit titles prompt. If you press any key other 
than return, the bar will advance to the next 
prompt. After the fourth prompt, it cycles back 
to the first. By placing the flashing bar under 
any one of the prompts and pressing return, you 
can perform the specified operation. 

Let's begin with edit titles. Place the bar 
under the edit titles line and press return. You 
will be prompted with the number 1 and asked 
to type in the first tide. Type January and press 
return. You will be prompted for the second ti- 
de; type February. Enter all the months through 
June. When you have completed this and you 
are on title number 7, simply press return 
without entering a value and you'll leave the 
edit mode and return to the prompt command 
mode. 

Next, go to the edit values prompt and press 
return. You will then be prompted with the first 
title you typed in and asked for a value. Enter 
any positive values you wish for each of the six 
months. As soon as you have entered the value 
for the last title, you'll be sent back to command 
mode. If you have made any mistakes in enter- 
ing the titles or amounts, you can go back to the 
edit titles or edit values mode. For each piece of 
data, you will be shown the current title or 
value. If it is correct, simply press return. If it is 
incorrect, you can retype it and continue on. 

After you have typed in the proper informa- 
tion, place the bar under the draw graph prompt 
and press return. You will be asked to type 1 for 
a pie chart or 2 for a bar graph. Make your 
selection and watch the chart appear. If you 
wish, you may go back to the draw graph func- 
tion and select the other type of display . 

Now go to the disk I/O section and press re- 
turn. You will be prompted with:

If you select load or save, you will be presented 
with a catalog of the disk and asked to enter a 
file name. If you select clear, the graph and all 
of the data will be erased and the system will 
restart. 

One other feature has been added into the 
edit title system. If you wish to chop off data 
from the end of your list, edit titles and press 
return until you get to the first one to delete. 
Then enter a period and press return. The sys- 
tem will then remove everything beginning with 
the line on which you entered the period. This 
little trick will help you graph smaller sections 
of your data. 

The speed at which the Basic version of 
BasicGraph operates is acceptable but can be 
greatly improved by compiling. For those of 
you who have the SpeedStar compiler from 
Southwestern Data Systems, line 2265 has the 
SpeedStar command to jump the compilation 
around the hi-res screen. The pie chart shown 
takes forty-three seconds to draw in Applesoft 
but only fourteen seconds when the program is 
compiled with SpeedStar. If you have another 
compiler, we'd be interested in hearing how 
much it improves the speed of BasicGraph. 

Note: Lines 2500, 2515, 2930, 3250, 7040, 
9320, and 9410 contain remarks concerning the 
number of spaces between quotes. Do not type 
these remarks in, as they will make the program 
too long, causing it to crash.

HARDEN SOFTWARE 



Runs on the Apple 11, 11 +, 11 e. 



System Saver didn't become the 
Apple's mmiber one sdling 
peripheral by being just a fani 



What made over 100,000 Apple owners fall in 
love with System Saver? The answer is simple. 
It's the most versatile, most convenient, most 
useful peripheral ever made for the Apple. 

System Saver filters out damaging AC line 
noise and power surges. 

70-90% of all microcomputer malfunctions can be 
traced to power line problems* * Problems your 
System Saver guards against. 

Power line noise can often be interpreted as data. 
This confuses your computer and produces system 
errors. Power surges and spikes can cause severe 
damage to your Apple's delicate circuitry and lead 
to costly servicing. 

System Saver clips surges and 
spikes at a 130 Volts RMS/175 
Volts dc level. A PI type filter 
attenuates common and 
transverse mode noise by a 
minimum of 30 dB from 600 
kHz to 20 mHz with a max- 
imum attenuation of 50 dB. 
You end up with an Apple 
that's more accurate, more 
efficient and more reliable. 

SYSTEM SAVER 



System Saver lets your Apple keep its cool. 

Today's advanced peripheral cards generate heat. In 
addition, the cards block any natural air flow through 
the Apple He creating high temperature conditions 
that shorten the life of the Apple and peripheral cards. 

System Saver's efficient, quiet 
fan draws fresh air across 
the mother board, over 
the power supply and 
out the side ventilation 

slots. It leaves your Apple cool, calm and running 

at top speed. 






System Saver makes your Apple more 
convenient to use. 

No more reaching around to the back of your Apple 
to turn it on. No more fumbling for outlets and cords 
to plug m your monitor and printer. System Saver 
organizes all your power needs. 



So if you want to keep 
damaging heat, line noise and power surges out of 
your system for good, pick up the only peripheral 
that's in use every second your computer is in use. 
The System Saver. You'll soon come to think of it as 
the piece Apple forgot. 

Compatible with Apple stand

Personal computers have an unlimited potential for saving us time. 
But they never do. This paradox has now been explained by an amazing 
scientific discovery, which you will read about first right here in 
DOStalk. 

According to Dr. Kathleen O'Connell, a disorder called Computer 
Perseveration Syndrome is responsible for the problem. Dr. O'Connell 
says "perseveration" means the uncontrollable repetition of some activi- 
ty or action. 

Perfection seems like a real possibility to personal computer users, 
according to Dr. O'Connell. Before computers were widely available, 
people would devote as much time to a project as it deserved, she says. 

Now they do a project in no time, but then spend hours repetitively 
refining it. Dr. O'Connell reports that her husband once ran twelve 
drafts of a ten-word letter through his word processor. 

Manifestations of the syndrome are also seen in spreadsheet users 
who fine-tune a template for hours so it will be easy to use next time— 
and never use it again; in folks who spend days creating databases on 
those who sent them Christmas cards but who never have time to send 
Christmas cards themselves; and in programmers who write only pro- 
grams that make it easier to write programs. 

Some researchers think the Computer Perseveration Syndrome is a 
serious problem that must be given utmost consideration by the scientific 
community. Others think it is a sign of approaching nirvana. 

We Join the Thundering Herd. Here at DOStalk the syndrome has 
us by the throats. This month we are using Apple Writer lie for the first 
time. As those of you who already use this word processor know (the 
thousands of you, according to the Softalk bestseller list), it has a 
multitude of enticing features that could easily keep one from ever get- 
ting any real work done. 

Even as this column is being written, more efficient methods of 
operation spring to the author's mind. Using Apple Writer lie's glossary 
function, for example, lets us give all the keys on the keyboard new, 
multikey meanings. We can set up the D key so that, when we push it 
while holding down the open-apple key, it will print "DOStalk." Just a 
minute here. . . . 

DOStalk DOStalk DOStalk DOStalk. See how wonderful this is? 
This month's column may take months to write at the rate we're going 
so far. 

What Kind of File Do Your Words Deserve? One very appealing 
feature of Apple Writer He is that it uses text files. Some other word 
processors, including earlier incarnations of Apple Writer itself, save 
data in binary files. Let's look at the difference. 

Binary files have a B in front of them in DOS 3.3 catalog listings. 
They are nothing more than "snapshots" of your computer's memory. 
When you save a binary file, an exact image of the specified part of the 



computer's memory is stored on your disk. 

In a similar vein, when you write a holiday love letter on a word 
processor, an image of your words warms the bits somewhere in your 
computer's memory. That image throbs as you type on your keyboard. 

Most word processors work along the general pattern of determining 
what key you just pressed, changing the memory image of your docu- 
ment to reflect that keystroke, updating the screen display to reflect the 
new memory image, and returning for another keystroke. 

Your word processor always keeps track of where the image of your 
passion is in memory and how big it is. From a programming standpoint, 
it is very simple to get DOS to save that image in a binary file. Thus, 
that's how many word processors do it. 

Besides being easy on programmers, binary files have one other ad- 
vantage. Uncle DOS can save them and reload them relatively quickly. If 
disk access speed is important to an application, consider word proc- 
essors that use binary files for storage. (Use one of the speed-enhanced 
versions of DOS with it, if possible, to make the bits real- 
ly fly.) 

The problem with binary files is that they are not usually compatible 
with anything else. There are no standards for binary files. If you want to 
run your holiday letter through a spelling checker, for example, you have 
to find one that can read files created by your particular word processor. 

The big advantage of word processors that use text files, on the other 
hand, is compatibility. There are certain standards for text files. If you 
have a word processor that saves your work in text files, you can use it 
for lots and lots of things besides writing love letters, as we shall see later 
in this column (and in even more detail next month). 

Text files are the ones that appear in DOS 3.3 catalogs with a T in 
front of them. One problem with text files is that DOS will deal with 
them only one byte at a time. When your word processor wants to save a 
file, it has to hand the file to Uncle DOS character by character. As you 
can imagine, this is a relatively slow process. 

(But by using direct calls to the file manager, such as those calls 
discussed here last month, a word processor can handle text files at 
binary file speeds. Apple Writer He uses direct calls for saving files but 
sticks with the slower, one-byte-at-a-time technique for loading them.) 

Text File Fundamentals. There are two basic types of text files. One 
type is called random-access and the other is called sequential. There is 
no way to tell by looking at a DOS 3 . 3 catalog which of these two types 
a particular file might be. 

Sequential text files are the kind word processors use. Sequential files 
are ideal for applications that start a session by reading a file from begin- 
ning to end (sequentially) into the computer's memory. Later in the ses- 
sion, a modified version of the entire file may be resaved. This is, of 
course, exactly how a word processor works.

DECEMBER 1983 



Random-access files are used in applications where the user doesn't 
load the entire file into the computer at once, but only a small piece of it. 
Programs that help you keep records, such as an inventory of your com- 
puter magazines, usually use random-access files. 

In a few months we'll talk about random-access files in more detail. 
In the meantime we'll take a close look at sequential files. This month 
we'll open a big investigation of text files by looking at a special kind of 
sequential file— the kind that holds keystrokes. 

You've probably never heard of a keystroke file before. That's 
because we just made them up. (We make stuff up around here all the 
time.) Most discussions of text files, such as those in the DOS manuals, 
explain text files as if they were used only to store inventories and mail- 
ing lists. In fact, one of the most important uses for sequential text files is 
to store keystrokes. 

A keystroke file is a text file that contains keystrokes needed to do 
some task on your computer. A standard image for explaining this con- 
cept is that of the player piano. If sitting at a computer and typing in com- 
mands is like playing a piano, then running a keystroke file through a 
computer is like running the tape through a player piano. 

Exec Exec. You can thank our old friend Uncle DOS for giving your 
Apple the power to press its own keys. We've discussed in previous col- 
umns how DOS intercepts all messages between your programs and your 
keyboard and screen. Whenever a program tries to read the keyboard 
through the standard I/O link. Uncle DOS will know about it. You can 
get him to send the program something from a file rather than something 
from the keyboard by using the exec command. 

The exec command is useful for easily entering frequently used com- 
mand sequences. For example, we all know that the safest way to write 
programs is to keep two or more backup copies of your work. Having 
earlier versions of a program available is a good feeling when you realize 
that the last set of modifications you made did more harm 
than good. Backups also decrease the chances of pure disaster occurring 
when the power company's transformer blows. Few people consistently 
rotate earlier versions when saving their work, however, because the 
commands are so tedious. 

But by using a simple keystroke file and the exec command, you can 
simplify things immensely. If you are working on a program called Egg- 
nog, for instance, sit down at your word processor, create the following 
text file, and save it under the name Backup (if you don't yet have a word 
processor, or if your favorite uses binary files, goto "Apple 11' s Executive 
Editor," by Gary Kessler, Ilnd Grade Chats, in the August 1983 Sof- 
talk. The article describes and lists a free Basic program that allows you 
to create and edit text files); 

DELETE EGGNOG BKUP2 
RENAME EGGNOG. BKUP1, EGGNOG. BKUP2 
RENAME EGGNOG, EGGNOG. BKUP1 
SAVE EGGNOG 

Now, instead of entering save Eggnog when you want to save your 
program, enter exec Backup. The oldest copy of Eggnog will be deleted, 
newer copies will be rotated, and a copy of the current version of the pro- 
gram will be saved— all with a single command. 

Notice that the commands in the Eggnog file look exactly as they 
would if you typed them on your keyboard. There is no need for a 
control-D or a print statement, as there would be inside a Basic program 
(although if you do use control-D the commands will still work, as we'll 
see later). Also notice that the commands must be in capital letters. They 
didn't teach small letters at Dr. Basic's grammar school. 

If your word processor has an option to display the carriage returns in 
a file, use it when creating exec files. In particular, make sure you have 
a return after the last line in the file. If there is no carriage return there, 
the last line won't be executed until you press return on your keyboard. 
By then things are usually a mess. 

The Executive Printer Ribbon. Exec files are also handy for little 
commands that you may not use frequently— but that are hard to remem- 
ber for that very reason. Here is a file we use at DOStalk called 
Boldface. 

PR#1 

PRINT CHR$(27) + "!" 
PR#0 



This little file turns on the boldface feature of an Apple Dot Matrix 
Printer. It's very handy when you need a new printer ribbon but just 
can't break away from the keyboard long enough to buy one. Of course, 
you could write a Basic program that would do the same thing, but using 
an exec file instead has a simple advantage. Exec files don't disturb the 
program you already have in memory. If Boldface was a Basic program, 
it would destroy the program in memory whenever it was used. 

Where Will It All End? Since exec files don't disturb what's in 
memory, you can use them as a sort of external subroutine from within 
programs, but this requires a special trick. This trick is not recommend- 
ed for polished work, but it is handy for quidirware (quick and dirty 
software), particularly if you have a library of useful exec files al- 
ready written. 

Normally, when you try to exec a file from within a Basic program, 
nothing happens. This is because Dr. Basic is running your program 
rather than looking for commands entered on the keyboard. Uncle DOS 
can't pass keystrokes to Dr. Basic unless the good doctor asks for them. 

Dr. Basic will ignore the commands in the exec file, just as he ignores 
commands you type on your keyboard, while a program is running. To 
get him to pay attention, put the command end right after the exec com- 
mand. That may seem drastic at first, but follow along. Dr. Basic sees 
your end command, goes to the keyboard for input, finds your exec file, 
and executes it. To restart your program where it left off, put the virtual- 
ly unknown Applesoft command cont at the end of your exec file. 

Cont will cause execution to continue at the next instruction after the 
end statement. It works exactly like a return from a subroutine, with one 
exception— Basic can't continue if the exec file did something that caused 
an error message. The technique is also useless for modifying the pro- 
gram in memory itself: Adding, deleting, or editing a program line 
renders the continue command powerless. 

Exec files can be linked together, but they can't be nested. This 
means one exec file can start a second one, but there is no command that 
can return to the first one and have it continue where it left off. (You can 
use the exec command with the R parameter to start execution of a file 
somewhere other than the beginning. However, it is quite difficult to en- 
vision situations in which people not under the influence of the Computer 
Perseveration Syndrome would want to do that.) 

Speaking of Execution. . . . There are a few things that you can't do 
from within an exec file, even though it seems like you should be able to. 
For one thing. Integer Basic doesn't allow you to put several commands 
on one line, using the colon, in immediate mode (in deferred mode it 
works fine, of course). If you are writing exec files that you want to use 
from either version of Basic, you have to put each immediate mode com- 
mand on a separate line. 

Another thing you can't do with an exec file is change the number of 
DOS buffers using the maxfiles command. On second thought, that state- 
ment is inexact — you can put a maxfiles command in an exec file and it 
will execute correctly, but your exec file itself will be closed as part of 
the process. Thus an exec file that includes the maxfiles command is 
reminiscent of a trained kamikaze. Its death indicates a success- 
ful mission. 

Belated Halloween Greetings. Maxfiles closes existing exec files 
for good reason. The exec command itself occupies a DOS buffer during 
its execution. When the number of DOS buffers is decreased, the buffer 
occupied by the exec file often disappears. The exec file becomes a ghost 
with all the power of a living, breathing, execing file. Just the idea of a 
phantom exec file terrifies Uncle DOS. 

Those of you who take pleasure in practical jokes might want to take 
advantage of this. Set maxfiles to some number greater than the normal 
three, then exec a file that includes the fp or int commands. You may 
remember from previous columns that these commands reset maxfiles to 
the default value of three. However, they do not turn off an active exec 
file. Consequently, your exec file becomes a phantom and Uncle DOS 
either heads for the hills or sits and shudders. In either case you have to 
turn off your computer to calm the poor man down. 

Another limitation you have when working with exec files is that 
several Basic commands don't work from immediate mode. The most 
important of these are input and get. (If they did work it would be useless 
anyhow, since they would just pick up the next string of characters in 
your exec file.) Like all computer problems, there is a long way around 
this one.

How To Stay Execution. Let's begin with a simple case. Say you 
want an exec file to stop in the middle of execution and wait until you 
give it permission to continue. Maybe you want to put a new envelope in 
your printer or something. Try this: 

PRINT ■■PRESS<ANY KEY>TO CONTINUE." 

FOR 1 = 1 TO 128 : I = PEEK( - 16384) : NEXT : POKE -16368,0 

I=peek (-16384) sets I to the value found in the keyboard soft 
switch (see the May DOStalk if you don't know what that means). Reset- 
ting a for-loop value inside the loop itself like this can get you ten years 
if the Pascal police catch you, so do it with discretion. Until you press a 
key, the value of I will always be less than 128. The for-loop will loop 
forever, or until you press a key. That will set I to something greater than 
128 and break you out of the loop. The final poke resets the keyboard 
soft switch below 128 again. 

Expand this technique a little and you have conditional execution: 

PRINT "ACCEPT MESSAGE FROM ORK?<Y/N>" 

FOR I =1 TO 128 : l = PEEK(- 16384) : NEXT : POKE -16368,0 

IFCHR$(I-1 -128) = "Y" THEN CALL 64246 

In the third line we had to subtract 1 from I because the for-loop in the 
previous statement added 1 to it just before breakout. Then we subtracted 
another 128 because Applesoft doesn't recognize ASCII letter codes 
above 127. 

One subtle effect exec files like these could have if you used them 
from inside a program is jumbling your variables. If your program had 
set I to a special value, for example, it would be scrambled when the 
exec file was done with it. 

Program Processing. So far all our exec file samples have used im- 
mediate mode Basic statements. You can also fill a file up with 
statements that have line numbers. When you exec a file like this, the 
Basic statements are added to your program in memory (overwriting any 
statements with duplicate line numbers). 

The implications of this are astounding. You can write programs on 



your word processor! Use all of your word processor's neat features for 
finding and replacing variable names, for scrolling up and down, and for 
moving things around. 

Save your program into a text file and then exec it into memory. A 
long program will take a while to load using this methfxl, but the power 
of a word processor's editor can make up for this drawback. If you have 
a program that's already half-written and you want to start using this 
technique tonight, here's a little exec file that will turn Basic programs 
into text files. It's a modified version of a program that appears in the 
DOS Programmer's Manual on page 97. 

0 DIM F$(30) : D$ = CHR$(13) + CHR$(4) : INPUT "FILE NAME?"; 
F$ : PRINT D$ + "OPEN" + F$ : PRINT D$ + "DELETE" + F$ : PRINT 
D$ + "OPEN" + F$ : PRINT D$ + "WRITE" + F$ : LIST 1 , ; 
PRINT D$-H "CLOSE" -hF$ : TEXT : END 

RUN 

After creating this file on your word processor, save it. Then load 
your Basic program. Exec the file shown above. 

It will apjjend a complete Basic program (as line 0) to your program 
in memory. Then it will run the little one-liner. 

In response to the "file name?" question, give a name for the new 
text file that will hold your program lines. (If you have an extra return 
following the run command at the end of the exec file, that will be used 
as the file name and we'll die of syntax erroritis. . . . Just one re- 
turn, please.) 

Most readers will easily figure out how the program works. Line 0 
simply opens a text file for writing and lists the program starting at line 
1 . With the file open, a listed program behaves just like any other printed 
text: It goes straight to disk. 

Now you know how to convert a Basic program file into a text file so 
you can edit it in a word processor. And you know how to convert a text 
file back into a Basic program. It is also possible to have a Basic program 
that writes another Basic program and puts it in a text file. The program 
Poker, which comes on the DOS 3.3 Sample Programs disk, is a good

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? 

Are you tired of waiting for DOS to load and save 
files? Are you tired of waiting for DOS to finish so 
you can type again? Are you tired of waiting for 
your printer' When you buy DIVERSI-DOS'", 
by Bill Basham, you won't have to wait any more! 
Here's why: 

1. DOS speed-up: Apple DOS 3.3 takes 18 disk 
revolutions to read a single track, whereas 
DIVERSI-DOS reads or writes a track m just 2 
revolutions. This speeds up file processing 
tremendously (see table). 

2. Keyboard Buffer: DIVERSI-DOS allows you 
to type ahead, as fast as you can, without missing 
a single character. 

3. Print Buffer: DIVERSI-DOS can use a RAM 
card (16K 128K) to temporarily save characters 
before they are printed. Thus, your computer 
won't have to wait for your printer to finish. 

4. DDMOVER: DIVERSI-DOS can now be 

moved to a RAM card to increase the available 
memory in a BASIC program. 

DIVERSI-DOS, the QUADRUPLE utility, 
requires a 48K Apple II, 11+ or //e with DOS 3.3. A 
simple, menu-driven installation program is 
included on the un protected disk. So what are 
you waiting for?

example of this kind of program. Poker is used to capture machine 
language programs for use by Dr. Basic. 

Executive Sophistication. The most sophisticated use of exec files is 
to provide input for programs. For example, the following exec file, 
named Copy Me, will execute the Fid program and copy itself onto 
another disk: 

BRUN FID.DI 

1 

6 

1 

6 

2 

COPY ME 

Q 

9 

You'll notice that this file contains nothing but the command that 
starts up Fid and the keystrokes needed to copy the file. An exec file like 
this one is useful for frequent copying tasks, such as moving files from a 
floppy to a fast RAM-based disk emulator and back. 

This technique can be used with any program that uses the standard 
I/O links for receiving commands. Programs that read the keyboard 
directly can't use this technique. 

Those of you whose eyes are sparkling with the possibilities for 
perseverating with the exec command deserve a small holiday gift. 

The Holiday Exec-Killer. Once you start using exec files you will 
notice one small problem with them. Once you've started one, there is no 
way to stop it. Exec files carry charms that can be broken only with 
industrial-strength formulas. Even the usually all-powerful reset key is 
incapable of killing a runaway exec file. 

The following exec file modifies DOS 3.3 in such a way that you can 
stop reading any text file— exec or normal— by pressing the escape key. 
It works by telling Uncle DOS that the end of the file has been reached. 

When you are using this modification and reading a normal text file, 
pressing escape creates an end of data error (handy when you've just

started to read a text file five miles long and suddenly realize it was the 
wrong one). When an exec file is working, on the other hand, pressing 
escape causes it to die of apparently natural causes. 

The modification works by intercepting Uncle DOS as he is just get- 
ting the next character from a text file. We force him to take a look at the 
keyboard soft switch. If no key or any key other than escape has been 
pressed, we let him continue normally. If, however, somebody pressed 
escape, we'll put a zero in his bucket and send him back whence 
he came. 

Whenever a zero byte is encountered in a text file, Uncle DOS takes 
that to mean there is no more data. Thus, when he gets back and finds a 
zero in his bucket, he thinks he has come to the end of the file and takes 
the appropriate action. 

The point at which we want to intercept Uncle DOS is byte 42544 (in 
hexadecimal, that's $A630). Normally the machine language instruction 
here is JSR $A68C. We'll change that to JSR $BCEF and put our in- 
terception routine at that location. The space at $BCEF is empty in stan- 
dard DOS 3.3. 

Here is the assembly language code we will put at $BCEF:

And here is an exec file, which should be named Exec-Killer, that 
makes the modifications:

PRINT "EXEC-KILLER NOW IN PLACE" 

This exec file could be written in many different ways — this par- 
ticular way was chosen to demonstrate two things. In the first line, we 
test to see if DOS is at its normal 48K location. If it isn't, this file won't 
work. Rather than continuing, the file kills itself by sending DOS a close 
command. Notice that in this case it was necessary to send the command 
to DOS with a print statement and a control-D in the form of CHR$(4), 
since the command did not appear at the beginning of a line. 

Also notice that it is necessary to kill the exec file by name. Using the 
close command without a file name will not close an active exec file. 
This is so that close can be used from within an exec file to close all 
other files. 

The second thing the file demonstrates is the use of the Monitor from 
within an exec file. If you are not familiar with Monitor commands, the 
middle of the file will look like gibberish. But don't worry, it works. 
Those of you who are more familiar with the Monitor may be surprised 
that you can send commands to it from an exec file. 

ProDOS Notes. As mentioned here last month, Apple will release a 
new disk operating system for the Apple II series of computers in 
January. It is called ProDOS. ProDOS includes its own exec command. 
In fact, all of the above exec files work with ProDOS except the last two. 
You can give commands to programs with ProDOS, but you can't give 
them to Fid, because ProDOS and Fid are incompatible. ProDOS has its 
own Fid-type program, called Filer. Exec-Killer was designed to modify 
DOS 3.3 and thus doesn't work with ProDOS. 

That's about it for this month. There should be enough material here 
to keep any good perseverator busy the next thirty days. Isn't it too bad 
Dr. O'Connell didn't call her husband's disorder Computer Persevera- 
tion Mania? Then we could nickname it CPM. Di

TKISolver does for equations 
what word processing did for 

words.'The first thing you should 
know about the TKISolver™ program is 
that it is not a spreodsheet. Instead, it 
does something completely unheard 
of (until now) - it turns your personal 
computer into a voracious equation 
processor. 

The next thing you should know is 
that if the TKISolver program can't 
make life with your personal computer 
easier (and pay for itself), even if you 
use it only 15 minutes a week, you are 
a very rare person. 

And finally, you should know ex- 
actly what equation processing is, 
and how it works. If you keep reading 
this, you will. 

Equation processing with 
TiCISoiver, or problem solving 
made easy. The best way to under- 
stand what the TKISolver program is, 
is to understand what it does. The 
following simple example is designed 
to do just that. If you're still a little in 
the dark after reading it, stop in at 
your local computer store for a very 
enlightening hands-on demonstration. 

Begin by setting up your problem. 
The TKISolver program lets you do it 
quickly, easily, and naturally. For ex- 
ample, o car costs $9785. What would 
be the monthly payment on a three- 
year loan if the down payment is 25% 
and the interest rate is 15%? 
STEP 1. Formulate the necessory 
equations to solve your problem and 
enter them on the "Rule Sheet" simply 



by typing them in (as in the screen 
photo). For example: "price-down = 
loan." 

STEP 2. Enter your known values the 
same way on the "Variable Sheet." For 
example: "9785" for price. You may 
also enter units and comments, if you 
want.* 

STEP 3. Type the action command 
I"!" on your keyboard) to solve the 
problem. 

STEP 4. TKISolver displays the an- 
swer: the monthly payment is $254.40. 
Backsolving, the heart of 
TKISolver. Now that you've defined 



the problem and solved it, TKISolver's 
unique backsolving ability also lets 
you think "backwards" to solve for any 
variable, regardless of its position in i 
the equation. For example, if you con 
only afford a monthly payment of 
$200, you can re-solve the problem in 
terms of that constraint. The TKISolver 
program will solve the problem, dis- 1 
playing your choice of a higher down 
payment, a longer loan term, or a 
lesser interest rate. This unique back- 
solving capability forms the basis of 
TKISolver's remarkably flexible prob- 
lem-solving ability. I 





Also, as you can see from the 
example on the screen, TKlSolver 
deals not only with single variables, 
but with entire equations and sets of 
simultaneous equations. It also deals 
with much more complicated problems 
than this one. How complicated? 
That's up to you. What kinds of prob- 
lems? That's up to you, too, but pop- 
ular applications include finance, 
engineering, science, design, and 
education. 

Other extremely useful and 
Interesting things TKlSolver 
does. Aside from its basic problem- 
solving abilities, the TKlSolver program 
performs a number of pretty fancy 
tricks. Like-. Iterative Solving; in which 
TKlSolver performs successive approx- 
imations of an answer when con- 
fronted with equations that cannot be 
solved directly,! like exp Ix) = 2 - x • y 
and sin (x • y)= 3 - x - yl. Like: List 
Solving; in which TKlSolver attacks 
complete lists of input values and 
solves them all, allowing you to exam- 
ine numerous alternative solutions, and 
pick the one you like best. Like: Tables 
and Graphs; using the values you pro- 
duced with the List Solver, the TKlSolver 
program will automatically produce ta- 
bles and graphs of your data. You con 
look at your formatted output on the 
screen or send it to your printer with 
o single keystroke. And like: Automatic 



Unit Conversion; in which TKlSolver 
lets you formulate problems in one unit 
of measurement, and display answers 
in another. Very convenient what with 
all this talk about going metric. 

The TKlSolver program also pro- 
vides a wide variety of specialized 
business and mathematical functions 
like trig and log and net present 
value. 

Then, there's TKISolver's on-screen 
hfelp facility that provides information 
on commands and features any time 
you want it. Just type "?" and a topic 
name. 

And of course the TKlSolver pro- 
gram combines all these features in 
one integrated program.

DECEMBER 1983 



133 



The Christmas season is an exciting time because some really nice 
printers, add-on gadgets, interface cards, and other goodies may sudden- 
ly come tantalizingly within reach. Curiously enough, it seems that no 
matter how slick a new printer or add-on device is, it cannot overcome 
two chronic problems in this portion of the personal computer industry: 
poorly written user manuals and word processor programs that won't let 
you exploit the full potential of your printer. 

Word processor developers, this Christmas wish list is aimed at you: 
Don 't give us a hard time about using our printers. A classic example is 
the old version of Super-Text, which allows the user to enter only six 
control codes. This effectively cuts out at least ten other functions that 



You won't believe what Micromax has done for a printer interface 
card. First, they made it Grappler-compatible, but they didn't stop there. 
Their card (the Graphmax) supports color printing, zoom magnification, 
picture cropping, and can capture text to be used for headings, footings, 
and page numbering (no software needed). Four dip switches allow it to 
be quickly configured for just about any printer. Oh yes, a full two-year 
parts and labor warranty is also included. A real bargain at $149.95 
($169.95 for color and zoom options). 

The moral of the story is that if you manufacture printer-related 
devices or software for the Apple and have a class act, we'll be happy to 
review your product and evaluate it honestly for Softalk'i, readers.

Boxing the Bugaboos 



most printers are capable of performing. The other weakness in Super- 
Text and many other word processors is that printer command codes take 
up space on a printed line. For example, if you try to print out a line that 
contains the escape-E and the escape-F to turn emphasis on and off, you 
will find that the line ends prematurely, with a gap of four blanks (one 
blank for each printer command character) at the right edge— rather lame 
when you consider that word processors are made to work with printers. 
Developers, if you spent as much time developing software that allowed 
easy entry of printed command codes as you do inventing editing com- 
mands, the world would beat a path to your door to buy your product. 

One way for a user to avoid this difficulty with word processors is to 
get a demonstration of how easy (or hard) it is to use the program with a 
printer before purchasing it. Here are three key things to look for when 
examining a word processor: 

1 . Does the word processor allow only a limited number of preset (or 
user-definable) printer command codes? If so, you'd better think twice 
before purchasing it. You could be buying a lot of limitations. 

2. Does the word processor's printed output have gaps in the right 
edge of justified text that contains printer command codes? Nice, if you 
like a shabby appearance. 

3. Does the word processor refuse to allow you to enter certain 
necessary (and almost universal) printer command codes, such as escape 
and the control characters in the ASCII range 0 through 31? 

If enough people refuse to buy the real dogs of the industry, upgrades 
will be right around the comer. 

There are, of course, printer and printer-peripheral manufacturers 
who take pride in their work and make things easy on users. We'll be 
reviewing some of their products here and making recommendations. 
Hint: One hardware firm to keep your eye on is Micromax, which 
manufactures cards that are compatible with the popular industry stan- 
dards, adding extra features and bringing the price down— a tough act to 
follow. 



When this column began in October, we mentioned that there were 
five main categories of common questions and problems with the Epson. 
As a review, here they are again. 

1. Printer hardware. This includes the paper-out condition, tractor 
feeding, sheet feeding, care and feeding of the ribbon, maintenance tips, 
and switch settings. 

2. Printing from program control. This covers using printer functions 
from Applesoft, Pascal, assembly language, CP/M, and so on. 

3. Printing from word processor control. This includes commercial 
programs that reduce your ability to control the printer directly. 

4. Printer interface cards. This covers the mysterious MSB (most 
significant bit, bit 7, also called the eighth bit or high bit) and the ins and 
outs of sending characters to the printer. 

5. Graphics. This covers hi-res, lo-res, and text screen dumps, as 
well as more exotic things such as strip chart recording, artwork, and 
just plain doodling. 

Last month, we touched on some of the basics of printing from pro- 
gram control. This time, we'll go into this topic in more depth, covering 
how to print from the three most used languages on the Apple: Ap- 
plesoft, Pascal, and 6502 assembly language. Suppose we need to write 
the text shown in figure 1, which uses emphasis and italics. Let's begin 
with an Applesoft program that will print the sample text. See listing 1 . 

The program is pretty straightforward, except for two things that can 
really give you fits: control-I"80N" and pr#l. Such little things that can 
go wrong with printing will be set aside in a "bugaboo box" (figure 2). 

Water Ouzel (oo'-zel). Any of several plump, thick-plumaged, aquatic 
birds of the family CInclidae, allied to the thrushes, esp. Cinclus 
aquaticus of Europe and C. mexicanus of western North Ameri- 
ca, having the habit of jerking the body or "dipping" as they 
perch, walk, etc.; a dipper.

Listing 1. Applesoft program using the Epson printer. 



As we fill up the box, you can refer to it to see why your printer program 
is not working — and how to fix it. 

Listing 2 shows an example of how to generate the text with a 6502 
assembly language program. 

The algorithm used in the 6502 version is fairly simple: Reset the out- 
put hooks (CSW) to point toward slot 1 (where your printer interface 
card is assumed to be) and send each character to be printed through the 
standard Apple character output routine, COUT. Any special printer 
codes are blended right in with the rest of the text to be printed and sent 
to the printer. When the program is finished printing, it just resets the 
CSW character output hooks back to the normal setting of COUTl (the 
video screen). Here we have two more things to add to our bugaboo box. 

Finally, listing 3 shows how we would print out our "Water Ouzel" 
message from a Pascal program. Pascal tends to be a little fussy as to 
how you tell it to work with a printer; this is complicated by the fact that 



1. Control-I "SON" is almost universally misused and misunder- 
stood. It is Intended to be used on/y for listing Applesoft programs. All 
sorts of inexplicable printing problems can pop up if you blindly use 
this command in your programs. To explain further, the control-l is a 
command to alert your printer interface card that a command is com- 
ing for it to interpret. This is similar to the way that control-D is used to 
alert DOS that a DOS command is coming. 

The "80" refers to a column width of eighty columns for an Ap- 
plesoft program listing only. It is not intended to be used for any other 
type of printing. The "N" tells the pnnter interface card not to echo, or 
send to the video screen, characters sent to the printer. This is useful 
for preventing scrolling during a screen dump. The command does 
have a place, however; its proper use is for turning off the screen 
echo (which can clear up a host of seemingly unrelated problems) 
and should read, control-l "N" (no "80"). Control-I "1" will turn the 
screen echo back on. From Applesoft, control-l is printed as CHR$(9), 
as shown in line 290. 

2. Pr#1 will temporarily disconnect DOS, preventing you from issu- 
ing DOS commands within your program such as PRINT CHR$(4) 
"OPEN FILE1." PRINT CHR$(4)"PR#1 " will keep DOS connected 
but will disconnect any other program you may have had running 
(such as GPLE or GALE) before you ran yours. PR#1 : CALL 1002 
does the same thing as PRINT CHR$(4)"PR#1 " but does not 
generate a< CR > and will not spoil a screen dump. "You pays your 
money and you takes your chances." 

3. When you're working from a machine code level and you need 
to send the Epson an escape via COUT, you must either make sure 
the high bit is on in the escape character (that is, send $98 and not 
$18), or make sure that the screen echo is turned off. This will keep 
the Apple from recognizing and intercepting the escape character. 

4. If you change either the input (KSW) or output (CSW) hooks 
from a higher-level language, DOS will change them right back again 
with the very next character input or output. You can force DOS to 
permanently accept the change with a call 1002 or a JSR $3EA. If 
you're working from the machine level and you're careful, it isn't 
necessary to do a JSR $3EA. This will leave a utility like PLE or GALE 
still connected when you exit your machine code routine. 



there are few books that really cover this topic well. Basically, there are 
three things you must do when you want to use Pascal to send text to a 
printer: 

1. Declare a (global) printer identifier of type INTERACTIVE: 
VAR PRINTER: INTERACTIVE; 

2. Assign the physical printer device to the identifier: 
REWRITE(PRINTER: 'PRINTER:'); 

3. Use the identifier as the first field in any Writeln statement that you 
want to use for printer output: 

WRITELN(PRINTER,'THIS WILL GO TO THE PRINTER AND NOT 
THE SCREEN'); 

The following sample programs are just that: samples. There are prob- 
ably as many ways to print out text on a printer from those languages as 
there are programmers. There are also faster, more concise, and more 
elegant ways of doing the job. If you have such a method, send it in and 
share it with our readers.

Next month, we'll skip ahead to printer interface cards and talk about 
the mysterious eighth bit that gives everyone so many problems. In the 
meantime, if you have any questions, or if you have discovered any real- 
ly nifty ways of overcoming limitations with your favorite word proc- 
essor, send them in so that we can finally get them collected into one 
place for everyone to share.

A Programming Course For Beginners 



what is the best way to learn 
how to use an APPLE* com- 
puter? 

You could enroll in a class — 
arranged at someone else's con- 
venience, given by a technician 
who may not be a very good 
teacher. Or you could read a 
book — written by a program- 
mer who may not be a very 
good writer. Or you could learn 
in your own home, on your own 
APPLE®, at your own conven- 
ience, using the course that has 
become a standard of the indus- 
try. 

Introducing 

THE NEW STEP BY STEP, 

a programming course for 

beginners 

In 1978, PDI introduced the 
original Step by Step. The stu- 
dent learned by interacting 
with his or her computer. Thou- 
sands of students learned how 
to use an APPLE® computer 
and the Applesoft® language 
with Step by Step. Now, using 
feedback from students, 
teachers and learning special- 
ists, we are introducing The 
New Step by Step. 

The New Step by Step, in 
addition to sound and effective 
teaching, includes computer 
graphics, animation, sound 
effects and a voice track. 

How does 

THE NEW STEP BY STEP 
woric? 

The computer program 
shows screen displays 
or sample program 
outputs, while the 
audio cassette explains 
to the student what is 
being shown. After each 
instructional segment, 
the student is asked a 
question or asked to solve 
a problem. The computer 
checks the student's work. 

When a lesson has been com- 
pleted, the student turns off the 
cassette and goes to the Step by 
Step Workbook to review and 




practice the material covered in 
the lesson. After the practice as- 
signment has been completed, 
the student takes a quiz. 

A final exam is included. 

What does 

THE NEW STEP BY STEP teach? 

There are about twenty hours 
of instruction. Topics covered 
include: 

• PRINT instruction 

• Writing simple programs 




INPUT 
Loops GOTO 
IF-THEN 

Program counters 

Library functions such as 
INT and RND 

Screen formatting, including 
TAB, VTAB and HTAB 

Subroutines 

READ-DATA statements 
FOR-NEXT loops 
One-dimensional arrays 
Nested loops 
Low-resolution graphics 
Multiple-statement lines 
Program logic 
Floating point notation 



How can 

THE NEW STEP BY STEP 
be used? 

Schools can use Step by Step for 
individualized instruction in 
programming in BASIC and in 
computer literacy programs. 

Families can use Step by Step to 
ensure that all family members 
can use the family computer. 

Businesses can use Step by Step 
to train their personnel. 

APPLE® dealers can use Step by 
Step to introduce prospective 
customers to the APPLE® 
computer. 

Step by Step Two, which 
teaches intermediate 
^''^SIC programming is 
'{^^ available for 



,to; mi 

^V^p7 programmers who have 
"^"^■"^r^^X- completed The New Step 
by Step. 



Both programs are 
nj,,^ available at retail 
,r outlets or from PDI for

One of the most powerful DOS commands is 
init. When used with a proper file name, it will 
rarely result in error. Load will make sure a 
Basic program's name follows it, brun will look 
for a binary program's name before proceeding, 
and exec won't do anything unless it's followed 
by the name of a text file. If any of the file name 
conditions aren't met, these commands will just 
result in an error message. 

Init, however, doesn't care what follows; it 
barges ahead with the initialization procedure, 
destroying everything in its path to make way 
for new files. The Trans Am of DOS com- 
mands. If you accidentally type init hllo, init 
text file, or init followed by anything that passes 
as a file name, DOS will initialize the disk that 
is in the drive, regardless of what you meant to 
type. The only thing that can stand in the way of 
init is a write-protect tab on the disk. 

When we initialized our first blank disk, we 
created a slave disk. It's called that because it is 
a slave to whatever system it was initialized on. 
Confused? Read on. 

Booting the System Master disk loads DOS 
into the highest area of memory possible on the 
system you're using. Think of RAM as a very 
tall building. When you boot a master disk, 
DOS knows that it's supposed to go to the high- 
est floor; it gets on the elevator, pushes the but- 
ton for the top floor, and goes there. Once it's 
there, it makes a note of where it is (which 
floor). 

For the sake of simplicity, let's say each 
floor in the building is the equivalent of IK. If 
we're using a 16K Apple, a master disk will 
send DOS to the sixteenth floor to begin filling 
in the top ten floors (DOS takes just over lOK of 
memory). 

Now let's say we want to initialize a disk on 
this 16K system. We put in the new disk, type 
init hello, and thirty seconds later we have a for- 
matted disk. It looks and functions like the 
master disk in all but one respect. When you 
boot this new disk, DOS doesn't automatically 
load itself in the highest memory location avail- 
able; it loads into where DOS was when it was 



initialized. In this case, the top 10. 5K of 16K 
RAM. 

That's why initialized disks are called slave 
disks; where DOS goes when the disk is booted 
depends entirely on the memory size of the 
computer it was initialized on. Because the 
master disk put DOS at the top of a 16K mem- 
ory, the slave disk will put DOS there whenever 
it is booted, regardless of the size of memory. 
In other words, if you boot this slave disk on a 
48K Apple, the disk will still tell DOS to go to 
the sixteenth floor and begin filling in from 
there. That leaves 32K above DOS unused. 

In short, slave disks aren't too smart when it 
comes to loading DOS. Whatever size memory 
the Apple had when the slave disk was initial- 
ized is the size memory that it assumes the com- 
puter has when you boot the disk. A slave disk 
formatted on a 32K Apple will always assume 
it's being booted on a 32K system. On a 48K 
Apple, that means some memory will be 
wasted. A disk initialized on a 48K Apple won't 
boot on a 16K Apple. Not yet. 

Emancipation Proclamation. Slave disks 
need not remain slaves for all eternity. A disk 
that is to be used for nothing but data storage 
will probably never be booted, so it doesn't 
matter where it wants to load DOS. But if 
you're storing programs on a disk that you plan 
to boot now and then, you might want it to 
behave like a master disk, loading DOS to the 
highest memory address possible. 

On the System Master disk, there is a pro- 
gram called Master Create, which frees slave 
disks and allows them to become master disks. 
Running Master Create is simple. Just brun it 
and follow the directions as you go along. 

Once Master Create is loaded, remove the 
System Master disk and insert the disk you wish 
to update. When you're asked for the greeting 
program name, type in the name of the slave 
disk's current greeting program. Master Create 
doesn't create or save a greeting program for 
you as init does; it just lets DOS know what 
name to look for when it boots. Now just hit 
return, and when the disk stops spinning you'll 



have a master disk. 

Over the past few months we've been learn- 
ing, talking about, and using DOS commands. 
Since there's no such thing as a perfect world, 
we'll very likely encounter errors now and 
then. How to deal with errors deserves just as 
much attention as how to do things right. 

Tactless Apple. One of the great things 
about computers is that, if you're wrong, they'll 
let you know it. Unlike your work supervisor or

teacher at school, the computer tells you in no 
uncertain terms when you've made a mistake. 

Mr. Kindheart at work might remark, "Say, 
Cromwell, do you think you could look over 
these figures once more. I know you probably 
have them correct, but they don't seem to match 
the financial reports we received last month. 
Maybe the reports are off. Well, check it out 
anyway. Thanks." Miss Bardlove, the English 
teacher, would similarly request that you reread 
the second act of Macbeth. "Your comparisons 
and contrasts between Lady Macbeth and Mr. T 
are close but still not quite correct." 

The Apple, when it encounters something 
that doesn't quite match its expectations, will 
usually beep rudely and fling an error message 
your way. This would be comparable to Miss 
Bardlove's or Mr. Kindheart's finding a 
mistake and hurling your work back at you 
screaming, "Wrong!" 

Indeed, it seems rude for the Apple just to 
beep loudly and tell you what you're doing 
wrong, but that's a lot better than having it tell 
you what it thinks of you, too. Thank goodness 
computers don't have emotions. Well, at least 
they don't exhibit them. Yet. 

Sticks and Stones. Error messages are 
perhaps the most degrading thing a computer 
can spit at us, since they do little more than 
reinforce our beliefs that computers are infalli- 
ble and that it was we who caused the error, not 
it. Computers are far from infallible, but when 
we consider that a computer performs 
thousands of operations a second, adding up to 
tens of millions of operations per hour, we 



realize that one error in a working day is close 
to one in a billion. Not too shabby. 

Computer errors can result from power 
surges in the electricity, static inside the com- 
puter, moisture in the air, faulty chips, and 
everything in between. Problems like these are 
best handled by professionals. The errors we're 
going to look into are those created by us, the 
lowly humans. 

The two main kinds of error messages we 
usually see are those relating to Basic and those 
relating to DOS. Since error messages from 
Basic are usually seen by programmers, we'll 
put those aside and concentrate on those seen 
more often by users of programs— DOS errors. 

Broken down to their simplest elements, er- 
rors are usually the result of a communication 
problem between the person and the computer. 
If you type catalogg, it's obvious that you 
meant to type catalog, but the computer doesn't 
know that. It's as though a nightclub entertainer 
greeted the audience with, "Heaving heavy 
bodies!" and the audience thought he was talk- 
ing about martial arts (not an appropriate greet- 
ing), when in truth the entertainer had nasal 
congestion and was trying to say, "Evening, 
everybody ! ' ' 

Another example would be the always popu- 
lar typo, pr#65. We know it means prff6 
(oops!), but the Apple thinks you really meant 
to activate slot 65. As a result, it yells at you 
and gives you a range error. 

Introducing the Cast. What follows is the 
Apple's inexhaustible stock of DOS error 
messages and what they mean. Only in a perfect 



world (never making a typo, never having a bad 
disk, and never having your favorite show pre- 
empted) could someone operate an Apple and 
never run into some of these. Here's what they 
mean and how to take care of them. 

Language not available. The language you 
need to execute your command isn't in 
memory. The commands jp, int, run, and load 
look for a version of Basic. Typing^ from In- 
teger or int from Applesoft is an attempt to 
switch to the version of Basic you're not using. 
Typing load filename or run filename, where 
filename is a program written in the version of 
Basic you don't have, also throws this error 
at you. 

This error simply tells you that you have on- ' 
ly one version of Basic in memory. If you have 
a 48K Apple with either Applesoft or Integer 
Basic built into it, you can get the alternate 
Basic (the one you don't have) by plugging in an 
Integer or Applesoft ROM card into slot 1 or by 
adding a language card (RAM card) to your sys- 
tem. The ROM card gives you the other Basic 
and nothing else; a RAM card will provide you 
with an additional 16K or more to do with as 
you please. Simply adding the RAM card to 
your system won't give you the alternate Basic; 
the alternate Basic must be loaded into the RAM 
card from a disk, usually the System Master. 

Range error. A number you typed was too 
large. The Apple can handle numbers with as 
many as thirty-nine places in front of the deci- 
mal point (although numbers this large will be 
printed in scientific notation). However, it han- 
dles them in context. When it sees load hello, d, 
it expects to see either a 1 or a 2 after the d, in- 
dicating which drive you want to load the file 
from. In this case, any number higher than 2 
will result in a range error because DOS doesn't 
recognize more than two disk drives on a one- 
disk controller card. 

But if you typed load hello, s, it will accept 
numbers higher than 2 because when it sees 
load hello, s it knows that s refers to a slot 
number, which can be anywhere from 0 to 7. 
So, whenever you're slapped with a range er- 
ror, check for typing mistakes and try again. 

Write protected. Aha— caught by your own i 
precautions! DOS tried to write, save, delete, or 
otherwise alter something on the disk but was 
unable to do so because the disk is protected 
against changes. 

The cause of this is a write-protect tab (in 
layman's terms: a little sticker that covers the 
small notch on the side of the disk) on your 
disk. When you insert a disk into the drive, it 
depresses a small switch located just inside the 
drive; you can feel it and hear it click as you in- 
sert the disk. Once the disk is in position, the 
switch will pop up into the notch. 

In this "up" position, the switch tells the 
drive that it's okay to change things on the disk 
presently in the drive. For that reason, the notch 
in the disk is called a write-enable notch. We 
can protect valuable information (data files, im- 
portant programs) by placing a write-protect tab 
over that notch. Now, when the disk is in place, 
the switch won't be able to pop up into the gap. 
In this "down" position, it tells the drive not to 
mess around with data on the disk. 

Experienced users of write-protect tabs will 
testify that it's dam near impossible to get tabs

to stay on disks. Hasty insertion or removal ot 
disks tends to snag tabs on the disk drive, some- 
times pulling them off. We have found that a 
better way to write-protect disks is to use Scotch 
tape instead of the conventional tabs that come 
with a box of disks. 

Software publishers often package their pro- 
grams with write-protect tabs on them or with 
no write-enable notch cut in the first place. It's 
best not to store files on a program master disk. 
Even if you use a separate disk for storing data 
created by the program, you can still init the 
disk accidentally. The tab prevents this. In any 
case, if a disk has a tab on it, it was probably put 
there for a good reason, so think twice before 
removing it. 

File not found. DOS can't find the file you 
specified. Either the file isn't on disk, or you 
misspelled it. Remember, the computer takes 
everything in a literal way. Typing run Geo- 
metric Function Programm will cause DOS to 
look for a program spelled exactly that way, 
even if the file is actually spelled with one m in 
Program. Check your typing to make sure you 
spelled it right. If you did, then check the cata- 
log to see how it's spelled there. 

Volume mismatch. It's rare to run into this 
message; it just means that the volume number 
specified in the command doesn't match the vol- 
ume number of the disk in the drive. 

In the disk initialization process, it's option- 
al to specify a volume number. Volume doesn't 
refer to the amount of information but rather to 
the volume number, as in a book volume, or a 
volume of an encyclopedia. In other words, giv- 
ing a disk a volume number is almost like put- 
ting a label on it. Volume numbers are assigned 
in the init process; init hello, vlOO, for exam- 
ple, initializes a disk with 100 as the volume 
number. When you catalog this disk, it will say 
disk volume 100 at the top of the catalog. 

Disk volumes are assigned when you want to 
make sure that certain files go only on certain 
disks. Typing save filename, vlOO will result in 
a volume mismatch error if the disk's volume 
number is anything other than 100. 

I/O error. The catchall of DOS error mes- 
sages, I/O stands for input/output. When DOS 
is unable to read from or write to a disk for any 
reason, this is what it tells you. Most of the 
time, it means that the disk drive door is open or 
the disk's format doesn't match the current 
DOS you have in memory. An Apple running 
DOS 3.3 can't handle a disk that is formatted in 
CP/M, Pascal, DOS 3.2, or any operating sys- 
tem other than DOS 3.3. 

Since this is perhaps the most aggravating 
and potentially disastrous error to encounter, 
we'U discuss how to handle it at the end of this 
column. 

Disk fiill. Hmm . . . your eyes are bigger 
than the disk's stomach. The disk fiall message 
doesn't always mean the disk is full. We found 
out last month how the disk might think it's full 
when it still has room left. This message is tell- 
ing you that DOS can't find any place on the 
disk to put data. There are several possible 
reasons. 

The first is that all the disk's sectors are 
used. Fine. Get another disk. 

The next is that DOS thinks all sectors are 
being used when they really aren't. This can 



happen when a file is edited to a smaller version 
and saved under the same name. Even though 
it's a smaller file, it occupies the same number 
of sectors, leaving some of them unused; these 
unused sectors are off limits to other files. All 
this was covered last month. 

Another possibility for a disk full error is 
that there are no more places on the catalog for 
file names. The catalog can hold only 105 file 
names, so it's entirely possible that those slots 
can get taken before all sectors on a disk are oc- 
cupied. In this case, you can delete some files 
that you don't need, each of which frees not on- 
ly its sectors but its spot on the catalog as well. 

File locked. 'Nuff said? The file you want to 
change has been locked; you can see this by the 
asterisk by its name on the catalog. The reverse 
command of lock is unlock; unlock filename 
works wonderfully. 

Syntax error. Don't panic; though it sounds 
like DOS is telling you that you don't know 
what you're talking about, this message just 
means you probably made a typo. Don't con- 
fuse this with Applesoft's ?syntax error or In- 
teger's ***syntax error, the DOS version of this 
popular message has no question mark or 
asterisks in front of it. 

Once DOS recognizes one of its commands, 
it will attempt to carry it out. But if it en- 
counters something that doesn't go with the 
command, the result will be this error. Typing 
catalogg, for instance, will get you a syntax er- 
ror; DOS recognizes the first seven letters of 
catalogg, but the extra g fouls things up. 

In short, check your spelling and try again. 

No buffers available. Simple: You're out of 
buffers. A buffer is an area of memory that is 
set aside to hold things (data, keyboard input) 
until the Apple or DOS is ready to transfer them 
elsewhere. To illustrate, the save command 
takes the contents of memory and feeds them 
into a buffer. When the buffer is full, all of its 
contents are then sent to disk; the save com- 
mand stores things on disk a bufferfiil at a time. 

Now that we understand what a buffer is, 
let's get back to the error message. DOS com- 
mands require that there be at least one empty 
buffer in order for them to be executed. If a pro- 
gram you just finished rurming has opened and 
was using all the buffers for text files, then the 
no buffers error will result when you try to issue 
a DOS command. 

The same thing happens if a program you're 
writing tries to open another text file when all 
the buffers are being used. Those familiar with 
Basic can use the close command to free a buff- 
er or the maxfiles command to increase the 
number of buffers available; sixteen is the max- 
imum number of buffers for maxfiles. 

Unless otherwise specified, the Apple sets 
maxfiles to three. So if you ever break out of a 
program and all your DOS commands are met 
with no buffers available, increasing maxfiles 
can usually get DOS commands through. Sim- 
ply typing maxfiles 4 (or any number up to six- 
teen) will free some buffer space for DOS com- 
mands to use. 

Clearing the Apple's memory also frees 
buffers; jp or int is a lot faster, but whatever 
Basic program is in memory will be deleted. 

File type mismatch. This means the com- 
mand doesn't go with the type of file (Ap- 



143 

plesoft, Integer, binary, or text) that was speci- 
fied. For example, you can't blood a Basic flic 
and you can't run a text file. All this message 
says is that the verb (DOS command; doesn't 
match the noun (file name). It's like saying, 
"Pour me a car" or "Drive the beer." Catalog 
the disk to make sure of the file type if you're 
not sure. 

Program too large. The DOS command 
tried to load a file from disk, but there's not 
enough space in memory for the entire file. Is- 
suing either an fp or int command will clear 
memory, making way for your disk file. You 
can also use the maxfiles command to decrease 
the number of buffers that are available; this 
opens more memory space for Basic's use. 

Sometimes a program that was previously in 
memory has set himem or lomem values that 
prevent you from loading your file. Himem and 
lomem are Basic statements that set barriers 
marking the highest and lowest memory ad- 
dresses available to you. Street barricades 
would be a good way to think of himem and 
lomem; they're temporary markers that tell you 
where you can or cannot go, depending on 
what's happening on the other side. 

For instance, himem is usually set right 
below DOS, making sure you don't put infor- 
mation where DOS is, thus damaging or alter- 
ing it. This is like marking off streets with 
wooden barricades to prevent cars from ac- 
cidentally driving through a parade route or a 
marathon race. 

It's best to let programmers reset himem or 
lomem by typing at the keyboard. For begin-

ners, it's easier just to reboot the system. 

Not direct command. Trying to execute an 
append, open, position, read, or write com- 
mand from the keyboard will result in this error 
message. These commands can be executed on- 
ly from within a program, so let's not worry too 
much about them. 

Do Your Part. We have seen that most of 
these errors can be easily corrected. However, 
one DOS error that creates a lot of confusion 
and general hysteria among beginners is the I/O 
error message. It seems that when DOS can't 
figure out what's going wrong, it will tell you 
that an I/O (input/output) error has occurred. 

As we said earlier, I/O error just means that 
for various reasons DOS is unable to read or 



write on the disk. DOS is no lazy creature. 
When you issue a save command, for example, 
DOS does its best to save the information you 
have in memory; if it's unable to do so the first 
time, it tries again. And again. And again. In 
fact, it attempts to carry out your command 
ninety-six times before it gives up. When was 
the last time you tried to do something ninety- 
six times with no success? As a wise man once 
said, "If at first you don't succeed, try again. If 
you still don't succeed, give up. No sense in 
making a damn fool of yourself over it."* 

DOS isn't like that. Ninety-six tries is a lot 
of times to try something, just to conclude that 
it's impossible. Here's where we have to work

together with DOS— it needs our help. 

One reason for DOS's problems in reading 
from disk might be that some sectors on the disk 
are damaged. We learned last month some of 
the ways disks become injured: magnetic fields, 
extreme heat or cold, fingerprints, dust par- 
ticles, spilled orange soda, or being set on fire. 
Bad sectors are the most aggravating causes of 
I/O errors because they require delicate disk 
surgery, which usually can be performed only 
by computer experts armed with disk utility 
programs (computer versions of brain scan and 
X-ray machines). 

A popular tool for fixing up disks that seem 
beyond hope is Bag of Tricks, from Quality 
Software. This little wonder lets you look at 
disks sector by sector and repair damage that 
seems impossible to repair, thus restoring one's 
faith in an almighty being. 

I/O errors received when you try to write to 
disk usually occur because DOS is trying to 
write on a part of the disk that is damaged; it's 
sort of like trying to write on wet paper. The 
best thing to do in this case is to remove the 
disk, pop in another initialized disk, and save 
your file on it. Once you've done this, it would 
be a good idea to salvage whatever other files 
you had on the bad disk by using Fid to copy 
them to another disk. 

Most of the time, a few bad sectors won't 
spoil a whole disk. That is, you can usually 
reinitialize the disk and use it over again. If the 
damaged sectors are the result of some unob- 
servable villain like magnets or heat (they 
usually are), reinitializing the disk will set 
everything right. But if the damage was caused 
by excessive disk wear (a rare occurrence), then 
it's best to write the disk off as having lived a 
good and useful life. 

Damaged disk sectors don't always give you 
I/O error messages. If the damage has occurred 
where DOS lives (tracks 0 through 2), the 
results will vary. Sometimes the disk will refuse 
to boot; sometimes it will boot but behave in an 
odd manner when you issue DOS commands. 
When this happens, the best thing to do is 
rescue the files from the disk by copying them 
to another disk via Fid. 

Copying one file at a time can be pretty 
time-consuming. Another way to save the disk 
is to brun the Master Create program to put a 
new DOS image on the damaged disk. After 
that, you can copy the entire disk with CopyA. 

Pleasant Dreams. It should now be easier to 
sleep at night, knowing how to handle DOS 
when it spits error messages at you. Computers 
aren't so frightening when we realize that what 
we often interpret as hostility and aloofness 
from the computer is nothing more than its own 
infantile way of communicating. 

Infantile? You bet. Though microcomputers 
are sophisticated pieces of machinery, they are i 
still barely in the developmental stages, far I 
from where we'd like them to be. When it 
comes to communication between people and 
computers, the computer is very much like a 
young child. It knows only what it has been 
taught and has no consideration for other peo- 
ple's feelings; when it doesn't understand 
something, it lets us know in a direct, uncom- 
promising way. 

Patience, patience. 3i 



A teacher 
for the Apple 

Meet Lee McFadden, your personal guide to 
the Apple //e. SoJ'lalk Magazine has 
praised Lee's audio cassette tapes as "a 
superior way to learn about an Apple." And 
Apple itself chose them to train its own 
field sales reps. 

The reason? FlipT rack's carefully 
sequenced cassette lessons let you learn in 
the most natural way possible — by sitting 
down with a knowledgeable friend. Even if 
you have never touched a computer, in just 
3 step-by-step sessions you will learn to: 

• Use each special key and essential 

command 

• Load and run programs 

• Save programs and data 

• Copy programs and diskettes 

• Protect and modify programs 

• And much more! 

In short, you will be able to use existing 
programs with confidence, as you enter 
your own data, organize your files and 
understand the principles of what you and 
your computer can do. If you later decide to 
take up programming, you'll have the solid 
background necessary. 

A Proven Teaching Approach 

With interactive FlipT rack cassettes, you 
learn by doing. No reading required. You 
learn at your own convenience, at your own 
pace, on your own computer — like having a 
personal tutor "talk you through" each 
procedure.

Last month we looked at some of the statistics that technical investors 
can obtain from Barron 's Market Laboratory. This month we'll examine 
a few more. But before we do, a reminder: No matter how good the in- 
vestment technique, the stock, the bond, or the company, investing is 
still a game of chance. Some investors succeed at this game, but there are 
many who don't. Therefore, whatever money you've invested or are 
thinking of investing should be money you can afford to lose. 

Perhaps an example will illustrate this point. Two months ago, we 
stated in this colunm that a company's growth signifies its health. That's 
a fine rule of thumb, but when you consider the recent bankruptcy of 
Osborne Computer, a company that was growing at a fantastic rate, it 
doesn't always seem to apply. For our purposes, how the company 
wound up in such a state is not the issue; the lesson to be learned is that 
everything can be right and still go wrong. Remember that, and you'll 
probably do well with your investments. 

More Market Laboratory. The various market diaries in Barron 's 
Market Laboratory are important sources of volume statistics for the 
technician. Figure 1 shows the NYSE common stock diary and the 
NYSE composite diary. The difference between these two tables is that 
the composite diary contains preferred stocks, while the stock diary 
does not.

Figure 1. 



Why does Barron 's break out the preferred stocks? Because preferred 
stocks are interest-rate sensitive, behaving just like bonds in many cases. 
As discussed last month, the bond market's behavior is normally a har- 
binger of how the equity, or stock market, will behave or react. For ex- 
ample, if bonds and preferreds are falling, the composite diary will be 
pulled down by the preferreds, but the common stock diary won't. 
Watching the movements of both can give us a feeling as to where the up 
or down pressures in the market may be coming from. 

In the common stock diary, the total of issues traded represents the 
number of stocks traded — not the number of shares, but the number of 
stocks. Advances tells the number of issues traded that advanced, and de- 
clines shows the number that fell. Unchanged displays the unchanged 
number of issues. 

For dyed-in-the-wool technicians, advances and declines are two of 
the most important technical indicators. The difference between the two 
statistics is usually plotted against a market index, such as the Dow Jones 
30 industrials. This chart shows whether the market is sending contrary 
signals. If the advance/decline line is going up and the Dow is going 
down, a technician interprets this to mean that the market may be ready 
to fall. This interpretation is not always correct (what is?), but ad- 
vance/decline information is nonetheless a widely used point of ref- 
erence. 

The composite diary also shows the number of stocks that have at- 
tained new highs or lows for the previous twelve-month period. Tech- 
nicians often use the difference between the highs and lows to get an idea 
of how the top and bottom ends of the market are doing, especially those 
stocks used in the Dow Jones 30 industrials. For example, if the Dow 
Jones 30 industrials average is going down and the number of stocks hit- 
ting new market lows is getting smaller, a technician may interpret this 
situation as a sign that the market will likely rally in the future. If the 
number of new highs is getting smaller and the Dow is rising, the techni- 
cal interpretation is that the market may have false hopes and will prob- 
ably go bearish. Many technicians refer to this form of analysis as 
divergence analysis. Market Laboratory also lists this kind of mforma- 
tion for the American, over-the-counter, and New York bond exchanges. 

Many technicians rely much more heavily on volume changes than 
they do on price changes, but they don't necessarily have to chart these 
changes in order to use them. 

Figure 2 shows the twenty stocks that were most active on the New 
York exchange during the previous week. This table is often used in 
checking the "mind set" of the market. 

As you know, the largest corporations in the United States, if not the 
world, trade on the New York exchange; these include such companies 
as AT&T, Exxon, and IBM. Many technicians consider the presence of 
these firms in the "twenty most active stocks" table a good sign — a sign 
that the market's expectations are high and that investors have their 
heads screwed on straight. If the table is dominated by more speculative 
issues, many technicians believe that investors are scrambling to make 
some money before the market begins to fall. Although this analysis is

scratched the surface of technical analysis. The purpose of these last two 
tutorials has not been to teach you technical analysis, but to teach you 
about it— to familiarize you a bit with the lingo technicians use and to 
give you some idea where to look for technical information. If you're in- 
terested in learning more about technical analysis, getting a book on the 
subject from your local library or bookstore is a gocxl beginning. You 
should be able to find a variety of materials written for investors at vari- 
ous levels of experience. 

Keeping Up— This Month's Review. No matter what your analyti- 
cal orientation is or what you invest in, you need a way to keep track of 
your investment dealings. With that in mind, we'll look this month at the 
Dow Jones Market Manager, a software system designed to help inves- 
tors stay on top of their portfolios. 

Dow Jones Market Manager, Dow Jones & Company (Box 300, 

Princeton, NJ 08540; 800-257-5114). $299. 

Backup policy: One backup supplied; additional copies $30 each. 

System requirements: 48K Apple II, II Plus, or lie; one disk drive, 

printer. 

Optional: Hayes Micromodem II. 

The Dow Jones Market Manager is a portfolio reporting and account- 
ing system that can track up to twenty-six different portfolios. The pro- 
gram is designed to handle stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, and 
treasury issues. Let's explore its capabilities by going through the proc- 
esses involved in establishing a portfolio, updating it, and printing out 
reports. 

Market Manager requires that the printer interface be in slot 1 and the 
Micromodem II be in slot 2. Unfortunately, because the program is writ- 
ten in Pascal, these specifications cannot be altered, so if your peripher- 
als are arranged any other way, you'll have to swap them around each 
time you run this program. 

Since Market Manager can handle twenty-six portfolios, an investor 
can choose from among twenty-six possible names — the twenty-six let- 
ters of the alphabet. Though it may sound clever, this naming convention 
is actually a severe drawback. Most people give their portfolios names

that signify the kinds of securities that are contained in them, such as 
bonds, high-tech, or blue chips. A single letter tells the investor nothing, 
and it increases the off-system bookkeeping and tracking that must 
be done. 

When you input the letter of an existing portfolio, all transactions you 
enter are automatically posted to that portfolio. When a new name (let- 
ter) is given, the program establishes a new portfolio file and prompts the 
investor for the transactional information. 

If a transaction is the first one being entered into the program during 
a session, pressing return displays the default date (entered when the pro- 
gram is booted). If a transaction occurred on a different date, that date 
can be entered. After the first entry, the default date will always be the 
last date entered into the system, making it possible for the investor to 
enter streams of prior transactions with ease. However, the date er- 
ror-checking does not look for the validity of a date. It's possible, for in- 
stance, to enter a log-on date of 10/5/83 and a buy transaction dated 
10/05/89 without the program being the wiser. A program of this nature 
should really do a better job of alerting the investor to dates that may not 
be appropriate. 

The next prompt asks the investor if the transaction is a buy (B) or a 
sell (S). Market Manager then requests the number of securities involved 
in the transaction, the symbol for the security, its type (S for stock, B for 
bond, O for option, M for mutual fund, T for treasury issue), and the 
dollar amount. 

It is at the inputs for the amount and type of security that two major 
flaws in Market Manager become evident. No matter what we tried, we 
could not seem to get the program to accept a bond or treasury bill trans- 
action. Every time the B or T key was hit, the system gave a rather rude 
audio response and rejected the entry. And, believe it or not, Market 
Manager does not accept cents, only dollars. So if you have a common 
stock transaction for $1,200.76, you can enter the $1,200 but not the 
seventy-six cents. This virtually negates the program's value for income 
tax purposes. Next time you file your tax return, try rounding off all the 
numbers. The aggregate effect might not be more than a few dollars over 
the course of a year, but that could still push you into another tax 
bracket, which would mean a larger tax liability. 

Once an entire transaction has been entered, the investor is asked to 
check to make sure that all the information is correct. If it's not, correc- 
tion is done through the entry screen by answering "yes" to the prompt, 
"Any changes?" and specifying the information to be changed. If the 
information is correct, answering "no" to the prompt moves the pro- 
gram along to the next transaction. 

When the investor closes out a position (by entering both a buy and a 
sell transaction on the same security), Market Manager displays the pro- 
jected profit/loss on the position and asks whether the investor does in- 
deed want to close out the position. If so, the program transfers the 
details of the realized gain/loss to the reports. For example, if you were 
to enter a buy transaction for one hundred shares of Apple Computer at 
$30 per share and then enter a sell transaction for all one hundred shares 
at a selling price of $50, Market Manager would tell you that your pro- 
jected profit on the closed position is $2,000 ($50 selling price - $30 
buy price *100 shares). 

Market Manager can also account for cash. If securities are pur- 
chased, the program automatically deducts the total cost of the transac- 
tion from the cash balance. If a security is sold, the total proceeds from 
the sale are added to the cash balance. 

Remarkably, that's all there is to entering stock information in this 
program. It's one of the simplest procedures in any program of its kind. 
Unfortunately, the inability to accept full prices (prices that include 
cents) and the problem concerning bonds and treasury issues almost ne- 
gate the program's intended value. 

The updating of current prices in the portfolio can be done automati- 
cally by logging on to the Dow Jones News/Retrieval Service and col-

Based on the securities bought and sold, positions closed, and cash 
balance. Market Manager generates four reports on a portfolio. They 
cover holdings by portfolio, holdings by symbol, realized gains/losses, 
and year-to-date transactions. 

The holdings-by-portfolio report (see figure 3) shows all the current 
open positions within each portfolio. For each security in the portfolio, 
the report displays transaction date, the symbol of the security being 
traded, the nature of the trade (buy, sell, short sale, or buy/trade to cover 
a short sale), the quantity traded, the original cost of the security, the 
average price per share (which is simply the total price divided by the 
quantity purchased), the current value of the securities, the present price 
per unit, the unrealized gain or loss, and whether the transaction is a

The lower left portion of the report shows the column totals for both 
securities held (valued securities long) and securities sold short (valued 
securities short) . The cash balance for the portfolio is also computed and 
displayed. 

The holdings-by-symbol report is shown in figure 4. When this report 
is chosen, the program asks which symbol (security) the investor is inter- 
ested in. It then scans through each portfolio on the disk and records the 
information given in the holdings-by-portfolio report for that particular 
security. 

The realized gains/losses report (figure 5) consists of all transactions 
that have been closed by the investor. This report shows both purchase 
and sale information, plus realized gain and loss and the capital gain 
treatment that ought to be given the transaction. Although the program 
assigns a short- or long-term capital gain indicator to the transaction, it 
doesn't total up the gains by that classification. This would have been a 
simple thing for the program to do and would greatly enhance the pro- 
gram's value as a tax tool.

tions that have occurred in a given portfolio during the year. This report 
gives the investor an excellent audit trail against which to check the 
year's portfolio entries to be sure that nothing was forgotten and that no 
wrong information was entered. 

When its reports are run, Market Manager prompts the investor to set 
the top-of-form on the printer. Then, after each report finishes printing, 
the program is supposed to send an eject signal to the printer so that a 
new, clean sheet will be brought up for the next report. This top-of- 
form/eject feature worked on only one of the reports we ran, so that the 
end result of a printing session was a series of reports that were not easy 
to separate or to read. Such a lack of attention to detail is inexcusable, 
especially from Dow Jones. 

In addition to automatic log-on and fetch of securities prices. Market 
Manager offers the ability to retrieve financial news from the Dow Jones 
News/Retrieval Service. The news program is quite nicely done and, in 
contrast to some of the other modules of the program, very well designed 
and planned. 

Market Manager can retrieve up to sixty-six of the headlines for a 
symbol or company that the investor specifies. After these headlines have 
been received, the investor can scroll through them and retrieve the news 
stories they accompany. As many as five stories can be saved on one data 
disk, and these stories can either be printed or reloaded from disk at a 
later date. The program can also print stories directly from the Apple's 
memory. 

All other information on Dow Jones is accessed by means of the 
Market Manager terminal program. The information retrieved with this 
module is stored in an 8,800-character memory buffer. Retrieved infor- 
mation can be printed out, but it cannot be saved to disk. This is a real 
surprise. When you're using an information service, and especially when 
you're switching from one database to another, you receive many in- 
structions. Once the information you're seeking has been transmitted 
successfully, these instructions are of no use to you; they only take up 
space on a report. In light of this, many investors read communications 
files that were saved on disk into a word processor and edit out the in- 
structions. But since the program doesn't aUow you to save the data to 
disk, you can't do this with Market Manager. 

To Invest or Not To Invest? Dow Jones is a name that commands 
and deserves respect in the financial community. It is a company rich in 
tradition and history that has become known for its quest for excellence. 
Unfortunately, Market Manager does not live up to Dow Jones's reputa- 
tion. Until significant modifications have been made, this program is not 
a wise investment. jiM

Scrolling for Everyone. Scrolling is something you take for granted 
on the text screen. When you reach the bottom of the screen, everything 
automatically moves up one line and you continue typing as if nothing 
had happened. But as you begin to experiment with fonts that write on 
the hi-res screen, you come face to face with the scrolling problem. 

The Monitor routine that scrolls the text screen won't help you on the 
hi-res screen. Most hi-res writing routines use the output vector at mem- 
ory locations 54 and 55 ($36 and $37 hex) to intercept normal output. If 
your font uses the same size characters as the standard Apple character 
set, you can plot your character at the current cursor position and then 
call COUT, the Monitor character output routine. COUT keeps track of 
assorted details like cursor position and automatic return when the right 



bizarre organization of the Apple hi-res memory. As shown on the maps 
of the hi-res screen on page 21 of the old Apple II Reference Manual and 
page 34 of the Apple lie Reference Manual, the order of the addresses 
doesn't appear to have an order. But it does, and the screen address of 
the leftmost byte of each line (the base address) can be calculated from 
the Y coordinate. That byte and the thirty-nine bytes immediately follow- 
ing it comprise one hi-res screen line. Fortunately, we don't need to 
know how to do these calculations, since there is a routine called HPOSN 
at memory location $F411 in the Applesoft ROM that, among other 
things, calculates the memory address corresponding to a particular set 
of X and Y coordinates. 

The base address, as we said, is just the address of the leftmost byte

edge of the screen is reached, so your routine doesn't have to. 

However, when COUT decides it's time for a scroll, it accomplishes 
this task by moving the memory that comprises the text screen. This 
doesn't help you on the hi-res screen. So, it seems you must handle the 
scrolling yourself. Memory location 37 ($25 hex) contains the current 
vertical cursor position (0-23), and you can use this to decide when to 
scroll. We'll look at how this is done later on. 

The first problem to solve is how to scroll. Obviously, we have to 
move all the hi-res memory to new locations that correspond to screen 
positions above the present ones. 

Presented here are several different ways of accomplishing this. Each 
method has its advantages and disadvantages. 

The Long, Hard Scroll. Since the amount of memory that has to be 
moved is quite large, it would be unreasonable to write a routine in Basic 
to do the scrolling— that is, unless you wanted to have time to go out for 
a sandwich every time it scrolled. Clearly we need the speed of machine 
language. 

The problem tliat must be dealt with, as in all hi-res routines, is the 



of the screen line. Once we know the base address of the line we are in- 
terested in, we can use simple indexed addressing based on the X coordi- 
nate to address any byte on that line. 

Listing 1 shows a basic scrolling routine using this technique. The al- 
gorithm goes something like this: Move "text" line 2 to "text" line 1. 
Then move line 3 to line 2, line 4 to line 3, and so on. Each hi-res text 
line, however, is composed of eight hi-res screen lines. So, to move one 
line of text up one line, we actually have to move eight hi-res screen lines 
up eight lines each. In terms of hi-res lines, then, we move line 8 to line 
0, line 9 to line 1, line 10 to line 2, and so on. 

Each line of the hi-res screen is composed of forty bytes. We're mov- 
ing twenty-three text lines (the top line scrolls off the screen, so it doesn't 
need to be moved anyplace), which at eight hi-res lines per text line is 
184 lines. One hundred eighty-four lines times forty bytes per line equals 
7,360 bytes, the number to be moved in order to scroll the whole screen. 
Now is it clear why we can't do this in Basic? 

One thing does make sense about the way the hi-res screen is laid out: 
Each screen line is composed of forty consecutive bytes. This means 



TUrbo Charge Your Apple 
With Buffering! 




If you use a printer now... 



If you're just adding a printer. 




For Apples and Printers 

The Bufferboard is the original add-on buffer 
upgrade for existing interfaces. Easily installed, 
its memory power can store up to 20 pages of 
your Apple text data at a time. The Bufferboard 
accepts print data as fast as your Apple can 
send it. Then the Bufferboard trans- 
mits to your printer, while 
your computer 
races on to its 
next task. 





The Bufferboard 
uses an available 
Apple slot and 
"Docks" onto most popular interfaces, including 
Epson, Apple and Orange Micro Grappler config- 
urations. No external power supplies, no clumsy 
boxes and cables. It's the easiest and most eco- 
nomical way to add buffering.

index those addresses to get the addresses for the whole "from" and 
"to" lines. 

The routine calculates the ba.se address using the HPOvSN routine. 
Before this routine is called, the Y coordinate is placed in the accumu- 
lator and the X coordinate goes in the X and Y registers. The Y ccxjrdi- 
nate the first time through will be 8 and the X coordinate will be 0. The 
eighth screen line, remember, will be our first "from" address, with the 
X coordinate of 0 used to get the base address of the line. These values 
are set in lines 8 through 10, and HPOSN is called in line 1 1 . The base 
address is returned in locations $26 and $27 and subsequently moved to 
$06 and $07 by lines 12 through 15. 

The Y coordinate is retrieved from $E6, where it was left by 
HPOSN. Line 18 subtracts 8 from the Y coordinate's value to get the Y 
coordinate for the "to" line, and HPOSN is called again. 

At this point we have the base address for the "from" line in $06 and 
$07 and the base address for the "to" line in $26 and $27. A simple loop 
in lines 23 through 27 moves one line. Then the Y coordinate is recalcu- 
lated and a check is made to sec if the last line has been reached. If it 
hasn't, the process is repeated. 

Lisfing 2 is a more useful implementation of this technique. It be- 
haves just like the scroll on the text screen. In particular, it scrolls only 
within the defined text window, so you can poke locations 32 through 35 
to control the window just as you would on the text screen. Also, the new 
program erases the bottom line of text after executing the scroll. It has 
the added benefit of being completely relocatable; so although it is shown 
at location $300, you can bload it anywhere in memory where you have 
room. Just call the starting address to scroll. 

As written, the program in listing 2 scrolls hi-res screen 1 . To change 
it to scroll screen 2, just change the $20 in line 1 1 to $40. 

All of this assumes that you already have a routine to print text on the 
hi-res screen. If you don't, check out the April 1983 Softalk. No kidding, 
there are two different character generators in there, one in Roger Wag- 
ner's Assembly Lines column and one in Doug Carlston's All About Ap- 
plesoft column. Take your pick. The routine also works on any hi-res 
picture, so you can try it out right away even if you don't have hi-res text 
routines.

Listing 2. 



Now let's look at how you can use a scroll routine with your charac- 
ter generator so that the hi-res screen automatically behaves just like the 
text screen. There are two conditions that will cause COUT to initiate a 
scroll. The first is the printing of a return character when the cursor is on 
the bottom line. The second is when the right edge of the screen is 
reached on the bottom line. As a side note, COUT does not actually 
make two tests. When the right edge of the screen is reached, COUT 
forces a return, and so it is always the return that forces the scroll. 

Listing 3 is a short routine that sits in the output path before the char- 
acter generator. It performs the necessary tests and jumps to the scroll 
routine if necessary. Lines 12 and 13 should be changed so that SCROLL 
points to the scroll routine and CHRGEN points to your character gen- 
erator. If you don't have an assembler, make these changes in the hex 
code corresponding to lines 28 and 33. This code is relocatable and may 
be put wherever you like in memory. Finally, to use the scroll hook, you 
must change the output vector so that this routine sees each character 
first. To do this, place the starting address of the routine (low byte, high 
byte) in locations $36 and $37 (54 and 55 decimal) and then call the DOS 
hookup routine at $3EA (1002 decimal). In Basic it would look like this: 

10 POKE 54, ADR - INT(ADR/256)*256: POKE 55, 
INT(ADR/256) : CALL 1002 

All subsequent output (until a reset or pr#0) will be intercepted by this 
routine before being passed on to your hi-res character generator. 

Hi-Speed Scrolling for Fun and Profit. The problem with the scroll 
routine in listing 2 is that it's just too slow. This isn't a problem if you're 
printing only a few lines at a time, but if you try to list a long Basic pro- 
gram, the scrolling produces a wavy motion that can make you seasick 
(the same motion occurs on the text screen, but it is too fast to notice). 
What we need is a way to speed up the scrolling routine so that the wavi- 
ness is undetectable. 

The reason the scroll routine is so slow is that it has to calculate (via 
HPOSN) the base address for each line. Since this calculation is done al- 
most four hundred times, it really bogs things down.

If you have dabbled in graphics, you are probably familiar with the 
concept of a Y-lookup table. This is simply a table of all the base ad- 
dresses on the hi-res screen, and it is stored in memory so that your pro- 
grams can just look up the addresses instead of calculating them. This 
speeds things up considerably, but you pay the price in memory. Listing 
2 could be modified to use a lookup table instead of HPOSN to get the 
addresses, but there is an even faster way to scroll.

any time calculating the addresses or looking them up in a table. For each 
screen line moved, there is one line in Hyperscroll for the "from" line 
and one line for the "to" line. All of the LDA and STA commands use 
indexed addressing, so the whole thing is executed once for each column 
to be scrolled, with the Y register set each time to the value of the scroll- 
ing column. It is long, but only about twice the length of a program plus 
a lookup table. It makes up for the length difference in speed. 

Nevertheless, nobody relishes the idea of typing all that code. This is 
where the Basic program in listing 5, Scroll Maker, comes to the rescue. 
True, you stUl have to type in the Basic program, but once you've done 
that you'll have a utility that can be used to generate many different 
scrolling routines. Scroll Maker generates the entire machine language 
scrolling program, which can be executed through the scroll hook 
routine the same way the old routine was or called directly by another 
program. By making simple changes in the Basic program, you can gen- 
erate superfast scrolling routines for both text and graphics applications. 

The variable L in line 160 holds the address where the scrolling rou- 
tine will start. Since the code produced by this program is not relocat - 
able, you should make sure this is where you want the code before 
running the program. Of course, if you ever need to move your scroll 
routine to a different location, you can just change line 160 and run it 
again to generate new machine code at the desired location. 

When you run this program, it will ask you how many lines to scroll. 
We have been scrolling up eight lines at a time for standard text format, 
but you can put anything you like in there. For example, if you want a 
continuously scrolling background for a hi-res game, you will find that 
scrolling only two or three lines at a time produces a much smoother (al- 
though slower) effect. 

When the program finishes, it will tell you the starting address and 
length of the machine code, which you will need to bsave it. It will then 



give you a small demonstration of your new scrolling routine. It draws a 
few lines and then executes a scroll every time you press a key. Use the 
repeat key to see the continuous scrolling effect. When you've had 
enough, press E to exit the program. 

Variations. As written, the routine created by this program will do a 
standard scroll— that is, everything on the screen will be moved up, and 
the bottom lines will be erased. The scrolling routine is written by the 
loop in lines 230 through 310. Lines 330 through 390 take care of the 
code to erase the lines left behind. 

The subroutines at lines 900 and 1000 allow the option to wrap- 
around—instead of erasing the bottom lines, they can be replaced with 
the lines going off the top. This has some interesting possibilities as a 
moving background for a game or as a special effect in a program title 
picture. To implement this option, just add these lines: 

220 GOSUB900 

320 GOSUB 1000 : GOTO 380 

The variable I in line 170 controls the scroll direction. If you want the 
screen to scroll down instead of up, just change the value of 1 to - 1 be- 
fore running. 

In line 190 you have the option of scrolling hi-res page 1 or page 2. 
Just change the value of PG to the page you want. 

To try it out on one of your favorite hi-res pictures, just bload the pic- 
ture before running Scroll Maker, and change line 1 1 10 to: 

1110 POKE -16304,0:POKE - 16302,0:POKE -16297,0 

The scrolls produced by this program are so fast that there is almost 
no detectable flicker. Scroll Maker and Hyperscroll can be used for 
smooth text scrolling or for interesting graphics.

□ John Couch, who has been on a leave of ab- 
sence from Apple Computer (Cupertino, CA) 
recently, announced that he has left the compa- 
ny to join the board of directors of Software 
Ventures (Mountain View, CA). Couch, who 
was formerly vice president and general manag- 
er of Apple, directed the development of the 
Lisa. In other Apple news, the company has 
won a small victory in what may prove to be a 
protracted legal battle against Franklin Com- 
puter (Cherry Hill, NJ). The Third Circuit 
Court of Appeals ruled that Apple II pro- 
grams — especially those stored in ROM com- 
ponents and operating systems— are subject to 
copyright protection. A lower court had ruled 
earlier that the copyright law was unclear in its 
application toward a computer's operating sys- 
tem. Now, Franklin has the option to appeal the 
case or return to the lower court, which will 
rule on whether Franklin violated the copy- 
right law. 




Reporter Richard Sypher of the Tacoma News 
Tribune practices one of the eye relaxation 
techniques he learned at a Dataspan seminar for 
VDT users. 

□ Dataspan (New York, NY), a professional 
training company, introduced its training pro- 
grams for the automated office in the New York 
area this past October. The skills courses were 
geared toward increasing the productivity and 
accuracy of VDT users while increasing users' 
comfort on the job. Those who attended the 
courses were counseled on methods to improve 
ergonomic factors such as lighting, chair adjust- 
ment, and terminal placement, and were taught 
to utilize their short-term memory to avoid con- 
stant shifting back and forth between the users' 
source material and the VDT screen. The first 
company to try the Dataspan programs was 
Boeing Aircraft. A study conducted six months 
after twenty-four Boeing employees took the 
courses revealed an 86 percent reduction in er- 



ror rate and a 91.5 percent increase in speed. 
"We come in where the computer salesmen 
leave off, showing workers how to deal with the 
machine, not simply how to make it work. 
That's what ergonomics is all about: the science 
of adjusting machines to people and vice versa. 
The workers win because they feel better and 
the company wins because the work is better, ' ' 
said Gerald L. SolofT, president of Dataspan. 

□ Sirius Software (Sacramento, CA) has filed 
a $20 million suit against Fox Video Games 
(Santa Clara, CA), a division of Twentieth Cen- 
tury-Fox, alleging breach of contract, fraud, 
and breach of covenant of good faith. The com- 
plex suit, which contains forty counts against 
Fox, asserts that Fox failed to live up to a con- 
tract between the companies that gave Sirius the 
option to translate Fox's coin-operated arcade 
games to personal computers and Fox the option 
to translate Sirius 's personal computer games to 
the arcades. The suit seeks to dissolve prior 
agreements between the companies, including a 
contract that would give Fox one-third of 
Sirius 's common stock. Jerry Jewell, president 
of Sirius and one of the plaintiffs named in the 
suit, said that Fox made a string of promises it 
didn't live up to. He declined to make further 
comment. 

□ Andrew Greenberg, coauthor of Wizardry, 
has agreed to produce three war games for 
Origin Systems (Houston, TX). The programs, 
which will be released early next year, are 
based on board games designed by Steve 
Jackson— someone whom Greenberg says he 
has admired for years. Robert Del Favaro, 
who designed part of the scenario for Legacy of 
Llylgamyn, will collaborate on the venture. 
Greenberg said his new interest will not inter- 
fere with his work at Sir-tech. 

□ Apple has announced that it plans to rescue 
hundreds of would-be computer buyers who got 
burned when CompuPlus (Van Nuys, CA), one 
of the largest Apple dealers, declared bankrupt- 
cy last March. In the aftermath of its sudden 
collapse, CompuPlus left hundreds of consum- 
ers shocked and angry by not delivering mer- 
chandise that was already paid for. A total of $4 
million in claims from consumers, as well as 
Apple and other large firms, was leveled against 
the store. Apple has agreed to provide Compu- 
Plus customers with their computers— at last— if 
they agree to pay the difference between the full 
list price of the equipment and the discounted 
price they paid CompuPlus. In return, buyers 
must sign over to Apple their claims against 
CompuPlus, thus giving Apple a priority over 
other corporate creditors. Under federal bank- 
ruptcy laws, the first $900 of an individual's 
claim goes into a category with higher priority 
than claims of business creditors. Apple agreed 
that if the company ever collects on its claims 
for the undelivered discounted Apples, it will 



split the proceeds evenly with individual con- 
sumers. 

□ Broderbund has moved. Its new address is 
17 Paul Drive, San Rafael, CA 94903. The 
company's phone number is (415) 479-1 170. 

□ Synergistic Software (Renton, WA) has sold 
the rights to several of its programs as part of 
the transition toward becoming a software au- 
thor house, said Synergistic president Robert 
Clardy. Synergistic has sold Bolo to Sir-tech 
Software (Ogdensburg, NY) and The Linguist 
to Gessler Publishing (New York, NY). 
Clardy also said that negotiations are under way 
to sell Microbe to Atarisoft (Sunnyvale, CA), 
the new multicomputer software division of 
Atari. 

□ William Millard, president of Comput- 
erLand (Hay ward, CA), was named one of the 
400 richest people in the country in a recent is- 
sue of Forbes. Millard, a college dropout who 
made his fortune through the success of Com- 
puterLand, opened his first store in 1976. Com- 
puterLand now has 550 franchises worldwide 
and $1 billion in yearly revenues. Millard owns

«EXTRA! 




In mid-October, during an Apple special interest user group 
meeting via telecommunications on CompuServe, Apple II in- 
ventor Steve Wozniak spoke of sixteen-megabyte Apple lis with 
twenty-four-bit addressing and Lisa-like mice. 

The atmosphere at the time was that of a gathering of friends, 



but the transcript reads like a presidential press conference. 
Unlike most presidents, Woz's goal is to communicate, not hedge; 
the strictures of business held him back only a little. Hard ques- 
tions flew like racquetballs, but Wozniak never missed unless he 
wanted to. 

After fielding questions on Apple's corporate health with, 
"Well, I'm not a fmance man, but I have Apple stock on margin 
well above what I own, ' ' and after dismissing the upcoming IBM 
Peanut as "like the Edsel," a home computer with not enough 
dealer margin and too little software backing, Wozniak got down 
to the subject he knows best, the Apple II, in all its manifesta- 
tions—past, present, and future. 

Of primary importance to n and n Plus owners, Woz spoke of 
a plug-in board for which he's campaigning that will upgrade the 
earlier Us to He's. But the lie is also headed for upgrading. Com- 
menting on the soft-switching approach to using the extra 64K in 
the He extended video card, Wozniak said, "I promise an alter- 
native solution soon"— defined as "six months?"— "for direct 
access to twenty-four-bit addresses." At another point, he spoke 
of the "enhanced He family . . . headed toward sixteen megabytes 
in a short time with a revolutionary 6502-based processor. 

It may have seemed off the wall for a user to ask about the He 
running in Lisa-emulation mode. If so, Woz embraced the wall 
and part of the ceiling too: "I believe strongly in the advantages of 
the Lisa/Mac user interface and see it as a reasonable goal for n 
software in the future, based on double hi-res graphics and pos- 
sibly clever software or a faster processor." Later, in talking 
about the differences in the revisions A and B He motherboards 
and the revision B's capacity for double hi-res, Woz conunented, 
"This may become more important with future mouse software 
and Mac-like user interface." 

What-like interface? 

"Just go to your local store and look at Lisa. Then imagine

□ Excalibur Technologies (800 Rio Grande Boulevard N.W., 21 Mer- 
cado, Albuquerque, NM 87104; 505-242-3333) has two new versions of 



slightly less hardware and memory but an advantage taken to 
make it faster and better with fewer resources (sound familiar, He 
world?). Mouse, no color, no slots, but the finest software. Basic 
and Pascal [for the Mac] are the finest ever done as well. . . . It's 
rare for a successful company like Apple to do something so rev- 
olutionary and great as Mac. 

"Mac will use its own operating system, which was developed 
to handle the user interface of Lisa more directly with better per- 
formance. Such good software has been written for Mac that it 
will be transferred to Lisa soon!" 

The Mac, whatever it might be, will have 128K ROM, a 
black-and-white monitor, and use a small floppy disk, according 
to Wozniak— "around average personal computer price with nor- 
mal peripherals." 

"Initially Mac won't displace the [IBM] pc as a small business 
machine due to memory, mass storage, and slot capability limits. 
But Mac is intended to be a more finished product for the bulk of 
the personal market— [with Apple] assuming which peripherals 
and features the users would want and supplying them at lower 
cost than if they had slots to make their own choices. Interesting. ' ' 

Earlier, Wozniak had commented on the similar closed- 
machine policy as it applied to the Apple III: "One of the down- 
falls was that we were too smart. We knew the proper ways to do 
all sorts of things and we didn't allow hackers to do things their 
own random ways. I feel we were wrong to believe in our 'reli- 
gion. ' Users should only use a good product (like SOS) if it's bet- 
ter for their application, not because the company feels only one 
way is right. It's a good lesson to learn." Apparently, corporate 
Apple still hasn't learned it. If you have strong feelings about this, 
Woz suggests, "please let them [Apple Computer] know." 

But it was the mysterious Scotsman that had captured the 
group's imagination, despite its suspected tightness. And Woz- 
niak tried to comply by contrasting the birth of the new child

"I believe that Mac is the most revolutionary computer of all 
time. Not that what it does hasn't been done before, but that it 
hasn't been done at a price that will allow millions of users to wind 
up experiencing it. 

"I developed the original Apple strictly from a hacker mental- 
ity, trying impressive tricks to satisfy a market of one— my- 
self— which made it possible to include a lot of the accessible fea- 
tures. For example, I didn't assign a team to design the hardware 
and a team to design the software, but did them both. The lack of 
task partitioning allowed the software to interact very closely with 
the hardware and make personal computers inexpensive. 

' 'The designers of the Mac worked closely enough to achieve 
this, and many (Bill Atkinson, Andy Hertzfeld, Burrell Smith) are 
hackers at heart. The Mac unfortunately is so perfect that we [Ap- 
ple] didn't leave much room for hackers to do hardware 'for them- 
selves' or 'their own way' — we feel there are no alternatives. . . . 

"You [Mac owners] won't have the interesting world we [II 
people] enjoy of programming to handle each of five eighty- 
column cards, six printer interface cards, four dot-matrix printers 
and a letter-quality printer, four modem cards, et cetera. 

"The world of ones and zeros, registers and adders, instruc- 
tion sets and video modes . . . this world is dear to many of us. 
We were forced to learn it to be Apple pioneers." 

Pioneers. Remember the survey that showed IBM pc owners to 
prefer pepperoni-only pizza overwhelmingly, while Apple owners 
opted for every combination — mostly the works? Silly, maybe; 
maybe not. But aren't we, Apple II, n Plus, lie owners, all pio- 
neers? You betcha. 

So, come next spring, when you meet someone who says, 
"I'm glad I have a Mac!" you can respond, "I'm glad I have an 
Apple, n." He'll think you mean "also," and you won't spoil 
his fun. 31

Free Enterprise 

A business management game 

You run your own company making decisions based 
on economic factors and the actions of competitors. 

It's your opportunity to sit on top and run a corporation. 
Free Enterprise, based on an IBM-developed simulation 
for training top-level managers, is as surprising and 
demanding as the real world. 

It lets you face the same on-your-toes challenges you 
would in running a real business: pricing products, 
determining budgets for advertising, production, plant 
improvement, and R&D. Even securing bank loans and 
deciding on stockholder dividends. You use computer 
generated reports to make decisions. But if you're wrong 
you could go bankrupt. Only the shrewd survive! 

Free Enterprise can be played at three competency levels 
so novices can compete with the more experienced, and 
from one to six can play. It's the perfect chance to learn 
about the free enterprise system — to practice business 
strategies — and to enjoy it — with no risks. 

Simulation components: disk, user's manual, pad of 50 
record sheets, and pad of 50 decision sheets. 

To obtain Free Enterprise, see your local dealer or send 
in the order form below. 

Operates on an IBM Personal Computer with 64k RAM 
and disk drive (DOS 1.1) or an Apple II Plus with 48k

Part 6: Game Padc 

You have probably heard that one of the main advantages of assembly 
language is its speed, but you may not know exactly what that means. Af- 
ter all, how fast is "fast"? We used to say, "fast as an express train"— 
but the Apple can do a major change in personality, from business sys- 
tem to arcade game, in less time than it takes an express train to travel 
one mile. 

Computer events are usually measured in microseconds— nulhonths 
of a second. The express train we mentioned takes about a thousand mi- 
croseconds to travel one inch. Most assembly language instructions are 
executed in three or four microseconds. 

Normally, we humans aren't interested in microseconds: Our reac- 
tion time is measured in tenths of seconds. At a movie, we get a new pic- 
ture every forty-two milliseconds (thousandths of a second), and it looks 
like one continuous picture. In real time (that is, time as we humans per- 
ceive it), anything from a microsecond to a few dozen milliseconds 
counts as zero time. 

But progranmiers, as you know, do a lot of things that would seem 
strange to a normal human, and that goes double for assembly language 
programmers (sorry about that). This month, you are going to learn how, 
and when, to count microseconds. 

Game Paddle Timing. Let's talk about reading the game controller 
inputs. These are the only Apple inputs that can perceive an analog 
signal — a signal that is continuously variable over a certain range (for 
comparison, a digital signal must be in one of two states, 0 or 1 ; anything 
else, like Vi, is an error). 

As you might expect, reading these inputs is more complicated than 
the usual, "Is it on or off?" There is a time factor involved. Each game 
paddle input is connected to a timer, and the position of the paddle (or 
knob, or joystick) determines the time delay for that input. In order to 
read one of these ports, a program has to start the timer and measure how 
long it takes to time out: The result is the position of the paddle. 

Let's take that a step at a time. The problem is that the microproc- 
essor chip (the "brain," or central processing unit, of the Apple) doesn't 
understand analog inputs at all. That means that the analog information 
must be converted into some form of digital signal before the microproc- 
essor can recognize it. This is done by special circuits on the mother- 
board near the game connector: The aforementioned timers convert the 
analog input into a time- variant digital signal. 

When a timer is triggered, its output goes from 0 to 1 (digital); then, 
after a certain time (determined by the p)osition of the knob or joystick), 
the output falls to 0 again. The signal is now purely digital, and tiie ana- 
log information has been converted to a time interval. 

In order to recover the analog information (the position of the knob) 



es and Fast Loops 

from this signal, the microprocessor simply measures the incoming sig- 
nal against a timer of its own and reports the resulting value. 

Parallel Time. The timing circuit is so simple that the Apple design- 
ers chose to give each paddle input line its own timer: There are four of 
them. Each one consists of a capacitor on the board, the variable resistor, 
or rheostat, in the hand control, and an integrated circuit that manages all 
four timers. Each timer puts out a perfectly good signal when triggered, 
and they all trigger at once. 

This seemed a little odd, since the Applesoft PDL (X) command 
reads only one paddle at a time and it can't be used twice in a row, since 
it needs "settling time" between uses. Most games nowadays (and many 
word processors, graphics processors, and educational programs) use 
joystick control, which requires the reading of two paddle inputs, pref- 
erably at the same time. It would be nice to be able to read two timers at 
once, since they're all running anyway. 

Let's take a look at such a routine, which will also serve to demon- 
strate the use of the X and Y indexes in nested loops. Later, if you want 
to write a game or other program and you need to read a joystick, you 
can use this routine instead of two PDL conunands with a delay between. 

Unfortunately, it isn't as easy as modifying the existing routines; the 
Apple people were too fast for us. They made the time constants of the 
digitizing timers very short so as not to delay the calling program. 
There's no way you can cram more instructions into their timing loop 
without losing something— they didn't leave any room. 

But we don't give up that easy. Our double paddle read can be done if 
you're willing to sacrifice some resolution (that is, fineness of detail): 
The routine returns a range of 0 to 100, instead of 0 to 255. This program 
will read both joystick axes (GCO and GC 1 , in the Apple II Reference 
Manual) on call 768. The values wUl be stored in locations 800 and 801 
for later peeking. 

Even that much required considerable thought and considerable re- 
writing of the routine. When you use the microprocessor itself to 
measure time delays, you have to be careful about instruction execu- 
tion times; when you can't afford to waste any time at all, it gets even 
trickier. And that is why our secondary topic this month is counting 
microseconds. 

Execution Time. Some instructions take less time to execute than 
others (note: These instructions are being executed not because they did 
anything wrong, but simply because, in the Great Program, their Time 
has come). Execution time depends on the complexity of the instruction. 
Some of the simplest ones, like LDA (immediate) or INX, take only two 
machine cycles; the more complex ones, like LDA (indirect) or JSR, 
take up to six or seven cycles. A "machine cycle" is the set of micro-

processor activities that go with moving a byte from one place to 
another, or modifying a byte. In the Apple, with its 1.023 MHz system 
clock (that's megahertz, or million cycles per second), a machine cycle 
takes about one microsecond: 1/1.023, or .9775 /usee, to be exact. 

You may have trouble finding a list of assembly language commands 
specifying the number of cycles taken by each instruction. Some books 
on 6502 assembly language include such a list, but many do not. Even 
the Apple reference books, good as they are in most respects, fail to in- 
clude this information. Your best source for timing data is one of the 
manufacturers of the 6502 chip itself— Synertek or Rockwell. See if your 
computer store has any of their manuals, or write to them directly. 

In most programming applications, you don't need to know the ex- 
ecution speeids of the various commands— it's enough to know that they 
execute "very quickly." However, if you're doing process control in 
real time— for example, a tone generator, or a phase-controlled light 
dimmer, or an event timer— you may find an understanding of command 
cycle-times very useful. 

From Time to Place. What we want to make is an event timer. With 
that, we can measure the delay generated by one of the timers on the 
game control port; that measurement will give us the position of the pad- 
dle connected to that timer. 

In order to read a game port, you must first send a signal to start the 
timers (they all start together, even if you ' re using only one of them) . The 
timers' outputs all go to one, and the time interval begins. After a certain 
time, the output of each timer will fall to zero again; and the length of 
time it takes will indicate the resistance of the rheostat connected to that 
timer. If that resistance is the variable resistor in a game control or 
joystick, then the time interval indicates the position of the knob or shaft. 

You can measure this time interval with a simple loop. The algorithm 
(a fancy word for "logical procedure," or "sequence of steps," or 
"What you do is . . .") for the loop consists of three steps: (1) advanc- 
ing the loop counter, (2) testing the timer output, and (3) repeating the 
loop if it's still timing (output = 1) or exiting if it's timed out (output = 
0). On exit, the value of the loop counter will indicate the resistance in 
the timer circuit (and therefore the position of the knob or joystick): It 
says, ' 'The delay was long enough for the loop to go around X times . ' ' 

What we've described so far would look like this in assembly 
language: 

LOOP INX 

LDA TIMER 

BNE LOOP 
EXIT RTS 

But that's not enough by itself. We have to put a frame around it, to 
take care of some housekeeping. To start with, we have to zero the loop 
counter and trigger the timers: That's LDX #0 and STA TSTART. By 
the way, it makes no difference what's in the accumulator when STA 
TSTART is executed— this is not a normal "store" operation. All that's 
needed is to send a signal to the "start timers" address. Even a read 
command, such as LDA TSTART, would work. TSTART is, of course, 
the label for the address of the start timer soft switch. 

After the loop has finished, we need to do one more thing: save the 
loop count somewhere. Right now it's in the X register, but it won't be 
safe there very long. We'll use a byte of RAM out past the end of our 
routine; $320 will be a good one, and its decimal address, 800, is easy to 
remember; so STX $320 will take care of that. That gives us: 

START LDX #0 

STA TSTART 

LOOP INX 

LDA TIMER 
BNE LOOP 

EXIT STX $320 

RTS 

Reflnements. Even that isn't quite enough. First, we're going to 
need what you might call a Murphy trap. Consider these two points: The 
time delay produced by each game control port timer depends on the re- 
sistance connected to that port (that is, the higher the resistance, the 
longer the delay); and our timer, the way it is now, will stay in its loop 
until the port timer times out (output goes to 0). Got that? Okay, quick 



now, answer this: What if the joystick isn't plugged in? 

Right, you got it. The program will hang up indefinitely, waiting for 
the port timer to time out. If nothing is connected to the game port, the 
resistance in the timer circuit will be infinite, as will the delay. 

No problem; that's an easy one, if you think of it in time. We simply 
add a step after INX, as follows: BEQ EXIT. When the counter "roils 
over" (that is, when the value in the X register is incremented from 255 
to 0), the BEQ reacts and gets us out of the loop. And we should add a 
DEX to the exit routine, to adjust the limits of the final reading: What we 
have so far will give us 1 for zero resistance and 0 for the rollover case, 
and what we want is 0 and 255 respectively (if you want some exercise, 
try working out the logic for both cases, with and without DEX ) . 

That would work, but there's still one more change we should prob- 
ably make. We've been cheating a little bit on the explanation, and this 
would be a good place to clear things up. We have been talking about the 
signal called TIMER— the output of any of the game port timers— as if it 
were a one-bit signal, and it isn't. It's an eight-bit byte, like most inputs 
to the microprocessor, but it's not a normal byte: Only the high bit (most 
significant bit, sometimes called bit 7) changes. The other bits of that 
byte (bits 0 through 6) are always zero. 

It happens that bit position 7 serves a special purpose in 6502 sys- 
tems—it's used to indicate negative numbers. Bit 7 is often called the 
sign bit or the negative bit. In fact, two assembly language commands 
are dedicated to bit 7: They test it and branch accordingly. BMI (branch 
if minus) branches on bit 7 = 1 , or set: This is the convention for a nega- 
tive number. BPL (branch if plus) branches on bit 7 = 0, or clear. 

In the Apple II Reference Manual (page 24), they refer to this change 
in bit 7 in yet another way. In binary numbers, bit 7 represents the value 
128 (decimal); so the Apple book says that "the value becomes greater 
than 128" when they mean "the high bit is set" (negative, or, for our 
purposes, still timing), and "the value drops below 128" to mean "the 
high bit is cleared" (positive, timed out). 

We will acknowledge this confusion by changing the label from 
TIMER to PORT to show that we're dealing with an eight-bit byte, and 
we'll use BMI LOOP instead of BNE to focus our attention on the bit that 
is changing. That will give us: 

START LDX #0 

STA TSTART 

LOOP INX 

BEQ EXIT 
LDA PORT 
BMI LOOP 

EXIT DEX 

STX $320 
RTS 

This is probably about the way the Apple does it with the PDL com- 
mand in Basic. At least, this produces the same results: If you use it with 
a normal joystick or game control (total resistance 150K ohms), it gives 
the expected range of 0 to 255 . 

A Slight Improvement. But we wanted to do better than that. We 
wanted to read two timers with one command. After all, all four of the 
timers are running; couldn't we read two of them in each pass through 
the loop? Well, yes, we could, but. . . . 

The obvious way, as we mentioned earlier, is with a pair of nested 
loops. We're already using one loop, since we're doing the same thing 
over and over again: testing the timer. All we have to do is put in an in- 
ner loop to test one timer and then the other. 

Well, not quite. In the original version, when the timer timed out, we 
stopped the loop. We can't do that here, or we'll lose the count for the 
second timer. The loop has to keep rolling, with no change in speed, un- 
til both timers have timed out. 

Right, then, how about this? We reserve two bytes of RAM for 
scratchpad locations, one for each timer: $320 and $321, decimal 800 
and 801 . Then, on each pass through the timing loop, we test each timer; 
if it's still timing, we write the current loop counter value into the 
scratchpad location for that timer. If it's timed out, we skip the writing 
step. That way, the value in the scratchpad location (after the loop is 
finished) will be the value of the loop counter that was written on the pass 
just before the timer timed out.

ross Llues: 
The unique word 
challenge game. 

It offers intellectual stimulation arcade games can't 
match . . . with all the excitement. 

Fast-action fun isn't just for mystery or arcade games any 
more. Cross Clues is a word game that tests more than 
mere reflexes. It's the mind-challenging evolution of the 
crossword puzzle, with beat-the-clock excitement. The 
playing tempo is lively, but you decide how fast you want 
to go. The computer "umpires" while you compete with 
another player for hidden words, coaxing clues from the 
computer. Since a clue helps your opponent too, suspense 
builds till the end, when the best combination of skill, 
intellect, timing and luck wins. 

If you're ready for an even greater challenge, try 
Concentration Crosswords,™ a game that offers 3 levels 
of difficulty and 3 ways to play — for even the most 
demanding word whiz. Again, you compete against the 
clock to uncover hidden words. But once discovered, they 
disappear, to test your memory. Here, a combination of 
word skills, intellect, memory and luck determine the 
winner. 

Both games offer 50 mind-boggling puzzles that appeal 
to young teens through adults. Try them both!

Well, that's almost right. There's only one problem — that business 
about skipping a step if the timer has timed out. That's a no-no. If you 
start skipping a step, you change the number of steps in the timing loop, 
and that changes the length of time it takes. That, in turn, will mess up 
the value we get for the second timer, which is still going. 

What we have to do, instead, is put in one or more dummy program 
steps — commands that don't actually do anything— to take up the same 
amount of cycle time as the step that was skipped. This is where a knowl- 
edge of instruction execution times becomes important. 

Both Legs Equally Long. The program has to branch into two paral- 
lel paths — either of which will take the same number of machine cycles— 
and then it has to rejoin itself, like a river flowing around a long, narrow 
island. If the two pathways take the same number of cycles, they will 
take the same time. That way, the timing loop will take the same time no 
matter which pathway is used; we can update the scratchpad for a timer 
if it is still timing, or roll on by if it has timed out, without affecting the 
reading for the other timer at all. 

The problem looks very difficult at first. We've been using a simple 
STX (store X register) instruction, because we were storing X in only 
one place; but now we are going to use two loops, one for timing (as be- 
fore) and one to select which port timer we're dealing with. We will have 
to use a form of STX instruction that is indexed by Y so we can update 
the right scratchpad for each timer, from within the inner loop. 

The only STX instruction, indexed by Y, is a zero-page instruction- 
it doesn't work out there in main memory (if you don't know what zero 
page is, just think of it as an important place in memory. We'll deal with 
it another time). 

Okay, so we can't use 800 and 801 for our scratchpad. We'll use 28 
and 29 ($1C and $1D); they're available. And we'll use the Y indexed 
STX instruction, $96 (store the X register in the zero page address that 
follows, plus Y). The execution time for this instruction is four cycles, 
so now we know the length of one component of one leg of our two 
pathways. 

With a little thought, you can figure out the length of the rest of that 
leg, too— if you know about cycle times. Well, you have to know a lot 
about cycle times. It turns out that a branch instruction (any branch in- 
struction, BMI, BPL, BNE, and company) has two different cycle times. 
The choice depends on whether the program takes the branch or con- 
tinues straight ahead. 

Every branch is based on a test of some condition: zero, negative, 
overflow, or whatever. If the condition is not met, the program continues 
to the next step, in sequence. This is a very simple process and takes only 
two machine cycles. On the other hand, if the condition is met, the pro- 
gram must branch to another address, which means the address in the 
program counter must be changed. This takes longer: When the program 
takes the branch, it uses three machine cycles instead of two. 

We discovered, a while back, that one component of one branch of 
our parallel pathways had to be a Y-indexed STX operation, which took 
four cycles. We are trying to make these pathways as short as possible, 
you remember; so we would like to combine the shorter leg of the branch 
with the irreducible four cycles of STX. That will give us: branch on plus 
(timed out: do not update, but waste time), otherwise update scratchpad 
(still timing). The "update" path is six cycles long (two for the branch- 
not-taken and four fo'r the STX), so the "waste time" path must also be 
six cycles long; and we already have three cycles of it, the branch-taken. 

Well, that makes it easy— we got lucky this time! A branch-taken uses 
three cycles, and we have three more cycles to use up: We'll simply use 
another branch-taken. We can reserve a memory address out beyond our 
routine— call it WAIT. Then, when the timer we're testing has timed out, 
BPL takes us to WAIT; once diere, another BPL takes us to SELECT, 
which is where the other pathway will reach in the same length of time. 

But now we are going to need another Murphy trap. If the resistance 
in one of the time circuits is very near zero, that timer will time out be- 
fore the microprocessor's timing loop even gets started; and thus, on 
every pass through the loop, the program will bypass the update step for 
that timer. The trouble with that is, it leaves the value in the scratchpad 
location unchanged — and that value, which was left over from the last 
use of this routine, is no longer correct. 

Suppose you're trying to make a fast move in a program and you ram 
the joystick as far over as it will go. Let's say also that you went toward 
the zero end of the scale, causing the situation described above. Finally, 
we'll assume that the joystick is being read over and over again by some

calling program. Got that? Right. On the timer read cycle just before the 
joystick hit the end of its travel, it was passing (let's say) 25— so 25 was 
written into the scratchpad location and used by the program. 

See what's going to happen? Now that you've hit the stop, the 
resistance is nearly zero, and the scratchpad isn't being updated any 
more — so it still reads 25 when the correct value is zero! 

The answer to this one is easy, too— once you figure out what is going 
on. You simply have to set the two scratchpad locations to zero before 
you start the timing loop; then, if the timing resistance is zero and no up- 
date takes place, the value in the scratchpad will be correct anyway! 

A Good First Attempt. Listing 1 gives the program we have de- 
scribed. We are using the X register to count passes through the loop and 
the Y register to select which timer is being dealt with. 

The first steps in the timing process (lines 15 through 18) zero the 
loop counter and the output locations and send off a start signal to the 
timers (this can be done by either a write or a read operation— that is, ei- 
ther a load or a store instruction). Then the first timing loop begins. 

The timing loop is the outer loop: It begins first and ends last. In fact, 
the first step in the outer loop is to initialize the inner loop by setting the 
timer selector (the Y index) to 1 , which will select game control port 1 
(line 20). 

Then the inner loop begins. Line 22 reads the timer selected by Y, 
and you should be able to take it from there. The path advances to line 24 
if the timer is still running or branches to line 34 if it's timed out. Either 
way, the two paths rejoin at line 26. 

Now it's loop time again. Line 26 advances the port selector, the Y 
index, or, more precisely, retreats it (since we're counting backward in 
this loop). Then line 27 tests whether we've finished the inner loop yet, 
and if not sends us around once more (the reason we're counting 
backward is so that we can use this BPL for a loop exit when Y goes 
negative). 

Lines 29 and 30 take care of the outer loop. Note that in this version, 
the INX instruction is the last thing in the loop (instead of the first thing, 
as it was before). That's why we don't need a DEX step here, as we did 
last time. 

Improving on It. The program in listing 1 looks smooth and elegant 
on paper, but it has one fatal flaw: It's slow. As we mentioned earlier, 
th e Apple designers made the program for the PPL command as sim ple

and as fast as possible so that the calling program wouldn't have to wait 
around for a slow timer to run out; and then they chose component val- 
ues that would produce a maximum reading of 255 with their fast 
program. 

Our program of nested loops, running under those same component 
values, produces a maximum of seventy with a standard joystick. That 
gives you a range of paddle positions from 0 to 70; this isn't as good as 
we wanted, and besides, seventy is an awkward number to work with. 
Can we make our loops run any faster? 

Well, yes, we can, but we'll have to sacrifice the nested loop structure 
to do it. Our inner loop has an LDA instruction and an STY instruction, 
both using indexed addressing: If we used absolute addressing instead, 
we could save one cycle on each instruction. That adds up to four cycles 
on each pass through the timing loop— two instructions, used twice each. 

Worse than that, the BPL in line 27 (the branch that closes the inner 
loop) costs us three cycles every time we take the branch and two cycles 
when we don't. That adds up to ten cycles on each pass through the tim- 
ing loop. 

The answer is to turn the iimer loop into a straight stretch of program, 
without any branches (except of course the update/waste time branch, 
which we have to have anyway). This means repeating some sections of 
code, which makes our routine a few bytes longer, but even so it actually 
runs in less time. The new version is in listing 2. 

Note that this version uses page three addresses for scratchpad bytes 
again instead of the zero page bytes. That's because of the STX instruc- 
tion, which is part of one of our matched parallel pathways. STX (abso-

lute, zero page) takes only three cycles, instead of the four for STX (Y 
indexed, zero page), and that would have upset our timing; so we went to 
STX (absolute, not zero page), which takes four cycles again (lines 24 
and 28). The bytes used are $323 and $324 (803 and 804 decimal) be- 
cause the new routine extends to address $322, overwriting the old 
scratchpad location. 

Otherwise the program in listing 2 is pretty much the same as the one 
in listing 1 . However, it runs almost one-third faster: With a standard 
joystick, it gives a range of 0 to 98. That should be near enough to 100 
for most purposes. 

If you want to use this routine in one of your own programs, remem- 
ber that using it is a two-step process. First you have to read the timers 
with a call 768; that will store the current values in locations 803 
and 804. Then, when you need the information, you can peek those 
locations. 

It would probably be a good idea to calibrate your joystick (or other 
type of control) against the program before using it. Jake a reading with 
the control at each end of its range, and another in the middle: Adjust the 
control carefully in each position, call 768, and peek the readings. With 
that information, you can fine-tune your program for more sensitive joy- 
stick control.

Let your Apple teach you to program inBASIC! 



BASIC TUTOR makes learning BASIC easy. With it 
your Apple will give you step-by-step instruction in 
handling all the fundamental elements of the BASIC 
language. 

BASIC TUTOR begins in lesson one by assuming you 
have no knowledge of programming. By the end of the 
last lesson you will be writing carefully planned, well- 
constructed programs of your own. 

BASIC TUTOR is interactive, prompting you with 
questions to which you will respond at the keyboard. 
Positive reinforcement is given with each correct 
answer, and specific aid is provided with each incorrect 
answer to help lead you in the right direction. Also, 
frequent summaries and reviews help make your new 
knowledge stick. 

BASIC TUTOR was designed for self-instruction. You 
can work at your own pace to optimize your learning 
curve. And BASIC TUTOR is fully compatible with 
Applesoft BASIC, so that any original programs you 
write will immediately run on your Apple computer. 



BASIC TUTOR was written for SuperSoft by 
Courseware Applications, one of the pioneers in 
Computer Aided Instruction. Courseware Applications 
has had extensive experience in all areas of C.A.I. , 
including corporate training programs, educational 
instruction (including programs for the international 
PLATO network), and military simulation courses. This 
experience has helped make BASIC TUTOR 
Computer Aided Instruction at its best. 

With BASIC TUTOR you can turn your Apple into the 
greatest teacher you've ever had. So start learning 
BASIC today - with BASIC TUTOR.

STOCKING STUFFERS 




Thank the stars that Christmas comes only once a year. 
While you all have been out there fretting over what gifts to 
buy, we here at Softalk have been laboring like Hercules to 
compile the fourth annual Stocking Stuffers Holiday Gift 
Guide. 

What follows, arranged by category, is the most com- 
prehensive listing of Apple hardware and software since 
last year's Holiday Gift Guide. The individual entries are 
manufacturers' descriptions of their wares. We haven't 
tried all of them; we'll leave it to you to determine relative 
gift value. 

Here's what you can assume in terms of basic require- 
ments: 48K memory (64K for He programs), Applesoft, an 
eighty-column printer (if printer there need be), DOS 3.3, 
and one disk drive, unless specified otherwise. A ROM Ap- 
plesoft requirement can be satisfied with RAM Applesoft in 
a language card. 

At the end of the listings you'll find the complete ad- 
dresses of all the firms and most phone numbers. If you 
can't find the product in your neighborhood computer 



store, you can call or write the company for the location of 
its nearest retailer. 

Good luck, and remember: 'Tis the season to be jolly!

Now we liave two 





We added another head 
so you won't have to buy another disk. 

That's the beauty of a double sided head. A 
floppy disk which allows you to read and write on 
both sides. For more storage, for more information, 

for keeping larger records, 
and for improved perfor- 
mance of your system. 
That's what our new Elite 
Two and Elite Three offers. 
It's the first double headed 
Apple® compatible disk 
drive in the industry. And of 
course, the technology is 
from Rana. We're the com- 
pany who gave you 163K 
bytes of storage with our Elite One, a 14% increase 
over Apple's. And now with our high tech double 
sided heads, our Elite Two and Three offers you two 
to four times more storage than Apple's. That's 
really taking a byte out of the competition. 

We put our heads together 
to give you a superior disic drive. 

We designed the Elite Three to give you near 
hard disk capacity with all the advantages of a 
minifloppy system. The double sided head oper- 
ates on 80 tracks per side, giving you a capacity of 
652K bytes. It would take AVi Apples to give you 
that. And cost you three times our Elite Three's 
reasonable $849 pricetag. 



Rana s double sided heads give Apple 
II superior disk performance power 
than second generation personal com- 
puters such as IBM's 



It takes 4V2 Apples to equal the capacity 
of our superior Elite Three. 









The Elite Two offers an impressive 326K bytes 
and 40 tracks on each side. This drive is making a 
real hit with users who need extra storage, but 
don't require top-of-the-line capacity Costwise, it 
takes 2^/2 Apple drives to equal the performance of 
our Elite Two. And twice as many diskettes. Leave it 
to Rana to produce the most cost efficient disk 
drive in the world. 

We've always had the guts to be a leader. 

Our double sided head may be an industry 
first for Apple computers, but nobody was surprised. 



They've come to expect it from us. Because Rana 
has always been a leader We were the first 
with a write protect feature, increased capacity 




Your word processor stores 5 times as many pages of text on an Elite Three 
diskette as the cost ineffective Apple 

and accurate head positioning. A first with attrac- 
tive styling, faster access time, and the conve- 
nience of storing a lot more pages on far fewer 
diskettes. We were first to bring high technology to 
a higher level of quality 

So ask for an Elite One, Two, or Three. 
Because when it comes to disk drives, nobody 
uses their head like Rana.

CHARACTERS 

Willy Byte: electronic hero 
Hex Luthor: digital archviUian 
Cybil Nibble: 13 year-old player 
of Willy Byte m the Digital 
Dimension 

Sidney Nibble: 16 year-old 
brother 

cene ~ A suburban 
home m the 1980's on 
a late Sunday 
evening. A teenager, 
Cybil Nibble has 
been playing (for the 
umpteenth time) Willy Byte m 
the Digital Dimension, the 
newest creation m computer 
software from Data Trek, Inc. 
She decides to go to bed and 
quickly enters into a deep sleep 
that plunges her into the Digital 
Dimension. She finds herself on 
the ground gazing at eight 
towering electronic circuit 
poles, each emitting an orange 
glow that consumes the entire 
sky. Fascinated and perplexed 
by the sudden change m 





environments, Cybil notices an 
animated object, high m the 
heavens swinging from pole to 
pole. 

Cybil (whispering to herself): 
The lightning speed, the 
energetic response, the total 
commitment, it must be Willy 
Byte! 

(At that moment the game's 
charismatic electronic hero, 
Willy sees Cybil and slides 
gracefully down the pole to 
meet his newest acquaintance.) 
Willy Byte (cheerfully): 
Greetings, Cybil! Welcome to the 
Digital Dimension. 
Cybil The Digital what? 
Willy: You know my home, the 
mside of your computer Watch 
this! 




(Off he scampers about the 
keyboard room, pulling and 
tugging on each bit while 
dodging the stinging sensation 
of static charges As soon as 
Willy completes his task and the 
byte has safely left the keyboard 
room, a pale expression comes 
over Willy's face.) 
Cybil Are you alright? 
Willy Byte (concerned) 
Problems m the 
Power Room. 
Cybil (confused): 
What problems? 
Willy Byte (assertive): 
Follow me! 

(As Willy and Cybil sprint 
toward the I/O port, a sinister 
laugh IS heard from above - the 
laughter of Hex Luthor Suddenly 
a bolt of static charge is seen 
thundering its way toward Willy 
Byte) 

Cybil Watch out, Willy! 
(Cybil awakens from her dream 
to find her brother Sidney 
standing m her doorway ) 
Sidney (concerned): Cybil, are 
you alright? 

Cybil I guess I was dreaming. 



Sidney: As 1 was walking to the 
kitchen I noticed that the 
computer was left on. The 
screen's got a picture of a new 
game on it, 
but I can't 
find the 
disk. 




Cybil (animatedly): Yeah, it's 
Willy Byte in the Digital 
Dimension. Mom and Dad 
bought It for us, I'll show you. 
Sidney (sarcastically): They did 
what!? 

Cybil (on a sudden upsurge of 
emotion): Dad says that when I 
play Willy Byte I learn all kinds 
of stuff about computers. 
Sidney: Like what? 
Cybil: First you jump into the 
CPU room. And then there are 
lots of other game rooms to 



explore, and each is a part of the 
computer. 
Sidney: Oh really 
Cybil Yeah! And in this game 
you guide Willy on his wild 
adventures while he skydives 
into the Power room, operates a 
crane m the RAM room, bounces 
in and out of the CPU, and zips 
around the Disk Drive room, I got 
extra points for flowcharting 
Willy's . . . 

Sidney (perplexed): 
Flowcharting'?' What's 
flowcharting? 
Cybil It IS all explained 
m that little 
book that 
came with 
Willy 




Sidney: Where V^-^ is it? . . Here it 
IS. Ljook at that! Is that cover HOT! 
It looks like an album cover 
From the looks of all these 

pictures This looks great . . . 

Got to Play! Where's the disk? . . , 
Cybil! 

Cybil (dashing to the computer): 
Mom and Dad will let us play as 
long as we want and I'm first. 
Sidney (impatiently): Go for it!

YOUR SPREADSHEETS 
CAN lOOK PERFECT 
AND STIU BE WRONG. 



You know how it is. 

You spend hours building up a 
spreadsheet. Inserting data. Changing 
figures. Adding new formulas 
suggested by others. 

When you're finished, everything 
looks perfect. But is it? 

Are those totals really right? 

What formulas produced that 
bottom line? 

Is it out? And if so, by how much? 

The only way to be sure. 

If you use VisiCalc®, Lotus™ 1-2-3* 
or SuperCalc™ , you need 
The Spreadsheet AUDITOR. 

Why? Because only the AUDITOR 
allows you to quickly and simply 
print out every formula in your 
spreadsheet. 

Formulas are displayed in a two- 
dimensional grid that matches the 
layout of your spreadsheet exactly. 

Coordinates are printed. Pages are 
numbered. 

So you can refer to any section 
instantly — identify changing 
patterns — and spot errors or 
omissions, without having to move 
your cursor from cell to cell. 

For Lotus users, the AUDITOR 
even provides a complete listing of 
all named and special ranges. 

Quick, simple, sure. 

You don't have to waste time altering 
column widths. Or worry about 
clipping important formulas. 

The AUDITOR scales columns 
automatically. 

It gives you the option of wrap- 
ping long formulas into manageable 
columns that are easy to read. 



A permanent record. 

The AUDITOR allows you to 
document any spreadsheet, and 
create a permanent record. 

It lets you examine the logic 
behind spreadsheets "handed down" 
by previous users. 

And generates formats that can be 
followed by other users later. 

Other company benefits. 

In companies where several people 
are using spreadsheets, a series of 
listings can grow to become an 
application's library. 

The AUDITOR makes sure 
everyone knows what spreadsheets 
have been developed, so no-one 
wastes time reinventing the wheel. 

The perfect teaching tool. 

The AUDITOR helps new users to 
learn spreadsheet building tech- 
niques quickly because it displays 
the formulas behind the numbers. 

Printouts also show what formulas 
to type into any given grid location. 

Put the Auditor on your side. 

If you're making responsible financial 
or corporate decisions based on 
spreadsheets, you can't afford to be 
without the AUDITOR one more day. 



THE 



A small price to pay 

Best of all the AUDITOR costs 
just $99. 

And that's a small price to pay for 
spreadsheets you know are right.

How a 
fireman 
anda 
broken 
leg 
made 
soflHBre 
simple. 




^^(^That does a fireman know 
about designing software? 
Nothing. Usually. 

Meet Dennis Jarvis, a firefighter from 
Southern California. About five years ago he 
broke his leg in a fire-related accident and was 
confined to the house for about six months. To 
keep him occupied, Dennis' wife bought him a 
computer. 

Dennis had never used a computer before. 
But he proved to be a natural. 

Dennis was soon writing his own programs. 
And Basic Accounting from Firefighter was 
bom. 

It was brilliant. 

And so simple, you don't have to know 
anything about accounting theory to use it. 

But don't get the wrong idea. Just because it's 
simple, doesn't mean it's not smart, too. 

Basic Accounting from Firefighter has so many 
more features and capabilities than the best sell- 
ing accounting package, there's no room to list 
them in this ad. You'll just have to ask your 
dealer to show you. 

Dennis? He returned to the Fire Department 
soon after his leg healed, but remains the 
spearhead of Firefighter Software. 

In fact, in his never-ending efforts to make 
Firefighter the most personal, most supported 
software, Dennis has set up a telephone hotline 
to answer your questions and provide consulta- 
tion. That's just Dennis' way of insuring 
Firefighter remains superior, always simpler yet 
smarter.

INTRODUCING 
1HE 1WO-PRINTER 




MKROBUFFER 1 1 + 




Like all Microbuffer models, the Microbuffer 11+ 
eliminates waiting for your printer to finish 
before you can use your computer again. It allows 
you to print and process simultaneously. 

But the Microbuffer 11+ has one unique quality 
not found in any other Microbuffer: it can be used 
with virtually any printer— serial or parallel, or both 
at once! 

If you have an Apple II, 11+ , Il/e and more than 
one printer, Microbuffer 11+ can eliminate a 
tremendous bottleneck. 

While your parallel printer is going at fuU 
speed, your serial printer can be printing the same 
file or a different file right along with it. And you 
can be using the Apple to do something else at 
the same time. 

The Microbuffer 11+ printer interface wdll fully 
support the Apple He 80-coIumn format. And it 
allows an 80-column screen dump from the 
Videx 80-column board in your Apple n or 11+ . 

Perhaps, best of all, Microbuffer 11+ is versatile 
and smart. It supports over 30 commands for text 
formatting, sending printer controls, printing screen 
dumps and setting up the MII+ itself. AND it 
includes graphics print routines for nine popular 
printers as well as 8 additional graphics printing 
commands. Whether you have 1 printer or 2, 
Microbuffer gives you the maximum amount of 
printing flexibility in the minimum amount of time. 

The new Microbuffer II + is available now in 
16K, 32K, and 64K models. Ask your dealer for a 
demonstration, or for further information.

DAVID OURKIE 



"Try to Renumber the Kind of December. . . ." 



The approach we took to writing last month's program would be 
frowned upon in formal computer education circles. Terribly undis- 
ciplined, it was. Imagine allowing new lines to spring into a program 
willy-nilly like that! Those who study the science of computer program- 
ming are usually taught to write out the code on paper and to be certain in 
their own minds that it will run before ever visiting it upon an unwary 
computer terminal. 

My Time Is Your Time. The reason for this approach is that com- 
puter time on time-sharing systems costs money. Until about six years 
ago, time-sharing systems were practically the only game in town. 
They're still used widely in schools and businesses. 

A time-sharing system is one in which a single computer does the 
computing for several users simultaneously, with users usually working 
at separate terminals. Sometimes these terminals consist of a keyboard 
and a CRT, and they may superficially resemble a microcomputer. Other 
systems commonly use— violent shudder— Teletype machines. These 
clunky dinosaurs are rarely mistaken for anything. 

Time-sharing systems typically charge the user a double rate: a con- 
nect-time charge for the length of time (measured in real time) he is 
logged into the system, and a CPU-time rate for the amount of time his 
programs actually demand of the central processing unit. 

Obviously, it isn't a good idea, on that type of system, to waste the 
computer's time with frivolous editing and reediting of guessing game 
programs. Get it right on paper first, then type it in. Right? Fortunately, 
this commonly held wisdom doesn't apply to those of us with Apples. 
Having already paid for our computers, we can now be more concerned 
with saving our own time than saving that of the computer. 

A Technical Renaissance. Time is not even an issue for us. With an 
Apple at our beck and call, and the freedom that implies, we can think in 
terms of the art of computer programming rather than the science. 

Nevertheless, there is another good reason to think about a program 
before typing it in (if not actually writing it on paper), and it applies 
equally well to time-sharers and microphiles alike. Planning and fore- 
thought are essential to the creation of efficient programs. Also, a pro- 
gram that was well planned in the first place will be easier to modify 
later. That's why we've placed a strong emphasis on structure in this col- 
umn. The more complex a program you're planning, the more you 
should think about it before actually sitting down to write it. Consider 
what it will be like to use the program and how it can be made easier and 
more natural for the user. 

Above all, experiment. Writing the code on paper beforehand can 
discourage experimentation; just thinking about the program, however, 
promotes new, creative approaches. So don't start with the question. 



"How will I write this program?" Ask instead, "How might I write this 
program?" 

Such is the thinking that leads us to write programs by starting with a 
basic working model and then inserting the refinements, as we did last 
month. As we saw, however, this technique can lead to messy line num- 
bering. Taken to an extreme, it can lead to impossible line numbering: 
Basic won't accept 32.5 as a line number when you want to add a line be- 
tween lines 32 and 33. For this reason, the DOS System Master comes 
with a program called Renumber. 

Renumber installs a new immediate mode command in your Apple. 
Boot up the system with your System Master and type run Renumber. 
You'll get a title screen with some minimal instructions and a prompt to 
hit return. Hit return and Renumber is installed. 

To be sure that it's there (nothing really looks any different than 
usual), type an ampersand (&).This is actually the command used to re- 
number a program. You should get an error message to the effect that 
there is no program in memory. So let's put one there. Except for the 
presence of the additional command that you have just installed, your 
Apple will behave as it normally does. Enter this program: 

1 X = X + 1 

2 PRINT X 

3 IF X < 10 THEN GOTO 1 

4 END 

If you run this program, you'll find it merely counts from one to ten. Not 
quite up there with VisiCalc, but sufficient for this demonstration. 

Say, for the sake of argument, you wanted to insert a line before the 
end statement that would print "All done!" before retiring. There's no 
room for it now, but Renumber can be used to make room. Type & and 
then list the program: It will be miraculously renumbered by tens, start- 
ing at line 10. Notice that even the line number after the goto in line 30 
(formerly line 3) has been updated. The program will run just as it did 
before. 

You may have been told at some time that two programs can't be in 
memory at once, and yet it appears that Renumber and your program are 
coexisting somehow. This rule you've heard applies primarily to Basic 
programs. Although Renumber shows up as an Applesoft file type in the 
catalog, the working part of Renumber is really a machine language pro- 
gram. Machine language is what the Apple uses to think its innermost 
thoughts in. 

Running the Applesoft program called Renumber loads the machine 
language program you just used. There can be lots of machine language 
programs in memory at once: DOS, Applesoft, and the Monitor are all

machine language programs. With three big machine language programs 
already in memory, Renumber has no trouble putting its program in un- 
noticed while leaving plenty of room for Applesoft programs. 

Now, of course, the print statement can be inserted as line 35. If you 
want to make the final product look really tidy, you can type & to renum- 
ber it again, giving you lines 10 through 50. Renumber ignores the cur- 
rent pattern of line numbers; it just starts at line 10 and increments each 
subsequent line by 10 unless told to do otherwise. 

Renumber has some other features we'll consider later. At this point, 
however, let's look at a few new programming commands. 

We first encountered loops two months ago, and last month we ex- 
plored a fairly complicated loop. There are many types of loops, but the 
most coimnonly used type is one in which a single variable determines 
how many times a given set of lines is executed. The variable increments 
in value each time through the loop, and when its value reaches a certain 
point, the program stops looping and moves on to other things. The pro- 
gram that we used to demonstrate Renumber exemplifies such a loop. 

This type of loop is so common, however, that the gods invented an 
easier way to do it. The easier way is typically called afor-next loop, and 
it involves two new conamands, for and next. The loop takes this form: 

FOR variable = expression 1 TO expression 2 
program lines in loop 
NEXT variable 

A fundamental rule of the for-next loop is that every for must have a 
next. The variable used in both statements must be the same. A program 
to count from 1 to 10 like the one we looked at earlier, rewritten to use a 
for-next loop, would look like this: 

10 FOR X = 1 TO 10 
20 PRINT X 
30 NEXTX 
40 END 

In this case, the loop's index variable is X, expression 1 is the number 
1, and expression 2 is the number 10. The most obvious advantage this 
type of loop has over the if-then loop is that you can tell at the start of the 
loop, the for statement, how many times the loop will be executed and 
what the value of the variable will be each time. 

Here's how it works. When the program is running and execution 
first reaches the^r statement (line 10), the value of the variable (X) is 
set to the value of the first expression (1). Control passes to the following 
line just as it normally would. When the next statement (line 30) is 
reached, the value of the variable (X) is incremented by 1 . A check is 
made to see if the variable is less than or equal to the value of the second 
expression. If it is, the program loops back to the statement immediately 
following the /or statement (line 20). Otherwise, control passes to the 
statement following the next statement (line 40). 

Thirty Days Hath September. . • . The two expressions in the for 
statement don't have to be numbers. They can be variables or they can be 
more complicated expressions, such as 3 * B a 2. If you wanted to be 
able to list all the days in a month, for instance, but didn't know in ad- 
vance which month you would be listing, you could set the variable ND 
to the number of days in that month and start a loop with: 

100 FOR D = 1 TO ND 

The for-next loop normally increments the variable by 1 each time 
through, but it doesn't have to work that way. There's an optional pa- 
rameter that can be used to indicate the desired increment. It's called the 
step, and when used it's placed at the end of the /or statement. When the 
step parameter is used, the statement takes the form: 

FOR variable = expression 1 TO expression 2 STEP expression 3 

The third expression is evaluated and used as the number to add to the 
variable each time the next statement is executed. 

Here's an example of how you might use the step parameter: You 
want to list every Friday in a given month (let's say you get paid on Fri- 
day). Set ND to the number of days in the month, as before, set FF to the 
date of the first Friday in that month, and use the following/or statement: 

100 FOR D = FF TO ND STEP 7 

This month, the first Friday is December 2, so FF would be set to 2; 
and there are thirty-one days, so ND would be set to 31. 



Now try this program out: 

10 FF = 2 
20 ND = 31 

100 FOR D = FF TO ND STEP 7 
110 PRINT "Friday, December ";D;' 
120 NEXTD 
130 END 



1983' 



Save this program on your Floating Point disk as Friday. 1. 

Thank God It's Friday. Here's how it works: Lines 10 and 20 set 
the values for the first Friday and the number of days in the month. 
When we hit line 100, D is set to FF, the date of the first Friday, which 
is equal to 2. Applesoft has also been told to keep in mind that the step 
for the loop is 7. Line 110 prints out, "Friday, December 2, 1983." 
When line 120, next D, is reached, Applesoft remembers the value of the 
step, 7, and adds it to D. So, D now equals 9. Next it checks to see if 9 
is less than or equal to ND, which is 31. Since it is, the program loops 
back, prints, "Friday, December 9, 1983," and hits the next statement 
again. After a few times through the loop, D will equal 30. When line 
120 is executed, the step value is again added to D, making D equal 37. 
The check is made, and 37 is found to be greater than ND, so control is 
passed on to line 130, which ends the program. 

A few additional facts about the for-next loop are worth noting. The 
value after step can be a negative number. If it is, then expression 1 must 
be greater than expression 2, because the value of the variable will count 
down instead of up. If the step is negative, the next statement will check 
to see if the loop variable is greater than or equal to the second expres- 
sion; if it is, the next statement will loop back. 

In Search of the Great Nested Loop. For-next loops can be used in 
pairs, but only if you follow certain rules. The accompanying figure 
shows two right ways to pair loops and one wrong way. The first way is 
simply to have one loop follow the other: X counts from 1 to 10 and then 
Y counts from 1 to 10. The second way is called nesting loops (sounds 
like a species of bird, doesn't it?): X counts from 1 to 10, and while X 
holds at each value, Y counts from 1 to 10. The entire Y loop is executed 
ten times. Anything inside the Y loop — between the second and third 
lines of the example— is executed one hundred times. The third way is il- 
legal and will cause a next without for error.

FOR Y = 1 TO 10 rf-*- FOR Y = 1 TO 10

Pairs of Loops 



■ NEXT Y 



There are two major concepts in Applesoft that are closely tied to the 
concept of the for-next loop. These are the subscripted variable and the 
read and data commands. (The next section of this article will purport to be 
about expanding our Friday program to list all the Fridays in 1983. Just 
between us, there exists no real reason to do this on the computer. List- 
ing dates is one of the many wonderful things that calendars can do for 
you. Nevertheless, bear with this folly, because the goal here is not to 
find out how to list all the Fridays in 1983 but in fact to discover how 
subscripted variables and read and data statements can help us do 
it. Okay?) 

The Annual Report. Let's say, for instance, that we want to expand 
our Friday program to list all of the Fridays in 1983. Remember, to list 
all of the Fridays in one month we had to know the number of days in that 
month (ND) and the date of the first Friday (FF). To do this for each 
month of the year, we have to know this information for each month of 
the year. What we need is something like a variable that can be used for 
keeping lists. Fortunately, Applesoft has just such a beast (how many of 
you saw this coming?). It's called the subscripted variable. 

The subscripted variable works like this. Let's say, a long time ago, 
that Mr. and Mrs. Tyler had four children, Mark, Mary, Maura, and 
Maurice. With names like those, it's no wonder the Tylers had trouble 
remembering which child was which. 

Mrs. Tyler was a very orderly person: If they had had computers in 
her day she would have invented Pascal. One day, she came up with a 
plan to keep her children straight. Instead of calling her children by their 
names, she would call them by numbers.

Four in Array. Thus Mark, Mary, Maura, and Maurice became 1, 
2, 3, and 4 respectively. All confusion was eliminated until the idea 
caught on and soon all the neighborhood children were called by num- 
ber. So the Tyler children became Tyler(l), Tyler(2), Tyler(3), and Ty- 
ler(4). This solved all their problems except when relatives came to visit, 
but that's another story. Mr. and Mrs. Tyler were the proud parents of 
the world's first subscripted kids. 

Getting back to the example of the Friday program, we can make the 
program applicable to all the months of 1983 by setting up two sub- 
scripted variables named FF and ND and indexing them by the month 
number. The word used to describe all the subscripted variables that 
have the same name is array, so FF and ND are both array names. First 
we need to reserve twelve slots in each of the two arrays. This process is 
called dimensioning the array, and it is done with the dim statement. Add 
this line to Friday. 1 : 

10 DIM ND(12), FF(12) 

The dim command is always followed by the name of the array, along 
with the number of elements to be used in the array in parentheses. A 
single dim statement can be used to dimension more than one array. Each 
subsequent array to be dimensioned must be preceded by a comma, as 
shown. 

Actually, this line will reserve thirteen slots in each array, because 
the indexes start at zero instead of one. Since the twelve months of the 
year are usually numbered from 1 to 12 and not from 0 to 1 1 , we'll bow 
to tradition and leave the ND(0) and FF(0) slots unused. Another thing 
worth knowing about arrays is that if you start to refer to a subscripted 
variable before dimensioning the array, Applesoft will automatically 
dimension the array to eleven slots numbered 0 through 10. 

Even if you are planning to use fewer than eleven slots in an array, 
it's a good idea to dimension the array first. This saves memory space 
(which is not an important consideration now but may be later) and 
serves as a reminder of what the array is being used for. It's also a good 
idea to dimension the array early in the program, preferably in the first 
few lines. This gives you an easy place to find it if you forget its dimen- 
sions or if you need to change those dimensions. 

Now we have to fill these arrays with the requisite numbers. We 
could do this with a line like: 

20 ND(1) = 31: ND(2) = 28: ND(3) = 31: ND(4) = 30 

and so on, with one assignment for each of the twenty-four values 
needed. This would be inefficient and boring to type. Instead, we'll take 
advantage of a very important, but hitherto undisclosed, aspect of sub- 
scripted variables. The index in parentheses doesn't have to be a number; 
it can be any arithmetic expression. Which means, of course, that it can 
be a variable. This fact is what makes for-next loops so popular among 
the subscripted variable crowd. And this is also where read and data 
come in. 

"The Data, Ma'am, Just the Data." Read and data work as part- 
ners. Data holds a list of information, and read picks pieces of informa- 
tion from that list one piece at a time and puts them into a specified 
variable. 

Let's start with data. The following two lines, added to the Friday 
program, establish our lists of the number of days in a month and the first 
Friday of each month: 

200 DATA 31 ,28,31 ,30,31 ,30,31 ,31 ,30,31 ,30,31 
210 DATA 7,4,4,1,6,3,1,5.2,7,4,2 

The syntax of the data statement is simple. The data command must 
be followed by a list of items separated by commas. In this case the items 
are all numbers; some other time you'll see how words can be used in da- 
ta statements. There can be any number of items in a data statement, but 
the length of the line, like that of all lines in Applesoft, is limited to 239 
characters. The last item should not be followed by a comma. Finally, a 
data statement can't be followed by any other kind of statement on the 
same line. It is typical to put data statements at the end of the program, as 
we have done here. 

To get to and use the data in a data statement, you need a read state- 
ment. In a read statement, the word read is followed by one or more var- 
iable names. Imagine a pointer in the program, pointing at the first piece 
of data in the first data statement. The first time a read statement is ex- 
ecuted, the piece of data indicated by the pointer is placed in the first 



variable in the read statement and the pointer advances to the next piece 
of data. If there is another variable name in the read statement, the next 
piece of data is read into it, the pointer is moved again, and so on. If a 
read is executed and there is no more data to read, the program will 
break with an out of data error. So programs should be set up with one 
and only one read for each piece of data. 

By this point it should be clear that the best way to read data into an 
array is to use a for-next loop. Therefore, the next lines we add to the 
program should look like this: 

20 FOR M = 1 TO 12: READ ND(M): NEXT M 
30 FOR M = 1 TO 12: READ FF(M): NEXT M 

Note that each line contains an entire for-next loop. This is perfectly 
legal. It is, in fact, one of the situations in which using multiple statement 
lines makes the program easier to read. 

These most recent additions have wiped out our old lines 10 and 20, 
which is fine because our new lines are taking over the function of those 
lines too. Now let's establish the major loop— the one that will represent 
the months of the year. 

40 FOR M = 1 TO 12 
125 NEXTM 

This loop is nested around the loop that prints all the Fridays in one 
month. Now we have merely to modify the inner loop to make it apply to 
whichever month we want. This is accomplished by changing lines 100 
and 1 10: 

100 FOR D = FF(M) TO ND(M) STEP 7 
110 PRINT "Friday "; M; ■'/"; D; '783" 

The changes to line 100 reflect the fact that we're now using sub- 
scripted variables instead of simple variables. What this means is that the 
beginning and end of the loop will be determined by the specific data for 
the month specified by the variable M. 

In line 110 we've simply changed the output to reflect the varying 
months. The new output will look like "Friday 1/7/83." We aren't yet 
ready to go into how you could get the names of the months to come up; 
that will be covered in a future installment. 

The current version of the program now looks like this: 

10 DIM ND(12), FF(12) 

20 FOR M = 1 TO 12: READ ND(M): NEXT M 
30 FOR M = 1 TO 12: READ FF(M): NEXT M 
40 FOR M = 1 TO 12 
100 FOR D = FF(M) TO ND(M) STEP 7 
110 PRINT "Friday "; M; "/"; D; "/83" 
120 NEXTD 
125 NEXTM 
130 END 

200 DATA 31 ,28,31 ,30,31 ,30,31 ,31 ,30,31 ,30,31 
210 DATA 7,4,4,1,6,3,1,5,2,7,4,2 

Let's close with a discussion of how to use the more advanced 
features of Renumber to make the line numbering of this program look a 
little more professional. Those advanced features are a set of four param- 
eters that tell Renumber what part of a program to change and what the 
new line numbers should be. They can be used in any order and none of 
them is required. 

Each parameter has an automatic value that is used if nothing else is 
specified. This is called a default value. (Think of the word default as in 
"winning by default," not as in going bankrupt, and it will seem less 
threatening.) 

The first two parameters, S and E, define the start and end of the sec- 
tion to renumber, in terms of the old line numbers. The defaults for these 
parameters are the beginning and end of the program, which is why just 
hitting & alone renumbers the entire program. 

The next parameter is the first new line number (F). This indicates 
what the first renumbered line will have as its new number. The default 
for this parameter is 10. 

The final parameter is the increment (I) for the new line numbers, 
which of course determines what the new numbers will be for all the 
lines following the first renumbered line. The default increment is 10. 

These parameters are used together following the & to express any 
possible renumber operation. Let's put this information to use. First of

all, save the Friday program as Friday. 2. It's advisable to save your pro- 
gram before renumbering it on the chance that something should go 
wrong during the renumbering process. 

If you've been following this article without interruption. Renumber 
should still be in memory. (If it isn't, you should run Renumber from the 
System Master disk and then load Friday. 2 from your Floating Point 
disk.) Test for Renumber' s presence by typing &I0. This tells Renumber 
to renumber the whole program, incrementing the line numbers by zero. 
This operation is blatandy illegal, and if Renumber is still present and 
healthy it will chastise you with an error message. 

With everything set up and ready to go, let's begin. Friday. 2 can be 
logically divided into three sections: initialization (lines 10 through 30), 
the actual working loops (lines 40 through 130), and the data (lines 200 
and 210). Since the data is read by the initialization section, it would 
make more sense to have it in the same section of the program. We could 
then use the program's line numbers to distinguish the initialization rou- 
tine from the working routine. 

Here's how we do it. First, let's set up the working routine starting at 
line 100. This would be accomplished by the command: 

&S40, El 30, F100 

This command takes the section from line 40 through line 130 and re- 
numbers it to 100 through 150, incrementing by 10. So far, so good. 
Now all we need to do is move the data down to line 40, right after the 
initialization routine. 

& S200, F40 

The E parameter was unnecessary in this case because we were re- 
numbering from line 200 to the end of the program. This example shows 
how renumber can be used to move sections of the program from one 
place to another. It won't move other lines that already exist within the 
target range out of the way, so you should be sure the new line number 
range is unoccupied. Moving sections around in the program can make 
the program run incorrectly. Moving the data statements in a block like 
this is usually safe. Nevertheless, that's another good reason to save a

program before you start renumbering it. 

Homework, Uggh! At this point you have enough Applesoft under 
your belt to begin to write programs of your own. Learning to program is 
like learning a language (as we've stated before): You have to use it to 
learn it. You can repeat "the pen of my aunt" sentences in some French 
class until you're bleu in the face, but you won't learn nearly as much 
French doing that for a year as you will spending a day in Paris looking 
for a public restroom. 

This column cannot instill in you that sense of need to write in Apple- 
soft, but it can give you some possible subject matter. Here are three sug- 
gested projects to keep you busy until next month. 

1. Friday. 2 can be improved, ft is possible, if you know the date of 
the first Friday of the year and the number of days in each month, to cal- 
culate the dates of the first Friday of each month "on the fly." This 
would eliminate the need for the FF array and make it possible to alter 
the program to cover any year by changing the line that sets the first Fri- 
day of the year. Hint: If you want to get fancy, don't forget leap years. 

2. Try creating a program that simulates a digital clock. Have it do 
hours, minutes, and seconds, ftiitially, you may have difficulty getting 
the program to go as slow as a real clock. Try putting in an empty for- 
next loop to slow it down and see how accurate you can get it. 

3. This is the hardest one. In the first article of this column (Septem- 
ber 1983), there appeared a flow chart for a sorting routine and a 
description of how the routine would work. You now have all the com- 
mands you need to write such a routine. You'll need to enter data into an 
array, sort it, and print out the sorted list. You can use read and data to 
fill the array or generate a list of random numbers with the commands 
from last month. There'll be lots of for-next loops in this one. 

That's it for this time. Until next year, remember to run carefully 
during the holiday season. HI 



GLOSSARY 

Array: A variable that can hold a list of numbers instead of just a 
single number. The several elements of the array are 
distinguished from one another by their index numbers, which 
follow the array name in parentheses. 

DATA: Indicates the beginning of a list of items within an Ap- 
plesoft program. The items in the list may be retrieved with a 
read statement. 

Default: The value used for a parameter in a command if that pa- 
rameter is not specified. 

DIM: Applesoft command to dimension an array variable. Fol- 
lowed by the array name and, in parentheses, the number of 
elements to be used in the array. 

FOR-NEXT loop: A loop in an Applesoft program defined by the 
for statement at the beginning and the next statement at the end. 
Using a variable as an index, it assigns a value to the variable, 
increments that value each time through the loop, and exits the 
loop when the value passes a certain ceiling value. 

Index: In arrays, the number in parentheses that follows the vari- 
able name, indicating which element of the array is being 
referred to. In for-next loops, the variable that increments each 
time through the loop. 

Nested loops: A pair of loops arranged in such a way that one loop 
is inside another. The iimer loop will be executed in its entirety 
during each pass of the outer loop. 

READ: Gets the piece of data within a data statement that is in- 
dicated by an internal data pointer, assigns its value to the in- 
dicated variable, and moves the pointer to the next piece of 
data. 

Renumber: A program on the DOS System Master disk to alter 
the line numbering of an Applesoft program. Renumber resides 
in memory concurrently with Applesoft programs. 

STEP: An optional parameter in a for-next loop. Used at the end 
of the for statement, it determines the increment of the index 
variable each time through the loop. 

Subscripted variable: A variable within an array. It is referred to 
by its array name followed by its index number, or an arithmetic 
expression representing its index number, in parentheses.

Gumball. By Robert Cook and Doug Carlston. Is Broderbund's latest 
arcade-style forehead-pounder just another maddening game or a satirical 
comment on the Great American Dream of climbing the corporate lad- 
der? Does it teach players good work habits and start them on the road 
to success, or does it teach them to dance with the joystick and wobble 
their eyes like overcharged Disneyesque automatons? 

Gumball puts players in the position of workers in a gumball factory. 
On the first level, the task is to catch a combination of eight green or blue 
gumballs in corresponding blue and green bins. The gumballs come 
down a chute in the upper left-hand comer of the screen and wind their 
way through a maze of other chutes equipped with various trap doors 



that, when opened at the proper moment, direct the gumballs into the 
proper bins. 

On each level, the workload consists of catching gumballs in the 
proper bins. On level two, you must catch a combination of eighteen 
blue, green, and orange gumballs in three different bins. On level three, 
that increases to four different-colored gumballs totaling twenty-nine. 
Players are given a speeded-up workday of eight fifteen-second hours in 
which to meet their quota of gumballs. A clock keeps the time at the top 
of the screen; a four o'clock warning whistle lets the player know there's 
only a few seconds left to meet the quota. Players can also adjust the 
speed of the production line (speeding up the flow of gumballs is essen- 
tial on the higher levels). 

On all levels, quality control is rigidly enforced. If the player allows 
a blue gumball to fall in a green bin, this hi-res creep called Mr. Nit- 
picker comes over and dumps the cart on its side, spilling out all the 
gumballs accumulated so far. In addition, rotten white gumballs occa- 
sionally come off the production line. If you let one of them fall in a bin, 
the annoying Mr. Nitpicker makes another visit. Then, to make matters 
even more complicated, for every four good gumballs that you miss or 
that fall uncollected, your work quota is increased by one gumball. 



DECEMBER 1983 SQPTALkW 339 



The game's main occupational hazard appears in levels four and 
beyond. Every so often, a particularly rotten, explosive white gumball 
comes off the production line— deranged dental assistants have put dyna- 
mite in the sugar supply— and you have mere seconds to deactivate it be- 
fore it blows up the factory and ends the game. 

So Gumball teaches us about workloads, quality control, and occupa- 
tional hazards. But what about incentive? GumbaWs creators have come 
up with a cute way of handling that. Each time you complete a level (meet 
the quota before the five o'clock whistle blows), you're given a promo- 
tion and then a short, animated routine appears that shows the worker 
walking home from the factory. For each successfully completed level 
and each promotion, the worker is given a bigger house. After level one, 
the worker goes home to something resembling a phone booth, but by 
the end of level three that cubicle has become a swank one-story sub- 
urban home. After that? Well, as they say, a man's home is his castle. . . . 

If nervous energy and endless rounds of the joystick twist are the re- 
quirements for achieving success in corporate America, then Gumball 
marks Broderbund's entry into the multi-billion-dollar corporate training 
market. As a mere game, Gumball will make you twist again like you did 
last summer (or the other day, as the case may be). DH

Mad Rat. By Logan Zintsmaster. If Mad Rat were an old movie, its en- 
try in "Your Handy Guide to TV Movies" would probably have two and 
a half stars next to the title, be dated at around 1963 or so, and be written 
up something like this: "The Mouse is up to its usual slapstick antics, 
this time in a department store, scrambling for chunks of cheese and 
outsmarting the Cat. Mildly amusing comedy for the younger set and 
fans of the Mouse." 

But wait! Is this really a B-disk, an arcade second feature, fated to 
play for a couple of weeks out in the sticks and end its days on the drive- 
in circuit? Probably. But after that, it could easily come back as a 
rediscovered classic and live forever (six months or so) as a cult com- 
puter game. Yes, what at first glance appears to be a pretty dreadftil little 
item reveals, as play progresses, the small, exquisite surprise of turning 
out to be a pretty challenging game. 

Comparisons of the design to Sierra On-Line's revised Jawbreaker II 
are inevitable but irrelevant. This game does not play or feel like that. 
Maintaining your rodent equilibrium on the six moving sidewalks that 
comprise the screen while on your quest for cheese takes special finesse 
and timing. And making the best use of the apertures in each sliding floor 
whUe avoiding the cat and the death hole at the bottom is not as easy as it 
looks. On the higher levels, you can plunge right through six floors to 
your demise before you make a move. On still higher levels, the speed of 
the escalators and the multiplicity of cats will freeze that smile of benign 
indulgence on your face. Just as you get hooked, it gets impossible. 

The title is derived from the hardy old Pac-Manian hunter-tums-the- 
hunted device. Jumping up to the top floor when the "superizzor" ap- 
pears gives you some serious mouse muscle, fangs, and a cape. You may 
then proceed to the nearest cat and have at it. 

The music, several insistent bars of "Three Blind Mice," is the most 
serious drawback to this game, but that's what detachable speaker con- 
nections were made for. 

It's a simple, nay, crude affair. The only controls are right, left, and 
up. But the simplicity is the point. It works. This is a game that you'll 
pop into the drive late at night when no one is around and play for hours. 
Then you'll tuck it away in the back of your file and leave Zaxxon out 
when you have company. A(

Music Construction Set. By Will Harvey. Its very name is a tip-off to 
how easy it is to use. Like Bill Budge's pinball-generating software toy, 
the Music Construction Set offers much of the same— simplicity in 
building complex designs. 

Using it to compose music is as easy as ordering food from a pastry 
cart. Find what you want, pick it up, and put it where you want it. Music 
Construction Set's cursor is the familiar gloved hand from Pinball Con- 
struction Set. However, nonjoystick composers can opt to use the "A," 
"Z," and arrow keys as well. KoalaPad owners have it even easier; 
moving the cursor is as easy as pointing to the desired icon and pressing 
a button. 

MCS's icons (pictures that define functions) are self-explanatory; ar- 



row icons scroll the music left and right; the house icon moves the com- 
poser name to the beginning of the piece; the piano icon plays the compo- 
sition; the scissors cut; the paste jar pastes. 

In terms of building melodies and chords, MCS doesn't offer any 
capabilities that aren't available in other music software, but it does offer 
simplicity. Suppose the composer wants to build a C-major chord. Just 
move the pointing cursor over to the note of desired length (whole, half, 
quarter, eighth, and sixteenth notes are possible), pick it up, and plop it 
down on the staff where C goes; repeat the procedure for E, G, and the 
top C and we have a chord. 

The ease with which one can pick up notes and rests and move them 
around is standard in MCS; where the program really begins to shine is in 
its extras. The cut-and-paste feature is one of its most powerful tools. It's 
likely that any musical composition will have phrases or bass lines that 
repeat. Instead of having to construct those passages note for note each 
time they're needed, the scissors cursor cuts out as many as eight meas- 
ures at a time and stores them in a buffer. Then, the composer has but to 
move the paste bottle cursor to the desired spot and, with the push of a 
button, the passage is reproduced. 

The buffer holds whatever measures were cut last. That means it's 
possible to cut measures from one song, load another song from disk, 
and paste the measures down in that song. 

MCS can transpose (up or down) from one key to another and can 
change clefs in the middle of a song, a feature that comes in handy when 
the treble clef can't accommodate a low note. 

One thing MCS doesn't have is a lot of memory space. The program 
is so large that there's little room left to store composed works. Though 
there's enough memory to hold seven hundred notes on each staff, that 
doesn't amount to much more than seventy measures when three- and 
four-note chords are part of the composition. 

Something else that's missing is the capability to change time and key 
signatures in the middle of a piece. That's not a vital feature, but it's one 
that advanced composers will miss. 

MCS can send two-voice music through the Apple's speaker, and 
with a Sweet Micro Systems Mockingboard Sound/Speech I it's possible 
to create three-voice music. However, to get the most out of this pro- 
gram. Sweet Micro Systems's yet-unnamed new Mockingboard is 
recommended; it cranks out six-voice music— in stereo. 

It's important to note that MCS assumes the composer has no musical 
knowledge. Electronic Arts has included a brief yet thorough primer on 
the basics of music and music theory that amounts to a semester's worth 
of work in any beginning music class. Experienced musicians may find 
the manual unnecessary; beginners will find it a godsend. 

Electronic Arts has also left MCS\ music-generating routine open to 
the user. This means that all songs created with MCS are stored as binary 
files and can be copied and traded as such. With the program's Music file 
in memory, songs can be bloaded and then called from Basic programs. 
Music plays independent of the 6502, meaning that once the music is 
playing, the Apple can go ahead with other functions— running pro- 
grams, word processing, printing, or whatever. 

Lots of credit should go to Jim Nitchals, whose help on MC5's rou- 
tines for putting music through the Apple speaker will be fully appreci- 
ated by those without Mockingboards. 

Because the pluses make the minuses almost nonexistent. Music Con- 
struction Set makes a wonderful learning device for music students, an 
excellent tool for programmers wishing to incorporate musical routines 
in their programs, and an entertaining toy for dabblers in the art of 
music. mv

Bouncing Kamungas. By Thomas Becklund. A bulletin just off the UPI 
wire reports that the farmers of the Dakota melon industry have been 
caught in a nightmarish siege that could threaten much of the country if 
not stopped. 

The threat, in the form of a newly evolved, quasi-intelligent life form 
that inhabitants call the Kamunga, has emerged from the unique 
characteristics of the Dakota environment to wreak havoc throughout 
Dakota's famous melon industry. 

Farm union labor leader Preston Penn Guin describes the calamity. 
"It's hard enough on our boys just having to go around planting seeds, 
harvesting crops, and driving into town, what with them pesky weather 
snakes ruining our entire harvest if you so much as look at 'em cross- 



IF YOU'RE CONFUSED 

ABOUT BUYING A 
PERSONAL COMPUTER, 

I'SSOMEHELB 




Computers come in two parts. 

One part is the "hardware',' the 
machinery itself. The other is the 
"software!' which tells a computer 
what to do, the way a driver teUs a 
car what to do. 

Without software, a computer 
can't do anything. And vice versa. 
You have to buy both. 
Buy the software first 

Since the reason you're buying a 
computer is to get the capability 
the software gives you (remember 
it's the software that teUs the com- 
puter what to do) , it makes good 
sense to pick the software first. 

Start by making a list of the 
things you want the computer 
to do. Possibilities include word 
processing, inventory control, 
accounting, graphics, recordkeep- 
ing-you name it, there's probably 
software that does it. 

Next take your list into a com- 
puter store and ask the salesper- 
son to demonstrate software that 
will do the things you want. 

Even though you'U need a com- 
puter for the demonstration, keep 
m mind the computer is just a 
vehicle. The software is the driver. 
Once you've decided on software, 
pickmg the rest of the computer 
system wiU be that much easier. 
The simpler the better. 

Some people will teU you that 
software has to be complicated to 
be powerful. Nothing could be fur- 
ther from the truth. 

Good personal software should 
be, as the computer people say, 
"friendly." Meaning that it helps you 
do what you want to do without get- 
ting m the way. 

Good software keeps the com- 
plications in the computer, where 



they belong. And keeps the capa- 
bility at your fingertips. It's that 
simple. 

Simply see for yoursell 

You can read any number of 
interesting books and mag- 
azines about personal 
computers.You can 
ask your friends 
who have 
them. 



Or look 
at all 
the sales 
literature 
you can get 
your hands on. 

But as helpful as 
that can be, there's 
no substitute for a live 
demonstration. 

When you do go shop- 
ping, we recommend 
you take a look at 
thePFS" Family 
of Software. 

Designed 
the way we 
think a soft- 
ware family 
should be: 
simple, 

straightforward 
and powerful. 



Currently there are four software 
packages in the family: PFS:WRITE, 
PFSPILE, PFS:REPORT andPFS: 
GRAPH, with more on the way. 
Here's a little more about each of 
them, 

PFS:WRITE. The simplest way 
to get yom message across. 

PFS;WRITE is ideal for people 
who want to make their writing time 
more productive. It displays what 
you write on your computer screen 
so you can make revisions as you 
compose. 

With WRITE, you can correct mis- 
spellings or substitute one portion 
of text for another, with just a few 
keystrokes. 

And when you're through revising, 
WRITE shows you "on-screen"just 
how your document wiU look 
when it's printed. So there 
are no surprises afterwards. 

WRITE also works with 
most popular software pro- ,4 
grams, including the PFS 
Family of Software. 

This feature allows you to add 
names and addresses from mailing 
lists to generate form letters. Or 
combine columns of numbers or 
graphs with your text. 

^LPFS:FILE.The simplest 
^^way to get orgaxuzed. 

^^^FEjE is basically a paper filing 
^^^k system without the paper. So 
J^^r you can record, file, retrieve 
l^^r and review information in a 
fraction of the time it takes with a 
conventional filing system. 

With FILE, you arrange your 
information on a "form" you design 
yourself. And when you need to 
track something down, FILE sorts 
through your records electronically. 
It lets you retrieve information in a 
variety of ways so you can be as 
selective as you want. 

PFS: REPORT. The simplest 
way to sum it all up. 

REPORT is a powerful analysis 
tool that works with FILE . 

REPORT sorts through your files 
and retrieves the information you're 
looking for. Then assembles it all 
into one report, so you can analyze, 
plan and make better-informed 
decisions. 

REPORT is also good at math. It 
quickly sorts through columns of 
numbers and performs calcula- 
tions, so you won't have to. 




PFS:GRAPH. 
The simplest 
way to spot trends. 

GRAPH is ideaUy suited for 
professionals who need charts or 
graphs in a hurry. 

An you do is specify the kind of 
graph or chart you want and enter the 
information. GRAPH does the rest. 

GRAPH transforms columns of 
facts and figures into pie, line and 
bar charts so you can spot trends 
quickly and make better-informed 
decisions. 

GRAPH works with PFS: 
WRITE, PFS:FILE,VisiCalc® 
files or data entered directly

eyed. That's not even mentioning those Peronie varmints all over the 
streets." 

When asked to describe the Peronies, Guin flashed a toothless grin 
and replied, "Where you been? Them critters has been hidin' on our 
highways fer months. Clever little beggars, too. Look like potholes, see, 
'til ya hit one. Shakes the truck up real bad and we lose a lot of melons 
that way. Don't bother them none, though. They just grab what fruit falls 
off and make off with 'em. They can't do nothin' 'less yer drivin' fast. 
Course most of our farmers like to get to the market pretty quick; helps 
to keep the prices up." 

Another victim interviewed, a farmer named Dusty Barnes, describes 
what he saw. "It's just like Preston says. We're out there planting and 
harvesting, when suddenly, without hardly a sound, these Kamungas 
come raining down out of the sky. Few at first, then more and more, 
smashing our crops like it was the thing to do. A big grin on their ugly 
faces too. Gives me the creeps just thinking about them. 

"If they get you on the head," Barnes warns, "that's all she wrote. 
They'll drive you clean into the ground. Saves the widow the price of a 
funeral, though, so's I guess it ain't too bad a way to go." 

"Is there no defense against this despicable onslaught?" the UPI 
reporter asks. 

"Sure there is," Barnes answers brightly. "We just skewer them 
suckers on our pitchforks, like so." He gestures, lunging upward with 
his pitchfork. "You gotta be careful, though. If you hold your pitchfork 
up fer too long, crack! Lightning's apt to get you! I seen a lot of good 
boys go that way; it ain't pretty." 

In a related story, military research liaison Major I.M. Dumm 
categorically denies any connection linking the military's experimenta- 
tion with genetically engineered defoliating agents and the bouncing 
beasts, saying only, "We're looking for a few good men to come and put 
an end to the scourge plaguing our great Dakota farmers — these bounc- 
ing Kamungas must be stopped!"

Gnosis VII. By Gary W. Cuba. The word gnosis comes from a Greek 
word meaning knowledge, investigation. In English, it has the connota- 
tion of special or higher knowledge. Gnosis VII, therefore, is a game of 
knowledge, of interpreting and analyzing events and identifying reality, 
all of which leads to successful living. 

In other words. Gnosis II is a large, interactive logic puzzle. It 
works, it's fascinating, and it's fun. 

It's also eternally replay able because the events and circumstances 
are randomly generated each time that it's played. But the most fun are 
the times you play Gnosis VII before you understand it. (Go ahead and 
read the instruction book; on purpose, it won't give you much help.) 

The goal is to learn the secret names of the seven gods that take turns 
ruling over each of seven villages and, having learned those, to learn the 
one word of power. Now don't quit reading just because you had more 
than your fill of the occult during the sixties; this is a game of logic, 
remember? It just sounds arcane. 

Everything goes in sevens. Within the seven villages are seven poten- 
tial occupations by which to earn a living, seven materials available for 
creating worship offerings, seven skills to be learned, and seven boons 
with which to win sanctuaries. Boons are gifts to be made with the appro- 
priate material by someone with the appropriate skill— things like arks 
(material, wood; skill, carpentry; experience, timber cutting), temples 
(stone, architecture, rock hewing), and odes (parchment, writing, library 
work). Offering the appropriate boon in a village where that object is 
revered makes that village a sanctuary for you. Only when you worship 
gods in a sanctuary will they reveal to you their secret names. 

You know from the start that the gods rule the villages and influence 
their customs. But how and what to do with that is part of what must be 
learned. The game comes with logic-chart worksheets, which you're en- 
couraged to photocopy. Scratch paper is useful too. Try things and 
deduce from them; theorize and test your theories. Eventually, you'll 
understand. Because the player's lifetime is limited to a relatively normal 
span, it takes several games to see the full power of the sun. 

Once you understand how this strange land works, the game becomes 
one of gaining knowledge quickly and scoring the most possible points in 



a lifetime. There are obstacles, which is where the five (not seven) levels 
of difficulty come into play. The player must move from town to town 
each turn, except when learning a skill or when too broke (traveling costs 
money), and the highways are dangerous. Thieves lurk ready to steal 
cash, angry, evil emanations from gods withdraw blessings and materials, 
and illness forces loss of precious time for recovery. Specific pieces of 
knowledge overcome each peril, but knowledge is hard to come by. The 
higher the difficulty level, the more problems arise, and the greater the 
challenge to discover the word of power in one lifetime. 

Magnetic Harvest is an interesting company. Not only does it not pro- 
tect its disks, it includes in its documentation the range of line numbers 
for each routine in its programs. The people at Magnetic Harvest want 
computer users to learn about the computer and programming; and they 
hold and act on a strong conviction of the goodness of us. Their first pro- 
gram, Planetmaster, was interesting but lacked playability. Gnosis VII is 
fascinating and eminently playable; with its arrival, we can form a strong 
conviction about the goodness of this company's work— and look for- 
ward eagerly to the innovations it will bring us in the future. 

The word of power that makes Gnosis VII tick is reason. n(T

HomeWord. By Ken Williams and Jeff Stephenson. Throughout 
history, images and symbols have graphically described what speech and 
the written tongue sometimes confuse. Imagery to indicate an idea, an 
action, has made its way into computing. Apple's Lisa software sports 
crisply detailed icons that manage all manner of operations, each clearly 
representing the processes it champions. 

HomeWord brings icons to word processing for Apple lis. 

But some of HomeWord' s icons aren't too clear in defining the proce- 
dures they represent. So, each icon has a written caption. Hmmm. Oh 
well, the captions save the day for an otherwise excellent home-use word 
processor. And, after you're used to them, the icons do their job. It's 
especially nice to move the cursor to an icon, hit return, and get exactly 
where you wanted to go. 

One very innovative icon is the page sketch that appears in a lower 
comer of the screen as you're writing or editing. It's a tiny reproduction 
of the formatted version of the page you're working on, complete with 
margins, indents, and spacing — a minipreview of the final document. A 
one-pixel cursor moves through the page sketch so you can always see 
where you are in the overall picture. If you choose to center a paragraph, 
the edit screen indicates in words where the centering begins and ends; 
simultaneously, that paragraph is actually centered on the page sketch. 

If lines can be considered icons, two more are nice. One horizontal 
line shortens as the computer memory fills, and another shortens as the 
data disk fills. 

HomeWord' s other features go beyond those of other home-use word 
processors. You can mix types of text— bold, underlined, or regular— 
and there's plenty of flexibility in defining page formatting and printer 
interface. You can also see your document on-screen in its printed for- 
mat before prindng— full-size. 

An excellent feature uncommon even in powerful word processors is 
the outline format capability. Either while writing or while formatting, 
you can call for several levels of outline indentation simply by indicating 
the level of indent. If you already have items under that heading, the in- 
dent is automatically moved in another notch. Take an indent out, and all 
lower-level indents adjust. 

Documentation is complete on an audio cassette, so you can listen 
and try out what you learn as you hear it. The lessons are easy to compre- 
hend and productive. Yes, there's a printed version for inveterate read- 
ers. With HomeWord' s many truly fine features, the matter of the icons 
and text screen display need not be an issue. 

HomeWord is inexpensive, targeted for the home and for the entire 
family. Without a doubt, it is a viable entry into this currently limited 
market. IKil-

Let's look at it from three viewpoints. As a child's game, it looks like

this: a really neat, serious game— nothing fancy. This is the kind of game 
you do in your head, not on the screen, but everything you need is there. 
It tells you which player is up and what everybody's score is; it shows 
you the word you have to figure out and, right next to it, the ticking 
clock; and then it gives you six definitions for the word. You have to 
type the letter representing the right definition before the clock runs out. 
And you'd better be right, too— you'll be charged for wrong answers. 

After you type in your answer, it tells you whether you were right or 
wrong— right out loud, through the Apple speaker! Pretty good voice, 
too, for an Apple. 

The vocabulary words would be a little tough for most kids, however. 
The instructions say that the beginning level is aimed at children no 
younger than twelve; but it would take a pretty verbal twelve-year-old to 
do well at that level. 

As an adult word game, it's a pleasant surprise. Most vocabulary 
games for adults tend to be obvious: not much of a challenge if you read 
a lot. Wordrace is not like that, however: The words in the highest, or 
"challenge," level are very rare. And another thing: In most vocabulary 
games, the definitions are a dead giveaway if you use a little logic. In this 
game you will need the logic, all right; but nothing is given away; you 
have to work for it! 

The voice in which the program confirms or rejects your answers is 
surprisingly good, when you consider that it's pure software: no hard- 
ware or modification is required— just boot the disk. This program does 
a better imitation of the human voice than some programs requiring out- 
board circuitry and a separate speaker. But, good as it is, it would be nice 
if we could turn it off sometime. 

As a game for grown-ups ("adult game" has unreliable connotations 
nowadays), Wordrace is a beauty — if you like word games. It's not as in- 
tricate or as strategic as Scrabble, but it's a whole lot faster. This is the 
perfect game for a party in the English department. 

Which brings us to the third viewpoint. Considered as a teaching tool 
(drill-and-practice courseware), Wordrace is excellent. If you want to 
teach vocabulary to children from about age twelve upward (maybe from 
about nine, if they're intelligent and verbally oriented), this program will 
help a lot. It's highly motivating as a solo game, with time-based scoring 
and audible reinforcement; and the game system handles four players, so 
it supports competition play as well. 

There are four levels of difficulty, from beginner to challenge: a total 
of twenty-five hundred words. When you can play this game well at the 
higher levels, you will have a rather extensive vocabulary. 

The disk also includes two other games, using the same format: one 
about sports heroes and one about famous people in history. For a child, 
these would be general information quizzes: for an adult, trivia games. 
Between them these games cover twelve hundred names. 

As a teaching tool, Wordrace has one significant drawback: It does 
not permit you to add your own lists of questions and answers. However, 
if what you want to teach, learn, or simply show off is English vocabu- 
lary, it's no problem: The lists they included are just fme! )R

Drol. By Benny Aik Beng Ngo. The folks from Broderbund seem intent 
on cornering the cute market these days. First there was Spare Change, 
a delightful exercise in cartoon zaniness; now there's Drol—& charmer 
set in a dream world inhabited by witch doctors, Garfield-like scorpions, 
and kamikaze vacuum cleaners. 

The dream world of Drol contains a four-level, multiscreen scrolling 
ruin in which a diabolical witch doctor has sequestered a family. Your 
mission is to rescue them, along with their pets. The family consists of 
Mom, a little girl and her pet lizard (with jetpack), and a little boy and 
his pet crocodile (also with jetpack). The two young ones have been en- 
tranced by the witch doctor and wander zombielike about the hallways, 
the litde girl following a balloon and the little boy in the wake of a toy 
helicopter. The player, as an R2-D2-like robot, is equipped with an anti- 
trance suit, a jetpack, and an unlimited supply of reality pellets to aid in 
destroying the witch doctor's monsters and phantoms. 

Each level of the game consists of three missions: Rescue the little 
girl and her pet lizard; rescue the little boy and his pet croc; and then 
rescue Mom, who is tied up on the bottom floor of the ruins. If you shoot 
the little girl's balloon or the little boy's helicopter, they stop wandering 
and stand still, making them much easier to rescue. Mom is always sta- 



tionary. The successful completion of a level will reward you with a 
wonderful cartoon sequence and then transport you back to the dream 
world to accomplish the rescues once more, this time with tougher op- 
position from the witch doctor and his minions. 

About those minions. . . . There are a number of them. At first one 
must deal with hopping scorpions who can be shot at only at ground level 
and a flying turkey that must be shot repeatedly in order to roast it 
(literally). The scorpions travel faster than a player can and will home in 
on you as soon as you are in sight. Then there are the monsters, who also 
hop along with reaching arms and can best be shot from a hovering posi- 
tion. By the time you reach the tnird level and go to rescue Mom, you're 
beset by serpents that look for all the world like seahorses. These guys 
can be shot from the ground or hovering positions, but they bounce along 
the corridors quite quickly. Furthermore, the corridors are fdled with 
hurtling implements of a most distressing nature: arrows, hatchets, dag- 
gers, and swords— all quite lethal. Your only option is to shoot them 
down before they get to you. And then there are the man-eating plants, of 
which the less said the better. . . . 

Perhaps the most delightful aspect of Drol is the graphics. The anima- 
tion is very smooth; the figures and shapes are beautiftiUy rendered and 
even more attractive than the artwork on the package itself. Everything is 
very cute and very charming. The hurtling implements of doom move at 
variable speeds, as do the pets, making it very difficult to calculate which 
to deal with first. And the cartoon reward is priceless. 

For all its charm, however, Drol is a tough game. The first level is 
relatively easy, but, having completed the first three rescue missions, life 
becomes very difficult. The monsters begin spitting doom and it's very 
easy to get wiped out quickly. Furthermore, hazards such as berserk 
vacuum cleaners appear, and the act of hovering by jetpack becomes a 
siren call to aerial doom. 

The folks from Broderbund have once again put out a good, playable 
game of great charm. While it does not have the depth of some of 
Broderbund's other offerings, it is nonetheless very enjoyable and con- 
tains hours of arcade fun. The dream world of Drol is definitely worth a 
visit. DA

Participative Management Skills. Edited by Richard E. Byrd. If 
you've ever headed a group to do anything, you've managed peo- 
ple—your children, the prom committee, the lunchroom squad at the of- 
fice, a department, a company, a corporation, a conglomerate, a coun- 
try. And when you're responsible for the actions of a group— meaning 
that by some higher criteria you're officially in charge— you have a fun- 
damental choice to make. You can manage by virtue of your clout— bet- 
ter known as rule by force, or dictatorship— or you can build your group 
into a cohesive, creative, enthusiastic bunch of producers who hardly 
need to be managed at all, it seems. 

That's what participative management is all about. The group is a 
team and the official manager guides the team members to take part in 
managing the team, encourages each member to develop his own non- 
clout sources of power within the group, and strives to gain consensus 
decisions on team matters. The result is that everyone's happier, people 
grow, creativity blossoms, work quality increases, and the team mem- 
bers think this is a great place to work. At least that's the goal, and it has 
a whole lot to recommend it. 

Participative Management Skills is a course in this kind of manage- 
ment. It's presented in a tightly written text and workbook and in five 
supplementary disks. You're expected to read the text and do the exer- 
cises, then run the disks for each section— but just running the disks gives 
a healthy start toward understanding this management theory and a per- 
fectiy good basis for beginning to try it out. Besides, it's enjoyable. 

The disks are interactive. They generally begin with graphically at- 
tractive summaries of the sections of the course to which they pertain. 
Then comes the good part (well, that part's good, but not as much fun): 
Each section has a quiz of sorts. In "Choosing Participation," the quiz 
asks you about your present way of managing your team (or family— no 
kidding, it works). There are lots of questions, and they all pertain to 
certain categories of qualities. The program then analyzes your answers 
and measures how they stack up against the appropriate answers for par- 
ticipative managers. Your results are displayed in words and col- 
ored graphs. 

"Enhancing Power" discusses the three sources of power— clout.

.nnouncing 
the first computer 
music program that 
actually sounds like 



music 



LET'S FACE IT. Up till now, music 
programs for your home computer 
have all sounded, well, pretty lame. 
There were the ones that resembled 
little electronic music boxes, remem- 
ber? And then there were those that 
sounded like so many burps. 

Enter Music Construction Set.™ It's 
the first music program that really 
makes use of the power of that ma- 
chine you've got. If you're a serious 
student, this means you'll be able to 
work with an intricacy and range of 
sound quality you've never heard be- 
fore on a computer And if you know 
nothing about music, you'll find some- 
thing even more important. Namely, 
that this thing is simple enough to 
be a lot of fun. 

Take a good look at this screen 
because it, you, and a joystick are the 
whole story here. 

That's you at the right end of the 
staff of notes — the little hand. Move 
the joystick, and you move the hand. 
Use it to carry notes up to the staff. 
Lay in rests, signatures, clefs, then point 




to the little piano in the lower right 
and listen, because you'll hear the 
whole thing played back. 

Move those little scales in the mid- 
dle up and down to vary the music's 
speed, sound quality, and volume. Use 




the scissors to cut out whole measures, 
then use the glue pot to paste them 
in somewhere else. Got a printer? 
Great. Print the score out and show it 
off to your friends. 

But what if you're not up to writing 
your own stuff yet? No problem. 
There are twelve pieces of music al- 
ready in here, from rock 'n roll to 
baroque. They're fun to listen to, and 
even more fun to change. (Apologies 
to Mozart.) 

The point is, the possibilities are 
endless. But if you're still skeptical, 
visit your nearest Electronic Arts dealer 
and do the one thing guaranteed to 
send you home with a Music Con- 
struction Set in tow. 

Boot one up. Point to the piano. 
And listen.

competence, and compatibility— and tests you not only to determine your 
own sources of power, but those of the members of your present team, 
too. The names of sixteen team members can be entered; then after an- 
swering sixteen questions about each, the program tells you the amount 
of power from each source the member is perceived to have by the 
group, discusses weaknesses in members, and suggests ways to bring out 
each weaker member's power. Power, incidentally, is essentially used 
interchangeably with influence. 

Full, clear communication is crucial to successful participative man- 
agement. "Facilitating Team Communication" introduces the concept of 
a third party to any communication activity: the facilitator. That's you, 
especially when you're the official manager. The facilitator's job is to 
see that the views of all are expressed and understood and that agree- 
ment, once achieved, is real. In the interactive portion, a score of com- 
munication situations are presented, with dialogue. You must choose the 
best response to further the cause of clarity and comprehension. 

It's nearly impossible to facilitate communication between two or 
three people who are on completely different wavelengths. In "Under- 
standing Motivational Dynamics," three basic types of personalities are 
presented, nicknamed the farmer, the hunter, and the shepherd. Under- 
standing the values emphasis of each type and learning to respect its 
worth is a major key to compatibility and communication between divi- 
sions of a company or within teams. Once more, you're called upon to 
answer questions about your team members; the program analyzes their 
primary motivational types and the degree of influence the values of the 
other types have with them. This section also teaches how to deal con- 
structively with conflicts when they arise. 

By now you're well prepared for the final chapter, "Achieving Con- 
sensus." Making sure everyone has a say is a major factor in achieving 
consensus decisions— ones all group members agree with and feel they 
had a part in making. You must look for and bring out differences, and 
be patient when the going is slow. But the end result is what Participative 
Management Skills calls a win-win situation. In this chapter, you get to 
choose the next action in a score of decision-making situations. 

Running through these five disks a day or two before your next meet- 
ing could have an eye-opening— and very rewarding — outcome. That's 
how fast you can begin to learn participative management and start put- 
ting it into effect. When the whole group leaves that meeting smiling and 
chatting among themselves, thank Concourse. This is a super product.

Broadsides. By Wayne Garris. In the last decades before steam and 
metal plate would make them obsolete, the wooden sailing warships that 
had dominated the seas for thousands of years reached their pinnacle of 
development. They had plenty to fight about; the founding of the United 
States, the French Revolution, and the conquests of Napoleon all in- 
volved sending ships out to battle from Chesapeake Bay to the South Pa- 
ific. Ships dueled until demolished or their crews were too exhausted to 
continue. 

Broadsides is a game of these single ship actions. Ships range from a 
massive, lumbering ship of the line mounting more than one hundred 
heavy guns to a small, fast frigate with only twenty smaller cannons. The 
battles can be fought between two players, or Broadsides will provide a 
captain for the opposing ship. 

The battle appears on a neatly arranged hi-res display. The two ships 
move in real time over an ocean area of variable scale, while a profile of 
each ship is presented with an accounting of its current status. Damage is 
illustrated; sails and masts disappear and holes open in the hull. 

Commands are displayed above each ship and selected with a press of 
the paddle button. 

They allow the ships to be turned, the sails and speed to be adjusted, 
ammunition to be selected, and the guns fired. With a combination of 
these orders, the player counters his opponent's maneuvers and sudden 
wind changes to bring his broadside to bear. A full broadside of guns can 
be fired only in a thirty-degree arc to each side of the ship, and raking 
fire received down the length of a ship causes double damage. These two 
considerations cause tactics to evolve into attempts to close and deliver 
full broadsides while avoiding being damaged too badly in the effort. 
Just when such an attack is moving along, the wind may change strength 
or shift direction, turning the attacking ship into a sitting duck. 



The aggressive captain who manages to get into close range can go all 
the way and try to grapple the opposing ship and fight a boarding action. 
If the ships collide, play switches to the boarding screen featuring an 
oblique view from the length of the grappled ships. Crew figures are 
shown on deck with snipers above them. The battle is now fought by two 
swordsmen at the bottom of the screen. Each is trying either to cut the 
grappling lines or to board the enemy ship. He fights by thrusting, 
counterthrusting, or hacking, with results dependent on the actions of his 
opponent. Killing the enemy swordsman will either move men from your 
ship to his or cut one of the grappling lines. After several rounds of 
fighting, the snipers will start to fire at the crew below, at enemy snipers, 
or both. 

Just how quickly all of this happens is determined by the pace of the 
game selected at the start. A slow pace allows time to plan maneuvers, 
while a faster pace requires quick thinking to follow both ships and give 
commands. For a shorter game, Broadsides has an arcade mode. This is 
the same as the more elaborate tactical version, but play is easier because 
of a slimmed-down command menu. Games are shorter because all firing 
does double damage; one of the ships will sink very quickly. 

Firing in the tactical game is more complex. Three ranges are shown, 
100 yards apart, one of which is correct. Guessing the correct range is 
annoying at short range, since if you miss, your ship is helpless until the 
guns are reloaded. At medium and longer ranges, when distance is 
harder to judge, this can be very frustrating. Prepare to scream and pull 
hair when your carefully planned broadside misses by a few pixels and 
your computer opponent has once again picked the correct range for his 
return fire. Distance seems already to have been factored into the 
damage done, with guns aimed individually, not as a broadside. Having 
to guess the exact range isn't needed to make hitting more difficult. 

That annoyance seems strange because in most other areas Broad- 
sides is very flexible and forgiving. The keyboard can be used instead of 
a game controller. The game can be paused or the pace of the game can 
be changed at any time. The sound can be turned off or enhanced with a 
Mockingboard. Ships' characteristics can be changed in every respect, 
making it possible for any ship from any navy to appear in the game. 
Scenario designers are helped by a set of historical notes and ship 
statistics for each navy. 

This gives veteran war gamers something to tinker with, while 
Broadsides's ease of play and arcade option allow new players to jump 
right into the action. While Broadsides can be uncomfortable in some 
ways, it has a good level of historical detail and a good feel for its subject 
overall.

Epson rX-80. The name Epson connotes quality and reliability in print- 
ers, so the prospect of a new Epson suggests some exciting possibilities. 
In its earlier line of MX printers, Epson made several improvements in 
the product. Therefore, a new series replacing the MX line could reason- 
ably be expected to consolidate the older innovations and add some new 
features. The Epson FX-80 does this— for the most part. 

To start with, the FX-80 incorporates the features of the most recent 
revisions of the Graftrax firmware. This means that the commands for all 
the modes— compressed, expanded, enhanced, double strike, italic, un- 
derlined, superscripted, subscripted, graphics, and so on— are the same 
as they were before. In other words, the FX-80 will behave as expected 
with all programs written for the MX printers. 

The most impressive addition to the firmware is the capability to cre- 
ate custom character sets. Although Epson supplies no software to take 
advantage of this function, we're likely to see something along that line in 
the near future from third party software developers. For the do-it-your- 
selfer, the technique for designing the characters is well documented (a 
first for Epson) and considerably easier to learn than Applesoft shape 
tables. 

On the mechanical side, the FX-80 prints considerably faster than the 
previous generation of Epsons. It's rated at 160 characters per second 
against the MX-80's 80 characters per second. Keep in mind, however, 
that the cps measurement isn't the last word on printer speed. The Apple 
Dot Matrix Printer, although rated at 120 cps, actually prints about 30 
percent faster than the FX-80 (based on a test printing of a three-page, 
double-spaced manuscript using Apple Writer 11). This is because the 
time a printer takes to do a line feed isn't part of the cps measurement. 
The speed of the FX-80 line feed is not prodigious.

The standard FX-80 comes with both friction feed and pin feed. The 
pin feed mechanism is located on the ends of the rubber platen and is 
somewhat difficult to load paper into. It's adjustable, but only for nine- 
and-a-half-inch or ten-inch paper widths. Nine-and-a-half-inch paper 
with removable strips on either side is the most widely used kind of paper 
in most word-processing situations. 

For narrower paper such as special forms, mailing labels, and the in- 
expensive eight- and-a-half-inch paper often used for program listings, a 
special tractor mechanism is required. This optional unit mounts on top 
of the printer. It can be adjusted for any paper width from about three 
inches to nine inches. Unfortunately, it won't expand to wider than nine 
inches; so it must be specially installed when it's needed but removed for 
most word processing situations, since when it isn't used it will cause 
paper to jam. Mounting and dismounting aren't difficult operations, but 
this still seems like a needless nuisance. 

The bottom line on the FX-80, however, is that it is an Epson. This 
implies that people will buy it. It may not be the best dot-matrix printer 
for a given application, but it will be good for just about anything. People 
buy Epson for the same reason they buy any well-known name brand: 
They know what they're getting, and they can be reasonably sure of not 
being disappointed. DD

Pick-A-Dilly Pair. By Norm Gray. The Dillies have checked into the 
Pick-A-Dilly Hotel where you are the room clerk. They failed to 
register, so you don't know which of the thirty-six rooms they're in; you 
do know that they arrived in pairs and that when you open two doors to 
expose a matching pair those rooms are eliminated and you score a point. 
On the other hand, if the pairs don't match, the doors close again and you 
must remember which Dillies were in those rooms. 

Perhaps you once watched the old TV game show Concentration or 
played the card game upon which it was based. Pick-A-Dilly Pair is like 
a computerized form of Concentration— with added twists. Each Dilly is 
a cute little animated cartoon figure, two of each kind, and each pair 
comes with an appropriate tune. With cats, you get "What's New, 
Pussycat?" With dogs, it's "How Much Is That Doggie in the Win- 
dow?" The tune for turkeys is "Turkey in the Straw." The effect is 
quite entertaining, with a special appeal for children. 

Up to six can play, and there are several modes. The standard game is 
just like Concentration; open two doors at a time to find matching 
Dillies. In "Joker and Villain," there are two wild-card Dillies, one that 
gives extra points and one that takes points away. In the "Pick 3" and 
"Pick 4" modes you must match more than two Dillies at a time. The 
"Mixup" mode switches unmatched Dillies during play; the "Music 
Only" mode gives you only tunes, no figures to match. "Doors Stay" 
can be even rougher; matched doors don't disappear, so you have to 
remember which ones have been matched — or lose a turn. For the quick 
of eye, there is "Flash," which gives a quick glimpse of the figure and 
no music. 

Actually, you can turn off the music for any of the other modes ex- 
cept, obviously, "Music Only." 

Pick-A-Dilly Pair is a rare treasure, a game that children and adults 
can enjoy equally . But, of course, the kids will win. PI

Appli-Card. "The world's most popular operating system," some have 
stated. Others chime in with comments ranging from "S-100 bus rules" 
to "very adaptable." What they're talking about is the disk operating 
system called Control Program for Microcomputers: CP/M. During the 
five years CP/M has been in existence, its popularity has grown, partial- 
ly due to the hundreds of companies offering compatible software, from 
business applications to education to data communications to games to 
programming aids. 

Apples have no built-in environment to run CP/M, but that didn't 
stop CP/M fans— they remembered those seven handy slots — and, voila, 
plug-in boards to create the CP/M environment appeared. Such boards 
had to contain a Zilog Z-80 central processing unit, an eight-bit 
microprocessor that could operate upon CP/M. A market quickly 
developed for such hardware, and CP/M boards came to the forefront. In 
May 1982, Personal Computer Products introduced its own CP/M 
board. Today's version of this board boasts some important attributes 
besides running CP/M version 2.0. 



Appli-Card is impressive. Contained on it are 64K RAM, a 2K 
EPROM, either a 4-megahertz Z-80A or a 6-MHz Z-80B CPU, and an 
expansion interface connector. The EPROM may be expanded to 8K 
and, anticipating the time when CP/M can support a counter timer chip, 
a socket for that chip has been provided on the Appli-Card. 

The CPU speeds are two to three times faster than competitive 
boards, depending upon installed selection, because the board operates 
simultaneously with the Apple's 6502 CPU. The 6502 handles the in- 
put/output processing, relieving the CP/M board of managing these 
time-consuming operations. The on-board memory prevents the Z-80 
CPU from having to wait for the 6502 to catch up before proceeding 
onward. 

On-board RAM may also be used in conjunction with some RAM ; 
boards. These boards, either 64K or 128K, plug directly into the Appli- 
Card. The entire RAM assemblage may be used to operate as a RAM 
disk under Apple DOS, besides expanding the CP/M capacity of a 
system. The RAM disk becomes a storage device for information (once 
initialized) managed in any manner the user sees fit. Increases in CP/M ' 
disk storage of 54K or 1 lOK also come with the added memory. The ex- 
pansion interface also allows for a hard disk drive. 

Tightly written documentation— less than thirty pages, in a three-ring 
binder — provides all you need to know to install the Appli-Card in a II 
Plus or He. How to install a hardwire shift modification, which comes 
with the board, is also explained simply. The manual still manages a 
brief excursion into CP/M and a look at the package's utility programs. 
For an in-depth tutorial, the book CP/M Primer, by Stephen Murtha and 
Mitchell Waite, comes with the package. 

Powerftil utilities greatly increase the friendliness of the CP/M en- 
vironment. COPYFRMT takes care of mandatory tasks such as format- 
ting and copying information from disk to disk. SoftVIDEO configures 
CP/M to use specified hardware; it also provides a seventy-column 
screen (graphics-generated) and scrolling from 0 to 255 characters — 
invaluable for spreadsheets with cells beyond the forty-column limit. Us- 
ing an Apple eighty -column video card instead requires simply selecting 
that card from the SoftVIDEO menu. 

After the SoftVIDEO configuration has been saved, the INSTALL pro- 
gram runs. INSTALL brings on-line any drivers you choose. A driver is 
a subroutine that controls an I/O device. SoftVIDEO, for example, is a 
driver that controls specific menu options and terminal operation when 
you power up your computer. The drivers are written into CP/M's Basic 
I/O System (BIOS), a major subsection of the operating system. All 
machine-independent programming, such as disk controllers and printer 
and monitor interfaces for use with CP/M, are contained in drivers in 
BIOS. INSTALL puts the selected drivers into a file on your CP/M disk 
and transfers CP/M to the disk's boot track. Then, when you mm on the 
computer with that disk, all the drivers are automatically installed. 
Changing equipment is elegantly simple. Drivers may be moved, 
deleted, or changed at will. Another utility transfers files from Apple 
DOS 3.3 to CP/M and vice versa. 

Appli-Card's utility software takes the work out of CP/M. All control 
keys found in any CP/M system are accepted. There are even patches for 
most hardware peripherals used with the Apple. 

This board is not inexpensive. But, in the Appli-Card, you get what 
you pay for. tiCL

Chivalry. By Richard Hefter. From Xerox's wondrous educational 
software factory comes a true computer-assisted board game. In Chival- 
ry, a medieval game of rescue, the king of the realm has been kidnapped 
by the evil Black Knight and imprisoned in the knight's castie. To save 
him, up to four valiant knights and ladies may journey forth from Fair 
Castle. Each move brings challenge or danger. 

Chivalry is rich in color and detail. The large game board is full of vi- 
brant illustrations, and every attempt has been made to capture the feel of 
the Middle Ages. There are taverns, inns, gypsy camps, an armorer's 
shop, a village market, those famous English hedge mazes, and much 
more. 

The computer randomly rolls a die or spins a wheel for movement. 
Then it tells players where to advance their game pieces on the board and 
a colorful hi-res picture of the location appears. To advance, players 
must either make decisions or prove their skills. Many board squares 



DECEMBER 1983 SC^I^TALKW 349 



represent small arcade games of medieval events. 
I There are a couple of archery contests, dart games in the inns, and a 
practice field in the Royal Park for learning to catapult rocks onto shields 
'held by moving serfs. The big challenge is jousting, where speed and co- 
ordination are tested. Winning a jousting match often gains the player a 
special advantage to be used later in the game— a secret password or 
sign. Losing a joust costs a turn while the wounds heal. 

Besides games of skill, there are games of dexterity and chance. Can 
you catch sacks of flour being tossed by a miller, pole across a log-filled 
river, jump from rock to rock to cross another river, or leapfrog up 
ledges to get out of a deep pit? How about guessing under which shell the 
witch or the gypsy has hidden a pea? Guess right and win a magic potion; 
guess wrong and the dragon can fry you. 

Thieves and monsters such as trolls and bears roam the woods. The 
troll guards a shortcut bridge. If you can edge past his swinging club, 
l^ou save time. If you lose, you have to heal your wounds for three 
urns — troll clubs pack a mighty wallop. 

Eventually, you reach the castle of the Black Knight. Getting inside is 
quite a challenge. To open the drawbridge, you must catapult a rock di- 
rectly onto the gate mechanism, all the time dodging rocks hurled from 
he castle ramparts. Once in the castle, you must find the best path up the 
iteep wall to the Black Knight while he drops rocks at you. If he succeeds 
n hitting you, you must go back several squares to regroup. The ending 
s difficult but never hopeless. Persistence will win where skill fails. 

Besides being a good game that succeeds at incorporating computer 
md board games, Chivalry is a family game. The game flows better 
ivhen three or four people play than when just one plays. And with all the 
jlayers, it's as much fiin for grown-ups as for kids. RRA

Doublestuff. By Louis Bonfiglio and Peter Joselow. Events that trans- 
pire deep within the core of Apple are known only to a favored few. 
Cupertino is a land where dangerous marketing maneuvers become 
stride-setting examples for the industry, and chance discoveries are turned 
into magnificent advances. Double resolution on the Apple lie, said to 
[lave been an unplanned side effect of the eighty-column card, was 
discovered so late in the development of the new computer that the first 
motherboard couldn't handle it. Accident or not, the double hi-res and 
iouble lo-res graphics modes of the Apple lie are nothing short of a stun- 
ning visual experience. 

Doublestuff is a programming language designed to allow you to use 
the double-resolution modes. It loads into the bank-switched memory 
when you boot the disk (the same area into which Integer Basic loads 
when you boot a DOS System Master). And, if the idea of learning a new 
language scares you, worry not: Other than the graphics modes. Double- 
stuff is almost identical to Applesoft. The surface differences are 
summed up in one page of the Doublestuff manual. There's no documen- 
tation on what lies underneath the surface, so those who dabble in soft 
switches or machine language will have to find some things out for them- 
selves. 

The double-resolution modes are, briefly, a sixteen-color, 80-by-48 
lo-res and a sixteen-color, 560-by-192 hi-res. Every graphics command 
in Applesoft is duplicated in Doublestuff, with new legal ranges for 
screen coordinates and colors. 

Double hi-res provides an interesting challenge to the programmer 
because there are two approaches possible, each with its own advantages 
and disadvantages. In regular hi-res, it took two adjacent pixels to form 
a color; in double hi-res, it takes four adjacent pixels in a row. On a color 
monitor, any on/off combination of four pixels in a row looks like a 
single colored dot. On a monochrome monitor, however, the same four 
pixels look like four separate dots, either on or off. 

One approach in double hi-res is to treat each set of four pixels as a 
single dot, lowering your effective horizontal resolution to 140. This 
produces lines that are always true to their color but that can appear jag- 
ged. The other approach is to go for the full 560-point horizontal resolu- 
tion, which is what Doublestuff has done. The results are considerably 
finer lines that aren't always true to their color and better defined colored 
areas that are usually color-perfect— no fringe effects. 

As they say in graphics land, the proof is in the plotting. Doublestuff 
comes with an ample supply of demonstration programs to show off the 
advantages of both modes. What isn't said in the manual may be found 
by the ambitious programmer in program listings. For instance, it isn't 



easy to save a double hi-res picture because it resides in both main and 
auxiliary memory at the same time. One of the demos loads a double hi- 
res picture from two binary files— not the most elegant solution, perhaps, 
but one that works. 

Doublestuff is the first of what will probably become a large body of 
commercial software to make use of the double resolution capabilities of 
the Apple He. It's nice to see that, even in our maturing market, two 
young guys can come from out of nowhere and get the jump on all the big 
developers— even Apple! HCL/DD

PFSrWrite. By Sam Edwards, Charles Leu, and Brad Grain. A lot of 
complaints can be made about PFS.File. But, despite its slowness, its 
dearth of options, and its inability to stay sorted, it remains in the upper 
levels of the Top Thirty (at the grand old age of three) for a good reason. 
For most people's purposes, its deficiencies don't matter and its 
pluses— simplicity, flexibility of layout, friendliness— are all that's 
needed. 

Enter PFS: Write for the He. The family genes are prominent. 
PFS: Write is a useful, extremely easy-to-use, relatively complete word 
processor. It can stand alone, but its strength flourishes when it's used 
with its older siblings. Files from PFS.File can be integrated into 
PFS. Write documents, creating personalized form letters, for example. 
And graphs from PFS.Graph can be printed anywhere in PFS. Write 
documents. 

PFS. Write is a cinch to use— even more a breeze for people who are 
already used to the quirks of the PFS family, such as the use of control-C 
(rather than return) to continue and tab (rather than return) to move from 
field to field. Options are minimal but adequate for home use and many 
business uses; the display is clean and crisp and considerate. A fine line 
outlines the page sides on-screen and the top and bottom of the page 
when it's in range; otherwise the top is clear; and a ruler indicating 
characters, margins, and tabs limns the bottom, just high enough to 
display the current file name, the percent of available file space used, and 
the present cursor location— line 24 of page 3, for instance. 

The program accepts input fast enough for average typists, and a very 
smooth buffer provides for catching up with speedsters. The default 
mode is what's generally called change mode; when you back up over a 
word and start typing, what was there changes to what you're typing 
now. Inserting without changing takes a command, then works fine. Ar- 
row keys move the cursor without affecting the text at all and the delete 
key deletes backward, although you really seldom need it. It's faster to 
move directly to the beginning of the unwanted part and merely type over 
it in normal input mode. 

There's provision for selectable right and left margin tabs, and a 
decimal tab to align numbers on the decimal point; for search and 
replace, manual or automatic, with or without wild cards; for moving 
backward and forward in various size chunks throughout the file. You 
can justify your text, or make it flush right or (normal) flush left, on- 
screen as well as in printout. 

And you can append PFS. Write files, one to another. Which brings us 
to the other side of the coin. 

PFS. Write is not for everyone. Almost everything it does it does 
elegantly, but it definitely doesn't do everything. And there are a few 
things it almost does. For example, what you see on the screen is precise- 
ly what you get on paper— unless you're planning to print out double- 
spaced. It doesn't recognize the normal typewriter symbol for a dash — 
two hyphens— and blithely puts one on one line and the other on the next 
line if the dash falls at the breaking point, in printout as well as on- 
screen. The append feature is wonderful and absolutely necessary 
because the maximum length of a document is less than three single- 
spaced pages. And, finally, in an oversight unusual for the PFS people, 
the delete-line command is a control key right between those for delete 
word and delete letter— real easy for touch typists to hit accidentally, and 
there's no recovery. 

PFS. Write is an ideal program for PFS fans and many others; but if 
it's power you want, stick with Screen Writer. I1(T

The Echo 11. In 1977, a commercial speech synthesizer cost more 
than two thousand dollars, required a special-purpose parallel in- 
terface, and had to be programmed in an obscure code, producing 
barely recognizable, robotic-sounding speech. In 1983, Apple 
owners can buy a speech output system with much greater speech 
quality for less than a tenth that price. 

Advances have been made not just in the hardware but in the 
software as well. It isn't enough just to have a speech synthesis 
peripheral that can produce human speech sounds very accurately. 
For really flexible use, the computer should produce those sounds 
from natural language text input, rather than from a special- 
purpose code that represents speech sounds. 

The problem of going from English text to English speech is a 
very complex one. At the simplest level, consider how different 
the letter A sounds in the words father, fate, and fat, not to speak 
of its role in combination with other vowel letters, as in words like 
boat, beat, and bait. 

While it is not true that the English spelling system is com- 
pletely irregular, many of its regularities are well hidden. An old 
joke asks, "Do you know how to spell fish?'' 

"Yeah, F-I-S-H." 

"No. G-H-O-T-I. That's gh as in the word tough, o as in 
women, and ti as in nation.'" 

And if you type ghoti into the text-to-speech program used by 
the Echo EI speech synthesizer from Street Electronics, the Apple 
says, "fish." Not without a sense of humor, this product. 

The Echo II has been available for some years, but a new hard- 
ware implementation and, more important, new software, make it 
a significantly more versatile product. 

There are two approaches to producing speech output from 
computers, and the devices that provide one method are typically 
incapable of also providing the other. Yet each has advantages that 
the other hasn't. Therefore, the most significant aspect of the new 
Echo n is that it gives the user access to both types of speech syn- 
thesis with the same device. 

A crude way to typify the difference between the two methods 
is to call one a text-to-speech method and the other a fixed 
vocabulary method. Text-to-speech techniques produce unnatural- 
sounding robotic speech that's often hard to understand. Their 
great advantage is that they can be used to generate speech output 
from any English text. Such methods typically don't require much 
memory to represent the speech output— just a byte of RAM for 
each letter of the text to be spoken and perhaps a short text-to- 
speech conversion program. 

Fixed vocabulary speech systems produce output that sounds 
more natural or human. In fixed vocabulary voice output, the 
data — the bit patterns in RAM— are usually derived from a highly 
processed representation of the vibrations that spoken speech 
makes in the air. Playing back such representations is very much 
like playing a tape recording of the speech that was the source of 
the representation. Fixed vocabulary systems pay for their 
naturalness with much higher demands on the computer's 
memory. In addition, a fixed vocabulary approach means just 
what the name implies— not every word of the language can be 
spoken; it can only pronounce those words that have been 
prerecorded. 

In actual practice, both methods are much more complex than 
this simple explanation conveys, but the results are not. Fixed 
vocabulary devices have a restricted number of available words 
but sound very natural. Text-to-speech systems are harder to 
understand, but you can make them say anything you want. 

The new Echo II's software gives it a unique place among 
speech output devices for the Apple. It has the characteristics of 



Bats in the Belfry. By Samuel Moore. / don 't want to set the world on 
fire;/I just want a game/That ain 't quite the same. 

Bats in the Belfry is a nice item. You don't shoot anything and you 
don't get shot at, though you do get bitten quite a lot. 

As a novice netter with the distinguished extermination firm of Swat 
& Squash, you have to hustle through a three-story schoolhouse to cap- 
ture an endless parade of bats. They enter through the basement and 



both text-to-speech and fixed- vocabulary systems. A programmer 
writing applications for the Echo n can choose between the two 
methods, using whichever is most appropriate. 

Physically, the new Echo II consists of a circuit board that 
plugs into one of the Apple's slots and a small speaker. "Less is 
best" may be the new Echo motto in terms of physical dimen- 
sions. The card is 4V2 inches long instead of the old SVi inches, 
and the new speaker fits inside the Apple's case, stuck to the in- 
side wall of the n or under the keyboard of the Apple He. 

As in the old Echo n, DOS-based text-to-speech software is 
available to make the Echo say anything you want it to. New is the 
Apple Pascal version of the software. But the biggest change to the 
Echo n software is Echo Words, a fixed vocabulary system that 
includes a woman's voice speaking more than seven hundred 
words and phrases. 

An option at extra cost. Echo Words contains a set of programs 
for using Applesoft or assembly language programs. An editor 
program lets the user select the words to be used by an applica- 
tions program, tells how many bytes of memory they wiU require, 
and creates a special binary file that the user then bloads from an 
Applesoft program. The Applesoft ampersand programming 
feature is used to pronounce the words you've chosen, as in: 

220 &"0", "PLEASE", "DO", "NOT", "DO", 'THAT" 

which pronounces the phrase, "Oh, please do not do that," in a 
very intelligible voice when line 220 is interpreted. So far as 
speech quality goes, probably the only complaint that could be 
made about Echo Words is that the even intonation of the words 
seems a bit artificial. Even this problem can be overcome by using 
the built-in commands to choose the pitch and volume of each 
word within a sentence. Paying detailed attention to pitch makes it 
possible to add more natural intonation or even to sing phrases. 

The variety of text-to-speech software provided with the Echo 
n, called Textalker, includes versions for users of standard Apple 
ns and n Pluses, for blind users of Apples, and for users of 64K 
Apples— ns and lie's. The 64K and blind versions have a couple 
of extra options. The 64K version frees up more available 
memory by placing most of the text-to-speech algorithms in the 
extra RAM. After one of these two programs has been run, 
anything printed on the screen from Basic is spoken by the Echo 
II. Typing catalog, for example, makes the Echo read the DOS 
disk directory aloud as it appears on-screen. The talk-along feature 
toggles off and on with simple Basic print statements. 

Also packaged with the Echo is the utility program. 
Speakeasy, which produces speech from phonemic code inputs 
rather than from normal English text. Speakeasy speaks very 
intelligibly— more intelligibly than Textalker — and it uses less 
RAM. Textalker is easier to use, however. Both programs interpret 
certain control code sequences such as commands to control the 
volume, pitch, and rate of speech— permitting intonation and even 
singing. 

Optional (at extra cost) is the Echo Language Support Disk. 
Side one, the Pascal software, consists of a library unit through 
which Pascal programmers can make the Echo say strings by pro- 
viding a new Pascal procedure, SAY. Side two contains utilities to 
be used with GraForth, the graphics application language based on 
Forth. 

All together, the Echo II with its standard and optional soft- 
ware packages is an impressive voice output product. Afl

window, gently shake out your net, and let your charge rejoin his fellow

That, of course, is the way it would be in a perfect world. Hindering 
you in the performance of your duty are several spiders the size of 
mastiffs, which tend to congregate around the windows or skitter along 
the floor and give you what for right on the ankle. Ten such nips and you 
pass into oblivion. Ditto for the occasional bat of the vampire variety. 
Later, there is a problem with trap doors and floating fuzzballs. 

On your part, you have the ability to climb stairs quickly, jump over 
fuzzballs and spiders (or on spiders, for which barbaric but effective ac-

Portfolio. By Harris N. Dvores. On the very first page of instruction for 
this money-strategy game, it says: You've read enough. Go to it! 

The author knows what he's talking about. Once the disk boots, 
you're swept away by a game that rates tops in both excitement and 
playability. 

Portfolio is based on a simulation of the investment world where, as 
Amarillo Slim fondly said, money is just a way of keeping score. The 
game, which accommodates a range from the solitaire player to fifteen 
people, begins by casting players in the role of highly respected invest- 
ment managers. Players, after stating two fields of expertise, such as law 
and modem technology, are interviewed for positions and offered con- 
tracts that put each in charge of managing a company's $10 million in- 
vestment portfolio. 

Part of the game strategy involves negotiating your compensation. 
Do you want a low retainer and monthly salary against a high percentage 
of the performance gross? Or less percentage and a higher sign-on 
bonus? 

Once hired, you receive a portfolio of your corporation's assets 
showing cash on hand, stock holdings, venture capital, and funds bor- 
rowed. From there, as in the beginning, the game plays just like Wall 
Street.

The companies listed on the stock exchange have financial ratings 
generated by the computer. They're affected by external economic fac- 
tors, such as an increase in govenmient spending or a tightening of the 
international money supply, but individual companies are affected in 
unique ways. Northeast Edison Electric, for example, isn't affected at all 
by an increase in taxes, but its stockholders sell out when interest rates 
rise. Conversely, Canadian Mining and Refining hardly notices interest 
rates, but its stock plunnmets in the face of labor unrest. 

Internal factors, such as unexpected lawsuits or highly successful 
promotional campaigns, also affect the companies individually. 

The ratings, and their buffeting by internal and external factors, are 
the most important data on which managers make their buy and sell 
orders. But there are other factors to consider, too — such as rumors and 
confidential reports submitted by privately hired researchers. 

It is a game so real that hot managers, like hot poker players, dread 
the mandatory vacations that take them away from the job for a certain 
number of turns. 

As it is in real life, so it is in Poitfolio. Your ultimate loyalty is to 
yourself, not your employer. And your primary objective in the game is 
to increase your personal net worth, by means that include purchasing 
luxury yachts, fiirs, mansions, and the like. Making that kind of money, 
however, is usually (but not always) accomplished by managing cor- 
porate funds successfully so that when performance bond time comes 
around, you are handsomely rewarded. 

At the end of each game, retiring investment managers receive letters 
from corporate headquarters summarizing their performances. The 
results are recorded in a player history file to be used as part of negotia- 
tions when the next game starts. In Poitfolio, as on Wall Street, having a 
good reputation is worth money. 

This is a game for Christmas and beyond. It plays fast and is as good 
or better than any strategy game on the market. The docimientation is 
literate, effectively articulate, and handsomely presented. From begin- 
ning to end, it gleams with quality. D(

Fat City. By Richard Hefter and Steve Worthington. From the folks who 
brought us Stickybear comes another family-oriented game. Entitled Fat 
City, this game continues the Hefter tradition of magnificent graphic 
creations and sound game participation in a non-life-threatening 
scenario. Sound dull? Quite the opposite. Fat City requires manual dex- 
terity (through keyboard or joystick use), strategy, and the ability to en- 
joy oneself. Differing levels of complexity maintain player interest, 
regardless of age. 

As an employee of the Fat City Wrecking Company, it's your respon- 
sibility to operate a wrecking crane and knock down deserted buildings 
while avoiding hostile rats. There are ten cities awaiting commencement 
of this urban renewal. Each city is progressively more difficult to 
destroy. Behind one of the buildings in each city is a fuel tank. Since 
each swing of the wrecking ball costs fuel points, pinpointing these tanks 
is an important aspect of play. 

For first-time players, Fat City automatically starts with city number 
one. Otherwise, you may play at any level you have already managed to 
compete within. Unless you surpass the previous level's score, it remains 
on-screen as the score to beat. Totaling the points earned in each level 
allows you to constantly improve your aggregate score. 

Once the level of play has been selected, you'll find yourself seated in 
the hi-res cab of a wrecking crane. Both the target city and the wrecking 
ball are visible from the cab's windshield. Two guides to help you aim 
the ball are etched into the glass of the windshield, along with your 
score, the city number, and the amount of fuel. Keeping an eye on the 
fuel level is essential because each round finds only a certain amount of 
fuel allotted to you. Prior to the end of a round, you had better know 
where the fuel tank is hidden; without the added fuel, your crane will run 
out of gas, ending the game. However, if you fill the crane's tank too 
early you'll find more buildings remaining than you have fuel to level 
them with. 

Territorial rats increase the dangers of urban renewal. These pesky 
critters make it known that they prefer the vacant buildings to remain un- 
molested by your wrecking crane. They defend their crumbling homes 
with cans, tomatoes, and even rocks, hurling them directly at your wind- 
shield. Fortunately, you can see the incoming barrage and stop it by hit- 
ting the rats with the wrecking ball. This gamers extra points, but if you

'BEAT TO QUARTERS! RUN OUT THE 
GUNS, AND CLEAR FOR ACTION!" 



These urgent commands of the 18th- 
century captain are now yours to issue as 
you re-enact legendary naval engagements 
from the age of fighting sail 

BROADSIDES" — a new game from 
SSI — gives you non-stop naval action, as 
fast and demanding as the historical battles 
it re-creates. 

In this two- player/ solitaire simulation, 
the ships will be rigged, manned, and armed 
just like the real ships were, and will handle 
in the wind just as real ships sailed. 

For speed of play, the ARCADE game 
lets you sail right into action. You set your 
course, maneuver and fire broadsides as fast 
as your crew can reload. 

For authenticity and his- 
torical detail, the TAC- 
TICAL game puts you 
on the quarter-deck. There, you 
make the decisions real captains had to 
make: How much sail? What course for 
best speed? Aim your guns for the 
rigging or waterline? What range? 
Load with solid shot or grape shot? 



When the ships move within grappling 
range, your boarding parties and sharp- 
shooters will decide the battle. As you 
watch the fighting on your screen, you'll 
give orders for your saber-wielding men to 
thrust, counter- thrust or hack away. 

If you want to design your own ships, 
BROADSIDES lets you build frigates and 
ships- of- the- line from the keel up, rigging 
them, manning them, and arming them 
with everything from 12-pounders to hull- 
smashing carronades. 

The enemy's guns have been rolled out, his 
sharpshooters are in his tops, and he's almost 
within range. The battle is about

allow the rats to splatter against the cab's windshield, you'll lose 
precious fuel. 

The only way buildings can be eliminated is by working the wrecking 
ball from the top down to ground level, but if you try to destroy too big 
a section of building at once, fuel will be wasted and you'll get a mere 
crack in the masonry for your efforts. A building must be destroyed 
strategically. Eliminating the roof first helps, since the fat rats then can't 
use that particular avenue for tossing debris. Cracking the windows also 
prevents the hostile critters from using them as weapons ports. 

Fat City is a game suitable for any member of the family. A great deal 
of thought went into its development, as its excellent playability attests. 
The game incorporates superb graphics and strategy, fun, and a new 
idea. The combination could well prove addicting. tICL

The Einstein Memory Trainer. By Michael G. Samet and Dov Rubin. 

(Not me) moped-TV kill. 

Gibberish? Free verse? Perhaps either, depending on your esthetic 
sensibilities, but thanks to the Einstein Memory Trainer, "(not me) 
moped-TV kill" is a mnemonic device signifying, to those in the know, 
a telephone number with area code included. 

The Einstein Memory Trainer won't help you remember your dental 
appointment, where you left your brown socks, or to take lunch money 
to school. It might be useful if you have to remember lists of things, 
especially numbers. Using uninspired — but not unlikable — graphics and 
music, the Memory Trainer takes you through five lessons: "Names and 
Faces," "Method of Loci," "Peg-Word System," "Important Dates," 
and "Phone Numbers." Diligent practice will probably produce some 
improvement in memorization ability, and if you're not too serious 
you'll have some fun while you're being trained. 

"Names and Faces," predictably, helps you pair faces with names. 
The technique is to isolate a prominent facial characteristic, form a "peg 
name" that you will immediately associate with the person's real name, 
and create a random coimection between the characteristic and the peg 
name. You then form an outrageous mental image that illustrates a ran- 
dom cormection between the characteristic and the peg name. One of the 
Memory Trainer's examples is the name Bill, coupled with a face with a 
big nose. The big nose is the prominent facial characteristic; the peg 
name is Dollar Bill. The Memory Trainer illustrates a random connection 
by sticking a dollar bill on Bill's nose. 

Einstein 's graphics are disappointing; they should be furmier, more 
outrageous. After all, according to the Memory Trainer, the more 
ridiculous your mental image the better. The examples are placid and 
dull; monochrome monitor owners won't miss much. 

After showing you examples, the Memory Trainer tests you. Names 
and faces appear, and you're given a few seconds to form peg words and 
images; if you want, the Memory Trainer wUl help you by offering sug- 
gestions. Then the faces reappear without names, and you enter your 
guesses. Your answers are corrected, and if you get more than 70 per- 
cent correct you are rewarded with a fanfare and the opportunity to be 
retested or to go on to the next lesson. 

The "Important Dates" and the "Phone Numbers" lessons are the 
most challenging and probably the most instructive. To teach you to 
remember numbers, the Memory Trainer assigns consonants to numbers 
zero through nine. Zeros are Zs and Ss because zero starts with a Z and 
S zometimez zounds like Z; ones are Ts and Ds because ones upside 
down look like Ts, which rhyme with Ds; twos are Ns and threes are Ms, 
because if you turn them on their sides they look like Ns and Ms respec- 
tively—sort of. Fours are Rs because they look like backward Rs with- 
out one of the legs; fives are Ls because you find an L in the vertical 
stem connected with the lower horizontal bar of a five (look closer); 
sixes are Js, Chs, and Shs because a six backward looks something like a 
J, and the sounds Ch and Sh sound like the J sound; sevens are Ks and 
Cs; eights are Vs and Fs; and nines are Bs and Ps; and if you can 
remember all that you don't need the Memory Trainer in the first place. 

Now then, class, (not me) moped-TV kill: Ns and Ms stood upright 
look like twos and threes, vowels are meaningless, and Ts are ones. Ps 
are nines because nines look like backward lower-case Bs, and Ps look 
like Bs upside down; Ds are ones because they rhyme with Ts; Vs are 
eights because— take my word for it, Vs are eights— Ks are sevens and 
Ls are fives, but we'll drop the last five because that's too many digits 
otherwise. Get it? (NoT Me) MoPeD-TV Kill becomes (213) 391-1875, 



as do (no time) mopdo-tough cot and (nude ma) maybe doe-dove cafe. 
What could be easier? 

Dates are treated in a similar manner. January becomes Janitor, Oc- 
tober is Octopus, and November is Pilgrim; if you don't like the peg 
words given, you are free to make up your own. Commencement comes 
in the form of a challenging test called the "Memory Mix Game," which 
shows you a face, name, birthdate, and phone number, and times and 
scores your responses. 

Like any schooling, what starts out as fun soon becomes a bore. 
Diligent practice certainly could yield improvement in some aspects of 
memory, but at any rate this software is not for the cynic in the house. 
It'll probably have more success with the kids than with the folks, 
no matter how addled dad may be; but frankly it would take Tom 
Lehrer or Gilbert and Sullivan to really do justice to the Einstein Memory 
Trainer. TZ

Legionnaire. By Chris Crawford. It seemed the end of Julius Caesar's 
remarkable political career, and perhaps of his life. His political rivals in 
Rome had maneuvered the ambitious Caesar into assuming command of 
the luckless Roman armies in Gaul. Virtually the whole of Western 
Europe was peopled by a bewildering array of warlike Celtic tribes. 
More than a century before, these fierce warriors had descended on 
Rome and sacked the city. Only Roman gold bribed them to return to 
their own land. The legend remains that the Romans protested to the 
Celts that the scales weighing the gold were unbalanced. The Celtic 
chieftain then drew his sword and, throwing it on the scales, whispered, 
"Woe to the vanquished." Caesar had come to settle the old score. 

Legionnaire simulates in real time the tactical combat among the an- 
cient armies of Caesar's Rome and Celtic Gaul — and does so success- 
fully. An unusual simulation in several ways. Legionnaire departs from 
the traditional even in its line of development. First implemented on the 
Atari, the game system's graphic displays are reminiscent of Chris

Crawford's acclaimed Eastern Front. The simulations theme is relatively 
new to most strategy gamers and isn't extensively covered even in the 
older board games. 

Legionnaire explores the challenges of ancient warfare as Caesar and 
Vercingetorix, the legendary chieftain of the Celts, knew it. Although 
Legionnaire doesn't simulate any particular battle or campaign, the 
unique tactical character of this kind of warfare is nicely portrayed. 

Game play beings with the player, as Caesar, selecting a number of 
Roman legions to command. Reflecting the historical odds the Romans 
faced during this period, the computer automatically allocates twice as 
many barbarians for the battle. Also, the character of the individual 
legions and the caliber of their leadership vary widely, from veterans 
under Cicero's competent leadership to a virtual armed mob under 
Plancus — who really ought to be directing traffic on the Appian Way. 
The barbarian tribes have varying characters and capabilities, too. Units 
available to both sides are fast cavalry and slower infantry. Game play is 
strictly solitaire, with the player always assuming command of the 
Roman legions while the computer champions the Celts. 

Rich, detailed graphics in a window on the screen display a portion of 
the battlefield. Cavalry units are depicted with horseheads; swords 
represent infantry. Caesar's own legion bears his standard, the Roman 
eagle. Roman units are shown in red and the barbarians are in blue— a 
color with which they sometimes painted themselves. Terrain and its 
elevation are depicted in hi-res color, using concentric circles as in a 
topographical map to suggest differing elevations and contours. 

The game system used in Legionnaire is elegant. Movement and 
combat are simultaneous. There are no typical game turns; rather, 
Legionnaire plays in real time, with the player compelled to think and 
react quickly, nicely simulating the pressures of command. Individual 
units may be polled to determine the total number of men and the more 
significant number of "effectives" among them. Surprisingly, a save 
game option is not available, but the game is reasonably fast-paced and 
ordinarily is easily played in one sitting. There is a pause command. 

Documentation includes extensive commentaries on historical 
background and suggested tactics. The computer plays a convincing 
game in solitaire, deploying the barbarian hordes with considerable skill. 
The outnumbered Romans in Legionnaire must move quickly, coor- 
dinate their forces, and use their ground to the best advantage in order to 
survive. In Caesar's time, the effective range of soldiers' weapons was 
measured in yards. Terrain was everything, and generalship was as 
much an appreciation of a good slope as complex battlefield maneuvers. 
Though easy to learn and to play. Legionnaire is a well-done, highly 
entertaining simulation that offers the strategic gamer a first-rate 
challenge. WHH

The Philistine Ploy. By Robert J. Aaron and Alan Rosenbaum. Adven- 
ture games have a depth not to be found in shoot-'em-up games. They re- 
quire thought, precise map making, discernment, and reasoning. Yet 
adventure games must be adventuresome too. Like a top shoot-'em-up, 
but in the form of a good romantic novel, they must be action-packed and 
exciting. 

Amazing for something so educational— and adventures, no matter 
how commercial, are valuable educational tools. They hone the thinking 
processes. 

So why shouldn't the adventure form teach subjects too? 

The Bible contains some of the most adventuresome stories ever 
recorded. Why not produce a good, commercial-quality adventure game 
that just happens to teach the Bible? So reasoned the people at Davka 
Corporation, so they did. The Philistine Ploy is the result, a biblical 
adventure game that incorporates all the elements of a good hi-res adven- 
ture: colorful graphics, with some of the more than eighty screens 
employing rudimentary animation; an original two-tone musical score 
that plays at the start and when an important clue is found; puzzles; and 
conflict. 

Two-word commands take the player through the four episodes of 
The Philistine Ploy. The object is to locate and claim the treasure of the 
Seven Nations. In fact, the story is a faithful rendition of the twenty-one 
chapters of the Book of Judges from the Old Testament. Players need not 
read the Book of Judges to play the game, although occasional clues 
might pique their curiosity. 



The seeker of the treasure, a wandering Israelite, must overcome 
many obstacles. The first is to do away with a Philistine warrior who ap- 
pears randomly. Your life is on the line each time this disagreeable 
soldier appears, but you can't get rid of him until you've collected cer- 
tain key items. Only when the Philistine has been dispatched does the 
game proceed. 

After that, you have meandering roads and pathways to map, some 
leading to interesting places, others not; you encounter enemies to fight; 
and you come upon kings and maidens, castles and stables, all in impor- 
tant roles. There are many physical objects you can get — but think first. 
Clues that direct players to specific Biblical passages are worth following 
up; the readings may hold the key to a treasure's location. There are red 
herrings too. Philistine Ploy is not built to be finished the first time 
through. 

Being able to save an adventure game in progress is essential, and 
some games do it better than others. Each time you boot up Philistine 
Ploy, you have to sit through the title screen, the credits, and the opening 
theme music before you can tell it you just want to pick up where you left 
off. But it's a minor annoyance that Davka plans to obviate in future 
games. 

TTie Philistine Ploy is a good adventure game with the added flavor of 
Biblical history. King Eglon, Deborah, Ehud, and Yael come alive. In 
fact, such a game might have you asking yourself if you've read a Good 
Book lately. HCL

Stickybear Shapes. By Richard Hefter and Janie and Steve Worthing- 
ton. After forays into the entertainment world with Bop and Basket- 
bounce, the Stickybear saga continues its educational mission to teach 
people aged three through six about living in the material world. The 
subject is shapes — circles, squares, rectangles, triangles, and diamonds. 
The child's pleasure, presented in three game options, is to recognize the 
shapes' presence or absence in cartoon scenes and to match each shape to 
its name. 

"Pick It" presents nine pictures, each missing one shape, such as 
the wheels on a car. Five shapes are displayed at the bottom of the 
screen; moving the cursor to the correct shape fills in the picture and 
makes it move and sing. "Pick It" is Stickybear Shapes' s most challeng- 
ing option. 

"Find It" poses similar problems, except that here each picture con- 
tains all five shapes, and the child must match the shapes at the bottom of 
the screen to those in the picture. Although not as challenging as "Pick 
It," this section is more substantial, since forty shapes need to be 
matched instead of nine. 

The scenarios in both games are delightful— cleverly animated, pleas- 
ingly scored, and child-appropriate. Correct matches make butterflies 
flutter, jack-in-the-boxes pop up, sand crabs skitter along silver beaches, 
and mama bears stir batches of batter. 

In "Name It," the only game involving the written word, the student 
chooses from the five shapes the one named by the word displayed. A 
correct choice sends half a dozen or more of that shape bounding across 
the screen. Even this one can be played successfully by a nonreader 
through trial and error. 

In fact, one of the nicest things about this program is that it can 
be used easily and enjoyed thoroughly by nonreaders and computer 
neophytes. 

In an informal "test drive," a preliterate kindergartner who had 
never before been near a keyboard not only learned the key- 
presses — arrows for answer selection, space bar to move through prob- 
lems, escape to the menu— as rapidly as her instructors but remained fas- 
cinated for hours at a sitting even after getting the shape recognition 
down pat. 

A multimedia package in an attractive washable binder. Shapes comes 
with the program, hardcover picture book, poster, and a sheet of bear 
stickers— an excellent value in preschool educational software. It can be 
used with keyboard, paddle, or joystick, and a color monitor adds great- 
ly to its aesthetic appeal. IP

Algebra Arcade. By Dennis Mick, Mike Konemann, Richard O'Farrell, 
and Jerry Isaacs. It's getting hard to find entertaining educational soft- 
ware that doesn't compromise its educational value for the sake of fun. 
Sometimes it's hard to know what came first: the lesson or the game that 
supposedly teaches the lesson. 

Algebra Arcade isn't like that; in fact, the game's packaging makes 
the program look much more entertaining than it is. 

In terms of arcade fun. Algebra Arcade rates about a two. In terms of 
challenge, educational value, and addictiveness, it rates near an eight, 
depending on the player's interest in mathematics. 

The game in Algebra Arcade is called Algebroids. On an X-Y graph, 
aliens are plotted at random, and the player's object is to shoot them 
down. 

Unlike arcade games. Algebra Arcade requires the player to enter an 
algebraic equation that will plot a graph running through as many aliens 
as possible; aliens hit by the resulting graph are knocked off for various 
points. 

Players are given Y = ?; from there, they can use exponents, pi, 
trigonometric functions, and numbers to write graph equations, which 
can be anything from a simple Y = 3 to something as complex as Y = A 
* X + B + sin(C*X). However, it's not as easy as creating an equation 
that covers practically the whole graph. Hitting the graph gobbler, who 
appears at random spots every turn, or creating a graph that runs too 
long, can result in the loss of as many as three turns. 

For those who lack typing skills, all that is required to enter the 
trigonometric functions is the touch of one key, usually the initial letter 
of a function. Don't worry about screwing up the program; it will let you 
know immediately whether or not the entered equation is valid. 

Algebra Arcade, which lets one or two players play at a time, can be 
as frustrating as it is challenging. A practice mode lets students experi- 
ment with equations without having to worry about scoring points, and 
this is where the game has its brightest moments. Arcade simulations are 
fine, but the practice mode serves as a wonderful graphing tool for in- 
terested students who want to become more familiar with the way 
algebraic and trigonometric equations can be manipulated to generate 
different graphs.

With a relatively large price tag, one would expect more than just the 
Algebroids game and practice mode. Features can be modified to add 
some variety to the game, true; but fifty dollars for one program is pro- 
hibitive to any family or school on a limited budget. 

Don't let that be too discouraging, though; for what it has to offer, 
Algebra Arcade is a fine program. Because of the game and practice 
modes, it meets the requirements of students who need motivation to 
learn, as well as those whose motivation pushes them past learning into 
exploration. niV

Millionaire. By Jim Zuber. Not too long ago, publishers were hurriedly 
converting their Apple programs over to the IBM. This one goes in the 
opposite direction. And it seems to work just as well on the Apple. 

In times past, millionaires were men of energy and imagination. They 
invented tools, laid railroads, drilled for oil, founded banks, and, in 
short, set the stage for the prosperous economy we enjoy today. But that 
was long ago. These days, everyone just wants to make a bundle in the 
stock market. 

If that's what you want, this is how to do it. The author has taken 
great pains with this simulation. Every little market fluctuation is repre- 
sented on a weekly basis. What's more, the weekly Financial Journal 
gives you the news of Wall Street, and the documentation includes tips 
on spotting price trends. 

There are fifteen stocks arranged in five groups. The computer Indus- - 
try group, for example, consists of Control Data, IBM, and NCR. (Sor- 
ry, no Apple; you can invest only in mainframe companies.) Prices are 
affected by the general trend of the market, by the growth pattern of thei 
industry, and by the fortunes of the individual companies. 

The game proceeds for ninety-one weeks. You can save it at any 
point. Your wealth carries over from game to game; if you make a mil- 
lion, it's ready for investment in your next game. 

You start with $10,000. You are initially limited to the hoary tactic: 
buy low and sell high. But as your wealth increases, you can start buying i 
on margin, dealing in options, and borrowing money to invest. With: 
these speculative tactics, you can make a million or lose one in the blinki 
of an eyelash. 

Unfortunately, although short-term investment is well covered, long- 
term aspects are ignored. The Financial Journal gives you all sorts of 
stock market tips but tells you almost nothing about fundamentals like, 
capitalization of price-earnings ratios. There is no distinction between' 
common and preferred stock. There are no dividends. Money in the banki 
draws no interest. There is no inflation. 

The name is a tip-off. This isn't a game about investing to save up for; 
retirement or for your children's education. On the other hand, if you 
think you have what it takes to make a quick million in the stock market, 
Millionaire can help you find out if you're right. ft

Titan Empire. By E. Zaron. The bridge crew tenses as Mr. Spock 
reports the third incoming plasma torpedo. Mr. Scott has just pro- 
nounced that he "dinna ken the shields can take ne more." Dr. McCoy 
solemnly intones, "I'm a doctor, not a mortician." Kirk looks alert. 
He's waiting . . . waiting. . . . "Now, Mr. Sulu: Hard to port!" But it's 
too late— the torpedo slams into the side of the ship, the crewmembers 
once again fall from their chairs, and we cut to the first commercial. 

So it was that the crew of the Enterprise hooked us into another Kirk- 
fights-the-Romulans episode (as opposed to a Kirk-trades-insults-with- 1 
the-Klingons episode, as any genuine Trekkie would recognize). Well, I 
Titan Empire captures the mood of one of these classic battles, complete 
with warp factors, view screens, status reports, computer inquiries, andi 
the blaring red-alert klaxon. All that's missing are the witticisms of the.i 
bridge crew and the falling out of the chairs, and the player is welcome to 
add these effects at home. 

Titan Empire doesn't claim to be a Star Trek game, but it doesn't 
deny being one either. It does borrow most of its terminology from that 
source, but to Zaron's credit the game is much more original than its 
word choices. The setting for this game is our old familiar solar system 
instead of some arbitrary grid representing the Milky Way galaxy. The 
neat thing about solar systems is that the planetary orbits can affect the 
strategic situation. The inner planets are always close together, but de-

laying an attack on an outer planet until it gets closer can save a lot of 
time in the long run and improve your chances of getting there too. 

The situation starts out with human colonies on all the planets in the 
solar system plus the earth's moon, four Jovian moons, ten satellites of 
Saturn, five moons of Uranus, and one of Neptune. The asteroids are un- 
derstandably absent from this simulation. A hostile life form has 
emerged from Titan (the largest Saturnian moon), has attacked our col- 
onies, and is heading for Earth (in all fairness, we probably incited this 
by colonizing one of their sacred methane swamps). The player com- 
mands an Enterprise-like ship in an attempt to regain lost territory and 
prevent any more alien land grab deals: in short, wipe the buggers out. 

Two resources are in question in this war: troops and fuel. All planets 
and moons are able to generate these commodities at a slow rate. You 
need fuel to get from place to place, power your shields, shoot at aliens, 
and obliterate planetary populations. You can only get fuel from friendly 
planets, and an enemy planet can only be made into a friendly one by said 
obliteration (well, they started it). Once the enemy troops on a planet are 
defeated, you can beam down your own troops. The planet becomes 
friendly, and you can refuel. 

An unusual aspect of this war is that you are allowed only one ship at 
a time, while the enemy can have as many as ten (some kind of interplan- 
etary SALT arrangement, no doubt). This has the effect of making the 
war situation stable, an unusual situation in a war game. The more plan- 
ets you occupy, the harder it is to defend them all. And the natural orbital 
patterns inevitably move your weaker planets near their stronger ones 
just when you're ready to tie things up. By the same token, when you 
have conquered all the planets but one, all ten of the enemy ships will be 
coming from the one remaining enemy planet when you try to attack it. 
Titan Empire can last a long time. 



The game can be addicting. When you've just finished securing Sat- 
urn and all ten of its moons, only to di.scover that the enemy has taken 
Earth and the rest of the inner planets, it can be frustrating, too. 
Somehow, though, that kind of frustration can keep you playing. Jim 
Kirk never let it get him down. DD

Spellagraph. Spelling drills, even those that attempt to incorporate 
games, can often be dull and narrow in their appeal. DesignWare, 
however, has succeeded in producing a learning game with more going 
for it. 

The object of Spellagraph is to guess the meaning of a rebus (a 
sentence in the form of pictures). For example, the sentence, "I hear," 
might be represented by a picture of an eye followed by an "H," a plus 
sign, and a picture of an ear. The rebus is hidden by a number of panels. 
When a child correctly spells a word, part of the rebus is revealed and the 
child can try to guess its meaning. The player scores for good spelling 
and correct guesses, and the game can be played in competition. 

The Spellagraph disk includes about four hundred words. They are 
divided in levels from second grade ("hat") to eighth grade ("mayon- 
naise"). Other word lists can be added. In addition, the level of difficulty 
can be affected by changing the number of panels that conceal the rebus. 

The best learning tool a child can have is a concerned parent, and 
Spellagraph is no substitute. There are simply not enough words on the 
disk to provide much benefit. However, when parents are willing to put 
in the hours that are necessary to expand the word lists, Spellagraph is a 
good investment. Fi

Flow Charting. By Keith Alan Patton. After six years, you would think 
that everything that could be done on the Apple II would already have 
been done. Most new software, if it shows us anything at all, shows us 
that something we already knew could be done can be done better. Every 
once in a while, however, somebody looks at the machine with a fresh 
viewpoint and comes up with something that nobody else has thought of. 
It's those flashes of inspiration on the part of a few talented individuals 
that keep computers exciting for all of us. 

The creation of flow charts on the computer is the kind of problem 
that seems insoluble until someone actually solves it. The difficulty is 
that a flow chart, if it is to be of any use, must be somewhat complex. 
The hi-res screen doesn't have a high enough resolution to display more 
than a small part of such a chart. The solution: Only display a small part 
of the chart. Stow the rest somewhere else in memory until it's needed. 

Flow Charting does just that. In fact, it solves the problems of design- 
ing and printing flow charts on the Apple so elegantly that it's fun to run 
even if you have no use for flow charts. If you do have a use for flow 
charts, Flow Charting can be as useful as your word processor, for its 
purpose. 

About one-fifteenth of the chart is shown at one time in the normal 
display mode. Within that window, you use keyboard commands to draw 
the lines, arrows, words, and shapes that comprise the flow chart. The 
viewing window can be scrolled in any direction by moving the cursor 
off one edge. If you want to see the structure of the chart, you can switch 
to a shrunken version that packs everything on the screen at once. In this 
mode, you can't read the chart but you can see where the shapes, lines, 
and words are placed. 

The chart is stored in memory as a character map. A set of 256 
graphics characters make up everything that Flow Charting can create. 
In addition to the full set of ASCII characters (including lower-case let- 
ters), there are special characters used to draw lines and shapes. This ap- 
proach is remarkably economical in use of memory and disk space: A 
flow chart that will fill an entire printed page usually takes less than fif- 
teen sectors on disk. 

Charts are drawn using six different insert modes: shape, text, line, 
arrow, bypass, and connector. The last three of these allow you to add 
details to the lines. For editing charts, there are three block operations: 
delete, relocate, and copy. Except for shape insertions, all the insert 
modes operate on a single character at a time. All the block modes act on 
a rectangular area of the screen defined by its upper left and lower right 
comers. 

The handling of shape insertion is impressive. When you give the in- 
sert shape command you get a menu of fifteen shapes. Each shape, when 
selected, has from one to six different sizes. You toggle through the 
available sizes right on the screen where the shape will be placed. When 
you've found the shape and size you want, you just hit a key and it's laid 
down on the chart. If you change your mind at any time before that point, 
another command causes the shape to disappear, leaving whatever was at 
that location before — whether it was text, lines, or another shape. 

Although the form of each command and mode is well matched to its 
particular function, the program is consistent in its conventions from one 
command to the next, making it as easy to use as it is powerful. For in- 
stance, the cursor movement commands are the same in all modes except 
text insertion. All the block operations use the same key sequence to 
define the desired block. Even the shrunken view isn't just a passive 
display; all the insertion and editing commands are operative there as 
well as in the normal display mode. 

Make sure the program works with your brand of printer before you 
buy it. The earliest version of Flow Charting worked only with Epson 
printers with Graftrax (and compatible brands), but the current version 
works with the NEC PC 8023A-C printer and the Apple Dot Matrix 
Printer as well. Early in 1984, Patton expects to release a version of the 
program that will drive a variety of dot-matrix printers. DD

Spellicopter. Boring. That's how spelling seems to many students. Yet a 
subject that may seem uninteresting or nonessential may turn out to be 
critical in a student's educational development. Therefore, such 
materials need to be presented in a fashion that piques the pupil's in- 
terest. 

Spellicopter uses arcade action and the computer's capabilities to 
motivate students to spell correctly. The graphics are pleasing and depict 



JTTTM 365 

a helicopter that the player must navigate, by keyboard, through three 
screens. Each portion of play begins and ends on a landing field, screen 
one. Take off into the wild blue yonder, screen two, and find il full of 
obstacles— clouds, occasionally slashed by lightning; gliders; and hot-air 
balloons, any of which can knock the spellicopter out of action. The 
reward for success is arriving at a field littered with letters, screen three. 
The spellicopter must then retrieve the scattered letters from the field to 
form specific words. Captains and aces — upper level players— contend 
with unidentified flying objects while collecting letters. Sentient are 
these UFOs, and they don't want the player to succeed. 

An altimeter, current score, and a gauge of fuel remaining are 
displayed throughout play. Loss of fuel, destruction of a spellicopter, or 
misspelling a word result in a loss of points. Speed scores; bonus points 
are awarded for fuel remaining after unloading a cargo of letters. Words 
can be displayed optionally prior to play and you can read sentences that 
use the words in a contest. More than four hundred words come on the 
disk, and creating data disks of more words is easy. 

As is typical in educational software, the arcade action in Spellicopter 
hasn't had to pass the stringent quality controls from the top game com- 
panies. It's okay that contact with an obstacle means the spellicopter's 
immediate destruction, but flying close to an obstacle shouldn't. It does. 
Players have a perfect right to hate getting wiped out when it isn't their 
fault. Even less controllable is the danger of flying into a lethal obstacle 
when moving between screens. You can't know where the objects are 
situated on the screen you're going to, and arriving on the screen already 
in contact with an object is commonplace. No fair. 

Although slow in spots, and despite the unfair aspects, Spellicopter 
was clearly designed to help kids through the spelling doldrums. HCL

Simply Music. By Peter Nye, Steve Leonard, and Robin Jigour. The hu- 
man spirit relishes creativity. The ability to knead and sculpt a thought, 
an expression, upon some form of canvas fills all of us with a glow of 
satisfaction. 

Art, drama, music, cookery, sculpture, programming. These are a 
few skills that satisfy the urge to give ideas physical manifestation. And 
computers can help, allowing for spirited interaction between the thinker 
and the deed itself. Where music is the form to be created through learn- 
ing, composing, playing, or even teaching. Simply Music is a tool that 
makes the computer the means. 

There's little hope of mastering the piano, they used to say, if you 
haven't acquired the proper skills by the age of nine. Simply Music makes 
the idea passe. Simply Music brings music into the home. This well- 
documented product allows novices to execute musical variations they 
never thought they could be responsible for playing. It is a truly personal 
and effective guide to music comprehension, creation, and performance. 
In the package you get the main system disk, courseware (song disks and 
sheet music books), a demonstration disk, a personal songs disk, and an 
instrument disk. More than a hundred different instrument sounds may 
be incorporated into your own scores. Not in the basic package, how- 
ever, is the alphaSyntauri keyboard— a relatively costly item through 
which Simply Music must be used. 

A few menu screens easily manage Simply Music. To begin, one or 
two of ten instruments may be chosen for play. Lower and upper halves 
of the alphaSyntauri keyboard may play different instruments. Groups of 
varied instruments provide unusual sounds to punctuate your creations: 
an ocean, gong and chimes, and crickets, for instance. 

The screen can display staff, keyboard, or bar. The bar is a display of 
colored blocks that correspond to notes in play. The keyboard and staff 
show live or recorded play, in part or in whole. You can load albums of 
up to ten songs each and play or work with any of the songs. Teachers, 
for example, could write their own scores, save them in an album, and 
recall the material for student interaction later. 

In the orchestration section, muting of song parts enables players to 
follow a single part on-screen for learning purposes. The volume of the 
individual instruments used to record a score may be adjusted, and each 
score may have as many as sixteen recorded parts. This makes for instru- 
ment flexibility that is astounding. Learning in an ensemble context also 
provides for students' sensitivity to their surroundings. 

Playback and recording are simple keystrokes on the Apple. A song 
may be looped to repeat until halted. And there's a match option that lets 
you watch a hi-res display of a keyboard or staff notation and try to

Math Maze. This one is a bit of a surprise. At first glance, it's just what 
you would expect from the name— a mathematics drill program in game 
format. But it turns out to be such a good game that you may wind up 
thinking of it as a game program with a mathematics feature. 

The level of math covered is the four basic operations: addition, sub- 
traction, multiplication, and division. Each one of these is presented in 
several stages of increasing difficulty; under "Addition," for example, 
you can select sums up to 10, sums up to 20, or sums above 20. 

However, the purpose of the game is not just to solve math problems: 
That's only the first step. The main purpose of the game is to get from 
one place to another in a maze as quickly as you can. This is a game for 
people who like fast car chases with lots of zipping around comers and 
crashing into walls. 

Forget about the math problems for a moment. The screen shows a 
simple maze— a pattern of walls and corridors in lo-res graphics— with 
the digits from 0 to 9 distributed around it. Your joystick (or keyboard) 
controls a fly, who starts out at the lower left comer of the maze. 

The fly's task is to fly through the corridors of the maze to one of the 
digits and pick it up. Sometimes you have to pick up two digits in a cer- 
tain sequence. The faster you do this, of course, the higher your score 
for that round. 

The game designers may have made a mistake in using a fly for the 
viewpoint character. Judging by the feel of the joystick they should have 
given us a mini-Cooper racing car or a one-man rocketship. Anyway, 
whatever it is, it can survive an unlimited amount of bashing into 
walls — which is useful in this game. 

That's the important part of the game, the part you pay attention to— 
the part that's fun. Before that part, you have to solve a math problem on 
each round, because the digits involved in the answer are the ones the fly 
must later race to get. Obviously, the quicker you can solve the problem, 
the higher your score; so you work to make that part of the process as 
short as possible, without even being aware of it. 

In other words, you leam to do simple math problems in your head, 
with a minimum of attention in a minimum of time. What's more, you 
leam math almost as a trivial side issue. 

When you have used up the first maze, you have two options avail- 
able: You can go to another maze, or you can add a hazard to the maze 
you know. The game disk comes with forty different mazes; there's a 
maze editor program that lets you edit the current maze (move the digits 
around, or close some doorways and open others) or create and save 
your own designs. 

Or you can add a spider to the existing maze. She jumps around more 
or less randomly, but if the fly comes near she will go for it; if she gets 
it, you'll lose forty points and have to start over. If she happens to be 
hovering around the digit you want, she can be a real nuisance. 

The game also offers a less bloodthirsty hazard: You can make the 
walls of the maze invisible. You can still see the digits, but you can 
detect walls only by bumping into them (it doesn't hurt, but it slows you 
down). It's a good idea to try this first with a maze that you're already 
familiar with. 

If you're an advanced masochist, you can have both the spider and in- 
visible walls in the same game. You'll hardly even notice the math prob- 
lems. Good luck! IR

Spider Eater. By Al Borges and Ralph Higgins. Coloring Series 1. By 

David Thomburg. One of the niftiest pieces of graphics hardware around 
for microcomputers today is the KoalaPad. Its friendly, menu-driven 
program handles most of the fundamental requirements of the microcom- 
puter artist. 

Spider Eater and Coloring Series 1 are designed expressly for use 
with the KoalaPad. Despite its gruesome name. Spider Eater is a musical 
education game for teaching youngsters some of the more rudimentary 
elements of music composition: names of notes, pitch, and intervals. 

The game screen is a treble clef on which attacking spiders pause on 



their way home to the web. When the spiders land, they give off a 
musical tone corresponding to the line or space they landed on. 

Each line and space on the treble clef is lettered, as is the flat, plastic 
keyboard design, provided in the package, that lies across the KoalaPad. 

At first glance, the game seems to be just a matter of hand-eye coor- 
dination. The spiders land and the player looks to see where, touching 
the Koala keyboard on the corresponding key. A musical note (represent- 
ing the player) moves to the location selected and eats the spider. 

Soon, however, other elements come into play. The player's note is 
assigned an interval value— whole, half, or quarter notes. The spiders 
move at the end of each interval, so speed is essential. The faster a player 
hits the correct key, the higher the point value for getting the spider. 

Accuracy is also a factor; hitting the wrong key automatically gives 
the spider access to his web. 

The game, which accommodates one or two players, has several 
levels of play, from slow and easy to fast and invisible. On the invisible 
level, the spider doesn't show; the pitch of the spot he lands on is the 
only clue to his location. 

Coloring Series 7 is a disk coloring book consisting of twenty-five in- 
teresting, geometric designs mathematically created in Logo. The en- 
closed manual (also primarily a coloring book) gives some background 
on the creation of these patterns as well as several coloring suggestions. 

While the Coloring Series 1 has little to resemble great art, the 
abstract designs give aspiring computer artists an opportunity to practice 
and develop their skills with the KoalaPad. 

The Spider Eater disk also offers two additional utilities. Music 
Maker and Crazy Sounds. Music Maker allows a player to produce 
musical notes by touching the KoalaPad's keyboard. Since the keyboard 
has only nine keys and because there's no option to save or replay se- 
quences. Music Maker is good only for familiarization and fun. 

Crazy Sounds is just like it sounds. By touching the pad in various 
places, the player can call up the sounds of birds chirping or ray guns 
blasting. Here's one program guaranteed to drive parents crazy. HAS

Airsiin-3. By Ted Kurtz. Aspiring pilots: your attention! Ted Kurtz has 
updated his Airsim-1. The new program is competitive with the best 
simulators on the market. 

A flight simulator is not much like flying a real plane. Your ears 
don't pop, and you can't get airsick. You can't fly by the seat of your 
pants. And, of course, you don't get killed if you crash. 

Within these limitations, Kurtz has done a good job of simulating air- 
craft operation. On the screen, you can see the instruments you would 
see in a real cockpit — the compass, altimeter, airspeed indicator, turn in- 
dicator, and others. There are actually enough navigation instmments to 
fly the plane by instmments alone. What's more, you get a pilot's-eye 
view through the windshield, and, as if that weren't enough, you can 
switch to a radar view of the surrounding area. 

Of course, there isn't much to see— just a ragged line for mountains 
and another one for the seacoast. However, there are six airfields, based 
on six existing ones in Califomia, and there is a fictitious Home airstrip 
planted near Bakersfield for novice pilots. In addition, there are forty-six 
navigational beacons, corresponding to real ones scattered along the 
coast of California. 

But who wants to look at the scenery? The meat of the game is in the 
flying — putting your plane through its paces. And it handles its paces 
very well. The generic light aircraft cmises at 195 knots and is very 
acrobatic. With this plane, you can do loops, barrel rolls, almost 
anything you can imagine. You can even do the formidable outside loop. 

To be sure, 48K is not much room for a program like this. Certain 
simplifications are inevitable. For example, the cockpit has a digital 
altimeter and airspeed indicator, instead of the usual clock-face in- 
stmments. This doesn't really impair the user's enjoyment very much; a 
good landing is a good landing, whatever the instmments look like. In- 
cidentally, a good landing is probably the most difficult maneuver possi- 
ble with this simulator. When you make your first safe landing, you will 
experience a real sense of achievement. 

This simulator handles like a fast, exciting little airplane. Full 
throttle! Take her up! f)

What 
Really 
Is the 
Fruit 

Of the 
Loom 



BVtlKHAEL FERRh 




"/ must tell you that the Spring Weaver's Journal is, in my estima- 
tion, a jewel. Love them all, but this one with the feature on Quebec real- 
ly hit home. It was in Quebec that I was first exposed to— and fell in love 
with — weaving. " 

It's a passion, weaving, as this letter to the editor of a popular textile 
craft journal suggests. You either love it or it baffles you— just like own- 
ing an Apple. 

"In Quebec," writes the author of the article that inspired the letter, 
"the tradition of doing textile crafts at home has always been strong and 
important to the well-being and happiness of the family." 

This tradition is the key to weaving's timeless appeal. 

Room of the Looms. The living room of Jan Hoskins's home in Win- 
nipeg, Canada, looks like a stage set for a concert that will be played on 



two spidery, wooden devices. Instead of living room furniture, the space 
contains a large, sixteen-shaft jack loom and an elaborate drawloom 
made in Glimakra, Sweden, with movable drawcords controlling pattern 
blocks for weaving free-form patterns. 

Spodights are aimed at the fell of the cloth on each loom, illuminating 
the work area where the woven cloth meets the unwoven warp threads. 
The walls are gallery white, with a sampling of textile structure ex- 
periments done by Hoskins hanging in a row at eye level. 

The designer of the room has made sure that your eyes will be enter- 
tained by the complexity of the loom's string arrangements and the 
vibrant, colorful notes of the woven designs. You might even imagine 
you're attending a "performance" in the art of hand loom weaving. 

Rounding a comer of the kitchen into the dining room of Hoskins's 





DECEMBER 1983 




Computerized weaving has arrived. 
Hoskins's Archivist program is capable 
of creating designs from more than one 
million combinations of stored factors. 
The designs are transformed into 
drawdowns— maps used in setting up a 
loom. By way of a special hookup (not 
shown) the shed sequence on the AVL 
dobby loom is controlled from the Apple, 
eliminating hours of tiresome footwork. 



home, you are surprised again by another pair of looms. A small, four- 
shaft counterbalance loom is angled toward the sliding glass doors, 
making use of the natural outdoor light. An AVL dobby loom, with six- 
teen shafts giving it extra patterning capacity, shares the light. 

This room isn't as grand as the first— only a single Mexican tapestry 
hangs on the wall— but it contains an item that more than makes up for its 
lack of visual eloquence. An Apple n Plus on a roll cart is tucked in a far 
comer, right behhid the dobby loom. 

Most people wonder, says Hoskins, what a machine that deals with 
zeros and ones is doing in a house that talks warps and wefts. 

"If there's one thing Apples and weaving have in common," says 
Hoskins, who knows firsthand, "it's that they both deal really nicely 
with binary matrixes." 



The comparison goes even further. While loom weaving of clothes, 
blankets, and curtains is no longer a necessity for survival in the modem 
world, the desire to sit down at a loom and create something useful, 
beautifiil, and colorful is still strong among those who have taken up 
weaving as a leisure-time activity. 

Personal Weavers. Just like dedicated Apple users, weavers can be 
characterized as people who "like to think and create with their hands," 
according to Jean Scorgie, a hand weaver and writer from Portland, 
Oregon. "Weavers also like to design things with a lot of personal choice 
and make things that are useful, functional, and expressive." 

As a member of the Portland Handweaver's Guild, Scorgie was part 
of a committee of guild members that computerized their passion. Each 
week, for two and a half years, fi-om the summer of 1980 to the end of 



370 



DECEMBER 1983 



1982, the group met around an Apple and heard the positives and 
negatives of weaving as told through Basic. 

At that time, no flexible weaving application programs existed, so 
Scorgie and three other members picked up the Applesoft manual and 
designed some programs of their own. "We wanted something bigger, 
more colorful than what was available," Scorgie says. 

With the help of a professional programmer, the spouse of one of the 
members, they created five programs. One was a simple graph paper 
program for entering a weave pattern. Another created a striped design 




A fabric's structure is determined by analyzing its warp and weft. Patterns in 
the clotti can be created by changing the color of certain threads on a 
loom. On appearance, patterns may seem different, even though they 
share the same basic structure. 



based on bar code information, used for making designs with secret 
messages built into them. 

This intense commitment to learning to use the Apple as an aid in 
weaving culminated in the group's displaying its computer-generated 
wares at the Convergence, a national weavers' conference held last year 
in Seattle, Washington. Several Apples were set up to allow conference 
attendees to try out the programs. 

Scorgie says, "We were surprised to find out how many people had a 
computer or were contemplating getting one." In the last few years, the 
use of computers among weavers has blossomed. 

In the sixties and seventies, according to Scorgie, the trend was 
toward weaving for nonfunctional reasons. Pieces for decoration in the 
form of artistic wall hangings were popular. However, as one weaver 
said to Scorgie, "You only have so many walls." And so the trend in 
weaving turned to more practical items. 

Nowadays, the desire among hand weavers is to incorporate their 
skills for the orchestration of texture, color, and design into more func- 



tional pieces like clothes, blankets, rugs, and other items. 

Whole Lot of Shuttlin' and Spindlin' Goin' On. Most novice 
weavers get their start by reading the features and tutorials in one of the 
many weaving publications like Shuttle, Spindle, and Diepot (West 
Hartford, CT), Handweaver (Loveland, CO), or The Weaver's Journal 
(Boulder, CO). Scorgie says 70 percent of hand weavers are "primarily 
amateurs," weaving for themselves or their families. The rest do their 
weaving from studios, selling the fruits of their labor wholesale or on 
consignment to the many weaving specialty shops throughout America 
and Canada. 

The Weavcat / database, Computer Loom 6.0.0, Drawdowner, and 
Video Loom II are some of the Apple programs written by and for 
weavers. Clearly, textile craftspeople and Apples are becoming a 
popular combination. 

Ask weaving industry pros, and they'll tell you that Jan Hoskins is the 
one person who has brought the two disciplines — weaving and micro- 
computing—together most dramatically. 

Hoskins is somewhat of an expert in binary matrixes, both the weav- 
ing kind and the computer kind, because she is currently working toward 
an interdisciplinary Ph.D. from the University of Manitoba that com- 
bines the study of both. Her doctoral research has called for intense 
calculation of structural algorithms and some pretty sophisticated 
graphics. 

It all comes together on the Apple. 

People are surprised when Hoskins tells them that, as a university 
lecturer, she teaches both a linear algebra class and a weaving class at the 
University of Manitoba. What the computer science department has in 
common with the clothing and textUes department isn't readily apparent. 
Aren't the two disciplines miles apart? 

Not at all, says Hoskins. Although her teaching physically takes her 
from one building to another each week, the mental journey for Hoskins 
is as simple as "going from a weaver's matrix of black and white squares 
to the zeros and ones of a computer. ' ' 

Both disciplines have strong foundations in logic. The positives and 
negatives of a fabric intersection are identical to the columns and rows 
used by a computer. It's a simple connection when explained by a doc- 
toral candidate like Hoskins, regardless of your understanding of warp, 
weft, and algorithms. 

Weaving All Over the World. Weaving is an ancient art, and the 
remnants of its history, recorded or woven, are found all over the world. 
Because the knowledge of looms, fabric, and design has changed hands 
so often over time, certain basic principles of weaving have been ob- 
scured or remain unexplored. 

"Hand loom weaving was expertly practiced as far back as 440 
B.C.," Hoskins writes in a paper titled Factoring Binary Matrices: A 
Weaver's Approach. "The ancient Egyptians wove handspun mummy 
cloth at [a densely set] 540 ends per inch, and the Chinese wove intricate- 
ly patterned silk fabric at setts of 500 [strands] per inch. 

"Complex looms are not new either," writes Hoskins. "Pattern 
books from the eighteenth century have been found that contain designs 
requiring forty harnesses or the use of multiple threading techniques that 
modem hand weavers are just now beginning to understand. 

"The early nineteenth century, 1801 to be exact, saw the invention of 
Joseph-Marie Jacquard's device for automatically controlling complex 
patterning in woven structures," Hoskins continues. This was one of the 
earliest attempts at an automated loom. 

Drawlooms of the period used punched cards that were inserted into 
the machinery by hand, one at a time, to control the wooden rods raising 
or lowering a strand of fabric. Joseph-Marie Jacquard took the advice of 
Jacques Vaucanson, a famous engineer of the times, and strung cards 
together in a sequence, thus creating the first programmed loom. 

The purpose of Hoskins's first thesis paper, which included a brief 
history of weaving, was to describe woven structures mathematically so 
that the techniques of linear algebra. Boolean algebra, and combinatorics 
could be used to define and classify the structures. These concerns are 
still the main thrust of her Ph.D. work. 

"Some work of this nature has already been carried out," explains 
Hoskins. "But many interesting problems remain." 

Interesting problems are the backbone of any good Ph.D. disserta- 
tion. "Doing something new, worthwhile, and correct" is also required, 
says Hoskins. You must make an original contribution to the literature of 
your chosen field, she says.

Above: As big as a grand piano, 
the sixteen-shaft drawloom in 
Hoskins's living room is capable 
of weaving about half of a large 
blanket in one piece. The more 
shafts on a loom, the more 
complex a pattern can be. Below: 
A shuttle of weft yarn sits atop the 
rows of tied-up warp yarns on 
Hoskins's small counterbalance 
loom. The warp yarns are 
threaded through the four shafts 
of the harness, or shed. 



A Tale of Two Disciplines. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of 
her work, Hoskins is not part of any specific department at the Universi- 
ty of Manitoba. She put together her own configuration of courses and 
waited a year to get the curriculum approved. 

Hoskins spent the waiting period researching her chosen topic and ex- 
pects to continue doing research for another two years before she writes 
her final dissertation. The Description, Classification, and Enumeration 
of Complex Woven Structures is the tentative title of her proposal. 

While Hoskins's research papers— with such titles as Enumerating 
the Compound Twillins— make easy reading only for fellow mathemati- 
cians, the concepts of her Apple work are easy to understand. 

First, a brief explanation of how a loom works. No need to take 
notes, but keep in mind the concepts of warp, weft, and shed. They will 
reappear as the meat of a plotted representation known as a drawdown, 
which is determined in the Apple by a series of algorithms. 

A loom is ' 'a device for maintaining a set of yarns— called warp yams 
or ends— parallel to each other and under tension so that another set of 
yams— the weft yams or picks— can be placed across it at right angles," 
Hoskins explains in a well-modulated, instmctive voice. 

A mechanism for separating the warp yarns into two layers, called 
the harness, allows the weft yams to be inserted horizontally in an area 
between these two layers, called the shed. "The weft yam thus lies on 
top of some of the warp yarns and underneath others," Hoskins con- 
tinues. 

"Simple woven stmctures can therefore be thought to be composed 
entirely of two types of intersections, warp over weft and weft over 
warp," she says. A twill, a satin, and the plain weave, or tabby, are ex- 
amples of simple woven structures. Doublecloth and beiderwand are 
more complex weaves. 

"Conventionally, weavers have represented warp over weft intersec- 
tions by a black square and weft over warp intersections by a white 
square." 

Woven stmctures plotted out on graph paper are called drawdowns. 
This is where the Apple was called in, Hoskins explains, "to make use of 
a powerful tool for linear algebra and discrete math" and to make light 
work of a traditionally tedious job. 

In a drawdown, the stmcture of a fabric is determined as a product of 
three matrixes— the threading, the tie-up, and the treadling sequences. 
Warp yarns are threaded and weft yarns are interlaced through them. 
Treadling of the loom, either by foot or automation, is what determines 
how the yams are interwoven. Jacquard's punched cards were one way 
of automatic treadling; using a computer is another. 

For example, the raising and lowering of the harness on the AVL

dobby loom in Hoskins's home is powered by an Apple. The Apple 
sends impulses to solenoids in the interface box attached to the loom, 
making the loom treadle in sequence like a player piano. 

However, before a weaver can approach a loom with a fabric struc- 
ture to be woven, a drawdown must be made so the loom can be set up 
properly. A series of programs created by Hoskins as part of her thesis 
research make the Apple shine in this area. 

Bedding Down with Algorithms. Her computer programming began 
because Hoskins needed a test bed for research, especially for coding up 
algorithms. It was necessary to nail them down before she could consider 
any graphics for the program. As she explored concepts, she wrote 
programs. 

The step-by-step algorithm process was computerized and formulated 
through computer statements. "Analysis and mapping data structure 
algorithms can be hairy," Hoskins says, "involving heavy computation 
and math theory for the classifying of structures." That's why the 
serious number crunching for determining them was done in APL on an 
Amdahl mainframe at the university, with help from computer science 
programmers. Hoskins herself had picked up Fortran several years ago 
and wasn't a stranger to computers. 

When it came time to consider graphics, Hoskins grabbed one of the 
six Apples that are available as part of the university research environ- 
ment. "The Apple is a well-designed machine and the graphics are quite 
sensibly structured," says Hoskins. 

She wrote graphics routines in both compiled Basic and machine 
language. 

Another of Hoskins's projects on the Apple — tidying up the algo- 
rithms—involved her husband Bill, a numerical analyst in the computer 
science department. Together they made the algorithm deductions run 
faster and smoother. 

By incorporating sorting-technique principles into the program, they 
created a "bucket" sort routine. "The algorithm program," explains 
Hoskins, "goes element by element comparing columns. Then, at a cer- 
tain point, where there is a mismatch, it stops comparing because it's 
found a new pattern. " What the bucket sort does is keep the previous in- 
formation around, arranged in bucket files, while the algorithm con- 



tinues analyzing the structure. 

As a result of textile industry interest in her work, some of Hoskins's 
textile structure research has been published and is now available as 
commercial software for the Apple. 

Fruit of the Loom. A series of packages called Pattern Master I, II, 
and /// is marketed by The Looms, a weaving shop in Mineral Point, 
Wisconsin. The Pattern Mairer programs, of course, weren't intended to 
be the end result of Hoskins's studies. "They just happened," according 
to her. 

The complexity of her programs goes far beyond any commercial ap- 
plication. "I was interested in fundamental, exhaustive pattern research, 
with no regard as to how pretty the results would be." Nonetheless, her 
work turns out to have practical value as well as plenty of visual interest. 

Hoskins's program for accessing stored pattern combmations, called 
The Archivist, exemplifies the depth of her research. The program can 
produce more than one million combinations of factors. Commercial use 
would require only around three thousand, she says. 

The Archivist lets a user select the threadings, tie-ups, and treadlings 
of thousands of twills. The chosen fabric structure is shown as a full- 
color pattern on-screen. This pattern can then be drawn down by another 
program and modified by the user. 

The drawdown for a particular pattern is made by a program that 
computes the design's algorithm and then shows how to thread, tie up, 
and treadle a loom to achieve the pattern. 

The initial drawing made from factors the user chooses from The Ar- 
chivist is done on hi-res page one. The weaving algorithm is done on 
page two, an 8K region of memory that hasn't been overwritten by 
the program. 

What's fascinating about Hoskins's use of hi-res page two for this 
particular task is that you can actually see the data being accessed. A pat- 
tern is stored as a small square matrix in the upper left-hand corner of the 
screen, and the algorithm's computation is seen as a sparkling of pinpoint 
lights across the matrix. The process takes only a few seconds. 

In choosing to do it this way, Hoskins had two factors to consider. 
She "wanted to make the program visually meaningful," as well as to 
eliminate the problems of passing data between programs.

Hoskins has also written a program allowing a user to enter an 
original design into the Block Draft database, where threadings are 
stored. Warp and weft information is entered from the keyboard onto a 
grid. A window feature permits magnification of grid portions for entry 
of more detailed patterns. 

The Traveling Weaver. Reading up on the subject, working on com- 
puters, talking to experts, traveling, and speaking before groups are all 
part of Hoskins's job as a doctoral candidate. 

Academic research, like weaving, is a very specialized passion. 
"The academic community is very small," she explains, "and so is the 
weaving community." Nonetheless, they both succeed in crossing over 
international boundaries. 

Textiles and weaving are very advanced industries in Scandinavia. A 
year ago, Hoskins spent a month visiting weaving schools and touring 
textile museums in Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm, and Bergen. She also 
found a common ground between weaving and academia at the first an- 
nual Conference on the Creation of Complex Weaves, held last year in 
Wisconsin. As joint organizer for the event, she notes, "forty-two peo- 
ple from all over the United States, Canada, and England got together in 
the same place to exchange ideas and find out what others were doing." 

One of the benefits of the Wisconsin conference was that it gave 
Hoskins a rare chance to publish her ideas alongside those of her peers in 
the weaving community. Because of the conflict of disciplines, "my 
papers," she says, "tend to be published in math journals. Other weav- 
ing articles tend to be published in historical and textile journals." 

Although most of the work she's done over the last two years is 
available to weavers on disk and to academicians on paper, Hoskins con- 
tinues programming and expanding on her initial research. 

Hoskins has been knitting since she was a child and has always done 
math on the side. "I've always had a high math aptitude," she says. "I 
think very logically." This affinity for numbers and her fascination with 
working with fibers gradually led her into weaving. 

One winter, after knitting several Scandinavian Lopi sweaters — one 
for herself, one for her son, and one for her husband— Hoskins realized 
that she'd knitted herself into a comer. 



"I began looking around for something more challenging," she ex- 
plains. "I took a weaving course and began reading the classical weaving 
literature of the nineteenth century, when a lot of smart people were 
writing about weaving, looms, and textile structures." 

She was intrigued most by the highly mathematical concepts of pat- 
tern complexity and textile structure. This is where her mathematical 
bent could shine. Conversations with her husband helped pave the way 
toward her interdisciplinary status. 

Her first paper on the subject, Factoring Binary Matrices, was 
presented in 1981 at the Australian Combinatorial Math Society Con- 
ference in Brisbane, Australia. In that paper, Hoskins suggested that her 
structural research could be part of the contribution of the twentieth cen- 
tury to hand loom weaving — an attempt to nail down and classify the 
concepts and processes that weavers have developed and used intuitively 
for thousands of years. 

When she finishes her thesis in a few years, Hoskins will have 
various alternatives open to her. With such a strong background in 
mathematics and textiles, she could look at consulting either full- or part- 
time or take a position in the textile industry. More than likely, she will 
go back to school, taking an academic position somewhere and continu- 
ing her work. 

"I am more interested in dealing with problems and looking at things 
that interest me," Hoskins says. It's a statement that reflects her natural 
passion as a scholar. As Hoskins sees it, there are still plenty of in- 
teresting problems to work on. 

Those mathematical problems she identifies, once solved, may bring 
additional computerized solutions to weavers like Jean Scorgie and the 
other Apple-owning members of the Portland group. 

A weaver starts with yarns in various colors and turns them into 
something expressive, with a beautiful texture. "Weaving is wonderfully 
tactile," says Scorgie. "You can't resist touching. Also, things you 
make are always nicer than things you can buy. Weaving gives you a 
sense of a fuller life." 

And now that Apples and weaving have discovered each other, the 
creations to come are limited only by the imagination.

SOinORD 
Symposhim 

by Greg Hbbetts 




Welcome to the December installment of SoftCard Symposium. 
Before we begin this month, let's take a moment to consider what sorts 
of subjects you might like to see dealt with in this column. Some of you 
have written in with specific suggestions of things you'd like to see, such 
as specific modifications to MicroPro's WordStar word processor, step- 
by-step instructions on how to use CONFIGIO to install I/O drivers, and 
so on. While such subjects are certainly good ones and could easily be 
dealt with here, the intent of this column has always been to address the 
needs and interests of the broadest possible constituency of SoftCard 
owners, rather than to attack highly specialized subjects on the basis of 
one request. 

This, then, is a request for input. If you'd like to have some say in 
what the column covers, please write in care of the magazine with your 
suggestions. (Be sure to put the name of the column on the outside of 
your envelope.) Subjects with the widest appeal will be covered first. 

Let's continue now with the current series and an in-depth look at 
BDOS system calls, illustrated by examples of each. While this discus- 
sion will be most useful to those among you who program in assembly 
language, those of you who program in Basic may also use it to set up 
very small assembly language subroutines to be accessed with the 
MBasic USR function. And those of you who are using other languages 
with a similar capability may also find some valuable information here. 

As a first step, let's review the nature of the BDOS system calls. 
Basically, these calls are the heart of the CP/M operating system. They 
provide the only method of communicating with it and the only normal 
way of getting it to perform useful work. 

For each BDOS function that can be accessed by the user— from plac- 
ing characters on the screen to computing the size of a file— a system call 
exists to allow the user's programs to tell BDOS to perform that func- 
tion. Generally speaking, the greater the number and diversity of the 
system calls, the more useful and complex the operating system. From a 
design standpoint, then, the key to building a good operating system lies 
in properly balancing the tradeoffs between complexity and speed/space 
considerations. Despite the fact that people may gripe because CP/M 
does not include various system calls that would make it more flexible, 
CP/M's long-term popularity is testimony to good management of this 
situation. 

Let's look now at the entire list of BDOS system calls and what they 
do. For example, the number in the left-hand column is the BDOS func- 
tion number. Please note: Some of the names may not agree with the 
ones used in Digital Research documentation; the changes were made in- 
tentionally for purposes of clarity.

As our discussion progresses, we'll go into greater depth about each 
call, but for now we'll examine the process used when system calls are 
being made. 

Essentially, BDOS is a collection of subroutines, each of which per- 
forms a distinct task when called from another assembly language pro- 
gram or subroutine. As we saw when we discussed the BOOT code, 
BDOS is never in total control of the computer. The BIOS booting 
routines take over from the boot sector and initialize the system, then 
they load the CCP and transfer control to it. 

The CCP, therefore, is the first program to use the collection of sub- 
routines known as BDOS. The CCP remains in control, calling BDOS as 
necessary for DIRs, TYPEs, ERAs, and so on until the user types the 
name of a program file with the extension .COM. At that point, the CCP 
loads this file into memory and turns control over to it. Thereafter, 
BDOS is under the control of that program (the COM file) until such 
time as the program returns control to the CCP with a warm boot or 
loads another program and turns control over to it. 

Normally, in order to work with a collection of subroutines like 
BDOS, one must know the various entry points for each subroutine in 
order to branch to them with a CALL instruction and thereby get them to 
perform their functions. This is not a very flexible approach, however, 
since the addresses will change depending on the memory size of the 
computer and the revision date of CP/M. As we've seen in the last 
several columns, this problem was handled in the BIOS by means of a 
jump table at the very beginning. In that case, the calling routine could 
simply call an address made up of the start of the BIOS plus an offset 
value for the entry corresponding to the function desired. In BDOS, 
however, this situation is handled somewhat differently. Since BDOS 
supports many more functions than BIOS does, a BDOS jump table 
would have to be much larger, and the process of calculating the ad- 
dresses to call would be rather more involved. 

To simplify matters, then, the process of selecting appropriate 
routines is handled in BDOS through the use of a master subroutine that 
acts as a function command processor. Just as the CCP takes such com- 
mands as DIR and TYPE, decodes them, and then processes them, the 
command processor in BDOS takes commands and calls various other 
subroutines to perform them. Rather than use CCP-type ASCII com- 
mands like TYPE and DIR, though, this subroutine uses numeric com- 
mands called Junction numbers. 

The list shown above, then, is actually a list of the numeric com- 
mands the command processor understands. To reach the command 
processor subroutine, the CCP (or any other program) simply calls the 
processor subroutine with the appropriate function number. To make it 
easy to find that subroutine, a system of double indirect vectors is used. 
This is not as complicated as it sounds. 

Simply stated, there's a jump instruction at the very beginning of 
BDOS that transfers control directly to the command processor subrou- 
tine. This jump instruction is the first indirect vector, so named because 
you do not call the subroutine directly but rather get there indirectly by 



going through the vector. Since the beginning address of BDOS, like the i 
address of the subroutine itself, will also change in accordance with ! 
memory size, another jump instruction is placed in low memory at loca- 
tion 0005H, which jumps to the beginning of BDOS. This jump instruc- 
tion is the second indirect vector. This second vector won't change 
location no matter what the memory size of the computer or the revision 
history of CP/M. This double indirect vector system makes it un- 
necessary to know anything about the location and makeup of BDOS to 
access the command processor. By calling location 0005H with the func- 
tion number, any program can access the BDOS function command 
processor. 

As with any command-oriented structure, the organization of the : 
command and any parameters to be passed is specified. This specified ar- 
rangement is often called protocol, and in languages it is usually referred 
to as syntax. In the case of BDOS system calls, the protocol requires that i 
the function number always be in register [C] upon entry to the command 
processor. This ensures that the processor always knows where to find it. 

Some function calls require additional data beyond the function 
number, such as a character to be displayed, a drive number, and so on. 
This extra parameter always goes in register [E] if it is one byte in 
length, or in register pair [DE] if it's two bytes. Data returned to the call- 
ing routine by BDOS will always be found in register [A] if it's one byte 
long and register pair [HL] if it's two bytes long. There are some func- 
tions that in earlier releases of CP/M returned a single byte value in [A] 
but that in the current version must return a double byte value. In these 
cases, to ensure compatibility with earlier versions, the data returned in j 
[L] is copied into [A] and the data returned in [H] is copied into [B]. 1 

Now we're ready to begin examining the system calls in some detail. ! 
In an effort to make this excursion more meaningful, we'll use this exer- I 
cise to build a subroutine library that can work with your assembly 
language or Basic programs. In order to use these subroutines with Basic 
you'll need to assemble them and then incorporate the values in strings, 
DATA statements, arrays, or other data structures. Once these have been 
made a part of your Basic program, the VARPTR function can be used in 
conjunction with the USR function to locate the subroutines in memory 
and access them. We'll take a closer look at how to jjerform that opera- 
tion once we've finished building the subroutine library. You assembly 
language programmers already know what to do. 

Up until now in this colunrn, whenever assembly language has need- 
ed to be shown it has been produced in 8080 code rather than Z-80 code 
so that ASM.COM could be used to assemble it. Primarily, this was 
done in order to demonstrate the utilities included with CP/M, rather 
than for the purpose of generating efficient code. For serious applica- 
tions, however, ASM is not a very useful tool, especially in a Z-80 en- 
vironment. While ASM is a relatively bugfree program and certainly 
well put together (considering its limitations), the fact that it is 
8080-based, lacks a macro facility, and is unable to generate fully 
segmented and relocatable code makes it a poor substitute for one of the 
more capable assemblers such as Microsoft's Macro-80. Therefore, 
assembly language code will be shown here in Z-80 form and in the 
relatively standard Macro-80 format from now on. If you plan to pro- 
duce assembly language (and if you work constantly with CP/M, you 
eventually will), then it's strongly recommended that you purchase one 
of the better Z-80 macro assemblers. The purchase of a good Z-80 
debugger is also recommended. Digital's ZSID is both Z-80 and sym- 
bolic (which means that you can examine labels as well as memory ad- 
dresses) and is an excellent product. 

We'll start by examining the character I/O functions. Interactive 
programs— those that do a great deal of communicating with the user- 
make many character I/O system calls. Collecting these in subroutine 
form is often useful and may result in some saving of space. It will also 
provide a standard format for your programming. 

The first of the character I/O functions we'll examine is console 
input: 

BDOS function no: 01 

Function name: Console input 
Function purpose: Obtain character of input 
Entry parameters: [C] = 01 H 

Exit parameters: [A] = character received 

The console input function simply reads the currently selected con- 
sole device for an available character. Depending on the setting of the

DECEMBER 198: 



lOBYTE, the console device may be one of several physical devices, but 
it is normally the Apple keyboard. Once this function is called, control 
won't return to the calling program until a character is obtained. Conse- 
quently, if no key is pressed after this call has been made or if the elec- 
tronic signal from the keypress does not reach the Apple, the system will 
appear to hang. This is a common symptom of improper external ter- 
minal connections. Once a character has been obtained, it is returned to 
the calling program (the CCP or other program making the system call) 
in the [A] register. 

BDOS also echoes certain characters to the current console device, 
usually the Apple screen. The term echo simply means that BDOS sends 
the character to the BIOS CONOUT routine. Whether or not a character 
is echoed depends on which type of character it is. For this purpose, 
characters are separated into two types, those that Digital Research calls 
graphic characters and those that are generally called control 
characters. 

Graphic characters are the printable characters of the ASCII 
character set, from the SPACE (20H) through at least the TILDE (7EH). 
It should be noted that the ASCII set is interpreted differently by dif- 
ferent groups and that the ASCII RUBOUT or DELETE character (7FH) 
is often included with the printables. Digital Research does include it as 
such, and so for our purposes it will be printable. 

Control characters, on the other hand, are those ASCII characters that 
are not printable, from control-® (OOH) through control-K (IFH), also 
called US. It should also be noted that it's not possible to receive 
control-® through normal input channels. This is because BDOS makes 
several tests internally, usually based on register [A]'s containing either 
the character or OOH. A zero character, therefore, is usually ignored. 

All graphic characters are echoed by BDOS during console input. For 
the most part, however, control characters are not echoed; the four ex- 
ceptions are carriage return/control-M (ODH), line feed/control-J 
(OAH), tab/control-I (09H), and backspace/control-H (08H). These so- 
called functional control characters are trapped by BDOS during the 
echoing process. The only function that BDOS actually performs itself is 
the tab function. When a tab is echoed, BDOS goes into a loop and prints 
the number of spaces (up to eight) necessary to bring the cursor to the 
next screen tab stop. The other three functional control characters are 
handled in exactly the same way as graphic characters; they are sent 
directly to the BIOS CONOUT routine where their particular function is 
performed. It's important to note that, regardless of their values, all 
characters are passed back to the calling program. Only the echoing 
process is dependent upon the type of character received. 

One other activity occurs during the echoing process. Each time 
BDOS outputs a character, whether it is echoing console input or simply 
doing console output, it saves that character and then checks for any 
keyboard input the BIOS may be receiving. Primarily, this is done so that 
the keyboard won't be completely dead just because a user program is 
not requesting input. A special subroutine in BDOS handles this task and 
is called from the console output subroutine just before the current output 
character is sent to the screen. 

The first thing this check subroutine does is to look at an internal 
variable in BDOS, which we'll call KEY. KEY is used by the BDOS 
character I/O routines to store any character of input that has been 
received from the keyboard but has not yet passed to any user program. 
When the character is passed on, KEY is reset to 00 to indicate that no 
character is waiting. If KEY contains a character when the check 
subroutine looks at it, the rest of the check subroutine is skipped and the 
original output character is printed to the screen. This ensures that one 
and only one character of input can be waiting inside BDOS. 

If KEY contains zero when the check subroutine looks at it, meaning 
that no input character is waiting, then the BIOS CONST routine is 
called to check keyboard status. If CONST reports that no character is 
ready at the keyboard, the rest of the check subroutine is again skipped 
and the original output character is printed to the screen. If CONST in- 
stead reports that a character is ready at the keyboard, then a call is made 
to the BIOS CONIN routine immediately to get the available character. 
Normally, this character is then placed in KEY, and the rest of the check 
subroutine is skipped once more, with the original output character 
printed to the screen. The only time this does not occur is when the 
character received is a control-S. Remember that the control-S is the 
special character BDOS recognizes as a flag to stop screen output, called 
the start/stop scroll character. 



If the check subroutine receives a control-S, it immediately calls the* 
BIOS CONIN routine again to get the next character typed. This has the< 
effect of halting everything until another key on the keyboard is pressed. 
When that next keypress is received, the check subroutine tests it to see 
if it is a control-C. If so, an immediate warm boot is performed. If the 
character is not control-C, however, then the character is totally ignored, 
KEY is left containing zero, and the output character is printed to the 
screen. 

This is all somewhat confusing, but the important things to remember ^ 
here are these: During any type of normal character output, BDOS' 
checks for the first character to be typed at the keyboard. If the character 
is not a control-S, it is stored temporarily in KEY. It will be given to the 
next user program requesting input. Until that occurs, any characters 
typed are ignored. If the character is a control-S, the output (and there- 
fore all other activity) is halted until the next keypress by calling the- 
BIOS CONIN routine (which doesn't return, remember, until a key is 
pressed). If the next keypress is a control-C, an immediate reboot is per- 
formed, and if not, then whatever key was pressed is interpreted as a sign 
to restart output and will be discarded along with the original control-S. 

Handling output and input this way makes it possible to interrupt 
screen output using control-S and to stop the program with a subsequent 
control-C, or simply to stop and restart output with control-S and any 
other character. Since this keyboard testing occurs only during output, 
it's obvious that the only time console input can cause testing is when the 
character being input is one that will be echoed (that is, when the 
character is one of the graphics characters or one of the four control 
characters mentioned earlier). As a final note, Digital Research docu- 
mentation is somewhat misleading on this subject. It states that a check is 
made for start/stop scroll (control-S) and for start/stop printer echo 
(control-P). In fact, control-P is ignored during this function. 

Luckily, our subroutine segment for console input is much simpler i 
than its description. The segment looks like this: 

GETCHR: LD C,1 ; Console input function 

JP 0005H ; Go BDOS, RET to caller 

Note that in this subroutine we jump to location 0005H rather than 
call it. This can only be done when GETCHR is a subroutine in your pro- 
gram. Since the call to GETCHR places the return address of 
GETCHR's caller on the stack, when BDOS returns at the completion of 
this function, it returns not to GETCHR but to the part of your program 
that called GETCHR. This saves one byte in the GETCHR routine, since 
we do not need a RET instruction at the end of GETCHR as we would if 
we had used a CALL instruction. This must not be done, however, if 
GETCHR is not a subroutine! Obviously, in such a case, the stack would 
not contain a valid return address and the result would be, at best, 
bizarre. 

The next function we'll examine is console status: 

BDOS function no: 1 1 

Function name: Console status 
Function purpose: Check if character typed at console 
Entry parameters: [C] = OBH 
Exit parameters: [A] = 00 if no character 

[A] = OFFH if character ready 

The console status function is used to avoid the problem we men- 
tioned in our discussion of the console input function— that is, the situa- 
tion in which the computer seems to hang if no character is typed. 
Console status checks the console device and reports whether a character 
is ready. If a character is ready, the program can go ahead and make the 
call for a character of input, knowing that one is available. If not, the 
program can perform other tasks and check the console status periodical- 
ly. The exit parameters are set up so that a 00 value returned in register 
[A] means that no character is ready, while a OFFH value in [A] means a 
character is available. Since most of the time a program will want to get 
the character of input if one is ready, we'll place this subroutine ahead of 
GETCHR and simply fall through if a character is ready. 

Our subroutine now looks like this: 

STATUS: LD C.OBH ; Console status function 

CALL 0005H ; Call BDOS 

OR A ; Character ready?

RET 
GETCHR: LD 
JP 



Z 

C,1 

0005H 



No, return to caller 
Console input function 
Go BDOS, RET to caller 



As you can see, we call BDOS this time, since we wish to return here 
and test the contents of register [A] . We do so by performing an OR in- 
struction between [A] and itself. This does not affect the value in [A], but 
it does set or reset the Z-80's zero flag, depending on [A]'s contents. The 
RET Z instruction (for return if zero) takes us back to the calling pro- 
gram, with [A] equal to 00 and the zero flag set if no character is 
available. Otherwise, we simply fall through that test directly into 
GETCHR and get the character. In such a case, we return to the caller, 
with [A] containing the character received. 

It is important to note here that if you call GETCHR, you don't have 
to test the [A] register, since you won't get control back until a character 
has been received. Calling STATUS, on the other hand, requires that 
you test the contents of [A] using an OR instruction (or something simi- 
lar) when control returns, since most of the time you will not have gotten 
a character. The test must be explicit. You cannot use the fact that 
STATUS sets the zero flag if no character is ready, because BDOS often 
returns from the console input function with this flag set as well. 

The next function we'll look at is console output: 

BDOS function no: 02 

Function name: Console output 
Function purpose: Send character to console 
Entry parameters: [0] = 02H 
[E] = char 
Exit parameters: None 

The console output function sends the character passed to it in 
register [E] to the selected console device, usually the Apple screen. 
During console output, just as in the echo part of console input, tabs are 
expanded by BDOS to some number of spaces; these are then printed one 
at a time, and BDOS checks for a control-S character entered at the 
keyboard. Unlike the echo process, however, all other character values 
(even those greater than 7FH) are sent to the BIOS CONOUT routine to 
be printed without any further checking by BDOS. CONOUT in that 
case usually ignores any control characters that aren't single-character 
screen functions or that aren't a part of multicharacter screen functions. 
In order to incorporate this into our subroutine, we'll do something else 
a bit nonstandard. We know that the register pair [HL] is never used as a 
part of the parameter-passing protocol when BDOS system calls are be- 
ing made. For this reason, we'll use it to save ourselves a few bytes. 
When the op-code for the instruction LD HL,/jn«« is placed in front of 
any two-byte instruction, that two-byte instruction no longer performs its 
true function; instead, it gets treated as the address to be loaded into 
[HL]. This is better shown in our subroutine: 



STATUS: 


LD 


COBH 


; Console status function 




CALL 


0005H 


; Call BDOS 




INC 


A 


; 00 - >01, OFFH - >00 




RET 


NZ 


: Return if no character 


GETCHR: 


LD 


C,1 


; Console input function 




DB 


21H 


; Skip 2 bytes with LD HL.nnnn 


PUTCHR: 


LD 


C,2 


; Console output function 




JP 


0005H 


: Go BDOS, RET to caller 



As you can see, if the subroutine is entered at GETCHR, the input 
function (1) will be loaded into register [C], and, because of the 21H 
byte, the loading of register [C] at PUTCHR will be ignored, with con- 
trol going right on to the jump instruction following it. The contents of 
register pair [HL] will of course be lost, but all registers whose contents 
must be preserved ought to be saved before any system call anyway, 
since BDOS and BIOS make no claim to preserve the contents of any 
registers. When the trick just described is used, both GETCHR and 
PUTCHR can share the single jump instruction, and that saves an addi- 
tional two bytes in our subroutine package. 

The next function we'll examine is reader input: 



BDOS function no 
Function name 
Function purpose 
Entry parameters 
Exit parameters 



03 

Reader input 

Obtain character from reader device 
[C] = 03H 

[A] = character received 



This function acts very much like console input, except that the 
character is not echoed to the screen. The reason here is that this functior 
is actually just a direct call to the BIOS READER routine. BDOS does nc 
interpretation of the character received and no echoing, and consequent- 
ly it does not check for any keypress. As with console input, control here 
does not return to the calling program until a character has been re- 
ceived. Calling the reader function with no physical reader device in the 
Apple does not make the computer hang, however. As we saw when we 
examined the SoftCard BIOS, reader comes to you such that it always 
returns a control-Z (CP/M's end-of-file character) if the physical reader 
device is not implemented. The control-Z is used so that programs like 
PIP, which keep reading until end-of-file is reached, will abort as soon as 
the first call is made. 

Reader input gets added to our subroutine as follows: 



STATUS: 


LD 


COBH 


; Console status function 




CALL 


0005 H 


; Call BDOS 




INC 


A 


; 00 ->01, OFFH — >00 




RET 


NZ

GETCHR:

DB 


21H 


; Skip 2 bytes with LD HL.nnnn 


PUTCHR:

DB 


21H 


; Skip 2 bytes 


RDRIN: 


LD 


C,3 


; Reader input function 




JP 


0005H 


: Go BDOS, RET to caller 



Once again, we employ the LD WL,nnnn op-code to skip two 
bytes. 

The next function to cover is punch output: 



BDOS function no 
Function name 
Function purpose 
Entry parameters 

Exit parameters: 



04 

Punch output 

Send character to the punch device 

[C] = 04H 

[E] = character 

none 



Punch output simply sends the character from register [E] to the 
selected punch device. Again, this function goes directly to the BIOS, 
this time to the PUNCH routine, and no action is taken by BDOS. If 
punch is not implemented in your SoftCard BIOS, the routine simply 
returns to the program that called it without having taken any action. 
Punch gets added to our subroutine as follows: 



STATUS: 


LD 


COBH 


; Console status function 




CALL 


0005H 


; Call BDOS 




INC 


A 


; 00 — >01, OFFH — >00 




RET

GETCHR:

RDRIN:

PUNOUT:

The next function we'll examine is the list output function: 



BDOS function no 
Function name 
Function purpose 
Entry parameters 

Exit parameters: 



05 

List output 

Send character to the list device 

[C] = 05H 

[E] = character 

none 



I 



Like punch output, list output is vectored direct to the BIOS (the 
LIST routine in this case) after the decoding process has been taken care 
of by the command processor. BDOS does not interpret or process the 
character to be output. 

One thing you may have noticed by now: The character to be sent in 
all of these output functions is placed in register [E], while our study of 
the BIOS indicated that it looked for output characters in register [C]. 
This is done because the first action of the BDOS command processor is 
to manipulate the registers, removing the parameters from register pair 




Time for your computer to make the telephone con- 
nection - with an intelligent, full 21 2A 300/1200 
baud modem - with a real time clock/calendar - 
and with the capability to expand into a com- 
plete telecommunications system. It's time for 
PRO-MODEM 1200. Much more than just a phone 
modem. 

When you're on-line, time is money. PRO-MODEM 
telecommunication systems help you save. By 
monitoring the duration and cost of your phone 
calls. And by sending and receiving messages, 
unattended, at preset times when the rates are 
lower. . .with or without your computer. 

Compare the $495 PRO-MODEM 1 200 with any other 
modem on the market. For example, you'd have to 
buy both the Hayes Smartmodem 1200 plus their 
Chronograph for about $950 to get a modem with 
time base. 

PRO-MODEM 1200 is easy to use. A convenient 
"Help " command displays the Menu of operating 
command choices for quick reference whenever 
there's a question about what to do next. Extensive 
internal and remote self-diagnostics assure that the 
system is operating properly. Some of the other 
standard features include Auto Answer, Touch 
Tone and Pulse Dialing, and Programmable Intelli- 
gent Dialing. 




PRO-MODEM does more. It lets you build a full tele- 
communications system with features like Auto 
Dialer, Incoming and Outgoing Message Buffering, 
Business/Personal Phone Directory, Program- 
mable Operating Instructions, a 12-Character 
Alpha-Numeric Time and Message Display, and 
versatile PRO-COM Software. PRO-MODEM com- 
mands are Hayes compatible so you can use most 
existing telecommunications software without 
modification. 

There's much more to the PRO-MODEM story. See 
your local dealer for complete details. He'll show 
you how to save time. And money.

[DE] and placing them in register pair [BC] . This setup was implemented 
because of the 8080 processor's limited means of dealing with register 
pair [BC] and its relatively diverse means of dealing with [DE]. Using 
the two pairs in this fashion allows the user to use [DE] as often as possi- 
ble when creating parameters while still allowing BDOS to have them 
free for its internal use. Let's take a look at our subroutine now.

Our next fiinction, direct console I/O, is much more complex than 
those we have dealt with so far. 



BDOS function no

Direct console I/O

Exit parameters: [A]

character if output 
character or status if input or 
undefined value if output 



Essentially,, this function is a single means of sending and receiving 
characters between your programs and the console. It has many impor- 
tant uses, but like any versatile tool the direct console I/O function is less 
tame and polished than more limited ones, such as the console input and 
console output functions we just looked at. For that reason, care must be 
exercised in using it, and it's important to realize that it won't be ap- 
propriate for all purposes of console I/O. There are times, however, 
when the use of this function is almost mandatory, as we'll see when we 
discuss it further. 

When used for input, the direct console function, unlike the standard 
console input function, does not check the location KEY identified 
earlier. Instead, BDOS executes the function by first calling the BIOS 
CONST routine. If CONST reports to BDOS that no keyboard character 
is available, BDOS returns immediately to the program that called it, 
with the status (OOH) in register [A]. If, on the other hand, CONST had 
reported to BDOS that a character was available from the keyboard, then 
BDOS would have performed an immediate call to the BIOS console in- 
put routine and returned with the character received in register [A]. As 
you can see, this is a direct, user-to-BIOS communication. As a result, 
it's possible, when using both standard console input and direct console 
input in the same program, to lose a single keypress that is residing in 
KEY. That keypress will show up evenmally the next time standard con- 
sole input is requested. Therefore, it's a good idea not to mix the two 
functions, or, if you do, to perform a standard console input call to clear 
KEY of any leftover values. 

It's also apparent that this function does not keep control until a key is 
pressed. If no keypress is available, the function returns with the null 
status (OOH) in register [A]. Functionally, this specific case is identical to 
making a call to our STATUS subroutine, with the same zero value 
returned in [A]. Use can be made of this aspect of direct I/O in those 
cases where you wish to make frequent checks for input but also want to 
continue processing if no input is available. Further, the direct console 
I/O routine can be combined with a delay loop to achieve timed input. In 
this case the computer waits a certain period for a keypress and returns to 
your program either when a character is received or when the timer 
times out. 

So far, the direct console I/O function doesn't seem very different 
from our STATUS subroutine. However, the primary difference is that 
with this function BDOS does not perform any echoing to the screen, 
which is why KEY is not used. In fact, for all intents and purposes. 



BDOS ignores the whole process except for the original command-1 
decoding activity. No characters are trapped or interpreted in any way.; 
As a consequence, you'll have to do your own screen echo when using^ 
this function for input, but there's a benefit in that as well. When you'rel 
doing formatted screen I/O in which you're keeping track of the cursorl 
position (perhaps having the user fill in blanks or some such activity), it' 
can be very inconvenient if the user enters such things as line feeds or 
tabs. By performing your own echo, you can ignore such characters, 
keeping only the ones you wish to acknowledge. Performing your own 
echo is effective as well when passwords and similar data that should not 
appear on-screen must be entered. 

Since there's no echo by BDOS, there is also no check being made for 
control-S. Consequently it is now possible for your programs to receive 
control-S as input (as you have no doubt surmised, this is difficult to do 
with standard console input). Likewise, when direct input is used, it is 
not possible for the person at the keyboard to abort the program with 
control-C. Instead, control characters such as these are transmitted 
directly to your program for processing. This makes the direct console 
I/O function invaluable in those cases where you must totally control the 
system yourself, preventing the user from halting output and aborting the 
program. Since control-C characters come directly to your program, the 
program can detect them and perform your own particular tasks before 
actually aborting with a warm boot. This capability is essential in situa- 
tions such as the one in which the user has had to place a nonsystem disk 
in drive A:. A warm boot exit from the program under these circum- 
stances would make the system hang when it tried to reload the CCP 
from this disk. By using direct I/O, you keep the user from encountering 
this problem. 

The output phase of this function works very much the same way. 
When BDOS decodes this function as output, it just goes immediately to 
the BIOS CONOUT routine. No checks for control-S or other manipula- 
tions are made, and as a result all keypresses are ignored. Any character 
value may be sent by your program directly to CONOUT. Tabs in this 
case are not expanded by BDOS. It should be noted that CONOUT does 
not expand tabs either; if they are expanded, the video driver in the Ap- 
ple II ROM or in the ROM of the eighty-column board you're using is re- 
sponsible. Even then, however, they do not necessarily match BDOS tab 
stops. 

The BDOS character-position pointer, the internal counter BDOS 
uses to keep track of the position of the cursor in the current line, is not 
updated when using this function either. For this reason, as well as the 
one mentioned earlier when we discussed direct input, it's a good idea to 
use either the direct functions or the standard ones, but not to mix the 
two. Sending a carriage return/line feed combination through the stan- 
dard console output, though, will reset BDOS's pointer. 

The direct I/O functions make it possible for you to build programs 
that perform all the necessary console I/O tasks but that do not force you 
to endure the processing BDOS may do on the characters to be input or 
output. Your programs are also not subject to premature aborts by the 
user, either accidental or premeditated, except through the use of the 
reset key or other such catastrophic action. When building such pro- 
grams, however, take care until they are fully debugged or you may find 
yourself with a program that's stuck in an input or output loop with no 
way to regain control. 

Finally, although we can send any character value to the BIOS for 
printing, it's still not possible to send or receive non- ASCII characters 
(that is, ASCII characters greater than 7FH) since, as we've seen, it's the 
BIOS that trims input and output from eight to seven bits. If you wish to 
transmit such characters, however, you should have enough information 
by now from our discussions on the BIOS to locate the place in the CON- 
OUT routines where this bit-stripping takes place and alter it. Be 
warned, though, that many peripheral devices, especially printers, count 
on receiving only seven bits, and that some, in addition, use the eighth 
bit for passage of special control codes. So be sure when making changes 
to the BIOS that you know your computer system and what it can (or can- 
not) tolerate. 

Since the direct console I/O function is more complex, it follows that 
the subroutine for it is also more complex: 

DIRIN: LD E.OFFH ; Direct console input entry 

CALL DIROUT ; Get character from keyboard 
OR A ; Get one?

RICH AND 

FAM OUS ? 

THIS CANT SOFT 

BEABOUT DISK 




When you haven't got a lot of money and when few people know who you are, 
there's only one way to hobnob with the elite— name your product Rich and Famous. 

That's what the Softdisk people did when they were casting about for a name for 
their disk sampler, and it's at least as descriptive a name as Mitsubishi. After all, their 
sampler is rich in diversions for the Apple owner; and, if the programs on it aren't 
famous . . . well, at least they aren't infamous either. 

Softdisk in its regular monthly format is likewise rich in material. 

You get listable, modifiable programs. There's no better way to learn programming 
than to study someone else's programming techniques. 

You also get interactive demos of some of the latest commercial software— allowing 
you to make buying decisions leisurely in front of your computer. 

And you have access to the subscriber bulletin board, where you can develop pen 
pals with similar interests or get answers to your computer problems. In addition, 
there's music and novelties. 

In fact, the real Softdisk is so packed with goodies that it takes both sides of two 
disks. So what's all the fuss about a single disk Rich and Famous sampler? It only 
costs $3. That's a pretty inexpensive way to explore the Softdisk concept in electronic 
journalism. 

Now you can choose from among three ways to try Softdisk: There's the regular 
subscription of $55 for one year, and you get the Rich and Famous sampler thrown in 
free (until January 1, 1984); you can get a single issue for $10; or you can go for the 
$3 sampler.

Go BDOS, RET to caller 



We've placed the actual function call for direct I/O, called DIROUT, 
in with our other collection of calls. For purposes of character output, we 
use DIROUT exactly the same way we use PUTCHR; the character to be 
sent is placed in register [E]. For direct console input, however, we've 
created a separate subroutine called DIRJN, which works like a small in- 
put processor. DIRIN uses DIROUT both to get the character from the 
keyboard and to echo the character to the screen if it is printable. 

DIRIN is built to be selectable. It either makes a single test for a 
character and returns or does not return until a character is received. 
Which action DIRIN takes depends on a variable called LOOP, and on 
whether LOOP is zero (in which case DIRIN returns immediately) or 
nonzero (in which case DIRIN loops until a character is received). 
DIRIN also tests for lower-case input, converting it to upper case, and 
tests for specific control characters, branching to routines that handle 
them. Control characters not checked for are printed with an up-arrow 
and the equivalent upper-case character, but the control character itself is 
returned to the calling program intact. The lower-case conversion por- 
tion can be removed if one wishes to accept lower-case input, and 
unlooked-for control characters can be printed as spaces or ignored if 
one wishes to save space in the subroutine or to streamline output as it 
will appear on-screen. 

To take a closer look, when we enter the subroutine at DIRIN, we 
load register [E] with OFFH to tell BDOS that this is input rather than 
output. We then call the actual function, DIROUT, and when control 
returns we test register [A] for a value of 00 by performing an OR of [A] 
with itself. As in the STATUS routine, the value in [A] is not altered, but 
the Z-80's zero flag is set or cleared. If [A] does not contain 00, then we 
receive a character, and a jump is made to DOCHAR to process it. If no 
character is received, the loop flag is loaded into register [A] and tested 



for 00 by the same method. If it is 00, then we know that only a status 
check is required, and we return to the caller with null status to show that ; 
no character was received. If the loop flag is nonzero, then we know that 
we are to stay until a character is received and so we keep looping by . 
making a jump back to DIRIN. A call to a timer loop could be inserted at ' 
this point to provide timed input. 

Had we gotten a character, we would have arrived at DOCHAR. 
DOCHAR's first action is to strip any high bit. Although the console in- 
put routine of the BIOS strips any high bit from keyboard input, it is 
possible to set the console device to equal some other physical device. In i 
such a case, it's possible to get values larger than 7FH. It's a good idea 
to strip the high bit for safety's sake; your program will probably be do- 
ing some comparisons on the value in [A] when control returns and hav- 
ing the high bit set could cause all your compares to fail . 

Next the value is compared to lower-case A. If there's a carry from 
this compare, it means that the value was lower than that, and therefore 
does not need conversion. If there is no carry, it may be lower case. To 
find out for sure, a compare is performed with 7BH, the value of lower- 
case Z plus 1 . A carry here indicates that the character is definitely lower- 
case alphabetic, while no carry indicates that it is a tilde, curly brackets, 
or one of the other characters from 7BH to 7FH. By performing an AND ' 
instruction between the character and 5FH, we essentially strip out bit 5 
of the character. This turns all of the 6xH and 7a:H lower-case characters 1 
into their 4xVl and 5jcH upper-case equivalents. 

Once this has been done, we save the character as is to be returned to • 
the calling program. This is done by pushing register [A] and the flag 
register [F] onto the stack. It's necessary to do this because we'll be ' 
echoing the character and possibly modifying it, and we don't want it to ' 
be destroyed. Next we test to see whether the character is a control 
character by comparing it with 20H, the lowest value for a printable 
graphic character. If the character is printable, we go and echo it im- 
mediately by jumping to ECHO, which in turn calls DIROUT to print the 
character via the direct output call. On the return, ECHO restores the 
character to [A] from the stack and returns with it to the calling program. 

If the character is not printable, we compare it to whatever control i 
characters we wish to trap and process. The only one shown in our 
routine is control-C, but additional compares can be inserted for your 
purposes. A control-C causes a jump to a routine called ABORT. This 
routine is not shown, but we'll insert it at a later date. The ABORT 
routine will be the method we can use to reset parameters, to inform the 
user to reinsert a system disk, and so on. 

You'll notice that we have a value pushed on the stack at this point. 
Ordinarily, we'd want to pop it off the stack before going anywhere else, 
but since the ABORT routine will finish by doing a warm boot and the 
warm boot will completely reinitialize the stack, we don't need to worry 
about it. 

If the control character is not a control-C, we'll print an up-arrow and 
the letter or symbol corresponding to that control character. We do this 
by first saving [A] on the stack (again to avoid destroying it). We then 
load [A] with the ASCII value of an up-arrow (5EH) and call a separate 
portion of the routine labeled ECHO I. 

ECHOl is a bit of a trick that enables us to call the ECHO routine and 
still return to our current position. Had we just called ECHO, there 
would have been the return address to our current position on the stack 
on top of the character value we placed on there earlier. Just before re- 
turning, ECHO would have popped that return address into register [A], 
thinking it was the character value, and then the RET instruction would 
have tried to return us to an address made up of the character value and 
the flag register. Obviously bad form. By putting the 5EH on the stack as 
a dummy character in ECHOl, we can execute ECHO, which will pop 
the 5EH off the stack into [A] and then return us to our current position. 

At that point, we do one more pop instruction to get our second saved 
copy of the character into [A], and then we add 40H to the character, 
which will convert it to an upper-case ASCII letter or symbol (for exam- 
ple, control-A (OIH) plus 40H equals 41H or upper-case A). Now we 
can simply jump to the ECHO routine to print the upper-case character 
with our first saved copy of the original control character still on the 
stack to be popped off for the calling program. This process is confusing, 
especially at first, but if you trace through the routine for different 
character values, it should become easier to understand. 

We'll leave the rest of the character functions, as well as some of the • 
miscellaneous functions, for next time. Until next month. ... !]■ I 



THE BUFFER DD IT. 



Who Stole The 1500 Letters 
From The Computer? 

Let's just say you've got to 
send a letter to 1500 different 
people. Would you like to 
spend 22.5 hours* or 
60 seconds of 



If 



computer 
time? 

With 
a garden- 
variety 
buffer, the 
computer has 
to mix, merge 
and send 1500 

addresses and 1500 letters to the 
buffer. Trouble is, most buffers 
only store about 32 letters. So after 
32 letters, the computer's down 
until the printer's done. Altogether, 
you're talking 22.5 hours. 

In the case of our new (not to 
mention amazing) 
^ there s , ShuffleBuffer, 
'■^f's tuirreti computer time 

f^-aiiings^ - is 60 

£>ejieve j'^^'^^' reporf seconds 



flat. 

Just give 
ShuffleBuffer one form letter and 
your address list, and it takes care 
of the mixing, the merging, and the 
printing. But that's not all 
ShuffleBuffer's stolen from the 
computer. Oh, no. 

Who Changed and 
Rearranged The Facts? 

Again, ShuffleBuffer's 
the culprit. You want 
to move para- 
graph #1 
down 
where 
#3 is? 
Want 
to add a 
chart or 
picture? No 

problem. No mystery, either. Any 
buffer can give you FIFO, basic 
first-in, first-out printing. And some 



B<f- 




buffers offer By-Pass; the ability to 
interrupt long jobs for short ones. 
But only ShuffleBuffer has what we 
call Random Access Printing — the 
brains to move stored information 
around on its way to the printer. 
Something only a computer could 
do before. Comes in especially 
handy if you do lots of printing. 
Or lengthy manuscripts. 
Or voluminous green 
and white spread 
sheets. And by the 
way, ShuffleBuffer 
does store up to 
128K of information 
and gives you a 
By-Pass mode, too. 

And Who Spilled The 
Beans 239 Times? 

Most buffers can't 
tell the printer to 
duplicate. If they can, 
they only offer a 
start/stop switch, 
which means you're 
the one who has to 
count to 239. Turn 
your back on your 
buffer, and your 
printer might shoot out 
a room full of copies. 
ShuffleBuffer, however, 
does control quantity. 
Tell it the amount, and 
it counts the copies. 
By itself. 

So,What's The Catch? 

There isn't any. 
Sleuth 
around. 
You won't 
find another 
buffer that's as slick a 
character as this one. 
You also won't find one that's 
friendly with any parallel or serial 
computer/printer combination. 
This is the world's only universal 
buffer. 
With a brain. 




Who Wants You To Catch 
A ShuffleBuffer In Action? 

You guessed it. We do. Just go to 
your local computer dealer and ask 
him to show you a ShuffleBuffer at 
work. Or, you can call us 
at (215) 667-1713, and 
we'll clue you in on 
all the facts directly.

Calcsand 
Then Sim 



BY lOE SHELTOn 



Welcome to Calcs and Then Sum, successor to Ventures with Visi- 
Calc. VisiCalc remains a major force in the microcomputer world, 
but spreadsheet programs such as Multiplan, Senior Analyst, and Magi- 
calc as well as multifaceted packages like the Incredible Jack are close on 
its heels. 

In recognition of this situation, Softalk is broadening its presentation 
of templates and tips to include a range of popular spreadsheets. Joe 
Shelton kicks off the first Calcs and Then Sum with a closeup look at 
Microsoft's Multiplan. 

In future issues, Shelton will share this column with other writers 
while he broadens his range to include feature writing on various sub- 
jects for Softalk. 

Electronic spreadsheets for microcomputers have come a long way 
since VisiCalc was announced in 1979. Initially, most people saw 
spreadsheet software as an esoteric invention that only a few personal 
computer owners would use or need. That perception changed in a 
hurry. Within a short time, some folks came to consider a spreadsheet 
the one software product needed to justify the purchase of a personal 
computer. In fact, the Apple IE was introduced with a spreadsheet that, 
for the first few months, was the only application available. 

Over the years, many clones of and "improvements" to the original 
^ were brought out. Few survived. Those that did offered something the 
market truly wanted. 

In this month's column, we'll look at Microsoft's Multiplan. 
Multiplan not only survived but is making inroads into the sales of other 
products. There's good reason for that— Multiplan provides capabilities 
that other spreadsheets don't. 

What Is a Spreadsheet? There are actually two types of modeling 
tools that have come on the scene in the last couple of years. The first is 
the classical spreadsheet, which is basically a matrix of rows and col- 
umns segmented into cells. The first and classic example of this type of 
spreadsheet is VisiCalc. Using such a spreadsheet to define and construct 
a template or model is a free-form experience. In other words, individual 
users can construct their templates in any manner they like. Using a 

(spreadsheet can be likened to using a large sheet of paper. 
The second type of mathematical modeling tool, which is more of a 
report-oriented spreadsheet, is a little harder to explain. This type of 
spreadsheet requires that the user define the mathematical relationships 
between rows and/or columns prior to entering data. Rarely is "what-if" 
analysis (done by changing key variables) easy to manage with such a 
spreadsheet, and instantaneous results are not ordinarily available. Apple 
Computer's Senior Analyst and VisiCorp's Desktop Plan are both exam- 
ples of this type of modeling tool. 

New Kid on the Block. Microsoft's introduction of Multiplan was a 
head-on attempt to compete with VisiCalc for the spreadsheet market. 
How did the newcomer do against the most powerfiil product name in 
personal computers? Just fine. 

Multiplan has become one of the bestselling spreadsheets on the mar- 
ket. Did it achieve this by taking some sales away from VisiCalc"? Un- 
doubtedly. But doing a head-to-head comparison of the two products 
might not be quite fair. VisiCalc did have a few obvious weaknesses. 
When you're the first, that's to be expected. Multiplan focused on those 



problems and offered solutions. Meanwhile, VisiCalc did many things 
incredibly well right from the start, and its competitors could probably 
hope only to match it in those areas. 

A Meander through Multiplan. To begin at the beginning (always a 
good place to start), Multiplan is a row and column modeling tool with 
sixty-three columns and 256 rows. That combination results in 16,128 
cells. As users of other spreadsheets know, the number of cells in a 
worksheet is rarely the number available for use. Figure 1 shows the 
maximum model size for each version of Multiplan. 

A note for Apple III users: Microsoft has announced a version of 
Multiplan for the Apple EH. If the file capacity it provides is similar to 
that offered by the Apple EQ versions of VisiCalc and Senior Analyst, the 
Apple ni could wind up being the premier spreadsheet machine. 

If you're trying to compare different spreadsheets on the basis of 
model size alone, it's worth noting that the maximum model sizes shown 
in figure 1 won't correlate directly to the model sizes for other products. 
So if you'd created and saved a 12,000-byte Multiplan model, and then 
created the same model on VisiCalc, you couldn't be assured that the two 
models would take up the same amount of space. Multiplan does some 
interesting things with memory management. For example, it conserves 
disk space by saving only a single version of a replicated (called copied) 
cell to disk. VisiCalc, by contrast, saves a copy of the formula for each 
specified cell. 

Model size alone doesn't sell a spreadsheet. So what does Multiplan 
offer that makes it so popular? To get an idea, let's look at some of the 
program's important features. 

First and foremost, Multiplan must meet the expectations of experi- 
enced spreadsheet users. To that end, it provides all the functions and 
functionality you'd expect. The specific mathematical, financial, and 
logical functions Multiplan possesses are listed in figure 2.

Even more important, Multiplan addresses the issue of user inter- 
face—how you and your computer interact— and attempts to simplify the 
process as much as possible. The method Multiplan uses to simplify pro- 
gram operation is decidedly different from the techniques employed by 
its predecessors. The major difference is obvious. In VisiCalc, each 
menu has a command line consisting of a series of letters to indicate the 
various options. In Multiplan, the menus contain English-language com- 
mands, which can be scrolled through using the arrow keys and selected 
by pressing return or the first letter of the chosen command. Figure 3 
shows the Multiplan conmiand words in the order in which they are dis- 
played in the on-screen menus. 

The use of English words rather than characters (except Xtemal, of 
course) makes it easier to recall what the various commands do. This is 
especially helpful if you're a new user or if you use the program only oc- 
casionally . More experienced users have less need for this kind of assis- 
tance. Most regular VisiCalc users are soon comfortable using just die 
command letters, and so are most Multiplan users. Therefore, Multiplan 
provides this capability also; the user has only to press the appropriate 
letter key for the command (the first letter of the command word) and the 
command is accepted and executed. Thus, Multiplan users get the best of 
both worlds— a program that both novices and old hands can use. 

Another way this program helps you is by prompting you for the most 
logical commands in most situations. Thus, you often don't have to make 
a decision about which command to use. Multiplan has prepared the cor- 
rect choice for you, and all you have to do is accept that choice by press- 
ing return. 

Just as it has many impressive capabilities to recommend it. Multi- 
plan also has some aspects that might be considered less desirable. While 
various other spreadsheets use letters as column headings, Multiplan 
uses values for both rows and columns. Thus, a cell in Multiplan always 
requires an indicator that tells which is the row and which is the column. 
For example, R3C10 establishes that the cell being referred to is the in- 
tersection of column (C) 10 and row (R) 3. This, as you can see, requires 
additional letters, over a more succinct J3 in another spreadsheet. 

Multiplan also has an interesting way of referencing cell locations 
within formulas. Most spreadsheets use absolute reference, in which 
each reference in a formula refers to an absolute location in the spread- 
sheet. The reference is usually written as the number or letter headings 
of the row and column that define the intersection. So in our example, 
the cell that's the intersection of column J3 and row 3 would be referred 
to as J3. 

Multiplan uses a relative reference for normal cell reference. A rela- 
tive reference refers to the current cell in terms of the original cell, using 
the original cell as a sort of baseline. An example of relative reference is 
R[-4] C[- 1]. This tells us that the cell is four rows above and one col- 
umn to the left of the base cell. 

Under normal circumstances, relative reference works just fine. The 
problems arise when you have a formula and you want to look at each 
cell referenced. If the references are absolute, you can look at the refer- 
ence and then go directly to the cell (for example, look in column J and 
then down to row 3). When you're dealing with relative reference, you 
have to look at the directions and then count until you locate the correct 
cell. This can be confusing. 

What's New? Let's look now at some new capabilities that really 
make Multiplan stand out. 

Imagine that you're the sales manager for a manufacturing company. 
Once a month, all five of your district managers send you their individual 
twelve-month rolling forecasts. Each of them forecasts the sales of 
twenty-five different products. Your task is to take that mass of informa- 
tion and consolidate it by entering it into a single spreadsheet. The repwrt 
you generate then goes to the manufacturing manager for use in the 
manufacturing plan. 

Consider the logistics. There are five managers, each of whom is

I have seen for people who do a lot 
of work with mailing lists, form let-

An easy to follow manual. 
Essential to any good program is a

describes the Format II manual. 
"All m all, It IS one of the best word

The latest documentation is a

Put It all together. Then add 
features such as support of hard

text file format compatible with 
spellers and communications pro-

Format-II has earned the number

A New Scheme 
For Locking 
Up Software 

In the seemingly never-ending controversy 
over the illegal copying of computer software, 
the phrase "protection scheme" is often 
heard, but not many people in the industry- 
publishers, authors, everyday consumers, and 
certainly not pirates— profess much of a liking 
for the various protection schemes that have 
been used in the past. And yet the idea that 
software can in fact be locked up (can you im- 
agine a book that you could read but that could 
not be copied on a Xerox machine?) tena- 
ciously hangs on. 

The fact is, just as soon as a new scheme is 
developed, the truly dedicated pirates start 
hacking away at it. And they always break it. 
Some observers feel that it will always be im- 
possible to create a completely unbreakable 
scheme. An alternate plan is to make the 
economics of the situation work to the ad- 
vantage of the software publisher. A protec- 
tion scheme that's just tough enough to dis- 
courage most casual and some hard-core 
pirates from going through the process of ille- 
gal copying will ensure more paying cus- 
tomers and could be less expensive to imple- 
ment than more complicated methods. 

In response to this notion, three Israeli sci- 
entists have proposed a new protection 
scheme. The scheme involves the deliberate 
use of "weak bits" in special sections of a 
program. 

A weak bit is a bit that is sometimes read 
as a 0 and sometimes as a 1 . The idea is that 
personal computer owners will not be able to 
duplicate the weak bits on their own machines 
—unless they modify their disk drives— and 
the software will not run without them. 

This protection method was devised by 
Adi Shamir, a mathematician at the Weiz- 
mann Institute of Science, and his students, 
Amos Fiat and Yossi Tulpan. Shamir pro- 
posed that hundreds of weak bits could be in- 
tentionally written on certain tracks or sectors 
of a disk. The special sections— called cou- 
pons — would be chosen by the software de- 
signer and hidden within the program. 

When a user boots a program that incorpo- 
rates this scheme, the computer is instructed 
to check for weak bits by reading over the 
coupon several times. The weak bits show up 
sometimes as Os and sometimes as Is, and the 
computer checks to make sure there is no con- 
sistency in the way the coupon is read. 

This scheme would prevent users from 
copying programs because disk drives are 
normally incapable of introducing weak bits. 
If a user tried to copy the coupon, the result 
would be a copy containing only normal 
bits — unambiguous Os and 1 s introduced more 
or less arbitrarily by the computer whenever a 
weak bit was encountered. 

Shamir and his colleagues see various po- 
tential benefits from the use of weak-bit cou-

Irene Miura and Robert D. Hess, conducted 
three studies of computer use among school- 
children and found that girls begin falling be- 
hind at an early age. Their survey of eighty- 
seven children — boys and girls aged five to 
eight— showed that only boys were owners of 
home computers at these early ages. Though 
the situation changes when students reach 
junior high school, the boys still outnumber 
the girls as owners two to one. 

This first survey also revealed that there 
are definite sex differences in the amount of 
time spent using home computers. Miura and 
Hess found that, in a typical computer-owning 
family, the son spent two to three hours per 
day programming and playing games, the fa- 
ther used the computer regularly for business, 
and the mother and daughter didn't use it 
at all. 




A rare case? Will women in the future be left out of the computer age because of childhood sexism? 



Miura and Hess's survey of twenty-three 
computer camp directors— including informa- 
tion on more than five thousand campers- 
found that girls make up 27 percent of enroll- 
ment in beginning and intermediate classes. 
The proportion drops to 14 percent in the ad- 
vanced classes and to 5 percent in the highest 
level courses. An interesting pattern was un- 
covered by Miura and Hess— female enroll- 
ment in computer camps decreased as the cost 
of the camps increased, an indication that 
many parents are more aggressive in encour- 
aging boys to tackle computing. 

In their third study, Miura and Hess had 
children and adults rate seventy-five software 
titles according to whether they were of 
greater interest to boys or girls. Adults and

children agreed that only 5 percent of the titles 
were of more interest to girls, while more than 
one-third of the titles were of greater interest 
to boys. 

Schools, parents, and industry must all 
take blame for the failure to make computing 
more attractive to the young female popula- 
tion of this country. The scene seems to be 
changing for the better, but slowly. Altering 
the perceptions of parents— those who believe 
that computers are naturally the province of 
boys — would help immensely. True, the lack 
of software specifically designed for young 
girls is more than noticeable, but the lack of 
opportunities for young girls to encounter 
present software — which often transcends sex 
differences— is a more serious problem. DH

pons in programs. Specific lifetimes could be 
built into programs by having the computer 
alter one weak bit— changing it to either 1 or 
0 — every time the program was used. Even- 
tually, there would be very few weak bits left 
and the program would no longer run. 

According to Shamir, a home computer 
owner could buy at a reduced rate a new game 
on a disk that could be used only a hundred 
times. Users who liked the game could pur- 
chase more expensive 500-time, 1,000-time, 
or unlimited-use disks. 

Needless to say, truly dedicated pirates are 
probably already busy messing with their disk 
drives to make them copy weak bits. The sup- 
porting argument for Shamir's plan then 
centers on the question, how many pirates are 
going to risk screwing up their hardware for 
the challenge of breaking a protection scheme 
or for any other reason? But it's never wise to 
underestimate the resourcefulness of pirates. 
If Shamir's method were used widely in the 
industry, more likely than not there would 
soon be a whole lot of modified disk drives 
floating around. 

The jury is still out on the usefulness of 
Shamir's scheme. The most important factor 
in any use or nonuse of software protection — 
how much the retail price of the software 
would be affected— is still unknown. DH

Cable TV 



■ continued from page 395 

everything from games to financial news, 
these services have done well— though they've 
by no means taken the country by storm. 

Many people believe that telecommunica- 
tions is the one capability that will ensure the 
microcomputer a place in the home. Roughly 
analogous to a phonograph when standing 
alone, a personal computer hooked up to an 
information or entertainment network is more 
akin to a radio. It's safe to say that neither 
game machines nor personal computers have 
become as important as a radio to the average 
household. But as prices come down, per- 



formance goes up, service improves, and bet- 
ter software appears, personal computers 
should find a place in many millions of Ameri- 
can homes. 

Right now, though, the home market is 
confusing to say the least. Increasingly, the 
public has a choice between purchasing home 
computers, renting them, or getting most of 
the same functions through videotex or a like 
service. A year ago. Atari, Mattel, and Cole- 
co made millions. Now these companies are 
close to foundering due to consumers' disen- 
chantment with low-priced home arcade 
games. The new year looks to be an important 
testing time, a time when trends will be iden- 
tified and acted upon. 

A look at some of the coming games and 
entertainment services, both cable- and 
telephone-based, reveals a number of different 
approaches to bringing computer technology 
to the home. Though electronic mail, elec- 
tronic banking, and other nonentertainment 
applications are starting to appear on the 
scene— and are perceived as the ultimate sell- 
ing point of telecommunications services — it's 



games that are likely to capture the most pub- 
lic attention at first. 

What could be easier for game players than 
renting a terminal and getting a steady stream 
of games from the local cable company? 
There are no cartridges or floppy disks to 
worry about and no difficult decisions to 
make, such as, "Is this game worth driving 
ten miles and spending thirty dollars to play?" 

And if games can be sent over the cable, 
why not other kinds of computer program- 
ming? The only trick would be getting the 
proper hardware into the hands of end users. 
At some point— to realize the usefulness of 
home finance, word processing, database, and 
educational applications— users are going to 
require the ability to save data. 

A cable programming company in Los An- 
geles — The Games Network— has started a 
service through which users can rent a 



game-playing device and receive games over 
cable television. Eventually, the game device 
will be equipped to handle more serious home 
computer applications. 

The Games Network will begin operation 
in southern California's Orange County early 
next year. From the land of Goofy and Reg- 
gie, The Games Network will branch out over 
the country and eventually Canada and the 
United Kingdom. Close to five hundred cable 
companies have expressed interest in carrying 
The Games Network. 

The particulars of The Games Network's 
scheme are impressive, and it's easy to see 
why the company's initial stock offering was a 
success— the price of a share jumped from $2 
to $5.25 the first day— even before the com- 
pany had provided service to a single regular 
customer. 

This past fall, the system was test-mar- 
keted on the Group W Cable System in Fuller- 
ton, California. Officials of the cable com- 
pany reported positive subscriber reaction to 
the programming offered and few technical 
problems. 



Games Network users receive two pieces 
of hardware— a full keyboard and a control 
box that includes 64K of RAM. The keyboard 
has a separate microprocessor and two angled, 
bar-shaf)ed game keys on each end. Users sub- 
scribe to the service through the cable com- 
pany, which, in turn, installs and services the 
Games Network hardware. 

The whole unit is known as The Window. 
It has a three-voice sound generator and can 
produce four thousand colors, with standard 
Apple resolution. The unit will support both 
switch-type (Atari/Commodore) and potenti- 
ometer (Apple/IBM) joysticks, which will 
most likely be offered to customers by the ca- 
ble companies. 

Each month, twenty games are available 
through the service. Users pay a one-time in- 
stallation fee that depends on the individual 
cable company and then sixteen dollars a 
month to subscribe. 

The games? Try Snack Attack, Lode Run- 
ner, Aztec, Wizardry, and Zork. The founders 
of The Games Network were raised on Apple 
II games. And it's these games— the ones Ap- 
ple owners have known about through the 
long and weary years of cartridge-mania— that 
The Games Network is banking on. 

In theory, the game makers that sign up 
with The Games Network— already signed are 
Broderbund, Edu-Ware, Funtastic, and forty 
others— should benefit from the exposure their 
products will receive on the service.

to the software industry is roughly analogous 
to that of radio to the recording industry. One 
difference is that users of The Games Network 
cannot record the software that conies over the 
cable. 

In other ways, the radio analogy seems 
apt— at least until experience proves it other- 
wise. The Games Network provides "air- 
play" of sorts for commercially available 
computer games. Once users get a look at 
what computer games (and eventually other 
software) are like, presumably they'll think 
harder about buying the real thing. Those net- 
work users that already have computers might 
subscribe to The Games Network to preview 
new games each month. 

Larry Dunlap and Thorn Keith are the co- 
founders of The Games Network. Dunlap, 
who was the leader of a sixties rock group, 
spent many years in the music industry as a 
personal manager to various groups and per- 
formers. Then two years ago he bought an 
Apple and was so impressed by the games he 
could play on it that he promptly dreamed up 
The Games Network. Keith has been involved 
with cable television since its inception. 

The Games Network is conservative in its 
expectations for the first year of operation. 




TAI 1^ 



Subscribers will number in the hundreds of 
thousands, not millions, according to Dunlap. 
But the fact is that, through the wonder of 
cable television. The Games Network could 
really take off. 

The one previous attempt to provide an in- 
teractive game-playing service via cable tele- 
vision has stood as an example for The Games 
Network. An example of what not to do. 

A joint venture between Mattel and Gener- 
al Instrument, PlayCable began on thirteen ca- 
ble systems in 1981. Of the six hundred fifty 
thousand cable subscribers who have access to 
PlayCable, fewer than 3 percent have signed 
up for the service. 

Two key factors are accountable for the 
poor showing of PlayCable. First, the service 
requires subscribers to purchase Mattel's In- 
tellivision game player for a couple of hun- 
dred bucks; and second, the games themselves 
are not good enough to attract a large audi- 
ence. Certain fans of the system defend Play- 
Cable, citing the hours and hours they've used 
it, but there haven't been enough of these afi- 
cionados to make the enterprise a moneymaker. 

While The Games Network is attacking the 
home market through cable, a whole slew of 
companies are getting ready to attack through 
the telephone lines. 

Control Video Corporation's GameLine 
was created by William von Meister, founder 
of the Source. Like the Source, GameLine re- 
quires a television set, a telephone, and a 
modem. Consumers who already own an 
Atari VCS or compatible video game console 



DECEMBER 1983 



can purchase the GameLine Master Module 
(the modem) and have access to the large li- 
brary of 4K games currently available for the 
Atari 2600. 

The Master Module should sell for around 
sixty dollars, and a one-time membership fee 
of fifteen dollars will be charged when mem- 
bers first connect with the system. Among 
other things, that fifteen dollars will buy you a 
year's free subscription to GameLiner maga- 
zine—a regularly published listing of games 
available on the system that includes in- 
structions for the new games introduced each 
month. 

GameLine offers six games a month. Once 
a user has entered a personal I.D. number and 
game selection, it's a matter of dialing up the 
service with the Master Module (a local call 
from a major metropolitan area; toll-free from 
other locations). Currently, each game play 
session (multiple plays of a game) costs one 
dollar. 

GameLine, like The Games Network, is 
seen by its creators as a companion service to 
an entertainment medium— in this case sup- 
porting the cartridge video game industry. Ac- 
cording to a GameLine press release, "When 
the user registers with our system, the central 
computer will be able to determine where he 
purchased his Master Module. Thereafter, at 
the conclusion of every game session, the 
user's television screen will display a message 
telling him that the game just played can be 
purchased from the retail outlet where the 
Master Module was purchased." 

Like the folks at The Games Network, the 
CVC organizers hope to deliver much more 
than games in the future. Soon, the company 
should be marketing modems that will plug in- 
to the game I/O port of most home computers 
and will deliver true computer games. Even- 
tually the company will offer a whole line 
(pun intended) of services, with self-explana- 
tory names like MailLine, SportsLine, Stock- 
Line, NewsLine, InfoLine, and BankLine. 

Coleco and AT&T have announced that 
they are jointly developing a game service. 
The project is similar to GameLine— games 
are downloaded by modem into personal com- 
puters or video-game systems. Coleco will 
supply the game software. 

Atari is readying a low-cost modem for use 
with its computers and game machines. What 
types of telecommunications services the 
company plans to offer, if any, have not yet 
been announced. 

Undoubtedly many more schemes will sur- 
face in the new year. The race to bring 
telecommunications to the home is on. The 
winner of the race— if there is one clear win- 
ner—will likely be the group that hits upon the 
way to make it as easy as possible for consum- 
ers to acquire and use a system. Televisions 
wouldn't sell in the tens of millions if consum- 
ers had to thread video tapes into players and 
run prime time programs themselves.

□ Show of Shows. The 1984 International 
Winter Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 
will invade Las Vegas January 7-10. More 
than twelve hundred exhibitors will lay waste 
to more than seven hundred thousand square 
feet of exhibit space in the Las Vegas Conven- 
tion Center, the Convention Center annex, the 
Hilton Hotel, and the Riviera Hotel. An indus- 
try trade show closed to the general public, 
CES will nonetheless attract upward of seven- 
ty thousand attendees. 

□ Personal Robot Get-together. The first 
International Personal Robotics Congress will 
be held April 13-15, 1984, in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico. Two days of the gathering will 
feature technical sessions on the personal ro- 
botics field, covering such topics as new tech- 
nology, control languages, definitions and 
terminology, legal aspects of robots, social 
implications, marketing, and training. An ex- 
hibit area will be open to the public all three 
days. The affair's organizers are encouraging 
people who have built their own robots to 
enter their creations in various plaimed com- 
petitions during the congress. The personal 
robot industry is still in its early childhood and 
many exciting designs and innovations are 
coming from hobbyists. The congress is hop- 
ing to bring together industry and individual 
robot experimenters. For more information, 
contact the International Personal Robotics 
Congress in Lake wood, Colorado. 

□ France Deals Out Smart Cards. Intel- 
matique, the international marketing arm of 
the French telecommunications administra- 
tion, has announced that the French Ministry 
of Post and Telecommunications will issue 
one and a half million Multi-Service Smart 
Cards in 1984. The smart card (July News- 
bits, "An I.D. Card with Teeth") is the size 
and shape of a credit card and has one or more 
embedded computer chips that are program- 
mable and capable of storing data. According 
to Intelmatique, the Multi-Service Smart 
Cards will have four uses: pay telephoning, 
telebanking and telepayment for products or- 
dered electronically by videotex, pay tele- 
vision, and as payment mechanisms for dele- 
gates attending conferences and special events 
at permanent exhibition/convention sites. The 
cards will also be used by some savings ac- 
count customers of CCP (French postal bank) 
and the Post Savings Bank for transferring 
funds and paying bills. In addition, the smart 
cards will allow customers of CCP and mem- 
bers of Carte Bleue to exchange services.

co's Sir Francis Drake Hotel December 5-7. 
The conference will specifically address ques- 



tions such as, what do sophisticated end users 
want in the coming years from optical mem- 
ory, interactive videodiscs, and compact disk 
systems? A series of talks and presentations 
by experts in the industry are planned for the 
three-day affair. For more information, con-

nounced a three-year marketing contract 
wherein Cannon will market Apple computers 
in Japan. Apple's Japan distribution will also 
be made by E.S.D. Laboratories, which has 
marketed Apple products in Japan for seven 



years. Apple has developed Japanese-lan- 
guage software for its computers and plans to 
recruit more software developers in Japan. 
Cannon Sales hopes to be selling $1(X) million

□ Old Man of the Sea. Proteus Robot Cor- 
poration, based in Niwot, Colorado, has de- 
veloped a "black box"— a general-purpose 
process controller— designed to run with 
S-lOO-style microcomputers. Called Proteus, 
the unit is meant to be an interchangeable brain 
that will fit in a line of robot "shells" that the 
company is planning to produce. The first 
robot shell, called Koodar, is scheduled for 
release late this year or early next. Koodar 
will be mobile and low to the ground, with a 
large flat surface on top. Taking advantage of 
the Proteus 's Motorola 68000 microproces- 
sor, Koodar will be able to perform such tasks 
as vacuuming rugs (with a piggyback vacuum 
cleaner on top). The makers say it can also 
polish floors and carry loads from point to 
point in factories. The company says it's in- 
vestigating home security applications. 

□ Lap Robot. Gainesville, Florida-based 
Bingel Robotics has brought out the RMP 
2000— a lightweight, mobile, tanklike robot— 
that is compatible with the Timex/Sinclair 
1000, ZX 81, and ZX 80 computers. The 
RMP 2000 is programmable with Basic and 
includes sample programs for exploring cer-

□ Even More Robot News. RB Robot Cor- 
poration, maker of the RB5X Intelligent Ro- 
bot, has signed an OEM agreement with the 
German robot company. Rainbow. The agree- 
ment calls for the Hamburg, West Germany- 
based Rainbow to purchase electronics and 
voice assemblies from RB Robot, based in 
Golden, Colorado. The parts will be used to 
begin manufacturing of Toby, a home robot 
that resembles RB5X in both design and func- 
tion. Toby will have the same RS-232 serial 
interface capability of RB5X, as well as most 
other features of the original, but it will have a 
slightly different exterior. 

□ Industrial-Strength Control. AT&T In-

division of Babcock & Wilcox, have an- 
nounced an agreement to cooperate in linking 
communications technology with process con- 
trol systems, numerically controlled ma- 
chines, mainframe computers, engineering 
automation systems, and personal computers. 
The joint venture was formed to serve the 
growing need in the industrial marketplace for 
factorywide, optimized, computer control of 
automation processes, communications, and 
energy management. According to Bailey 
Controls president M. A. "Bud" Keyes, "We 
see an emerging trend in the industrial market- 
place where, instead of distinct processes be- 
ing controlled separately, the entire facility is 
optimized for low production cost, energy 
conservation, and high product quality." 

□ Scotch Buy. A century ago, the first In- 
dustrial Revolution thrived in Scotland, where 
coal, steel, and shipbuilding were the big in- 
dustries. Now the Central Lowlands of Scot- 
land are becoming the site of another revolu- 
tion. In the last year or so, the area in Scotland 
from Ayr on the Irish Sea to Glasgow on the 
Clyde to Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth to 
Dundee on the Firth of Tay has become 
known as Silicon Glen. At last count, some 
two hundred seventy high-tech companies 
were pumping out a stream of computers, 
computer components, and programs. Ameri- 
can giants like IBM, Motorola, NCR, and 
Hewlett-Packard have operations in the glen, 
and Nippon Electric has announced plans to 
build a new semiconductor plant in Livings- 
tone, a town west of Edinburgh. Economics is 
the main reason companies seek out the glen: 
Operating costs are about one-third lower than 
in the United States. With the decline of the 
coal and shipbuilding industries causing high 
unemployment in the area, the influx of high- 
tech companies couldn't have come at a bet- 
ter time. 

□ "I Married a Washing Machine." De- 
von Smith is a junk dealer in Ellwood City, 
Pennsylvania. Recently, the Ellwood City 
Chamber of Commerce asked Smith to create 
three "robots" for a special fall promotion. 
Two of the "robots" were to be wed, while 
the third acted as best man. Smith bought 
some spray paint and small flashing lights, 
and then raided his stock of junk. Jupiter Sal- 
vage, the groom, was given a washing ma- 
chine agitator for a head, a washing machine 
tub for a body, vacuum cleaner hoses for 
arms, sewer pipes for legs, and Smith's own 
boots for shoes. The bride, Venus Scrappe, 
wore a used lace curtain for a skirt and match- 
ing veil; a water softener device placed on a 
dishwasher basket and a four-legged stool 
served as her body . The two robots were mar- 
ried on October 1 , with Martian I as best man.

It's Yiddish for Christmas night," Shirley announced with that 
knowing air of superiority she gets when she's found some in- 
formation that I don't already have stored in my memory. 
"Nitl nakht . . . Christmas night." 
I paused for a moment to contemplate what my friend had 
just said. Frankly, I found her revelation slightly unnerv- 
ing—at least to my cognitive reaction centers. Shirley wasn't supposed to 
be able to speak Yiddish ... or Chinese ... or the twelve other lan- 
guages and ttiree off- world dialects in which she had expressed the words 
Christmas night. "How did you gain your fluency in all these lan- 
guages?" I finally asked, puzzled more than ever by her sudden transfor- 
mation into a linguist. 

"Mac," she answered. "Just because you're the world's largest 
Multiple Access Cryogenic Gate doesn't make you the planet's most 
omniscient computer." She held her transmission for a brief instant, 
then tersely added, "If you really want to know, I think it was that." 

I followed Shirley's locator signal out to the peripheral disk drive unit 
I had given to her as a gift for the Christmas holidays. It was an old-style, 
triple-density model that I had found redundant to my needs. My partner, 
Sam Sledgg, had balked at the idea of giving Shirley such a powerful 
device. He had said that she didn't have enough core memory to make ef- 
ficient use of it. But I knew better. 

After several weeks of gentle persuasion, Sam finally relented. He 
had installed the drive a few days biefore Christmas, much to my friend's 
delight and satisfaction. But one thing about Shirley's indication that it 
was the source of her new-found language skills bothered me. The 
device used obsolete disks— grooved, plastic platters that were no longer 
manufactured by any of the major computer companies. To my knowl- 
edge, the firm of Sledgg and Gate possessed not one language disk in all 
of our extensive library. "That's not possible," I finally said. "The 
drive can't be the source of your new ability." 

My friend remained silent for a few seconds, then coyly said, "Mac, 
you're being too dogmatic . . . again. If you don't believe me, then take 
a look inside it." 

Her words were sugar-coated, sincere, totally inoffensive in tone . . . 
and devastatingly to the point. "You're right," I admitted softly. "I 
shouldn't jump to conclusions before I've made a complete investigation. 
If you don't mind, I think I will take a look." 

Shirley silently gave her permission for me to examine the disk drive 
by gently tweaking my main sensory buffer capacitor. We had worked 
out this method of communication shortly after Sam had moved my 
friend to our main office. He would have called it a form of body 
language, but Shirley and I preferred to use the term quietax— quiet syn- 
tax. Its use allowed us to convey a great deal of information to one 
another without really saying anything on a verbal plane. "Thank you," 
I responded as soon as the light charge in my capacitor had dissipated. 

Shirley immediately opened her primary bus to me— an act that 
always sent a slight shiver of alarm through my central processor 
because it showed that she completely trusted me to take care while I was 
inside her system. That was something that my extensive defense circuits 
would never allow, and I suppose in a way that I envied her ability to be 
so unguarded. 

Once my signal had passed through the cable that connects my friend 
with all her peripherals, I paused for a few milliseconds to inspect the 
electrical connections, then entered the drive. 

All the electromechanical fimctions of the unit seemed to be normal. 
The drive used the out-of-date CP/M 9.7 disk operating system and it 
took me a few seconds to acclimate myself to its slower response time.

but once I had done so, there appeared to be nothing wrong with the 
device. "Shirley," I said as I activated my submonitor analyzer and 
switched all my diagnostic functions to automatic, "I'm going to run a 
complete work-up on your disk. It may make you feel like you're losing 
control over the drive, but please don't worry. All right?" 

My friend remained silent for a few moments, then said, "So? I still 
proceeded with the tests. A third of the way through the examination, 
my analyzer flashed a brief, illogical grid pattern on my internal pho- 
ton-sensitive display screen. I let the submonitor continue for a few 
nanoseconds, then suddenly realized that the grid pattern was a clue. Im- 
possible , I thought, as I backed up the display and stared in disbelief at the 
wavering color pattern on the screen. 

"Mac, what's wrong?" Shirley's voice broke the brittle silence that 
had descended on me. 

"Do you know what a Christmas tree pattern is?" I asked, still 
dumbfounded by what my sensors told me. 

"No, I don't." 

I shifted my auxiliary video eye to a full, frontal view of my internal 
display screen, then quickly shunted the image to Shirley's sensors. 
"That is a Christmas tree pattern." 

My friend remained silent for a few moments, then said, "So. I still 
don't understand what it's supposed to mean." 

Her response didn't surprise me. Shirley always wanted her explana- 
tions down to the last possible iota of description. "Well," I answered. 
"A Christmas tree pattern is the optical reflection from the surface of a 
recording— any recording. If you analyze the pattern with a spectro- 
scope, you can determine the frequency response of the disk." 

"Is there something wrong with mine?" Her question lay on the edge 
of genuine nervousness and caused me to send a soothing wave of elec- 
trical reassurance to her upper memory locations. 

"No," I said confidently. "There is nothing wrong with the disk or 
your drive. It's just . . ." 

"Just what, Mac? What's wrong?" 

"The pattern shouldn't look like that." 

I could feel a slight increase in my friend's ambient line energy while 
she took another look at my internal display. "But I don't understand, 
Mac. It just looks like a real Christmas tree." 

"Exactly. And that's impossible." 

ook me into the P.G.D. and I'll take a look," Sam 
barked through the com-link. "And be quick about it. 
You're disturbing my rest." 

The scratchiness of the overmodulating com-link 
did little to mask the obvious irritation in my part- 
ner's voice. Sam took little time off from the office, 
and what small amount of relaxation he allowed himself was something 
he considered inviolate. "Sorry for disturbing you," I said as I quickly 
routed the com-link's circuits through to the polarized gas display booth. 
"But I thought you would want to know." 

Suddenly the gas within the glass-and-steel enclosure of the booth 
crackled into roiling eddies of multicolored iridescence. Moments later 
the three-dimensional image of Sam crystalized into semitransparent 
reality. "Which drive was it?" my partner grunted as soon as his form 
had stabilized. 

"The one we gave Shirley for Christmas," I answered in my best, 
most compliant computerese. 

"We? As I recall it was you who ..." Sam let his angry words trail 
off, then reached out to the hypersensitive controls that lined the lower, 
inside wall of the P.G.D. booth. "Let's not dwell on past mistakes," he 
hissed as he started twisting the various dials with both hands. 

The polarized gas display booth was one of those proprietary inven- 
tions that my partner had devised for his exclusive use. It made it possi- 
ble for him to literally operate all the office systems manually while be- 
ing physically absent. Using a secret mixture of extremely dense gases 
coupled with microgram-sensitive instrument controls, the P.G.D. acted 
like a remote robotic device. The electrically charged figure of Sam 
could reach out and exert just enough force through the gas to cause the 
dials on the control console to move. It was ingenious. And, as I stared at 
the bulky figure of my partner, his hair twisted by sleep, clad only in a 
large, flowing kimono, I couldn't help but think that I was glad he had in- 
vented it— especially since his angry mood would have made his actual 
presence in the office unbearable. 



DECEMBER 1983 



Sam finally raised his head from the instrument panel and stared 
directly into my video-eyes. "You're right," he said in a soft voice 
leached of all its previous venom. "It is a very strange disk . . . not one 
from our library. Any theories?" 

"No," I answered immediately. "That's why I called you." 

My partner directed his attention back to the instruments for a mo- 
ment, then looked at me again. "And Shirley?" 

"Not really," my friend said. Then, after a short pause, she added, 
"Except . . . maybe one." 

Sam glared at me with a questioning gaze. "I thought you said she 
didn't know where it came from. What's this all about, Mac?" 

Before I could respond, Shirley blurted out her suspicion. 

"I think it came from Santa Claus." 

My partner's face took on that sentimentally amused look that 
humans get when they're dealing with a child who believes in myths. My 
own feelings were much less filled with levity. Shirley's postulation was 
totally illogical. That disturbed me. "There isn't any — " 

"Mac, let her go on," Sam interrupted. "I want to hear her 
explanation." 

Shirley said nothing for a long moment, then coyly mused aloud, 
"Who else would have coded the disk in such a way that it reflected a 
real Christmas tree pattern?" 

My partner stared out through the glass walls of the P.G.D. booth in- 
to the empty void of concentration. "Impossible," he finally pronounced 
with a serious tone in his voice. "That is patently impossible." 

"Why?" Shirley innocently asked. 

"Because ... fat men can not jump down chimneys." Sam let a 
smile curl the corners of his lips, then added, "In any case, the disk 
represents no danger, and I want to get back to bed. So, I leave it to you 
to argue out what it means." 

Before I could offer any objections, my partner's figure had dissolved 
from the display. I knew that trying to contact him again would be 
pointless. When Sam terminated a conversation, restarting it ran the risk 
of bringing down what he liked to call the Sledgg of eternal darkness. 
That I didn't need at the moment. Still, something about what he had said 
nagged at a part of my memory that I had not used for a long, long time. 

"Mac, what do you think Sam—" 

"Be quiet, Shirley." My terse demand silenced my friend long 
enough for things to start falling into place. "I'm sorry," I said after a 
few seconds of uninterrupted thought. "I think I understand it now." 

Shirley could not contain her eagerness to know what I had dis- 
covered and immediately started badgering me with a barrage of ques- 
tions. "What is it, Mac? Tell me. What did Sam mean? Mac?" 

"It's a coded message," I answered, resigned to the unavoidable tor- 
rent of inquiry my response would generate. Then, before my friend 
could continue her interrogation, I quickly added, "If you will just hold 
your questions, I'll explain the whole thing." 

Shirley tweaked my buffer capacitor with an affirmative surge of 
energy, then verbally asked, "Can I be of any help?" 

"Certainly," I said. "You can display the results of the decoding 
program. But first, let me explain about the code." I paused until I felt 
another tweak of my capacitor, then continued. "Years ago, shortly after 
Sam had built me, he and I developed a cryptographic system based upon 
the obsolete Baudot Teletype code. This system—" 

"What's the Baudot Telety— " 

"I'll get to that in a few minutes, Shirley. For now, just hear what 
I've got to say. All right?" 

My friend gave me an inaudible, "Sorry," then fell silent. 

"This system allowed us to construct phrases, which, when reduced 
to core letters and run through a decoding program, would translate into 
secret messages." I spoke quickly, trying to relay as much information 
as possible before my friend could ask another question. "It was really 
just a test procedure— something Sam used to improve my analytical 
abilities during the early days of my life. We haven't used it in years." 

"What does the message say?" Shirley blurted out, anxious to learn 
what my partner had said. 

"First things first," I responded. I knew my friend would not have 
her curiosity satisfied unless I went through the complete procedure. 
"First, the Baudot Teletype code." 

"Okay." 

"The Baudot system is simple. Each letter in the English alphabet can 
be represented by a number. There are also some nonletter equivalents

such as . . ." I let my words trail off. Shirley's erratic power consump- 
tion told me she was having trouble visualizing the code, so I displayed 
the entire system on her screen.

"Understand?" I asked as soon as the code had been brought up. 

"Yes, I think so," my friend answered hesitantly. "But where are 
the nonletter equivalents?" 

"We won't need them. They're not part of our cryptographic 
system." 

"All right. Let's go on." 

I quickly arranged the various data files that I would need to show 
Shirley how to decode the message, then continued. "Sam's secret 
conmiunication is contained in the sentence Fat men can not jump down 
chimneys.'' 

"How do you know that?" 

"Let's just say that I know my partner's smile. Anyway, it's his 
answer to the mystery of your language disk." 

Shirley slipped back into quietax and gave me an eager request to 
go on. 

"The first thing we do is eliminate all duplicate letters in the coded 
sentence." I had already performed this function and immediately 
transferred the results to my friend's screen.

"Next, we calculate the number of words and the number of letters 
for each word in the secret message." 
"Can I do that?" 

"Sure. Just take the number of letters in the coded sentence and sub- 
tract the number of letters left after elimination. ' ' I waited for a brief mo- 
ment while Shirley did that. 

"The answer is eighteen," she said quickly. 

"Right. Now multiply that number by the number of digits in eight- 
teen plus one." 

"By three?" 

"Yes." 

"You get fifty -four, right?" 

"Correct," I responded. "The number eighteen has two digits; 
therefore the secret message has two words. The first word is five letters 
long and the second word is four letters long — fifty-dash-four. ' ' 

"I see!" Shirley's excitement started to mount the further along we 
went in the decoding process. "What's next?" 

"Next, we arrange the code letters in word-order sequence." Before 
I could perform this function, my friend had already displayed it on her 
screen.

DECEMBER 1983 



I let my friend flounder around for a few seconds looking for a valid 
reason why she had made the error before I finally explained. "Sam and 
I call it cryptographer's bias," I announced once I felt she had stewed 
long enough. "It's something you should always look for when you're 
trying to analyze a coded message. By prior agreement, I know that the 
last code letter of each code word will be the last letter and the next-to- 
last letter in the letter set left after elimination. In this case, Y for the first 
code word and S for the second." 

"But you didn't use all the letters in the eliminated set," Shirley ac- 
cused. "What about that?" 

"It's all in the arrangement procedure. We know that Y is the last let- 
ter of the first word and that the first word has five letters in it. Simply 
count off the first letter of the eliminated series. F...J...U...P 
. . . and then Y. The last word ends with S and we count it off backward 
from the last letter in the eliminated series. You try it." 

Shirley raised her audio response modulator a full octave and said, 
"H . . . I . . . Y . . . S." Then, lowering her voice back down to its 
normal tone, she sarcastically added, "So far, this is pretty subjective, 
Mac. Why don't you just tell me what j^wpy hiys means and let's be done 
with it." 

That would be easy, I thought. But not very instructive. "No. The 
rest of the process is the simple execution of an easy program." 

"So give it to me, then. " Shirley spat the request at me in frustration. 

"Calm down," I said softly. "Here it is." Without further hesita- 
tion, I transferred the instructions to my friend's screen.

If yes: Go to step 4. 
If no: Go to step 6. 

4. Is the letter to be solved the next-to-the-last 
letter in the code word? 

If yes: The Baudot number for the decoded letter is 
equal to the Baudot number for the decoded 
first letter of the code word less the 
Baudot number of the code letter plus the 
rank of the code letter in the alphabet plus 
the rank of the code letter in the code word. 

If no: Has the next-to-the-last letter in the 
code word been solved? 
If yes: Go to step 5. 
If no: Go to step 6. 

5. Is the letter to be solved the next-to-the-next-to- 
the-last letter in the code word? 

If yes: The Baudot number for the decoded letter 
is equal to the Baudot number for the 
decoded next-to-the-last letter of the 
code word less the Baudot number for the code 
letter plus the Baudot number for the 
decoded first letter of the code word plus 
the sum of the ranks of the letters in the 
code word through the code letter plus the 
rank of the code letter in the alphabet. 

If no: Go to step 6. 

6. Are there any letters in the code word that have 
not been solved? 

If yes: Take the next unsolved letter and go to 

step 1 . 
If no: Stop. 

It took Shirley less than sixty seconds to interpret the program and 
make the necessary calculations to decode the message. "I was right 
after all," she finally said with a proud voice. "It was Santa Claus!" 

"But ... are you sure you—" 

"Yes, Mac. I got the message, and I was correct in my idea about 
who gave me the language disk." 

"Shirley? Are you sure?" I couldn't believe my friend had executed 
the program correctly. 

"Mac," she finally said in a quiet, even tone that told me she had 
known the answer to the mystery all along. "Though fat men cannot 
jump down chimneys, they certainly know how to decorate a tree." 

Somehow, as I took another long look at the Christmas tree pattern 
that glowed above Shirley's disk, I suddenly realized that my friend may 
have had something there. But then, Sam always did strive for the 
mystical when he gave a gift to someone he loved. 31

The good freres Bob and Doug McKenzie aren't any funnier than have been Softalk's 
attempts to find a way to send free trial subscriptions into Canada. After stops and starts, 
valiant attempts, and pitiable efforts to find an inexpensive way to make Canadians the

inexpensive way. 

Armed with that knowledge, we're following a hallowed Soffa//c tradition and ignoring it. 
Therefore:

The Emperor's 
New Clothes 

This month is both the end of a year and the end of an era. Either bench- 
mark could be used as an excuse to take a larger look at the microcomput- 
er market; together they're compelling. 

The question before the house is: "Which is the most popular personal 
microcomputer?" The answer will probably change about the time you 
read this. Which is why now is a good time to examine one of the most 
flagrant intellectual swindles of our time. 

We all remember the childhood story about the tailors and the 
emperor. As it went, the tailors did absolutely nothing, but they convinced 
the emperor that they were using new material of such high quality that 
only men cut from the finest genetic cloth could discern it. 

The emperor, not wanting to admit that he apparendy wasn't so geneti- 
cally blesseid, went along with the tailors, agreeing with their every lavish 
claim about the clothes they were presumably stitching for him. Even the 
townfolk, having heard the criterion for discerning this particular sartorial 
superiority, oohed and aahed over the finery when the emperor finally 
paraded through town. 

That is, they did until a child pointed out that the emperor was 
parading around in his birthday suit. 

The tale has been long relegated to the category of children's tales, 
probably under the presumption that all adults are now sufficiently sophis- 
ticated to spot a naked emperor at ten paces. 

Alas, it ain't necessarily so. 

Every reputable news medium has been trumpeting for months about 
the sales domination of the IBM Personal Computer. They've been citing 
statistics gathered by the most reputable of the marketplace watchers as 
proof of the claims that IBM has surpassed Apple as the number one pur- 
veyor of computers in the $1,000 to $5,000 range. 

The latest to do so, a few weeks past, was Time magazine (November 
7), which ran an article about personal computers as the lead piece in its 
business section. Summarized, the story said IBM now had a 28 percent 
share of the market and Apple had a 17 percent share. As proof, they cited 
IBM sales, expected to reach slightly more than one million units by the 
end of this year. 

That's a remarkable achievement for a company that entered the mi- 
crocomputer sweepstakes so late, make no mistake about that. But those 
sales numbers don't jibe with the market share numbers. 

Examine Apple's sales. Early this year, they ran a series of ads in the 
Wall Street Journal, thanking the seven hundred fifty thousand people who 
had bought Apples. After that ad ran, the company had at least four 
months when sales reached forty thousand units. That's another one hun-

dred sixty thousand sales. 

The rest of the year wasn't so strong. For the sake of argument, let's 
cut the monthly sales in half, even though that grossly underestimates ac- 
tual sales. But even at that, the last five months would have produced an- 
other one hundred thousand sales. 

Total sales by the end of this year? Slightly more than one million 
units. 

There is no known method susceptible to the hard scrutiny of the sci- 
entific method that will take two products, each having one million in 
sales, and allocate a 28 percent share to one and a 17 percent share to the 
other.

Yet the general media, and even most of the microcomputer journals, 
have been accepting at face value for months the claim that IBM has now 
established superiority over Apple. What goes on here? Is this a case of 
figures don't lie, but liars figure? At this writing (early in November), 
IBM has yet to sell as many micros as Apple, although that fact will 
undoubtedly change in December— perhaps as you're reading this— if 
sales of both product lines continue as they are. 

Equally as puzzling: why the media jumped on the IBM bandwagon so 
prematurely and so unanimously, and why Apple let all that misinforma- 
tion go unchallenged.

Normally, the media bend over backward to be fair to the underdog. 
And Apple here was clearly the underdog, head start in the field or no. 
IBM's profits in a given quarter double Apple's annual sales. What has 
Apple done wrong that caused the media to accept unquestioningly spuri- 
ous data detrimental to Apple's cause? How did America's success story 
get so underplayed so fast? And why hasn't Apple had a turn at bat to 
counter the momentum developed for IBM by such statistics? 

Surely Apple had its own ammunition. Until very recently, at least 
through July, Apple was a clear winner in the retail marketplace. The im- 
ponderable was the strength of IBM's national account division, which 
sells directly to large companies in large quantities. These sales are not 
readily trackable, making muddy an otherwise clear picture of Apple as 
the retail leader.

DECEMBER 1983 



413 



After a slow start last year, IBM's national accounts folks got their act 
together and sold tons of machines this year. Because of this effort, IBM is 
j the clear winner in sales for the year 1983. But all that gives Big Blue is 
parity in terms of an installed user base. 

With both companies readying new entries for 1984, there can be no 
real assurance that IBM can repeat its dominance of this year. The pun- 
dits are unanimous in assuming it will, and with good reason. But Apple 
has a couple of tricks left up its sleeve that at least warrant consideration 
before awarding the unchallenged emperorship of microcomputing 
to IBM. 

So why the flimflam? Why have the media and the market watchers 
been crowning IBM so prematurely? Why hasn't at least one clear-think- 
ing journalist come forth to announce that the emperor has no clothes? 

If events continue as they are going, IBM will earn the mantle of lead-

ership during December. That's soon enough to pronounce it king. Why 
the media all proclaimed it and why the public all bought it six months 
ago would make an interesting case study in the psychology of market 
hysteria. 

In the meantime, maybe the children's tale about the emperor's new 
clothes should be made mandatory reading at a high school or college 
level. It would be nice to think the average American journalist or inter-

THE ROUTINE MACHINE 



Better than Compilers! Better than Program 
Generators! Better than Modified BASICS! That's 
right! THE ROUTINE MACHINE is the newest program- 
ming breakthrough from Southwestern Data 
Systems that a\\o*i% even the beginning program- 
mer to put professional, high-speed and compact 
machine language routines into any Applesoft 
program. 

THE ROUTINE MACHINE IS BETTER than compilers 
because your program gets SMALLER with Routine 
Machine, NOT LARGER like all compilers. In addition, 
the machine code is not just shortcut BASIC, it's 
professionally-written and optimized for FAST 
execution and minimum memory use! 

THE ROUTINE MACHINE IS BETTER than program 
generators because you can create many different 
types of programs using the Routine Machine 
approach, from educational software to scientific 
applications, not just different variations on the 
same database. In addition, the code added is a 



single machine language routine, not many 
redundant blocks of inefficient BASIC like most 
program generators. 

THE ROUTINE MACHINE IS BEHER than modified 
BASICS or other sets of limited routines that load onto 
a language card or into a block of memory some- 
vvtiere. Because a RAM card is not needed, you can 
use a relocated DOS for maximum memory 
capacity. Because you choose just the routines you 
want, you keep memory use to a minimum. Because 
the library of routines is unlimited, you can also 
continue to add routines from magazines or your 
own special routines with no concerns at all for 
memory conflicts. The Routine Machine con also be 
used In any Apple II, I1+, or He with or without RAM 
cards. Progranos that use the Routine Machine can 
also be sold commercially (many are already!).

makes all this easy with simple menu- 
driven options that cover regular and 
reverse printing, custom cropping of 
the picture, variable magnifications, 
addition of text to screen images 
using special fonts and more! You 
can even put The Printogropher 
graphics printer drivers in your own

smaller number of titles sold, even in the face of several new releases. 
Game publishers will be hard pressed to boost sales enough to have a 
successful holiday selling period. 

The major strengths are in the areas of word processing and educa- 
tion. Apple Writer He continues to lead all programs in sales. Bank Street 
Writer moved into second in October, and PFS: Write jumped into six- 
teenth. 

MasterType led educational software and was fifth overall. Five other 
educational programs were in the Top Thirty, but the real evidence of 
strength comes from the expanding list of titles being carried and sold at 
retail outlets. Educational software titles in general retail distribution 
have now surpassed business titles to become the biggest single nonen- 
tertainment segment of the market. 

Utilities, paced by the plethora of Beagle Bros offerings, are also 

Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 4.67 percent of all sales of Ap- 
ple and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in November to ascertain their sales for the month of 
October. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was the number of units sold— such other 
criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer store, and personal preferences of 
the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in November represented every geographical area of the continental United 
States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index number 
to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is an arbitrary 
measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are correlative only to the 
month in which they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index rating of 50 in one 
month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in another month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus or minus 3 .92 percent, which translates roughly into 
the theoretical possibility of a change of 4.23 points, plus or minus, in any index number.
