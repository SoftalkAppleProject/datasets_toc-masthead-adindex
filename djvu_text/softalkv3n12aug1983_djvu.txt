projected tax return for next year.

unlimited number of itemized lists and add to them throughout the year. 
Purchase our low-cost update at the beginning of the next tax season 
and see your files transferred to the new IRS format automatically. The

CONTEST: 

Help Wanted 



Did you know that before Ronald Reagan 
got into politics he was an actor? Of course you 
did. But did you also know that before that he 
worked as a counter person at Burger Palace? 
Probably not, since he didn't. But you can just 
imagine his job resume: "President, United 
States of America, 1981 -present; Governor of 
California, 1967-1975; order taker at Burger 
Palace in Dixon, Illinois, 1927-1930." Okay, 
maybe not. 

It works the same way in the microcomput- 
er industry. Before a lot of people in this biz got 
where they are today, they held numerous other 
interesting jobs. What do you think they did 
back in the early seventies? It probably had lit- 
tle to do with Apples, since the word apple in 
those days meant pie and sauce, not PIE and 
SOS. Which brings us to this month's contest. 

On page 4, you'll see a whole bunch of pic- 
tures of a whole bunch of people who make up 
the Apple world. On page 6 you'll see a list of 
various positions they used to hold. Can you 
match the occupation with the person? Could 
you do it for $100 worth of Apple accessories? 
Good! Roll your tongue back into your mouth 
and let's get started. 

There are two ways to win. 

The First Way. The first way is to match 
the person with the occupation. Just number 
your paper from one to twenty and write the 
corresponding person's name next to each num- 
ber. Next, find the occupation you think each 
person used to hold, and write down the letter 
that precedes it next to that person's name. If 
you'd like to do this with a word processor or a 
typewriter so we can read your entry, the more 
power to you. 

Whoever matches correctly the most peo- 
ple with their former occupations will become 
the Softaik Personnel Administrator of the 
month and will be entitled to a $100 shopping 
spree in the computer store of his or her choice. 
On us. 

Most of the answers can be found in those 
Softaik?, you put on the top shelf many months 
ago (we don't write the Exec series for nuth- 
in'!). Others can be found by a process of elimi- 
nation (someone as young as Lord British 
couldn't have been a former Vietnam com- 
manding officer, for example). So get out the 
mags and get to it. 

If you choose this way to win, print the 
words What they were on the front of your en- 
velope and on your entry form. This way, you 



won't end up being scored in the wrong cate- 
gory. 

The Second Way. This way is more fun; it's 
for people who don't have the resources for the 
first way to win. Some people just look like they 
might have held a certain job. Can't you just 
picture Ken Williams as a country bar bouncer? 
Dave Gordon as a used car salesman? How 
about Bill Budge as a young Chachi (as in Joan- 
ie Loves . . .)? 

Just number your paper from one to twen- 
ty with each person's name by the number as 
before. Then, next to each name, put down a 
letter corresponding to the occupations you 
think they look like they might have held. If you 
don't know, then guess; if you can't guess, then 
make one up. 

Entries in this category will be scored 
against the answer key made up by a consensus 
of the contest staff. Answers are purely subjec- 
tive; no debating will be allowed. 

The winner of this category will win the cus- 
tomary $100 in advertisers' merchandise that we 
usually give away in these alternative contests. 

If you choose this way to win, print the 
words What they should have been on your en- 
velope and on your entry form. 

It ought to be fun, and it will be. So send in 
your entry with the information below post- 
marked by September 15, 1983. You must write 
either What they were or What they should have 
been on your entry so that we know which cate- 
gory to judge you in. 

Send your entries to Softaik Job Hunt, Box 
60, North Hollywood, CA 91603, postmarked 
by September 15, 1983.

ALL NEW GAMES FROM PENGUIN! 



Minit Man by Greg Malone 



When the first wave of robots hit the bridge you were having lunch. By the time 
you climbed Into your chopper and reached the gorge, the damage was done! The 
bridge was shattered. That was about the time the radio started squawking about 
Incoming missiles. 

Your silos are empty, awaiting three interceptor missiles that had just been 
prepared for launching. Unfortunately, they are loaded on trains on the other side 
of the gorge, unable to get across the damaged bridge. Your job is to repair the 
damage and set the launch computer. 

Simultaneously, the enemy's robots have penetrated the building complex in an 
attempt to sabotage the computer. If you don't stop them, saving the bridge 

would be pointless. ibHO OC

And here to present the award for Oscar predictions is Jean Mattson, owner of ComputerLand, Gillette, 
Wyoming. That's Oracle winner David Miles accepting the award for himself. 



One thousand two hundred twenty points. 
That's all Jeremy Stamer (Glen Rock, PA) 
scored on his Maypole contest entry, and that's 
all it took to win. 

Stamer's entry consisted of six chains four- 
teen links long, earning ten points per link (6 X 
14 X 10 = 840 points). Nineteen of the eighty- 
four links were Apple-related, giving him a 
bonus of twenty points each (19 X 20 = 380), 
for a total of 1,220 points. 

With his maypole points in hand, Stamer 
will be marching down to his store to pick up a 
Kraft joy.stick and Strategic Simulations's Cos- 



mic Balance. 

Stamer's entry was not the longest, nor was 
it the one with the most Apple references. But it 
was the one with the best combination of the 
two. 

Hot Fun in the Summertime. The winner of 
the fifth part of the Oracle contest was decided 
on July 4. That part, you might recall, required 
contestants to predict the high temperature in 
San Jose on Independence Day. 

San Jose isn't exactly known for its cool 
temperatures, but it's not exactly Palm Springs, 
either. The safest thing to do would have been

to pick a temperature not too low and not too 
high, and that's what most people did. 

According to the National Weather Ser- 
vice, San Joseans held their annual weenie 
roasts, picnics, and potato sack races in a siz- 
zling ninety degrees Fahrenheit. According to 
the random number generator, David Cook 
(Decatur, IL) was selected from a field of just a 
handful who predicted that temperature. 

"I had pretty much given up hope of win- 
ning anything," said Cook, whose other predic- 
tions included Sally Field as Best Actress and 
Leadfoot as the Kentucky Derby winner. 

Cook won't care what the weather is like 
when he goes trotting down to Main Street 
Computer in Decatur to pick up Infocom's 
Zork II and Sir-tech's Legacy of Llylgamyn. 

The race for the Apple lie goes on. The 
leaders are mostly the same, but there has been 
some jockeying for position coming down the 
final stretch. Michael Wolgelenter (Palo Alto, 
CA) moved up from third to first this month 
with forty-five points; June's winner, David 
Miles (Gillette, WY), held on to his second- 
place spot with forty-four; Edward Radan- 
ovich (Bellevue, NE) dropped from first to 
third with forty; Carl Webb (Vista, CA) kept a 
grip on fourth with thirty-four points; and a 
newcomer, Geraldine Bass (Williamsburg, VA), 
joined the top five this month with twenty-seven 
points. 

Report back here next month when June's 
final-exam scores come in. Class dismissed. Hi

System Sayer~ 

The most impuriant peripheral for your Apple n and^ He, 




For Line Surge Suppression 

The SYSTEM SAVER provides es- 
sential protection to hardware and 
data from dangerous power surges 
and spikes. 




SYSTEM SAVER 
APPLE II 



By connecting the Apple II 
power input through the SYSTEM 
SAVER, power is controlled in two 
ways: 1) Dangerous voltage spikes 
are clipped off at a safe 130 Volts 
RMS/175 Volts dc level. 2) High fre- 
quency noise is smoothed out be- 
fore reaching the Apple n. A PI type 
filter attenuates common mode 
noise signals by a minimum of 
30 dB from 600 khz to 20 mhz, with 
a maximum attenuation of 50 dB. 



For Cooling 

As soon as you add 80 columns or 
more memory to your Apple II you 
need SYSTEM SAVER. 

Today's advanced peripheral 
cards generate more heat. In addi- 
tion, the cards block any natural air 
flow through the Apple n creating 
high temperature conditions that 
substantially reduce the life of the 
cards and the computer itself. 



For Operating Efficiency 

SYSTEM SAVER contains two 
switched power outlets. As shown 
in the diagram, the SYSTEM 
SAVER efficiently organizes your 
system so that one convenient, 
front mounted 
power switch 
controls SYSTEM 
SAVER, Apple H, 
monitor and printer 



MONITOR 








APPLE »^Bi 



Available m 220/240 Volt 50 Hz 




SYSTEM SAVER provides cor- 
rect cooling. An efficient, quiet fan 
draws fresh air across the mother 
board, over the power supply and 
out the side ventilation slots. 



The heavy duty switch has a 
pilot light to alert when system is 
on You '11 never use the Apple power 
switch again!

Fastalk is a quick guide to popular, specialized, 
new, and classic software. When you need a particu- 
lar kind of program or just want to see what's new, 
Fastalk is the place to look for fast answers. 

If a program has been reviewed in Softalk, it car- 
ries the issue date of the review in italics at the end of 
its listing, and the capsule description given reflects 
the published review. 

A new software entry, which must be of profes- 
sional quality to be included, is designated by a check 
mark preceding its name. A new entry loses its check 
mark after its first appearance and drops out of 
Fastalk after one to three appearances (depending on 
genre) if it fails to gain popularity. 

A bullet preceding a title indicates a program that 
Softalk has designated as a classic, based on its ability 
to stand up over time, its significance for its time 
(breaking new ground or introducing a new genre), or 
its archetypal qualities. 

Other entries in Fastalk are there either by virtue 
of current activity (the programs are selling at least as 
much as the least-selling entry on any of the bestseUer 
charts) or because they are representative of the best 
of programs for a special interest or need (such as 
card games or non-Basic-specific language terminal 
programs). 

Softalk may arbitrarily omit any package from 
Fastalk, whether or not it meets the foregoing 
criteria.

aliensjour Kids can 
instead of destim 




This year, thousands of Kids will be 
searching for the most amazing thing 

At Spinnaker, we don't believe in the 
"kill or be killed" concept behind nnost 
connputer games. In fact, we believe 
computer games should be instruc- 
tive, hot destructive. Butjust as 
importantly, they should be fun. 

That's why Ih 5EARCM Or TME MOST 
AnAZIhQ TMIM(j'"i5 designed to let your 
kids negotiate with aliens instead of destroy- 
ing them. Because given the opportunity 
' kids enjoy using their minds. 
It's Amazingly Fun. 

The Most Amazing Thing is out there 
somewhere. Finding it won't be easy 
But relax, your kids will have the 
help of their old uncle Smoke Bailey 
hle'll give them a B-liner (sort of a 
cross between a hot air balloon 
and a dune buggy) to use on their 
journey They'll have to learn how to 
fly the B-liner and navigate it through 
storms and fog. But before they do 
anything, your kids will have to talk to Old 
5moke. He'll tell them about the Mire People 
and the strange language that they speak, fle'll 
also tell them to avoid the dangerous Mire 
Crabs and how to get fuel for the B-liner 

Your kids will visit the Metallican Auction 
where they'll trade with the aliens for valuable 
chips. Your kids will then use these chips to buy 
things they'll need for their trip, And your kids 
will learn how to fly over the planet using their 
jet pack. 

The Most Amazing Thing 
holds great powers, but it will 
take great skill, persistence 
and imagination to find it. 
It's Amazingly Educational. 

iri5EARCMOFThEM05T 
AMAZIMQ ThlllKj is written by 
Tom 5nyder, educator and 
author of the best-selling 
Snooper Troops™ Detective 

Series. 

And like all Spinnaker games, Ih 
SEARCM OF TME MOST AMAZIhQ TFIIhQ has rea 
educational value. For instance, your kids wl 
sharpen their ability to estimate distances and 




quantities. And since they'll be navi- 
gating their B-liner, they'll become aware 
of distance, direction and time. They'll also 
develop a knack for economic and monetary 
principles through trading with the aliens. 
And they'll solve problems through trial 
and error 

They'll learn all of these things, plus they'll 
learn that nothing is impossible if you put your 
mind to it. 

A Hovel Approach to Computer Games. 

Besides offering your children all of the above, 
Ih SEARCM OFTME MOST AMAZIhQ TMIhQ gives 
them an opportunity to develop their reading 
skills. Because included with the game is Jim 
Morrow's new novel The Adven t ures of Smoke 
Baijey' So your children will have hours of fun 
reading the book or playing the game. And 
they'll be learning at the same time. 
Parental Discretion Advised. 

If you're a parent who would rather see your 
kids reason with aliens than destroy them, 
you've got plenty of reasons to 
ask your local software retailer 
for Ih SEARCM OF TME MOST 
AMAZIhQ TMIhQ. It's compatible 
with Apple,® IBM,® Atari,® and 
Commodore 64™ computers. 
And it offers so much fun you'll 
probably be tempted to play it yoursel 
Or you can write us directly at: 
Spinnaker Software, 215 First Street, 
Cambndge, MA 02142. 

You'll find this is one computer game that 
won't alienate you from your 





We make learning fun.

A few months ago, Jennifer would 
rather have gone to the dentist than 
do her spelling homework. 

Then Mom bought Crypto Cube™ 
by DesignWarer Now Jennifer has 
become a word fiend. In fact, she spends 
hours paging through the dictionary 
to find words that will stump her par- 
ents. And, as she does, she builds 
her word skills. 

Crypto Cube, like all DesignWare 
software products, combine computer 
game fun with sound educational 
principles. 

THE THREE DIMENSIONAL 
COMPUTER WORD PUZZLE. 

Five minutes after Jermifer sat down 
at the computer witii Crypto Cube, she 
was hooked. First she worked her way 



through the many word puzzles that 
come with the game. Then her parents 
typed her spelling homework into 
new puzzles. 

Then Jennifer started making puz- 
zles for her parents! 

So now. Crypto Cube is the favorite 
family game in Jennifer's home. 

As Jennifer would say, "indubitably."

# S.A.M. is the Software Automatic 
Mouth, a speech synthesizer for Apple 
and Atari computers made by Don't Ask. 
S.A.M. uses your computer to simulate 
the sounds of human speech. You use 
S.A.M. to make your programs talk. 

# S.A.M. does it all in software. It's a pro- 
gram -the only one of its kind. This means 
that S.A.M. has the power of a hardware 
speech device without the high price. 

# S.A.M. expands the power of your 
machine. Adding speech is like adding 
graphics - suddenly you can do things 
you never considered before. Use S.A.M. 
to write practical things: learning tools for 
young children, business software with 
spoken instructions, programs that tell 
stories or read aloud. Write creative new 
games with characters that converse or 
opponents that crack jokes. S.A.M. is 
great fun to use, because it's a new play- 
ground for your ingenuity. 

# S.A.M. is for anyone who can write a 
program, from the newest BASIC beginner 
to the machine language master. It's so 
easy to use S.A.M. to make a program 
talk, there's almost nothing to it. 

# S.A.M. is capable of endless variety. 



You can control S.A.M. 's inflection, 
change the pitch of S.A.M.'s voice and 
the speed of S.A.M.'s speech. Use pho- 
netic inputto get perfect pronunciation; or 
use RECITER, the excellent English text- 
to-speech converter on the S.A.M. disk, 
for highly reliable results with ordinary 
English input. 

With the new KNOBS feature you can 
create a variety of different voices for 
S.A.M. - not just higher or lower voices, 
but ones that sound like different people 
speaking. You design S.A.M.'s vocal 
personalities. 

Get your Apple or Atari a Software Auto- 
matic Mouth,- and discover the excite- 
ment of computer speech.

"Once use of the joystick and concept of matching is understood (in Learning 
with Leeper), a pre-reader can use these programs with little or no intervention. 
The joy of discovery learning in "Screen Painting" and the solid counting, shape 
and letter recognition skills developed in other programs make this one of the 
very best pre-reading programs on the market today."

Children don't hold back. If they like something, 
you'll know it. If they don't- well, you'll know 
that, too. When it comes to children's education, 
parents and teachers are just as honest - 
it's love or loathe, no in between. 

That's why Hi-Res Learning ™ games

challenging workouts in basic skills,

parents and teachers alike.

card provides the Epson printers with just 
about the same quality print as the daisy- 
wheels! And these fonts can be accessed 
by all software, even copy-protected 
diskettes. 

SUPER-MX Roman font is 
the standard. 
Epsons can now print Elite 
with the SUPER-MX card. 

Other optional font styles are available 
in addition to the standard Roman font 
that just plug into the extra sockets 
provided. They come in pairs so you can 
add a total of four extra fonts. Orator 
Large comes with Letter Gothic. Script 
comes with Olde English. 
LETTER GOTHIC is 
modern looking. 
ORATOR is easy to read 
and good for speeches.

Game Time 

It's about time! Finally, after what seems like a 
six-month rest, a group of good Apple games 
appears. Incidentally, why is it that all the new 
software seems to come out around the Christ- 
mas holidays, when you can least afford to buy 
anything new for yourself? 

On to one minor gripe — why do software 
companies so often start to advertise a new 
piece of software so far in advance of when it is 
actually ready? They could save the poor stores 
and mail-order houses a lot of unnecessary 
questioning about release dates if they would 
wait until a month or even a few weeks before 
release. Or they could follow the style of 
Broderbund, which apparently finishes pro- 
grams first and advertises later. 

Now to sing my praises of three new games: 
The Mating Zone, from Datamost; Hard Hat 
Mack, from Electronic Arts; and Zaxxon, from 
Datasoft. All are excellent, with good graphics 
and good play. Best of all, my husband and I 
would like to extend our profound thanks to 
Zaxxon and to Datasoft for restoring our faith 
in our Apple. We were so disappointed with the 
graphics of Frogger that we were almost afraid 
to buy Zaxxon, fearing an equal desecration of 
a fine arcade game. The Apple version of 
Zaxxon is outstanding.

Nominations 

To respond to Leroy Stone's challenge in the 
June issue to identify companies that give good 
support after the sale, I'd like to nominate two 
of my personal favorites: Videx Corporation 
and Gold Disk Software. Videx has always 
handled my technical requests promptly and 
professionally. Gold Disk has never let me 
down, as other catalog mail-order houses have. 
The people at Gold Disk give me honest and re- 
liable service and go out of their way to get spe- 
cial information such as technical data on the 
Japanese import disk drive I purchased from 
them last spring. 
Ken Fleer, Newark, DE 

Get the Picture? 

I read a lot of negative comments about the 
perils of purchasing mail-order computer equip- 
ment. I would like to share a positive experi- 
ence I had recently. I bought an Amdek Video- 
300 monitor from a mail-order house in Cali- 
fornia. I live in Louisiana, so I was worried 
about what would happen if I didn't get what I 
wanted, or if I had any problems with defective 
merchandise. The advertisement touted a one- 
year warranty from Amdek. 

I prepaid and soon received the merchan- 
dise. A short time after hooking the monitor up 



to my Apple II Plus, I noticed that the picture 
would not remain steady. Every now and then it 
would jerk slightly. This got to be distracting 
after a while, so I wrote to Amdek about the 
problem. The company sent back a return au- 
thorization for repair. When the set was re- 
turned to me, the problem still persisted. I wrote 
Amdek again. I soon received a reply from the 
folks at Amdek saying that they were sorry I 
was experiencing difficulty with the monitor 
and that they were shipping me a brand-new 
monitor in exchange for the defective one. Sev- 
eral days later UPS picked up my old monitor, 
and the next day the new one arrived. I really 
appreciate this kind of service. The next time I 
plan to buy a new peripheral, I know where I'm 
going to look first — the Amdek catalog.

Tightly Knit Support 

I have been using The General Manager from 
Sierra On-Line for about one year. Originally, I 
was running the earlier version and was having 
very good success with it. The new version is 
even quicker and easier to use. 

I am a manufacturers' representative for sev- 
eral yarn textile mills. I am not only able to keep 
up with the customers' shipments, but also with 
the commissions due and the yams used during 
the year, by customer and by yarn size. 

Recently I had the opportunity to test the 
sanity of the customer service reps at Sierra On- 
Line. I was unable to access my data and was 
in the position of having to go back to recover 
several days of entries that had not been backed 
up because of a glitch in the mechanical system 
of my Apple II Plus. On contacting Sierra On- 
Line, I discovered I had an unusual problem 
that had not happened before. The company 
very quickly directed me to Brillig Systems, the 
authors of the program. In a two-day period, 
Brillig not only diagnosed my problem but had 
saved my data and put it back in a usable condi- 
tion. That is a good testimonial for a company 
that is concerned with the customer and the 
general business of its customers. Thanks to a 
supplier who cares.

Sci-Fi It's Not 

I purchased a Micro-Sci A2 disk drive through 
Calt—A.P.P.L.E. twelve months ago to use with 
my II Plus. The drive plugged in and ran with- 
out problem using DOS, Apple Pascal, and the 
Microsoft CP/M card. It ran without problem 
until last week, that is. Twelve days ago it made 
a grinding noise and stopped. I opened the 
drive, looked in (a small screw was loose), 
closed the drive, and shipped it back to Micro- 
Sci. 



Today a drive arrived — new, not my re- 
paired drive! Total cost: no charge! Will I 
recommend Micro-Sci? Yep; fantastic com- 
pany, terrific response, and an excellent prod- 
uct. (No charge, can you believe it?) 
Mark M. Huth, New Orleans, LA 

White Like Us 

They call it the US Festival, Wozniak and his 
associates. To them the term "us" apparently 
means "white people," since not one of the 
twenty-five acts that performed at Devore, Cali- 
fornia, in May could, by any stretch of the 
imagination, be called black. (Not even the 
English Beat, sorry.) 

Yes, I know the organizers say they ap- 
proached and were turned down by Prince and 
Michael Jackson. But even if that is true, does 
that excuse really close the case on the matter? 
Do they really mean to imply that Prince and 
Michael Jackson are the only black artists in this 
country popular enough or worthy enough to 
play at their multimillion-dollar-losing concert 
venture?

Statistical Snapshots? 

Accelerate your trend forecasting in — 
electronic spreadsheets with a revolutionarily 
simple visual statistics system: 
I Graph 'n' Calc 



The Missing Link. Until now, VisiCalc, Desktop Plan, 
Multiplan, and other DIF-accessed electronic spread- 
sheets have lacked two crucial functions: forecasting 
statistics and user-fluid 'analytical' graphics. 

In other words, meaningful pictures that are derived 
from fact and time-proven analytical methods. 

Now, with Graph 'n' Calc, you can transform wild-guess 
"lohat W scenarios into statistically derived "what's 
probable" models. That's a breakthrough, whether you 
presently have a spreadsheet program or not. 

Never has statistical power been so fluid, easy to apply 
and intelligently focused. 

"A TRULY ELEGANT SYSTEM". Independent reviewers 
rave about Graph 'n' Calc, its balance of power and ease 
of use. 

By taking complex formulae and reducing them to a 
single keystroke, now even 'hunt and peck' business 
executives can perform: multiple linear regressions, 
exponential smoothing, time series and seasonality 
factoring, advanced mathematical functions, and even 
user-supplied BASIC subroutines, all conveniently 
tucked away in an easy access menu. 

Specifically designed to share data files with DIF- 
accessed spreadsheets such as VisiCalc and 1-2-3, Graph 
'n' Calc lets you extract rows and columns of numbers, 
statistically manipulate them, improve their accuracy, 
and pass them back to your other spreadsheets. 

Goal-Seeking Graphics. Unlike any other spreadsheet 
or graphics packages today— integrated or stand alone — 
Graph 'n' Calc lets you think in a visual domain! How? 

By streamlining the drawing routines, adding 'best 
guess' statistical defaults and a quick escape command 
structure. This means that graphs are easy to draw, redraw 
and draw again ... in seconds. 

Human beings naturally process pictures thousands 
of times faster than words and numbers. 



With Graph 'n' Calc, you now have the ability to visually 
process normally tough numerical values such as trends, 
seasonal fluctuations, and rates of growth. Independent 
research suggests this visual approach can increase 
decision analysis productivity 20 fold! 

''EERILi^ ACCURATE". That's what experienced VisiCalc 
and 1-2-3 users have said about Graph 'n' Calc. 

"Graph 'n' Calc doesn't replace your electronic spread- 
sheets, it just makes them more accurate and saves hours 
and hours of work building probability forecasts," says 
another software magazine. 

Come see for yourself, the "Polaroid" equivalent of 
the statistical graphics systems at your nearest computer 
store. 

Color and monochromatic video display versions are 
available for the IBM PC and Apple systems, respectively.

judice, US organizers have explained that soul 
and funk acts would not fit in with their pro- 
gram of new wave, heavy metal, and pop music. 
Hasn't rock 'n' roll's heaviest influence by far 
always been American rhythm and blues? 
Wouldn't David Lee Roth and Tom Petty, and 
all the others, readily attest to that? And what of 
the more recent influence of reggae on rock? 
Can anyone in his right mind describe much of

A Matter of Interpretation 

Softalk's interpretation of software sales statis- 
tics (May and June Bestsellers) seems to have 
overlooked the obvious. Computers are rarely 
purchased for the exclusive use of one individ- 
ual. Current popularity of the term "personal" 
computer is somewhat misleading. A com- 
puter, unlike a toothbrush, is better when 
shared. 

The simultaneous popularity of word proc- 
essors and typing instruction programs is easily 
explained. Perhaps mom and dad know how to 
type, but the kids are just learning. Even an ex- 
perienced typist might want to become accus- 
tomed to the feel of the keyboard without the 
added complication of learning how to use a 
word processor at the same time. 

This brings me to the comments that ap- 
peared on lagging game sales. We surely don't 
need more fuel for the copy-protection bonfire. 
The suggestion that software piracy accounts 
for a drop in sales of game programs is not 
helpful. It borders on irresponsibility — unless 
you have evidence that's a lot stronger than 
sales statistics. Many small computers are pur- 
chased by businesses. Whereas Typing Tutor 
might be purchased, Choplifter would not be. I 
write a lot of short programs myself. In case 
anyone hasn't noticed, microcomputers are fan- 
tastic programmable calculators. Game ven- 
dors would like to believe there is an un- 
quenchable desire for their programs that must 
be satisfied by any means, fair or foul. It would 
be more constructive to realize that some com- 
puter owners just don't want games. 
J.M. Rowe, Torrance, CA--- — 

One of So/talk's most interesting features is the 
comments portion of Bestsellers. However, 
you've really been off base with the remarks 
about the apparent contradiction between high 
sales figures for both word processors and typ- 
ing tutors. 

Contrary to what you have suggested, the 
individual most in need of a word processing 
program is the one who types poorly or not at 
all. Without the editing and variable-formatting 
abilities of a good program, trying to produce 
finished letters, documents, and reports is an ex- 
tremely frustrating chore for someone like my- 
self who, at best, uses four or five fingers on the 



keyboard. At the same time, many of us "fum- 
ble fingers" recognize the desirability of in- 
creasing our touch-typing skills, hence the high 
sales of the typing tutor programs. 

My conclusion is that the similar high sales 
figures for both word processing programs and 
typing instruction programs is normal and 
should be expected.

Thoroughly Dressed Down 

While ours is an equestrian publication, we are 
very much into the use of microcomputers. One 
of our editors is an Apple man, and he reads 
Softalk. Recently he brought to my attention 
your June issue because of the article on how 
the Chauncey farm uses micros. I was a little 
surprised to read on the contents page that "the 
Chauncey farm in Arizona breeds Thorough- 
bred Arabian horses. . . ." Sorry, but whoever 
wrote this made a big mistake. There ain't such 
an animal as "thoroughbred" Arabian. Only a 
purebred exists. Thoroughbreds are a breed of 
horse, originating in England, and they are the 
ones that run at most of the racetracks in the 
world, such as the Kentucky Derby. The Ara- 
bians that have pure Arabian blood are pure- 
bred Arabians.

Back and Forth and Back Again 

We at Transtar were very pleased to see the re- 
view of our Transtar 130 in the May issue of 
Softalk. We pride ourselves on producing de- 
pendable, quality peripherals. The review cer- 
tainly got that point across. I would like to clear 
up a couple of points made in the review that 
may not have been clear at the time you were 
examining the 130. 

First, the Transtar 130 is capable of bidirec- 
tional printing (notice that it prints bidirec- 
tionally on the self test) if the software being 
used supports that feature. Second, there is a bi- 
directional tractor available as an option for the 
Transtar 130 ($149 retail) that enhances forms 
handling and makes the printer that much more 
flexible. Finally, the retail price of $895 quoted 
in the review is correct for the parallel version of 
the 130. However, we now have a serial (stan- 
dard RS-232) version on the market that retails 
for $950. It has, in addition to the features 
found on the parallel unit, a built-in 2K buffer. 
John P. Schuitemaker, Transtar, Bellevue, WA 

The phrase "if the software being used sup- 
ports that feature" is telling. Many printers print 
bidirectionally whether or not the software tells 
them to. The Transtar, being Diablo-compatible, 
does bidirectional printing, but not automat- 
ically. Half the point is conceded. 

Thanks for the short review of the Transtar 130 
printer in the May Marketalk Reviews. I have 
had this printer for two months and use it with 
the He and WordStar. It is a solid, excellent 
printer — a real value for the dollar.

AUGUST 1983 



preliminary version of the printer manual (1 /83) 
that came with the machine makes no mention 
of graphics. 

Jerry Nachison, Washington, DC 

You can print graphics on the Transtar 130 
printer using Zoom Grafix or Printographer 
configured for a Diablo printer. 

Homely Substitution 

1 have been using GraForth since last Septem- 
ber and have found the "Animated Apple" arti- 
cles very helpful. The GraForth manual is ex- 
cellent, but the Softalk articles have thrown 
much-needed light on the subject. 

I was totally bewildered by the 3-D image 
data sets until the January article. I am writing 
because of a bug I have found that concerns the 
image data sets — at least I think it is a bug. I am 
writing a program that moves two balls through 
a maze using moves entered from the key- 
board. A text window asks for distances in the 
X and Y directions, and the ball moves along 
the resultant path, one pixel per loop. 

The draw command, according to the man- 
ual and the article, begins by erasing the image 
on the invisible graphic screen, using data from 
the undraw image data set, and then draws a 
new image, using data from the draw image 
data set. Then the screen is flipped to display the 
new image. In my program, on the first draw 
command in the loop, the old image was not 
being undrawn. This left a residual image on

I 



one screen at the starting point that winked on 
and off, blowing a visual "raspberry" at a poor, 
bewildered, frustrated, would-be programmer. 

I was able to solve the problem by issuing an 
"X object off draw" command. This had to be 
done twice to correct the situation. It solved the 
problem but did not explain why the problem 
existed. After reading the January article, I 
began to examine the data sets with peeks and 
eventually discovered that the home command 
was causing the trouble. The home command 
puts a zero in the flag byte of the interim and 
undraw data sets. 

When a draw command is given, the old 
image on the screen that is not displayed is 
erased before the new image is drawn if, and 
only if, there is a positive number in the flag 
byte of the undraw data set. There also has to 
be a positive number in the flag byte of the in- 
terim data set. 

The best way to deal with this problem is to 
avoid using home when using 3-D graphics. If 
the text window is small, a few carriage returns 
can scroll it clear. If home must be used, then 
the object to be drawn following it must be ref- 
erenced twice with a draw command to restore 
the flag bytes to normal. I hope this will help 
someone to avoid the frustration I had with this 
problem. 

William D. Carswell, Ramona, CA 
The manufacturer responds: 

Mr. Carswell is absolutely right. The home 
command does zero the flag bytes in the two 
data sets, preventing the previous 3-D object 
from being undrawn. However, this was put 
into GraForth on purpose to prevent the oppo- 
site problem when no text window is set. 

Consider a 3-D-graphics program where 
there is no text window. Executing home would 
erase the entire screen, including any 3-D ob- 
jects. If home didn't zero the flag bytes, then the 
next draw command would try to erase where 
the 3-D objects used to be, possibly destroying 
new graphics and blowing yet another "rasp- 
berry." 

Zeroing the flag bytes is good, unless a text 
window is set and the 3-D objects are outside of 
it. In this case, there's a sneaky solution: You 
can clear the text window by substituting a call 
27972 for home. The call hops into the middle 
of the clear-and-home code in GraForth, by- 
passing the routine that zeros the flag bytes. 

Thanks for pointing out the problem.

Until the SOS Is Served 

I have been an Apple owner since 1977 (my 
Apple II had serial number 6795), and I re- 
cently traded my Apple II for an Apple III. The 
Apple III is an extremely versatile machine, in 
that everything is software-based and, as a 
result, modifiable. Unfortunately Apple has 
been slow in releasing information on its SOS 
operating system, which has resulted in very 
little software being published for the Apple III. 
Hopefully, this will be rectified in the near 
future with the publication of the long-awaited 
SOS Operating Manual. In the meantime I have 



some information that other Apple III owners 
might find of interest. 

I highly recommend a new publication de- 
voted exclusively to the III called On Three 
(Box 3825, Ventura, CA 93006). The magazine 
has technical tips and tutorials on Business Ba- 
sic and Pascal. 

A lot of Apple III owners have had trouble 
with color monitors in the emulation mode 
(color is not supported and everything comes 
out in black and white). The solution is to have 
the cables to the color video port set up to ac- 
cept composite NTSC color video (via pin 12) 
rather than the RGB signal. The NTSC video is 
compatible with all standard color monitors 
(non-RGB) and also works well with a video re- 
corder, allowing direct video recording in color 
of anything that comes over the Apple III 
screen in both emulation and Apple III native 
modes. 

With the above video connection, most 
Apple II games can be viewed in color in the 
emulation mode. There is still the problem of the 
III accepting game-paddle inputs, as the Apple 
III paddles are physically wired differently than 
the Apple II. This can be corrected by a soft- 
ware correction available from TG Products in 
Texas, the same folks that make those great 
game joysticks. This program, called Modifier 
for the Apple III, actually makes a change to the 
emulation disk so that the emulation mode will 
read the joysticks in the same manner as the 
Apple II. Any games that use the standard 
Apple II game-paddle reads will run correctly in 
emulation mode. Beware, however, of software 
companies that use nonstandard joystick reads. 

I have found that the Megabyter disk con- 
troller card from Sorrento Valley Associates 
works very well with Shugart 800/850 eight- 
inch disk drives. This arrangement provides 2.4 
megabytes of on-line line storage that can be 
used in either Apple II emulation mode or 
Apple III native mode. Another big plus is that 
the eight-inch drives are formatted in standard 
IBM format, which allows data to be trans- 
ferred between the Apple III and an IBM main- 
frame (in my case, the IBM System 34). I prefer 
this arrangement to the Apple ProFile because 
it's cheaper, easier to back up, and provides 
data transportability. 

Now someone out there may be able to help 
me. I use the Apple Graphics Tablet exten- 
sively in my work and it works very well in 
emulation mode. Does anyone know how to 
take advantage of the Apple Ill's enhanced 
graphics in native mode with the Tablet? This 
should be accomplished via a driver and some 
modifications to the Tablet software. 

One last quick comment concerning Taylor 
Pohlman's Third Basic column in Softalk. I 
have enjoyed the series so far and I am learning 
a great deal by following the examples pre- 
sented. However, the February article on the 
Drawimage editor left me in the dark. I spent a 
couple of hours typing the code — only to find it 
had several errors and no documentation as to 
how to run the program. The series has con- 
tinued using the Drawimage editor as a basis for 
additional programs, but I am still stuck with

The Printing of SoftGraph 

The only thing that bothered me about David 
Durkee's SoftGraph disk was the lack of a print- 
er routine. In the parting paragraphs in his arti- 
cle, Durkee said he was not including a printer 
routine because of the numerous differences be- 
tween printers. I have written to say that there is 
a definite need to tell novices such as myself 
how to do it. 

My Apple has a Silentype printer hooked to 
it, and the book for the printer generally says 
what author Durkee said — no problem. Well, I 
tried my darnedest to get the pie chart to print 
out, but never could. The problem is that the 
program was designed to display the graph; 
then, when you touch any key, it goes to a menu 
that allows you to see the chart again, or go to 
the main menu, or reset parameters. Well, I 
didn't want any of that. I wanted to interrupt 
the program with a control-C (like the Silentype 
manual said to do), initialize the printer, and 
give a control-Q to produce a printed copy. 

Please print some wise words for the igno- 
rant but enthusiastic folks like me, showing us 
how to embed a printer routine in programs so 
we can have control of our machinery. Thanks. 
Michael P. Jaquish, Tullahoma, TN 

David Durkee responds: 

Despite what the Silentype manual may say, 
you don't need to use control-C to get out of the 
program to print graphics. As Michael Jaquish 
points out, this method won't keep the picture 
displayed on the screen in SoftGraph anyway. 
The easier way of doing things is to quit the pro- 
gram from the main menu. The last chart you 
created will still be in memory, even though it 
isn't being displayed. 

At this point you could enter the PR#1 from 
the keyboard to activate the Silentype. You 
would still have to type in pokes to set the 
screen to page two, the hi-res page used by Soft- 
Graph (poke —12525.64); print unidirectionally 
(poke -12529,128), which results in a much bet- 
ter picture quality on the Silentype; and print in 
inverse (poke —12524,0), which turns the white 
lines of the screen to black lines on paper. Then 
you can type control-Q. It's not very efficient to 
type in these pokes every time you want to print 
a picture, but they don't seem to work correctly 



from within a program. (Anybody know why?) 

Another solution is to put all the necessary 
commands into a text file so they can be executed 
by the computer as if they were typed at the 
keyboard. Here's a short program to create that 
text file: 

10 D$=CHR$(4) 

20 PRINT D$;"OPEN DUMP" 

30 PRINT D$;"WRITE DUMP" 

40 PRINT "PR#1" 

50 PRINT "POKE -12525,64" 

60 PRINT "POKE -12529,128" 

70 PRINT "POKE -12524,0" 

80 PRINT "MONICO" 

90 PRINT CHR$(17) 

100 PRINT "NOMONIGO" 

110 PRINT "PR#0" 

120 PRINT D$; "CLOSE DUMP" 

Running this program creates the text file 
Dump. With this file on your SoftGraph disk, 
you can quit the program at any time, then type 
exec Dump to send the last picture displayed to 
the printer. Remember, this solution works only 
with the Silentype. 

The solution, if you own another graphics 
printer, is to buy either hardware or software 
that will do the job. The hardware option is an 
interface card that has the necessary firmware 
for printing graphics, such as the Pkaso from 
Interactive Structures or the Grappler from 
Orange Micro. If you have one of these cards, its 
manual should explain how to print graphics. 
Just follow the instructions for printing out hi- 
res page two. 

Those who don't already have such a card 
will find the software option a less expensive so- 
lution to the problem. There are a few good 
programs on the market for printing graphics. 
Most of them work on many different printers; 
also, there are different versions available for a 
selecdon of printers. Three such programs are 
Image Printer from Sensible Software, Zoom 
Grajix from Phoenix Software, and Printogra- 
pher from Southwestern Data Systems. This is a 
less expensive alternative to purchasing a spe- 
cial interface card, and these programs are gen- 
erally easier to use. 

Another piece of software that will do the 
trick is Fontrix from Data Transforms. Though 
a little more expensive than the other programs 
mentioned, it has the capability of adding dif 
ferent types of text to a picture (in upper and 
lower case — much better than SoftGraph's al- 
phanumeric shape table). It also allows you to 
print a picture as part of a larger hi-res con- 
struction, including text and graphics from 
other sources. Check out the more detailed 
description in Softalk's July '83 Marketalk Re- 
views. 

David Durkee, Burbank, CA 

On the demonstration disk included with the 
new Apple dot-matrix printer is a program, 
DMP Exerciser, which is similar to Graphtrix, a 
program many of us have used with our II 
Pluses and Epson printers. However, DMP 
Exerciser will dump only one hi-res picture to 
the Apple printer: the hi-res picture included on 
the disk. By deleting one line and adding three 
lines you can make DMP Exerciser a versatile 



hi-res dump program. Load DMP Exerciser 
PT2, delete line 45630, and type in the follow- 
ing three lines: 

45625 INPUT "NAME OF FILE? 

(C)ATALOG ";FI$ 
45630 IF FI$ = "C" THEN PRINT 

CHR$(13)+CHR$(4);"CATALOG,D2" 

:GOTO 45625 
45635 PRINT D$;"BLOAD":FI$; 

",A$2000,D2" 

Now save the program. Deleted line 45630 in 
the original loads the Apple printer log. (Don't 
delete the file because one of the other programs 
uses it to display the logo on-screen.) Line 45625 
gets the name of the picture (file) you want to 
dump to the printer, and line 45635 loads it on- 
to hi-res page one. Line 45630 allows you to cat- 
alog the disk first to check the name of the file. If 
you have only one drive, delete the .D2 from lines 
45630 and 45635. Now, when you run the DMP 
Exerciser program, you will choose number 5- 
Print Text or Graphics on menu I, choose num- 
ber 6- Print Hi-Res Graphics Image on menu 
2, and choose the appropriate size and mode 
(inverse/normal) on menu 3. Then, when 
prompted, enter the picture file name (switch 
disks now on a one-drive system) and watch the 
picture being "drawn" on the printer. DMP Ex- 
erciser allows you to do a number of things with 
the Apple dot-matrix printer. With these 
changes, it will also allow you to dump hi-res 
images of your choice to the printer.

WHTAI 1^ 



AUGUST 1983 



Straightforward Clues 

An item recently appeared in Open Discpssion 
suggesting a rather tortuous way to insert the 
escape character in Apple Writer II text files. 
Most printers recognize this character (hex 1 B) 
and examine the successive characters to select 
a new mode of operation. 

Unfortunately, nowhere does the manual 
describe how to enter the escape character. In 
the April Open Discussion, another reader sug- 
gested editing a provided glossary file that al- 
ready contains escape characters (displayed on 
the screen as a flashing [ ). It turns out that there 
is a much more straightforward method. 

The clue is on page 52 of the manual, in the 
discussion of footnote entry procedures. It im- 
plies that the escape character can be entered 
somehow by using the control-V function, 
which allows entry of control characters. When 
control-V is pressed, any control characters 
typed will be entered into the text instead of ex- 
ecuting their assigned functions. This mode is 
deactivated by pressing control-V again. 

One might think that pressing control-V fol- 
lowed by escape would therefore do the trick. 
It's not quite that simple because, even in con- 
trol-V mode, pressing the escape key changes 
the cursor to a flashing a to allow upper-case 
entry. Happily, it turns out that pressing escape 
a second time does, in fact, produce the flash- 
ing [ that signifies the escape character. The se- 
quence control-V escape escape control-V is the 
answer. (The second control-V terminates the 
control character entry mode.) 



Ihinklan 



Now I'll follow this answer with another 
question: Does anyone know how to enter a 
control-V into the text? I don't really have a use 
for it; it seems so untidy to be able to enter all 
other control characters and not this one. 
Gordon B. Alley, San Antonio, TX 

I'm writing this letter using Apple Writer II on 
my Apple lie (without an eighty-column 
board). However, I am using the shift key for 
upper and lower case instead of the escape key. 
I have done this by replying yes when asked if I 
have upper and lower case, turning on all caps 
via control-K, and releasing the caps-lock key. 
From that point on, I can use the shift key for 
upper case and get lower case otherwise. Was 
this planned or is it just a lucky break? 

I still have one problem. How do I get un- 
derlined words on my Epson MX-80 printer 
using Apple Writer II?

Prowriter Pros and Cons 

I pass along the following for the benefit of 
others who may have purchased a C. Itoh Pro- 
writer 851 OA dot-matrix printer for use with an 
Apple II Plus. This printer is compatible with 
the Apple dot-matrix printer, and I had sup- 
posed that its marriage with the Apple would go 
smoothly. Unfortunately for me, the dealer was 
discontinuing the line and showed no interest in 
helping me once the printer had crossed his 
counter. The Itoh manual is poorly organized 
and difficult to follow without considerable

study and assistance. By dint of much effort, I 
finally was able to get the necessary informa- 
tion, which I gladly pass along. 

For an RS-232C serial interface, the dip-, 
switch settings on the Itoh are as follows: 



Switch one: 2,6,7,8— closed 
Switch two: 6,7— closed 
Switch twenty-one: 4 — closed 
Switch twenty-two: 2,3 —closed 
Switch twenty-three: 1,5— closed 
Switch twenty-four: 1,3,5,8— closed 
All other switches should be open 



You would never guess these settings from read- 
ing the Itoh manual. I obtained them from the 
technical services hot line, operated by Leading 
Edge, C. Itoh's distributor in the United States 
(800-343-6833). 

I had an additional problem getting the 
printer's escape commands to operate from in- 
side my word processing program, A pple Writer 
II. Doing this involves the command control-V, 
but the exact sequence is a bit tricky. Underlin- 
ing, for instance, is done (according to the man- 
ual) by using escape-X. The actual sequence of 
commands is control-V escape escape control-V 
capital X. (The shift-capital modification does 
not affect this sequence.) 

The second escape will bring up on-screen a 
flashing left square bracket, which indicates that 
the following character is controlled by the es- 
cape command, a fact not mentioned in the Itoh 
manual. 

To go back to nonunderlining, use escape-Y 
in the same way. It is possible to replace these 
commands with single-stroke glossary com- 
mands in Apple Writer II. Apple Writer's own 
underline command (backslash) will not work. 
You will simply get alternate letters and under- 
lined spaces. 

The same escape sequence is used to call up 
the different character pitches, line spacing, and 
so forth; it is, not surprisingly, the same proce- 
dure used in the Apple dot-matrix printer. 

I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank the people at The Computer Tree in End- 
well, New York, for giving generously of their 
time to help me with this problem, and espe- 
cially for showing me the above escape se- 
quence, even though they did not sell the Itoh to 
me and do not even carry it.

Two-step Polka Dot Dot Dot 

I am writing concerning the two letters from 
Charles Miller (April and June Open Discus- 
sion) in which he describes his methods of ac- 
cessing the printer escape commands for the Ep- 
son MX-80 from Apple Writer 11 I tried all the 
various procedures but nothing happened, just 
the plain old dot dot dot matrix. In my last des- 
perate attempt, I rebooted the Apple Writer II 
without the Videx eighty-column preboot and 
used forty columns. Bingo! There was my letter 
in emphasized type. Double strike worked like a 
charm too. Thanks, Chuck!

Crossing the Micro Line 

I am attempting to interface Apple Writer II 
with an Okidata Microline 92 printer and am 
experiencing considerable trouble. 1 have also 
tried to interface Muse's Super-Text 40/80 with 
similar problems. 

The main difficulty seems to be that I can't 
find a way of embedding ASCII character 
strings or control commands in the text. The 
printer won't respond. I am using an Apple II 
Plus with a Videx 16K expansion board. I find 
that I must initialize with control-V control-I 
SON control-V to get a printout past forty 
columns. 

If the initialization command suffix is a 
capital N, I get 17 cpi print, whereas if it's a 
lower-case n, I get the 10 cpi text. If I attempt to 
bury the control-I SON in the text, I then can't 
return to 10 cpi with a control-V control-I SOn 
control-V. Neither of these commands seem to 
relate to the Okidata Microline 92 instruc- 
tion book. 

In the Apple Writer II program the com- 
mand for continuous underscore is the back- 
slash, one to start and another to stop. If I at- 
tempt to use this command _t_h_i_s _i_s 
_w_h_a_t _I _g_e_t. I also do not seem to 
be able to make the super or subscript func- 
tions work. 

My frustration is compounded by the fact 
that a couple of my clients have Miaoline print- 
ers and it would be nice to be able to use theirs 
while visiting them, making my Apple some-

Show Me the Entry Way 

I understand how to embed control characters 
within an Apple Writer text file. My problem is 
not knowing what keyboard entries will create 
the printer commands needed for my Okidata. 
For example, to print wider characters, I need 
to specify CHR$(31). How can I do this? What 
keyboard entry will create the value of 
CHR$(31)? Is this even possible? 
Connie Kouba, Eden Prairie, MN 

Print Data Okay 

I have replaced my Okidata printer ribbon with 
both an Underwood standard typewriter rib- 
bon and a KO Rec type #1 typewriter ribbon. 
The latter was bought at Woolworth's for two 
dollars. I'd be interested in hearing about the 
experiences (or any programming tips) of other 
users who've used the Apple II Plus with the 
Okidata printer #82A.

Panasonic Printer Panic 

This is an open plea for help. I own an Apple II 
Plus without an eighty-column card and a 
Panasonic KX-P1090 printer without an intel- 
ligible manual. The first word processor I man- 
aged to get my hands on was A pple Writer II, 
and I use it constantly. However, I have been 
unable to use the Apple Writer II subscript and 
superscript routines with my printer. Does any- 
one else know how to do this? By the way, 
my thanks go to Charles Miller and Tim An- 
derson for their suggestions in the June Open 
Discussion, as I have been able to make some 
simple text alterations using their methods. 

I must add that the contrast between the 
Apple Writer II manual's clear and concise writ- 
ing and the hopeless mess offered by Panasonic 
tends to make one sit and curse the printer for 
hours. 

Another question: Does anyone out there 
know how to dump graphics with the Pana- 
sonic printer?

Commanding Solutions 

This letter is in response to Mark Wolfson's 
letter in the June Open Discussion. He was hav- 
ing trouble converting his binary Apple PIE files 
to text files compatible with Apple Writer II (or 
He). The solution is simple. 

Using Apple PIE from the COMMAND? 
level, load your binary file into memory just as 
if you were going to reedit the file. Then, sim- 
ply use Apple PIE'S capability to write a stan- 
dard Apple text file. The command is a right ar- 
row issued again from the COMMAND? 
prompt, followed immediately by a new file 
name. For example, if you loaded a binary PIE 
file named File, you would save it as a text file 
(use a different name) by simply typing > 
FILE.TEXT. If, from the COMMAND? 
prompt, you issue a MON I,C,0, you can use 
the right arrow and you'll see your file appear 



on-screen as it is being written to disk. You can 
then use the text version in Apple Writer II (and, 
I think, He) by just changing the commands 
embedded in the file (the two programs' com- . 
mands are not compatible). 
Owen H. Richelieu III, San Marino, CA 

Add PIE Writer to the list of word processing 
programs that don't need separate terminal pro- 
grams for transmitting their files ("Apple on the 
Phone," June 1983 Softalk). PIE Writer can be 
used to control a modem of any type. Instruc- 
tions and examples are included in its manual 
for the transmitting and receiving of files. It is 
not necessary to have PIE Writer at the other 
end of the telecommunications line. 

Coordinators of PeaceNet, San Francisco's 
disarmament electronic bulletin board, say they 
use PIE Writers telecommunications capabil- 
ities almost as much as they use its word proc- 
essing funcfions. They ship already written 
messages directly out of PIE Writer onto their 
various bulletin boards around the Bay Area. 

On another subject, in answer to Adam 
Taub's plea for Centronics 739 articles and pro- 
grams, the 739 is one of the many printers for 
which PIE Writer will automatically configure 
itself.

Clearing-house of PIE 

If you are an Apple PIE or PIE Writer word 
processor user with an Apple II or He, then you 
will be interested in a new user group now form- 
ing called Apple PIE Writers. As the name in- 
dicates, we plan to support all Apple versions of 
PIE. This support will include tips, tricks, modi- 
fications, help, and just about anything to en- 
hance your use of the already outstanding PIE 
word processor. 

If you have made some modifications to 
PIE, let us know; maybe others would be inter- 
ested. If you have questions, ask the group; 
somebody will have the answer. This is your 
user group; we are just the clearing-house. 

Depending on the response we receive, a 
newsletter will be published whenever we have 
sufficient material to warrant one. Right now 
membership is free, so if you are a PIE user, 
send us your name. Source or CompuServe ID 
(if applicable), and your mailing address. Tell us 
which version of PIE you use — Apple PIE or 
PIE Writer, forty or eighty column (specify 
your board) — and whether you are using an 
Apple II or He. 

Send the information to Apple PIE Writers,

See How Pascal Runs on a lie 

As a Pascal user who entered the Apple fold via 
a He, I was surprised to find that I am doing 
the impossible according to Douglas Peterson 
(June Open Discussion). First, there is no prob- 
lem using Pascal 1.1 with the Apple He with a 
two-drive system; just use the procedures out-

lined for a two-disk startup discussed in the 
Apple-supplied manuals. However, one -drive 
operation is not possible using the published 
procedure, for the reason mentioned by Peter- 
son: the new He reset feature. 

However, the following procedure will allow 
a user to use Pascal 1.1 on the Apple He with a 
single disk drive: 

1. Boot up with APPLE3: 

2. X APPLE3:FORMATTER in order to 
create a blank disk. 

3. Boot up with APPLEl: 

4. Create a new APPLEO: disk onto your 
blank disk using the filer transfer command. 

5. Again using the filer transfer command, 
transfer APPLE3:SYSTEM. APPLE to 
APPLEO:SYSTEM.APPLE. You now have 
two APPLEO: disks, one with SYS- 
TEM.APPLE and one without. 

The bootup procedure is first to boot up 
with your APPLEO: disk containing SYS- 
TEM.APPLE and then remove it. Replace it 
with the original APPLEO: (without SYS- 
TEM.APPLE), then use the initialize com- 
mand. This performs the necessary warm boot 
otherwise prevented by the new reset feature. 
You can now run the Apple Pascal 1.1 system 
using one disk drive. For those who are inter- 
ested, this procedure came to me from Apple 
Canada after a number of angry phone calls 
and at least some sweating by an Apple senior 
programmer. Before I called, they claimed 
never to have been aware of the problem.

Montezuma Would Be Proud 

David Rabson inquired in Open Discussion 
about C compilers for the Apple H Plus work- 
ing under Apple DOS. There is, in fact, a fine, 
newly updated Apple H C compiler available 
from Manx Software Systems of Shrewsberry, 
New Jersey. It's just one of the many C com- 
pilers that the company offers as part of its 
highly regarded Aztec C series. The Aztec com- 
pilers are full C compilers, with double-preci- 
sion, floating point, a transcendental function li- 
brary, and other powerful system features. They 
are, in my opinion, a bargain. The people at 
Manx are also uncommonly helpful, as a tele- 
phone call to them will quickly show.

No Trouble at All 

In answer to Larry Freeland's question in the 
June Open Discussion of dBase II on the Ap- 
ple III, I have successfully installed dBase 
II using the SoftCard HI with very little trouble. 
The steps are as follows: 

1 . Boot from the CP/M System Master in 
drive A:. 

2. Create a CP/M system disk on drive B: 
with the command COPY B:/F/S (this formats 
and copies the system boot tracks). 

3. PIP on to the new disk the files 
Driver.SOS and PIP.COM: 

PIP B:=A:DRIVER.SOS [OV] 
PIP B: = PIP.COM [OV] 



4. Take the new disk and put it in drive A:, 
then press control-C to warm-boot. 

5. Put the dBase disk supplied by Ashton- 
Tate in the B: drive. 

6. Transfer the files with the command PIP 
A:=B:*.* f OVJ {this transfers all the files to Ap- 
ple III CP/M files). 

7. Repeat the same steps for the ZIP disk. 
You may have to delete the Driver.SOS file 
temporarily to make enough room. 

8. Boot the dBase disk that was just created 
and run Install. A listing of the entries I used to 
adjust the installation procedure is available 
by contacting me through Open Discussion.

Taking the CUE 

As a teacher, I am very sensitive to Judith 
Juskowich's plea (June Open Discussion) for a 
resource for public domain educational soft- 
ware. Computer Using Educators (CUE), a 
group centered in (but not confined to) the San 
Jose, California, area, runs an educational "soft- 
swap" that compiles and disseminates educa- 
tional software. I have used many softswap pro- 
grams with my class of learning-disabled stu- 
dents, but most programs are appropriate for 
gifted students. Softswap programs are avail- 
able through mail order for a nominal fee. 

For a catalog and an order form, send $1 to 
Ann Lathrop, Softswap Chairperson, Micro- 
computer Center, SMERC Library, San Mateo 
County Office of Education, 333 Main Street, 



Redwood City, CA 94063. Incidentally, CUE 
membership is very inexpensive, and the group 
publishes a bimonthly newsletter for educators.

Textbook Basics 

I teach several computer-oriented classes, in- 
cluding a course in Basic and an introduction to 
data processing, as a part-time instructor at 
California State University, Fullerton. I have 
personally found the Self-Teaching Guides 
(STG) from John Wiley and Sons to be excel- 
lent. Their Basic for Home Computers is written 
for Microsoft Basic, which is very similar to 
Applesoft Basic. The series also includes offer- 
ings that cover such topics as 6502 assembly 
language and the handling of data files on the 
Apple (the latter comes with a disk). 

I have also found Introduction to Computers 
and Data Processing, by Shelly and Cashman, 
to be valuable. It's published by Anaheim Pub- 
lishing of Fullerton, California. A picture book 
with excellent graphics and easy-to-under- 
stand text, it's ideal for a beginning course. Stu- 
dents will certainly find it useful.

bookkeeping four years ago. Travel agencies re- 
quire a highly specialized type of accounting, 
part of which involves a weekly sales summary 
report required by the Air Traffic Conference, 
the airlines' central bank. I had trouble just 
finding a CPA who could understand it all, not 
to mention finding the right combination of 
hardware and software to do what seemed to be 
a simple job. I wound up buying an Apple and 
writing my own program. I eventually found 
myself acting as a consultant to other travel 
agencies with the same dilemma. 

Vendors of airline mainframe reservations 
systems have virtually flooded the market with 
minicomputer-based accounting systems. These 
are at prices well out of the reach of small- and 
medium-sized agencies. The other alternatives 
are purchasing an in-house microcomputer and 
software or subscribing to a timesharing service. 

There is a jungle of microcomputer soft- 
ware available for travel-agency accounting and 
reporting. Available packages range in price 
from $4,000 to $25,000 for a complete system 
and run on everything from Apples and Altos 
to Wangs. Some perform only the weekly sales 
reporting; others are complete accounting sys- 
tems with versatile payroll and accounts-receiv- 
able functions, hotel and car commission track- 
ing, and client record keeping. Some even offer 
the ability to interface with existing airline res- 
ervations terminals, capturing accounting infor- 
mation as each ticket is printed. 

Most of these programs were written by 
agency owners for use in their own businesses.

then marketed to other agencies. A few have en- 
joyed tremendous success because they are flex- 
ible and allow for growth. Others have been 
successful because they are designed after non- 
conventional but popular manual agency ac- 
counting systems such as the ASTA (American 
Society of Travel Agents) manual accounting 
system. These require minimal changes in an 
agency's operations during the transition to 
automation. 

There are currently four or five good pack- 
ages available for the Apple, with software 
prices ranging from $800 to $10,000. The best 
advice anyone can give you is to hire yourself a 
good consultant. Make sure he has a balanced 
background in travel-agency management, 
computers, and accounting. He will help you 
determine what you need, how much you need 
it, and how much you should be spending for it. 
Automation can be the best thing that ever hap- 
pened to your agency — boosting your produc- 
tivity and that of your sales agents. It can also 
be an expensive nightmare, so beware.

Mideastern Appiers 

In response to Joseph Ben-Israel (June Open 
Discussion), I have been a dedicated Apple II 
user for several years now. Last year, I moved 
to Israel and naturally wanted to bring my 
Apple system with me. After some checking 
around beforehand, I was able to determine 
that an Apple II system can be used on Euro- 
pean or Israeli electrical systems (220 volts, 50 
Hz) using just a simple transformer. All my 
equipment was purchased in America and is de- 
signed for 110 volts. I now run my enfire setup 
through a single heavy-duty (5(X) amp) trans- 
former, which simply changes the source cur- 
rent of 220 volts down to 110. This runs my Ap- 
ple II Plus with two disk drives, a Texas Instru- 
ments color monitor, and an Epson MX-80 F /T 
printer. The Apple and its component drives are 
not a problem, since it all runs off a direct cur- 
rent line from the power supply anyway. Thus 
the Apple and the drives are not cycle-depend- 
ent. The Epson seems to have no problem with 
the cycles. The most problematic area is the vid- 
eo display. The Apple generates a standard tele- 
vision-type signal (NTSC) using an RF modu- 
lator or can be hooked to a standard monitor 
with a straight cable. Hooking into an Israeli or 
European television requires another signal 
known as PAL and requires a PAL card in the 
Apple. I used a monitor and forgot about the 
hook-ups to any television overseas. I did check 
to see that my monitor is rated as being 50 or 60 
Hz-compatible. 

Buying American equipment and bringing it 
with you creates another problem: customs. In 
some countries this can be quite a hassle. The 
regulations in Israel, for example, can make im- 
portation of such equipment for personal use 
prohibitive. If you wish, you can eliminate the 
hassles of customs taxes and regulations, elimi- 
nate the problems of electrical transformers, 
and gain some important advantages by buy- 
ing the equipment in the country where you will 
be residing. Apple Computer has dealers all 



over the world, including Israel. The cost of 
buying in Israel is higher because of import 
taxes and low levels of competition among the 
dealers. The advantage of buying from a local 
dealer is that you can purchase equipment that 
has already been modified for the foreign lan- 
guage set of Hebrew. With the flip of a switch, 
you can access the Hebrew alphabet. Now there 
is a version of the popular Apple Writer pro- 
gram that allows word processing in English or 
Hebrew. 

The software is not generally dependent on 
the voltage or cycles in any way. Thus, the use 
of Apple or other vendor software is not a prob- 
lem overseas as long as the software is rated to 
the system it is being run on (CP/M require- 
ments, minimum memory requirements, and so 
forth). 

Tamir Weiner, Harei Yehuda, Israel 
A Wiry Solution 

To Paul B. Brumbaugh: You don't have to 
rewire your whole house to get a three-wire 
grounded outlet for your computer. Two-wire 
supply has one line grounded. It is the same 
ground line as for a three-wire supply. 

Check your circuit-breaker panel. There 
should be a white insulated wire connected to a 
water pipe. At each socket, if the wiring was 
done correctly, the white insulated wire is 
ground. Sockets have a wide slot and a narrow 
slot for the prongs of the plug. The wide slot 
should be the grounded side. It is the same 
ground as the third, round hole of a three-wire 
socket. Use an ac voltmeter to prove this for 
yourself. Sockets have chrome-plated screws for 
the white wire and brass screws for the black 
wire. On a three-wire socket the third or ground 
terminal is usually colored green. 

To provide a ground wire for the third ter- 
minal, find the nearest water pipe to your com- 
puter socket location. Scrape the pipe for good 
electrical connection and clamp the bare end of 
a length of white insulated number 14 wire to 
the pipe. First remove the fuse or circuit breaker 
for the circuit to your computer. Then remove 
the currently used socket from the wall and dis- 
connect the wires. Pull the wire from the water 
pipe through the wall or up through the floor to 
the opening for your socket. Bend the three 
wires so that they cannot touch each other or 
anything else. Replace the fuse or circuit 
breaker. 

Using the voltmeter again, check to be cer- 
tain that when it's connected to the two white 
wires there is no voltage reading. Check also to 
be certain that there's 1 17 volts between each of 
the white wires and the black wire. Remove the 
fuse or circuit breaker before proceeding. Now 
connect your three wires to your new socket using 
the color coding described above. The white 
wire from the water pipe goes on the green ter- 
minal of your new socket. Install the socket in 
the wall box and replace the fuse or circuit 
breaker. 

Check again with the voltmeter. The round 
hole and the wide slot should give no voltage 
reading. The narrow slot should show 117 volts 
(plus or minus 1 or 2 volts) to either the wide

slot or the round hole of the socket. Just for 
further certainty, try an electric drill or other 
small appliance having a three-wire plug. Next, 
get a three-wire-socket expander so you can 
plug your printer and monitor into the same 
grounded socket. If the monitor has only two 
wires, check to see if one prong is wide. If it is, 
there is no further question. If not, you might 
want to investigate how it is connected inter- 
nally. Ask your dealer about that. 

Since Open Discussion seems to be a clear- 
ing-house for some very important issues, this 
may be the place to raise one of importance to 
computer users in particular. The answer just 
given would not have been needed if local build- 
ing and electrical codes had been observed by 
everyone in years past. Manufacturers of low- 
priced electrical consumer goods have caused 
the confusion over or lack of understanding of 
electrical polarity. They like to say that al- 
ternating current has no polarity. Theoretically 
it doesn't, but considering the hazards to peo- 
ple and computers, the grounding requirement 
must be understood by everyone. It is so basic 
to ac and so critical that it must be accepted as 
being as important as the polarity of direct cur- 
rent. 

Edward Parker, Baltimore, MD 
Purrrrrr 

I am writing in response to Robert Buschel's let- 
ter entitled "Meeow!" (May Open Discussion). 
He had rerouted the reset key to run the hello 
program each time it was pushed. To undo this 
feature, you must repoke the original values 
back into the reset vector. 

An easy way to do this is to first peek these 
locations to find their true values before you 
change them. Then later on you can poke the 
original values back into where they belong. 
For example: 

10 PI = PEEK (1010):P2 = PEEK (1011)

The Case of the Unwritten File 

Regarding Al Goodwin's problem with a file 
apparently not being written to a disk (June 
Open Discussion), I have had similar prob- 
lems. In one case I was writing a fifty-byte entry 
to a file that was defined as ",L50". The return 
at the end of the write was the fifty-first charac- 
ter to be written, and that became the first char- 
acter of the next file. Therefore, an attempt to 
read the next file gave only a return. 

The other time I had the problem I was try- 
ing to write to the middle of a record. Even 
though my command was print "name"; (please 



note the semicolon), I found that I either could 
not close the file or that typing a print 
CHR$(l3)+CHR$(4)"close' put a return at the 
end of what I was writing, and that gave an ex- 
tra return when I tried to read. 

I have found that I can solve disk read/write 
problems quickly with the use of a utility that 
lets me read a sector of the file. I like one called 
Disk Fixer, by Image Computer Products. 
Raymond J. Schuerger, Pittsburgh, PA 

I had a problem like Al Goodwin's, and, after 
going through many books, the only one that 
provided the answer was Apple II User's Guide, 
by Poole, McNiff, and Cook. 

The last print statement before the control- 
D must not end with a semicolon or comma. If 
you use a get statement not followed by a print 
prior to print controi-D, the first character af- 
ter the get (which might be control-D) is ig- 
nored and not executed. 

1 hope this helps. If it isn't the right answer, 
I'd appreciate knowing what is. 
Martin Waxman, Fairfield, CT 

Glad To Help 

I am writing to respond to several letters that 
appeared in the June Open Discussion. 

To Dick Rettke: Before I purchased a DOS 
speedup package, I had heard the same warn- 
ing you expressed. I have been using Diversi- 
DOS for several months now and I find that, if 
anything, it is more reliable than DOS 3.3. In a 
recent comparative review of eight such prod- 
ucts, I read that Diversi-DOS was the only one 
that demonstrated significant improvement in 
save and bsave times. If the others are eliminat- 
ing the "verify after write" feature, it isn't help- 
ing much. 

According to that review, Diversi-DOS 
gains its speed in three ways. First, it writes the 
track/sector list after the whole file is saved. 
DOS 3.3 updates this list each time a new sec- 
tor is allocated, resulting in constant movement 
of the write head and unnecessary delay. Sec- 
ond, Diversi-DOS does away with the DOS 3.3 
method of reading each sector first and com- 
paring bytes. When you are saving a file or pro- 
gram, you don't care what used to be there. 
Third, DOS 3.3 uses a one-second delay for 
drive motor startup before reading or writing 
to or from the disk. Diversi-DOS allows you to 
shorten this time to a half second. According to 
the product's manual, ninety-nine percent of all 
drives will function properly with this delay 
time. Mine does just fine. 

I suspect that the feature you spoke of that 
allows reenabling is the verify command under 
Diversi-DOS, which differs from the DOS 3.3 
verify. This command allows the user to list a 
file directly from disk to the screen. When used 
on a text file, it is similar to executing a file with 
MON I,C,0, but it is a little more useful. When 
used on a Basic or binary file, it yields some 
amusing results. It is not, however, a "verify 
and write." 

To Stewart Loving-Gibbard: The instruc- 
tions for Diversi-DOS include the necessary 
pokes to let you accommodate forty-track

drives. Bill Basham has told me, however, that 
there is simply not room for Rana's patch for 
using different drives together. 

To Joe Fulford: To select a different drive 
from within a program, simply type poke 
43624, n where n is the number of the new drive. 
It will also let you select a new slot in the event 
you have more than one controller card. 

Regarding comments by Adam Taub and 
William Gentry: Perhaps I do not completely 
understand the problem that you, especially 
Mr. Taub, referred to. When program output is 
sent to a printer, it is printed according to the 
formatting in your print statements. The only 
instance in which control-I SON is necessary is 
in a program listing. Try the following: 

10 PR# 1 

20 FOR X = 1 TO 80 
30 PRINT 
40 NEXT X 
50 PR# 0 

When run, this program should produce 
one continuous line of dashes on an eighty-col- 
umn printer and two lines of dashes on the 
screen at the same time. The only reason for 
using control-I SON within a program is to dis- 
able output to the screen when printing. 
Hal Scoggins, Lake Jackson, TX 

I am answering Adam Taub's call for help (June 
Open Discussion). I had the same problem with 
my Centronics 730 printer, and with the new 
Prowriter I just bought. Both printers defaulted 
to forty columns when I couldn't send a "con- 
trol-I SON" to the printer. I have List Handler 
from Silicon Valley Systems, but there is no 
place to enter the special language for eighty 
columns. I called Silicon Valley Systems, and its 
customer service department immediately told 
me what to do. 

On the bottom left of the Apple parallel 
card is a PROM with the number 3410019 on it. 
This PROM needs to be replaced with one 
numbered 3410005 (the cost is about $13.50 
plus tax at a local computer store — a lot 
cheaper than a new card). Silicon also told me 
to disable the line feed on the printer. After re- 
placing the PROM and disabling the line feed, I 
found that the Prowriter worked perfectly. Ac- 
cording to our Apple ffn/er // instruction book, 
the Centronics printer does not issue a line feed, 
so you shouldn't have to change anything on 
the printer. I hope this helps. 
Leanna M. Cole, Amarillo, TX 

To Matt Capozza (June Open Discussion): 
When you program with DOS up and run- 
ning in the machine, there are two ways to 
transfer output to a card in one of the expansion 
slots. The first way is to just have the command 
PR#x, where x is the slot number. This is what I 
assume you are doing in your stamp program. 
TTie other way is to use DOS's control-D, which 
would come out as Print CHR$(4);"PR#";x. 
Whenever a command is executed from a pro- 
gram, DOS looks at it before Basic does to see if it 
was a DOS command (the first PR# is a Basic 
command, but the second is a DOS command) 



by checking to see if a CHR$(4) (or control-D, 
whichever you prefer) preceded it. If there was a 
CHR$(4), then DOS would reroute output to 
the device in slot x, meaning that DOS com- 
mands will still work — with an eighty-column 
card, for example. If there was not a CHR$(4), 
then output would be rerouted through Basic to 
the device, bypassing and therefore "discon- 
necting" DOS, making text file and other DOS 
commands inactive. I hope this solves the prob- 
lem, as I know it can be very frustrating when a 
program doesn't work the way you want it to. 

To Paul Brumbaugh (June Open Discus- 
sion): I don't know about the problem in your 
house, but it is possible to operate your Apple 
from the 12VDC available in your travel trail- 
er. There are a few companies that make con- 
verters that plug into your motherboard or into 
your power supply. RH Electronics makes 
an uninterruptable power source called the 
Guardian Angel that can power a computer, 
monitor, and printer from a trailer battery, in 
addition to providing protection from a power 
outage at home. I think there is also a company 
that makes just a 12VDC converter that plugs 
into your motherboard. I don't know the com- 
pany's name, but I think its product is caUed Ap- 
ple Juice. Your local dealer may know more 
about these, and possibly there are other prod- 
ucts that can do the same thing. 
Steve Lemke, Santa Barbara, CA 

I have been reading Softalk since it was less 
than fifty pages and had a "cute" picture of 
Darth Vader on the cover. Many times, when I 
could have responded to a reader's question in 
Open Discussion, I didn't, thinking that some- 
one else would. After reading through the June 
issue I found that I knew the answers to many 
of the questions asked, so I decided to write. 

To Paul Brumbaugh: After reading your let- 
ter I remanbered an ad I saw for a company 
called Integrated Switching Systems describing 
a product called Upbus. It contained a built-in 
monitor with a place to put a disk drive, as well 
as a rechargeable power supply to run the com- 
puter, drive, and everything else. It could also 
be plugged into a wall circuit, running the com- 
puter while recharging its batteries. It's sup- 
posed to support an external twelve-volt bat- 
tery and an adapter for a car. 

To Andrew Fishburn: If you have an Ep- 
son, you can send the printer the following 
characters to accomplish your goals: PR#1 (ini- 
tialize printer). Print CHR$(27)">" (this sets 
the high [eighth] bit to 1), Print CHRS(27)"=" 
(this sets the high [eighth] bit to 0). 

By sending the first code to the printer, all 
subsequent values sent will have 128 added to 
them, allowing you to send values from 12S to 
255. The second line switches the printer back 
to normal, where only values from 0 to 127 will 
be used. 

1 have thoroughly enjoyed all the past is- 
sues of Softalk and I look forward to many 
more. The only thing the magazine doesn't have 
anymore that I miss very much are the very 
heated arguments between readers in Open 
Discussion about piracy and sexually oriented 



ads. These letters were better than the daytime 
soaps on TV! I did recently see one juicy ad in 
the Classified Advertising section ("Orgy on 
your disk drive . . ."), and the letters on soft- 
ware piracy seem to be getting hotter, so maybe 
there's still hope.

Convert's Libation 

I'm not sure about the conversion of Atari cas- 
settes, but I know where Gregg Johnson (Jan- 
uary '83 Open Discussion) can find an article 
about TRS-80 program conversion. In the pre- 
miere issue of inCider magazine Hap Gaylord 
explains how to convert TRS-80 programs to 
the Apple.

Putting in for a Worli Transfer 

I am involved with a law firm that uses an 
Apple II Plus with CP/M — specifically, Word- 
Star. Over the years we have generated con- 
siderable client data and legal forms on our 
disks. If we were to change to another com- 
puter (such as the IBM pc or a dedicated word 
processor such as a Wang) would there be serv- 
ices or hardware products that would enable us 
to transfer work to this other computer with- 
out having to retype the data?

Does anyone know of a game that you can both 
save and turn the sound off on? My dad is 
hopelessly addicted to Snack Attack. Any time 
he wants to play, he makes me stop using the 
computer. This is terrible when I am in the 
middle of a line of programming that I'm trying 
to figure out. He is also late to some meals be- 
cause he's "on a roll," and it is very difficult to 
get to sleep over the sound of the game. It 
would be okay if he were very good, but his 
high score is only about thirty-five hundred — 
well under mine.

Continental 



AT THE 
FOREFRONT 

OF THE 
REVOLUTION 





BV DAVID UUItTCIi 




Tall, physically fit, inwardly composed, Jim Sadlier is one of those 
smart entrepreneurs who quietly go about their business and make small 
fortunes. He's a careful observer of the business community and he's 
patient. As president of both Continental Software and the Book 
Company, Sadlier is capable of making decisions fast and acting upon 
them with the same speed. 

Initially drawn from the East Coast to California by things other 
than computers, Sadlier is one of the lucky ones who've struck it rich in 
the silicon Promised Land. He would probably have succeeded wherever 
he went. 

Stock and Trade. Prior to entering the microcomputer field, Sadlier 
worked as a floor trader in the securities industry. He is a native of 
Brooklyn and grew up in New York City. A graduate of Brooklyn 
College with a degree in economics, Sadlier spent several years working 
in and around Wall Street before moving to the West Coast in Sep- 
tember 1974. 

Not a technical person, Sadlier gained his strength from a grounding 
in business fundamentals and experience acquired while holding a seat 
on the American Stock Exchange and as a partner in a small brokerage 



house. In the mid-seventies, as a registered representative for financial in- 
stitutions, Sadlier first discovered microcomputers. 

While working in Merrill Lynch's institutional sales department, 
Sadlier researched the investment potential of Commodore and its Pet 
line of products. In early 1977, he traveled to the company to meet with 
Commodore founders Chuck Peddle and Jack Tramiel. He came to a 
quick conclusion that personal computers might be the next hot industry. 

"I got so hyped by the potential of the industry," he says, "that I 
started looking for a way to enter it." 

But how does a Wall Street businessman with no technical knowl- 
edge get into the computer industry? Simple, ally yourself with someone 
who has the expertise and then dazzle everyone with your business sense. 

Sadlier saw a magazine ad for a company that was offering a com- 
plete turnkey operation for opening a computer store. That company 
was ComputerLand. After meeting with the firm's cofounder and pres- 
ident, Ed Faber, Sadlier decided that the Sunnyvale, California-based 
group had the best program he'd heard of for opening a retail store. 

The Right Spot. When Sadlier's ComputerLand of South Bay, in 
Lawndale, California, opened in early 1978, it was the fourth such

publisher, and financial wizard. 



franchise store in soutiiern California. It was a risky operation; com- 
puter stores started up and failed by the hundreds in the late seventies 
and early eighties. But Sadlier chose his location wisely — a strategic spot 
south of Los Angeles near affluent suburban Palos Verdes, industrial 
parks, and such high-technology firms as TRW and Northrop. 

To compensate for his own lack of technical expertise, Sadlier relied 
on ComputerLand and hired knowledgeable people to work in the store. 
From the start, ComputerLand of South Bay was a successful venture. 

When Sadlier first opened the store, it was practically a microcom- 
puter supermarket — carrying Imsai, Northstar, Cromemco, and Apple 
products. As more low-priced systems like the Apple II came out, the 
technical hobbyist community was drawn to microcomputers. Later the 
market would shift to small business and would fast approach the mass 
consumer stage. 

The shifting market trends of the microcomputer industry, reflected 
in the day-to-day business transacted at his store, was something that 
Sadlier was trained to watch. With his foot in the door of the industry, he 
began peering inside and gathering information. 

Above all else, he listened to the customers at his store. What did 
they like and dislike? What did they not understand? After a couple of 
years of observing, Sadlier believed he knew the answers to some of these 
questions. 

Sadlier identified two areas that caused customers the most prob- 
lems — a lack of good information about software, and the fact that there 
was little good software to begin with. In 1980, he began thinking of 
ways to address these needs of the market. 

A Local Meeting Place. ComputerLand of South Bay was much 
more than just another outlet for microcomputer products. It was a 
meeting place, a temple for the lost and weary in the early days of per- 
sonal computing. Sadlier became a wise leader and some of his 
customers formed a skilled and loyal following. 



When he began developing his first product, The Book of Apple Soft- 
ware (published by the Book Company), Sadlier naturally turned to his 
more knowledgeable customers for contributions to the collection of 
software reviews. One of these was Jeffrey Stanton, a programmer and 
general computer whiz. Stanton wrote many reviews for the first Book of 
Apple Software, as well as editing a large portion of it. 

Two early customers, Kathy and Mike Farmer, became friends of 
Sadlier. One day they came into the store and listened to Sadlier 
complain at length about what a hassle all the store's paperwork had 
become. "I told him I love to do paperwork," says Kathy Farmer. "He 
said, 'You're hired.' " 

Sadlier, Farmer, Stanton, and a high school student, Pam Nowatka 
(who worked part-time in the store), shipped the first copies of The Book 
of Apple Software out of a storefront located next to the South Bay Com- 
puterLand. It was a modest beginning. Then Sadlier turned his attention 
to software. 

Bob Schoenberg and Steve Pollack were two would-be program.- 
mers when they first met Sadlier through the ComputerLand store. 
Sadlier had noticed that Apple's Checkbook program seemed to sell well. 
He could never stock enough copies of it. He also remembers listening to 
the comments of users of that program. 

"They said, i wish it could do this and I wish it could do that,' " re- 
calls the nontechnical Sadlier. Well "this and that" is what Sadlier, 
Schoenberg, and Pollack agreed upon as the basis for the Home Money 
Minder — the earliest precursor of Home Accountant, which sold for 
$34.95 in late 1980. 

Twins. Sadlier formed the Book Company and Continental Soft- 
ware at the same time. Both were risky propositions, perhaps more risky 
than opening a computer store. Even more challenging was trying to 
make the transition from seller to producer — a transition that few have 
managed successfully. 

Sadlier decided to give it a go and experiment. He reasoned that lis- 
tening to customers and following his business sense and the advice of in- 
dividuals like Softsel's founder Bob Leff — Sadlier first met Leff back 
when the now-giant distribution company was being run out of LefTs 
apartment — ought to ensure success. 

It has, and Sadlier is not surprised. 

"Could I imagine the success Continental would have? Yes. I've 
looked at the historical perspective, the life cycles of many different indus- 
tries. I know how fast they can explode and grow. Computers are similar 
to space technology. I've seen it a lot of times." 

This is not to say that starting up two companies has been easy or 
that Sadlier didn't do a lot of experimenting in the beginning. In the sum- 
mer of 1980, Sadlier was the first software publisher to place an order for 
an ad in Softalk's premier issue. His modest half-page black-and-white 
ad for Continental Software was bordered by American flags and stars 
and began with the headline, "Revolutionary Programs from Continen- 
tal Software for Your Apple Computer." (Sadlier chose the name Con- 
tinental Software because he is a serious collector of coins and artifacts 
dating back to the time of the Continental Congress.) 

That first ad plugged five programs — L.A. Land Monopoly, The 
Mailroom. Hyperspace Wars, Home Money Minder, and General Ledger. 

In those days, the game market was not dominated by a half-dozen 
or so companies the way it is now. Sadlier, like a hundred other software 
publishers, tried his hand, with limited success. Monopoly, Hyperspace 
Wars, and later games like 3-D Skiing were grand experiments, but Sadlier 
knew when he was outclassed. Except for Guardian and Cross Country 
Rallye, both of which appeared in the summer of 1982, Continental has 
pretty much left games to the games companies. 

Sadlier is first and foremost a businessman, so it's not surprising that 
Continental has concentrated almost entirely on financial and business 
software for the home and the small business. What's surprising is how 
well the company has succeeded with only a limited number of prod- 
ucts. Credit goes to Sadlier and his business philosophy, shared by those 
who work closely with him. 

Sadlier cultivated the art of listening to the owners of Home Money 
Minder and The Mailroom, just as he had listened to customers in the re- 
tail store. He believes that the relationship with the customer is crucial,

for this is the best way to find out what is lacking in a product. And 
improving a product is the best way to iceep making money. 

Home Accountants. In early 1982, Schoenberg and Pollack teamed 
up with Larry Grodin to bring out an updated Home Money Minder, 
changing the product's name to The Home Accountant. Few will contest 
the success that the new-and-improved Home Accountant has achieved in 
the Apple market. Since late 1981, either as Home Money Minder or as 
Home Accountant, the program has been a regular on Softalk's Top 
Thirty Bestseller list. Through the early part of this year, the program 
was firmly rooted in the top five, outpaced only by such heavyweights as 
VisiCalc and Apple Writer H. It reached number two last month, finally 
unseating VisiCalc. 

The Mail room became 1st Class Mail in late 1981, and then meta- 
morphosed again early this year into FCM with added features, such as 
the ability to merge FCM files with word processing files. 

Perceiving a need for a good tax program, Sadlier brought out Tax 
Advantage in late 1982. Although it didn't outsell more established prod- 
ucts. Tax Advantage made a decent showing in the market. You can bet 
that Sadlier and company are listening closely to the program's owners, 
planning for next year's update. 

Two years ago, the Book Company and Continental Software were 
still fairly small-time operations. Once Home Accountant and 1st Class 
Mail started to sell in large numbers, the two companies began to out- 
grow the confines of the storefront next to the ComputerLand. 

Sadlier moved the expanding Book Company and Continental into a 
momentarily spacious office suite near the Los Angeles International Air- 
port. The two companies, seemingly overrun with talented and qualified 
personnel, are now bursting the walls of that location and are actively 
seeking more space. 

Dynamic Duo. Hank Scheinberg, executive vice president and direc- 
tor of markefing for both Continental and the Book Company, and Jim 
Sadlier have known each other for close to ten years. They have com- 
mon roots — years on Wall Street — and the same quick-as-a-

Minuteman business instincts. 

A graduate of Trinity College in Connecficut, Scheinberg was raised 
in a small farm town in rural eastern Long Island. He spent sixteen years 
on Wall Street in institutional sales and research. Sadlier says that 
Scheinberg is good at spotting trends, at "knowing what's going to 
be hot." 

Scheinberg moved to southern California in the early seventies and 
got into a hot industry — real estate. He continued investing and even- 
tually became an executive of one of the largest real estate firms in the 
state. Scheinberg met Sadlier on a tennis court in Marina del Rey back in 
1974 and the two have been friends ever since. 

Once again, Scheinberg is certain that he's gotten into a hot industry. 
Though he is another nontechie, Scheinberg knows plenty about 
marketing. He has done a first-rate job, quadrupling Continental's sales 
while competing with the best of them — Apple Computer, Broderbund, 
and VisiCorp. 

"Basically, Jim comes up with the products, and I get them out the 
door," says Scheinberg. Actually, as many as fifty other people are in- 
volved in the process, but the power at the top is split between Sadlier 
and Scheinberg, who are now co-owners of Continental and the Book 
Company. 

Scheinberg, who was into real estate for seven years, feels that com- 
puters are going to be a long-lived trend. He quotes John Naisbitt, au- 
thor of Megatrends: "It isn't the Hula-Hoop." 

According to the Book. The managerial role of minding the Book 
Company has been taken on by Dr. Robert Wells, who has been with the 
company for about a year. Prior to joining the Book Company, Wells 
was a professor at Edinburgh University in Scotland — the same school 
at which he earned a Ph.D. in English lit. 

Currently, Wells is responsible for overseeing the Book Company's 
growing line of publications catering to several different personal com- 
puters. One of the biggest tasks facing Wells and his staff is wading 
through the large amounts of information for the annual updates of The 
Book of Apple Software and its sister pubhcation for the Atari com- 
puters. 

"We're gaining ground all the time," says Wells. "We know our 
audience better each time around. But it's still a hell of a lot of work." 

Following through on Sadher's original idea of providing useful 
information about software. Wells makes no bones about The Book of 
Apple Software's policy of not running advertising. "We're out to inform 
the consumer, not please the manufacturer," says Wells. "We don't do in- 
house reviews and we don't pay our reviewers. They keep the program 
as payment. We try to keep the reviews consumer-minded and very fair." 

Working with Wells is Sandra Rochowansky, who earned the 
master's degree in English at UCLA. Through a friend of hers, Rocho- 
wansky got into writing documentation for the computer industry, even- 
tually finding her way to the Book Company a little over a year ago. 

Currently, Rochowansky is working on a number of projects, 
including finding suitable reviewers, acquiring new products for review, 
and attending to administrative details. 

Bookmeister. Jeffrey Stanton, author of the book Apple Graphics & 
Arcade Game Design, is a consulting editor at the Book Company and is 
rarely seen in the office nowadays. He's usually at home working hard on 
any of a number of projects. 

Jim Densmore (or J.D., as he's called by many) is a sharp individual 
in charge of a very important facet of Continental's operations. Contin- 
ental's ninth employee, Densmore has been with the company for more 
than two years. He began in the shipping and receiving department and 
served a six-month stint in customer support. He now handles special as- 
signments, which means a little of everything. 

Of primary importance is Densmore's overseeing of the alpha and 
beta testing phases before a product is released. He is one of the first to 
be fully aware of the quality of a product and frequently interfaces with 
the customer support and marketing departments. Densmore also works 
with authors, developing programs and enhancing existing products. He 
sees himself as responsible for ensuring the quality of a program before it 
hits the market. 

Just this past May, Gerald Lewis was appointed Continental's direc- 




If you could runyour

20 times faster, 

would it be such 
a terrible thing? 



Minutes spent sitting at a computer waiting for your program 
to run can add up to hours of wasted time. And, since time is 
money, unproductive time can cost you a small fortune. 

If you write software in Applesoft™ BASIC, you need the 
Einstein Compiler. 

With a single command, it automatically translates your BASIC 
into far more efficient machine language. The compiled version 
of your progam then runs many times faster than the uncompiled 
version. And you'll save time— every time you run it. 

The Einstein Compiler, which enables you to compile and 
execute multi-module programs, contains sophisticated tools for 
debugging your programs and for protecting program security 
A unique code compression algorithm keeps the size of your 
compiled program to a minimum, saving you memory without 
sacrificing speed of execution. 

If you're a novice programmer who didn't understand any of 
that— don't worry about it. With all Einstein Master Programs; 
even the User Guide is human factored. All you need to know is 
that the Einstein Compiler will save you time and money

tor of software development. He screens and evaluates new programs be- 
ing considered for publication. Prior to joining Continental, Lewis was 
an independent systems analyst and software documentation consultant 
for such companies as Standard Logic. 

Lewis, Densmore, and marketing manager Denny Mosier are the 
three one-person departments at Continental. According to the official 
press release, Mosier is responsible for research, advertising, public rela- 
tions, planning future software programs, and supporting existing 
products. 

Master of Marketing. Mosier joined Continental early this spring; in 
the past, he's been an account executive with Simon/Public Relations, a 
high-tech public relations firm, and an L.A.-based correspondent for 
Electronic News, a trade publication. 

Mary Watt is Continental's vice president of operations. Watt left a 
career in banking for an entry-level job in the computer industry. She 
found it at Continental in June of 1981 . In those early days, Watt, Kathy 
Farmer, and Pam Nowatka for the most part ran the whole show — the 
business and administrative side of the company. 

Currently, Watt is responsible for overseeing customer service and 
the all-important day-to-day order entry operations. Nowatka works in 
accounts receivable and has the title of assistant to the vice president of 
administration. She can still recall that first shipment of The Book of Ap- 
ple Software in 1980; she remembers when Continental Software was "a 
gleam in Jim and Kathy's eyes." 

Like Sadlier and Farmer, Nowatka seems to have adjusted well to 
Continental's continued growth. The company now has close to sixty 
full-time, in-house employees, as well as a fluctuating number of tem- 
porary helpers. 

Continental's vice president of purchasing and production, George 
Rodgers, has been with the company since February 1982. His depart- 
ment of seventeen is the largest in the company, occupying a large ship- 
ping area in the back of the building. 

Rodgers and his department went through their toughest trials last 
Christmas. Home Accountant. FCM. and particularly Tax Advantage 
had high end-of-the-year sales and Rodgers says the workload kept 
everybody jumping. 

Where To Go for a Tune-up. Continental's customer service depart- 
ment employs seven people full-time. Customer service manager Rich 
West says the department gets between fifty and sixty phone calls a day. 
On the average, one out of every twenty inquiries requires expert, tech- 
nical advice. Most of the others concern simple questions that are usually 
answered in the manuals. 

Peter Castillo runs what is called "the information desk" at Conti- 
nental. A new service, the information desk is designed to relieve the cus- 



tomer service and sales departments. Castillo answers order and order- 
entry questions before the product is in the user's hands. 

Last, but not least. Continental has a crack sales staff. With more 
than twenty-two hundred dealers across the nation, regional sales man- 
agers Tere White, Barbara Ring, and Stephanie Loysen work hard to 
keep in constant contact with the marketplace. They've been joined re- 
cently by Penny Olender, Jennifer Bartel, Sally Hammer, and Mike 
Hilton. 

Sadlier is a good leader of this group. He's serious but also ap- 
proachable. 

"It's always tough to find really good people," he says. "Achieving 
the right chemistry, a successful company personality, is a team effort." 

So far Continental and the Book Company are winning the game. A 
fast tour through the offices of the two companies reveals a hard- 
working, happy bunch of people. The atmosphere often extends beyond 
the office to employee get-togethers and coed softball games. 

If Sadlier feels much pressure being the president of two companies 
in the still highly volatile and highly unpredictable microcomputer indus- 
try, he doesn't show it. He's confident, for a number of reasons, that 
Continental and the Book Company are here to stay. 

Market Watch. First and foremost is his faith in the practice of 
studying the marketplace and coming up with new products that meet a 
pressing demand. Second is his philosophy of taking existing products 
and improving them based on feedback from customers and dealers. 
Third is his belief in bringing out only those products that jibe with his 
existing product line. It's not likely you'll see too many graphics utility 
or word processing programs coming out of Continental in the foresee- 
able future. 

Sadlier is also a firm believer in being able to react fast to a changing 
market. It's an advantage he claims over larger companies that make 
"decisions by committee." 

In the future. Continental and the Book Company will build on their 
present product lines, creating in some cases "families of products," says 
Sadlier. There will be many more books, software with an accounting 
flavor, and possibly educational software. 

"Around the turn of the century, there were three or four hundred 
companies in the automobile industry," says Sadlier. "Cars became a big 
part of our lifestyle, and the same thing is happening with computers 
today. But that doesn't necessarily mean that only a half dozen of the 
hundreds of computer companies around today will survive." 

The industry will continue to evolve; there will be a shifting of the 
ranks from time to time and not everyone will make it. Sadlier is con- 
fident his companies can keep pace. 

"We will be a survivor."

We've spoken a lot in the past about fundamental analysis. This 
month, we'll look at our first piece of fundamental analysis software, the 
Dow Jones Market Microscope from Dow Jones and Company. But be- 
fore we get started, just what is fundamental analysis? 

In this context, the term fundamental essentially means basic. Where- 
as the technical indicators used in technical analysis are based on trends 
in the price or volume of a particular security, fundamental statistics are 
concerned with basic indicators of corporate or industry performance. 
Therefore, fundamental analysis considers such things as quarterly earn- 
ings, debt/equity ratio, and what the dividend stream looks like; it also 
attempts to determine how these factors may affect performance. 

The two most popular forms of fundamental analysis are ratio analy- 
sis and variance analysis. In ratio analysis, you compute what percentage 
one number is of an aggregate number. A corporation's debt /equity ra- 
tio is a good example to consider. Let's assume that XYZ company has 
$50,000 worth of debt outstanding and a total equity capitalization 
of $100,000. This means that the company's debt /equity ratio is 
50,000/1,000,000, or .5. In other words, 50 percent of the capitalization 
of the company comes from debt. 

What significance this has depends on the industry or business you're 
looking at. In order to determine whether a debt /equity ratio of .5 is 
good or bad in a particular instance, you'd have to research the compa- 
rable figures for that business or industry. (If you invest, then, the lessons 
to be learned here are "Don't judge a book by its cover" and "Remem- 
ber, all books are different.") 

Variance analysis shows how things change. Have sales increased or 
decreased over the last five years? What about earnings and other rele- 
vant factors? Variance analysis quickly isolates growth or contraction 
trends and gives some idea where a company might be headed. 

Now that we have a clearer idea of what fundamental analysis is, let's 
look at this month's program. 

Dow Jones Market Microscope, Dow Jones and Company (Box 300, 
Princeton, NJ 08540; 609-452-2000). $699. 
Backup policy: two disks included. 

System requirements: 48K Apple II (with language or Applesoft card), 
Apple n Plus or He, or Apple III, two disk drives. D.C. Hayes Micro- 
modem II or a modem with an acoustic coupler, RS-232 Communica- 
tions Interface Card or Super Serial Card, eighty-column card. 

In the past, investors who wished to use a microcomputer to follow 
fundamental indicators had to collect information by hand from Bar- 
ron's, the Wall Street Journal, a local newspaper, or one of the electronic 
publishing services (such as Dow Jones, CompuServe, or the Source). 
They then entered it into a database or spreadsheet program, and once 
that was done a variety of analyses became possible. 

By contrast, as you may have surmised, the Dow Jones Market Mi- 
croscope, like the rest of the Dow Jones software family, obtains infor- 
mation by means of the Dow Jones News/ Retrieval Service. In fact, it's 
not possible to enter inforriiation into the system by hand. Some poten- 
tial users will consider this a major drawback, but it should be pointed 
out that Dow Jones carries a plethora of financial information, statistics, 



and corporate information. It's doubtful that this information could be 
collected manually at less cost, let alone in less time. 

To get started using the Market Microscope, you must first supply 
the program with the information it needs to function (such as what type 
of printer and modem you have and what slots your peripherals are lo- 
cated in). Because you'll be using the Dow Jones News/Retrieval Serv- 
ice, you must also enter your local Telenet and Tymenet numbers and 
your Dow Jones ten-character password. Once this information is stored 
on the program disk. Market Microscope can connect you to the Dow 
Jones News/ Retrieval Service automatically. 

After logging on to the system, you tell Market Microscope which 
network you want to use (Telenet or Tymenet) and the local access num- 
ber; from there, it does the rest.

program is the time-out option. Time-outs are the amount of time the 
computer will stay connected to Dow Jones when you aren't requesting 
information from the remote computer. Market Microscope has a preset 
time-out limit of ninety seconds; this limit can be extended to three, six, 
or nine minutes. The time-out option helps you avoid unnecessary time 
charges. 

Once you've initialized a data disk, you're ready to begin creating the 
files that will update stock prices and give you the information you need 
in order to perform your fundamental analysis. The first thing to do is to 
select a set of indicators from one of two Dow Jones databases. The Me- 
dia General database includes information on dividends, price-earnings 
ratios, and stock price performance of thirty-two hundred companies 
listed on the New York and American Stock Exchanges and selected 
over-the-counter companies. Information on one hundred eighty differ- 
ent industries is also included. The Corporate Earnings Estimator data- 
base contains the consensus forecasts of earnings per share (drawn from 
the estimates of one thousand research analysts and forty-five major 
brokerage firms) for twenty-four hundred companies. 

To help you select the indicators you want to use, Market Micro- 
scope will scroll through a list of the sixty-eight available indicators on 
the Apple's display. Scrolling is controlled by means of the left and right 
arrow keys, and when an indicator you want to use appears, you simply 
depress the space bar to mark it. Once you've gone through the list, you 
can review your selections by scrolling back through. The indicators you 
marked earlier will be highlighted. 

Saving your choices to disk is done by depressing the dollar-sign key 
(shift 4). This unique key choice is used throughout the program and 
helps avoid the accidental saving of information that might occur if this 
function were linked to the return key or to escape. 

Having saved the information you're going to use in analyzing the 
stocks in your portfolio, you must tell Market Microscope what those se- 
curities are. This is done by creating a stock list or an industry list. A list 
IS a file of stocks that are updated by the indicators. The nicely laid-out 



catalog screen shows how many lists are on file. You can choose a pre- 
viously created list or create a new one. 

Market Microscope uses two types of lists, industry and special. An 
industry list is composed of stocks within the same Media General in- 
dustry group. (For example, Apple, IBM, Control Data, and Tandy are 
all computer stocks, and the Media General industry group that con- 
tains the indicators on these companies is number 170 — Computers, Sys- 
tems, and Peripherals.) A special list is made up of an assortment of in- 
dustry groups or an assortment of stocks from different industry groups. 

The program differentiates between an industry list and a special list 
by the file name or identifier it assigns. Industry lists are given three-digit 
numbers, all of which are included in the appendix of the user manual. 
Special lists start with an S, followed by two digits chosen by the investor. 

Having chosen the indicators you want to use in jour analysis and 
the stocks you wish to analyze, you're ready to request information from 
Dow Jones. You're asked whether you want to update all stock and in- 
dustry data or only part of it, as well as which lists you want to use. As 
soon as Market Microscope has this information, it activates your mo- 
dem, dials, and connects you to the Dow Jones News /Retrieval Service. 
It then automatically gets and stores all of the indicators and stock prices 
you requested. When the Apple's memory fills up, the program instructs 
the Dow Jones computer to stop sending, saves the information in mem- 
ory to disk, and then restarts the Dow Jones computer. As soon as every- 
thing you want has been saved to disk successfully, the program auto- 
matically disconnects you from Dow Jones. Now you're ready to begin 
your analysis. 

Market Microscope offers two analysis techniques. In the first — the 
"screen stocks and industry groups analysis" — the program screens the 
lists you've prepared and issues a buy or sell recommendation based on 
your criteria. In the second technique, called a "price alert," Market Mi- 
croscope scans your lists, identifies each stock that meets criteria you've 
established for twelve parameters, and issues the appropriate recom- 
mendation.

To use the screen stocks and industry groups analysis technique, you 
must define your analysis criteria by establishing buy or sell screens. 
These screens consist of a maximum of sixteen indicators out of the pos- 
sible twenty you selected earlier. (The current price and last day's vol- 
ume information can also be included as criteria.) The indicators can be 
scrolled through on the Apple's display the same way that they were 
when you originally chose them. Since they'll appear on the printed anal- 
ysis report in the order they were chosen, you'll want to select indicators 
in the order of their relative importance to your investment decision. 

You're also required to select a ranking order (high to low or low to 
high) to control the sorting of the information on the printed report; in 
essence, you're choosing an ascending or descending sort. You must also 
supply the limits of the sort. For example, selecting the indicator "52- 
week high price" and then specifying a high to low sort tells the program 
that you're interested only in stocks that have a 52-week high greater 
than $25. (A limit need not be specified, but having one is helpful in 
many forms of analysis.) This limiting feature acts as a filter that allows 
the program to omit from the report stocks that you wouldn't be inter- 
ested in. If an industry composite figure is listed in the file you retrieve, 
you can request that the software use it as a limit. 

Let's assume you've just created a sell screen. When you run the sell- 
ing analysis, Market Microscope will pass through the list you selected 
and test each stock against the screening criteria. Once that's done, the 
program will begin printing out the screening report (this report won't 
display on-screen, however). The complete report consists of the results 
of the screening, criterion by criterion. The stocks will be ranked high to 
low or low to high, whatever you chose earlier. The limit you selected, 
along with the industry composite figure, will also be displayed. Any 
stock that exceeded any of the criteria you chose will be separated from 
the rest of the group by a symbol. 

You have your choice of printing the entire screening report or just 
the rank matrix. The rank matrix is a graphic representation of the anal- 
ysis, in which the horizontal axis represents the indicators that were used 
for the analysis and the vertical axis shows the stocks that were ana- 
lyzed. Each entry is ranked numerically on the left-hand side of the ma- 
trix, while the right-hand side shows whether a given stock meets or beats 
the limit set. Two other pieces of information are shown at the bottom of 
the rank matrix — the number of stocks that meet or exceed the limit se- 
lected and the total number of stocks compared. 

Using the price-alert feature requires that you define the alert points, 
or changes, in the price-alert indicators that you consider significant. Do- 
ing this entails setting the support and resistance prices and the values for 
the twelve price-alert tests. These tests use the support and resistance 
prices in their calculations. The percentage movement parameters in each 
test are input and controlled by the investor. Together, they provide in- 
vestors with the price-alert checks identified in the list below. The pro- 
gram's reporting precedence h^archy ensures that the most important 
movements are reported first and that movements that neutralize one 
another are not reported. 

Price-Alert Checks 

Up-break alarm— tests to see if the stock price has moved up the 
percentage supplied by the investor. 

Down-break alarm — tests to see if the stock price has dropped the 
specified percentage. 

Resistance-price update — if the price of the stock does move over the 
alert percentage specified, the resistance price will be updated to reflect the 
new condition. 

Support update— if the price of the stock falls below the specified 
percentage, the support price will be updated to reflect the new condition. 

Support-level buy recommendation — this reflects a movement over the 
support price but below the resistance price. The investing assumption is that 
the price will "rebound" from the support level, making the potential return 
sufficient to warrant investment consideration. If the condition is met, a buy 
recommendation will be issued. 

Breakout buy recommendation— if the stock price exceeds the 
resistance level and exceeds the support level, a recommendation to buy the 
stock will be issued. The investment assumption is that the stock price has 
broken out of its previous pattern and will continue to rise. 

Resistance-level sell— if the current price of the stock is less than the 
resistance level and above its support price. Market Microscope will issue a 
recommendation to sell the stock short. The investing assumption is that the

price will move downward from the resistance price enough to cover the in- 
vestment. 

Breakout sell recommendation— if the current price of the stock is below 
its support-level percentage and less than the resistance-level percentage, a 
short-sell recommendation will be issued. The assumption is that the price of 
the stock is falling to a new resistance level. 

Market Microscope provides a full range of easy-to-use and well- 
documented data-editing utilities to accommodate users who make mis- 
takes or change their minds. These include delete, rename, add, edit, and 
view. The package also offers a Dow Jones E-Z Terminal mode, which is 
used to access Dow Jones for information other than that used by the 
Market Microscope during updates. E-Z Terminal has a fifteen-thou- 
sand-character buffer that stores information in memory. Investors can 
select the information they want saved and send it to disk. This ability, 
coupled with a formatting feature that makes information on the Apple's 
display easier to read, makes E-Z Terminal a nice added feature. 

For those times when you just want to know the current price of a 
stock you're following, Market Microscope can print out an alphabeti- 
cal listing of all stocks being carried on the system. This report tells you 
which list the stock resides in (in case you want to use the view feature to 
see all the indicators), the current price, and the support and resistance 
prices that are labeled trading range. After the alphabetical stock list has 
been printed, a second report is generated. It shows all the lists on disk 
arranged alphabetically, the last date each list was updated, and the date 
the indicators were set. The last date updated is critical — you may be 
looking at a report that contains month-old prices; making a decision on 
the basis of an out-of-date report could have unpleasant consequences. 

A Few Bugs. Market Microscope does have a few problems. If you 
are unsuccessful in an attempt to log on to Dow Jones and then you go 
on to the main body of the program. Market Microscope won't remem- 
ber to disconnect your modem. Your phone will be busy for however 
long you continue to work with the program, but you may not realize it. 
In addition, you can carry only one set of indicators per disk, so if you 
want to judge the performance of various lists of stocks against different 
indicators, you must put them on different data disks. In the long run, of 
course, this will cause you to develop a disk-management problem. It 
would be preferable if investors could link the stock lists to different in- 
dicators if they wanted to. 

Market Microscope also limits you to one buy and one sell screen per 
data disk. Disk-management problems are likely to come up here as well 
and the solution should be obvious: The program's authors have written 
wonderful menu routines and would do well to use them here also to al- 
low users to make the appropriate selections. 

Also, when you run the price-alert feature, you can choose only one 
list at a time or a set of lists. When working with a data disk with lots of 
lists on it, you'll wind up sitting there a pretty long time, typing in the list 
number each time you run price alert. Again, it would be much nicer to 
be able to take advantage of the menus that were developed for other 
parts of the program. 

On the plus side, the screens used in the program are well thought out 
and well executed and the program is well error-trapped. In addition, 
Market Microscope performs all of its functions in a reasonable period 
of time. 

The program documentation is clear, well done, and nicely typeset. 
There are a few errors and omissions, but all in all it's a professional job. 
And, of course, Dow Jones has an 800 help line for users of the Dow 
Jones News/Retrieval Service and Dow Jones software. If they won't 
support you, nobody will. 

So, should you buy Market Microscope If you believe in fundamen- 
tal analysis, have the money to spend on Dow Jones News/Retrieval 
Service updates, and can afford the price of the program, the answer is 
yes. It's the first major fundamental package on the market, and it will 
probably set the standard by which all future fundamental packages are 
judged. 

Because of the massive and diverse amounts of data involved in fun- 
damental analysis, especially what's required by the techniques used in 
this program, fundamental analysis isn't the easiest way to analyze in- 
vestment alternatives. Is it the best? That you must decide.

With this program, you can enter the coordinates of points of inter-

to connect with the lines. Then you can view your object, rotate it in 
three dimensions, move it and scale it, stretch and compress it, and save 
it to and load it from disk. 

Remember, the program's written in Basic, so you shouldn't expect 
animation speed. What you can expect, however, is a good introduction 
to how 3-D figures can be handled on a computer. 

We'll use the calculations discussed last month, which resulted in the 
equation: 

X * ID 



PX 



ID + Z 



translated into Basic form for our program. The calculation for project- 
ing a 3-D coordinate onto the two-dimensional screen can be found in 
lines 840 through 860. (Note that the values used are coordinates, not 
distances, as in the formula. Therefore, ID-Z(I) in lines 840 and 850 is 
actually the distance between ID and Z, since one of the values is nega- 
tive and the other positive.) The calculations for moving the figure in 
each direction are in lines 1290 through 1310. The scaling calculations are in 
lines 780 through 810, and the rotation calculations are in lines 740 
through 760. The rest of the program is essentially window dressing, al- 
lowing you to enter, edit, save, and load your figures and to make your 
choices. 

The only other section that's interesting from a mathematical stand- 
point is that from lines 970 through 1080. Although this section looks 
complex, it's actually just broken down into cases. These instructions 
perform the calculations necessary for "clipping." When a line is ready to 
be drawn, what happens if one of the endpoints is off the physical screen? 
The easy options are not to draw it at all (even though half or most of it 
might actually be in the visible range) or to have the endpoints wrap 
around (this creates a real mess, but it's fast). 

The best way visually, although it is slower, is to figure out where the 
line would have gone off the screen and then to use that as the endpoint 
instead of the point that was off the screen. The calculations for clipping 
use the slope of the line to figure the point at which the line should end. 
Note also that we're using a coordinate system that has the origin (0,0) in 
the middle of the screen, with X and Y increasing to the right and up re- 
spectively. Therefore, when the line is drawn in line 1 100, it recomputes 
the coordinates to fit Apple's (0,0) in the upper left, with Y increasing 
downward. 

A Breakdown of the Program. We've been talking conceptually 
about three-dimensional graphics up to now. The program breakdown 
that follows, and the accompanying list of important variables, should be 



useful to anyone who wants to modify the program or analyze it in great- 
er depth. 

Lines 10—30 initialize the arrays and variables. 
Lines 40 —80 give and act on the main editing choices. 
Lines 90-230 allow you to list and edit the coordinates and lines in 
your figure. 

Lines 240 —440 let you save a 3-D file or read one from disk. 

Lines 450 —490 let you save the screen image from your projected ob- 
ject as a picture file. 

Lines 500-560 allow you to enter the points and lines for a new 
figure. 

Lines 570-680 compute a center for the figure by finding the largest 
and smallest X, Y, and Z coordinates and then averaging each pair.

Lines 690-820 contain the rotation and scaling formulas fdr move- 
ment. The variable C is set for the type of movement in lines 1 1 80- 1 240. 

Lines 830-870 project the 3-D coordinates into the two-dimension- 
al plane of the monitor screen. 

Lines 880- i 1 iO take the projected points, scale them to viewing size, 
and then draw the lines of the figure on the screen. 

Lines 1 120- 1 390 get the operation that you want to perform and the 
parameters of the operation, if necessary, and usually jump back up to 
line 700 to redraw.

COMPRESS/EXPAND 
A Must for any 
Serious Programmer 

Most -;;-Apple picture files take up to 34 
disk sectors of storage. This limits the number 
of pictures that can be saved on one disk. The 
SANSOFT PLUS COMPRESS/EXPAND 
System allows you to process any standard 
picture files and compress it into a much 
smaller file that requires less disk space. 
Some pictures can be compressed by as 
much as 90% requiring only a few sectors, 
depending on picture complexity. Since less 
sectors are used, pictures load faster requiring 
less disk time. A small routine requiring less 
than 256 words can be loaded into any one of 
several locations and be called from your 
programs allowing amazing results, as your 
high quality pictures appear in less time with 
NO loss of quality. This program comes on an 
unprotected disk that can be copied and 
backed up. 

No programmer should be without this 
one -;;--!<•

This is Mark Pelczarski's last Graphically Speaking for Softalk,- // appears that 
the more penguins you have, the more time it takes to keep them frnk-frnking. Then, 
too. we all must sometimes choose one value over another. Undoubtedly, for Pelczar- 
ski, the fame of authorship gave way to the glory of athletics; he covets the miniature- 
golf water-hazard championship of the world. 

Gone is not forgotten, though: Pelczarski will continue on as advisory editor Jor 
Apple graphics and golfing for Softalk. 

Starting next month, beginning at the very beginning, Softalk graphics col- 
umnist will be a programmer you may have heard of and whose face you've certainly 
seen — everyone's favorite phony beginner, pinball champ Bill Budge. 

Tell your friends and tune in. 



Now Apple users 
can make their 
business presentations 
picture perfect. 




If you've ever made a business 
presentation, you Wno^ what a 
help a graphics department can 
be. Novi/ with Sensible Soft- 
ware's new graphics program, 
Graphics Department,'" you can 
do the graphic pizzazz yourself- 
faster than any graphics staff !

pie, bar, scatter, or line graphs 
from your tabular or Visicalc™ 
DIF files. Automatic labeling and 
direct loading from Visicalc™ 
help prevent errors and save 
time on multiple charts. Each 
graph may include up to 99 data 
points. You can even overlay 
multiple images. 

2 The lettering kit includes 20 
character fonts . . . from Old 
English to Bold Modern, from 
headlines and shadow effects to 
tiny text. You may letter anywhere 
on a HI-RES picture with 
complete control over character 
size, color and direction. 



3 The graphics tools module 
lets you "cut and paste;' overlay, 
merge, flip, shrink, invert, mask, 
change colors or add patterns. 
You can use these graphic tools 
to edit and combine charts, or 
even to create pictures from 
scratch. 

4 The slide projector com- 
bines your graphics into a profes- 
sional-looking presentation. You 
can move "slides" forward or 
backward with the game paddle 
or even automatically display

VENTURES WITH 
VISICAIjC 

BY )OE SHELTOn 



As you may know, VisiCorp announced VisiCalc Advanced Version 
for the Apple He at the National Computer Conference in May. This 
month, we'll examine the features that make Advanced Version a very 
useful addition to your software library. We'll discuss most of the new 
features as well as their use in template design. 

The Apple He. First a note about the He. Introduced in January of 
this year, the He brings a number of enhancements to the Apple II. For 
example, the He can be expanded to 128K of memory (from the maxi- 
mum of 64K on the Apple II). Like the Apple III, the lie provides a 
number of other features that make it perfect for VisiCalc. For example, 
it offers an eighty-column display (as an extra-cost option), meaning that 
you can have almost twice as many columns (and characters) displayed 
on-screen at once. In addition, the lie offers four directional arrow keys, 
allowing you to move throughout the spreadsheet easily without having 
to use the space bar to change cursor direction. 

If you use VisiCalc often, you know of some things you would like 
changed or features you would like added to make the program more 
useful. In the four years since the original VisiCalc appeared, hundreds of 
people have written VisiCorp requesting changes. Well, the folks in San 
Jose have been listening. Advanced Version incorporates almost every im- 
portant change that had been requested. In fact, short of simplifying the 
user interface, they left out only one major feature that was commonly 
requested: the ability to enter text across cell boundaries. 

VisiCalc Advanced Version's new features include variable column- 
width capability, new formatting options, a variety of new @ functions, 
keystroke memory, and some new print-formatting options. 

What You See. Perhaps the most common complaint against the 
original VisiCalc had to do with column widths. You couldn't vary col- 
umn widths in the original program (you could change column widths, 
but all the columns within a given window had to be of the same width). 
Since many templates require, or at least could benefit from, individual- 
ly adjustable column widths, this was a significant deficiency. Advanced 
Version has corrected the deficiency. 

In the new program you can set individual column widths to what- 
ever sizes you desire — from 1 to 125 characters per column. 

While the original VisiCalc contains a number of formatting com- 
mands (initiated with /F or /GF), many people recognized the need for 
still more. Advanced VisiCalc has answered this need and provided prac- 
tically every formatting option you can imagine. These new commands 
involve the setting of attributes. 

Advanced Version retains the original formatting options, thereby en- 
suring that templates developed on earlier versions of the program will 
still run. Any template developed on another Apple version of VisiCalc 
can be loaded into VisiCalc Advanced Version with no changes or 
problems. 

The reverse obviously isn't true. Because Advanced Version has many 
new features, templates developed on Advanced Version may not run on 
earlier versions. On the other hand, they may; it depends on what you 
have in the template. When VisiCalc loads a file, it beeps whenever it en- 
counters an error — an unknown command or function. It continues to 
load the template in such cases, however. You may find that your tem- 



plate has been loaded and works correctly, although the new Advanced 
Version features and functions won't be available. 

Attributes cover a number of other useful capabilities, in addition to 
providing formatting enhancements. By setting attributes appropriately 
you can now hide data, display the formulas (instead of their calculated 
results), control the kind of data that may be entered at designated cells, 
and ensure that certain entries will not be changed. You can also set up 
specific cells as tab stops; pressing the tab key moves the cursor from tab 
stop cell to tab stop cell. 

VisiCorp has added a new term to the VisiCalc vocabulary, gutters. 
This word comes from printing technology and refers to the left and right 
margins for text or values displayed in individual cells. 

Most of the attributes can be applied either to individual cells (with 
/A or to an entire window (with /GA). 

The attribute options are listed in table 1. 

What It Does. There isn't a plethora of new functions in Advanced 
Version, but what new ones there are can be extremely useful, especially

for certain kinds of financial analysis. 

The original version had only one financial function: net present 
value. Advanced Version offers six. 

Five of the six form an interrelated group. These are ©RATE, ©PE- 
RIODS, ©PMT, ©PV, and @FV; the last two of these stand for present 
value and future value respectively. To calculate any one of these func- 
tions, you specify three of the remaining four functions as arguments. 
For example, to calculate an interest rate, you enter the function 
©RATE followed by the number of periods; then you provide two of the 
remaining arguments — payment, present value, and future value. 

The sixth new financial function (©IRR) calculates internal rate of re- 
turn, based on an initial investment and a range of cash flows. 

Calendar Functions. Hand in hand with the new financial functions 
comes the facility to determine exactly how many years, months, or days 
there are between two dates. Advanced Version offers three groups of cal- 
endar functions. The first (@MDY) converts dates (in the format 
month,day,year) into the number of days elapsed since January 1, 1979. 
©VMDY does the same as ©MDY, with one exception. ©MDY al- 
lows negative values; it converts a —1 in the month field, for example, to 
November of the preceding year (a 0 would be translated into the pre- 
vious year's December). ©VMDY checks for valid data — that is, posi- 
tive numbers within appropriate boundaries. 

The second group of functions — ©DAY, ©MONTH, and 
©YEAR — do the inverse of the first group. They convert an absolute 
date into a calendar date. An absolute date is some number of days since 
(or before) the system's base date; January 1, 1979. 

The last group is similar to the first two but deals with hours, min- 
utes, and seconds. @HMS is similar to ©MDY, and ©HOUR, ©MIN- 
UTE, and ©SECOND are similar to the year, month, and day functions. 

Other Functions. There are a number of other new functions as well. 

©LABEL turns text into something that is treated as a value. In plain 
language, this means that an ©IF function can now display text as well 
as values. So a stock analysis template can now be constructed that will

display "Buy!" or "Sell!" rather than just numerically indicating some fi- 
nancial criteria. The ©LABEL function is also useful for report formats 
where you might require the same information in a variety of places in 
the same template. Instead of having to enter a date numerous times, for 
example, you can get by with entering it only once; ©LABEL will pick it 
up for you anywhere else in the sheet that you need it. 

©VALUE is similar to ©LABEL, but it guarantees that a function 
will return a value and not a label. 

©LCHOOSE is similar to ©CHOOSE, but it looks up a list of la- 
bels and displays the label corresponding to the value entered. 

©MOD is shorthand for the arithmetic term modulo; this function 
calculates the remainder after one value is divided by another. 

©DOTPROD calculates the sum of products of corresponding en- 
tries in two ranges. 

©ROUND permits you to round values to specified precisions. Posi- 
tive arguments in the function cause rounding to the right of the deci- 
mal, while negative arguments round to the left. 

How You Do It. There is just one new command (aside from attri- 
butes), but there have been important changes to five other commands. 
The differences are as follows. 

Keystroke memory (/K) is the same as on the Apple III version but 
is new to the Apple II VisiCalc. As we said a year ago, this may be a 
sleeper that will prove very useful as people learn what they can 
do with it. 

What can they do with it? Keystroke memory offers an easy way to 
automate things you do often, especially those activities that involve 
many separate steps. There are two methods of setting up a keystroke 
memory command. You can automatically record the steps as you ac- 
tually do them, or you can enter the steps much as you would if you 
were writing a program. The result is the same. Pressing three keys (con- 
trol-S and the specified alpha character) plays back all the steps you've 
recorded. The keystroke memory even offers the facility for inserting 
prompts, time delays, and more. 

There is a slight difference between the He and the III versions. The 
lie version uses control-S to begin execution of a keystroke memory se- 
quence, while the III version uses control-K. The reason for the differ- 
ence is that control-K generates a character that has a different function 
on the He and thus isn't available for use. 

VisiCorp touts keystroke memory as a way to simplify consolida- 
tions of different templates. In May 1982 we voiced our concern about 
the appropriateness of this method of consolidation. A year later, the 
same concern still exists. You must be fairly knowledgeable to be able to 
set up the templates for consolidation (see Ventures with VisiCalc, Sep- 
tember 1982, for more on consolidations). That isn't to say that it can't be 
very useful for consolidations. It is! It's just a bit more difficult than you 
might be led to believe. 

Keystroke memory can also be used for many other things. For ex- 
ample, you could use it to generate a simplified training program. You 
could set up versions of your templates and have keystroke memory au- 
tomatically explain how the templates work and how to operate them. 

Or you might program up to twenty-six different macros, each ac- 
complishing a different operation with only two keystrokes. You might 
have some keys defined for printing different areas, others for setting up 
specific displays with windows and titles, and so on. 

Printing. It's always been a pain to print templates in VisiCalc. If 
your template was larger than a single page, you had to print each sec- 
tion separately onto a different piece of paper. Advanced Version offers a 
number of printer options that format the printout and provide for the 
eventuality of templates larger than a single page. When you try to print 
a model larger than a single page, the program first prints the first page, 
does a form feed to get to the next page, then begins printing the second 
page, and so on. 

Sadly, the people who designed the program seem to have forgotten 
that not all of us use fan-folded paper. There's no way to stop continu- 
ous printing at the end of each page. If you don't have a continuous-feed 
printer, you'll still have to print your templates a page at a time. And 
even if your printer does handle fan-folded paper, if you want your tem- 
plate printed lengthwise on an 8 '/2-by-l I page, you'll sfill have to print 
each section manually.

Table 2. 



There's one additional glitch that's really a pain. You cannot set and 
then save the printer settings. That means that each time you boot Ad- 
vanced Version you have to reset the printer options manually in order to 
print. It would have been simple to allow you to save your printer set- 
tings in a master printer file or with each template. VisiCorp chose not to 
do so. 

Replication has always been one of the most useful and powerful Visi- 
Calc commands. But it had some weaknesses. The major problem was 
that you couldn't replicate blocks of cells. You had to replicate single 
rows or columns until you had completed replicating an entire block. 
Now you'll be able to replicate blocks as well. This can be very useful 
and timesaving. If your model requires a number of sections, you have 
only to complete a single section and then replicate it into as many other 
sections as you need. 

Replication can also be very useful for reorganizing a template. For 
example, suppose you have decided you want a section (block) located ir 
a different part of the template. Now you can effectively move it. Repli- 
cate the block to the new area, blank the original, and you have moved 



the section. The only thing you have to be careful about is ensuring that 
any formulas that reference into the original block are updated to refer- 
ence the new cell locations. 

In addition, you now have the option of replicating attributes only. 
Remember the time you completed a template and entered your data, 
only to realize that you should have set the dollar format in many of the 
cells? You had to go back and individually enter /F$ into all those cells, 
or replicate all the cells again with the new format. The new replicate 
command allows you to replicate attributes by themselves without af- 
fecting the cells' contents. 

Inserting and deleting rows and columns could be a laborious task if 
you had many to add or remove. You can now insert or delete more than 
one row or column at a time with a single command. All you have to do 
is specify how many columns or rows are involved. To add five rows to a 
template, for example, you hit /15R return. One word of warning: You 
have to be careful when deleting; once you've started a deletion, you lose 
all the rows or columns specified. If you delete too many, you'll have to 
reenter the information (or reload the template from disk if you've 
saved it). 

Clearing a model is now slightly more complicated than it used to be. 
You now have printer settings and keystroke memory to consider. There 
are times that you'll want to clear and load a new template without hav- 
ing to reenter printer settings or keystroke memory commands. /CY still 
clears all data, but in addition it clears both printer settings and key- 
stroke memory options. /CAY just resets the worksheet characteristics 
(printer options and so on), leaving the data alone. /CSY clears data and 
formats, while leaving keystroke memory and printer settings. 

Now you have some idea how powerful and useful the new features 
in VisiCalc Advanced Version are. Think about how they might be com- 
bined to give you more useful templates. Think about how you can print 
more professional-looking reports. Think about how much easier it can 
be to design, complete, and use templates. Take it from those who use it, 
VisiCalc Advanced Version is so powerful that you'll never go back to the 
standard version.

The Schoolhouse Apple 

by Jock Root 




Have you read Heinlein or van Vogt? They 
wrote some of the great science fiction of the 
golden age — the forties. Not space opera, like 
Star Wars, but serious stuff, food for thought. 
They're the kind of stories in which the hero 
might come across a sign like this, in the year 
2057 or so: 

A New Public Library Service 

Computers fill our everyday lives. We 
find them at the bank, the grocery store, 
and even at the library circulation desk. 
We need to become increasingly com- 
puter-literate as this electronic trend 
gains momentum. 

Toward this goal, many schools, in- 
cluding the Liverpool School District, 
have purchased microcomputers and de- 
veloped courses for their students. 

Our patrons now have access to a 
powerful microcomputer at no charge. 
Library-owned programs may be used, 
or patrons may write their own. 

To learn what the computer can do 
for you, read this brochure, then attend 
one of our orientation-validation ses- 
sions. Ask at the circulation desk for the 
current schedule. 

But this isn't science fiction; in 1983, it's 
fact: It appears on the cover of a brochure from 
the Liverpool Public Library in Liverpool, New 
York. The library has a 48K Bell & Howell 
Apple with a disk drive and a color television 
set as a monitor. People with valid library cards 
can use the system for up to two thirty-minute 
periods per week. 

There's a variety of software available for 
the system, including math, logic, and spelling 
skill games; simulation programs in science and 
history; a fantasy adventure game; and a course 
in Basic programming. You can bring work 
disks of your own or buy them from the library. 

Now the citizens of Liverpool have more ac- 
cess to an Apple than most of those who live in 
the Big Apple itself! 

ComputerTown. Another idea that could have 
come from a science-fiction story is actually 
doing quite nicely in the real worid. It's the 
ComputerTown concept. Science fiction has 
often favored the attitude that "if you need 
something, get together with your neighbors 
and create it"; and, if what your community 
wants is computer literacy, the ComputerTown 
approach sounds like a pleasant way to make it 
happen. 

The first ComputerTown was established in 
1979 in Menlo Park, California, by Bob Al- 
brecht and Ramon Zamora. The two were writ- 



ing books on elementary programming and 
wanted to learn something about the people 
they were writing for — computer beginners. So 
they took a computer to a local school and gave 
a demonstration class once a week. The stu- 
dents were fascinated and wanted to try using 
the computer themselves between demonstra- 
tions. Eventually, space was set aside in the 
Menlo Park Public Library, where several com- 
puters and a collection of software were made 
available by Zamora and Albrecht for use by 
the whole community. 

The demonstration classes were carried over 
into the new setting. At first they were held once 
a month; then, in response to growing demand 
and community participation, weekly classes 
were instituted. There were classes for both 
adults and children. The adult classes concen- 
trated on how to use the system as a convenient 
tool, while the classes for children emphasized 
the fun there can be in learning and thinking. 
There were also workshops and seminars in 
more advanced areas for experienced computer 
users. 

This public access computer literacy project 



was so successful that the National Science 
Foundation became interested in it and gave 
Zamora and Albrecht a grant to develop a de- 
tailed model of the Menlo Park project as a 
guide to other communities. The model has 
been described in the new book Computer- 
Town — A Do-It-Y ourself Community Computer 
Project from Reston Publishing Company. 

Many communities haven't waited for the 
book though. Working from eariier versions of 
the model, at least one hundred fifty Com- 
puterTown affiliates have sprung up in the 
United States and abroad, in the meantime, the 
original Menlo Park site has been used by more 
than ten thousand people. 

Zamora and Albrecht believe that this con- 
cept — and the increase of computer literacy in 
general — will have a profound effect on the 
structure of the educational process. More and 
more academic work will be done at home (the 
same fate others have predicted for various 
business activities), and the schoolroom experi- 
ence will focus on socialization training, exer- 
cise, and play. Sounds like science fiction again, 
doesn't it?

The Apple for a Teacher. We all know what a 
great entertainer the Apple is — with science fic- 
tion, fantasy, and arcade games too numerous 
to mention. It's easy to forget that the com- 
puter is a teacher even when it's playing games. 
Any game, even the simplest, requires some 
learning in order to play it and, in most of the 
interesting ones, the learning doesn't stop there. 
At the very least, there is logic and vocabulary 
training in the simulation and adventure games 
and psychomotor coordination training in the 
arcade games. 

Those elements will get to you, even if you 
aren't trying to learn from games, even if you 
actively avoid programs that are intended to 
teach: if you aren't trying to avoid them, just 
look and you'll find some very entertaining 
teaching games out there. There are simple drill 




programs in elementary math and English, 
intermediate-level programs that teach logical 
analysis and problem-solving, and adult pro- 
grams to cover the range from rote learning 
(such as touch-typing or foreign language vocab- 
ulary) to such complex intellectual behaviors as 
programming in Basic and playing chess. 

And there's another kind of teaching that 
happens around an Apple — teaching that has 
nothing to do with academic work. The ma- 
chine represents so much capability — so much 
computing power directly under the user's con- 
trol — that there is an inherent challenge to use it 
for something. 

In Seattle, for example, home of the Apple 
Pugetsound Program Library Exchange, or 
A.P.P.L.E., for short, all kinds of remarkable 
things are happening. At Lakeside, a private 



AUGUST 1983 

school in the area, some four hundred students 
share nine personal computer workstations. 
Some of the students have gotten together to de- 
sign and program a computer dating service for 
the student community. 

At another school in the area, Interlake 
High School in Bellevue, students are not only 
writing their own software, they're building 
hardware as well, out of surplus components. 
They're working on a system in which one com- 
puter directs another by means of a walkie- 
talkie radio link, and the second computer con- 
trols a robot. 

The teacher of these students, Tom Facken- 
thall, introduced his own son to the art of pro- 
gramming at the age of four, with questions 
like, "Can you make your name walk across the 
screen?" "Can you make your name flash?" 
"Can you make your name come in on one side 
and your mother's on the other?" His daugh- 
ter, who is eleven, prefers to use the system for 
graphic design: greeting cards, gift wrapping, 
and art for art's sake. 

The power is there in the machine, waiting 
to be used, and the challenge is almost irresis- 
tible. Of course, using it means learning the 
rituals that control its power; but, once you've 
been beguiled by a taste of it, the motivation — 
to have all that power under your command — is 
strong enough to overcome almost any 
obstacle. 

Right, then: The Apple teaches very well all 
by itself (or with a game program or two), and 
in a well-thought-out community project it can 
teach even better. But how is it doing in the 
schools? Not very well, for two reasons: First, 
there just aren't enough machines available. 
Second, teachers haven't had a chance to learn 
all they need about the machines. 

Computers at School. The Center for So- 
cial Organization of Schools at Johns Hopkins 
University publishes a newsletter called "School 
Uses of Microcomputers," a series of reports 
from a national survey of schools with micro- 
computers. The organization's June issue ex- 
plores how much these systems are actually 
used and for what. 

What's immediately obvious from reading 
the report is that there aren't enough com- 
puters available. Even at schools that have com- 
puters, only about one student in seven gets a 
chance to work with them; and that one doesn't 
get much time — typically around twenty min- 
utes a week in elementary schools and about 
forty-five minutes in secondary schools. 

In elementary schools, about 40 percent of 
students' computer time is spent on drill and 
practice programs in math, spelling, vocabu- 
lary, and the like. Another 20 percent goes 
into games, including learning games. There 
may be some confusion about terms here, since 
the report does not make clear which category an 
entertaining, game-style drill program would 
fall into. The remaining 40 percent of students' 
computer time is spent learning Basic, graph- 
ics, and other computer literacy skills. 

In secondary schools, the picture is some- 
what different. Only about a quarter of the 
computer time used by these students goes into 
drill and practice — and that includes the learn-

ing games as well. About half of students' time 
goes into computer literacy work, and the rest 
into more specialized uses, such as word proc- 
essing, science lab assignments, business course 
work, and the like. 

One of the interesting sidelights this report 
mentions is that relatively few teachers are fa- 
miliar with microcomputers: In about half the 
schools with such systems, only one or two 
teachers use them regularly. This tends to limit 
the amount of use the system gets; some 10 per- 
cent of the schools use their computers for only 
an hour a day or less. 

The Microcomputers in Education In- 
stitute. The answer is obvious: Teachers need 
better opportunities to develop their own com- 
puter literacy; only then can they lead others to 
it. A large step in the right direction is the Stan- 
ford Institute on Microcomputers in Educa- 
tion, which offered in June and July its inten- 
sive five-week course. 

Mornings were devoted to intensive study 
and supervised lab work. After a week of tu- 
tored lessons in word processing, CAl evalua- 
tion, Basic, and applications programs, the at- 
tendees worked on individual or team projects 
involving software design, practice with lan- 
guages and word processing, commercial soft- 
ware evaluation, and curriculum and proposal 
writing. 

Early afternoons were devoted to equip- 
ment demonstrations, field trips to Bay Area 
computer sites, lectures by local specialists, and 
the like. 



Best of all, the institute provided supervised 
computer work time for three hours each day, 
with more time available by appointment. Talk 
about access! 

And, as if all that weren't good enough, this 
year there was also a scholarship fund specifi- 
cally targeted to those who teach subjects other 
than math or science. Jeff Levinsky, codirector 
of the institute, points out that computers have 
many exciting uses in other areas of the school. 
"But once they start in the math department, 
it's hard to get them out. Therefore it's impor- 
tant for other teachers to learn about the new 
technology." 

Science Resources. If you're a teacher try- 
ing to make the best use of your school's new 
micro system, computer literacy isn't all you 
need. You also need information about avail- 
able software. Drill programs in simple arith- 
metic and English skills are easy to find, but 
where do you look for programs in simple 
physics and chemistry? 

For chemistry, you might check with Proj- 
ect Seraphim. Sponsored by the National Sci- 
ence Foundation— Development in Science 
Education, this group has aims to develop 
modular instructional materials for chemistry; 
this is to help teachers learn the uses of micro- 
computers in chemical education and to en- 
courage the development of utility programs 
that will make the writing of software easier. 

Project Seraphim has compiled a list of 
available software in chemistry, listing about 
one hundred twenty programs from both com- 



mercial and noncommercial sources. The list 
gives a brief description of the program and its 
requirements: information on type of comput- 
er, subdiscipline of chemistry, specific hard- 
ware requirements, author's name, supplier, 
and cost. The list will be updated quarterly with 
new programs and modifications to existing 
programs. 

The group also writes its own software. Its 
catalog includes a variety of information mod- 
ules (information about sources, techniques, 
and so on), review modules (detailed user re- 
views of instructional programs), and software 
modules (for Apple, Pet, IBM pc, and TRS-80). 

Project Seraphim also holds workshops and 
symposiums and serves as a clearing-house for 
information on the uses of microcomputers in 
the teaching of chemistry. 

If you teach a science other than chemistry, 
you might want to get a look at the Cambridge 
Development Laboratory catalog. This group 
handles software from a variety of sources, 
covering mathematics and statistics, earth sci- 
ence, biology /ecology, chemistry, astron- 
omy/space science, and physics. The catalog 
gives you essentially the same information 
about each entry as Seraphim's does — with the 
addition, in most cases, of a typical screen dis- 
play from the program. 

The catalog also offers various hardware de- 
vices, including instrumentation interfaces for 
various sensors, the sensors themselves (light, 
temperature, pH, angular motion, and volt- 
age), serial and parallel interface cards, and 
other equipment. 

And then there's Queue, which claims to be 
the oldest distributor of educational software in 
the world, having published its first catalog in 
January 1980. Queue now has three different 
catalogs in print and it also publishes a monthly 
magazine. 

The magazine Microcomputers in Education 
contains news, several different types of soft- 
ware reviews, and announcements of new items 
added to the catalog. 

Teachers' User Groups. When you start on 
a new adventure — such as trying to gain com- 
puter literacy — it's nice to have the company of 
colleagues as hesitant and wondering as your- 
self. A number of newsletters from various uni- 
versities and associations are cropping up in 
which teachers can share their experiences. 
Many of them also have reviews and discus- 
sions of software, make announcements of 
workshops and training sessions, and offer sim- 
ple technical advice. 

Consider, for example, On Wisconsin Com- 
puting, from the Wisconsin Center for Educa- 
tion Research. The May issue starts off with an 
editorial in which the editor describes her visit 
to several software makers in the Silicon Val- 
ley. Then a speech and language clinician de- 
scribes in detail the reactions of groups of three- 
year-olds, four-year-olds, and five-year-olds to 
the Xerox programs Stickybear Numbers and 
Stickybear ABC. 

There are also various computer-related 
news items, a piece on using a microcomputer 
with preschool children, tips on fioppy disk

Another useful publication is Users, the 
MECC Instructional Computing Newsletter 
(MECC is an acronym for Minnesota Educa- 
tional Computing Consortium). This is shorter 
than the Wisconsin Center's and it has no edi- 
torial matter, but it does have several news 
items, announcements of instructional events, 
and a catalog of available courseware. There's 
also an announcement of a series of courseware 
in computer literacy. 

Perhaps the most interesting item in the is- 
sue is the announcement of a contest. The grand 
prize is an Apple He, with disk drive and moni- 
tor, donated by Apple. It's a software-design 
contest, but you don't have to know program- 
ming in order to enter. You do have to be an 
educator, though. 

The goal is to design a new piece of course- 
ware for classroom use, but you don't have to 
write the program. The announcement says, 
"Entrants will submit the design of a course- 
ware product as described in written narrative 
and screen layout sheets. The result will be po- 
tential products that could be programmed by 
others. This allows a wider variety of educators 
to enter, since programming skills are not 
required." 

A contest-entry packet containing a full ex- 
planation of the rules (including information on 
the courseware development process and sam- 
ple screen layout sheets) can be obtained from 
MECC. 

Scholarly Evaluation. So how are we doing 
as a culture in terms of computer literacy? Not 
too well, yet. But that's not surprising, and it's 
probably only temporary. It's a high threshold 
we're aiming for — a whole new way of thinking 
is required — and not many of us have access to 
the necessary equipment. 

But that's changing. The equipment pool is 
slowly growing, helped along by such things as 
Apple's offer to give a He system free to nearly 
every school in California (and nearly every 
school in the country, if Congress can work out 
the details); and, at the same time, we are learn- 
ing how to help teachers over that threshold. 

Just give us a couple of years. ...

Few of the games written to use the Apple II game paddles will run 
on the Apple III in Emulation mode. The reason for this unfortunate 
situation is that the hardware in the Apple III requires very different soft- 
ware to read the paddles. Games that use the Monitor subroutine at 
SFBIE work on both machines, but many games contain their own rou- 
tines that work only with the Apple II paddles. This article presents 
changes in the Emulation Monitor and a technique for altering games so 
they will work on the Apple III. 

The previous article in this series described the organization of the 
Emulation disk and presented the Trackmover utihty program to assist 
with alterations of the Emulation disk. The Trackmover or another disk 
zap utility will be needed to modify the Emulation program and some of 
the games. 

The software solution to the game problem involves substantial mod- 
ifications of the Apple II Monitor supplied on the Emulation disk. It al- 



so requires that you locate and change the routines in the games that 
read the paddles. This sounds formidable at first, but the tools in this ar- 
ticle will allow you to convert a typical game in just a few minutes. 

There is a catch, however. You must be able to modify the binary game 
file on the disk, which means that you can fix only those games that are 
available as DOS files. Some copy-protected games can be modified. The 
game file of many recent games is a normal DOS 3.2 or 3.3 file, even 
though the disk is copy-protected. The game file can be copied to 
another disk and modified as described here. You can often then run the 
game if you bload the modified game file, insert the original master disk 
in the drive, and then start the game with a call to the first address in the 
game file. It helps if the copy of the game file occupies the same tracks 
and sectors on the disk as the original, so the disk head is in the same po- 
sition after the game is loaded from either disk. 

In many, perhaps most, cases where the game file is a normal DOS 



start Hair Injim! 



file, the protection scheme won't balk if you modify the original disk us- 
ing a track/ sector editor. Of course, attempting to modify an original 
master that is so well protected that you can't make a backup is a fairly 
high-stakes computer game. Don't try it unless you are willing to accept 
some losses. 

Here's an outline of the process we'll use to make games run on the 
Emulation Apple: 

1 . Revise the Monitor program so that the paddle initialization is 
done in subroutines. 

2. Replace paddle initialization instructions (LDA $C070) in the 
game with calls to the appropriate subroutine. 

3. Replace paddle test instructions, usually LDA $C064 or LDA 
$C065, with LDA $C066. 

In many games only four bytes need to be changed. 

Paddle Reading and Monitor Modifications. Let's look at the sub- 



routines that read the paddles. Listing 1 is the paddle-reading subroutine 
from the Apple II Monitor. Listing 2 is the paddle-reading routine fur- 
nished on the Emulation disk. The substantially longer Apple III rou- 
tine is broken into two pieces to preserve parts of the Monitor that other 
programs will likely use. There is space for this long routine because the 
omission of cassette tape routines leaves about one hundred unused bytes 
in the Monitor. These free bytes allow numerous interesting modifica- 
tions of the Emulation Apple. 

To a calling program, the two subroutines are functionally identical. 
The paddle number is in the X register when the subroutine is called. The 
paddle value is in the Y register, with the X register unchanged, on re- 
turn from the subroutine. 

The first, and largest, part of the Apple III routine is devoted to pad- 
dle selection. Commands must be given to select one of eight inputs to 
the analog-to-digital converter (A/D). The selection requires reference to 



90 



AUGUST 1983 



one member of each of three pairs of memory addresses. Figure 1 sum- 
marizes the selection rules. 

After the paddle has been selected, the operating principle of the Ap- 
ple III routine is the same as that of the Apple II routine. Why is it so 
much more complicated? Apple decided that the reference voltage re- 
quired to yield a paddle output of 255 (or $FF) should be 2.4 volts. That de- 
cision is based on joysticks that use 20 percent of the total potentiometer 
rotation for full joystick deflection. If the joystick is connected to 12 
volts, 20 percent of the range yields a maximum output of 2.4 volts. If

the Apple II counting routine is used, it requires about 2.55 volts' input 
to reach the full output value. The loop used in the Apple III remedies 
this problem by effectively counting only half-range and then doubling 
the output. 

It is easy to fix a paddle or joystick so that its full range is about 2.6 
volts, and it will work with the standard counting software. You can 
build a very nice paddle from scratch for about ten dollars. Directions 
for modifying the Cursor III joystick are given with figure 2. 

Achieving simplicity in game alterations requires the rebuilding of the 
paddle software in the Monitor. DOS Tool Kit assembly listings of the 
four Monitor patches are given in listings 3 through 6 at the end of this 
article. Assemble the four routines and use the Trackmover program to 
install them as described in the following paragraphs. 

Start with a copy of an Emulation disk that already has the modified 
reset vector described last month. Otherwise, make that modification 
along with those described in this article. Load track 5 into memory at 
address $5000, then exit to Basic and load the patch routines as follows: 

BLOAD MONFIX1.OBJ0,A$561E 
BLOAD MONFIX2.OBJ0,A$57C9

Listing 2. Paddle-reading subroutine from the Emulation Monitor. 



Figure 2. Modifying the Cursor III joystick for Apple II Emulation. The circuit of 
the Cursor III joystick is identical to that shown on page 130 of the Owner's 
Guide, using 2.5K potentiometers. Adding two 6.8K, 0.25 W resistors as 
shown will increase the maximum output voltage to about 2.6V for use with 
software that mimics the Apple II routines. 

The Apple II uses a left-handed X-Y coordinate system for its screen dis- 
play convention; the Apple III is right-handed. As a result no orientation of 
Cursor III is right for Apple II joystick applications. To fix this, interchange the 
connections at the two ends of one of the potentiometers. You will then have 
to recenter the joystick control. Loosen the set screw and take the joystick as- 
sembly off of the potentiometer shaft. Rotate the shaft until a simple Apple- 
soft program indicates that the paddle value is about 128. Then reassemble 
the joystick. Getting the control centered properly with everything assem- 
bled and the set screw tight takes some patience.

It will be easier to modify track 9 if you save the entire modified por- 
tion of the Monitor as a single file: 

BSAVE MONMOD,A$5600,L$500 

Use the Trackmover to restore the $5000 address block to track 5 on 
the disk and then load track 9 into the $5000 block. Now bload 
Monmod,A$5100 and restore track 9 to the modified Emulation disk. 

The Monitor modifications separate paddle selection and the A/D 
conversion timing so that the paddle selection is performed by subrou- 
tines. The assembly instructions to call these subroutines are: 



paddle 0 select 
paddle 1 select 
paddle 2 select 
paddle 3 select

There are two multipaddle subroutines. The standard paddle-read- 
ing routine at $FB1E accepts a paddle number in the X register and re- 
turns the resulting value in the Y register. This subroutine is used by Ba- 
sic and many games. A comparable, alternative subroutine at $FEFE 
samples paddle 2 when paddle 1 is requested and vice versa. This allows 
use of a joystick that is plugged into port A (paddles 0 and 2) without 
modifying anything except the address of the subroutine call and the 
paddle 1 firing-button check. 

Game Modification. The typical arcade game has a built-in paddle 
routine that is nearly identical to the one in the Apple II Monitor. Some- 
times, though, there are changes designed to limit the numerical range of 
the output values. Here is an example taken from a game with a non- 
standard routine to read paddle 0. The example also shows the changes 
you must make to fix the game so that it will read the Apple III paddles, 
using the modified Monitor. The memory contents are shown for the 
two modified instructions.

Game conversion to run with the revised Monitor requires locating 
the paddle routines in the game, a little disassembly to be sure that the 
paddle reading isn't too convoluted, and modification of just a few bytes, 
as illustrated above. In many cases, the whole procedure can be com- 
pleted in five minutes or so. There are a few hopeless cases in which a sin- 
gle LDA $C070 instruction initiates an interlaced set of instructions to 
read two or more paddles. 

To fix a game so that it will run on the Apple III, you will have to lo- 
cate the paddle-reading routines, make changes as previously shown, and 
save the modified game on the disk. The DOS bsave command balks at 
files larger than 32,767 bytes (129 sectors on the disk). If the game file is 
smaller, just bload Game,A$1000 from the Monitor. Then check the 
length of the file. The low-order byte of the length is in $AA60 after the 
load; the high-order byte is in $AA61. You will need this information to 
save the file after you have fixed it. 

After the file is in memory, you have to find all the instances of LDA 
$C070 or BIT $CO70 instructions to find all the places where the game 
needs to be changed. There are utility programs (such as The Inspector, 
by Omega Microware) that have built-in memory and disk-search 
features. 

If you don't have one of these, the program given in listing 7 will do 
the job for you. It loads into the page-three area that is universally used 
for small assembly language routines. After it is loaded, type 300G from 



the Monitor to link it to the Monitor control-Y instruction. Memory ad- 
dress $00 contains the number of bytes in the pattern to be located, and 
the pattern is loaded into memory beginning at $01. Limit patterns to 
nine bytes or less to avoid destroying important zero-page locations. On 
a practical basis, a three-byte pattern almost always yields just a few lo- 
cations. To find all of the LDA $C070 instructions in the memory range 
from $1(X30 to $90FF, enter this from within the Monitor. 

0:3 AD 70 CO 
1000.9000 control-Y 

The address of the $AD byte for each paddle routine in the address 
range will be printed on-screen after you type return. Disassemble the 
paddle routine in each location to be sure what is going on. An LDA 
$C064 instruction, as shown in the example just given, indicates paddle 0. 
Similarly, LDA $C065 indicates paddle 1. Replace the LDA $C070 in- 
struction with a JSR instruction to initialize the appropriate paddle. Al- 
so, replace LDA $C06Ar with LDA $C066. 

If you have a joystick with connections only to a single joystick port, 
then you will want to use paddle 0 and paddle 2 where the normal Apple 
II organization uses paddles 0 and 1. If the two paddle roufines are inde- 
pendent, then use JSR $FF17 in place of the LDA $C070 that starts the 
paddle 1 read in the game. You will also have to change the firing-but- 
ton commands to use buttons 0 and 2. Button 1 is read by LDA $C062; 
change it to LDA $C063 for the paddle 2 button. 

Many games using joysticks employ the Monitor routine at $FB1E 
to read them. These games run without modification if you can connect 
your joystick to the normal paddle 0 and 1 combination. The Monitor 
patches include an option that interchanges the logical paddle 1 and pad- 
dle 2 assignments. Change JSR $FB1E in the game to JSR $FEFE to 
perform the swap. The normal subroutine, at $FB1E, could be changed 
to the swapped configuration quite easily, but this isn't a universal solu- 
tion. Game conversion often would still require changing the firing-but- 
ton commands. 

Because of the file-length limitaUon with the DOS bsave command, 
extremely long game files must be searched in pieces to find all of the 
paddle routines. The Trackmover program presented in part 1 of this se- 
ries can be used to assist in this search. Initialize a DOS disk with a mini- 
mum hello file and then transfer the game program to it, using Apple's 
FID or another disk utility. DOS stores programs on a newly initialized 
disk in consecutive tracks and sectors. You can expect to find the hello 
program on track $12 and the first track/ sector list for your game on 
track $13, sector $F. The track allocation continues with tracks $3 
through $A. In spite of the fact that DOS is quite consistent, it's a good 
idea to find and check the track/sector lists to determine exactly what 
part of the disk contains your program. The catalog entry, with a point- 
er to the track/sector list, is on track $11, sector $F, if the game is the sec- 
ond program recorded after initializing the disk. Both the DOS 3.3 man- 
ual and Beneath Apple DOS, by Don Worth and Pieter Lechner, pro- 
vide guides to the interpretation of catalog entries and track/sector lists. 

Use the Trackmover program to load seven program tracks into the 
memory range $1000-$7FFF. Each track will be loaded in its proper 
memory order if you change two program lines in Trackmover. 



2140 8(1) = 
2160 S(16) 



15 

= 0 



Use the pattern-location program to find the paddle-control rou- 
tines. Modify the paddle control with the Monitor or the Miniassem- 
bler, and then use the Trackmover to save the modified portions back to 
the same place on the disk. Continue with the remaining tracks that con- 
tain portions of the game program until you are sure that you have lo- 
cated and modified all of the paddle-control routines. Few games have 
more than two paddle control routines. 

Next month, we'll go into the workings of the Emulation program it- 
self, including the instructions that set up the Emulation mode. Study of 
the details of the Emulation program makes possible useful modifica- 
tions, such as the reading and display of lower-case characters. It also 
makes possible more exotic Emulation Apples, if the machine-control 
register setup is different from that furnished on the Emulation disk. 
Meanwhile, try modifying some games to work on the Apple III. You'll 
find that the conversion is an enjoyable and rewarding challenge.

August Rodin's portrayal of man as The 
Thinker presents us with a most striking image 
of our condition. Solitary, rapt in thought, the 
figure is in active concentration, with every 
muscle held taut. What exactly is he thinking 
about? Perhaps he's trying to figure out how to 
afford to send his kids to college; or maybe he's 
trying to decide whether El Salvador is becom- 
ing another Vietnam; or could he be contem- 
plating a solution to that sticky programming 
problem that's been keeping him up nights? 

It's the hallmark of all great art to spark 
such imaginings, allowing us to find a bit of 
ourselves in the artist's conception. But what if 
a machine, say a robot, possessing a highly de- 
veloped form of artificial intelligence, could 
produce a representation of itself in a work 
of art? 

That's one thought that may have struck 
Softalk readers back in 1981 when they saw the 
August issue. The cover was an airbrush ren- 
dering of a metallic-skinned robot in the same 
position as Rodin's thinking man. The figure 
sat gazing at a familiar-looking rainbow- 
colored apple in its hand, presumably contem- 
plating a byte. The image set the tone for Sof- 
talk\ first feature on robotics. 



Artist Robert Zraick had always been fas- 
cinated with robots. In 1981, he had just pur- 
chased an Apple when he happened upon the 
Softalk office. A new subscriber, he recognized 
the name on the door and introduced himself. 
This meeting led to the commission of the 
cover. The idea for the picture came to him in a 
fiash one day, he says, as he stood on the side- 
walk right outside Softalk"?, front door. 

This kind of spontaneous inspiration came 
as no surprise to Zraick. It's something he'd 
come to rely on, and it's often helped to carry 
him through the various pursuits he's explored 
in developing a unique career, a fascinating col- 
lage of his talents. 

Contemplating an Artist's Career. 
Schooled as a commercial artist, Zraick made a 
good living for himself designing logos, promo- 
tional campaigns for books, and the like. Zraick 
admits feeling at first the way many artists do 
about computers — he hated them, or rather he 
misunderstood them. To him, computers were 
just glorified calculators, and whoever heard of 
using a calculator as an artistic tool? Such ma- 
chines are only of value to accountants and the 
like. So he thought until the time he encoun- 
tered an Apple. 



BY TOnnV CEAR 



Possessed with a flair for the theater, Zraick 
was seduced by the smell of grease paint and the 
feel of sawdust underfoot. In the early 1970s he 
matriculated in that hallowed institution known 
as Clown College. Upon graduation he joined 
the Ringling Bros. & Barnum and Bailey Cir- 
cus, and for two seasons clowned around the 
country professionally. Along the way, Zraick 
refined his skills in another of the entertain- 
ment arts — magic — and also learned to create 




fantastic masks and movable forms from 
sculpted plasfic. This experience paid off when 
he said farewell to the big top and found him- 
self seeking work in Hollywood. 

There, in the employ of Universal Studios, 
Zraick's fascination with robots blossomed 
when he was made project director for the 
studio tour's Battlestar Galactica attracfion in 
1979. It was his responsibility to supervise the 
entire production, which combines live action, 
music, audioanimatronic robots and monsters, 
lasers, and other special effects in an action- 
packed scenario. The finished show repeats 
every few minutes for the steady stream of tour- 
ists visiting the studio lot. The whole spectacle is 
controlled by a set of EPROMs that were pro- 
grammed on none other than an Apple. From 




Framed above Robert Zraick's Apple is the original art he created for the cover of Softalk's August 
1981 issue. An avid robot enthusiast and RobotWar game player, Zraick is joined by a few friends.

The artist exhibits an intimate knowledge of Yorick, under the luminous gaze of another, less savory character. Both figures were sculpted in plastic by 
Zraick and painted. The hideous bust is that of the Imperious Leader from the Universal Studios Tour's BaWestar Galactica attraction. 




Opposite page and above, from left to right: Four views, from bare-bones machinery to full raiment, of two robotic protagonists that have been programmed, 
by the usually benign Apple, to visually and aurally assault visitors touring Universal Studios. 



this initial encounter, any prejudice he'd had 
against computers evaporated as Zraictc's quick 
mind drew the analogy between the way of art 
and the way of computers. 

"The potential of computers is just like that 
of art; it goes as far as a human being's poten- 
tial. The only limitations," he now believes, "are 
those set by the operator himself." 

Having made this essential connection, it 
wasn't long before Zraick purchased his own 
Apple and found himself airbrushing that cover 
illustration of the musing robot. Today, with 
the formation of his own company, Zraphic 
Arts, Zraick offers his services as a free-lance 



designer and special-effects consultant to clients 
that include a satellite-communications com- 
pany, the McDonald's hamburger chain, and 
7-Eleven food stores. 

Zraick is also in the process of writing cus- 
tom software on his Apple. In conjunction with 
a nonprofit corporation called ACTS and friend 
Randi Erins, he is exploring the development of 
a software-based alternative cancer therapy sys- 
tem. In the past he has used the Alf music 
boards. Echo speech synthesizer, and the 
KoalaPad Touch Tablet to create entertaining 
musical animations for his own pleasure. Now 
he wants to write programs that will bring 



pleasure to others and encourage their natural 
self-healing potentials. 

Most recently, Zraick contributed his tal- 
ents as monster-mask maker to the soon-to-be- 
released movie version of Kurt Vonnegut's best- 
selling book Slapstick. 

As a man full of plans, Robert Zraick has 
learned to plot his strategies well. He'd be the 
first to claim that his expertise in planning, as 
well as programming, is due at least in part to 
the time he has spent playing his favorite game. 
Robot War. The engrossing strategy of the game 
of battling robots appealed to Zraick's inquir- 
ing mind as much as its robot theme did.

AUGUST 1983 




Silas Warner, Muse Software cofounder and programmer of thie strategy-learning game RobotWar, 
believes that the best strategy for his company lies in the diversification of its software products to run 
on a variety of microcomputers. Right: RobotWar tournament organizer Frank Krogh publishes a 
newsletter detailing the robot bouts that occur regularly and invites all players seeking a challenge to 
join in the fun. 



A Game and Its Muse. The uniqueness of 
Muse Software's RobotWar lies in the fact that, 
in planning your robot's battle strategy, you be- 
come adept with programming concepts and 
logical thinking. It was this game concept, still 
ahead of its time, that precipitated Softalk's 
.spotlighting Muse in an Exec feature in Feb- 
ruary 1982. Both RobotWar and another of the 
company's game offerings, Castle Wolfenstein, 
had been in dominant positions on the best- 
seller list throughout the second half of 1981. 
Muse's word processor, Super-Text, continues 
to flirt with the elite. 

Since that time, the company has released 
Caverns of Freitag, another game, and has up- 
dated all its Apple offerings to be He-com- 
patible. Muse's current efforts, says cofounder 
and programmer Silas Warner, reflect the im- 
portance he attributes to the development of a 
viable sales policy emphasizing mass merchan- 
dising. Warner believes that the specialized 
computer store will come to play a less promi- 
nent role as a marketing outlet in the future and 
that more and more people will come to buy 
their micros through department store chains 



and the like. As a result. Muse has been diver- 
sifying over the last year and a half, developing 
versions of its previously released programs to 
run on the IBM pc. Commodore, and Atari 
computers. 

But the Apple market hasn't been for- 
gotten. Two new offerings from Muse are ex- 
pected late this summer. One, a strategy game 
called Titan Empire, was written by Muse 
founder and Super-Text author Ed Zaron. The 
game pits the player against eight enemy ships 
in a battle for control of the solar system — with 
a twist: Players must take into account the 
orbits of the planets being defended. The other 
new package. Eating Machine, developed by nu- 
tritionist/programmer Barbara Thome, is an 
easy-to-use diet and nutrition program. Keep- 
ing track of an individual's dietary habits over 
time in six nutritional categories, the software 
also analyzes the ingredients of the user's fa- 
vorite dishes. 

Krogh Wars. One gentleman who speaks 
highly of Muse is Frank Krogh, a RobotWar (a- 
natic of Reseda, California. ?xt-RobotWar, 
Krogh graced So/talk's October 1980 issue in a 



story about an invention he had devised to fa- 
cilitate loading data into the Apple from cas- 
sette tape. By the time RobotWar appeared, 
Krogh had moved up to disk. Since then, he has 
been carrying the torch along with other Ro- 
botWar players who desire the competition and 
challenge of pitting robot against robot in a 
tournament setting. 

On the local front, Krogh credits Rainbow 
Computing in Northridge, California, for con- 
tinued support in providing an ongoing setting 
for the tournament. There's also a m.onthly post- 
al tournament organized by Krogh that will 
culminate in a national championship. En- 
trants send him the code for their robot combat- 
ants on disk. He runs the various robots 
through their battle paces, and each participant 
receives a full report on the competition and the 
champion robot. It's a chance for seasoned 
RobotWar aficionados and fledgling players to 
test their programming prowess. 

As long as there are guys like Frank Krogh, 
whose contagious enthusiasm for a game keeps 




interest in it alive, companies like Muse 
Software will continue to produce the fun and 
challenge that merits dubbing a game classic. 
And with more and more creative people from 
all disciplines, like Robert Zraick, unlearning 
their prejudices against "those glorified calcu- 
lators," a new generation of artists gleams on 
the horizon. No doubt that gleam will come in 
part from the metallic encasements of robotic 
companions that will be standing at our sides, 
joining us not only in contemplation of a byte, 
but in the creation of a world better suited for 
the men living in it, as well as the machines. 

Next time in Backtalk, we'll get down to 
business and reflect on a company whose name 
has become a mere footnote in the microcom- 
puter history books — Personal Software.

Let's face it. A big reason people buy personal computers is so they 
can play games. Lots of times people will tell you, "Yeah, I keep home 
records on it, do my finances, keep addresses, do business accounting on 
it, and I get a good tax write-off. Play games? Gee, I suppose I can do 
that, too." 

What they really mean is, "I spent almost four hours working on my 
high score, but then the kids wanted to play Zork, so I let them on it 
awhile. One of these days, I'll get around to putting the family budget on 
it." Okay, so your own situation might not be that extreme. But games 
do spend a lot of time on those computer screens, and most of the time 
they're displayed using computer graphics. 

Games certainly aren't the only place where graphics are used. Busi- 
ness programs depict earnings and expenses in the form of charts. Edu- 
cational programs use colorful graphics to make learning seem like a 
game. There is even computer art: graphics for its own sake. 

Whatever the application, graphics is one of the things computers 
create that many of us would have a hard time creating by other means. 

There are two main graphics modes in which the computer does its 
stuff: low-resolution (lo-res) and high-resolution (hi-res). Resolution sim- 
ply means image definition. With a high resolution, a picture can have 
smoother curves and greater detail than with a lower resolution. In the 
real world, there are many possible degrees of resolution. 

When you look at a photograph in the newspaper, it appears finely 
detailed. But if you section off a small piece of it and enlarge it to the size 
of the original picture, the resolution isn't as clear; it loses detail, and you 
can see that it's nothing more than a bunch of dots. That's what lo-res is 
like, and that's what we'll look at first. 

Jump Right In. Getting into the lo-res mode on the Apple involves 
nothing more than a few keystrokes. Assuming you're in text mode, just 
type gr, which stands for "graphics." You'll see the screen wipe itself 
clean and the prompt and cursor appear at the bottom of the screen. This 
is kind of like erasing words written on a blackboard in order to draw a 
picture in the same place. 

Now that we're in graphics mode, what can we do? Well, to be hon- 
est, not much. We can put colored blocks on the screen, change colors, 
and that's about it, unless we learn to program. For many of us, learn- 
ing to write programs will come soon enough. For now, we'll just try to 
understand how things work. 

Once you're in graphics mode, type color=2 and hit the return key. 
Next, type plot 20,30. Bingo, a purple block appears. Let's take a look at 
what happened. 

Typing color=2 lets the Apple know that whatever it puts on the 
screen, not including text characters, will be dark blue. In lo-res-graphics 
mode, you get your choice of sixteen colors, and in typical computer 
fashion they're numbered from 0 to 15. On the Sample Programs disk 



that comes with the Apple He, there's a program called Color Test (Col- 
or Demosoft on the System Master for II Plus fans). One of the items on 
the menu is called "Standard Color Names." This one displays the six- 
teen colors and their names; the item "Standard Color Numbers" dis- 
plays the colors and their corresponding numbers. 

When you type plot 20.30 you're telling the Apple to put a block of 
whatever color you've chosen onto the middle of the screen. The lo-res 
screen is divided into a grid 40 blocks wide by 48 blocks in length. Also in 
computer style, these blocks are numbered from 0 to 39 and 0 to 47. 

If you remember back to school days, pairs of numbers like 20,30 are 
known as Cartesian coordinates (after the philosopher, wonderful man, 
and almost personal friend Rene Descartes), but that's not too impor- 
tant. What is important is that these numbers represent a point on the 
screen in a way that's so simple, it's insulting. 

The first number, 20, means column number 20; the second number, 
30, means row number 30. They do not mean the twentieth column and 
thirtieth row (we began numbering with zero, remember?). So actually, 
column 0 is the first column, column 1 is the second column, and so on. 
If you wanted to plot a block on the far right-hand side, you would type 
plot 39, X, where 39 is the far right column and X is the row number. 

Nothing's True All the Time. Let's backtrack for a moment. We said 
that the screen is 48 blocks in length, but, just like a lot of things in this 
business, that's not entirely true. If you try to plot any points in rows 40 
through 47, well, just try it. Here are some: 

PLOT 10,44 
PLOT 22,45 
PLOT 30,47 

You don't get a color as you did in the other rows; what you get is a 
quotation mark, and you probably noticed that it scrolls up the screen 
and disappears like the rest of any text you type. That's because the bot- 
tom part of the lo-res screen is reserved for text material. It holds four 
lines of text, or eight rows of graphic blocks. 

By now, if you've been plotting things left and right and up and 
down, you probably have a screen full of blue blocks, and it's getting 
boring. When the screen gets too full, you can get yourself out of graph- 
ics mode by typing text and then starting over. 

The color=2 command will keep things in the blue until you tell it 
otherwise. Color=9 will change things to an orange fiavor, color=3 will 
give you grape, and color= 1 5 will make it snow. 

Notice that when you enter a color= command, the blocks you al- 
ready have on the screen remain their original colors; only the blocks you 
plot after a color= command will be of different colors. Play around 
with both of these for a while, and come back when you're ready to 
move on. 



100 



AUGUST 1983 



Back already? Good! You may have discovered by now that color 0 
is black. Try this: 

C0L0R=9 
PLOT 25.35 
COLOR=0 
PLOT 25,35 

An orange dot appears, and then it's gone! If you have a colored 
block plotted somewhere and you want to get rid of it, change color to 
black (0) and plot a block in the same place as the one you want to take 
out. You're not really "erasing" the block, you're putting a black one in 
its place. It's a technicality, but the effects are the same. 

How It Works. Want to know how all this stuff happens? Read on. 
If not, read on anyway. 

The information that tells the Apple what colors to put on the lo-res 
screen and where to put them is stored in the same place in memory as 
the information for your normal forty-column text display (half of the 
eighty-column text-display information is stored there too, but that's a 
topic for some other time). In other words, the bytes in memory that put 
characters on the text screen are the same bytes that put blocks on the lo- 
res screen. You might guess that because of this you can't have the text 
and lo-res screens active at the same time. You're right. 

That's why you can't see what you've typed once it moves above the 
bottom four lines; the lo-res screen is in the way. It's the same reason why 
you can't see what's written on the classroom chalkboard when you're 
watching a movie; the movie screen is in the way. 

Each byte in this area of memory lets you put either one text charac- 
ter or two lo-res-graphics blocks on the screen. Text characters are put in 
an area that is eight dots tall and seven dots wide. If you look closely at 
the monitor, you can see that the characters themselves are only five dots 
wide with an empty column of dots on each side and seven dots tall with 
an empty row of dots between rows of characters. 

Lo-res graphics, since they occupy the same memory location as text, 
use the same bytes in memory that the text mode uses. Therefore, lo-res 
graphics are put in the same eight-by-seven dot areas on the screen as text

characters. However, whereas we can put one text character per area 
(byte), we can put two graphics blocks. Keeping things as nontechnical 
as possible, here's a brief explanation why. 

Just When We Were Getting Used to Liters. Just as there are two 
half pints to every pint, there are two half bytes to every byte. Half pints 
have a name of their own, cups; half bytes also have a name, nibbles. 

But unlike cups, each nibble goes on either the "high" end of a byte 
or the "low" end. For the benefit of the people who cut class when we ex- 
plained this, a byte consists of eight bits. The low end of a byte consists of 
bits 0 through 3, the high end bits 4 through 7. 

It's as though you had a pint jug with a partition in the middle and a 
spout on each side so you could fill each half of the jug separately; you'd 
still have a complete pint, but the liquid in one half would be separated 
from the liquid in the other half 

When you put a text character on the screen, you use up the entire 
byte (both nibbles) to create one thing, the letter "T," for example. If you 
wanted to take a pint of tea to Aunt Stella's, you'd fill one half of your 
divided jug with tea and then the other half, also with tea. Likewise, 
when you want to print a T on the screen, both nibbles are loaded with 
the information needed to make a letter T. 

Sharing Memories. Lo-res graphics presents a different situation. 
You need just half a byte to put a graphics block on the screen. Take a 
look at one of those blocks. It takes up a space seven dots wide, like the 
text character, but only four dots high — half of what a text character 
uses. Because lo-res graphics and the forty-column text displays occupy 
the same places in memory, and because a graphics block uses up only 
half the area of a text character, it's logical to conclude that it's using 
only half the memory (half a byte) that a text character uses. 

In graphics mode then, it's like Aunt Stella isn't that thirsty, so you 
don't have to lug a whole pint of tea over to her house. Instead, you can 
just fill up half the jug with tea and be on your way, just as you fill the 
memory location with half a byte of information to put a block on the 
screen . 

Since one lo-res block uses half a byte, two blocks, one on top of the 
other, use a whole byte. Two blocks of the same color would put the 
same information in both halves of the byte (two cups of tea). But if you 
wanted different colors, you could type: 

G0L0R=8 
PLOT 10,20 
C0L0R=9 
PLOT 10,21 

The result is that you get a brown block and an orange block in the same 
area (one byte's worth) that would hold one text character. 

In this way, it's as if you weren't sure whether Aunt Stella preferred 
tea or orange juice. To save you the pain of having her yell at you for 
bringing the wrong drink, you fill one half of your special jug with 
(brown) tea and the other half with (orange) orange juice. Everyone's 
happy, and Aunt Stella remembers you when the winter holidays roll 
around. 

That's basically how lo-res graphics works. You can do much more 
than just set colors and plot blocks, and if you're interested in going fur- 
ther, go through the Applesoft tutorial. It covers most of what you need 
to know about lo-res graphics. 

Blocks Are for Blockheads. Hi-res graphics are the things real life is 
made of When you walk down the street, you never see anything that 
even vaguely resembles lo-res graphics (a skyline from a distance, may- 
be). But the truth is that things made out of Lego blocks look just as 
good as objects drawn in lo-res, or sometimes better when you add 
wheels, hinges, pulleys, motors, and other new gadgets in Lego 
technology. 

That's why we have hi-res — so we can create arcade games, graphics 
adventures, and business charts. Actually, hi-res graphics works very 
much the same way as lo-res. In both cases, you select a color, plot a 
point, plot another point, and so on. 

You won't have a hard time picking up the hi-res words if you have a 
handle on lo-res commands. The gr equivalent for hi-res is hgr; color be- 
comes hcolor, and plot becomes — you guessed it — hplot. 

The hardest part is getting acquainted with the hi-res neighborhood.

AUGUST 1983 



The forty-by-forty-eight-block lo-res community is a village when com- 
pared to the hi-res metropolis. In hi-res, the screen is not defined by 
blocks, but by hundreds of dots. It measures 192 rows (numbered 0 to 
191) by 280 columns (numbered 0 to 279). Weird numbers, huh? Not 
really. Remember that lo-res blocks are four dots tall (4 X 48 = 192) and 
seven dots wide (7 X 40 = 280). 

Here we go. Type the following commands: 

HGR 

HC0L0R=2 
HPLOT 50,110 
HPLOT 52,110 

If all went well, you should have two violet dots on your screen. Un- 
less you have a color display, you're going to have a horrible time distin- 
guishing colors. Just trust us. Keeping in the hgr mode, now try this: 

HPLOT 101,110 
HPLOT 171,110 

Nothing. That's a weird thing about hi-res graphics; some colors ap- 
pear on certain points and not on others. But it's not all that hard to fig- 
ure out where they do and where they don't. 

Odds and Evens. You can set hcolor to any value from 0 to 7, but 
you only get six colors. Confused? So was Arthur when he pulled Excali- 
bur from the stone, but he got used to it. The colors green (1) and or- 
ange (5) appear only when you plot them in the odd-numbered columns; 
violet (2) and blue (6) appear only when you throw them into even-num- 
bered ones. 

You get two white colors to choose from (3 and 7). You can hplot 
both on odd and even columns, but there's a catch. The first white (3) ap- 
pears as green in odd columns and violet in even ones; the second one ap- 
pears as orange and blue in odd and even columns respectively. So why 
the heck are they called white? 



When you have two dots of any combination of colors (except black) 
in adjacent columns, they blend to form white. You can't do this with 
any one color. Color 2, violet, as you remember, can be put only in even 
columns. So, you can't put two violet dots next to each other because 
they turn out black in odd columns. However, if you take a color like 
green that shows up only in odd columns, you can put it next to a violet 
dot, and they will appear as two white ones. Strange, but we're forced to 
live with it. 

The white colors are the only ones that let you hplot points in adja- 
cent columns. Odd gives you one color, even gives you another, and to- 
gether they form white. 

The Only Consistent Color. Suspiciously missing from all this color 
talk is black. Just as with white, you get two black colors to choose from 
(0 and 4). Luckily, one looks just like the other in odd, even, and con- 
secutive columns. The reasons why there are two each of black and white 
are too complex to go into here. It has to do with the way the bits are or- 
ganized inside the machine. Don't feel like we're skipping material, 
though; if you're really that interested in finding out why strange things 
like these work the way they do, you're pro'oably motivated enough to 
open up the Applesoft and reference manuals and read about it. 

Earlier we said that the hi-res screen is 192 dots tall. But if you tried 
to plot any points like 20,170 or anything with a second number larger 
than 159, you won't see it appear. It's the same reason why lo-res plots 
appeared as text characters near the bottom; that bottom area is re- 
served for text. Whereas text takes up lo-res rows 40 through 47, it takes 
up hi-res rows 160 through 191. Nothing appears below row 159 when 
you hplot there because, unlike lo-res, hi-res uses a different memory set- 
up than text mode. 

If you want to use the whole screen for hi-res fun and eliminate those 
rows of text, just type hgrl instead of hgr when you want to get into hi- 
res mode. You had better be an accurate typist, though, because what- 
ever commands you type after that won't appear on the screen. 

Again, to get back to the text mode, you just type text. 

The hgr2 command doesn't just get rid of text at the bottom. It pulls

AUGUST 1983 



out an entirely different hi-res screen, called hi-res page two. As you 
might guess, hgr is hi-res page one. Unlike lo-res and text modes, which 
reside in the same memory location, hi-res pages one and two occupy 
two different places in memory. Thus, you can draw something in page 
one and then switch to page two without disrupting page one. Unfortu- 
nately, it's not as easy as typing hgr, hgr2, hgr, hgr2, and so on. The hgr 
commands erase whatever page they turn on, but there are ways to avoid 
that. Again, if you want to get into this kind of thing, you'd better dig out 
the ol' manuals. 

How It Works, Revisited. The forty-column text mode and the lo-res 
display are controlled by the same area in memory. In text, one byte con- 
trols one character; in lo-res graphics, it controls two blocks, one on top 
of the other. In hi-res, however, one byte controls one row of seven dots. 
Since eight rows of dots (eight bytes) stack up as high as two lo-res blocks 
(one byte), we can see that hi-res graphics uses eight times as much mem- 
ory as its lo-res sibling. 

It should be getting obvious that to draw a line from one end of the 
screen to the other, you'd have to plot 280 points. What a pain. Fortu- 
nately, that's all taken care of. Get into the hi-res mode, choose a color, 
and try this out: 

HPLOT 0,0 TO 279,0 

Ha! We just saved ourselves a lot of typing by plotting all 280 of those 
points with one command. 
Now try this: 

HPLOT TO 0,159 TO 279,159 

What you should have is a giant Z on your screen. See, the hplot com- 
mand can be used to draw whole lines so that we don't have to hassle 
with inputting points individually. Computers are meant to save us time, 
even though they sometimes seem to work against the cause. 

The Shapes of Things. Even though it looks like we're drawing lines 



when we use hplot like this, we're really just drawing a lot of points one 
by one very quickly. Drawing stuff in graphics modes, both lo-res and hi- 
res, is nothing more than putting a group of points on the screen. 

Suppose we wanted to combine hi-res dots in such a way as to make 
a little picture? We could select a color, plot some points, select another 
color, plot some more points, and so on until we had a picture of a rab- 
bit. But that would be a pain and it would take a long time. Besides, 
there's no such thing as just one rabbit, so you'd have to do the same 
thing over and over until you had a huge collection of rabbits. 

Serious programmers get around all of this repetitious nonsense by 
using things called shape tables. A shape table is a series of vectors that 
go from point to point, plotting dots on selected points while leaving 
other ones blank. The result is that the trail of dots the vectors leave be- 
hind forms a picture; in our case, it's a rabbit. The shapes in children's 
books that you form by connecting numbered dots are sort of like shape 
tables. 

Once you have a shape table in satisfactory condition, you save it to 
disk as a binary file. When you want to let the rabbits come hopping 
onto the screen, you just load the shape table into memory and write a 
program that finds a point on the screen, says, "Put a rabbit here," finds 
another point, says, "Put another rabbit here," and so on until you have 
all the rabbits you need. Every time the Apple hears the program say, 
"Put a rabbit here," it reads the information in its memory that tells it 
how to draw the rabbit — the shape table — and draws it on the screen. 

There are other Applesoft commands that let you rotate and change 
the size of your shape, just in case some rabbits start tumbling around or 
growing up. 

This is generally how animation works. For film, an artist draws a se- 
ries of pictures and then flips the frames. For computer games, the pro- 
grammer creates shapes and plots them at different points on-screen to 
create the illusion of movement. 

That's all we have space for this time. Next time, we'll kick off the 
academic year with some real meat: how computers count. Bring your 
abacus and a sixteen-key calculator. 3M 



THE SENSIBLE SPELLER 

IMPROVED/ 



The #1 Apple spelling verification program has been made even 
better! We've taken all of the features you liked from the original 
and have added the features you requested to create the new 
SENSIBLE SPELLER! 

MORE FEATURES! 

We've added the features you asked for! * You can now immedi- 
ately correct misspelled words by replacing them with the proper 
spelling. The SENSIBLE SPELLER even suggests the correct 
spelling for your misspelled words! 

We've also given you more options for searching the dictionary, 
including multiple-character and single-character substitutions. 

THE CHOICE OF THREE OUT OF FOUR 
APPLE OWNERS! 

We still give you all the features that made the 
SENSIBLE SPELLER the choice of three 
out of four Apple owners buying a spelling 
checker.** In fact, the SENSIBLE 
SPELLER was the only spelling 
verification program to ever 
appear on Softalk's Top 30 list. 
The SENSIBLE SPELLER still 
includes the largest dictionary 
available for the Apple computer 
— over 80,000 words are supplied 
with unlimited room to add your 
own special words! This is a brand- 
name dictionary, containing real 
words from the official Random 
House Dictionary — not a list of 
words typed in by some programmer 




or made up from tables of prefixes and suffixes ! We even throw in 
a hardback copy of the dictionary to give you definitions and 
pronunciations! 

The SENSIBLE SPELLER is fast, a ten-page document can be 
checked in just a minute or two. It is also extensively menu driven 
to make it friendly and easy to use. And because each misspelled 
word is shown to you in the middle of a small excerpt from your 
document, you won't waste time trying to remember how you 
used the word. 

MORE WORD PROCESSORS! 

Each SENSIBLE SPELLER package contains multiple versions 
for compatibility with almost all Apple word processors including: 
DOS 3.2, DOS 3.3 (Apple Writer, Magic Window, 
Screen Writer, etc.), SuperText, Word Handler, 
CP/M (Wordstar, etc.), and Pascal word 
processors. And, the SENSIBLE SPELLER 
works on all Apple He, \\ + , and Apple- 
compatible computers with one or two 
disk drives.

When it comes to superior performance, 
we study our lines very carefiiUy. 



Superior printer performance is not a fluke. 
It evolves from analyzing printed line after 
printed line. Taking the time to test and retest. 
After 30 years of manufacturing precision 
parts, we know that there are no shortcuts. 

And so we took the Gemini-lOX and method- 
ically put it through its 120 cps pace. We 
achieved a print head life of over 100 million 
characters with an extremely precise dot align- 
ment creating each crisp character. 

So far so good. 

Next, sophisticated performance de- 
manded versatility A wide choice of 
character sets, a buffer expandable ■ ■ 
to 8K,and the ability to interface /SsSz 
with all popular personal S\IL 
computers. We added macro ^J^^ 



instruction, giving Gemini-lOX the capability 
to perform up to 16 operations with one com- 
mand. We included as standard a paper 
feed system that has a friction and fully adjust- 
able tractor feed. Then we even built in the 
dexterity to print graphics and text on the 
same line. 
Done. 

And, of course, staying the best means 
constant reviewing and fine-tuning. Keeping 
the Gemini easy to find, easy to afford and so 
reliable it can be warranted for up to twice 
as long as its major competitors.

Ask your house these questions the next time you walk in the front 
door; 

What's the status of the lights, appliances, heater, fans, air condi- 
tioner, and other devices? 

Did you remember to close the garage door? 

Are there any appointments, chores, anniversaries, or birthdays to 
attend to, bills to pay, or pets to feed? 

Is it cool enough outside to turn off the air conditioning and open the 
windows? 

How did the solar water heater perform today? How cold did the 
greenhouse get, and when? 

How many power failures, burglaries, and other nasty things 
happened while we were away? 

Is the hot tub ready to use? 

Tomorrow's Smart Caves. If your house remains silent under this 
barrage of queries, fear not. That just means you're living in a dumb 
manmade cave, as most of us are today. Tomorrow, homes will be 
smarter, in control, and talkative. 



In the future, your home will do more for you than you ever 
dreamed — perhaps even more than you ever wanted it to do. Though 
some folks will always like living in caves, others have much grander 
notions about human habitation. 

Currently, the house of the future comes in two models. Model one is 
smart as an Apple — because it runs on one. 

It is available right now in the form of a computerized home control 
package. So far there are three such progrsLms—Tomorrowhouse, Waldo, 
and the customized Zygard system, all of which will turn lights on and 
off, start your heater when it's cold, alert your security service in case of a 
break-in, and more. 

Model two, the superdeluxe version, requires a mainframe computer 
to function as its brain. 

It is available to millionaires and those wishing to customize their 
present abodes over the next few decades. The prototype for it is a whim- 
sically futuristic foam-dome house called Xanadu, after "the stately 
pleasure dome" decreed in Samuel Coleridge's poem "Kubla Khan." 

The future has never looked more fun.

AUGUST 1983 




Futurist Roy Mason takes a breather in tlie unfinished hearth room of Xanadu. 



Although the technology exists to make the dream house of tomor- 
row a reality today, few could afford it and no developer is cranking such 
creations out. However, "Xanadu — Home of the Future" is open to 
public scrutiny in the steamy wilds of Orlando, Florida. 

No one actually lives in Xanadu. Rather, it beckons like a smart new 
lure in the world's greatest bait shop. Since July , visitors have been able 
to tour the "house with a brain" and catch a glimpse of a super-high-tech 
tomorrow. 

Xanadu's sculptured-foam-insulation-sprayed-over-balloons con- 
struction is a radical departure from conventional home-building tech- 
niques. Most houses these days aren't round, and most houses these days 
don't have bubble-eyed faces for windows and exposed nervelike foam 
tendrils snaking over them. 

If Xanadu looks a bit like an off-world dwelUng from a science fic- 
tion film, that's because it's supposed to. 

"People expect a house of the future to look unconventional," says 
Bob Masters, one of the partners in the ongoing project. The intended 
entertainment value of the dwelling contrasts nicely with the high-tech 
furnishings and concepts that went into its design. 

Out of the Woods. This is the second house of the future con- 
ceived by Masters and his partner, Eric Walter. The first Xanadu was a 
summer season "curiosity piece" built in Wisconsin in 1968. It was small 
and uncomputerized but proved so popular that the partners decided, 
three years ago, to move to the more heavily trafficked Orlando area and 
build a bigger, more sophisticated year-round attraction. 

Masters and Walter commissioned Washington, D.C., architect Roy 
Mason — a futurist with plenty of visionary zeal — to design Xanadu. 
They met Mason at a futurist's convention. 

Mason has spoken and written about, and created films on, the sub- 
ject of future architecture. Specializing in energy-conscious structures. 
Mason has created more than fifty contemporary homes incorporating 
the latest building technologies, from solar heating to foam to micro- 



computers. He's also one of the founders of the World Future Society 
and architectural editor of the group's Futurist magazine. 

But he wouldn't agree to design Xanadu unless he could make it the 
world's first smart house: a house with a computer brain. Although most 
of what visitors see now at Xanadu are prepared demonstrations, a base- 
ment room is waiting for the house mainframe. Eventually all systems, 
from security to food preparation to communications, will be tied into 
the central computer for total environmental programming. 

There's no more fitting place on Earth to create a vision of tomorrow 
than the tropical jungle surrounding Orlando. The countryside is over- 
run with epic visions — from orange groves to manmade wonders like 
Disney World (the crown jewel), Epcot (contender for the crown). Ring- 
ling Bros, and Barnum & Bailey's Circus World, Cyprus Gardens, and 
dozens of others 

Each theme park is more outlandish than the next: Each is an artifi- 
cial paradise where only your sense of childhood wonder is real; and each 
is an engineering marvel in its own right. 

It's the same with Xanadu, the new attraction in Florida's theme 
park paradise. 

Every Bell and Whistle. A push-button pleasure dome, Xanadu is 
loaded with goodies: the Anova Master System, with its intelligent 
phone, light, and security control; the Atari Learning Center; the Curtis 
Mathes Home Entertainment Center; the Richmaid curvilinear kitchen; 
the Jensen Surround Sound system; the Beam central vacuum system; 
the Kallwell passive solar storage tanks; the Hastings sculptural bath; 
and the J.S. & A. -Gladstone ro'ootic chess set. 

An Androbot greets Xanadu's visitors at the front door. After a short 
introduction, visitors are given a hand-held walkie-talkie-like guide wand 
before embarking on a walking tour of a fictional millionaire's family 
home of the future. 

Celebrity sound-alike voices in the guide wand tell about life in the 
house of the future. Jimmy Stewart chats about the electronic hearth;

IF YOU'RE CONFUSED 

ABOUT BUYING A 
PERSONAL COMPUTER, 

rSSOMEHELE 




Computers come in two parts. 

One part is the "hardware" the 
machinery itself. The other is the 
"software',' which tells a computer 
what to do, the way a driver tells a 
car what to do. 

Without software, a computer 
can't do anything. And vice versa, 
You have to buy both. 
Buy the software first 

Since the reason you're buying a 
computer is to get the capability 
the software gives you (rememiDer 
it's the software that tells the com- 
puter what to do) , it makes good 
sense to pick the software first. 

Start by making a list of the 
things you want the computer 
to do. Possibilities include word 
processing, inventory control, 
accounting, graphics, recordkeep- 
ing-you name it, there's probably 
software that does it. 

Next take your list into a com- 
puter store and ask the salesper- 
son to demonstrate software that 
will do the things you want. 

Even though you'll need a com- 
puter for the demonstration, keep 
in mind the computer is just a 
vehicle. The software is the driver. 
Once you've decided on software, 
picking the rest of the computer 
system will be that much easier. 
The simpler the better. 

Some people wiU tell you that 
software has to be complicated to 
be powerful. Nothing could be fur- 
ther from the truth. 

Good personal software should 
be, as the computer people say, 
"friendly." Meaning that it helps you 
do what you want to do without get- 
ting in the way, 

Good software keeps the com- 
plications in the computer, where 



they belong. And keeps the capa- 
bility at your fingertips. It's that 
simple. 

Simply see for yourself 

You can read any number 
interesting books and mag 
azines about personal 
computers. You can 
ask your friends 
who have 
them. 




Or look 
at all 
the sales 
literature 
you can get 
your hands on 

But as helpful as 
that can be, there's 
no substitute for a live 
demonstration. 

When you do go shop- 
ping, we recommend 
you take a look at 
thePFS- Family 
of Software. 

Designed 
the way we 
think a soft- 
ware family 
should be: 
simple, " 
straightforward 
and powerful 



Currently there are four software 
packages in the family: PFS:WEITE, 
PFS:FILE, PFS:REPORT and PFS: 
GRAPH, with more on the way. 
Here's a little more about each of 
them, 

PFS:WRITE. The simplest way 
to get your message across. 

PFS:WRITE is ideal for people 
who want to make their writing time 
more productive, ft displays what 
you write on your computer screen 
so you can make revisions as you 
compose. 

With WRITE, you can correct mis- 
spellings or substitute one portion 
of text for another, with just a few 
keystrokes. 

And when you're through revising, 
WRITE shows you "on-screen "just 
how your document wiU look 
when it's printed. So there 
are no surprises afterwards. 

WRITE also works with 
most popular software pro- 
grams, including the PFS 
Family of Software. 

This feature allows you to add 
names and addresses from mailing 
lists to generate form letters. Or 
combine columns of numbers or 
. graphs with your text. 

^^PFS:FIL£.The simplest 
^^way to get organized. 

^^FILE is basically a paper filing 
system without the paper. So 
^^^F you can record, file, retrieve 
and review information in a 
fraction of the time it takes with a 
conventional filing system. 

With FILE, you arrange your 
information on a "form" you design 
yourself. And when you need to 
track something down, FILE sorts 
through your records electronically, 
ft lets you retrieve information in a 
variety of ways so you can be as 
selective as you want. 

PFS: REPORT. The simplest 
way to sum it all up. 

REPORT is a powerful analysis 
tool that works with FILE. 

REPORT sorts through your fHes 
and retrieves the information you're 
looking for. Then assembles it aU 
into one report, so you can analyze, 
plan and make better-informed 
decisions. 

REPORT is also good at math, ft 
quickly sorts through columns of 
numbers and performs calcula- 
tions, so you won't have to.

PFS:GRAPH. 
The simplest 
way to spot trends. 

GRAPH is ideally suited for 
professionals who need charts or 
graphs in a hurry. 

All you do is specify the kind of 
graph or chart you want and enter the 
information. GRAPH does the rest. 

GRAPH transforms columns of 
facts and figures into pie, line and 
bar charts so you can spot trends 
quickly and make better-informed 
decisions. 

GRAPH works with PFS: 
WRITE, PFS:FILE,VisiGalc® * 
files or data entered directly 
into the computer. And sup- 
ports most popular printers and 
plotters.

XANADU 
F L O O 
P L A 





Julia Child illuminates the kitchen; Richard Nixon talks about telecom- 
muting; Kermit the frog elaborates on the electronic windows in the kids' 
rooms, and Rod Serling discusses the "outdoor zone." 

While Xanadu is mostly a fantasy tour, the house reflects a lot of 
Mason the futurist as well as Mason the architect. He thinks quite a lot 
about the future while he spends time customizing Xanadu. 

His philosophy of "Architronics" is spelled out in his forthcoming 
book, Xanadu, Your Astonishing Computer Home of Tomorrow — Today. 
Central to Mason's concepts is the idea that the home will evolve into 
our "second skin" with its own nervous system (wiring) and communi- 
cation between organs (appliance to appliance, including computers). 

Ambidextrous Dwelling. This nervous system reports to a central 
brain (central computer). And this is where Mason's philosophy takes a 
very advanced turn. 

"Like the human brain," explains Mason, "the house brain is divided 
into two functional parts. The left side of the brain performs all the 
housekeeping chores — controlling the heating, air conditioning, securi- 
ty, energy consumption, air quality, and lighting. 

"The right side will be used to anticipate the needs of the inhabi- 
tants. In addition, the right side of the home brain will be used to con- 
nect the hou.se to the outside world through banking, education, and 
communications networks." No more dialing the Source. The house of 
tomorrow will do it for you. There are also plans to build a microwave 



antenna and a satellite dish into the structure to serve as the house's 
"organic ears," says Mason. 

Ironically, the house of the future will be remarkably like the house 
of the past, according to Mason. "I believe it will bring people closer to- 
gether, the way the family homes of yesterday did. Instead of leaving the 
house to work, go to school, shop, and be entertained, the family will be 
able to do these things at home." 

In the future, families will gather around the electronic hearth, a 
souped-up version of today's home entertainment center. The hearth 
room will feature the main terminal link to the central computer as well 
as to the outside world. The hearth room at Xanadu currently features 
an electronic art display — several large monitors featuring Niam June 
Pak-like graphics — built into an adjoining wall. 

"The house brain on paper looks like a war room now," says Mason. 
"But it doesn't have to. Micro technology will keep making it smaller 
and smaller. However, the microchip isn't really the breakthrough here. 
The real breakthrough is the electronic symbiosis between people 
and machines." 

Healthy Symbiosis. Such activities as conversation, meal planning, 
education, game playing, word processing, and family or individual 
therapy will be possible through the hearth's computer terminal, or through 
any of the terminals placed throughout the dwelling. Portable extensions 
of the hearth will exist in case a family member has to travel. 



Software and Tupperware! 

These days, most everyone stores their leftovers until 
they can think of something to do with them. Now, 
Micro Cookbook does the thinking for you. Tell Micro 
Cookbook what's in your refrigerator and it'll tell you what 
you can make. Micro Cookbook includes hundreds of 
delicious recipes using common leftovers and ingredients 
most every home always has on hand. Micro Cookbook 
stretches your food budget by helping you stretch youi- food. 

Micro Cookbook also lets you select a recipe by name 
(Veal Picatta), by ingredient (veal), by classification (Italian) 
or a combination of the above. Plus, Micro Cookbook 
allows you to enter your own recipes, create your own 
cookbook and prepare your shopping list. Add a glossary 
of cooking terms, calorie and nutrition guide, table of 
measurements, ingredient substitutions and food buying, 
storage and cooking guide, and you see why Micro Cook- 
book is an appetizing program for you.

AUGUST 1983 




The therapy application of the system is a creation of Mason's. He 
eventually sees the creative right side of the house brain holding a data- 
base of behavior files on each member of the household. Inhabitants will 
be able to interact with the house shrink, so to speak, through voice-con- 
trolled programs in a therapylike situation. 

Another room in Xanadu, called the Sensorium, is planned to be a 
mood room for one or more people. At present, this room is a theater 
where visitors may see a short film on how the house is constructed. 
Mason sees the Sensorium as eventually being able to pick up biofeed- 
back information from persons inside it. It will also take cues from such 
things as after-dinner conversation. If dinner puts you in a classical 
mood, say so. The Sensorium will counter with a dose of Beethoven. 

Liquid crystal walls, climate control, and music and sound will make 
the Sensorium a space-age meditation room. Throw in a mirrored ball 
and you get a terrific dance club. With the walls as screens, an armchair 



trip to the dead seas of Mars is not out of reach, provided we ever have 
film of the dead seas of Mars. 

In the kitchen of the future, a robotic autochef will prepare prepack- 
aged meals, hustling them from freezer to microwave. You may even 
want your "robutler," as Mason calls it, to serve meals. Planning menus, 
storing recipes, creating shopping lists, and juggling individual diet pref- 
erences will all be done on the built-in kitchen terminals. However, unless 
you want to exist solely on Le Menu frozen dinners, you'll have to do 
your own cooking. 

Mason says that when you turn in after a hard day in the future, 
you'll crawl into a cocoonlike hole in the wall instead of a bed (to achieve 
heat conservation). 

You'll be able to watch the sun rise on a large screen in your room — 
courtesy of your outdoor surveillance cameras. Your bedroom terminal 
will be at your fingertips. The question of what to wear (or what not to

wear) to work will be easily solved — the only commuting you'll be doing 
is telecommuting from your own home. 

If all these projections of a swell tomorrow sound expensive, con- 
sider Mason's hope to make it within financial reach of the average per- 
son. "You'll buy a house like you buy a car now. First the basic unit, with 
any extras you want installed before delivery, then accessories as you 
need them." 

It's All Automatic, by George! While Xanadu is certainly an inter- 
esting vision of one man's house of tomorrow, you can have your first 
taste of similar luxuries by simply harnessing an Apple in your humble 
cave of today. Several currently available systems promise to turn any 
home into a small-scale Xanadu. 

Customized control systems have been installed in various Pacific 
Northwest homes — and in one car — by Zena Micro Engineering of Seat- 
tle, Washington. The company's systems perform various combinations

of household security and energy management. 

Most of the homes are owned by families who have never touched a 
computer, says John Katzka, vice president and software guru at Zena. 
"Our challenge is not only to create a functional system," he says, "but 
to provide the training and handholding that goes along with a new com- 
puter in the home." 

Up to twenty-four separate zones of protection can be addressed in 
hi-res graphics with Zena's Zygard system. The system's board, de- 
signed by Zena George, can interface with all types of sensors, magnetic 
door and window switches, step mats, smoke detectors, and so on. 

The Apple's speaker is connected to the house intercom and can in-

be automatically dialed and doors can be locked and unlocked from the

Talking to Your House. Meanwhile, if you want to know if your 
lawn has been watered, you ask Waldo. If you want lights turned on and 
off, or the TV, you tell Waldo — a voice-activated house control system 
from Artra, based in Arlington, Virginia. 

Waldo is "a VisiCalc for home control that works just like a spread- 
sheet," says company president Reuel Launey. "The homeowner creates 
action files, with time and date, to monitor appliances and such." Up to 
sixteen appliances can be hooked up to the system's card, as well as to 
alarms and stereo systems. 

The package can call out preprogrammed reminders in a choice of 
human-sounding or mechanical Votrax voices. "It has a vocabulary of 
up to two hundred words," says Launey, "all the most common words 
used in running a household." By first teaching Waldo to recognize a 
phrase, you can ask it the fime or to turn down the heat from as far as 
eight feet away. 

"Already, some owners have equipped Waldo to respond to other 
than voice commands. It can listen for the doorbell, a crying child, or a

heat-collecting room. 

burglar alarm," says Launey. "Quadriplegics and other handicapped 
persons can immediately use Waldo to voice-control their owti environ- 
ment to lessen the need for constant nursing." 

Tom the Turnkey TomorrowHouse. What is it like to see your 
Apple extending itself throughout your house, looking, feeling, react- 
ing — a micro extension of yourself? Russ Coffman of CompuHouse Sys- 
tems in Denver, Colorado, knows what it's like. He's the creator of the 
TomorrowHouse computerized control system. 

A demo version of his package is currently on display at Xanadu in 
Orlando and is to be hooked up for actual use in the near future. Waldo 
will also be eventually installed at Xanadu. 

TomorrowHouse (Tom for short) is a complete turnkey control sys- 
tem. In addition to setting up the standard heating/cooling, lights/appli- 
ances, and alarm control, homeowners can define their own systems using 
a truth table method based on specified parameters. 

Coffman has lived in a computerized home for the last three years — 
his home is the TomorrowHouse testing lab. "When I first designed 
Tom, I watched it like a hawk just to see how it worked," he says. "As the 
pace of adding new features slowed and I stopped waiting to see if my 
porch light came on when it was supposed to, my personal foreground 
became less cluttered with details."

Molded foam "nerves" snake up the outer shell of the Sensorium. 

The main benefit of having the system, Coffman would gradually 
learn, "was a subconscious feeling of peace of mind. I left home know- 
ing things would be taken care of in my absence. The memo feature proved 
to be a lifesaver. I put my schedules out of my mind and let the Apple re- 
member for me." A crisp voice nudges him about things he wants to be 
nudged about. 

Even though his home was being run better than ever before, Coff- 
man wanted more. "One can get jaded by even the most spectacular life- 
styles," he says. "That's when I realized I wanted space-age convenience 
all the time." So he created version 2.0, with remote control. The com- 
puter can be accessed by any Touch-Tone phone, taking commands as 
well as inquiries on any part of the system's operations. 

However intelligent a control system becomes, it can't predict a va- 



cationing skier returning a day earlier than planned with a broken leg, 
says Coffman. 

Xanadu designer Roy Mason speculates that in the future intelligent 
homes and entire smart-building communities will "compare notes" on 
energy use and other matters. 

This is already possible with off-the-shelf technology such as Waldo 
(they're working on modem control) and TomorrowHouse. "Someday 
Tom will be able to start experimenting with the house's solar heating 
system on his own, fmding out what parameters are most efficient with- 
out my reviewing his plots," says Coffman. 

We're Not Obsolete Yet! Although computerized brains and ma- 
chinery will be taking care of our future homes, for the moment it still 
takes humans to see that all this homey technology keeps progressing. 

Funny thing about the future: It never really arrives. It's a projec- 
tion, a hope, a fantasy of time — something we all peg our dreams to. 
That's why home system designers and futurists like Mason, Zena 
George, Katzka, Launey, and Coffman are busy creating the future 
today. 

There's really no reason to wait. Ill

Thousands of 
dollars worth of 
word processing 
perfomiance for 
just $149.95 

Who% saying that? 

Arthur Naiman, for one, in 
the "Word Processing Buy- 
er's Guide" to be published 
soon by McGraw-Hill. 

In his definitive study, 
Naiman compared 14 major 
word processing prod- 
ucts — and PIE: Writer was 
among the top three. Its 
neaj?est neighbors were 
dedicated word processors 
which cost from $13,500 to 



$15,000. (See a portion of 
the study results below) 
Yet PIE: Writer can be part 
of your personal computer 
system for just $149.95! 

So now your business or 
home microcomputer can 
have capabilities equivalent 
to the industry's top ma- 
chines. Naiman says: 
"PIE .'Writer, running on 
a humble Apple n, out- 
scored every other word 
processing program for 
microcomputers ... (It) 
crams an incredible 
amount of power into a 
small (23V2 K) and inex- 
pensive package . . . 
PIE:WHter beat four out 
of six dedicated word

Sometimes it seems as if God made Apple DOS from one of Basic's 
ribs. Apple DOS does lots of things in special ways for the sake of In- 
teger and Applesoft Basic. This month and next we'll investigate the re- 
lationship between DOS and Basic. 

One of the first things a beginning Apple user learns is what catalog 
does. Most of you know that the letter a catalog displays in front of each 
file's length and name indicates that file's type. Apple DOS uses four pri- 
mary file types: 

]CATALOG 

DISK VOLUME 254 

T 002 THIS IS A "TEXT FILE" 

B 002 THIS IS A "BINARY FILE" 

I 002 THIS IS AN "INTEGER FILE" 

A 002 THIS IS AN "APPLESOFT FILE" 

Text files are usually used to store data rather than programs. If you 
use a word processor, it probably saves your work in text files. Many da- 
tabase programs also store information in text files. Text files aren't as- 
sociated with any specific computer language. All languages that oper- 
ate under DOS can read and write text files. 

Binary files hold "snapshots" of memory areas. When you save a bi- 
nary file, you have to tell DOS the starting point of the memory area you 
want to save and how long the area is. DOS then creates a duplicate 
image of that memory area on your disk. You can reload the image 
whenever you like. Binary files are used for machine language programs 
and some types of data files. While binary files are used extensively by 
machine or assembly language programs, they can be used from any lan- 
guage. Like text files, they are not "language-bound." 

The other two file types, however, are each closely bound to a lan- 
guage. Applesoft and Integer files are used only for program storage — 
never to store data. 

There are three primary DOS commands for manipulating Apple- 
soft and Integer files, and anyone who has read this far, with the possi- 
ble exception of the author's mother, has used all of them at least once. 
They are load, run, and save. 

Loading Programs and Running with Them. These three com- 
mands work almost exactly the same way whether they're used from In- 
teger or Applesoft Basic. To operate as a DOS command, each of the 
three commands must be followed by the name of the file you want. 

If you leave out the file name, load and save will seem to hang up 



your computer. The cursor will disappear, the keyboard won't respond, 
and your computer will appear to be dead. Leaving out the file name has 
the effect of telling Basic to load or save using a cassette tape recorder; 
it's now waiting for you to turn the recorder on. Just press reset to re- 
cover. Typing run without a file name will work if there is a Basic pro- 
gram in memory. 

When you remember to use the file name, load gets the designated 
program from the disk and puts it into your computer. Load also does 
some lesser-known things, such as erasing any program previously in 
memory, switching versions of Basic if necessary, and closing any opened 
files. Run does everything load does, and it also starts up the designated 
program after loading it. 

From Applesoft, load clears all variables. From Integer Basic, it does 
not. For example, if you are using Integer Basic and you tell the com- 
puter AS = "DOStalk", then load a program and ask Basic to print A$, 
it will respond "DOStalk." If you do the same thing while using Apple- 
soft, you will get nothing but a blank look. New readers are hereby 
warned that this sort of interesting but useless information is typical of 
this column. 

There are three error messages you will occasionally encounter when 
loading and running Basic programs. 

Language not available \ nd\cales that the correct version of Basic isn't 
available on your computer. We'll discuss this in detail later. 

File type mismatch indicates that you just tried to load or run a bi- 
nary or text file. You can't do it. Only Applesoft and Integer Basic files 
can be loaded. 

File not found usually indicates that you misspelled the name of the 
file you wanted to load, although sometimes it indicates that the disk you 
thought was in the disk drive isn't really there. 

But Who Will Save Us from Ourselves? Save doesn't do anything 
special other than transfer the program currently in memory to the disk. 
Everyone quickly learns that if you save a program under the same name 
as another program, the new program will replace the old. The old — 
gulp — will be gone forever. This will happen without warning — no ques- 
tions asked. 

There are several errors you will occasionally see when using save. 
Write-protected indicates that somebody doesn't want you saving stuff 
on the disk currently in the drive. To write-protect the disk, this "some- 
one" covered the square notch on the edge of the disk with a piece of spe- 
cial tape. To unprotect it, simply peel the tape off.

File locked is similar, but without the tape. Use the DOS unlock com- 
mand for quick relief. File type mismatch indicates that you have tried to 
save your program under a file name already being used by a binary or 
text file or by a program in the alternate Basic. Uncle DOS won't let you 
save an Applesoft program in an Integer file or vice versa. 

Note that if you misspell a file name while saving. Uncle DOS won't 
know the difference. He'll create a new file with the misspelled name and 
put your program in it. This can create a great deal of confusion. 

Imagine you have spent the evening working on a program called 
Beer Inventory. During the course of the evening, you saved it twice. Just 
before going to bed, you save it the final time but mistakenly type Bear 
Inventory. 

The next day, when you reload the program, a whole bunch of work 
will be missing. Go ahead, scream and howl, but before killing yourself 
for forgetting to save your work, do a catalog and check for a misspelled 
file name. It could save your life. 

A Very Rusty Chain. At the extreme opposite end of the usage spec- 
trum from load, run, and save is a DOS command called chain. This 
command can be used only with Integer Basic files and allows you to link 
together Integer programs that won't all fit in memory at once. At the 
end of the first program you chain to the second, and so on. 

Chain is very similar to run. The only differences are that it doesn't 
close open files and it doesn't reset all variables to zero. (Run clears Inte- 
ger Basic variables; load and chain do not.) This means that programs 
linked together with chain can easily use data left by previous programs 
and easily leave data for following programs. Unfortunately, you can't 
link Applesoft programs together with this command. Because of the 
way Applesoft stores variables, any values are wiped out by the act of 
loading a new program, whether with load, run, or save. 

It's interesting that when you try to use chain with Applesoft, you do 
not get a "file type mismatch" error, which is what would make sense. 
Under Applesoft, chain duplicates the load command, except that it 
doesn't close open files. Somebody somewhere might find a use for chain 
with Applesoft yet. 

Relationships Revisited. The April DOStalk discussed init and boot- 
ing. Init shows the family relationship between Uncle DOS and Basic to 
be glaringly obvious. Init saves whatever Basic program is in memory 
onto your newly formatted disk. Booting or starting up that disk causes 
Uncle DOS to run the same program automatically. In the April article 
you saw how to break up the family just a little by getting Uncle DOS to 
brun or exec your hello program. 

In May we discussed the DOS commands pr# and in#. The family re- 
lationship here is somewhat less obvious. If you look in both your DOS 
and Basic manuals, however, you will find these two commands listed in 
both places. The only other commands listed in both are load, run, 
and save. 

Yet the load, run, and save commands of DOS are distinguishable 
from their Basic counterparts by whether you need to give a file name 
with them or not, as we discussed a few paragraphs ago. The pr# and in# 
commands are the same under both Basic and DOS. 

These commands let you turn on peripherals such as printers and 
modems. They work by changing the addresses in the I/O links. As we 
have discussed in previous columns, the I/O links are DOS's only con- 
nection to the outside world. When Uncle DOS does a pr# or in# com- 
mand, he takes note of where you want output to go or input to come 
from, but he leaves himself connected to the I/O links. Basic, on the 
other hand, disconnects DOS when it executes pr# or in#. 

When you type a pr# or in# command on your keyboard. Uncle 
DOS always intercepts and executes it without even telling Basic what 
happened. When you use pr# and in# in a program, however, the results 
depend on how you enter the command. Either of the following two lines 
will be accepted (there will be no syntax error). 



10 
10 



PRINT D$;"PR#0" 
PR#0 



(correct) 
(incorrect) 



The first line is a DOS command. This is the correct way to use pr# 
or in# from within a program. If you use the second version, which is a 
Basic command, DOS will be disconnected and will cease to function. 
Any DOS commands that follow will appear on your screen (or printer if 



you gave its slot number) rather than being executed. 

The process of debugging this mistake can be very confusing because 
it is not always obvious that you have disconnected DOS. If you don't al- 
so change the input link with in#, your next input statement or the end of 
your program will reconnect DOS. Try this, for example: 

10 D$ = CHR$ (13) + CHR$ (4) 
20 PR#1 

30 PRINT D$;"CATALOG" 
40 INPUT A$ 
50 PRINT D$;"CATALOG" 
60 END 

If you have a printer in slot 1, the first print statement will send the 
word catalog to your printer. Because the Basic pr# command in line 20 
disconnected Uncle DOS from the output link, he can't intercept the 
command. 

DOS is still connected to the input link, however. So when line 40 is 
executed, DOS regains control. After you enter something, DOS will put 
his own addresses in both the input and output links. Thus he intercepts 
the second catalog command and executes it. 

The catalog DOS creates in response to this second command will 
appear on your screen — not on your printer. Remember that DOS nev- 
er saw the pr# command in line 20. As far as he knows, the current out- 
put device was never changed. 

Now make the following change and try the program again: 

20 PR#0:IN#0 

This line will disconnect DOS from the I/O links completely. All 
DOS commands, both within programs and from the keyboard, will 
cease to function. To reconnect DOS, enter call 1002. 

Home, Home on the ROM. If everything up till now hasn't proved 
Uncle DOS was created as a helpmate for Basic, fp and int will. These 
commands switch your computer between Applesoft (floating point) and 
Integer Basic. First let's look at how this is possible. 

The shaded bar in the accompanying figure is making its fourth con- 
secutive appearance this month. It shows how the memory space in your 
Apple is organized. Take note of the horizontal lines that divide this bar 
into sixteen boxes. Each box represents 4K of memory. One K of com- 
puter memory is about a thousand bytes — 1,024 bytes, to be exact. Thus 
4K is 4,096 bytes (in hexadecimal that's $1000).

When you add together the bytes inside each of the sixteen 4K boxes, 
you have 64K. or 65,536 bytes. This is the maximum amount of mem- 
ory your Apple is capable of addressing or using directly. All Apples 
have the inherent capability of addressing this much memory and no 
more. 

The leftmost bar in the figure divides this 64K of memory into two 
pieces — a 48K hunk of RAM and a 16K hunk of ROM. As the figure 
shows, the RAM area is temporary memory. When you turn the com- 
puter off or write something down in this area, whatever was there be- 
fore disappears. The ROM area, on the other hand, is permanent. Nei- 
ther turning the fxjwer off nor trying to write in this area will change it. 

When you see computer manufacturers bragging about how many K 
of memory their computers have, make sure they are talking about 
RAM memory. This is the only kind you can use for your own pro- 
grams and data. Sometimes manufacturers hide ROM memory in their 
specifications. The amount of ROM indicates how many programs are 
built into the computer. The built-in programs are useful, but RAM 
memory is much more flexible than ROM, as we'll see in a moment. 

In the Apple, Basic is aOotted the address space between bytes 53248 
(SDOOO) and 63487 (SF7FF), as shown on the memory map. There is 
only enough room here for one version of Basic. Applesoft, which is built 
into the Apple II Plus and lie, uses all of it. Integer Basic, on the other 
hand, starts at byte 57344 (SEOOO). The address space from 53248 
(SDOOO) to 57343 (SDFFF) is empty on Integer Basic Apple lis. 

Green Apples. When the first Apples were manufactured, neither 
Applesoft Basic nor DOS existed. The first version of Applesoft Basic re- 
leased was known as cassette, or RAM, Applesoft. It came on a cassette 
tape and was designed to be loaded into the RAM memory area from 
byte 2(W8 ($800) to byte 12288 ($3000). 

Locate this area on the shaded bar and you'll see that it includes half 
of the first hi-res-graphics page. Because of this, cassette Applesoft 
wouldn't work with any programs that used hi-res graphics. This con- 
tributed significantly to its short life span. Recently, writers in various 
publications have referred to cassette Applesoft as an imaginary lan- 
guage, as if it never really existed. It existed; what requires imagination is 
remembering that, in its day, cassette Applesoft was considered a major 
enhancement to the Apple II. 

It was during the exciting and turbulent age of cassette Applesoft that 
good old Uncle DOS was born. The heritage of those early days of Ap- 
pledom still flows in his blood. Uncle DOS includes several scattered 
routines that allow cassette Applesoft to be used with DOS. The DOS 
manual uses the alias "disk Applesoff ' when referring to these powers. 

When you tell Uncle DOS to load or run an Applesoft program on a 
computer that doesn't have Applesoft available. Uncle DOS looks on the 
disk for an Integer Basic file called Applesoft. If he finds it, he loads it 
and runs it first. 

The Integer file Applesoft is supposed to contain cassette (or disk) 
Applesoft, but it never does. In fact, there seems to be no evidence that 
Apple ever actually released a version of cassette Applesoft on disk. If 
any of you know differently, let us know. 

Instead, the Applesoft file that you'll find on many of your disks con- 
tains an Integer Basic version of that disk's hello program. For example, 
if you look on your DOS System Master disk, you will find a program 
called Applesoft. (List it and compare it to the program called Hello.) 

When you boot a System Master disk, the program Hello will run if 
you are using an Applesoft computer. On an Integer model, however, 
DOS won't be able to run Hello; instead he'll run Applesoft. This allows 
the disk to boot on either type of computer. 

If you ever use this trick, your Integer program named Applesoft 
should end with a call 979 or a print d$:"int" rather than with end. When 
you end one of these special Apple.soft programs in the normal way. Un- 
cle DOS loads and tries to run the real hello program. Remember that it 
thinks the file called Applesoft held the Applesoft language, not an alter- 
nate hello. Our little bilingual trick leaves Uncle DOS very confused 
when you end it. The solution is to cold-start DOS, which either of these 
two commands will do. 

Applesoft Ripens. Cassette Applesoft gave owners of the original 
Apple II a new, more powerful version of Basic. However, it was soon 
overshadowed by the development of the Applesoft ROM card. This 



card contains the Applesoft language in permanent, ROM-type mem- 
ory chips. It also contains circuits that can fool the Apple into thinking 
the ROM chips on the card are the ones built into the computer. 

If you look back at the memory map, you'll see that the middle 
bar shows the address space used by a ROM card. When you plug a 
ROM card into your computer, the computer suddenly has 76K of 
memory — the normal 64 plus 12K on the ROM card. Yet, as men- 
tioned earlier, the Apple can only address, or directly use, 64K. As a re- 
sult, the two Basics must share the same address range. You switch back 
and forth between languages by throwing soft switches on the ROM 
card. (We talked at length about soft switches in this column in May.) 
When the ROM card is on, it tricks your Apple into thinking its ROMs 
are the built-in ones. When it is off, your Apple uses its own ROMs. 

Uncle DOS was designed to work with ROM card Applesoft as well 
as with cassette Applesoft. When you tell Uncle DOS to load or run an 
Applesoft program on an Integer computer, he actually looks for Apple- 
soft on a ROM card first. If he finds it, he turns on the card rather than 
trying to run the cassette version of Applesoft. 

DOS has one limitation here — it expects the card to be in slot 0. If the 
card's in another slot, DOS won't find it. You can fix this, if you have a 
ROM card you'd like to use in another slot, with two simple pokes. 
These pokes change the address of the soft switches Uncle DOS throws 
while looking for the card. With romslot equal to the number of the slot 
you have your ROM card in, type: 

POKE -231 12, 128 + (ROMSLOT * 16) 
POKE -23104, 129 + (ROMSLOT * 16) 

It's worth mentioning that an Integer Basic ROM card was also de- 
veloped for use in Applesoft computers. Everything we've said applies 
equally well to it. 

Changing ROM into RAM. ROM cards were a good idea, but then 
Apple came up with something even better, the language card. Instead of 
unchangeable ROM chips, the language card uses readable, writeable 
RAM-type memory. A language card can be loaded with Applesoft on 
an Integer Basic computer (using the System Master's alternate hello 
program, Applesoft, that we discussed earlier); with Integer Basic on an 
Applesoft computer; or with Pascal on either model. In addition, there 
are a multitude of other uses for the card — many of them not yet 
invented. 

Instead of holding just 12K of additional memory like the ROM 
cards, the language card was designed to provide Apples with an addi- 
fional I6K of RAM memory, bringing the total RAM up to a nice, even 
64K. Similar cards made by companies other than Apple are usually 
called 16K RAM cards. The Apple lie comes with the equivalent of a 
built-in language card. 

The 4K difference between the 12K ROM cards and the 16K RAM 
cards added a disproportionate amount of complexity. As you can see on 
the memory map, the address area from byte 49152 ($C0(X)) to 53247 
(SCFFF) is dedicated to input/output functions — soft switches and pro- 
grams for peripheral cards. It would cause all sorts of problems if using 
the additional 4K of memory on the language card turned off access to 
the I/O area. 

Rather than use the address space of the I/O area, the language card 
has two banks of RAM that share the address space from 53248 (SDOOO) 
to 57343 (SDFFF), as shown on the memory map. Basic uses one of 
these banks and leaves the other empty. The banks are selected by throw- 
ing soft switches. 

Because of the two banks and because the language card can be write- 
protected, eight soft switches are used to control the card, up from only 
two on ROM cards. The switches were selected in such a way, however, 
that the same two that turn a ROM card on and off will turn a language 
card with Basic on and off as well, h all means that Uncle DOS doesn't 
know the difference. 

Now Then, about FP and Int. When Apple introduced the language 
card, it was offered only in a package with Apple Pascal. Purchasers who 
wanted to use it for the alternate Basic were often surprised to find that 
the two Basics were included not with the language card but with DOS 
3.3. Next time you look at your DOS System Master disk, find the bi- 
nary files called Fpbasic and Intbasic. These files are the machine Ian-

guage images that may be loaded into the language card. 

When you give Uncle DOS the int or the fp command, he tries to 
turn on the designated language by throwing switches. If he's looking for 
Integer Basic and he still hasn't found it after looking at the 
ROM/RAM card, Uncle DOS will send you a "language not available" 
error message. 

Uncle DOS, by himself, is not smart enough to load Fpbasic or Int- 
basic into your language card. 

It's the System Master program Hello that knows how to load Int- 
basic; the program Applesoft loads Fpbasic. You cannot successfully 
load either language by using the bload command. This is because the 
soft switches must be set correctly to write-enable the language card be- 
fore the bload. Hello and Applesoft do this. 

When you boot the DOS 3.3 System Master disk, it will always load 
your language card with the appropriate language for your computer. If 
the computer's native language is Applesoft, Hello will run and load In- 
teger Basic. If the computer's native language is Integer, DOS will be un- 
able to run Hello and will run Applesoft instead, thus loading Applesoft 
Basic into the language card. 

When Uncle DOS successfully finds a new language on a ROM or 
RAM card, he turns the card on and cold-starts himself and Basic. The 
cold start takes care of everything that needs to be done to put Basic and 
DOS on friendly terms. During the cold start, DOS fills in a table called 
the language vector table, which is inside DOS itself; executes a nomon 
command: rebuilds three DOS buffers; resets himem to just below the 
buffers: and cold-starts the new language. This erases any program al- 
ready in memory. 

It's important to realize that these things would happen even if you 
were already in the designated language. Typing fp when you are al- 
ready in Applesoft is like typing new, nomonico, and maxfiles 3 all at 
once. 

If you ever receive a "program too large" error while trying to load 
or run a program, you can almost always clear up the error with an fp or 



int command. Usually this error is caused by an abnormal himem value, 
which the fp or int will clear up. 

How Entire Languages Disappear. DOS also clears the language 
card whenever it is booted. During a boot, Uncle DOS stores a zero in 
the byte he later uses to determine if a language is on the card. He does 
this so that a correct, but random, number in this byte won't trick him 
into thinking Basic is on the card. This is a nice safeguard, but it causes 
lots of trouble. 

The problem is that you can't load your language card from one 
disk — your System Master, for example — and then boot a second disk 
that uses the language. The second boot effectively erases the language 
card. 

The solution to this problem is another series of pokes into DOS. 
These pokes must be made to the DOS on the second disk. Putting these 
pokes into the DOS on the first disk will have no effect. 

A good method to use is to boot a System Master disk, make these 
pokes, then initialize a new disk. This new disk will then boot without de- 
stroying what's on the language card. The pokes are: 

POKE -16429,234 (was 141) 

POKE -16428,234 (was 0) 

POKE -16427,234 (was 224) 

In hexadecimal, this address range is $BFD3— $BFD5 and the new 
value is SEA. The old values are $8D, $00, and $E0. 

An alternative method is to change these three bytes directly if you 
have a program that will allow you to write on a disk. They appear on 
track 0, sector 9, bytes 211 to 213 (SD3-$D5). 

All commercial programs should include this change. Otherwise 
those users who depend on the language card for the required version of 
Basic will be unable to boot the disk. 

This month we've looked at all the DOS commands that have spe- 
cial features for the sake of Basic. Next month we'll look at how DOS 
handles errors for Basic's sake and see what has to be done to get Uncle 
DOS to do his stuff for other languages. See you then.

Robots 




BY DAVID HUflTQR 

^^obots are a dream, a fantasy, a desire, and a myth. 

Today, R2-D2 and C-3P0 exist only in the movies. As yet, no robots 
have been programmed to embody Asimov's three laws of robotics, and 
the thinking robot portrayed on the cover of So/talk's August 1981 issue 
is still a long way off. 

And yet when someone engaged in conversation mentions robots, 
other people in the room turn to listen. Then come the inevitable ques- 
tions. "You've seen one?" "What does it do?" "Can it talk?" "Did you 
shake its hand?" "Did it have a hand?" 

What is a robot? 

'Working Robots. To the industrial world, a robot is a reprogram- 
mable multifunctional manipulator designed to move material, parts, 
tools, or specialized devices in a manufacturing process by means of vari- 
able-programmed motions. 

By dictionary definition, a robot is "an automatic apparatus or de- 
vice that performs functions ordinarily ascribed to human beings or op- 
erates with what appears to be almost human intelligence." 

The majority of present-day robots are a far cry from the popular sci- 
ence-fiction visions of robots that walk, talk, have emotions, experience 
pain, tell bad jokes, tell lies, get in the way, and come to the rescue. 

But now a new breed of mechanical beings is emerging on the 
scene — personal robots. 

What's a personal robot? 

To Apple owners a personal robot is a robotic device that is fairly in- 
expensive and can be used with an Apple II or Apple III in the home by a 
single individual. 

In this context, "fairly inexpensive" means priced at under three 
thousand dollars. Through its RS-232C interface an Apple is capable of 
programming many kinds of robotic devices used for manufacturing. 
Interesting things are going on with the industrial applications of robots 
controlled by Apples. The real excitement is just beginning, though — 
robots are coming home. 

For years now, hobbyists and truly inspired hackers have experi- 
mented with homemade robots — essentially microprocessors on mobile 
bases — that offered few real functions and hardly any practical applica- 
tions. The desire of these early robotic pioneers has been to empower the 
computer to do something — to enable it to interact with the outside 
world, not just with the mind of its user. 

Robotics has been, and for some time will continue to be, an evolving 
technology. The only way to achieve progress in the field has been to 
experiment and keep experimenting. This basic fact — that what we have 
today is only a foretaste of what's to come — is true for both industrial 
robotics and personal robots. 

Two of the robots we'll look at in this article— the RB5X and the 
XR-2 — have the letter x in their names to denote that the models are still 
experimental. 

So don't get too excited. Or rather, get excited, but be prepared to 
wait a while for truly cost-effective robots that are useful in the home. 
None of the five robots we'll talk about here can wash windows, walk the 



dog, mow the lawn, clean the pool, or change diapers. None of the 
robots — RB5X, XR-2, Armdroid 1, Tasman Turtle, or Topo — can carry 
on an extended conversation. 

Mechanical Teachers. Most of the robots currently available for 
home use are educational products more than they are household ser- 
vants — though the latter is the goal. By far the largest number of inex- 
pensive robot arms and turtlelike devices is in education — for teaching 
programming and the basics of robotic technology. 

The Tasman Turtle is the latest version of a robotic teaching device 
that's been around for decades in various and sundry forms. Basically, a 
turtle is a mobile, desktop device that can be programmed to move 
around in complicated patterns, mapping its movements on-screen with 
turtle graphics. But, unlike most robotic turtles, the Tasman Turtle 
can talk. 

The two robot arms we'll look at, the XR-2 and the Armdroid 1, could 
conceivably be used in manufacturing but are being touted principally as 
robotic teaching devices. Robotic arms, modeled after the human vari- 
ety — with shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand or manipulator — will 
become parts of multifunctional home robots in the future. By becom- 
ing familiar today with the concepts and technology needed to coordi- 
nate the complex movements of mechanical manipulators, we can pre- 
pare for the future. 

RB5X and Topo are the forebears of the true personal home 
robots — intelligent, mobile, communicative, practical — that may some 
day become a part of daily life. Soon these robots should be able to 
vacuum the floors, guard the house, monitor atmospheric conditions, 
and do many things as yet unimagined. 

Miraculous Mechanicals. Let no misunderstanding arise. The robots 
we have today are truly remarkable. Thirty years ago, this article would 
have been .science fiction of the highest order. 

As a society, we've entered the computer age, and in the high-tech fu- 
ture robots may become our trusted companions. Like cars, computers, 
and telephones, robots will function as extensions of our physical and 
mental selves. Personal robots will give us more free time and, as they be- 
come more intelligent, may truly add something to the human 
experience. 

Gel ready for an all-too-brief journey in a personal robot 
wonderland. 



Androbot 
TOPO 

Topo, from Androbot, comes in an impressive white cardboard 
box — four feet tall and a few feet wide. Half an hour after opening the 
box and removing the thirty-three-pound plastic and steel robot, it's pos- 
sible to have the little fellow up and running with either joystick or 
keyboard control. 

Looking like a cubist's rendering of the modern man, Topo is the 
only currently available robot that could be described as humanoid in 
shape. Its superficial resemblance to a human is reflective of its limited 
mental abilities — we're still years away from a walking, talking, think- 
ing, and performing humanoid robot with human intelligence. 

We must be patient. Two years ago nothing like Topo or his soon-to- 
be-released cousin B.O.B. was available. Unless you were a hobbyist — 
building your own robots — the only robotic products available to you 
for the Apple were the Terrapin Turtle and Muse's game RobotWar. 
Now, two years later, there are literally dozens of robotic avenues you 
can explore on the Apple. Two years from now, there could be 
hundreds. 

An Andro What? Topo is the easiest of the current batch of personal 
robots to relate to. Currently mute and sensorless, by October Topo 
should have voice synthesis capabilities and a wireless infrared digital 
communications link. The basic unit available now is capable of many 
different entertaining and educational functions and provides an enjoy- 
able introduction to the potential of personal robots. 

Topo is controlled at this point through a remote radio link that con- 
nects to the Apple via an expansion board in slot 5. 

The robot moves around on two wheels, with separate drive motors 
for each. Power to the motors is supplied by on-board batteries, and the 
robot is usually charged and ready to go when it's delivered. The bat- 
teries are easily recharged using the battery charger included with the 
robot. 

Topo's power is turned on and off by means of pushbuttons on its 
back panel. The robot has two plastic side flaps that fold out and can 



AUGUST 1983 S C) 1^ T A UTfe 147 




hold lightweight objects. 

The easiest thing to make Topo do is move around in response to a 
joystick. The robot comes with a disk containing several Basic programs 
that are easily accessed from preprogrammed subroutines. The joystick 
routine allows you to move Topo anywhere you like within a radius of 
seventy-five feet. 

Topo is ruggedly built, but he's only as smart as his owner. It's up to 
the owner to keep the robot from smashing into the wall or falling down 
stairs. Topo can be stopped immediately by pressing the panel on top of 
his head, which turns off the whole mechanism. This is particularly use- 
ful when you're using preprogrammed Basic or Logo routines. Topo 
moves along at a brisk pace and can quickly go astray if the user/pro- 
grammer hasn't planned out a clear path. 

Programming Topo in its TopoBasic is a snap, even for those who 
aren't terribly familiar with the ways and wherefores of gosubs and for- 
next loops. The commands are easy to remember — TFD moves Topo 
forward; TBK moves Topo back; TRT turns Topo right; TLT turns 
Topo left. Extended movements are possible through the commands 
TFDX, TBKX, TLTX, and so on. These commands can be used as sub- 
routines with variable inputs. For instance, typing N = 200 and then 
GOSUB 5100 (the subroutine TFD) causes Topo to move forward two 
hundred steps. 

Dance of the Androbot. It's possible to do some interesting things 
with Topo and its Basic. You can make the robot travel in a figure eight, 
a circle, and other geometric shapes. You can make Topo perform a little 
dance with the TSTEP, TSTOP, TSTEPSTOP, TCOUNT, and TSET 
routines, which allow precise control of each of the robot's wheels. 

At any point, it's possible to calibrate Topo's motors to have more 
precise turning angles and movement increments by accessing a simple 
TopoBasic subroutine. This comes in handy because Topo's inertia and 
the surface he's traveling on can affect the precision of his motion. 

Topo also works with Androbot's special version of Logo — Topo- 
Logo. The TopoBasic commands of TFD, TLT, and so on have been in- 
corporated as procedures — modular program units. Regular English 
words are used whenever possible and allow the easy construction of 
fairly complex programs. For instance, the line REPEAT 4 [TFD 50 
TRT 90] causes Topo to move in a path the shape of a square. 

You can define your own procedures with TopoLogo in the edit 



mode. Typing in TO SQUARE and REPEAT 4 [TFD 50 TRT 90] 
creates a procedure called SQUARE that you can recall and insert in a 
program as you see fit. 

TopoLogo includes a variation on turtle graphics, wherein a line 
drawing of Topo's movements is sent to the Apple's screen. Using either 
joystick or keyboard control — both are possible with TopoLogo — you 
can instruct Topo to move while you watch his path on the screen. You 
can define the size of the room that the robot is exploring; if the value 
you supply is too small, then Topo's graphic path will wrap around on- 
screen, creafing confusion. 

It's possible simply to draw pictures with Topo and TopoLogo 
graphics or to do interesting things like drawing maps of your house by 
leading Topo around the edges of rooms and around obstacles such as 
tables and chairs. 

Go Forth, Young Bot. In addition to TopoBasic and'TopoLogo, the 
robot can also be programmed with TopoForth, a language offering Lo- 
golike turtle graphics and a versadle programming environment. 
Forth — the most popular motion-control language in industrial robo- 
tics — is very fast and its memory requirements are modest. 

The manual for Topo is easy to follow and contains listings of the 
TopoBasic programs. The manual makes it easy to get started and, at the 
same time, encourages the user to experiment with programming. Kids 
should have no trouble using it. 

Topo is a very entertaining way to learn about computers and pro- 
gramming right now. For the young in age and the young at heart, it can 
be the ultimate game and educational peripheral. In the near future, 
when it is equipped with speech synthesis and such accessories as the An- 
dro Wagon — a small cart that attaches to Topo's backside, due out this 
month — Topo will be even more attractive. (Yes, Topo could even serve 
drinks to your guests.) 

Androbot, under the visionary guidance of Atari's founder Nolan 
Bushnell, is promofing the notion of personal robots in the home with 
gusto. The basic Topo unit just described is only the beginning of what 
promises to be an ever-increasing line of home robotic systems. 

The goal of an autonomous robot — one that you could program to 
perform a task, put in a room, and walk away from — will be realized 
with another Androbot product expected to be released at the beginning 
of next year. 

Although outwardly similar to Topo, B.O.B. (brains on board) is a 
more sophisticated and functional robot. B.O.B. supports two Intel 8086 
microprocessors and features three megabytes of operating capacity. 
B.O.B. is programmed with ACL (Androbot control language) — which 
has some of the characteristics of Forth — via an Apple (or any other key- 
board with an RS-232C interface) acting as an ASCII terminal. 

B.O.B. will be equipped with the AndroBus, which facilitates the easy 
expansion of the robot. The company is following the philosophy evi- 
dent in the Apple II: Provide for plenty of expansion capabilities from 
the start. Eventually, B.O.B. will be programmable with plug-in car- 
tridges. The cartridges will be available not long after B.O.B. is released. 

Androbot's Big Boy. B.O.B. will have ultrasonic sensors for deter- 
mining the position and range of objects, as well as infrared sensors for 
avoiding objects or following a human. B.O.B. will have a speech syn- 
thesizer chip and will offer users the option of building up its vocabu- 
lary. It will be possible to program the robot to recognize your voice and 
follow simple instructions. 

Androbot plans to offer opfional hardware accessories, such as the 
AndroFridge — a device for storing canned drinks that B.O.B. can use 
without assistance. At the summer Consumer Electronics Show in 
Chicago, B.O.B. impressed the crowds by fetching a can of beer from the 
AndroFridge and bringing it to an Androbot employee. With Andro- 
Sentry, one of the planned plug-in cartridges, B.O.B. will reportedly be 
able to patrol and safeguard your house. 

Androbot's F.R.E.D. (friendly robotic educational device) is a tur- 
tlelike robot small enough to fit on a table top. With a drawing-pen at- 
tachment and a voice synthesizer, F.R.E.D. is similar to educational 
robots of the past and to the present-day Tasman Turtle. Using a joy- 
stick, the Apple's keyboard, or a completely separate infrared controller, 
adults and children alike can learn the basics of programming and robot 
intelligence. F.R.E.D. will have software similar to Topo's and should be 
available toward the end of 1983.

Rhino Robots 

XR-2 



X he XR-2, from Rhino Robots, is a tabletop robot arm designed for 
education, research, and industrial planning. As such, it may seem a Httle 
out of place in an article about home robots. Still, an understanding of 
the technologies governing the operation and programming of robotic 
arms is essential if we are to realize the dream of a functional home ro- 
bot that could simplify our lives. 

Made of aircraft-grade aluminum, the XR-2 is reasonably light- 
weight — a little under thirty pounds — and it has no riveted parts so it's 
easy to disassemble for investigative and educational purposes. The 
robot arm requires a separate power supply and controller for its stan- 
dard six motors. Rhino provides such a controller, which can also handle 
two more motors for such additional devices as a chain-belt conveyor tor 
bringing parts within reach of the robot and a linear slide base for mov- 
ing the whole robot along a horizontal axis. 

The XR-2 stands approximately thirty inches high when the arm is 
fully extended vertically and has a reach of approximately twenty-two 
inches when the arm is fully extended horizontally. The robot is thirteen 
inches wide. 

Meeting Mechanical Arms. A robot arm like the XR-2 is modeled 
after the human arm, but the mechanical version is necessarily lacking in 
fluidity, speed, and maneuverability. The XR-2 has a shoulder, an el- 
bow, a wrist, and a hand or manipulator. The arm sits on a base, which 
can rotate 270 degrees. The shoulder can rotate 180 degrees, the elbow 
270 degrees. By comparison, most humans can rotate their forearms via 
the elbow joint only 180 degrees. And whereas the wrist rotation of the 
XR-2 is 270 degrees, human wrists are hard put to reach 180 degrees. 
The XR-2's hand can also rotate around the vertical axis of the wrist 
(imagine being able to unscrew your hand at the wrist). 

Humans are definitely ahead of the game in hands, though. TheXR- 
2 hand features two metal fingers, capable of grasping certain objects, 
but with nowhere near the complexity and versatility of the human 
kind, in fact, the task of creating more humanlike hands is one of the 
great challenges facing robotic researchers in the decades ahead. 

Each of the XR-2's six motors — controlling the base, shoulder, 
elbow, wrist, hand, and the fingers of the hand — is equipped with opti- 
cal encoders, making the system what is called a "closed loop system." 
The optical encoders are circular metal plates with holes in them that 
interrupt an optical beam, thus providing information on how far a 
motor has moved and in what direction. 

Rhino provides the controller/power supply and interface card 
necessary to begin working with the X R-2. The peripheral card is a CCS 
77I0A RS-232C interface and fits into slot number 2 on the Apple II. Six 
cables connect the robot's motors to the controller, and an RS-232C 
cable connects the Apple interface card to the controller. 

The CCS 771 OA card is a language card, with software already written 



on modifiable EPROMs; so you don't even need software to get up and 
running on the XR-2. After connecting everything up and booting IDOS, 
you simply type PR#2 and the robot should be ready to accept your 
Basic commands. 

The firmware on the card allows for six commands not normally part 
of Basic's repertoire— "&HOME", "&STEP X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X", 
"&IF X THEN:", "&WAIT X", "&READ X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X", and 
"&CLEAR". The &STEP and &READ commands both require that 
all eight variables — corresponding to the maximum eight-motor outputs 
on the controller — be defined before the commands can be used. 

There's No Place Like Home. The &HOME command executes 
what is called a "hard home" routine. The home position is a prepro- 
grammed placement of the base, shoulder, and elbow joints. When pro- 
gramming the XR-2 it's desirable always to be starting from the same 
position. 

The &STEP X,X. . . . command is used to start moving each of the 
robot's six standard motors a fixed number of steps simultaneously. The 
command does not ensure that each motor will take the same time for its 
move; those motors that have only a short way to go will get done be- 
fore the motors that have a long way to go. Coordinated moves can be 
made by breaking the command up into smaller, evenly spaced 
commands. 

The X R-2's &IF X THEN: command is like the standard Basic com- 
mand, except that it must have a colon at the end and the condition must 
be stated on the same line after the colon. The X variable symbolizes one 
of the six motors and corresponds to the six microswitches associated 
with the six ports on the XR-2's controller. The command is used to 
monitor these six switches and make appropriate responses to them. If 
the called microswitch is depressed, the condition after the colon will be 
executed. 

The &WAIT command is used to enter a pause into the operation on 
the robot. The &READ X,X. . . command reads the encoders and de- 
termines the distance each axis has moved from the position when these 
counters were last cleared. The clearing is done with the &CLEAR 
command. 

The XR-2 takes a little time to get to know. The base, body, and arm 
of the robot are open to view, so you can see the dc servo motors that 
drive the various axes and how they connect to the bicyclelike drive 
chains. The makers encourage you to take it apart and see how it works. 

Horn of Plenty. Rhino offers several software packages that run with 
the XR-2 and the Apple II. The Rhino-Rite-A program is designed to 
allow the XR-2 to print two lines of letters or numbers using a felt tip 
pen. Rasp #1 is a package of four programs that offer single-axis move- 
ment and multiple-axis movement. There is also a teaching program that 
enables you to lead the XR-2 through a series of multiple axes moves and 
then repeat these moves. A fourth program coordinates the robot along 
XYZ Cartesian coordinates. 

Rhino sells the XR-2 by itself or as part of a package containing an 
Apple He or Apple III and all the attendant hardware. The company 
also offers several attachments, including different manipulators and a 
handheld teach pendant.

Flexible Systems 
TASMAN TURTLE 

The manual for the Tasman Turtle calls the robot "your new pet." 
After a day or two, you'll realize that no pet was ever like the Tasman 
Turtle. 

The smallest of the mobile robots, the Tasman Turtle will work 
equally well on the kitchen floor or the kitchen table — basically any sur- 
face that is hard and flat will do. Designed to be used as an educational 
device, the Tasman Turtle combines the drawing and moving features of 
past turtles with the ability to talk through voice synthesis. 

The genesis of the Tasman Turtle occurred in the seventies at the 
Elizabeth Computing Centre in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. Working 
there in the late seventies, Allan C. Branch designed the Tasman Mini- 
mum Turtle, which in 1981 was introduced to the Australian market; 
Flexible Systems was established to manufacture and market the device. 

The Tasman Turtle was first equipped with voice synthesis last year, 
and, at the same time. Harvard Associates was formed to market and dis- 
tribute the educational robot in the United States. The turtle is also dis- 
tributed in Canada, New Zealand, New Guinea, Hong Kong, South 
Africa, Japan, and Singapore. 

Touchee Turtle. Looking like some kind of surveillance or repair 
"droid" you'd expect to see in a Star Wars film, the Tasman Turtle has a 
clear plastic cover shaped like a dome. 

At the base of the dome is a slightly bigger plastic ring that serves as 
the outer edge of the round robot. The ring sits loose in the robot's 
frame, and, when pushed against it, gives a little. When pushed 
hard enough the ring trips one of four sensors. It's possible to program 
the Tasman Turtle so that it reacts in a certain way when one of the sen- 
,sors is tripped by an obstacle. 

The robot travels around by means of two small rubber wheels. It's 
not a speed demon — how many turtles do you know that are? A sepa- 
rate power supply is needed to power the robot. 



The Tasman Turtle can move forward and 
backward and turn left or right. Through the 
plastic-dome covering you can see the motors, the 
robot's body, and the hardware boards that al- 
low it to be controlled by a computer. Two small 
green lights serve as the robot's "eyes" — they 
don't see anything, but they do blink on and off 
(depending on what's going on in the program). 
Between the eyes are four red lights that corre- 
spond to each of the four sensors activated by the 
outer ring. Below the eyes is the speaker, through 
which the Tasman Turtle talks. 

At the apex of the dome is a circular row of 
yellow lights, the turtle's compass (available as an 
optional attachment). At the center of the ro- 
bot's body is the mechanism that raises and low- 
ers a felt tip pen when you're using the turtle to 
draw. The robot also features a programmable 
electronic horn that sounds like it's reminding 
you to put on your seat belt. 

The interface card for the Tasman Turtle is 
designed to go in slot 2 of the Apple. The card is 
connected to the power supply with a single wire 
and the card is connected to the turtle with a sin- 
gle ribbon cable. The Tasman Turtle is not au- 
tonomous; it must be connected up to the com- 
puter with the ribbon cable at all times. 

Tasmanian Devil, Like Topo, the Tasman 
Turtle comes with its own indigenous software. It 
also is compatible with Terrapin Logo. Booting 
the Tasman Turtle Control Software disk is the 
best way to get started. 

One of the demonstration programs on the 
Tasman disk allows you to control the turtle with one-letter com- 
mands — F (forward six inches), B (back six inches), R (pivot right forty- 
five degrees), U (pen up), D (pen down), and so on. Another program 
lets you use the robot's horn to make sounds like those used to signify 
the dots and dashes of Morse code. 

Once you're acquainted with the robot's features, you're ready to start 
programming it with Tasman's Turtle Talk commands. All commands 
must be prefixed with the ampersand symbol. Most of the commands are 
one letter and some require a variable. For example, typing &F 10 causes 
the turtle to move forward ten steps — one step is equal to about one 
millimeter. 

The Turtle Talk commands can be used in a Basic program or in 
immediate mode. In the latter, it's possible to set up a whole string of 
commands separated by colons. For instance, the line 

&D:&F30:&R90:&F30:&R90:&F30:&R90:&F30:&R90:&U 

instructs the robot to put its pen down on the paper, travel in the shape 
of a square, and then lift the pen up again. Assuming you've put a piece 
of paper under the robot, it should draw a perfect square. 

Tasmanian Turtle Graphics. Using the MIT (Terrapin or Krell) ver- 
sion of Logo, it's possible to explore turtle graphics and speech synthesis 
with the Tasman Turtle. Creating procedures that can be defined and 
used in larger programs is accomplished in the same way as it was with 
Topo. 

With Logo, the Tasman Turtle can display its movements graphical- 
ly on the Apple's screen. Program options allow you, at any time, to con- 
trol only the actual turtle, only the screen turtle, or both. 

The Tasman Turtle with Logo currently has a vocabulary of approx- 
imately three hundred spoken words — including each letter of the alpha- 
bet and many numerical words for use in creating long numbers. Each of 
these words is assigned a number. The command for instructing the ro- 
bot to say a word is SAY x, where x is the number of the word you want 
spoken. For example, typing SAY 132 causes the robot to say the word 
space. 

With the SAYL command it's possible to make the Tasman Turtle 
speak a list of words as a sentence. Typing SAYL [34 138 30 235 227 2

138 255] causes the robot to proclaim, "See the million press onward to 
the south." The SAYL command also enables you to combine prefixes 
with root words to make new words. For instance, typing SAYL [72 
106] — 72 is the word centi and 106 is meter — produces the word 
centimeter. 

Two further word-creating commands are not included with the 
package, but a listing of the brief Logo programs needed to construct 
them is included in the manual. These two commands are EW and SW 
and they work in similar ways — instructing the robot to say a word and 
insert a silence either at the beginning or at the end of the word. These 
commands make it possible to create new words by splicing together 
parts of existing words. For instance, the line EW 147 50 should result in 
the word arms. The EW command cuts off the beginning of word 147, 
alarm, and then picks up word 50, the letter S. 

Turtle Teacher. The Tasman Turtle is not an expensive toy that 
you'll tire of in a day or two. With its already ample features and the abil- 
ity it gives you to program more of your own, the Tasman Turtle has tre- 
mendous potential as a learning tool. Combining movement, sensors, 
drawing, speaking, and the other features in one program is quite an ac- 
complishment. 

The recommended tack if you want to explore the Tasman Turtle is 
to put yourself in the mind of the turtle. The fact that a robot is only as 
smart as you make it is a general rule that may never change. The first 
step in making a machine do your bidding is to know how the machine 
thinks and how it relates to the world. The Tasman Turtle offers an easy 
and entertaining way to explore these concepts. 

Flexible Systems, through Harvard Associates, is planning to release 
more robotic products in the United States soon. A smaller version of 
the Tasman Turtle, geared more toward the home, is in the works. And 
soon there should be a vision system and a robotic arm for the present 
Tasman Turtle, as well as increased speaking abilities, including a larger 
vocabulary that may offer foreign words. 

CoLNE Robotics 
ARMDROID 1 

^^rmdroid 1 has a soft touch. If the application you have in mind is 
the mass production of doughnuts, this reasonably inexpensive robot 
arm may be just what you need. 

Armdroid 1, produced in England by Colne Robotics, is less mus- 
cular than Rhino's XR-2. It features the same five axes of rotation as the 
XR-2, however, as well as a more versatile three-finger hand. Aimed at 
the hobbyist and robotic educator/student /researcher, Armdroid 1 can 
be purchased either as a kit or fully assembled. 

Arming Your Apple for the Future. Armdroid 1 requires a separate 
power supply to drive its six stepper motors. The orange, string-and- 
rubber-belt-driven arm rotates 360 degrees on its base, 180 degrees at the 
shoulder and wrist, and 270 degrees at the elbow. The three-finger grip- 
per rotates 360 degrees around the vertical axis of the wrist, providing 
both yaw and pitch. A continuous path machine, Armdroid 1 can move 
along several axes at once and do a series of separate moves. 

An interface card and connecting cable provided by Colne plugs into 
slot 1 on the Apple II. The cable connects into the base of Armdroid 1. 
The robot's power is supplied by a connecting cable to the separate 
power supply. 

Currently, a menu-driven general-purpose program on disk is 
included with Armdroid 1 . This program enables the user to lead the arm 
through a desired path point by point, location by location. These points 
are symbolized by five-digit numbers, and moves are accomplished with 
single key.strokes. 

Once you've defined the home position at the beginning of opera- 
tions, any new points are expressed in numbers relating to the individual 
motor's distance from the home position. It's recommended that the user 
decide on a home position and always move the robot into that position 
manually before starting up. 

When you first connect up the Armdroid 1 and boot up the soft- 
ware, it's fun to fool around with the "insert a point" option. You walk 
the arm through a series of moves along any or all of its five axes. The 



T A L 1^ AUGUST 1983" 

program can store a series of points, which can be saved to disk, but it 
won't save any points unless you tell it to. 

A point is considered the present location of the arm, and the next 
point is the next location designated by the robot's operator. Once 
you've walked the robot through a task, it's simple to save the points and 
have the robot repeat the moves, provided you start it from the home 
position. Any unwanted points can be easily taken out with an edit func- 
tion. Armdroid 1 is not really programmable in the usual sense on the 
Apple. 

Nevertheless, the Armdroid 1 is a good way to experience the chal- 
lenges of programming the movements of a robot arm. For example, if 
you walk a robot through a movement, you end up with a starting point 
and an ending point. Now suppose there is a six-inch obstacle that the 
robot must pass over to reach the end point. If you've saved only the be- 
ginning and end points, the robot will collide with the obstacle. You can 
perform other interesting educational exercises with Armdroid 1. 

Colne Robotics set up an impressive demonstration program at a 
recent robot convention (InteRobot '83 — held June 14—16 in Long 
Beach, California). In that demo, the Armdroid I's three-fingered hand 
held an eyedropper. The robot first took a little water into the eye- 
dropper from a small glass container. The arm then moved over to a row 




of test tubes, dropping the water into the first test tube in the row. The 
robot then got more water and delivered it to the next test tube. The 
robot didn't spill a drop all afternoon. 

With a little patience, and a few extra eggs, you could probably pro- 
gram an Armdroid 1 to load eggs into a pan of boiling water. 

The Armdroid Strikes Back. Colne Robotics says it will release the 
Armdroid 2 either late this year or early next year. The newer version 
will have seven axes of movement, each with its own Z-80 processor. 
Armdroid 2 will be more powerful, able to lift four pounds as opposed 
to the Armdroid I's limit of three hundred grams. 

The Armdroid 2 will also feature an inexpensive vision system. A 
camera measuring three inches long and one and a half inches wide will 
provide an image thirty-two pixels by thirty-two pixels. The vision sys- 
tem is meant more for educational use than as an industrial-grade de- 
vice, because the low resolution will enable the robot to recognize only a 
limited range of objects. A slightly more expensive version will feature 
encoders on the motors, making Armdroid 2 a closed loop system. 

Colne Robotics is also planning to release the Zeaker — a turtlelike 
device — late this year. Zeaker will be a two-wheel robot, with a simple 
tactile sensing system and a pen attachment so that it can draw a picture 
as it moves around. With a specially configured parallel card, Zeaker 
will be programmable with the Apple II.

RB Robot 

RB5X 



.B5X, from RB Robot Corporation, looks like R2-D2's little 
brother. Bullet-shaped, mobile by means of two separately driven wheels, 
RB5X is as charming as R2-D2 on the outside, but it's not likely to get 
involved in any far-flung rebellions, at least not quite yet. 

Designed for the home, the classroom, and light industrial environ- 
ments. RB5X is the harbinger of future autonomous personal robots that 
speak, hear, and perform a variety of useful functions. The current ver- 
sion of RB5X is still in the experimental stages and is being improved all 
the time. But the basic unit is designed to be expanded, so if you picked 
up one tomorrow, you wouldn't miss out on all the goodies to come. 

LED Wars. The top of RB5X is a clear plastic dome through which 
you can see a transparent plate that holds several LEDs. The green 
LEDs indicate the direction in which either of the two motors is going. 
The red LEDs correspond to the eight bumper sensors that girdle the 
robot about a third of the way up its outer shell. If you press one of the 
bumpers, the corresponding red LED lights up. 

When you look through the clear plastic plate that holds the LEDs, you 
see the hardware bus that facilitates further expansion of RB5X. The ro- 
bot's on-board processor. National Semiconductor's INS8073, is in one 
slot. Another slot is slated to hold extended memory, and there are four 
additional slots through which to connect other boards. 

On the front of the robot's body, beneath its name plate, is a sonar 
sensor for detecting obstacles at a distance. Below that are two brass 
charging pins that recharge RBSX's onboard batteries. On the back of the 
robot is an interface plate that houses the RS-232C connector, reset but- 
ton, and power switch. 

RB5X communicates with your Apple via the computer's RS-232C 
interface and a communications package, such as Southwestern Data 
Systems's ASCII Express Professional. The user must provide the re- 
quired interface card, such as Apple's Super Serial Card or others com- 
monly available, and the terminal .software. You can experiment with 
different baud rates, but the company recommends 1200 baud. 

You communicate with RB5X in Tiny Basic. A few additional com- 
mands are needed to establish communication between the Apple and 
RB5X, and these are covered in the manual. 

Once you've interfaced the Apple and the robot, it's simply a matter 
of downloading instructions to the robot via an RS-232C cable. As soon 
as the instructions have been downloaded, you just unplug the interface 



cable and away goes RB5X. 

Three Tiny Reasons. Tiny Basic is a version of Basic that lacks such 
features as arrays or real number arithmetic. It's a special-purpose ma- 
chine control language that should pose no problem to someone who is 
already familiar with regular Basic. RB Robot chose Tiny Basic for three 
reasons: It allows direct access to memory for fast input and output; it 
permits accurate timing; and it has a built-in random number generator. 

Tiny Basic allows you to create your own programs. Also, RB5X 
comes with a disk that contains several demonstration programs de- 
signed to familiarize you with the robot's unique features. 

RB5X learns by what is called "evolutionary adaptive machine in- 
telligence," a term coined by hobby robotics author David L. Heiser- 
man in his book Robot Intelligence with Experiments. Heiserman's 
scheme breaks robot programming down into three levels of machine in- 
telligence: the Alpha-class, the Beta-class, and the Gamma-class. 

An Alpha-class robot responds to its environment with pure reflex 
action. When you run RB5X's Alpha-class demonstration program, the 
robot moves forward until one of its bumpers or its sonar detects an ob- 
stacle; it then moves away from the obstacle, randomly choosing a new 
direction. A Beta-class robot acts randomly at the start, but it gradually 
learns its environment. This learning happens through the repetition of 
moves that result in either successful or unsuccessful reponses and the 
Beta-class robot's ability to remember successful responses. A Gamma- 
class robot has memory and the ability to generalize — to formulate theo- 
retical knowledge of the future. 

In the near future, RB5X's creators hope to have Gamma-class in- 
telligence for the robot. In the meantime, the Alpha and Beta demo pro- 
grams on the disk provided with the robot are an excellent introduction 
to the mysteries of machine intelligence. 

One of the most promising features of the RB5X is its ability to seek 
out its own recharger pack and plug itself in. The robot is equipped with 
a separate battery charger that plugs into the wall and sits on the floor. 
The charger consists of two curved copper strips attached to a small 
metal box a little wider than the robot. The robot is equipped with a low- 
battery sensor circuit that tells it when the charge is low. 

Charge of the Robot. It's possible to make RB5X find its own way to 
the charger. This is done by putting down a strip of tape that contrasts 
with the color of the floor — light tape for a dark floor and vice versa. The 
tape should lead from the edge of the charger into the middle of the 
room in a straight line. By means of its light/dark infrared sensor, RB5X 
can locate the tape and follow it to the charger. The robot will press its 
two copper charging pins against the metal strips of the charger auto- 
matically and one of its sensors will indicate when this is accomplished. 

RB5X is equipped with voice synthesis and voice recognition. It can 
talk to you and you can talk back to it. Using the sixty-four phonemes 
supplied on a standard speech synthesis chip, you can create just about 
any word in any language. RB Robot Corporation is in the process of 
improving the voice-recognition aspect of the robot and should have a 
newer system out later this year. 

Among the many new features that RB Robot plans for the RB5X in 
the near future is a robotic arm that will attach to where the plastic LED 
plate is currently located. The arm will come with an extension to the 
shell, raising the overall height of the robot, and will be able to lift 
weights of twelve ounces as well as to reach around the robot's back and 
turn it off. 

One home robot application we've all been dreaming of will be 
possible later this year when RB5X's vacuum cleaner attachment is made 
available. Currently still in the testing stage, the vacuum unit will attach 
to the back of RB5X near the ring of bumper sensors. With the proper 
programming and preparation on the part of the human operator, it'll be 
possible to turn RB5X on, walk out of the room, and come back after 
half an hour to a clean carpet. No kidding! 

Looking for the Right Script. RB Corporation has just announced 
the soon-to-be-available Robot Control Language (RCL) and Savvy, a 
tool for developing scripts, or programs, that are written in a high-level 
Sawv-like language, compiled into Tiny Basic, and then downloaded to 
the robot. The program development tool was created for RB Robot by 
Excalibur Technologies, the originators of Savvy. 

Also due out this year is Logo compatibility for RB5X and the RB 
Trailer, a small cart by which the robot can haul lightweight objects. The 



AUGUST 1983

robot will also be programmable with plug-in EPROMs this year. 

Last but not least, RB5X will have an optional fire extinguisher attach- 
ment, available late this year or early next. With a powerful heat-detect- 
ing sensor, the robot will be able to distinguish between varying heat 
sources such as sunlit spots in a room, a living creature, and a fire. If it 
detects a fire, a small flap on the side of the robot will open up and a fire 
extinguisher will douse the flames. 

i^t present, personal robots are one of the most expensive periph- 
erals you can buy for your Apple. The five robots discussed up to now 
range in price from around five hundred dollars to upward of three 
thousand. But the price situation will change for the better in the years to 
come. Just as computers have come down in price even as their capabil- 
ities have increased, personal robots will also become more affordable 
once the demand warrants it and the technology becomes more ac- 
cessible. 

We must be patient. 

Three-Mile Bot. For the adventuresome — the robotic hobbyists 
among us — there are many exciting alternatives to explore. One such al- 
ternative involves combining currently available systems into something 
more than the individual elements. A robotic hobbyist can become, in ef- 
fect, a fiedgling Dr. Frankenstein — creating "life" from a number of 
dead parts. 

Russell Swannuck is one young robot hobbyist who actually saw his 
creation go on to perform a practical function. About a year and a half 
ago, Swannuck developed an idea for a mobile robot with a robotic arm 
attached. 

With the help of his father, Swannuck acquired a Microbot-5 ro- 
botic arm and attached it to a radio-controlled mobile base. Using an 
Apple II, Swannuck programmed the robot arm to perform simple tasks. 
Through his father's business, Swannuck found out that the General 
Public Utilities Corporation (GPU) — which operated the Three Mile Is- 
land nuclear power plant near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and was in 
charge of cleaning up at the plant after the accident in March 1979 — was 
looking for a device similar to what he had created. 

GPU eventually purchased Swannuck's robot and used it to explore 



contaminated areas of the damaged power plant. Operators instructed 
the robot while watching its point of view on a monitor displaying the 
image from a video camera attached to the robot arm. Swannuck had al- 
so written software so that the encoders on the arm would send a graphic 
representation of the arm's position to the Apple screen. 

Swannuck's robot served GPU faithfully for months at Three Mile 
Island. Swannuck has since gone on to other things — college and a re- 
seardi job, where he's investigating robotics and cybernetics and their sig- 
nificance to the handicapped. 

Meanwhile Microbot, the company that produced the Microbot-5 
arm used by Swannuck, is still producing robot arms that run with the 
Apple and other RS-232C-compatible devices. Current products are the 
MiniMover, the TeachMover, and the Alpha. 

Personal Robotic Future. The idyllic scene on the cover of this issue 
is meant to symbolize the potential of personal robots. The gentle- 
man playing chess against a robotic challenger is surrounded by his other 
home robots — personal companions, helpers, and advisors. The picture 
is meant to stimulate your imagination, while dramatizing the compati- 
bility of humans and robots. 

For those of us who just can't wait for the future, the hobbyist scene 
is bound to prove interesting. But not everyone can relate to the chal- 
lenge of actually assembling a mechanical being. Programming one that's 
already built is tough enough for most. 

Robotics technology is not easy to grasp. That is why we have edu- 
cational personal robots like the Tasman Turtle, XR-2, RB5X, Arm- 
droid 1, and Topo. Soon, when B.O.B. and the fully equipped RB5X are 
available, we'll start to see the real McCoy — robots that perform useful 
tasks in the home. We can meet the future on equal terms by learning 
about it now.

AUGUST 1983 



This may be a bit late in coming. I'm almost positive that, for the 
most part, if you are a reader of Softalk you have already passed the 
point where the wealth of information and wisdom contained in this ar- 
ticle will be of value to you. In fact, that it got this far is testimony to 
either the dearth of material necessary to feed the monthly furnaces of 
this magazine or the indifference of the editor toward journalistic 
judiciousness. 

Then again, on the assumption that there is hand-me-down value to 
Softalk, chances are good that this copy might well fall into the hands of 
one who is standing where we have all at one time stood — on square one. 
It is to this individual that I dedicate the valuable substance of (1) justify- 
ing the purchase of a computer to (a) him or herself or to (b) a mate, and 
(2) sneaking it into the house without causing too much commotion. 

Justiflcation. When I wish to demonstrate my prowess as an im- 
pulse buyer, I find I'd be much more comfortable if I could shore this up 
with the supernatural power of a financial wizard. Unfortunately, neither 
of the two share any concurrence within my character. Fact of the mat- 
ter is that one is totally nonexistent, so I live in a fantasy world wherein I 
try to limit my impulses to under one dollar. This doesn't always work — 
witness that computer sitting over there. 

Why impulse-buy a computer, of all things, you ask? I wish I had a 
sensible answer. Sales resistance, a property of which I have an over- 
abundance, has nothing to do with it. I decided that I wanted a comput- 
er more than almost anything else long before I ever went into the store. 

Consider the scenario — I am in a field of employment where a busi- 
ness computer ranks in priority right behind an antitank cannon. A 
home-style computer, so useful in managing the monthly budget, finds 
me totally devoid of any such budget. The computer's forte is math and I 
don't know math from a hole in the ground. My only mathematical re- 
quirement is the reconciliation of a monthly bank statement, and the 
bank seems to be doing all that for me, perhaps out of sympathy. I have 
no children at hand to subject to the computer's incredible ability to 
teach, and I certainly don't need further education, knowing everything 
as well as I do. 

Therefore, armed with these facts, you can see why I needed a com- 
puter. I had to have one. And, by forgoing meals for the next four years, 
I found that I could justify buying one. 

Sneaking It In. About a year ago, I hauled two very large boxes into 
the house as quietly as 1 could, in hopes she wouldn't notice their arrival. 
She did. 

"Now what? More toys?" She has this insane attitude regarding my 
inability to reach full maturity. 

"It's sort of a . . . calculator." I tried to stand in front of the two 
cartons. 

"A calculator comes in two boxes? I thought they were supposed to 
be getting smaller?" She peered around me and spotted the name "Ap- 
ple." I do wish those packaging pjeople would be a bit less flagrant about 
the way they mark up their boxes. "I thought Apple only made 
computers. . . ." 

Item: Never marry a girl who reads. 

"Aah, but you can calculate on them, if you so desire." I threw the 
full weight of my logic at her. "And you can do a whole raft of other 
things, as well." 

"How much, ace?" 

I had to move fast. "Take recipes, for example. You can store all 
your recipes on this machine. Just think of it — every recipe you ever had 
can be. . . ." 

"How much?" 

Realizing that the simple, domesticated part of her brain could prob- 
ably run circles around a computer when it came to recipe storage, I tried 
a different tack. "And it's the world's greatest file cabinet. Anything you

I, 






I suppose I needn't go into the graphic details about causing yet 
another rift in a tenuous marriage arrangement, nor the ensuing cold and 
ominously silent dinner with which I was provided that evening. 

Her attitude gradually softened as she considered my string of past 
follies, like the rusted Civil War musket I picked up at a yard sale or the 
clarinet I plan on learning how to play one of these days. Badges of an in- 
veterate impulse buyer. 

Had I everything to do over again, I would modify my sneakiness to 
a finer art. Some suggestions to those of you in like situations might be to 
open all cartons well away from the house, then bring in the equipment a 
piece at a time over a period of a week. It doesn't look quite as expensive 
that way. Some logical, and appeasing, answers to the questions that nat- 
urally follow an Apple's appearance on the scene might be, "Oh, that? 
That's Fred's. He's letting me use it while he's off on a safari trip to Ni- 
geria." Another: "They're thinking of getting one of these at work and 
want me to run a hands-on evaluation before they make any commit- 
ment." A good light-fantasy approach might be; "I know you're not 
going to believe this, but I was selected from thousands to test-market 
this new calculator. ..." Be certain to use the word calculator, since it 
has a less intimidating sound than computer. Disk drives can be ex- 
plained away as being "along the same lines as Junior's thirty-dollar rec- 
ord player." 

But, for God's sake, don't bring flowers or other conciliatory gifts 
after the Apple makes it debut. These only serve to raise questions; that's 
the last thing you want during the so-called formative period. 

More Justification. Perhaps the credence with which I could justify a 
computer best was the potential it had for word processing; and, having 
the stuff within me of a great writer, I patiently explained to the bitter 
half how I could not only write but also edit my stories before putting 
them into hard print. (I have yet to break the news about my needing 
another expensive machine to translate those immortal words to hard 
copy. I would appreciate any suggestions from those of you who have 
gone through similar problems and remained married.) 

Now, in little over a year, I have not only arrived at a mutual under- 
standing with my machine — it certainly understands me a whole lot 
more than I understand it — but I have put it to work for myself in sever- 
al small ways. The attendant manual made the mastery of Basic child's 
play for one of my mental abilities (an IQ equaled only by my glove size) 
and I have since gone on to produce vulgar phrases that will scroll and a 
reasonable facsimile of a yellow horse. None of this, incidentally, seems 
to impress the Loved One and she even refuses to dust the computer. 
Can you imagine my having to dust my own computer? 

In all candor, besides those rudimentary accomplishments, I have ac- 
tually covered a fair portion of the Apple's purchase price with several 
articles and stories — and the Great American Novel is in the wings. But 
the biggest benefit I gained was my newfound respect for a beeping little 
machine whose major output still is "syntax error." It has taught me hu- 
mility and appreciation of an age fast coming upon us. It has made me 
aware of the vital part of life that the computer is beginning to play. It 
has taught me how to dust. 

It has also made me aware of how the computer hucksters miss the 
point entirely. In their haste to demonstrate the miracles a home com- 
puter can perform with file-cabinetry and recipe storage, with teaching 
and math and business applications, they overlook the ability of those 
clever little monsters to challenge the mind. Anybody who has ever 
worked a Sunday crossword or tried to beat Agatha Christie to the 
punch line will be enthralled by a computer. Anyone who loves letting 
the mind run its leash will love a computer. A computer can be very pa- 
tient with its human attendants, no doubt aware of the limitations they 
are faced with, and can easily become a companion when one is up at 
three o'clock in the morning looking for something to do, someone to 
talk with. There are surprises in store at the mere push of a button. 

This is justification of the finest cloth; and, if this sounds like a sales 
pitch, so be it. I regard it more as a tribute. Perhaps in time the veneer 
will wear a bit thin, but that looks to be down the road quite a way. In 
the meantime, I'll just sit back and enjoy this touch of futurism, dust 
and all. 31

Unless otherwise noted, all products can be assumed to run on either Apple

The Incredible Jack. In the last few years the microcomputer has revo- 
lutionized offices by automating tasks that people once thought could 
never be automated. Now, with machines facilitating the storage and re- 
trieval of information, making it easier for managers and others to 
follow, act on, and report trends, it's difficult to be competitive without a 
computer. 

Trouble is, those capabilities are not inherent in the chips of the com- 
puter. In most instances, each task is the responsibility of a different pro- 
gram. And the programs — if you want the best word processor, data- 
base, spreadsheet, and so on — are by different companies with different 
ideas of how to make the computer work best. And they're all pretty 
good ideas, but why should one person have to learn all of them? It's like 
measuring the temperature of your house in Fahrenheit, setting your 
oven with the Celsius scale, and checking out the weather in Kelvin. 
What if you forget which scale is which? 

Maybe the best idea is to take one set of good ideas and apply them 
to all the problems that need solving. That's one of the important con- 
cepts behind both Apple's Lisa and the current bestselling program for 
the IBM pc, 1-2-3. And it's the main idea behind The Incredible Jack. It's 



designed as a jack-of-all-trades for the Apple. 

Unfortunately, if you want the best word processor, the best data- 
base, and the best spreadsheet for the Apple, you're still going to have to 
get three different programs. The jack-of-all-trades can't do any of them 
as well as a specialist. 

It does a pretty good job of mixing the functions, though. And not 
just by passing data back and forth between three interlinked modules: 
Jack really is all one program. And while it doesn't have all the features 
of dedicated programs, it integrates many of the important functions 
beautifully. So once you've learned to write a letter, you know 90 per- 
cent of what it takes to create a form letter. Having mastered that, you 
are close to knowing everything you need to set up a database form. 
Think of a form letter as a specialized database form with more text. Add 
calculation on labeled fields to your repertoire and you've become a jack- 
of-all-trades, with the help of this program and its excellent tutorial. 

The manual and the program never use the word spreadsheet, by the 
way. Their term for what Jack does is calc analysis, but the difference is 
more one of form than function. The fields used are not lined up in rows 
and columns unless you choose to set them up that way. They aren't 
called by row and column coordinates; they use labels instead. Nevertheless, 
you can do very sophisticated calculations on the values in those 
fields. Conditional calculations with an if-then-else format are available. 
Also, calculations can be based on or result in strings. You could set up 
a form letter, for instance, so that an extra paragraph would be inserted if

the data on the recipient met certain conditions. 

The definitions begin to fade into one another with Jack. Take a sim- 
ple business letter. Add a few variable fields to it and it's a form letter. 
Make a few of those fields calculated and it's halfway to being a spread- 
sheet. And you're not moving data from an accounting template into the 
alien environment of a word processor; rather, the word processor file is 
the template. If you have a list of customers in one file, it's simple to pass 
the data from that file into a form letter file. Just make sure the field 
names correspond. 

Jack-of-all-trades is a good description for this versatile program, but 
"incredible" may be putting it a bit strongly. One aspect of the program 
that won't move you to incredulity is the speed. It's written in Pascal, 
which is pretty quick for a high-level language, but Jack may be pushing 
some of Pascal's limits. 

Jack is written to take advantage of the features of the Apple lie, in- 
cluding lower case, eighty columns, and the new keys, but it also works 
on a II Plus using control characters for tabs, cursor movement, shift, 
and shift-lock. There's scarcely a word on hardware compatibility in the 
manual, but it worked with all the eighty-column cards we tried. 

In the final analysis, JTie Incredible Jack won't replace your business 
software library, but it may find a place in it. There are things it can do 
with its amalgam of abilities that can't be done, or at least not easily, with 
any other combination of programs. But because it won't take over your 
heavy-duty word processing, database management, or financial analy- 
sis, it won't eliminate all the different rules you have to learn to get the 
most out of your Apple. Maybe there's a place for Lisa after all. DD

General Ledger. It would seem to take a great deal of presumption to 
call a company State of the Art; with this company, it may simply have 
taken confidence. The company's first offering is worthy of the name. 

General Ledger \s one of eight modules of a complete accounting sys- 
tem; it's the heart of the system. It can be used alone or integrated with 
any of the other modules, such as Accounts Receivable, Sales Invoicing, 
or Accounts Payable. General Ledger uses an accepted double entry ac- 
counting system, and one of its special features prevents any input errors 
by requiring that the daily journal entries be balanced before they can be 
entered into the permanent files. 

The program produces daily, weekly, or monthly reports, including 
the General Ledger Detail Report, Trial Balance, Income Statement, and 
Balance Sheet. It provides the control reports necessary to ensure a com- 
plete audit trail and requires that a printed copy of all of these reports be 
made before updating of permanent files can take place. Compared to 
the hours that might otherwise be spent looking for errors, the tedious- 
ness of printing a complete and accurate audit trail is minor and it may 
well be simply good accounting practice. 

The General Ledger and the reports it provides are a good, simple 
nuts-and-bolts system. Its greatest beneficiary is the new computer user 
who can convert from a manual to a computer accounting system within 
a couple of hours, not only without a nervous breakdown but with a nice 
feeling of having entered the computer world with a competent and 
understanding guide. Experienced computer users benefit from excellent 
design and easy, efficient use. 

The manual is written in a clear, logical, step-by-step format. It ex- 
plains everything about the program and provides beginning theory and 
basic information about accounting. 

The State of the Art accounting series is perfectly suited to small and 
medium size companies. Written in p-code and machine-transportable, 
the system begs to be used with massive Winchester hard disk storage. It 
does the mo.st incredible data sorts. Even with very large files, requested 
information arrives on the monitor screen in a fraction of the time you'd 
expect. All the data inputs are menu-driven and very easy for a com- 
pany's regular clerical staff to use. 

State of the Art's attention to detail is indicative of the thoroughness 
of the company's approach and its concern for the user. Packaging is 
not a crucial feature of a product, but State of the Art's is outstanding. 
The company even provides attractive preprinted labels for the user's 
backup copies. Now, that is indeed state of the art in customer con- 
.sideration.

agement.

Lode Runner. By Doug Smith. One hundred fifty unique levels. That's 
what Lode Runner has. With that awesome statistic out in the open, let's 
get on to the game. 

It sounds like crickets on a sultry August evening, but it's not. It's a 
little person drilling holes in bricks, obstructing pursuers, tunneling to 
gold. The mourning dove's call is the tiny person jumping, safely, grace- 
fully from any height, from ladders, from platforms, from monkey bars. 
He's a gymnast extraordinaire, this fellow, but so are his pursuers, the 
dreaded Bungelings of Choplifter fame. The difference is brains; They 
have few; he has ours. 

There's a plot, but it doesn't matter. The object in this running, jump- 
ing, climbing, swinging, digging arcade strategy game is to collect all the 
little gold packets scattered about a brick and aluminum room and 
climb to a higher room. As levels progress, the gold is placed more and 
more diabolically. Besides calling on mastery of the arcade skill, each 
screen is a strategic problem. You won't get far in Lode Runner with your 
mind on hold. 

It's a good thing it's from Broderbund. Respect for the player 
abounds. To wit; When a new screen appears, its action is suspended, to 
give players a chance to study the new level. Does 150 screens seem im- 
possible with only five men? Give yourself a hundred, or nine hundred, 
men. And jump to whatever level you like. 

The Broderbunders are also known for their fairness. When you use 
extra men or jump levels, your scores don't count on the game's high 
score roster. 

The graphics are clean and crisp and cute; the animation's charming. 
But the big achievement is the progression of that multitude of levels. 
Each builds on the ones before. Each presents a fresh challenge. And, for 
each difficult problem, there are clues planted in earlier screens. It's an 
advantage to tackle them in order. 

If that were all there were to Lode Runner, the game could take its 
kudos and go straight to the top ten. But there's more. Evidently Doug 
Smith, Broderbund, and all the friends and relatives of both had such fun 
creating levels for the game that they decided to let everyone in on the 
act. Enter the Lode Runner game generator. 

The editor provides for creating more l^de Runner levels — whole 
disks full. Creating levels with this system is a whole lot easier than mas- 
tering them. There isn't a simpler game generator on the market. The 
hard part, as it should be, is fine-tuning the new screens for playability. 

Lode Runner sounds like a summer evening, but it's a game for all 
seasons. It's enough game for many seasons, too. Look out, Apple 
Wriler lie. "(T

Knights of the Desert. By Tactical Design Group. North Africa, World 
War II. In withering desert heat punctuated by oddly freezing nights, 
where water was more precious than gasoline, the Axis armies of Mus- 
solini and Hitler sought to sever the British Empire's vital life hne — the 
Suez Canal. The armies were then to sweep victoriously on through 
Egypt toward the Middle East and its strategic oil fields. In February 
1941, Hitler sent two crack divisions to northern Africa under Field 
Marshal Erwin Rommel. After Mussolini's armies had been humiliated 
that previous autumn by a patchwork British Army, they were outnum- 
bered almost ten to one. Turning defeat into a stunning series of victo- 
ries. Hitler's favorite general and the Afrika Korp were soon to make his- 
tory. The Desert Fox had come to Africa. 

Knights of the Desert is a divisional/regimental simulation of the 
1941 -to- 1 943 North African campaign. Besides a full twelve-turn cam- 
paign scenario, there are five shorter scenarios. The game system is remi- 
niscent of the Tactical Design Group's earlier Battle for Normandy. 
While tactical deployment of military units is a major factor in achieving 
victory, Knights of the Desert is very much a contest of supply and mo- 
rale. Thanks to the Royal Navy, British forces have virtually limitless sup- 
plies. Axis forces must endure the British blockade based on the island of 
Malta. While generally possessing better morale and equipment, the Ger-

man forces must race against time and the harsh conditions of desert 
warfare. 

Full-color hi-res graphics depict various British and Axis units and 
show a portion of the battle area at a time in the now familiar hexagonal 
grid. Terrain includes strategic towns, rough areas, mountains, im- 
passable desert, and coastal areas. The cursor serves to select units for 
identification and movement. The battle area screen may be scrolled us- 
ing the cursor, or an aggregated, hi-res view of the entire North African 
Theater may be selected. 

Unit types include garrisons, infantry, motorized infantry, and tanks. 
Each individual historic unit is separately rated for morale, actual 
strength, and maximum strength. One very nice touch is the introduc- 
tion of standard military symbols to depict unit types, with crosses de- 
noting unit size. During battle, units may be given varying levels of at- 
tack intensity and risk, with corresponding levels of risk introduced dur- 
ing battle. Stacking of units in the same hex is allowed. 

The game system introduces a new and welcome innovation, the use 
of multiple-phase turns in which each player has a limited opportunity to 
react during the opponent's game turn. This offers a far more realistic 
simulation of the ebb and flow of actual battle than the more rigidly al- 
ternating game turns. Air power, while not present in the game as dis- 
crete combat units, may be allocated through air points and act as a 
modifier, influencing the odds of battle between ground forces. 

Game play may be halted and saved to disk at the end of each turn. 
Should you require a capable opponent on short notice, provision has 
been made for solitaire play, with the computer commanding the British 
forces. 

Game play is relatively quick. Provision has been made to select 
rapidly all friendly units for movement or battle orders. Unlike in the 
game system employed in SSI's more sophisticated Germany 1985, no 
provision has been made to order a unit to a specific area or location ex- 
cept to home base and to Tobruk. 

Knights of the Desert is a game of quick, slashing movement. Initia- 
tive is vital to effect victory. As in the historical campaign, the battle may 
ebb and flow across the deserts many times before final resolution. For 
the Axis forces, supply allocadon is critical. The amount of supplies suc- 
cessfully running the British blockade will vary according to the historic 
supply rate prevalent at the time. Secure supply bases must be estab- 
lished by both players to support advancing troops and armor. Combat, 
movement, and fortifications all consume precious supplies and take 
their toll as surely as the foe. 

SSI lists Knights of the Desert as an intermediate-level game. With in- 
novative game play, several minigame scenarios, and options for various 
skill levels. Knights of the Desert is a worthy war game. WUU

Planetfall. By Steve Meretzky. If you pet Floyd, he snuggles up to you; if 
you leave him, he runs to catch up, shouting, "Hey, wait for Floyd!" He 
loves to play, but he'll give his life for you. Incidentally, he's a robot. 

Planetfall is a science-fiction text adventure, and it's also a comedy. 
Lots of the lines and descriptions will make you laugh, but Floyd will on- 
ly make you smile — and care. Floyd is the star, although the player rep- 
resents the hero. Floyd puts robots in the same category with children 
and animals; they're masters at upstaging. You see? He's just upstaged 
Steve Meretzky's humor. 

The story takes place in the 210th century; it begins with the mal- 
function and explosion of a patrol starship, which our hero survives if 
you're clever. He lands on a planet that seems deserted. With him, you get 
to explore a large research complex of a unique civilizaUon that appears 
to have been cut off suddenly, much like Pompeii, discovering its habits 
and values and goals. You also discover its troubles and the remarkable 
way it was dealing with them. 

There's plenty to see and to read, and plenty to figure out how to 
work. There are also some malfunctions to fix; don't be dissuaded if you 
lack knowledge in electronics or chemistry; you don't need them — ^just 
logic. 

Except for one of those troubles to which you've fallen heir, there's 
very little danger in mo.st of Planetfall. The need to find a source of food 
and liquid is your most life-threatening problem until quite near the end. 



Even then, the dangers come from mistakes, yours and those of the long- 
gone civilization, not from evil. You won't miss the danger. The delight 
of a new world and superior puzzles, and, of course, a friend like Floyd, 
is plenty. 

Many of the puzzles are outstanding, although one good one does 
have the hero running up and down between floors a bit even after the 
puzzle is essentially solved. The gaming system is Infocom's normal one, 
superior and ever improving. 

But it is the writing, the prose, that merits the most attention. Meret- 
zky is an adventurer, not a seasoned writer, as a few rough spots attest. 
Overall, the text is rich and colorful and intelligent. As with a fine novel, 
it takes only the cooperation of your imagination to see every nuance of 
the setting in close detail and to empathize with the characters. 

Perhaps it is those very rough spots that, by contrast, bring to aware- 
ness how close well-made adventures are to becoming a legifimate form 
of literature. While a number of people are struggling to bring literature 
to the computer via hybrid short stories, interactive fiction, and other 
new forms with varying degrees of unsuccess, the old adventure, being 
honed and refined and filled out, is getting there first. 

Hey, Floyd, isn't this an exciting time to be alive? iKT

Bookends: The Reference Management System. By Jonathan D. Ash- 
well. Perhaps Sensible Software puts out relatively few products because 
it spends a whole lot of time searching for near-perfect programmers. Or 
maybe the programmers come to Sensible — birds of a feather, and all 
that — and they and Sensible spend a whole lot of time making the pro- 
grams perfect before they release them. Whatever, you can rely on Sensi- 
ble's programs to do what they say they will and do it well and easily. 

With Bookends, Sensible has outdone itself. Think of every gripe 
you've ever had about home-use programs — accounting packages, data- 
bases, and so on. Don't you wish they wouldn't take ten minutes to sort? 
Don't you wish they'd let you print and sort? If you think of a hundred 
more wishes, you won't have outthought Jonathan Ashwell; and he fixed 
them all in Bookends. 

Bookends apologizes for the length of sorting time it takes if you 
should ask it to sort a seven-hundred-item file by keyword, where every 
item can have up to 255 characters' worth of keywords. The maximum 
time for which it's apologizing? Forty-five seconds. You see, most sorts 
in Bookends take no time, at least not discernibly; you wouldn't have 
time to press another key in the time most of its sorts take. 

First learning to work with Bookends is one "But I thought that 
couldn't be done!" after another. For instance, cinchy editing anytime; if 
you're looking at it, you can edit it. Getting out of absolutely anything 
you've gotten yourself into without losing any data or even editmg. 
Searching on scant knowledge — "I know that article was about Janek 
somebody or other, but I can't remember the rest"; if Janek was in the ti- 
tle, a title search will find the article, and a keyword search will do it 
otherwise. Printing out any fields in any order on any selection of rec- 
ords, arranged alphabetically instantly by author, title, keyword, or not 
at all. That's just a few. 

There must be a catch, right? There is. Bookends is just for people 
who have a reason to want a file that indexes magazine articles or books, 
that confines its audience to publishers, engineers, scientists, doctors, 
lawyers, computer users, students, journalists — just a few esoteric 
groups. Of course, although Sensible doesn't say so, Bookends works just 
as well for indexing records, movies, and software. So add musicians, 
stereo collectors, filmmakers, movie fans, and more computer users. It's 
very limited. 

All data goes into Bookends in the same form: author, title, journal, 
volume, pages, date, publisher, keywords, abstract, and classification. 
(How it comes out is a different matter. Patience.) The lengths of the 
fields are limited. There's the rub, you say — but only if 255 characters 
makes you claustrophobic; that's the limit on all but two fields. The clas- 
sification, which allows you to output different kinds of items in the same 
list in different formats, is limited to the one character it needs. In the ab- 
stract, a description of the work cited, you're allowed 740 characters for 
your purple prose. 

Most fields accept multiple entries. Softalk, for instance, has a

The first of 
our Bible Adven-

Ploy. Based on the biblical 
Book of Judges, it starts 
at a time when law and 
order have fled from the 
hills of Judea. It's a turbulent 
world of intrigue and revenge, 
altars and idols, heroes and 
justice. You'll seek the long- 
lost mythical Treasure of 
the Seven Nations, racing 
against a dangerous Philis- 
tine warrior who is trying

strange quirk of" using one title for a story on the contents page and an- 
otlier on the story itself. No problem for Bookends. We can enter both ti- 
tles under r;7/eand choose which we want to use each time we print out. 
Even if we always print out the same one, someone searching for the rose 
by another name will find the same flower. 

Only the author may have just one entry. AKAs aren't allowed. Not 
only that, but poor put-upon authors must always be input backward: 
Bellow, Saul. Or Anderson, Hans Christian. In output, however, sin- 
gle-key responses can result in those inputs appearing as they were or as 
Anderson, H. C; Anderson, H C; Anderson, H.C.; Anderson, HC; Saul 
Bellow; S. Bellow; S Bellow; and, where there are coauthors. Bellow, S., 
Anderson, H.C., Alcott, L.M.; or Bellow, S., H. C. Anderson, and L. 
M. Alcott. And a whole bunch more, because you can fool with the com- 
mas too. 

Seldom does a journal have more than one name. But, especially in 
technical journals, various bibliographical purposes may call for differ- 
ent forms of the name. Journal of Social Psychology may be fine for some 
listings, but many require J. Soc. Psych. The same considerations apply 
to dates and publishers. 

Then there are keywords. These are the heart of the indexing func- 
tion of Bookends, and how well they'll work depends on how intelligent- 
ly the person who inputs them chooses them. Bookends searches for 
matches beginning with the keyword. For example, searching for gam 
would return everything about games, gambling, and Rita Gam. When 
keywords include words for all the concepts in an article, then you really 
have a computerized index. Since you can print out the results of your 
searches, in any form, you could, if you had a Bookends file on Softalk, 
search for keyword Applesoft, opt to have the results printed, and end up 
with a list of every Softalk article that can teach you something about 
Applesoft. (It's coming, it's coming, for heaven's sake!) 

Let's get picky. You want to find out about Applesoft, all right, but 
only if there's a program listing or two to look at. So search for Apple- 
soft/list. Bookends thinks that's ambiguous of you and asks whether you 
want all records about Applesoft and all records about list or only rec- 
ords that include both Applesoft and list. Obviously you'd choose the

latter or be deluged by reams of listings in Pascal and assembly language 
and Logo and Business Basic and even Fortran. 

Formats are of your own design, and you can make as many as you'll 
ever use. Through formats, you can print simple lists of authors or titles 
or full formal bibliographical references. You can print subject lists, 
showing title and summary; or issue lists, showing everything from just 
one issue of a magazine. Fastalk could be maintained on, and its manu- 
script printed directly from, this program. Or you can disdain format and 
print your listing out just the way you put it in. 

Here is where classification comes in. If you have occasion to print 
up formal reference lists or bibliographies, you may need one format for 
magazines, another for books, and yet another for authorless volumes in 
a series (like encyclopedias). By classifying the records consistently ac- 
cording to their type and creating appropriate formats to reflect those 
types, you can have your list output with each of the records formatted 
appropriately. 

You don't have to print. You can save a selected list to a new file in- 
stead; or look at the formatted product on the screen. You can turn your 
finished file into a text file and take it to your word processor for 
polishing. 

But it's difficult to see why you'd be scurrying to your word proces- 
sor. Bookends is adequate to almost every task. As soon as you boot up, 
it knows the capacity of your Apple's memory. What it doesn't know, it 
asks; thus it provides for a lower-case chip and a lower-case keyboard 
(the instant you specify either of these, your input switches to lower 
case — right in the middle of the configuration program), a shift-key mod- 
ification, and a second disk drive. It also has extremely fast editing capa- 
bilities that are perfectly adequate for the amount of text involved. Fi- 
nally, you can configure Bookends to your printer; then, if your printer 
allows, you can manipulate several printer options in your formats — 
such as turning on or off printer options like italics, alternate typefaces, 
and underscoring. 

There are simple menu-controlled ufilities to merge and append files. 
When your database grows too large to be stored in memory, you simply 
continue it in a new file. Then you chain the two — all by menu-driven 
single keystrokes again. The number of files you can chain is unlimited. 
Chaining allows you to search through all of one file, then load and 
search through all of any number of other files, all for one search key, 
and all without retyping that key. 

It's difficult to stress enough the ease of using Bookends. The manual 
is clear, concise, and practically unnecessary. 

If you have no use for a reference management system, create one; 
this package is just about worth it. It isn't only that Bookends works just 
the way you've always wished programs would work, it's also the inher- 
ent promise that someday soon they all will. ri(T

Early Games Music. By John Paulson. Early Games Music isn't a 
tutorial, and it isn't a music generator. It's an introduction to the tools a 
child (or anyone) needs in order to learn about music. 

The program contains two main parts: One quizzes about notes, their 
names, and their pitches, while the other lets the child create music. In 
both modes there's learning. 

John Paulson turns the Apple into the almost perfect teacher — pa- 
tient and forgiving. If you make an error, the program provides audio 
and visual hints to help you figure out the correct answer. 

Though most of the learning is interactive — a game of Simon Says 
teaches how to play tunes that are already stored on disk — some of it is 
passive. You can load tunes from disk and listen to them while watching 
which notes on the keyboard are being played. 

Both the quiz and creative (perform and record) segments let the par- 
ticipant experiment almost without limit. Whereas some educational 
programs will move to another area of learning after the child appears to 
have mastered a subject. Early Games Music stays with it until the child 
feels ready to move on. The same goes for the creative mode; kids can 
play and play until they want to do something else. 

Early Games Music is suggested for children four years old to twelve 
years old. There are worded menus to help select which game to play. 
There's also a picture menu for tots who can't yet read, but how to use

that menu is not as clear as it could have been. In both cases, adult help is 
probably needed for the very young. (Besides, programs like this 
shouldn't be used as a baby sitter, and nothing can match the joy of 
seeing a child learn.) 

In all, the concepts Early Games Music teaches are fundamental, and 
they're taught in an almost subliminal way; children can sometimes learn 
and not realize they're being taught. There's not a lot of depth or detail in 
the material, but, for the purpose of the program, that's not neces- 
sary. fITV

Think Tank. By Dave Winer and John Llewellyn. Whether you're writ- 
ing a book, planning an ad campaign, making wedding arrangements, or 
simply trying to set priorities for your Saturday morning errands, it's not 
likely that your ideas about the subject come to you in a particularly or- 
dered fashion. The process of trying to define, think through, and carry 
out the many steps involved in a project or task can wind up requiring 
vast quantities of paper, a huge eraser, and seemingly infinite patience. If 
you're like most people, your thinking process is idiosyncratic, with ideas 
coming fast, randomly. Thinking of one thing that must be done, ar- 
ranged for, or checked into reminds you of another matter that must be 
taken care of first, and soon it is hard to keep up with yourself 

So you grab a tablet or notebook and think on paper, recording your 
thoughts as they occur to you and sorting them out later. If you're really 
serious about getting organized, you recopy your notes neatly onto a 
clean page once you have everything worked out in your mind. Of 
course, as soon as you think everything's settled, something that forces a 
modification or addition to your strat^y is almost destined to happen. 

Enter Think Tank, a program designed to facilitate the thinking, re- 
thinking, organizing, and reorganizing process that's so vital to accom- 
plishing our professional and personal goals. Its authors call Think Tank 
an "idea processor," and that's not a bad way to describe this versatile, 
unique tool. 

Think Tank is essentially an electronic outline generator that at- 
tempts to bring to thinking, organizing, and planning what word proc- 
essing programs brought to writing — flexibility. This powerful, well 
prompted program allows you to generate, organize, and refine your 
thoughts and ideas in outline form on screen. And then, because it's elec- 
tronic, capable of erasing without leaving a mark, it gives you limitless 
permission to change your mind. Because this program allows you to, in 
effect, process your ideas, it just may help you get more out of your 
thinking. 

Creating a Think Tank outline is easy. You just start putting your 
ideas down on paper, or rather, on screen. Ideas can be expressed either 
as single lines of text, known as headlines, or as paragraphs, which can be 
just over two thousand characters in length. Both headlines and para- 
graphs can be indented to appear on screen (and on paper) at any of 
many different indentation levels, depending on the degree of impor- 
tance or priority you want to assign to them. 

So does this mean that you have to be the type of person who thinks 
in outline form — you know, one of those people who arranges the gro- 
cery list into neat little categories? Hardly. The great thing about this pro- 
gram is that it helps you let your ideas fiow freely, because you know that 
you can organize them later. Before you know it, ideas become heads, 
expansions of those ideas become paragraphs, the paragraphs generate 
subideas that become subheads, the subheads . . . well, you get the pic- 
ture. And it's a snap to modify your electronic outline whenever you 
have another idea, a change of heart, or new information to keep 
track of 

Think Tank divides the screen into a large window for text and a 
small command area. If your Apple is capable of displaying eighty col- 
umns, either naturally or via Videx, the window takes advantage of it. 
The text window is where you express your thoughts, in a single line or in 
paragraph form. By indenting an entry a lot or a little, you assign it a cer- 
tain level of priority or importance in relation to the others. 

Once you've entered a headline or paragraph, you may edit it, add to 
it, move it around to change its status, and so on. So when you're trying 
to define a problem, work out the details of a plan, or nail down a 
strategy, you don't have to think about the form your ideas take — all you 



have to do is think. As your ideas take shape and multiply themselves, 
you can insert the new ones anywhere and at any level you like within 
your outline, delete old ideas that no longer seem important, and so on. 
You can also indent or outdent whole groups of headlines in one stroke, 
browse through the outline, search and replace to find or alter entries, 
and print out all or part of any outline. 

All these things are accomplished by means of straightforward, logi- 
cally named commands arranged in four command menus. The menu 
for whichever section you're in is constantly displayed across the bottom 
of the screen. Each of the command menus in this tree-structured pro- 
gram relates to the next. When you position the cursor over a com- 
mand, an explanation appears on screen to remind you what the com- 
mand does. 

Two especially useful capabilities this program offers are expand and 
contract. The expand command permits you to see all the various head- 
lines underneath a major one, thereby allowing you to focus in on the de- 
tails of a particular segment of the outline. The contract command can be 
used to contract the outline so that only major headings show up on 
screen; this allows you to get a feeling for the larger picture. 

Also noteworthy are special command modes that allow you to en- 
ter or edit lots of headlines and paragraphs without having to return to 
the main menus each time. 

Written in Pascal, Think Tank uses the Pascal editor to allow you to 
edit your headlines and paragraphs. It's also possible to "port" an out- 
line into a word processor for editing with a Pascal-based word proces- 
sor by making the outline into a Pascal text file. (Of course, you can also 
port an outline back into Think Tank.) Lately, users have been asking the 
makers of the program for a way of translating Think Tank outlines into 
DOS text files for use with word processors like Apple Writer II and 
Screen Writer II. The version of the program that is being shipped now 
incorporates this utility and owners of the previous version may request 
the utility from the company. 

Think Tank is not a perfect program. It is not as fast as you might 
wish (disk access slows things down some), the paragraph limit of 2,048

characters may occasionally frustrate you, and its logic may not always 
directly match yours. Think Tank's, main drawback, however, concerns 
not the software but the hardware. A more extensive setup — two disk 
drives and a language card are required, printer (and Videx eighty-col- 
umn card for Apple II owners) is very much recommended — than some 
Apple owners have or can afford is called for. It's quite understandable 
that a program such as this would require a full system, but it's also too 
bad. Think Tank would seem to be a natural for use in schools by both 
teachers and students, but unfortunately many schools lack the neces- 
sary equipment. 

The spiral-bound Think Tank manual, written by John UngerZuss- 
man with assistance from David Greene, is a gem. Its creators are telling 
the truth when they claim the book is written in "clear, readable, non- 
technical English." It's very refreshing. The manual is packed with 
thoughtfully arranged, helpful information, including a tutorial to ac- 
quaint new users with the program, notes and suggestions for experi- 
enced users, an excellent glossary, and well presented technical informa- 
tion. Finally, it contains a reference guide section that describes the Think 
Tank command structure and each individual command in clear detail. 
A helpful command reference card is also part of the package. 

It would be silly to think that Think Tank will ever supplant those 
lists we're all so fond of making. There's something so satisfying about 
sharpening up a brand new pencil and heading a clean, invitingly blank 
sheet of paper with the words "to do"; it fills a real need. Nor will Think 
Tank do away with index cards, notebooks, and other time-honored 
ways of keeping track of information. What the program just may do, 
however, is help you organize and take better advantage of all those great 
ideas you have. lEV

Interstellar Sharks. By David Mullich. Interstellar Sharks is the second 
in Edu- Ware's Empire Trilogy of fantasy role-playing games. The initial 
frontier explorations are over and an empirical government binds the 
colonies together. With that civilizing force has come the bane of socie- 
ties, bureaucracy. Everywhere there are palms to be greased, rules to be 
bent, and red tape to be cut. To survive and prosper in this constraining 
environment requires the temperament of a shark: ruthless and willing to 
take chances. 

In fact, if this is a game with a message, the message is clear Red tape 
makes laws ineffective and polarizes people and their government. Play- 
ers assume the personas of businessmen, diplomats, or spaceship pilots. 
Each role has broad possibilities — the strongest suit of the Empire games 
is the latitude given the player in character development. 

Businessmen work for major Imperial monopolies. They can play the 
stock exchange or apply for trading seats on the commodities market. 
Periodically, their companies assign them important work around the 
colonies — negotiating labor disputes, arranging trade agreements, even 
engaging in industnal sabotage. 

Diplomats receive missions from their embassies. Often they are en- 
trusted with carrying diplomatic pouches between colonies. 

Pilots take on the most difficult task: outfitting spacecraft. Some of 
the supplies are hard to locate, and pilots must visit all the colonies to 
find the equipment they need. 

There are eleven planets connected by the trade routes. The game be- 
gins at a space station, where new characters are generated and old char- 
acters are placed in cryogenic sleep between games. The eventual goal of 
the game is to figure out how to reach the Imperial planet Triskelion. 
That planet is surrounded by an enormous force field. Each of the other 
nine planets is unique and full of surprises and challenges. 

Passage between planets becomes bogged down in red tape. Manag- 
ing to obtain a pa.ssport and ticket and then clear customs is an adven- 
ture in bureaucratic dawdling. 

Winning the game without doing anything illegal takes a very long 
time. The ca.se again.st bureaucracy is most strongly made in the reward- 
ing of ingenuity in the breaking of laws and customs. Illegal markets and 
weapons fiourish everywhere. Pilots can make fortunes in drug running. 
With insight, Mullich shows how much of living becomes a gamble when 



normal actions are rendered illegal. For example, players carrying illegal 
contraband can't pass through customs; they must depend on a lucky 
dice roll to escape. This section of the game is suspenseful and exciting. 

When you're caught in illegal actions, you may opt to bribe the po- 
lice, negotiate your release, or attempt an escape. Failing these, you can 
shoot it out with the law. 

The Interstellar Sharks vocabulary is extensive for this kind of game, 
with one hundred eighty words. Colorful hi-res graphics enhance, but 
they don't vary much from planet to planet. Included with the game is an 
unusual booklet, "The Memoirs of Yoram Lazur," penned by Wendy 
Peterson. It provides a history of the period between the first game of the 
trilogy and this one. Although the writings of Twelfth Empress Yoram 
Lazur sometimes read like James Joyce, they do clarify the game's socio- 
political environment. 

Interstellar Sharks plays considerably better than the first game in the 
series. However, be prepared to spend an enormous amount of time de- 
veloping each character. Psychologically, Interstellar Sharks wears a 
player down fast. The sheer weight of the simulated red tape and pro- 
cedural hindrances slows the game down to a crawl just when you feel 
like soaring. Still, if you persevere to the end, you'll feel a real sense of ac- 
complishment — rare in computer games but common to Edu-Ware's 
products. RKA

Taxan RGB vision-I. Apple's detractors have been saying for years that 
you can't do professional computing in forty columns, while Apple's 
proponents have pointed out the wealth of software that won't run on 
any other machine. Now you can have your cake and eat it too. The in- 
troduction of the Apple He marks the first time in Apple history that 
eighty-column boards for the Apple are standardized, inexpensive, and 
widespread. Because of this, software that uses the eighty-column dis- 
play is popping up all over the place. 

Which raises another dilemma: How do you display those eighty col- 
umns clearly and still have a color display without buying two monitors? 
An RGB monitor (a high-resolution monitor with a special interface that 
handles the signals for the three primary colors of light — red, green, and 
blue — with separate signals) will do the trick. But it's never been easy to 
run an eighty-column video signal into an RGB interface card. 

TSK Electronics offers a simple and moderately priced solution. 
They offer the RGB vision-I with a choice of interfaces (for the He only) 
that combine eighty-column and RGB signal generation on a single card, 
to be inserted in the auxiliary slot. 

The monitor can be used with a II Plus as well, but it isn't as simple 
to install nor does it offer eighty columns on the same board. There is 
nothing in the installation instructions covering connecting the RGB 
board for the II Plus to an eighty-column card. With some cards it may 
not be possible. This isn't really a criticism of the Taxan product: It's a 
common problem with RGBs and eighty-column boards on the II Plus. 

The situation on the He is considerably simpler. The RGB vision-I 
can be installed in the He using the 410-80 or the 410-64 interface. These 
cards provide the same eighty-column options as Apple's two eighty-col- 
umn cards for the He; one gives eighty-column display using Apple's 
built-in firmware, so it's compatible with programs written for Apple's 
card, and the other is the same thing with an additional 64K of RAM, 
again controlled by Apple's built-in firmware. Both cards also act as an 
RGB interface, and they cost marginally more than the equivalent cards 
from Apple. 

The monitor itself is light and portable, though it has no handle, with 
a -screen that is about eleven inches measured diagonally. In graphics 
mode the colors are clear and bright; in text mode, in forty or eighty col- 
umns, the characters are highly readable. Most of the abilities of the 
monitor are determined by the interface card used. 

With either the II Plus or the He, the color of the text displayed on- 
screen can be set with a switch on the interface card. This feature gives 
the RGB the capability of emulaUng your favorite color monochrome 
monitor — green, blue, amber, and white on a black background are the 
options on the He. The II Plus version includes those options plus yel- 
low on black, as well as three foreground/background color combina- 
tions, all hardware-selectable.

The monitor-interface combination for the He has some added fea- 
tures that aren't available on the II Plus. For instance, in forty columns, 
each character position on-screen can be set to have a different fore- 
ground and background color. There are sixteen possible colors avail- 
able for both foreground and background, and they're software-select- 
able. Although there is no commercially written software that takes ad- 
vantage of this feature, there is a great potential for customizing your 
own programs to color-code distinct functional sections of the screen. 

Other options available only for the He include a medium graphics 
mode with a resolution of 80 by 48 in sixteen colors and a very odd hi-res 
that is 80 by 192 in sixteen colors. The regular hi-res mode can be done in 
sixteen colors by setting foreground/background colors in the same way 
they are set for the text screen. The resulting colored areas, being based 
on text screen character positions, are necessarily somewhat blocky. 
With the interface that has the extra memory, double-hi-res-graphics 
mode — 560 by 192 in monochrome or 140 by 192 in sixteen colors — is 
also possible. Again, no commercial software uses these options, but an 
astute programmer could figure out enough from the included demos to 
use them in custom-made programs. 

For Apple II Plus owners, the Taxan RGB vision-I is a good color

Close Assault. By National Microcomputer Associates. All the great 
battles of history are the sum of countless individual battles fought by ex- 
hausted and often frightened men. Their battlefields are abandoned 
farmhouses, waving fields of wheat, or barren hilltops. Generals don't 
fight battles; soldiers do. They live, fight, and sometimes die in that most 
basic of military units, the squad. With Close Assault, you can experi- 
ence all the challenge and thrill of squad-level command. Close Assault is 
not a simulation of a particular historic battle but rather a simulation of 
squad-level tactics played out in a generalized European village. 

Most innovative in Close Assault is the player's role in the scenario.

The character of one of the squad leaders is reserved for the player — you 
actually take part in the fray. Should your character die or be critically 
wounded in combat, your faithful computer will assume command and 
finish the game for you. 

Close Assault is a simulation of tactical infantry combat in World 
War II, using a unique hybrid game system that combines the best ad- 
vantages of pure computer simulations with traditional board games. 

The game may be either two-player or solitaire, with the computer 
able to play either side or both. Russian, German, and American squads 
are represented, rated according to their historic firepower, weapons 
range, and morale. Squad leaders are rated for morale and leadership. 

Two separate standard scenarios are available: harassment of ad- 
vance, a dogged defense by outnumbered defenders; and strong point at- 
tack, the clash of opposing squads in classic combat. In addition, players 
may custom-design their own scenarios, establishing goals and deter- 
mining victory conditions. During play, the computer resolves tactical 
combat and determines line-of-sight conditions — what a squad is able to 
see from its vantage point. Factors such as elevation, forests, wheat 
fields, buildings, and smoke can all obstruct vision from one map hex to 
another. Any attempt of a squad to fire on another squad that is not in 
line of sight is effectively blocked. 

Besides all this, the computer handles double hidden movement. It 
determines if and when a unit on the move has revealed itself and wheth- 
er enemy units have been revealed. During combat, the computer effec- 
tively records the changing status of every man in the conflict. 

Both fire combat and close assault reflect short and bloody hand-to- 
hand combat. Weapons allowed include rifles, machine guns, demoli- 
tion charges, smoke grenades, and flame throwers. As in real life, weap- 
ons may malfunction in action and require repair. 

Squads are initially placed at assigned locations. Players are informed 
of the presence and locations of enemy units as they are sighted. Because 
it's necessary, with the hybrid systems, to verify the map board, the com- 
puter frequently confirms current unit locations. Squads may engage in 
long-range fire, hand-to-hand combat, and may move. There's even a 
provision for a squad to go berserk. The computer will wrest control of 
the squad from the player and attack the enemy without regard for its 
own safety! 

Close Assault's graphics and sound are handled in a simple and 
straightforward manner. There are none. In this hybrid game, the disk 
comes with a high-quality multicolored mapboard, more than sixty unit 
counters, and a note pad for recording the ebb and flow of battle. The 
designer has opted for the visual impact and simphcity of a mapboard 
and counters combined with the computer's game administration and 
solitaire-play capability. In the process, the overhead usually taken up by 
memory-hungry graphics is used to create a highly capable computer op- 
ponent that can offer the most experienced gamer a serious challenge. 

Playing Close Assault is reminiscent of playing Avalon Hill's board 
game Squad Leader. While the computer game is somewhat simpler than 
the board version (artillery and mortar fire are assumed to have taken 
place before the game begins, for example), the feel is similar. In Close 
Assault, because there's no graphics display of unit movement, game 
commands are considerably simpler to learn and, praise be, easier to 
remember. 

Close Assault represents a refreshing change in computer war gam- 
ing. The hybrid system offers an interesting alternative to pure computer 
simulations, and the level of play and sophistication of Close Assault 
make it a first-rate entry into the war game arena. Willi

Maze Craze Construction Set. By Eric Hammond. It's hard to look at 
this program without comparing it to the Pinball Construction Set. First, 
its name is almost the same. Second, cursor control in constructing 
mazes feels the same. There's nothing wrong with that; who would com- 
plain about having a program likened to the works of Bill Budge? 

That's where the similarities end, but it's not where the Maze Craze 
Construction Set ends. 

You can buy Maze Craze just to play the games included in it. There 
are ten different mazes and ten games that use various combinations of 
the ten mazes. Game A, for instance, uses maze 1 and no others. Game J,

on the other hand, uses some of the more difficult mazes combined with 
the more difficult game parameters (monsters know where you are, no 
power dots, and so on). But the reason you buy Maze Craze is to create 
maze games of your own. 

The whole program is menu-driven. You don't have to know any 
programming or any commands; all options are selected by joystick or 
keyboard. The maze editor lets you modify any of the existing mazes or 
create your own from scratch. Energizers (no more than four), tunnels, 
and bonus characters are yours for the positioning. When you're done 
creating your maze, your next task is to lay down all the dots. This is one 
option Hammond gives us that adds new variation to an old theme; you 
don't have to fill the entire maze with dots. Glory hounds can reach level 
200 in no time by putting just a few dots in the maze. 

Several other editing modes let you combine mazes into different 
games, customize and create your own monsters and protagonists, and 
vary the intelligence of monsters (to wander aimlessly or tail you to your 
eventual demise). In case you're the type who gets killed in these games 
and always mutters, "No fair! He didn't get me!" Maze Craze lets you 
vary the collision detection (merciful to sensitive). 

Finally, disk options allow you to save and load parameters of games 
you've created. Absent-minded gamesters will savor the option that lets 
them format a disk from within the program in case they haven't done so 
before spending hours creating games. 

As for color. Maze Craze has several, none of which you're allowed 
to choose. Oh, you can select the color you want the walls to be, but it's a 
choice between royal blue and institution green. Everything else comes 
with a preassigned uniform. 

Saving your game creations is similar to saving adventure games in 
progress; you can't save the games — just their parameters. The draw- 
back to this is that, unlike the Pinball Construction Set or Genesis, you 
can't create games to market or even to give to your friends. To play 
your games, you have to have the program disk. Data Trek's intention 
for Maze Craze is obviously for purchasers' enjoyment only. 

So where do we stand in the genre of do-it-yourself utilities? Thus far 



we have one in each: arcade shoot-'em-ups, pinball games, adventures, 
and now maze games. Maze Craze offers more than enough good fea- 
tures to offset its few limitations (limitations that would irk only the pick- 
iest of game designers). 

Don't expect to be thrilled with Maze Craze unless you're a maze fan 
to begin with. If you are, and you're tired of always playing on someone 
else's turf, this is a grand opportunity to have the home field advantage. 
Go for it. niv

MegaWriter. You can't get something for nothing; any good you re- 
ceive is obtained at the sacrifice of something else. When we talk about 
software, it shouldn't be that way, but it often is. 

In its ad and on its manual, MegaWriter compares itself with Apple 
Writer and Apple Writer II. For each feature listed, all the yeses in the 
MegaWriter column are matched in ihe Apple Writer column by noes or 
"with additional such and such only." 

They're not lying. MegaWriter does have a lot of features not found 
in Apple Writer. That's on paper. In use, it's a different story. Just look- 
ing at spec sheets won't tell you how a car feels when you drive it; you 
have to take it out on the road. 

The biggest draw is all the wonderful features MegaWriter gives you 
for an attractively low price. You get the same powerful functions found 
in other word processors that are in the hundred to two hundred dollar 
range (find, replace, mail list merge, text block move, eighty-column dis- 
play with or without an eighty-column card, underline, and boldface), all 
for less than what Bank Street Writer costs. 

It's a powerful word processor, that's for sure. But there are a few 
catches. 

First, Mega Writer is written in Pascal, which means several things. It 
means you have to have 64K RAM. It means the Pascal text files you 
create won't be compatible with most other word processors. It means 
you can send your files by modem only by using terminal programs that 
handle Pascal files.

Second, you have the option to use it with one or two disk drives. If 
you have only one drive, you can expect to do lots of switching between 
program and data disks. MegaWriter is menu-driven, but most menu se- 
lections require the program disk to be in the drive. 

Third, you can have an eighty-column display even if you don't have 
an eighty-column card. The catch is that, unlike Magic Window, which 
scrolls the text horizontally like a typewriter carriage so you can see what 
you're typing. Mega Writer takes your cursor to the other half of the page 
where you can't see it. You're still typing, all right; you just can't see a 
thing unless you hit a special control character that flips to the other half 
of the screen. 

The p-System and the program take up a lot of memory, so your text 
files will be limited to six or seven pages in length. You can link files to- 
gether when you print, but it's still a bit troublesome when you're trying 
to edit a document that is saved on disk as three or four segments. 

One nice thing He users have is an automatic shift-key modification 
that works just like a shift key on a typewriter. Those who have 11 
Pluses, however, will have to hassle with the dreaded "type control-W 
first and then the desired letter." If you've grown accustomed to hitting 
the escape key to get upper case, unlearn that habit fast; hitting escape 
destroys whatever you've created since you last saved. 

When you look at each feature in isolation, this is a rather good pro- 
gram; the pluses are strong, the minuses are small. It has almost every- 
thing you'd want in a word processor Everything appears on-screen just 
as it will appear in printed form; the manual is clearly written; it's menu- 
driven so you don't have to memorize any confusing commands; and it's 
affordable. 

MegaWriterv^\\\ work fine on a standard II Plus setup. But to get the 
most out of the program, make sure you try it out and use it on an Ap- 
ple He with an eighty-column card, a monitor with good resolution, and 
two disk drives. Anything less will only produce frustration. MTV

Lady Tut. By Greggy. And now, the maze game as French farce. The 
spirit of Georges Feydeau looms over Lady Tut, a frenetic, door-slam- 
ming little arcader that adds a new twist to one of the oldest formats in 
the business, making it sufficiently novel to be a pleasant way to pass the 
time. 

The maze is the maze the maze has always been, though here it's de- 
marcated by classy colored marble walls, befitting the pyramid of the 
Girl Queen whose sarcophagus is your ultimate goal. The wrinkle is that 
as you scramble toward the little treasures in the crannies of each maze 
and are sought in turn by the unsavory guardians of same, you have ac- 
cess to numerous revolving sections of the maze walls (all clearly idenfi- 
fiable as such, fortunately), which pivot smoothly when you run into 
them, closing behind you and shutting out any pursuing menaces — 
though you may possibly be exposed to more in the adjacent corridor if 
your entry was ill timed. Thus, you are constantly entering and exiting, 
and you have some say as to how the maze shall be laid out from mo- 
ment to moment and what paths your tradidonally blind and blunder- 
ing pursuers will take. 

After two or three mazes, you stumble upon a gun (actually, it looks 
like a diamond ring, but the screen flashes the word GUN! at you, an- 
ticipating your misperception). Instantly, you realize why all your points 
have been scored as "shots," and they take on the practical function of 
ammunition. Whether this is an entirely good thing is a matter of taste. It 
seems a hardly sporting turn of events, although the corridors do get 
awfully crowded right about here. . . . Still, subtlety suffers as your score 
improves. What was heretofore a light-footed game of complex high-tech 
hide-and-seek becomes pretty much a straight-ahead, clenched-teeth, 
blast to victory. 

After you've gotten through the nine different mazes (each not neces- 
sarily more difficult, just different) and found your mummy, you aren't 
going to see anything new, though at the end of the game you get a nifty 
graphic reward. But the power to control and alter the character of each 
maze and make it work as an ally should fascinate the younger set long 
after the game is first successfully completed. A(

TAC. By Ralph H. Bosson. TAC superbly simulates tactical armored 
combat in World War 11. The setfing is a wooded plain somewhere in 
Europe. If you use a little imagination, it could be the road to Berlin in 
1945. Three T34 tanks, the backbone of the Red Army, have just 
rounded a wood on the edge of a small plain. Suddenly, high explosive 
shells begin to fall, their bright orange firebursts indicating the presence 
of the enemy somewhere at the far edge of the clearing. Controlling the 
T34s, the player orders a recoilless rifle team and field artillery into the 
woods to cover the tanks. The player is in the tank in the lead when three 
Tiger tanks appear. You swivel your turret toward the target bearing. . . . 

Players in TAC choose military units from four nationaliUes, Ger- 
man, Russian, Brifish, and American, by means of a unique purchase 
routine. Each unit has its own point value. Forty armored vehicles and 
assorted infantry and field artillery, meticulously modeled within the 
simulation, are available to equip the mixed forces. Each vehicle is indi- 
vidually rated for speed, firepower, and armor thickness — front, sides, 
and rear. 

During game play vehicles may be maneuvered and their weapons 
trained on enemy forces. Infantry and field guns may be loaded for trans- 
portation or unloaded for action. Unlike in some simulaUons, the me- 
chanics of movement and deployment of forces in TAC is not so time- 
consuming as to detract from the tactical nuances of the game. TAC is 
just plain fun to play. 

So detailed is the simulation that calculations for anfitank fire in- 
volve armor thickness, slope of armor, range of fire, and relative posi- 
fions of the combatants. It's a nasty shock to learn that your Sherman 
tank shells merely bounce off a German Tiger tank's frontal armor. In 
several of the five scenarios, provisions are made for antitank mines, 
smoke, and improved positions. 

Graphics and sound effects are first-rate. Both tactical and strategic 
views of the battlefield are available with detailed hi-res representations of 
individual tank types on-screen. The attention to detail is awe-inspiring. 
When a tank fires, look closely and you'll see the muzzle flash. As vehi- 
cles move, there are appropriate sound effects. From the rattle of ma-

Learning About Numbers: Volume 1. By Richard Cornelius and Carol 
Clark. Learning About Numbers: Volume 1, the second program in C & 
C Software's Kids' Corner line, introduces preschool and primary-grade 
children to counting, telling time, and simple addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division. The disk contains four separate instruc- 
tional programs: Let's Count, Let's Tell Time, Arithmetic Fun 1, and 
Arithmetic Fun 2, each with nine skill levels. The levels, by the way, are 
not evident to the user. 

Let's Count presents up to twelve familiar objects, such as chairs, 
sailboats, butterflies, hammers, hearts, mugs, and television sets, to be 
counted. To answer, the child presses the number on the keyboard that 
corresponds to the number of objects displayed. In this program and in 
the ones that follow, correct answers are reinforced with one of an end- 
less assortment of winking happy faces and a musical tone. If a child is 
unable to answer successfully after two tries, the program offers help, in 
the form of a demonstration of one-to-one correspondence, the concept 
that is at the heart of counting. 

At level one of Let's Count, only one, two, or three objects are pre- 
sented. By level five, eight to twelve objects appear. At level six, a small 
group of objects, surrounded by a box, is displayed. Once the objects 
have been counted, a plus sign appears, followed by a second box of ob- 
jects to be counted. Next, a third box of objects appears. Connecting the 
third box to the first two is an equals sign; and with that, counting prob- 
lems have gently metamorphosed into addition problems. By the time 
kids reach level nine, they are dealing with random numbers of objects, 
as few as one or as many as nine, in each of the boxes. 

In the first five levels of Let's Tell Time, a conventional clock with an 
hour and minute hand and all twelve numbers is shown alongside a digi- 
tal watch. The learner's task is to read the time shown on the digital 
watch and then use the arrow keys to move the clock hands to reflect the 
time shown on the watch. At level five, the numbers 3, 6, 9, and 12 are 
displayed on the clock face, and the digital watch disappears for good 
after that. From level 6 on, the time to which the clock must be set is con- 
veyed in words and expressions that the child is bound to encounter in 
the real world. 

Like the other sections of this program, both parts of Arithmetic Fun 
have nine levels of increasing difficulty. 

Both arithm'etic sections incorporate a simple story as an added 
motivation to young children. The story has three main characters — a 
prince or princess, a wicked troll who is pursuing the royal child, and a 
hero or heroine (which the child controls), who can choose between res- 
cuing the character in distress or helping the troll. Solving math prob- 
lems moves the story along. The arithmetic sections can be modified to 
run in "learn arithmetic facts" mode. In that mode, each of the nine 
levels presents problems that involve the number of the level — all the 
problems on level four contain the number 4, and so on. It's easy to 
switch back and forth between this setup and the normal one. 

Like its predecessor Magic Crayon, Learning About Numbers offers a 
delightfully straightforward educational management system. This sys- 
tem allows interested parents and teachers to adapt the program for use 
with children at various levels of experience and ability and to keep 
records of up to fifty children's performances. Access to programs can be 
specified and controlled for individual children or groups of children, as 
can the level on which particular programs begin (the entry level) and the 
level a child is asked to achieve but not go beyond (the target level). The 



management system also allows an adult to turn score-keeping and time- 
keeping features on or off; to examine or print score information for one 
or many learners; to turn on, limit, or turn off sound; and to turn on or 
eliminate graphic reinforcement. 

Learning About Numbers is flexible, thoughtfully organized, and easy 
to use. Instrucfions that preview the programs are available on disk, as is 
an on-screen tutorial to acquaint users with the setup and symbols that 
Kids' Corner software consistently employs. In addition, help is avail- 
able at any time. 

The graphics are simple but pleasing. They don't compare to the car- 
toony animated images featured in Xerox's Sticky Bear Numbers count- 
ing program — which covers only counting — but they do add visual in- 
terest to the program. 

The well-written manual strikes just the right balance between brev- 
ity and detail. Besides explaining how to use the programs and the 
management system, it specifies the educational objectives of the pro- 
grams and the skills children need to use the various parts and levels of 
the program. lEV

Printographer. By Stephen Billard. One would think that the makers of 
printers with graphics capabilities would include programs with their 
printers to facilitate using those capabilities. Alas, because the printer 
people market their products for use with many different computers, in 
most cases you are left to your own devices. 

The most common use for a printer's graphics capability is to print 
pictures from the hi-res screen. This process, called a hi-res screen dump, 
is actually fairly simple. In fact, it can often be handled by a surprisingly 
short routine to translate data that the video signal understands to data 
that the printer understands. 

So printer dump programs costing enough to make them worth mar- 
keting had better do a darn sight more than just dump pictures. And they 
do. Typically, they work on a number of different printers. Since there 
isn't any standard way that printers handle graphics, most programs in- 
clude several different routines to cover all the popular graphics printers. 
That goes a long way toward making the programmer's job propor- 
tionate to the royalties paid for the program, but, as most people have 
only one printer, only one of those routines is going to be of any use to 
the individual customer. 

So printer dump programs typically offer such features as picture 
scaling, picture cropping before printing, and inverse and normal print- 
ing modes. (Sometimes what is white on the screen should be black on 
paper; sometimes not.) And that is where most graphics dump packages 
stop. 

Stephen Billard has thoroughly earned his royalties; Printographer 
does all that and goes quite a few steps farther. For instance, it can save 
pictures in a compressed format that will conserve from ten to twenty 
sectors of disk space per picture. It does smart disk catalogs, listing only 
those files that contain hi-res pictures, whether they're in a compressed 
format or a normal binary file. In addition to the handling of standard 
horizontal and vertical cropping, Printographer can crop pictures to dia- 
mond or cameo shapes prior to printing. 

Finally, if you want to be able to print pictures and save or load com- 
pressed pictures from your own programs, the routines in Printographer 
are transportable. They can be copied to your own disk and loaded into 
any free space in memory. Then, with a call command followed by the 
parameters for scale, cropping, and so on, your program can perform 
most of the functions of Printographer. If you have Southwestern Data 
Systems's Routine Machine, adding the Printographer routines to your 
programs is even easier. 

Printographer is one of the best printer dump programs available 
today. With all its extra features, it's a good alternative to the more ex- 
pensive graphics printer cards as well.

Planetmaster. By Gary Cuba. Ever want to control your own planet? 
Not politically, but ecologically. There's a lot more to it than just situat- 
ing animals in places where they can eat in peace and not get killed by 
other animals. Lots more to it.

Planetmaster lets you discover the complexities of raising various 
species in a somewhat controlled environment. It also challenges you to 
see how many ways you can twist, stretch, and contort your brain while 
doing so. 

The story is simple. It's the year 2323, and you're in charge of 
administering ecological sanctuaries for frail and endangered species. 
That's as far as the simple part goes. 

The sanctuary is actually a twelve-sided life-supporting satellite. 
From a virtually unlimited number of species, you select six that you 
want to take care of on the satellite. Here's where it gets challenging. 
Some are plant eaters, some are meat eaters, and some are both; how- 
ever, you don't know which are which until you've made your species 
selection. 

Taking care of your animals requires that you keep track of just a few 
things: vegetation growth, temperature, rainfall, seasonal changes, cli- 
mates, animals' balanced diets, demographics, food consumption, 
hibernation periods, birth and death rates, and life spans. There's more 
information to deal with than any normal human can possibly keep 
track of without the help of a pencil and a few reams of paper. 

After thoroughly analyzing all the information, you herd species 
from zone to zone, seeking the zone that provides the optimum environ- 
ment for each species. Each turn constitutes one season; there are four 
seasons to a year. 

In the beginning of the game, you're allowed to choose a difficulty 
level from among five — ranging from novice planet tender to planet- 
master — and the number of years you want to play. At the end of the 
game you're given an efficiency rating. Not a lot of reward for the tribu- 
lations you go through. 

The only graphics in the game are hi-res drawings of each species 
during the selection process, a map of the satellite, and some bar graphs. 
The rest of the screens are comparison charts and efficiency listings. It 
doesn't sound like an exciting game, but don't be fooled. The feeling you 
get when you see that your herbivores in zone five doubled their popula- 
tion last year will warm you all over, while you'll pound the computer in 
anger as a flashing message tells you that half your omnivores in zone 
eleven were lost to starvation. 

As time marches on, you'll get to know each species, feeling sorry for 
them when their favorite flora becomes harder to find or when some of 
them are gobbled up by neighboring carnivores. 

For a long time, the thinking person's games were largely put out by 
Strategic Simulations, Epyx/Automated Simulations, Odesta, and other 
giants. Magnetic Harvest's Planetmaster isn't nearly as colorful, com- 
mercially attractive, or complexly programmed (it's written in Apple- 
soft), but it's just as thought-provoking and intricately designed. tiTV

Jump Jet. By Chuck Benton. Get the Sunday afternoon gamers outta 
here. Send 'em back to the arcades to watch cute little cartoon penguins 
waddle around darling, colorful, picturesque backgrounds. Buncha 
wimps. Give 'em an adventure or something where they can sit and think 
for ten minutes about what key they're gonna press. They can forget 
about this. Gimme a beer and set it up again. 

This is Jwnp Jet. The graphics are from the minimalist school of ar- 
cade art. The sound is like something you'd get from a tired Mixmaster. 
It's just you, a joystick, and your sweaty palms. But it's the right stuff. 

You are flying your Harrier jet off an aircraft carrier, attempting to 
keep your eight-ship convoy and carrier intact long enough to get to the 
enemy land base and knock out the missile silos. First you must deal with 
rocket-firing, torpedo-spitting cruisers — in waves of two, three, and four. 
Then you confront slippery rocket-firing subs — two, three, and four. The 
kamikaze planes — one at a time, thank God (but hey, how about those 
plucky World War II vets going up against the most technologically ad- 
vanced fighter-bomber in the world?). 

Sound simple? You bet. Is it simple? No way. The first time you play 
this game is very likely to be the last. It plays by its own rules, which 
don't include any of the laws of gravity or aerodynamics. You are not 
likely to complete a successful refueling from the fiying tanker without 
first crashing into it at least four times in succession. Ditto trying to dis- 
patch even the first wave of torpedo boats without flying right into a mis- 
sile. Or trying to get close enough to the subs to bomb them faster than 
they can submerge. And yet, for all these trials, there is a way to tri- 
umph, and should you but learn the way, you'll surely enter into com- 
puter-game heaven and sleep the sleep of the just. And boy will your 
thumbs be tired. 

Don't get the wrong idea: Almost none of the popular criteria for a 
good game apply to Jump Jet. The animation — such as it is — flickers like 
a silent movie running too slowly. The plane's being of the vertical take- 
off and landing variety was a gimmick obviously chosen to spare the pro- 
grammer the hassle of trying to simulate anything remotely resembling 
the operation of a normal aircraft. You are not allowed to bomb when 
you are near or over your convoy, which means you're forced to lose 
most of the torpedo races. The only strategy that has a hope of working 
against the missile bases is dumb luck and lots of ammo. There's no 
pause key. And the sound effects (no sound-off option) will teach even 
the most hardware-disinclined where the speaker wire connection is lo- 
cated on their Apple (motherboard, extreme lower right corner). 

It's a sullen, sloppy, mean-spirited, bruising, working-class game. It 
knocks you around and gets drunk and frightens the children. It's hell to 
live with. But you just can't leave it. Not after all you've been through 
together. A(

Plasmania. By David Lubar and Lewis Geer. Sirius is getting nostalgic. 

Remember the movie Fantastic Voyage, in which scientists and their 
submarine were shrunlc to microscopic size and injected into a dying pa- 
tient's bloodstream to save him? That concept is central to this game. 

Remember games in which you shot at things as the scenery scrolled 
by, and then when you completed the level you did it all over again? And 
again and again? That's here, too. 

Sirius can't be serious with this game. When compared to its own 
Repton, Wavy Navy, or even Lemmings, Plasmania is a step backward. A 
big one. 

Plasmania is the Apple version of an Atari 800 version of an Atari 
VCS game. That should give you an idea of its simplicity. 

But what's really going on here? Is Plasmania based on the general 
plot of Fantastic Voyage, or did designer Dave Lubar come up with a 
piece of programming and decide to fit the plot around it? In the former 
case, the game has missed an excellent opportunity to take an intriguing 
plot and turn it into an equally intriguing game. Synergistic took the idea 
and came out with the educational adventure Microbe. Turning out an 
arcade-type game containing some of Microbe''?, scientific detail could 
possibly have made Plasmania a seller, instead of destined for the cellar. 

Sirius is better than this, Lubar is better than this, and they both 
know it. Let's hope it shows in the future. "TV

Jury Trial. By Vic Ratner. Few of the millions who watched Perry Ma- 
son regularly tie defense attorney Hamilton Burger in knots haven't en- 
visioned themselves in fantasy as the slick lawyer for the defense. Jury 
Trial gives weekend attorneys a chance to try their luck in court without 
jeopardizing the lives of innocent people. 

A strategy game all in text. Jury Trial emphasizes the concentration 
skills of the players. It's definitely not a game to be played solo; six is the 
ideal cast, providing a player for each role: defense attorney, prosecutor, 
and two witnesses for each side. 

As the first attempt at a computer courtroom game, Jury Trial scores 
points. It gets a few more as a change of pace. That's about it. The strat- 
egy comes in selecdng a jury and examining witnesses; everything else is a 
memory test. The jurors range from bigots to bleeding hearts; each at- 
torney gets to challenge a couple in an attempt to stack the jury favor- 
ably toward his client's cause. 

Once the jury is in place, the trial begins. Well, no, first the facts of 
the case are presented — flashed at high speed in random locations on the 
monitor. Items as detailed as the make, model, year, color, and seven- 
digit license number of the defendant's car are nearly impossible to pick 
up. Yet the entire trial and outcome rest on the witnesses' abihty to an- 
swer questions about these facts truthfully. 

What a good idea a game simulating a jury trial is! How we look for- 
ward to seeing one that lives up to the promise in the idea. Maybe even a 
later version of this one. LA8

Money Manager. By Alan R. Chap and David A. Sidewater. The pur- 
pose of a simulation program is to let you practice some activity — typi- 
cally a risky or hazardous one, such as flying an airplane — without the 
usual penalty for making mistakes. Once you have learned to do all the 
right things in various situations on the simulator, you will have a much 
better chance of surviving the experience in reality. 

Most of us will never have to pilot an airplane, but we all have to 
manage money; and you know the old line about mistakes being expen- 
sive. It would be helpful if growing persons could get some practice in 
this activity before their survival depends on it. 

Money Manager is described by the publisher as "an ideal instruc- 
tional tool for a life skills course" and is recommended for junior and 
.senior high school students and adults; but that's not quite right. For one 
thing, the program is a little young for some of that audience; and, for 
another, there's a younger audience that would love it as a game. 

Try this program on an elementary or secondary school student; or, 
better yet, try competing on it for a high score with such a student — and 
watch out for surprises! The kid is going to take it more seriously than 
you do and will probably soon learn to beat you at it. The designers of 



Money Manager may have been trying for a classroom tool for adults, 
but they have incidentally produced a fascinating strategy game for 
children. 

The program simulates an eight-week period of financial activity for 
an adult head-of-household. In that role, you get paid every two weeks, 
and you have to deal with expenses like weekly food bills and monthly 
mortgage payments. There are unexpected expenses, such as medical 
bills; but there are unexpected surprises as well — selling a manuscript or 
a painting, for example. 

You start the period with $1,000— $500 in savings, $250 in a check- 
ing account, and $250 in cash. You have opportunities to buy various 
things (such as a bicycle, a couch, or a computer), and, if you get a good 
price, that adds to your points. You can also sell these things (at a loss, of 
course) if you need money suddenly. 

You have many decisions to make during the simulation. You can 
buy insurance. The premium has to be paid every week, but if (for exam- 
ple) a fire should destroy all your possessions, they will be replaced at no 
cost. You also have to decide how much cash to carry. If you don't have 
enough, you miss out on the occasional 20-percent-off, cash-only sale at 
the store; but if you carry too much, it really hurts when you lose your 
wallet. 

There are a lot of random events in this simulation — just as there are 
in reality. 

No simulafion program can teach you to make wise decisions; only 
reality can do that. But a good simulation can teach you to recognize the 
traps before you put your foot in them. Money Manager costs as much 
as a five-dollar allowance for six weeks — and what it teaches will prob- 
ably be worth a lot more. le 
Money Manager, by Alan R. Chap and David A. Sidewater, Computer Age Edu- 
cation (Box 6227, Washington, DC 20015). $29.95. 

Dino Eggs. By David Schroeder. 

"/ believe I already know what I want, but let's have a look at the menu 
anyway, Antoine." 

'Oui, m'sieu." 

"Any preferences, Mariette?" 

"Wow, Henry, I don't know any of these. Why don't you order for us?" 

"Very well. We'll have the Hard Hat Maccaciatora and the Miner 
Flambe, with a side of Choplift aux Crevettes. Bring us two bottles of Cha- 
teau Wolfenstein '81, and Baked Aztec for dessert." 

"Oui. m'sieu. But if m'sieu will permit, may I recommend the Dino 
Eggs?" 

"Dino Eggs^" 

"Ah. oui; it is our latest arcade delicacy." 

"Oh yes. I see it here . . . in with the language card — that's a bit steep, 
Antoine." 

"But worth it, m'sieu. Succulent baby dinosaurs, in the shell or just out, 
are packed into flaky subterranean layers. As a time-traveling scientist, you \ 
warp in to gather them up and send them back to your time for preserva- 
tion, while taking care not to contaminate them. The whole is exotically 
seasoned with just the right touch of danger in the form of prehistoric spi- 
ders roaming the caves, whose touch can eventually mutate and devolve you. 
As a major ingredient, one large maternal brontosaurus, lightly steamed, 
may deposit her foot upon your head at any moment. This is exquisitely 
counterbalanced by the building of fires to hold her at bay — all carefully 
timed to ensure maximum suspense while you complete your task." 

"Why, Antoine, that sounds absolutely extraordinary." ^ 

"Indeed, m'sieu: Chef Schroeder's unique signature is recognizable in 
every byte, just as in his Crisis Mountain creation. This is, however, his 
piece de resistance, and, as such, truly resembles nothing else." 

"Delightful. Leave the disk in the drive, will you?" 

"Oui. And for you. madame?" 

"Oh, just a light snack attack. Til have little bits of his." 
"Very well, madame." 
"Gee, Henry, how exciting!" 

" Yes indeed, Mariette. And afterward, what say we stroll over to Flip- 
pers for some frozen yogurt and a giant cookie?"

Ms. Withit types /Q to quit the OAG, logs off CompuServe, con- 
tacts her travel agent to make a reservation, and calls her sister. 

This particular scenario is fictitious — except for the OAG informa- 
tion. But one is tempted to finish the story. 

Ms. Withit enjoys a weekend at Cape Cod, arriving relaxed at the 
eleven o'clock meeting. She smugly submits her $88 expense voucher to 
J.D., having enjoyed a weekend trip with flight paid for by the compa- 
ny. Mr. Notwithit submits an expense voucher for $218, the only fare 
available when his secretary and the travel agent finally stopped calling 
each other. 

This is just one example of why you should learn to use the OAG; 
there are as many others as there are flights and passengers. 

The electronic edition of the Official Airline Guide database con- 
tains approximately seven hundred thousand flight schedules for six hun- 
dred fifty airlines serving one hundred five thousand city pairs. It is avail- 
able through direct subscription, CompuServe, and various other con- 
nection services. The database contains schedules for all direct flights and 
thousands of connecfing fiights operating throughout the world, and al- 
though international fare information currently is unavailable, plans are 
to provide it sometime next year. Fare information is provided for all di- 
rect flights and connections in North America. 

Unlocking the Code. Using the OAG is relatively simple, once you're 
accustomed to reading the fairly crypfic codes. Let's take a moment to 
figure them out. Look at the first example again:

The first column is the line number. You use that to request addifional 
information about that specific flight. The next column is departure time 
(local), then departure airport. BWI is Baltimore. If you don't recognize 



the airport designafion, you can query it with a preceding '?' and the 
OAG will identify it for you. The fourth column is arrival time (local) for 
the destination in the fifth column. The sixth column is the airline — Del- 
ta, Piedmont, and so forth — followed by the flight number. The eighth 
column is the equipment — LlOll, DC-10, 727, or whatever. The ninth 
column lists the meal served B, L, D, S — breakfast, lunch, dinner, or 
snack. The final column is the number of stops en route. If you're look- 
ing for a nonstop flight on a direct flight schedule, check this column for 
a zero. 

You can access either schedules or fares directly and switch back and 
forth between them. Our fictitious scenario demonstrated a schedule ac- 
cess. You can use the same "formula" to call up fare information. Sup- 
pose you wanted the cheapest fare between Los Angeles and Boston on 
July 23. After accessing the OAG, you would type: 

/F LAX; Boston 23 Jul 

You can use full city names, airport designations, or combinations of 
the two. The display accessed by the above request is:

Do-It-Yourself Specials. Why not just let your travel agent look it 
up? There are good reasons, one of which is that by doing it yourself you 
know for sure you've got the cheapest flight, the agent doesn't have to 
call you back and ask if an eleven o'clock departure is okay, you don't 
have to discuss it with your spouse and then call the agent, and so on. 
And there are numerous possibilities your travel agent has no interest in 
telling you about and you have no way of asking about. 

Let's see what we get when we look at connections. From the last dis- 
play, we type S to return to schedules and then type CX.

The flights on lines 1 and 3 aren't too appealing. You have no interest in 
spending an hour in the Dallas— Fort Worth Airport, or in Saint Louis. 
But the flight on line 2 goes to JFK. Isn't that the other New York air- 
port? You're unsure, so you type: ? JFK. 



•RESPONSE TO YOUR HELP REOUEST* 



JFK = 

NEW YORK,NY,USA/J.F. KENNEDY 

Good. Now, the American Airlines flight on line 2 gets into JFK at 
6:03 p.m. and requires a plane change for the connection to Boston. 
However, you have good friends in New York who'd love to meet you 
at the airport for dinner and your stopover of three hours would permit a 
nice visit. You get into Boston at 10: 14 p.m. instead of 8:35 p.m. and the 
flight costs twenty dollars extra. But maybe it's worth it to you. The 
point is, only you know whether you can take advantage of various 
schedules. When you ask travel agents for the cheapest flight to Boston, 
they aren't going to ask if you'd like to spend another twenty dollars and 
have dinner in New York. 

See the USA. The possibilities for creative scheduling are limitless 
when you have access to all the schedules and fares yourself. Suppose 
you see an ad for a cheapie llight to Houston. You may not want to go to 
Houston, but perhaps you can launch yourself inexpensively from there 



to a destination you favor. Or suppose you take a direct flight from Los 
Angeles to Chicago for business that concludes on a Friday and you 
don't need to be back to L.A. until Monday. Where might you spend the 
weekend? Just call up the connecting schedules for flights from Chicago 
to Los Angeles and find out. 

Using OAG's commands to see connecting flights, fares, and so on is 
quick and simple. Each display, as you can see from the examples, in- 
cludes the menu options available from that particular display. 

Also, you can get a narrative explanation of the commands, at Com- 
puServe rates (no surcharge), by typing Go OAG and selecting the ap- 
propriate menu option. Further, there's an OAG Help Desk with a toll- 
free number (800) 323-4000. 

Yes, there's a surcharge for using the OAG. As mentioned in the 
opening scenario, the standard rate (after 6:00 p.m. and on weekends) is 
twenty-one dollars an hour, plus the standard CompuServe service rate. 
Prime time (weekdays, 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.) charges are thirty-two dol- 
lars an hour, on top of the information service prime rates. Using the 
OAG through CompuServe during prime time works out to about ninety 
cents a minute: standard time at about forty-five cents a minute. Our Ms. 
Withit might have spent a couple of dollars for the few frames of infor- 
mation she required. On the other hand, she saved her department's trav- 
el budget more than a hundred dollars. That's a pretty good return on an 
investment of two bucks. 

If you expect to use the service frequently, you may be interested in a 
direct subscription, rather than accessing through CompuServe. There's 
a one-time charge of fifty dollars and usage is billed in units, with a unit 
equal to ten cents for one minute: additionally, every schedule screen dis- 
play costs two units, every fare display three. 

Better than Kansas City. OAG fares are updated daily, schedules 
weekly. Approximately one hundred fifty airlines worldwide have direct 
access to the OAG database and update their own schedules and fare in- 
formation continuously. British Airways, for example, has terminals in 
both New York and London with the capability of inputting to the data- 
base in real-time mode. 

OAG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dun and Bradstreet, processes 
new information constantly at its headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois. 
Although the database is down between 4:30 and 5:00 a.m. Central Time 
for updating, according to Dave Shaffer, OAG's senior vice president of 
electronic publishing, "updating only takes about five minutes." 

Shaffer is one of the forty to fifty of OAG's employees "dedicated" to 
the electronic edition. The design of the electronic edition, which has 
been under development for the past three years, was not, says Shaffer, 
to have a separate division; almost all nine hundred OAG employees 
have input and responsibility. 

The print edition of the OAG dates from 1929, when the company 
was founded, but the electronic edition has been on-line only since May 
I . Its prototype ran until February and certain design features are still be- 
ing incorporated, such as randomization of competing airlines with iden- 
tical schedules and/or fares. You won't always see American Airlines 
preceding United. 

You, Me, and ITT. Who uses the OAG? Of the one hundred ten 
thousand subscribers (anticipated at two hundred thousand by Septem- 
ber) — three thousand direct subscribers plus those who access through 
various database services — 65 percent are business accounts. Only 35 
percent are travel agents and airiines. The friendly OAG EE was de- 
signed for the untrained, unknowledgeable user, not for the travel 
professional. 

In addition to friendliness, there's a "fair deal" for the traveler that 
was previously unavailable. Even if your travel agent wants to secure you 
the cheapest flight, it may not be possible. Ninety percent of the agents 
use automated systems, it's true, but most are provided by a sponsoring 
airline. The implications are fairly apparent. 

You do, of course, still need an agent for availability information and 
booking. But at least when it comes to fares and schedules you've got a 
choice. Lots of choices. All the choices. 

Bon voyage!

•APPLE IS A REGISTERED TRADE MARK OF YOU-KNOW-WHO 



BEAGLE BASIC 

APPLESOFT ENHANCER 
by MARK SIMONSEN 



Requires Apple He (or 11/11+ with RAM Card)— 

Normally, Applesoft is unchangeable. What you 
see is what you get. But BEAGLE BASIC puts 
Applesoft into RAM, letting you customize and 
enhance it. The following functions may be 
added at ZERO COST IN MEMORY- 
RENAME ANY COMMAND or Error Mes- 
sage. You can literally re-write Applesoft with 
new commands. For program protection, encryp- 
tion, or even foreign translation! Even the new 
commands that follow are re-nameable: 

ELSE: Common in many programming lan- 
guages, but missing from Applesoft until now. 
ELSE follows If-Then statements, like this— 
IF X=2 THEN PRINT "Yes": ELSE PRINT "No" 

SWAP: Normally, to swap two variable values, 
you need a 3rd variable & an extra split-second. 
SWAP X,Y exchanges values in one quick step. 

TONE: Beagle Basic's TONE P, L command 
plays a note of Pitch P, Length L. It's simple — no 
messy Pokes or Calls are ever necessary. 

HSCRN: If you have ever used Lo-Res's SCRN 
command, you'll appreciate HSCRN X,Y for find- 
ing the off/on status of any hl-res dot. 

7XT2: Allows Text Page 2 to act like Page 1 , for 
printing, listing, etc. Switching pages opens up a// 
kinds of programming possibilities. 

MIX, PAGE, RESL and MODE: No more 
awkward graphics screen-switch pokes. For ex- 
ample, type PAGE1 or PAGE2 to switch pages, 
instead of POKE -16300,0 or POKE -16299,0 
{never look-up those darn Pokes again!). 

GOTO & GOSUB may now be followed by 
variables. Use English-like commands such as 
"GOSUB COUNTER" or "GOTO SONG", where 
COUNTER and SONG have been assigned line- 
number values. "GOTO 3+X", etc., legal too. 

ESCAPE-CURSOR: Normally, you can't tell 
if you are in Escape Mode (moving the cursor). 
With Beagle Basic, hitting ESC temporarily 
changes the normal cursor to a flashing "+". 

BETTER BEEP: Select one-of-many more 
pleasing tones for Apple's control-G Bell. 

PLUS: Bonus Screen Formatter & Editor, new 
1-word commands to replace awkward Apple 
text Calls, new commands to scroll text up and 
down, not possible before Beagle Basic. And... 

INVERSE REM STATEMENTS Too: 

Makes REM-statements appear as bold stand- 
out headlines in your Applesoft listings. 

BEAGLE BASIC $34.95 

Requires standard Apple lie (or Apple II or 11+ with RAM Card). 
Includes Peeks & Pokes Chart and Apple Tip Book #6.

A hundred times a day, you type "CATALOG" 
and "LIST", and the appropriate data dutifully, 
appears on your monitor... then promptly scrolls 
off the top of the screen into Hyper-Space. If the 
information you are looking for goes by, you 
must List or Catalog again to find it. 
Double-Take has a solution— 

2-WAY-SCROLLING 

List programs and Catalog disks with the added 
ability to CHANGE SCROLL-DIRECTION using 
the Apple Arrow Keys. Your monitor becomes a 
"Search Window" to be moved UP AND DOWN 
through Catalogs and Listings at will. 

IMPROVED LIST-FORMAT:* (optional) 
Each program state- 
ment is listed on a 
new line for easy 
tracing of program 
flow, and efficient, 
FAST de-bugging. 

Commands are 
properly-spaced (1- 
space between 
words, not two) and 
much easier to fol- 
low. Printer listings, 
in any width, are sup- 
ported too.

PRONTO-DOS 

HIGH-SPEED DOS/DOS-MOVE UTILITY 
by TOM WEISHAAR 



PRONTO-DOS triples the speed of Apple's Disk 
Operating System, adds new DOS features, and 
lets you load DOS into auxiliary memory for an 
EXTRA 10K of programmable memory space! 
Here is a comparison with normal Apple DOS — 



Function Nonnal Pronto 

BLOAD HI-RES IMAGE 10 sec. 3 sec. 

LOAD 60-SECTOR PROGRAM 16 sec. 4 sec. 
SAVE 60-SECTOR PROGRAM 24 sec. 9 sec. 
BLOAD LANGUAGE CARD . . 13 sec. 4 sec. 
(Text Files: no change) 

New, unprotected, high-speed disks (as many as 
you want), are created with the normal INIT 
command. Or your existing disks may be 
updated. Booting Pronto or any updated disk in- 
stalls high-speed DOS in your Apple. 

Moving DOS to your Apple II or 11+ RAM Card 
or Apple I le standard high-memory will free up a 
whopping 10,000 EXTRA BYTES (that's 10K!) of 
valuable programmable memory space. 

ProntoDOS gives you 15 EXTRA SECTORS of 
disk storage space, almost one full track! This is 
space that is normally wasted by Apple DOS. 

With ProntoDOS in your Apple, all disk cata- 
logs will feature a Free-Space-On-Disk display, 
every time you Catalog. A great benefit! 

ProntoDOS allows you to add a handy new 
"TYPE" COMMAND that reveals the contents of 
Apple Text Files. For example, the command 
"TYPE INFO" will print everything (to screen or 
printer) that is in the Text file named "INFO". 

ProntoDOS is compatible with all DOS Com- 
mands, GPLE® and most of your programs.

MONEY STREET 
SAVES YOU MONEY 
EIGHT DIFFERENT WAYS 

"] _ You save income taxes. If you file an IRS 1040 
and Schedule A, Money Street will catch every 
deduction and tax credit in your checkbook. No 
more lost deductions. 

2 You save on CPA fees. At tax time, you'll get 
neat, clean print -outs of income, deductions, 
and tax credits, which saves CPA time. 

3 _ You save by tax planning. Use Money Street in 

conjunction with any Apple tax preparation 
program, and create a "trial 1040" before year's 
end. See next year's tax obligation this year. 

If you earn more than $25,000, your "trial 1040" 
might mean thousands saved. 

4 You save acco unting time. For users who run a 
small business, own real estate, or offer 
professional services. Money Street can 
generate 90% of data needed for ledgers and 
journals. 

5 You save on int erest and service charges 
' because Money Street maintains exact 

minimum balances. 

g _ You sav e NSF charges. Some banks now 
charge you $15 for each check. 

"7 _ You save credit charges because Money Street 
controls credit card accounts too. 

g_ You save because Money Street can change 
your fi nancial attitudes. It's so much fun to use, 
you'll actually look forward to "bank 
statement" day. Better yet. Money Street 
gives you instant answers about income and 
spending. 

It's called Money Street. It can cut your 
taxes, watch your budget, or save accounting fees. 

The idea is simple. As the computer balances your 
checkbook, it creates a valuable library of financial 
facts that can be sorted, listed.totaled, scanned, 
printed, or viewed. 

For example, it can print totals of your tax 
deductions, credits, and income. You'll save hours 
of accounting time. You can get estimated amounts 
any time for tax planning. Or, if you run a small 
business, you q^n print year-to-date (and monthly) 
totals of sales, departmental expenses, or salaries. 
All categories are user-defined, so you can choose 
v^^ich items to track. 

Besides this. Money Street does your checkbook 
and bank statement chores. It gets you in balance 
and keeps you there. The program prints seven 
separate audit reports, creates an easy-to-access 
cancelled check file, and gives you a detailed report 
of each reconciliation session. 

AddKional Features. 

• Split entries between codes. 

• Fast machine language programming. Nine 
seconds from start-up to data entry. 

• Handles unlimited checkbooks. 

• Edit anything, any time. 

• Credit card accounting. 

• Cash accounting. 

• Press Ctrl-Q for help screen. 



15 Ready-to-print reports! Press four 
keys and the program will print any of 15 different 
reports. Just select from the Report Menu, and the 
program does the rest. Start-up to print time is 
usually 20 seconds. Reports include: 



1 . Monthly code totals 

2. To-date code totals 

3. Sort by amount 

4. List code dictionary 

5. Sort by payee 

6. List deposits 

7. List un'cid checks 

8. List un'cid deposits 



9. List all entries 

10. Sort by date cleared 

1 1 . Print check registry 

12. Print selected month 

13. Print selected code 

14. List code totals 

15. List monthly totals 



How it works. On your computer screen, 
you ceate a facsimile of youi checkbook. You see 
17 items per screen and can scroll for more. As the 
computer balances your checking account, you give 
each check or deposit its own category code. You 
get 100 you name'em codes. Press Ctrl-0 and see a 
code dictionary. To set up codes, just type them in. 
You can add, delete, or change codes any time 
without affecting data.

Money Street's most amazing feature 

is its "real time" data bank. It accumulates year-to- 
date totals for each of the 100 categories. You see 
these totals instantly. Just enter a check, and look 
at the bottom of the screen. The year-to-date total 
will flash into view with each new entry. 

Pays for itself. Money Street keeps things 
simple and keeps them honest. It can pay for itself 
ten times over just by saving the cost of organizing 
and totaling data. As one customer put it: "Why 
pay my $100-an-hour CPA to count beans?" 



Happy customers. For us, the best thing 
about Money Street is our happy customers. Every 
day we get letters like the one from Jerry Losse of 
New York who wrote: "I'm very pleased. Money 
Street does everything but go to the bank". 

• Keller Watson of California wrote saying, "The 
speed of operation is fantastic, the double cursor 
is a help to tired old eyes, and the data bank totals 
are worth the price of the whole program." 

• A.W. Matthews of Colorado wrote to say, "...it is 
truly a relief to purchase software that does as 
advertised." 

• William Sampar of Fairfax Station, Virginia wrote: 
"Money Street is everything you claim it to be. I 
love it. I love its speed and ease of operation." 

• Glenn Rodkin, president of Oklahoma City Apple 
Users Group wrote; "Tremendous! It's fast, 
reliable and covers all the contingencies a 
checkbook program should." 

• Michael Salesin of West Bloomfield, Michigan 
wrote: "When next year's tax season rolls around 
my accountant will send you love and kisses." 

• Howard Serotta of Lansdale, Pennsyvania said: ' 
am totally pleased with Money Street. I like the 
sub-totals, the speed, and the many print 
options." 

• Hisher Logic of San Luis Obispo, California wrote: 
"It's doing all my bookkeeping (six accounts) — 
what a time-saver." 

• Gary Rominger of Sacramento, California wrote: 
"It works! I love it! Your claim of 30 minutes to 
learn it is fully justified." 

If you own real estate. Money Street tracks rents, 
tallies repair costs, and helps establish "cost basis" 
for capital gain tax treatment. It's also ideal for trust 
accounting, retail stores, and home budgeting. 

Money back no matter what. Why not 

give us a try? If you aren't delighted, we'll give you e 
full refund on any mail order purchase from us.

Mind Your 




BY PETER OLIVIERI 




You know how you feel when the weather is hot and humid — you'd 
like to jump into a nearby swimming pool, run through a fire-hydrant 
spray, or head for the air-conditioned office. Well, your Apple wouldn't 
mind doing the same kind of thing when the weather gets warm. We tend 
to think of our Apples as much more durable than they really are, but it's 
important to realize that computers. are a bit sensitive to changes in tem- 
perature — in fact, heat, along with dust, is among a micro's major 
enemies. 

It's wise to keep your machine in a cool place. Install a fan if neces- 
sary (a variety of fans are specifically designed to attach to an Apple). It's 
particularly important to consider purchasing a fan if you've added a lot 
of peripherals to your system; an Apple loaded with a printer card, an 
eighty-column card, a disk controller, and a language card can generate a 
lot of internal heat. Couple this with a hot environment and you are toy- 
ing with trouble. It's also important to be aware that putting your equip- 
ment in a spot that gets very warm can result in heat-caused internal 
damage even if you have a fan; after all, since your computer's not on all 
the time, neither is your fan. The point here is, of course, that fore- 
warned is forearmed. Don't get caught wishing you'd taken better care of 
your Apple's health. 

While we're on the subject of health, it won't hurt to review briefly a 
few of the standard operating principles we all tend to get lazy about. 
Perhaps phrasing them as Murphy's Micro Laws is the best way to bring 
these points home. 

1 . A disk that does not have a backup copy lasts half as long as a 
disk that does. ( When did you make your last backup?) 

2. The probability that a disk without a label will be reinitialized ac- 
cidentally is greater than one. (Are all of your disks labeled? Are the labels 
accurate?) 

3. The number of electrical problems you are likely to have is equal 
to the number of plugs you have connected to one outlet, times ten. 
(Take a quick look at how safe your electrical connections are.) 

4. The size of the repair bill for your Apple is equal to five times the 
weight of the things you have sitting on top of the machine. ( Is that heavy 
color television set still on top of your Apple?} 

5. The expected life, in months, of your microcomputer is inversely 
proportional to the height of the dust on the power supply. ( Do you have 
a dust cover?) 

6. The life of a printer ribbon is ten minutes less than the time it 
takes to print your most critical report. (Have you checked your supply 
cabinet lately?) 

7. The probability that you'll have a problem with a software or 
hardware product is equal to the height (in inches) of the warranty cards 
sitting on your desk. ( Why not fill them out now and send them in?) 

8. The cost of repairing your Apple any one time is equal to fifteen 
dollars times the number of drink containers sitting on your computer ta- 
ble. (Do users eat and drink while working at your machine?) 

Planning, Controlling, Decision Making. Managers, if they are real- 
ly managers, must be constantly involved in planning, making decisions 
to bring about certain objectives, and getting feedback to control things 
along the way. Feedback is crucial to managerial decision making; it pro- 



vides information needed to ensure that the objectives specified are 
actually met. 

Consider for a moment what happens when you sit in a chair for a 
long period of time with one of your legs tucked underneath you. When 
you try to stand up, you discover that your foot has fallen asleep — what 
has happened is that the feedback sensors at the base of your foot are no 
longer functioning. And without feedback, you cannot exercise the con- 
trol needed to accomplish your goal (to stand up). 

Your computer can be an important tool in decision making; it can 
provide the feedback you need to make and monitor business decisions. 

All too often, business people use the computer merely as a data 
processor — a producer of labels, mailing lists, or form letters. This is not 
to downgrade these important functions; they do save time, and time is a 
very valuable commodity to a manager. There is, however, another

TORY 
ERS 



DOES YOUR PRESENT SYSTEM 
PROVIDE YOU WITH THE 
INFORMATION YOU WANT WHEN YOU 
WANT IT AND IN THE FORMAT 
YOU WANT in 

S.S.R.'s provided computerized business solutions for 
13 yrs. We've learned what you need and we'll satisfy 
those needs with INFOTORY™. Our software utilizes all 
the flexibility and potential of the APPLE III. 

INFOTORY™ provides you with a system that's easy to 
learn and use, that satisfies the requirements of inven- 
tory accounting, and most importantly, provides you 
with information reporting capability that can't be 
provided manually and isn't provided in any other 
computerized inventory system. 

We accomplished this with ANYREPORT™, our unique 
reporting feature that sets INFOTORY™ apart from any 
other system. Using it, you can get: 

■ Quantities, amount sold, cost of sales by vendor, by 
product type, or even by key words like "green" or 
inch" within the description (sect, green sofa or fitting 
% inch copper). 

■ Any data you want— in alphabetical, description, 
p/n, location, descending sales order, or in whatever 
order and with whatever data your purchasing function, 
accountant, warehouse or sales people need to per- 
form their jobs better. 

■ Summarized sales and cost of sales information by 
product category, by vendor or by each item— MTD 
and YTD. 

How long would it take you to sort through and list, in 
whatever order, your inventory items costing between 
$13.00 &. $21.00, purchased from XYZ company, that 
have a gross profit of between 25% &. 32%, that you 
have more than 10 of in stock? Use ANYREPORT", walk 
away and the report's ready when you return. This is 
only one of the many benefits of ANYREPORT". 

To learn more about the many benefits that INFOTORY™, 
for the APPLE II or the APPLE III, can bring to your 
business, give us a call or stop in at your nearest 
dealer.

stage, or level, of use to which the computer can be put. At this level, the 
computer assists its owner in the performance of sensitivity analysis of 
the effects various decisions may have. VisiCalc models are one good 
example of the computer being used in this way. In many VisiCalc mod- 
els, the user can change the ground rules or assumptions and quickly see 
how this affects the results of the model being tested. 

It's worth taking a few minutes to consider the other uses to which 
your computer might be put. Do you use a spreadsheet program to ask 
"what if kinds of questions? Does your setting involve applications in 
which statistical analysis (such as frequency distributions, cross-tabula- 
tions, or averages) would be helpful? Are you using your computer for 
forecasting purposes? Have you considered using a graphics package to 
enhance your reports? Are you doing any scheduling by computer? Do 
you have applications in which optimization models, such as linear pro- 
gramming, would be useful? Have you considered using a modem to tie 
in to an information-resource utility? 

There are many ways the computer can be used to save time and fa- 
cilitate better business decisions. With this in mind, next month we'll be- 
gin a series profiling how various readers use their Apples to help them 
make better decisions. If you're using your Apple in ways that contrib- 
ute to your planning, controlling, and decision-making activities, speak 
up; user-group members, let's hear from you. 

Keeping Literate. As a business user you may not want to know 
everything there is to know about the inner workings of the Apple. If 
you're like most people, however, you're likely to be interested in under- 
standing the computer terms you see frequently in the literature. 

One such term is megabyte. Regular readers of this column will re- 
call that a byte is the amount of memory required to store one character 
of information (either a letter or a number). Thus, a disk with 150K bytes 
of storage is capable of storing some one hundred fifty thousand charac- 
ters of information. The prefix mega stands for million, so one mega- 
byte is, roughly, one million characters; actually, a megabyte can store 
1,048,576 characters. This number is arrived at by raising two to the 
twentieth power. 

Because of the increase in the storage capacity of memory chips and 
disks, the term megabyte is showing up more and more often. There is 
now a small chip that can contain two hundred fifty-six thousand char- 
acters, and Apple's new Lisa computer has a one-million-character main 
memory capacity. Enclosed disk drives (so-called Winchester disks) have 
capacities of five, ten, and fifty megabytes. It is certainly sufficient to 
know that a megabyte can contain roughly a million characters. 

Seen a UNIX Lately? It sounds like some kind of animal, doesn't it? 
Basically, UNIX is an oiJerafing system. As we mentioned last time in 
speaking of CP/M, an operating system essentially tells the computer 
how to operate. The operating system is an important part of a micro- 
computer system, and its designers try very hard to make it easy to use. 

Professional programmers really like UNIX because it facilitates the 
development of applications programs. Although UNIX is a popular 
and powerful operating system, it's unlikely that we'll see a reasonably 
good version of it for the Apple; UNIX was designed to run on a differ- 
ent type of machine. 

Spooling is yet another strange-sounding term you may have heard. It 
comes up primarily in discussions about printers. Most people have ex- 
perienced the frustration of having to wait while the printer attached to 
the Apple prints out a particularly long report or large spreadsheet. 
While engaged in this activity, your computer is not available to do any- 
thing else. But if you could "wrap your program around a spool" and 
unravel it (print it) as needed, you might be able to use it for other things. 

Spooling is done by a program that sits in main memory and moni- 
tors the use of your computer (when you are hitting the keys) and the op- 
eration of the printer. The spooling process allows you to use your com- 
puter at the same time that printing is taking place. By the way, vendors 
are now promoting a hardware device that sits between your computer 
and your printer. The material to be printed is sent to this "middleman" 
and resides in memory there, totally freeing up the computer to do other 
things. We'll look more closely at such hardware devices in a future 
column. 

VisiCalc Users. The popularity of VisiCalc has given rise to a large 
number of supporting products created by various vendors. Some of 





Whether you have a small re- 
tail company, manage a service 
agency or run a cattle ranch, you 
have to do something else well 
to build a business— manage 
money. 

You've got to analyze cash 
flow, see trends and forecast 
profitability in a time and cost 
effective manner. 

The right fit. 

A computerized account- 
ing system makes sense, 
but finding the right soft- 
ware is important. The 
"home checkbook" pro- 
grams are easy to use but 
they don't have the ad- 
vanced reporting capabilities you need. And many 
small businesses just don't need the complexity or the 
cost of the modular systems. 

Practical Accountant is a single entry, small busi- 
ness accounting program that comes complete in one 
package. It's friendly enough to balance your check- 
book, yet sophisticated enough to give you the kind of 
money management information you need for a suc- 
cessful business. 

We could have called it 
"Accounting Made Easy". 

Practical Accountant is designed around funda- 
mental accounting procedures. Even if you don't 
know much about accounting it is an ideal program. 

The manual explains basic accounting terminology 
and provides a comprehensive tutorial. It will take you 
step-by-step through the process of setting up a com- 
plete, single entry accounting system you can begin 
using right away. 



It's quick to learn and 
convenient to use. 

The program guides you with 
easy-to-use menus and provides 
on the screen prompting. 
"HELP" is never more than a 
keystroke away. It even does 
some of your work for you like 
organizing entries in date order 
even if you don't. 

It's very flexible. You set it 
up to fit your business. 

Practical Accountant allows 
you to set up your "Chart of Ac- 
counts" (income and expense 
categories) with up to 50 cate- 
gories, 300 sub-categories and 
with 20 tax type definitions — all 
defined by you. The manual shows you how to set up 
an accounting system for a small business, complete 
with samples. 

Cash Flow Reporting — 

money management information. 

Perhaps the most valuable feature of the program 
is the cash flow reporting capability. You can look at 
cash flow by category, by sub-category and by tax type 
to analyze profitability, tax consequences and general 
performance. All of your reports are professionally 
formatted and you have access to profitability infor- 
mation that leads to sound business management. 

There is more to this success story. 

If you would like to know more about Practical Ac- 
countant your dealer can give you a great demonstra- 
tion and a brochure with a more complete story, or

these products are useful, while others have little merit. One useful prod- 
uct is CalcPad, a double-sided ledger-coding sheet for use in explaining 
and documenting templates constructed using VisiCalc and other spread- 
sheet programs. 

Quite frankly, most of the difficulties users have with spreadsheet 
programs are associated not with using the programs themselves but 
with constructing models. This is particularly true when models be- 
come large and cumbersome. Most model builders make notes to docu- 
ment what they have done, and often these notes begin to acquire notes 
of their own, resulting in documentation that is weak at best. If you've 
gone to the trouble of listing out the formulas (contents) of your spread- 
sheet using the normal VisiCalc commands, you know already that 
doing this doesn't provide a particularly useful reference. 

CalcPad makes a real difference in this regard, providing a valuable 
service. It is to be used as the first step in designing a model. If you use 
CalcPad, your final model will likely be well thought out and relatively 
error-free. 

The layout of the CalcPad itself is well thought out. The upper left- 
hand corner has room for information about the disk on which the 
model will reside and the author of the model. The upper right-hand cor- 
ner provides space in which to record what global characteristics are in 
effect. 

The main portion of the ledger pad contains sixteen VisiC alc-Wke. col- 
umns and thirty similar rows. Some room at the bottom of the page is re- 
served to record any formulas that are too long to fit into one of the cells 
on the sheet, along with information about replications that have been 
made. The replication informafion section is particularly helpful; you can 
use it to keep track of the source and target ranges of any replications 
and to record which of the variables in the formula being replicated are 
relafive and which are no change. 

The back of the form provides space in which to enter information 
on how to use your template — that is, how to "run" the model. Space is 
also allotted for supplying instructions about running the model and in- 
formation about how files are to be handled (are DIF files to be used? 



Are various windows to be set? Are any overlay files needed?). 

This pad can be very helpful — indeed invaluable — to users in plan- 
ning out models. Sheets from the pad can also become a permanent part 
of the documentation of particular models. 

The Krandel Affair. One of the nicest parts about writing this col- 
umn is getting to help regular readers solve some of their problems. The 
response to a plea for help from Robert Krandel of San Jose, California, 
was especially pleasing. Krandel had an application in which he needed 
to be able to determine the number of salespersons who had sales that 
fell within certain ranges. For example, he wanted to know how many 
salespersons had sales between $100 and $200, how many had sales 
between $201 and $300, and so on. 

Clearly, this became a real challenge to our readers; dozens of pro- 
posed solutions were submitted. Many thanks to everyone who re- 
sponded, particularly Roy Bruno, who sent along a disk containing his 
VisiCalc solution to the problem. 

The solution offered here incorporates some of the characteristics of 
well-designed models: namely, it's short, it's clear, and it works. The de- 
sign includes the lookup function. Dwight R. Gard of Lubbock, Texas, is 
the author of this fine solution. 

The template shown on the following page is one example of a 
solution to Krandel's problem. 

The actual sales figures are set in cells A3 through Al 3. In cell B3, the 
expression (ajLOOKUP(A3,C3...C13) is entered and replicated from 84 
through 813. The A3 is relative and C3 through CI 3 are no change. 
At 815, you use the expression @SUM(83...813). Next, you install the 
lookup table in cells C3 through C13. This is where the desired ranges are 
entered. 8e sure to enter them in ascending order. In cells D3 through 
DI3the boolean values 0 or 1 are entered. Initially, these values are all 0. 

Once you've decided what the appropriate ranges are to be, you can 
decide which range you are interested in (for example, sales between $2(X) 
and $299). Next to the lower end of the range (in this example, $200), en- 
ter a 1 as the lookup value. All the values outside that range remain at 0. 
After the 1 is inserted next to any other values in the appropriate range.

# IN RANGE

the model is recalculated and the sum at B15 is displayed. Since only 
those sales that fell in that range will have the lookup value of 1 inserted 
in column B, the sum at 815 will be the count of how many salespersons 
fell within that range. 

If you insert the names of your salespeople, it's very easy to see who it 
is that meets the specified criteria. And overall, it is very easy to change 
the ranges and search for the appropriate counts. While this solution re- 
quires that you inquire separately for each range of interest, its flexibility 
and ease of entry make the model very easy to use and implement. 

It would also be possible to set up multiple columns to solve such a 
model, and, in fact, many of the solutions received used the @IF com- 
mand in multiple columns to count those who fell in different ranges. The 
solution shown here was the easiest to implement. Of course, it's worth- 
while to review the operation of the ©LOOKUP command if it's unfa- 
miliar to you. 

B.L.G. S.O.S. Here are some more requests for assistance from 
Business User Group members. Edmundo Cardenas of Caracas, Vene- 
zuela, has a NEC PC 8023A-C printer and could use some help. Most of 
his printer commands are sent via a CHR$ rather than by means of a 
control keystroke. None of these commands seems to be working. Any 
help, suggestions, or references that might help Cardenas use this printer 
to print Spanish characters will be appreciated; in particular, Cardenas 
would like to be able to have the accent mark placed over the vowels. 
This could be accomplished if the printer could be made to backspace 
and overprint. He hopes "our B.U.G. people are as good as I think they 
are." There's a challenge for you! 

Rudy Bergfield of the Netherlands writes to ask for some word proc- 
essing assistance. Bergfield has both Apple Writer II and WordStar. He 
has successfully used the Epson instructions (on an MX-80 F /T) that ap- 
peared in an earlier column but has had trouble with one particular 
printer instruction, the one for underscoring. Bergfield feels that the 
problem he's experiencing may have something to do with the eighty-col- 
umn card he's using (a Vision 80 card with a preboot disk that enables 
Apple Writer to use eighty columns). In the eighty-column mode, using 
control- V and then escape- 1 to initiate underscoring works fine, but it 
cannot be turned off. In eighty-column mode, using escape shift control- 
P does not turn off the underlining, but it does work when Bergfield uses 
Apple Writer in forty-column mode. (Incidentally, underlining using the 
reverse slash before and after also works, but it doesn't give the continu- 
ous line Bergfield sometimes needs.) Anyone out there with a Vision 80 
(or a solution)? 

Wrap-up. By the way, while there's often a lot of mail in direct re- 
sponse to B.U.G. requests for help, the old post-office box has been far 
from overflowing with those useful utilities that were asked for a few 
rnonths back. Are you using, do you know of, or have you developed 
any utilities you think other readers might find useful? Are there, for 
example, any programs available that allow you to print out a copy of 
the menus in an applications package? Have you developed an innova- 
tive way of cataloguing your files? Or maybe there are utilities you'd like 
to have but have never seen. Send in your wish list and we'll see whether 
we can match up what you want with what someone else has devised or 
knows about. 

Until next month, take care and have a pleasant August.

Jungle Fever: Part 6 



Variant RECORDS. Casting around to find some new components 
to rejuvenate his ancient (but still listenable) stereo system. Your Path- 
finder was impressed by the wide range of equipment that now features 
microprocessors. Tape recorders, amplifiers, equalizers, AM/FM tuners, 
turntables, videotape and disc systems, and many other pieces of stereo 
gear now boast "full microprocessor control." In the old days, you oper- 
ated your stereo equipment; now, you program it, and it practically op- 
erates itself. Some forward-thinking firms are even marketing interface 
packages that permit a personal computer to act as an "intelligent con- 
trol panel" for such items as laser videodisc players. 

Soon, computer interfaces will be built into all stereo and video com- 
ponents by the manufacturers, and we will be that much closer to the day 
when your home computer system and your home entertainment system 
are one and the same. Although that day is still several years in the fu- 
ture, we may certainly dream of it and prepare for it. It was during a 
blissful reverie concerning this very subject that Your Pathfinder real- 
ized a relatively painless method of introducing you to Pascal's variant 
RECORD structure. 

The Pain of Progress. Many of the latest stereo receivers and tuners 
feature "all-digital" frequency adjustment. The hapless radio listener 
must punch in the exact frequency of the desired station, using a calcula- 
tor-style numeric keypad. Most people tend to remember the call letters 
or nicknames of their favorite radio stations but find it more difficult to 
remember the radio frequencies on which those stations transmit. The 
situation is aggravated by the tendency of broadcasters to publicize their 
frequency assignments imprecisely. For instance, certain FM stations an- 
nounce themselves as "FM9I," "Z93," and "Q104," although their ac- 
tual frequencies are 91 .3 MegaHertz (MHz), 93.3 MHz, and 104.5 MHz, 
respectively. Similarly, several AM stations at 1480 kiloHertz (kHz) have 
been known to bill themselves as "The Great 148," while a well-known 
San Francisco Bay Area AM station at 1 170 kHz billed itself for many 
years as "11.7 AM!" 

Given such misleading information, how can the owner of a digital 
tuner possibly deduce the proper frequency numbers to punch when 
seeking a specific station? To help alleviate this problem, most "comput- 
er tuners" of today permit the user to record the frequency assignments 
of several favorite stations in permanent electronic memory within the 
tuner itself. Once this is accomplished, the listener can choose one of the 
preset frequencies simply by pressing the appropriate button. 

When home computers enter the picture (and perhaps even before), 
radio tuning can be made even more convenient. In particular, the user 
will be able to specify a station by its easily remembered name. Suppose 
there someday exists an interface that permits an Apple to control one of 
the new generation of AM/FM tuners. It would be a simple matter for 
the Apple to maintain a list of radio station names along with the corre- 
sponding frequency assignments. The human user would request a fa- 
vorite station by name, via the computer keyboard, and the Apple would 
then scan its table for the entry that corresponded to the given name. 



Finding it, the computer would transmit the commands necessary to ad- 
just the tuner to the proper frequency. 

Tabling the Issue. How would one go about defining a table of ra- 
dio stations in Pascal? Clearly, each entry would have to consist of a 
name and a frequency designation. These two data are most naturally ex- 
pressed as a String and a number and are most conveniently combined in 
a RECORD: 

TYPE 
Station = 
RECORD 
Name 

:String[15]; 
Frequency 
: Integer 
END (* Station *); 

Note the economy of using a fifteen-character String in place of the 
standard eighty-character model. There's no point in reserving more 
space for any field than is necessary to get the job done. Station nick- 
names and call signs are very brief; the Name field should be large 
enough to hold all call signs as well as all but the most verbose nick- 
names or slogans. If a station name is too long, one may always use the 
much shorter call sign. 

The Integer field, Frequency, is sufficient for recording AM fre- 
quency assignments such as 1 170 and 1480 kHz, but what about FM fre- 
quencies, such as 91.3 and 104.5 MHz? It is more natural to record FM 
frequencies as Real numbers. Given this, we might want to define two 
data types, AMStation and FMStation, both identical in general struc- 
ture, except that the Frequency in the first would be recorded by an In- 
teger, while the Frequency in the second would be represented by a Real 
number. Such a solution would solve our conceptual problem but would 
prevent us from establishing a table of radio stations that includes both 
AM and FM assignments. A table is most naturally expressed in Pascal 
as an ARRAY, or sometimes as a FILE. The rules of Pascal state that 
individual elements in either structure must all share the same data type. 

To establish two different types for station data is to force ourselves 
to construct and maintain two different tables, one for AM stations and 
one for FM stations. Lazy programmers such as Your Pathfinder would 
shy away from this kind of extra labor, opting instead (perhaps) to put 
fields for every contingency in a single RECORD definition: 

TYPE 
Station = 
RECORD 
Name 

:String[15]; 
AMFrequency 

:lnteger: 
FMFrequency 
:Real 
END (* Station *); 



194 



AUGUST 1983 



Now, both AM and FM stations may be recorded conveniently in tiie 
same table. 

To maice use of our latest version of Station, we can agree that either 
the AM Frequency or the FM Frequency — but never both — will contain 
a zero value. If AM Frequency is not zcto, then the corresponding sta- 
tion broadcasts on the AM band; otherwise, FM Frequency will be non- 
zero, indicating that the station in question is an FM outlet. Note that 
there is no field in our current definition of Station that designates trans- 
mission mode (AM or FM). Station is concerned only with transmission 
frequency, the mode must be inferred from the frequency. In other 
words, the frequency fields serve two purposes at once: one that is ex- 
plicitly suggested by the field names, and one that is implicit in the struc- 
ture of the RECORD itself. 

Frolic in the Fields, but Avoid Entanglements. When defining REC- 
ORDS, the best policy is to establish fields that are each significant in one 
and only one context. In other words, you want to use each field for a 
single, explicit purpose; you don't want to load it down with several im- 
plicit duties. In practice, you will find it difficult to adhere to this disci- 
pline. To the extent that you succeed, however, you will simplify the task 
of maintaining and improving your code at a later date. 

If a datum has several different functions, chances are that many dif- 
ferent parts of the program will need to refer to it. Conversely, if a da- 
tum serves only one purpose, you can probably isolate the code that de- 
pends upon it in a small number of prominent locations. Eventually, you 
may want to alter the structure of a particular datum in such a way that 
the majority of code that depends upon it will also have to be changed. 
When the amount of affected code is large — as it is likely to be for a mul- 
tipurpose datum — you will have a large amount of tedious work to do. 
Much less work is usually involved in changing the structures of "single- 
purpose" data objects. 

Keeping good software development practices firmly in mind, it's 
probably best to create a separate field for recording a station's trans- 
mission mode: 

TYPE 
Station = 
RECORD 
Name 

:String[15]; 
XMode 

:(AM, FM); 
AMFrequency 

: Integer; 
FMFrequency 
:Real 
END (* Station *); 

Radio trivia buffs will already have guessed that the field name XMode 
echoes "xmit," the traditional radio operator's abbreviation for 
"transmit." 

At this point, we have a RECORD structure that safisfies all the 
needs of our application. First, we can store call sign and frequency in- 
formation for both AM and FM stations in the same ARRAY or FILE. 
If code that accesses a Station entry needs to know the transmission 
mode of the corresponding station, it can check the XMode field. Given 
this knowledge, it can then go straight to the active "frequency" field and 
bypass the dormant one altogether. 

Even though our design works, however, it is somewhat ugly. For in- 
stance, why should we reserve space for both AM and FM frequency 
numbers when any given Station entry will use only one of them? Of 
course, the waste of a word or two in the definition of Station is prob- 
ably tolerable; the station table is likely to contain so few entries (no 
more than a hundred, say) that the net waste will be slight. But what 
about a table with a thousand entries'! Then, the waste of even a single 
word (two bytes) in every RECORD translates into a net loss of two- 
thousand bytes — nearly 2K of RAM! 

Variants Save Space. When RECORD fields are mutually exclusive, 
as the frequency fields are in Station, you can make use of Pascal's vari- 
ant RECORD facility to eliminate unnecessary, redundant fields. The ac- 
companying figure is the railroad diagram for a RECORD structure, 
including those paths that may be used to define a variant RECORD. 



RECORD DECLARATION 




RECORD Declaration 



Use it to verify the syntactic correctness of the following variant 
RECORD version of Station: 

TYPE 

XmitMode= (AM, FM); 
Station = 
RECORD 
Name 

:Strlng[15]; 
CASE XMode: XmitMode OF 
AM: 

(AMFrequency 
:lnteger); 

FM: 

(FMFrequency 
:Real) 

END (* Station *); 

In the new Station, the fields Name and XMode remain invariant. In 
other words, these fields will be present in all variables of type Station. 
The Pascal compiler assigns separate memory space for each variable. 
On the other hand, only one of the variant fields, AMFrequency or 
FMFrequency, will be used (active) in any particular Station variable. 
All the different variant fields exist simultaneously in a RECORD'S vari- 
ant data region. Stated another way, all the variant field definitions in a 
given RECORD are different names for (and descriptions of) the same 
area in memory. 

As you might suspect from looking at the definition of Station, the 
XMode field is especially significant. It is called the tag field of this vari- 
ant RECORD. As a tag field, XMode is the means by which your Pas- 
cal programs can decide how to interpret the contents of the variant da- 
ta region. Thus, if KXYZ is an AM station, the tag field in its table en- 
try should contain the value AM, while the variant data region entry 
should contain an Integer value that corresponds to the station's trans- 
mission frequency. Conversely, should the tag field in the table entry con- 
tain the value FM, this implies that the variant data region is occupied by 
a Real value that corresponds to the FMFrequency field. In either case, 
your programs should not attempt to access the inactive field. 

Variant Size Considerations. The sharp-eyed reader has already 
realized that the AMFrequency field, being an Integer variable, is only 
half as large as the Real-number field, FMFrequency. Yet both fields oc- 
cupy the variant data region simultaneously! When designing variant 
records, bear in mind that the variant data region in a RECORD is al- 
ways made large enough to accommodate the largest variant field. Since 
FMFrequency is the largest variant field in Station, the variant data re- 
gion in a RECORD of that type consists of four bytes (the size of a Real 
variable). When the FMFrequency field is active, the entire variant data 
region is occupied by the bit pattern that corresponds to the appropriate 
frequency, expressed as a Real number. When the AMFrequency field is 
active, only the first half of the variant data region is occupied by mean- 
ingful information (that is, by a bit pattern that corresponds to an In- 
teger number). The remaining two bytes contain useless garbage.

The size of a variant RECORD — the amount of memory it occupies 
in RAM — is the sum of the sizes of its invariant and variant data re- 
gions. A Station variable's invariant data region holds eighteen bytes: the 
Name field requires sixteen bytes, and the tag field, XMode, occupies 
two. As we've already seen, the variant data region is four bytes long, 
and so the total size of a Station entry is twenty-two bytes (eleven words). 

Whenever possible, all variant fields should occupy roughly the same 
amount of space in RAM. This will help to ensure that the variant data 
region is utilized most efficiently. If some variants are much bigger than 
others, and especially if these larger variants are only infrequently re- 
quired in a particular application, much of the variant data region may 
remain unused and ignored. For example, Pascal normally allocates 410 
bytes of RAM for any variable of the following RECORD type, due to 
the fact that a large ARRAY is one of the variants: 

TYPE 

BigVariant = 
RECORD 
First, 
Second 

ilnteger; 
Third 
:Real; 

CASE BoolTag: Boolean OF 
False: 

(TinyVar: Char); 
True: 

(BigVar: ARRAY [0 .. 99] OF Real) 
END (* BigVariant *); 

When the TinyVar variant is active, nearly all of the RAM space allo- 
cated to a BigVariant variable lies dormant and inaccessible. 

A Qoser Look. The specification of any variant data region in a 
RECORD is roughly similar in form to that of the CASE statement, 
with which we are already familiar. However, there are some important 
differences between the two, which will become clear as we dissect Sta- 
tion's definition in terms of grammar (syntax) and meaning (semantics). 

The variant CASE clause indicates to the compiler that the REC- 



ORD being defined should include a variant data region. Moreover, this 
clause establishes the name and data type of the tag field. (Although the 
tag field is introduced in the clause that establishes the variant data re- 
gion, we'll find it more useful to consider this field as a part of the invari- 
ant region, since it will be present in every RECORD.) Unlike the selec- 
tor in a CASE statement, a variant RECORD'S tag field must be an 
identifier, not an expression, since it refers to a region of memory (in 
other words, a variable). Like any variable, a tag field must also be asso- 
ciated with a data type, which must be specified by name. The special 
type XmitMode was made necessary in the latest version of Station be- 
cause the data type of a tag field may nol be specified explicitly. Tag fields 
may be based on any scalar data type except Real. 

Following the CASE clause is a list of variant fields. Each variant be- 
gins with its own list of constant values, taken from the data type of the 
tag field. A variant is considered "active" whenever any of the values in 
its constant list is contained within the tag field. Values in a constant list 
are separated from each other by commas, and the entire list concludes 
with a colon. Note that no value may appear in more than one variant 
constant list in a given RECORD declaration. Thus, the following 
TYPE definition is erroneous: 



TYPE 

TFType= 



(A, B, C); 



BadVariant = 
RECORD 

CASE TagField: TFType OF 
A: 

(IntField: Integer); 

B: 

(BoolField: Boolean); 
A, C: (* WRONG — A is not legal here *) 
(CharField: Char) 
END (* BadVariant *); 

This problem situation, however, is not detected by the Apple Pascal 
compiler, so watch out! An anomalous data definition such as this will 
not impede the compilafion or execufion of a program, but it does indi- 



LOCK-IT-UP 

DISKETTE COPY-PROTECTION 
AND DUPLICATION SYSTEMS 
FOR THE APPLE COMPUTER 

The Lock-lt-Up systems are sophisticated, menu driven 
copy-protection and duplication utilities for the Apple II 
Computer. They feature several levels of protection which 
make standard diskettes uncopyable by even the most 
sophisticated nibble copy programs currently available. 

• All sectors on the diskette can still be used. 

• Data files can be loaded and/or saved to either the protected diskette 
or an unprotected diskette. 

• Memory will be cleared and the disk will reboot if the reset key is 
pushed. 

• The copying systems support up to 14 disk drives. 

• Complete data-verification is optional during copy. 

• Sequential serial numbers are assigned to each diskette produced by 
the system 

• Master diskettes created with the system contain an I.D. stamp that 
you select. The I.D. stamp must be correctly specified before any 
diskettes can be duplicated. This prevents other Lock-lt-Up owners 
from copying your diskettes. 

• Extensive support is provided should you have any problems or 
special needs. 

• Our system is supported by numerous disk copying services should 
you need a large quantity of diskettes duplicated. 

Either system is available for $225, which includes three diskettes, an 
informative manual, and a non-exclusive license to copy as many 
diskettes as needed.

cate a certain lack of discipline and understanding on the part of the pro- 
grammer, which may be reflected in more serious errors at other points 
in the code. 

Following each variant constant list is a parenthetical sequence of da- 
ta items, which constitutes the variant field that is associated with the 
given list of constants. Except that it begins with an "open-parenthesis" 
mark instead of the keyword RECORD, and ends with a "close-paren- 
thesis" mark instead of the keyword END, a variant field is identical in 
structure to a RECORD body. In other words, a single variant field may 
contain many different subfields, and may also contain embedded REC- 
ORDS (even variant ones!). 

Finally, the definition of the variant data region is concluded with the 
keyword END. According to the rules of Pascal, a RECORD may con- 
tain only one variant data region, the definition of which must be the last 
item in the RECORD declaration. Consequently, the END that termi- 
nates the variant definition section also concludes the RECORD 
declarationl 

Winning at Tag. It is probably best to think of the variant REC- 
ORD tag field as a kind of label that characterizes but does not dictate the 
contents of the variant data region. In a Station variable, for example, an 
XMode value of AM suggests that access to the AM Frequency field is 
"safe"; in other words, that the pattern of bits in the first two bytes of the 
variant data region corresponds to a valid Integer number. A tag field 
value of FM indicates that the program should interpret the entire four 
bytes of the variant data region as a Real number, by accessing it as the 
field FM Frequency. 

It is possible, however, for your program to access FMFrequency 
when the tag field contains AM, and AMFrequency when XMode is 
FM. Indeed, Apple Pascal will allow your program to access any variant 
field at any time, irrespective of the contents of the tag field. 

The program that uses a variant RECORD is responsible for setting 
the tag field appropriately when storing information into the variant da- 
ta region, and for checking the tag field value before accessing any vari- 
ant field. Unlike some Pascal systems, Apple Pascal does not insist that 
these rules be followed. But it is usually pointless to access a Real vari- 



able as if it were an Integer, and vice versa. For one thing, the first two 
bytes of the four-byte bit pattern for the Real number 2.0 do not contain 
the same pattern of bits as the two-byte Integer number 2. 

Except for what the tag field implies about the variant data region, 
the two entities are separate and independent of each other. In particu- 
lar, assignment to the tag field does not in any way alter the bit pattern 
within the variant data region. When first learning about variant rec- 
ords, many people assume that changing the tag field value im.plies auto- 
matic data conversion. In the case of Station, for instance, one might get 
the impression that changing XMode from AM to FM would cause Pas- 
cal to convert the Integer value of an AMFrequency to the Real value of 
an FMFrequency. (For sake of argument, let's ignore the fact that such a 
conversion would always produce Real numbers which lie outside the 
range of valid FM frequencies.) In reality, no conversion occurs. The 
contents of the variant data region remains unchanged. By changing the 
value of the tag field without also assigning a new value to the appropri- 
ate variant data field, we merely arrange to look at the same old data 
from a new perspecfive. Beware, though. While you are certainly free to 
call a fish a "dog," you should not be surprised or disappointed when it 
fails to bark! 

Field Names: A Compromise. Recall that all field names in a "regu- 
lar" RECORD must be unique. This applies to variant fields, too. You 
may wonder why this is so; if only one variant Aay be active at any giv- 
en time, why can't they all share the same name? Certainly it would be 
more convenient for us to refer to the transmission frequency with a sin- 
gle field name. Frequency, rather than having to distinguish between 
AMFrequency and FMFrequency. After all, the XMode tag field is sup- 
posed to make that distinction for us, isn't it? 

The problem lies in the limitations of Pascal's type-checking facil- 
ities, and in the fact that the compiler is unable to predict the execution 
behavior of a program. Suppose each of Station's variants could be 
named Frequency. Suppose also that we wanted to display the fre- 
quency assignment of a given stafion, as recorded in a Station variable 
named StatVar. The easiest way to do this would be to use the proce- 
dure call WriteLn(StatVar.Frequency). But how can WriteLn — or even

the compiler, for that matter— deal correctly with StatVar.Frequency 
without knowing whether it is an Integer or a Real number? Because the 
tag field is a variable, its contents — and so the expected character of the 
variant data region — can only be determined at execution time. In order 
to provide for this variability, the Pascal compiler would have to treat the 
WriteLn of a variant field as if it were actually a CASE statement that in- 
cluded several calls: 

CASE StatVar.XMode OF 
AM: 

Writelnt(Output, StatVar.Frequency); 
FM: 

WriteReal(Output, StatVar.Frequency); 
END (* CASE StatVar.XMode *); 
WriteLn(Output); 

Anticipating that many Pascal system implementors would find it in- 
feasible to make their compilers clever enough to handle ambiguous var- 
iant field names, Pascal's designer, Niklaus Wirth, decided that it would 
be better for the language to require that all fields of a RECORD, in- 
cluding the variants, have unique names. While this policy increases the 
amount of work involved in defining a RECORD, it promotes a simple, 
straightforward compiler, and also renders Pascal programs more read- 
able to humans, as well. 

Free Unions. A variant RECORD that includes a tag field is prop- 
erly called a discriminated union in the jargon of computer science. All 
this means is that two or more data types overlay each other in the vari- 
ant region of the RECORD, and a tag field is used by a program in de- 
ciding how to view the ambiguous area. 

A free union, on the other hand, has no tag field at all — no basis for 
resolving variant ambiguity. If you look closely at the figure on page 194, 
you will see that the variant CASE clause must always include a type 
designation in the space for the tag field, but it need not include a var- 
iable identifier! Thus, you may define RECORDS such as the following: 



CONST 
WordSize = 
MaxBit = 



16; 
15; 



(* Number of bits in an Integer *) 
(* ALWAYS WordSize - 1 *)

TYPE 

Visiblelnteger= 
RECORD 

CASE Boolean OF 
False; 

(I: Integer); 
True: 

(Bits: SET OF 0 
END {* Visiblelnteger*); 



MaxBit) 



Except that the tag field is "anonymous" (indeed, nonexistent), the 
specification of a free union employs the same CASE-oriented syntax as 
the definition of a conventional variant RECORD. Of course, it is some- 
what silly for Pascal to require the programmer to declare a tag field da- 
ta type, then tie each variant field to a list of constant values drawn from 
that type, when the RECORD itself contains no tag field! On the other 
hand, free unions are of such questionable utility (and are, in fact, so 
rarely used) that it would have been just as silly for Niklaus Wirth to in- 
vent a special, "cleaner" syntax for these structures when only a slight 
modification of the existing variant RECORD mechanism would do 
the job. 

When defining free unions, you must be careful to choose (or invent) 
tag field data types that contain at least as many scalar values as there are 
variants in the RECORD structure. Remember, no constant value may 
be associated with more than one variant field. For a union with two var- 
iants, Boolean is a proper (and popular) tag field type. For more com- 
plicated unions, you may wish to associate the absent tag field with Char 
or even Integer. 

The following program, ShowBits, demonstrates the use of the free 
union Visiblelnteger, by permitting convenient, interactive examination 
and modification of the individual bits in an Integer variable.

As an aside, we should recognize that ShowBits is an effective dem- 
onstration of the internal structure of an Integer, partly because it uses 
the Apple Pascal built-in procedure GotoXY to position the video cur- 
sor at arbitrarily selected points on the screen, in order to create and 
maintain special "display fields" there. GotoXY is explained quite thor- 
oughly in Chapter 3 of your Apple Pascal Language Reference Manual, 
in the section entitled "Miscellaneous Built-Ins." In times to come, we 
will also be making extensive use of GotoXY, so you should make a 
point of studying and experimenting with this facility at your earliest 
opportunity. 

Returning to the subject of Show Bits and its use of the free union, we 
should note that one may, of course, access single bits through normal, 
arithmetic means that do not involve variant RECORD trickery of any 
kind. The conventional method of doing this, however, is generally much 
slower and more cryptic than the "direct access" that is engendered by a 
free union. 

In Visiblelnteger, we take advantage of the fact that a SET of sixteen 
elements (here, the Integers 0 through 15) occupies sixteen bits, or a sin- 
gle p-machine word (two bytes). Thus, such a SET uses the same amount 
of RAM memory space as an Integer value. Each member of the SET 
occupies a single, unique bit position in the word. As it happens, the SET 
element that corresponds to 0 is stored in the word's least significant 
(rightmost) bit, while that corresponding to 15 is stored in the most sig- 
nificant (leftmost) bit. The bits in between correspond to the potential 
SET members from 14 down to 1, scanning from left to right. In an 
empty SET, all bits are turned off. By adding a particular member to the 
SET, we turn the corresponding bit on\ removing that member turns the 
corresponding bit off. To see how changes in the individual bits affect an 
Integer's value, we simply change our point of view, exploiting the struc- 
ture of the free union to treat the SET as if it were an Integer. (And who's 
to say it isn't?) 

Free Unions: Pro and Con. By eliminating the tag field in a variant 
RECORD to form a free union, you achieve a couple of desirable objec- 
tives. For one thing, you conserve a slight amount of memory space with 
each RECORD. As we've mentioned, savings of even one or two bytes 
per RECORD can be important when the corresponding RECORD 
type is used to define the elements for a large array. Furthermore, soft- 
ware that doesn't bother to set, reset, or verify the contents of a tag field 
can run much more quickly than software that does. 

On the other hand, a programmer must acquire and depend upon de- 
tailed knowledge of the internal format of Pascal data objects, in order to 
make intelligent use of free unions. You stand on very shaky ground 
when you put yourself in such a situation. What if Apple decides to 
change the internal representations of objects that certain of your pro- 
grams manipulate through free unions? Probably, those programs will 
become obsolete, suddenly failing to execute properly. Moreover, the tag 
field — when set and observed conscienfiously — can certainly contribute 
to the ongoing reliability of any program that uses variant RECORDS. It 
is' not a tool to be dismissed lightly. 

In the opinion of Your Pathfinder, there is no application worth 
mentioning that absolutely requires a free union structure. Programmers 
will be programmers, however, as enamored of toys and clever tricks as 
any child. (Indeed, it is probably the childlike suppleness of a program- 
mer's mind that suits her to the vocation!) Thus, you will certainly en- 
counter the free union again, perhaps in this very space! In any event, 
you deprive Apple Pascal of its ability to help you avert catastrophe 
whenever you exploit the chinks in its type-checking armor. Always bear 
this in mind whenever you are tempted to veer too far from the well- 
marked Pascal Path.

One of the benefits the Apple II realizes from being the longest-run- 
ning, most expandable personal computer is the incredible array of pe- 
ripherals that have been designed for it. Each month, it seems, manufac- 
turers bring forth new and better products. Whether it's a disk drive, 
modem, or special interface card they're looking for, Apple owners have 
by far the widest selection of items from which to choose. This month 
let's look at some of these top-of-the-line peripherals. 

Vista V1200 Floppy Disk System. Despite a growing selection of 
hard disk drives, RAM disks, and bubble memory cards, the minifloppy 
disk remains the most popular means of mass storage. And towering 
over the new double-sided, quad-density (ninety-six-track-per-inch), and 
half-height drives is the king of floppy disk storage — the VI 200 from 
Vista Computer Company. This disk drive provides six megabytes of for- 
matted storage capacity, along with an extremely fast access time and 
data storage rate. These features, plus easy backup, make the V1200 an 
ideal choice for applications that require the storage of large amounts 
of data. 

The VI 200 improves upon the standard floppy disk drive in three 
ways — storage capacity, speed of operation, and data transfer rate. Let's 
consider each of these for a moment. 

The V1200 drive uses a cartridge assembly, or VistaPak, containing 
five separate disks. Thus the full six megabytes are divided amongst the 
five disks (called platters), requiring that each disk store 1.2 megabytes. 
The drive has only one read/write head, so only one disk can be loaded 
into it at a time. 

Selecting and loading a disk is the function of the picker mechanism. 
Much like the jukebox of yesteryear, the cartridge assembly can be piv- 
oted to present any given disk to the picker arm. This arm can then reach 
out and grab the disk by a special hole punched near the disk's leading 
edge. The picker arm can then pull the disk into the drive, where it will be 
clamped by a spindle arrangement similar to that found on ordinary 
drives. 

Storing 1 .2 megabytes on a single floppy disk (single-sided, no less) is 
no trivial feat. The VI 200 has a track density of 170 tpi (tracks per inch) 
and a recording density of 9,500 bpi (bits per inch), as compared to the 
48 tpi and 5,000 bpi of a standard Apple disk drive; obviously, this is no 
ordinary drive mechanism. Of course, the disks used in the VistaPak are 
not your run-of-the-mill, "plain-Jane" variety either. 

As for the speed issue, several factors account for the dramatic im- 
provement in access time and transfer rate. The higher bit density auto- 
matically adds a factor of two to the transfer rate. Spinning the disk 
slightly faster (360 rpm versus the normal 300 rpm) results in a speed- 
up of data transfer from less than 200K to 500K bits per second. 

A special band position that can achieve a three-millisecond track-to- 
track stepping time is used to reduce access time. Special head position- 
ing logic (more on this later) achieves a further reduction of the average 
access time (from any given track to another) to about eighty-five milli- 
seconds. These figures also compare favorably to the forty-millisecond 
track-to-track and 460-millisecond average access time of the Disk II. 

All of these improvements require careful design of the drive mech- 
anism and associated electronics. For example, the high track density 




E Y n M \\ ^ 



calls for a special head capable of reading and writing along a very nar- 
row path (3.5 mils, or 0.0035-inch). The track-to-track spacing of 5.9 mil- 
liseconds approaches the magnitude of misalignment errors caused by 
off-center clamping of the disk or even by thermal expansion of the 
Mylar disk. If these errors were not corrected somehow, the chances of 
accurately and repeatedly reading data from such a dense format would 
be quite low. 

To compensate for the expansion and contraction of the disk media, 
a small piece of Mylar is attached to the head carriage assembly. This 
"reference strip" contains a series of bands, some opaque and some 
transparent, which pass through an optical sensor. This "scale" is used to 
control the amount of travel the head makes between each track. Since 
the reference strip is made of the same material as a disk and is at the 
same temperature, it can accurately predict the proper space between 
tracks. Thus if the room temperature were suddenly to increase, the disk 
would expand slightly, pushing the tracks away from each other. This 
could cause the read/ write head to follow along the edge of a track or, 
worse yet, to go between two tracks, instead of directly over the center of 
the track. But since the reference strip within the drive will also expand, it 
can correctly adapt the drive to the appropriate absolute track spacing. 
Further supporting this function is a microstepping technique that allows 
the drive to position the head to within 1/100 of a track, or 0.000059- 
inch! 

What we've just been talking about also applies to another mecha- 
nism — the mechanism that corrects for any eccentricity in the track. Such 
eccentricity is usually caused by the normal tolerances of the clamping 
mechanism, which has some degree of "slop." 

When a disk is first loaded into the drive, the head is moved out be- 
yond the track 0 position to a special reference track. This track contains 
a special signal, which is placed on the disk at the time the VistaPak is 
manufactured. As the disk spins, the drive determines the absolute posi- 
tion of this track and remembers its position at eight points around the 
disk. If too much eccentricity becomes apparent, the drive immediately 
rejects, reloads, and reclamps the disk. 

As you may have guessed by now, the VI 200 performs these tasks 
with the help of its own internal microprocessor. This microprocessor 
also gives the V 1200 the intelligence to perform a number of other house- 
keeping duties. For example, if the disk hasn't been accessed for about 
thirty seconds, the drive automatically goes out to the reference track to 
see if anything has changed. After a couple of minutes without use, the 
drive motor shuts off to reduce disk wear and ambient noise. 

The microprocessor is also used to improve performance in certain 
areas, such as head positioning. As mentioned, the track-to-track step 
rate is three milliseconds per step; this is the standard rate used by most 
floppy disk (not minifloppy) and hard disk drives, and it represents the 
minimum time needed to move the head backward or forward one track 
reliably. The limiting factor here is the time needed to overcome the iner- 
tia of the head-positioning assembly and get it moving from a dead stop. 
Once the head is moving, however, it can be stepped at a much faster rate 
to cross multiple tracks. Therefore, if some sort of logic can be incorpo- 
rated into the positioning mechanism, the time required to go from track 



If you guessed that a Practical Peripherals Micro- 
buffer™ printer buffer saves time, you're right. For 
the way it works, this inexpensive product is the 
most practical addition to your microcomputer sys- 
tem ever. 

With Microbuffer, you don't have to wait for 
your printer to finish before you resume using your 
computer. Data is received and stored at fast speeds, 
then released from Microbuffer's memory to your 
printer. This is called buffering. The more you 
print, the more productive it makes your workflow. 

Depending on the version of Microbuffer, 
these buffering capacities range from a useful 8K of 
random access memory — big enough for 8,000 
characters of storage — up to a very large 256K — 
enough for 256,000 characters of storage. 

Practical Peripherals makes stand-alone 
Microbuffers for any computer and printer combi- 



nation, including add-on units especially for Apple 
II computer and/or Epson printers. Each has differ- 
ent features like graphics dumps and text format- 
ting besides its buffering capabilities. You can 
choose one that's just right for your system. 

Best of all, they're built to last and work 
exactly like they're supposed to. 

If you're still guessing whether you can afford 
to have one, talk with any computer dealer. That's 
the best way to find out how practical a Practical 
Peripherals Microbuffer is.

0 to track 85 (halfway across the disk) can be dramatically reduced. 

Apple disk drives have always used such a scheme to reduce access 
time. Apple Computer achieved this by directly controlling the head-po- 
sitioning stepper motor from software. Thus the stepping algorithm and 
"seek rate" are stored in and controlled from DOS. And when higher- 
quality drives are used, such as those available now for the Apple, the 
DOS can easily be modified to seek the optimum rate for these drives. 

Most other disk systems lack this capability and must step at a con- 
stant rate. By contrast, the V 1 200 uses its microprocessor to produce the 
most efficient head motion. If the drive receives step signals at a rate 
faster than three milliseconds, these pulses are stored in RAM and then 
dynamically examined by the microprocessor. A velocity profile is then 
derived to accelerate and then decelerate the head smoothly for the 
lowest possible access time. 

Since the disk has 170 tracks, an "average" access would have to 
cross half, or 85, of the tracks. Without the dynamic positioning logic, 
this would take 85 times 3, or 255 milliseconds. The VI 200 can perform 
this operation in only 85 milliseconds — or three times faster. Of course, 
this concern over milliseconds may seem foolish to some people. The de- 
gree of improvement certainly depends upon how much disk access is 
performed and how spread out the data is on the disk. Most files, in fact, 
are stored in contiguous blocks on adjoining tracks. Still, it's nice to 
know that the equipment is performing to its utmost, saving time 
whenever possible. 

The final element of the V 1200 hardware is the special controller card 
that interfaces the drive to the Apple. Actually, this card is the A-801 
double-density, eight-inch disk controller card, which has been available 
from Vista for years. This card offers fast data transfer using DMA (di- 
rect memory access) and works with most full-size floppy disk drives. 
Thus, the V1200 drive simply appears to the controller card as five dou- 
ble-density disk drives (one for each platter). 

Using DMA, the controller board can transfer data very rapidly 
from the disk into the Apple's RAM. It does this directly, without going 



through the Apple's 6502 cpu; that's one of the ways the V 1200 manages 
to achieve a transfer rate of up to 50K bytes per second. 

On the software side, the VI 200 offers support for the Apple's three 
major operadng systems. DOS 3.3 is supported, of course, and several 
DOS utility programs are included. One modifies Apple's FID program 
to work with the added storage of the V1200; another, called Quick- 
charge, speeds up DOS by a factor of about five. This utility is quite sim- 
ilar to other DOS speedups for the Apple and is necessary to realize fully 
the speed capability of the VI 200. 

After formatting the disks within the VistaPak using a special 
"VDOS," the V1200 acts like a regular drive. The familiar PR# com- 
mand will boot the disk and it can be accessed by most software using 
the standard slot and drive parameters. The VI 200 slot, however, ap- 
pears to have five drives — Dl through D5. Since many protected pro- 
grams, such as VisiCalc, cannot tolerate strange drives in slot 6, the rec- 
ommended place for the V1200 is slot 5. The system can be cold-booted 
from the V 1200 by simply pressing reset after turning on the computer 
and then typing PR#5. 

Support for Apple Pascal is considerable and currently being up- 
dated. At present, only four of the V1200's disks are accessible and the 
system can't be booted from the V1200. Nevertheless, Pascal's intensive 
disk usage and memory swapping make the size and speed of the V 1200 
quite welcome. 

As for CP/M, the VI 200 installs it without a hitch but requires a 64K 
Apple. The drive assignments change depending upon whether the sys- 
tem is booted from a floppy disk or the V 1200. The boot drive is always 
assigned to be drive A:, which is assumed by some programs to contain 
certain operating files. Thus it's wise to boot from whichever drive proves 
more convenient, but it's important to be consistent. 

Most programs, except for nonstandard software as mentioned ear- 
lier, will work perfectly with the V1200. Even many of the special-pur- 
pose DOS patches can be successfully applied to VDOS. For example, 
the install program, which modifies DOS to date- and time-stamp files

using a Superclock II, works equally well on the V1200's VDOS. 

Since the individual disks within the VistaPak, as well as the entire 
cartridge itself, are removable, data backup is extraordinarily easy. 
Using the supplied utilities, an entire platter can be duplicated without 
user intervention. Having a large RAM card makes this task relatively 
quick also. 

Despite the added mechanics of the disk picker and the high-density 
storage, the VI 200 has proven very reliable. Unless — or should we say 
until — hard disks with removable cartridges go down in price, the V 1200 
will remain an excellent choice for low-to-medium-cost, high-density 
storage with simple backup. 

Novation Apple-Cat II. The Apple-Cat II from Novation is proba- 
bly the most sophisticated modem available for the Apple II. The stan- 
dard unit consists of a single peripheral board and a modular phone 
cable that plugs directly into the board at one end and into your phone 
jack at the other. Thus it is a direct-connect-type modem with a built-in 
phone line coupler. 

The Apple-Cat is advertised as a 300/1200-baud modem; this is a bit 
misleading. The 1200-baud operation is only half duplex (Bell 202) and 
thus not compatible with the increasingly popular 212 standard of 1200- 
baud, full-duplex communication. Actually, the Apple-Cat can be ex- 
panded to operate on the 212 standard by the purchase of an additional 
board. For communicating with another Apple-Cat-equipped comput- 
er, the 202 mode can be used! As for the lower speeds, the modem uses 
the Bell 103 standard at 110, 150, or 300 baud. 

The basic Apple-Cat contains no firmware, so a comprehensive com- 
munications program to operate the modem is included. Novation calls 
this communications program Corn-Ware. 

The functions offered by the current version of Corn-Ware are nu- 
merous and useful. Among the standard features it provides are a buffer 
memory, auto-dialing, and memory/disk transfers. The auto-dial sup- 
ports a disk-based phone directory list (with optional configuration 
setup for each number) and last number redial. A "keyboard to memo-

ry" function allows the creation of simple messages off-line without using 
a separate word processor. This message can then be sent at full speed 
after connection to the remote computer. 

When transmitting files between two Apple-Cats, a high-speed 
(1200-baud) protocol that includes error-checking and automatic re- 
transmission can be used. Other controls, such as memory on /off, 
local/remote echo, and so on, are also provided. The top two lines of the 
screen are always reserved for a status display. Even in the terminal 
mode, you get a constant indication of the line status, memory status, 
and other operating parameters. 

Several utility programs are included with the Corn-Ware package. 
These utilities can be used to convert Integer and Applesoft programs 
into binary or text files for transmission over the Apple-Cat; these files 
can then be converted back into their original Basic forms at the 
receiving end. 

A wealth of options and accessories is available for the Apple-Cat. 
For starters, there's a handy expansion module that attaches to the back 
of the computer. This module provides a quick and neat connection for 
the phone line, handset, BSR controOer, serial port, and tape recorder. 
There's also an "off-hook" indicator LED. The optional handset is just a 
standard telephone piece (tan-colored to match the Apple) that comes 
with two plastic supports. These supports slide into the Apple's ventila- 
tion slots, providing a convenient holder for the handset. Both the 
mouthpiece and earpiece are activated under software control. For 
example, the earpiece might be turned on when calling a remote com- 
puter, allowing you to tell if the line is busy or if there is some other prob- 
lem. Once communication has been established, the receiver is turned off 
so you won't have to listen to all of the modem racket. 

The Apple-Cat II has provisions for driving a printer or other serial 
device when the modem is not in use. An expansion module or an op- 
tional cable is required to connect the Apple-Cat to an RS-232 (DB-25) 
cable. The BSR option consists of a special wall transformer that plugs 
into an ac oudet and connects to the expansion module. This option, to- 
gether with the appropriate software, enables the Apple-Cat to control 
lights, appliances, and other devices that are connected to BSR X-10 sys- 
tem control modules. 

The cassette jacks on the expansion module open up the possibility of 
creating a very sophisticated telephone answering machine. The micro- 
phone and remote start/stop output should work with any tape record- 
er, making it possible to record the incoming audio off the telephone line. 
And for sending messages, the Apple-Cat contains an eight-bit DAC 
(digital-to-analog converter). Thus it's possible to transmit synthesized 
voice messages over the phone line by means of the Apple-Cat and user- 
supplied software. 

Two more options that plug directly onto the Apple-Cat circuit 
board are available. The first is a Touch-Tone receiver chip, which can be 
added at any time. This IC allows the modem to decode the tones gener- 
ated by pressing the buttons on a Touch-Tone phone. Thus, instead of 
having to use a terminal to call up your Apple, you could use any ordi- 
nary Touch-Tone phone (or even one of the pocket tone dialers) to control 
or enter data into the computer. 

The other option is a software PROM that allows the Apple-Cat to 
be used directly, without the Com- W^are program. This firmware follows 
the same standard as the D.C. Hayes Micromodem II; thus, many Basic 
programs written for that modem can be used with the Apple-Cat. Since 
the hardware is completely different, however, most programs written in 
machine language will require modification to work with the Apple-Cat. 

' All in all, the Apple-Cat II is an exceptional product. It certainly has 
the potential for use in the creation of a sophisticated communications 
system. Its only drawback lies in its incompatibility with much of the 
existing software. 

The Mirror. The Mirror is an EPROM from Rak-Ware that inserts 
into the firmware socket on the Apple-Cat II. It performs much the same 
function as the Novation firmware option, but with some improve- 
ments. 

When dialing is taking place, the -I- symbol is recognized as a com- 
mand to wait for another dial tone. Upper and lower case, including the 
popular one-wire shift key mod, is supported, and full compatibility with

Your best buy in modem history. The 
Networker™ a plug-in single-slot di- 
rect connect modem for your Apple II, 
II -I- , and He (or Franklin, Albert, or 
other Apple compatible computer). 
You are immediately linked to the 
vast network of computers — data 
bases like the Source® Compu- 
serve® or Dow Jones® friends, banks, 
businesses, and hundreds of local ' 'bulletin 
boards." For only $129. There's absolutely 
nothing else to buy. And it even comes with 
software. 

This is the modem that does it all, and does 
it for less. The Apple Communications Card is on 
board, so you won't need to buy one. That will 
save a bunch. It's 300 baud, the most commonly 
used type of modem. It comes complete with its 
own communications software on Apple compati- 
ble disk, giving you features no modem offers. 

Like "data capture" to lock the messages 
into your Apples' RAM, and then move the infor- 
mation onto a disk for easy reference and review. 
A terminal program that turns your computer into 
a communications command center, displaying 
on-screen "help" menus, continuous updates of 
memory usage, carrier presence, baud rate, 
communications status, all while taking in and 
displaying information from any computer. 

The Networker supports both originate and 
answer modes, so you can send and receive in- 
formation, in full or half duplex modes. And its 
all easily programmable right from the keyboard 
of your Apple computer. All you do is plug Net- 
worker into any slot (except 0) in your Apple 
computer. It'll even ask you what slot it's in. 
It's that easy to use. 




NETMASTER™ COMMUNICATIONS 
SOFTWARE 

For $179 we include the even more incredible 
Netmaster software for advanced users. Net- 
master is a "communications freeway" that 
lets you speed any Apple file to another Apple 
through noisy phone lines, without errors. Net- 
master even includes its own Disk Operating 
System to control the flow of information and 
leave you over 40K of "buffer" memory from 
your 64K RAM. And there's always help when 
you want it. On screen. Status indicators keep 
you fully updated. 

Netmaster will let you transfer games, 
computer graphics, programs, sales reports, 
documents, any DOS 3.3 file, all directly from 
disk to disk, all with computer (not telephone) 
accuracy. Netmaster is completely configurable 
to understand any computer, even mainframes. 
File size is unlimited. 

But Netmaster is not stuffy. It will talk to 
the other communications packages like Visi- 
term® or ASCII Express® Of course they don't 
support Netmaster's superb error checking, 
that guarantees you won't miss even a comma. 
It doesn't only talk to the Networker either. It 
will also talk to those more expensive modems 
from Hayes and Novation. 



And Netmaster is fast. It trans- 
fers information disk to disk three to 
five times faster than the others. Of 
course Netmaster is fully compatible 
with them. But if you want things to 
happen really fast, talk to another 
Netmaster. 
We sell Netmaster by itself for $79, 
and even if you have another modem for your 
Apple, Netmaster is an outstanding value. It will 
even support auto dial and auto answer. Net- 
master requires 48K of Apple memory, disk 
drive and DOS 3.3, and ZOOM'S Networker 
modem or another modem. It can also be used 
without a modem when two Apples are hard- 
wired together, using a 6850 or 6551 -based in- 
terface card. 

Networker, Netmaster, and Networker/ 
Netmaster combo are all produced in the USA 
by ZOOM Telephonies, producers of the popular 
DEMON DIALER. The Networker is FCC regis- 
tered, and all products come with a one-year 
warranty.

most eighty-column boards is provided. 

The Mirror can control a standard printer connected to slot 1. To 
avoid the loss of characters that can take place with some printers, a 
small buffer is used; in order to take advantage of this aspect of the 
Mirror, however, the printer you use should be able to operate at least as 
fast as the modem. The printer can be toggled on or off by means of 
simple commands. 

SSM ModemCard. Another exciting modem designed expressly for 
the Apple II computer is the ModemCard from SSM Microcomputer 
Products. This direct-connect, 110/300-baud modem takes only seconds 
to install in the Apple. The board can be placed in any unused slot. Next, 
a standard, modular phone cable must be used to hook up the jack on 
the ModemCard to any convenient telephone outlet. Of course, a duplex 
adapter can be used if the modem is sharing the outlet with a normal 
technique. 

Among the ModemCard's features are auto-answer/auto-dial, 
Touch-Tone or pulse dialing, audio monitoring through the computer's 
speaker, and on-board communications firmware. The firmware sup- 
ports both a terminal mode and a remote mode. The command structure is 
totally compatible with that used by the Apple Communications Card 
and the D.C. Hayes Micromodem. 

In the terminal mode, the ModemCard lets you dial a remote com- 
puter, establish a connection, and then use the Apple as a "mostly dumb 
terminal." When the number to be dialed is being specified, the Modem- 
Card recognizes five special characters in addition to the numerical 
digits. An asterisk included in a number causes the modem to pause for 
two seconds at that point. This can be used to ensure sufficient time for 
acquiring an outside line from a PBX system or the local access tone 
from a long-distance carrier such as Sprint or MCI. The other four char- 
acters let you select tone dialing or pulse dialing, and activate or silence 
the audio monitoring feature. 

When the monitor has been activated, the Apple's built-in speaker is 
used as a crude but functional monitor of what's happening on the line. 
It's not hard to distinguish between a dead line, one that is ringing, and 



one that is busy. (In fact, although the speaker is not intended for voice 
quality, it is often quite possible to recognize the familiar sound of a 
"wrong number" or "not in service" recording. Worse yet, you might 
sometimes hear the crackle of some human answering, "Hello . . . hello 
. . . HELLO! . . .") Most people will find this audio monitoring ex- 
tremely valuable — especially when they're trying to reach a popular com- 
puter system that's often busy. 

All of the terminal mode commands follow the standard set by the 
Apple Communications Card and the Hayes Micromodem. Thus, eadi 
command begins with a control-A, for attention, followed by a com- 
mand code. For example, control-A, control-F selects the full duplex 
mode, control-A 1 selects 110 baud, and so on. 

In the remote mode, the Apple is left on with the modem active. 
When the ModemCard receives a call from a remote terminal or com- 
puter, it answers the line and then places the Apple under control of the 
remote terminal. Thus you can load programs from the disk, list and/or 
modify them, and then run them from the remote location. Of course, 
any programs using graphics or direct access to Apple hardware, such as 
the keyboard, screen, and speaker, won't lend themselves to remote 
operation. 

As mentioned earlier, most of the commands are similar to those 
used by the Hayes Micromodem II. A concerted effort was made to keep 
the ModemCard compatible with the Micromodem II. This compatibil- 
ity goes beyond the firmware interface, however. At the hardware level, 
even the data and status ports have been mapped to the identical loca- 
tions as those of the Micromodem II. This should ensure that almost all 
software written for the Hayes modem will work with the ModemCard. 
With all of its added features, and its low price, the SSM ModemCard 
has to be considered an exceptional value.

CITY TREES - 

Apples Make a Case for Urban Forestry 



DV -hCHNK DDM/m 






If knowledge is power, then knowledge of numbers may well sit atop 
the pyramid of power. The story of Magic, Inc., a small California citi- 
zens' group, suggests that low-cost microcomputing is bringing to public 
activists the "power of the number" the way the printing press brought 
to our ancestors the power of the word. 

Magic is a group of concerned citizens in Palo Alto, California, who 
have combined intelligence, a passionate commitment to an ideal, the 
power of an Apple II, and a home-brewed forest-management program 
to persuade their city's government to increase the rate at which it plants 
trees along the streets. Magic's forest-modeling program enables an ur- 
ban forester to choose the correct mix of tree species and yearly planting 
rates to achieve a predetermined shade standard and a stable tree 
population. 

Sitting at the northern edge of Santa Clara County, thirty-five miles 
south of San Francisco, Palo Alto is named for a tall old redwood tree, 
whose triangular shape appears on the city seal. Palo Alto is home to a 
strongly vocal, environmentally conscious population of sixty thousand. 

Team Effort. Magic is a collection of self-described human ecolo- 
gists. David Schrom has been the conceptual force and political strate- 
gist as the four-year-old group has moved through the process of attend- 
ing public meetings and seeking support and approval for various 
projects. A Yale Law School graduate who wrote on his entrance 
application that he intended never to practice law (which he has not), 
Schrom is quick-thinking and articulate. 

Erica Prince, president of Magic, is an undergraduate student in bi- 
ology at Stanford University who prefers to be thought of as a neighbor- 



hood organizer. Jeffrey Hook serves as Magic's computer programmer. 
Like the others, he has no special training in forestry but learned what he 
knows about trees through independent research. In addition to earning 
a degree in German literature from Stanford, Hook spent nine months 
studying electronics at Bay Valley Technical College in nearby Santa 
Clara. 

Hook, Prince, Schrom, Magic member Daniel Bartsch, and Magic 
cofounder Corinne Powell live together in a plain white stucco house 
owned by Powell. Located on a corner lot in the Evergreen Park section 
of Palo Alto, the house is surrounded by fruit trees and vegetable 
gardens. 

Strip Trees. Magic's involvement with the city and the tree program 
began in 1979 when Schrom and roommates planted some fruit trees in 
the narrow strip of land between the sidewalk and the street outside their 
house. 

, "We looked up and down and saw a fairly barren street with virtual- 
ly no healthy young trees on it," Schrom says. "We thought that was 
crazy. The reason I care about the trees is that I came back here after a 
vacation once feeling as though I had been living as a transient in Palo 
Alto for ten years, always threatening to move to some idyllic place in the 
country. I decided to start living here, instead of taking from this com- 
munity in anticipation of going to another place." 

The City of Palo Alto put local ordinances ahead of individual ideal- 
ism. Schrom got a letter signed by an assistant district attorney saying, 
"If you don't take out the trees we're going to remove them at your ex- 
pense and put a lien on the property." The letter said it was illegal for 



citizens to plant trees in the narrow strips. 

Schrom knew more than enough law to know they were over- 
matched in a legal struggle with the city. The trees came out. But so did 
Schrom. 

Schrom and his roommates called the city attorney, who referred 
them to the tree maintenance division, who referred them to something 
called the Palo Alto Tree Committee, which hadn't met in six months. 
But a meeting was scheduled in the near future. While waiting for that 
meeting, Schrom did what you would expect of someone with his back- 
ground; with the help of a friendly research librarian, he read everything 
he could find on urban forestry. 

He wound up with "a stack of two hundred articles and fifty books" 
and sat down with it for two weeks. By the time Schrom was finished he 
had found two local foresters he wanted to talk with: Greg D'Ambrosio 
in Carmel and Tony Acosta in Oakland. Schrom also found a group in 
Oakland doing a neighborhood tree-organizing project, as well as some 
folks in Los Angeles who called themselves the Tree People. 

Tree Questions. Schrom, newly armed with knowledge, went to the 
fall Palo Alto Tree Committee meeting and started asking questions. He 
asked the committee members if they had any idea how many trees were 
being planted in the city; their answer was no. 

"I asked them if they cared and they said, 'Why?' I said, 'Because all 
these big old trees are going to die someday.' They said, 'That won't 
happen for a long time.' " 

Through a friend of theirs at the California Department of Forestry, 
Schrom and Magic also discovered a state grant program for citizens' 



groups who wanted to plant trees in public places. In the first half of 1981 
Magic received $12,000 to plant one hundred street trees and prepare a 
public educational slide show on trees in the city. 

Schrom continued going to the tree committee meetings and asking 
questions, and he soon got himself elected chairman of the group. He 
had found a city that couldn't see the forest for the trees. 

Magic was alarmed that the planting rates were so low. "The best es- 
timate we got from the city staff was that they were planting one hun- 
dred fifty trees per year," Erica Prince says. Later the city staff proposed 
to raise that to a rate of seven hundred fifty trees per year, which Magic 
thought was still too low. 

Prince explains their concern by pointing out that a stable forest re- 
quires that maintenance remain constant from year to year and that the 
forest does not cycle in growth from lush to sparse to lush. 

"What we have now is a forest that works in terms of the number of 
trees and their size and age. But these trees are going to die out and we 
are not planting enough to replace them. Also, there may come a point 
when they are all replaced, but with small trees. It's not fair to future gen- 
erations to present them with a forest without stabilizing it by evening 
out the age distribution," she says. 

Magic is also alarmed that the wrong trees are being planted in the 
wrong places. "There is an overreliance on a handful of species," Schrom 
says. In the thirties and forties, magnolias and sycamores were planted. 
In the fifties and sixties, the city planted modesto ashe and liquid- 
ambars. In the seventies, hardly a tree was planted. Now, in the eighties, 
everyone wants to plant Chinese pistaches, holly oaks, and liquidam-

bars, says Schrom. "Failure to construct the forest according to a set of 
ecological principles is going to lead to the same disappointment in the 
future that we feel today over actions taken in the past," he continues. 

He believes that any monoculture is vulnerable. If some pathogen 
comes along, it just moves from tree to tree straight through the neigh- 
borhood. Not only has the city planted the same species, but it has 
planted those trees' clones, says Schrom. 

"You have exactly the same genetic material on every single tree up 
and down the block. To a landscape architect it looks beautiful. But to 
the ecologist it looks like a disaster waiting to happen." 

Schrom cites the experience of some eastern and midwestem cities 
whose tree populations suffered from Dutch elm disease. "There were 
plenty of hundred-year-old elm trees twenty to thirty years ago. When 
Dutch elm disease arrived it was good-bye elms and hello treeless cities." 

Planning an Apple Orchard. Not given to labeling a problem and 
walking away from the task of finding a solution. Magic began pushing 
for increasing planting rates and species variety. While the group was 
playing with the numbers by hand, technology and the company's Sili- 
con Valley location caught up with them. In late 1981 Ellen Nadler, a 
former law school classmate of Schrom's, read some of his writing and 
said, "You need a word processor." Another friend, Jerry Kaplan, said, 
"What you need is a computer." 

With financial help from Nadler, Magic bought an Apple II Plus 
with 64K of memory, a Pascal card, and an eighty-column card "We've 
been happy with it," Schrom says, adding that they have nothing to com- 
pare it with. After an early taste of computing, they are hungry for more. 
"Some hotshot word processing program would be an enormous help. 
That's for me personally. Also graphics. We have some sort of graphics 
buried in the computer, but we have yet to coax it out," he says with a 
laugh. 

The story of the tree-modeling program itself begins with Prince's 
work in a Stanford class called "Policy Decision Making Regarding the 
Environment." When a ten-page paper was assigned, she asked for per- 
mission to write about her work with the tree program in her neighbor- 
hood. One thing led to another. 



"1 thought I was just going to do some kind of critique of the tree 
plan," she says. "But then we started getting more excited about doing 
an original paper using the computer. I began one morning hashing out 
some different ideas about forest size, stability, and necessary planting 
rates." 

"It was easy enough to write a model that was hand-crankable," says 
Schrom. "Once we had it reduced to something that a human being 
might do with hand calculations, we then just made it a series of calcula- 
tions by a machine." 

Credit for writing the actual program goes to Hook. When Magic 
first got the Apple, Hook didn't know how to do anything on it. In time- 
honored fashion, he simply began leafing through the manuals, figuring 
out how to use the Apple's standard features — like text editing and file 
management. 

Tree Programming Months. Working ten hours a week. Hook spent 
three months developing the forest management model program. The 
forest manager who uses it must determine how many miles of pave- 
ment are in his city and decide what percentage of the pavement he wants 
to shade. Next, the forester must specify either how many trees he wants 
in the forest or the distance between the trees. Finally, the model asks 
him to choose up to twelve different tree types and to estimate such fac- 
tors as their growth rate, shape, and expected useful life. 

From this data the model calculates the percentage of the pavement 
that would be shaded at noon on June 21 at the city's latitude and how 
many trees of each type would have to be planted and removed every 
year to maintain a stable forest. Another piece of software (not yet writ- 
ten) will compute the cost of the forest modeled. 

Prince acknowledges an unavoidable hmitation in the forest model- 
ing program: No one can say exactly how long trees will live, especially 
before they are in the ground. 

"It's a really controversial issue," she says, "because foresters have 
not been keeping records long enough to have good data to draw on. 
They have their own eyes and their experience. They can see what's 
dying." 

What she and the others stress is the necessity that the yearly plant-

ing rate be derived by dividing the number of trees in the forest by the av- 
erage life expectancy of the trees. For example, to have a forest of one 
hundred thousand trees living an average of fifty years requires a yearly 
planting rate of two thousand trees. 

A printout from the forest-model program shows how using the 
planting rate of seven hundred fifty trees per year proposed by the city 
arborist would eventually have left the city with fifty-four thousand 
trees — roughly half the number it has now, with only 32 percent of the 
pavement shaded. A task-force report recently adopted by the city calls 
for 50 percent shade coverage. 

VisiTrees. Like a well-known electronic spreadsheet program, the 
forest-modeling program allows the user to ask "What if?" 

"Suppose the trees can be made to grow faster?" Schrom says. "Or 
suppose we plant only trees that will live to be one hundred years old? 
We have learned about the consequences of all kinds of different man- 
agement decisions. The machine is much faster than we are. We were 
able to go through half a dozen versions of the forest ourselves, but the 
computer does in minutes what took us days." 

Besides being faster, the computer has increased Magic's credibility. 
"We are speaking beyond our credentials," Schrom says, recognizing 
that a nonpracticing lawyer, a Stanford undergraduate in biology, and a 
German scholar lacking the proper training in electronics cannot easily 
command respect as "urban foresters." 

"The nice thing about the modeling program is that we can get past 
the point where we're debating how long the trees are going to live or 
how big they're going to get," Schrom says. "We can just say, 'Okay, 
let's assume all that's true. Then what happens?' We've been confronted 
by people who've been making wildly optimistic assumptions, which 
were inadequate to support the existing policy. Now we have a machine 
with which we can demonstrate various plans using a computer that does 
not have a bias toward our point of view." 

Schrom wants to show the people of Palo Alto the consequences of 
several alternative courses of action. Some of those courses wdll be better 
than others, depending on the wishes of the community. Most impor- 
tant to Schrom is that the decision be a community choice and that it be 
an informed choice. And that they have some mechanism (like the 
model) for keeping it both. 

The Authoritrees Respond. Palo Alto city officials have responded 
cautiously to the output from Magic's forest modeling efforts. City coun- 
cil member and former mayor Fred Eyerley says the city will use data 
processing technology in its tree survey scheduled to be done over the 
next fifteen years. Magic and other neighborhood groups have pushed 
for accelerating the detailed tree survey in order to have the information 
sooner. Eyerley is a forester trained at the University of Oregon, and he 
says that Magic's approach seems like a good one. 

At a late May meeting the Palo Alto city council adopted a tree-man- 
agement program calling for planting seventy-five hundred trees over the 
next six years. Although the number is smaller than hoped for, the Magic 
people are looking on the bright side. 

"The management plan as first submitted set the annual planting rate 
at seven hundred fifty trees," Schrom said after the council meeting. "As 
a result of the model we generated, which was in the hands of the city 
staff and council members at the meeting, they upped their planting rate 
by five hundred trees a year. This is a dramatic shift. 

"A lot of people who know what goes into a model like this and the 
kind of service one can get from it are looking at the model and seeing 
that we can be taken seriously." 

.In case there's any doubt that machines like the Apple will be as 
revolutionary as the printing press, the story of Magic foretells that wide- 
spread access to the ability to collect, store, and manipulate numbers ap- 
pears certain to change at least the process of political and social 
decision making. !]■

□ In a move that may shape the industry for 
years to come, MicroPro International (San 
Rafael, CA) has filed suit against a software 
rental company. MicroPro, maker of Word- 
Star, is charging United Computer (Culver 
City, CA) with copyright infringement. The 
suit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Francis- 
co, claims that United Computer removes the li- 
cense agreement from MicroPro software pack- 
ages, repackages them, and rents them for 15 to 
25 percent of the suggested retail price. Micro- 
Pro is asking $14 million in punitive damages 
and $50,000 for each copyright infringement of 
its software products. "It is abundantly clear 
that the company is renting software programs 
so that customers can illegally copy them," said 
E. Ric Giardina, general counsel for MicroPro. 
Giardina said that he expects other software 
manufacturers to follow the MicroPro lead in 
filing suit against United Computer and other 
software rental firms. MicroPro and Digital Re- 
search were awarded $250,000 in a similar case 
last fall in which they charged Dataforce Inter- 
national with illegal copying of software pro- 
grams. 




Todd M. Porter, vice president of Microlon's soft- 
ware division. 

□ Microlon (San Marcos, TX) has an- 
nounced the appointment of Todd M. Porter as 

vice president of its new software division. Por- 
ter was previously a consultant and program- 
mer at Penguin (Geneva, IL), where he helped 
create the graphics for Spy's Demise. Porter's 
other credits include the graphics for a Xerox 
commercial and graphics for Armchair Quar- 
terback, a pilot game show that will air this fall. 
The aim of the new software division is to give 
young, advanced programmers a chance to sub- 
mit their programs to Microlon for evaluation 
and possible publication. 
D Under an agreement signed between Ultra- 



soft (Bellevue, WA) and Broderbund (San Ra- 
fael, CA), the latter company will be releasing 
Atari and Commodore 64 versions of two Ul- 
trasoft adventures — Mask of the Sun and Ser- 
pent's Star. Doug Carlston, presidoit of Broder- 
bund, said he hopes in the future Broderbund 
will be able to publish more programs created 
by Ultrasoft. In other Ultrasoft news, the com- 
pany is now making a minority equity position 
available to generate capital, said Larry Franlts, 
general manager. 

□ Softsel Computer Products (Inglewood, 
CA) will sponsor comprehensive software-deal- 
er training programs, president Robert S. Leff 
announced at the Consumer Electronics Show 
in Chicago this past June. Softeach: The Soft- 
ware Training Forum will consist of multiven- 
dor training forums in four cities and will be 
offered free to Softsel dealers. The two-day 
forums, to be held in Los Angeles, New York, 
Chicago, and Dallas, will feature seminars 
conducted by Lotus, Microsoft, VisiCorp, 
MicroPro, Ashton-Tate, Digital Research, 
Spinnaker, Sierra On-Line, Datamost, Micro 
Lab, Continental, and other software compa- 
nies. The seminars will focus on explanations of 
product features and on techniques to sell prod- 
ucts more effectively. 

Softsel has also opened a forty-two-thou- 
sand-square-foot regional sales, service, and 
warehouse facility in Chicago. Regional sales 
offices will be added in Seattle, Minneapolis, and 
Washington, D.C., this summer, and ware- 
houses comparable to the Chicago facility will 
be opened in Atlanta and Dallas next year. Ac- 
cording to David Blumstein, vice president of 
Softsel, the expansion is part of Softsel's long- 
range plan to decentralize its support to retail- 
ers. "Our new Chicago operation will allow us 
to ship software to our Midwest customers even 
more quickly and inexpensively," said Blum- 
stein. "We'll also be able to offer them on-site 
training plus the fast, personal response a local- 
ized sales and service staff can provide." 

□ Apple Computer (Cupertino, CA) is offer- 
ing kits for organizing computer clubs to ten 
thousand elementary and secondary schools na- 
tionwide. To obtain a computer-club kit, 
schools must send to Apple a letter written on 
school stationery and signed by the school's 
principal. The name of an adult sponsor who is 
willing to advise at least twelve interested stu- 
dents also must be included. 

Apple is also sponsoring a competition in 
which computer clubs and individual elemen- 
tary-school students will compete for travel, 
cash, and computer equipment worth more 
than $100,000. Entrants are encouraged to sub- 
mit projects in which they use microcomputers 



to serve the community. Entries will be eval- 
uated by independent judges selected for their 
prominence in the computer and education 
fields. Competition finalists will be flown to 
Washington, D.C., where the winners will be 
named. 

Apple Computer is now giving grants to 
community organizations across the country to 
establish information networks based on mi- 
crocomputers. The first grants, valued at more 
than $206,000, were given to eight networks 
whose interests range from infant health care to 
employment opportunities for older citizens. 
Through the networks, organizations provid- 
ing similar services are linked together by com- 
puter, enabling them to share information and 
resources. Apple reviews network proposals 
and awards grants quarterly. A proposed net- 
work is evaluated on the benefits it provides to 
the community, its suitability for microcom- 
puters, and its sustainability. Winning commu- 
nity organizations are provided with computer 
equipment, computer accessories, software, and 
computer training.

\ An X 

^Applesoft " 





kDoiigCarkton 



Our final Applesoft project is one that requires an understanding of 
the way Applesoft is stored in the Apple. We are going to build a pro- 
gram that graphs mathematical functions that we enter from the key- 
board. To do this, we'll have to accept the function as an input string, 
convert it into the key codes of Applesoft, and then poke it directly into 
the Apple's memory so that the string becomes a part of the Applesoft 
program. 

We'll start this program off just like many others, by jumping over 
the subroutine area to line 500 and setting up a menu: 

10 GOTO 500 

500 REM 

501 REM MAIN MENU 

502 REM 

505 ONERR GOTO 2000 

510 HOME :A$ = "GRAPHING PROGRAM": GOSUB 50 

520 VTAB 8: HTAB 10: PRINT "E(NTER FORMULA": PRINT : HTAB 

10: PRINT "G(RAPH FORMULA": PRINT : PRINT : HTAB 10 
530 GET A$: IF A$ < > "E" AND A$ < > "G" THEN 530 
540 IF A$ = "G" THEN 1000 

We're going to trap our own errors at line 2000 (trying in particular 
to avoid program interruption from division by zero errors). And we're 
going to use our usual centering subroutine to put up a title: 

50 VTAB 1 : HTAB 1 : IF LEN (A$) < 39 THEN HTAB 20 - LEN (A$) / 2 

55 INVERSE : PRINT A$: NORMAL : RETURN 

As you can see from the menu section, this little program has only 
two parts. The first permits us to input a formula; the second allows us to 
graph it. Let's take a look at the input routine first. 

We want to print "Y = " and then leave a blinking cursor, waiting 
for the user to complete the expression (so as to leave no doubt in the 
user's mind as to the form of the expression). When the user completes 
the line and presses return, we will store the entire line in the string FM$ 
(for formula). 

Then we'll take the string FM$ apart and convert it into tokenized 
Applesoft by taking any parts that are Applesoft commands and replac- 
ing them with their token values. Once converted, the string will be 
poked into a place in the program where it can be treated as just another 
Applesoft line. 

Probably the first thing we should do, then, is figure out where we are 
going to poke this new line of Applesoft. Last month we suggested put- 
ting the line near the beginning of the program so that its address in 
memory would stay the same even if we changed parts of the program. 
We also suggested that a dummy line could be set up using colons. In 
Applesoft the colon just means "Now here comes a brand-new line of 
Applesoft." Saying that repeatedly shouldn't do any harm. 

So let's add a new subroutine at the very beginning of the program: 
20 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 

25 RETURN 

It doesn't say much now but just wait! (Make certain, by the way, 
that you include enough colons in line 20 — keep typing until the warn- 
ing bell sounds.) 

The first thing we need to find out is the address in memory of the 



first colon in line 20. We should be able to figure it out by counfing: five 
header bytes to line 10, plus a token for goto and three digits in 500. 
Add to that the five header bytes to line 20 and we should be pretty sure 
that the first colon will have an address 5-1-1-1-3-1-5 = 14 bytes from 
the start of the program. Since Applesoft programs ordinarily load at ad- 
dress 2048, the first colon should appear at address 2062. 
Of course, there's an easy way to check: 

FOR X = 2048 TO 2100: PRINT X;" ";GHR$ (PEEK(X)),: NEXT 
So now we know where to poke. All that remains is to figure out 
what to poke. Let's start writing the input routine: 

600 REM *" INPUT FORMULA "* 

610 VTAB 8: HTAB 8: CALL - 958: PRINT FM$ 

620 VTAB 12: HTAB 8: INPUT "Y = ";A$ 

Line 610 clears everything on the screen except for the title. It also 
prints the current value of FM$, in case this is not the first time through 
the program. Line 620 gets the user's input. Now, what do we do with it? 

If the user just wants to come to this secfion to review his formula, he 
should be able to leave without having to type it in all over again. If, on 
the other hand, he has typed in a new formula, we should start process- 
ing. Let's figure out which situation we are in: 

630 IF A$ = "" THEN 500 

Assuming that A$ is equal to something, it's time to put the new 
formula into the subroutine at line 20. First, let's make up our string 
FM$: 

640 FM$ = "Y = " + A$ 

The next step may seem a little peculiar. Now we have to poke co- 
lons into line 20: 

650 FOR X = 1 TO 116: POKE 2061 + X,58: NEXT 

The reason we do this is so that, if we are using this routine more 
than once, we will not accidentally enter a short formula only to find the 
tail end of the previous, longer formula appended at the end of line 20! 

Our next step is to poke the entire string into line 20 without worry- 
ing about tokens for the moment: 

660 FOR X = 1 TO LEN (FM$): POKE 2061 + X, ASC ( MID$ 
(FM$,X,1)): NEXT 

Unfortunately, the various mathematical symbols such as =, *, /, 
and the like are not represented in Applesoft by their ASCII values. If 
they were, we would be finished. Instead, they are represented by other 
numbers called tokens — a list of these tokens can be found in Appendix 
F of Apple's Applesoft manual. So now we have to figure out when and 
where to replace the ASCII values we poked with token values: 

670 FOR X = 1 TO LEN (FM$):A = ASC ( MID$ (FM$,X,1)): IF (A> 
41 and A < 48) OR A = 94 OR (A > 59 AND A < 63) THEN 690 
680 NEXT : GOTO 500 

This is not necessarily the most elegant way to do it, but it works. 
Look over the list of tokens and mark down the items we have to token- 
ize. Note, incidentally, that the system we are using allows us to use only 
one-character keywords like =. If we tried to use the trig functions, we 
would already have poked three separate characters into line 20, and re- 
placing the three with one token would be a major chore. 

There should be eight keywords on your list. Now let's look at the 
ASCII character codes in Appendix K and find out where these eight 
characters stand. 



Build up to the 
ultimate challenge. 



If you thought you'd conquered every 
maze on earth, guess again. 

Now there's the Maze Craze 
Construction Set™. The newest and 
greatest challenge of them all. You can 
actually build your own mazes from the 
ground up — and make them as 
mind-boggling as you dare. 

That's only part of the fun. You can 
also create players and menacing 
monsters from your own imagination. 
Or nightmares. And choose speed, 
intelligence and sensitivity too. 



To get the hang of it, play some of our 
most challenging combinations. Then, 
construct your own and save your 
favorites for future skirmishes. 

Keep your wits about you, though. 
You are not alone. Maze Craze can be 
played with two players in the same 
maze. Try to beat your own game — or 
indulge in a little friendly vengeance 
with an adversary. 

Meet the ultimate challenge: Maze 
Craze. With over a million possibilities, 
it's not likely you'll get bored in this 
century.

All our routine needs to do is find any characters in FM$ that have 
any of these ASCII values and poke the corresponding token value into 
the correct spot in subroutine 20. This isn't hard at all: 

690 RESTORE 

700 READ B,C: IF A = B THEN POKE 2061 + X,G: GOTO 680 
710 GOTO 700 

720 DATA 42,202,43,200,44,44,45,201,46,46,47,203,60,209,61, 
208,62,207,94,204 

We took each pair of numbers and put them into the data statement. 
Line 700 reads them out, one pair at a time, compares the first number in 
each pair with the ASCII value of the character selected by line 670, and, 
if there is a match, pokes the second value in the pair into subroutine 20. 

After all that, the graphing portion of this program is going to look 
trivial: 

1000 HGR2 : HCOLOR= 1: HPLOT 0,95 TO 279,95: HPLOT 141,0 
TO 141,191: HCOLOR= 3 

First we turn on the graphics page and plot the X and Y axes in 
green. Then we plot the formula curve in white: 

1010 FOR X = - 139 TO 139, 

1020 GOSUB 20 

1030 IF Y < - 96 OR Y > 95 THEN FLAG = 0: GOTO 1050 

1040 IF FLAG THEN HPLOT TO X + 140,95 - Y: GOTO 1050 

1045 FLAG = 1: HPLOT X + 140,95 - Y 

1050 NEXT : GET A$: TEXT :FLAG = 0:Y = 0: GOTO 500 

As usual, the most complicated part of this comes from taking meas- 
ures to ensure that both the X and the Y values are within allowable 
ranges. We don't have to worry much about X; we have complete con- 
trol over it. However, the value of Y depends entirely upon the function 
the user has entered in hne 20. When the plot is entirely within legal 
bounds, we like to use the hplot to command, because it connects the 



dots and makes a smoother graph. However, when something has gone 
completely off the chart, we have to start plotting with an hplot com- 
mand when it first comes back on the chart. That's why we use the vari- 
able FLAG as we do. 

Note also that we have inverted the value of Y so that it will plot the 
low values of Y at the bottom of the screen rather than at the top. 

All that remains is to write our error-trapping routine. Our main con- 
cern is that users will write functions involving division by zero at some 
point: Y = 100/X. Rather than aborting the whole program at that 
point, it would be better if the program skipped that one point and con- 
tinued. So let's write an error routine that advances the value of X, 
checks again for legitimacy, and then resumes normal operation: 

2000 HPLOT X + 140, 0:X = X + 1: POKE 216,0: ONERR GOTO 
2000 

2010 IF X > 139 THEN POP: GOTO 1050 
2020 RESUME 

We have the routine plot a dot at the top of the screen so that we can 
monitor what's going on. It then increments X, turns off the error flag, 
and resumes normal activity. 

Sometimes, incrementing X doesn't solve the problem. Imagine, for 
example, that the user entered Y = X/Y. Since Y has an initial value of 
zero, this formula will be in error regardless of the value of X. Therefore, 
we do have to have some way of leaving subroutine 20 after an appro- 
priate amount of time. That's what line 2010 does — it gets us out of the 
subroutine gracefully and lands us at the end of the the for-next loop, 
whence we can exit to the main menu without leaving any unfinished 
business (either subroutine or loop) lying about in the stack. 

Your Mission — Explore the Applesoft Frontier. This is the last pro- 
gram we are going to be privileged to share with one another. This col- 
umn was intended to take you through Applesoft in a way that would 
encourage you to continue your explorations on your own. It's a won- 
derful language, and if you've been a regular reader since January 1982, 
you've had a chance to play with virtually every command in the lan- 
guage. But now's the acid test. Off come the training wheels. 

Now that you know the words, let's see what you have to say.Di

This month's Basic Solution presents a pro- 
gram that will help a small business track ac- 
counting information in a couple of important 
areas. It is written as a sales ledger that allows 
you to enter amounts for individual invoices 
and disburse the total among a number of dif- 
ferent accounts, such as cash sales, accounts re- 
ceivable, sales taxes, and so on. 

Many small businesses, even if they use a 
computer for other applications, are reluctant 
to convert their entire accounting systems to 
computer. This program may be a good start- 



ing place for such a change because it doesn't 
try to convert a whole system at once. 

When you run the program you get a menu 
like so: 



Name invoice file 
Invoice entry 
Print invoice file 
Exit 



The first thing you have to do is name your 
file; the program won't let you enter an invoice 
or print a file until it knows what file to per- 
form those operations on. When you select the

first option, the program catalogs the disk, and 
you can either select an existing file from the 
catalog or create a new one by typing in a new 
file name. 

If you choose to create a new one, you will 
be asked to specify the accounts to which 
money entered into the new file may be dis- 
bursed. The default accounts appear in the da- 
ta statements at the end of the program. You 
can enter different ones either by adding them 
to the end of the offered list while running the 
program or by changing the defaults in the da- 
ta statements. Be sure to change the number in 
line 9999 if you change the number of default 
accounts. 

Once the program has an invoice file to 
work with, you can enter invoices or print the 
file. When you want to enter an invoice, the 
computer prompts you for an invoice number, 
a date, an amount, the client's name, and any 
comment you might want to add. When this da- 
ta is entered and confirmed, the computer asks 
you to break down the total from the invoice 
into the separate accounts. 

When you select the print-file option from 
the menu, the computer prints all the data from 
that file, breaking the totals into the separate ac- 
counts and then printing the account totals. 

You can adapt the program to keep track of 
check disbursements or other accounting infor- 
mation by changing the appropriate accounts 
and a few of the prompts. 

Good luck with your programming.

BASIC TUTOR makes learning BASIC easy. With it 
your Apple will give you step-by-step instruction in 
handling all the fundamental elements of the BASIC 
language. 

BASIC TUTOR begins in lesson one by assuming you 
have no knowledge of programming. By the end of the 
last lesson you will be writing carefully planned, well- 
constructed programs of your own. 

BASIC TUTOR is interactive, prompting you with 
questions to which you will respond at the keyboard. 
Positive reinforcement is given with each correct 
answer, and specific aid is provided with each incorrect 
answer to help lead you in the right direction. Also, 
frequent summaries and reviews help make your new 
knowledge stick. 

BASIC TUTOR was designed for self-instruction. You 
can work at your own pace to optimize your learning 
curve. And BASIC TUTOR is fully compatible with 
Applesoft BASIC, so that any original programs you 
write will immediately run on your Apple computer. 



BASIC TUTOR was written for SuperSoft by 
Courseware Applications, one of the pioneers in 
Computer Aided Instruction. Courseware Applications 
has had extensive experience in all areas of C.A.I. , 
including corporate training programs, educational 
instruction (including programs for the international 
PLATO network), and military simulation courses. This

SOFTCARD 
Symposhim 

by Greg Tlbbetts 



Welcome to the August installment of SoftCard Symposium and our 
continuing examination of the BIOS disk I/O arrangement. When we 
left off last month, we had begun examining the disk data structures and 
data collections. We covered a lot of ground in that column, discussing 
the format of information on the disk surface, the structure of the disk 
parameter block (DPB), and the CSV (checksum vector) and ALV (allo- 
cation vector) data collections. Our discussion was very involved; fortu- 
nately, we succeeded in covering the most complicated of the data struc- 
tures. This month, therefore, we'll tackle the less complex ones: the di- 
rectory buffer (DIRBUF), the sector translation table (XLT), and the 
root structure of the disk data elements — the disk parameter header 
(DPH). After that, we'll tie all of these items together so that we can 
better see their relationships to each other. 

First, let's consider the directory buffer. This data collection is simi- 
lar to the ALV and CSV data collections in that it is simply an area that 
BDOS uses to store disk information. This 128-byte buffer must be lo- 
cated in an area that's accessible to BDOS at all times and yet not sub- 
ject to being overwritten by BIOS operations or user programs. 

BDOS uses DIRBUF as its sole area for reading in the directory of 
the disk (one sector at a time). One would think that BDOS would use a 
single buffer (probably the default buffer at 80H) for the reading of all 
disk data, both file records and directory sectors, but, in fact, BDOS 
maintains two default buffers. The buffer at 80H is used for loading of 
file records, while DIRBUF is used for all directory operations. 

Those of you familiar with BDOS system calls are probably now 
wondering why directory information is sometimes seen in the 80H 
buffer (an examination of 80H will often show such information when 
programs are being executed with DDT, for example). The reason is that 
during some system calls, BDOS must provide the user or his programs 
with directory information. BDOS itself does not use any buffer except 
DIRBUF for reading in this information, but it cannot allow the user to 
access DIRBUF and possibly alter its contents. Therefore, BDOS copies 
information out of DIRBUF into the user buffer during those system 
calls, thus ensuring that users get what they need and that the integrity of 
its own information is preserved. 

BDOS uses DIRBUF for everything related to the directory. When a 
drive is logged in, BDOS loads each directory sector into DIRBUF to 
compute the checksums for the CSV table. As BDOS works with a file, it 
fills DIRBUF with the directory sector containing the entry for that file 
(or file extent). And as BDOS manipulates the file, reading from it or 
writing to it, it sometimes uses the image of the directory entry stored in 
DIRBUF as a source of information it needs — namely, the block num- 
ber, extent number, and so on, as we discussed last month when we 
talked about directory entries. DIRBUF is also used to keep track tem- 
porarily of some of the changes that may be made to an entry (until 
BDOS gets the chance to write the altered entry out to disk). 

Using DIRBUF in this fashion reduces the number of times BDOS 
must read from or write to the disk directory during file input and 
output. This represents a large improvement in performance, since reac- 
cessing the directory would require BDOS to move the drive's 
read /write head to the directory track, read or write sectors, and then re- 
turn the head to the track containing the current portion of the file being 
manipulated. The slowest part of disk operation is moving the read/write 
head from track to track, so anything that reduces the number of these 



I 

head movements speeds things up considerably. 

BDOS could take the approach of placing more information into 
DIRBUF (or use a larger DIRBUF), thereby reducing still further the 
number of directory accesses (mostly writes). But BDOS must update the 
directory from memory on a regular basis in order to preserve disk integ- 
rity; and the longer BDOS goes between directory writes as it alters in- 
formation on the disk, the greater the user's opportunity to reset the 
computer, remove the disk, or take some other action that would leave 
the directory reflecting an inaccurate description of the disk's contents. 
(Obviously, DIRBUF need not be initialized to any particular value.) 

The next data item we'll examine is the sector translation table 
(XLT). The initials XLT stand in this case for the word translate, with X 
representing the partial word trans, as is common in the electronics in- 
dustry (recall Xmit for transmit, and so on). Although the XLT data 
structure is not officially used in SoftCard CP/M, we'll discuss it any- 
way, since it is widely used in generic CP/M and is an important concept. 

In our first column on the BIOS disk 1 /O (June 1983), we drew a pie 
diagram with sixteen sections to show the relationship between logical

and physical sectors. We numbered the pie sections sequentially 0 to 15 
around the outside of the circle. We numbered the pie sections inside as 
well, but that time we skipped two sections between each number; in 
other words, while the section numbered 0 on the inside was also num- 
bered 0 on the outside, the section numbered 1 on the inside had the 
number 3 on the outside, the section with a 2 inside was numbered 6 out- 
side, and so on. By skipping two sections each time, we went completely 
around the pie three full times before we finished the writing of the inside 
numbers. 

Our result, then, was a pie diagram (see figure 1) containing sixteen 
wedge-shaped sections, each with a number inside and a number out- 
side. This diagram represented the disk surface, with the numbers 
equivalent to the disk sectors. The outside numbers represented the 
physical sectors and the inside numbers the logical sectors. The term 
physical in this case referred to the fact that when the disk is formatted, 
those sector numbers are the ones written into the sector address field. 
Insofar as the controller is concerned, then, these are the only sector 
numbers that exist.

Figure 1. Pie diagram illustrating 
a disk surface with a two-sector 
software interleave arrangement. 

(Physical sector numbers are 
outside the circle, logical sector 
numbers are inside.) 



One would think that physical sector numbers would be enough. 
However, for the system to use these physical numbers, it must be able to 
process data fast enough that when it has read one sector, it can process 
the data and return to read the next sector before the start of that sector 
has passed under the read/ write head. Otherwise, an entire disk revolu- 
tion will be lost between each sector read, resulting in the problem 
spoken of before, known as blowing revs. 

A system that's not fast enough to prevent blowing revs must in- 
crease the space between sectors on the disk to avoid the problem. One 
way of increasing the space between sectors is by formatting with the 
physical sector numbers interleaved (that is, skipping sectors between 
each sector number). This is physical sector interleaving (also called hard- 
ware interleaving, since in many systems the disk controller completely 
controls what numbers get written into the address field of each sector). 

Early disk controllers, however, weren't capable of formatting disks 
in any other fashion than with sector numbers in sequential order. The 
method that was arrived at is the one illustrated in the pie diagram we 
prepared. The disk's physical sectors (address-field numbers) are in se- 
quential order on the disk, just as they were in the pie diagram. How- 
ever, in writing data from memory to the disk, the operating system uses 
a different order — the logical sector numbers. As we discussed in June, 
this is called software interleaving, since it is the operating system (the 
software) that takes care of the interleave, letting the disk controller 
access the sectors in normal fashion (by their physical numbers). 

In order to perform this software interleaving, the operating system 
needs some way of translating back and forth between the physical sec- 
tor numbers required by the disk controller and the logical sector num- 
bers requested by the user or calculated by the operating system from the 
directory data. It is the sector translation table (XLT) that enables the 
operating system to perform this function. To see how this works, look 
again at the pie diagram reproduced in figure 1 . The diagram illustrates a 
two-sector interleave, since two physical sectors are skipped between 
each logical sector. 

The XLT table for such an interleave would be created by simply list- 
ing the physical sector numbers in the order they would appear if we 
counted the logical numbers in sequence. See figure 2. 



logical # = 00,01,02,03,04,05,06,07,08,09,10,11,12,13,14,15 
physical # = 00,03,06,09,12,15,02,05,08,11,14,01,04,07,10,13 
Figure 2. XLT for two-sector interleave. 

The XLT in this case would be the second list of numbers in figure 2, 
the list preceded by the word physical. We use the XLT by finding the 
sector number we want in the logical-sector list and then taking the num- 
ber directly underneath it in the physical-sector list. The process we have 
just described, however, uses both lists, and we've already said that the 
XLT is just the physical-number list. Is there a way we can make the 
translation using just one list? Yes. To see how that's done, you must 
notice that each sector number in the logical list is equal to its offset 
value from the start of the list — that is, sector 01 is equal to the start of 
the list plus 1 . It's possible, therefore, to use the logical sector number we 
are seeking as an offset value into the physical-sector list. For example, 
finding what physical sector contains logical sector 2 is a matter of look- 
ing at the entry in the physical list that is equal to the start of the list plus 
2. That entry is the third item in the list (remember, you must count 
START -1-0 also) and is physical sector number 6. The number 6, then, is 
the physical-sector number we must give the disk controller in order to 
get back logical sector number 2. That's all there is to it. 

So far we haven't spoken about SoftCard's method of interleaving. 
Since the technology on which the Apple Disk II system is based is large- 
ly unlike standard disk controller technology, the low-level read/write- 
track/ sector (RWTS) routines actually form something resembling a 
"software disk controller." The operating system passes the command, 
track number, sector number, and other information to the RWTS rou- 
tines and receives back a sector of data at an appointed place. Inside 
RWTS, there's an interleaving table in use, but this table is essentially 
transparent to the operating system and to anything else that may access 
RWTS. The interleave used here was designed to achieve maximum effi- 
ciency with access by RWTS, and given that, SoftCard's designers saw 
little to be gained by altering this system. SoftCard, therefore, treats the 
Apple RWTS routines (a part of Apple CP/M) simply as it would a disk- 
controller ROM. 

As it turned out, however, CP/M was still not fast enough to process 
a sector of data and reaccess RWTS without blowing revs. Therefore, a 
separate table that takes RWTS's two-sector interleave and translates it 
into a three-sector interleave was designed for use with SoftCard. 

This arrangement may seem unnecessarily complex. Why didn't Soft- 
Card's designers create the inefficiency (that is, after all, what we're do- 
ing when we interleave) by altering the interleave table inside RWTS? 
That would have avoided having two interleave tables and the code that 
goes with them. Altering RWTS, however, would have two negative ef- 
fects. First, as mentioned before, the interleave in RWTS is designed to 
maximize efficient access by RWTS. Making RWTS less efficient would 
solve the problem for CP/M, but what about the effect that that would 
have on ufilities like COPY and FORMAT, which access RWTS direct- 
ly? They don't need to be slowed down. An interleave table in CP/M 
handles the situation by putting the slowing-down factor where it is need- 
ed — within the operating system itself Second, altering RWTS would 
destroy its ability to read standard Apple DOS format disks correctly. 
This is not a major problem, but leaving RWTS in its standard form 
means that utilities can be written that will read a DOS disk into mem- 
ory with the sectors in a proper order, again by accessing RWTS 
directly. 

With those two things in mind, it was decided to consider RWTS a 
black box as far as CP/M was concerned and to maintain its Apple com- 
patibility. SoftCard, therefore, does perform software interleaving. Why, 
then, doesn't it have an XLT? The reason is that the Apple has to deal 
with only one disk format — its own. Because the operating system would 
never have to deal with disk drives other than Disk II, the interleaving 
could be built directly into the disk drivers and the entire XLT/SEC- 
TRAN combination could be eliminated. This may seem shortsighted in 
view of the number of hard-disk, eight-inch floppy, and other add-ons 
available, but it really presents no limitation, since all of these products 
require that the BIOS drivers be radically modified to communicate with 
standard disk controllers anyway. We'll examine this area further when 
we talk about the actual BIOS routines.

AUGUST 1983 



This brings us to the final data structure we'll be discussing — the disk 
parameter header, or DPH. As we've said, the DPH is the root structure 
of the disk data elements. By knowing its location, BDOS (or any other 
program) can find all other data elements pertaining to the drive in ques- 
tion. Because it contains pointers to information that cannot be shared 
among drives, the DPH must be unique for each drive; in other words, 
each drive must have its own DPH. 

Like the DPB, which we discussed last month, the DPH is made up 
of a number of data fields. A data field in this case is one or more contig- 
uous bytes used for a specific purpose. The DPH has eight data fields, 
each of which is sixteen bits long. Obviously, then, the length of each 
DPH is sixteen bytes. Most of the data fields in the DPH are well docu- 
mented by Digital Research, but three of them— DIRMAX, CURTRK, 
and CURREC — are used by BDOS for temporary storage and are for 
the most part undocumented and uncommented by DRI. The passage of 
time and the efforts of users have uncovered the uses and purposes of 
these three fields, and — to a limited extent, at least — we'll document them 
here. This information is of limited use, however, and affects our present 
discussion only minimally, so we won't go into great detail. 

The DPH's sixteen bytes, then, are arranged as shown in figure 3.

Figure 3. DPH data structure. 









As can be seen from an examination of figure 3, knowing the start- 
ing location of the structure (shown as DPH) enables BDOS to find any 
field it needs by adding the field's offset value (shown as +n«) to the 
start address. To obtain the DPB address, for example, BDOS gets the 
DPH address from SELDSK (which we looked at briefly in June) and 
adds 10. BDOS can then simply load bytes number ten and eleven and it 
will have the DPB address. Now let's take a look at each of the fields. 

Located at DPH 4-0, the XLT field contains one of two things — the

address of the XLT table (described earlier) or, if no translation is nec- 
essary (either because the drive uses physical interleaving or because 
there is no interleaving), two bytes of zeros. A zero value in the XLT field 
informs BDOS that no translafion is necessary. This tells BDOS that it 
can skip the usual call to SECTRAN and make the call to SETSEC with 
the logical sector number it wants. A certain degree of performance in- 
crease is realized by eliminating the call to SECTRAN, but it's so small by 
comparison with the actual disk access time that it's negligible for the 
most part. We'll postpone further discussion of sector translation until 
we talk about the actual BIOS disk subroutines. 

The field at DPH -1-2, labeled in figure 3 as DIRMAX, is the first of 
the temporary locations used by BDOS. One of the first things BDOS 
does during drive select is to build a table of pointers inside itself, using 
selected fields of the DPH. DIRBUF, DPB, CSV, and other data fields 
have their contents copied directly from the DPH into this table. 
DIRMAX, along with the two fields that follow it, however, does not 
have its contents copied. Rather, the addresses of these fields are copied 
into the table instead; that is, the addresses DPH-l-2, DPH-l-4, and 
DPH -1-6 are copied by BDOS into its table. In this way, these three fields 
of the DPH are used as an actual data storage area, like the CSV or 
DIRBUF, rather than as a pointer to a data storage area. 

DIRMAX (DRM), the first of these three temporary locafions, con- 
tains a two-byte value that represents the number of valid (in use) direc- 
tory entries for this disk. Remember we said last month that the DPB 
field DRM specifies the maximum number of directory entries the disk 
could hold. Remember also that we said BDOS reads these entries on a 
regular basis when searching the directory, compiling checksums, and so 
on. In an attempt to optimize this searching, BDOS adds up the valid di- 
rectory entries and places this resulting value in the DIRMAX field. 
From then on, by updating this value during directory additions and 
deletions, BDOS always knows how many active entries are in this di- 
rectory and can stop searching when it reaches that point. Given a disk 
format that allows a maximum of 1,024 directory entries but contains 
only twenty active entries, this has the effect of speeding up searches 
considerably. 

CURTRK, at DPH 4-4, is the second of these temporary locations. It 
contains the current track address of the drive — that is, the current track 
the drive is posifioned to. BDOS keeps track of this value during all file 
accesses and updates it constantly. This is the area that's used during cal- 
culations of track numbers from virtual record numbers before calls are 
issued to the BIOS SETTRK routine. Prior to each call to the BIOS 
HOME routine, the value at CURTRK is reset to zero. 

The CURREC value, found at DPH-l-6, is similar to CURTRK; it is 
the current virtual record number for that drive. It is also used in calculat- 
ing track numbers for BIOS SETTRK and in calculating virtual record 
numbers from the block numbers. Like CURTRK, CURREC is set to 
00 prior to a BIOS HOME call and updated thereafter on a constant 
basis whenever BDOS seeks a different track or virtual record. BDOS 
assumes that none of the three temporary variables we've been discuss- 
ing contains valid data initially, and, as a consequence, they need not be 
initialized to any specific value. 

Next is the DIRBUF field at DPH -1-8, which contains the address 
of the 1 28-byte directory buffer we discussed eariier. All DPHs usually 
have the same address in the DIRBUF field, since there's nothing to be 
gained by having more than one such directory buffer. 

The DPB field, located at DPH-(- 10, contains the address of the DPB 
data structure for the drive. As we said last month, the DPB contains all 
specific information about the disk format in use in the drive, and BDOS 
uses the DPB to obtain information about that format. Drives with the 
same format require only one such DPB to describe them; consequently 
the DPHs of such drives will all show the same DPB address in this field. 

The CSV field, located at DPH-l-12, contains the address of the 
checksum vector for this drive. As we saw last month, this data collecdon 
is the area BDOS uses to store checksum values for each directory sector 
contained on the disk. The checksum vector, therefore, gives BDOS 
something to check the directory of the current disk against to make sure 
the media has not been changed. Obviously, the checksum vector for 
each drive must, by definition, be different, so the CSV field of each 
drive's DPH will contain a separate address. 

The final DPH field, ALV at DPH -I- 14, is similar to CSV in that it

contains the address of a data collection. In this case the collection is the 
allocation vector. As we learned last month, this area is used by BDOS to 
keep track of the block numbers on the disk that are in use (allocated) 
and those that are free (unallocated). Like the checksum vector, the allo- 
cation vector must be different for each disk; therefore, the ALV field of 
each DPH will contain a different address as well. 

The DPH is the only data structure that BDOS needs to be made di- 
rectly aware of. As we've said, from this one table, BDOS can easily find 
any other information it needs concerning the drive in use. (Note that the 
DPH data structure is very much like the BIOS jump table that BDOS 
uses to find all the other various BIOS routines.) 

Up to now we've been calling the DPH the root structure of the data 
elements. To see why, take a look at figure 4, which shows the interrela- 
fionship of the various structures. As this chart shows, the DPH literally 
points to all of the other data structures and collections that pertain to 
the specific drive associated with that particular DPH. 

DPHs are ordinarily arranged in the BIOS in sequence. The DPH for 
drive A: usually comes first, followed by DPHs for all other system 
drives. In the case of SoftCard CP/M, the DPHs come immediately after 
the BIOS jump table at ODA33H in 56K (AA33H in 44K). 

There are six DPHs, corresponding to the six Apple drives allowed, 
extending to ODA93H. Since DPHs contain important inifial values, 
they cannot overlay other code when it is no longer needed. That's why 
they are in this location, where they'll be protected from damage. 

As we said earlier, no XLT structures are included in the SoftCard 
BIOS, even though software interleaving is used. Because of this, the 
XLT fields of all DPHs are zeros. DIRBUF, the 128-btye directory 
buffer, is shared by aU six drives; and consequently, the DIRBUF fields of 
all DPHs contain the same address, ODEBAH in 56K. This area does 
overlay part of the cold-boot code, since DIRBUF need not be initialized 
to particular values and is not used until after the boot code is completed. 

The ALV bit maps for the six drives (sixteen bytes for each drive) 
come next, starting at 0DF3AH for drive A:, 0DF4AH for B:, and so on. 
The ALV fields of the DPHs for drives A:, B:, and the rest contain these

addresses. These fields too overlay the cold-boot code, since they needn't 
be initialized and are not used until after the boot sequence is over. 

The CSV fields (twelve bytes for each drive) are next in memory, be- 
ginning at 0DF9AH for A:, 0DFA6H for B:, and so on. The CSV fields 
of the DPHs contain these addresses. Like the ALVs and DIRBUF, the 
CSV areas also overlay the cold-boot code, again to conserve space. 

This completes our discussion of the DPH data structure, and of the 
data segment of the BIOS disk code as well. It is hoped that this very 
technical and in-depth discussion has shed light on a complex subject. 
With this behind us, we'll proceed next month to a discussion of the 
BIOS disk I/O routines themselves. Until next month. ... □!

THE MIND-BLOWING 



If you write Pascal programs for the Apple III, you probably know 
that, being a compiled language, Pascal is considerably faster than Busi- 
ness Basic, often by a factor of ten. Even Pascal, however, may not be 
fast enough in sorting large arrays of records. A sorting routine in as- 
.sembly language should achieve the speeds necessary to sort unreason- 
able amounts of data in a reasonable period of time. The quicksort, in- 
vented by C. A. R. Hoare, is to date the most efficient sorting algorithm 
known for randomly arranged arrays, the duration of the sort being on 
the order of NIog^N, as opposed to the relative durations of the bubble 
sort, N\ and the Shell Sort, \ Mixed with assembly language speed, 



the quicksort algorithm should approach the fastest sort possible on the 
Apple III. 

The quicksort works by selecting a trial median and arranging the 
elements of the array into two partitions, one containing the elements 
that are greater than the median and the other containing those elements 
that are smaller. A trial median is then chosen for each of these parti- 
tions and the same operation is performed on each partition and so 
forth, until every subpartition has exactly one element. The array is then 
in order. 

Since the same procedure is used over and over for each subparti-

tion, the algorithm lends itself to recursive programming, which is the 
technique used in this program. Each time a partition is divided into two 
subpartitions, the top and bottom indexes of each subpartition are 
pushed onto the 6502 stack and the routine executes a JSR to itself. 
When the indexes passed on the stack are equal, the partition then con- 
tains only one element, and the routine will consequently execute an RTS 
back to the calling routine, which, of course, is itself Once the entire ar- 
ray is sorted, the RTS will return control to the Pascal host program. 

Sorting techniques are discussed at length in the November 1982 is- 
sue of Softalk in The Third Basic; it's a good reference source for those 



wanting to delve deeper into the mysteries of sorting. Those wishing 
more information should read Professor Nicklaus Wirth's chapter on 
sorting techniques in Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs, Pren- 
tice-Hall, 1976. If you program in Pascal, you should own this useful 
book anyway. 

Listing 1 is the assembly language external procedure Sort, which can 
be called by a Pascal program to sort either an array of string or an array 
of record, the first field of which is a string. In the latter case, the pro- 
gram will sort on the first field only. In order to make the listing more 
readable, the more complex routines are defined as macros, and the mac-

ro definitions that are not obvious are provided with comments. Mod- 
ifying the sort to operate on arrays of integers or reals would not be dif- 
ficult for one familiar with 6502 assembly language. 

To access the elements of the array without having to multiply each 
time, the program calculates a table of pointers, each of which points to 
the first byte of each element of the array to be sorted. The program then 
only has to multiply the array index by two and add the result to the base 
address of the array. This table is labeled "KEYS" and must be defined 
in the host program as KEYS:ARRAY[O..NUM] OF INTEGER, 
where NUM is the maximum number of elements in the array to be 
sorted. If you are not worried about conserving memory, you can define 
KEYS as a private variable of a given length and it will not be necessary 
to declare it in the host program. In such a case, KEYS must be n+ 1 
words in length, where « is the number of elements in the array to be 
sorted. For more information about public and private variables, see Ap- 
ple III Pascal Program Preparation Tools, pages 62 through 64. 

The array to be sorted may have any legal name, but it must be de- 
clared as ARRAY[1..X] where X is less than or equal to NUM, and a 
single element of the array must not be longer than 255 bytes of mem- 
ory. Each element of the array must be either a string or a record in 
which the first field declared is a string. 

The procedure is called as follows: 

SORT(SORT_ARRAY,NUMS,SIZE) 

where SORT_ARRAY is the name of the array to be sorted, NUMS is 
the number of elements of SORT_ ARRAY to be sorted, beginning with 
element [1 ] of the array, and SIZE is the length in bytes of an array ele- 
ment. SIZE may be obtained by use of the SIZEOF function.

Listing 2 is a Pascal program demonstrating the use of the Sort pro- 
cedure. Note that Sort is declared as an external procedure. The array 
NAMES to be sorted consists of records, the first field of which is a 
string of length 8 and the second field an integer. Strings in Apple Pascal 
begin with a length byte followed by the string; integers are represented 
by two bytes. It is advisable to check the size of an element with SIZEOF 
because Apple Pascal does not always pack data compactly. For in- 
stance, integers are not stored across a word boundary; thus the follow- 
ing data type

will have a length of ten bytes, not nine. The string will use seven bytes 
(one to store the length and six to hold the six characters of the string) 
and then the compiler will skip a byte to begin the integer on a word 
boundary. Thus SIZEOF(SORTREC) = 10. 

Turning off the screen by sending it a CHR(14) as is done here will 
improve the performance of the sort by a factor of 40 percent. Sending it 
CHR(15) will turn it back on. If you do not have a working system clock, 
the elapsed-time information provided in the host program will be 
useless. 

After you have assembled the sort routine and compiled the Pascal 
host program, invoke the linker and link the sort routine to the host. Of 
course, you may put Sort in a library if you wish. You will then see a 
breathtaking demonstration of what your Apple III can do when given 
the chance.

The Apple II running under DOS can handle four types of files: In- 
t^er, Applesoft, binary, and text. Integer and Applesoft files can be 
created and edited with the Basic editors in ROM, and binary files can be 
changed by various methods, depending on how they were created. 
Modification of text files, however, is not so straightforward. Many 
word processors will do the job, but they're expensive. Besides, a line- 
based text editor is better suited than a word processor for some 
applications. 

Edit, the program presented in this article, has been created to fill the 
need for an easy, inexpensive way to modify text files. It provides mech- 
anisms to alter the contents of text files, including the ability to add, de- 
lete, change, and move lines. 

Program Summary. The current version of Edit supports thirteen 
commands. The program is designed to allow other commands to be 
added, so Edit may be tailored to any user's application. 

Edit begins by asking the user for the input file name. The input file is 



indicates the beginning-of-file; and an E indicates the last line in the file 
(variable EOF%). 

Commands are input and interpreted in the parser portion of the 
program (lines 20000 through 22300). The parser reads in a command 
character string, interprets the string's meaning, and sets the relevant var- 
iables to their appropriate values. It then checks to see if the first charac- 
ter of the command line is a legal command. If it is, K2% takes on the apv 
propriate value; if there is an error, K2% is set to 0. 

Some commands need to be followed by a line number. The parser 
checks these commands to evaluate the numbers, or special symbols, fol- 
lowing the first character. This enables the program to set the variables 
FIRST and LAST appropriately. 

Program Detail. This article on Edit is meant to provide a useful util- 
ity, as well as to act as a learning tool. This section provides a detailed de- 
scription of what the code does. Although this program is written in Ap- 
plesoft Basic for an Apple II computer, it could be easily transported to 





Apple II's Executive Editor Gary isier 



the file that the user wants to change or examine. If the input file name is 
null — that is, if you hit return without typing a name — Edit will create a 
new text file. 

Next, the program asks for the output file name. The output file is 
where the edited text is stored. If the output file name is null, the edited 
text is stored in a file with the same name as the input file, and the input 
file is renamed with a .bak extension. Note that if both input and output 
file names are null, a new file is created and stored as Editdata.bak on 
drive 1. 

Both of these requests will be accompanied by a drive number re- 
quest if the computer thinks you have two disk drives. If you have only 
one drive and want to skip this input, change the value of DMAX% in 
line 180 to 1. 

Text from the input file is then read in by the program. Edit can store 
up to 1,000 lines of text, although this limit may be easily altered. A file 
of 1,000 records should be sufficient for most applications. To alter this 
limit, change the dim of array LINES (line 100) and the value of 
LMAX% (line 1 60). Edit will not allow the input data to cause free mem- 
ory to drop below 250 bytes. This limit may be changed by resetting the 
constant MMIN% (line 170). 

After data is read in by the program, Edit goes into a command loop. 
The prompt "command" indicates that the program is in this loop. 

It is very important to understand the following four variables to fol- 
low the program flow. FIRST is a variable specifying the first line on 
which to begin the edit command; LAST specifies the last line. The vari- 
able CRNT specifies the current line pointer. Finally, K2% is a parame- 
ter for internally identifying the edit command. Each command has a 
unique positive value for K2%; these are listed in lines 18 through 48 of 
the program. If K2% is 0, then some sort of error has occurred in the 
command line. 

Three special symbols may be used in place of any line number when 
you type in a command. A period signifies the current line (CRNT); a B 



other machines. The only machine-dependent features are those dealing 
with file input and output. 

Lines 2 through 50 of the code are identification and general com- 



ments.

Lines 100 through 190 specify certain program constants. Array 
CMD$ contains the command line; the length of command lines is spec- 
ified by variable CMAX%. The array LINES contains the lines of the 
text file; the maximum number of records that the program stores is in 



Apartments, condos, single honnes, 
taxpayer units, offices. Whatever type in- 
come property you have, the accounting 
and record keeping chores are compli- 
cated and time consuming. To handle 
them effectively and efficiently you need a 
professional manager. And that's exactly 
what The Property Manager is. 

Its capabilities are all-inclusive, yet ex- 
tremely easy to utilize. They cover com- 
plete tenant information, including move 
iris, lease data, payment status. Plus com- 



plete unit data from rental history to pend- 
ing vacancies. 

The Property Manager also handles the 
finances like a full time CPA. Everything 
from cash receipts/disbursements to ac- 
counts receivable, up to its own General 
Ledger system. It even writes checks and 
statements, prepares mailing labels and 
almost any type of report you desire.

Lines 240 through 290 deal with getting the name of the input text

If the input file is to be read in from disk, lines 440 through 480 will 
clear the screen and print an appropriate message. Lines 500 through 720 
deal with the actual reading of the input. Each character is read from 
disk and concatenated into a line. The line ends when a carriage return 
(CR$) is encountered. The variable EOF% demarks the last record of the 
file. After every ten lines of input, free memory is purged by line 560, 
since the character-by-character input aeates and discards a lot of strings. 
At the end of the file (line 700), the file is closed.

Lines 800 through 920 comprise the command loop. The asterisk 
prompt is printed, then the command is input and interpreted by the sub- 
routine at line 20000. The subroutine returns the variables K2%, FIRST, 
and LAST. K2% is the command number, FIRST is the first line on 
which this command is to act, and LAST is the final line this com- 
mand will afTect. If the value of any of these three variables is illegal, 
K2% is set to zero and an error message is printed. 

The valid values of K2% are 1 through 4, 10 through 12, and 18 
through 22. The K2% values are noncontiguous to allow easy addition of 
commands. K2% values 1 through 9 are reserved for commands with no 
arguments — those commands invoked by a single character only. Com- 
mands 10 through 19 are reserved for commands that will affect one line 
only. Commands 18 and 19 are used for commands dealing with strings. 
Finally, commands 20 through 29 are reserved for commands that will 
operate over a range of lines. These commands are entered as a com- 
mand character, optionally followed by a line number, optionally fol- 
lowed by a dash and another line number.

L'nes 5100 through 5500 perform the append (K2%=4) and insert 
(K2% = 10) commands. First, line 5110 checks to ensure that there is 
room in the file to add records. If there is no room available, the com- 
mand is aborted. Otherwise, the line pointer CRNT is set to the value of 
FIRST. The new lines are entered here character by character. Special 
checks are made for the backspace, which is used as a delete key; return, 
which signifies the end of a line of input; and control-Z, which sends you 
back to command mode. All other control characters are filtered out of 
the input. 

After a line is entered (that is, a CR$ is detected), the program has two 
choices. An append command adds lines to the end of file, in which case 
EOF% is incremented. An insert command causes all lines after the in- 
serted line to be pushed back in the file.

lines FIRST to LAST for the string SRCH$ of length SLNG%. Note 
that it is not necessary for the program to search any line that is shorter 
than the search string. If the string is not found, a message to that effect is 
printed. If it is found, a message is printed and, in a substitution, SRCHS 
is substituted on the line by the string SUBSS. This command then 
"fiows" into the type command, after adjusting the values of FIRST and 
LAST.

the beginning and end of the lines. After the printing of each line, line 
10080 checks for a keypress. This allows you to halt the listing with the

Lines 20000 through 22300 comprise the command line parser, which 
obtains commands and determines if they are valid. The array CMD$ 
stores the command line, while CLNG% is the length of the command 
line. First, lines 20060 through 20150 input a command line. Then hnes 
20200 through 20420 check the first character on the line to ensure its va- 
lidity. If the first character is a return, the next line number in the file or 
an [EOF] will be printed. If the first character is a minus sign, the pro- 
gram prints the prior line in the file or a [BOF] message if the pointer is 
at the beginning of the file. 

Commands that make it to line 20560 are those requiring a line num- 
ber — that is, most commands where K2% is greater than 9. If the line 
number is absent, a period, the symbol for the current line, is inserted in 
the command. The variable CP% is used to count which character in the 
command line we are looking at. The variable D% is the value of the 
number in the command line.

less than or equal to 1 2, then only one line is used. LAST is set to FIRST, 
and the program performs the appropriate function. If K2% is 18 or 19, 
the program moves on to get the string to search for, SRCHS. For com- 
mands greater than 19, the second line number for the range, namely 
LAST, is retrieved. Note that for commands that operate over a range of 
lines, only one line number must be given if the desired range is only a 
single line. (For example, to type line 12, the commands T12 and T12-12 
are both legal.)

Lines 22000 through 22300 deal with obtaining the strings used by 
the find and substitute commands. If only a single letter F or S has been 
given, we want to perform the appropriate command using the prior 
search and substitute strings. In the case of the find command, the search 
starts at the next line; in the case of substitute, the substitution search be- 
gins in the current line. This is because the search string may appear 
twice within the line, but the substitute command will only replace the 
first occurrence.

Lines 22100 through 22180 get the search string, SRCH$. First, the

string, SUBSS, must be obtained. If none is present, then an error mes- 
sage is printed. Otherwise, subroutine 24060 is called again, and the 
string that is returned is SUBSS. Note that the search string in the find 
command and the substitute string in the substitute command may be 
terminated by a carriage return; the string delimiter is not required at the 
end of the final string in these two commands.

Edit Commands. The following section briefly describes the Edit 
commands. A summary of these commands is listed at the end of this ar- 
ticle. Each command line is terminated by hitting the return key. Four of 
the commands are initiated by typing one character. To stop an edit ses- 
sion and not save the changes to the output file, use the Q (quit) com- 
mand. The user may wish to quit a session if a number of changes have 
been made to the file that are in error. To stop an edit session and save 
the changes to the output file, use the X (exit) command. Both quit and 
exit will verify that this is what the user really wants to do. 

When in doubt as to what the commands are, type ? or H for help in- 
formation. This will present a list of commands and options to the 
screen. Finally, to add new lines to the end of the file, use the A (append) 
command. The prompt "ENTER NEW LINES (^Z TO END):" wiU 
appear. Type in each new line, followed by hitting the return key. When 
you're done with the last new line (and the last return), hit a control-Z. 
(Control-Z is entered by hitting the Z key while holding down the con- 
trol key. Note that the symbol ^ Z is used in the program prompts to in- 
dicate control-Z.) Use the A command when initially creating a file or 
adding to the end of an existing file. 

The following commands require the one-character mnemonic, op- 
tionally followed by one number. This number is the line on which the 



One Apple

With the ECHO speech synthesizer from Street Electronics 
whatever you type on the keyboard, your computer can say. The 
echo's text-to-speech system gives your computer an 
unhmited vocabulary while using a minimum of memory. And 
now a diskette of fixed, natural sounding words is available 
to enhance the ECHO It's voice output. 

Nearly 400 language rules are contained in the ECHO'S 
text-to-speech algorithm. These rules enable the computer to 
pronounce most correctly spelled words. When in the text-to- 
speech mode the user can select any of 63 different pitch 
levels, and have words spoken either monotonically or with 
intonation by using simple control character sequences. The 
rate of speech can be fast or slow; words can be spoken in 
their entirety or spelled letter by letter. The ECHOs also 
pronounce punctuation and numbers. Words can be encoded 
using phonemes and diphthongs when the text-to-speech or 
fixed vocabulary is not required. 

Applications are unlimited, ranging from phone answering, 
educational and training programs, to games and aiding the 
sight and speech impaired. The ECHO is a complete stand 
alone unit which is compatible with most any computer; it sells 
for $299.95. The ECHO][, which plugs into the Apple ][, is 
priced at $149.95.

edit command action will be performed. FIRST and LAST will take on 
this value, as will the variable CRNT. If no number is supplied, the com- 
mand is performed on the current line. 

To insert new lines prior to a given line, use the I (insert) command. 
Typing in lines in insert is the same as in append; after all lines are en- 
tered, hit a control-Z. For example, to insert lines prior to line 5, use the 
command 15. The first new line will be the new line 5. To insert prior to 
the current line, use I without a line number. Note that after you insert 
lines, the file line numbering will be changed. 

To replace a line already in the text file, use the R (replace) com- 
mand. The replace command will type the old version of the line and 
prompt you to enter a new line. At this point, merely type in the replace- 
ment for the old line. If you're in replace by mistake, or if you wish to 
keep the old line and ignore the new one, hit a control-Z any time prior 
to hitting return. For example, to replace the last line in the file, use RE; 
to replace line 28, use R28. 

To set the current line pointer (CRNT) to a specific value, use the P 
(pointer) command. This is most useful in conjunction with moving and 
copying lines, which will be explained later. To set the current line point- 
er to line 12, type PI 2; to set it to the end of the file, type PE. 

There are times when the user wants to search a text file for a par- 
ticular character string. To do this, use the F (find) command. The form 
of the find command is F[«[i&^/]] (where items in brackets are optional). 
The line number n is the first line on which to start the search. The char- 
acter d can be any character not in the search string s, and acts as a string 
delimiter. Quotation marks make a good delimiter //there are none in the 
search string. The string j may run up to about forty-five characters. 
(The total length of a command line may not exceed fifty characters.) 
For example, to look for the string "TEXT" on or after line 12, enter the 
command F12$TEXT$; note that the $ was used as the dehmiter, but 
any character besides a number or T, E, or X would have been all right. 
To find the string "APPLE" on or after the current line, use 
F.#APPLE#. The command Fn will search for the most recently used 
search string on or after line «; the command F will look for the current 
search string on or after the current line. This is a good, easy way to con- 
dnue a search. If the string search is successful, the line where the string 
was found will be printed, and FIRST and CRNT will be set to that line. 
If the search is unsuccessful, a message is printed and the variables 
FIRST and CRNT are not affected. Note that if a search string is speci- 
fied, a line number must be used. 

The command for string substitution is similar to find in structure 
and function. After finding a string, the user may want to substitute it 
with another siring value. This is done by using the S (substitute) com- 
mand, of the form S[n[dslds2d]]. Thed represents a string delimiter, as in 
the find command listed previously. The S command will search for 
string si starting at line n and will substitute string s2 for si at the first oc- 
currence of si. For example, the command S12!ORANGE!APPLE! will 
search for the string "ORANGE" on or after line 12 and will replace it 
with the string "APPLE." The S command will then continue the pre- 
vious search/substitute operation at the next occurrence of the search 
string, while SI 8 will continue the search/ substitufion at line 18. Note 
that the line numbers is required if search and substitute strings are spec- 
ified. An error will occur if no search string is given. Upon successful 
substitution, the new line will be printed. If the substitution is not suc- 
cessful, a message to that effect will be printed. 

The following commands require the one-character mnemonic, op- 
tionally followed by a number n, optionally followed by a dash and a 
number m. These commands operate on one line or over many lines. If n 
and m are not specified, the command acts on the current line only. If 
only n is specified, the command affects only line «, and variables FIRST 
and LAST will both take on this value. If n and m are both specified, ac- 
tion affects all lines n through m, FIRST takes on the value n, and LAST 
takes on the value of m. 

To display a portion of the file to the screen, use the L (list) com- 
mand. For example, to list line 12 of the file, use LI 2; to list lines 82 
through 101, use L82-101; to list the entire file use LB-E or Ll-E. Hit- 
ting a space during a listing halts it. While the listing is stopped, another 
space lists the next line, return continues the listing, or escape aborts it. 



Hitting the return key in response to the command prompt will cause 
the next line in the file to be typed. The single-character dash will cause 
the previous line in the file to be typed. 

To delete a portion of the file, use the D (delete) command. For ex- 
ample, to delete lines 42 through 44, use D42-44; to delete line 158, use 
D158. Note that after you delete lines from the file, line numbering will 
be altered. 

To copy a portion of the file from one place to another, keeping the 
original lines where they are, use the C (copy) command. The copy com- 
mand will copy a range of lines to just prior to the current line pointer. 
Thus, this is a two-step operation; first, set the current line pointer, then 
copy the lines. For example, to copy lines 8 through 12 to precede line 55, 
use the command P55 followed by C8-12. The M (move) command is 
similar to copy, except that move moves a portion of the file and deletes 
the original lines. Note that copy and move will affect the file line num- 
bering. 

Applications. A text-file editor can be used as an accessory or utility 
to aid you in using any of a number of different programs that use text 
files to store data. As currently written, Edit can't handle lower-case or 
control characters except on a He. If your specific application requires 
these functions, they could be added by modifying the input routines be- 
ginning at 5100 and 5500. How this would be done varies, depending on 
whether your Apple has lower-case display and input or must suffice 
with inverse characters, shift-key mods, and escape keys. 

The primary use envisioned for Edit is the creation of what are of- 
ten called exec files. These are text files that contain a series of com- 
mands. They are distinguished from programs in a couple of ways. They 
don't have line numbers, subroutines, or labels, so there is no way to 
jump from one section of the file to another. They are not held in mem- 
ory all at once, so they can be quite long. But perhaps the most signifi- 
cant difference between an exec file and a program is that exec files are 
not limited to any one language. In fact, they can be used to issue com- 
mands to applications programs as easily as to DOS and Basic. 

Commands within an exec file are carried out exactly as if you had 
typed them at the keyboard. So they can be used, for instance, to load a 
Basic program, modify it by adding or deleting lines, run it, and then an- 
swer all of its input requests. They're especially effective for creating self- 
running demos. The exec command is, in short, an extremely powerful 
feature of DOS 3.3., but one that is not frequently used because it isn't 
easy enough to line-edit text files. It is hoped that Edit, in addition to its 
other potential uses, will open this door for you.

Wibbuildmore 
memory into you . 



The Einstein Corporation has created a 
powerful new tool to expand the powers of 
your memory. The Einstein MemoryTrainer. 
For the first time ever, human factors psycho- 
logy and personal computer technology have been combined to 
miake learning fun. 

Until now, memory-building techniques— usually taught in static 
courses and books— have been complicated and difficult to master. 
The interactive and dynamic features of the Einstein Memory- 
Trainer lead you (on your Applet Atari 800™ or Commodore 64™) 
through these techniques quickly effectively and with the genius 
of simplicity. 

A fully-structured tutorial with color graphics and game-like 
practice sessions gives you tools to remember an increasingly- 
challenging sequence of names, faces, phone numbers, dates, and 
lists. And it trains you to use these tools in everyday situations. 

You proceed at your own pace and level of capability. And you 
can store and practice your own personal memory techniques 
over and over again, as you develop them. 

Now achievement software has the fun of a game! 

There's never been a computer program like this since 
we can t remember when. ^j^g^^j^ MemoryTrainer"

This is supposed to be a column for beginners; the usual procedure is 
to give beginners a lot of background before letting them do anything. 
The problem with that approach is that, from the beginner's viewpoint, 
it's pretty boring. 

On the other hand, the legend of the Sorcerer's Apprentice tells you 
what can happen if you go too fast with something you don't really un- 
derstand. 

We'll try to steer a middle course. From time to time we will simply 
tell you to do something, without explaining it; but we will try to be fair 
and balance the scales by explaining some things you already know. 

Last month, we told you that the "brain" of the Apple, the micro- 
chip that tells the other chips what to do, is the microprocessor — some- 
times called the cpu (for central processing unit) or the 6502 (that's the 
manufacturer's part number for the chip). 

We also explained that assembly language for the Apple is simply the 
6502 instruction set (the instructions the chip can execute), translated in- 
to human symbols. Thus, an assembly language program is essentially a 
list of instructions for the microprocessor. 

Finally, we told you a little about memory, and somewhat less about 
input, output, and addressing. 

It will take at least three or four such articles before you begin to un- 
derstand assembly language programming; but you don't need to wait 
that long before doing it. We can give you a simple program, and a sim- 
ple way of entering it into memory, in this article. By playing with that, 
you can start learning to use assembly language. 

We'll want something very simple to start with, because there's more 
to assembly language programming than just writing the program. You 
also have to enter it into memory (unlike Basic, which does this for you 
automatically), and that means you have to know both how and where 
to enter it. 

The program does something you probably know how to do in Ba- 
sic: print a string. You can use this to insert a special message into a Ba- 
sic program — a beep, a snide comment, a line of asterisks, or what- 
ever — even though the message is not actually part of the Basic program 
and will not appear in its listing. 

From Basic to Assembly Language. For the message in our exam- 
ple, we will use a respectful greeting from the machine to its master 
"Hello, Boss!" Thus our program, written in Basic, would be 

10 PRINT "HELLO, BOSS!" 

The first thing we have to deal with, in translating this into assembly 
language, is that the microprocessor doesn't understand strings. It can 
take one character at a time and do something with it; but you (that is, 
your program) must tell it what to do each time. 

However, that's not as bad as it sounds; the 6502 happens to be very 
good with loops, and you can put the print-the-next-character instruc- 
tions in a loop. In Basic, that would give us 



Part 2: Hello, Boss 

However, there is one limitation of assembly language that we still 
have to deal with. The 6502 is good with loops but not quite as easy to 
use as Basic There is more housekeeping to do. Our Basic model of the 
assembly language program should look more like this: 



10 FOR X = 1 TO 12 

20 READ A$: PRINT A$; 

30 NEXT X 

40 DATA H,E,L,L,0,","," 



',B,0,S,S,! 



Note that the odd-looking quotes in line 40 are required by Basic in 
order to have the comma interpreted as data. This has nothing to do with 
assembly language. 



10 X = 0 

20 READ A$: PRINT A$; 

30 X = X+1 

40 IF X < 12 THEN 20 

50 DATA H,E,L,L,0,","," ",B,0,S,S,! 

Assembly Language Mnemonics. A mnemonic is a trick for remem- 
bering something. In this case, it means a mnemonic name, or labeL a 
three-letter code word that stands for a longer word or phrase. LDA, for 
example, is the mnemonic for load accumulator; a couple of others, 
for comparison, are LDX for load X register and STA for store 
accumulator. 

The accumulator (as mentioned in last month's column) is the main 
working area of the microprocessor. The 6502 operates on one byte at a 
time (a byte is a unit of information; for now, think of it as one character 
of the message), and the place where it works on that byte is the 
accumulator. 

Before you can work on a byte, you must load it into the 
accumulator: LDA. When you're through with the byte, you usually 
want to store it somewhere: STA. 

Actually, that's not the whole story. The accumulator is the main 
working area, but not the only one. There are two other working areas, 
the X and Y registers. You can load a byte into these registers, modify it, 
then store it someplace else, as you can with the accumulator. These reg- 
isters cannot do all the tricks the accumulator can; but there is one thing 
they do really well, and that thing is counting. 

We are going to need some counting in our program: Something is 
going to have to count the number of passes through the loop and stop 
the program when the count reaches 12. In Basic, we used the variable X; 
in assembly language, we will use the X register. 

Take a look at the Basic version and the assembly language listing of 
the program, shown at the end of this article. The first line in the Basic 
program says, in effect, "Preset the loop-counting variable to zero." In 
assembly language you say the same thing, except for one word "Preset 
the loop-counting register to zero." In other words, load a zero into the 
X register. LDX 0 at line 15 is the first instruction in our assembly 
language program. 

Line 20 in the Basic version actually consists of two statements: read 
A$ and print A$. You can't do that in assembly language; each state- 
ment must be a separate instruction to the microprocessor. And that's 
not all: Each of these tasks turns out to be considerably more complex in 
assembly language than in Basic. 

Assembly Language Statements. You see, the mnemonics described 
above are not complete statements. They represent only the first half of 
an instruction to the microprocessor. A mnemonic is the name of an op- 
eration, something to be done (in fact, another word for mnemonic is op- 
erator). You have to tell the processor not only what to do, but what to 
do it to. You have to specify both an operation and an object for that 
operation: in technical terms, both an operator and an operand. 

For example, in our first instruction, LDX 0, the operator is LDX 
(what to do: Load the X register) and the operand is 0 (what to load it 
with: zero).

Losing Your Head Over 
Assembly Language? 




"The distance is nothing; it is only the first step that is 
difficult." 

So wrote Mme. du Deffand in a letter written over two 
hundred years ago. Mnne. du Deffand was commenting on 
the legend that Saint Denis, carrying his head in his 
hands, walked two leagues. 

If you've often felt that 6502 assembly language pro- 
gramming is a little like trying to walk around with your 
head in your hands, then you need help— specifically, 
Assembly Lines: The Book by Roger Wagner. 

For the novice assembly language programmer, Wag- 
ner's book starts with the basics and works up to more 
sophisticated routines. It makes a good companion volume 
for those of you exploring Jock Root's new Everyone's 
Guide to Assembly Language column, which started in 
Softalk in the July issue. 

Assembly Lines: Tfie Book consists of the first fifteen 
installments— October 1980 to December 1981— of 
Wagner's Assembly Lines column in Softalk. The columns 
have been expanded and joined by an introduction and sev- 
eral appendixes. 

Assembly Lines: The Book costs $19.95 (plus $1.50 
postage and handling if you order direct from Softalk) and 
is available in many fine computer stores around the 
country. 

Remember, the first steps in your journey through as- 
sembly language programming can be easy with Roger 
Wagner's Assembly Lines: The Book.

This is a simple form (which is why we used it for the first line of our 
program), but it is not the usual form. In LDX 0, the operand is a num- 
ber, which is to be used immediately; it will be loaded into the X register 
just as it is. The operand itself is the subject of the operation — and that is 
unusual. 

In its more usual form, the operand is an address, specifying a place 
in memory where the number we really want is stored. In this form, the 
subject of the operation is the byte stored in the location specified by the 
operand. 

Thus, an assembly language instruction usually consists of a mne- 
monic and an address; except that in immediate mode addressing, as in 
our LDX 0, the "address" is not really an address at all, but instead is the 
byte we want — right there, immediately. 

Immediate mode addressing requires a special format; LDX 0 is 
actually wrong. That would get us the value that is currently stored in 
memory location number zero. What we have to say is LDX #0 — which 
will load the byte that immediately follows the # symbol into the X 
register. 

Addresses. This is a hairy topic and we aren't going to go deeply in- 
to it today. One of these months we'll do a whole column on it; but for 
now, if you want more details, see the article "The Handy & Hook" in 
last month's issue. 

We are talking, of course, about addresses in memory — RAM, or 
read/write memory, to be specific. This part of memory is the Apple's 
notebook for the job it's doing at the moment, and more — blackboard, 
notebook, file cabinet, and library would about cover it. Read/write 
memory is a busy and important place. 

It's also big. On a 48K Apple, there are more than forty-eight thou- 
sand memory locations, each of which can store one byte (that is, one 
character of a string, one digit of a number, and so on). 

As you can see, we'll need a good way to keep track of where we put 
things in this memory area. 

You can think of memory as a giant array of mailboxes, each of 
which can hold exactly one byte of information and each of which has its 
own unique address. You can read the byte that's in a particular mail- 
box with LDA and the address of that mailbox. This will copy the ad- 
dressed byte into the accumulator. Or you can copy a byte from the ac- 
cumulator into a mailbox — that is, store it in that mailbox — with STA 
and the mailbox's address. 

That explanation leaves a lot out. For one thing, the addresses usual- 
ly have to be in the hexadecimal number system, which is another topic 
in itself. Nevertheless, let's leave it at that for now. One address can store 
one byte, and that byte can be read or written over (note that if you write 
to a mailbox you destroy whatever was there before). 

If you're still puzzled, here's another way to look at it. Each memory 
address represents a variable, like the variables in Basic, except that these 
variables can hold only certain kinds of values (like integer variables, 
only more so). One byte of memory — one mailbox — can hold a single 
character or a small number; if you want to put more than that in your 
variable, use a string of mailboxes, side by side. That's how we're going 
to store the message "Hello Boss!" for example. 

Indexed Addressing. Now that you've mastered the immediate mode 
of addressing (in which the operand itself is the desired byte) and the sim- 
ple mode (in which the operand is the address oi desired byte, techni- 
cally known as the absolute mode), it's time to deal with something a bit 
tricky: indexed addressing. 

The X and Y registers are designed to be used as index registers — 
that's why they're so good at counting. Indexing your way through a list 
means pointing out each item in the list, one after another (as you might 
do with your index finger), and that's what these registers are for. 

The hardware of the 6502 — the silicon switching circuits inside the 
chip — can add the contents of one of these registers to an address before 
it uses the address. This is called indexed addressing. 

Here's how it works. We're using the X register as a loop counter, so 
it has a different value on each pass through the loop. If we use those 
same values to index the address of an LDA instruction, we can read 
from a different memory location on each pass through the loop. 

And that is how we're going to load the message, "Hello, Boss!" The 
assembly language instruction, line 16, is LDA MSG,X, in which MSG

is a label for the address at which the first character of the message is 
stored. 

The next line of our program is a short-cut JSR COUT. COUT is an 
Apple Monitor routine that outputs the character in the accumulator to 
the currently active output device, thus saving us the trouble. We simply 
call this routine on each pass through the loop after we've read the de- 
sired character into the accumulator. JSR is assembly language for go- 
sub — we'll have more on that another day. 

Next, the X-register-as-counter does another trick for us. INX is the 
mnemonic for increment X, meaning add one to theX register. This is a 
complete instruction, one of the reasons X is so good at counting (there is 
also a DEX instruction, for counting backward; and the Y register has a 
similar pair). Note that these are among the few instructions that do not 
require an operand. 

Finally, hne 19 compares the current value of X to 12(remember, the 
# means that 12 is the desired value, not the address of the desired value), 
and line 20 repeats the loop if X is not big enough yet. BCC is short for 
branch if carry is clear, and that's another thing we'll have to explain 
some other time. 

Line 21 sends you back to the calling program — RTS is assembly 
language for return. 

Then there's a BRK statement at line 22. The Apple will never see 
this as part of the program, because of the RTS just ahead of it; so we 
can use it as a reference point to separate program from message. It will 
show up as a zero byte in the machine code, so we can find it easily. 

And finally we have the message. It's in high-bit ASCII — Apple 
ASCII codes, but with the high bit set. If that sounds like gibberish, take 
the normal (decimal) ASCII value of a character and add 128 to it. 

User Notes. So how do you use it? Well, first you have to enter it. 
The numbers on the right side of the listing are in decimal — these are the 
ones you want. You have to poke them into successive locations in mem- 
ory, starting at 768 as indicated in line 12. The ORG mnemonic in that 
line is a command to the assembler — not the microprocessor — to start 
the program at the specified location. It is short for origin. The numbers 
beneath 768 (the ORG address) on the right-hand side are the decimal 
equivalents of the hex numbers on the far left. These decimal numbers 
are the ones to poke in, one number to each location. So, in Basic poke 
768,162: poke 769,0: poke 770,189, and so on. 

After that, type call 768 and the Apple will greet you with "Hello, 
Boss!" It works equally well from within a program: The hello program 
on one of your disks, for example.

Two hundred years ago, in 1783, a new sort of society 
and a new sort of state came into being. 

"It was like something coming out of an egg," writes 
H.G. Wells in The Outline of History. "It was a western 
European civilization that had broken free from the last 
traces of Empire and Christendom; it had not a vestige of 

monarchy left and no state religion Even its unity was as 

yet a mere unity for defense and freedom. It was in these 
respects such a clean start in political organization as the 
world had not seen before." 

The new society and state was the young United States 
of America, which officially ceased fighting with Great 
Britain on April 19, 1783. Two hundred years later the United 
States is again the site of a struggle to reshape the world we 
live in. America has been an industrial and agricultural 
society for most of its two hundred-plus years, but that is 
now changing. 

With the help of computers, big and small, we are 
entering the information age— a society that depends more 
on the exchange of knowledge than physical goods. In the 
coming decades we just might eliminate all mind-numbing, 
backbreaking work and improve the quality of life for those 
ready to embrace the computer revolution. 

Softaik is dedicated to making the shift to the informa- 
tion age as smooth as possible. We recognize and under- 
stand the needs of those who are taking the gamble of 
buying a personal computer. The Apple is a wonderful 
machine, but it's only as smart as its owner.

T a y I o 

Exploring Business Basic, Part 23 

Last month we undertook a challenge to use 
the flexibility of the soft (programmable) char- 
acter set of the Apple III to do something us- 
ually reserved for systems using bit-mapped 
graphics displays. A cursor that actually lives 
between two adjacent screen characters tells us 
exactly where a typed character would be 
inserted. 

The example was borrowed from the Sys- 
tem Utilities program, where this insert mode 
cursor is used in the input fields. Some other 
Pascal programs use this technique, but it 
turned out that it was fairly easy to implement 
in Basic as well (yay, Basic!). However, the way 
things were done last time was somewhat dif- 
ferent from the Utilities implementation, and so 
the article concluded with some challenges to 
make the routine better and more useful in 
data-entry programs, as well as more like the 
way things work in Utilities. Shame on this col- 
umn! This month's episode revisits the pro- 
gram and the previous column's parting chal- 
lenges and delivers a more robust and useful 
version. For those of you who undertook to 
solve the problems raised last time, this will 
serve as a check on one way (not necessarily the 
best) to attack the solution. 

Quick as a Wink. Just to refresh your mem- 
ory, the way we attacked the problem of put- 
ting a cursor between two characters was to cre- 
ate two new sets of character-set definitions in 
which each character was moved to the left or 
right one pixel within the character cell (since 
most characters occupy five-by-seven dots with- 
in a seven-by-eight cell). A vertical row of dots 
was put into the vacant space left by shifting the 
character. By redefining two adjacent charac- 
ters on the screen with left-shifted and right- 
shifted versions, we created two standard char- 
acters with a double-width bar between them, in- 
dicating where the character typed would go. 
To make things clearer, the bottom row of 
pixels was turned on as well, in the space nor- 
mally occupied by the descenders of lower-case 
characters. 

While this was a good first pass, the System 
Utilities program does several other things that 
make the input system easier to use and more 



r P 

legible. First, to draw attention to the cursor po- 
sition, the program flashes the underline below 
the two characters, instead of leaving it con- 
stantly on. Secondly, the program handles the 
problem of the flashing underline destroying 
lower-case descenders by physically moving the 
character up one row so that the descenders 
are preserved. It can do this because only five 
lower-case characters have descenders (g, j, p, q, 
y) and in each case the character can be moved 
up without losing its appearance. Granted, the j 
loses its top dot, but life is like that. 

In the following program, we'll first tackle 
the problem of making the underline "wink" 
(rhymes with blink) at us, and then look at a 
method of shifting up the five lower-case char- 
acters. To get the blinking underline, it's neces- 
sary to remember that the high-order bit in a 
character definition (the leftmost or most sig- 
nificant bit, some people would say) is used to 
control blinking for that line of pixels in the 
character cell, but only if the character is writ- 
ten in inverse mode. This means that you can 
have normal mode and either inverse or blink- 
ing, but not both. 

Programming Inverse. The preceding in- 
formation suggests a simple solution, namely to 
set the high-order bit of the last row of the cur- 
sor character definitions and print them in in- 
verse mode. However, since we must print the 
whole character in inverse for the top seven 
rows to come out normally, it is necessary to 
create an inverse (black-on-white) character 
definition, which, when printed in inverse, will 
result in the normal white pixels on black. For- 
tunately, as we will see, inverting the character 
definition is much simpler than shifting it. 
Those of you with exceptional memories (or ex- 
ceptional faithfulness to this column) will re- 
member that this technique was covered when 
we created the character and shape editor in the 
February episode. Then, as now, the way to in- 
vert a bit pattern is to subtract it from a bit pat- 
tern of all ones. Thus: 

1111111 1111111 
-1001101 -0011101 



0110010 1100010 
In decimal, it's as simple as subtracting the val- 



o h I m a n 

ue from 127, 255, or any other number that is 
all ones in binary. 

Dividing Up the Work. One of the other 
challenges from last time was to divide the pro- 
gram into two parts, one that created the shift- 
ed (and now inverted) characters and the field 
definitions, the other of which used the charac- 
ter definitions to do data entry into the fields. 
The major reason for this division of labor was 
to avoid spending the time inverting and shift- 
ing the characters each time the data-entry pro- 
gram was run. Also, by building files of shifted 
character definitions, field names and specifica- 
tions, it would be possible to use the same data- 
entry program to enter many different sets of 
data, depending on which definition file the da- 
ta-entry program used. This is much more the 
way that real applications are built. 

Since the details of the character-shifting 
process were fully described last time, the de- 
scription of the following program will just note 
changes from the previous version: 

10 DIM highr%(15),lowr%(15), 

carryr%(15),highl%(15),lowl%(15), 

carryl%(15) 
15 DIM lchar$(127),rchar$(127), 

sleft%(255),sright%(255),char%(5 1 1 ) 
20 DIM flname$(20),vert%(20),horz%(20), 

fstar1%(20),fenci%(20) 
30 IN VOKE'Vbasic/request.inv", "/basic/ 

download. inv" 
35 PRINT"lnitializing values, please wait" 
40 GOSUB 4000 
45 GOSUB 6000 

This section uses the same routines at lines 
4000 and 6000 to build the character definitions 
and field descriptions, but this time, instead of 
using these definitions immediately, the follow- 
ing program section writes this information out 
to a definition storage file: 

50 INPUT"Storage file: ";a$ 

60 IF a$ = - THEN 500 

70 0PEN#1,a$ 

80 PERFORM filwrite(%1 ,@ctiarset$, 

%1024)

100 FOR i = 0 TO 127 
110 WRITE#1;lchar$(i),rchar$(i) 
120 NEXT i 

130 WRITE#1,20:max.field+ 1

FOR i = 0 TO max. field 
WRITE#1;flname$(i),vert%(i), 
horz%(i),fstart%(i),fend%(i) 
NEXT i 

PRINT"lnformalion stored." 



Line 80 writes out the character set that cor- 
responds to the shifted definitions in IcharS and 
rcharS. This ensures that the data-entry pro- 
gram will use consistent definitions for regular 
characters and redefined ones, no matter what 
font is selected in this program. After the char- 
acter set is written out, the shifted definitions 
are written in lines 90 through 120. Note that 
the pathname of the original font is written for 
reference. In lines 130 through 160, then, field 
name definitions are written, along with the dis- 
play location and length information. At that 
point this program is finished: 

500 REM end of program 
510 CLOSE:INVOKE 
520 END 

Most of the routine at line 4000, which builds 
the shifted character definitions, is the same as 
before. It is repeated so that you can re-create 
the whole program.

Notice in lines 4440, 4450, 4480, and 4490 
that the value of the individual row definition is 
first subtracted from 127 to form the inverse of 
the regular value. We use 127 (seven bits of 
ones) because we want the high-order (flash) bit 
to be left off on all rows but the bottom. The 
bottom row left is handled in line 4480, where 
subtracting from 256 not only inverts the bot- 
tom seven bits (the character's pixel definition) 
and inverts (turns on) the flash bit, but also 
(255 -HI) turns on the low-order bit to be consis- 
tent with the state of the other bits (remember

that sleft% forces the low-order bit to one for 
the cursor center line, and the invert operation 
performed by the subtraction turns it back ofO- 
Line 4490 performs a similar operation, except 
this time we must subtract from 319 (255+64), 
which has the effect of inverting all the bits and 
then turning the bit next to the flash (high-or- 
der) bit on. Trust it. it works! 

The rest of the routine is very similar to the 
version from last time: 

5000 PRINT prompt$;:INPUT"";a$ 

5010 IF a$ = "" THEN error= 1:RETURN 

5020 error=0:RETURN

Descending Ever Upward. As was men- 
tioned before, it is possible to modify the char- 
acter shifting and inversion routine to more 
nearly match how the System Utilities program 
behaves. The following lines, when added to the 
preceding program, will move the definitions of 
the characters g,j, p, q, and y up one row of pix- 
els so that a blinking underline can be used 
without distorting the character appearance. 
This has the disadvantage of making the char-

acter appear to bounce up when the cursor 
moves over it, but it's purely a matter of per- 
sonal taste. The best way is to make the modifi- 
cations and try creating both kinds of defini- 
tions. Use the one that makes the most sense to 
you. Anyway, here are the changes: 

4432 IF k < 103 or j > 0 THEN 4440 

4433 IF k <> 103 AND k <> 106 AND k 
<> 112 AND k <> 113 AND k <> 
121 THEN 4440 

4435 lchar$(k)=CHR$(127-sleft% 
(r)):rchar$(k) 

=CHR$(127-sright%(r)):GOTO 4460 

4472 IF k< 103 THEN 4480 

4473 IF k <> 103 AND k ,<> 106 AND k 
<> 112AND k <> 113 AND k <> 
121 THEN 4480 

4475 lchar$(k)=lchar$(k) + 
CHR$(127-sleft%(l)) + 
GHR${127-sleft%(r)) + CHR$(255) 

4478 rchar$(k) = rchar$(k) + 
CHR${127-sright%(l)) + 
CHR$(127-sright%(r)) + CHR$(255) 

4479 GOTO 4500 

As you can see, it works by skipping the 
loading of the top row (line 4435) and adds an 
extra row (now the new bottom row), which 
consists of just a solid flashing line: the 
chr$(255) in lines 4475 and 4478. 

Spreading the Word. Having created and 
stored the character definitions and the data-en- 
try definitions, it's time for the data-entry pro- 
gram, which takes advantage of all this work. 
Because the next program follows almost exact- 
ly the program from last time (in the way it dis- 
plays the fields and accepts data), only the 
changed portions will be described in detail

This routine reverses the process used to 
originally write the file and stores the informa- 
tion used by the data-entry routine in the ap- 
propriate arrays. 

Glancing back up to the rest of the routine 
in lines 80 through 90, we now allow a file to be 
opened to store the data that will be input. The 
example used here is a simple one, and typical- 
ly would have lots more complications, like cre- 
ating keys and writing out data into a database 
structure, and so on. But for now the example 
given simplifies the issues. Notice that the de- 
fault is the screen (.console), giving a con- 
venient way to test that the data we see is really 
the data that was accepted as input. 

Next we come to the input routine itself, 
which was heavily described last time. It ba- 
sically cycles through all the fields and accepts 
data while displaying the "insert mode" cursor 
created by the new character definitions.

Notice that in lines 585, 620, and 780 we 
now turn on inverse mode, print the cursor 
characters, and then turn normal back on. This, 
in combination with the high bit "on" in the 
character's bottom row, creates the flashing un- 
derline we want. After all the fields are filled (re- 
member that tab gets us to the next field and es- 
cape jumps out of input mode), we write out the 
results in the storage file:

The routine from lines 1005 to 1015 prob- 
ably needs to be much more complicated to be 
useful. After prompting to see if there are more 
records to be entered, line 1040 either takes the 
user back for more input or terminates using the 
next routine.

Lines 2000 through 2030 load the standard 
character set back using getfont and loadfont 
and then terminate the program. 

Exiting Data Entry. The data-entry pro- 
gram, with its nice field-handling capabilities, 
can be the basis for lots of applications. Be- 
cause the definition of the data to be entered is 
stored separately from the data-entry program 
itself, one program can truly serve many needs. 
This is much more characteristic of the way real 
database query and update programs work, 
with one piece of program code operating on 
lots of different database definitions. One thing 
that would make this combination much more 
useful would be modifying the definition pro- 
gram to allow the input and editing of the field 
definitions, rather than having to type them in- 
to data statements. You might even want to 
store the field definitions in separate files, since 
one set of character definitions would serve 
many different sets of fields and would save 
considerable disk space as well.

ROBOTS AND ALJIDlVL^nON CHALLENGE 
OUR ABILITIES TO GROW AND ADAPT 



"You will be happy, sir," the mechanical 
promised him cheerfully. ' ' We have learned how 
to make all men happy, under the Prime Direc- 
tive. Our service is perfect, at last. Even Mr. 
Sledge is very happy now." 

Underhill tried to speak, and his dry throat 
stuck. He felt ill. The world turned dim and 
gray. The humanoids were perfect — no ques- 
tion of that. They had even learned to lie, to se- 
cure the contentment of men. 
— "With Folded Hands" by Jack Williamson 

Science-fiction writers have long been ex- 
ploring the good and bad aspects of a future 
mechanized society, where robots and autom- 
atons do most of the work and humans do 
what they please. 



In Jack Williamson's classic 1953 short 
story, "With Folded Hands," a brilliant scien- 
tist creates a race of perfect humanoids pro- 
grammed to follow the Prime Directive — "to 
serve and obey, and guard men from harm." 
The scientist's plan goes disastrously awry 
when the humanoids start implementing the 
Prime Directive too literally. 

Virtually all activities are eventually 
deemed too dangerous for humans and the ro- 
bots gently insist on having their way. Hu- 
mans become "pampered prisoners" in a 
"highly efficient jail." Purpose and hope die, 
replaced by a sense of "utter futility." The ro- 
bots go so far as to alter the minds of those 
who cannot accept the new "way of life,

IBM BUYS 
STOCK FOR 
THE FUTURE 

Always unpredictable, on the leading edge 
of technology and business strategies. Inter- 
national Business Machines bucked the buy- 
out and merger trends of 1982 when it bought 
minority shares in two high-technology com- 
panies earlier this year. 

A month and a half ago, Armonk, New 
York-based IBM bought 15 percent of Rolm 
Corporation, a Silicon Valley-based manufac- 
turer of business telephone switching systems. 
In February, IBM bought 12 percent of Intel 
Corporation, the semiconductor and micro- 
processor company whose chips IBM buys by 
the railroad carload. The price of the two pur- 
chases came to slightly less than $500 million. 

Considering the buy-out trend of 1982, 
many wondered why IBM didn't take the big 
plunge — Intel, Rolm, and the antitrust laws 
willing — and purchase the two companies out- 
right. With $35 billion in yearly sales, the com- 
puter giant could have afforded it. 

In both cases, a full takeover was not con- 
sidered by either party. Independence, not 
antitrust, was the primary reason for this 
strategy. IBM doesn't want to stifle or have 
too much influence on the motivation driving 
two such important independent suppliers as 
Intel and Rolm. Future profits are at stake. 

Intel needed capital to keep up the pace of 
its research spending. Making the company a 
division of IBM — captive to a single cus- 
tomer — ^would have ended Intel's competifive 
service to a demanding marketplace. As they 
say, "Domesticated animals sleep a lot." 

Internally, IBM showed an understand- 
ing of the problem when it set up Internation- 
al Business Units (IBUs) two years ago. The 
IBUs are identical in every way to a start-up 
company — formed and staffed by entrepre- 
neurially minded people who decide whether 
to go outside IBM for parts or service or use 
the company's own facilifies. There are now 
twelve IBUs, taking IBM into such diverse 
fields as medical electronics and robotics. 

IBM's coming head-on clash with AT&T 
motivated the Rolm buy-in. Rolm has in- 
stalled twelve thousand switchboard systems 
in the United States — second only to AT&T, 
which is freeing itself from public-utility status 
in order to compete with IBM in the boom- 
ing data communications industry. Fast-grow- 
ing Rolm sought out IBM, seeing the possi- 
bility of the two being able to jointly displace 
AT&T in the so-called office of the future. 

The decentralized buy-in strategy of IBM 
may be a solution to a recognized problem of 
U.S. business — how to marry the innovative- 
ness of small companies with the financial, 
marketing, and manufacturing muscle of large 
corporations. DH

VIDEODISC GAMES TO HIT 
THE ARCADES THIS SUMMER 



Get ready for a whole new gaming expe- 
rience — interactive "minimovies." The first of 
these videodisc-video game hybrids should 
hit arcades sometime in midsummer, with 
home versions expected to follow in about a 
year. The latest attempt to boost the slump- 
ing game industry, interactive minimovies will 
combine the usual computer-generated game 
character, such as a spaceship or warrior, with 
live-action or animated backgrounds stored 
on a laser disc. 

Several Hollywood film companies — 
Paramount, MCA-Universal, Don Bluth Pro- 
ductions, Columbia, Warner Bros., and Lu- 
casfilm — hope to cash in on the multibillion- 
dollar gaming business, providing the ingredi- 
ent they offer best movies. The minimovie en- 
ables the production of superior graphics and 
increased story possibilities, as well as better 
advanced tie-ins between video games and 
theatrical films. 

According to a spokesperson at Para- 
mount, who has struck up a partnership with 
Sega, the added visual reality that comes from 
using videodiscs could even lead to the pre- 
production planning of footage for use in both 
the movie and the tie-in game. 

Some game executives see the arcade own- 
er becoming comparable to the theater ex- 
hibitor who books a film every week. The ar- 
cade owner would simply change the mini- 
movie disc on the videodisc machine hidden 
inside the coin-op cabinet. "Coming soon" and 
"now playing" signs could even be attached to 
the sides, the games becoming, in effect, ancil- 
lary movie houses. 

But is the price right? The willingness of 
kids to deposit fifty cents into the machines 
and the initial investment by arcade owners 
into the videodisc equipment will obviously 
be determining factors in the box-office suc- 
cess of these minimovies. 

Testing of the minimovie coin-ops has al- 
ready begun in some cities. The Yellow Brick 
Road Arcade in San Diego, California, is cur- 



rently previewing the Sega/ Paramount laser- 
disc game Astron Bell. Developed by a Japa- 
nese firm, the game is reportedly doing "ex- 
tremely well," having already scored a major 
success in Japanese and European arcades. 
Kids are lining up in droves just waiting to de- 
posit their two tokens. Astron Belt features a 
computer-generated spaceship flying against a 
special-effects-created space background origi- 
nally imaged on film stock. 

According to Brenda Mutchnick of Sega 
Games, "We hope to release a few new games 
of this type by the end of the year. We don't 
know if Astron Belt wall be one of them. Even 
though it's scored a major success in Japan, 
when we got a look at the game here we didn't 
feel the game play was as good as that of cur- 
rent home computer games. We are now re- 
designing the cabinet itself and are awaiting 
future software developments with our own 
titles." 

Don Bluth Productions will unveil an in- 
teractive coin-op game — Dragon's Lair — 
sometime this summer. Created by Bluth and 
Advanced Microcomputer Systems (AMS), 
the new game will be marketed to arcades un- 
der the Starcom banner. The head of AMS, 
Rick Dyer, began developing the technology 
for Dragons Lair some years ago.

Showgirls, Splash, Finesse, Not Much Else 

Summer CES Wows the Crowd 
With Glitter and Big Talk 

The second in a series of unintentional 
ironies is over. The seventeenth year of the 
Consumer Electronics Show (CES), held at 
Chicago's McCormick Place this past June 8, 
ended without a great deal of fanfare — amidst 
rumors of disappointing attendance. As with 
the Las Vegas CES in January, the emphasis 
in Chicago was on merchandising, with micro- 
computer software showing strength, if not 
originality. 

CES is a trade show, closed to the idle 
consumer or child, although plenty of both 
were evident. It is meant to be a showcase for 
new products in the electronics industry, and a 
place where vendors and dealers can meet and 
hash out mutually beneficial arrangements. 
This year, for the first time, software was in 
such abundance that a separate building was 
devoted to computers and related products. 

The talk of the show was the new Coleco 
computer, the Adam. This self-contained 
"family computer system" comes with key- 
board, 80K of RAM, letter-quality printer, 
and a "digital data drive." The magnetic tape 
drive stores half a megabyte, and Coleco 
claims it has transfer speeds comparable to 
those a floppy disk drive can achieve. Demos 
that ran constantly asserted that the new com- 
puter was capable, figuratively speaking, of 
leaping tall buildings in a single bound, but 
the salespeople in the booth seemed reluctant 
to discuss particulars. 

Atari also had some new machines to 
show: the 600XL, 800XL, 1400XL, and 
1450XL. These are all new, slim machines — in 
varying configurations ranging from 16K 
RAM to 64K RAM — complete with the long- 
awaited new disk drives and lots of periph- 
erals. The new lineup is intended to replace the 
current crop of Atari micros and to be fully 
compatible with existing software. Also an- 
nounced by Atari at CES was the launching of 
software endeavors for machines other than 
their own, including products for Apple, IBM, 
and Commodore computers. 

Among the more eye-catching exhibits at 
CES was the new Datamost booth — in a car- 
nival-tent setting with an atmosphere to 
match. Featuring Captain Sticky, a Real Peo- 
ple refugee, and a swarm of scantily clad host- 
esses, the booth attracted large numbers of 
viewers who seemed to pay little or no atten- 
tion to the products being displayed. While 
the sideshow was amusing, it also was a sad 
commentarj' on the show in general — some- 
times little emphasis was placed on the prod- 
ucts for sale, while a good deal of money was 
spent on attracting attention. 

A different side of the same coin was ap- 
parent in the presence of newcomer Elec- 
tronic Arts, a software firm composed of for- 
mer employees of Apple, Atari, and other 



microcomputer companies. At the Elec- 
tronic Arts booth, marketing and product 
seemed to go hand in hand. The quality of 
wares seemed uniformly solid, while the mar- 
keting was innovative without being over- 
bearing. Electronic Arts seems to have taken 
its cue from the record industry and is work- 
ing to make stars of its authors, as well as 
turning stars in other fields into authors of 
software. The current crop of authors in- 
cludes Bill Budge, Dan Bunten (of Cytron 
Masters fame), Mike Abbott and Matt Alex- 
ander (formerly of Cavaber Computing), and 
a number of other familiar faces. Equally in- 
triguing is Electronic Arts's upcoming crop of 
new authors, including cartoonist Gahan Wil- 
son and a couple of giants from the NBA — 
Larry Byrd and Julius Erving. No kidding! 

One of the more interesting pitches came 
from Romox Corporation, marketers of a 
new point of sales approach for video game 
sellers: The Terminal. This device allows 
dealers to download software onto repro- 
grammable cartridges. Romox claims this will 
take care of the inventory control demon that 
plagues dealers who have a tendency to over- 
stock video games. Of greater interest will be 
the software that is to be downloaded.

TG Products unveiled some new game 
software for the Atari computers, along with 
some new paddles. Wico had a prototype 
mouse attached to an Apple and was busy try- 
ing to convince onlookers that the hardware 
was responsible for tricks performed by the 
software that was running. Activision was giv- 
ing sneak previews of its Atari microcom- 
puter games. Twentieth Century-Fox was pur- 
suing the movie-to-video game chimera with 
its Porky's games. Epyx passed out canvas 
painter's hats. 

Broderbund exhibited several new games, 
including Lode Runner, which might well have 
been the best of the show. Synapse also 
showed several new titles, as did Sirius. Data- 
soft showed off its new crop of low-priced 
software, the Gentry line, along with Zaxxon 
on the Atari and Apple. 

In short, there were a lot of familiar faces, 
companies that have moved away from the 
Applefests and other consumer shows and 
have taken their place in the mainstream mar- 
ketplace alongside firms like Mattel, Parker 
Brothers, CBS, Fox, Coleco, Imagic, Activi- 
sion, Atari, and others. 

Amidst all the hype and merchandising, 
the software seemed to stand still. There was 
nothing truly original or exciting at the show, 
or at least nothing that was out in plairi sight. 
The primary topic of conversation among 
reps, publishers, dealers, and distributors was 
the "software glut." The proliferation of ti- 
tles, all variations of several familiar and time- 
worn themes, refused to shine.

thereby ensuring that everyone is "happy." 

An extreme forecast, to be sure. But Wil- 
liamson's story brings into focus issues that 
our species must address if it plans to con- 
tinue automating the workplace. What hap- 
pens to a worker who is suddenly replaced by 
a machine? What happens to the twenty-year 
vet of an assembly line who must either 



over and increases production, there will be a 
need for more office personnel and workers to 
maintain the automatic machinery. Both 
labor unions and industry leaders have agreed 
that retraining is one possible option. But will 
retraining work on the human level? 

For twenty years, Johnny Detroit worked in 
an auto plant physically attaching windshields 
to hundreds of cars a day. In 1992, his job was 
taken over by a new, sophisticated automaton 
that could do the job faster and more accu- 
rately. Johnny Detroit was first offered a job on 
the maintenance and programming crew of the 
plant. He spat at the offer. ' 'I'm not becoming a 
nursemaid for some damn robot," he said. 




Attendees at IneRobot '83— held June 14-16 in Long Beach, California— take a look at future 
mechanical workers. The robot market is currently sluggish, but the technology continues to 
advance. The next twenty years will see robots steadily replacing factory workers in our heavy 
industries. But not all robots will replace humans on the job. Below, Positech Corporation's Taurus 
heavy-duty positioning arm is a robotic device operated by a human, allowing the easy positioning 
of objects weighing from 200 to 1,000 pounds. 



change jobs or become little better than a par- 
asite feeding on society — with no pride and no 
direction in life? 

In the future, more and more factory 
workers will be replaced by machines. No one 
seriously contemplates doing this all at once. 
Robotics technology is steadily progressing, 
but humans are still infinitely preferable to 
machines in most cases. There are only twenty 
to thirty thousand robots currently in use in 
this country. That will change, though. 

The economy and the job market are 
changing, as they always have. Society and 
people changed a hundred years ago, when 
the shift from an agricultural-based economy 
to an industrial-based economy went into full 
swing. Now we are shifting toward an infor- 
mation-based economy. Our heavy industries 
are in decline and automation is perceived as 
the best way to salvage some form of com- 
petitive edge. 

Robots and automation hold great prom- 
ise. There are many, many jobs — despite pop- 
ular romanticized notions — that wear down, 
demean, and generally diminish human 
beings. But in the short run — the next twenty 
to thirty years — the amount of people dis- 
placed by robots poses a difficult problem: 
what to do with the unemployed workers. 

The party line on displacing workers 
through automation calls for retraining those 
who are affected. Surely, as automation takes 



So Johnny took a job in the data processing 
department. Thirty-five hours a week he sat in 
front of a computer terminal doing mindless, 
back-numbing, unchallenging work. Sure, a 
wage is a wage. But Johnny now had a "soft" 
job. A victim of habit and all he had previously 
experienced, Johnny soon came to miss the days 
when he worked on the assembly line. In those 
days, at least, he was physically active. 

Depressed and broken, Johnny wasted away 
his life — not noticing and not appreciating the 
benefits of his new career. He was like thou- 
sands of emigres who have come to this country 
speaking a different language — locked into a 
different cultural template. He was a stranger in 
a strange land and he could never quite adapt. 

Too dramatic, you say? Don't kid your- 
self. An isolated incident? Not likely. The way 
robotics is progressing, a hundred years from

now there may be more nonfactory robots 
than robots on the assembly lines. Robots 
could fill all the potholes and lay all the drain- 
age pipes. Robots could replace bank tellers, 
taxi drivers, newsstand vendors, soda jerks, 
janitors, firefighters, mail carriers, hair dress- 
ers, truckers, restaurant cooks, railroad 
workers, and farm hands. The technology is 
within our reach to realize these and many 
more kinds of robot applications. 

Already we have walking, talking, seeing, 
hearing, and smelling robots. We have robots 
that can calculate faster than any human. What 
robots can't do yet is think for themselves; 
they are capable of only a limited kind of 
learning. But then advances in artificial intel- 
ligence may change all that sometime in the 
next century. 

Just as computers have made the transi- 
tion from the offices of only the largest com- 
panies to small businesses and homes, so will 
robots become more common in everyday life. 
Depending on the scenario, the long-term ef- 
fects caused by robots and automation could 
be the real story. 

The bottom line is, can we humans keep 
adapting and progressing as we make sweep- 
ing changes in the workplace and the job mar- 
ket? Are we attempting too much? Will the 
world truly be a better place once all the dan- 
gerous, dull, and degrading jobs have been 
taken over by machines? Will we all be happy 
as politicians, artists, office workers, and busi- 
nesspeople? 

Nobody can really answer those ques- 
tions today. But we can try to influence the 
future and anticipate the results of our pres- 
ent actions. It has always been a dream of 
some people to free man from the physical 
tasks required to keep us alive. Is it a good 
dream? 

Ask Johnny Detroit, who honestly en- 
joyed working with his hands. And ask his 
children, who never considered working in a 
factory. 

Like any new technology, robotics, com- 
puters, and automation are bound to change 
our world. It's up to us to drive the technol- 
ogy, not be driven by it. 

If we don't, a scenario similar to that 
found in "With Folded Hands" may come to 
pass, with the only difference being that a 
technological elitist group would be control- 
ling the robots. The rest of us would either be 
faced with the prospect of getting used to 
doing nothing or submitting to mind-altering 
drugs in order to be "happy." Neither alter- 
native is pleasant to contemplate. 

"No, there's nothing the matter with me." 
he gasped desperately. "I've just found out I'm 
perfectly happy, under the Prime Directive. 
Everything is absolutely wonderful." His voice 
came dry and hoarse and wild. ' ' You won't have 
to operate on me." 

The car turned off the shining avenue, tak- 
ing him back to the quiet splendor of his home. 
His futile hands, clenched and relaxed again, 
folded on his knees. There was nothing left 
to do. DH 



If your grandmother and your nontechie 
boss are still wondering what it is you do with 
your personal computer, you might alert them 
to a PBS television series making the rounds 
this summer and fall. Bits, Bytes, & Buzz- 
words is a five-part television series that at- 
tempts to cut through the jargon and market 
confusion and introduces the world of per- 
sonal computing to the computer illiterate. 

Produced by KQED— a PBS station in 
San Francisco — in conjunction with Pow- 
er/Rector Productions, Bits, Bytes, & Buzz- 
words is hosted by Emmy Award winner Jim 
Hartz, who has hosted such programs as Over 
Easy and NBC's Today show. Major funding 
for the show was provided by CompuPro. 

The first of the half-hour shows features 
an introduction to computer hardware — 
terms and basic components — as well as an in- 
troduction to software and the process of se- 
lecting machines for personal and business ap- 
plications. The second installment concen- 
trates on "the big three" — word processing, 
database management, and spreadsheets. 

An introducfion to accounting programs 
and a discussion of the new relationship of ac- 




countants to computers makes up the third 
show in the series. Graphics, games, and edu- 
cational applications are addressed in the 
fourth edition. 



The final segment concerns telecommuni- 
cations and the problems potential personal 
computer buyers may experience with dealers 
and manufacturers. 

Bits. Bytes, & Buzzwords was released to 
PBS stations around the country July 1 and 
will be appearing on 80 to 90 percent of the 
network's stations. Check your local program

Japanese Software 
Industry wai Get 
Benefits from MSX 



One thing that most American small-com- 
puter manufacturers have learned in the last 
half a dozen years is that software sells ma- 
chines. Computers are complex tools and soft- 
ware programs are analogous to the complex 
sets of instructions needed to use them. 

The Japanese have known this too, but 
have been slow to develop a software indus- 
try. Microsoft — purveyor of flight simulators, 
SoftCards, operating systems, and microcom- 
puter languages — has announced a set of 
specifications that, through standardization, 
should help the Japanese develop a viable do- 
mestic software industry faster. 

Called MSX, Microsoft's "program solves 
a major software marketing and development 
problem," says Bill Gates, chairman of the 
Bellevue, Washington-based company. "In 
the past, software had to be modified for each 
new computer. Now, with these specifica- 
tions, software developers and consumers can 
be assured of greater software /machine com- 
patibility." 

More than a dozen Japanese manufac- 
turers — including Canon, Fijitsu, Hitachi, 
Mitsubishi, Sony, Toshiba, and Matsu- 
shita — have signed up for MSX, as has one 
American company, Spectravideo. The hard- 
ware components of MSX include the com- 



puter's microprocessor and instruction set, in- 
put/output ports, a video processor, joystick 
interface, and ROM cartridges. MSX speci- 
fies a Z-80 eight-bit microprocessor, a Texas 
Instruments 9918 video-display processor 
chip, and Microsoft's Basic language inter- 
preter. 

The MSX concept was originally devel- 
oped by Matsushita and NEC in Japan and 
Spjectravideo in the United States. Microsoft 
became involved initially to provide a com- 
mon version of the company's Basic inter- 
preter. 

"This effort will also open the Japanese 
home-computer market to software compa- 
nies in the United States and Europe," says 
Gates. 

At the same time, many are wondering if 
MSX will aid the Japanese in moving into the 
American microcomputer market. The gen- 
eral consensus is that MSX will benefit the 
Japanese companies on their own soil but that 
its effect on the American market will not be 
felt for years, if at all. 

One reason for this feeling is the gradual 
move by American computer manufacturers 
away from eight-bit systems to more power- 
ful sixteen-bit processors and software. Texas 
Instruments, Atari, and other American firms 
are expected to introduce sixteen-bit software 
as early as next year. 

Clive Smith, an analyst for the Yankee 
Group, a Boston market research firm, said in 
the Wall Street Journal on June 17 that, if the 
Japanese have standardized for the less power- 
ful market, "it will be relatively painless to do 
it for the sixteen-bit market." If this occurs, 
the Japanese will clash head-on with Ameri- 
can firms in the U.S. market. DH 



Computer Tracks 
Truant Students 

Countless classrooms across the country 
now use computers to run educational soft- 
ware — everything from simple drill and prac- 
tice programs to sophisticated simulations. 
Educators are incorporating computers into 
the regular curriculum, and computer literacy 
and programming courses for students of all 
ages are becoming increasingly common. In 
light of these developments, the fact that two 
high schools in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District recently acquired two differ- 
ent models of a new computer system isn't ter- 
ribly noteworthy. 

Or maybe it is. The computer systems at 
Lincoln High School in Los Angeles and Ca- 
noga Park High School in southern Califor- 
nia's San Fernando Valley aren't used to run 
educational software or in teaching computer 
literacy or programming; in fact, they aren't 
used in the classroom at all. Rather, these ma- 
chines are located in the attendance offices at 
the two schools and represent an attempt by 
the school district to reduce truancy and im- 



prove classroom attendance. 

Here's the arrangement. Each day, the 
names and phone numbers of absent students 
are entered into the computer. Working be- 
tween the hours of 6:30 and 9:30 p.m., the 
computer telephones the students' homes, 
dialing automatically. It is programmed to try 
as many as three times during the evening be- 
fore giving up. When a connection is made, 
the computer plays a prerecorded message 
from the school principal notifying the per- 
son who answers the phone of the student's 
absence. It also asks that the parent call the 
school or send a note with the student the next 
day to explain the absence. 

Before the schools implemented the com- 
puter systems, guidance counselors and atten- 
dance workers attempted to contact the par- 
ents by telephone. But since the callers and the 
majority of parents worked during the day, 
the notification success rate wasn't particular- 
ly high. Because the computer can work at 
night when more parents are likely to be 
home, it succeeds in reaching a great many 
more parents than the human callers were able 
to. In addition, automation speeds up the 
process; a call can be dialed and completed 
within one minute, and, as a consequence, more 
attempts to reach parents are made. JV

continued from page 268 



Bluth, a former Disney animator, and iiis 
staff of ex-Disney artists have provided high- 
quality classical animation for Dragon's Lair 
in the same style as their feature-length ani- 
mated film The Secret of NIMH. 

Bluth says that the minimovie games her- 
ald a true marriage of art and technology. By 
combining the unique capabilities of comput- 
ers with animated film, they've not only 
opened the door to a new realm of uses for 
character animation, but have developed a 
new form of entertainment — "participatory 
movies." Furthermore, he points out a here- 
tofore unexamined reladonship between the 
computer program and the user. "Because of 
the human shapes and the elaborate, full art- 
work," he explains, "the game is easier to 
watch for extended periods of time. 

"With the three-dimensional drawings, the 
conflicts and threats seem closer to actual hu- 
man experience. Also, the viewer is constant- 
ly being trained to be wary of the innumer- 
able threats that surround him. In these ways, 
the computer ends up giving more back to the 
game player." 

The Dragon's Lair scenario follows Dirk 
the Daring on his quest to rescue the lovely 
Princess Daphne from the clutches of an evil 
dragon. An often clumsy knight. Dirk braves 
room after room infested with all manner of 
perils, forty-two in all. 

All the characters — Dirk, princess, and 
monsters — are classically animated, using 
fully detailed background artwork accom- 
plished with muldple passes of film through a 
camera for purposes of special-effects "burn- 
ins." The visual look of the game includes 
characters' shadows, reflections, and a careful 
orchestration of color to achieve emotional 
impact. A minimum of twelve character draw- 
ings were used for every second of film. 

"The scenarios, so far, contain two scenes 
that the computer selects, depending on the 
skill of the player," says Bluth's animation di- 
rector Gary Goldman. "The choices current- 
ly are fight or flight, using an action button to 
actuate Dirk's magic sword or a joystick to 
move him from room to room. In future 
games, we'll branch out to several different 
obstacles for stories that have alternatives 
other than death or running away." 

Unfortunately, users don't have the kind 
of object control in Dragon's Lair that they are 
used to having on standard video games, a la 
Pac-Man. Also, curious time-lag blackouts 
plagued the prototype copy; Goldman said 
these would be eliminated in the arcade ver- 
sions. 

Additional games are already under de- 
velopment at Don Bluth Productions. A space 
game, tentatively titled Space Ace, involves a 
fourteen-year-old nerd who becomes physi- 
cally energized at certain moments, like Jerry 



the Mouse in Tom and Jerry's Doctor Jekyll 
and Mr. Mouse. A sequel to Dragon's Lair 
may also be in the works, depending on the 
original's popularity. A home version of Drag- 
on's Lair is under way at Coleco, tying the 
game into a home laser-disc player. It should 
be ready by next year. 

Other studio games companies are look- 
ing at the home minimovie game market as 
well. Former MCA Videodisc president Jim 
Fiedler, who's now in charge of MCA Video 
Games, announced two disc titles developed 
by MCA and Optical Programming Asso- 
ciates. The first. Maze Mania, was released 
this past May and consists of four mini- 
games: a space game called Blast Off, a west- 
ern titled Shoot Out, a haunted house game 
called Nightmare Castle, and a football sce- 
nario dubbed Lst and 10. The games are com- 
posed entirely of live-action and animation se- 
quences, originally shot on 16mm film by Bo- 
sustow Productions. Stock footage from Bat- 
tlestar Galactica and NASA comprises some 
of Blast Off effects sequences. 

"The games were developed as entertain- 
ment shows that allow users of the interactive 
Pioneer and Magnavox discs to operate the 
fast-forward, stop-frame, backward, and 
frame-counter features on the disc players," 
says Nick Bosustow, president of Bosustow 
Productions. "The disc companies' logic is 
that if buyers spend $700 for players, they'd 
like to deliver programming that would en- 



Above, the success 
of the new videodisc 
"minimovie" arcade 
games depends on 
the willingness of 
game players to 
spend fifty cents 
instead of the usual 
quarter. Right, although 
Dragon's Lair has 
less than state-of- 
the-art playability, 
the high-quality 
animation gives a 
good idea of what 
future videodisc 
games will look like. 



able them to use all of the interacfive fea- 
tures." 

During a game, the disc automatically 
stops and asks the player questions related to 
the show he's involved in. The object of the 
four games is to get the highest score by cor- 
rectly answering as many questions as possi- 
ble. Getting too many wrong answers leads 
players to dead ends in the stories. "What 
most of the people will do is play the game 
wrong because it's much more fun to see the 
silly answers," explains Bosustow. 

Maze Mania was actually begun two years 
ago, so now the questions and answers may 
seem too simplistic to some players. Each 




game has only correct and incorrect answers. 
According to MCA programming executive 
Phyllis Bagdadi, a future game that's set in 
Hollywood (tentatively titled Quest) will be 
more random-based as far as questions go. 

MCA has a joint venture with Atari to 
spawn licensed games from Universal's vast 
film library. Some will more than likely be vid- 
eodisc games, indicates MCA's Fiedler, es- 
pecially in view of the fact that the company 
was at one time in partnership with Pioneer to 
manufacture the Discovision laser-disc sys- 




tem. Since Fiedler himself was formerly in- 
volved with the company, it's logical for the 
disc avenue to be exploited by MCA. Further 
down the line, MCA's partnership with 
Atari — called Studio Games — will include the 
production of coin-op and home computer 
laser-disc titles. 

Atari has a joint-venture licensing agree- 
ment with Lucasfilm. While both companies 
are adopting a strategic "wait and see" phi- 
losophy in terms of watching the learning 
curves of their competition. Atari VP of mar- 
keting Don Osborne reported that the king 
of game companies should move into the field 
by year's end. LPR 




□ Automation and Society. The 1983 World 
Congress on Human Aspects of Automation 
will be held at the University of Michigan in 
Ann Arbor, Michigan, August 9-11. Spon- 
sored by the Society of Manufacturing Engi- 
neers (SME), the conference's theme is "Liv- 
ing with Automation." Issues to be discussed 
include job displacement, training, and re- 
training. For more information, contact 



SME's technical activities department in 
Dearborn, Michigan. 

□ Windy City Robotics. The computer-en- 
gineering division of the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers (ASME) is sponsoring 
the 1983 International Computer in Engi- 
neering Conference, to be held August 8—10 
at Chicago's Marriott Hotel. More than sixty 
technical sessions will be held covering ro- 
botics, CAD, manufacturing and analysis, 
and automation. Attendees of the conference 
will view, test, and evaluate current state-of- 
the-art computer products. For more infor- 
mation, contact the ASME office in New 
York City. 

□ European Robots. The Palexpo Exhibi- 



tion Center in Geneva, Switzerland, will be the 
site of AUTOFACT Europe, to be held Sep- 
tember 13—15. Cosponsored by the Institute 
of Production Engineers (London, England) 
and the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, 
the conference will focus on the technologies 
of automated and computer integrated manu- 
facturing for European production. The daily 
session for Wednesday, September 14, will be 
devoted to robotics. Products to be displayed 
include robots, CAD/CAM, engineering 
analysis, automated assembly, materials flow 
and handling, inventory control, inspection, 
and quality control. Further information can 
be obtained from the Society of Manufactur- 
ing Engineers in Dearborn, Michigan. 
□ A Hair of a Different Color. The latest 
great American institution to enter the "in- 
formation age" is the beauty salon. James 
Rocco Hair Designs in Pittsburgh, Pennsyl- 
vania, has installed a computer dedicated to 
taking the guesswork out of hair coloring. 
Now, when hair designers get ready to color 
someone's hair at Rocco's salon, they consult 
a small computer program that holds one 




hundred twenty thousand different formulas 
for determining what shampoo to use, the 
proper mix of bleaching ingredients and tint 
solutions, and the processing time needed to 
neutralize the hair. "Even for the seasoned 
hair stylist," says Rocco, "there are many var- 
iables and some educated guesswork involved 
to attain a desired hair color. Before coloring 
anyone's hair, the stylist should know if and 
how the hair has been colored before, the per- 
centage of gray hair, the texture and thickness 
of the hair." The computer program, de- 
veloped by Goldwell Cosmetic in Germany, 
prompts the stylist with such questions before 
making its calculations. 
□ Hotel Talk. How much are computers be- 
coming a part of everyday life? They're given 
away with cars, planned for in suburban 
homes, used in libraries and schools. You 
can't get away from them, even on vacation.

national of Belvedere, California, announced 
SuiteTalk, a complete personal computer sys- 
tem designed exclusively for use in individual 
hotel rooms (a similar system was recently an- 
nounced by TravelHost). Using the SuiteTalk 
terminal, hotel guests will be able to access 
HotelNet, a customized database offering all 
kinds of information and services — every- 
thing from the CBS and NBC news services to 
connection with a home or office computer. 
HotelTech, which says it will start installing 
SuiteTalk units in hotels this fall, also plans to 
offer services such as airline scheduling, mes- 
sage sending, word processing, calculating, 
and video games. The firm plans to have the 
system customized for use in hotels during the 
1 984 Democratic Convention in San Francis- 
co and the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. 
□ Come Play the Friendly Skies? Can't get 
enough of video games? Cheer up, they may 
be available for playing on commercial airline 
flights as soon as the end of the year. San Jose, 
California-based Altus Corp. has developed a 
way to attach hand-held video games to the 
nip-down food trays found in most modern 
commercial jets. Two months ago, Canadian 
Pacific Airlines tested the system, called 
Airplay, on a flight from Vancouver to Am- 
sterdam. Doug Crane, president of Altus, says 
the test went very well and other airlines are 




"enthused" about the system. Once the end- 
user reaction has been properly studied — dif- 
ferent airlines will be performing tests through 
the end of the year — it's possible the games 
will be offered to passengers for a price com- 
parable to that charged for the headsets most 
airlines offer for listening to prerecorded 
audio programs. Right now, the airlines are 
determining which flights and which kinds of 
customers are the best targets for such in-flight 
entertainment. Crane also says that Amtrak is 
interested in testing the system on its passen- 
ger trains. If the system is accepted by either 
the airlines or Amtrak, there could be modest 
computing power included in the game units 
later on. JM

loretta's head toppled from her shoulders 
"and dropped to the ground. 
It wobbled and rolled around a bit, thudding to a halt against the 
patent-leather shoes of Samuel Q. Pydeondroppe, a.k.a. St. Louis Cadil- 
lac Sammy, the undisputed master of the Sister Charlotte Bait and 
Switch, the Kansas City Wandering Gypsy Blessed Money Ruse, the 
Cleveland Two for One, the Denver Now-You-See-It-Now-You-Don't, 
the Los Angeles Sheer Sucker Suit, the Oklahoma Depleted Allowance 
Shuffle, and a hundred or two other equally effective con games. 

Sammy grunted and looked down into the Nile-green eyes that 
blinked up at him. He bent over and gripped the tangled red strands of 
Loretta's hair before the night breeze blew them into the flickering flames 
of the Sterno cans. 

Electrons flowed in an alternating current, humming through in- 
tricately entwined spider webs of copper. Circuits clicked, memory chips 
awoke, and a gyro righted itself to restore equilibrium. Loretta blinked 
twice before weakly smiling. 

"Does that happen often?" the young woman opposite Sammy 
asked. 

"She's always going to pieces. An arm here, a leg there, she can't 
keep herself together." Sammy lifted Loretta's disembodied head and re- 
placed it atop her waiting shoulders. He twisted her neck to the right to 
secure it firmly in place. Loretta's smile broadened in gratitude. 

Sammy's attention shifted back to the young woman. "This is the 
fourth time today she's lost her head." 

"You shouldn't keep count." Loretta's voice box awakened with a

surge of restored power. Her gaze drifted to the ground and she pouted. 
"It isn't polite." 

"She doesn't appear very practical. Newer models are built much 
better . . . robots that can withstand the normal wear and tear of daily 
routines," the young woman said. "Why do you keep her?" 

Loretta stiffened. Miniature lightning bolts, as though generated by 
the woman's words, sparked deep within her torso assembly to leap the 
gap between two circuits. An internal probe tapped the source of dis- 
tress. Loretta rerouted circuits to bypass the disfunctioning part, then 
logged a reminder for Andrew to purchase a replacement at his con- 
venience. 

"/ don't . . . he does!" Sammy's head tilted to the man huddled just 
outside the circle gathered about the Sterno cans. "I'm not answerable 
for what he does . . . not anymore." 

"He . . . Andrew . . . says I'm human." Loretta interrupted in a soft 
voice, sensing the need to protect her owner. She added hesitantly, "At 
least part human, more human than machine." 

"More of his crazy talk," Sammy snorted with disgust. "He's always 
spouting things like that. It's the way his mind works. Totally irrational! 
Loretta's incapable of functioning with the normal, set precision of an 
ordinary robot, so he says she's human. What does Aeknow? If it weren't 
for me. . . ." 

"How does that make her human?" The young woman pulled a 
notebooltand pen from the deep pocket of her trench coat. "Precision is 
demanded of every man, woman, and child. We all have our tasks and 
must carry them out with the exactness that our lifestyle requires. With- 
out it, the whole world would crumble." 

Again blue sparks crackled deep within the core of Loretta's chest 
unit. And again she rerouted circuits to alleviate a minor overload. 
Something buried in her memory banks tried to push itself forward. But 
those same electronic etchings told her that to interject comment into the 
discussion would be useless. She had tried in the past. She was never 
heard. 

"Don't ask me! I told you it was just more of his babblings," Sam-

woman's rather attractive face, then her notebook and p)en. "Who are 
you? A reporter?" 

The woman nodded. 

"Well. . . ." Sammy's disgruntled expression evaporated in the bat- 
ting of an eye, replaced by a smile designed to charm the hardest of 
hearts. He sat straight, preened the front of his overcoat, and ran a hand 
over his slicked-back hair. "... I must apologize. I thought you were just 
another of these hangers-on." 

He waved to the three other figures squatted around the cans of 
burning Sterno. They were motley, as was their campsite. Not at all the 
type of people one would expect to congregate in the search for a com- 
mon bond. But just the same, they were there: Harvey Soonerflats, who 
had attempted to homestead Hollywood and Vine in the late nineties; 
Sally Plumage, who had been arrested for her erotic dance atop the Ten- 
nessee Valley Solar Power Converter during its dedication ceremonies; 
and William Thunderbird. No one knew much about Billy Thunderbird 
except that he once hawked mimeographed copies of splendidly com- 
posed, but commercially unacceptable, verse on the street corners of 
Nueva Laredo. 

'"He says they all hold a spark of humanity. Obvious testimony to his 
madness." Sammy's gaze moved back to the young woman, ignoring 
Loretta when she rose and whirred away to the man huddled outside the 
circle. "But that's of little consequence. More to the point would be, how 
may I assist you? If you've got any questions, you've come to the right 
man. Whatever he's made of his life, he's got Samuel Q. Pydeondroppe 
to thank for it. That's Pydeondroppe, P-Y-D-E-O-N-D-R-O-P-P-E." 

"Everyone knows about the past few years, his speeches, his visions, 
his wanderings," the young woman began. "They've even been written 
up in True Adventures in Modem Psychology. What I'm interested in is 
how it all began, where he came from." 

Loretta tried to block out her audio sensors with no success. She re- 
ceived every painful syllable of the conversation. She shook her head. 

"Yes." Sammy mulled it over for a moment. "I really don't know 
exactly where he comes from. But I was the one who discovered him. I 
was working the old Lonely Hearts ... uh ... I was pursuing a roman- 
tic interest in the fair city of New Orleans . . . when I first saw him. He 
was billed as a stand-up comic in a Bourbon Street dive. I can't say he 
was all that funny, what with his one-liners about the vanishing human 
race and his one-man war against robots and machine men. 

"But I've got an eye for talent and there was real talent hidden be- 
neath that rough exterior. All he needed was a bit of polish. If a man's 
going to make it in this world, he's got to take chances. I took that 
chance. I walked up to him and announced I'd be his agent, make a star 
out of a sow's ear, so to speak. . . ." 

And so it was after twenty years, seven months, sixteen days, ten 
hours, and thirty-one minutes (and 41.3 seconds, for those who 
demand absolute precision in the transition of the temporal dimension) 
that Andrew came to the place. Or what he hoped would be the place. 

However, had he been questioned about the exact location of this 
place, while he sat there with his head in his hands, he would have been 
unable to provide an adequate reply to the simple query. 

Nor did he bother his mind with such trivialities. For the place was 
not a static plot of geography securely anchored in the depths of the 
earth's bedrock bowels. The place was the very fabric of dreams. A realm 
propelled by the wind's streams, rivers, and maelstroms. It was just as 
likely to be found floating on the back of some billowy cloud as on the 
ground. Movement was the nature of the place. Its existence was a study 
of perpetual motion. 

' But its weave wasn't all fine threads of silver and gold. Interwoven 
amid the bright and sparkling beauty were strands of dark terrors and 
unspeakable horrors, black twines evoking the grotesque ghosties and 
ghoulies and beasties that haunt and thump in the mind's night. This too 
was the fabric of dreams, for some dreams are nightmares. 

Yet, there are those so set in their orientation to the physical realities 
of the world that they are unable to visualize the equally valid reality of 
the place without a description of a parcel of geography. 

For those, Andrew's precise location, while it could have been with- 
in the exotic pleasure dome of Xanadu, or the hate-festered alleys of New 
York, or the fertile rain forest of the Amazon, or even the box-on-box

monotony of Greater Suburbia, was a majestic throne of rock set amid 
the arid vastness of New Mexico's desert. 

He was there atop the highest peak of a mountain bearing the very 
unregal title of Sandia Crest. A mountain named, as legend would have 
it, by a group of Spanish explorers who thought the towering crest, while 
caught in the blazing hues of a southwestern sunset, resembled a water- 
melon. A lack of imagination that left Andrew to ponder what naming 
of names would have resulted had chance allowed those same explorers 
to first view the mountain during sunrise. 

It was there, atop Sandia Crest, that he sat with his back to the laby- 
rinth of lights sprawled at the foot of the west face of the peak — lights 
marking the boundaries of Albuquerque. And he waited, occasionally 
sniffing the clouds that rolled in over the peak from the east only to be 
caught in the downdraft of the mountain's west cliff and sucked toward 
the city below. 

"Andrew . . . Andrew. . . ." Loretta carefully toned her voice to a low 
whisper so as to gently intrude into his thoughts. 

Andrew looked up to see her tap an eyeball back into its socket. 

Loretta glanced away, moved by something she could not define that 
told her it was unseemly for him to see her in such an awkward position. 
The stray eyeball firmly screwed back in place. She once again looked at 
the man. 

"Andrew, there's a reporter here," she said. "I don't know how she 
found out . . . I'm sorry. . . ." 

Surging electrons moved within her. She fought an illogical urge to 
lift her hand and tenderly brush Andrew's cheek with her fingertips. 

"No problem, my dear." Andrew assured her with a squeeze of her 
plastiskin hand. "It's a good omen. A reporter is perfect! Someone to re- 
cord tonight's events. Perhaps if there are others, they will see the article 
and follow." 

Incomprehensible vibrations shuddered through Loretta's hydraulic 
fluids. She drew correlations from past interviews. The probable out- 
come was far less opfimistic than Andrew's attitude should indicate. 

"I think she'll want to speak with you." Loretta glanced over her 
shoulder. "Sammy is talking with her now. I don't know if that's wise." 

"Don't let it bother you. Sammy's got that spark of humanity too. 
He just hasn't discovered it." Andrew's gaze drifted to the five figures 
squatted around the seven cans of flaming Sterno. The blue-and-yellow 
tongues of fire flickered in the night breeze. He watched their hypnotic 
dance while Loretta listened. 

". . . He's the best meal ticket I've ever latched on to," Sammy said. 
"His routine about human beings disappearing through a rent in time 
and space has broke 'em up all the way from Walla Walla to Jersey City. 
I mean, he really lays 'em in the aisles. The only trouble is, he took him- 
self seriously. Then these bums started popping up. Hell, they're not even 
groupies! They're true believersl At least for a while. They come and go. 
When he can't produce, they don't believe as hard and they drift away." 

That was true, Loretta silently agreed, except for herself. She'd been 
with Andrew five years. And, of course, Sammy. He'd been around for 
seven. 

"And yourself," the young woman asked, "do you believe?" 

"Me? Naw! I told you, he's a meal ticket. My oatcard," Sammy re- 
plied with an emphatic shake of his head. "I never minded all the public- 
ity about his being a prophet . . . might have helped it along a bit on oc- 
casion. You know, the prophet and his disciples. It adds that mystic 
touch and gets 'em wondering — sfirs the interest." 

"And now?" 

"He wants to throw it all away!" Sammy grunted. "He's built this 
thing up so big that if it doesn't come off, he's ruined. Nobody will ever 
listen to him again. All the late-night talk shows will cancel his appear- 
ances. The variety spectaculars will slam their doors in my face. The se- 
ries I've got lined up goes out the window. And, does come off, where 
am I then? Don't get me wrong. I don't think for a moment it will. But if 
it does, what then? You tell me. I can't win for losing! After all I've done 
for him, he does this to meV 

Loretta scrutinized Sammy, trying to find the spark of humanity An- 
drew found within the man. She couldn't, but neither could she isolate 
that spark Andrew claimed dwelled within her chassis of stainless steel, 
rubber, and plastiskin. 

The young woman sat silently for a second or two as if unsure of 



what to say. "I'm expecting a photographer. Do you think he'll mind a 
few quick shots?" 

"He won't mind," Loretta said, whirring beside the young woman. 
"Andrew said he'll talk with you." 

The reporter glanced up, then turned to Andrew. He nodded and 
smiled. She rose from the Sterno campfire and walked to his side. 

"Mr " 

"Andrew will be fine," he said as he hugged his coat around him. 
"I've never been one to stand on formalities." 

"Andrew . . . there are several questions my readers would like an- 
swered," she began. 

"And yourself?" 

"And me," she replied with a nod. "I know there's been a lot written 
about you and this, uh, this. . . ." 
"The place," Andrew said. 

"Yes, this place," she repeated. "But do you mind if we start from the 
beginning?" 

Loretta remained quietly stationed beside the reporter. The woman 
appeared harmless enough. But others had appeared the same. She still 
bore a sloppy patch on her stomach as a reminder of a .45 caliber slug 
meant for Andrew. 

"That would be quite all right," Andrew answered with a reassuring 
smile. "You have to get the facts straight, don't you?" 

The young woman nodded. "To begin at the beginning, when did 
you first feel that human beings were disappearing from the worid?" 

"I don't know when I first felt it. I first noticed it in '69, right after the 
first moon landing," Andrew said. "There was mankind taking that giant 
leap, freeing itself from this ball of clay, opening the way to the universe. 
Man would soon conquer the stars. Then it stopped. 

"I realize there are the shuttle flights and that tin can up there they 
call a spaceport. But it isn't really space flight. It isn't the stars, or even 
the planets. It's just busy-work. In all the visions of the future, no one 
ever thought we'd take that first leap — then stop! But we did . . . or they 
did." 

Loretta sensed a wobbly shifting of her gyros. She knew what ques-

tion would come next. It was always the same. They always asked . . . 
but never believed the answer. 

"They?" The young woman stopped scribbling in her notebook to 
look up with brows furrowed. "Did I hear you correctly? They?" 

"The others, the ones who live, dress, eat, sleep, and work like hu- 
man beings," Andrew replied without pause. "It's hard to tell them from 
the real McCoy. I'm not exactly sure what they are. Perhaps they were 
once human, in a fashion. Or maybe they're just human by-products. 
But you can spot 'em. That certain gleam is missing from their eyes. 
Their laugh isn't quite right, a little too loud and a bit off-key. And you'll 
never catch them daydreaming. They also have an abhorrence to build- 
ing sandcastles and stargazing. It isn't in their nature." 

The reporter glanced up at Andrew again but did not comment. Lor- 
etta's gaze rose to the heavens. Stargazing, was that the spark of human- 
ity Andrew spoke of? She could discern no stars above. They were hid- 
den by the thick clouds rolling over the crest. 

"Don't get me wrong," Andrew continued. "They're not a bad lot, 
not in their own way. They're quite industrious. They love building 
things, and their constructions are quite marvelous. But labor as they 
will, their efforts are nothing more than exercises in repetition. Every 
item is a carbon copy of the one before it. 

"I don't know when they first began to appear, but they have be- 
come the dominant life form in this world. Man is a vanishing species." 
Andrew paused and sniffed a new cloud bank rolling over the peak. "As 
1 said, I first noticed it back in '69. I was in a tavern with an old friend, a 
really hearty fellow who once set world records by hitchhiking around 
the globe ten times consecutively. He was also a fellow who thoroughly 
enjoyed up-ending a few tall, cool ones. We had just finished off a pitch- 
er of dark when he rose to relieve the distress that accompanies any ses- 
sion of serious beer drinking. I watched him walk through the door 
marked 'Gentlemen.' He never returned. I was the only one who 
noticed." 

"I asked everyone about Big Jim, but I was the only one who re- 
membered him. Even his wife denied having ever known him," Andrew 
said. "All she said was, 'Why would I waste my time with a man who 
spends his life hitchhiking around the world? My husband is an execu- 
tive with one of this nation's largest advertising firms.' And, of course, he 
was. And he wasn't Big Jim." 

Loretta meticulously scanned the young woman's face in search of a 
single hint of belief in her passive mask. Her optical sensors registered 
negative — the expected reading. Probability demanded such a lack of 
faith from the reporter. The woman reacted with perfect predictability, as 
a thousand such chroniclers before her had reacted. That security of pre- 
dictability did nothing to ease the hollowness Loretta sensed within her 
identity unit. 

"Shortly afterward I noticed that all the little old ladies who sold 
flowers on street corners disappeared. Door-to-door salesmen became a 
forgotten portion of our history. Magicians and their delightful chican- 
ery were next to go, then sailors, railroad engineers, and cowboys. Of 
course circus performers and mountain climbers vanished." A wistful 
smile touched the corners of Andrew's mouth. "One day they were there, 
and the next day they weren't. Just like that! And nobody noticed. 

"There were other things. Adventure series were pulled from the air- 
waves and replaced by situation comedies. Football and hockey became 
big items, and baseball was nonexistent. It was only reasonable, I guess, 
since the others enjoy violence. After all, they need some relief from the 
monotony of their lives. A correlation can be found in the sudden up- 
swing of the crime rate at this time to the increase of the others populat- 
ing the world. More and more people vanished and nobody noticed." 

Andrew paused again and took another deep whiff of the clouds. He 
smiled. 

A gentle smile moved across Loretta's plastiskin lips while she tight- 
ened a finger that insisted in slipping from its socket. In spite of the lack 
of knowledge on the art of prestidigitation in her memory banks, she 
could combine the images of flowers and little old ladies on street cor- 
ners. The vision of smiling, wrinkled faces, disarrayed white hair, sur- 
rounded by blossoms of varying hues, brought a calmness within her 
circuitry. 

"Obviously .something was happening. People don't just up and dis- 
appear — not without .some logical explanation," Andrew continued af- 



ter another whiff of the clouds. "Since I've never put much faith in flying 
saucers and abductors from the Crab Nebula, 1 began to search for the 
answer. That's when I discovered the place, a tear in the fabric of real- 
ity — a rent in time and space, a dimension warp, whatever you wish to 
call it, since it really doesn't matter." 

Loretta detected it now in the young woman's face. Skepticism and 
doubt slightly wrinkling her creaseless forehead. Emptiness returned to 
fill Loretta. This one was no different than the rest. Andrew's truth was 
beyond her concept of reality. 

Sensing the hopelessness of his posifion, Loretta turned to Andrew. 
He too noted the young woman's disbelief, she could see. But he was un- 
daunted and simply smiled and shrugged. 

"If what you say is true, why would anyone want to step through this 
interdimensional warp?" the reporter asked. 

"Reverse entropy, of course," Andrew replied. "The others would 
never seek the rent and the place beyond. But humans seek other hu- 
mans, even if we do like to keep our distance on occasion." 

"And this rent," the young woman asked, "will be here tonight?" 

"It's impossible to chart its course, though I can assure you I've tried. 
It just bounces around in the stream of possibility with chance at the 
helm," Andrew said. "However, there is a high possibility it will pass this 
way tonight. Such a high possibility, in fact, that it's a probability." 

The young reporter glanced at him again. "And you intend to step 
into it?" 

"Actually, it more or less swallows you up," he said. "Naturally, if I 
see it coming, I'll walk into it." 

"But why here?" she asked. "Why would it come here?" 

"While it does ramble around a lot, it tends to seek out regions where 
humanity still dwells. It hasn't touched the East or West Coasts for ten 
years. Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and certain mountains in Ken- 
tucky and Tennessee are regularly visited," he answered. "I just missed it 
three years ago in Upshur County, Texas. Couldn't have been more than 
a minute or two behind it." 

"How did you know? Can you see it?" 

Disbelief was more than obvious on the woman's face now, and still 
she persisted with the interview. Loretta could not understand why An- 
drew continued. Didn't he understand the mockery she would make of 
him in her article? 

"Smelled it," Andrew said with a broad smile. "The strongest scent 
I've ever found was there in the East Texas Piney Woods. At least for its 
more recent visits." 

"I thought this was a new phenomenon?" she questioned. 

"Oh, no. It's been around — forever, as best as I can determine," An- 
drew said. "Apparently its size is directly proportional to the size of hu- 
manity. In the old days, it really left a smell. When you find one of the 
old spots, the very old ones, there's still enough of its aroma lingering in 
the air to tingle the senses. You can get a mighty powerful whiff of it 
around the small German village of Hamlin. And on certain clear sum- 
mer nights in London, when you can look up and see the first star of 
morning, its fragrance just wafts through the city like honeysuckle. Now- 
adays, you're lucky to get a hint of it in the breeze." 

"Can you smell it now?" she asked. "Is it here?" 

"It's in the air. But it's not like all the other times." Andrew's nos- 
trils flared as he drew in a deep breath. "I've only smelled where it's been. 
This time, it's different. I smell it coming." 

Loretta sniffed the air. All that wafted in her sensors was the cloud's 
moisture and the rich aroma of coffee. Adding a note to have all her sen- 
sors checked for rust to her list of needed repairs, she glanced to the 
campsite. Sammy placed an old pot atop one of the cans of Stemo. He 
held up a cup in offering to the young woman. A shadow moved among 
the mists beyond the campsite. 

"Your photographer's coming. Miss." Loretta pointed a still loose 
finger at the shadow trudging toward them. 

"I think I'd like to try a cup of that coffee, then get some pictures, if 
you don't mind," the young woman said, turning back to Andrew. 

"Not at all." He smiled up at her when she rose. "Photographs 
would be nice to document what will happen here tonight." 

She did not comment, but stepped to the fire and accepted the cup of 
steaming coffee Sammy handed her. Loretta whirred beside them, 
listening.

"He's been telling you about smelling it, hasn't he?" Sammy eyed the 
reporter while she nodded. *i knew it! Can't tell his comedy routine from 
reality. Smelling it! Can you believe that?" 

"Well," she said between sips, "I really can't say that I do." 

"No one in their right mind can." Sammy shook his head. "Nobody 
except these gold-brickers. They believe he smells it. Not that any of 
them has ever smelled it. Only thing they've ever whiffed is a bit of Sky 
Dust. But they believe, and they think he's going to step through this rent 
into another world. And they want to go with him!" 

The young woman's lips pursed in disbelief as she turned to the pho- 
tographer who walked to her side huffing. "Snap a couple of him and 
let's get out of here. I've got enough for a story." 

"Which one do you want snapped?" he asked. 

"Him," she said, pointing to Andrew. 

Andrew was gone. 

"My God! Now he's gone and done it!" Sammy moaned. "He's 
walked off the edge of the cliff!" 

"It swallowed him up." Loretta's voice box warbled a bit. She had 
seen it, but her logic systems were having a hard time accepting what had 
transpired. "He stood up and took one step, and it swallowed him up, 
just like that." 

"Don't give me that!" Sammy snapped at his robot companion, ig- 
noring the faces that stared at him. "He wandered off in all this fog 
and. . . ." 

"Honeysuckle," the young reporter said as though to no one but 
herself. 

"What?" Sammy glared at her. 

"Just a hint of it in the breeze," Loretta answered. "I smell it." 

Filaments tingled with a rush of flowing electrons. Circuits opened 
and closed. An intangible something whirled and pounded within her 
metallic torso. "/ smell //!" 

"He did it!" Sally Plumage squealed. Unable to restrain the excite- 
ment of the moment, her body trembled and shook in a highly provoca- 
tive manner that was reminiscent of her performance atop the Tennessee 
Valley Solar Power Converter. "He did it! He did it! He really did it!" 



"He wandered the world to find his place. Now he walks the realms 
of time and space," Billy Thunderbird said. It wasn't splendidly com- 
posed verse, but no one seemed to care. After all, it was impromptu, and 
it fit the moment. 

"He's gone," Harvey Soonerfiats mumbled. "He's gone and he's left 
us here." 

Sammy didn't say anything, except to grunt in disgust. 

The others stood silently, comprehending the full meaning of Har- 
vey's comment. Occasionally their heads rose to sniff the air, but it was 
gone. Andrew was gone, too, and they were alone. 

Abruptly, Loretta turned and whirred away from the dumbfounded 
group. She moved down the east slope of the mountain with steadfast de- 
termination. She knew what she had to do next. 

"Hey!" Sammy called after her. "Where do you think you're going?" 

"To find Andrew." Loretta stopped to glance back. "And the place." 

"Are you completely mad?" Sammy protested. 

Madness . . . Loretta comprehended the word when used in the hu- 
man context. But madness was alien to robots. Or was it? She wasn't cer- 
tain, though it didn't matter. Nothing held any importance but finding 
Andrew and joining him in the place. 

The young woman, still clutching her notebook, waved Sammy to si- 
lence and asked Loretta, "Could you use some company? Two noses are 
better than one." 

The reporter held out a hand. Loretta smiled and accepted it. It was 
hers. She screwed it back to her wrist while the woman came to her side. 
Then they both turned to leave. 

"Wait up!" Sammy said. "You two can't go wandering off all alone. 
You'll need help. You'll need somebody who knows the ropes!" 

They offered no objections, so he ran after them. After all, he was 
Samuel Q. Pydeondroppe, and Samuel Q. Pydeondroppe knew a meal 
ticket when he saw one. And what was the loss of one stand-up comic 
when there was a team to replace him? An attractive young female and a 
self-destructing robot — the act would be unbeatable. He could even put 
up with the hangers-on who followed at his heels, chasing the fragrance 
of honeysuckle. Hi

AUGUST 1983 



Softalk Presents Hie Bestsellers 



June was a pretty good month as months go these days in the Apple 
market, with several folks marking milestones and business in general 
improving beyond most expectations. 

June was best for Datasoft. Everyone said they might be able to 
translate Zaxxon faithfully on the Atari, but that they would never come 
close on the Apple. The verdict of the public is overwhelming. They came 
close. 

Zaxxon is the hottest-selhng game in the Apple market since Chop- 
lifter and appears to have the potential to beat even that bellwether pro- 
gram. This is the breakthrough program Datasoft's been seeking for the 
past two years. They've been relatively strong competitors in other mar- 
kets, but no program has really taken off for them in the Apple market. 
Canyon Climber was a moderate success, but not a big winner. Now 
they've got the big winner they need to capture Apple owners' attention. 

It couldn't be better timing. The company has been through manage- 
ment shakeups and distractions, and they shelled out substantial dollars 
for the home computer rights to Zaxxon. A lot was at stake, and the 
June roll of the dice came up a winner for Datasoft. 

It was also a pretty significant month for the folks at Software Pub- 
lishing Corporation. They've nurtured PFS.File, and as a result it's con- 
sistently been among the top five programs in the Apple market. Some- 
times, it's been number two. 

This month it's only third, but there's still a story behind that place- 
ment. June was the first time in three full years that PFS. File managed to 
overtake VisiCalc. 

That's a double-barreled milestone. PFS has finally conquered the 
VisiCalc mystique. And they have final proof that you can write a pro- 
gram in Pascal that will compete in the big leagues. 

June also wasn't a bad month for newcomer Electronic Arts. It was 
the first month that they had software to sell and, as they had hoped, 
they found buyers to buy. Hard Hat Mac^ jumped into eighteenth on the 
Top Thirty and Axis Assassin tied for eighth on the Arcade 10 charts. 

The company has visions of new genres of entertainment software 
and new approaches to attracting authors and to marketing product. 
One month does not a company make, but the omens seem favorable. 

June also turned out to be a pretty fair month for the Xerox and 
Weekly Reader people. Their Stickybear ABC program hit twentieth on 
the Top Thirty and it and Sticky Bear Numbers both scored on the 
Education 10. 

But, overall, it's still Apple Writer He dominating sales. New Apple 
owners are opting for Paul Lutus's word processor in unprecedented 
numbers. It's by far the fastest-selling piece of software ever to hit the 
Apple market and is probably second only to VisiCalc as the hottest

SPARE CHANGE You are the game-happy owner 

of the Spare Change Arcade. Two fun-loving, but overworked 
Zerks— the main characters in your most popular game— have bro- 
ken loose and are trying to retire from the business. You try madly to 
stop them. If you can get a coin into the juke box, the Zerks get so 
caught up in the music, they drop everything and start dancing. You 
also try popping popcorn and making a pay phone ring— which 
immediately makes the Zerks stop, answer and start a wild con 
versation. If you "win" the game, 
there are rib tickling cartoons by 
the Zerks to reward your efforts. 
It's a game full of sight gags, 
surprises and comedy. From the 
best. Br0derbund! For the 
Apple® II, II + and He. Coming 
soon for the Atari® home 
computers in disk format. 




and an endless challenge 



LODE RUNNER 




Here's a game that will never stop challenging 
you. That's because Lode Runner is more than a spellbinding, fast- 
action game with its 150 different mind-boggling game screens. Lode 
Runner is also an easy-to-use Game Generator that lets you create your 
own games. Without any knowledge of programming, you can easily 
design unique Lode Runnner screens, then bring them to action-packed 

life. You will maneuver through scene 

after scene, running, jumping, drilling 
passages and outfoxing enemy 
guards in a secret underground hide- 
away as you pick up chests of gold 
stolen from citizens of the Bungeling 
Empire. There's no end to the thrills, 
chills and challenge. Of course, it's 
from Br^derbund! For the Apple II, 
11+ and He. Coming soon for the: 
Atari home computers (disk and 
cartridge); Atari 5200^*" Super 
System; Commodore 64™; 
VIC-20™; IBM® PC.

programs tied for tenth in their first appearances on the list. 

Hottest of the three is Lode Runner from Broderbund. Barely out in 
June, it looks like another strong entertainment entry. Maze Craze Con- 
struction Set and Beagle Bag were the other programs in the dead heat. 
Beagle Bag really isn't a classic arcade game; on the other hand it doesn't 
fit any other category, and no other program fits its category. So it gets 
tracked here by default. 

There was a significant shakeup in positions in the Word Processing 
10. Apple Writer lie and Bank Street Writer retained the top two posi- 
tions, but WordStar leaped into third. Sensible Speller, off the list last 
month, came back to make a strong fourth-place showing. Super-Text 
Pro is also gaining strength and moved into fifth. 

Screen Writer II, apparently suffering delays in getting the lie ver- 
sion out, dropped to sixth, while Format-II, in a new configuration, is 
coming on strong in seventh. Zardax showed renewed strength in gain- 
ing ninth. 

There was also a fair-sized shakeup in the Home Education 10. Mas- 
terType and Typing Tutor stayed at the top of the list. Apple Logo moved 
up to third, with Sticky bear ABC jumping into fourth. Ernie's Quiz rose 
to fifth, with Stickybear Numbers grabbing a tie for sixth. 

The other sixth-place finisher was Type Attack, regaining the list after 
a month off. Snooper Troops I dropped to a tie for eighth. Rocky' s Boots 
made the list for the first time, with Mix & Match dropping to tenth. 

The education category continues to be the area of strongest growth 
in the Apple market. There were eleven other programs within striking 
distance of the bottom rung of the Education 10 and another dozen just 
slightly behind those.

The Adventure 5 reverted to an earlier form, with the top four pro- 
grams being Infocom entries. Zork I did the best, with Zork II, Suspend- 
ed, and Deadline following. Ultrasoft continued to be the spoiler to 
an all-Infocom category as The Mask of the Sun grabbed fifth, with Zork 
III sixth. 

The Strategy 5 expanded to seven because of a dead heat for fifth 
place. All five programs from last month returned. Also involved in the 
tie were Spitfire Simulator, returning from two months previous, and Old 
Ironsides, another new entry from Xerox Education. 

The Fantasy 5 remains dominated by Wizardry, with Ultima II and 
Knight of Diamonds following. Temple of Apshai and Ali Baba and the 
Forty Thieves rejoined the list, bumping Missing Ring and Ultima. 

There was a significant change in the Business 10. June was the first 
month in the history of the Softalk poll in which VisiCalc was not the 
leading program. PFS. File not only grabbed first, but pulled PFS. Report 
up a notch to fourth. Multiplan continued to stalk VisiCalc, as it moved 
up a notch to third. Quick File He dropped to fifth. 

The Business 10 may be reflecting a change in the composition of 
new Apple owners. Not only is this the first month that VisiCalc has 
failed to head the list, it is also the first month in which a powerful data- 
base program has failed to make the ranks. PFS. File and Quick File He 
qualify as file handlers rather than as database managers. The choice of

cation of widely diverse trends. 

On the one hand, sophisticated users tying into mainframe data-

desktop computers. That some Apples are going in that direction is re- 
flected in the heavy sales of Softerm and Micro/ Terminal.

file handling. That is best seen in the strength of educational software 

sales. 

The Hobby 10 became even more of a Beagle Bros domain, if that's 
possible. In June, they placed six of the ten on the list, including the top 
four. Double-Take stayed on top, with Apple Mechanic and DOS Boss 
tied for second. Utility City was fourth, Pronto DOS was eighth, and 
Typefaces was tenth. 

Even with ail those sales, the Brothers Beagle give no indication of 
getting a shave in the near term. 

The other Hobby 10 programs were long-running veterans — Apple 
Pascal, Zoom Grajix, Graphics Magician, and Bag of Tricks. 

Even as the Hobby 10 is becoming the Beagle Bros Memorial Chart, 
so the Home 10 is becoming the domain of communications programs. 

Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 7.4 percent of all sales of 
Apple and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in July to ascertain their sales for the month of 
June. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was the number of units sold — such other 
criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer store, and personal prefer- 
ences of the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in July represented every geographical area of the continental United 
States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index 
number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is an 
arbitrary measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are cor- 
relative only to the month in which they are printed; readers cannot assume that an in- 
dex rating of 50 in one month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in an- 
other month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus or minus 3.31 percent, which translates roughly 
into the theoretical possibility of a change of 3.58 points, plus or minus, in any index 
number. 




Home Accountant remained by far the leader of the group. Dow 
Jones Market Analyzer moved up to third, and Know Your Apple lie 
nabbed eighth. All the rest were communications packages. 

ASCII Express: The Professional held on to a solid second and even 
moved into the Top Thirty. Data Capture 4.0 was fourth. Softerm and 
Micro/Terminal — packages probably used more in a business environ- 
ment than in the home — scored fifth and sixth respectively.
