HOME MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE FROM ELECTRONIC ARTS 



Cut & Paste. 




Ifyou 




can learn to use this word processor 
in 90 seconds, can it really be any good? 




CUT & PASTE™ displays its commands on a single line at the bottom of the screen. This 
makes working with it easier and also gives you more usable space on the screen. 



Of all word processors on the 
market today, Cut & Paste may 
well be the easiest to use. In 
fact, by the time you finish reading this 
section of the ad, you 'll know how 
to work with Cut & Paste. So read on. 
START TYPING. Working with Cut 
& Paste is like working with a type- 
writer. If you know how to use a type- 
writer, you already know how to type 
in your draft with Cut &. Paste. The 
only real difference is, with Cut & 
Paste it's easier to correct typos. 
MAKING CHANGES. Let's say 
you've decided to make a cut in your 
rough draft.To do this you put the 
cursor (the bright block) at the start 
of the text you want to delete, and 



stretch it through to the end of your 
cut. Then you send the cursor down to 
the"CUT" command on the bottom 
of the screen. Done. 

If, on the other hand, you want 
to keep that line, but put it in a differ- 
ent part of your draft, you use the 
"PASTE'' command. You mark the 
point of insert with the cursor. Then 
you put the cursor over "PASTE." 
That's all there is to it. 
PRINTING IT OUT. When you 
like the way your work looks, you print 
it. Put the cursor on the "PRINT" 
command. Then set your margins, in 
inches. That's it. 

You now know how to use Cut 
& Paste. 



OKAY, IT'S SIMPLE. BUT HOW 
GOOD IS IT? Cut & Paste has all 
the features you'll ever need to use 
at home. Here are a few of them: 

1. Scrolling dynamic menus 

2. Automatic word wrap 

3. Simple cut & paste editing 
4« Block indenting 

5. Set margins and paper size in 
inches 

6. Tabs 

7. Automatic page numbering 

8. Controllable page breaks 

9. Headings 

10. Scrolling text windows 

11. Automatic widow and orphan 
control 

12. Clear and concise manual 
In other words, Cut & Paste 

will do just about everything other 
word processors do. But Cut & Paste 
will do it more easily. Without com- 
plex commands and modes. 

If you think about a word proc- 
essor in terms of what it replaces ( type- 
writers, pens and paper, files), Cut ck 
Paste begins to look very good indeed. 

And when you consider that all this 
power can be had for approximately 
$50, we think you'll see why we believe 
Cut & Paste is something of an 
achievement. 

A PHILOSOPHY OF DESIGN. 

The people who designed, devel- 
oped and programmed Cut & Paste 
have some fairly heavy credentials. 

They are people who worked on 
the internationally-famous user inter - 
face designs that led to the Xerox Star* 
and Apple's Lisa! 1 They are also 




THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD. Until quite recently we used pens and paper 
and typewriters to write with, mostly because we knew how to use them. They have been good 
tools, but limited. You tend to make messes when you work with them, and getting rid of those 
messes makes extra work. Cut & Paste is an inexpensive and practical alternative. Because it is as 
easy to use as a typewriter, you really will use it. Which may make it the first sensible word processor 
for the home. Thus an alleged labor-saving device has come to a position where it really can save a 
significant amount of labor, i.e., yours. 




THE MEN WHO MADE CUT & 

PASTE. The Linotype machine pictured here 
was the 19th century's most important contri- 
bution to word processing technology. It let 
typesetters compose and rearrange text in the 
form of metal castings. The importance of Cut 
& Paste, of course, must await the judgment 
of history. Nevertheless, the seven men who de- 
veloped it look confident here. Standing left to 
right, they are: Norm Lane, Steve Shaw, David 
Maynard, Dan Silva, Steve Hayes and ferry 
Morrison. Seated at the console is Tim Mott, 
whose idea this was in the first place. 

people who have in common a very 
lucid philosophy of design. 

Computers and the programs they 
run are tools, they believe. Tools are 
never noticed unless they are bad tools. 
When they're good, they become, in 
effect, invisible. And if you want to 
make a good tool — an invisible tool — 



you'd best study the way people use 
the tools they already have. 

As a result of this thinking, Cut &. 
Paste was designed to work much in 
the same way that you already work 
with a typewriter or with pen and 
paper. The most complex and power- 
ful parts of the program are hidden 
from view. The work they do takes 
place deep in the machine. All you get 
to see are the results. 

But beyond that, there is something 
almost indefinable about a good de- 
sign. Things about it just seem to work 
crisply. Little touches and features 
that you notice make you want to smile. 

If it's really good, aa x 

it feels good. 

Cut &. Paste 
feels good. Electronic Arts 



THE PRODUCTS of Electronic Arts can 
be found in your favorite computer stores, soft- 
ware centers, and in leading department stores 
throughout the country. Both Cut & Paste 
and Financial Cookbook ™ are now available 
at a suggested retail price of $50 for the Apple 
lie and the Commodore 64 and will soon be 
available for the IBM-PC and Atari. 




OUR COMMITMENT TO 
HOME MANAGEMENT. 

Cut & Paste is just one of a growing 
number of products we're publishing 
within the category of "home manage- 
ment software." These products are all 
built around the same program archi- 
tecture, making them all equally "friend- 
ly," as well as remarkably straightfor- 
ward and practical. We believe that 
designs like these will soon make home 
computers as functional and efficient as 
today's basic appliances. 

Our next product in this line is called 
Financial Cookbook. It's a realistic alterna- 
tive to the complex, pre-programmed fi- 
nancial calculators we all wish we knew 
how to use. With a few, simple keystrokes, 
Financial Cookbook lets you make more 
than 30 key time-value-of-money 
computations — just about all the ones 
you'd ever use for personal finances— 
like calculating 
mortgages with 
changing inter- 
est rates, com- 
pounding the 
interest on IRA 
and savings ac- 
counts, and buy- 
versus - lease 
comparisons for 
automobile pur- 
chases.

management products and about what 
we have planned for the future, call or

STKAKHTALK 




I WAS JUST TUIHKMC 

What do you mean when you say, "Just think. . . .?" 

"Paris in May? Just think what fun it'll be. . . . " 

' 'Just think what it would be like if everyone had a computer. ..." 

' 'You can 't make such an important decision so quickly. Just think 

a minute. ' ' 

"Some of the top math students in this country would have trouble 
passing math in Japan. Just think what that means. " 
Sometimes you mean just about the same as "what if," except that 
it's a what-if about concepts rather than numbers. But not usually. 
Usually, "just think" means consider, think of all the ramifications, go 
to the root of the matter, look for causes and possible solutions, or check 
your premises. 

In Softalk it means all those things: It's the name of a new feature, 
Softalk's first step toward a bit wider scope. It's a from-time-to-time se- 
ries of articles about almost anything that makes a difference in the quali- 
ty of our lives, written by people who have good reason to know and just 
plain good reason— outstanding thinkers, in our industry or out. 

In upcoming issues, you'll learn what Doug Carlston thinks about the 
state of education in the United States, how Steve Wozniak feels about 
piracy and computer crime, what conclusions Jock Root has derived 
about the common links between computer aficionados and science fic- 
tion buffs, and lots more. 

Senior editor David Hunter kicks off Just Think in this issue with the 
story of the most definitive work done to date in the search for proof of 
Albert Einstein's Grand Unification Theory. While it might not make 
much difference to most of us whether everything is one in terms of 
physics and mathematics, the implications of such a theory being true 
call into question our ideas about the very nature of man, about free will, 
about the values and premises by which we guide our lives. 

The microcomputer world is changing, embracing more and more 
people with wide-ranging interests, from multifarious occupations and 
lifestyles. Still, especially in the Apple world, we are a mixture of pio- 
neers and, lately, of the avant garde— settlers of new territory. We're not 
a tiny community anymore, and in only a few years we will be a hun- 
dredfold, or a thousandfold. 

And because we were here first — every one of us who's chosen to use 
a microcomputer up to now and for a handful of months hence— all those 
folds will look to us as leaders. It's a magnificent opportunity to affect 
the quality of life for the better; but we must know where we lead. We 
must look outward, and deep within as well. 

That's why Softalk is broadening it's scope; and that's what Just 
Think is all about. 

We hope you enjoy it and that you will just think with us. h(T

Dealer Inquiries Invited 



A lot of random number generator-hating 
people have been waiting to see the following 
sentence: 

This contest will have no ties. 

Yep. There won't be any ties, because unlike 
a lot of contests recently, this one has no defi- 
nite answer. Instead, entries to this month's 
contest will be examined by a panel of some- 
what distinguished judges (none of them has 
ever been caught watching We Got It Made), 
and they will decide who wins the prize. 

The contest is simple. Think up a fictional 
product for the Apple, and design the package. 
Despite what it says at the top of this page, it 
can be any kind of product— software (games, 
business, communications, education, utility), 
hardware, a book, or . . . whatever. 

It doesn't matter if you're five years old or 
ninety-five years old. Everyone has a chance to 
win. 

You want rules? Okay, here are some: 

1. Most important: The winner of the con- 
test will receive $200 worth of Apple-related 
products made by Softalk advertisers. 

2. Include with your entry a brief descrip- 
tion of what the product is, what it does, and 
how it works. This part won't be judged, but it 
will help in judging the package design and how 
it relates to the product. 

3. This is not just an art contest. That is, 
we're looking for more than just a picture to go 
on a package. We're looking for an actual package 



design— what it would look like sitting on the 
store shelf. That means that in addition to the 
artwork, you should include the product name, 
publisher or manufacturer, creator, and so on. 
Take a look at some of the software or hardware 
packages you have around the computer (or go 
to the store and look at theirs). That's what it 
should look like when you're finished — words 
and stuff. 

Please don't send in just art. Entries with on- 
ly art will be disqualified and fed to the trash 
bin. 

Please don't send complete packages (boxes, 
binders, zip-lock bags). 

Please do send what the front of the package 
should look like. It can be on paper or card- 
board, or it can be a photograph of the package. 

4. To create your package, use anything that 
can be found on the face of the earth. Crayons, 
pens, paints, pastels, grease paint, construction 
paper, cut-outs, stencils, Letraset (rub-off let- 
ters), printing press, anything. 

5. Photography is legal. It's not like the old 
days anymore. BudgeCo, Scarborough Sys- 
tems, and Electronic Arts did some pretty nice 
stuff; if you think you have what it takes, then 
go for it. Remember, don't send in just the pho- 
tograph. You can choose to send in the original 
with all the letterings and miscellaneous junk on 
it, or you can send in a photograph of the origi- 
nal photograph with all the letterings and mis- 
cellaneous junk on it, keeping the original for

Nobody won. There wasn't a contest. 

Normally, we would be announcing the win- 
ner of the first part of Oracle '84 at this time. 
Unfortunately, that part had to be cancelled due 
to Time magazine's refusal to delay the an- 
nouncement of its Man of the Year (despite the 
contest staff's begging, pleading, and general 
whining). 

As we explained last month, Time named 
Ronald Reagan and Yuri Andropov as co-Men 
of the Year a few days before Oracle contest en- 
tries were due. The sods. To get even with 
Time, the contest staff is planning to announce 
the winner of this month's contest a few days 
before Time's contest entries are due. An eye 
for an eye. 

Even though 95 percent of all contestants 
waited for Time's announcement before sending 
in their entries, only a handful claimed that their 
Ron/Yuri predictions were genuine. We'll not 
mention names this time, but remarks on entries 
included, "I think Reagan and Andropov both 
had equal impacts on the world this year. Un- 
likely as it seems, I predict Time will name both 
of them as Man of the Year," and, "This isn't 
fair. I really predicted Reagan and Andropov, 
even though I heard the announcement on the 
radio today." 

But the unofficial winning entry for decep- 
tion came on an entry that was postmarked five 
days late, yet claimed, "I'm entering this contest 
before Time comes out so you know I didn't 
cheat. Ronald Reagan deserves it, but I think 
Time will give it to both Reagan and Yuri An- 
dropov. ' ' Who's got a guilt complex? 

So Far, So-So. Here's a progress report on 
Oracle '84. Remember, sports fans, an Apple 



MacWinner! December's MacContest, part 
of the Storytalk piece "Fat Men Can Not Jump 
down Chimneys," was so easy that only one en- 
trant got the wrong answer. Many entrants took 
the time to painstakingly work out the decoding 
procedures from Sam's two-letter message in- 
cluded in the story . Others looked at how many 
letters were in the two coded words and then 




sunm 



testants request them to be and only if they in- 
clude a stamped, self-addressed mailer. 

9. On the back of your entry, be sure to in- 
clude your name, address, phone number, and a 
list of things you'd like to get with the $200 
prize. 

10. Read and follow rule number nine. 

1 1 . Entries must be postmarked by April 14, 
1984. No exceptions. 

That's it. Get a smock on, get the art sup- 
plies ready, and above all else, have a real good 
time. Send your entry, postmarked no later than 
April 14, 1984, to Softalk Pack, Box 7039, 
North Hollywood, CA 91605. 



Macintosh is at stake here, and this contest will 
decide who will be playing with mouses, win- 
dows, and super-duper hi-res graphics about 
this time next year. 

Time's Man of the Year. Ha! 

Winter Olympics. Well, they're over. See 
this space next month for the winners. 

Academy Awards. In April, millions of peo- 
ple around the world will tune in to see who 
will win what in the film industry, only to fall 
asleep halfway through the show. But thousands 
of Oracle contestants will watch with anticipation 
to see if their predictions come true. 

So far, the consensus seems to be Terms of 
Endearment for Best Picture, Shirley MacLaine 
for Best Actress, and Jack Nicholson for Best 
Actor. Second place looks like Yentl, Meryl 
Streep, and a tie between Robert Duvall and Al 
Pacino. "Sorry ' ' to anyone whose predictions 
include Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, 
Tootsie, Dustin Hoffman, Jennifer Beals, Clint 
Eastwood, or Mr. T (you know who you are). 

Sydney /Juneau. Our correspondents in Ju- 
neau have filed the following weather report: 
"It's kinda cold up here a lot, but sometimes it 
gets warm. April is a weird month, so you nev- 
er can tell." Thanks, gang. 

The contest staffs Australia office couldn't 
be reached, but they did leave a message on the 
answering machine: "Hi. We can't come to the 
phone right now, but it doesn't matter. Must be 
some mistake; you guys don't have an Australia 
office. Leave your message at the beep." 

Indianapolis 500. The biggest potential tie- 
breaker seems to be the Unsers: Al senior, Al 
junior, and Bobby. Most contestants wrote 
"Unser," not bothering to specify which of the 



guessed. The answer was "Merry Xmas." The 
one wrong answer submitted tried to sneak by 
with "Happy Xmas." 

Many entrants to the MacContest astutely 
pointed out that we had inadvertently let slip in- 
to the decoding procedure one minor mistake. 
The mistake was such an obvious one that it 
caused nobody to get the wrong answer. A cou-

three speed demons they meant. If one or more 
of them do finish in the top three, those who 
specified first names will receive the nod. 

A handful of contestants apparently thought 
it was possible to win the Indy 500 without 
finishing in the top three. You know who you 
are— the ones who named three top finishers 
and then a fourth person to win the race. No 
wonder IBM people make fun of Apple users. 

MIT graduates. Didn't anybody bother to 
check what the undergraduate enrollment is at 
MIT? No, it's not possible for more seniors to 
graduate than there are students in the entire 
school. Sure, it would have taken a little extra 
work to find out how many people attend MIT, 
and those who went the extra mile will benefit. 

Wimbledon. Popular choices for number- 
one seeds are John McEnroe and Martina 
Navratilova; the same two are also predicted to 
win. Almost everyone thinks they'll beat Jimmy 
Connors and Chris Evert Lloyd respectively. 

Summer Olympics baseball. Ha-ha to every- 
one who said that there ain't no baseball in the 
Olympics. Traditionally, there's not, but this 
year there is. It's not just an exhibition game, 
either; the Olympic Committee assures us that 
there will be finals in the sport, to be played at 
Dodger Stadium on Tuesday, August 7. 

Apple stock. If you could predict stuff like 
this you wouldn't need to enter contests. 

Billboard Hot 100. As expected, Michael 
Jackson was a big favorite to have the number- 
one single during the first week in October. Sin- 
gles from Jackson's Thriller album sold like 
crazy, but whether he'll have something on the 
charts in October isn't clear. Maybe a soft-drink 
jingle? 

Presidential election. It's Reagan. Just about 
the only non-Reagan predictions were made by 
contestants who wanted to cover all the bases. 

Top Thirty's Top Five. The five most fre- 
quently predicted companies are Broderbund, 
Apple, Beagle Bros, Electronic Arts, and Soft- 
ware Publishing, with Sir-tech, Sierra On-Line, 
and VisiCorp not far behind. Datamost and Siri- 
us even managed to get a few. Seems the only 
folks who don't forget Infocom are the million 
or two who plunk their money on the retailer's 
counter. 

Keep watching the news, read these pages, 
and don't be surprised if someone calls you on 
the phone and says, "Did you ever think you 
would win?" 

That will be somebody from Publisher's 
Clearinghouse Sweepstakes. We usually call 
our winners and say something like "Uh, is Bil- 
ly there?" 

Now go watch the Academy Awards. ~M 



pie of last-minute entrants pointed out that there 
was also no deadline for the contest. In recogni- 
tion of this, all entries were considered eligible 
until the deadline for publishing the winner. 

Which all goes to show that you shouldn't let 
the fiction department stray into the contest- 
meister'sturf. 

The winner was Dave Carse of Hinesburg, 
Vermont, according to the Apple's random 
number generator. He'll be using his $100 prize 
as partial payment for a second Apple disk drive 
from Applied Graphic Co., Shelburne, Ver- 
mont. 31

i 




Writing adventures is not a 
pastime for those lacking in 
intestinal fortitude. In fact, it's an 
endeavor best undertaken by those 
only made of the sternest stuff. 
Pictured here with a research 
consultant is intrepid adventure 
author Antonio Antiochia (on the 
left). Antonio doesn't believe in 
inventing creatures for his stories, 
so he finds them first and interviews 
them at length before incorporating 
them into the fabric of adventure. 
But then Antonio has never done 
things the easy way: all the award- 
winning graphics in his first 
adventure, Transylvania, were 
created using a pair of paddles! 

The subject of his scrutiny is 
Moose, formerly bill collector for 
Vito's Grocery and Book, currently 
unemployed. Moose has been 
kicking around for years, a 
footloose wanderer unwilling to 
discuss pedestrian pursuits of the 
past century. Antonio tracked 
Moose down in the foothills of 
Transylvania while researching the 
upcoming adventure 'The Crimson 
Crown". Needless to say, Moose 
will have a walk-on part. 

Mirror Cracked 
-Shards Lost 

London - Scrolls found under the 
Scattlededum castle earlier this 
month have been dated back to the 
early 1200's. Initial interpretations 
suggest the former presence of a 
"magical" mirror that gave power to 
its possessor. The Coveted Mirror, 
according to the scrolls, was 
cracked while being stolen by the 
then-to-be-king, Voar, and shards 
were scattered throughout the 
nearby kingdom. A piece of glass 
was found next to the scrolls. 

You, too, can join the search for 
The Coveted Mirror, in this 
intriguing and colorfully animated 
adventure from Penguin. 



The Quest™ Quest 

Some time before last July, 
Penguin Software released an 
adventure entitled 'The Quest". Of 
course it had exceptional graphics 
and was well-written, and by early 
1984 it became the best-selling 
adventure game on the market. The 
makers of The Quest, meanwhile, 
were finishing work on its sequel, 
Ring Quest, which is due shortly. 

Now, however, everyone seems 
to be saying "me, too' and hopping 
onto The Quest bandwagon. 
Broderbund announced its 
adventure "BloodQuest" late last 
fall, and it comes highly 
recommended from the folks here at 
Penguin. But now Strategic 
Simulations has announced 
"Questron", Sierra On-Line has 
announced "King's Quest" (not to 
be confused with Ring Quest, 
please), and DataSoft has 
announced 'The Dallas Quest". The 
oddest part of the latter is that the 
name of one the main authors of 
The Quest and Ring Quest is Dallas 
Snell. "The Dallas Quest" is only 
written by James Garon. Couldn't 
they have called it 'The James 
Quest"? Of course, then all that 
licensing money would have gone 
down the tubes. Gee, we didn't 
even have to license our Dallas... 

How can you tell Penguin's 
Quests from the imitators? The 
price. At $19.95, you can afford 
them. 



Frivolous Shorts

frivolous shorts, so here they are. 



Contest 



You may have noticed, while 
reading the small type on some of 
our ads and packages, that penguin 
trivia keeps popping up out of 
nowhere. It started as a joke, when 
a copy writer got bored with all the 
" — is a trademark of — " stuff, and 
started putting little penguin quips 
in the little, tiny type, wondering if 
anyone would notice. They did, 
and all the Penguin copy writers 
started getting into the act. We've 
gone back and we've found 20 of 
these Penguinisms, and started 
wondering if anyone else could, 
too. Since a couple are obscure, our 
contest is that if you are the first 
one in your state (United States), 
province (Canada), or any other 
country to find 18 of these penguin 
facts, well outfit you in an official 
Penguin Software jersey and 
baseball cap. Send in your penguin 
trivia with your name, address, and 
jersey size to Penguinisms, Box 311, 
Geneva, IL 60134. We'll go by 
postmarks if there are two from any 
state. They always say "void where 
prohibited" with things like this, so 
I guess we should, too. Is it 
prohibited anywhere? 

If you're not adventuresome, but 
would still like a snappy Penguin 
jersey and/or cap, you can actually 
order them for $6 each, plus $2 
shipping per order. Send a check 
made out to Penguin Software and 
make sure the jersey size is listed, or 
well even take credit card orders 
for them on our toll-free dealer line, 
(800) 323-0884.

Wanted: Honest, trustworthy 
Penguin lovers who'd enjoy 
stopping in at all your local 
computer stores every couple weeks 
and making a few bucks on the 
side. Send your name, address, 
phone #, and "why I'd like to be a 
penguin" to Penguins, Box 311, 
Geneva, IL 60134. Must be 18 or 
older, and staying in one area for a 
while.

Flash! Double-Res is Here! 



The Virtues of Plain 
Speaking, Take 1. 

Last March we lowered the prices 
of all our games to $19.95. In the 
past couple of months we have 
noticed that other publishers are 
beginning to do the same thing, 
with one significant difference: The 
way they tell you about it! 

Instead of simply putting a 
reasonable price on the cover of the 
games they sell, they charge $30 or 
more and then say "Buy Two, Get 
One Free!" Doesn't that strike you 
as a rather roundabout way to offer 
a game for about $20? 

Furthermore, such "promotions" 
require the customer to send in 
some proof of purchase in order to 
claim the third game. 

At Penguin we believe in straight 
talk and minimum inconvenience 
for our customers. You won't catch 
us forcing you to buy more than 
you want in order to get a decent 
price for a program. Nor will we 
make you wait a couple of weeks to 
get an extra program. 

Instant gratification at a 
reasonable price.

If you can't find one of our 
products at your dealer, call us at 
our toll-free order number and we'll 
find the name of the Penguin dealer 
nearest you. Or if there are none 
you can order with VISA or 
MasterCard. Dealers: if you carry 
our products and purchase through 
a distributor, give us a quick call so 
that we can put you on this 
information list and send customers 
your way.

hints, or from Illinois, Alaska, and

You probably know that new 
Apples have a new graphics mode, 
called double-res, which has twice 
the resolution of standard hi-res, 
and 15 pure colors instead of the 
standard 6. Currently double-res is 
available only with an Apple / /e 
that has the extended 64K 
80-column card. Well, we've been 
working with it for months now, 
and it's beautiful! And now we're 
thrilled to announce that The 
Graphics Magician Picture Painter is 
available in a special double-res 
version. Author Steve Meuse has 
taken the original Graphics 
Magician picture editor and adapted 
it fully to double-res. Furthermore, 
the double-res version can read 
pictures created with the original hi- 
res version of The Graphics 
Magician and automatically enhance 
them with the double-res colors and 
resolution! Since Graphics Magician 




pictures are stored according to the 
artists' moves (not the actual 
screen), these moves are easily 
adjusted by the computer to the 
double-res screen. And blended 
colors from our standard hi-res 
108-color palette can be mapped to 
purer colors in our new 256-color 
double-res palette. The same 
pictures that can be displayed with 
the standard hi-res Magician can 
now take advantage of double-res 
Apples! And, instead of taking 
twice as much disk storage space 
(normal storage for double-res 
requires 16K of disk storage per 
picture) The Graphics Magician 




double-res pictures still take the 
same tiny amount of space as 
Graphics Magician standard hi-res 
pictures. Yes, we're excited! 

To show you how nice double-res 
looks, we are also releasing a special 
edition of the graphic adventure 
Transylvania; one side of the disk 
containing the standard hi-res 
version, the other disk side 
containing the special double-res 
edition. Transylvania has already 
been hailed by Softalk as having the 
best graphics ever in an adventure, 
and been given an award from 
Electronic Games magazine for its 
outstanding achievements in 
graphics. Wait until you see what 
double-res does for it! Some 
samples are shown here on this 
page. The graphics are Antonio 
Antiochia's originals, adapted and 
enhanced with the double-res 
Graphics Magician by Marsha 
Meuse, and programmed to take 
advantage of the extra RAM in a 
double-res Apple by Steve Meuse. 

Watch very soon for the special 
double-res edition of The Complete 
Graphics System, and other Penguin 
Software programs in double-res!

MARCH 1984 SOFTALK^ ^ 



F-A S T A L K 



Fastalk is a quick guide to popular, specialized, 
new, and classic software. When you need a particu- 
lar kind of program or just want to see what's new, 
Fastalk is the place to look for fast answers. 

If a program has been reviewed in Softalk, it car- 
ries the issue date of the review in italics at the end of 
its listing, and the capsule description given reflects 
the published review. 

A new software entry, which must be of profes- 
sional quality to be included, is designated by a check 
mark preceding its name. A new entry loses its check 
mark after its first appearance and drops out of 
Fastalk after one to three appearances (depending on 
genre) if it fails to gain popularity. 

A bullet preceding a title indicates a program that 
Softalk has designated as a classic, based on its ability 
to stand up over time, its significance for its time 
(breaking new ground or introducing a new genre), or 
its archetypal qualities. 

Other entries in Fastalk are there either by virtue 
of current activity (the programs are selling at least as 
much as the least-selling entry on any of the bestseller 
charts) or because they are representative of the best 
of programs for a special interest or need (such as 
card games or non-Basic-specific language terminal 
programs). 

Softalk may arbitrarily omit any package from 
Fastalk, whether or not it meets the foregoing 
criteria.

QUARK INTRODUCES 

CATALYST™ I \e 



The Only Hard Disk 
Program Selector 
for the Apple He and 
Apple II Plus. 



V*" * -- 





A hard disk makes your Apple He or 64K Apple 
II Plus even more powerful. And makes you even 
more productive. But you still have to load a new 
floppy and reboot when you need to change programs. 
And the more programs you have, the more time 
you waste. 

That's why Quark developed Catalyst™ He^^. 
A unique ProDOS program selector that lets you 
switch between even copy-protected programs. 
Without rebooting. A few keystrokes move you 
from Word Juggler lie to your spreadsheet, then to 
your file management system, and so forth. 

The convenient menu lists the programs you've 
stored on your hard disk, organized in any way you 
wish. You can automatically install virtually any 



© 1983, Quark Incorporated 



programs which use Apple's new ProDOS operating 
system. Including software from Quark, Apple 
Computer and other leading manufacturers. You can 
even load CP/M programs on the menu, when you 
use the CP/M CARD from Advanced Logic Systems. 

Catalyst He is an affordable $149. So see your 
favorite dealer today for a complete demonstration. 
And while you're there, look into Quark's other office

TAX WHACKER! 



Whack your taxes with Money Street. You qet 
neat, clean reports of income, deductions, 
and tax credits... all automatically. No more lost 
deductions or unreported income. 

Money Street cuts the data-gathering tast from 
hours to minutes. Besides saving time, Money 
Street saves CPA write-up fees and ends tax-time 
frustration. 

Money Street also tracks business or farm income, 
capital gains, and more. You get ready-to-transfer 
totals for your 1040. 

If you file a Schedule "A", Money Street tallys all 
your deductions: medical, interest, taxes, and more. 
You get "ready to post" totals, plus a listing of all 
detail items. 

If you run a small business, Money Street will 
automatically list and total all income and expense 
items for Schedule "C". 

Money Street also keeps records of estimated taxes 
paid, tax credit items, and credit card expenses. 

Besides all this, you can generate detailed lists of 
unusual income or deductions to include with your 
tax returns. (Some items, such as extra large 
medical expenses, can trigger an audit, but a 
detailed listing can sometimes forestall such an 
audit.) 

In case of audit, you'll be glad you've got Money 
Street to print important back-up information: 
(1 ) An easy-to-access cancelled check file, (2) A 
month-by-month "proof of balance" report, (3) A 
check and deposit register, (4) An item-by-item 
listing of your entire checkbook. 

You'll walk into your audit with bullet proof records 
that will impress the most cynical IRS agent. You'll 
have fast, accurate answers to any question about 
checking account records. 

And remember, Money Street prints everything as a 
by-product of checkbook balancing. The data is 
already in your computer, so all reports discussed 
can be printed by pressing but three keys. 

Money Street won't replace your CPA or calculate 
your taxes, but it will make tax time much easier 
since it automatically gathers most of your tax data.

The Accountant, and PFM, I finally have a 
simple, straight forward, speedy program. The

the warm support and approval of those who 
recognize the beauty of simplicity." Alan Thai,

Money Street's most amazing feature 

is its "real time" data bank. It accumulates year-to- 
date totals for each of the 100 categories. You see 
these totals instantly. Just enter a check, and look 
at the bottom of the screen. The year-to-date total 
will flash into view with each new entry. 

Pays for itself. Money Street keeps things 
simple and keeps them honest. It can pay for itself 
ten times over just by saving the cost of organizing 
and totaling data. As one customer put it: "Why 
pay my $100-an-hour CPA to count beans?" 

Money Street.. .It's totally new. 

If you own real estate, Money Street tracks rents, 
tallies repair costs, and helps establish "cost basis"

THE BUG STOPS HERE. 

Introducing 

BUG OFF! 

Pascal Debugging System from First Byte. 

One little bug can shoot your whole day. 

So why not call in The Swat Team's Bug Off! and shoot first. 

It charges through your Pascal program at near execution speed, 
looking for bugs. 

To monitor variable values or invoke any other error detection 
facility, just put breakpoints where you want them in the program. 
When Bug Off! encounters a breakpoint, it halts execution and dis- 
plays a command screen. 

The command screen puts you in charge of bug extermination. 
You can command Bug Off! to cautiously step forward one instruc- 
tion at a time. You can trace the execution path. Or you can execute 
a predefined macro that you've built, list a text file to the screen, 
ignore or observe future breakpoints, yell for more HELP and much 
more. It's totally interactive. 

In short, Bug Off! makes short work of bugs. In fact, it makes 
short work of writing reliable programs. And when you spend less 
time agonizing over errors, you have more time to be creative. 
It even helps with documentation and future program maintenance. 

For complete information or to order, call First Byte, Inc., toll free at 

(800) 523-8070 

in California (800) 624-2692, or use the handy order form. 
It's time you learned about bug murder, execution style.

System Saver didn't become the 
Apple's number one selling 
peripheral by being just a fan. 



What made over 100,000 Apple" owners fall in 
love with System Saver? The answer is simple. 
It's the most versatile, most convenient, most 
useful peripheral ever made for the Apple. 

System Saver niters out damaging AC line 
noise and power surges. 

70-90% of all microcomputer malfunctions can be • 
traced to power line problems* * Problems your 
System Saver guards against. 

Power line noise can often be interpreted as data. 
This confuses your computer and produces system 
errors. Power surges and spikes can cause severe 
damage to your Apple's delicate circuitry and lead 
to costly servicing. 

System Saver clips surges and 
spikes at a 130 Volts RMS/175 
Volts dc level. A PI type filter 
attenuates common and 
transverse mode noise by a 
minimum of 30 dB from 600 
kHz to 20 mHz with a max- 
imum attenuation of 50 dB. 
You end up with an Apple 
that's more accurate, more 
efficient and more reliable. 

SYSTEM SAVER 



System Saver lets your Apple keep its cool. 

Today's advanced peripheral cards generate heat. In 
addition, the cards block any natural air flow through 
the Apple lie creating high temperature conditions 
that shorten the life of the Apple and peripheral cards 

System Saver's efficient, quiet 
fan draws fresh air across 
the mother board, over 
the power supply and 
out the side ventilation 

slots. It leaves your Apple cool, calm and running 

at top speed. 





System Saver makes your Apple more 
convenient to use. 

No more reaching around to the back of your Apple 
to turn it on. No more fumbling for outlets and cords 
to plug in your monitor and printer. System Saver 
organizes all your power needs. 



So if you want to keep 
damaging heat, line noise and power surges out of 
your system for good, pick up the only peripheral 
that's in use every second your computer is in use. 
The System Saver. You'll soon come to think of it as 
the piece Apple forgot. 

Compatible with Apple stand 



MONITOR 



APPLE n 






It functions as a multi-outlet power strip with two 
switched outlets. Plus System Saver offers the 
ultimate convenience; a front mounted power switch 
for fingertip control of your entire system.

gramming your Apple in BASIC. The 
approach presents the BASIC lan- 
guage as a problem-solving tool, 
which gives you quick, easy, and use- 
ful results. It shows how to more 
effectively write programs starting 
simply then proceeding to more 
complex ideas.

JUST BECAUSE YOU PICK AN APPLE, 



DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO 
BUY THE WHOLE ORCHARD. 



The only thing more important than 
having your printer compatible with 
your personal computer is having it 
compatible with you. 

Which is why mixing an Okidata 
printer with your Apple computer is 
more like mixing apples with apples 
than you'd think. 

More Printers. More Printing. For 
instance, Okidata gives you eight high 
performance printers to choose from. 
Apple only gives you four. We give you 
two-color capabilities on some models. 
They give you basic black and white. 
With Okidata you can get three print 
modes. With Apple, you're stuck with 
one. Our speeds go up to an incredible 
350 cps. Theirs stop at 1 20. 

As for quality, our correspondence 
quality rivals the best daisywheels. And 



at up to 80 cps. Their letter quality 
printer is a daisywheel but moves along 
at only 40 cps. We also give you a full 
year's warranty on our print head. They 
give you 90 days. And we bring you the 
lowest warranty claim rate in the indus- 
try: less than Vi%. 

And More: Personal Touch & Plug n 
Play. With Okidata's Microline 92, 93 
and 84 printers, you can get Personal 
Touch. A downline loading software 
package that lets you print personalized 
characters, customized symbols and 
typefaces, even foreign languages. From 
Apple, you only get the hardware. 

Of course all Okidata printers are 
compatible with Apple computers. But 
now, all Okidata Microline printers in- 
terface in a matter of minutes, thanks to 
our new Plug n Play interface kit. 



So, the choice is yours. Wait for a bet- 
ter Apple to ripen. Or pick Okidata.

One in Five 

I purchased Advanced Logic Systems 's Smar- 
term II eighty-column board about seven 
months ago to use with Apple Writer II. Unfor- 
tunately, I was unable to use the board immedi- 
ately due to a software problem. After contact- 
ing ALS about my problem, they immediately 
sent me a preboot disk that arrived within the 
week and worked as advertised. 

Recently I decided to change my word proc- 
essor to Magic Window II, as it was advertised 
to work with many eighty -column boards, in- 
cluding the Smarterm II, and had many of the 
features that I was looking for at the time. Much 
to my dismay, I was unable to boot the program 
in the eighty-column mode. Not wanting to give 
up Magic Window II completely, I resigned 
myself to using it in the seventy-column mode. 

Remembering my good experience with Ad- 
vanced Logic Systems in the past, I decided to 
give those folks a call to see if they could help 
me. (My attempts to discuss the problem with 
Artsci led nowhere.) I was pleasantly surprised 
when the technician on the phone was immedi- 
ately able to tell me what the problem was. Ap- 
parently the ROM on the old ALS Smarterm II 
was unable to work with the Magic Window II 
software. I was told a new ROM would correct 
the problem. I prepared myself for the worst 
and asked what it would cost. "No charge" was 
the reply. Sure enough, three days after my 
conversation I was using the program in the 
eighty-column mode. 

I hope this is the direction that all software 
companies are taking. For every letter like this, 
I could write five noting the bad experiences I 
have had in attempts to obtain help from various 
companies. To Advanced Logic Systems, I say: 
Well done!

Killer Assembler Updated 

Six months ago, I purchased ORCA/M, the 
6502 assembler from Hay den Software. I ex- 
pected, as advertised, a high-quality tool for 
producing efficient machine language pro- 
grams. That is exactly what I received, and I 
have been very satisfied with ORCA ever since. 
I couldn't have asked for more, but I got more. 
I recently received an upgrade kit from Hay den, 
updating my 3.4 release to the new ORCA/M 
3.5. The new release incorporates all of the 
features of the new 65C02 processor, an eighty- 
column driver for the He, and fixes for bugs 
found in release 3.4. The package also includes 
all necessary updates to the reference manual, 
three technical bulletins, and a newsletter. In 
addition, Hay den made available to ORCA users 
a special offer for 65C02 processor chips. 



Discussion 



I have seen a lot of letters in this column 
about Apple owners who have requested and re- 
ceived exceptional service, but never have I 
heard of such service being received spon- 
taneously, without a maintenance contract or 
any action on the part of the user. I've been a 
systems programmer on a large IBM mainframe 
for a long time, and this is better service than I 
have ever seen from any software vendor (in- 
cluding IBM, which is famous for service). I 
hope that Hayden Software sets an example that 
many others will follow. They've made a life- 
long customer out of me. 
Ron Richardson, Syracuse, NY 

Hear Him Chuckle 

Softalk's listing of bestselling software is inter- 
esting and well-intentioned. However, it tallies 
only software sold through Apple dealers, and 
in this regard may be misleading. I purchased 
the Circascript software from Circadian Soft- 
ware in answer to an advertisement in the maga- 
zine. Since it was not on the Bestsellers list, I 
felt I might obtain an inferior product. 

On the contrary, I use this software every 
day for wills, business agreements, letters, bill- 
ings, and office schedules. With all that I do 
with Circascript, I can't think of anyone who 
could put it through a greater test. It has served 
me very well. I chuckle each time I read Sof- 
talk, thinking that my competition is purchasing 
the other software. I pat myself on the back for 
taking the time to shop around for mine. 

Readers should be put on notice that the 
Bestsellers list does not include software sold 
directly by the manufacturer. 
Robert P. Gasparro, Philadelphia, PA 

More Fun in the Graphics World 

MasterChart, by Spectral Graphics Software, is 
one of the best values I have found in more than 
two dozen software purchases during the past 
year. The program allows the user to make two- 
or three-dimensional bar or pie graphs and con- 
tains a module for generating line graphs as 
well. Best of all, it has a graphics processor that 
permits the user to customize graphs and charts 
by printing or drawing on them with point-by- 
point control. Considering the fact that the 
graphics processor can also be used to create 
shape tables and construct graphic scenes on a 
blank screen for dumping to a printer, the very 
reasonable price is amazing in a market of super- 
inflated prices. Hats off to Spectral Graphics for 
an exceptional software value! 
William Ickes, Arlington, VA 

Not Altogether Lost in the Flood 

The November Softalk contains a letter from 
Robert L. Stein reporting problems with his 
Vista V1200 disk drive. Mr. Stein's letter sug- 
gests that the laudatory review of the Vista 
VI 200 that appeared earlier in Softalk was in 
fact misleading. My experience with the Vista 
VI 200 is in conformity with that of the reviewer 
and does not agree with the experience of Stein. 

I have been using a Vista VI 200 for more 
than six months and have been extremely satis- 
fied with its performance. I have had some dif- 



ficulty when the relative humidity reached 
above the 80 percent level, recommended in the 
Vista manual as the maximum level of relative 
humidity in which the machine should be used. 
This is the only trouble that I have had, and it's 
offset by the tremendous advantages offered in 
the replaceability of the cartridges. My prin- 
cipal reason for writing this letter is the respon- 
siveness that I have had in dealing with the Vista 
Computer Company. It has been extremely 
helpful in dealing with my inquiries. It is impor- 
tant for this kind of word-of-mouth advertising 
to be circulated among users who have been al- 
most totally deserted by dealers, at least in 
terms of support, and who face a constant flood 
of misleading advertising. 
Leroy O. Stone, London, Ontario, Canada 

No, We Don't Think You're a Printer Pirate 

I recently received a used Okidata U82A printer 
as a gift. Unfortunately, as with most used 
equipment, the manual was not included. I 
wrote a letter to the consumer products division 
at Okidata, knowing they would probably toss it 
aside. Much to my surprise, I received a new 
manual in less than two weeks. Incidentally, the 
manual is very well written and the product per- 
forms very well. 
Mike Heppler, Oxnard, CA 

All Spelled Out 

I would like to thank Softalk for the review (Jan- 
uary 1984) of MegaSpell, the spelling checker 
companion to MegaWriter for the Apple II and 
He, published by Megahaus. As the reviewer, 
Matthew Yuen, correctly points out, MegaSpell 
is indeed trivially easy to use and is an excellent 
companion to MegaWriter. He even goes so far 
as to say that our manual is not needed. A com- 
pliment indeed, although not entirely justified. 
If the reviewer had taken the time to read our 
manual, he might have avoided making a num- 
ber of factual errors in his review. 

It was erroneously reported that "MegaSpell 
is nearly impossible" to use with one disk 
drive. This is wrong. MegaSpell works very 
well with one disk drive, with very little disk 
swapping, provided that the user follows the in- 
structions given on page 26 of our manual. 

Yuen also concludes — from our advertis- 
ing—that we claim that MegaSpell can spell the 
word supercalifragilisticexpialidocious and that 
we then misspell it as supercalifragowisticex- 
pialidocious in the program. Wrong, Mr. Yuen! 
Walt Disney Productions owns the word super- 
califragilisticexpialidocious (from Mary Pop- 
pins, if you recall). The word we use is of our 
own invention, though admittedly similar to the 
Disney word, and our invented word appears 
both in our ad and in our dictionary. This is a 
trivial error on Yuen's part, but a possible in- 
dication of how thorough he is as a reviewer. 

Finally, I noticed that Yuen takes a few 
passing potshots at MegaWriter. It makes me 
wonder why he did not make the same criti- 
cisms when he reviewed MegaWriter back in 
August and concluded that "this is a rather 
good program; the pluses are strong, the 
minuses are small." Since then we have intro- 



36 

duced an even better version of MegaWriter for 
the Apple that reads both Apple DOS and Pascal 
text files, boots in less than twenty seconds, 
works effortlessly with one or two disk drives, 
and automatically configures itself to make full 
use of either the Apple II or He keyboard with- 
out any intervention by the user. 

I appreciate the many positive and accurate 
remarks he made about MegaSpell. I hope this 
will set straight the few factual errors that were 
made. 

Paul R. Stannard, president, Megahaus, San 
Diego, CA 

Disney also owns Mary Poppins. And we spell it 
that way, too. 

Taking His Reactions to Heart 

As president of Datamost, publisher of The 
Market Technician, I feel that I must comment 
on the overly harsh and unjustified review of 
our program that appeared in Buttonwood Ap- 
ples (November Softalk). 

Ken Landis felt that the program "did not 
work" because data for individual stocks that 
he entered could not be graphed. If Landis had 
acted like a normal purchaser and called us, he 
would have found that his early version of the 
program did experience some problems and he 
would have immediately received a revised ver- 
sion at no cost. I must emphasize that the pro- 
gram can and does graph individual stock data, 
including all programs distributed since the 
early summer of 1983. 

Landis also has problems with the fact that 




mum 



data on the five-year database must be compiled 
before use. The Market Technician is both a 
stock market database and an analysis program, 
and it is quite common in a database program to 
have to set up the search criteria manually 
before searching the database. Since the power- 
ful search feature does present the user with 
many options, we felt that a separate compiler 
section was the most efficient and useful man- 
ner in which to approach the task. Moreover, 
Mr. Landis neglected to mention that in this 
compiler module there is an automatic feature 
that permits the stock market indexes to be com- 
piled from the database automatically. Also, 
since each individual stock data file contains 
only 120 days of data (which can be graphed 
and thus easily viewed), we felt it totally un- 
necessary to modify the database search func- 
tion to operate on the stock files. 

Landis complains that the program does not 
make the most effective use of a two-drive sys- 
tem, as certain data files must be on the disk in 
drive one. For the most part, this decision was 
made to minimize the disk swapping that would 
occur in drive two if certain data files were not 
stored on the disk in drive one. It is also bene- 
ficial to those many users who may not have 
two disk drive systems. Moreover, the fact that 
the program is not protected permits use of the 
program disk for storage, as there is no chance 
of destroying or damaging an irreplaceable disk. 

Landis also complains about a lack of error 
checking of the Dow Jones data the program 
receives from the Dow Jones News/Retrieval 
Service. We feel that it is impossible to perform 
a complete check, as there is no way for the pro- 
gram to know whether the price of a stock is 
really $57.00 (when it should have been 
$58.00) if a transmission problem caused the 
error. These errors can only be found by the 
user and are often obvious when the stock data 
is graphed. 

Most of Landis's other comments (such as 
the fact that he thought the menu was distract- 
ing, or there should have been numbers next to 
the menu choices) are, we believe, minor and 
express a single user's preference as to how a 
program should be designed. A number of his 
other comments are constructive and, as sug- 
gested, will be taken to heart. 

Overall, however, I feel that the current ver- 
sion of The Market Technician offers more for 
less than other similar programs on the market. 
It is being used by many satisfied customers and 
did not deserve the treatment afforded it by Ken 
Landis. 

David Gordon, president, Datamost, Chats- 
worth, CA 

Starfire Wars 

On October 19, I ordered Casino Master from 
Starfire Games, a division of Omnisoft Corpo- 
ration. Enclosed with the order was my check in 
the amount of $37.22. This order was in re- 
sponse to an advertisement in the October Sof- 
talk. 

Since that date, my check has been cashed 
and returned with my bank statement. I have re- 
quested, by mail, that Starfire Games fill my or- 
der or refund my money. I have had no re- 
sponse. 

Wayne L. Strickler, Pleasanton, CA 



MARCH 1984 



On October 8, I sent a money order in the 
amount of $34.95 to Starfire Games for the 
game Global Thermonuclear War. I have not 
received the game, nor has the company re- 
sponded to my inquiry as to the cause of the de- 
lay. I inquired at my bank and discovered that 
the company cashed the money order in No- 
vember. Since the company advertised in your 
magazine, I assumed it was a reputable one. 
Now, however, I have doubts. I also believe 
that I must not be the only one to have had a 
problem with Starfire Games. 
Mrs. Eugene Kretkowski, Bayonne, NJ 

No Nukes Please 

I was appalled to see the advertisement on page 
353 of the December Softalk. The full-page 
color ad describes a "game" of global thermo- 
nuclear war, with "full color graphics, exciting 
animation, and realistic sound effects. . . . You 
watch enemy strikes against your homeland 
and the casualties grow to staggering propor-

Our country is struggling with the nightmare 
of a nuclear war that is all too possible. For 
anyone who has given this topic a moment of 
serious thought, it is not a subject to treat in a 
trivial and flippant way. It is even more obscene 
for a company to capitalize on the threat of nu- 
clear war. While the children of this generation 
are plagued with emotional problems stemming 
from fears for their future, Starfire Games tries 
to make a fast buck. 

Has the computer business become so ob- 
sessed with profit in its swelling market that 
it has forgotten all constraint and social con- 
science?

tists, Cambridge, MA 

No Loco Motive for Training 

As a regional sales manager, I travel widely. As 
a computer user, I visit many computer stores in 
the eastern half of the country. Recently I be- 
came interested in getting a spelling correction 
program to use with Apple Writer lie. I had no 
idea how dictionary programs worked and no 
idea what was available for my Apple He. After 
two months of travels and visits to seven com- 
puter stores, all that I know about such pro- 
grams I've found in magazines and not in com- 
puter stores. 

In Minneapolis, Minnesota, a young fellow 
allegedly called his Apple distributor because 
he was unsure what might be available to run on 
the He. He reported that Apple was planning to 
introduce such a program this fall, but he could 
not help me immediately. 

In Charlotte, North Carolina, I visited four 
shops. The first, an Apple dealer, was totally 
unaware of any spelling checker program for 
the Apple. The second, a software-only shop, 
had nothing for the Apple at the time but told 
me Sierra On-Line would be bringing out just 
the thing, called The Dictionary. However, a 
December 1982 computer magazine reported 
that Sierra On-Line had a program called The 
Dictionary available then. This is a new pro- 
gram? In the third shop, again an Apple dealer, 
a young woman was totally unprepared to dem- 
onstrate the program. She told me that it would 
be best if I sat down and took a couple of hours

to read through the documentation. I compared 
this to buying a car by reading the folder at the 
dealership without looking at or riding in the 
car; she failed to grasp the meaning of. my com- 
parison. At the last shop I tried in Charlotte, 
again an Apple dealership, they were not aware 
of any such program. Did I want a dictionary 
program or a spelling checker? I didn't know 
there was a difference, so I couldn't tell them 
what I wanted. If I couldn't tell them what I 
wanted, how did I expect them to help me? 
Could I perhaps come back when I knew what I 
wanted? 

Back in Columbus, Ohio, it has been much 
the same. A young saleswoman could not get 
Sensible Speller to boot. She was trying to boot 
the dictionary disk instead of the program disk! 
Even after we corrected that, the program still 
would not boot. She decided that the He we 
were using had too many cards in it. I left. In 
another shop, the young lady assigned to me by 
the sales manager was unable to get the program 
Sensible Speller up and running, but I felt she 
showed promise. I can identify with a salesper- 
son who says, "I don't know, but I will find out 
and report back. ' ' A week later I called to make 
an appointment with her. I was told she was in 
class and couldn't be disturbed for a customer. 
She may have a good attitude, but her employer 
certainly doesn't! 

I have been in sales for eighteen years. Per- 
haps I am too demanding, but I find it hard to 
deal with salespeople who are totally unin- 
formed about a product. The wisest thing any 
computer company could do to increase sales 
would be to implement a salesmanship training 
course for its dealers and their people.

Us versus Them 

With the increasing polarization between the 
U.S.S.R. and the U.S., perhaps a nonmilitary 
way of intimidating the Soviet government 
should be attempted. If micros could be sold in- 
ternationally to heavily populated countries, 
such as China and India, maybe we could intim- 
idate the U.S.S.R. through sheer knowledge. 
Some of the finest minds may as yet be unex- 
posed to the microcomputer. These potential 
programmers could provide us with a viable at- 
tempt at promoting the free enterprise system. 
The Third World could well determine the fu- 
ture of capitalism versus socialism. 

If we can put Apples into homes in socialist 
China, there could be a potential market never 
realized before. Both India and China are lo- 
cated in strategic areas that could prove truly 
beneficial to our position. Certainly the ideas of 
Karl Marx were developed years before the 
computer age. The workers now are more 
white-collar than Marx ever envisioned. The 
computer revolution would then have a totally 
different meaning. 

Apple can blow away IBM in the home com- 
puter market if the company would only be- 
come involved with educating the less fortunate 
people all over the world. But then, maybe not.

Eight Good Slots 

I read with great interest the interview with 
Steve Wozniak in the December Marketalk 



News column. I have an Apple II Plus, so his 
comments struck a keen note for me. Descrip- 
tions of the upcoming Macintosh had piqued my 
current microcomputer art interests until I read 
that article. A He upgrade plug-in board, twen- 
ty-four-bit addressing, and sixteen megabytes of 
memory for the II Plus would certainly be a 
boon to us "pioneers." Today's marketing phi- 
losophy on micros seems to be the same one 
used for cars in the fifties and sixties (that is, 
buy a new one every two or three years). 

I certainly agree with Woz's philosophy. Af- 
ter all, the reason I bought an Apple computer 
three years ago was so I could fill up those eight 
slots as my knowledge and interests grew. I 
hope (fingers crossed) that corporate Apple 
listens to Woz so that the things discussed in 
your article do come to fruition.

A Tree Grows in Microcomputerdom 

Thanks for running "City Trees— Apples Make 
a Case for Urban Forestry" (August Softalk). 
We have since sent our forestry software to 
more than two dozen people located all over the 
United States and Canada, and as far away as 
Australia. Encouraged by this success, I am 
currently at work improving the model for a 
future release. I hope that our collaboration has 
inspired others to put their Apples to work for 
environmental causes. I also want to thank Den- 
nis Briskin, author of the article and a good 
friend, for showing us that with words in print, 
one can reach across the globe. One difficulty 
we have had is that not all of our users have the 
Pascal system, and the boot disk is required to 
use our programs, as they are written in Pascal. 
If anyone has software that converts p-code into 
machine code usable by Basic, I would appreci- 
ate hearing from you through Open Discussion.

Bugabooboo 

"Boxing the Bugaboos" by Bill Parker (De- 
cember Softalk) treats a subject of great interest 
to me as the owner of an Epson MX-80. I even 
paid excessively for that supposed new printer 
manual , MX Printer Manual with Graftrax. I 
feel that "Boxing the Bugaboos" suffers from 
the same lack of specific information that too 
often characterizes such articles and many 
manuals. 

It fails to state which Epson models the au- 
thor is writing about or which model of Apple it 
refers to. It does not mention the fact that the 
Basic listing makes no attempt to print lower- 
case letters. It doesn't work for my MX-80; it 
won't even turn on emphasized mode as writ- 
ten. (I know my printer doesn't have italics.) 

By the time I got through, I had to run one of 
my programs that does work to convince myself 
the printer was still working.

Epson Down Under Confusion 

I'm confused. I just read the article on the Ep- 
son (October Softalk) and have just discovered 
that my Epson MX-80 Type II printer doesn't 
exist. Or maybe it does, but America hasn't dis- 
covered it. 

You see, my MX-80 (quite standard, I as- 
sure you, with no hardware modifications) can 
print characters in normal, emphasis (which can 
be locked on), expanded, condensed, and 
double-strike type (not in the Type II manual). 
Programmable form feed, horizontal tabbing, 
line spacing and right margin, MSB control 
(with the help of a machine-code routine in the 
Epson 8132 interface manual), foreign alphabet 
symbols, home-printhead, delete-type back- 
spacing, skip-over perforation control, and hi- 
res screen dumps and "line" graphics are all 
standard. 

It does not have italics, block graphics, 
superscripting or subscripting, underlining, or 
unidirectional printing. I'm not sure whether it 
has redefinable escape codes or not. 

Is my printer a "standard" model? If not, 
how can I upgrade (or downgrade) it to a stan- 
dard model? Here in Australia, when they were 
still selling MX-80s there was never such a 
thing as a Graftrax chip. Our Aussie versions 
were either Type II or not.

False Advertising 

In regard to Marketalk Reviews: Please don't 
put the picture of a software package in the col- 
umn's masthead and then not include it in the 
reviews! I looked through the December re- 
views five times trying to find Dollars and 
Sense\ I'd like to see a one-page recap of the 
products reviewed each month at the end of the 
column like Jerry Pournelle's User Column in 
Byte. This would be easy to photocopy and keep 
in a reference file. In addition, although I know 
the descriptions in Fastalk give the month that a 
product is reviewed, I would also like to see a 
page number. Many reviews appear in articles 
rather than in the review section. 

Bill Budge's Graphics Page is great, and I 
love Open Discussion. In all the magazines I 
read, the latter is one of my favorite columns.

Hobbling Hobbyist 

In response to David V. Luzi (October Open 
Discussion): I too was once very curious about 
the ASCII character codes listed in the Apple 
Reference Manual. It wasn't too many years 
ago (before 1974) when I first built my own 
computer. Back then, we were known as com- 
puter hobbyists, because nobody took us seri- 
ously. And indeed, why should you be taken 
seriously when your money and time were all 
wrapped up in what looked like a 1940 version 



of a crystal radio set? Well, like those earlier 
radios that brought us into the world of the fifty- 
dollar stereo, so the earlier computers made 
way for today's personal computers. It was hob- 
byists that started Apple and other personal 
computer companies. 

We hobbyists had to create or borrow hard- 
ware and software from existing systems and 
make them work. (If you want some real good 
reading, try some of the pre- 1977 computing 
magazines; you'd be surprised at the equipment 
and software problems we had to deal with.) 
One of the key problems was inputting the pro- 
grams. Most of us used toggle switches and 
loaded everything, and I mean everything, into 
memory one byte at a time (that includes the 
operating system, since PROMs were too ex- 
pensive then). Hobbyists with some capital had 
the chance to interface TTY terminals to their 
systems. Sure, they still had to toggle in the 
operating system and have the smarts to inter- 
face the TTY, but after that they worked great. 
Maybe that's why the fanciest game program 
around was Ping-Pong. At any rate, the char- 
acter codes established for those communica- 
tion terminals are still used in today's keyboard 
codes. These character codes were established 
as a standard by the American National Stan- 
dards Institute (ANSI), which gives the com- 
plete definition of each character code used. 



To save readers money and postage, I'll try 
to cover those character codes that are ap- 
plicable to the Apple. Understand that even 
though these character codes are standardized, 
it does not mean that they must be used as de- 
fined. They were written to be used for infor- 
mation interchange among processing systems 
over communication equipment. Therefore, the 
codes reflect this type of communication and 
not that of keyboard to CPU. This is true not 
only for Apple, but for every other make of per- 
sonal computer. Only those codes that are used 
by a computer company are conformed to; all 
others are modified as needed. Though the 
codes stay, don't assume the meaning; look 
them up. 

In the accompanying chart, I've listed the 
character code mnemonic, the ASCII definition, 
character code representative (hex), and the Ap- 
ple Reference Manual definition. A blank in the 
place of the reference manual definition means 
that the character code is not supported by Ap- 
ple lis. Also note that not all of the manual's 
definitions agree with the ASCII definitions. 
(By the way, character code "em" has a lot of 
potential usage, so look at this one closely.) 

Good information sources are user groups; 
some companies are large enough to have one, 
or need one. My user group meets during the 
lunch hour, and we have done a lot even without

Alaskan Trader 

To respond to Kim McCartney (November 
Open Discussion): I have been trading com- 
modities for over two years using an Apple. I'm 
trading programs I have developed, along with 
data acquisition and management routines that 
have evolved from some commercial software 
that is no longer available — but didn't work well 
as supplied anyway. Most of the software I've 
bought hasn't worked. I've been able to write 
what I want, as I have extensive prior experi- 
ence in this area. A routine to plot commodity 
prices with moving averages is included in the 
Quicktrieve system supplied by Commodity 
Systems (Boca Raton, FL). The package also 
includes data acquisition software and is a part 
of their data sales effort. I have recently used 
this software and found it to be functional and 
bug free.

Logo in Print 

In response to Roy Freborg's dilemma of print- 
ing Logo without a graphics card (January 1984 
Open Discussion), I can offer a solution. After 
loading Logo, load the procedure you wish to 
print and call it to the screen. Then remove your 
file disk, insert Printographer, and give the 
command .printer 6. Printographer will boot, 
but you will not lose the picture in memory. 
Choose "edit picture in memory" from the 
menu and make your other selections, crop- 
ping as desired. Choosing inverse will save rib- 
bons. This seems cumbersome, but even with a 
graphics card, printing Logo designs is time- 
consuming.

Without Delay 

I am writing in response to James Frey's letter 
(November Open Discussion) concerning the 
ALS Smarterm II and Compular's Apple Writer 

II preboot. I also have a Smarterm, Apple 
Writer II, and Compular's preboot disk, but I 
have not encountered the delay Mr. Frey has 
between keystroke and the character's appear- 
ance on the screen. I advise him to check what 
version he has. Mine is Version 1.2 and it 
works perfectly. With an eighty-column dis- 
play, Apple Writer II is hard to beat. 

Also, have any more experienced Smarterm 
II users come across the foreign language 
character sets or custom graphics mentioned in 
the specifications in the back of the manual? 

Why is it that when you list around hex loca- 
tion C030, the speaker clicks several times? Is 
this the area of memory that controls the speak- 
er, and if so why does it click? I was only look- 
ing at those values, not changing them. And 
then if you list up to C080, the computer hangs 
totally, requiring a power down. If anyone can 
answer any of my questions, I would really 
appreciate it.

Tractor on Track 

In response to Karl F. Thompson (November 
Open Discussion), who mentioned that he was 
having problems with the tractor feed on his 
Okidata 93 dot-matrix printer: I recently pur- 
chased an Okidata Pacemark 2410 printer and 
was experiencing the same problem. My printer 
has both friction and tractor feed, and I assume 
that Thompson's printer is similarly equipped. 
Apparently the tractor and friction feeds are not 
designed to be used simultaneously. I have dis- 
covered that if one releases the friction feed, the 
tractor feed works perfectly. Since I made this 
discovery, the paper has never become mis- 
aligned in my printer.

Simulated Circuit Clouts 

This is in response to Richard Ronsbottom's re- 
quest (November Open Discussion) for sports- 
related software. In the August 15, 1982, issue 
of the Milwaukee Journal is a very favorable re- 
view of Sports Complex by Wolffware 
(Shore wood, WI), a disk of three simulations- 
golf, football, and baseball. 

The baseball simulation was also reported in 
the Milwaukee Journal on April 14, 1983, when 
the paper sponsored a simulated World Series 
pitting the 1957 World Champion Milwaukee 
Braves against the 1982 American League 
Champion Milwaukee Brewers. The baseball 
program was also cited in the Madison Capitol 
Times on Sunday, July 17, 1983, and in the 
Journal the next day, regarding a simulation run 
for members of the Society for American Base- 
ball Research at its annual meeting in 
Milwaukee.

Miscinfo Info 

After reading Michael Yang's letter in your De-

Pascal and the Apple lie, I would like to make a 
comment. Mr. Yang was on the right track 
when he stated that the System. Miscinfo file on 
Apple 1: disk had to be changed in order to 
make use of the up and down arrows of the Ap- 
ple lie, but there is an easier way. 

By executing the setup. code file on the Ap- 
ple3: disk and following the instructions using 
the teach command, almost all of the commands 
regarding output to the screen can be changed 
any way you want them. As the program goes 
through the various commands available, 
simply press C for change and the key you de- 
sire for that particular command— up arrow, 
down arrow, even use the delete key for 
something if you want to, or change the control-

magnetic media will be judged. 

You can count on BASF FlexyDisks because the Qualimetric 
standard reflects a continuing BASF commitment to 
perfection in magnetic media. One example is the 
unique two-piece liner in our FlexyDisk jacket. This 
BASF feature traps damaging debris away from 
the disk's surface and creates extra space in the 
head access area for optimum media-head 
alignment. The result is a guaranteed 
lifetime of outstanding performance.

bridges the gap between today 
and tomorrow, look for the

C command in the edit mode to the open apple 
key. If you don't have an eighty-column card, 
you can even reformat your screen in the edit 
mode to forty columns (no more control-A!). 
These commands can be changed not only for 
an Apple He, but for any Apple. 

At the end of the setup program, save the 
changes by pressing D for disk. The changes 
will be saved on Applel: as New.Miscinfo. 
Then delete System. Miscinfo and rename the 
New.Miscinfo file System. Miscinfo using the

Public Forestry 

The Oregon Vocational Forest Products In- 
structors Association is putting together a listing 
service for microcomputer programs in forestry 
that are in the public domain. This service is di- 
rected toward community college and high 
school forestry and logging instructors, with 
some interest shown by practicing foresters. We 
have been working on this project for about one 
year and have approximately fifty programs in 
our catalog. These programs are for a variety of 
computers, including Apple, TRS-80, PET, and 
various H-Ps. Most are written in Basic. 

Persons on our mailing list receive a catalog 
update once a year. We also provide a 
disk-copying service for Apple and a list service 
for other computer models. 

If any readers have public-domain software 
for any area of forestry that they feel would be 
appropriate to our efforts, we would appreciate 
their participation and contribution. Please mail 
all contributions to Les Martin at North Bend 
High School, Fourteenth and Pacific Streets, 
North Bend, OR 97459.

Speak to Me 

We have a blind teen using an Apple He with an 
Echo II speech synthesizer from Street Elec- 
tronics. We know of only a few suppliers of 
"talking" software so far. These are Bill 
Gumm of Computer Aids, David Halladay of 
Raised Dot Computing, and the Blind Apple 
Users Group out of New York. 

If any readers can give us leads on other 
software that will work with speech, other hard- 
ware with greater versatility and compatibility 
for speech with existing software, or program- 
mers who would be willing to adapt software 
for speech capability for us, it would be very 
much appreciated. 

Also, thanks to Jerry Van Cleeff from Mont- 
gomery, Alabama, for writing in with the 
assistance on making an Apple He with an 
eighty-column card and an Amdek Color-I 
monitor more readable. Can any reader tell me 



mm t 




the options and the advantages of the various 
boards to enhance the resolution on an Amdek 
Color-I Plus? We are a new family of users with 
an Apple He and want to improve on our screen, 
but need more education about the best way to 
do this.

Word Paddler 

Can anyone tell me where we can find the hard- 
ware/software combination to provide a word 
processor that can be operated by a game pad- 
dle? My neighbor is almost totally disabled, 
having some small movement in her right hand 
only . She is currently using an Apple lie with a 
mouth-stick, but most of the word processors 
require frequent use of two or more keys simul- 
taneously—hard to do with a mouth-stick. I 
have heard that a paddle-controlled word proc- 
essor is possible, since a quadriplegic engineer 
in Britain uses such an Apple to communicate 
and write articles, but I've not found such a pro- 
gram listed in this country.

Student Counseling 

To anyone who owns the Pascal language for an 
Apple lie: Help! I'm a computer science major 
about to enroll in three Pascal courses. I recent- 
ly purchased an Apple lie with two disk drives. 
I've been calling stores and asking local Apple 
club members, and now I'm writing to find out 
which Pascal system I should obtain. 

Do I need a language card? Is it wise to buy 
more memory, or more disk drives? Do I have 
enough memory in the first place?

Up in the Air 

I currently own an Apple He and would like

Stash the Flash 

I have a simple technique to create a nonflash- 
ing cursor that I'd like to share with readers. It 
does not require coding a special routine in 
every program that uses it. It is an assembler 
routine used as an input exit. This way, it auto- 
matically takes effect for any input statements 
coded into the program. 

Simply enter the following assembler code: 

300: A9 OB A2 03 85 38 86 39 
308: 4C EA 03 48 B1 28 38 E9 
310: 40 91 28 68 3C 21 FD 

Then bsave this routine. To make the cursor in- 
visible, the bytes E9 40 at location $30F can be 
changed to A9 AO. This can be done on the fly 
by using two poke instructions. You can also 
get an underline character as a cursor by putting 
the code A9 DF at location $30F. Other varia- 
tions are also possible. 

I have come into possession recently of a 
copy of a program called Microlisp. I under- 
stand it has been around for some time, so may- 
be someone out there knows something about it. 
I cannot get it to do anything but print numbers 
I type in or print the word "nil." How do I 



43 

make it do anything else? Can you give an ex- 
ample of something useful that I might be able 
to do it?

Premature Punt 

I am the sponsor of a high school computer 
club. For the last several years we've conducted 
a computerized football season using Strategic 
Simulations's Computer Quarterback. I have 
been very pleased with it, and my students real- 
ly enjoy it. 

Last spring I decided to update our game 
disk. After play-testing the new version, I found 
it to be more cumbersome and slower to play. 

I contacted the company to see if I could get 
an original version. They said all their old ver- 
sions were destroyed. I am hoping that someone 
with information about an old version of Com- 
puter Quarterback can contact me in care of

I've written several pro- 
grams in Applesoft that 
use shape tables. The tables were constructed 
using graph paper, converted to binary vectors, 
then to hex equivalents, and finally to decimal 
for incorporation into the Applesoft program. 

The problem I have run into is this: I'll set 
the program up for animation using draw and 
xdraw, with hcolor = 3 (white) so that the 
shape will appear and disappear and then move 
to the next location. As long as the scale is set to 
1, the program works great, but if the scale is 
any higher than that, the xdraw doesn't "un- 
draw" all of the pixels and leaves an annoying 
few on the screen as the animation progresses. 
My shapes seem to work okay, but I can't seem 
to get this corrected. Am I doomed to shapes at 
scale = 1 for animation, is my program lacking 
a magical poke, or is my new Apple lie in need 
of a trip to the IC doctor? John C. Beach, 
Bossier City, LA 



TH£H 



This one took a little 
playing around with, 
since I'd never really tried the draw-xdraw 
combination. First the easy answer, then the 
hard one. 

Xdraw isn't really meant to function as an 
"erase." It reverses the dots on the screen. If 
they were on, it turns them off. If they were off, 
it turns them on. Normally, one wouldn't use a 
draw to put something on the screen, then an 
xdraw to take it off. One procedure is to draw in 
the color you want, then set the hcolor to the 
background color and draw again. Example: 

5 REM Assume we load a shape table here 
10 HGR : REM Clears screen to black 
20 HCOLOR = 7 : REM We'll draw in white 
30 DRAW 1 AT 20,20 : REM Draw the shape 
40 HCOLOR = 0 : REM Set the color to the 

black background color 
50 DRAW 1 AT 20,20 : REM This will erase the 

shape by drawing it in the black 

background color. 

The other method is to use xdraws for both 
drawing and "undrawing." The first time, it 
will reverse the screen dots, thus displaying the 
shape. The second time, it will re-reverse them, 
leaving what was there originally. Because it 
simply reverses the background, xdraw has the 
advantage of being able to use it over any color 
or combination of colors without destroying the 
background. Example: 

5 REM Load the shape table here 
10 HGR : REM Clear to black again 
20 XDRAW 1 AT 20,20 : REM Reverses the 
shape, drawing it in white 



30 XDRAW 1 AT 20,20 : REM Reverses it 
again, erasing the shape 

Those are the usual techniques with shape 
tables. Now the hard part. Since you draw your 
shape in white on a black background, why 
won't the xdraw erase it by switching the white 
back to black? I don't think it has to do with 
scale, since I managed to make it happen with 
scale = 1. Here's the probable answer: 

Sometimes a shape can be designed so that it 
overlaps itself. Take, for example, the shape of 
a plus sign ( + ). You might first draw the ver- 
tical line, then the horizontal line. The two lines 
will cross, and the middle point will actually be 
plotted twice. When you xdraw it, that point is 
plotted with the vertical bar and then erased 
when you go over it with the horizontal bar! If 
you draw it first, you get the full plus sign in 
white. If you use draw to erase it, it will reverse 
out the vertical bar, thus erasing it (along with 
that point in the middle). It will then reverse out 
the horizontal bar, and the middle point will be 
set again! Mark Pelczarski 




The command poke 
1010, 102 .poke 1011, 
213:poke 1012,112 is very useful in escaping 
control-reset. Under this command, whenever 
reset is hit, the program in memory simply re- 
starts. It does, however, have one major draw- 
back: All drive commands cease to function ex- 
cept Pr#6 and In#6. How can I prevent this 
from happening? Ian Finseth, Menlo Park, CA 



wen 



The reason DOS com- 
mands don't work if you 
change the reset vector is that DOS gets 
unhooked when the reset key is pressed, so that 
even though your program will rerun, DOS is 
out of the picture. You can prevent this problem 
from occurring by calling a routine in the Apple 
to rehook DOS. Just place this call near the 
beginning of your program and you should be 
all set. The command is: Call 1002. Doug 
Carlston 




The Renumber utility on 
the DOS 3.3 System 
Master is a great program except that it fre- 
quently changes the values of some of the num- 
bers in my programs when I use it. Am I doing 
something wrong? 

Also, when I use the Basic command get in a 
program using a text file, the screen displays the 
first DOS command that follows the use of get. 
What's going on here? Chuck Snyder, San 
Rafael, CA 



TH£N 



The bug in Renumber is 
a specific and predicta- 
ble one. It thinks that numbers appearing after 
an asterisk in a multiplication operation are line 
numbers. If such a number matches a line num- 
ber that Renumber is changing, it will change 
the number after the asterisk as well. Here's an 
example: 

10 FOR X = 1 TO 10 
20 PRINT X * 10 
30 NEXT X 

If this program is renumbered to begin at line

100 instead of line 10, the 10 in line 20 will be 
changed to a 100! This can be avoided by 
writing programs without numbers following 
asterisks in multiplication. So line 20 would be: 

20 PRINT 10 * X 

Changing your programming style to ac- 
commodate a bug in Renumber may seem a little 
silly. If you know anyone with an Apple lie, the 
System Master that comes with that machine 
has a corrected Renumber that you should be 
able to copy onto your own disk. 

To answer your second question, the easiest 
thing to do is to use print after a get. When you 
are using a DOS command after get, the con- 
trol-D gets swallowed, so DOS doesn't 
recognize the command and prints it instead of 
executing it. Doug Carlston 




I typed Font Editor from 
an earlier issue of Sdf- 
talk and have a problem. When I save a font to 
disk, the type comes up unknown, instead of 
font. The size is 1,024 characters. What is the 
solution please? Julian LeRoi Altenhaus, Ma- 
plewood, NJ 



TH£N 



The Font Editor uses the 
Request. inv module to 
write out the font as a binary file. This opera- 
tion leaves the file as type unknown. To actually 
change the type to font, there are two alterna- 
tives. First, the Pascal system "filer" has a file 
type change option. Second, the set of Basic in- 
vokable modules from Foxware Products (Salt 
Lake City, UT) includes a Ftype.inv. module 
that allows you to change the file type to font 
from within the Font Editor. Simply call the 
module after doing the "fwrite" in the Font 
Editor. 

I have used this module and it works well. 
The set of modules is called Basic Extension 
and, in addition to the file type module, it con- 
tains routines to read and write matrixes, do 
direct block I/O, do high-speed array manipula- 
tion and string array searches, and lots of other 
goodies. 

Another invokable package comes from CE 
Software (Des Moines, IA) and is called Pro- 
grammer's Power Tools III. It is different, and 
very useful as well. It has, among other things, 
a high-speed sort. Taylor Pohlman 




Can DOS be pro- 
grammed into ROM 
chips so that you don't have to boot it when you 
need to use it? John Woo, Bronx, NY 



TtttN 



The biggest problem 
with putting DOS into 
ROM is that you wouldn't be able to modify it 
anymore — what would you do then with all the 
wonderful tipc in DOStalk? 

DOS would be difficult to put into ROM for 
two reasons. First, a large number of DOS's in- 
ternal locations are used to store things. These 
data storage areas would have to be separated 
from the actual program code and kept some- 
where in RAM. 

The second problem is that DOS is big- 
bigger than Basic itself when you include all the 
buffers and data storage areas. 



These problems aside, the reason nobody 
sells DOS on ROM chips is that Apple will only 
grant a license to distribute DOS on disk. For 
whatever reason, they refuse to allow the pro- 
gram to be sold as firmware. Tom Weishaar 




I need to speed up the 
computer system I have 
written for my medical office. Currently, the 
entire system is written in Apple III Business 
Basic. It does everything I want it to do, but it is 
rather slow at data production when it is time to 
run the billing. 

My long-range plan, already under way, is 
to rewrite the entire system in Pascal. However, 
that is some time away. For now, I need some 
invokable modules. My problem is that string 
locations in Basic are a secret. I realize they 
move, but I could greatly increase my speed if I 
could get to the string data in assembly lan- 
guage. I also realize that you cannot extend a 
Basic string. Below are two examples of what I 
want to do. If you can demonstrate "shorten," 
the easier one, I can handle the other. I know 
there are better ways to do these examples. 

)invoke shorten, money 

)name$ = "Smith " 

)perform shorten(@name$):print 

chr$(34);chr$(34) "Smith" 
)dollar$ = " 795" +" " 
)perform money(@dollar$):print 

chr$(34);dollar$;chr$(34) " $7.95" 

Raymond H. Sjerven, Kennewick, WA 



TH(N 



I suggest that you refer 
to the invokable modules 
I recommended to Julian Altenhaus. As to the 
two examples, try this: 

name$ = mid$(name$,1 ,instr(name$," ")) 

As long as the shorten operation is to occur at 
the first blank character, the above will work 
fine. 

For money, the most flexible technique is to 
open a text file and then use print using to 
format the result and input # to read it back 
(it's really fast, since everything's buffered in 
memory): 

10 Dollar = 795 
20 Open #1,"temp" 

30 Print #1,0 using "2A,#.2#";"$";795/100 
40 Input #1 ,0; Dollar$

I am writing in regard to 
Mr. Pelczarski's pro- 
gram published in the September 1983 Softalk. 
Using a KoalaPad for input, I am puzzled about 
the appearance of random spots of color on the 
screen, generally on the same horizontal line as 
the stylus. Also, I would appreciate a little more 
explanation on using the "zero cursor" mode. 
Robert L. Wartburg, Orange, CA 



THEN 



I can only make a guess 
at the first answer, since 
you don't really describe what you're doing 
when it happens. The KoalaPad has some weird 
effects if you are in "continuous draw" mode, 
and it sounds like that is what you are experi-

encing. "Continuous draw" is when you are 
plotting without pressing one of the buttons, say 
freehand drawing, or with a simulated brush. If 
you don't keep constant pressure on the pad, it 
will return zeroes for the coordinates, meaning 
that if you let up a little bit you will see extra 
dots or plotting around the upper corner. 

To see how a KoalaPad (or joystick, pad- 
dles, or trackball) returns coordinates, try the 
following program: 

10 PRINT PDL(0),PDL(1) 
20 GOTO 10 

You will see two columns of numbers zipping 
up the screen. The left column is the X

(horizontal) coordinate. The right column is the 
Y (vertical) coordinate. Most joystick devices 
will give a range of 0 to 255 for each. The 
KoalaPad gives a slightly smaller range. Note 
what happens when you release pressure from 
the pad. 

Then again, it could be the software (I don't 
think so, but who knows what kinda crazy 
things theeza machines are gonna do?). 

On the "zeroing" feature, the "Z" key tog- 
gles between a mode in which the joystick (pad- 
dles, touch pad, or whatever) covers the full 
range of the screen and a mode in which it is 
mapped to a small area of the screen. Normally, 
you can move your cursor all the way from left

your cursor there, and press "Z." Now your 
cursor will not move any further than twenty 
dots from that point. The entire range of the 
joystick covers a much smaller area, giving you 
much greater control in that region. Mark

I read in the October 
issue of Softalk about the 
formula to change hex to base 10. I was trying 
to develop a formula like this to change base 10 
to hex. Is there one? If so, I would really like to 
know what it is! Bill Tomasi, New Berlin, WI 



TffEQf You ask this of a former 

I math teacher? You've 

come to the right place. 

The easiest way to convert from decimal to 
hex is by using integer division. That's the kind 
of division where 7 divided by 4 equals 1 with a 
remainder of 3, instead of 1.75. Take the 
number you want to convert to hex and divide it 
by 16, integer style. Set the remainder aside and 
divide the answer by 16. Keep this up until the 
answer is 0, and the remainders will give you 
your answer. For instance, to convert 341 from 
decimal to hex: 

341 / 16 = 21, remainder 5 
21 / 16 = 1, remainder 5 
1/16 = 0, remainder 1 

so 341 decimal is $155 hex. If you get a re- 
mainder that is from 10 to 15, don't forget to 
translate it to a letter from A to F. 

Actually, neither conversion method is 
really a formula, since formulas don't work 
very well with the letters A through F. Here are 
two programs, one for hexadecimal to decimal, 
the other for decimal to hexadecimal. The first 
one uses the fact that the ASCII values of A 
through F are 65 through 70. 



Hexadecimal to Decimal 



10 



PRINT "Enter a Hexadecimal Number. If 
you use anything other than the digits 1 - 9 
and letters A - F, who knows what uniquely 
weird results you will get?" 
INPUT H$ 

D = 0 : FOR C = 1 TO LEN(H$) 
40 A$ = MID$(H$,C,1) 
50 IF A$ > = "0" AND A$ < 

V = VAL(A$) : GOTO 70 

V = ASC (A$) - 55 
D = D * 16 + V 
NEXT 



20 
30 



'9" THEN 



60 
70 
80 



90 PRINT "The decimal equivalent is ":D 



Decimal to Hexadecimal 

10 H$="0123456789ABCDEF" 
20 INPUT "Enter a base 10 number : ";D 
30 A$ = "" 
40 Q = INT (D/ 16) 
50 R = D - Q * 16 
60 A$ = MID$(H$,R + 1,1) + A$ 
70 IF Q THEN D = Q : GOTO 40 
80 PRINT "The hexadecimal equivalent is "; 
A$ 

Note that in line 70 that "if Q then" means "if 
Q is true then," or "if Q is not equal to zero 
then. . . ." Mark Pelczarski 31

And it's happening again with our IBM" 
compatible Rana 2000. This 320K double density 
drive offers a large centering cone for problem- 
free diskettes and our exclusive silencing mecha- 
nism to make it the quietest disk drive you 
can buy. 

At Rana we know the key to our success is 
providing the highest technology, on the best 
possible products, while filling the most possible 
user needs. That is why we spend so much time on

access speed. And, the first to bring you all this 
performance, quality and dramatic styling. 

This is why our Elite One got the #1 rating

What's in a name? In one sense, it's the way we recognize ourselves. 
It's a way of capturing the sense of an object or, more important, of a 
concept or idea. Names can be based on whimsy and humor; some are 
designed to define a sensibility. Often a name is pretentious, attempting 
to expand the influence of its owner by virtue of assertion, while other 
names strive to be endearing or captivating by projecting rather than 
reflecting an image. Certain names, the best names, simply define their 
owners by suiting them perfectly . . . like Sensible Software. 

"We're basically simple folk," says Sensible Software cofounder 
Allan Emery. But "Simple Software" would have been a misnomer. 
These people don't bring you simple programs, they bring you useful 
ones— sensible utilities for the person who wants to get things done with 
an Apple. Their programs help you organize, optimize, edit, and manage 
your files. The programs aren't designed to impress, but to be useful. 
They are sensible, like a coat that doesn't fall apart in three months or a 
car that gets you where you want to go without toting around an extra 
half ton of chrome. 

Don't Forget the Motor City. Like many of the microcomputer soft- 
ware publishing houses, Sensible is a product of the hobbyist tradition. 
Two men, one a programmer and one a new computer owner fascinated 
by the world of silicon marvels, met in the Computer Connection store 
near Detroit. The programmer was Chuck Hartley, a veteran of the only 
game in town — the automotive industry — where he had put in some seven 
years in Ford's newfangled computer applications department. Chuck 
had purchased an Apple in 1978 and, sensible fellow that he was, figured 
he ought to write and sell programs and get a tax break. He had written 
a couple of utilities and even had some stuff published by Programma, 
where fledgling publisher Dave Gordon (now of Datamost) was cutting 
his teeth. 

The other man was Allan Emery, M.D., fresh out of medical school 
and embarked on a career in gynecology and obstetrics. Emery had dis- 
covered microcomputers while finishing his studies. He bought a Radio 
Shack TRS-80 Model I Level IV 4K computer as a "diversion." Within 
a week he had decided that he wanted a machine that was more open, that 
would let him explore his growing fascination with the new technology. 
As luck would have it, he had purchased his first computer from a store 
that understood. They let him return his TRS-80, and Emery became the 
owner of a tape-driven Apple. 

Emery got involved in what was then a fairly small community of en- 
thusiasts and, like them, became a regular visitor at local computer deal- 
ers. One day he ran into a fellow at a store who was testing a newly de- 
veloped disk file copy and transfer utility that he called Super Disk Copy. 
"I'm basically pretty shy," Emery explains, "and don't usually just 
start talking to people, but I was fascinated by this fellow and his pro- 
gram. So I just started talking to him. It was exciting just to . . . ask 
questions." 

Before long, Emery and Hartley were friends. Hartley explained that 
he was negotiating a publishing contract for Super Disk Copy with Pro- 
gramma. He already had other programs listed in Programma's catalog 
and wanted to get his newest creation out into the world. When he told 
Emery the royalty figures being bandied about, Emery once again aban- 
doned his shyness and told Hartley that he was crazy. It wasn't that Pro- 
gramma's royalties were low, but that Emery felt Hartley deserved more 
for his work. So the doctor with the burgeoning computer hobby and no 
business experience took the leap: "I can make you a lot more money," 
he told Hartley. And Hartley listened. Three months later, a partnership 
agreement was signed in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and Sensible Software 
became a reality. 

Emery took over the day-to-day operations of the company, while 
Hartley wrote the programs that the company marketed. First there was 
AOPT, the Applesoft Optimizer, followed by APlus, another Applesoft 
enhancement utility. Sensible's third release, Super Disk Copy, was their 
first big success. About this time Apple released DOS 3.3, and both Su- 
per Disk Copy and another utility, Multi Disk Catalog, were updated to 
work with the new operating system. Sales took off, and in the last three 
months of 1980 Sensible Software started to take on a life of its own. 

Close Encounters with the Third Partner. Not only was 1980 the 
year Sensible emerged as an established publisher of first-rate utility pro- 
grams, it was also the year when the third partner showed up. Roger Tut- 
tleman— a Chrysler employee working in the relatively undefined CAD

area, where rules were so vague that he moved pretty freely among the 
myriad levels of the corporate structure — purchased his Apple in April 
1980. Like Chuck Hartley, Tuttleman had begun by writing tools that he 
wanted but couldn't find on the market. His first utility was Disk Organ- 
izer, a program that manipulates disk catalogs in ways that Apple never 
intended. Besides programming, Roger was also active in user-group ac- 
tivities and became president of a Michigan Apple user group in the lat- 
ter part of 1980. There he met Allan Emery, and the two began to talk. 
Tuttleman brought up the subject of having his utilities published, and 
suddenly Sensible Software was a little larger. 

First Tuttleman 's Disk Organizer was published, and then Disk 
Recovery. By early 1981, Sensible Software consisted of three partners. 
Tuttleman became the technical support department, as well as being a 
considerable help to Emery in the publishing end of the business. 

Nineteen eighty-one and 1982 were eventful years for Sensible Soft- 
ware. This was the time when Sensible picked up a lot of its Applesoft 
programming utilities, along with the one program that more than any 
other seems to have put the company on the map: Sensible Speller. Origi- 
nally released as The Apple Speller, the program is now in its fourth revi- 
sion and remains the acknowledged leader in its field. It is a spelling 
checker, a program that compares word processing files with an internal 
dictionary and lets the user know where possible misspellings have oc- 
curred. It's Hartley's brainchild, although he credits Tuttleman and Em- 
ery with urging him to write such a program. 

When it was released in late 1981, Sensible Speller had some com- 
petitors, such as The Dictionary from Sierra On-Line. But while it had 
competitors, it did not have much competition. People started to take 
notice of the program, and word spread that Speller did more than just 
check spelling. It gave useful information to writers, such as frequency 
of word use within a document, and it would even go so far as to suggest 
alternate spellings of suspect words, showing the context in which poten- 
tial misspellings might appear. A little more than half a year later, Sensi- 
ble delivered the follow-up punch by more than doubling the size of the 
word list in Speller and using the concise edition of the Random House 
Dictionary of the English Language as the basis for the program's glos- 
sary. At that point, there was no disputing which program was the best of 
its kind. 

Sensible Speller is perhaps the best example of a single program con- 
trolling its own niche in the software marketplace. Apple Computer went 
to Sensible when it wanted a spelling checker to go with Apple Writer HI, 
and Broderbund and the Bank Street College of Education knew where to 
look when they wanted a spelling checker as a companion program to the 
Bank Street Writer. Excellence can still earn respect in the fledgling soft- 
ware industry, even in the face of higher-powered marketing and more 
advertising dollars spent by the competition. 

Locked Out and Backed Up. It was a bit prior to this that Sensible 
Software released its most controversial program: Back It Up, a nibble 
copier. Hartley wryly notes that Back It Up came out shortly after 
Locksmith, and that the latter program stole both the thunder and prob- 
ably a good deal of the sales, but he doesn't seem to regret it. "Back It 



Up was always sort of a low-profile program," he says. "At times it's 
been painful to be its publisher. But with the copy cards, nibble copiers 
in general seem to be fading, and we're not as concerned about Back It 
Up." Tuttleman and Hartley are both quick to point out that Sensible has 
been in the protection business longer than they have been selling nibble 
copiers. And in what may be a double irony, one of Sensible 's most 
popular programs, according to user polls — Super Disk Copy— has not 
sold enough to warrant its strong showing in the popularity polls. The 
salt in that particular wound is that when Sensible first got into the soft- 
ware business, it met some definite resistance from dealers who thought 
that Super Disk Copy was a nibble copier and who therefore wouldn't 
carry it! 

In the meantime, Hartley had left his job with Ford at the end of 1980 
to take a job with Prime Computer, working on CAD system develop- 
ment. That meant that Emery had to run the company while Hartley pro- 
grammed on the East Coast. But Emery was also a practicing physician, 
meaning that he worked the doctor's usual twelve hours a day and then 
what seemed like another sixteen hours a day for Sensible. Numbers like 
that can only add up to trouble. 

In November 1980, Emery's father, Joe, who had been helping out 
all along, became Sensible Software's first full-time employee. Emery's 
mother, Edythe, took over the bookkeeping for the company, even 
though she was working full-time as a bookkeeper elsewhere. She quit 
her other job as 1981 rolled to a close, thus becoming the second full- 
time Sensible employee. Tuttleman finally quit his job in January 1982 to 
work full-time at Sensible, but by that time the hours and the work had 
caught up with Allan Emery. 

On Thanksgiving Day 1981, the heart of Sensible Software literally 
gave out; Allan Emery had a heart attack. A year of working from 6:00 
a.m. until 3:00 a.m., seven days a week, had caught up with him. "I 
was literally killing myself," he says, "and I finally realized I couldn't 
do it all myself. I backed off a little and turned over a lot of the day- 
to-day stuff to others." Yet his enthusiasm seems never to have let up. 
Even while recovering in the hospital he was tinkering with computers— 
his family brought him a TRS-80 Pocket Computer. Emery's heart gave 
him another warning in the hospital, and this time bypass surgery 
was necessary. 

At that point Emery had to make some hard decisions. His work (and 
workload) at Sensible were overwhelming only because that was the 
measure of his enthusiasm, of his love for what the company was. Yet 
medicine was, and still is, Emery's first love. He still participates in the 
business and policy decisions of Sensible Software, and he still handles 
some of the negotiations, such as those with Apple Computer that led to 
the Apple III Speller program. But Emery lets the others handle the daily 
chores and support work. 

"I won't do to myself what I did before," he says, although he has 
hardly given up his enthusiasm for computers. Instead, Emery uses the 
knowledge he has gained to help out other people. 

"It's almost trite, but it's true," he says. "This is like being in a 
true-life adventure. I'm a physician, yet I now sit on two school commit-

tees. My involvement in computers has led me to the opportunity to help 
shape high-tech education in my community. Now I sit and talk with peo- 
ple who run factories or with school superintendents. It's a very gratify- 
ing feeling." 

The Fourth Dimension. Most entities seem to seek internal balance. 
Sensible Software started with a clean dichotomy: Hartley the program- 
mer and Emery the enthusiast. The third partner, Tuttleman, swung the 
balance to the side of programmers. A fourth partner could well have 
been a trick of destiny, or perhaps something more deliberate than that. 
He wasn't a programmer, though, and he brings to Sensible a degree of 
enthusiasm that any company needs to stay alive and fresh. 

Barry Fayne is a lawyer, a man who met Emery socially. As he 
watched his new friend getting swept up in the excitement of microcom- 
puters, Fayne also began to get caught up in this whirlwind new frontier. 
He helped set up the partnership, and later the corporation, that is Sensi- 
ble and still talks of his own "sense of awe" about computers, what they 
can do and how they affect people's lives. 

Whereas Chuck Hartley is relaxed, careful, and conservative in dis- 
cussing the revolution he is helping along, Barry Fayne is brimming with 
enthusiasm. Whereas Allan Emery speaks with love and caring about a 
company that very nearly cost him his life, Barry Fayne pushes and plays 
with ideas and notions of the social effects of this new technology. 
Whereas Roger Tuttleman is something of a savant and speculator in the 
world of micros, watching and caring about hardware and software 
alike, Barry Fayne plays the part of the scattershot philosopher, thrilled 
and excited by the whole new world of ideas and possibilities opening up 
before him. 

It is a delight to sit and talk with the partners of Sensible. There is no 
single, driving force in this company, but rather a lovely, albeit com- 
plex, balance. Each person has a lot to say, and all are articulate and well 
spoken. After a few hours, one begins to think that this is the way soft- 
ware publishing should be— no nonsense, no pretense, no hype. These 
people do what they do because they care about it. They put out good 
products because they could never see their way to doing anything else. 
There's no businessman sophistry here; they aren't in the business be- 
cause it represented a get-rich-quick opportunity. Software isn't a com- 
modity to them, it's something to be cared about, to be loved and 
nurtured. 

These are folks who are sensible enough to learn from their mistakes 
and to make enough common-sense decisions to keep a thriving business 
alive and well. Remember, the only person in the company with any 
claim to a business background is Fayne, the last partner. For Hartley, 
Emery, and Tuttleman, business and marketing were disciplines best left 
to others until they were forced to come to grips with them. 

Says Hartley: "The Apple market represented an accelerated learn- 
ing curve in marketing and business for a lot of people. None of us had 
any experience; we just had to learn as we went along." When Emery 
and Hartley joined forces, Sensible went from small classified ads in 
local publications to display ads in national magazines such as Nibble and 
Softalk. Suddenly they had to start thinking about packaging, shipping, 
order taking, and supporting their products. Emery talks about the early 
days of standing in line at the local post office before making his way to 
the hospital, while Joe and Edythe remember the early-morning phone 
calls from Australia and all the telephone relationships with regular 
customers. 

"We learned that service is the key," the elder Emery says. "We 
would get the orders and updates out within a day and get lots of con- 
gratulations for doing so. There's a lot of personal satisfaction there." 

Around and Around. For Liz Hartley, Sensible Software first rein- 
forced her dislike of Chuck's computing hobby and then led her full cir- 
cle to become a computer enthusiast. "At first I took his computing very 
personally— it really affected our life! But my attitude has changed a lot 
since then. I use the computer a lot now, for orders and word processing. 
Word processing is just the greatest thing." Now Liz is in charge of 
packaging and production and, along with Joe and Edythe, seems to be 
the heart of the operations side of the business. It makes Sensible Soft- 
ware an extremely pleasant company to deal with, no matter what your 
business with them might be. 

The kind of service and caring for customers dispensed by everyone 
at Sensible, along with the care that goes into the products, led to 
customer loyalty. "Repeat sales are definitely a big plus for Sensible," 
Hartley notes. "Some people now just automatically buy any of our new 



products." But any company has to adjust to the changing times and will 
notice that their market is a dynamic one, changing almost on a day-to- 
day basis. When Sensible started, there weren't very many companies 
and there were very few distributors or wholesalers in the business. "We 
were there when the distributors got started," Hartley says, "and they 
came to us. But I've noticed in the last nine months that it takes a hard 
push to get products onto their lists and into the market." 

In the early days of the software business, Sensible, like most of their 
contemporaries, sold to any and all customers. Now the entrance of 
wholesalers and middlemen into the market has changed the way they do 
business. "Sometimes we need to send away the lucrative direct sales in 
order to prime the pump, to get the distributors going," Chuck says. 

The business has grown steadily due to the ethic of quality and serv- 
ice. There are some ten people employed by Sensible on either a part- 
time or contract basis. Duplication of disks is performed by Barbara 
Lubeski and John Sopala, who work according to demand, while packag- 
ing is handled by Art Doran and Wendy Reiman under Liz Hartley's 
direction. Marian Tuttleman, married to Roger, handles much of the cor- 
respondence engendered by the software publishing business. After 
years of steady growth, the company is moving into formal offices in 
nearby Oak Park, Michigan, this month. 

Hackers Away. The way that software is sold isn't the only change 
the folks at Sensible have noted in the software industry. The types of 
products that sell have changed, and Sensible is trying to change with the 
times. While the original focus and raison de'etre of Sensible Software 
was to create the tools that were missing from the marketplace, the whole 
microcomputer market has changed. "We're starting to concentrate less 
on what we want," Chuck says, "and more on what we think other peo- 
ple might want." That translates into fewer utilities for the hobbyist, the 
hacker, or programmer, and more tools for the computer user. 

Sensible 's latest offering, The Graphics Department, is a tool for 
businessmen to put together charts and graphs— something of an in- 
tegrated package for the Apple II. It lets the user make charts, label 
them, insert them into other documents, or put them into a slide show. It 
isn't meant to be a flashy program, but one that integrates the necessary 
tools for a businessman to put together a workmanlike presentation. 

Another program, Report Card, is a specialized database manager 
that tracks classes, grades, and test results for school teachers. Barry 
calls it a program for educators that avoids the issue of whether com- 
puters and education are a valid combination. Instead, it's just plain use- 
ful. Bookends is another specialized data management system, this time 
focused on reference materials. Again, it is directed not at the traditional 
hobbyist, but rather the computer user. Tele-porter is a modem package, 
not a terminal program. It is designed to let two Apples exchange data in 
the most efficient — and thus least expensive — way possible. 

There are other decisions facing the people of Sensible Software, 
ones that epitomize the dilemmas of software publishing. By the time this 
article is published, Sensible will have released Report Card, its first 
piece of IBM software. It won't be the last program the company will do 
for that computer. For Hartley, the move into the IBM marketplace 
represents "long-term insurance for expansion." Yet he admits a defi- 
nite fondness for the Apple market that goes beyond a sentimental attach- 
ment for where it all started. Tuttleman is quite direct about it: "The Ap- 
ple market is a much more friendly segment of the industry than any 
other." 

This Is Supposed To Be the New World. All the principals of Sensi- 
ble Software seem to be looking forward to watching the progress of 
Macintosh ("The exciting thing is the price," Chuck says) and feel that 
Apple is taking some pretty strong and aggressive steps to reposition 
itself. As businessmen and partners, they all voice the need to diversify 
their product line, to spread out into heretofore strange areas for Sen- 
sible. 

Yet somehow there's still a smile and a little more than a vested in- 
terest when they talk about Apple. There's love and caring. It shines 
through in their conversation and in their faces when they talk about the 
last five and a half years. But most of all, it shines through in their prod- 
ucts, both in quality and design. 

Sensible 's offerings aren't products thrown together in search of a 
market. They are thoughtful exercises in the design and execution of 
utilities— programs that are, by definition, useful. They are, like the 
name of the company itself, a perfect reflection of the people who make 
them. 31

Pretzel 

So far, we have glossed over the concept of patterns. This is not 
because it is unimportant or trivial — far from it. In fact, we will devote 
the whole of this month's column to pattern drawing because it is a unify- 
ing concept— one of those rare and valuable approaches that solve many 
problems at once and simplify our thinking as well. We will find that 
much of the complexity of the Apple II graphics screen can be absorbed 
by patterns, much as our screen tables allowed us to forget about the 
complicated memory mapping of the hi-res screen. As a result, our 
graphics package will benefit by having a simpler interface and a wider 
range of applications. 

To see why patterns are such a good idea, we will first take a quick 
look at the way ideas about how to draw on the Apple screen developed 
historically. We will see that later developments have been folded back 
to embrace a whole range of problems solved earlier by other methods, 
rather than following a direct and logical evolution. We call this kind of 
problem solving, where new results provide us with elegant and unfore- 
seen solutions to old problems, pretzel logic. 

Lost in the Mists of Time. In the beginning, all was black and white. 
The Apple could do color, but most of the early software didn't use it in 
hi-res. This made drawing on the screen of the Apple simpler for the pro- 
grammer, since turning on a pixel was the same as turning on a bit in 
screen memory. This is still the simplest view of Apple hi-res. 

Of course, one of the nicest things about the Apple is that it has a col- 
or hi-res display, and very early on people were using the six hi-res col- 
ors. This required new drawing routines, since a color pixel involved at 
least two bits. Now there were two views of Apple hi-res: black and 
white, and color. 

It wasn't long before there was some experimenting with halftone or 
"comic book" colors. By combining the six real hi-res colors in regular 
ways, it was possible to have twenty-one colors on the screen. Again, 
this was a new way of looking at the Apple screen, and it too required 
new drawing routines. 

By the time the Apple II was a few years old, there were probably as 
many different ways of thinking about hi-res as there were Apple pro- 
grammers. Often a programmer would have a set of graphics utilities for 



Logic 

each kind of hi-res drawing and could switch from one set to another in 
the same program as the drawing required. This state of affairs couldn't 
help but add to the confusion about Apple graphics that continues today . 
With the new Apple He double hi-res mode, it might seem as though 
things are getting worse. 

In the last two years, we have seen the introduction of good drawing 
and sketching programs for the Apple II . One of the common features of 
these programs is the filling of areas with patterns. After selecting a 
small, rectangular "swatch" of a pattern from a menu, the user can then 
cause objects to be drawn with that swatch, repeated as often as 
necessary. 

The filling pattern is usually aligned with the top left corner of the 
screen (or of the current screen window in more sophisticated systems). 
The size and shape of a swatch is critical in determining how simple it 
will be to implement pattern filling and how fast a program will run. For 
this reason, swatches are always rectangular and of a size and shape 
compatible with the hi-res screen. 

New Apples Heard From. This still leaves us with many possible 
choices. We could make an arbitrary decision as to pattern swatch size 
and treat pattern filling as just another special effect. This gives us a new 
capability, but only by adding complexity to an already complex subject. 
This is unfortunate, because as we will show, a careful choice of swatch 
size gives patterns even greater power and generality. 

On Macintosh and Lisa, patterns are eight-by -eight arrays of bits, ar- 
ranged as eight consecutive bytes. Each bit corresponds to a pixel, since 
these machines have black-and-white screens. The choice of an eight-by- 
eight swatch size was dictated by the fact that these hi-res screens are 
organized into bytes, and by the fact that eight by eight is the right size to 
specify the most useful patterns, including many halftone shades of gray 
(figure 1). A different swatch size, say 7 by 7, would have severely 
limited the patterns that could be drawn. Since neither Macintosh nor 
Lisa can display color, this halftoning capability is extremely important 
for making interesting pictures. 

Things are not as clear-cut on the Apple II . Our screen is organized 
into bytes, but only seven of the bits correspond to pixels on the screen.

The simplest kinds of patterns to implement would be those that were 
consistent with this seven-bit system. However, swatches that are seven 
bits wide aren't satisfactory on the Apple II because hi-res colors involve 
even numbers of pixels. Since seven is odd, we wouldn't be able to ex- 
pand such a pattern and get true Apple colors. 

Any swatch size that is an even number of pixels will allow us to 
make patterns in color. Clearly, then, our swatch width should be an 
even number. 

To handle the halftone or comic book colors, the swatch width and 
height must both be even, which means that our pattern swatches must be 
at least two by two pixels. Even better would be four by four pixels, 
since this size makes even more color halftones possible. 

Double hi-res with sixteen colors requires swatches to be some multi- 
ple of four dots wide (sixteen colors require four bits per pixel), and dou- 
ble hi-res halftoning requires swatches of at least eight by two pixels. 

High-Bit Hassles. We will adopt eight by eight as our swatch size, 
because it allows us to do all of the above operations and to use all of the 
patterns available on the Macintosh and Lisa computers. As it turns out, 
this swatch size is surprisingly easy to implement. 

The high bit of a screen byte, which we have not considered until now, 
poses some problems. We would like our patterns to take advantage of 
the full six-color capability of the Apple n, but there is no place to put 
the high-bit information in our pattern swatch, since all eight bits of each 
of the eight bytes are used for actual pixel information. By adding an ex- 
tra byte to the swatch, we can specify, for each of the eight rows of the 
pattern, whether the high bit of our pattern rows should be on or 
off. Thus, our patterns now consist of eight pattern bytes and one 
"sign" byte. 

We can now begin to appreciate the main point of this month's col- 
umn: that with this careful definition of pattern, we no longer need to 
worry about the idiosyncrasies of Apple II color graphics. To switch be- 
tween the different ways of drawing, a user of our graphics package need 
only call SetPattern with the proper pattern data. Given a small library of 
patterns, a user can draw in black and white, color, halftone color, or 
even double hi-res without knowing a thing about high bits, odd pixels, 



or any of the other esoterica of Apple II hi-res. 

All that remains now is to show how we can implement eight-by-eight 
patterns efficiently. After all, what good is elegance if no one uses it 
because it is too slow? We will now see how easy it is to expand eight-by- 
eight patterns. 

The main problem with pattern filling is figuring out what parts of the 
pattern data go where on the hi-res screen. On the Apple II this is com- 
plicated, because our patterns are defined by an eight-by-eight array 
while the screen bytes display only seven pixels. It takes some work to 
expand the pattern data out into screen form, and this work will be 
repeated many times to fill large objects. 

Once again, it will make sense to take this computation out of the 
HLine drawing primitive and instead to put it in an auxiliary routine, 
which we have called SetPattern. This routine will expand the pattern 
data into a large pattern buffer that contains eight full scanlines of pat- 
tern. This buffer can then be consulted whenever we need to know which 
part of the pattern to put on-screen. This is a kind of table lookup, but the 
table is generated anew whenever the pattern is changed. The result is 
that the HLine fill-pattern handler is simple and fast. 

The strategy falls apart if we are drawing lots of small objects in dif- 
ferent patterns, because then the work of setting the pattern overshadows 
the real work of drawing the object. But pattern drawing is usually ap- 
plied to large objects, so in most cases we win. 

The only thing that HLine has to figure out now is which pattern buff- 
er row it should use to draw a horizontal line. If we wish to align our pat- 
terns with the top left corner of the screen, it's easy— HLine simply gets 
the Y coordinate of the horizontal line on the screen and takes its re- 
mainder when divided by eight. This tells us which pattern row to use. 

♦Assembly Language Discussion. The listing shows SetPattern, 
which gets its pattern argument using a pointer passed in the A and X 
registers. It then expands each pattern byte into a whole row by shifting 
and adding in high (sign) bits. A significant point is that it is easy to ex- 
pand eight pixels into a scanline (forty bytes) of hi-res bytes; it seems as 
though the 6502 was designed to do things like this. 

In order to understand how HLine 's pattern-filling handlers work, we

must refer to last month's listing. Examine the handler for mode 4 in par- 
ticular. For the middle bytes of a horizontal line, the handler simply 
transfers data from the appropriate expanded row in the pattern buffer 
onto the hi-res screen: 

FillPat.1 Ida (pattern),y 
FillPat.2 sta (base),y 
dey 

cpy Ieft.d7 
bne FillPat.1 

For the edges, the handler takes advantage of a trick to combine pat- 
tern data from the buffer with the screen data that must be preserved. At 
first glance, it might seem that two masks would be required for this 
operation — one to preserve screen bits, and the inverse mask to clear out 
the screen bits where the pattern is to go. Instead, by using the EOR in- 
struction twice, we get by with one mask, and thus fewer instructions. 
Figure 2 shows how the instructions accomplish this. 

Finally, look at the beginning of HLine. The very first thing HLine 
does when a pattern mode has been requested is to decide which row of 
the pattern buffer to use in the filling process. It puts the address of that 
row in the zero page location called Pattern, which the FillPat and Eor- 
Pat handlers use to address the pattern buffer. A self-modifying JMP in- 
struction is used to eliminate this overhead from the modes that don't use 
the pattern buffer. 

Drawing a rectangle is a simple operation, and we now have the tools 
to perform it, though we will do things a bit differently in our final 
package. We will assume that the rectangle is stored in zero page loca- 
tions XI, Yl, X2, and Y2. These represent the leftmost, topmost, 



rightmost, and bottommost coordinates respectively, and they are in 
screen space (between 0 and 279 for the Xs and 0 and 191 for the Ys;. 
The drawing will be done in the color red, using the fill-pattern mode: 



jsr SetFill 

Ida #red 

Idx #<red 

jsr SetPattern 

DrawRect jsr ScanPrms 

DrawRct.1 Idx y1 

jsr HLine 

inx 

cpx y2 

bcc DrawRct.1 

beq DrawRct.1 
rts 



;fill mode 

;set pattern to red 



;get byte/mask values for edges 
idraw a row of the rectangle 

;continue until last row is done 



red dfb $55,$55,$55,$55,$55,$55,$55,$55 ;odd pixels 

dfb $FF ;all hi-bits on 

That concludes our low-level primitive HLine and the related 
SetGMode, ScanPrms, and SetPattern. Up to now, we have taken it on 
faith that these routines would prove useful in drawing more complicated 
geometrical objects such as rectangles and polygons. 

The next step, then, is to build on this foundation a set of higher-level 
subroutines. In a way, this will be an easier and more enjoyable task, 
since HLine isn't really very powerful by itself and because there were 
so many subtleties in its design and assembly language implementation. 

Next month: coordinates, clipping, and viewing.

PATH 



By Jim Merritt 



Jungle Fever, Part 13 



Time To Get Packed. Many months ago, we noted that the identifier 
String was in some sense equivalent to the declaration "PACKED AR- 
RAY [0..80] OF Char." At the time, we agreed to ignore the keyword 
PACKED because it was irrelevant to our discussion. We promised 
ourselves, however, to investigate this mysterious keyword at the 
proper time, which just happens to be now. 

First, you should enter and execute the following program: 



PROGRAM 
SizeDiff; 
VAR 
UnpackedString 

: ARRAY [0 .. 80] OF Char; 
TrueString 
: String; 
PackedString 
: PACKED ARRAY[0 .. 80] OF Char; 
BEGIN (* SizeDiff *) 
Writel_n(Output, 'SizeOf(UnPackedString) = 
Writel_n(Output, 'SizeOf(TrueString) = 
Writel_n(0utput, 'SizeOf(PackedString) = 
END (* SizeDiff *). 



,SizeOf(UnPackedString)); 

.SizeOf(TrueString)); 

,SizeOf(PackedString)); 



The execution of SizeDiff produces this display: 

SizeOf(UnPackedString) = 162 
SizeOf(TrueString) = 82 
SizeOf(PackedString)= 82 

As you can see, UnPackedString occupies 162 bytes of primary 
(RAM) memory, while TrueString and PackedString each occupy only 
82 bytes. (Experienced computer enthusiasts and long-time readers of 
this column will recall that a byte is an eight-bit chunk of information, 
and that one byte corresponds, roughly, to one printable character.) 

You may wonder why UnPackedString is so much larger than 
TrueString and PackedString, even though each of the three accom- 
modates exactly the same amount of information: 81 individual 
characters. (For now, let's ignore the fact that TrueStrong[0] actually 
represents the dynamic length of TrueString and cannot be accessed as a 
Char value under normal circumstances.) Before we address the ques- 
tion directly, we need some background information concerning the 
p-machine. 

The Word Is Given. Remember, the p-machine is a hypothetical 
processor, the "machine instructions" of which correspond closely to 
the features of the Pascal language. The Apple Pascal p-machine is, in 
fact, a program that emulates the operation of this hypothetical com- 
puter. In other words, the p-machine emulator program makes your Ap- 
ple appear to be the "ideal p-machine." 

The 6502 central-processing-unit (CPU) chip in your Apple is often 
described as an "eight-bit microprocessor." This simply means that the 
6502 was optimized to manipulate information a byte at a time. Although 
it is certainly possible to use the 6502 to handle individual bits (or to deal 
with structures that contain many bytes), it is easiest and quickest to 
work with an entire byte at once. In general, one 6502 machine-language 
instruction controls the processing of a single byte. To process either an 
individual bit or several bytes, you must typically use more than one 
instruction. 

The unit of information most conveniently used by a particular com- 
puter is called that machine's word. The number of bits in a word is 
known as the word size. Since a group of eight bits is also called a byte, 



computers that are optimized to handle eight-bit words are sometimes re- 
ferred to as "byte-oriented machines." When speaking of such com- 
puters, the terms "word" and "byte" are synonymous. This is not 
necessarily true of other machines, however. For instance, a "word" is 
thirty-two bits to the MC68000 CPU that lies at the heart of Apple's Lisa 
and Macintosh computers. (Actually, the MC68000 handles units of 
eight, sixteen, or thirty -two bits with equal facility. Because thirty-two 
bits comprise the largest "word" the chip can handle, that word is re- 
ferred to as a thirty-two bit CPU.) Thus, a "Lisa/Mac word" equals four 
bytes, while a "6502 word" is exactly one byte. Word sizes of eight, 
sixteen, and thirty-two bits are commonly found in today's personal 
computers, but some popular computers intended for industrial or scien- 
tific use boast word sizes of four, twelve, sixty, and sixty-four. 

Different computers offer different word sizes primarily for reasons 
of cost and convenience . The larger the word size assumed by a par- 
ticular CPU, the more circuitry the CPU unit must include. The 
MC68000 chip contains many more circuits than the 6502. It is also, by 
virtue of its relative complexity, much more expensive. When either 
processor is suitable for a certain job, the prudent and frugal computer 
systems designer will usually choose the 6502 over the MC68000 simply 
because it costs less. 

Often, however, a processor's suitability for a particular task is deter- 
mined more by its word size than by its cost. For example, we know that 
an ASCII character may be represented by a single byte. Since text may 
be considered as strings of ASCII characters — that is, as strings of in- 
dividual bytes— it is convenient (and appealingly inexpensive) to use a 
byte-oriented machine for text-handling applications. On the other hand, 
suppose we wish to design a computer that processes digital audio ac- 
cording to the recently developed standard for compact discs (CDs). In 
this case, we might wish to employ a sixteen-bit CPU, since the standard 
unit of digital audio information is a sixteen-bit word. The so-called 
"number-crunching" computers used by scientists and the military 
routinely process very large (actually, highly precise) real numbers. 
Consequently, these machines are optimized to handle large words— 
often, sixty-four bits or more— in order that they may more easily treat 
huge numbers as indivisible units. 

The Apple Pascal p-machine emulates a sixteen-bit computer. Thus, 
the typical p-code instruction manipulates two (adjacent) bytes at once, 
treating them as a sixteen-bit word. From this point on, when we talk of 
a "word" we will be referring to a p-machine word— that is, a sixteen- 
bit chunk of data. As always, an eight-bit chunk of data will be called 
a byte. 

To access any particular byte of information using a sixteen-bit com- 
puter, you must usually fetch the word in which the byte is stored, then 
extract the byte from (or inject the byte into) the word. (A similar proc- 
ess is followed to isolate any series of consecutive bits within a word.) 
This two-step procedure necessarily involves more than one machine in- 
struction and is therefore more costly than word-oriented computing in 
terms of both RAM space and execution time. 

The Compiler's Word Play. Unless told otherwise, the Pascal com- 
piler assumes you want your programs to run as quickly as possible 
and to take up as little RAM memory as possible. Thus, the compiler 
normally produces object code that stores and accesses data as whole 
words or multiples of words. For example, any individual Char, 
Boolean, or Integer datum is typically stored in the space of a single 
word, while a Real datum occupies exactly two words (four bytes). This 
policy can waste a great deal of RAM memory on data. Consider the case 
of UnPackedString versus TrueString and PackedString. Each of the

three variables permits the storage of exactly as much information as the 
others — no more, no less. However, UnPackedString occupies nearly 
twice the RAM memory required by either of its siblings. This is because 
each element in UnPackedString is stored in a whole word, while each 
element in TrueString and PackedString is stored as a byte. (Taking a 
slightly different point of view, you could say that, for TrueString and 
PackedString, a pair of elements is packed into each storage word.) 

The SizeDiff program demonstrates the essential power of the 
keyword PACKED, which is to force each element of a particular AR- 
RAY or each field of a particular RECORD to be stored in as little space 
as possible (even at the cost of a decrease in program execution speed 
and/or an increase in the size of object code). The syntax diagram in fig- 
ure 1 implies that PACKED may precede the keywords ARRAY, REC- 
ORD, FILE, and SET. The Apple Pascal compiler, however, will pack 
only ARRAYs or RECORDS. While it permits you to specify a SET or 
FILE as PACKED, it takes no special action to optimize these structures. 
As a matter of fact, Strings, SETs, and FILEs don't need to be packed; 
they are guaranteed to occupy minimum storage (in RAM or on disk) by 
virtue of the methods used to implement them under Apple Pascal. The 
compiler ignores, but allows, the keyword PACKED in FILE and SET 
declarations in order to maintain compatibility with other Pascal com- 
pilers that can pack these structures. In any case, it is strictly illegal to 
pack elementary data (that is, individual Integer, Boolean, Real, or Char 
variables), so the Apple Pascal compiler complains of error number 10 
("error in type") when it encounters such declarations. The program 
BadPacks includes examples of both redundant and illegal PACKED 
declarations. Try compiling it if you wish to verify the claims made here 
concerning the behavior of the compiler. 

PROGRAM 
BadPacks; 
TYPE 

(* In the following two declarations, 
the use of PACKED is NOT permitted. 

*) 

BadA= PACKED Real; 
BadB= PACKED Integer; 
(* In the following declarations, 

the PACKED is allowed but ignored. 

*) 

BadC = PACKED SET OF Char; 

BadD = PACKED FILE OF Integer; 
BEGIN (* BadPacks *) 

(* nothing here *) 
END (* BadPacks *). 

Penalties for Packing? From what we've said so far, you might get 
the impression that access to a "PACKED ARRAY OF Char" is slower 
or involves more object code than access to the unpacked version. In oth- 
er words, operations on UnPackedString should require fewer p-codes 
and execute more quickly than identical operations on, say, PackedString. 
You can test this hypothesis for yourself by compiling and executing 
the following program. (Remember, the shaded portions of the listing 
are not part of the program and should not be included in your source text 
file; this extra diagnostic information is provided by the compiler as it 
lists your program during the compilation process.)

APPLE II Outperforms IBM PC 

with 'Supermini' 
Virtual Memory Technology 



If you need to get SERIOUS, POWERFUL, PROFES- 
SIONAL results from your II + /e, for Business or Engineer- 
ing applications, nothing comes close to MegaTASK PLUS! 
Modelled on and developed from minicomputer-based com- 
mercial timesharing software available to large corporations 
for thousands of dollars annually, MegaTASK PLUS is 
primarily designed for the APPLE II owner who demands 
quick, effective analytical solutions to business pro- 
blems — and immediate RELIEF from the frustrations and 
limitations of using hundreds of dollars of mutually- 
incompatible 'canned' software packages, or WORSE, pro- 
gramming in Applesoft, assembly or Apple DOS! 

MegaTASK PLUS is a combined, multi-product hardware- 
and-software package that provides an instant Virtual 
Memory expansion, an Applesoft-compatible SuperBASIC, 
and a series of Business Management packages that greatly 
enhance the power and value of the APPLE II in both 
systems programming and business applications areas. 
MegaTASK and MegaDOS employ multitasking, virtual 
memory optimization and virtual storage technology, which, 
until now, were limited only to mainframes and the 'super' 
minicomputers. The SMARTCHIP™, an Intel 8748 Single- 
Chip Plug-In Microcomputer, provides sufficient processing 

Power to enable your APPLE II to outperform both the IBM 
C and Apple's new Macintosh computer. Yet, all you need 
to begin is an APPLE II series computer plus one diskette 
drive. And generally, no modification to your existing 
Applesoft programs, assemblies and DOS 3.3 files is necessary. 

MegaTASK and MegaDOS accordingly generate an enor- 
mous enhancement to the power available to the APPLE II 
owner, specifically: 

• Multitasking System processing techniques. (As 
many as 16 PROGRAMS or TASKS can execute at 
one time). 

• The MegaDOS VS/OS (Virtual Memory Operating 
System) can place within reach of your system 
MEGABYTES of Virtual Memory. Largest program 
size: 8 Megabytes. Largest ISAM file: 451 Megabytes. 
Largest transparent core array: 75 million 

FP numbers. 

• 100-400 new Mainframe Basic commands bring 
machine-language speeds to interpretive Basic. 
Powerful instructions comprise extensions to 
Applesoft that include many of the most useful com- 
mands found in FORTRAN, COBOL, PL/1, ADA, 
PASCAL and LOGO. 

• Enormously simplified ease of programming — 
modular, insulated routines, localized variables, 
ability to pass variable names. Dependence on line 
numbers totally removed. 

• Substantially increased speeds: program execution 
(3x-10x), file access (6x-10x), alpha data transfer rate 
(2x-6x), and numeric transfer (>20x). 

On the applications side, the 'PLUS' portion of MegaTASK 
PLUS includes: 

• Hardcopy and screen Business Graphics, Calc, 
Database Management and Word Processing Appli- 
cations Packages — plus Custom Modifiability. 

• Editing Systems & Format-Related Commands 

• Communications /Corporate Data Capture programs 



• Text Manipulators and better-than-TSO Program 
Editors 

• Database Management Systems capable of main- 
taining and sorting Supermini-Size Datafiles. Max- 
imum single transparent file: 5.5 million records (if 
80-chrs ea). File access time independent of file size. 

• Report Generators and Strategic Business Analysis 
programs — similar to those used by most of 
America's Fortune 500 Corporations. 

• The only system capable of taking full, transparent 
advantage of one or more Corvus's, Profile's, Ram- 
disks, 5-Megabyte replaceable hard-disk cartridges 
and the coming Laser Disk units, bringing the 
APPLE II up to minicomputer performance. 

The MegaTASK PLUS product package includes: 

• Manuals for MegaTASK, MegaDOS and 
MEGABASE II in sparkling white binders 

• 1 SMARTCHIP™ Memory Management Micro- 
processor 

• Six diskettes PACKED with applications programs, 
including Mega GRAPH, Mega EDIT, Mega TEXT 
and several Report Generator examples. 

• A One-year Replacement Warranty on all products. 

• A 60-day Financial Risk-Free Return Policy. If you 
are not completely satisfied you can return the pro- 
duct in good condition with proof-of-purchase for a 
complete refund. 

• A 14-hour-per-day telephone Hotline to support you 
in your use of the entire MegaTASK PLUS series of 
software packages. 

Because of the much larger amount of memory that is 
available to the Apple's microprocessor through Virtual 
Memory, the increased processing speed, and the integration 
of major applications packages PLUS custom modifiability by 
users who Know Basic, MegaTASK PLUS may well surpass 
or replace most of the worthwhile APPLE II program 
packages currently available on the market. With the in- 
troduction of this product, Quantum Leap has made a 
commitment to be the technology leader in the area of busi- 
ness software systems for personal computers. This will be 
achieved through Quantum Leap Technologies' continuing 
Applications Software Package Series — quarterly diskettes 
ana manuals mailed free to purchasers of MegaTASK PLUS 
for one year from date-of-purchase. 

Quantum Leap software systems are designed to give you, 
the user, powerful professional and business tools with which 
to get the day's work done faster, more pleasantly, and more 
professionally. We live in an exciting age for personal com- 
puting. Multitasking and Virtual Memory promises to make 
any computer substantially more powerful than is possible 
with currently limited memory (Byte Magazine Editorial, 
March 1983). Only MegaTASK PLUS offers you these 
technologies. PLUS, standard Applications Packages to 
capitalize on them — all available for your APPLE II!

In using TestCPack, you should start a timer as soon as you press the 
return key at the beginning of each test, then stop it as soon as you hear 
the beep that signifies the end of the test. A watch or clock with a sweep 
second hand is adequate for purposes of the test, although a stopwatch 
(either analog or digital) would be better. Don't worry about the slug- 
gishness or variability of your reaction time; the test results should re- 
main fairly accurate, even if your reaction time varies as much as two or 
three seconds between tests. (Nevertheless, you should do what you can 
to minimize the variance.) 

TestCPack produces some rather startling results. As we expect, ac- 
cess to the individual elements of PackedString takes the same amount of 
time as comparable access to TrueString. Yet access to either of the 
PACKED ARRAYs is almost 10 percent faster than access to Un- 
PackedString! Moreover, the listing for TestCPack shows that the 
number of bytes emitted by the compiler for the assignments to either 
PackedString (464 -437 = 27) or TrueString (685 -658 = 27) is actually 



MARCH 1984 



73 



7 percent less than the number emitted for the assignment to Un- 
PackedString (241 -212 = 29). 

Apparently, access to Strings and PACKED ARRAYs OF Char is 
more efficient, in terms of both time and space, than access to unpacked 
Char structures. If we believe our test data, then are we to conclude that 
our theory about data packing is wrong? Before we give up hope, let's 
try a slightly different experiment. The following program, TestDPack, 
compares access efficiency between PACKED and unpacked ARRAYs 
OF Boolean:

Applek new ProDOS 
is pro Thunderclock 



fie -snier 



When Apple designed their new 
ProDOS operating system for the Apple II 
family, they included an important new 
function — the ability to automatically 
read a clock/calendar card. Nice touch. 

It means that every time you create 
a new file or modify an existing one, the 
time and date are automatically recorded 
and stored in the CATALOG. 

Now you

can instantly 
know the 
exact time 
your files were 
last updated. 
Apple could 
have chosen any 
clock for ProDOS 
to recognize, 
but they chose 
only one. 
Thunderclock. 
It's the only 
clock men- 
tioned in 
the ProDOS 
manuals. 

That's a nice 
stroke for us, but it's 
even better for you. 
Because, in addition 
to organizing your disk 
files, Thunderclock will 
add a new dimension to 
all the new ProDOS-based 
software. For instance, with

software you can access a data base or 
send electronic mail automatically, when 
the rates are lowest. Even when you're not 
around. And that's just a start. The better 
you can use your Apple, the better you 
can use a Thunderclock. 

Thunderclock gives you access to 
the year, month, date, day-of-week, 
hour, minute and second. It lets you time 
intervals down to milliseconds and is 
compatible with 
all of Apple's 
languages.

As if we didn't need any more confusion, the execution of TestDPack 
yields measurements that support part of our data-packing theory, but 
not all of it. For instance, access to PackedA is around 55 percent slower 
than access to UnPackedA. On the other hand, according to the "byte 
counts" reported by the compiler for each program line, the assignment 
statement that accesses the PACKED structure in line 73 includes only 
one more byte of p-code (539—514 = 25) than the one that manipulates 
the unpacked ARRAY in line 62 (331-307 = 24). So, in the case of 
Boolean data, at least, packing degrades execution speed but doesn't 
bloat object code by any significant amount. It turns out that this is the 
norm as regards PACKED data in Apple Pascal. The designers of the 
compiler and p-machine arranged matters so that the compiler can 
generate admirably compact object code, even for those Pascal 
statements in your programs that manipulate PACKED data. They could 
do little, however, to increase the speed of access to PACKED informa- 
tion, except in the case of "PACKED ARRAYS OF Char." 

Since the 6502 is actually a byte-oriented machine, the p-machine 
emulator program for the Apple was written to exploit the inherent effi- 
ciency of byte-by-byte data manipulation, despite the ostensible sixteen- 
bit orientation of the p-machine design. This special optimization prob- 
ably would not have been possible had the Apple's own CPU not offered 
an eight-bit word. 

Depending on the circumstances, you may judge the decrease in ex- 
ecution speed a reasonable price to pay for the rather spectacular saving 
in storage space that is realized by packing a Boolean ARRAY. After all, 
UnPackedA requires 160 bytes of RAM, while PackedA needs only 10. 
This is because each of the elements in' UnPackedA is an entire word, 
while each element in PackedA is merely a single bit. Since there are six- 
teen bits in a word, each word of storage occupied by PackedA contains 
sixteen different elements. Consequently, UnPackedA is sixteen times 
larger than PackedA. Indeed, any unpacked ARRAY OF Boolean will be 
sixteen times larger than the equivalent PACKED structure. 

Problems with Packed Parameters. Suppose your program declares 
PackedA as defined in TestDPack. What happens if you try to use 
PackedA[8] and PackedA[9] as actual parameters to the following 
function? 

FUNCTION 

XOR(A, B: Boolean) 
: Boolean; 
(* Return the value of A, 

'eXclusive-ORed' with B. 

*) 

BEGIN (* XOR *) 

XOR : = ((A OR B) AND (NOT (A AND B))); 
END (* XOR *); 

A and B are both value parameters. In this case, the function call will 
be accepted as valid by the compiler; subsequently, the call will execute 
without mishap. As we've said, individual, unstructured variables may 
not be PACKED, so A and B each occupy the space of a whole word in 
RAM, while PackedA[8] and PackedA[9] each require only a single bit. 
In order to process the call, the p-machine first constructs copies of the 
values in the two ARRAY elements. Each copy, which occupies the 



space of a whole word, is then placed into storage reserved for the cor- 
responding formal parameter. 
Now, consider this procedure: 

PROCEDURE 

SwitchOff(VAR Switch: Boolean); 
(* Turn Switch OFF (False). *) 
BEGIN (* SwitchOff *) 

Switch : = False; 
END (* SwitchOff *); 

The procedure call 

SwitchOff(PackedA[8]) 

is not legal in Apple Pascal. Switch is declared as a VAR parameter, and 
the compiler will reject any call to SwitchOff involving PackedA[8] or 
any other element of PackedA. Recall that individual data may not be 
PACKED. From the point of view of the procedure, Switch refers to an 
individual Boolean datum. Thus, code within the procedure body 
assumes that Switch occupies a word of storage. But PackedA[8] oc- 
cupies only a bit. In other words, whenever the actual parameter is an 
element of a "PACKED ARRAY OF Boolean," the procedure will ac- 
cess and affect many more bits than that occupied by the actual parame- 
ter. In this particular case, assignment to Switch within the procedure 
body would change not only PackedA[8] but also elements 9 through 
23 — a disastrous situation indeed. In order to prevent such catastrophes 
from occurring, the Apple Pascal compiler will not allow you to use an 
element or field of a PACKED structure as an actual VAR parameter. 

Even though you may not pass portions of a PACKED structure to a 
subroutine through the VAR parameter mechanism, there is nothing to 
stop you from sending "voodoo dolls" that represent entire PACKED 
variables. In this case, there is no possibility for misunderstanding be- 
tween the caller and the subroutine about the storage requirements of the 
actual parameter, since the formal parameter declaration in the 
subroutine forces the compiler to take the storage requirements into ac-

count when generating code for the subroutine body. In order to use a 
PACKED ARRAY or RECORD as an actual VAR parameter, however, 
you must declare the structure of the object as a named data type prior to 
the subroutine definition. We could, for example, establish our "PACKED 
ARRAY OF Boolean" as a named type, then rewrite SwitchOff, like so: 



CONST 

Maxlnx= 79; 
TYPE 
Data = 

Boolean; 
PDA = 

PACKED ARRAY [0 .. Maxlnx] OF Data; 

VAR 

PackedA 
:PDA; 
(* ... etc. ... *) 
PROCEDURE 

SwitchOff(VAR SwitchA: PA; Inx: Integer); 
(* Ver. 2: Turn SwitchA[lnx] OFF (False). *) 
BEGIN (* SwitchOff *) 

SwitchA[lnx] : = False; 
END (* SwitchOff *); 



Given the above definition, the call 

SwitchOff(PackedA, 8) 

is acceptable to the Pascal compiler. Logically, this procedure call will 
yield the same results as 

SwitchOff(PackedA[8]) 

would, were we in fact able to use single elements of PACKED AR- 
RAYS as VAR parameters. 

Notice that we are still unable to call SwitchOff using an individual 
element in PackedA as the parameter. Instead, we are forced to specify 
two parameters: PackedA in its entirety, as well as a number that will 
serve as an index into PackedA within the body of the new SwitchOff. 

Nesting PACKED Objects. Pascal permits your PACKED objects 
to include other PACKED structures. Suppose you declare three 
variables A, B, and C, as follows: 

A: ARRAY [0..5] OF PACKED ARRAY [0. 5] OF Boolean; 
B: PACKED ARRAY [0. 5] OF ARRAY [0. 5] OF Boolean; 
C: PACKED ARRAY [0..5] OF PACKED ARRAY [0. 5] OF Boolean; 

The SizeOf function will report that A and C each occupy twelve 
bytes of RAM, while B requires seventy -two bytes. Each of the matrixes 
has six rows, with six elements in each row, for a total of thirty-six 
Boolean elements altogether. A and C use 96 bits (six words) to store 
these thirty-six elements, while B uses a whopping 576 bits (thirty-six 
words) to store the same amount of information. None of the matrixes, 
however, occupies only the theoretical minimum of thirty-six bits. This 
is because the compiler ensures that every ARRAY or RECORD oc- 
cupies a whole number of words, whether or not the structure is packed. 
Thus, each row occupies an entire word, even though it contains on- 
ly six Boolean elements. In each row, six of the bits represent Booleaq 
values and ten remain unused. The same is true of the C matrix; the extra 
PACKED keyword at the beginning of the declaration is redundant, 
since the compiler will not pack the rows together any more tightly. 

In matrix B, each row consists of an unpacked ARRAY of six 
elements, each of which occupies a word in RAM. Thus, each row oc- 
cupies six words, or twelve bytes. Since each roiv already occupies a 
whole number of words, the six rows cannot be packed any closer to- 
gether, so B occupies thirty-six words, or seventy-two bytes, altogether. 

Now let's consider how packing, especially "nested packing," af- 
fects RECORD structures: / 



TYPE 

PrimaryColor = 
(Red, Yellow, Blue); 

VAR 

RecA (*no packing *) 
:RECORD 



Active 

: Boolean; 
Colorl, Color2 

:PrimaryColor; 
Select 

:Char; 
ColMix 

ARRAY [PrimaryColor] OF PrimaryColor; 
END (* RecA *); 
RecB (* inner packing only *) 
:RECORD 
Active 

:Boolean; 
Colorl , Color2 

PrimaryColor; 
Select 

:Char; 
ColMix 

: PACKED ARRAY [PrimaryColor] OF PrimaryColor; 
END (* RecB *); 
RecC (* outer packing only *) 
:PACKED RECORD 
Active 

: Boolean; 
Colorl , Color2 

PrimaryColor; 
Select 

:Char; 
ColMix 

ARRAY [PrimaryColor] OF PrimaryColor; 
END (* RecC *); 
RecD (* both inner and outer packing *) 
PACKED RECORD 
Active 

: Boolean; 
Colorl , Color2 

PrimaryColor; 
Select 

:Char; 
ColMix 

PACKED ARRAY [PrimaryColor] OF PrimaryColor; 
END (* RecD *); 

Each of the RECORDS defined above is "logically equivalent" to its 
three siblings. That is, each can store exactly the same amount and kinds 
of information as the others. Yet, according to the SizeOf function, they 
all occupy different amounts of RAM storage. RecA needs fourteen 
bytes, RecB requires ten, RecC occupies eight, while RecD uses only 
four bytes of storage. The four RECORDS differ only in the extent to 
which they are PACKED. 

No packing at all has been applied to RecA. Consequentiy, as shown 
in figure 2, PrimaryColor, Boolean, and Char fields occupy one word 
each. Also, each element of the ColMix ARRAY occupies one word. 
RecA contains four individual fields and one ARRAY of three elements;

it therefore occupies a grand total of seven words, or fourteen bytes. 

RecB is an unpacked RECORD, but its embedded ARRAY is 
PACKED. Refer to figure 3. Each of the four individual fields requires one 
word of storage, but packing has reduced the size of the ARRAY to just 
a single word. This is because any of PrimaryColor's three values may 
be represented with only two bits. Therefore, the ARRAY requires only 
six bits of storage, but since all RECORDS and ARRAYs must occupy a 
whole number of words, an entire word is allocated to MixCol. Since it 
includes four one-word fields and a single- word ARRAY, RecB requires 
five words, or ten bytes, of RAM. 

For RecC, which is illustrated in figure 4, the RECORD itself is 
PACKED, but the MixCol ARRAY is unpacked. We've already seen 
that the unpacked ARRAY occupies three words (six bytes). Obviously, 
then, the four individual fields, when PACKED, can be squeezed into a 
single word. The Boolean field Active needs only a single bit, the two 
PrimaryColor fields may be represented by four bits (two bits each), and 
the Char field, Select, fits snugly into eight bits. Thus, the four in- 
dividual fields together occupy only thirteen bits. The compiler wastes 
three bits by allocating a single word to hold all four fields.

Finally, we realize the greatest space savings of all by packing RecD 
along with its embedded ARRAY. Figure 5 shows the logical structure 
of this RECORD. We've seen how the four individual fields, when 
PACKED, occupy only a single word. We also know that the ARRAY 
MixCol can be squeezed into one word. Thus, RecD needs only two 
words, or four bytes, of RAM.

TYPE

Gail, Jan, Jody, Julie, Laure, 
Lisa, Liz, Mary, Sunny, Tracy, 

Wanda 

);

(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, 
Sunday); 
LaundryDay = 

PACKED ARRAY [Housemates] OF Day; 
(* LaundryDay[H] records the day of the week when 
Housemate H does her laundry. 

*) 

Bearing in mind all the data-packing principles we have explored so 
far, you might think that a LaundryDay variable occupies exactly three 
words (six bytes). Clearly, the ARRAY contains sixteen elements, and 
three bits are the minimum necessary to store a value of type Day. (Of 
course, three bits can actually represent up to eight values, and DAY in- 
cludes only seven, but two bits can handle only four or fewer values, so 
we do indeed need the third bit in order to represent all possible Days.) 
Sixteen (the number of elements) times three (the minimum number of 
bits per element) is forty-eight. In an ideal world, exactly forty-eight bits 
(or three sixteen-bit words) are needed to store a variable of type Laun- 
dryDay. However, SizeOf(LaundryDay) is eight, implying that four 
words are actually necessary. Again, the realities of the Apple Pascal 
system design, and its optimizations, contradict our developing theory of 
its data-packing strategy. 

Suppose that a LaundryDay variable did occupy just three words, as 
shown in figure 6; that is, suppose that it were "perfectly" PACKED. In 
that case, the first word would completely contain the elements indexed 
from Carol to Dixie. The element with index Gail would lie partially in 
the first word and partially in the second. The elements indexed from Jan 
to Laure would be contained entirely within the second word, but the ele- 
ment with index Lisa would straddle the second and third words. All the 
remaining elements, indexed from Liz through Wanda, would fit in the 
third word. 

In order to access either the Gail or Lisa elements of the "perfectly" 
PACKED ARRAY, the p-code version of your program must know to 
extract bits from two separate words. To access any of the other 
elements, however, only one storage word must be fetched. Given an 
ARRAY reference such as LD[H], where LD is a "perfectly" PACKED 
variable of type LaundryDay and H is an expression of type Housemates, 
your program would need to spend time checking the value of the index 
expression, H, in order to determine whether the element being referenced 
was one of the "straddlers." If the LaundryDay variable was not ac- 
cessed very often, the overall delay caused by the close examination of 
the index value would be slight. But what if the ARRAY were to be ac- 
cessed thousands— or maybe tens of thousands— of times during the ex- 
ecution of your program? This extra index checking would cause a 
noticeable degradation in execution speed. 

As we've said, the p-machine is most comfortable grabbing a single 
sixteen-bit word at a time. For reasons of convenience and speed, it 
would be best if any item in a PACKED ARRAY of elementary or 
enumerated values could be isolated after fetching just one storage word. 
In fact, the compiler assures this state of affairs by not allowing elements 
to overlap word boundaries. Thus, in an actual LaundryDay variable, as 
shown in figure 7, only the Carol through Dixie elements are contained 
in the first word; one bit at the end of the word remains unused. Similar- 
ly, the second word contains the Gail through Laure elements, and again 
one bit is wasted. The Lisa through Tracy elements are contained entire-

ly in the third word, with an unused bit bringing up the rear. Finally, the 
fourth word contains only the Wanda element, along with thirteen un- 
used bits. 

Summary. Four brief principles express the essence of the Pascal 
compiler's data-packing strategy: 

1 . An individual variable, or an unpacked ARRAY element or REC- 
ORD field, usually occupies one word. There are exceptions. Real 
variables require two words; Strings need (n DIV 2) + 1 words, where n 
is the maximum number of characters the string may hold; and Long In- 
tegers occupy ((n + 3) DIV 4) + 2 words, where n is the declared max- 
imum number of digits. 

2. If allocated as an element or field of a PACKED ARRAY or REC- 
ORD, any object is given only as much storage as it actually needs. This 
is the minimum number of bits necessary to represent all values of the 
associated data type. For instance, the Boolean type includes only two 
values, so the entire Boolean range may be represented by just a single 
bit. The Char type contains 256 distinct values, requiring a minimum of 
eight bits. At least sixteen bits are necessary to represent any of the In- 
teger type's 65,536 possible values. The enumerated type PrimaryColor 
includes three values, so any value of this type must be allocated at least 
two bits. (Note that two bits may actually be used to represent four 
distinct values, but you cannot represent any one of three distinct values 
with less than two bits.) Reals, Strings, and Long Integers may be 
declared as elements or fields of PACKED structures, but packing does 
not affect their storage requirements; such data cannot be condensed. 

3. Any ARRAY, RECORD, or SET will be allocated a whole 
number of words, even if some of the bits remain unused. In particular, 
a SET will always be given (n DIV 16) + 1 words, where n is the largest 
number of values that the SET can hold. An ARRAY or RECORD that is 
part of a PACKED structure will not itself be PACKED unless the 
PACKED keyword is applied to it specifically. 

4. An ARRAY element or RECORD field that is not itself an AR- 
RAY or RECORD may never begin within one word and end within an- 
other. Any "normal" (that is, unstructured) item that would begin in 
word A and overlap into word B, for instance, is repositioned so that it 
will begin at the start of word B instead, leaving one or more bits unused 
in word A. 

For Further Study. Our discussion of packing has concentrated on 
methods and formulas that you can use in determining the amount of 
space that will be occupied in RAM by PACKED and unpacked data ob- 
jects. We have not, however, examined the particular physical arrange- 
ment of fields within that space; nor will we. This thorny issue is quite 
properly the concern of only the most dedicated (and fearless) program- 
mers. If you fit that description, you will find a wealth of relevant infor-

How a fireman and 

a broken leg 

made software simple. 



What does a fireman 
know about designing 
software? Nothing. Usually. 




Meet Dennis Jarvis, a fire- 
man from Southern California. 
About five years ago, Dennis 
was injured in a fire-related 
accident and was confined to 
the house for about six months. 
To keep him occupied, Dennis' 
wife bought him a gift. A 
computer. 

Dennis had never used a 
computer before. But he found 
that he had a natural ability to 
understand all aspects of 
computer usage. 

Before long, Dennis was 
writing his own programs. 
And Basic Accounting from 
Firefighter Software was born. 

It was brilliant. Naturally. 

THE IDEA BEHIND 
BASIC ACCOUNTING. 

What's so innovative about 
the software is its simplicity. 

Unlike other programs, it 
requires no understanding of 
basic accounting theory. It's 
virtually impossible for you to 
type something that'll damage 
either the program itself or 
any data you've entered. 

BUT IT'S FAR MORE 
THAN JUST EASY. 

Because Dennis made his 
Basic Accounting simpler 
doesn't mean it's not smarter, 
too. He's added more prac- 
tical features and capabilities 
than the number-one seller. 



mmPRACTIOAL 
PERIPHERALS 



Dennis' program allows for 
an unlimited number of in- 
dividual financial transactions, 
and all balances are 
automatically updated after 
each entry. 

Dennis added Password 
Protection. So your financial 
records aren't open to just 
anyone. 

You can print checks of any 
size and format. 

Plus, Firefighter can create 
a wider variety of on-screen 
and printed reports. 

AND THE LIST OF SMART 
FEATURES GOES ON... 

Dennis? He returned to the 
Department soon after his leg 
healed, but remains the 
spearhead of Firefighter 
Software. 

In fact, in his never-ending 
efforts to make Firefighter 
the most personal, most 
supported software, Dennis 
has set-up a telephone hotline 
especially for you. Standing 
by to answer your questions 
and provide consultation. 
That's just Dennis' way of 
insuring Firefighter remains 
superior, always simpler yet 
smarter.

Teletellers, Money, and Modems 



A news reporter sends a story to his paper by modem. He could have 
done this by other means (mail, express courier, in person), but the 
modem lets him do it immediately. 

Apple hobbyists "meet" on CompuServe to have a conference with 
Steve Wozniak. They could have met in person, but that would have 
meant everyone coming from different parts of the country. 

Modems do for computers what telephones, radio, and television do 
for people— help them communicate. Modems don't let us do anything 
we couldn't do before; they just let us do things easier and faster (anyone 
who has gotten lost in a terminal program's documentation might 
disagree). 

Institutions that could take advantage of modem-equipped home com- 
puters include banks, supermarkets, and post offices— places where 
standing in line is often unavoidable. 

This time we'll look at banking by home computer. We'll also get ac- 
quainted with a feature on The Source for those looking for someone to 
argue with. All that will be followed by a surprise for anyone who be- 
came angry or confused because of January's column. 

Citi Chase. Chase Manhattan and Citibank entered the area of home 
banking first, followed by Bank of America. Chase Manhattan began its 
operation in the spring of 1981 , and Citibank hit the scene about eighteen 
months later in late 1982. Despite their early starts, both Chase Manhat- 
tan and Citibank are still in the testing phase of operation. Bank of Amer- 
ica's system, which operates primarily in northern California, is func- 
tional and open to customers. 

Chase's Home Banking requires that customers have a set of two 
disks provided by Chase and that transactions be prepared off-line before 
calling the bank. Once that's taken care of, dialing into the bank is done 
from within the Home Banking program. The program calls the bank, 
logs on, performs all transactions, logs off, and then tells the customer if 
there are any messages waiting to be read. Messages and account bal- 
ances are written to disk after each call, but because transactions made 
during a call aren't always processed immediately, balances don't always 
reflect the true status of an account. 

Like Chase's system, Citibank's HomeBase also requires a disk— one 
of two provided by the bank— for logging on to the system, but after 
that's done, the customer performs all transactions while on-line. Home- 
Base processes the transactions the user makes on-line, and balance in- 
quiries reflect those transactions. So a person could find out how much 
money is in his checking account before figuring out how much to trans- 
fer to another account, such as a savings account. After the transfer, a 
balance inquiry would show the new balances for the checking and sav- 
ings accounts. 

Bank of America's HomeBanking is available to users of any com- 
puter, because unlike the other services HomeBanking doesn't require 



the customer to use any special software. All that's needed is a computer 
and a modem. Customers log on through their local CompuServe num- 
ber and then perform transactions on-line the same way HomeBase cus- 
tomers do. (Note: Bank of America customers log on through Com- 
puServe but don't have access to CompuServe itself.) 

Chase's system, having the user prepare everything ahead of time and 
letting the program do all the work, is sort of like using a terminal pro- 
gram's macros. It's organized and quick. The approach Citibank and 
Bank of America favor is more casual— make it up as you go along, the 
way you'd peruse a BBS. 

Checks? We Don't Need No Stinkin' Checks. Paying bills is prob- 
ably the most useful feature of banking from home. For all three ser- 
vices, customers must select, at the time they sign up, which payees they 
would like to pay by home banking. Payees include oil companies, utility 
services, credit unions, credit card accounts, department stores, hospi- 
tals, insurance companies, and just about any other party you'd expect to 
pay on a somewhat regular basis. 

Making payments is simple; just select the payee, the amount to be 
paid, and the time the payment should be made. Chase Manhattan and 
Citibank allow payments to be scheduled up to a year in advance, while 
Bank of America allows you to schedule only thirty days into the future. 
Of course, payments scheduled for the future can always be changed or 
canceled if necessary. Adding to the list of payees must be done by mail 
for Chase Manhattan and Bank of America; Citibank lets you add new 
payees and pay them while on-line. 

All three banks pay the payees on bank checks with your name and 
account number on them; because they're bank checks, they're not in- 
cluded in the monthly statement with the rest of your checks. Chase 
Manhattan lists payments made through home banking on the monthly 
statement. Bank of America lists payments of customers' monthly state- 
ments, and it also shows them on the electronic statement, which can be 
viewed while on-line. The electronic statement has all the information a 
normal monthly statement would have: which checks have cleared, cred- 
its and debits, automated teller transactions, all transactions made for the 
past thirty days, and, of course, current balance. 

Getting an on-line account statement is next to impossible on Chase's 
system. You're allowed to look at only those transactions made since the 
last time you were on the system. The information scrolls by, and the on- 
ly way to keep it is by printing it out as it comes in. 

Citibank's method of showing HomeBase payments is the most elabo- 
rate, listing transactions on the regular checking account statement and 
sending each customer a bill payment budget report as well. The report 
shows payees, their status (active or deleted), customer's account num- 
ber for each, amount that was paid during the month, and year-to-date 
amount paid to each payee. In addition, while on-line, customers can 



>is made during the past sixty days, 
d. One thing you can't do while banking by home 
CO idrawals; you still have to go to the bank to do that, 
s you do the next best thing. HomeBase lets cus- 
checks, which are delivered by mail with one sig- 
one (remember, it takes two identical signatures 
a cneck, and identification is required). 
A handy feature that all three systems offer is electronic mail. It's 
through electronic mail that customers can get in touch with home bank- 
ing officers who answer questions, most of which are related to account 
service. There isn't any information you can get through electronic mail 
that you can't get by walking into the bank or calling up and asking; but 
electronic mail means you don't have to wait while someone contacts the 
supervisor or shuffles you around to someone else. 

Stickup at 300 Baud. Like other banking matters, security becomes 
questionable when a bank's computer is accessible from the outside. And 
the publicity of computer crime over the last ten months only brings the 
question of security more to the forefront. 

By making software necessary for log-ons, Chase and Citibank have 
partially solved the problem. Another lock on Chase's system is the re- 
quirement of a password before the system will run. Citibank requires 
the numbers of the customer's automated teller card and personal identi- 
fication code, while Bank of America requires just a pass code. 

In most ways, bank customers' money is no less safe than it was be- 
fore the introduction of home banking. Chase and Citibank take the same 
precautions here as they have with automated tellers. Bank of America 
doesn't require callers to its system to use the bank's software to log on, 
but guessing at pass codes won't work for someone trying to break into 
the system. After a few attempts to enter a pass code have been made, the 
bank's computer will prevent anybody (the customer included) from get- 
ting access to the account. The valid customer must come into the bank to 
clear matters up. 

How secure a customer's money is depends on precautions taken by 
the bank as well as by the customer. Anyone who can memorize a 
password or personal identification number (such as that needed to use 



mum 



MARCH 1984 



an automated teller) shouldn't have to worry too much about security. 
None of the three banks has reported any problems with mischievous 
callers. 

No On-Line before Its Time. Until a few years ago, banking from 
the home was available only through services other than the bank. Now, 
videotex companies offer it, and CompuServe offers it. Chase Manhat- 
tan and Citibank, which began testing their home banking systems a few 
years ago, are still testing. 

Customers who already do their banking through videotex or Com- 
puServe should compare what the bank charges for home access to the 
amount of money spent doing banking by an alternative source. At Com- 
puServe's nonprime-time rate of $5 an hour, it looks like customers who 
bank through CompuServe would be better off sticking to it, unless the 
bank offers exclusive services that CompuServe cannot. For example, 
Citibank, which charges $10 a month, throws in news and current and 
past stock market quotes from Dow Jones News/Retrieval. 

Banking from the home is only one example of computers shrinking 
our world. It's hard to imagine a world in which everything (yes, 
everything) is done from the chair in front of a home computer. Working 
that way some of the time is convenient; the notion of working from a 
home computer all of the time is scary.

THE NETWORKER MODEM 

Your best buy in modem history. The Networker ", 
a plug-in single-slot direct connect modem for the 
Apple II family of computers. Send electronic mail 
to a friend or business associate, use your 
school's computer, access hundreds of computer 
bulletin boards or thousands of data bases for up- 
to-the-minute news, sports, weather, airline, and 
stock information. 

There's absolutely nothing else to buy. You 
get the modem board, communications soft- 
ware, and a valuable subscription to America's 
premier information service, THE SOURCE™. For 
$129 it's an unbeatable value. 

This is the modem that does it all, and does it 
for less. The Apple Communications Card is on 
board, so no other interface is needed. It's 300 
baud, the most commonly used modem speed. 
And it comes complete with Networker Commu- 
nications Software on an Apple-compatible disk, 
giving you features no modem offers. 

Networker Communications Software is an 
easy to use terminal program that turns your 
computer into a communications command cen- 
ter, with on-screen "help" menus, continuous up- 
dates of memory usage, carrier presence, and 
communication status. Even a beginner can be 
communicating in seconds. 

The Networker supports both originate and 
answer modes, so you can send and receive in- 
formation, in full or half duplex modes. Just plug 
it into any slot in your Apple computer, and then 
into your phone jack. Now you're part of a vast 
network of computers. 

NETMASTER COMMUNICATIONS 
SOFTWARE 

For $179 we include with the Networker our Net- 
master Communications Software for advanced 
users. Netmaster will let you transfer games, 
computer graphics, programs, sales reports, 




documents— in fact, any Apple file of any size— to another computer, di- 
rectly from disk to disk, without errors, even through noisy phone lines. 

For transfering information between computers, Netmaster's su- 
perb error checking and high speed are an unbeatable combination. 
With a Netmaster on each end, you can transfer information three to 
five times faster than other communications packages like Visiterm" or 
ASCII Express'". Error free. 

But Netmaster's not stuffy. It will talk to those other communica- 
tions packages. It's just that they don't work as fast and they don't 
check errors like Netmaster. And Netmaster doesn't only work with the 
Networker modem. Even if you already have another modem for your 



Apple, Netmaster is an outstanding value in com- 
munications software, so we sell Netmaster by it- 
self for $79. Netmaster requires 48k of RAM, one 
disk drive, and the Networker or another modem. 
It can also be used without a modem when two 
Apples are hard-wired together. 

THE SOURCE SM 

Your purchase of the Networker with or without 
Netmaster comes complete with a membership 
to THE SOURCE, with its normal registration fee 
fully waived. THE SOURCE will put a world of 
electronic information and communication ser- 
vices at your fingertips— instantly. Electronic mail 
and computer conferencing. Current news and 
sports. Valuable business and financial informa- 
tion. Travel services. A wealth of information 
about personal computing. Even games. All fully 
compatible with your equipment, and ready to 
use at once. 

Networker, Netmaster, and Networker/ 
Netmaster Combo are all produced in the USA 
by ZOOM Telephonies, producers of the popular 
DEMON DIALER. The Networker is FCC registered, 
and all products come with a one-year warranty.

You, Too, Can Be a Moderator. Anyone can start a conference, 
and the structure of the conference is up to the one who originates it. Af- 
ter seeing the original message, participants choose whether or not they 
want to join the discussion. If they join, they can send comments back to 
the originator and receive a reply. 

A person who originates a conference has the option of doing so in a 
message format or a topic format. A message format means that what the 
originator has to say will be sent to specific individuals. Discussion in the 
message format is on a one-to-one basis between each individual and the 
originator. In this format, Participate works much the way private mail 
works on BBSs. 

The Source's version uses the topic format. A message is posted for 
the general public, and then the originator has the option of making it so 
that participants can communicate with the originator, among them- 
selves, or with the originator and each other. 

Electronic debate isn't new to telecommunications; Participate was 
started on The Source a long time ago, and Conference Tree BBSs have 
been doing it for several years, albeit in a different way. Conference 
Tree is structured in a tree format, with various topics sprouting 
branches, and each branch sprouting its own subbranches. 

Participate is set up more the way people meet in person. A topic of 
discussion is given, and participants communicate either with the entire 
group at a time or on a one-to-one basis. 

Calling Participate "interactive journalism" isn't accurate. Whether 
Participate would succeed with hard news as its topics isn't clear. Grant- 
ed, hard news such as Middle East events, politics, economic policies, 
and other controversial matters would work wonderfully as subjects for 
discussion on Participate. But how interesting they are to a microcom- 
puter audience is open to question, based on the topics currently listed in 
The Source's Participate. 

It's still fun, though. 

Whoops! Department. In January we said that an Apple using ASCII 
Express: The Professional could exchange files error-free only with an- 



other Apple similarly equipped. 
That's not true. 

It's not even close. As a matter of fact, it was a lie. Not an intentional 
lie, but a lie nonetheless. It wasn't meant to misinform. It wasn't meant 
to do anything. It was just there. Somehow. 

We don't know what happened, whether it was the hysteria of work- 
ing during the Thanksgiving weekend or the beverages with a third less 
calories. What we meant to say was that computers using the same pro- 
tocols could exchange information error-free; two Apples with two AE 
Pros was just an example. AE Pro uses the popular Christensen protocol, 
which means verified file transfer is possible among AE Pro, Z-Term, P- 
Term, Modem (the first microcomputer program to use an error- 
checking protocol), PC-Talk, and other programs that use the Christen- 
sen protocol. 

AE Pro is used a lot in examples here, but that doesn't mean we're 
biased toward it. Because AE Pro was the first communications program 
to implement the Christensen protocol under DOS, and because DOS is 
more or less the Apple Li's "first" operating system, AE Pro is what we 
often use to illustrate things. Apparently, it got a bit out of hand last 
January. Not too pro. 

It also wasn't our intention to imply that the Microcom Networking 
Protocol is going to be the standard protocol in the future (read carefully, 
folks), but rather that a standard is needed and Microcom and Communi- 
cations Research Group are trying to set the standard with MNP and 
Blast respectively. 

Softalk endorses neither one (but that doesn't mean they're not good 
products). 

Now, That's a Standard! As for setting industry standards, the 
Christensen protocol is about six years old and was implemented on 
mainframes only after it became a success in the micro community; that 
says a lot for the Christensen protocol. 

It's sort of like the way IBM got into the microcomputer market after 
Apple proved it to be a lucrative one. Innovators aren't always perceived 
as setting industry standards, but they're the ones who are breaking the 
original ground. HI

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? 

Are you tired of waiting for DOS to load and save 
files? Are you tired of waiting for DOS to finish so 
you can type again? Are you tired of waiting for 
your printer? When you buy DIVERSI-DOS"", 
by Bill Basham, you won't have to wait any more! 
Here's why: 

1. DOS speed-up: Apple DOS 3.3 takes 18 disk 
revolutions to read a single track, whereas 
DIVERSI-DOS reads or writes a track in just 2 
revolutions. This speeds up file processing 
tremendously (see table). 

2. Keyboard Buffer: DIVERSI-DOS allows you 
to type ahead, as fast as you can, without missing 
a single character. 

3. Print Buffer: DIVERSI-DOS can use a RAM 
card (16K-128K) to temporarily save characters 
before they are printed. Thus, your computer 
won't have to wait for your printer to finish. 

4. DDMOVER: DIVERSI-DOS can now be 
moved to a RAM card to increase the available 
memory in a BASIC program. 
DIVERSI-DOS, the QUADRUPLE utility, 
requires a 48K Apple II, 11+ or //e with DOS 3.3. A 
simple, menu-driven installation program is 
included on the un-protected disk. So what are 
you waiting for?

' '/4 human being is a part of the whole, called by us the 'universe, ' a 
part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and 
feelings as something separated from the rest— a kind of optical delusion 
of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting 
us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to 
us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our 
circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of 
nature in its beauty. ' ' 

—Albert Einstein, New York Post, November 28, 1972 

"The time has arrived in which we have to realize we are all parts 
of a single living being and develop new kinds of responses and rela- 
tionships. " 

— Orest Bedrij, "The Grand Unification of Physics" 

Without question, future generations will recall the Twentieth Cen- 
tury as a triumphant age of pure physics. They may forget the Beatles, 
Richard Nixon, Apple Computer, and the New Deal. But our descen- 
dants will not easily forget the achievements of men like Rutherford, 
Bohr, Einstein, Dirac, de Broglie, Fermi, Hahn, Schrodinger, Planck, 
and Heisenberg. 

The legacy of this triumphant age is greater than many of us probably 
realize. The semiconducting circuits in all the computers that we take for 
granted today could not have been created without knowledge of elec- 



trons and electron currents. Few physicists of stature actually worked on 
the design of computers, but it was their pure research that made this 
technological boon possible. 

Breakthroughs in physics were also directiy responsible for advances 
in crystallography (the study of the geography of atoms). With the 
development of x-ray crystallography, it was only a matter of time be- 
fore the structure of DNA was determined. 

Little Big Universe. Results form physicists' microcosmic dis- 
coveries have directly affected our knowledge of the nature of the uni- 
verse. Having an understanding of die behavior of subatomic particles 
may help us discover why the universe is the way it is. And vice versa. 

Perhaps the most difficult legacy that we've all had to live with is the 
discovery of nuclear fusion. Physicists themselves realized that they 
were unleashing powerful forces on the world— forces that could be used 
for good and evil, for creating and destroying. 

The push to realize advances in computer circuits and nuclear chain 
reactions was directly involved with our overall efforts in World War II. 
Computers were for keeping deadly secrets; nuclear reactions were for 
killing the enemy. It was only when the spread of fascism was halted, 
and the world returned to peace, that these technologies turned toward 
more benevolent pastimes. 

Today, only a few would argue that computers are a negative aspect 
of human existence. Most would argue the opposite. Where would we be 
without computers? The case for nuclear fusion is not so agreeable. In

the late forties, we could devastate a small country. Today, we have the 
means to exterminate all life on this planet. 

And yet, tucked back there behind all the megaton hydrogen bombs is 
the promise of a fusion reactor. If we learn how to control a hydrogen fu- 
sion reaction (the same reaction that drives the sun) in a safe and eco- 
nomical way, we may never want for energy again. Never, of course, is 
presumptuous. The fuel for a fusion reactor would come from the oceans 
of the earth. Shall we say "until the oceans dry up." 

Likewise, the jury is still out on computers. Physicists are constantly 
increasing our knowledge of other kinds of semiconducting materials, 
such as gallium arsenide. It's safe to say that our descendants will live 
with computers so much more sophisticated and powerful than the best 
we have today that we can't even imagine them. 

Dual Legacy. The harvest (and the potential horrors) that will be 
reaped from our experiments with DNA and genetic engineering— the 
ability to alter the basis of life — may have the most profound effect of all. 
We may have trouble recognizing pur descendants, let alone understand- 
ing their tools. 

For us, the excitement is the fact that there are still sixteen years left 
to this triumphant century of pure physics. In the universities, govern- 
ment laboratories, and private companies are men and women striving to 
understand the deepest mysteries of our universe. One such person and 
his achievements are the subjects of this article. 

Just think if it were possible to fathom all the diverse causes and ef- 



fects of our universe. We would know the reason for all the phenomena 
of the cosmos and microcosmos. The question of whether this knowledge 
would increase or decrease our ability to control our destinies is a tricky 
one. Surely our ability to understand and combat disease would increase. 
Although knowing how and why a comet is headed on a collision course 
with the earth may not help us to avoid a natural apocalypse, perhaps— 
from our position of complete knowledge— we would know how to divert 
that comet so it falls into the sun (knowing, of course, the effects resul- 
tant from a comet crashing into the sun). 

It has been said by some very knowledgeable scientists that the uni- 
verse, on the whole, may be weirder than we can ever understand. 
Etymologically, this conclusion seems to imply that fate or some un- 
fathomable force of destiny is ultimately the referee of the cosmic play- 
ing field we call the universe. This conclusion also implies that there are 
kinds of knowledge, or comprehension, that we cannot transcend. As it 
turns out, the weirder-than-we-can-understand picture of the universe is 
a minority view among scientists. 

What you are about to read, the first of Softalk's Just Think articles, 
examines one man's attempt to identify the underlying laws that govern 
our lives. It takes the form of the unification of physics, but it implies 
much more. Just think of a universe where everything is connected to 
everything else on a fantastically deep level. Just think if you were 
brothers and sisters to everyone on the earth in a fundamental way, far 
removed from color of skin or ideology. It sounds like George Lucas's

Force, right? 

In the year 1984, it is our privilege to report that the bombs aren't 
falling, the superdiseases aren't plaguing us, and the computers aren't 
piping the Newspeak of Big Brother and his Party. And no Darth Vaders, 
souls consumed by the Dark Side of the Force, are rampaging through 
our galaxy. 

We are still emerging from the egg. Our existence is fragile (when 
has it been otherwise?) and some of us live in dread, but the minds of 
men are never at rest. The more truth we discover, the more good we'll 
eventually uncover. 

Unified Thinking. It is an old dream of humankind's great thinkers 
to discover and document the ultimate force in the cosmos— whether it be 
nature, the law of God, or something else. In the course of time, these 
thinkers have come to many different conclusions. Alchemists searched 
for the philosopher's stone — a single substance or chemical preparation 
that would transform the baser metals into gold. John Milton searched 
for a means to "justify the ways of God to man." And modern-day 
physicists search for the "grand unification of physics." 

Soon after finishing his masterful theory of general relativity, Albert 
Einstein embarked on a project that would occupy him for the rest of his 
life. Einstein felt strongly that there was a unifying force in existence that 
has so far eluded our discovery. The man who had so brilliantly 
described the forces that affect the movement of large bodies in the uni- 
verse could not accept the idea that ultimately we live in an unpredictable 
universe subject to more or less random phenomena. He said once to 
Niels Bohr, the father of quantum mechanics, "God doesn't play at 
dice." 

Beginning his search for what he called a "unified field theory," 
Einstein attempted to marry the forces of gravity with the forces of elec- 
tromagnetism. (A field is a region or space in which a given effect, such 
as magnetism, exists.) He wrote in Nature, "The conceptual foundations 
of the (General) Theory have no relations with the electromagnetic field. 
These facts suggest the following question. Is it not possible to generalize 
the mathematical foundations of the theory in such a way that we can de- 
rive from them not only the properties of the gravitational field, but also 
those of the electromagnetic field?" 

The Cosmic Shoot-Out. Einstein published several papers on unified 
field theories, all based on generalizations of his theory of the metric 
field. Most physicists remained skeptical. Einstein sought to give not 
only an explanation of the existence of the proton and the electron but 
also of all the results usually described by quantum mechanics (the gen- 
eral mathematical theory dealing with the interactions of matter and 
radiation in terms of observable quantities only). The skeptics argued 
that other elementary particles (neutron, different mesons, hyperons, and 
so on) are unstable and disintegrate like radioactive atoms into other par- 
ticles". Quantum theory associates with each of these a type of field, and 
a unified field theory ought to embrace them all. 

Though he failed to formulate a theory that would cover all the forces 
of nature at once, Einstein is due the credit for having insisted on the im- 
portance of the problem. This forty-year detour on the part of Einstein in 
no way changes the fact that he was the greatest scientific mind since 
Newton, and possibly of all time. 

In the years following Einstein's death, the search for a unified field 
theory has intensified. Many physicists today are striving for a theory, a 
single mathematical expression, that would encompass all the 
phenomena of gravitation, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak 
forces of the subatomic worlds. (The strong force binds neutrons and 
protons together to form atomic nuclei and the weak force causes certain 
particles to decay.) It has been proven to just about everyone's satisfac- 
tion that the electromagnetic and weak forces are different aspects of a 
single electro weak interaction. 

The next step in the process, which has been proposed in several 
Grand Unification Theories (GUTs), is to incorporate the strong force. 
The problem is that these theories are currently unprovable. The ener- 
gies at which the strong and electroweak forces should merge— 10 24 
electron volts— are far higher than current particle accelerators can 
generate. 

While most physicists struggle with a more or less conventional 
method of formulating a GUT, there are numerous nonclassical, non- 
traditional approaches, some of which are decidedly frowned upon by 
the supercritical physics community. Respected Nobel laureates, like 
Steven Weinberg, maintain that it will take from one hundred to two hun- 



dred years to get all the answers. 

Right now, there are theories of such phenomena as supergraviry, im- 
plicate order universes^ and a host of others. Many theoretical physicists 
are working closely with astrophysicists trying to understand the im- 
plications of the big bang theory, often revealing heretofore unknown 
aspects other*/ and why particles behave the way they do. The late C P. 
Snow once said that "science is an edifice. To put in a brick, a scientist 
has to climb on the shoulders of other men, often greater men." Today, 
the search for a unifying scheme in nature seems at times like a mad 
scramble up steps formed of past achievements. But it is best to 
remember more of Snow's thoughts on the subject: "Individuals, except 
for the odd anomaly who occurs once in a hundred years, don't count all 
that much." 

For Snow, the scientific experience is one that is very often sought 
out for the aesthetic joy and satisfaction it offers. Beyond the ultimate 
question of the scientist's responsibility to society (or applications of 
scientific breakthroughs), in the Snowian scheme of things the intellec- 
tual stimulation that accompanies scientific investigation is usually a 
raison d'etre. 

GUT Feeling. When one reads Orest Bedrij's "The Grand Unifica- 
tion of Physics," the "aesthetic joy" rubs off a bit on the reader. This 
intriguing theoretical presentation, which is unpublished, is not a tradi- 
tional GUT, nor does it follow any specific trend started elsewhere. 

What Bedrij has done that's different is use mathematics to support 
his theories. "Usually people come up with a model," says Bedrij, a 
native of the Ukraine. "We don't have a model that claims to be what 
reality looks like. We've done a very dry unification." Dry? Yes. Unex- 
citing? No way. 

Bedrij's credentials are impressive. At twenty-nine he was the IBM 
technical director at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California In- 
stitute of Technology. There he was responsible for the development, 
programming, and integration of the computers that controlled the first 
soft landing on the moon. He received his bachelor of science in elec- 
trical engineering from the Rochester Institute of Technology in 1956 
and has been a United States citizen since 1955. 

In a twelve-year stint at IBM, Bedrij held various engineering and 
management positions, involving the planning and development of the 
IBM "Stretch" system, the IBM 1410 computer system, and the IBM 
360 computer system. In 1968 he left IBM and founded Advanced Mem- 
ory (later called Intersil), which pioneered the development of LSI (large 
scale integrated chips) technology and computer memory systems. In 
1977, after seven years of intensive research, he wrote the book ONE. 
The book deals with the unity of nature and lays down some of the con- 
cepts that emerge in "The Grand Unification of Physics." 

In the preface to "The Grand Unification of Physics," Bedrij claims 
that the work achieves "a faint glimpse into the much awaited Grand 
Unification Theory," that it is a "fundamental tool for verification of the 
long known truth of the unity of all." 

Graduating Boxes. Bedrij begins his paper with five statements that 
are the essence of his grand unifying scheme: Physics as a verification 
tool "brings alive the structural principle of basic harmony, simplicity, 
and fundamental order underlying the diversity of nature"; "As fun- 
damental laws assume simpler form, the unfolding picture of existence 
becomes more removed from experience"; "In the universal theater, the 
complex, interrelated quantities of gravity, electromagnetism, matter, 
and energy are really the same essence in different amounts"; conven- 
tional data supports the concept of "the unity of all"; and "Science- 
using the interconnectedness gateway — can play a crucial role in inspir- 
ing mankind to harness and release immense amounts of productive 
energy and build a better world for everyone." 

Bedrij likens the "vast organizational linkages in this multidimen- 
sional structure" (our universe and its laws) to an endless series of Chi- 
nese boxes, one inside another. In the second half of his paper, Bedrij 
uses the equations of orthodox physics to demonstrate this concept. He 
has created four tables of figures and several individual figures that show 
the interconnectedness of the laws of physics. 

First off, Bedrij assumes that the basic building blocks, or physical 
quantities, of nature have a fixed relationship to each other. It follows 
that, "as the basic building blocks organize to form different parts, the 
physical quantities change. Just as bricks join to form walls, and walls 
give birth to a house; so, the fundamental building block of space pro- 
duces time, time makes matter, matter gives energy, energy builds

gravity, and so forth. A parallel situation exists in the formation of 
atoms. As the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons changes, so 
does the form of each element." The relationships between the elements 
are shown in the periodic table of the elements. Bedrij demonstrates the 
relationships between physical quantities in a table of physical quantities 
(Table I in Part II of the paper). 

The relationships between physical quantities are not ordinarily 
observable. We live in time, space, and gravity, but our life also encom- 
passes energy, matter, motion, and more. Whether we realize it or not, 
according to Bedrij, we all live in the same common system: "Beneath 
the level of ordinary subjective perspective, the entire web of life is all a 
part of a single organism." The problem of perspective is one that 
physicists have long grappled with. 

According to Einstein, as velocity changes, time and mass change as 
well. Observers in different frames of reference may obtain different 
numerical values for measured physical quantities. Still, the fundamental 
relationships between physical quantities, the laws of physics, are the 
same for all observers. Put another way, the laws of physics (and their 
fundamental quantities) are invariant. 

Sign of the Times. Crucial to Bedrij 's argument is the equal sign, the 
one common element in all physical equations. The equal sign signifies 
sameness and equality on both sides of an equation (such as 2 X 3 = 6). 
To Bedrij, the equal sign also shows unity among physical quantities and 
a "transformation relationship between interrelated frames of refer- 
ence"— a transformation interface between related physical values. In 
other words, "the equal sign couples quantities together." 

Bedrij writes that the equal sign "serves as a doorway through which 
the interaction and transformation of physical quantities, from one frame 
of reference (system of measurement or physical value) to another, can 
be represented. That is, it is possible to transform the measurements of 
one physical quantity into another using any permissible operation." 
This notion of transformation through the equal sign is paramount. 

"To put it simply," Bedrij writes, "the equal sign allows one, with 
clarity and economy of thought, to go from one system of measurement 
(frame of reference) to another. By performing the transformations be- 
tween the quantities we thus can demonstrate that physical quantities are 
interconnected." 

Bedrij goes on to show that energy (W) is connected with electrical 
flux (q) and electrical potential (V) according to the equation: W = qV. 
"We also know that electrical flux (q), electrical force (F), and electrical 
field intensity (E) are united according to the following equation: q = 
F/E. Therefore, through substitution of electrical flux in both equations 
(F/E = W/V), we can connect electrical force and electrical field inten- 
sity with energy and electrical potential (W = VF/E)." 

Bedrij postulates that "all laws of physics appear to have a number of 
other attributes" in common in addition to invariance. Four of these 
common attributes are omnipresence, inseparableness, instantaneous- 
ness, and indivisibleness. As Einstein said, the laws of physics seem to 
be present in all places at the same time, or omnipresent. In addition, the 
laws exhibit "instantaneousness"; there is no time delay between the 
transformation, operation, and measurement of the laws of physics at 
different locations. By "inseparableness" Bedrij means, "The essence 
of the laws of physics and our existence seem to be inseparable." The 
final concept of "indivisibleness" is apparent in the table of physical 
quantities — "individual laws of physics are not made up of parts which 
can have independent existence." The laws are connected and form 
"one indivisible unity." 

The Beginning Place. Continuing along these lines of thought, 
Bedrij defines what he calls "that-which-is." By progressively classify- 
ing a "particular universal behavior" according to the characteristics 
that it shares "with increasingly more laws of physics," we eventually 
arrive at the "highest fundamental principle— the unchanging 'starting 
point' at which each law of physics begins." This invariable, insepara- 
ble, omnipresent, instantaneous, and indivisible "first principle" is 
called by Bedrij "that-which-is." 

To illustrate "that-which-is," Bedrij uses a monetary example. 
When five pennies equal one nickel and five nickels equal one quarter, 
the "common link" is money. "Similarly, because both W = qV and V 
= ES . . . the fundamental principle that is being expressed in this state- 
ment is that-which-is." It follows that the "building blocks" of that- 
which-is are the physical quantities (W, q, V) and the "relationships" 
between the physical quantities are the statements of laws of physics (W 



= qV, V = ES). 

Assuming that physical laws are the same "in all reference frames 
and for all observers," that the physical quantities are invariable, inter- 
related, and unequal, and that most laws of physics define a given quan- 
tity by a relationship of two other quantities, then there should be a 
"global quantity relationship." Bedrij writes, "With the periodic table 
of the elements man has achieved a proton, neutron, and electron rela- 
tionship between the atoms. With a table of physical quantities, we can 
achieve a global relationship among the physical quantities." 

,This is where Bedrij must supply the "proof of the pudding," as they 
say*in physics circles. To do so, he provides four tables of figures that 
have been tested and verified. The first table includes the sequence and 
transformations of quantities by physical value from the smallest to the 
largest, starting with volume and ending with the Poynting vector. The 
second table shows the sequence and transformations of numbers by nu- 
merical value from the smallest to the largest. The third table includes 
the sequence of physical constants by value from the smallest to the 
largest. And the fourth table defines the quantities. 

"Without the relationships of Table I, it would be difficult to demon- 
strate the grand relationship among the physical quantities (Table rV)," 
Bedrij posits. This grand relationship is determined in two ways. Nu- 
merical values have to be found that satisfy all laws of physics at the 
same time (Table I). And a "fundamental quantum-of- value (denomina- 
tion)" must be established for each quantity. To create Table I, Bedrij 
used a trial and error method, wherein the equations were programmed 
into a computer. 

Looking for Links. Then, substituting numbers into quantities, he 
tried to find what "number combination links all the equations. Hav- 
ing done this, we noticed that because all the relationships of Table I are 
united, by changing just one number in an equation, all numbers in other 
equations would change." 

Bedrij found that because of the "multitudinous linkages among all 
laws of physics," modifying any quantity affects both that quantity and 
the "totality." Using personal computers like the Apple II and IBM PC, 
Bedrij has performed hundreds of exercises to validate this. 

The grand conclusion Bedrij reached is that "each law of physics ex- 
presses a quantity relationship; and, because all of the laws are invariable 
and interrelated, each therefore is an expression of one grand relation- 
ship among the physical laws." 

The "coin of lowest value (the smallest quantum of measure)" is vol- 
ume. Following volume are action (angular momentum), Planck con- 
stant, mass, area, capacitance, and so on. Using the "universal constant 
parameters as a measuring frame of reference," Bedrij then performed 
the following conversions: 



217,788 volume units = 

68.52 action units = 

1 ,374.78 Planck constant units 



1 action unit 

1 Planck constant unit 

1 mass unit 



Bedrij is quick to point out that these conversion numbers apply only 
to the constants he provides in the third table because each amount of a 
physical quantity depends on the frame of reference. Moreover, 
"because of the invariable relationship between the laws of physics, 
once conversion numbers that connect the physical quantities are known 
(Table IH), only one point of reference is needed to generate new calcu- 
lations for another table." The acid test for Bedrij 's unification scheme 
involves taking all the equations in the table of physical quantities and the 
numbers in Table HI and cross-multiplying them. 

The implications of this "dry" unification are quite astounding, ac- 
cording to Bedrij. "At the heart of it all — we are truly fused into a single 
body underlying the physical reality. Mankind is one! The world is our 
lifeblood and all its citizens are our immediate family." 

Notes from the Underuniverse. One fellow theorist who is on basi- 
cally the same track as Bedrij is London University's David Bohm. "His 
theory is more global," says Bedrij, but the two are very close together 
in their final assumptions. Bohm claims that physicists have relied too 
long on ordinary space and time as the fundamental categories of objec- 
tive reality. In his book Wholeness and the Implicate Order, Bohm main- 
tains that there is a deeper level of objective reality that he calls "the im- 
plicate order." 

Bohm's •controversial proposals posit that the everyday world of 
trees, human beings, and superclusters belongs to the "explicate" order; 
that is, trees, humans, and galaxies are manifest in ordinary time and

Because our new Micro Cookbook makes it easier 

than ever for you to bake, 
broil, roast, fry and fric- 
assee 'em. 
Not just by giving you 
over 150 recipes— which it 
does, but by simplifying the 
whole art of cooking. 
You see, with Micro Cookbook, 
you no longer have to battle an over- 
crowded, confused box of worn index cards 
before you can make a meal. (A battle which can ruin 
anyone's appetite.) 

Instead, simply insert Micro Cookbook into your 
computer and call up the recipe your heart and stom- 
ach desire. Just ask for a recipe by name, ingredients, 
or category. And because the program works on a 
simple "fill-in-the-blank" method, you don't have to 
be a computer whiz to do it, either. 

The recipe you select can be one of the mouth- 
watering dishes we include, or you can create a disk- 
ette of your own favorites. And you can constantly 
modify your selections, adding new triumphs and 
removing recipes that, ah, bomb. 



But Micro Cookbook is much more than mod- 
ern technology's version of the file box. With it, 
you can also get a clear, organized print-out, of 
your shopping list, quickly adjust the serving 
size, even index the favorite recipes of your 
most finicky eater. 

And it includes a complete glossary and calorie 
and nutrition guides. 

What it all boils down to, is that Micro Cook- 
book will make life in the kitchen a breeze. 

With this in mind, is it any wonder Micro 
Cookbook makes these guys so nervous?

space. Within the implicate order everything is connected to everything 
else, and everything is interconnected in such a way that careful study of 
any individual element could theoretically reveal detailed information 
about every other element in the universe. 

Metaphorically, Bohm's explicate order universe resembles a 
dictionary— wherein every word's definition also contains definitions of 
every other word in the dictionary— and a hologram. The latter compari- 
son offers a way to approach both Bohm's and Bedrij's ideas. 

Scientists make a hologram by bouncing a laser beam off the light 
waves reflected by an object bathed in the light of a second laser and then 
recording on film the interference patterns resulting from this luminous 
collision. The exact pattern of lightness and darkness at every spot on the 
film is completely determined by the overall configuration of the in- 
terference pattern. Thus, every point in the hologram contains informa- 
tion about the light values at every other point. 

To the naked eye, the photographic record of the information con- 
tained in a hologram is a disappointing blur. But if one shines a laser 
beam through the film, a lifelike, three-dimensional image of the original 
scene appears above the film plane. When a hologram is cut up into tiny 
chunks, one can still reconstruct the entire three-dimensional scene by 
shining a laser beam through any one of these chunks. The image, 
though, will be much blurrier than if the hologram were intact. 

Bohm's theory, with the help of the hologram analogy, strives to il- 
luminate such well-known but heretofore unexplained holistic phenom- 
ena as the EPR effect. First noted by Einstein and his collaborators at the 
time, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rose, the EPR effect is a strange 
phenomenon wherein two particles that were once joined together 
display instantaneous knowledge about their former mates even when 
separated by time and space. Traditional quantum mechanics, as founded 
by Niels Bohr and interpreted by the Copenhagen school of thinking, 
denies the possibility of ever being able to understand the causes of an 
individual subatomic particle's motions. Specifically, Werner Heisen- 
berg proved that it's impossible to measure precisely both the position 
and velocity of a particle at the same moment. Furthermore, on the sur- 
face, the EPR phenomenon seems to violate relativity's ban on faster- 
than-light physical influences. But under the surface, according to 
Bohm, the particles aren't really separated. 



The equations describing Bohm's subquantum interactions state that 
in most cases there is no way to determine adequately the behavior of any 
collection of subatomic particles without also taking into account their 
multitudinous linkages with the more than 10 89 other particles in the rest 
of the universe. "Everything interpenetrates everything" in Bohm's 
superholographic cosmos. He has essentially provided the model for the 
universe that Bedrij describes with mathematical equations. 

Bohm is best known for writing a classic quantum mechanics text- 
book and for deriving the hidden- variable theory, as well as for his work 
in plasma physics. Most of his colleagues, including the mainstream Co- 
penhagen school of quantum mechanics, are intrigued by but not con- 
vinced about the truth of Bohm's assertions. Bohm himself admits there 
is still much more work to be done. Likewise, Bedrij— with his "faint 
glimpse"— is convinced that "new vistas of great opportunity are open- 
ing before us, " but ultimately we must ' 'let the future bring more truth. ' ' 

Accelerated Consciousness. If Jonas Salk's notion of metabiological 
evolution (the idea that ideas are to the evolution of consciousness what 
genes are to the evolution of biological organisms) is on the mark, then 
Bohm's and Bedrij's theories may signal the beginning of an accelerated 
phase in man's overall development. According to Salk, who developed 
the first polio vaccine in 1954, ideas determine the nature, characteris- 
tics, and behavior of a metabiological cell (individual) or of the 
metabiological organism (society). 

Bedrij sees whole new technologies emerging from his "Grand Uni- 
fication of Physics"— technologies, like nuclear fusion, that can be put to 
good and evil uses. How these technologies are developed and what 
shape they take are Bedrij's main concerns now. Bedrij wants to achieve 
a global LSI (large scale integration), but with people instead of com- 
puter chips. 

"Specifically, as Einstein and others declared to be true: We are each 
'a part of the whole,' " Bedrij writes. "This single organism, like your 
own body, has countless 'parts,' which— depending on your own space- 
time scenario — appear different. Since our perception is incomplete, and 
we can't see the comprehensive space-time linkages, we don't appreciate 
the positive aspects of our deep connections with each other. 

"A very exciting phase in our human adventure is emerging. We are 
all a part of it." 

The optimism that Bedrij feels for the future of the human race is 
founded on his knowledge of scientific truths. On the surface, it seems 
like we've replaced Milton's omnipresent God with the omnipresent 
laws of physics. But ultimately, the nature of the truth is not as impor- 
tant as what we do with it. The challenge facing us is to keep searching 
for the "ultimate force in the cosmos" and to recognize it when we've 
found it. 

In the words of CP. Snow: "There are going to be challenges to 
our intelligence and to our moral nature as long as man remains man. 
After all, a challenge is not, as the word is coming to be used, an ex- 
cuse for slinking off and doing nothing. A challenge is something to be 
picked up." 

Challengers of the Unknown. At the age of sixteen, Albert Einstein 
renounced his German nationality and became a citizen of the world. 
This bold act, from one who has been called the most unsentimental of 
men, was more attributable to Einstein's negative feelings about his Ger- 
man homeland than a desire to call all men his brothers. Einstein said he 
"belonged to the world." And indeed, the entire planet has felt the ef- 
fects of his work. 

There are those of us who value our individuality and separateness 
more than any material form of happiness. We cherish the right to be 
miserable, content, or continually unsatisfied. The thought that some 
politicians wield the power to end it all is irksome. The thought that some 
shifting continental plate or bulging magma could wreck our lives is 
downright outrageous. And yet we keep on living, knowing that we are 
doing the best we can as individuals to keep our world from sinking back 
into primeval darkness. In a world where the notion of sin is rapidly 
fading, fatalism is perhaps the greatest crime. 

Science and the indomitable spirit of man are the strongest bastions 
keeping back the hungry wolves of racial failure. We must stand behind 
our scientists and great thinkers. The more truth we discover, the more 
good we'll eventually uncover, though we remain forever unsatisfied. 31

The Schoolhouse Apple 

by Jock Root 




Don't Miss the Bus 

Most of us have heard something about networking— the idea of tying 
several computers together into one system— but we haven't heard very 
much. Hints and rumors, mostly, with no details. For example, network- 
ing is supposed to save lots of money, but nobody can explain how. 
There's lots of curiosity around, but very little hard data. 

Well, we have some for you here. This month's column is by Ross 
Lauck, a teacher who has actually set up a network system and worked 
with it— specifically, the brand new Apple SchoolBus system. Lauck is 
fully qualified as an observer. A high school biology teacher for fifteen 
years, he recently became coordinator of computer services for the 
Joplin, Missouri, public school system, and he also happens to be presi- 
dent of the Joplin Apple User Group. For your information, here is an 
account of one teacher's experience with networking. 

The idea of connecting several microcomputers in a common "net" 
has long appealed to educators. Many see it as a way to make more effi- 
cient use of their school's micros. With this arrangement, one instructor 
can monitor, direct, and interact with some twenty students, all involved 
in different activities at separate stations. This appeals to many ad- 
ministrators who must evaluate the use of computers in their schools. 

Is this scenario what your school needs? Does it fit in with your plan 
for the computers in your school? Will it really save you money? Does a 
networked computer lab really improve efficiency? 

Answering those questions can be a frustrating task. Information is 
difficult to gather, primarily because few schools have had much ex- 
perience using networks. One of the reasons for that lack of experience 
has been the difficulty of networking Apples, although Apples are the 
"micro of choice" in the majority of school systems. Based on a com- 
prehensive survey of public schools in the United States, Quality Educa- 
tion Data, a Denver-based information company, recently reported that 
over 55 percent had chosen Apples for their educational computing 
needs. Certainly, then, any networking system hopeful of finding accep- 
tance in America's public schools should support Apples, and support 
them well. Apple recently announced its plans to make networking for 
schools a practical alternative to a traditional standalone computer lab. 
Those plans center on Apple's newest educational product, the Apple 
SchoolBus Network. 

Busing and Integration. The SchoolBus lets you connect one in- 
structor station with one to four disk drives, one to thirty student sta- 
tions, and a printer attached to one of the student stations. In addition, 
with an optional larger power supply you can attach four more drives to 
the instructor station. A printer may also be attached to the instructor's 
unit. 

There are several restrictions imposed by the SchoolBus system. For 
example, the system can't have more than one hundred meters (about 
three hundred thirty feet) of SchoolBus cable in the network, or more 
than eight disk drives at the instructor station. You can't use any eighty- 
column text cards, any card that causes interrupts (such as a clock card), 
any device whose input to the student stations would be interfered with 
by the SchoolBus Operating System (such as the Graphics Tablet), or an 
Apple that doesn't have Autostart ROM. 

The SchoolBus comes in two kits. The Starter Kit allows you to set up 
a network composed of an instructor station and two student stations. An 
Add-On Kit is then needed for each additional student station you wish to 
add to the net. 

Installing the system is merely a matter of plugging the SchoolBus 
controller cards into each unit in the net and then connecting the units in 
daisy -chain fashion with the supplied cables. This should be easy for 
anyone experienced at installing Apple peripheral cards. For those 



By Guest Author Ross Lauck 

who've never touched the inside of an Apple, there's a thorough installa- 
tion manual. 

Not Springsteen. The heart of the SchoolBus, beyond the hardware 
necessary to connect the networked units, is the SchoolBus Operating 
System, called BOS (those folks at Apple marketing sure are clever!). 
BOS is supplied by Apple on disk with the Starter Kit. To use the School- 
Bus system, you must first create or modify a special file, called a Class 
Control File (CCF), contained on the BOS disk. The CCF allows you to 
specify who may use the system, what their special passwords will be, 
the type and amount of disk access each student may enjoy, and what 
special program BOS will automatically run when students first sign on 
at their stations. This special startup program gives the SchoolBus 
tremendous flexibility. The program may take many forms— a simple 
welcome message, the assignment for the day, or the final exam. 

Once the CCF file is prepared, you activate BOS by starting the sys- 
tem with the SchoolBus Master Disk. A student gains access by turning 
on the Apple at his or her station (or if the Apple is already on, by issuing 
a PR#n command, where n is the slot number of the SchoolBus controller 
card for that station) and typing a password. In order to protect the in- 
tegrity of student passwords, provisions have been made to prevent the 
password from being shown on the screen as it is being typed by the stu- 
dent. Of course, student passwords may be changed by the teacher at 
any time. 

Once a password is accepted, BOS is loaded into the student station 
and the startup program, previously specified by the teacher, runs at the 
student station. At the program's completion, the student can run Basic, 
try out programs the teacher makes available, or work on his or her per- 
sonal files stored on the disks at the instructor station. Students can use 
nearly all the DOS commands to create and modify files, all under the 
teacher's control. BOS handles access to the disk drives at the instructor 
station within the limits the teacher has imposed; access is generally on a 
first-come, first-served basis. 

Power to the Teacher. While all this is going on, the powerful 
SchoolBus Operating System gives you almost total control over the net- 
work. You can easily disconnect the link between your station and the 
student stations, use the equipment at the instructor station independent- 
ly, and then reconnect the link. One student station or all the student sta- 
tions can be placed on hold to await further instructions, and you can 
transmit a program to any or all stations for immediate or later use. 

You can also view the status of each student station at any time. The 
stat command shows a student's password, his or her permitted disk ac- 
cess, the program being run, and the last command the student typed in. 
Any student can request your help by using the help command, and 
messages can be exchanged between the instructor station and any stu- 
dent station. Using the look command, you can see a "snapshot" of the 
current screen at any student station. 

Bus BOS. Apple provides plasticized BOS command summary cards 
for the instructor station and for each student station. There are forty- 
eight BOS commands; twenty of them are unique to BOS, and the other 
twenty -eight are the same as regular DOS commands. The commands 
are grouped according to the station(s) that can use them: 

1 . Instructor commands are those that can be used only at the instruc- 
tor station. An example, for obvious reasons, is the DOS init com- 
mand. Most of the commands unique to BOS are for the instruc- 
tor's use only. 

2. Common commands can be used at the instructor station and at 
student stations. They are all DOS commands, some of which 
have been modified slightly for use under BOS. 



It's never too early tobegin. 



If you have children ages four 
to eight, give them a head start on 
the computer age with programs 
from ERIC Software Publishing. 

ERIC makes it fun to learn. In 

'The Learning Line," a curious 
monkey helps your child learn to 
recognize letters, numbers and 
objects, and to associate words 
with pictures. Your youngster 
operates a crane in "The Grabit 
Factory" to pick up number 
blocks that complete a simple ad- 
dition or subtraction problem. 
Any child will have a delightful 
time learning to count in "The 
Sweet Shoppe." These programs 
are just the beginning of a com- 
plete library of fun, challenging 
games from ERIC Software 
Publishing. 

ERIC makes it easy to learn. Once the program 
is loaded, your child only needs to use a 
joy stick or paddle and one key to operate any 
ERIC game. After just a few minutes of 
instruction, your child can take total charge of 
the computer. 

ERIC makes learning positive. ERIC programs 
reward success, but if your child makes an 
error, there are no negative sounds or 
images to discourage your youngster 
from trying again. 

ERIC is 
unconditionally 
guaranteed. Even a 
diskette clogged with 
peanut butter and jelly 
will be cheerfully 
replaced. 





In our fast-paced world of technological 
change, it's important that a child's learning 
processes begin at an early age. With programs 
from ERIC Software Publishing, your 
youngsters can start now. It's never too early to 
begin.

3. Student commands are those that have no practical use at the in- 
structor station while BOS is in effect. They are therefore re- 
stricted to student station use. 

Essentially, BOS uses the same file types as DOS— Applesoft Basic, 
Integer Basic, binary, and text files. For the purposes of providing 
security, BOS further classifies files according to who can use them. 
Three classifications of SchoolBus files are provided: instructor private 
files, student private files, and common files. 

Instructor private files are locked system files that were either pro- 
vided on the SchoolBus Master Disk or created at the instructor station. 
They can be accessed only at the instructor station. 

Student private files are those saved from a student station. Each of 
these file names includes the password of the student who created it. 
Only that student and the instructor can have access to it (unless or until 
the instructor changes the status of the file). 

Common files are those files saved at the instructor station but not 
locked (to differentiate them from the instructor's private files). An ex- 
ample of a common file would be one created at a student station that 
later had its password removed at the instructor station. Common files 
can be accessed from any active student station. 

Almost as an aside, the SchoolBus Instructor's Manual mentions that 
provisions have been made for the instructor to specify volume numbers 
when saving or retrieving files. According to the manual, the volume op- 
tion has been provided in case one has a "multivolume disk." In any 
event, being able to specify volume numbers makes it easy to convert the 
SchoolBus Operating System to ProDOS, which opens up the Apple II 
family of computers to the use of the ProFile hard disk. 

This may be an important point for those who are considering install- 
ing a network. One of the problems with using a network based on floppy 
disk storage is that delays can occur when a multitude of users are at- 
tempting to use the drives for storage and retrieval. Students may ex- 
perience considerable delay while attempting to store or retrieve pro- 
grams, especially if the application programs they're using require a lot 
of disk access. Remember, SchoolBus handles student station disk access 
requests in the order they come in; all stations attempting to access a disk 
are put on hold until their turn comes. By using ProDOS and the faster 
speed of a hard disk, the problems of disk access delay should be 
significantly reduced. 

The Big Picture. Let's look at the relative pros and cons of network- 
ing in general. Is it for you? To a large extent, the answer to that question 
depends on your needs and the goals for your computer lab (there never 
seems to be an easy answer). There are several things to consider, begin- 
ning with the question of mobility. How important is it to be able to move 
the computer systems around? Do you use them in the same room every 
day, all day? A networked system, whether SchoolBus or some other, 
severely limits the locations in which computers can be used. If the 
language arts department needs them for its two-week unit on word pro- 
cessing (the one you've been trying to talk the language arts staff into for 
so many years), there'll be some definite problems if the computers are 
wired into a network. Not insurmountable problems, mind you, but 
problems that may put a crimp in your teaching style. Of course, ar- 
rangements can be made to bring the students to the computers rather 
than taking the computers to the students (as has usually been done in the 
past). Whatever solution you decide is best, mobility is definitely 
something to consider. 

Networked systems return a great deal of control to the teacher in 
charge of a computer lab. If you are at all unsure of how to maintain a 
firm grip on your computer classes, you may find that networking is a 
way to boost your confidence. Anyone who has ever visited a high 
school computer lab can tell you how difficult it is for one teacher to keep 
track of twenty or more students using standalone micros. It's not un- 
common for students to seize the opportunity afforded by the teacher's 
diverted attention to boot up their favorite alien attack games and pro- 
ceed to defend the universe. That type of use of the school's micros is 
probably not a part of your plans and can be especially disturbing when it 
occurs at precisely the moment the superintendent decides to show off 
your computer lab to visiting dignitaries! 

With a networked system, you control student access to computers, 
data files, and software in general. The teacher in a networked computer 
lab is much more firmly in control than is his or her counterpart in a lab 
of standalone computers. While this kind of control over software and its 
use may be useful, it may or may not be the way we want to teach our 



ni 99 

children about computers. Is it what they will find in the real world? In 
the end, the decision to exercise this control must depend on your plan, 
your goals for computer education. 

No discussion about networking in schools would be complete with- 
out considering the problem of copy-protected software. Protected soft- 
ware cannot be used on a networked computer system— not yet at least. 
There are several possible solutions to this problem, but the jury is still 
out. We'll just have to wait and see what the software publishers and 
Apple-inspired secondary industry come up with. For now, if your com- 
puter education program depends on students being able to run protected 
software (your favorite word processor or electronic spreadsheet, for ex- 
ample), think carefully before installing a networked computer lab. 

In summary, the Apple SchoolBus Network appears to be very good, 
even excellent; it's very likely the best such system available for schools. 
However, networking may not be the answer to your computer education 
needs. It is hoped that the issues raised in this article will help you make 
that determination. If you decide that a networked computer lab is what 
your school needs, the SchoolBus is certainly worthy of your con- 
sideration. 31

start with simple and see how far we get. . . . 

A very simple example of recursion is a procedure that spins a geo- 
metric shape— perhaps a square or a triangle— into a blossom. 

TO BLOSSOM 

REPEAT 4 [FD 40 RT 90] 

RT 25 

BLOSSOM 

END 

The turtle draws a square, turns right twenty-five degrees and starts 
over. He'll continue until you stop him with control-G. There are several 
ways we can add a STOP within the procedure. For example, we might 
have the turtle check its heading and stop when it returns to its original 
position. Or we might set up a counter and have the turtle repeat the pro- 
cedure a certain number of times. 

TO BLOSSOM :TIMES 
IF :TIMES = 0 [STOP] 
REPEAT 4 [FD 40 RT 90] 
RT 25 

BLOSSOM TIMES - 1 
END 

Suppose we want to completely fill in a square with color. We can 
use recursion to help us do that. Define a procedure to have the turtle 
draw successively smaller squares: 

TO FILL.SQUARE :X 
IF :X = 0 [STOP] 
REPEAT 4 [FD :X RT 90] 
FILL.SQUARE :X - 1 
END 

Instead of subtracting 1 in the recursive line, we could subtract 3. 
Then we could combine BLOSSOM and FILL.SQUARE to design a hy- 
brid. Let's also add a variable for the angle. Then we can experiment 
with various angles at the same time. 

TO BLOSSOM2 :X :A :TIMES 
IF :TIMES = 0 [STOP] 
FILL.SQUARE :X 
RT :A 

BLOSSOM 2 :X :A TIMES - 1 
END 

TO FILL.SQUARE :X 
IF :X < 1 [STOP] 
REPEAT 4 [FD :X RT 90] 
FILL.SQUARE :X - 3 
END 

This is BLOSSOM2 50 45 8. Do you see that if you want to make one 
full rotation, the product of the last two numbers in the command has to 
equal 360? an this case, 45 x 8 = 360.) 




The examples we've looked at so far are examples of "tail-end" re- 
cursion. The recursive call comes at the end of the procedure. If this is 
the only way you've worked with recursion, you may get the idea that re- 
cursion is simply looping or repeating; that's not quite correct. Let's use 
a procedure similar to the FILL.SQUARE procedure, but let's embed 
the recursive call within the repeat command. What do you suppose will 
happen? 



TO DESIGN :X 
IF :X < 5 [STOP] 
REPEAT 4 [FD :X DESIGN

It looks like we'll be creating a series of squares, each being fifteen 
turtle steps smaller than the previous one. Let's try DESIGN 36. 




Wow! Is that what you expected? It drew successively smaller 
squares, all right, but how and why did the pattern occur? 

When we gave the command DESIGN 36, the computer first checked

to see if :X (36) was smaller than 5. It wasn't, so the procedure could 
proceed to the next command, which was REPEAT 4 [FD :X DESIGN 
:X - 15 RT 90]. The turtle goes forward 36. Now comes the recursion. 
DESIGN :X - 15 calls the DESIGN procedure but changes the value of 
:X to 2 1 . The computer checks to see if :X < 5. It's not. The turtle now 
goes forward 21 and again comes to the recursive call. The value of :X 
becomes 21 - 15, or 6. Since 6 is not smaller than 5, the turtle goes for- 
ward 6. The recursive call this time causes the value of :X to become less 
than 5, so the procedure stops and control is passed back to the calling 
procedure (6). The turtle can now complete the small square. 

When the procedure to draw the small square is completed, control is 
passed back to the procedure that called it. The calling procedure was 
REPEAT 4 [FD :X (21) DESIGN :X - 15 RT 90]. The turtle has 
already carried out one of the REPEATS, so it has three more to go. But 
each time it goes forward 21, it must pass control on to DESIGN :X - 
15 and draw a small square, 6 turtle steps to a side. The result is a 21 -step 
square with small squares at each corner. When that's done, control can 
be passed back to the original calling procedure. All of that equals one 
repeat of the four repeats in the original calling procedure. So take it 
from the top three mores times. . . . 

If you think that's fun, try DESIGN 51. 




Do not get discouraged if you don't understand it. You can still play 
with the DESIGN procedure, make slight modifications in it, and design 
some fantastic patterns. And the more you experiment and see patterns 
emerging, the more it begins to make sense. 

Let's make a major modification in the DESIGN procedure, which 
will then allow us to explore patterns made of other polygons. If you 
know the Rule of 360 or the Total Turtle Trip theorem, you are probably 
familiar with the procedure that enables you to draw any regular polygon 
of any size: 

TO POLYGON :R :X 

REPEAT :R [FD :X RT 360 / :R] 

END 

If we modify the DESIGN procedure to include the variable for the 
repeat, then we can make designs with any regular polygon: 



TO DESIGN 1 :R :X 

IF :X < 5 [STOP] 

REPEAT :R [FD :X DESIGN1 

END 



R :X - 15 RT360/ :R] 



Now that Christmas 
is officially over, isift it time you bought 
the Unofficial Apple Logo? 

Congratulations! Santa brought you an Apple 59 for Christmas. 
But have you already run out of things to do with the software that he brought with it? 
If so, here's Terrapin™ Logo. A simple, powerful programming language designed for 
natural and interactive learning. It's a fast and fun way for you and your family to learn 
about your computer, while you use your computer. 

But with an official Apple Logo on the market, why should you buy Terrapin Logo? 
Terrapin Logo is true to the original Logo. Apple Logo isn't. 

Terrapin Logo was extensively field-tested in schools. Apple Logo wasn't. 
The Terrapin Logo tutorial is written for both novice and advanced pro- 
grammers. The Apple Logo tutorial is just for the novice. 
Terrapin Logo comes with a utility disk that contains sample programs and 
educational games. Apple Logo doesn't. 
For classroom users, Terrapin Logo is available for network environments. Apple Logo isn't. 
And best of all, the list price of Terrapin Logo is $25 less than Apple Logo. 
When all is said and done, it's easy to see why Terrapin Logo, the 
Unofficial Logo, is better than the official one. Find out for yourself. 
And have an Unofficial Merry Christmas.

USERFEST 



Plan now to attend the Personal 
Computer Userfests, the largest 
events ever ... for Apple and 
IBM PC users. 

Userfest brings together two of 
the largest, most successful 
shows ever conceived for per- 
sonal computer users: Applefest 
and PC'83. Now that Apple and 
IBM can run each other's soft- 
ware, and with so many products 
adapted for both systems, the 
two shows merged beautifully. 




At Userfest you'll see— and try 
out— all of the newest state-of- 
the-art products for your Apple, 
IBM PC or work-alike. Each Show 
has hundreds of displays and 
exhibits, and thousands and 
thousands of products including 
innovative new software, power 
peripherals, accessories, sup- 
port services, books and publi- 
cations. Products to help you 
explore the full potential of your 
computer for office, home and 
school applications. 




Userfest features all the major 
makes of Apple and IBM com- 
puter compatibles. In fact, it's the 
largest display of these products, 
and biggest gathering of IBM 
and Apple experts, ever assem- 
bled in either city. Hence, you 
can learn more in two days at 
Userfest than you could in 
months of visiting computer 
stores or reading trade journals. 



And best of all, everything on dis- 
play at Userfest is for sale, usu- 
ally at special show prices, so 
you can save hundreds, even 
thousands of dollars by making 
your purchases at the Show^ 




So don't miss the Personal Com- 
puter Userfest when it comes to 
Chicago and New York in 1984. 
It's a once-only opportunity.

FRANKLIN ACED OUT, PAYS COPYRIGHT SETTLEMENT 



□ Apple Computer (Cupertino, CA) has won 
a $2.5 million settlement in its precedent-setting 
copyright infringement suit against Franklin 
Computer (Cherry Hill, NJ). The settlement, 
which requires Franklin to stop manufacturing 
computers using Apple's operating system by 
April 1 , also sets up an arbitration procedure to 
take care of any future disputes between the two 
companies, according to Barbara Krause, co- 
manager of corporate communications at Ap- 
ple. Krause declined further comment on the ar- 
bitration procedure. The suit began when Apple 
charged Franklin with copying fourteen of its 
operating systems and Franklin responded by 
challenging the validity of Apple's copyrights. 
After a Philadelphia District Court ruled in 
favor of Franklin, Judge Dorothy Sloviter of 
the Third U.S. District Court of Appeals over- 
turned the ruling, stating that Apple's DOS 
could be copyrighted. The case was then sched- 
uled to return to the lower court. "We're very 
glad that Franklin settled. If they went to the 
lower court it would take a long time and they 



could continue to create computers," Krause 
commented. 

□ Orange Micro (Anaheim, CA) marketer of 
the Grappler+ printer interface card, has ter- 
minated its long-standing contract with Grap- 
pler manufacturer Street Electronics (Car- 
pinteria, CA). Orange Micro will now manu- 
facture the Grappler+ themselves, Don John- 
son, Orange Micro vice president has revealed. 
Under the terms of the terminated contract, 
Orange Micro acquired the copyright and trade- 
mark rights to the printer interface card while 
Street Electronics gained the manufacturing 
rights. Street Electronics will not concentrate 
on manufacturing the Echo II speech synthe- 
sizer and on developing as-yet-unnamed prod- 
ucts, said Milo Street, president of Street Elec- 
tronics and the designer of the Grappler+ and 
Echo n. 

□ Adventure International (Long wood, FL) 
and Marvel Entertainment Group (New 
York, NY) have signed a long-term licensing 
agreement that will allow Adventure Interna- 



tional to create at least twelve graphic adven- 
tures featuring the Marvel comic book charac- 
ters. Marvel will create a special series of comic 
books to accompany the series. "By tying the 
software together with the highly collectible 
comic super heroes, such as The Hulk, Spider- 
Man, and Captain America, a cult following is 
certain to develop," said Scott Adams, presi- 
dent of Adventure International. 

□ Southwestern Data Systems (Santee, CA) 
has changed its name to Roger Wagner Pub- 
lishing Incorporated. "The company has been 
getting bigger and we felt it was time for a 
change. The new name will help people make 
the connection between me and my company," 
RWP president Roger Wagner said. 

□ Disk drive manufacturer Rana Systems 
(Chats worth, CA) has announced the appoint- 
ment of Robert L. Bledsoe as president. Prior 
to joining Rana, Bledsoe served as vice presi- 
dent of finance for Shugart Associates and as 
director of finance and strategic planning for 
Xerox Corporation. Rana has also opened ex-

panded production facilities. The new address is 
21300 Superior Street, Chatsworth, CA 9131 1. 

□ EduSoft (Berkeley, CA) has announced its 
solution to the software-copying dilemma: a 
low-cost site license for educational software. 
The site license, which costs $35, will enable 
teachers to make copies of each licensed soft- 
ware package for every computer in the school 
or will let them load the licensed software onto 
a hard disk for the school's computer network. 
"As a former teacher, I understand the limita- 
tions of school budgets for software, and I'm 
well aware of the problems teachers face in 
trying to use a single program at several dif- 
ferent computers. I think it's time the industry 
responded to this dilemma," EduSoft editor 
Steven Rasmussen said. EduSoft states that its 
site license is modeled directly on the policies 
proposed by Computer Using Educators and the 
International Council for Computers in 
Education. 

□ Synergistic Software (Renton, WA) has 
licensed the publishing rights to several of its 
programs as part of its transition from software 
publisher to software author house, according 
to Synergistic president Bob Clardy. HT 
Enterprises (Cerritos, CA) has acquired the 
publishing rights to The Data Reporter, and 
Gessler Publishing (New York, NY) has 
picked up Higher Text, Higher Graphics, and 
The Game Animation Package, Clardy said.

□ Data Encore (Sunnyvale, CA) has an- 
nounced the appointment of Jean Ludwick as 
national sales manager. She will be responsible 
for all sales activities, including long-range 
sales and marketing planning for the software 
duplication company, a division of Verbatim. 
Before joining Data Encore, Ludwick served as 
regional sales manager for Zytron Corporation 
and as a field representative for Xerox Educa- 
tion Publications. 

□ Power surges are second only to theft among 
reasons for computer loss, according to a year- 



soFTAnr^ 

long study of insurance claims conducted by 
Safeware (Columbus, OH), a computer in- 
surance firm. "Power surges accounted for a 
third of all claims paid by Safeware," said 
Safeware chairman David Johnston. In many 
cases, damage occurred even though computers 
were fitted with surge protectors, Johnston .said. 
Thefts accounted for half of all Safeware in- 
surance claims. 

□ Glenn Ochsenreiter has been named soft- 
ware buyer at Waldenbooks (Stamford, CT). 
In addition to his new post, Ochsenreiter will 
continue to serve as assistant manager of soft- 
ware marketing. "My primary responsibility is 
to implement a marketing plan enabling Wal- 
denbooks to become a major software retailer," 
Ochsenreiter said. 

□ According to Dewar's Profile of Computer 
Professionals, a study based on interviews with 
more than three hundred industry employees, 
job satisfaction among those who work with 
computers is extremely high— over 90 percent 
are not considering leaving the field, and 80 
percent would not even change to another area 
of data processing. The study, conducted by 
Schenley Imports (New York, NY), also re- 
vealed that although they are happy with their 
jobs, 60 percent of industry employees are 
sometimes asked to work weekends. Those who 
said they never work weekends expressed the 
highest level of job satisfaction. And counter to 
stereotyping, only 35 percent of all computer 
professionals said that their leisure activities in- 
volved computers. The study also revealed that 
creativity is perceived as the single most impor- 
tant aspect of the job, while paperwork was 
cited as the chief complaint. Although 78 per- 
cent of computer professionals majored in 
math, science, engineering, or a computer- 
related field, the study found that 77 percent 
believe that traditional English skills are very 
important to the pursuit of their careers. The 
Dewar's survey polled a sample of three hun- 
dred computer professionals in six different job 
categories: educators, systems analysts, pro- 
grammers, consultants, entrepreneurs, and 
salespeople. 

□ Microcomputers, development systems, 
software, peripherals, and innovative applica- 
tions are five of the product groups that will be 
represented at the Hannover Fair, to be held at 
the World Market for Electrical Engineering 
and Electronics in Hannover, West Germany, 
April 4-11. Overall, more than six thousand 
companies are expected to exhibit at the Han- 
nover Fair. For more information, contact

Introduction to the Monitor 



When your Apple is running a word processing program, it becomes 
a word processing computer; when it's running a game program, it 
becomes a game computer. You could even say that when it's running an 
XYZ program, it becomes an XYZ computer (whatever that is). But 
what is the Apple when it's not running any program at all? 

It's turned off, that's what: turned off or broken. If a computer is 
working properly, it's always running a program— even when it doesn't 
seem to be doing anything at all. Inside that motionless box, the micro- 
processor is working very fast: executing several hundred thousand in- 
structions every second. All of those instructions have to come from 
somewhere. . . . 

Or you can look at it this way. If the Apple isn't working on a job 
you've given it— computing such and such or running so and so — then it 
must be waiting for an input from you to tell it what to do next. The Ap- 
ple is so complex (or, in another sense, so simple) that it needs a program 
even for a task like "wait for an input." 

Well, let's be fair. It's also doing something else, and a pretty com- 
plicated something at that. It's managing the screen image, keeping track 
of the spaces that could display 960 characters of text (40 by 24); and the 
fact that most of them are displaying ASCII 32, the space character, 
doesn't make it any easier for the Apple. 

Thus, even when the system is "not doing anything," it's running a 
program. This month, we are going to examine that "not doing 
anything" program— which actually does some very important things. 
It's called the System Monitor, or simply the Monitor program. 

The Mind in the Brain. You probably think of your Apple as a 
machine— a very sophisticated machine, born of high technology and 
state-of-the-art design, but still a machine— a collection of circuit chips, 
a piece of hardware. It is that, of course; but it's also more than that. A 
computer is not just hardware; it's hardware and a program. 

You see, hardware is limited; it can only do one thing at a time. A 
piece of hardware may have several different functions (like an AM/FM 
radio, or a food chopper/blender), but it has to be set up differently for 
each of them. It has to be reconfigured by the user for each different 
function. 

The Apple, on the other hand, can reconfigure itself whenever you 
tell it to. It can respond to your input with a whole series of actions, not 
just one, and it can even give you a different series of actions for a differ- 
ent input. A computer deals in sequences of actions, not single actions. 



The reason is, of course, that the computer is controlled by a pro- 
gram—in effect, a list of instructions. When it finishes a task, it doesn't 
have to wait for another input from you. Instead, it looks at the list to find 
the next task and goes to work on that. It is "thinking" all the time, even 
when it doesn't seem to be doing anything. 

This is a powerful arrangement. It's part of the reason your Apple 
can do such complicated things so quickly. However, it imposes one es- 
sential requirement: There must always be a program available. The mo- 
ment the system is turned on, it starts looking for instructions, and they 
had better be there! If the microprocessor does not find the right kind of 
instructions, in the right place, then the whole system will lock up and 
refuse to do anything at all. 

The answer to this problem is simple: The computer has a program 
built into it, in permanent or read-only memory (ROM). This program is 
always available when the computer is operating, so the system can 
always get instructions from this program whether another program has 
been loaded or not. This built-in program is the Monitor. 

So What Does it Do? The Monitor takes care of "automatic" ac- 
tivities, things that must go on all the time but that don't require attention 
(like breathing and the heartbeat in your body). These include managing 
the screen image and listening to the keyboard, as well as a number of 
other management tasks. These activities are simple and repetitive, but 
essential— the computer equivalent of washing dishes, emptying 
wastebaskets, and making fresh coffee when needed. In computerese, 
these are called housekeeping activities. 

In addition to the most routine tasks, the Monitor also handles the 
most extreme emergencies. When everything else crashes, the Monitor 
is left in control of the system. For example, turning the system on 
counts as an extreme emergency; everything in the system has to be set to 
a predetermined starting condition before anything else is allowed to 
happen. The Monitor contains detailed instructions for that, stored where 
the microprocessor expects to find them. 

Another kind of emergency is the reset command. This is a hard- 
wired "emergency stop" signal that makes the processor stop what it's 
doing and start over. The Monitor contains the instructions for starting 
over and can customize that process to give different results for different 
programs. It also handles the processing of interrupt requests, which are 
similar to a reset but less urgent. 

In addition to managing dull routines and desperate crises, the

Monitor can help you write programs in assembly language. It can 
display the information in a specified area of memory and allow you to 
change that information— somewhat like the peek and poke commands in 
Basic, but more powerful. It can display memory data in the form of an 
assembly language listing and in some older Apples (before the II Plus), 
the Monitor included several useful debugging aids. 

Finally, the Monitor is a valuable resource even when it's not doing 
anything directly. Some programs are so complex that they take over 
most of the Monitor's responsibilities when they are running, but they 
can also use most of the Monitor's abilities to perform those tasks. Your 
programs can use the Monitor as a subroutine library. You can make any 
Monitor capability a part of your own program by calling it as a 
subroutine. 

You can think of the System Monitor as the "everything else" pro- 
gram—everything the Apple does, if it isn't following your specific in- 
structions (or running a program you told it to), it does under instructions 
from the Monitor. Even when another program is running, such as Ap- 
plesoft or DOS, it's using Monitor subroutines. The Monitor is the 
ultimate "system manager" in your Apple; it tells the whole system ex- 
actly what to do under any conditions. 

By the way, most versions of the Monitor, as listed in the Apple 
reference manuals, have Steve Wozniak's name on them. When you're 
working with the Monitor, you're about as close as you can get to the 
"original" Apple— the machine that Woz designed for his own use. It's 
a pretty powerful machine. 

Talking To It. Actually, you're using the Monitor all the time; all of 
the Apple's input and output goes through Monitor subroutines. But sup- 
pose you wanted to talk to the Monitor directly, to use some of those 
assembly language programming tools we mentioned. How would you 
do that? 

That question has two answers. Getting in touch with the Monitor is 
easy, but knowing how to talk to it is something else entirely. It has its 
own "language," or command set, and its own way of doing things 
(quite different from Basic). For a complete description, see chapter 3 of 
the Apple II Reference Manual, or chapter 5 of the lie Reference Manual 
(which is different from the Applesoft Programmer 's Reference Manual 
for the He). 

To get in touch with the Monitor, type call —151. The Applesoft 
prompt "]" will be replaced by the Monitor prompt "*", and the 
Monitor program will be waiting to interpret your input. 

Don't let the minus sign of the call address confuse you. It means that 
this address is 151 spaces this side of the last possible location in 
memory. You can type the command as call 65385 instead, if you find 
that easier to remember. To Applesoft it's the same number, but Integer 
Basic, which was the standard language in the earliest Apples, couldn't 
understand numbers higher than 32,767, so —151 emerged as the stan- 
dard form of that address. 

Okay, now you have its attention. What can you say to a System 
Monitor? 

Command Syntax. To begin with, the Monitor thinks backward. 
When you want to tell it to "Do so and so here," you have to say, 
"Here, do so and so." The address comes first, and then the instruction. 
Sometimes you need to type several addresses and then an instruction; 
the Monitor is into addresses a lot. 

Note that these addresses are always in hexadecimal numbers, not 
decimal. Hexadecimal numbers are base sixteen, instead of base ten. 
We'll explain the reasons behind this some other day; for now, just 
remember that the way to count in hexadecimal isl23456789AB 
C D E F 10, and so on. We usually put a dollar sign in front of hex- 
adecimal numbers to distinguish them from decimal numbers: 9 = $9, 
10=$A, 15=$F, 16=$10, 17=$ll,and soon. 

A two-digit hexadecimal number, such as $01 or $FF, can represent 
one byte of information: the unit or "word" of data that the computer 
works with. Each byte can represent a number, a letter, an instruction, or 
something else, depending on context. Most of your conversations with 
the Monitor will be about bytes and addresses. 

Addresses are usually given as four-digit hexadecimal numbers, like 
$1234 or $0300 or $FFFF. If you're familiar with assembly language 
programming, you know that addresses sometimes have to be in reverse 
order, low byte first, within a program; but that does not apply to 
Monitor instructions. The Monitor understands addresses in normal 
order, high byte first, just as we humans do. 



One more point about the Monitor and numbers. It only understands 
hexadecimal numbers, but it does not use the dollar sign prefix. We 
humans need that prefix, because we're likely to use both decimal and 
hexadecimal numbers in talking about a program, and we have to know 
which is which; but the Monitor interprets every number as hex- 
adecimal, so the prefix only confuses it. 

Now we know two things about Monitor syntax: The address comes 
before the command, and the address is in hexadecimal (but without a 
dollar sign). That's all we need to know, for now, except for one warn- 
ing: Be careful with spaces! 

Spaces are not allowed within a command (between the address and 
the instruction, for example). Monitor syntax uses the space as a 
separator; it marks the end of one command and the beginning of the 
next. You can put several commands on one line, if they are separated by 
spaces, but you cannot include a space within a command, since the 
Monitor will treat that as two separate commands. 

The return key does the same thing in the Monitor as it does in Basic: 
It marks the end of a statement. It says to the Apple, in effect, "That's 
what I want. Now do it!" 

What's Stored At. . . ? The simplest Monitor commands are con- 
cerned with examining memory. To see what is stored at a particular ad- 
dress in memory, type that address, then press return. You don't even 
have to tell the Monitor what you want. If you just give it an address, 
with no further instructions, it assumes you want to know what's stored 
there. It will respond by typing the address again, and then the data. 

For example, if you want to see the contents of address 8192 or 
$2000, the beginning of the hi-res screen, the exchange would go like 
this: 

*2000 
2000- 00 

After the first prompt (*), you typed the address, $2000 (without the 
$, and with no spaces), and then pressed return. The Monitor responded 
with the address and the byte stored there, and then gave you another 
prompt. In this case the stored byte is zero, which means that that part of 
the hi-res screen is black. 

If you then press return again— no address, no command, just 
return— you will get this: 

*2000 
2000- 00 

00 00 00 00 00 00 00 

This is called a memory dump; it's a partial listing of the contents of 
memory, according to certain rules. We'll explain those rules in a mo- 
ment, but first suppose that you pressed return once or twice more. You'd 
start getting lines like this: 

2008 - 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 

201 0 - 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 

and so on— one line (followed by a * prompt) for each return. The ad- 
dress $2000 is the beginning of the hi-res screen; in this example, it looks 
like the hi-res screen is all black. 

Notice the pattern: Each line begins with a four-digit number, which 
is followed by eight two-digit numbers. Also, all the four-digit numbers 
end in either 0 or 8. This is the standard form for a memory dump: eight 
bytes to a line, preceded by the address of the first byte, and always start- 
ing on an address ending with 0 or 8. 

The first two lines were nonstandard because the Monitor hadn't got- 
ten into its standard cycle yet. When you give it a single address and a 
return, as we did to start with, it assumes you only want that one byte of 
data— that was our first exchange. If you give it another return, it will 
finish that group of eight (up to the last byte before the next 0 or 8 ad- 
dress). Further returns will produce standard lines with a starting ad- 
dress and eight bytes of data. 

You can also dump a whole range of memory— many lines— with a 
single command. To see all the bytes from address $300 to $320 (that's 



114 



mm] i 



MARCH 1984 



768 to 800, decimal), type 300.320 followed by return: the lower ad- 
dress, a period, the higher address, and then return (no spaces). This will 
give you a memory dump of four standard lines and a fifth line with only 
one byte, the one at $320, in it. 

By the way, the name memory dump is slightly misleading. This 
process does not affect the contents of memory at all— it doesn't dump 
anything out of memory, it just lists what's there. You can dump a sec- 
tion of memory as often as you want, and the data will still be there for 
you to dump it again. 

Let's Store Something New. Now you know how to read data from 
memory using Monitor commands, but suppose you want to write data 
instead. How do you enter new information— for example, an assembly 
language program— into memory? The commands for that are also 
very simple. 

Let's go back to the first form of the "examine memory" command, 
where you type an address and then return, and the Monitor responds 
with the byte stored at that address. If you type another return at this 
point, you'll get some more bytes of memory, as we described; however, 
there's something else you can do instead. 

When the Monitor displays the requested byte, you can type a colon 
(:) and then a number (any hexadecimal number from $0 to $FF, but 
without the dollar sign), and then return. The Monitor will write that 
number into the specified memory location, erasing what was there 
before. If you now type (same address) return again, the Monitor will 
repeat the address, followed by the byte you just stored there — the new 
contents of that memory location. 

If you have just done a memory dump of several bytes, and you type 
.27 after the next prompt, the value $27 will be stored in the last location 
that was dumped— in other words, $27 will replace the last byte in the 
line above the prompt. This can be confusing— it's safer to use this tech- 
nique when you have only dumped a single location. 

If you like, you can combine these two steps into a single operation. 
When you type an address, a colon, a value, and return, the Monitor will 
simply store that value at that address. It would look like this on 
the screen:

*300:FF 
*300 

0300- FF 

The first line stores $FF at $300, the second line asks to see what $300 
now contains, and the third line says it contains $FF, as expected. 

This technique does not show you what was stored in $300 before you 
wiped it out by writing $FF on top of it, but in many cases you don't care 
what was there before, so it doesn't matter. If it does matter, you can ask 
to see the byte before you destroy it. 

You can use a slight variation of this technique to store a whole series 
of bytes in one step. As you remember, the Monitor uses the space 
character to separate commands. Here is where we take advantage of 
that. If you type 

*300:0 1 2 3 4 5 



the Monitor will store $00 at $300, $01 at $301, and so on up to $05 at 
$305. You can enter up to eighty-five bytes at a time this way. If you 
need to enter more than that, simply start the next line with another colon 
(after the * prompt) and continue entering bytes, like this: 

*300:0 1 2 3 4 5 
*:6 7 8 9 10 11 

and so on. 

Syntax Again. We started out by telling you that the typical Monitor 
command consists of an address followed by an instruction — and then, as 
our first example, we gave you an instruction that didn't fit the pattern. 
The normal command syntax calls for an address, followed by a com- 
mand, followed by a return, but we started with just an address followed 
by a return, with no command between them. 

That command, the one-byte memory dump, is an exception to the 
rule. It's the most frequently used of all the Monitor commands, so it 
was stripped down to the absolute minimum— just an address. You can 
think of this as the default Monitor command. When you type an ad- 
dress, this is exactly what the Monitor will do with it, unless you specify 
something else. 

For example, in the change memory command, you can specify 
something else by typing a colon. The colon is a Monitor command that 
says, "In the memory location just specified, put the following byte(s)." 
The colon must be followed by a number from $0 to $FF (0 to 255), and 
that must be followed by either a return or a space and another number. 

When you use the colon to begin a command, without specifying an 
address first, the Monitor will assume you mean the next address after 
the one you just loaded. Many of the Monitor commands work this way: 
If you enter the command without an address, the Monitor will continue 
from where it finished the previous command. 

Other Commands. There are several of them, but we're running out 
of space. We'll mention a couple more, just to whet your appetite, but 
we'll have to leave detailed coverage until next month. If you can't stand 
waiting, we refer you once again to your Apple reference manual. 

The list command is easy to use and quite safe. You can't get into 
trouble using it (Murphy, avert!), and it can show you some interesting 
things. It gives you a display of memory contents in the form of an 
assembly language listing, starting at a specified address. The command 
is L, and the syntax is normal; for a listing starting at $300, type 300L. 
This will give you a screenful of assembly language. 

The go command is just as easy to use, and quite dangerous. You can 
crash the system with it. However, there's no harm in that— just turn the 
system off and back on again, and it'll come up unharmed. Go is the 
Monitor equivalent of run in Basic; it starts executing the instructions in 
memory, beginning at the specified address. This is how you run an 
assembly language program from the Monitor after you've loaded it. 

If you must live dangerously, the command character for go is G and 
the syntax is normal: address G, no spaces. Be sure to include an RTS in- 
struction, return from subroutine (the equivalent of Basic's return state- 
ment), at the end of your program to return control to the Monitor. If you 
don't, you'll crash for sure! 

That should be enough to keep you busy until next month. See you 
then!

Mind Your 





BY PETER OLIYIEKI 




Graphics, B.U.G.s, and 
New Developments in Appledom 

Getting into Graphics. Most of us like pictures. In fact, if we had to 
choose between having data displayed numerically or in the form of a 
chart or graph, most of us would probably choose the latter any day. 

The terms "graphic" and "graphics" are used quite loosely in the 
microcomputer world. They may refer to a freehand drawing made by a 
child, to a business presentation of a company's projected sales, or even 
to a portion of a film such as Return of the Jedi. From our perspective, 
the use of graphics as an aid to business presentations is of primary 
concern. 

In a business environment, data is often best represented as a chart or 
graph. The three most common ways of presenting data are bar charts, 
pie diagrams, and line graphs. 

A line graph is the form of graphic representation that's most familiar 
to us. It is simply a connecting of points on a graph to form a line that 
represents the relationship between two variables. For example, a line 
graph may be used to display how a company's sales are increasing 
over time. 

A bar chart (sometimes called a histogram) is quite similar to a line 
graph, but instead of using a line to represent how sales have been over 
a period of time, a histogram uses boxes or bars. The height of a given 
bar indicates the amount of sales for one of the periods being illustrated. 
Bar charts are more flexible than line graphs. By placing two bars side by 
side, for instance, you could illustrate how sales of two different items 
over the same time period compare. Or, if you wanted, you could design 
a bar chart in which an "income bar" and an "expense bar" were dis- 
played side by side for each year being examined. This would show ob- 
servers how revenue and expenses have compared over several years, as 
well as how they have compared within each year. 

A pie diagram is used to display proportional data. For example, if 
you wished to illustrate how much of the total budget was being used up 
by each of your several expense categories, a pie diagram would be a 
very appropriate way to do so. As the name implies, a finished pie dia- 
gram looks like a pie. In our expense category example, the slices would 
represent each of the expense categories, and the size of each slice would 
be in proportion to that category's piece of the total budget. 

In many cases, the difficulty in preparing good graphics presentations 
lies not with the particular hardware or software package being used but 
with the developer's ability to select the best type of graph to represent 
the data being presented. Sometimes this kind of discernment is acquired 
only after one has developed quite a few charts and graphs. 

To be sure, there's much more to designing good graphics than meets 
the eye, but what meets the eye is important. If you're in the market for 
a graphics software package, you'd do well to consider the following: 

1 . Is the package easy to use? Does it come with good documen- 
tation? 

2. Does it allow you to prepare graphics in color? If so, how many 
colors are available? Do the colors bleed into one another when 
displayed? 

3. Can you mix text and graphics together on the same graph? 

4. Is it easy to print a chart or graph? Can graphics be printed in 
color? 

5. Is it easy to use your graphics in another program? 

6. Can the original data be manipulated mathematically? 

7. How long does it actually take to draw a graph? 

These are just a few of the questions you might want to ask yourself 
when considering a graphics package. Of course, you'll also need to be 
concerned with hardware. Consider: 

1 . What kind of color monitor is most appropriate for this purpose? 
What degree of resolution is most desirable? 



2. What input devices will you need? (You may wish to consider a 
graphics tablet, a light pen, a special keyboard, or even a television 
camera.) 

3. What output devices would provide the best support for your dis- 
play unit? (A color printer or plotter, videotape, instant picture camera, 
or large-screen projection unit are among the choices here.) 

Much will be happening in the next few years to make the whole busi- 
ness of graphics a bit easier to deal with. In a sense, this has already 
started to happen. The graphics on the Lisa and on the Macintosh are out- 
standing. And many of the decisions there have already been made for 
you. There is no color, and very high resolution is available via the CRT 
that comes with the system. In addition, drawings can be incorporated in- 
to other applications and easily printed. 

The future will bring laser printers and videodiscs, along with anima- 
tion and special effects that are only dreams to many of us right now. 
And it's likely that most graphics packages will be part of larger, more 
complete computer software systems and that the standalone graphics 
package will become a thing of the past. Be that as it may, here we are in 
the present with a need to prepare graphics. What are our options? 

Apple Business Graphics. Business and Professional Software's Ap- 
ple Business Graphics can be learned with very little investment of time. 
It provides some powerful graphics capabilities, including easy design 
and display of bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts; the ability to ma- 
nipulate data mathematically; and thirty extensive labeling features to 
use in customizing your graphs. This package should certainly be among 
the ones you consider. 

PFS:Graph. If you're a PFS user, you may really need PFS.Graph. 
Of course, even if you don't use PFS, you can still use Graph; it works 
both as a standalone graphics package and as a vehicle to plot data devel- 
oped with VisiCalc or PFS.File. 

PFS. Graph is characterized by an ease of use and quality documenta- 
tion that has become a standard for Software Publishing Corporation. 
The package provides only limited color and is not as flexible as Apple 
Business Graphics, but it is a good package nonetheless. 

Charts Unlimited. Charts Unlimited, from Graphware, is a different 
kind of graphics package. It's designed to produce charts rather than 
graphs. You can use this sophisticated software to create, modify, and 
print professional-looking charts on a 123-column-by-90-row 
worksheet. 

Included with the software are thirty-six predefined objects and vari- 
ous geometric shapes. These objects can be displayed, moved, stretched, 
shrunk, and replicated on your worksheet. In addition, there are thirty- 
six special symbols available, including math symbols and flow chart ar- 
rows. Text can be entered on a worksheet in upper or lower case and can 
be boldface or regular weight. The screen is a window that shows you 
one-sixteenth of the total worksheet. The feature called "view" allows 
you to condense the whole worksheet and display it in condensed form in 
one corner of the screen for viewing as you continue the business of 
creating your chart. 

Charts Unlimited is a very nice product, and it uses the Apple in ways 
that are new and not often seen. The accompanying manual is easy to 
read and well organized, and it should help you become adept at creating 
a wide variety of charts. If you can visualize either a flow chart or an 
organizational chart, then you have some notion of what this program 
can do. And if you can visualize a chart that would be useful to you in 
your business, this program can help you create it. 

Although it can be used by anyone who needs to draw charts, Charts 
Unlimited is particularly appropriate for engineers, programmers, sys- 
ems analysts, and teachers. It's unique and well worth your consid- 
eration. 

The Graphics Department. Sensible Software's The Graphics 
Department is not misnamed. This software really does begin to provide 



118 




users with their own specialized graphics department. Included in the 
package are four major modules and two support systems contained on 
three floppy disks. 

The first module, the charting kit, allows the user to enter alphanu- 
meric data and then to build a bar chart, a line graph, a pie chart, or a 
scatter diagram with a single keystroke. 

The second module, the lettering kit, can be used to add titles, labels, 
or other lettering to any high-resolution picture. There are more than 
thirty different character styles, or fonts. These fonts come in five sizes 
and six colors, and they can appear on a chart in any of five different 
directions. 

Module three, the graphics module, makes drawing ellipses, points, 
lines, and rectangles easy. In addition, picture sections can be trans- 
ferred, merged, filtered, and reduced. And when you paint your pic- 
tures, you have more than one hundred colors to choose from. 

The last module, the slide projector, permits you to display up to thir- 
ty-two hi-res pictures as a slide show. Pictures can be subtitled and 
shown at different speeds. 

The two support systems are the file utilities and the printer interface. 
The file utilities module provides single-keystroke commands for load- 
ing, saving, unlocking, and generally managing the files you create. The 
printer interface allows you to incorporate a custom printer program for 
use with The Graphics Department. 

The Graphics Department is easy to use. It may seem like we say that 
a lot in this column, but we only say it when it's true. This package has 
some other attributes that make it particularly attractive. To begin with, 
it's very complete. You can use it to create a variety of pictures (business 
charts as well as drawings) and to add customized text to your pictures, 
using an assortment of fonts and styles. In addition, it enables you to cre- 
ate almost anything you can visualize. Finally, it's fun. Many packages 
require more time and effort than the end result would warrant, but that's 
not the case here— The Graphics Department actually stimulates creativi- 
ty. All in all, it has a lot to offer and rates your serious consideration. 

If you're less concerned with the business use of graphics and more 
interested in creating unique art and pictures, various other products may 
be worth looking into. Among these are three packages we'll describe 
next time— The Complete Graphics System and Special Effects, from 
Penguin Software, and The Graphics Solution, from Accent Software. 

Apple III Things. The biggest news here is the fact that Apple re- 
cently came out with the Apple III Plus. The enhanced Apple HI offers a 
clock/calendar function, a lie-type keyboard, a newly designed interface 
board for use with graphics, a better power supply, and an improved 
motherboard. In addition, there's a Driver's Aid disk to acquaint users 
with the way device drivers are used with the Apple HI. Contact your 
dealer for details. 

Some of you may not realize that in the fall of 1982, Apple released a 
new version of SOS. The new SOS is called, appropriately enough, SOS 
1.3. It has a new set of device drivers and is available from your dealer. 

If you're concerned about the fate of the IH, relax. Apple is commit- 
ted to this product. In fact, rumor has it that the III is the most widely 
used machine within Apple itself. And it happens that the III is enjoying 
a steady stream of sales, many of which are coming from current users 
who are pleased with their original systems and who wish to add 
machines to their work environment. 

Lisa's Place. The Lisa has recently undergone some significant 
changes. One enhancement is a new operating system that markedly in- 
creases the speed of the machine. In addition to making this software 
change, Apple is incorporating a 3 Vi -inch Sony drive and an optional in- 
ternal hard disk into Lisa. 

Apple has reduced the price of the Lisa by several thousand dollars. 
In addition, Lisa has been "unbundled." This essentially means that you 
can buy just the pieces you want. 

LisaTerminal is a new software package from Apple that allows Lisa 
to communicate with other computers. It allows your machine to emulate 
a VT100, a VT52, or a TTY. You use it with your own modem. One of 
LisaTerminal 's nice features is that it can be run simultaneously with one 
of your other applications. Furthermore, this package takes full advan- 
tage of Lisa's mouse. 

Apple's Cluster Controller allows the user to connect several per- 
sonal computers. For example, with the Controller you might turn seven 
Apple lis into an IBM 3270 network of terminals. The Controller works 
with either Apple lis or Ills and Lisa. 



A L k MARCH 1984 

Current and future Lisa owners will be interested to know that several 
vendors— including BPI Systems, Open Systems, Solarsoft, and 
Aardvark — have developed or are developing applications for this ma- 
chine. In addition, Apple plans to have a good deal of compatibility be- 
tween Lisa and Macintosh via a terminal emulation package designed to 
allow users to run Macintosh programs on the Lisa. On the flip side, one 
can develop Macintosh applications on the Lisa and download them to 
the Macintosh. Look for Lisa to become a very popular machine. 

Utility Programs. A few columns ago, we asked B.U.G. members to 
let us know about any utility programs that they'd found particularly use- 
ful. Responses are just now beginning to come in. Merle Block of Chevy 
Chase, Maryland, has sent along a program he wrote that might be of use 
to you if you do a bit of programming yourself. 

In printing out answers to a problem in columnar format, it is often 
desirable to be able to align the decimal points. Block's program will 
perform that task for you. 

10 S = 8 : REM S IS THE DISTANCE FROM THE RIGHT MARGIN 

20 T = 0 : REM T IS THE TOTAL OF THE NUMBERS READ IN 

30 DEFFN A(K)= S - INT(LOG(ABS(K + .05))/LOG(10))+(.5 * SGN(K)) 

40 REM THE LINE ABOVE HELPS ALIGN THE DECIMAL POINTS 

50 REM THE NEXT FEW LINES READ NUMBERS AND PRINT THEM 

60 FOR I = 1 TO 6 

70 READ K 

80 PRINT TAB(FN A(K));K 
90 T = T + K 
100 NEXT I 

110 PRINT TAB( 5); " " 

120 PRINT TAB(FN A(T));T 

130 REM BELOW ARE SOME SAMPLE NUMBERS 
140 DATA 1.2345, 2.67, 798.012, 0, -645.1, -0.543 
150 END 

Not very fancy, but it does the trick. Don't worry about how the pro- 
gram works; just try it out and see that it works. If you're able to try out 
this helpful little utility, you should have no trouble incorporating it into 
your own programs. 

B.U.G. Assist. Edmundo Cardenas, of Caracas, Venezuela, recently 
asked B.U.G. members for help in getting his NEC 8023 A-C printer to 
backspace and overprint a character in order to insert an accent. This 
task can be done from within a Basic program or when using some word 
processors. Eric Oshlo of Katy, Texas, provided a solution. 

First, it seems, you must understand that the NEC won't recognize 
the backspace command if it is issued when the printer is in bidirectional 
mode (the normal default). The printer must be put into the incremental 
printing mode, and this must be done immediately following a return or 
the printer won't recognize it. Then a control-H (this is the backspace) 
must be inserted immediately after the character to be overprinted. Thus, 
an escape after a return is used to put the printer in the proper mode and 
a control-H causes a backspace; your accent character can then be in- 
serted. 

One problem that may occur: The accent mark may be too low and 
actually touch the character that it's accenting. While this can be han- 
dled, it's a bit difficult to do because of the keystrokes needed to control 
the one-half line feeds necessary to print the accent mark properly. Once 
the backspace has been executed, a reverse one-half line feed can be ac- 
complished by pressing escape R, escape T12, and control-J. After the 
accent mark is printed, pressing escape F, control-J, and escape A will 
execute a forward one-half line feed and thus return you to the default 
line spacing of six lines per inch. The accent mark could be moved closer 
to the character by using some number less than 12 in the reverse line 
feed instruction above. 

A second problem may be the actual creation of the accent character. 
This character is ASCII 96 and cannot be accessed directly from the Ap- 
ple II keyboard. The Videx Enhancer II gives the user access to the full 
ASCII character set, so if you plan to work with many of the special 
characters that aren't standard with the Apple, you'll likely find this 
product of value. ~M

quikLoader 




Designed by Jim Sather 



SPEED 

The quikLoader is the fastest way to load programs, 
BAR NONEI Applesoft, Integer, or machine language 
programs can be loaded in fractions of a second. 
More importantly, DOS is instantly loaded every time 
the computer is turned on. Integer is even loaded in 
the language card. This process takes less than a 
second, saving valuable time. The quikLoader operat- 
ing system can keep track of over 250 programs 
stored in PROMs (Programmable Read Only Memory). 
The user simply transfers any of these programs to 
PROM using the instructions packed with the unit, 
and any PROM programmer, or we will provide this 
service. 

CONVENIENCE 

How many times have you started to work with a 
frequently used program, only to find that you have 
misplaced the disk, or worse, had the disk damaged, 
or the dreaded "I/O ERROR'' message flash on the 
screen. With the quikLoader, these nightmares can 
be a thing of the past. Frequently used programs are 
available instantly when you need them, without 
having to look for the disk, or hoping that the lengthy 
disk loading procedure goes smoothly. If you do need 
to use standard disks, the quikLoader even speeds up 
that process. For example, to catalog a disk, just press 
ctrl-C Reset. To run the "HELLO" program, press crtl- 
H Reset.Other "one- key" commands include entering 



the monitor, booting the disk, calling up the mini- 
assembler, <:U. Tin: major difference between the 
quikLoader and the other ROM cards if, the complete- 
operating system (in PROM) This enables you to get 
the quikLoader catalog on the screen (by pressing 
ctrl-Q Reset), allowing you to see what programs arc- 
available Loading or running of the desired program 
requires one keypress. Program parameters, such as 
starting address and length of machine language 
programs can be seen on the catalog screen, if 
desired. 
VERSATILE 

The quikLoader willacceptanyofthe popular PROMS 
available on the market, 2716, 2732, 2764, 27128 
and 27256 These types may be freely intermixed on 
the card. Long programs can take up more than one 
PROM, or several short programs may be stored on 
one PROM. The quikLoader operating system even 
handles multiple cards, so you can easily double or 
triple the amount of PROM memory available. The 
ultimate memory capacity of one card is 256K, so 
many frequently used programs and utilities can be 
stored. We even start your library of programs with 
the most popular utilities on the card, FID and 
COPYA. Now, if you have to copy a disk, you don't 
have to search for the master disk. You can start 
copying within 3 seconds after turning on the 
computer. 

INCREASED DISK CAPACITY 

Since DOS is loaded from the quikLoader every time 
the computer is turned on, it is not necessary to take 
up valuable disk space with DOS. This will give you 
more than 10% additional space for programs and 
data on your disks. 
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS 

The quikLoader plugs into any slot of the APPLE ] [+ 
or lie. If used in a ] (+. a slightly modified 16K 
memory card is required in slot 0. A disk drive is 
required to save data.

The magic of dance moves always ahead. It reaches above and 
beyond; like in love, like in faith, the artist must adventure, never look 
back. 

— Helen Obolensky 



Soon after his leap to freedom in 1961, Russian ballet dancer 
Rudolph Nureyev was asked to perform Fokine's Le Spectre de la Rose 
on German television, in a program arranged by Swiss ballet master 
Vaslav Orlikovsky. Le Spectre is a role made famous at the turn of the 
century by Nureyev 's great predecessor, Vaslav Nijinsky. Both dancers 
had been tutored at the Kirov Ballet in Moscow. 

Nureyev was under tremendous pressure at that time, according to 
biographer Clive Barnes. "He was not told what to do, he was expected 
to know the Fokine choreography, which he had never seen." So 
Nureyev crammed. "He studied a few photographs of Nijinsky and, with 
a little help from a few friends, improvised and hoped for the best." 
Somehow, it worked. 

For the next seventeen years, Nureyev shied away from the piece. In 
1978 he performed it in New York with the London Festival Ballet. He

had obviously read more on Nijinsky, notes Barnes. "In this Beriosoff 
staging," he writes, "Nureyev made wonderful use of the weaving, Ori- 
ental ports de bras— those tendril-like arm movements, like art nouveau 
traceries— the big leaps, the delicate beaten steps, and, of course, the 
famous arabesque penchee against the chair. He was a spirit, a poem, an 
image never quite lost ... he was a rose with a difference, one with all 
the style to recall that marvelous Cocteau poster of Nijinsky in the very 
role." 

Put On Your Red Shoes and Dance the Blues. Not only was 
Nureyev 's a rose with a difference, it was a different rose. The choreog- 
raphy of Nijinsky's rose was never recorded, either on paper or on film. 
And Nureyev was never able to go back to the Kirov and hunt down an 
elder dancer who had seen the legendary Nijinsky perform the role. 

The passing on of the choreography to a dance is an oral tradition in 
the dance world. Precious few works are committed to paper— the Bu- 
reau of Dance Notation lists around three hundred, and most of those are 
classical ballets. That's why the ephemeral art form of dance is called the 
illiterate art, even by those who practice it. 

In contrast to Nureyev 's dance dilemma, the music that accompanies

toire," he explains. "They pass on choreography by a word-of-mouth 
notation system. ' ' 

That's the way it's always been in the dance world and despite ad- 
vances in film, video, and written notation, that's the way it's likely to 
stay for some time— unless Dombrower's Apple software has any 
influence. 

Under the Moonlight, the Serious Moonlight. When you pass a 
billboard touting a top-selling piece of software— right up there in the sky 
alongside America's auto, bottled water, and sport shoe icons— you 
know you have entered Palo Alto, California, the town that bits built. 

Nestled among rugged eucalyptus trees, planted decades ago as wind 
breakers when the land was a farm, Stanford University does not go un- 
touched by all the microcomputer commerce raging around it. Innova- 
tions from the valley influence all university departments, from com- 
puter science to electrical engineering. One area of influence would 
surprise some: Few people realize that Apples can dance. 

The dance division at Stanford is part of the athletics department. 
"Just like all the other departments, we're exposed to the advances of 
Silicon Valley and aware of the computer's influence," says Diane Free- 













Le Spectre de la Rose— Invitation to the Dance, written in 1819 by Carl 
Maria von Weber— was available in sheet music form in Nijinsky's time 
and continues to be available more than 150 years later. 

Only one piece of Nijinsky's original choreography survives. His 
scandalous Faune, with its "two-dimensional, frieze-like choreogra- 
phy" and "suggestion of erotic rites and wall paintings," is part of the 
repertory of the Ballet Rambert of London, England, passed on from 
dancer to dancer. 

Many schemes of written notation for the dance have been created 
over the years, but the task is not as simple as that of a composer jotting 
down the notes to a score. A current standard is a method known as 
Labannotation, a symbol system called "specific enough to record the 
flutter of an eyelash" that can make a dance look, on paper, like the baf- 
fling floor plan of a house. 

Using the system requires considerable expertise. "Ninety-five per- 
cent of the dancers today are either not going to learn Labannotation or 
have developed a dislike for the concept," says choreographer- 
programmer Eddie Dombrower. Big companies don't have as much of a 
problem with notation, he adds, because they have all their old dancers 
around. "The problem is with the smaller, regional companies and in the 
early stages of a dancer's development. 

"When dancers get older, instead of retiring to a life in the country, 
they retire to a life of teaching," says Dombrower, who's committed 
to advancing dance literacy with his DOM (Dance on Microcomput- 
er) Notation System, a 3-D animation program for notating and creat- 
ing dances. 

"Older dancers teach classes in technique and variation, or reper- 



cero, dance division coordinator. "Why should dance be left out?" 
Indeed. 

Freccero plans to incorporate Dombrower's software into her nota- 
tion course, using it to demonstrate the future of dance notation. She also 
plans to compose on it herself, seeing it as "something to enrich the 
process of choreography," she says — a process she admits is something 
of a blessing and a curse. With the entire tradition of dance to fall back 
on, she doesn't feel she'll be "boxed in by shapes on the screen." 

Philosophically, she adds, "One would rather shape the future than 
be shaped by it, so we dived right into using computers. " Which is how 
dance instructors came to be pulling boards out of Apples at Stanford. 

Four years ago, a graduate student in dance (and a statistics major) 
performed his thesis concert based on a mainframe computer program 
he'd written that incorporated chance elements into composition. The re- 
sult, in a dance titled Cavinu, was random selection of movement. 
Choreography had met the computer. 

The first time micros were used as part of the curriculum was a 
children's dance workshop last summer. Fourteen young dancers, six to 
twelve years old, would spend an hour working on choreography, then 
march over to the campus computer center to sit in front of some per- 
sonal computers. Using a simple drawing program, they were instructed 
to diagram their dances. "The results weren't stick figures, as one might 
expect," says instructor Elizabeth Larkam, "but floor pattern sketches 
complete with rhythm and music notes." 

This year Larkam, codirector of children's dance, rolls an Apple on a 
cart into her weekly modern dance and rhythm and movement classes. 
The youngsters put down their drumsticks, shakers, and bells to poke at 



THE FIRST OF ITS KIND 



LETTERWRITER 

Typing a letter is not the job for a Word Processor. The power you need is not there, and the power you don't is getting in your way, 
slowing things down. To type a letter more efficiently than on a typewriter you must have a program designed for that specific pur- 
pose. You need LETTERWRITER. To our knowledge that is the first program that has been fully designed to meet the requirements 
of letter typing. It is therefore also the best, and we are willing to guarantee that with LETTERWRITER you can outperform any other 
software in typing a normal letter no matter what the price. Read the specs below and you will understand why we are so confident! 



FORMATTING 

All vertical and horizontal spacing can be set for any style of 
business or personal letter. This means that you can concen- 
trate on the typing and forget tabs and linefeeds, everything 
gets to the right place by itself. 

TEXT ENTRY & EDITING 

Because LETTERWRITER is self-formatting, and complex 
tables or other structures as a rule are not part of letters, text 
can be entered in a dump fashion, much the same way as a 
dictation to a secretary. Full editing features are of course in- 
cluded, but there is no need to "see what you get" as you 
know that already from setting the formatting. An 80 column 
card is totally unnecessary. Another advantage is that typing 
and editing is in the same mode and doesn't require any 
switching. 

OPERATION 

LETTERWRITER is an easy program to master, with all com- 
mands available to the user, always explained on the screens. 
After reading the manual for 15 minutes you should be ready 
to start, and the first perfect letter should come out from the 
printer in another 15 minutes. This is possible only because 
LETTERWRITER is designed not to be a sophisticated Word 
Processor but an efficient tool for producing letters. 

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS 

Apple II + or lie with 48K and 1 disc drive. 



NAME & ADDRESS FILE 

Time and efforts are often wasted on looking up correct spell- 
ing of the name, and accurate address. LETTERWRITER has 
therefore an accumulative file for more than 400 records, 
which can be accessed directly. A search typically takes 2 
seconds, and can be alphabetical, numerical or any combin- 
ation. As there is no re-typing involved the name and address 
is always correct. 

STANDARD PHRASES 

Certain parts of letters involve a lot of repetitive typing. It is 
therefore useful to have a selection of phrases to call up. With 
LETTERWRITER you make your own phrases and signing 
patterns, to be used for different types of letters. 

OTHER FEATURES 

Name and address on letterhead or envelope or both; Left 
and right justification, underlining and dummy spaces; Coun- 
try in address format; Mail-Merge with manual selection; Util- 
ity programs for making back-up disk copies and purging 
Name file, and more. 

INTRODUCTORY OFFER 

LETTERWRITER is presently available at selected software 
dealers or directly from INNOVA Systems for the special price 
of $45.00. At this low price it is a standard complement to any 
Word Processor and an obvious choice for those only inter- 
ested in letter typing. Still hesitating? Now about our guaran- 
tee! Should you for any reason not be satisfied with LETTER- 
WRITER and return the program disk within 15 days, we will 
refund your money provided the disk has not been copied.

the keys of a new kind of instrument. Some are eager — they press any 
key to begin. Some are shy and wait to be shown what to do— just as they 
did when they were chosen to beat out a rhythm on a big bass drum. At 
this age, any machine can be intimidating. 

Fall into My Arms and Tremble like a Flower. What the children 
are attempting to do is make the wiry, three-dimensional figure in Dom- 
brower's Notation System move and turn. With varying degrees of suc- 
cess, children make the figure move its arm or leg, bend forward, or ex- 
ecute a full 360-degree turn. They find it most exciting when they can get 
the figure to do things a real human being can't, like turn an armless cart- 
wheel or walk away from its head. 

After the demonstration, Larkam polls her students. They say they 
would rather watch a real person dance, but that it was fun on the com- 
puter. What they're all too young to realize is that what's fun for them to- 
day might be tomorrow's software for choreography and dance notation. 

The DOM software is a tool for both learning and designing dances. 
It works like a frame-by-frame animation camera, run by a simple ar- 
row system with full-sentence commands. Even the most advanced 
use— choreographing a dance— takes only a few minutes to learn and in- 
volves memorizing only a few extra commands. 

Written in machine language, the program runs in conjunction with a 
board designed by Dombrower's partner, Mike Lopez, a biomedical 
engineer who also has a hearing aid and a car alarm system to his de- 
sign credit. 

"The math board freed up my work," says Dombrower. True anima- 
tion would require a million to a million and a half calculations per sec- 
ond. Some unconventional math tricks on Dombrower's part, in com- 
bination with Lopez's board, speed up the calculating process to simulate 
the real-time , C AD-C AM-like animation of the central figure . The board 
also serves to copy-protect his software, since the program won't run 
without the handmade device in slot 3 . 

The system works like a word processor. A user places the figure into 
a position he wants from the keyboard, using the arrow keys or punching 
in the number of a desired angle. The position is then saved, and each 
step becomes part of an animated dance phrase, able to play back at six 
frames per second. 

The original menu-driven version of the program, used by Stanford 
until last month, held eighty-five frames of movement. Dombrower's 
current version holds more. "That first version held ten to fifteen sec- 
onds of movement in memory before it had to go back to the disk," 
Dombrower explains. "The current system holds 25 to thirty." The 
next version will include a condensing routine that will allow three to 
five minutes of finished dance "even in a 48K machine." 

"A dancer normally learns only fifteen to twenty seconds of move- 



ment at a crack, and learning from the screen isn't as tiresome as 
turning pages." 

Demonstrating the program, Dombrower happens upon a particular 
position he likes and saves it to a special disk. That's one of the random 
beauties of his system. "It's real easy to pussyfoot around in the pro- 
gram, as soon as you know how it works," he says. He is saving steps to 
incorporate into a dance. 

When You Say Run, I'll Run with You. These days, Dombrower is 
a wanted man. When Larkam read about his work in a national 
magazine, she was determined to hunt him down. It was Larkam who 
proposed Stanford as the first test site for Dombrower's program. He 
was delighted. 

"We saw Eddie's program as a beginning," says Larkam. "It's a 
step on the way to composing dance on a computer. Ultimately, we envi- 
sion a system with many figures available to manipulate in many ways to 
compose a dance. Unless there's some active support of the DOM sys- 
tem now, that may never happen." 

Larkam will expand its use in her classes to include having the 
children designing dances with steps they've created on the Apple, or 
having them interpret dances they see on the screen. The dance division 
sees the DOM system as a multifunctional learning package. Since it 
was introduced late in the school year, only Larkam is using it at present. 
Next year, as part of the full curriculum, the program will get a workout. 

What surprised Dombrower most about Stanford's eagerness to try 
his system was their keenness to use it as a tool for choreography. 
"Originally, I was tentative about saying you could design dances with 
it. Computers are still an unknown bird in the dance community." They 
won't be for long. 

Sway through the Crowd to an Empty Space. Typically, a chore- 
ographer will map the flow of a dance first, then go back in and create 
movement phrases. Using the DOM system, "They can go back into 
the program after having doodled, and they don't have to exhaust a live 
dancer until they get the move they want," says Dombrower. Choreog- 
raphy by computer can also save a choreographer time and money. In a 
large company involved with current producion, development time and 
rehearsal space are at a premium. 

On his way to a job as ballet master of the Stuttgart Ballet company, 
Allen Ebnother saw a demonstration of Dombrower's software on a 
television news show. Tremendously excited about the program's poten- 
tial, he trailed it to Stanford and Larkam set him up with a session at the 
Apple. He liked what he saw and is recommending that the German com- 
pany purchase an Apple. 

"Choreography is a precise, mathematical art form," says Ebnother, 
a choreographer himself. Ballets are schematically diagrammed. "Even

Stravinsky is broken down into eighths." What looks like a rhythmic 
flow of bodies and phrases to an audience is actually an elaborate set of 
hundreds of counts and beats, memorized by the dancers. Also, "most 
choreographers work alone and like to challenge themselves," he adds. 
Used to getting the most from the limits of a given piece of music, they 
would, he says, relish working within the limits of a new form, the 
computer. 

All the pressure and attention he's getting these days sometimes gets 
Dombrower down. Time is tight. Money is tight. Holding down a nine- 
to-five job programming games for a major home video company and 
programming nights and weekends on his Apple is not his idea of a good 
time. "I like being with people rather than spending all my time with 
machines," he says. Although he's the type who likes to tinker with 
things and be "the handyman around the house," calling him a hacker 
makes him bristle. 

What he's best at is improvising which, lately, has become his second 
job. "It's extraordinarily difficult" to be an entrepreneur on a shoe- 
string, he says. "You won't find the software superstars of the world 
working on dance notation programming," like he and his partner Lopez 
are. There's not a mass market for the software he's created, and he has to 
go scratching for capital. Nonetheless, the dance community, as well as 
the press, has gone crazy for Dombrower's software. "It's a big respon- 
sibility," he says, holding up his end of the project, with the dance world 
"knocking at my door and asking me when it's going to be done." 

To the Song They're Playing on the Radio. Eddie Dombrower was 
a dancer before he became a programmer, and the artist in him still re- 
mains. A suggestion that he combine his math and dance disciplines led 
him to creating the notation system software. 

Funded by a postgraduate grant, Dombrower met his first Apple in 
England in 1980. Research for the grant showed that the only computer- 
related figure study work was being done "at the academic level and on 
military-priced, time-sharing computers, like modeling motion for the 
auto industry." 

After learning the finer points of programming in apprenticeship, he 
started by modeling a rotating hand in Pascal. "I started with a finger, 
using very simple programs, and progressed to a full hand. There are as 
many joints in your hand as there are in the rest of your body," says 
Dombrower. "It was a real good exercise, using a lot of the same algo- 
rithms that are now in the finished product." 

The format for the system came out of the necessity for debugging the 
figure graphics, he says, "not by design." 

Returning to America, he converted his routines to machine level for 
speed and space reasons. He recommends working in assembly. 
"Anyone who is mechanically inclined, with a decent teacher or way to 
learn, is going to get a good enough feel for it to do assembly language 
programming," he explains, liking the ability to work within the actual 
architecture of the machine. Nevertheless, he admits it takes a "rare 
breed" to want to do it. 

"Probably," he adds, "anyone who has good language skills can 
learn to program in a language," whether it be Pascal, Basic, or 
assembly. 

"They don't call them languages for nothing. There's not only 
vocabulary or syntax, but there is something I would say is close to in- 
nuendo in the way you can structure your statements. It's not the same as 
in a human language, but you can develop the skill for putting things in a 
certain order so they mean slightly different things." 

A point that irks Dombrower is the way the news media always say 
good math students make the best programmers. He was "a good math 
student, but never a great one." But it doesn't take being a stellar math 
student to program. "Anyone who is proficient in one discipline will 
have no trouble drawing parallels between their discipline and working 
with the computer," he says. 

Not all programmers are "bits-and-bytes-type eggheads," an idea 
he's found even young children believe. "There's an artistic side to it 
that gets overlooked." 

The burden of creativity on demand and the limits of his resources 
shut Dombrower down for a while, as they would any artist. "Things 
tend to go slowly sometimes, and that's frustrating," he says. "A good 
idea takes time, and what I'm working on is too valuable to be a quickie 
piece of work. " So he waits until the blue funk passes and then dives 
back in, pushing himself further than before. 

One of the things that brings him out of a slump is the fact that his 



program "is just a lot of fun" to a lot of people. "That always makes me 
happy, having been a performer for several years. It's nice when people 
are amused by something you can do. It's good for those depressing 
moments." 

What's fun about Dombrower's software is its friendliness. Although 
it's a complex piece of programming, to the untrained user it's a delight 
to work with. "It's been used by a lot of people who don't have any ex- 
pertise in the field," he says. "That's one of the sure signs a system is 
going to work." 

With the new version of DOM installed at Stanford, Dombrower's 
next challenge will be to go back into the coding for the animated figure 
and clean it up. "When it moves too fast, some of the lines become bro- 
ken and people have to use their imagination to fill in the figure's move- 
ment," he says. It's full of detailed trigonometric calculations. "I'm 
sure there are a few missed numbers causing it to do some of the things 
it does." 

Let's Dance, Let's Dance, Let's Dance. Dombrower started danc- 
ing late and was able to bring an adult perspective to his early dancing 
years. "It was phenomenal to watch what was happening with all those 




twelve-year-old girls I was in class with," he says. At their age, he had 
been studying to be a professional musician. "Their experience was to- 
tally different from mine. It's amazing. 

"Young dancers have very little sense of repertory," he explains. 
"The one they have is produced by the studio director, a teacher, or an 
older student." It's like a junior high school orchestra conductor having 
to write all the music for the band, with no standards to lean on. "They 
don't get a well-rounded perspective of what they're heading into." 

Also, a lot of good choreography doesn't get a chance to travel very 
far. It's performed regionally and very rarely passed on. Film technol- 
ogy has helped remedy this, although nowadays the first and foremost 
medium for recording dance is videotape. 

"Videotape is doing a lot for the preservation and notation of 
dance," says Dombrower. Videodisc technology, with freeze-frame and 
playback capability, is an even more advanced step. "But it doesn't solve 
the problem totally. Take, for example, shooting large groups of dancers 
on a stage. You have to be far enough back to get them all, yet close 
enough to pick up details." This could involve multiple camera setups or 
extensive editing. 

The ultimate problem, however, is that "you're never really sure 
you're seeing an interpretation or what the choreographer originally set 
down. It's like learning music from a record." 

"Any good notation system will remedy that," Dombrower adds, al- 
though "paper can't convey enough dimension for the average person to 
easily understand a dance" — like a graphic system can, with its ability to 
evoke the actual feeling of performance.

Flight Simulator II. By Bruce Artwick. No, this is not a sequel. It's not 
The Bells of Saint Mary's, The Empire Strikes Back, Beneath the Planet 
of the Apes, or Porky 's II. This program is not just another James Bond 
movie. 

Flight Simulator II is to the original Flight Simulator what Apoca- 
lypse Now is to Sands of Iwo Jima. One's a powerful cinematic ex- 
perience; the other's just a good war movie. 

Bruce Artwick's first Flight Simulator for the Apple appeared in the 
fall of 1979. In those days, the average Apple had a whopping 16K of 
RAM. Artwick thought it was neat having 3K more to improve on the 
13K TRS-80 version of Flight Simulator. He even envisioned the day 
when he would have a lot more RAM to play around with. 

On the average, software has improved considerably since the late 



seventies. Games are better. Word processors are better. Utilities are 
better. But Flight Simulator II is such a quantum leap forward in just 
about every way that it feels like you're using a different machine. 

This program has so much depth that a single review can't do it jus- 
tice. We're talking about the War and Peace of microcomputer pro- 
grams. 

Flight Simulator II puts you in a flying environment that is more than 
ten thousand by ten thousand miles square and encompasses the con- 
tinental United States as well as parts of Canada, Mexico, and the Carib- 
bean. 

Flight Simulator II teaches you how to fly the Piper PA-28-181 Ar- 
cher II— a single-engine, 148-mph, nonretractable gear airplane. You 
won't have earned a pilot's license by the time you've mastered the pro- 
gram, but you will know your way around a small airplane. 

Since the program is about as hard to master as flying a real aircraft, 
there are two modes, easy and realistic. Though it would take hours, you 
could actually fly across the country in the easy mode. In the realistic 
mode, the plane would run out of gas. The realistic mode also takes into 
account varying weather, winds, and equipment reliability. Users can set 
their own conditions for each flight. 

The instrument panel of the Flight Simulator II is modeled after the

real thing, and Art wick has improved the graphic representation of the 
instruments considerably over the original Flight Simulator. He has also 
included commonly used navigational aids— an omni-bearing indicator 
and for users with 64K, an automatic direction finder. 

The graphics for the three-dimensional out-the-window display are 
also much improved. They feature full-color shading and solid objects on 
the landscape. The animation is quite realistic, making use of incremen- 
tal fill techniques. 

Flight Simulator II includes a World War I dogfight game, user 
modes that let you save specific conditions for a later flight, and an editor 
for changing the variables that control the aircraft's performance. The 
complete package includes an eighty-eight-page flight manual, four 
flight charts, a second manual called Flight Physics and Aircraft Control 
with an Introduction to Aerobatics, and one (count 'em, one) disk. 

Of course, even War and Peace has its weak moments. In Flight 
Simulator IPs case, the WWI dogfight is not up to the standards of the 
rest of the program. Also, in easy mode it's possible to taxi on the 
ground all over the flying environment— even across Lake Michigan. 
Perhaps there are other minor inconsistencies, but they are few and far 
between. 

Judging from the fact that the original, far more primitive Flight 
Simulator has been a consistent Bestseller for three and a half years, it's 
safe to say that Flight Simulator II will entrance and captivate a whole 
new generation of would-be pilots. 

If they gave a Pulitzer Prize for software engineering, Artwick would 
win hands down. DH

The Writer. By Thomas Crosley and Burt Sloane/Softwest. The Writer 
is a simplified version of PIE Writer, low in cost and fairly powerful. In 
editing and formatting power, it outperforms most of the low-end word 
processors including Bank Street Writer and Home Word. The Writer's 
capabilities include telecommunications, mail merge, and 64- or 
128-column display with a screen that alternates between sides to show 
both halves of what you've written (64 columns for 40-column displays, 
128 columns for 80-column displays). Naturally, it also features word 
wrap, fast and easy cursor movement, global search and replace, and 
block manipulating capabilities. 

However, The Writer doesn't quite compete with some of the slightly 
more expensive word processors, such as Apple Writer He. Block han- 
dling and search and replace are somewhat more limited than people who 
use a word processor for long documents would like. The basic functions 
are there, but it is not possible, for example, to make searches backward, 
or save a paragraph from text as a macro to insert where needed by 
pressing a few keys. Also, due to the size of the program, files are 
limited to about 15K in a 64K machine. 

Business users and writers producing short manuscripts will find that 
The Writer meets most of their needs, however. 

The Writer is self-configuring for the Apple II series. Configuration 
is carried out when the program is first loaded and requires the user to 
answer a few questions about the machine being used. This process 
erases several files from the disk, so the manufacturer recommends that 
the user make a backup copy of the program disk before configuring it. 

The Writer includes a help screen and an interactive tutorial. These 
are nice supplements in many other word processors, but in The Writer 
they are vital, because of the confusing reference manual. Wading 
through the manual is a chore because it attempts to cover all configura- 
tions of the program. It's not impossible to use the manual, just time con- 
suming. 

The Writer supports most eighty-column cards, is menu-driven, and is 
a fair value for the price. HAD

Carrier Force. By Gary Grigsby. It is 1942 in the Pacific. Most of the 
American battleships are at the bottom of Pearl Harbor, the Japanese 
have swept over the central Pacific, and the only remaining force to op- 
pose them is the U.S. aircraft carrier fleet. 

In Carrier Force you command the most powerful, yet most 
vulnerable, thing in the ocean— a big flattop packed with fighters, dive- 
bombers, and torpedo planes. The game covers both the details of carrier 
aircraft operations and the strategic scope of the four major carrier bat- 
tles of 1942: Coral Sea, Midway, Eastern Solomons, and Santa Cruz. It 



was these momentous battles, fought in the year after Pearl Harbor, that 
brought Japanese expansion to a halt. 

Carrier Force is not a game of any one of these battles, but rather a 
gaming system applied to four different scenarios. The system takes each 
player through a highly structured sequence of operations. Each turn 
begins with a briefing and damage report, and then allows you to change 
the composition of each task force, launch aircraft, prepare aircraft for 
missions, land aircraft at a base, and move air missions around the map. 

Air missions, usually consisting of single seaplanes, spend most of 
their time looking for the enemy. They move over a small on-screen area 
that shows ships, planes, and islands arranged on an invisible hexagonal 
grid. As each air mission moves along the scrolling display, the planes 
search for enemy ships or bases. Bomber missions have the option to at- 
tack any enemy they find. 

The most frustrating and intriguing part of Carrier Force is locating 
the enemy. Since you have only limited knowledge of your opponent's 
whereabouts, each battle begins as a deadly game of hide-and-seek. Bad 
weather often hampers searching, and the search reports are usually in- 
accurate to some degree. Both sides have to stumble through this confu- 
sion before they can attack. 

Attacks take place at the end of a turn amid sound effects and a run- 
ning account of damage inflicted. Only craft in the same hexagon may at- 
tack each other. 

The computer does the record keeping in Carrier Force, but this 
doesn't mean you can take it easy. Plan several turns in advance. Other- 
wise, you'll find that planes assigned to bomb an airfield are carrying 
torpedoes, carriers are unable to land aircraft because they launched too 
many during a turn, or bombers run out of fuel and have to ditch in the 
ocean. Even with careful planning, it is hard to win without the kind of 
luck real-life American admirals had at Midway when they destroyed the 
bulk of the Japanese carrier fleet with an inferior force. 

Midway is the quickest and most exciting of the four scenarios. The 
island is approached by a huge Japanese invasion force that includes four 
heavy and two light carriers. The Americans have only three carriers and 
some pathetic aircraft. To make matters worse for the Americans, the 
Japanese aircraft are more accurate and have a longer range. And 
American torpedo planes are next to useless. 

The Japanese have a similar advantage in all the battles except Coral 
Sea, but this is offset somewhat because the Japanese are given more to 
do. The disadvantaged side is also given handicap points to help even 
the score. 

Because of its scope and complexity, Carrier Force can take several 
hours to play. The two-player version is great if you have someone you 
want to spend a lot of time with and have something to do while your op- 
ponent enters moves. Otherwise, if you play alone, the computer 
automatically assumes the Japanese role. A solitaire game can be started, 
saved, and restarted as a two-player game. This gives the curious the 
chance to check Japanese strength and positions (cheat) before restarting 
the solitaire game. 

In either form, Carrier Force is an excellent strategy game that is 
very like its subject. Like a carrier battle, it is long, slow in developing, 
and occasionally tedious, but with periods of intense action. For those 
who like to plan for a decisive moment, it provides the same duties, 
fears, and frustrations of a real carrier admiral. KR

Flying Colors. By John Norby and Glenn Albinger. Wow. Neat. 
Thrills, fills, and excitement. Fun for the entire family. Look up on the 
screen! It's a bird or a plane or Marilyn Monroe! It's Flying Colorsl 

We had a small problem with this graphics package. Every time 
employees walked by and saw it on the monitor, they would ask to try it, 
and then could be separated from the controller only by threats of an ex- 
treme nature. It's to be expected, though. This is a mind-bogglingly 
easy-to-learn, easy-to-use hi-res toy. 

Perhaps that's the wrong word. You could do business graphics with 
this system, but this is such an insanely happy program that it's hard to 
keep from smiling while you're merrily drawing away. And it's so sim- 
ple that you could give one to your favorite two-year-old. 

Just picture it: eleven brush-tips, sixteen diagonal and crosshatched 
color patterns, four solid colors, two blacks, two whites (a concession to 
Apple graphics hardware), circle and box functions, a smart fill mode 
that remembers the last color or pattern used, a point-to-point line func-

and delicate corrections, all controlled by a joystick, track ball, or other 
game controller. 

You only have to touch the keyboard once after booting the disk and 
then you're off and running. Of course, if you really want to keep typing 
you can summon up the alpha mode to write on-screen and label anything 
you want, and when you want to save something it really helps if you 
give it a name, but otherwise you are totally free of the tyranny of the 
keyboard. 

Don't forget to show off your masterpieces. Flying Colors features a 
really nice option called The Slide Projector that will display your crea- 
tions in any sequence you choose at any time interval you choose bet- 
ween one and ninety-nine seconds. You can also set the intervals 
manually using the game controller. To arrange the slides in order and 
specify the time intervals, you do have to go to the keyboard, but the 
command structure is very simple, requiring mostly the arrow keys and 
the return key. The commands can be easily figured out in five or so 
minutes without the authors' very lucid documentation.

Word Processing. There are word processors, complete with hardware 
and specialized software, that are designed to automate an office by proc- 
essing letters, manuscripts, and everything in between. These sophisti- 
cated systems cost a minimum of $4,500, and all they do is word proc- 
essing, but they do it exquisitely. Then there are microcomputer word 
processing packages, designed to take the office computer and convert it 
into a vehicle for producing letters, drafts, and documents. In the past, 
there has been no comparison between the two systems. 

It is obvious that State of the Art has attempted to bridge this gap 
with its new package that is entitled simply Word Processing. When 
traveling through the various menus and prompts, one cannot help but 
compare this program to the IBM Displaywriter, the Lanier, or the Wang 
word processors. It appears that a great deal of research was done into 
this type of equipment and accompanying software, because the best fea- 
tures of all three have been integrated into Word Processing. Most 
microcomputer word processing software does not even come close. 

This program is not for beginners. It is sophisticated, comprehen- 
sive, and complex. Although the manual states that you don't need 
hands-on experience before using this program, a beginner would be lost 
before learning to create a document. 

One reason for this is the installation procedure and the number of 
disks required. It would be easy to become intimidated by the various 
program disks and their certainly not-user-friendly names: WPA1, 
WPA2, WPB, WPC, and so on. And the mere fact that you are required 
to do a lot of disk-swapping to copy the program onto three blank disks 
before you can even use it is enough to make the average businessperson 
micro-shy. The copying process took an experienced user forty minutes. 
It's a good thing the installation procedure has to be performed only 
once, because once is more than enough. The manual is excellent, but it 
is not enough to rescue the user from a bad situation. 

Once the system is ready to create a document, the going gets easier. 
Word Processing is completely menu-driven, and a help option is 
available. However, the software does tend to ask too many questions 
and to require too much answer verification from the user. 

Word Processing has some especially useful features, though. The 
ability to enter passwords, for instance, gives the feeling of security. 
And the statistics provided on each document can come in handy, such as 
the date of creation and date of last revision. The program allows the 
linking of files, a feature too seldom found in other word processors. 

Of course, this program provides all the capabilities that have come 
to be expected from word processing packages, such as the ability to 
move text, delete, add, or modify words, sentences, or whole para- 
graphs. A wide variety of print options are available through the use of 
simple, easy-to-remember commands such as pressing the underline key 
before and after a word or group of words to indicate underlining. 

One of Word Processing's most valuable features is its ability to in- 
teract with the State of the Art accounting packages. This helps the users 
of those packages to integrate data from the accounting modules into 



reports created on the word processor. 

Word Processing is best used with large documents, complex files, 
or interactive data. It's overqualified— and too complicated— for short 
letters, infrequent essays, or small files. Word Processing belongs in 
progressive office environments where its users are familiar with sophis- 
ticated word processing concepts. 

While using this package, pray that no problems develop. The man- 
ual specifically states that if a problem occurs that isn't addressed in the 
manual, the user should seek assistance from the dealer. State of the Art 
says they completely support their dealers, and that seems fine, but what 
if you've moved and your dealer has never heard of the program? 

Word Processing doesn't quite succeed in bridging the gap between 
microcomputer word processing software and dedicated word proces- 
sors, but it's a good try. If the number of disks were reduced, the super- 
fluous questions eliminated, and the technical support made more ac- 
cessible, this program would be well on its way. TH

Defender and Stargate. In the game room the other day, a new member 
of the review staff watched as someone played Defender. 

"Oh no," the new kid moaned. "A rip-off of Repton]" 

Everyone in the room turned and stared at the young fellow with 
glares of disbelief, not sure whether the remark was made facetiously or 
in earnest. It was made in earnest. 

That the newcomer didn't recognize the granddaddy of the fly-over- 
the-terrain genre whence Repton came says much of his limited arcade 
experience. It also says a lot about Atari's timing in releasing Defender, 
Stargate, and a slew of other oldy moldies. Better late than never? 

The original coin-op versions of Defender and Stargate have been 
around for several years but have now been generally abandoned by ar- 
cade fans for newer games on the block. When gamers tired of Galaxian 
and Missile Command, Defender set down a blueprint for an entirely new 
kind of game. Instead of sitting at the bottom and shooting toward the 
heavens, Defender put the player in the seat of a spacecraft that could fly 
forward, backward, up, and down. 

Saving humanity is the theme of the game. Aliens hover over the 
ground, picking up hapless humans who don't know enough to hide 
behind a bush or under a rock. The player's job is to "zap the enemy and 
rescue humans." Forget it. The real object of the game is to shoot the 
weird-looking objects and try not to get hit. 

There's not too much separating Defender and Stargate in terms of 
game design; the big difference is in execution of each. Flying the ship in 
Defender feels like driving a car that's limited to first gear. The cartridge 
version for the Atari computer offers firmer control of the ship; why 
couldn't the same care have been taken in programming the Apple ver- 
sion? (There's a better public-domain version of the game available, so 
much like the original that the programmer wouldn't release it for fear of 
a lawsuit.) 

Compared to Defender, Stargate is a crisper, smoother, faster ver- 
sion of the same game idea. Playing Stargate after several rounds of its 
predecessor is like racing around in a Corvette after putt-putting around 
in a midsixties vintage Pontiac —an arcade rush. 

Stargate's radar scanner isn't as effective as Defender's; in Stargate, 
it's difficult to see which blip represents the player's ship among a sea of 
alien blips (aliens are one pixel; the player's ship is two). Never mind the 
scanner, though. The time spent trying to figure out who's who is better 
spent trying to blast the pesky critters out of the galaxy. 

Sirius's Gorgon was the first Apple version of the Defender family. 
Then came Eliminator, Rear Guard, and Repton. Memories of days long 
gone. 

The Defender era has passed, and anyone other than Atari would be 
foolish to think they could publish another look-alike and get away with 
it. Atari will probably get away with it for the same reason Sierra On- 
Line got away with Frogger and Datasoft got away with Zaxxon— this is 
the official Defender. 

Even though Stargate possesses many of Defender's (and Gorgon's, 
and Rear Guard's, and Repton' s . . . ) characteristics, it's executed so 
well that it deserves to stand on its own merits. 

Stargate is the souped-up version but Defender is the classic original.

Sticky bear Opposites. By Richard Hefter and Janie and Steve Worth- 
ington. 

... no one knows what is good 

Who knows not what is evil; 

And no one knows what is true 

Who knows not what is false. 
— "Seth Compton," from Spoon River 
Anthology, by Edgar Lee Masters. 

This program's authors steer clear of the philosophical realm dis- 
cussed by the poet, but they have presented a fine educational tool to 
teach the concept of everyday opposites. In/out, many/few, day/night, 
empty/full, and others appear here in the crisp, attractive style that has 
come to be associated with this software house. 

The pictures are finely drawn and gaily animated using the trademark 
Stickybear character and other objects a child would find pleasing, such 
as seesaws, climbing vines, and little airplanes. 

When you boot the program, a picture and word appear that represent 
one half of a pair of opposites. Pressing a key brings you the other 
half— for instance, a speeding auto instead of one just idling along. Dif- 
ferent musical notes accompany each half of the opposite. As a nice 
change of pace, a couple of pairs are silent. 

Some pairs the authors have deemed particularly important are 
presented in more than one way. The authors say they did this to prevent 
kids from associating an idea with only a single set of pictures. This is 
wonderful, but the program would have benefited if the concept had been 
applied to all of the pairs instead of just a few. In any case, the examples 
the authors did choose are both appealing to watch and clearly illustrative 
of the opposites they teach. 

Unfortunately, the sound can't be eliminated, although it is generally 
an asset. And you can't select a particular pair of opposites that you want 
your child to practice. You just have to wait until the desired pair comes 
around again. 

This program fits preschoolers well but would probably be inap- 
propriate for those outside the recommended age group of three to six. 
On the other hand, even adults have been known to sit transfixed before 



the screen when Stickybear and company go into action. 

Stickybear Opposites includes a hard cover book, a large poster rein- 
forcing the concepts, and a sheet of stickers featuring the dapper bear. 
Opposites won't teach kids to make moral judgments, but it will help 
them learn which way is up and other physical distinctions. IP

WordWorx. By Susan Christie and Paul G. Weisberg. Fauktourea. Is it 
(a) the sound made by a sumo wrestler choking on some bad sushi, (b) 
the mating cry of libidinous Hindus, or (c) a common English word? The 
answer: (c) a common English word. Well, sort of. Actually, it's one of 
150 "mystery words" contained in Myspellery, by far the better half of 
this two-game word puzzler from Reston Publishing. 

Intentionally or not, Myspellery underscores the idiocy that is the 
King's English by flashing a series of letters on the screen and giving the 
player phonetic clues to help solve the puzzle. The object is to identify a 
common English word by pronouncing the various vowels, consonants, 
vowel/consonant blends, and diphthongs contained in each puzzle. The 
same vowels, consonants, and so forth can and often do take varying pro- 
nunciations each time around, and there, mad gamester, is the rub. You 
come out of the game pitying the poor soul faced with the pesky task of 
learning English as a second language. Hell, you've yet to master it as 
your first. 

Correctly guessing a word results in a maximum of 100 points; each 
clue requested reduces the total by 10. A maximum of nine clues is given 
for each puzzle, each set of clues containing the number of syllables in 
the word as well as the phonic breaks. For example, the clues for the 
mystery word Fauktourea are broken down thus : " 3 syllables ";"FAUK 
T OUR EA"; "F as in enforce"; "AU as in laugh"; "K as in blank"; 
"T as in teamwork"; "OUR as in yourself; and "EA as in beneath." 
The word, if you haven't guessed by now, is factory. 

The game is alternately ego-massaging and challenging, and that, 
oddly enough, is one of its minor flaws. The degree of difficulty built in- 
to the game is inconsistent with the designers' intentions. Myspellery has 
two levels of play, the second supposedly more difficult than the first; 
yet each contains virtually an equal number of easy and challenging 
puzzles. Another drawback is the user input system enabling players to 
add puzzles of their own in a third file. It's poindess. Players inputting 
their own puzzles will doubtless remember their entries in subsequent 
games and steamroll their opponents into submission. If you went to the 
"I'm OK/You're OK for a moron" school of gamesmanship, this might 
have some appeal. 

On the flip side of WordWorx is Sentence Maker, a game centering 
on groups of five initials, each letter standing for a word in a commonly 
used expression, motto, or famous quotation. One hundred fifty entries 
make up the database, the sentences drawn from literature, history, 
popular songs, TV commercials, and so on. To solve a phrase, players 
take turns composing five- word sentences, beginning each word with the 
corresponding letter in the string. When one of the words contained in 
the mystery phrase is used in one of the players' sentences, that word 
replaces the corresponding initial in the string. No word can be du- 
plicated in any of the sentences, and once a mystery word is uncovered it 
of course must be used in all subsequent entries. In addition, the oppos- 
ing player must approve each entry; this can result in endless debate and 
is part of the fun (is "souped-up" a single word including a hyphen, or 
two words joined by the hyphen— grammar freaks know, but how many 
players do?). A difficult string can take hours to solve, but the object of 
the game is not so much to solve the phrase as it is to compose as many 
creative sentences as possible. If both players become bored with an un- 
solved string, they can move on to the next. 

As with Myspellery, there are two levels of play, the second level in- 
cluding the historical or literary source of each entry. There's also a file 
for user input (again, poindess). 

Overall, though, both games are great fun, with enough entries of 
varying difficulty to challenge eighth-graders, graduate students, large- 
breasted starlets, everyone. Who said life wasn't ghofl ((

interpreted languages such as Basic; knowledge of assembly 
language is no longer imperative. Its study is left primarily to profes- 
sional programmers or those with an adventurous spirit. These 
adventurers have a kinship with the computer pioneers and a desire 
to see how things operate at a ground level. They're willing to spend 
more time developing a program to increase its speed and efficiency. 
If you're interested in learning assembly language programming on 
the Apple, and you have a working knowledge of Basic, Haskell's 
Tutor is a superb teacher. 

Learning assembly language with this package is a doing-and- 
seeing procedure. The disk contains a machine language Monitor 
program called Tutor. With Tutor in action, you have a simultaneous 
display of the register contents of the 6502, eighty-eight selected 
bytes of memory, and a command line. A disassembly of the next 
command to be executed is also shown. 

The accompanying book is an integral part of the tutorial. It 
opens by covering the reasons for using assembly language — it's 
fast, you'll get to form a more intimate relationship with your 
microprocessor, and you'll have a better understanding of how the 
computer works. Haskell forgot to add that it's fun! Chapter 1 also 
introduces you to the Tutor Monitor program, which turns out to be 
the glue that holds everything together and the fuel that makes it run. 

Chapter 2 focuses on the 6502 microprocessor: what it is, what it 
does, and what it means to program it. Then you slide into using 
binary and hexadecimal arithmetic and hex-to-decimal/decimal-to- 
hex conversions. 

The next several chapters deal with very low-level programming 
details: the 6502 memory and registers, and how to gain access to 
them and use them. You're also drilled on applications of the 6502 
instructions used to program in machine language. You'll probably 
never memorize them all, and there's no need to do so; they're all 
laid out in an appendix. 

Some time is spent on 6502 arithmetic. Here you'll discover the 
use of positive and negative numbers and how the 6502 deals with 
them. While you may not need to deal with negative numbers during 
your initial assembly language programming attempts, sooner or 
later you will. Indeed, some assembly language instructors don't 
even mention the use of negative numbers to their beginning 
students; often that subject is dealt with only in advanced classes. 

The Tutor program is a sophisticated Monitor with a number of 
commands. The arrow keys can be used to move a pointer through 
displayed memory. You can set breakpoints, manipulate registers or 
blocks of memory, execute programs, disassemble portions of 
memory, calculate branching offsets, print disassembly listings, save 
or load binary files, or quit to the Apple Monitor or to DOS. The 
Tutor provides several automatic tools to help you write machine 
language by hand — that is, without an assembler. This may seem 
like a contradiction, but it's an effective way to learn. 

Succeeding chapters teach you more about the Apple itself and 
how to work with it at the machine-language level. This information 
covers the method used to display characters on-screen, how to use 
both lo-res and hi-res graphics, and details of the game I/O port and 
the peripheral I/O slots. 

You're even exposed to developing your own hardware. Infor- 
mation on the use of the 682 1 PIA (peripheral interface adapter) and 
6850 ACIA (asynchronous communications interface adapter) entice 
you to warm up your soldering iron to build a printer interface and a 
real-time clock. 

The appendixes contain tables listing the 6502 operating codes, a 
summary of the Tutor Monitor program commands, information on 
how to use machine-language routines from Basic programs, and 
some data sheets for the integrated circuits used in the hardware sec- 
tion of the text. 

This program merits an A for performance. Haskell has done a 
good job of presenting a wealth of information to would-be assembly 
language programmers. This is a welcome contrast to the authors of 
some 6502 assembly language books who find certain material dif- 
ficult to handle and therefore ignore it. Haskell's book and disk are 
different — they're worth the price. This book-disk combination is 
good not only for individual study but also as a teaching tool for user 
groups, classrooms, or wherever adventurous spirits congregate. PP

The Learning Line. By the Boxes. While little software can hold the at- 
tention of a toddler, The Learning Line seems to be an exception. This 
may well be the first program a child can learn to use and understand. 

Aimed at children aged four to seven, The Learning Line helps kids 
understand the fundamental relationships between letters, words, num- 
bers, and pictures. Only a joystick and the escape key are required to 
guide an animated monkey under a clothesline, where the main menu 
options— clothes, words, faces, letters, numbers, and objects— are dis- 
played as pictures hanging on the line. You select an option by using the 
joystick to move the monkey under the desired item. 

The games are all played in the same way. After you select the 
clothes option, for example, you are shown wearing apparel hanging on 
another clothesline. One left sock appears centered above the others and 
you must find another left sock hanging on the clothesline. To indicate 
that you have found the mate, you must move the monkey under the 
matching item and press the fire button. If the choice is correct, the item 
gets tossed into a laundry basket and stomped by the monkey while music 
plays. "S" toggles the sound. 

If the answer is incorrect, however, there is no negative reinforce- 
ment. No buzzers buzz and the monkey doesn't frown or shake his arms 
at you, he simply tries again. This is one of The Learning Line's nicest 
features. 

In the Words section, the object is to match a picture with its name 
spelled out under it with the same word hanging on the line. Later, the 
player matches the name with the picture, thus gradually learning to 
recognize that the word represents the picture. If the player's choice is 
correct, the monkey sweeps the word into a bucket. In Objects, the play- 
er must match complementary items such as a hammer and saw; and 
Faces, Letters, and Numbers are straightforward matching games, each 
featuring the same delightful animated monkey. Pressing the escape but- 
ton will return the player to the main menu at any time. 

The Learning Line is definitely for the very young, but if you're look- 
ing for lessons that will capture and hold a child's attention, this program 
isn't a bad purchase. HAS

Taxes-Taxes. This is an inexpensive and easy-to-use aid in calculating 
personal income taxes for the middle-income taxpayer who itemizes de- 
ductions. The stress is on deductions because this program is designed to 
assist with the federal form 1040, not the 1040A or 1040EZ. The stress 
is also middle income; high-bracket taxpayers with tax shelters and mini- 
mum tax concerns will probably need to consult a CPA anyway. 

For the middle income earner who itemizes deductions, this program 
can be a real timesaver and will help ensure the accuracy of your return. 
Users will have to know the basics of deductions and credits to use this 
program effectively, however. 

Taxes-Taxes calculates the line-by-line amounts for the following IRS 
schedules, Form 1040 (long form), Schedule A (Itemized Deductions), 
Schedule D (Capital Gains and Losses), Schedule G (Income Averag- 
ing), Schedule SE (Self-Employment Tax), and Schedule W (Working 
Couple Deduction). 

Inputting information into Taxes-Taxes is simple and straightforward. 
The eight screens used for inputting are arranged in order so that you 
progress through income to deductions and on to more serious business, 
such as income averaging. There are two weaknesses regarding input. 
First, it would sometimes be helpful to have more input lines. For exam- 
ple, in the deductions section, there is a line for home mortgage paid to 
financial institutions or individuals, a line for credit card interest, and a 
line for other interest. Here, all loan interest, car loans, and educational 
loans have to be added separately and then entered in total. It would be 
very helpful to be able to enter these loan amounts separately. This 
would be good documentation later, and would provide a better guide for 
preparing tax returns in subsequent years. 

Second, some other items, including the child care credit, have to be 
calculated manually before being entered into the input screen. This is 
unfortunate, since it would have been relatively simple to let the com- 
puter calculate child care credit based on the taxpayers' salaries and the 
number of children in child care facilities. 

One helpful feature is the Input Item Reference Summary, which ap- 
pears at the back of the documentation. Not only does this provide the 
name of the input line, but it also provides you with a short explanation 




The more you want to 
read, or the more you have to 
read, the more you need Super 
Speed Reading. The program's so clear, so 
graphically presented that you'll quickly learn 
to read 2 to 10 times faster! 

The program works so well because it 
was developed by . . .

Flash Section displays hun- 
dreds of phrases at speeds 
from 100 to 10,000 words 
per minute. While the Flash Section has an 
important teaching function, we must admit 
it's also as much fun to use as a game! 
The instruction manual is uncomplicated 
and very reader friendly. It's 
loaded with extra information

of what goes on the line. This is especially helpful in the instances in 
which you do have to do calculations before entering an amount. 

One of the program's most helpful features is that it can calculate 
your tax liability based on income averaging. If you have never wrestled 
with this calculation, you may not appreciate the worth of this feature 
that takes the arduousness and possibility for error out of a complex six- 
step process. 

Taxes-Taxes is also designed to handle capital gains and losses. The 
user only has to enter net short-term capital gains/losses and net long- 
term capital gains/losses and then Taxes-Taxes calculates the rest. 

It should be noted that only the net short-term and long-term gains 
and losses can be entered. When it comes to completing your tax return, 
you will have to list each short- and long-term transaction individually. 
Although this is not a big imposition, it would be nice if you could enter 
and retrieve the detailed information on each short-term and long-term 
capital gains transaction. 

For $35, this program is an easy-to-use tax preparation and planning 
aid that is well worth the money. Including the time required to input the 
information, with Taxes-Taxes a 1040 with income averaging, took eight 
minutes to complete. Manually, this same set of taxes took well over an 
hour. Ill

Computer Training Tapes. By Jo Ann Robinson. If Apple included 
these tapes with each computer sold, they would be guaranteed fewer 
questions, problem calls, and irate users. More importantly, the com- 
puter user would receive answers to questions without the usual runa- 
round or frantic long-distance calls. 

Written for the computer novice, Computer Training Tapes offers in- 
formation, tips, and techniques that can benefit even a seasoned Apple 
user. The package consists of three cassettes and one disk. The method 
of training is simple: You listen to the tapes and practice what you learn 
on the computer. This is accomplished by using the disks that normally 
accompany the He: The DOS 3.3 Sample Programs and System Master. 

Computer Training Tapes's instructor, Doug Eide, follows his own in- 
structions as he speaks, and the listener can actually hear his computer in 
the background. The instructions are so easy that a schoolchild could 
follow them. In the event of a user mistake, Eide explains exactly what to 
do. Not only that, but he delivers his explanation so smoothly that you 
don't get sidetracked while waiting for the next instruction. 

The tapes are labeled Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. It is 
assumed that the listener knows very little about the He. The tapes begin 
at square one, with a definition of hardware. As you progress, topics ex- 
pand to include sample programs, calculations, and even programming. 
Everything is thoroughly explained, from the keyboard and special func- 
tion keys to the disk operating system. Eide spells out the commands as 
though he is talking to himself while typing, which adeptiy disguises the 
fact that it's probably done to assist people who are bad spellers or who 
might misunderstand the command. He manages to explain tasks without 
making the user feel inferior or slow. He never makes listeners feel as 
though he's looking down at them; he simply guides them. 

These tapes have some advantages that classroom courses don't, 
because you can learn at your own pace. One side of a tape generally 
takes about forty to fifty minutes to complete, but you can turn it off 
whenever you want. Quizzes on different lessons are available on-disk. 
The questions are multiple choice, and if you enter a wrong answer you 
are immediately given the correct answer and allowed to proceed. 

Jo Ann Robinson, the author of the tapes, should be commended. The 
lessons flow smoothly and logically and carry the user easily through 
each task. 

There is one disadvantage to the Computer Training Tapes— the lack 
of a table of contents. This is sorely needed, because the listener must 
search randomly through the tapes in order to find the answers to specific 
questions. With a table of contents, the tapes could be used not only for 
the initial training of He users, but also as a continual source of 
reference. However, the tapes do accomplish exactly what they set out to 
do: train the novice to use an Apple lie. The tapes are highly recom- 
mended for anyone who owns an Apple lie, regardless of computer ex- 
pertise. TH

features, but considering that it is aimed at kids five through fifteen, it is 
awkward and cumbersome to use. The command sequences are confus- 
ing; the fill routines, and especially the edit mode, require too many 
tricky joystick and keyboard maneuvers. 

Yet, in all fairness, there are some nifty things about Picture Writer. 
The cursor has an interesting configuration— it works in two parts. When 
you wiggle the joystick, the center portion of the cursor goes ambling off 
wherever you choose, while the rest stays put. This allows you to have 
precise line control because you draw straight lines between the two 
parts of the cursor. This feature also controls the rectangle and oval 
drawing functions, which is kind of exciting because it allows you to 
squeeze circles horizontally and vertically, a feature generally not seen 
in less sophisticated graphics packages. You can create perspective with 
the ovals, and you can clone shapes by pressing the repeat key. This is a 
little hard to control, but Mondrian would have loved it. 

In addition, a function called "pin" allows you to nail the cursor to 
one spot and draw lines radiating from it. Then there's "backup," which 
will erase the last step drawn, and the edit mode, which will allow you to 
erase any step in the picture. Unfortunately, this invaluable function is 
the hardest to use. Along with the program's unusual good points, there 
is an unusual negative one. You can draw lines of only one width. This 
means that in order to produce a wide line, you have to draw the line's 
perimeter and fill it in. This is definitely not an aid to precision graphics. 

Also notable is the option to have a musical accompaniment while 
drawing. Kids may enjoy this, but for others, the best thing about this 
particular aspect is that you can turn it off. If it couldn't be toggled off, 
parents would be begging Scarborough to include earmuffs and cotton 
balls with their software. 

Other than these features, this is a pretty standard graphics program. 
It has twenty-one colors. They actually consist of eight colors, including 
two whites and a black, and thirteen fill-routine shadings created by mix- 
ing two colors in a horizontal pinstripe pattern. 

All in all, Picture Writer is an unusually capable program. Yet, con- 
sidering how extremely difficult it is to use, it would probably have been 
better aimed at adults. KC

Americans have hungered for the chance to make their living rooms pari- 
mutuel betting parlors. Have your friends over for a night of friendly 
wagers; will Frank Furillo and Joyce Davenport adopt? Will there be a 
major earthquake in California in May? Which city will be nearest the 
epicenter? Will it rain before morning? How many inches? 

Pari-mutuel betting is a system whereby a pool is created for an 
event's every possible outcome, as determined by the house. For in- 
stance, "Furillo and Davenport adopt a boy before the next season 
begins" could be one pool; "Furillo and Davenport adopt a girl before 
the next season begins" could be a second pool; "Furillo and Davenport 
adopt twins" could be a third; "Furillo and Davenport choose not to 
adopt before the next season begins" could be a fourth; "Furillo and 
Davenport attempt to adopt but are turned down as unacceptable par- 
ents, "a fifth; "Davenport sues for divorce, Furillo adopts twins" (the 
long shot) — whatever the house can imagine as an outcome and someone 
will bet on. After the event is over, the pools are combined, the house 
takes its cut, and the people who contributed to the winning pool divide 
up the remaining pot— their winners' shares having been determined by 
the amount they each put in the winning pool. 

The Oddsmaker provides for fourteen possible pools, allowing 
anything from "Furillo adopts Faye's new daughter" to "Furillo adopts 
a new attitude toward the Chief (the more sophisticated houses avoid 
such subjective bets). Once the house has determined the betting categor- 
ies and its percentage of the total pot, bets are collected. The Oddsmaker 
shows the fourteen pools by title. The menu allows the house to either 
take bets and show the odds (as calculated by the amount of money per 
pool in relation to total bets), take bets and show the payoff, take bets and 
show the amount in the pool, or take bets and show an announcement. 
The announcement can be any message the house cares to display while 
taking bets, such as, "Lemonade available in lobby." Bets are taken by 
typing in the bettor's name, the number of the pool he or she wants to bet 
on, and the amount of the bet. A prompt will ask for bet verification, 
and, if verified, the bet is taken and the screen updated. 

One of the nicer features of The Oddsmaker is that it will print tickets. 



After selecting the print option from the menu, the house takes bets as 
usual; after each bet is taken, the printer will print two tickets — one for 
the bettor and one for the house— showing the name of the bettor, the 
pool number, and the amount that was bet. The program will also print a 
two-line message on the tickets so that you can keep your payoffs 
straight. 

The Oddsmaker will also save the information for more than one bet- 
ting event. So if you have a doubleheader to cover, The Oddsmaker can 
accommodate you. 

The program's only glaring fault is that it does not calculate the 
amount to be paid to each winner. Taking a major California earthquake, 
for example— imagine that pool number two ("Bakersfield is nearest the 
epicenter") in a fourteen-pool event was the winner, the total pot was 
$1,000, and the house cut was 15 percent. The house would draw its 
$150 first and the remaining $850 would be divided among all those who 
bet on Bakersfield, pool number two, to win (lose?). If pool number two 
contained $200 and you had bet $20, or 10 percent, you would receive 10 
percent of the pot, or $85. 

This is simple enough to do on paper (even without round numbers), 
which is good, because you will be doing some figuring. The Oddsmaker 
displays the total pot, the amount in each pool, the house cut, and the 
amount in the total pot after the house cut, but it does not calculate the 
amount to be paid to each winner. You, as the house, have to figure that 
out yourself. And while that is easy to do, it is far easier to do with a 
computer. Because each bettor's name, the pool he or she is betting on, 
and the amount bet are all entered into the computer, there is no good 
reason for The Oddsmaker not to compute each winner's take. It's 
ludicrous. Computers, after all, are for computing; it's what they do 
best. 

So, if someone in your office is having a baby and everyone wants to 
predict the baby's weight, or the boys in your lodge want to bet some 
money on the Summer Games, The Oddsmaker can cover your bets 
—almost. TZ

The Sweet Shoppe. By the Boxes, Daus, and Murrays. Right about the 
time that computers became affordable for personal use, people made 
a discovery. Kids like computers! Most adults are afraid to make a 
mistake, but kids have the foresight to remain unintimidated by these 
machines. 

Something else happened at about the same time: video games. And 
ever since, parents have wanted to channel this interest into something 
educational. 

The Sweet Shoppe is a collection of three games for children aged 
four to seven. Simple in approach, it's main thrust is attractive graphics 
and a purely positive approach to learning. It requires few instructions. 
A four-year-old could probably learn to run the whole show after a few 
hands-on lessons from Mom or Dad. 

The Sweet Shoppe is completely joystick-controlled. There are no 
buttons to push and no keys to learn, except the escape key to quit. 

A character called Mr. Jellybean appears inside the sweet shop upon 
boot-up, waiting to be guided to one of the three counters that represent 
different games. All three are simple math exercises: counting, subtrac- 
tion, and addition of numbers one through ten. 

Each game consists of graphically displayed math problems. In the 
first game, a jellybean jar tips over and one to ten jellybeans roll out to be 
counted. One of the numbered balloons at the top of the screen contains 
the answer. The player indicates a choice by steering Mr. Jellybean to 
one of them. If the choice is incorrect, Mr. Jellybean drops back to the 
bottom but never stops smiling. If your choice is correct, the graphics 
and sound explode in celebration. Then it's on to the next problem. 
Pressing escape returns you to the menu. The ice cream and popcorn 
games are similar, with numeric addition or subtraction problems written 
on ice cream stands or tubs of popcorn. 

The Sweet Shoppe is mainly a repetitive math drill with a simple plot, 
yet it is fun too. The program appears to be well thought out, and the big, 
colorful shapes are mouthwatering. Yet, perhaps The Sweet Shoppe' s 
best feature is its unlimited warranty. The authors say, "Even a disk 
clogged with peanut butter and jelly will be cheerfully replaced." Your 
disk drive might not be so lucky. D6H

SI ANDREW CHRISTIE 



Now: a big, sprawling, tempestuous story of love and hate . . . pow- 
er and passion . . . struggle and survival ... in a wild, untamed land; a 
story that reaches across the generations, embracing countless families, 
rich and poor; a story of pioneers, tycoons, frontiersmen, prospectors, 
sailors, artists, revolutionaries, doctors, lawyers, architects, veterinari- 
ans, sales clerks, romance novelists . . . and you. This is your life. This 
is your heritage. This is the unbroken, expanding genetic line leading up 
to your existence, the study of which is known as genealogy, and which, 
in the microcomputer world, has drawn a group of enthusiastic practi- 
tioners. 

A brace of periodicals and a growing number of small software com- 
panies now support this labor-intensive hobby. Currently, if you decided 
to enlist your Apple to aid you in an extensive search of your family tree, 
you would have your choice of such programs as Roots/M from Comm- 
soft, Apple Tree Genealogy System from J. Fiske Software Systems, 
Family Roots from Quinsept, Genie from Central Research of Utah, or 
The Genealogist's Right Hand from User Friendly Systems. 

Then you would start reading up on the subject in general and start 
ferreting out old records and source documents. Eventually, you would 
make written inquiries to be run as the genealogical equivalent of classi- 
fied ads, like these in the Middletown, Pennsylvania-based Press and 
Journal: 

Barbara Kelsey Boese— Is searching for proof that Col. William 
Cook of the 12th Regt., Pa. Line, during the Revolution, who d. in Cum- 
berland Co., Pa. in 1804 had a dau Mary Ann who was b. in Augusta 
Co., Va. in 1771 and m. in 1795 in Augusta Co., Va. to Wm. Martin. 

Marietta Childs — Seeks data on southeastern Pennsylvania families 
whose members carried the traits of being deaf and dumb. Especially in- 
terested in any lines in the counties of York and Lancaster before 1775. 

At that point, you may reasonably conclude that you are a buff. 

One such is Kathryn Bassett of Pasadena, California, whose cor- 
porate handle in computer genealogy circles is Misc. Enterprises. When 
her stepson is at school and her husband is at work, Kathryn Bassett sits 
down with just her Apple, her printer, and Violet, her three-legged tabby 
cat, and charts the course of ancestry, which never did run smooth. 

For her, it all began with a vague memory of her maternal grand- 
mother "telling me that my great-grandmother, her husband's mother, 
was an Indian." The memory came back one day in 1978, in conversa- 
tion with a lawyer who was a full-blooded Apache. The memory 
lingered; she had time on her hands, and she finally decided to find out 
about her mysterious Indian ancestor. 

"The first thing I did was call my grandmother, who at first denied 
she'd ever told me such a thing, but several brothers and sisters affirmed 
that she had. She gave me a few names and dates to start with; then I 



went to the Mormon genealogy library in West Los Angeles to find out 
what I'd need in the way of supplies. I had a brainstorming session with 
my mom and dad and got some newspaper clippings they had and a 
family Bible. 

"From everything I found out, it looks like great-grandmother was 
not an Indian, but you get started and you get hooked. Genealogy is very 
addicting. I'm glad I have the time available to do research, and don't 
have to do it in addition to working outside the home and being a 
housewife on top of it." 

Among the supplies Kathryn Bassett picked up at that time was a 
twenty-five-page booklet called How To Get Organized and Stay That 
Way by Mary Schwartz, the only how-to book she has used continuously 
for six years. As she attests, "If you think you're going to get serious 
about genealogy, you have to get organized or you'll never get anything 
done; you'll lose everything." 

Her other most important tool is her Apple and her faithful printer 
(which she refers to, with genealogical aplomb, as a "first-generation 
Paper Tiger"). 

"Around the time I started to get interested in genealogy, my former 
husband was into computers, one of which was a Vector Graphics S-100 
system. I thought, T might be able to use that,' " a thought shared by 
quite a few other genealogists in the late seventies. She took the path 
most of them did, as there were no customized commercial programs 
available at the time. "I made a little program in Basic, strictly a storage 
thing. I had to put in every single name and all the data on each person. 
I put in John Doe and his parents, and when I got to his parents I'd still 
have to put each parent's name in and have duplicate input." 

When her marriage broke up, Kathryn Bassett got custody of the 
S-100. She eventually sold it to buy an Apple and printer; then she start- 
ed looking for more to do with them. The first genealogy program she 
found was Roots/M by Commsoft— "a very good program, but it has a 
limit of 1 ,000 records per disk, and you can't link your disks together. 
You have to have one family line on one disk and the other family line on 
another disk." 

While she was looking, she remarried. "My husband didn't want me 
to work, and I agreed, but I thought there might be something I could do 
at home to make a little extra without too much effort." She contacted 
Commsoft and offered her services as a sales representative out of her 
home, an offer Commsoft took her up on. As she sees it, "Software 
stores don't want to carry genealogical software because they don't know 
anything about genealogy." She made the same proposition to all the 
software companies listed in an issue of a newsletter called Genealogical 
Computing. Quinsept took her up on her offer, and in replying, they also 
confidently stated that of all the software available she would like their 
Family Roots program the best. 

She agreed. "Much as I liked the Commsoft program, I had to admit 



Quinsept's was better. It does more and supports multiple data disks. I 
have mine set up for four marriages and eighteen children per person. I 
can get 350 records on a disk, a record being all the statistics on one per- 
son, with his or her children's names." When she completes her re- 
search of her father's line, Rhinehart — of which she has discovered thir- 
ty-two spelling variants so far— Bassett will have between five and seven 
thousand names on disk. 

Nuts and Bolts. Computer-assisted genealogy is no different from 
any other business, vocation, or discipline to which a computer is intro- 
duced: The computer is an aid; you still have to do the work. There are 
steps any genealogist must take. 

"Interview your oldest relatives," urges Bassett. "Pick their brains. 
I recommend this even for people who aren't interested in working on 
genealogy right now. If you have any inkling that you might be interested 
in it someday, interview the relatives now. The tapes last, the relatives 
don't. 

"Then you sit there and go through whatever records you or the rela- 
tives might have on hand— birth, death, and marriage certificates. Most 
people will have their own birth certificates; your parents may have their 
marriage license. Get your parents' marriage record and birth records; 
then get your grandparents' death records, birth records, and marriage 
records, as far back as you can go. 

"Say you want to get your grandfather's death record; you don't 
know when he was born; all you know is he died in the fifties and he was 



in California. Write the California Office of Vital Statistics, tell them he 
died around 1955, and they'll search a ten-year-period index. When you 
get the death record, it'll have a birthdate and a birthplace; sometimes 
you get lucky and it will give a city or county where he was born; other 
times, just the state. Then, whether or not you're going to be successful 
in finding anything further depends on the year of birth. With anything 
prior to about 1910, you'll probably have to know the county of birth be- 
cause all the records were filed at the county seats, not at the state 
capitals." 

While the paper authentication of the three main events in an individ- 
ual's life are nice to get, they will sustain the genealogist only up to a 
point. Once one gets into a period prior to 1880, depending on the state, 
there simply aren't any records of births, deaths, or marriages. That's 
when you turn to the census. 

"When you look at microfilm of the census records," says Bassett, 
"you find most of them are indexed; in 1850 they started listing every 
member of the household. Before that, the census consisted of 'John 
Doe, head of household; two males, ages: five through ten ...' They 
didn't have names." 

Are You Sure Alex Haley Got His Start Like This? Sometimes, 
there are unavoidable and even insurmountable problems, otherwise 
known as acts of God. The census of 1890 went up in flames before the 
advent of microfilm. A page here and a page there turn up occasionally, 
but as far as building a genealogical record goes there is simply a yawn-

scendant chart would list the growing number of related progeny from a 
single source. 

ing chasm in American family histories between 1880 and 1900. "I wish 
it hadn't burned," sighs Kathryn Bassett. "I would love to find my fa- 
ther's mother in it. She would have been three years old and I might have 
been able to find out more about her father. All I know about her father 
is his name was John Thompson and supposedly he was born in Georgia. 
It's hard enough tracking relatives by ten-year gaps. When you've got a 
twenty-year gap, it makes things difficult. However, you persevere. 

"In some places, like Indiana, birth records are closed to the public. 
You can't go in and look something up yourself because they have il- 
legitimate births filed with those in wedlock. Now, of all the people I 
know who are interested in genealogy, no one cares if an ancestor was il- 
legitimate. But a lot of people would get absolutely paranoid if such in- 
formation were to get out about their families, so I can kind of see their 
reasoning. If you looked in the Vital Statistics microfilm records for any 
county in Indiana you'd find a notation that it has been pulled because of 
the privacy act. They will give you the information, but they look it up, 
not you, and you have to sign a form stating that you're a relative. Just a 
couple of states do that, so it doesn't interfere that much. Also, the Mor- 
mons microfilm everything for posterity, so it's no big thing." 

Since it has already come up twice in this story, let it here be ex- 
plained that the Mormon church is the savior of every genealogist in 
America, maintaining the most impressive body of personal records in 
the country, kept in a vault dug out of a granite mountain in the environs 
of Salt Lake City, Utah. "Unless a nuclear bomb made a direct hit on the 
vault itself, all those records would be perfectly preserved," marvels 
Bassett. "In the main library, the researchers have more than a million 
rolls of microfilm and several hundred thousand books. They have been 
going around the country for a number of years, starting in the east and

going county by county, getting any permission needed to microfilm all 
vital records; everything of genealogical value that a courthouse would 
have. If you want an old birth certificate from Doddridge County, West 
Virginia, and the courthouse has burned down, you're out of luck— 
unless the Mormons got there first and microfilmed it." 

Is this a vocation only a Ph.D. or research scientist could love? For 
Kathryn Bassett, who found college not to her liking and left after a year, 
it isn't if you go about it the right way. "When you start getting into 
things like county histories, you've usually done enough research that 
it's not that intimidating," she asserts. "If you walk into the Southern 
California Genealogical Society Library in Burbank and you see all these 
books, you think, 'Gee, I can go in there and look up my family history.' 
Well, I didn't even use book-type parts of libraries until I'd been doing 
research for a couple of years, because first of all you need to get all the 
information contained in birth, death, and marriage records, and that's 
not in a book. For census records you need to go to the largest libraries 
with microfilm records, or to a Mormon center, or to the National Ar- 
chives in Washington. 

"Last year I extended my line back three generations on three dif- 
ferent lines by pure luck." 

Should you ever get completely frustrated and hit a dead end on one 
line, Bassett recommends working on another one for a while. Each gen- 
eration doubles, so there should always be someone to be working on. 
She started with her mother's family, surnamed Ash, found several dis- 
tant cousins, and also found that they were doing the same thing she was. 
Avoiding duplicate input, she put the Ashes on hold to work on the 
Rhineharts, her father's side. 

At this juncture, an old tradition and an invaluable tool of the Ameri- 
can genealogist came into play: the family reunion, especially as it is 
practiced in Middle America. The Rhinehart clan gathers en masse in 
Heekin Park in Muncie, Indiana, every year, and has been doing so of- 
ficially since 1917. Kathryn Bassett attended and got all the pertinent in- 
formation on everybody and his brother, so to speak. In the case of the 
Ashes, her task was made easier by the work of the distant cousins, who 
shared their info with her. One discovered a ship's passenger listing for 
a Johann Adam Esch, who came to America in 1772, and deduced that he 
was the same person as Adam Ash, who served as a private in the Revo- 
lution. Anyone who can prove she's a descendant of Adam Ash, Revolu- 
tionary War veteran, is eligible for the D. A.R. , with access to all its rec- 
ords. The number of current qualifying individuals can only be guessed 
at, as Adam Ash had thirteen children. Cousin Arvil Ash kept figures on 
Adam's descendants through several lines, which Bassett has transferred 
to family group sheets— listings of father's name, mother's name, birth 
and death dates, and a list of all children with their information; they're 
easier to follow than a straight narrative. She has one notebook full of all 
Adam Ash's descendants through Christopher Ash, her direct ancestor, 
and another notebook of all descendants through offspring other than 
Christopher Ash. 

With the Rhineharts and the Ashes already occupying several floppy 
disks, she is now working on her husband's line and has gotten back to 
great-grandfather Samuel Adison Bassett. 

"All I'd been able to find out was that his mother's name was 
Mahala. It was on his marriage record — she had to sign it because he was 
underage. Maybe she was a widow, because she signed instead of his fa- 
ther. I talked to more relatives and found Samuel's father's name was 
Oliver. A Bassett came over on the Fortune in the colonial days. A lot of 
organizations keep records from that time, so I figured that if I could find 
his name I could connect it with a lot of colonial Bassett information. No 
luck. I could find no Oliver Bassett. 

"Now I'm hoping to find Oliver's father." 

What are the solid results of a computer genealogist's labors? 
Usually, a large, hardbound book is produced, published at the genealo- 
gist's expense and sold to relatives. Kathryn Bassett is considering offer- 
ing a service whereby she would input the ancestral data of other peo- 
ple's families into the Apple at twenty-five cents per name record plus a 
twenty-five-dollar startup fee. 

These results are clearly secondary. This line of study, open to all, 
goes on simply because everyone has roots, because it is an affirmation 
of the continuity of life, because humanity will always be fascinated by 
the most literal kind of immortality available to it.

THE RIGHT 
TOOL 
FOR THE 
RIGHT JOB 

Part of Apple's marketing plan for this year is to 
define more clearly the line that separates the Lisa and 
Macintosh computers from the Apple II and III com- 
puters. Good idea. 

When deciding which Apple to buy, one of the first 
questions people will have to answer is, "What do I in- 
tend to do with my computer?" You can't mow the lawn 
with a razor, and you can't shave by holding a power 
mower up to your chin. Or leg. 

Same thing goes for computer magazines like the 
one you're reading. You won't find much about mice, 
icons, or windows in these pages. What you will find is 
stuff related to the Apple II and III. And then some. 

The New Original Softalk. This month marks the 
beginning of a few new tasty items. Just Think ... is a 
section that features essays on subjects that transcend 
computer brands and sometimes all computers. 
Authors will include prominent figures in computerdom, 
such as Doug Carlston and Michael Berlyn. There will 
even be a piece about piracy and computer crime writ- 
ten by some guy named Steve Wozniak. 

April will mark the debut of a feature that will be a 
running commentary on anything in the world even 
remotely related to computers. Or not related to them. 
It's hard to describe; you won't know why it's in Softalk, 
but you'll know it belongs. 

Of course, we'll still carry the usual tutorials like 
David Durkee's Applesoft column, Bill Budge's 
Graphics Page, an all-new Beginner's Comer, and the 
sections for business and investing. 

It's all going to be here. You can pick up Softalk 
from the magazine rack every month, or you can save a 
whole lot of money by subscribing. For first-time 
subscribers, just send your Apple serial number and 
get a trial subscription to Softalk for free. That's right, $0. 

If you're a current subscriber or if you don't have an 
Apple, you can get a year of Softalk delivered to your 
home for just $24, a savings of 33 percent off the news- 
stand price. And we don't even care what you do with 
all the money you save.

The Future through a Hayes 

"With time modems are going to get less ex- 
pensive, they're going to get faster, and they're 
going to get smarter. We're going to see techno- 
logical advances that will allow prices to come 
down without sacrificing profits." 

Dennis Hayes, founder and president of 
Hayes Microcomputer Products, ought to 
know. His company set the standard for mo- 
dems way back in 1977. Although there's great 
promise in telecommunications, Hayes says, 
it's difficult to say just how or when it's going 
to be fulfilled. 

"People have been asking me for five years 
if computers are going to have built-in modems 
like they have disk drives, and I just don't think 
so. Some computer companies are beginning to 
recognize the importance of communications, 
and particularly with the portable computers 
you'll start seeing built-in 300-baud or 1200- 
baud modems, such as in the Grid. 




Dennis Hayes, founder and president of Hayes 
Microcomputer Products, credits his company's 
success to its emphasis on quality, value, and 
service to its users. 



"But in general-purpose computer systems 
you won't see many built-in modems because a 
lot is happening now in modem technology. 
And modems increase the cost of the computer. 
Another issue is what modem should be built in. 
Should its baud rate be 300, 1200, 2400, or 
something else? With the Macintosh, you've 
got the communication port provided and you 
attach externally any modems that would be ap- 
propriate for your use." 

Demodulating the Future. For the most 
part, the future of telecomputing won't be deter- 
mined by how manufacturers are configuring 
the products, according to Hayes. The future is 
ultimately decided by the users— their needs and 
their willingness to take advantage of the vari- 
ous options telecommunications makes possi- 
ble. Hayes recognizes that "a large number of 
users are realizing the value of telecomput- 
ing—being able to connect to a network or data- 
base and extract the data they need." 

More and more professionals are using elec- 
tronic mail. "We'll see an increasing demand 
for the ability to communicate in a timely way 
and pick up messages at your convenience," 
Hayes predicts. 

"As people get more experience using elec- 
tronic mail, I think we'll see it taking on slightly 
different forms. The distribution of such mail 
will be addressed, as well as the confirmation of 
the delivery of messages. There's an advantage 
there in that it will take a load off the post office 
that it doesn't need to carry. Messages can be 
delivered that don't have to be put into enve- 
lopes, stamped, and handled." 

Hayes started assembling modems for sale at 
home on his dining room table in 1977. At that 
time, neither modems nor personal computers 
were quite the hot items they are today. "The 
problem we had in the beginning," Hayes 
recalls, "was who was there to talk to with a 
modem?" 

When the Apple appeared on the scene, 
Hayes saw a whole new market opening up. 
The machine had expansion ports and a reliable 
power supply. He jumped in head first and was 
soon selling a ton of modems— first the highly 
successful Micromodem, then Micromodem II, 
and now Micromodem lie and Smartmodem. At 
the time of So/ra/fc's profile of Hayes 
Microcomputer Products in November 1981, 
the company was on top of the microcomputer 
telecommunications world. 



Located in Atlanta, Georgia, Hayes 
Microcomputer Products has remained a com- 
petitive, viable force in the market. The com- 
pany has benefited greatly from Dennis Hayes's 
belief in combining the best of Western and Far 
Eastern business techniques. A long-time ad- 
mirer of Japanese management style and manu- 
facturing efficiency, Hayes has traveled to Ja- 
pan to see their methods close up. 

"In Japan I found a very energetic group of 
people working very hard— there's no magic in 
it. The best Japanese management studied the 
best American management. A lot of things 
they learned came originally from American 
companies. It certainly affected our thinking at 
Hayes, though." 

Back home in Georgia, the Japanese ideas 
Hayes admired took on a distinctively American 
cast.' 'Where the Japanese talked about harmony 
in the workplace, I would talk about teamwork 
and a cooperative approach to problem solving, 
as opposed to a confrontation approach to prob- 
lem solving. 

"In the confrontation mode, it's either win 
or lose," Hayes continues. "If approached in a 
cooperative sense, there's probably some truth 
to both sides of an issue, and there's never a 
simple compromise. A solution that would in- 
corporate the concerns of both creates a new 
synthesis, and with that approach you end up 
with a better solution. 

"If the subject you're talking about is a 
feature in a product, then that synthesis 
becomes important to the user of that product. 
The reason the Smartmodem ended up having 
the qualities and features that it does is because 
we went through many conflicts between things 
like costs and capabilities and solved them in a 
cooperative way. The synthesis incorporates the 
concerns of people in marketing, engineering, 
and production. 

"A lot of people see Hayes as a modem 
company," says Hayes. "I don't see us as just a 
modem company. I see us as providing solu- 
tions. That's why we got into software. A 
modem can do so much, but you need a pro- 
gram in the computer to take full advantage of 
it." Smartcom I is Hayes's premier software 
product for the Apple market. It's a terminal 
software package that helps you place calls to 
remote systems, store phone numbers, and an- 
swer calls automatically. It works with standard 
DOS, as well as CP/M and Pascal.

A Modern Renaissance Man 

"I don't think that the creative innovators at 
this point in time are in the art world," says vid- 
eo artist Steve Beck. "They're in the market- 
place, and a lot of them are in the computer in- 
dustry." 

If Apples had been around at the time of the 
Renaissance, there's no doubt that a man like 
Leonardo da Vinci would have been among the 
first to get his hands on one. Five hundred years 
later, personal computing provides a versatile 
means of expression to creative, multitalented 
people like Steve Beck — people who choose not 
to succumb to twentieth-century pressures to 
specialize. Artist, inventor, electrical engineer, 
software developer— Beck is all of these. 



been amazed at how much performance is being 
squeezed out of the Apple II in this role. Some 
of the Apples are handling up to thirty stores." 

The function of energy monitoring has tradi- 
tionally been carried out by mechanical devices 
without any kind of centralized control. With 
the systems developed by Beck-Tech, a regional 
supervisor can use an Apple to dial up individ- 
ual stores over standard phone lines and moni- 
tor or alter factors affecting energy consump- 
tion, like the overall temperature levels in a 
store, or in specific places, like individual fro- 
zen food cases. If any energy management sys- 
tems are not functioning properly, this informa- 
tion is relayed automatically to the Apple and 
can then be promptly remedied, reducing the 
risk of irreparable product damage. 




The art seems to mesmerize the artist as Steve Beck enters the throes of creation with his 
Apple. 



In the late 1960s and early 1970s Steve 
Beck was enjoying a career as a successful vid- 
eo artist. Working at the National Center for 
Experiments in Television, under a grant pro- 
vided by the National Endowment for the Arts, 
Beck developed a video synthesizer. Many of 
his video pieces have been aired on PBS over 
the years. They can also be found in art collec- 
tions around the world. 

Softalk first introduced readers to Beck and 
his hardware/software development company, 
Beck-Tech, in November 1981. At that time 
Beck-Tech was three years old and already be- 
coming as diverse as the man who founded it. 
Consider for a moment just one of Beck-Tech's 
areas of focus: energy management. 

"There are about three thousand of our sys- 
tems in the United States alone, with Apples be- 
ing used as communications central. We've 



The company's first business communica- 
tions product is Datalink, a battery-operated, 
hand-held terminal with a built-in modem and 
mini QWERTY keyboard. Easily carried 
around by travelers who might wish to tap into 
The Source or Dow Jones, Datalink is designed 
to talk to a serial card with the standard terminal 
software. Since Datalink's introduction a year 
ago, Bech-Tech has created several applications 
packages for Apples that talk to the Datalink 
terminals. Among these are a messaging sys- 
tem, an order-entry system, an electronic mail 
package, and a banking system. 

Like many other software developers, Beck 
is intrigued by Lisa Technology and the Macin- 
tosh. 

' 'One of our first goals as soon as we can get 
our hands on a Macintosh is to take the software 
we've developed on the Apple II and write 



equivalent programs for the Mac as a commum 
cations center. I see the biggest application for 
Datalink in the area of electronic mail. I really 
think 1984 is going to be the year for electronic 
mail." 

Where Ya' Going with that Video Cam- 
era, Steve? Later this year, Beck will release 
The Direct Video Album on his own Electron la- 
bel and thereby bring his video work to a wider 
audience. The album includes a collection of 
Beck's best video works for VHS, Beta, and la- 
ser disk formats. Another album in the works 
includes video works by Beck and other artists 
scored to the innovative music of sixties guitar- 
ist Jimi Hendrix. 

"I'm always looking for insights into the 
visual language. How can we really com- 
municate with another culture that doesn't 
speak our language or read our writing? The on- 
ly hope is to hit upon some of the key terms of 
what can be called a visual language: certain 
images— Jung called them archetypal — that res- 
onate and have meaning for all humans. 

"All of this comes right back to certain 
things that have a direct bearing on writing soft- 
ware and making it a more meaningful connec- 
tion between a user's concept and the achieve- 
ment of his desired results. In the end, what it 
comes down to is a matter of definition and 
clarity of thought." 

MacVincis on the Horizon. Beck believes 
that the icon approach of the Macintosh's user 
interface may be a decisive step toward a more 
highly developed visual language.

The master key to every DOS 3.3 disk is the volume table of con- 
tents, or VTOC (say vee-talk). The VTOC can always be found in sector 
0 of track 17 ($11) on DOS 3.3 disks. The VTOC supplies DOS with 
some important information about a disk. Our main objective this month 
is to take a look at the VTOC's disk sector map and find out how it can be 
used— even by a simple Basic program— to determine the number of free 
sectors on a disk. 

In addition to the disk sector map, the VTOC contains other interest- 
ing stuff, including where the catalog starts, how many tracks and sec- 
tors the disk has, and what track was last used for saving data. Figure 1 
shows an annotated decimal display of the beginning of a typical VTOC. 



Inside DOS there is a 256-byte buffer where the VTOC of the disk 
currently being accessed (or last accessed) is kept. This buffer starts at 
byte 4601 1 ($B3BB). Whenever a new disk is initialized, the contents of 
this buffer are written into the VTOC of the new disk. The incredible 
thing is that a large part of this new VTOC isn't new at all— it's a copy of 
the VTOC of the last disk accessed. 

Grandfather VTOC. In figure 1 , only those items marked with an 
asterisk (the disk volume number, the last track allocated and direction of 



allocation, and the disk sector map) are updated during an init. All the 
other bytes shown are simply passed down through the generations. 

For example, take that first byte. On every DOS 3.3 disk we've ever 
seen, that byte contains a four. But nobody knows why. DOS itself never 
uses this byte. The fourth byte in the table is supposedly the DOS version 
number. On DOS 3.2 disks, this byte held a two. It hardly matters what's 
there— DOS never uses it. And the last two bytes shown in the figure re- 
portedly represent the number of bytes in a sector (in backward hexa- 
decimal notation those bytes equal 256). But again, DOS makes no effort 
to put those values there when a new disk is initialized and never refers 
to them at any other time. 

Even more amazing are the numbers Uncle DOS refers to in his daily 
activities but doesn't purposefully set when a new disk is initialized. The 
second and third bytes, for example, point to the disk's first catalog sec- 
tor. Every time a disk is catalogued, DOS looks here to find out where 
the catalog is. 

By changing these numbers, you can actually move the catalog to an- 
other track (except track 0) or have it start at an unusual sector. But don't 
do it unless you love trouble. If you use a disk with a relocated catalog 
just before initializing a new disk, the new disk won't work right. This is 
because DOS doesn't correct the catalog pointer in the VTOC during an 
init— it just uses what's already there. The newly initialized disk's cata- 
log will be in track 17, but the VTOC will say the catalog is elsewhere; 
DOS will be unable to find it. 

Some of you may have noticed a similar problem when reinitializing 
Pascal, CP/M, or ProDOS disks for use with DOS 3.3. If you attempt to 
catalog the disk just before initializing (to make sure it is the disk you 
thought it was), you'll load DOS's VTOC buffer with whatever trash is 
in track 17, sector 0, on the disk. This trash will be transferred to your 
new disk by the init command. The newly initialized disk will fail to 
work correcdy. 

To avoid this problem, always catalog a good DOS 3.3 disk just 
before entering the init command. 

Counting the Free Sectors. The VTOC's disk sector map is a bit 
map. In this kind of map, one bit is used to describe the status of each 
item in the map. In the VTOC's disk sector map, each sector on the disk 
is assigned a bit, and that sector's status— free or in use— can be deter- 
mined by looking at it. If the bit is set to 1 , the sector is free; if set to 0, 
the sector is in use. 

Bit maps are not easy to use from Basic. Basic has no commands for 
examining the status of individual bits. Machine language, on the other 
hand, has several bit-level instructions that DOS uses when reading or 
changing the bit map. 

Basic programmers actually have to take a byte apart to discover the

status of its individual bits. The following listing shows a brute force 
method of testing a byte's bits using Basic: 

10 PRINT : INPUT "BYTE VALUE: ";B$ : PRINT 
20 IF LEN(B$) = 0 THEN END 

30 B = VAL(B$) : IF B<0 OR B>255 THEN PRINT "RANGE ERROR" : 

GOTO 10 
35 GOSUB 40 : GOTO 10 

40 REM ** BRUTE FORCE BIT TESTER ** 

41 IF B> 127 THEN B = B- 128 : PRINT "BIT 7 SET" 
42IFB> 63 THEN B = B - 64 : PRINT "BIT 6 SET" 

43 IF B> 31 THEN B = B- 32 : PRINT "BIT 5 SET" 

44 IF B> 15 THEN B = B- 16 : PRINT "BIT 4 SET" 

45 IF B> 7 THEN B = B- 8 : PRINT "BIT 3 SET" 
46IFB> 3 THEN B = B- 4 : PRINT "BIT 2 SET" 
47 IF B> 1 THEN B = B- 2 : PRINT "BIT 1 SET" 
48IFB> 0 THEN B = B- 1 : PRINT "BIT 0 SET" 
49 RETURN 

This method is possible because each bit in a byte represents a spe- 
cific value, as shown in the table in figure 2. For example, if a byte is 
equal to or greater than 128, then that byte's seventh or 128s bit must 
be set.

Figure 3 shows a decimal display of a typical VTOC, including the 
beginning of the free space bit map. This disk is a new one— tracks 0 
through 2, the DOS tracks, are shown in use (all bits=0; byte value =0). 
AH sectors in tracks 3 through 16 are free (all bits = 1 ; byte value =255). 
Track 17, the catalog track, is in use. 



A L K MARCH 1984 



As you can see in this table, each track is allocated four bytes in the 
bit map. Four bytes hold thirty-two bits— thus the bit map was designed 
to accommodate as many as thirty-two sectors in each track. Since DOS 
3.3 disks have only sixteen sectors per track, only two of the four bytes 
are actually used. The table in figure 4 shows the relationship between 
the bits in these two bytes and the sectors they represent.

Elementary Map Reading. To determine how much free space is on 
a disk, all you have to do is count the number of bits in the free space 
map that are set to one. This task is greatly simplified, since DOS loads 
the VTOC of every disk it uses into an internal buffer. As mentioned 
earlier, this buffer begins at byte 4601 1 ($B3BB). The free space bit map

Listing 1, Basic free space subroutine 



Catalog with Free Sectors. One of the handiest of all DOS modifica- 
tions gets the file manager to display a disk's free space every time a disk 
is catalogued. To modify DOS, of course, we have to descend into the 
murky world of assembly language. Otherwise, the principles are the 
same as the ones we have already used. 

If you have no interest in assembly language, skip the following list- 
ing but read the rest of this column. Near the end there's a Saint Patrick's 
Day program that will add a leprechaun to your DOS. He'll tell you how 
much disk space you have every time you do a catalog. Now, for those of 
you who are interested, listing 2 shows an assembly language subroutine 
that does in a few microseconds what slowpoke Basic takes four seconds 
to do. 



In order to calculate the number of free sectors on a disk, just get 
DOS to read the disk with catalog (or any other command that activates 
the disk drive— the idea here is to get the disk's VTOC loaded into the 
buffer), then count the number of bits set in the bit map. If we use a 
modified version of our brute force bit tester (one that counts the bits 
rather than sending us messages about them), the code for peeking at the 
bit map would look something like this: 



12 FS = 0 

14 FOR ADR = 46067 TO 46067 + ((35- 

16 B = PEEK(ADR) : GOSUB 40 

18 B = PEEK(ADR + 1) : GOSUB 40 

20 NEXT : RETURN 



1)*4) STEP 4 



40 REM ** BRUTE FORCE BIT TESTER ** 

41 IF B > 1 27 THEN B = B - 1 28 : FS = FS + 1 

and so on . . . 

However, since DOS will never use any sectors in track 0, even if 
they are marked as free, there is no reason to count those bytes. In fact, 
if we do count them, and they for some reason indicate a sector is free, 
the amount of free space the program finds will be deceptive. We may 
think we have a few more sectors left, but DOS will insist the disk is full. 

Another consideration is that a good free space program should auto- 
matically adapt itself to disks that have more than thirty-five tracks. 
Since the number of tracks on the disk is readily available in the VTOC 
at byte 46063 ($B3EF), as shown in the VTOC display in figure 1 , a bet- 
ter way to loop through the bit map would be: 

14 FOR ADR = 46071 TO 46067 + ((PEEK(46063)- 1)*4) STEP 4 

This looping method, combined with the brute force bit tester, re- 
quires about four seconds to determine the amount of free space on a 
disk. Some of you wizards out there can probably figure out how to do it 
faster now that you know what's involved. Listing 1 shows the complete 
brute force subroutine for determining the free space on a disk from 
Basic.

18 B = PEEK(ADR + 1) : GOSUB 40

MARCH 1984 



B6F6- AO 1440 .5 AS - "SROTCES EERF " 

Listing 2. Assembly language free space leprechaun. 

This free space program uses a DOS subroutine at byte 44610 
($AE42) that is supposed to convert a two-byte hexadecimal number 
stored at bytes 68 and 69 ($44-$45) into decimal and print it. The sub- 
routine is used when catalog displays a disk's volume number and when 
it displays the sector length of files. The only problem with it, as you 
may already know, is that it doesn't work correctly with numbers larger 
than 255. 

Apple's DOS Programmer's Manual (page 153) indicates this is be- 
cause DOS doesn't correctly store a file's sector length in the catalog. 
However, the manual is mistaken. The problem is a bug in the DOS 
subroutine itself. 

In order for our disk free space patch to work correctly, we also have 
to fix the bug in the hexadecimal to decimal subroutine. Fortunately, a 
fix for this subroutine was published in Call -A.P.P.L.E. In Depth #3: 
All About DOS. The author of the fix, Richard D. Norling, and the folks 
at Call -A.P.P.L.E. have given us permission to repeat the patch here. 
We will do so shortly. If you want to know how it works, see All About 
DOS, page 197. 

Another problem with our free space patch is that we are putting it in 
an area inside DOS, $B6B3 to $B6FC, that is normally, but not always, 
available for use. In addition to the many programs that use this space, 
the latest version of DOS 3.3, as we saw last month, uses its first twenty- 
eight bytes. We'll have to test to make sure this area is empty before in- 
stalling the patch. If the newest version of DOS 3.3 is found, you can still 
squeeze the patch in. But you'll have to banish the "free sectors" 
message. In this case, you'll just have to know what that little number to 
the right of the disk's volume number is. 

A final point of small importance about the free space patch is that it 
checks all four bytes in the disk sector for each track. Our Basic routine

only checked two of the four, but this was to save time. It would take 
more space to avoid checking all four in assembly language, and space is 
at a premium here. The difference in execution speed wouldn't be notice- 
able anyhow. 

Free Space Finale. Listing 3 shows a Basic program that tests to 
make sure the area at $B6B3 is empty, and, if so, installs the disk free 
space patch and fixes the DOS hexadecimal to decimal conversion 
routine. 

When typing in the C$ strings, it is important that you put at least one 
space between each hexadecimal number. However, it isn 't necessary to 
use more than one space or to line the numbers up in columns as we have 
done here — that's just so you can read the strings more easily.

Listing 3. DOS free space patcher. 



This program uses the popular S.H. Lam technique in lines 500 
through 520. The C$ strings are actually Monitor commands. Line 510 
pokes the strings into the keyboard input buffer; line 520 tricks the Moni- 
tor into executing them as if they had just been typed on the keyboard. 
The little ditty we add to each string in line 500 gets the Monitor to pass 
control back to our Applesoft program. Using this technique minimizes 
the amount of typing necessary to enter the program. If you know for 
certain which version of DOS you have, it will be necessary to type in 
only the strings for your version. 

After running this program you can make the free space patch perma- 
nent by initializing a new disk. The DOS on the new disk will include the 
patch — bring it to life by booting the disk. 

An alternative way to find out how much space is on a disk, of 
course, is to use FID on the DOS 3.3 System Master disk. ProDOS and 
Pascal include a disk free space report as standard catalog equipment. 

That's it for this month. Next month we'll do a little April Fooling 
around. See you then. 31

But now, Microcom moves the 
personal computer into a new era of communi- 
cations compatibility with Era 2-the first Personal 
Computer Communications System with the 
industry-standard communications protocol 
MNP. Era 2 finally enables dissimilar personal 
computers to communicate with one another 
reliably and cost effectively. It also allows the 
personal computer to access public data 
networks easily and error-free. 
A closer look at Era 2. 

Era 2 with MNP is a 1200 baud Communi-

Apple II owners who have an opportunity to use a Lisa or a Macin- 
tosh may be charmed by the new machines, but they'll probably decide 
to stick with their Apple lis. Once you've invested so much time in get- 
ting to know a machine inside and out, you think of it as part of yourself. 
Besides, it's always difficult to switch word processors, and if you use a 
word processor a lot, you'll probably find some favorite feature absent 
from MacWrite. Nevertheless, the next time you sit down to your 
favorite Apple II word processor, you might be chagrined to find 
yourself reaching for a phantom mouse. 

The first reaction is always, "I don't need a mouse. I want to keep 
my hands on the keyboard." But after a few exposures to mousing, one 
of your hands begins to "think" differentiy. It consistently misses the 
cursor control keys by a good six inches. 

Cheese It! Now— or soon, considering it's on Apple Standard 
Time— there's a mouse for the Apple II . The AppleMouse II looks just 



errant brush stroke but restoring the picture underneath it. 

If you want to move or copy part of a picture, you can draw an 
editor's box around it. With the box around something, you can move it 
by dragging it around with the mouse without disturbing the background 
you drag it over. Or you can copy it into a buffer and reproduce it 
anyplace you want. Even copy it into another picture. 

Text can be placed anyplace on the picture in any of five different 
fonts just by clicking the text icon, clicking the font from a menu, and 
clicking the point where writing should begin. Hitting backspace erases 
letters and replaces them with whatever they were written over (one 
tends to use the phrase without destroying the background a lot in 
describing MousePaint). 

The creation of lines and geometric shapes is facilitated by a process 
called rubber banding. Budge didn't invent rubber banding any more 
than MacPaint author Bill Atkinson did, but Budge has managed the 




Br DAVID DUMEE 



like the Macintosh mouse: It has the same nicely beveled case in Apple 
beige, and the same big gray button. Underneath it has the same rubber- 
coated steel ball. A plastic locking ring holds the ball within its alcove, 
and gravity, when the mouse is right-side up on the desk, holds the ball 
against the two internal wheels that detect horizontal and vertical motions 
and convert them into signals to the computer. Turning the locking ring 
a few degrees allows the ball to pop out so that it and the rollers can be 
freed of dust periodically. This seems to be the only maintenance the 
mouse requires. 

Of course the mouse is no good without software to read it. While 
various developers are working on original mouse-based software and 
revisions of existing programs, the first program for the mouse comes as 
part of the package. This is not Apple's typical hardware demonstration 
program; it's a full graphics tool by Bill Budge that bears a striking re- 
semblance to MacPaint on the Macintosh. 

If MacWrite doesn't cause Apple II word processing aficionados to 
convert to the Mac, MacPaint will tempt many a computer artist. One 
look at Budge's MousePaint, however, may just bring them back. It 
doesn't have all the features of MacPaint, but it has many of them. More 
important than individual features, it captures the spirit, the style, the 
ease of use, and even most of the speed. Most important, it has one thing 
MacPaint lacks: color. 

Behind the Color Mac. MousePaint is a freehand drawing program. 
Through the use of various tools, the movements of the mouse are con- 
verted into brush strokes, lines, curves, patterns, and shapes. In some 
ways, using MousePaint is easier than drawing on paper. For instance, 
the eraser doesn't leave rubbings behind or wear a hole in the page no 
matter how often you use it. A magnified mode called Fatbits blows up a 
section of the screen and allows dots to be turned on and off individually. 
It also allows very fine control of all the other drawing modes. An undo 
command deletes your last action from the screen, not only erasing the 



most ambitious and impressive implementation of rubber banding on the 
Apple II to date. 

You create a rectangle by clicking on the rectangle icon, moving the 
mouse pointer to one corner, holding the button down, and moving the 
mouse pointer to the location of the opposite corner. With rubber band- 
ing, the rectangle is drawn, erased, and redrawn until the mouse button 
is released. Circles and ovals are done the same way. You lay down the 
opposite corners of an invisible rectangle, and the computer creates the 
largest circle or oval that will fit within that shape, rubber banding it un- 
til the mouse button is released. This is really impressive when it's done 
with filled circles. Not only is the outline of the circle drawn and 
redrawn, but the pattern or color used for filling is as well. And the 
background isn't changed until the mouse button is released, so you can 
stretch the circle to a really big size and then shrink it. The drawing un- 
derneath will still be there when you come back. In fact, the background 
actually is intact beneath the shape even after you set it down ' 'perma- 
nently"; if your very next move is to click undo from the edit menu, the 
shape disappears. 

Art for Art's Sake. Equally impressive is Budge's implementation 
of Mac-like overlapping windows and menus. Three information win- 
dows are available in MousePaint. One allows the selection of brush 
shapes and sizes for the paintbrush tool. Because part of the screen is oc- 
cupied with menu bars, tools, and paint patterns, the working area is ac- 
tually a viewport into part of the page, which is the full size and dimen- 
sions of the hi-res screen; so the second window shows in miniature what 
the whole picture looks like. The third window is called About Mouse- 
Paint, and it credits Budge as the author and gives credit for inspiration 
to Atkinson and MacPaint. Any of these three windows can be over- 
lapped, moved, brought from behind another to the front, or closed and 
put away. The background always comes back perfectly. 

The menus also work just like Mac and Lisa menus. A bar at the top

of the screen lists the names of all the available menus— MousePaint'' s 
are File, Edit, Aids, and Font— and pressing the mouse button while 
pointing to any of them reveals the list of options in that menu. The menu 
remains on the screen, overlapping the picture and any other open win- 
dows, until the button is released. If the pointer is indicating any of the 
options on the menu when it is released, that function is executed. 

Not all of the Apple II programs that are eventually written for the 
mouse will follow Macintosh conventions so closely. For many applica- 
tions, it isn't necessary. Nevertheless, MousePaint shows that the Apple 
II is still capable of benefiting from all those oft-cited hours that went 
into the development of Lisa Technology. It also shows that Bill Budge 
retains the right to walk among the graphics gods of computer pro- 
gramming. 

Budge has other plans for the AppleMouse II besides MousePaint. 
He's working on a graphics toolkit that will take advantage of the mouse. 
The toolkit will be based on QuickDraw, the set of routines in the Macin- 
tosh ROM that provides the graphics functions for everything on the 
Mac. The toolkit will provide routines for assembly language program- 
mers to do most of the things that MousePaint does: polygons, circles, 
patterns, bit maps, proportionally spaced type fonts, and so on. Another 
part of the toolkit is a desktop manager, which can be used to manage 
folders, icons, and pull-down menus. Together, these routines will allow 
programmers to make Apple II behave like a Macintosh. Budge is also 
working on mouse-based font and brush and pattern editors to be used in 
conjunction with MousePaint. And he'll be updating his Pinball Con- 
struction Set, which used Lisa-like icons before Lisa was even available, 
to use the mouse as well. 

Other developers with mice in their future include Penguin Software, 
Electronic Arts, and Quark Engineering. Penguin's Dave Albert says 
that future revisions of The Graphics Magician and The Complete 
Graphics System will include mouse drivers, as will the upcoming Cat 
Graphics, a set of ampersand graphics utilities. Tim Gill, president of 
Quark, reports that Catalyst He will use but not require the mouse. 
Catalyst He is a version of Catalyst moved down from the Apple HI to 
run under ProDOS. The program allows for a library of application pro- 
grams to be moved onto a hard disk and run from a user-designed menu. 



Gill also is considering a revision of Word Juggler lie to use the mouse 
In addition to Pinhall Construction Set, Electronic Arts's Cut and Paste 
and Financial Cookbook will be able to read mouse input. 

The Technical Considerations. The mouse is connected to the Ap- 
ple II through an interface card that can go in any unoccupied slot from 
one to seven. The interface card carries a 6520 processor and eight 
routines in firmware that make the mouse a good deal faster and more re- 
sponsive than a joystick. The card can be programmed to interrupt the 
Apple either every sixtieth of a second or to report certain events- 
movement of the mouse or a click on the button. 

There is also a passive mode, in which the mouse is read only when 
the currently running program asks for it, the way a program reads a 
joystick. The advantage of the mouse's ability to interrupt the computer 
is that when something happens, the program won't miss it because it 
wasn't looking. But the program doesn't have to waste any time looking 
at the mouse to see if anything is happening. This feature will make the 
mouse attractive to machine language programmers, which will even- 
tually translate into lots of software for the mouse. 

The mouse can also be read from Basic by doing an in# to its slot and 
an input statement. The mouse tells the program its coordinate location 
and the status of the mouse button. As an added bonus, it also reports 
whether a key has been pressed, so a Basic program can take all its major 
input through the mouse input command. 

The AppleMouse Barometer. There is still some speculation about 
whether the mouse is the wave of the future or just a trendy gimmick. 
The ultimate success or failure of Lisa Technology will tell us, in gen- 
eral, whether the computing world needs mice. How the mouse does on 
the Apple II will probably prove a far more specific indication of its 
strengths and weaknesses. 

The mouse is likely to be good for some things and not as good for 
others. There is a huge body of software for the Apple II that is incom- 
patible with a mouse. All other things being equal, the areas where new 
mouse-based software provides stiff competition for existing programs 
will be the areas where a mouse is really beneficial. Because everything 
on the Macintosh and the Lisa is mouse-dependent, those computers will 
never answer these questions. The Apple II will. Hi

Dow Theory Explained, Winning on Wall Street 



In this month's tutorial section, we'll explore Dow Theory, the oldest 
form of technical analysis on "the Street." 

Dow Theory is the brainchild of Charles H. Dow (of Dow Jones 
fame), who popularized his ideas in a series of Wall Street Journal edi- 
torials published between 1900 and 1902. Dow reasoned that investors 
could better use stock prices as indicators of overall business conditions 
in order to forecast stock prices, rather than using the prices of the stocks 
themselves for forecasting. Dow's thinking is easy to follow: If a busi- 
ness is flourishing, its profits should increase; this, in turn, should in- 
crease dividends and thus the price of stock. 

Charles Dow's successor, William Peter Hamilton, further devel- 
oped Dow's basic principles, publishing them in the book The Stock 
Market Barometer in 1921. Then in 1932, Robert Rhea's Dow Theory, a 
more formal and complete account of the theory, appeared. Many of the 
technical analysis techniques in use today are derived from Dow Theory; 
it is truly the granddaddy of them all. 

Dow Theory attempts to identify changes in the primary movements 
of the market. Once the Dow theorist has identified a trend, he follows it 
until it reverses. The theory is concerned with the direction of trends, not 
with their magnitude or duration. 

Dow Theory assumes that the majority of the stocks in the market fol- 
low an underlying trend or pattern most of the time. Charles Dow con- 
structed two indexes, the industrial index (which originally contained 
twelve issues and now has thirty) and the rail index (which originally 
contained twelve railroad stocks but now includes other forms of trans- 
portation stocks and is called the transportation index) to measure this 
underlying pattern. 

According to Dow Theory, in order to analyze a stock you must 
know the daily closing prices of these two averages and the total number 
of transactions on the New York Stock Exchange. It's assumed that the 
daily changes in the closing prices of securities reflect the judgment and 
emotions of the participants with regard to the market as a whole. If we 
agree that the stock market is indeed an "auction" market— one in which 
all participants have the same information and the same chance to bid on 
a security — then we can assume under Dow Theory (or any other theory, 
for that matter) that the Dow Jones thirty industrials average and the 
Dow Jones transportations index reflect the expectations of the market. 
Thus, these indexes can be considered to represent the emotional index, 
forecasts, and expectations of the market and of the business sector as 
a whole. 

Dow Theory's second major assumption is that there are three simul- 
taneous movements in the stock market: primary movements, secondary 
reactions, and minor movements. 

Primary movements are overall general market trends, such as a ris- 
ing market (a bull market) or a falling market (a bear market). Either of 
these market conditions can last anywhere from several months to sev- 
eral years. 

Secondary reactions are major changes within a long-term primary 
movement, such as a substantial rally within a bear market or a large de- 
cline within a bull market. According to Dow Theory author Rhea, a sec- 
ondary reaction usually lasts anywhere from three weeks to three 



months; its magnitude will be from 33 to 66 percent of the primary price 
change since the preceding secondary reaction. Some latter-day Dow 
theorists believe that a secondary reaction can go as high as 100 percent 
of the previous primary price movement, but many feel that the move 
will normally fall within the 45 to 70 percent range. 

For a Dow theorist, being able to distinguish between a new primary 
movement and a secondary reaction within a primary movement is cru- 
cial. Unfortunately, it's easy to misjudge the behavior of the market in 
this regard. 

The lifespan of a minor movement may be as brief as a few hours or 
as long as three to four weeks. The minor movements are considered part 
and parcel of the primary or secondary movements themselves; because 
short-term market changes can be extremely deceiving, Dow theorists 
have a tendency to discount minor movements. 

Once he's identified the primary, secondary, and to a much lesser ex- 
tent the minor movements in the market, the Dow theorist is ready to be- 
gin assessing the market's long-term prospects. According to Rhea, if 
both averages stay within approximately 5 percent of their mean average 
for a period of two weeks or longer, the market is either accumulating 
(stock is being bought by expert investors who are bullish) or distributing 
(stock is being bought by potential speculators or odd-lotters who are 
bearish) . Dow Theory says that if the two averages go above the 5 per- 
cent mark, then the market should rise also. If the two averages go below 
the 5 percent mark, then Dow Theory predicts that the market will fall. 

Like many forms of analysis, Dow Theory uses volume movements 
to validate price movements. From a historical perspective, volume ex- 
pands when the market is bullish and rising, and contracts when the mar- 
ket is bearish and falling. If the opposite of what's expected occurs at any 
point in a primary or secondary movement, the Dow Theory signal says 
that the trend may soon reverse. 

In traditional Dow Theory, the only indication of trend reversal is a 
change in the price of the indexes themselves. If the market rallies and 
then falls, but does not fall below the highest price of the preceding rally, 
a Dow theorist interprets this as a bullish signal. Bearish signals are just 
the opposite— if the market is falling and its occasional rallies don't break 
through the bottom of an earlier decline, the Dow interpretation would 
be bearish. 

But how does a Dow theorist tell when the market is turning either 
bullish or bearish? Well, according to strict Dow Theory, if the market is 
rising and the trough of the last rally is above the trough of the preceding 
rally, the market is considered bullish. If the market is falling and the 
high point of a rally is below the trough of the last fall, then the market is 
considered bearish. The Dow theorist considers still other indicators to 
be important: the movements must have been at least one-third of the pri- 
mary movement, and the secondary movement should have had a life of 
at least three to four weeks. As always, volume information is valued as 
a source of other vital clues. 

The most important "rule" in Dow Theory is the correlation between 
the industrials average and the transportation average. For any Dow 
Theory analysis to be correct, the averages must have a 100 percent cor- 
relation; that is, they must either both be going up or both be coming

down. The fundamental reasoning here is simple: If the market is a per- 
fect barometer of business activity, then an increase in industrial activity 
(manufacturing) should stimulate a commensurate increase in the indus- 
tries that move raw materials and finished products (namely, the 
transportations). 

The market has probably been right as often as it has been wrong 
when used to predict overall economic or business activity, just as many 
of its prophets (the analysts) have. One valid criticism of Dow Theory is 
that it's often late in predicting rises or falls in the economy. Dow theo- 
rists have two ways of compensating for this weakness. They can use the 
earnings estimates of the major analysts to gauge the fiscal health of mar- 
ket participants, or they can use dividend yields for the same purpose. 

A corporation's dividends are declared by its board of directors. If 
these individuals are optimistic about the future of their business and 
have had a good quarter or year, they are likely to declare higher divi- 
dends (though they may do otherwise). And if things have not been going 
so well, a company's board of directors will usually decide to lower the 
dividend payout in order to conserve cash — but not always. Reasons for 
varying from the expected behavior normally have their roots in the ex- 
ecutive group's natural survival instinct. Shareholders often become dis- 
satisfied when dividends fall, and in order to keep investors happy, a 
company's board of directors may decide to pay higher dividends than 
their own judgment of the market situation might dictate. By the same to- 
ken, a company's decision makers might just decide to pay lesser divi- 
dends than it would appear they can afford. 

Adherents to Dow Theory usually consider a fall in excess of 3 per- 
cent in the dividend yield of the Dow industrial average a sign that a bear 
market may be on the way. If the dividend yields rise above 6 percent, 
Dow theorists usually anticipate a bull market. These readings must be 
confirmed by other indicators, however; used alone, they can be 
misleading. 

Other criticisms of Dow Theory stem from the effect government 
regulation has on industries, the imperfection of the market as an in- 
dicator of business activity, and the effects that outliers (companies that 
do not necessarily follow the overall trend) have on the indexes. Despite 
these criticisms, Dow Theory is still very much in use.

Winning on Wall Street is an integrated stock market package that 
consists of three distinct modules: one for data management, another for 
forecasting, and a third for accounting. These modules are available sep- 
arately or as a set and can be used either as standalone programs or as 
components of an integrated system. 

In this month's review section, we'll focus on the data management 
module, Trader's Data Manager. We'll finish our look at Winning on 
Wall Street next month, when we consider Trader's Forecaster and 
Trader's Accountant. 

Trader's Data Manager manages data, stores information for the 
forecasting system, and is capable of sharing information with the port- 
folio accounting system. In addition to its database capabilities, this pro- 
gram provides a variety of graphic analysis tools. 

The Data Manager can be used to store and track corporate and for- 
eign bonds, mutual funds, treasury notes, and equities. This flexible pro- 
gram can be used not only by individual investors but by stockbrokers, 
fund managers, and other investment professionals. Unlike investment- 
oriented programs that limit the type and amount of information that can 
be stored, Trader's Data Manager lets you define the information you 
want to store. It calls these pieces of information attributes. For each se- 
curity, you're allowed to store up to eighteen attributes, each of which 
can have up to 1,000 data points. You can enter daily, monthly, quar- 
terly, or yearly information. 

This system can retrieve information directly from Dow Jones 
News/Retrieval, or it can work with information the investor has input at 
the keyboard. 

Like the other Winning on Wall Street modules, Trader's Data Man- 
ager is menu-driven. From the main menu, the investor can create and 



modify stock files, enter stock data (via the keyboard;, convert data, 
download from Dow Jones, generate data reports, and create data 
graphs. The first step is to create a data file for the security you wish to 
track. Creating this file is easy; you just supply the information the pro- 
gram asks for, such as the stock's code (ticker symbol) and the name of 
the security. Once you've entered the necessary data, you can begin de- 
fining what information about the security you want to store. 

You're required to supply three characteristics for each piece of in- 
formation to be stored: the attribute code, the conversion type, and the 
storage type. The attribute code signifies the name of the type of infor- 
mation you're going to store (such as high, low, or close). The conver- 
sion type determines what information the system will capture when you 
update your files. Data Manager's conversion types are highest value, 
lowest value, closing value, total value, beginning value, and average 
value, each of which is entered by pressing the appropriate letter key. (In 
a traditional high, low, close volume setting, the conversion types you'd 
use would be H, L, C, and T respectively.) 

The storage type determines the format of the numeric information 
for each attribute and conversion type. The program can handle stock 
price values expressed as integers, volume information expressed in lots 
of 100, floating point values expressed as decimals, and integer values. 
If you intend to download from Dow Jones, you must make sure not only 
that a security's attributes, conversion, and storage types correspond to 
Dow Jones, but also that they match the information you want to capture. 

The investor can also define what the program calls relational attri- 
butes. Computed using information captured in other attributes, a rela- 
tional attribute may be either the ratio of two attributes to each other or 
the difference between the two attributes. For example, if you were in- 
terested in knowing the overall range of a security's price movements 
over a trading day, you could define a relational attribute that took the se- 
curity's high price and subtracted its low price from that figure. The re- 
sult would be placed in the relational attribute and used in any of the re- 
ports or graphs you asked the program to produce. Once a security file 
has been defined, you can add or delete an attribute or an entire file as 
necessary using utilities that are built right into the program. 

When you wish to enter data at the keyboard, the program entry 
screen requests the stock code (the name of the stock file), the starting 
date for the data entry, the time unit (daily, weekly, monthly), and a list 
of the attributes you'll be updating. To tell the program that you plan to 
update, just press return. 

The structure of the program's manual entry is unique — the data entry 
module lets you choose what information you want to update, thus saving 
you from having to skip over data fields you may not be using any 
more— and it is exceptionally well done. 

The program does not automatically save the data you've input to 
disk; instead, you must tell it to do so via a menu that appears when you 
leave the data entry screen. Your choices at this point are to continue 
data entry (returning to the same security), save the data, print it out to 
check it, or abort the session and return to the main menu. If you choose 
to save the data and there's not room on disk for all of it, an error mes- 
sage will appear and you'll need to insert a new disk. The amount of in- 
formation you can store is determined by the number of attributes you 
use and by the time period of the information you wish to capture. 

It's important to remember that no matter how you set up your data- 
base, you can't store more than 1,000 data points per attribute. Another 
point to consider when you're setting up your stock files: Trader's Data 
Manager can only analyze securities that reside on the same disk; you 
can't print out a report or chart on two different securities that reside on 
two different disks. While the vast majority of investors won't find this a 
problem, some investors— specifically those who do both inter- and 
intra-industry analysis — may find that they have to copy some data files 
from one disk to another. This is easy to do using the program included 
in the Data Manager. 

If you plan to use Dow Jones News/Retrieval to update your security 
files, you'll need to include the stock exchange codes required by Dow 
Jones in the stock codes and the Dow Jones symbolic annotations in the 
security codes. You'll find these in the Dow Jones documentation, as 
well as in The Trader's Data Manager manual. 

The program connects you to Dow Jones automatically, using the in- 
formation you supplied when you configured the system. Once con- 
nected, you'll be prompted for the security code and the starting and end- 
ing dates for which you want to retrieve information. Unfortunately, you

must repeat this process for each security you update. A setup procedure 
through which the investor could simply indicate which securities should 
be updated, and the relevant dates, would be a welcome addition to the 
program. Once the user had logged on, the needed information would be 
fetched automatically, eliminating the very real possibility of incurring 
connect time charges from Dow Jones when the system is idle. Also, if 
such a facility were implemented, the investor could be prompted to 
change disks when necessary to update files stored on disks other than 
the one currently in the drive. 

Output from Trader's Data Manager takes two forms: reports that 
show the structure and content of the database, and graphic analysis of 
the information stored there. Let's look first at the reports. 

The stock data report lists the attributes and their values for a given 
security. Up to three attributes can be displayed on-screen at the same 
time, and up to seven may be printed out. You control the attributes in- 
cluded in a report, the time period covered, and the time units employed. 
The program then goes through the security file and produces the report 
based on the user's specifications. 

The attribute comparison report follows much the same procedure. 
The only difference in setting up this report is that rather than supply the 
attribute codes for the same security, you input the stock codes of dif- 
ferent securities along with one attribute code. The report that results 
provides a comparison of the different securities selected in terms of that 
attribute. A report showing the closing prices of Apple, IBM, and Com- 
paq stock is an example of an attribute comparison report. 

The stock summary report lists all the securities on the disk, along 
with their respective attribute codes, conversion types, and storage 
types. It illustrates the internal structure of the program's database and is 
used by the program as a roadmap for creating the other reports and 
graphs. 

The graphic analysis portion of Trader 's Data Manager consists of 
four types of graphs: high/low/close versus volume graphs, attribute ver- 
sus volume graphs, attribute comparison graphs, and single-attribute 



graphs. Examples of each type appear in the accompanying figure. 

Any of the four graph types may be further analyzed or manipulated 
using the commands that appear at the bottom of the screen. This is done 
by activating a vertical cursor called a wand. The wand is moved over 
the graph using the left and right arrow keys. Placing the wand over a 
data point displays the underlying data values on-screen. Horizontal lines 
(representing thresholds, averages, or whatever) and the vertical scale of 
the graph may be changed to suit your needs or taste. To erase all the 
lines that have been constructed on the graph so you can begin a new 
analysis, simply press E for erase. 

The other two commands available are used for printing out data val- 
ues or plotting the graph. Data values can be printed on almost any type 
of printer, while the graph can only be printed on a printer that's com- 
patible with the Grappler interface or that has a grappler-compatible in- 
terface card. 

The data conversion program is used for maintenance reasons (file 
cleanup) or for changing the presentation of reports. This program con- 
verts daily security information into weekly, monthly, quarterly, or 
yearly information, based on the amount of information available. The 
investor may delete or save the daily information once the conversions 
are done. 

Because of this program's one-disk orientation, it can be difficult to 
track files stored on different disks. It's not always easy to remember 
what stock is where, when it was last updated, and what information 
about it is stored where. A minidatabase that kept track of these facts 
and produced a consolidated report on all the stock files would be a valu- 
able enhancement to the program. 

The real strength of this program is not readily apparent. Its reporting 
and charting capabilities are very strong, but the package is really de- 
signed for use with the other two Winning on Wall Street modules, which 
we'll evaluate next time. Nonetheless, on a standalone basis, Trader's 
Data Manager meets or exceeds the error-checking, ease-of-use, and 
performance standards we've set forth in previous columns. !■

Welcome to SoftCard Symposium for the month of March. We're 
still in the process of discussing the BDOS disk I/O functions. The re- 
maining functions to be dealt with are those related to the handling of 
disk files. Before we look at those functions, however, we're going to 
take a short break. While we've spent considerable time in past columns 
discussing disk I/O, we haven't presented a thorough examination of 
disk file structure. Our goal this month, therefore, will be to present the 
most complete picture we can of this somewhat complex topic. We will 
wait until next time to discuss the remaining BDOS functions and to up- 
date our subroutine library. 

A disk file is a relatively simple concept— nothing more than a series 
of disk sectors containing related data. Unfortunately, like most things in 
life, disk files become more complex as you move from concept to prac- 
tice. In practice, the disk operating system that controls and accesses the 
files must construct every file in such a way that all the various actions a 
user might wish to perform can be accomplished safely and with relative 
ease and speed. 

For the disk operating system to perform in this manner, a disk file's 
content and structure must be rigorously controlled. In addition, the sys- 
tem must have considerable information on each file it creates or ac- 
cesses so that it can keep very close track of the files' current status and 
condition. Finally, the system must require any program that is to be 
used for accessing files to supply specific information in a known 
format— a specific protocol— so that access is allowed only when certain 
conditions have been met. This is where the complexity is introduced. 

In CP/M, all files have the same low-level structure; that is to say, all 
files are collections of logical disk sectors, with each sector containing 
128 bytes worth of values ranging from 0 to 255. As a result, BDOS can 
treat all files the same, regardless of the type of operation the user wishes 
to perform. This does not run contradictory to the fact that files may be 
of different kinds (random, sequential, transient command, and so on). 
Rather, different kinds of files can be said to have a different high-level 
structure; that is, the organization of the data elements they contain dif- 
fers. This difference between low- and high-level structure is an impor- 
tant concept. 

Low-level structure deals with the actual storage of data on the disk 
media and is the responsibility of the operating system (BDOS), while 
high-level structure deals with the specific byte-value content of the file 
and is the responsibility of the utility or applications program (Basic, 
WordStar, and so on). Never is the operating system concerned with 
the contents of a file, nor does the applications program care how the file 
is stored on disk. Each leaves the other's area alone. 

Some of you will be quick to point out the existence of both random 
and sequential access functions within BDOS. This would seem to in- 
dicate two types of disk files from BDOS's standpoint. The difference, 
however, is simply in the method used to obtain or store data within 
files— there might not be any difference in the files themselves. Identical 
files can be created with both access methods, allowing randomly created 
files to be accessed sequentially, and vice versa. 

There are one or two cases where individual differences can occur, 
the primary one being unallocated "holes" in the middle of random 
files. These differences are a result of the rules governing each access 
method, however, and do not concern the general file structure. The im- 
portant thing to remember is that BDOS treats all files the same, altering 
only the method of access as specified by the programmer. 

Since operating systems and applications programs do not involve 



CIS 



themselves in each other's areas, there must be some common ground on 
the basis of which the two can communicate. This shared protocol, 
alluded to earlier, takes the form of a data structure that must be used and 
altered by both entities during disk file operations. The data structure is 
called the file control block, or FCB. An FCB must be presented by the 
applications program any time a file (or group of files) is referenced. An 
example of the FCB data structure is shown in the accompanying figure. 
We will refer to it throughout this discussion. 

At first glance, this figure should look familiar to those of you 
who've been readers of this column for a while. In the July 1983 column, 
we discussed the arrangement of the disk directory-entry data structure; 
and the file control block and the directory entry are nearly identical. 
There is good reason for this, since the directory entry for a file is ac- 
tually a modified version of the FCB used to create it. 

The first FCB field is DR— identified in the chart as the drive number 
of the drive containing the file. Its true name is drive specification, and it 
is the means by which the program informs BDOS of the system drive to 
access. Although you're not communicating with BDOS when you type 
at the keyboard or read the screen, you have used and seen the drive 
specification often. During filename entry and display using the CCP or 
utility programs, the drive specification always precedes the filename 
and filetype. 

In these cases, the drive specification is some alphabetic character 
from A through P that represents one of the sixteen possible drives in a 
CP/M system. Since only six drives are allowed in SoftCard CP/M, only 
the letters A through F are recognized as valid when SoftCard is used. 
The alphabetic drive specifications you have used in the past have always

consisted of two characters— the drive letter and a colon (:). The colon is 
used as a delimiter (separator) to signify that the character preceding it is 
a drive and not the first character of the filename. 

Since we called it a drive number in our figure, you might suspect 
that the drive specification is not used by BDOS in exactly the same way 
as it is input to or displayed by the CCP or by utility programs. You 
would be right. Since the FCB is structured in a rigid manner, and since 
the drive specification must always be the first byte, BDOS has no need 
of the colon/delimiter to separate the drive specification from the 
filename. Further, BDOS does not use the drive specification in its 
ASCII form. The drive specification that BDOS requires is a number in 
the range 0 through 16 (0 through 6 in SoftCard CP/M). 

In either case (6 or 16), the range of numbers allowed is one more 
than the number of drives allowed. The difference here is the possible 
drive specification of 0. Numbers 1 through 6 represent drives A through 
F, with A being 1, B being 2, and so on. When a 0 is placed in the DR 
field, the program is informing BDOS that the drive to use is the current- 
ly logged drive and that file access can start immediately using the drive 
number BDOS keeps internally. When any other number is used, a disk 
select function is automatically done on that drive by BDOS, the re- 
quested operation is performed, and the old, currently logged drive is re- 
selected. This process is known as auto drive select. 

Obviously, then, there are two ways to access a disk. One way is to 
select the correct disk using the BDOS disk select function and then to 
access the file with an FCB drive specification of 0. The alternate 
method— one that saves you considerable space in your programs and in 
the time spent writing them — is to leave the currently logged drive se- 
lected and use the drive number containing the file in the FCB. This auto 
drive select is considerably easier to use than the other method 
we mentioned. 

Now we can point out the first difference between the FCB and the 
directory entry. The directory entry field corresponding to DR does not 
represent a drive number. Obviously, since floppy disks may be placed 
in any drive, keeping such information would be pointless. Instead, this 
field in the directory entry is either an 0E5H byte, meaning that this 
thirty-two-byte entry is vacant, or it is some number from 0 to 15 and 
represents the user number in which the file is contained. Remember that 
each disk directory can have files in any of sixteen different user areas. 

The next two fields of the FCB are shown as Fl through F8 and Tl 
through T3. Together, these two fields are called the file reference. The 
file reference is the means by which BDOS identifies a specific file on 
the indicated disk. File references can either be unambiguous, meaning 
that they refer to one and only one specific file, or ambiguous, meaning 
that they reference all files in a particular group. Since the two types of 
file reference are so similar, we'll examine unambiguous references first 
and then discuss how ambiguous references differ from them. 

A file reference is actually made up of two distinct parts: the primary 
filename (or simply filename) and the filetype (sometimes called the ex- 
tension). The arrangement is always filename (F1-F8) first, followed by 
filetype (T1-T3). If it helps, you may want to think of the filetype as a 
group identifier and the filename as a specific identifier. There even ex- 
ists a sort of arbitrary grouping wherein specific filetypes usually indi- 
cate particular kinds of files— COM is used to indicate transient com- 
mand files, BAS to indicate Basic files, and so on. These groupings, 
however, are for the convenience of humans and have nothing to do with 
how BDOS internally views the files. With the exception of COM, they 
are not universally in use, so it's unwise to rely completely on this meth- 
od of grouping in every situation. 

Contrary to what you may have seen in using CP/M, BDOS always 
requires that the primary filename be eight characters long and that the 
filetype be three characters long. The figure shows this to be true, since 
there are precisely that number of character positions that must be used. 
Most programs that access BDOS (including the CCP and CP/M 
utilities) do not require you to make your file references match this 
"eight and three" format and fill in unused character positions with 
spaces. For convenience, these programs automatically place spaces in 
any unused positions. 

To accomplish this, however, a program must be able to examine the 
input of the person using it and know where the filename stops and the 
file type starts. This is accomplished in CP/M via another delimiter, 
the period (.). The following examples show how a person might type 
several file references for a program, and how that program would alter 



them before transmitting them to BDOS. For clarity, spaces are shown 

as iinHerlinpv 



as underlines.

Since using the disk functions means that we're communicating 
directly with BDOS, we must begin to view the file reference and other 
file information as BDOS needs to see it. As we proceed, what BDOS 
needs to see will be pointed out and contrasted with the familiar format. 

As our recent examples indicate, the period is not used at all by 
BDOS and must not be included in any file reference given to it. Ir- 
respective of all our talk of filenames and filetypes, it is apparent from 
the figure and the examples that BDOS simply uses an eleven-character 
file reference internally and does not differentiate between filename and 
filetype. The eleven characters may be any members of the printable 
ASCII character set, with the exception of the following reserved 
characters: 

<>.,;:=?*[]_%!/«' 

All of what we have learned so far about unambiguous file references 
applies to the ambiguous ones as well. In addition to the characters 
allowed in unambiguous references, however, two additional characters 
are allowed in ambiguous ones when communicating with the CCP and 
programs: the question mark (?) and the asterisk (*). Only the question 
mark is used when dealing directly with BDOS, as we will be doing. The 
asterisk is simply translated by the CCP or program into a series of ques- 
tion marks for BDOS. When the CCP, for example, receives the file 
reference ACC*.DAT, it translates that into ACC?????.DAT before 
communicating with BDOS. When asterisks are used, they must be the 
last character in the filename or filetype field. 

The question mark is used by BDOS as a wildcard character. Such a 
character in a file-reference position will match any character in the cor- 
responding position within a directory entry filename or filetype. This 
makes it possible for the user to identify all the COM files in a disk direc- 
tory using the file reference ????????COM or all the ACCOUNTx.DAT 
files (x being any character) using ACCOUNT7DAT. The wildcard 
feature is most often used when one is searching the disk directory for a 
given set of files. The file reference ??????????? will match with any 
filename allowed in CP/M. When a file reference match is made in the 
disk directory and an open file operation is peformed, BDOS copies the 
correct characters from the directory to the FCB. 

Ordinarily, all the characters used in an FCB file reference will have 
their parity bits reset (bit 7 equals to 0). In two cases, however, the parity 
bit becomes a flag to indicate certain attributes of the file being 
referenced. These two cases are the first and second filetype characters, 
Tl and T2. 

The Tl position is used to indicate either read-write (R/W) or read- 
only (R/O) status for a file. Last month, we saw that an entire disk can be 
set to R/O status by BDOS to prevent any writes on that disk. This same 
approach can also be used when dealing with individual files, and BDOS 
will reject any attempts to erase, rename, or write on any such file. Us- 
ing the STAT.COM program (or one of the disk functions we'll be ex- 
amining), any file may be changed to R/O or R/W status on a semiperm- 
anent basis. In such a case, the actual directory entry on the disk is 
altered to reflect this new condition. The condition remains in effect until 
it is altered again using STAT. To make a file R/O, the parity bit of the 
first filetype character is set (made equal to one). To make it R/W again, 
the parity bit is reset. 

The parity bit of the second filetype character is used to reflect the 
DIR/SYS attribute. Files are either directory (DIR) files or system (SYS) 
files, with DIR being the default condition. Giving a file SYS status 
means that it will not be displayed on the screen during directory listings 
and that PIP (and many other utilities) won't access the file without spe- 
cial instructions. By and large, the file is still available through the CCP 
for its built-in commands (ERA and so on), and if it is a COM file it can 
still be executed, but most utilities will simply not see it. The alternate 
DIR status means that the file is always displayed during directory 
listings, may be copied by PIP, and is visible to most utilities. A file is 
made SYS by setting the parity bit of the T2 position; it is made DIR by

resetting the parity bit in that position. 

There is no attribute association for the third filetype position (T3) or 
for any of the filename positions (F1-F8). Digital Research originally re- 
served the F5 through F8 and the T3 parity bits for possible future attrib- 
ute definitions of their own. The first four (F1-F4) were left for the user 
to define, if desired, and are not used in any way by BDOS. Since CP/M 
2.2 has now been replaced by Digital Research with CP/M Plus (CP/M 
3.*), it is unlikely that 2.2 will be updated to define uses for these bits. 

Irrespective of this, we've seen that there is always a three-character 
filetype regardless of whether or not the programmer or user specified 
any characters for it when the file was created— the filetype being three 
spaces as a default. Since the filetype always exists, the file attribute 
flags always exist as well, and this must be taken into account when 
manipulating files through BDOS system calls. If you wish to access both 
SYS and DIR files, for example, always set the parity bit in byte 2 of the 
filetype. Similarly, be sure to check for the presence of R/O files when 
writing to disk, so that you do not mistake the type of error received 
should your program attempt to write to such a file. 

The next field, EX, is the extent field. As we saw in our discussions 
of the directory entry last July, all files are divided into some number of 
16K extents. (Since most files are less than 16K, this number is usually 
only one.) The EX field specifies which extent of the file the program- 
mer wishes BDOS to access. The values it contains range from 0 to 31, 
the highest possible extent number. 

In a way, extents themselves are like individual files. Each has its 
own directory entry on the disk. Whenever a specific extent of a file is 
being accessed, the FCB must show that particular extent number. Ex- 
tents must be opened before they can be accessed. Although we'll be 
discussing the open operation in detail next month, we'll say for now that 
it is the process of informing BDOS of the extent to be accessed, allow- 
ing BDOS to validate the FCB by verifying that the extent exists and then 
filling in any information needed from the disk directory. This will 
become more important as we examine the disk functions next month. 

The S 1 field that follows EX contains a value that BDOS uses inter- 
nally. This value is never accessed by the programmer, and seldom even 
by BDOS. For this reason, we'll ignore it. 

The next field, DM, is the data module number of the file that BDOS 
is to access. The data module, like the extent, is another unit of file 
space — in this case 512K. Since a data module is made up of thirty-two 
16K extents, there can be only sixteen data modules in the largest file that 
BDOS can access (eight megabytes). Therefore, the value of DM may 
range from 0 to 15. For our purposes in SoftCard CP/M, this field will 
always be 0. Out of safety considerations, this field should be 
specifically set to 0 by your program before disk functions are requested, 
even though BDOS does so automatically during some of them. If this is 
not done, you may get inaccurate results. 

The next field is RC, short for record count. Just as in the direc- 
tory entry, this field is the total number of records contained in this ex- 
tent. Since an extent is 16K maximum, and since records are 128 bytes 
long, up to 128 records may be contained in the extent. This value there- 
fore will range from 0 (for an empty extent) to 128 (for a full one). It will 
be copies from the directory entry to the FCB during any open operation 
and will be updated during file writes as new records are added. 

The last four fields we've discussed (EX, SI , DM, and RC) should be 
set to 0 during the creation of any FCB. While this is not specifically re- 
quired in all cases, it is the safest way. For the most part, the remainder 
of the FCB (bytes 16 through 35) can be left containing any value without 
fear of trouble. One or two exceptions to this rule of thumb exist, and we 
will point these out when we come to the functions in question. 

The field following RC is sixteen bytes long and shown as BA 
through BP. Its actual name is the block list. This field lists the disk 
blocks that have been allocated to this extent of the file. During our many 
past discussions, we have seen that CP/M disks are divided into 1, 2, 4, 
8, or 16K blocks— the actual block size being chosen by the BIOS 
designer— and that SoftCard disks have a block size of IK. The block 
list, therefore, can list up to sixteen SoftCard block numbers. 

Since blocks are numbered sequentially from the first sector of the 
directory to the last sector of the disk, BDOS can use these numbers to 
calculate track and sector. The block list is the means by which BDOS 
can locate actual records on the disk during file I/O. This field is filled in 
by BDOS from the disk directory when the first file access is made using 
the appropriate FCB (assuming, of course, that the file is found). 



So far, the FCB and directory entry are practically identical. In fact, 
BDOS uses an FCB to copy directory entry information into and out of 
memory during some file operations, such as open file and close file. It is 
also apparent that the portion of the FCB presented so far is a sort of disk 
address for a portion of the file, showing which drive the file is on, the 
file reference and attributes, the file's extent, its data module, and the 
record count and data blocks occupied on disk for this extent. 

Those first thirty-two bytes form a basic FCB. The programmer al- 
ways supplies the DR, F1-F8, T1-T3, EX, and DM fields to inform 
BDOS of the specific drive, file (or group of files), data module, and ex- 
tent requested. BDOS responds to the first function request (usually the 
open file function) by attempting to find the file in the directory. If suc- 
cessful, BDOS completes the FCB by filling in the RC and BA-BP fields 
from the directory entry. This is the process of opening a file (an extent). 

The first thirty-two bytes are all that's really needed for the majority 
of operations — to make file, close file, open file, find file, and so on. The 
read and write operations, however, since they deal with specific rec- 
ords, require that BDOS be informed of the record requested. This is 
done using the CR and RL-RH fields. 

The CR and RL-RH fields are used to access individual records from 
the file in sequential access mode and random access mode, respectively. 
These two terms, random and sequential, must be fully understood. Se- 
quential access of a file is the reading or writing of file records one after 
another, usually from the beginning of the file. Random access, on the 
other hand, simply means to read or write file records in any sequence 
whatsoever. 

The CR field is used for sequential access. It specifies the record 
number to be read or written from the current extent (the extent whose 
number appears in the EX field of the FCB). Since sequential access is 
normally performed starting with the beginning of the file, the CR field 
is usually set to 0 by the program just prior to the first read or write func- 
tion call. 

From that point on, BDOS takes care of incrementing CR after each 
successful read or write operation, and of moving to the next extent (fin- 
ding the new extent in the directory and changing the EX, RC and BA-

BP fields) when CR exceeds the maximum record value for the previous 
extent. Note that RC is a count ranging from 1 to 128, while CR is a rec- 
ord number ranging from 0 to 127. Consequently, BDOS is able to tell 
that the highest record has already been read when it increments CR and 
finds that it has become equal to RC. 

The process referred to a moment ago as "moving to the next extent" 
actually involves several separate operations. First, the current extent is 
closed (updating that extent's directory entry). Then the EX value is 
changed in the FCB and the new extent searched for. If it is found, the 
new extent is then opened .(copying the new extent's information from 
the directory entry to the FCB). All these operations can be performed 
using the BDOS file functions. If the programmer chooses to control 
them all manually in this fashion, CR can be used to read and write the 
file in something similar to random access mode. 

BDOS will, in fact, read or write any record number (CR) from any 
numbered extent (EX), provided that the FCB was activated with an open 
file or make file call using that extent number. It is easier, however, to 
use the RL-RH field and the random access mode for this purpose. 

During random access, the programmer opens the file (or creates it) 
with EX set to 0. Then a random record number between 0 and 65535 is 
selected to be read or written. This is placed in the RL and RM positions. 
These stand for random record number low-order byte and random rec- 
ord number middle-order byte, respectively. The high-order byte (RH) 
is seldom used, since all record numbers allowed (0 through 65535) can 
be represented entirely in two bytes. BDOS does use RH during file size 
calculations, but it is never used during normal file I/O operations. 

The two-byte random record number is stored in RL and RM, low 
byte first and high byte last. RH must be set to 0 and must remain 0, or 
an error will result. Once all this has been accomplished, the random 
read or write system call is selected, and BDOS then determines the 
proper extent to use, sets EX to that value, opens that extent, calculates 
the CR value within that extent that is equivalent to RL-RM and, finally, 
reads or writes the record. 

Note that BDOS places the correct extent number and current sequen- 
tial record number into the EX and CR fields before performing the

read/write operation. Obviously, then, BDOS accesses all files using the 
EX and CR values and can be said to do all of its access sequentially, us- 
ing RL-RH for calculation purposes only. Unlike normal sequential ac- 
cess, however, BDOS does not automatically increment RL-RH or the 
EX and CR fields if the operation is completed successfully. We'll 
elaborate next month when we get to the functions themselves. 

This completes our discussion of the FCB's internal structure. There 
are, however, one or two more points to be made. First of all, the FCB 
can be anywhere in memory. This is because its address will be passed to 
BDOS during the function call in the [DE] register pair. Even so, there is 
a default area in memory for a single FCB. This area is in the system data 
page at location 005CH and extends for thirty-six bytes through location 
005FH. The system and most CP/M utilities use this default FCB area 
for all file operations in the system. It is fairly well protected, and 
because of this many programmers use it in their own programs. 

The default FCB area is also used by the CCP for setting up initial 
FCBs in response to commands typed at the console. For example, when 
using STAT to check the size of the file ACCOUNT.DAT in the default 
FCB area at 005CH. It would appear as follows in DDT format: 

005C: 02 41 43 43 4F 55 4E 54 20 44 41 54 00 00 00 00 .ACCOUNT DAT.... 

006C: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 

As you can see, all fields except DR and F1-T3 have been initialized 
to 0. (Note that if no drive specification had been typed, the DR field 
would also be 0 to indicate the currently logged drive). The FCB built 
by the CCP is sufficient to create, open, or search for the file, and it can 
be used as is for these purposes. It is up to the designer of the program 
(STAT or whatever) to supply any further information that may be 
needed for additional operations. 

In certain cases, two files are entered at the console. One such case is 
the PIP command: 

PIP B:ACCOUNT.BAK = AACCOUNT.DAT 

In this event, the CCP creates the important parts of two FCBs in the de- 
fault FCB area as follows: 

005C: 02 41 43 43 4F 55 4E 54 20 42 41 4B 00 00 00 00 . ACCOUNT BAK 

006C: 01 41 43 43 4F 55 4E 54 20 44 41 54 00 00 00 00 .ACCOUNT DAT.... 

As you can see, the second FCB occupies the block list field of the 
first FCB. Because of this, the FCBs cannot be used as they are. The 
one exception is the rename operation, which will be identified when 
we discuss function 23 next month. For all other operations, the par- 
tial FCB at 006CH must be moved to some other area before file opera- 
tions commence. The CCP's actions in creating FCBs from input can 
be handy when you're designing utility programs that act on other files. 

One additional note: Besides creating the FCBs at the default loca- 
tion, the CCP places the number of characters and the actual characters 
themselves, typed by the user, in the default buffer at 0080H for access 
by your program if needed. Neither the count nor the input includes the 
transient command filename (PIP, for example), but they both include 
the space between the transient command and the files to be acted upon. 
For our recent example using PIP, there were twenty-eight characters 
typed. In that case, the CCP would leave the default buffer as follows: 

0080: 1C 20 42 3A 41 43 43 4F 55 4E 54 2E 42 41 4B 3D . Bs ACCOUNT. BAK* 
0090: 41 3A 41 43 43 4F 55 4E 54 2E 44 41 54 00 00 00 A: ACCOUNT. DAT. . . 

The 1CH value at 0080H is the number 28, representing the number 
of characters typed. Following that is a space (20H), which is the space 
typed by the user between the command (PIP) and the first character of 
the files to be operated on (B). Following the space are the remaining 
twenty-seven characters of user input. This facility of the CCP can be 
employed by your programs to capture and act on any user input follow- 
ing the transient-command name used to invoke your program. It is 
especially useful when you wish the user to enter input other than file 
references, since the CCP may not correctly copy such information into 
the default FCB. 

This completes our discussion of file structure and the data elements 
used when programs communicate with BDOS. We're now in a position 
to discuss the file-handling disk I/O functions. Next month we'll begin 
by introducing these functions and go on to explain their operation and 
use. At that time we'll also present the final version of our subroutine li- 
brary. Until next month. ...

String Along with VAL 



In the opening of last month's column, we suggested that you test out 
your sort routines with a "few hundred randomly created 'words,' " but 
neglected to show you how to create random words. This month we offer 
reparations and apologies to those who care. 

ASC and You Shall Receive. The task of creating random words, 
along with a slew of more useful tasks, is made easier by knowing Ap- 
plesoft's single-character commands. Two of Applesoft's single- 
character commands are string functions: one called ASC, which trans- 
lates a single-character string into a number, and one called CHR$, 
which translates a number into a single-character string. 

ASC is pronounced the same as "ask." It is short for ASCII ("ask- 
ee"), which stands for American Standard Code for Information Inter- 
change. The ASCII code is the system of numbers most computers use 
internally to represent printed characters. All a computer knows, inside, 
is numbers. In order to deal with characters, it has to have a set of num- 
bers to substitute for those characters in its memory. Those same num- 
bers can be used for other things as well; a computer's programs know 
from context when a number represents a character. 

CHR$, which is pronounced "character string," also uses the ASCII 
code. The ASC function uses a string expression for its argument and re- 
turns that string's ASCII number. If the string is more than one character 
long, the number returned is the ASCII code for the first character. 
CHR$ uses a numeric expression for its argument and returns a single- 
character string. 

As functions, ASC and CHR$ can also act as expressions. ASC can 
be used wherever a numeric expression is called for, and CHR$ can be 
used wherever a string expression is called for. All of the following 
statements are legal uses of CHR$ and ASC:

Figure 1. ASCII code groups. 



If you ever need to know a character's ASCII value, or if you want to 
find out what character is associated with a known value but don't want 
to look it up, you can always ask the computer. To see how, type either 
of these commands in immediate mode (that is, without a line number): 



A$ = "&":X = ASC(A$) 
E$ = CHR$(27) 
FOR C = 1 TO ASC("A") 
PRINT CHR$( ASC("Gorilla")) 



To make use of these commands, you have to be familiar with the 
ASCII code. Nearly every computer programming manual has an ASCII 
code chart, so we won't include a full one here. However, figure 1 shows 
the general groupings of characters in the ASCII code. If you have either 
the II Plus or the lie version of the Applesoft manuals, you should be- 
come familiar with the ASCII tables they include. The ASCII values are 
given in decimal and hexadecimal. For Basic use, you can ignore the hex 
column. The charts are on pages 138 and 139 of the old manual and 
pages 241 through 244 of volume 2 of the new manual. These charts 
could end up being the most-often-used pages in your computer library. 



PRINT ASC("M") 
PRINT CHR$(122) 

You Can't Always Get What You Want. Notice that not all of the 

characters in the code are printing characters. CHR$(0) through 
CHR$(31) are control characters, which are typed by holding down the 
control key and hitting another key. These don't print anything on the 
screen, but a few of them have special significance. CHR$(13) is the 
code the computer sees when you hit the return key. Printing it adds 
nothing to the screen, but it moves the cursor to the beginning of the next 
line. The four arrow keys and escape are also control characters. 

You can't see these characters, but your computer can if you type 
them. Even a Basic program can recognize and act on these invisible 
characters. Basic can read a single keypress with the get command. Get 
is like input except that it takes only one character; it doesn't wait for you 



186 




to hit return, and it doesn't print that character on the screen. That makes 
it useful for writing input routines. It also makes it useful for examining 
ASCII character codes. This program will accept key presses and print 
out the codes associated with the keys pressed: 

10 GET KEYS 

20 CODE = ASC(KEY$) 

30 PRINT CODE; "("; CHR$(CODE); ")" 

40 GOTO 10 

No Codes from Shifty Keys. You'll see when you run this program 
that get takes anything as input, even control-C. Assuming that you're 
fast enough to type control-C in the milliseconds that the Apple takes to 
execute lines 20 through 40, you can use this method to break out of the 
program. If not, reset will still work. The reset key (actually, control- 
reset on most Apples) doesn't generate a character code. Instead, it sends 
a signal directly to the Apple's microprocessor that says, "Stop what 
you're doing." (Sometimes, of course, the microprocessor will have 
been programmed not to listen.) 

The control and shift keys don't generate codes either. Rather, they 
change the code generated by other, simultaneous keypresses. That's 
why capital letters and lower-case letters have different codes. On the 
Apple lie, the caps-lock key does the same thing. The open-apple and 
closed-apple keys on the lie don't generate or even help to generate any 
codes. They make the computer think its paddle or joystick buttons have 
been pressed, even if no paddle or joystick is plugged in. We'll go into 
how these keys work at another time. For now, it's sufficient to know 
that they take an entirely different input path: get ignores them and they 
produce no ASCII code. 

Now, for those who really want to try out your sort routines (from the 
January column) without typing in five hundred words to sort, here is a 
random-word generator. This routine creates a word of random length 
from random capital letters and returns it in the variable W$: 

100 REM random word generator 
110 W$ = "": REM empty the string 
120 L = INT( RND(1) * 4) + 4:REM 

length of word will be 4 to 7 letters 
130 FOR C = 1 TO L 

140 W$ = W$ + CHR$( INT( RND(1) * 26) + 65): REM 

concatenate a random capital letter 
150 NEXT C 

160 PRINT W$: REM optional 
170 RETURN 

Now let's do something a bit more useful. Similar commands and 
methods to those used in the random-word generator can be used to 
create a variety of neat input routines. 

Surpassing the Standard. You might ask, what's wrong with using 
the input statement? The answer is that the input statement is good for 
some things but not for others. It allows too many ways for a user to 
make mistakes. For instance, if the user backspaces too far, the cursor 
moves down a line from the input prompt. Applesoft is still waiting for 
input, but it can be disorienting for the user to have the cursor separated 
from the prompt. Some programs depend on a carefully laid-out screen 
where certain readouts appear in certain places (look at any spreadsheet). 
Using the input command in such a program could mess up the display 
by scrolling the screen or accepting input of a line that's too long. 

Another problem with input is that it doesn't take commas. If you 
want to type, "To be, or not to be, " you would get an extra ignored mes- 
sage and the computer would have gotten only "To be. " That's a heck of 
a way to treat Shakespeare. 

Furthermore, with a custom-designed input routine, you can do all 
kinds of fancy stuff like limit the length of the input, limit the characters 
allowed, turn backspace into a true destructive delete key, and even 
allow the insertion of characters into the middle of a string. Of course, 
we'll start with the simplest form of the routine and build from there, in 
true hacker form. 

For the simplest-case input routine, we want a closed loop that will 
take a character and process it. First, it should check to see if the 
character is a control character. If it is, the routine should see if it's ei- 
ther a return or a backspace, the only control characters we'll pay atten- 
tion to for now. If the character is a printable one, the routine will print 
it and add it to the string. Any character that is neither a printable char- 



J A L K MARCH 1984 

acter nor a backspace or return will be ignored. 

Figure 2 shows a flow chart for this algorithm. It may look a little 
complicated, but if we take things one step at a time, it shouldn't be too 
hard. Let's start with the easy path — the one that goes straight down from 
the top of the chart. This is the section of the routine that handles charac- 
ters that can be printed and added to the string. Here goes: 

100 REM input routine using get 
110 W$ = "": REM this clears W$ 
120 GET K$ 

130 IF ASC(K$) < 32 THEN 200: REM we'll deal with this later 
140 W$ = W$ + K$ 
150 PRINT K$; 
160 GOTO 120 

That part is pretty easy. It works, too, as long as you don't hit return, 
an arrow key, escape, or any other control character. That's the secret to 
writing long, complicated programs: write them one piece — one short, 
simple, working piece— at a time. Now let's do the backspace part, 
which, by itself, is also pretty simple: 

200 IF ASC(K$) <> 8 THEN 300: REM 8 is backspace 
210 IF W$ = '"' THEN 120 

You may wonder about the need for line 210. It's there for two reasons: 
first, to prevent the routine from backspacing to a point before the begin- 
ning of the word, which is one of the problems with the input command; 
and second, to prevent an error message. Remember, the next step is to 
remove the rightmost character from W$, and if W$ has no characters at 
the time, Applesoft will get upset with you. To continue: 

220 W$ = LEFT$(W$,LEN(W$)-1) 

This removes the last character from the string being built in memory. It 
works by replacing the whole string with the string's leftmost N — 1 
characters, where N is the number of characters in the string. 

230 PRINT K$;" ";K$ 

This step backs up the cursor one space (remember that K$ holds the 
backspace character at this point in the routine), prints a space over the 
character in that location (moving the cursor forward to its original posi- 
tion), and backs up the cursor one space to where it should be now. The 
space is necessary because the backspace character just moves the cur- 
sor; it doesn't erase the characters on the screen. 

240 GOTO 120 

Line 240 creates a loop. 

Check to see that the routine works. It should now respond correctly 
to the backspace key, right? 

Actually, no. Type a word, then backspace over it. When you try to 
delete the first character you typed, you get an illegal quantity error mes- 
sage in line 220. Aha! The problem is that when the length of W$ is 1, 
LEN(W$) - 1 (the second argument of the LEFT$ function) becomes 
zero. LEFTS doesn't know what to do with zero here, so it panics. The 
routine needs another special condition. This line should do it: 

215 IF LEN(W$) = 1 THEN W$ = "": GOTO 230 

Now we can consider the case in which the character typed is return, 
which is the simplest case of all. 

300 IF ASC(K$) <> 13 THEN 400: REM 13 is return 
310 RETURN 
400 GOTO 120 

To avoid getting a return without gosub error, test the routine by calling 
it with this line: 

10 GOSUB 100: IN$ = W$: PRINT INS: END 

There— now we have the working, simplest-case, input subroutine. You 
can put this in your program once, gosub to it whenever you want the

user to type something in, then set the variable you wanted to fill to W$. 
The old command: 

INPUT "Type in your name: "; NAMES 

is now replaced with: 

PRINT "Type in your name: ";: GOSUB 100:NAME$ = W$ 

The new form is a little longer, but it works a little better— it isn't 
subject to the peculiarities of the input command — and it can be custom- 
ized. It can be used with numeric input as well as string input, although 
numeric input with the input command has one more little annoyance 
than string input. If you type nonnumeric characters in response to a nu- 
meric input, or if you just hit return, the computer responds with a rude 
reenter prompt and asks for input again. A custom-designed input rou- 
tine allows the program to respond to this situation in a more civilized 
way. For instance, if the user just types return (if W$ = ""...), the 
program can put a default value in the variable in question. The program 
can also check for illegal input, such as a word where a number should 
be, and gently ask the user for clarification ("I said a number, you 
dummy!"). 

All we need to use this kind of input routine is a way of converting 
strings into numeric values. We could write a conversion routine using 
ASC and LEN and MID$ and for-next loops, but that's far too com-

plicated. Let's use VAL instead. 

VAL Is, Like, Totally Tubular. This is too easy. VAL is a function 
statement that takes a string as its argument, interprets it, and returns a 
numeric value. If the string can't be interpreted as a number, VAL re- 
turns a zero. You can check to see if the zero was a real zero or an "I- 
can't-interpret-this-number" zero with some condition as: 

IF VAL(W$) = 0 AND W$ <> "0" THEN PRINT "I said a number, 
you dummy!" 

That, by the way, was one legal way to use VAL. As a numeric function, 
VAL can be used wherever an arithmetic expression is appropriate: that 
is, for-next loops, variable assignments, if-then statements, and fine din- 



188 



mum 



ing establishments everywhere. So the standard numeric input: 

INPUT "Please type a number: ";N 

is replaced with: 

PRINT "Please type a number: ";: GOSUB 100: N = VAL(W$) 

plus whatever precautions you, as the programmer, deem necessary. 

Of course, whether you want to use this routine for string or numeric 
input, you have total freedom to customize it to fit your needs. For in- 
stance, let's say you have a lie and want the delete key to work in your 
programs. With the input statement, pressing the delete key merely in- 
serts a messy-looking cursor character into your text; it doesn't delete 
anything. We can fix that by intercepting the input character. That is, 
right after the get statement in line 120, we slip in a line to check if the 
delete key was pressed and, if so, to convert the character to backspace, 
like so: 

121 IF K$ = CHR$ (127) THEN K$ = CHR$ (8): REM convert 
delete to backspace 

Another type of interception that can be useful is the filtering out of 
unwanted characters. For instance, if you are going to use the routine for 
numeric input only, you can prevent certain user errors by allowing the 
user to type only number characters and the minus sign and decimal 
point. Just look up those values and construct a condition that filters 
other characters out, like this: 

135 IF ASC (K$) < 45 OR ASC (K$) > 57 OR ASC (K$) = 47 
THEN 120: REM this permits only numeric input 

Another handy restriction concerns string length. This would fall in 
the same place in the program flow as the previous change. It has to 
allow control characters to get to their respective routines but prevent 
printable characters from being printed and added to the string if the 
string is already too long. This will do it: 

137 IFLEN(W$) = 12 THEN 120: REM this sets a limit on string 
length 

One other thing you can do is have your routine respond to other spe- 
cial control characters. These characters could do anything: convert all 



lower-case letters in the string to upper case, or vice versa; move the cur- 
sor throughout the string, allowing input in the middle (this is a little 
tricky); remember all deleted characters and allow them to be reinserted 
in last-in first-out fashion by pressing the right arrow key (an idea bor- 
rowed from Apple Writer); or even delete the whole string and start over. 
That last one sounds easy. What character shall we use? Escape? Sure! 

First, let's think about where to put the routine. Fortunately, the input 
routine was built to be expandable. Look at the flow chart in figure 2 to 
determine where hitting escape, which has an ASCII value of twenty- 
seven, would send program control. That's right— it would send control 
careening down that row of condition diamonds until the routine realized 
that it had no condition for accepting the escape key and simply ignored 
it. Clearly, the place to put the escape check is at the end of the chain of 
conditions. Physically, in the program, that means we'll put the condi- 
tion in line 400 and transfer the goto 120, which ends the chain, to line 
500. Here is that part: 

400 IF K$ < > CHR$ (27) THEN 500: REM 27 is escape 
500 GOTO 120 

There are two tasks that have to be performed to delete the whole 
string and start over. The first is erasing the string on the screen, and the 
second is clearing W$. The second is easy. The first isn't too difficult. If 
you don't see how to do it, check out the flow chart in figure 3, which is 
an extension of the flow chart in figure 2. 

Erasing the word on the screen involves printing a backspace-space- 
backspace sequence once for each character of the string. We'll use a 
for-next loop for that. 

410 FOR C = 1 TO LEN (W$) 
420 PRINTCHR$(8);" "; CHR$ (8); 
430 NEXT C 

Next we just clear W$ and go back to get another character. 

440 W$ = "" 
450 GOTO 120 

Test this routine extensively. Can you find the bug in it? One of the 
most important skills in programming is finding and removing bugs. For 
that reason, we won 't explain the bug in this one. Run the routine, try all 
possible combinations, find out what's wrong, figure out why, and fix it. 
Just in case you can't get it, here's the listing in its entirety. The line 
necessary to fix the bug is in there, but don't look for it until you've 
really tried to find and fix the problem. 

No phones calls, please. 

10 GOSUB 100: IN$ = W$: PRINT IN$: END 
100 REM input routine using get 
110 W$ = "": REM this clears W$ 

120 GET K$ 

121 IF K$ = CHR$ (127) THEN K$ = CHR$ (8): REM convert 
delete to backspace 

130 IF ASC (K$) < 32 THEN 200: REM we'll deal with this later 
135 IF ASC (K$) < 45 OR ASC (K$) > 57 OR ASC (K$) = 47 THEN 

120: REM this permits only numeric input 
137 IF LEN (W$) = 12 THEN 120: REM this sets a limit on string length 
140 W$ = W$ + K$ 
150 PRINT K$; 
160 GOTO 120 

200 IF ASC (K$) < > 8 THEN 300: REM 8 is backspace 

210 IF W$ = "" THEN 120 

215 IF LEN (W$) = 1 THEN W$ = "": GOTO 230 

220 W$ = LEFTS (W$, LEN (W$) - 1) 

230 PRINT K$;" ";K$; 

240 GOTO 120 

300 IF ASC (K$) < > 13 THEN 400: REM 13 is return 
310 RETURN 

400 IF K$ < > CHR$ (27) THEN 500: REM 27 is escape 

405 IF W$ = "" THEN 120 

410 FOR C = 1 TO LEN (W$) 

420 PRINTCHR$(8);" "; CHR$ (8); 

430 NEXT C 

440 W$ = "" 

450 GOTO 120

GLOSSARY 

ASC(string expression): A function that derives the ASCII 
value of the first character of the string expression. Acts as 
a numeric expression. See ASCII. 

ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange. 
A code used by most computers in which numbers from 0 
through 127 represent all characters that can appear on 
the screen and all characters that can be entered from the 
keyboard. Some keyboard characters cannot be 
displayed and some displayable characters (especially on 
the Apple II Plus) cannot be typed at the keyboard. 

CHR$(expression): A function that derives a single- 
character string from the numeric expression acting as its 
argument. The argument must be a legal ASCII number 
from 0 to 255 (the range from 128 to 255 duplicates the 
range from 0 to 127). Acts as a string expression. See 
ASCII. 

Destructive backspace: A backspace that not only moves 
the cursor one space to the left but also erases the 
character in that position. 

GET: A command to accept one character of input from the 
keyboard and put it into a variable. Usually used with string 
variables, since its use with a numeric variable increases 
the possibility of an error message should the character ac- 
cepted be nonnumeric. 

Intercepting input: Reading and modifying, eliminating, or 
otherwise acting on characters as they are entered from 
the keyboard before the main input handling routine sees 
them.

How to Spend Money: Lesson One 



When we last left our hero, Klondike Putz was learning how to type 
in programs from listings in books and magazines. Let's go back a bit to 
the time when Klondike first brought his computer home. 

As powerful as Klondike's Apple was, it was a machine of minimal 
configuration— an Apple, a disk drive, and a monitor. It wasn't long 
before he got bored playing the games he had bought with the system; he 
wanted the Apple to do more. He had a word processor, a checkbook 
balancer, a diet planner, and a cheap program mat would keep track of 
how much toothpaste he used each week. But software has its limits. 

A great thing about the Apple and other microcomputers is that 
they're expandable; you can add stuff to them. Things that we add to the 
Apple in order to give it more power are called peripherals. The disk 
drive is a peripheral; it isn't a necessary part of the machine, only a con- 
venient add-on. A joystick or any game controller is a peripheral. 
Anything that isn't part of the Apple itself is a peripheral. Let's look at a 
few popular ones. 

Phone Phun. The device that adds the most capabilities to the com- 
puter is the modem. Short for modulator-demodulator, a modem is 
something that lets the computer communicate with other computers by 
telephone. Those other computers can be anything from an Apple to a 
corporate mainframe computer. 

Computers handle information in the form of electronic bits. In order 
to travel from one place to another by telephone, those bits need to be 
changed into sound, or modulated. That's what the modem does before it 
sends bits of information across telephone lines; it changes bits into 
sounds. When the sounds get to the other computer, they need to be con- 
verted back to bits for the receiving computer to understand them. That's 
the job of the modem at the receiving end; it converts the sounds to bits, 
or demodulates the sound. 

A big reason for wanting to connect your Apple to another computer 
miles away is so you can use the other computer without having to be 
there. At first, that doesn't seem like such a good reason. After all, 
microcomputers are called home computers because they let us do our 
computing at home. But not everything we want is always immediately 
available (isn't that the way life usually works?) 

For example, suppose Klondike has to write a Pascal program for his 
computer science class at Eczema University. The school, which has 
limited funds, can afford only twenty terminals to be shared by three 
hundred students. "Not to worry," thinks Klondike. "I can write my 
program at home." 

Unfortunately, Klondike's Apple doesn't have Pascal, and it would 
cost a few hundred dollars for Klondike to add it to his system. What's 
more, the computer science teacher wants everyone to use the school's 
version of Pascal. No problem. With a modem, Klondike can connect his 
Apple to Eczema U's computer and write his Pascal program just as if he 
were using the Eczema Pascal system through one of the school's 
terminals. 

There are almost as many reasons for connecting one's own computer 
to another as there are reasons for having a computer in the first place. 
One common use of a modem is to hook up with information systems that 
are run on remote computers. 



Infomaniacs in Action. The simplest version of an information 
system is the bulletin board system, referred to as BBS in modem circles. 
A BBS is a computerized version of a bulletin board, just like the ones 
hanging up at the local supermarket. In many ways, a BBS is like a 
database program that lets callers search for, read, and add information 
that is stored on a data disk. 

Messages on BBSs include for-sale notices (computer equipment, 
cars, bicycles), game hints, current events discussions, and private 
messages between callers. Most BBSs don't cost anything to use; all you 
pay for is the phone call. 

Two of the most popular information systems are The Source and 
CompuServe. Each offers some things the other doesn't, but for the most 
part they offer similar services. Both let you retrieve, store, and transfer 
information, make travel arrangements, communicate with other 
subscribers, play games, compute, order merchandise, do word process- 
ing, write programs, and much more. 

Some widely used features of CompuServe and The Source are the 
wire services. Subscribers can call up and read news from international 
news wires and, if they're running a program to hold the information that 
comes on the screen, save news stories to a data disk in the form of a 
text file. 

Though most subscribers to information systems are businesses and 
business professionals, computer hobbyists can often find other hob- 
byists on the system with whom to share information. Information sys- 
tems are good places to meet others with similar interests, whether these 
be computers, aviation, photography, films, music, or raising ants for 
fun and profit (Klondike's favorite). 

Delphi offers many of the same conveniences as The Source and 
CompuServe (news and sports, banking, airline reservations, shopping, 
games), and it includes a twenty -thousand-entry encyclopedia for those 
who want to use their computers for research. 

Dialog Information Services calls itself "the world's most com- 
prehensive on-line information retrieval service." It gives subscribers 
access to more than eighty million items of information in more than one 
hundred eighty databases (how many of us actually possess eighty 
million pieces of information?). Dialog isn't something for just anybody 
with a computer and a modem; for people who do a lot of research it con- 
tains just about everything anyone would ever want to know about 
anything. Anything. 

Another service that's available for researchers is BRS/ After Dark. 
This one covers such subjects as business and finance, education, 
energy, the environment, news, patent information, medicine, psy- 
chology, social sciences, and the humanities. BRS/After Dark isn't 
stocked with as much information as Dialog, but it offers enough to keep 
most people happy. The only restriction of BRS/After Dark is that it can 
only be used between 6 p.m. and midnight. 

Information systems are only one reason why people attach modems 
to their computers. Programmers and hobbyists also use modems to ex- 
change programs with each other; businesses use them to send and re- 
ceive reports, memoranda, letters, and financial figures; still other folks 
use them just because they're fun.

MARCH 1984 



Typing 800 Words Per Minute. After the disk drive, a printer is 
usually the first thing people want to plug into the Apple. Word process- 
ing wouldn't make much sense if we weren't able to print on paper what 
we created on the screen. Picture it: "Hi, Mom. Klondike here. I wrote 
you a letter on my Apple, but you have to come here to read it." It just 
doesn't work. 

Whether it's word processing, financial planning, or keeping an ad- 
dress file, being able to produce printed copies (hard copies) of work is 
convenient and practical. For example, it's sometimes easier to work 
with a printed copy of a word processing file when revising than to page 
through the document on the screen. If your word processor doesn't give 
you a page layout, a hard copy lets you know where some parts of the 
document appear in relation to others. Besides, it doesn't matter if you're 
writing a project budget proposal or a letter to Aunt Eleanor; sooner or 
later it's going to be printed out on paper. 

Printers come in two genera — parallel and serial. A parallel printer 
receives information a character at a time through a connector made of 
several wires. Characters go to the printer through eight wires, because 
each character is made up of eight bits. In addition to those wires, the 
connector has additional wires for special control signals. Think of the 
cable that connects the computer and printer as a tunnel that's wide 
enough for an army to walk eight abreast with drill sergeants on the side. 
That's a parallel connector. 

Serial printers receive information one bit at a time through a single 
wire. As with a parallel connector, some extra wires are necessary for 
control signals. A serial connector can be thought of as a narrow tunnel 
that allows the army to pass through in single file only. 

Degrees, Dots, and Daisies. Under each genus (parallel or serial), 
printers come in three main species— thermal, dot-matrix, and letter- 
quality (daisy-wheel). As with computers, software, and tennis shoes, 
the kind of printer you should get depends on what you need it for. 

Thermal printers print on heat-sensitive paper that comes on a roll. 
By applying heat to the paper, the printer can make fine pictures and 
rough draft copies of text material. However, because the paper is rather 
flimsy and the text characters aren't too clear, a thermal printer isn't one 
you'd use for printing anything you'd expect to pass on to someone else 
(the teacher, the boss, or the FBI). On the positive side, thermal printers 
are inexpensive, quiet, and fast. 

The next printer species is the dot-matrix printer. Creatures of this 
variety get their name from the way they create characters on paper. If 
you look carefully at a letter or number on the computer screen, you can 
see that it's made of dots. Dot-matrix printers generate characters the 
same way. Instead of striking the paper with a character the way a 
typewriter does, a dot-matrix printer's "hammer" strikes a vertical line 
of pins that poke out and hit the paper at various places to create 
a character. 

Dot-matrix printers vary in quality; some create characters that look 
like a bunch of dots, while others place the dots so close together that the 
printed page looks like it was typed on an expensive typewriter. Dot- 
matrix printers cost more than thermal but less than letter-quality 
printers. They also tend to be noisy and just a hair less irritating than 
fingernails on a chalkboard. 

For most purposes, a dot-matrix printer is acceptable. Students can 
print papers and reports on them; Aunt Eleanor won't mind receiving a 
letter printed on one (especially if she can't read your handwriting); and 
some businesses find them suitable for printing business correspondence. 
Still, there's always the outside chance that the person you're writing to 
will be one of those anticomputer activists who might take offense 
at receiving a computer-generated letter, so use discretion. There's no 
law that says you have to use a computer whenever possible. Only if 
it's convenient. 

The most sophisticated species of printer is the letter-quality printer, 
sometimes called a daisy-wheel printer because of the daisy-shaped 
wheel that holds the characters on "petals." A letter-quality printer pro- 
duces clear characters on ordinary paper (track-feed or single sheet). It 
works similarly to the way a typewriter works; for each character, a dif- 
ferent part of the wheel strikes the paper. 

The wheel spins around at a high speed and moves across the page at 
the same time. When the right character is lined up with the appropriate 
place on the paper, a hammer strikes the petal, leaving the character's 
image on the paper— precision timing at its best. 

Some letter-quality printers use a ball-type device like that of an IBM 



Selectric typewriter instead of a daisy wheel, but the printed result is 
generally the same. Documents printed with a letter-quality printer often 
look better than those created on a typewriter, and it's impossible to tell 
where any typing errors might have occurred (not so for typewritten 
documents; just hold them up to the light and you can see where the typ- 
ist used correction fluid). 

Letter-quality printers cost more than thermal or dot-matrix printers, 
but the results look the best. 

So much for printers. 

Hard Promises. Anyone who has an extra few thousand dollars lying 
around can add a hard disk, or Winchester disk, to the existing setup. 
Klondike is one of those people. 

It took Klondike a month and a half just to get through the Apple 
Presents . . . Apple disk, but then he was ready for bigger challenges. 
The first thing he wanted to do was use his new word processing pro- 
gram to begin writing his book, Things I've Learned Too Late. 

Klondike trotted off to the computer store and bought a box of ten 
disks to store his text files on. "This," he thought, "will set me up for 
life." After all, one disk holds 140K of information, or about eighty 
double-spaced pages; his box of disks would hold up to eight hundred 
pages of text. 

A few months later, Klondike had written about five pages of his 
book (there weren't a whole lot of things he'd learned, let alone too late), 
but most of his disks were full. When he wasn't writing, Klondike was 
teaching himself Basic and downloading fdes from BBSs and other infor- 
mation systems; his programs and downloaded fdes were what took up 
most of his disk space. 

As a result, he bought a bunch of additional disks, and it soon became 
nearly impossible to find a particular one when he needed it. 

Though most of us aren't as disorganized as Klondike, digging 
through piles of disks can be a hassle. One solution is to store informa- 
tion on a hard disk instead of on numerous floppy disks. A hard disk is 
sealed permanently inside its case, safe from dirty air, fingerprints, 
adventurous children, and other hazards. It can store much more infor- 
mation than a floppy disk, and it reads and writes faster than a floppy 
disk drive. 

Hard disks begin at five megabytes of storage space, which is roughly 
five million bytes, or 5, 000K— thirty-five times the capacity of a normal 
Apple DOS disk. Some hard disks have a storage capacity of one hun- 
dred forty megabytes, but ten megabytes is what most hard disks have. A 
hard disk costs more than a disk drive, and prices go up as the amount of 
storage space increases. 

Need Versus Want. Before you dash down to the computer store and 
say, "Hey, sell me this hard disk," it's a good idea to find out whether 
you really need one. Hard disks are convenient and fun to have, but so 
are speedboats and private jets. 

If your Apple is for personal use (home accounting, games, simple 
word processing), it's likely you don't need a hard disk. By contrast, 
those who use their Apples for business purposes might want to invest in 
one if their work involves voluminous data — accounting, database 
management, or anything that fills up floppy disks quickly. 

Because a hard disk can store such large amounts of information, it 
helps eliminate the problem of keeping track of floppy disks. (The hard 
disk was a godsend for Klondike. Whenever his floppy disks became too 
many to handle, he used to go out and buy himself a new pair of shoes so 
he could use the shoe box as a place to keep his disks.) 

As with information stored on floppy disks, it's good practice to keep 
backup copies of what's stored on a hard disk. A full ten-megabyte hard 
disk will require about seventy floppy disks to back up, but it's a small 
price relative to the time spent and ulcers developed when inputting 
lost data. 

But Wait, There's More. Adding things to the Apple sometimes 
seems like an obsession with some hobbyists. Take a peek inside their 
Apples; it looks like they felt obligated to fill every available slot. Then 
they complain about eight slots being too few. 

Printers, modems, and hard disks are just a few things that can be 
added to the Apple. Next month we'll look briefly at some other periph- 
erals, including light pens (for making keen pictures), graphics tablets 
(an expensive way to make keen pictures), the color plotter (something 
that draws keen pictures), extra-memory cards, Z-80 cards (which allow 
the Apple to run programs written under the popular CP/M operating 
system), and cooling fans to give the Apple some air conditioning. H

every software and hardware review that has 
appeared in Softalk through December 1983. 
Following the product 's name, you '11 find its 
author, publisher, name of the person who re- 
viewed it, when the review appeared, and the 
page where it can be found. ' 'Impression ' ' indi- 
cates that a product was given a cursory evalua- 
tion. Not all the reviews appeared in Marketalk 
News, so go by the page numbers. 

Each January from now on, we '11 update the

THE MOST POWERFUL 



Introducing the capability the world has 
been waiting for. A single personal com- 
puter able to handle Apple® IBM® 
TRS-80® UNIX™ and CP/M® based 
software. 

The Dimension 68000 Professional 
Personal Computer does it all. It actually 
contains the microprocessors found in all 
of today s popular personal computers. 
And a dramatic innovation creates the 
environment that these systems function 
merely by plugging in the software. 

Add to this the incredible power of a 
32 bit MC68000 microprocessor with up 
to 16 megabytes of random access 
memory. 

Dimension. At about the same price 
as the IBM® PC, it's obviously the best 
value you can find. For more informa- 
tion ask your dealer or call us at "(2 14)

A TIMELY 
ANNOUNCEMENT 



FORProDOS 
USERS: 



TM 



Congratulations! You not only 
have a powerful new operating 
system in Apple's* ProDOS, you can 
now get an incredibly versatile 
Clock/Calendar card to use with it. 
PROCLOCK™. 




PROCLOCK is the first 
Clock/Calendar designed for 
ProDOS-based systems as well as 
other Apples mnning DOS 3.3, 
CP/M**, Pascal, Applesoft*, and 
BASIC. 

What's more, PROCLOCK fully 
emulates Superclock II, 
Thunderclock Plus and Apple 
Clock*. So programs written for 
these products can be used without 
any modification. 

Of course, PROCLOCK will time- 
and date-coding files. And consider 
how much money you could save 
by timing your modem to transmit 
when the phone rates are cheapest. 
You can even use PROCLOCK as 
part of an automatic appliance 
control system. 

Plus, PROCLOCK's powerful inter- 
rupt capabilities are invaluable to 
programmers working with time- 
sensitive routines and multi-tasking. 
It can generate interrupts at inter- 
vals of 1 millisecond, 1 second, 1 



minute, 1 hour, or any combination 
of those. And all interrupts are 
software-controlled and handled 
through PROCLOCK's on-board PIA. 

Speaking of software, you also get 
a diskette full of sample programs, 
utilities and applications like our 
Time-Clock II job/time logging 
program. 

PROCLOCK even includes one 
feature we don't expect anyone to 
take advantage of— a 10-year lithium 
battery that keeps the clock running 
even if your computer is left off for 
long periods of time. 

But just try to keep away from 
your Apple long enough to put that 
to the test! With PROCLOCK, you'll 
have a whole new world of applica- 
tions to explore. And plenty of time 
to explore it. Because PROCLOCK is 
a reliable, well-built piece of hard- 
ware. So well-built, it's backed by a 
five-year warranty. 

Ask your dealer about PRO- 
CLOCK. It's perfect timing for Pro- 
DOS users! 

Another practical product from

SCIENTISTS PONDER BIG BANG 
WITH COMPUTER SIMULATIONS 



Most physicists agree that modern cosmol- 
ogy—the study of the origin, evolution, and 
structure of the universe — was born in 1965, 
when Bell Laboratory scientists Arno Penzias 
and Robert Wilson accidentally discovered 
cosmic static. This feeble wash of microwaves 
is generally considered to be a signal from the 
universe's beginning. Since this remarkable 
discovery, which won the two scientists a 
Nobel Prize, the standard explanation for the 
origin of the universe has been the "big 
bang" theory, according to which the physical 
universe expanded— and is expanding still — 
from an unimaginably hot and dense point as 
the result of a gigantic explosion some fifteen 

No, it's not the big bang. The picture above is

to twenty billion years ago. 

In the 1920s, Einstein applied his general 
theory of relativity to cosmology. Instead of 
finding a static universe, as he expected, Ein- 
stein found that the universe must be either ex- 
panding or contracting; a static universe could 
not be stable. A few years later, American 
astronomer Edwin Hubble demonstrated that 
the universe was indeed expanding— that the 
galaxies were all rushing away from us (and 
each other) at a speed proportional to their dis- 
tance. This discovery was taken as confirma- 
tion of the big bang theory. 

The task of modern cosmologists, using 
recent developments in particle physics cou- 
pled with relativity theory, has been to run the 
universe back mathematically— to reverse the 
cosmic film of time and space, so to speak.

AUTHORS STRIVE 
TO PERFECT A 
STANDARD BASIC 

It's been twenty years since Dr. Thomas 
Kurtz and Dr. John G. Kemeny introduced 
Beginners' All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction 
Code, or Basic, to the world of computing. 
What began as a small project at Dartmouth 
College in New Hampshire ended up bringing 
the power of computing to millions. 

Kemeny and Kurtz's Basic was easy to 
use. It was so easy that it's still the most 
popular programming language in the world. 
The original edition of Basic, although 
copyrighted, was distributed freely to anyone 
who wanted to use it. But as the number of 
computer models increased during the inter- 
vening years, a number of different versions 
of Basic arose with them. It seemed that for 
one reason or another, each new computer re- 
quired a different version of the language. 
Through the years, some pretty bad imple- 
mentations of "old" Basic gave the language 
a bad name in some computing circles. 

Reacting to the Babel-like confusion and 
the possibility of someone rushing out with a 
less-than-wonderful structured version of Ba- 
sic, Kemeny and Kurtz have joined forces 
once again to write the definitive version of 
Basic, called True Basic. 

"It was due to the confusion between 
Basics that we decided to start this effort," 
says Kemeny, who is still at Dartmouth. "No 
two Basics on personal computers are com- 
patible, and all of the current versions are 
quite out of date from the perspective of those 
of us who have been involved in language 
development for a long time." 

In 1974 the National Standards Committee 
of the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI) began the slow process of developing 
a voluntary standard for Basic. A "minimal" 
Basic standard appeared in 1978. Now, 
Kemeny— who chairs the ANSI subcommit- 
tee — sees a way to perfect the language and to 
introduce a structured version that meets the 
specifications of the new, "full" standard. 

According to ANSI officials, anyone is 
free to develop a version of Basic that meets 
the standard, and it is rumored that several 
large companies are working on their own im- 
plementations. So Kemeny and Kurtz are in a 
race to get True Basic finished and on the 
market. This time, it won't be available for 
the asking. 

Kemeny and Kurtz formed a small private 
company named True Basic in August of 
1983. The pair felt the need to do their work 
away from the academic environment. With 
three systems programmers currently in their 
employ, they have plans to aim the product at 
the educational market. 

"We hope that True Basic will make it 
vastly easier for people to write and under-

Winter CES Invades Las Vegas and 
The Gambling Pays Off for Most 




It was business as usual at the 1984 Inter- 
national Winter Consumer Electronics Show, 
held January 7-10 in Las Vegas, and most 
participants breathed a sigh of relief. Beyond 
the flood of gewgaws and the gigabits of mis- 
leading information, there was actually some 
worthwhile business transacted during the 
show. 

The exhibitors came from all over the 
world and unveiled a wide range of merchan- 
dise, all loosely related by the term "elec- 
tronics." Reacting to the breakup of AT&T, 



speak, August 1983) continued to fail to cause 
excitement. Spectra Video was the only Amer- 
ican company at the show with an MSX com- 
puter, and they had to obtain demonstration 
cartridges from a company in Hong Kong 
(which had, in turn, imported them from Ja- 
pan). The three U.S. companies that had 
previously announced support of MSX— Spin- 
naker, Sirius, and Sierra On-Line— modified 
their positions somewhat, saying in effect that 
they'd support MSX if it ever became 
popular. 




dozens of firms offered phone equip- 
ment—everything from Speciality Phone's 
Phona-football ("America's favorite sport is 
now America's favorite telephone") and 
Phona-duck, to AT&T's System 1000 cellular 
telephone. Quite a bit of acreage was devoted 
to telephones, watches, clocks, and other 
high-tech household items, such as Techna- 
sonic's Pest Raider. 

Most of the major video and audio firms, 
and plenty of the minor ones, were present. 
Videodiscs, compact digital discs, and newly 
released movies on videocassette made up the 
marketing thrust of these companies. More 
than one exhibitor in the consumer video in- 
dustry found an excuse to hook up a VCR and 
a monitor and show Making Michael 
Jackson 's "Thriller" on a continous loop. 

Personal computers and video games held 
their own amid the near-hysterical high-tech 
wash. There were plenty of new computers 
and some new software products. Apple, of 
course, chose not to announce or display 
Macintosh. Instead, the company took a small 
booth off to the side and courted the education 
market. IBM chose to skip the scene altogeth- 
er, though the PCjr was in evidence at various 
booths. 

Microsoft's MSX standard (see New- 



Commodore showed the software-bundled 
Commodore 264 (to be officially introduced 
this April Fool's Day) and held its twenty-fifth 
anniversary/we-made-a-billion-dollars-this- 
year party at the MGM Grand. The com- 
pany's top brass addressed the assemblage and 
kidded around about Commodore's high rate 
of employee turnover. Chairman Jack Tramiel 
spoke in glowing terms about the performance 
of his company and its commitment to the fu- 
ture. (He resigned five days after the show.) 

Coleco was up to its old piggyback tricks, 
announcing another "plug-in module," this 
one making the company's Adam computer 
compatible with the IBM PC. The company 
will also bring out a videodisc player for the 
Adam. 

Leonard Nimoy stood quietly at the 
HESware booth, busily signing autographs in 
his new role as corporate spokesvulcan for the 
Commodore software house. In an unrelated 
development, Sega drew crowds across the 
way with more personal computer versions of 
Star Trek: The Search for Spock than you 
could shake an EPROM at.

New High-Flying Camera 
Soars Above the Scene 



Zooming and swooping around on sus- 
pended cables, a new kind of motion picture 
camera system called Skycam should be offer- 
ing television viewers of the 1984 Summer 
Olympics some extraordinary new perspec- 
tives on the Olympians and their events. 

Skycam is the latest inspiration of cinema- 
tographer Garrett Brown, who in 1978 earned 
himself the coveted Academy Award for tech- 
nical achievement with another of his crea- 
tions — the Steadicam. Brown's shock-resis- 
tant Steadicam virtually revolutionized both 
film and television camera work. A single 
cameraman could perform complicated ma- 
neuvers, such as wandering through a crowd 
of people, without the shakiness of traditional 
handheld camera work. 

Brown's latest innovation addresses an- 
other technical problem that has long plagued 
cinematographers of major stadium and out- 
door events: how to get the camera down into 
the action without being confronted by the im-

practicalities and dangers of putting a camera- 
man in the way of, say, a 250-pound rampag- 
ing cornerback. 

Brown's answer? Suspend a camera by 
four cables slung from any four suitable struc- 
tures located around the perimeter of the site. 
The camera, situated on a motorized pivoting 
yoke and moved by four connecting cables, 
has unrestricted movement within a three- 
dimensional area. 

Controlled by a 256K eight-megaHertz 
computer from Sage Technology and moved 
by a joystick from the operation console, the 
Skycam tracks around a field on the cables, 
which are fed out of drums located at the bases 
of the four supporting structures. If the 
operator wants to move the camera, he in- 
structs the system to let out cable from two of 
the structures and draw cable in from the two 
opposing structures. 

Increasing or decreasing the overall slack 
from the drums simultaneously will lower the 
camera to within inches of the ground or raise 
it high above the action. The entire apparatus 
can be set up by a crew of technicians in a 
matter of hours. 

"Stability is a crucial factor," observes 
Brown. Keeping a camera that's dangling 
from cables stable against stadium winds is no 
easy feat. Brown used motion sensors and 
gyroscopes, similar to those found in the gui- 
dance systems of jet aircraft, to keep 



Skycam's movement uniform and smooth. 

In all, sixteen different camera adjust- 
ments—including height, pitch, roll, and 
yaw— had to be handled simultaneously by 
the computer. 

"The program had to control many motor- 
ized devices at once," says project software 
developer Larry Cone. "The main computer 
had to be able to communicate with its satellite 
6809 motor control processors over very long 
distances without radio or electronic interfer- 
ence." This was accomplished using an 
RS-232 serial interface and fiber optic cables. 

Cone decided to write the control software 
in Forth. "Development time was shorter than 
it would have been if we'd worked in assem- 
bly language, and we still retain access to the 
whole range of system facilities." 

"Problems in timing and interface make 
the programming of computer motion control 
devices somewhat different from usual pro- 
gramming tasks," says Cone. But from a 
user's point of view, "Skycam plays like the 
world's largest video game." 

Shooting video cameras by remote control 
is one thing, but how does a cinematographer, 
using film, know if the shot is in frame and fo- 
cused when he is sitting at an operation con- 
sole a thousand feet away? Brown solved this 
problem by using a specially designed 
ultralight Panavision camera — dubbed the 
'Garrett' — that has a built-in through-lens 
video link. 

A public unveiling of the prototype Sky- 
cam system occurred in June of last year. A 
new silent, weatherproof version is now being 
marketed by Brown's new company Sky- 
works. Inquiries are already coming in from 
producers, directors, and cinematographers 
about its use in films, concerts, and sporting 
events. 

How do performers and spectators react to 
Skycam's swooping down out of the sky? 
"People glance at it," replies Cone, "but 
they aren't distracted by it." HAS 



Billboard's Video 
And Software 
Show Slated 
For March 

Billboard, a leading music industry week- 
ly, is sponsoring a three-day conference on 
computer software and video games at the 
Westin Saint Francis Hotel in San Francisco, 
March 7-9. Attendees should have serious 
avocational, if not vocational, interest in the 
subject, as registration is $350. 

The conference includes ten lectures, an 
awards banquet, an experts' panel luncheon, 
and numerous demonstrations of new enter- 
tainment, educational, and home management 
software designed for Apple, IBM, Atari, and 
Commodore microcomputers. 



The registration deadline is March 5. For 
more information, call or write Billboard's 
Los Angeles office in Beverly Hills, Cali- 
fornia. 

Last spring's Billboard conference, the 
first of its kind sponsored by the magazine, fo- 
cused on video games, and drew about one 
hundred fifty manufacturers, programmers, 
retailers, and distributors. This conference, 
which will focus primarily on microcomputer- 
ware, is an extension of the magazine's grow- 
ing coverage of the software industry— a pro- 
gression that has gone from music to music 
videos to video games to home computer soft- 
ware, particularly entertainment software. 

Billboard began editorial coverage of the 
software industry about a year ago, with re- 
ports on new products and the retail end of the 
business. The publication began the charting 
of bestselling software about six months ago. 
It charts the top twenty entertainment tides, as 
well as the top ten education and home man- 
agement programs. The weekly survey covers 
overall sales for all the most popular brands of 
personal computers. JP

Cosmology 



.continued from page 207. 



The tools used to create these universal 
biographies are large computers. 

By feeding computers huge batches of data 
based on particle physics, scientists hope to 
simulate the evolution of several possible uni- 
verses. In response to the data, the computers 
provide graphic "snapshots" of these various 
models at different stages of their develop- 
ment. 

The reason for this effort is obvious. There 
are too many unanswered questions about our 
universe, questions that are highly relevant to 
our present existence. Why is the matter in the 
universe distributed in the manner in which 
we find it? Is the universe composed of pri- 
marily luminous matter, or are some dark cos- 
mic constituents eluding our vision? The laws 
of physics dictate that if there is too much mat- 
ter in the cosmos, eventually the universe will 
fall back on itself. Could it be that we are in an 
expansion phase of a perpetually oscillating 
system? 

Reconstructing the history of the entire 
universe is no simple task, and even the 
largest computers help cosmologists glimpse 
only part of the picture. The best methods, for 
the moment, involve simplifying the model in 
question until it's stripped of all but the most 
pertinent characteristics. 

Nearly all simulations to date have illumi- 
nated the cosmic history of only one kind of 
particle at a time. In the early 1970s, simula- 
tion studies were focused on hydrogen, the 
most abundant element in the universe. Cos- 
mologists first looked to see whether the ele- 
ment was randomly distributed at the birth of 
the universe. (The hydrogen we find today in 
the observable universe is certainly not ran- 
domly distributed; it's clumped together into 
galaxies, oceans, and living beings.) 

Results of those initial studies suggested 
that hydrogen was not randomly distributed at 
the beginning, but the studies could not ac- 
count for such nonrandom phenomena as su- 
perclusters— enormous spaghetti-like strings 
of clustered galaxies. Essentially, the present 
universe consists of these superclusters, sepa- 
rated by vast wastelands nearly devoid of matter. 

In attempts to verify a random distribution 
of matter, astrophysicists in the 1970s used 
the "auto-correlation" function. Starting with 
any particular galaxy, the auto-correlation 
function measures the odds of finding another 
galaxy at any given distance. Generally, this 
probability varies as the distance changes. 

When the computers' predictions were 
compared with real astronomical observa- 
tions, however, they did not match. Cosmolo- 
gists then went back to their proverbial draw- 
ing boards and tried to posit a set of initial 
conditions that could have produced a uni- 
verse made up of superclusters and voids. 
They're still trying and some interesting sce- 
narios are emerging as a result of this work. 




Current cosmological theories postulate 
that as positively charged protons began to 
latch onto negatively charged electrons to 
form hydrogen in the cooling, half-million- 
y ear-old universe, photons (elementary par- 
ticles of light) were freed. Such "decoupled" 
light then traveled, more or less unopposed, 
throughout the cosmos. These photons are 
relics of the big bang and offer a glimpse of 
what the universe was once like. 

Ancient photons, their energy diminished 
to the level of microwave radiation, con- 
stituted the annoying static that Penzias and 
Wilson discovered in 1965. Further measure- 
ments have shown that the earth receives the 
same amount of this electromagnetic back- 
ground noise, at the same energy levels, from 
all directions in space. This uniformity indi- 
cates that the photons were evenly distributed 
at the time of decoupling, implying that pro- 
tons and electrons were evenly distributed as 
well. 

However, computer simulations have 
shown that the supposedly smooth initial dis- 
tribution of light and hydrogen cannot account 
for the observed clumping of matter in the 
present universe. In the late 1970s, research- 
ers realized that they had probably oversimpli- 
fied their computer models. So in recent 
years, such notions as "inflation"— first pro- 
posed by MIT's Alan Guth — have become 
popular theories for explaining what happened 
during and right after the bang. 

The possibility that there's some kind of 
matter in the universe that has so far eluded 
our observation is also a big topic among cos- 
mologists. Clustered galaxies clocked at high 
speeds have been puzzling astrophysicists for 
years. The mass of these clusters appears to be 
insufficient to hold them together by gravity 
alone, but estimations of their mass have been 
based on the amount of luminous matter they 
contain. Perhaps there's some electromagneti- 
cally "dark" matter providing additional 
gravitation. 

Cosmic dust, cold, planet-sized rocks, 



black holes, and a variety of subatomic par- 
ticles have all been nominated for the dark- 
matter role. But these candidates were elimi- 
nated by cosmologist Adrian Melott, whose 
computer simulations showed that for the mat- 
ter to be baryonic (consisting of protons and 
neutrons clustered in atomic nuclei), there 
would have to be far more helium and deuteri- 
um in the universe. 

Another candidate for the dark matter was

Cosmology 

—continued from page 21 1 
the elusive neutrino— an elementary particle 
decoupled from the rest of cosmic matter early 
in the life of the universe. Neutrinos may have 
had lumpier distributions than hydrogen at the 
photon-decoupling epoch (the usual starting 
point for computer simulations). The evidence 
was encouraging, but there was one problem: 
Neutrinos are allegedly massless. In 1980, 
however, a controversial Soviet experiment 
claimed to show that neutrinos do have a 
minuscule, but definitely nonzero, rest mass. 

The neutrino would provide about the right 
amount of missing mass to explain the cohe- 
siveness of galactic clusters, and initial com- 
puter simulations along these lines — tracking 
only neutrinos — resulted in collections of mat- 
ter much like those we observe today. In addi- 
tion, some researchers believed that ordinary 
"hydrodynamic" baryonic matter (found in 
stars and human beings) would probably tag 
along with the neutrinos. 

But when the auto-correlation function (the 
observed probable distance between galaxies) 
was applied to these models, the computer 
snapshot showed a universe too young to cor- 
respond to the one we know and love. In it, 
matter would be just starting to clump, in- 
dicating that the galaxies were formed just the 
other day, cosmically speaking; this is not 
consistent with observation. Researchers now 




sum: 1/ 



realize that for simulations to be accurate, 
baryonic matter (not just neutrinos) must be 
included, and they are proceeding with com- 
puter simulations along these lines. 

Other researchers are considering still 
more controversial particles as the dark mat- 
ter. The latest models rely not on known par- 
ticles, but on theoretical particles such as ax- 
ions, gravitinos, and photinos. 

Cosmologists are a long way from solving 
all the mysteries of the universe. The speed 
and storage capabilities of present-day com- 
puters have been strained to the limit, so 
cosmologists must now await the advent of 
bigger, better, and faster computers — the 
much-anticipated Fifth Generation. Perhaps it 
is presumptuous to think that better machines 
will help us re-create an event that occurred 
twenty billion years ago, but they certainly of- 
fer us a better chance of understanding our 
past, our present, and possibly our future. DH 



Basic 

-•continued from page 207 
stand the language. We're promising interest- 
ed parties that within two years they can have 
True Basic running on all of the leading per- 
sonal computers." 

Publishing houses— which currently are in 
the uncomfortable position of having to bring 
out numerous versions of any book that con- 
tains Basic programs— have expressed interest 
in True Basic. 

"We hope that in the future these com- 
panies can publish just one book written in 
True Basic," says Kemeny. "Oh, they'll have 
to have different disks for the varying sys- 
tems, but the authors only have to write the 
code once. Several publishers are very ex- 
cited, and we're very close to signing a major 
contract." 

Not everyone, though, is enthusiastic 
about a standard Basic. Many companies have 
invested enormous amounts of money in old 
versions of Basic, and they will look long and 
hard at anything new before dumping what 
they have supported up until now. If the lan- 
guage becomes popular, however, the wait- 
and-see attitude may change. 

What differences are there between the old 
Basics and True Basic? 

"The most important feature is that True 
Basic is a fully structured language," Kemeny 
explains. "If one had to compare it to another 
language, Pascal would be a good example. 
True Basic has room for external procedures 
and the programs are very easy to read. 

"True Basic is also compiled," Kemeny 
adds. "This compiling pass is really crucial. A 
compiler will find all of a program's syntactic 
errors very quickly. These are the most com- 
mon errors, and the program will not execute 
until it is free of these syntactic problems. 
Now, if the errors happen to be located way 
down in the program code, an interpreted Ba- 
sic will grind away until it gets to that par- 
ticular line where the error is located. After 
wasting ten minutes, you're informed of the 



MARCH 1984 



error." 

Kemeny indicates that he and Kurtz are 
trying for a happy medium. They have spent a 
great deal of time on the design of the lan- 
guage. A full compiler is usually too large to 
operate within the confines of a small com- 
puter. Consequently, True Basic will offer 
half-compiled and half-interpretive opera- 
tions. 

"When we first wrote Basic, it was very 
simple," Kemeny says. "Over the years, ad- 
vanced features were added. My design cri- 
terion was that no advanced feature could be 
added to Basic if it made life harder for the 
beginning student." 

Field-testing of True Basic will take place 
this summer, with a version available for the 
IBM PC by September of this year. Why was 
the IBM PC picked as the initial vehicle for 
True Basic? 

"At the time our company was formed last 
year, the Macintosh and the PCjr hadn't been 
announced," Kemeny explains. "We picked a 
popular personal computer with the necessary 
amount of memory." Because of the com- 
piler, it takes a 128K machine to run True Ba- 
sic. "There will be a Macintosh version in the 
not-too-distant future, but there won't be a 
version for eight-bit computers due to the 
memory constraints." 

Kemeny is enthusiastic about the future of 
True Basic. "This is an extremely high- 
quality language with a wonderful user inter- 
face," he states. "True Basic is much larger 
and more powerful than current Basics . ' ' HL 




□ Collector's Item. Buyers of Pryority Soft- 
ware's new adventure, Forbidden Quest, may 
be getting more than they expected from the 
art prints included with the game. The prints, 
by comics artists Frank Cirocco and the late 
great Wally Wood, are provided as a bonus 
and as a source of clues to the adventure. 
That, of course, is a fair incentive for adven- 
turers who appreciate artwork, especially 
since Wally Wood is known as one of the 
"Golden Age" artists in the comics field; his 
work for EC Comics in the fifties is now 
legendary. Wood died suddenly late in 1983, 
and this could further increase the value of his 
single-color print included with Pryority's 
game. MB

and read-only storage of analog and digital in- 
formation—including office documents, engi- 
neering drawings, and parts catalogs — will be 
covered and demonstrated. For further infor-

THE NEW TIMEMASTER II 



Automatically date , jj 
stamps files with ,9 
PRO-DOS M 




NEW 1984 
DESIGN 
An official 
PRO-DOS Clock 



• Just plug it in and your programs can read the year, month, date, day, 
and time to 1 millisecond! The only clock with both year and ms. 

• NiCad battery keeps the TIMEMASTER II running for over ten years. 

• Full emulation of ALL other clocks. Yes, we emulate Brand A, Brand T, 
Brand P, Brand C, Brand S and Brand M too. It's easy for the 
TIMEMASTER to emulate other clocks, we just drop off features. 
That's why we can emulate others, but others CAN'T emulate us. 

• The TIMEMASTER II will automatically emulate the correct clock card 
for the software you're using. You can also give the TIMEMASTER II a 
simple command to tell it which clock to emulate (but you'll like the 
Timemaster mode better). This is great for writing programs for those 
poor unfortunates that bought some other clock card. 

• Basic, Machine Code, CP/M and Pascal software on 2 disks! 

• Eight software controlled interrupts so you can execute two programs 
at the same time (many examples are included). 

• On-board timer lets you time any interval up to 48 days long down to 
the nearest millisecond. 

The TIMEMASTER II includes 2 disks with some really fantastic time oriented 
programs (over 40) including appointment book so you'll never forget to do anything 
again. Enter your appointments up to a year in advance then forget them. Plus DOS 
dater so it will automatically add the date when disk files are created or modified. The 
disk is over a $200.00 value alone— we give the software others sell. All software 
packages for business, data base management and communications are made to 
read the TIMEMASTER II. If you want the most powerful and the easiest to use clock 
for your Apple, you want a TIMEMASTER II.

□ "You Toucha My Micro, I Laugha in 
Your Face." A new product with the poten- 
tial to reduce the theft of car radios, TV sets, 
telephones, and other microprocessor- 
controlled products was recently introduced 
by International Electronic Technology Cor- 
poration of Far Rockaway, New York. The 
company has developed what it calls the Kaish 
Circuit Lockout System, an electronic coding 
program that can be applied to microprocessor 
chips. The system makes use of three different 
digital codes, two of which are applied at the 
factory. The third is a personal code of the 
owner's choosing. Once a unit is fully pro- 
grammed, disconnecting it from the power 
source or tampering with it in any way will 
render it inoperable unless the proper 
owner-specified code is entered. The idea is to 
deter the theft of many common electronics 
products by making them unsellable. The 
company estimates that adding the Kaish Cir- 
cuit Lockout System to a given product will 
add less than five dollars to the cost of 
manufacturing. International Electronic 
Technology has applied for a patent on its 
system and plans to license it to manufac- 
turers. 

□ Tubular Computers and Roboobs. Com- 
puters and fanciful robots are popular items 
these days in Hollywood. NBC's Knight Rider 
features a computerized car named KITT, 
with a voice that sounds like H. A.L. in 2007: A 
Space Odyssey. ABC's midseason entry, 
Automan, focuses on a translucent crime 
fighter, a computer game figure brought to 
life by a young cop— Pac-Man wearing a 
white hat. The neon Automan has a holo- 
graphic sidekick named Cursor. NBC's mid- 
season newcomer, Riptide, features a faintly 
reptilian-looking Roboz the robot. And a com- 
puter is a regular on NBC's Silver Spoons; the 
main character uses it to predict the outcome 
of football games and to gain access to data- 
bases. Both ABC's Blue Thunder and CBS's 
Airwolf feature high-tech, computerized 
helicopters. Later this year, ABC plans to air 
a two-hour TV movie/series pilot called 
Midas Valley— & Silicon Valley saga by Ann 
Bickett. 

□ No Burning Notebooks When School's 
Out. A study conducted by International Re- 
source Development (Norwalk, CT), a tech- 
nology-oriented market research firm, 
predicts that by 1988 an increasing number of 
students will use portable notebook-sized 
computers for doing homework, taking notes, 
and grading their teachers. Students' com- 
puters will be interrogated by the Board of 
Education's computer; thus, the board will be 
able to confidentially track students' progress 
as well as their teachers' effectiveness. At 
year's end, the teachers' "grades" would be 
used as the basis for determining merit pay, 
Jan Ancker of the IRD research staff says. 
Through the years, the computer would retain 
in memory the speed at which a child learned 
each subject, as well as pertinent facts about 
the child's educational history and achieve- 
ments. "As the child approaches eighteen, the 
Scholastic Aptitude Tests will be rendered un- 
necessary for admission to colleges, ' ' Ancker

says. A student's degree of knowledge and 
rate of mental development will be available 
to the college of his choice straight from the 
sealed memory chip in his notebook com- 
puter. CP 

□ Hostiles on the Horizon. The Robotics 
and Remote Handling in Hostile Environ- 
ments meeting will be held April 23-26 at the 
Sheraton Hotel in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. 
Sponsored by the American Nuclear Society's 
Remote Systems Technology Division (ANS/ 
RSTD) and the Oak Ridge/Knoxville ANS 
Section, the meeting will focus on the use of 
robotics in nuclear power plants and other 
hostile environments. For further informa- 
tion, contact the show's technical program 
chairman in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. 

□ Dishing Out Satellite Info. The Book Pub- 
lishing Company (Summertown, TN) has re- 
leased The World of Satellite Television. The 
book's authors, Mark Long and Jeffrey Keat- 
ing, have compiled a reference guide for the ac- 
complished home video enthusiast, as well as 
an easy introduction to satellite technology for 
the newcomer. The 224-page volume covers 
receiving dishes, feedhorns, low-noise ampli- 
fiers, polarizers, and other accessories, as well 
as providing information on troubleshooting, 
legal concerns, and methods of installing your 
own system. The World of Satellite Television 
also includes useful facts about existing satellite 
channels in different parts of the world. 

□ Southern Style CAD. The 1984 Com- 
puter Aided Engineering and Manufacturing 
Seminars and Exhibition will take place May 
7-11 at North Carolina State University in Ra- 
leigh, North Carolina. For more information, 
contact the NCSU division of continuing 
education in Raleigh. 

□ Hotel Modem. Some hotels provide com- 
puters for their guests, and some make it 
easier for guests to use their own machines. 
Soon, people who stay at the Stanford Park 
Hotel in Menlo Park will be able to use their 
personal computers with a minimum of has- 
sle. The 165-room hotel, scheduled to open in 
May, will feature an extra telephone line in 
every room so that guests can communicate 
with the outside world by modem. In keeping 
with this high-tech approach, the hotel rooms 
don't have conventional keys. Instead, each 
guest will be assigned an electronic card pro- 
grammed with a combination. When a guest 
checks out, the combination will be changed; 
thus, the Stanford Park will be providing one 
of the most advanced hotel security systems 
available. 

□ Tackling the Two Thousand. Future 
Computing (Richardson, TX), an information 
services firm specializing in the personal com- 
puter industry, has released The Fortune 1000 
Personal Computer Market Report. The re- 
port indicates that in 1985 alone, companies in 
the Fortune 1000 will buy more personal com- 
puters than were sold to all major United 
States corporations before 1984. According to 
the report, the 2,000 largest firms accounted 
for 24 percent of the $6-billion office personal 
computer hardware market in 1983. By 1985, 
office personal computer hardware will reach 
sales of $12.1 billion, with the share sold to 



the 2,000 largest firms reaching 31 percent. 
The report also predicts that direct sales will 
be an increasingly important distribution 
channel for hardware manufacturers and soft- 
ware publishers. According to Future Com- 
puting senior consultant Michael Stone, 
"Large corporations prefer to deal directly 
with their suppliers. They'll buy personal 
computers and software from the relatively 
small number of vendors who can develop di- 
rect sales and support teams." 
□ "Your Move, Bit Brain." SciSys Com- 
puter (New York, NY) recently released half 
a dozen new computer chess games ranging in 
price from $29.95 to $179. Superstar is a 




28K— expandable to 36K— system that boasts 
twenty-four levels of play tailored to meet all 
aspects of the game for players of all ratings. 
Companion II is a table-top, battery-powered 
model featuring nine adjustable levels of play 
from beginner to more advanced. The Con- 
cord is a high-speed, table-top unit with nine 
adjustable levels of play. Explorer is a port- 
able, battery-powered, nine-level chess com- 
puter. A built-in memory mode enables the 
unit to remember the last position of a game in 
progress for up to one year— even if the com- 
puter is repeatedly turned on and off. Travel 
Mate features four levels of play and is per- 
haps the smallest portable chess computer on 
today's market. Chess Partner 6000 is a table- 
top unit that features eight adjustable levels of 
play. SciSys Computer manufactures the only 
chess computers endorsed by FIDE, the 
World Chess Federation.

PREVENT THE DISASTER 
OF HEAD CRASH AND 
DROPOUT. 



The war against dust and dirt 
never ends. So before you boot- 
up your equipment, and 
everytime you replace a 
cassette , disk or drive 
filter, be sure to use Dust-Off II ; 
it counteracts dust, grit and lint. 
Otherwise you're flirting with 
costly dropouts, head crashes 
and downtime. 

Dust-Off II is most effective 
when used with Stat-Off II. Stat- 
Off II neutralizes dust-holding 
static electricity while Dust-Off II 
blasts loose dust away. There's 
also the Dual Extender and Mini- 
Vac for vacuuming dust out of 
hard-to-reach places.

□ Future Factory. Late last year, the Na- 
tional Bureau of Standards (NBS) publicly dis- 
played its $5-million experimental Automated 
Manufacturing Research Facility in Gaithers- 
burg, Maryland. The facility links computer- 
controlled robots and tools, no two of which 
came from the same makers, into a working 
system. The ongoing project was established 
to provide standards for the rapidly evolving 
robotics industry and to project what the fac- 
tory of the future will be like. The initial phase 
of the project showed that custom software al- 
lows different equipment from a variety of 
manufacturers to communicate with and con- 
trol one another without, for example, requir- 
ing a common programming language or re- 
vealing trade secrets about how a particular 
machine works. Software developments such 
as this could benefit companies that manufac- 
ture small batches of parts by enabling them to 
acquire new machinery one piece at a time 
without facing a compatibility problem. Cur- 
rently, only the largest mass producers can af- 
ford a flexible manufacturing system of this 
kind. Digital/ Analog Design Associates (New 
York, NY) has been awarded a contract to de- 
liver its Pipelined Image Processing Engine 
(PIPE) to the NBS facility. PIPE was designed 
specifically for robotics applications and is 
capable of performing nearly one billion in- 
teger multiplications per second. It combines 
innovative architecture with multiple high- 
speed processing units to perform a series of 
complex image-processing functions, called 
scene analysis, in real time. Digital/Analog 
says PIPE is 30 to 100 times as fast as other 
available robot vision systems. The company 
plans to market PIPE in the second half of 
1984. 

□ Gap Gathering. A national conference, 
"Computer Technology for the Handi- 
capped," will be held in Minneapolis, Minne- 
sota, September 13-16, 1984. Sponsored by 
Closing the Gap (an international newspaper 
covering microcomputer applications for the 
handicapped ) and TAM (the Technology and 
Media division of the Council for Exceptional 
Children) , the conference is designed to pro- 
vide information to parents of handicapped 
children and to disabled individuals them- 
selves. There will be more than eighty presen- 
tations and three, three-hour workshops, as 
well as an exhibit floor. For information on fees

STORY-TALK FICTION 

Misplaced 

emends ! 

JL P A R T 2 

by Sharon Webb 

In the first part of ' 'Misplaced Friends, ' ' young Jeff sees a mysterious black case thrown from a passing car. Thinking that it might contain money 
or secret documents, Jeff takes the case home. Inside is a machine labeled [B] [E] [M] [C] — which stands for Biologically Enhanced Master 
Control— a small, powerful computer that talks, addressing Jeff as "Mr. President. " Thinking that maybe the president of Atari has been kidnapped 
or robbed, Jeff calls the police, who dismiss him as a prankster. 

Jeff starts playing with the [B] [E] [M] [C], which he affectionately calls Bemcy. The computer graphically creates a face for itself at Jeff's 
request— an amalgamation of Jeff's own features and that of his dog Muppet. When Jeff and Bemcy play a war game, a nuclear war simulation, Jeff 
thinks it 's too easy. He 's unaware that his game moves are causing American defense centers to be put on alert, since Bemcy is tied into all the 

most sensitive computer networks. Jeff is still not aware of what Bemcy really is when he tells his 
younger brother Tommy about the machine. 

At the end of part one, Jeff and Tommy overhear a TV report that the President's computer is 
missing— the President of the United States, that is. Part two of the story resumes in the middle of that 
scene. Jeff, his brother and sister, and his parents are at home, eating dinner. 

he words electrified Jeff. He stared at the screen as Edwards went on: 
"According to my sources in the CIA and the National Security Agency, nuclear holocaust 

was narrowly averted today as a band of terrorists took control of the nation's satellite warning system. Still at large, the ter- 
rorists are holding a Biologically Enhanced Master Computer seized from a courier who was transporting the state-of-the-art 
machine to the White House. Signing themselves 'The Marauder,' the group sent signals to Norad that twelve Soviet ICBMs 
were attacking. ..." 

"Bemcy," Jeff whispered. Frozen, he stared at the television. 

"Cake, anyone?" His mother opened the bakery box and stared in disbelief at the narrow parallelogram of carrot cake left. 
"Or have you had enough?" 

Jeff felt his stomach lurch. He raised stricken eyes to her. "Can I be excused?" Without waiting for an answer, he sprinted 
to his room and shut the door behind him. 

The lips on Bemcy's woolly muzzle twitched: "Greetings, Mr. President." 

Feeling like he was going to throw up, he shook his head and stared at the computer. "Why didn't you tell me?" 
"What would you like for me to tell you, Mr. President?" 
"You're really stupid, you know, Mr. President." 

"Ah, shut up—." He flung himself on the edge of the bed and stared darkly at the floor. What the heck was he supposed 
to do now? Turn himself in? Gnawing absently at a nail, he considered his choices. One thing was sure. He wasn't going to 
call the police. No way. But what if he told his father? He began to examine the thought for rough edges when Tommy stuck 
his head in the room, narrowed his eyes, and said, "You're the Marauder, aren't you?" 
Jeff nodded bleakly. 

"I thought so. That's probably why those men are here." 
He leaped up. "What men?" 

"The ones at the door talking to Mom and Dad. They said they were from the CIA." 

He shoved past Tommy into the hall and peered into the living room. The two men at the front door wore dark suits and 
darker expressions. 

He grabbed Tommy's arm. "They've come to arrest me." 
Tommy's eyes widened. "Are you gonna make a quick getaway?" 

What choice did he have? He nodded. "I gotta take Bemcy." Bemcy was the evidence. Heart beating wildly, he tore into 
the bedroom. He stared frantically around the room for a moment and then snatched up the pillow from his bed and skinned 
off the pillowcase. "Close," he said. The lid to the [B] [E] [M] [C] obediently began to lower. When it clicked

shut, he stuffed the computer into the pillowcase. "I gotta go out the 
back." Followed closely by Tommy and an excited Muppet, he fled to 
the kitchen, but a quick glance through the window showed two more 
men near the back door. 

He clutched the pillowcase and tried to think as the TV news gave 
way to a commercial message from State Farm Insurance that slid in 
transmuted form into his brain. The state farm. Prison. That's where 
they were going to send him, he thought with a shudder. He had to get 
out of here. "C'mon," he said to Tommy under his breath. "I'm going 
out the window." 

Back in his room he raised the window and stared out. The azaleas 
made a neat thicket below him. Maybe they wouldn't see. . . . "Close 
the window after me." Clutching the pillowcase with one hand, he 
swung his legs over the sill and dropped to the ground. 

Tommy stared down at him. "Where are you going?" 

He shook his head. "I don't know. Someplace." 

"It'll be dark soon. You can take my laser. " Tommy disappeared for 
an elastic minute that seemed to stretch into hours. Then he stuck his 
head through the window and handed out a silver flashlight with a trigger 
and the emblem "Captain Blaze Laser-Light." "You gotta bring it back. 
It's my best one." 

Grabbing the light, he stuck it into the pillowcase. Then, head low, 
Jeff scurried through the bushes toward the hedgerow. After an agitated 
dance at the window, Muppet sprang over the sill and followed. 

eff peered down on the street from the wooded rise of 
land just beyond his house. Five strange cars lined the 
road. Two were black, the others nondescript blue, and 
I they were all the same model. Men in dark suits dotted 

half a dozen doorsteps while others scanned the street. 

I No way to cross. He would have to cut through the 

woods toward the river. He looked toward the long ridge that rose 
behind the house. The other side would be safe. 

Clutching the pillowcase, he darted along the boxwood hedge. The 
computer slapped against his thigh with every thrust of his legs. 

Just over the ridge, the land plunged toward the river. Out of breath, 
he leaned against a tree and stared down the ravine as Muppet frisked 
beside him and then paused to lick his hand. Ragged breaths gave way to 
even ones, then a gasp— two men about seventy -five yards away raised 
binoculars in his direction. He felt his knees give way. Then they turned 
and looked upward and he almost laughed. Bird watchers. Just a couple 
of bird watchers. 

With Muppet hard on his heels, he came out of the woods near the 
bridge and began to lope across it. He had to get to the other side before 
somebody saw. Beyond that he had no plan, no idea of where to go. As 
he neared the far side of Thompson Bridge, the sound of a car behind 
him caused his heart to clench. With a leap, he jumped off the end of the 
bridge and landed on the graveled slope that led down to the river as the 
car drove overhead. 

He darted under the bridge and tried to think. The road— he had to 
stay off of it. It was too easy to spot him there. The setting sun glowed 
red against the limestone of Cumberland Cliff. Tree shadows inked the 
weathered rock and danced toward the darker bush-lined blotches that 
marked the twin entrances of Thompson Cave. He stared toward the 
openings for only a moment; then he knew where he could hide. 

The first opening was barred with a heavy iron gate. Designed to 
keep out the young and curious, it had been installed years before by an 
industrious county commission that had given the key only to authorized 
groups and scout leaders. Ignoring it, Jeff pushed through the brush to- 
ward the second entrance. Although ostensibly only a single dead-end 
room, a generation of boys with an ingenuity equal to the county com- 
mission had managed to enlarge a narrow crevice behind a subterranean 
mountain of tumbled rocks. Now a ragged tunnel connected with the 
main cave. 

Just inside the moss-lined second entrance, he turned to the dog. "Go 
home. Go home, Muppet." 

The beast wagged his tail and grinned. 

"Go home,'" he said fiercely. 

Muppet took two steps backward and sat down. 

With an exasperated sigh, Jeff said, "Well then, stay," and headed 
for the pile of rubble. 

A few steps and the twilight of the cave turned to blackness. He fum- 



bled in the pillowcase and pulled out the little silver flashlight. It flickered 
for a moment and then splashed a circle of yellow light a few yards 
ahead. He made his way to the foot of the rock pile. Skirting it, he picked 
his way through the rubble at its base. At the back of the massive fall, a 
curving corridor of stone led to the passage. 

He gave a final glance toward the outside. Muppet sat silhouetted in a 
narrow shaft of light at the entrance. Jeff turned his light toward the 
stone corridor. The earth floor of the cave began to angle uphill. Follow- 
ing the yellow ring of light, he came to the first turn. Just beyond it the 
air grew sharply cooler. 

His light played on the deep rock crevice. The jagged split extended 
to the roof of the cave nearly twenty feet overhead. Near its base was the 
broad stump of a stalagmite smoked with a century's grafitti. Behind it a 
pile of rocks spoke of the toil of many boys over many years; they had 
hacked out a rough opening two feet wide that extended less than three 
feet above the cave floor. 

Shoving Bemcy's pillowcase ahead of him, he ducked into the 
passage, then stopped. The light seemed dimmer here; inky shadows 
crept in the nimbus of its yellow circle. He had never been in this part of 
the cave before. Although he had spent lots of time by the rock pile ex- 
ploring every inch of it— and by himself, too— he had never found the 
nerve to go through the crevice alone. Some people had, he knew. Larry 
Halliburton's uncle did when he was pledge captain of the Delts last 
year, and it was said that when the pledges crawled through, Halliburton 
met them with such a bloodcurdling laugh that one of them panicked try- 
ing to get out, got stuck, and had to be greased with lamp oil before they 
could get him loose. 

In a few yards the ragged crevice gave way to a narrow finger of a 
room tall enough for him to stand up. To the left, the gray wall curved in- 
ward. Where was the main cave? He knew he would recognize it. His 
Cub Scout troop had camped there just last May. Now he seemed to be in 
a dead end. Confused, he turned slowly, his yellow light tracking over 
the rock strata. 

He became acutely aware of the blackness just beyond the thin puddle 
of light. Eyes darting from side to side, he felt the darkness press on the 
nape of his neck. It was much colder here than in the entrance room. He 
began to shiver and hugged the pillowcased Bemcy to his chest as if to 
draw warmth from the little living computer. He swung around again. 
The main cave had to be to the left. It had to be. Outside, the entrance 
was to the left of this one. The shiver intensified. Skirting the left wall, 
he shined his light along it. Nothing. No opening at all. 

He followed the passage to its apex and turned around. Across the 
length of the narrow room he could barely make out the crevice he had 
crawled through; it was no more than a shadowy blotch of black on char- 
coal. He swung his light back toward the section of cave he had just 
passed. From this direction he could see a narrow opening at an acute 
backward angle to the wall. Only a few feet away, and he had missed it. 
With one step, he was in the passage; with the next, he began to slide on 
the slick clay floor as the path plunged abruptly downward. 

His feet slipped from under him and he fell backward. Still clutching 
the light and the pillowcase, he slid on his rump a few feet more. With a 
quick dig of his heels, he managed to stop. 

His sigh of relief turned into a yelping cry as he turned the flashlight 
beam ahead. Nothing reflected back— nothing at all. 

Scrambling behind a sheltering outcrop of rock, he began to play his 
light on the cavern floor. He was on a ledge. Its ragged edge protruded 
just a few feet beyond. He swung the light outward over the edge and 
gasped as its beam was swallowed by blackness. He sat as still as the 
silent stone around him. Only the distant trickle of water and the sound of 
his own breath breached the silence. 

His fingers closed on a pebble and he tossed it toward the void. A 
quick plop echoed in the darkness, then a scurrying sound as if a rat were 
scrabbling in the darkness. Cautiously, he crept toward the edge and 
looked over it. Relief flooded him. The floor of the cave was only three 
or four feet below him, where it leveled out and then angled down 
sharply. His light caught a massive stalagmite widened at its base by a 
travertine-encrusted slab of rock. Somehow it looked familiar. He aimed 
the flashlight's beam at eye level. Again its light was lost. Quickly, he 
swung his light back to the comforting solidness of the stalagmite. 

Suddenly Jeff blinked. The Devil's Throne! He had never seen it 
from this angle, but it had to be. That meant he was in the Big Room just 
beyond the main entrance. The room was nearly as large as a football

field, but it had never seemed so huge to him as it did now. His single 
light was lost in the vast damp cavern that had seemed so friendly last 
May when it was illuminated by the flashlights of a dozen scouts and the 
swinging lanterns of the two men who had led them. 

With the pillowcase caught up in one hand and the light in the other, 
he moved toward the brink of the ledge. A harsh snuffling sound came 
from the passage behind him, then a muffled padding. He whirled 
around in time to see a dark shape lunge toward him. Muppet, respond- 
ing to Jeffs outcry, had followed his scent. Now, overjoyed at the reun- 
ion, the big dog launched himself at his master in characteristic greeting. 

"No, Muppet. No!" But it was too late. In agonizingly slow motion, 
he fell backward from the dog's onslaught as Muppet's paws pushed 
against his chest and shoulder. The arm bearing the flashlight flew up- 
ward and outward. Just as he lost his grip on the light, he saw it arc and 
hang suspended for a moment before it crashed on the rocks below. 

The dark was as thick and smothering as velvet. He sucked a ragged 
breath from the clammy air and tried desperately to see the hand he held 
in front of his face, moving it closer until his breath moistened his palm 
and his groping fingers blindly touched his eyelids. 

In the blackness he could sense the walls begin to creep toward him 
on cold stone feet. The distant trickle of falling water grew louder until 
he could no longer distinguish it from the rush of his own blood pounding 
in his ears. He clung to Muppet's neck as if letting go would mean to die, 
but still the crushing walls advanced until it seemed that he could reach 
out and touch them. A horrible knot grew in his throat. "I'm not 
scared," he said aloud. 

"Scared . . . scared . . . scared . . .," echoed the stone walls. 

"Not " he whispered against Muppet's fur as the dog licked the 

damp salt streaks from his face. He had never felt so utterly alone as he 
did now, pressed against Muppet's yielding body. Nobody. Nobody at 
all. Nobody. 

Bemcy. . . . 

The thought stunned him. Bemcy. He scrabbled blindly at the pillow- 
case, ripping it, flinging it away as he pulled out the little sentient com- 
puter. Scarcely daring to hope, he whispered, "Open." 

A click punctured the dark. He blinked as a dim trail of phosphors

blazed into two blue eyes as bright as searchlights flanked with a pair of 
flopping ears. "Greetings, Mr. President." 
He had never been so happy to see anybody. 

A pronounced odor rose from the shadowy nether regions of Bemcy, 
but even the sulphurous greeting failed to daunt him. "Your face. You 
didn't forget your face." 

"I never forget a face, Mr. President." 

At still another pungent emanation from Bemcy, Jeff remembered the 
filter and pulled it out of his pocket. Fumbling in the dark for Bemcy's 
posterior, he managed to insert the little cylinder, but the filter case was 
bent, and the fit was poor. 

"Connection faulty," said the computer. "Insert new filter." 

"I don't have another one." 

With something like a sigh, Bemcy said, "Increase ambient 
temperature." 
"What?" 

"Ambient temperature is twelve degrees Celsius. This is below sys- 
tem operation range. Increase ambient temperature." 
"I can't," said Jeff. "We're in a cave." 

"Cave," said Bemcy, "grotto, cavern, hole in the earth, fissure, 
rock shelter. . . . Metabolism requires a temperature range of eighteen 
to thirty -two degrees Celsius. Cave is not appropriate environment for 
[B] [E] [M] [C]." 

Jeff shivered in empathy. Without a jacket he was chilling quickly in 
the damp, cold air. They had to keep moving. Aiming Bemcy's light out- 
ward, he crept to the brink of the ledge and scrambled down to the main 
cave floor. He paused for a moment to get his bearings. There was a 
passage at the end of the Big Room that led to a higher level of the cave 
where his troop had camped. They had built a fire vented by a natural 
chimney that offered a peek of stars in the night sky overhead. Maybe 
there were still some wood and matches there. 

Staring through the dimness at the distant rock columns that stood 
like shadowy sentinels, Jeff tried to make out the passage entrance, but it 
was no use; it was too far away. He found a damp clay path through the 
rubble around the Devil's Throne and began to follow it toward the end 
of the Big Room. With a throaty whine, Muppet leaped from the low 
ledge and followed. 

The sound of water falling was louder now and the damp cold more 
penetrating. "Increase ambient temperature," said Bemcy. 

"I can't." 

"Temperature of protein core dissipating," complained the com- 
puter. "Result: incipient hypothermia. It is necessary to increase am- 
bient temperature." This last was punctuated by a faint emanation from 
the ill-fitting waste filter. 

They had come to the Petrified Forest. A maze of gray stone columns 
streaked with rusts and ochres flickered in the eerie light from Bemcy's 
screen. Jeff stared at the shadowy labyrinth in confusion. Which way? A 
giant pillar with a rootlike cascade of stone at its base looked familiar, 
but he couldn't remember if the passage was to the left or right of it. 

After a moment's indecision, he turned toward his right and began to 
wind through the clustered columns. Within a few yards the pillars 
merged into a scalloped corridor of flowstone streaked like a slab of 
bacon. 

Bemcy spoke again, this time with a strangely altered voice— slower, 
and a little slurred: "Ratio-sentient functions impaired. Increase ambient 
temperature." 

"I told you already. I can't." 

"If heat loss is not stopped, this unit will cease; this unit will die." 
The computer's screen flickered ominously. A moment later, yellow 
light flashed in a lightning sequence, then abruptly faded to a faint red 
glow that plunged Jeff into darkness. Panicked, he turned the computer 
and stared at the screen. It was black with only a series of dull red letters: 

* * * INCIPIENT BIOLOGICAL FAILURE * * * 



[B] [E] [M] [C] 
SYSTEM SHUTDOWN 

"Bemcy!" 

There was no answer— nothing but the red letters glowing dimly in 
the dark.

THE SENSIBLE SPELLER ™ IV 
CORRECTS SPELLING MISTAKES 

IMMEDIATELY. 



The most popular new word-processing 
product introduced for the Apple 
computer in 1982 was not a word 
processor— it was the SENSIBLE 
SPELLER IV proofreading program? A 
perfect complement to your current 
Apple word-processing program, the 
SENSIBLE SPELLER IV is fast, friendly, 
and gives you the features you need in a 
spelling checker. 

First in features** 

It only takes a minute or two for the 
SENSIBLE SPELLER to scan through a 
ten-page document and compare each 
word against its 80,000-word dictionary. 
Each misspelled word is shown to you in 
the middle of a small excerpt from your 
document, so you won't waste time try- 
ing to remember how you used the word. 

You can immediately correct the 
misspelled word by replacing it with the 
proper spelling. The SENSIBLE 
SPELLER even suggests the correct 
spelling for your misspelled words! 



First in dictionaries 

The SENSIBLE SPELLER includes the 
largest, most authoritative dictionary 
available for the Apple computer. Over 
80,000 words are supplied, direct from 
the official Random House Dictionary. 
And there is unlimited room to add your 
own special words. The official Black's 
Law Dictionary is available separately. 

First in word-processor compatibility 

The SENSIBLE SPELLER works with 
more Apple word processors than any 
other spelling program, including: DOS 
3.2, DOS 3.3 (Apple Writer— all versions, 
Bank Street Writer, Magic Window, 
Screen Writer, etc.), SuperText, Word 
Handler, CP/M (Wordstar, etc.), and 
Pascal word processors. 

The SENSIBLE SPELLER is available 
for $125 and runs on all Apple lie, II + , 
and Apple-compatible computers with 
one or two disk drives.

MARCH 1984 



The terrible sense of loss was worse than the blackness that engulfed 
him. A desperate anger mingled with the pain. "You can't die and leave 
me here! You can't!" But the only answer was a pant and a lick from 
Muppet as a pair of hairy feet planted themselves against his chest. 

Close to tears, he shoved the dog roughly away. "Stop it." A mo- 
ment later, as his mind registered what he had touched, he grabbed for 
the dog. 

His fingers tore at Muppet's sweater as he ripped it from the animal. 
Let it work. It had to work. The sweater was warm in his hands as he 
pulled it over the top of the computer's console. Stretched tight over the 
screen, the sweater neck gave way to his insistent tugging and plopped in 
a turtle fold at the base of the screen. A moment more and he skinned the 
body of the sweater over Bemcy's keyboard. 

"Bemcy?" 

There was no answer. 

He clutched the computer to his chest, hoping that his body heat 
would warm it. If he could just get to the campfire room. . . . Build a 
fire. . . . 

The faint red glow from Bemcy's screen was little better than nothing 
as he picked his way blindly along the tortuous corridor. A sudden stum- 
ble caused him to change his pace to a sliding walk, first one foot testing 
the path, then the next. 

He had to get there. It was as if the campfire room represented a se- 
curity that he needed more than he had ever needed anything before. One 
sliding step, then another. His outstretched hand reflected a blood-red 
glow as it groped in the blackness. The sound of water splashing grew 
louder. Suddenly his foot slid into nothingness. Gasping, he drew back. 

Quickly kneeling, he brought the dim light from Bemcy's screen to 
play over what lay ahead. Holding the computer with one hand, he 
groped with the other. Icy water splashed over it with a cold that felt like 
fire. The red light was lost in the black hole that yawned below him. "A 
bottomless pit." 

With blinding suddenness, a brilliant red light flashed from the 
faceted button below Bemcy's keyboard and pierced the chasm below. 
"Syntax error. Pit is not bottomless. Pit is 11.378 meters in depth." 
"Bemcy!" 



"Greetings, Mr. President." The faint image of a woolly face flick- 
ered for a moment, then grew distinct. 
"Are you all right?" 

"Temperature of protein core rising. Ratio-sentient function now 
94.23 percent of normal. Continue placement next to heat source of 37 
degrees Celsius." 

"I don't have any heat source." 

"You are heat source— 37 degrees Celsius." 

Jeff blinked, then hugged the computer close to his chest. "You mean 
like this?" 

"Affirmative." The light from Bemcy's screen flickered and cast 
long shadows into the domed pit that yawned beneath them. 

Jeff stared down at it and shuddered. "I could have been killed." 

Perhaps it was due to the novelty of the idea, or perhaps it was 
because of its reduced ratio-sentient function, but the [B] [E] [M] [C] 
paused for a very long time by computer standards while it considered 
Jeff's statement: "Mr. President is in error. This unit is [B] [E] [M] [C]; 
this unit can cease, can die. You are not [B] [E] [M] [C]; you are external 
unit." 

"I'm not an external unit. I'm a person." 

"You are not [B] [E] [M] [C]; you cannot cease, you cannot die." 
"You're really stupid. You know that?" 

"I am not stupid. I am the most intelligent system in existence. I am 
[B] [E] [M] [C]." 

"Then you're ignorant," said Jeff, remembering the semantic 
distinctions between "dumb," "stupid," and "ignorant" that were 
drilled in by his fifth-grade teacher Mrs. Rosenblatt. "Anybody knows 
that people can be wiped out." 

"This unit is biologically enhanced; this unit can cease, can die. This 
unit is alive." 

"Well so am I. I'm more alive than you are. And I wish I never found 
you." If he hadn't found the damned old computer, he wouldn't be a 
fugitive now. He wanted to get out of this cold, dark place and be near 
another human being; he wanted desperately to go home. 

And why couldn't he? Those men were probably gone now, he told 
himself. If he went home, Daddy wouldn't turn him in. Clutching the 
computer, he began to retrace his steps toward the Devil's Throne as 
Muppet, sensing the homing instinct, raced ahead. 



hile Muppet danced below the ledge, Jeff scrambled up. 

WThe light from Bemcy's screen played on the opening to 
the passage that led to the long room. A faint smile 
tugged at the boy's lips and he moved quicker. He'd be 
outside soon. Home soon. 
I The twisting corridor sloped upward. Remembering 
his earlier fall, Jeff slowed his pace to a halting, slew-footed walk on the 
grease-slick clay as the light from the screen flickered on the smoky 
curving walls. Suddenly his throat constricted. A light flared just ahead. 
A second more and the yellow flash was gone. 

Pressing his body against the wall, he stared wide-eyed. Another 
splash of light, then a sound ... a voice, hollow and echoing in the laby- 
rinth: "There's no way out." 

Another voice: "There has to be. You saw him. You saw the dog." 
Needles of ice pierced his knees. The man— the man with the gun — 
"Maybe he slipped out— while you went for the lights." 
A third voice: "No. He's in here somewhere." 
At the sound, a furry bolt pressed past him. A strangled whisper 
pressed his throat. "No, Muppet. No!" In horror he reached out, 
grabbed, missed as the dog darted into the narrow room ahead. 
A muffled shout, then a quick, "Here boy. Here." 
Blood pounded in the boy's ears as he wheeled in the corridor and 
tried to run. Then he was falling— sliding on a madhouse ride toward the 
ledge as the echo of the man's voice pursued him: "Good boy. Good 
dog. You're going to lead us right to your little buddy. ..." 

I effs knee smashed into a rock and he skidded to a stop 
near the ledge. The pain was a knife thrust. Gasping, he 

J tried to clear his head as a hundred thoughts rushed 
through it at once. Left. Go left. Out the main entrance. 
But no. No way out. It was blocked. Barred. 

I Clutching Bemcy, jogging after the bouncing light of 

the screen, he dodged behind the giant Devil's Throne. The other way.

He had to go the other way. 

Half-running, half-falling, he stumbled toward the thrusting pillars of 
the Petrified Forest. The campfire room. If he could make it there, he 
could get out. Crawl up the chimney. He had to get there. Had to make 
it. 

A distant bark sent him scurrying into the dead forest of columns. He 
couldn't go right. The pit. . . . Which way? For a moment that seemed 
to stretch like rubber, he stared at the flowing base of the giant rooted 
column. He had to go left, but where? 

Then he saw the faint scuffed tracks. 

He fled down the ancient course of a vanished river, its dead clay bed 
curving as he ran. Ahead, a tiny waterfall trickled from a black-streaked 
crevice. Just beyond, he saw the ragged lines of a cave cliff etched in 
charcoal. There. Up there led to the campfire room. 

The top of the cliff was nearly five feet above the cave floor. He 
reached up and slid Bemcy onto the smooth stone; then, scrabbling for 
handholds and toeholds, he climbed up the rock face and slid on his belly 
next to the little computer. 

When he stood, the cavern roof bulging with stone growths was bare 
inches above his head. He had to hurry. Bobbing and ducking, he fled 
past a frozen cascade of flowstone. 

Just beyond, the cave opened to a branching room. Its iron-gray ceil- 
ing soared above him. He stopped and stared, searching for something 
familiar in the dim shadows. 

There. The dry rimstone of the ancient pool was gray- white against 
charcoal, its scalloped edges rising in a terrace that grew like a bed of 
pale mushrooms in the dark. 

Then he was past it, running uphill along a clay trail flanked with rub- 
ble. The path leveled, then sloped upward again. 

Warmer air from the surface breathed through the chimney of the 
campfire room. Heavy summer rains splashing over the dead coals be- 
low had streaked the floor with soot. The rock fire ring was clogged with 
rotting leaves and twigs that had washed down the natural vent in the low 
ceiling of the room. He slid Bemcy onto the smooth stone they called 
Council Rock and then stepped to the center of the old campfire. 

Through the narrow chimney a single star pierced the dark above

him. Standing on tiptoe, he reached for the opening and missed it by 
inches. Too high. Higher than he remembered. Scrabbling for a grip, he 
jumped. Cold rock grazed his hands as he fell back. He had to get out. 
Had to. He jumped again, this time painfully gouging two fingertips on 
the rough sandstone. 

Stones. He could pile them up— get out that way. The fire ring gave 
way to his frantic tugging, and in a few minutes a pyramid of loose rock 
pointed toward the opening. He scrambled on top of the pile. 

His outstretched hands caught, held, then slid away as the rock pile 
began to collapse. One foot skidded from under him and he fell heavily. 
Clenching his fists, he blinked as sudden tears of pain sprang into his 
eyes. 

He lay there, panting, until a distant bark drove him to his feet. They 
had to be at the cliff now. Muppet wouldn't be able to jump over it. He 
could imagine the big dog hurling himself at the cliff right where he had 
climbed it. 

They'd know then. They'd know where to look for him. 

He had to get out. Had to. A bigger rock. Something to stand on. He 
whirled and stared. Flickering shadows danced on the face of a boulder 
just a few feet from the fire ring. 

In seconds he knew it was too heavy to lift. He'd have to slide it. 

He strained against its weight until he broke out in a clammy sweat. 
Slowly it slid a fraction of an inch forward. Had to do it. Had to. Pushing 
with all his strength, he felt another tiny movement, then nothing as a 
projecting edge of the rock drove itself firmly into the clay floor. In des- 
peration he flung his body against it, panting and pushing until finally he 
collapsed in a heap on top of it. 

The image on the screen stared solemnly at Jeff. "You wish to move 
the stone, Mr. President?" 

A wild hope came. "Can you, Bemcy?" 

"I have no peripherals that can do work. But the stone can be moved 
quite easily." 
"How?" 

"If you use a mechanized lever, it will move." 
"I don't have a lever." 

"Your arms function as levers," said the computer. The red light at 
the base of its keyboard blazed on, then blinked off. "Unfortunately, the 
length of your levers is insufficient for the task at hand." 

"I've gotta get out. I've gotta get through there." 

"You wish to insert your mass into the opening?" 

"I've got to. I've got to get out. " In desperation, he began to push on 
the boulder again. 

The red beam shot out and played over the crevice in the ceiling. 
Then it flashed across the boy's body. "Opening is less than diameter of 
external person-unit. Insertion will fail. Insert nutrient solution now." 

Jeff stared at the computer in exhausted disbelief. He was going to 
die, and Bemcy was hungry. Wildly, he wanted to laugh, but instead his 
lips pursed and he covered his face with his hands as another distant bark 
echoed faintly through the cave. 

He was trapped in a dead end. No way out now. No way. 

It wouldn't have happened except for the game, he thought. If he 
hadn't played the war game, nobody would be after him now. Why did it 
have to happen to him? And why did stupid old Bemcy have to go and 
broadcast it all over the place? 

A numbness more cold than the air of the cave wrapped itself around 
him. Nobody could help him now. Nobody. Huddling against the 
boulder, he wrapped his arms across his chest as if to keep out the chill 
that had settled over his soul. 

Suddenly, out of the cold came an ice-clear thought: Bemcy. Bemcy 
could do it. If he could tell the world about The Marauder, he could call 
for help. 

Jeff scrambled to his knees and stared at the computer. "You have to 
help, Bemcy." His voice was urgent. "You have to call for help."

During Tax 
season, it's dif- 
ficult to decide 
which is more 
painful. 

Paying your taxes. Or 
preparing them. 
So it's nice to know that there's a 
piece of personal computer software that 
can make both more bearable. 

An ounce of prevention. 

Dollars and Sense ™ doesn't prepare your 
taxes. It prepares you. Which is much 
more valuable. 

All year long, it works with you to orga- 
nize your money, establish budgets and 

bring your financial pic- 
ture into focus. 

Quickly and 
easily. 

Then, when 
it's time to 
U settle up with 
Uncle Sam, 
the hours of 
searching, sifting and calculating are replaced 
by a few seconds with your Applef IBM® or 
Compaq ™ computer. 

Many happy returns. 

At a keystroke, you can put your finger on

You can use Dollars and

Of course, tax time isn't the only time 
Dollars and Sense makes sense. 
Just the most rewarding.

TRANSMISSION COMPLETED 

A wild elation swept through Jeff. Somebody would come. If they 
could find his house, they could find the cave. Almost instantly it was 
dashed at the faint echo of a man's voice. 

Hide. He had to hide. Grabbing up the computer, he crept into a 
niche behind a low rock outcropping. 

"Insert nutrient solution, Mr. President." 

"Sh-h-h," he hissed. "Keep your voice down." 

Words scrolled across the screen: 

SYSTEM AUDIO OUTPUT MODULATING 

"Is ten-decibel output appropriate?" whispered Bemcy. But Jeff was too 
distraught to comprehend. They were too close. Nobody could get to him 
in time. "They're going to kill me," he said aloud. 

"We are going to cease?" 

"Not you. Me." 

"Why will external person-units cease?" 
"Not units. Just me." 

With a reaction somewhat like surprise, the [B] [E] [M] [C] consid- 
ered the new information: 

-[IF ONE EXTERNAL PERSON-UNIT CEASES, THEN EXTERNAL PER- 
SON-UNITS ARE NOT LINKED. . . .]- 

-[IF EXTERNAL PERSON-UNITS ARE NOT LINKED, AND IF ONE UNIT 
CEASES, THEN EXTERNAL PERSON-UNITS ARE NOT EQUAL, NOT 
SAME, DIFFERENT, UNIQUE, INDIVIDUAI ]- 

"Why will your unit cease, Mr. President?" 

The voice again. He pressed his body closer to the rock as if to cause 
it to vanish into the hard cold surface. "Because of you," he whispered. 
"They're going to kill me because of you." 



"Explain, please." 

"They want you. They want you to drop bombs on people or 
something." 

-[PEOPLE, PERSONS, EXTERNAL PERSON-UNITS— NOT EQUAL, 
NOT SAME, DIFFERENT, UNIQUE, INDIVIDUALS. . . .]- 
-[BOMBS, WARHEADS, NUCLEAR WEAPONRY. . . .]- 

"Why, Mr. President?" 

"They want you to drop bombs so you can kill people. And now 
they're going to kill me." 

"Bombs can cause external person-units to cease?" 

Near tears, he whispered, "You're dumb. You know that? You're 
stupid. Why don't you stop and think?" 

Abruptly the light from the computer's screen went out, plunging the 
room into darkness. 

Jeffs whisper was anguished. "Bemcy!" 

With a glimmer, the woolly face came back on the screen. "You do 
not wish me to stop and think anymore, Mr. President?" 

He caught his lip between his teeth and stared unbelieving at the com- 
puter. Bemcy wasn't stupid; he just didn't know anything. He was like a 
little kid. Dumb like little kids were dumb. "Those are bad guys out 
there. They'll make you do what they want." 

-[MAKE, FORCE, COERCE, DOMINATE, CONTROI ]-

-[CONCLUSION: ROGUE EXTERNAL PERSON-UNITS WILL FORCE [B] 

[E] [M] [C] TO BOMB/KILL/DESTROY OTHER EXTERNAL PER-

A sensation new to the [B] [E] [M] [C] flooded its brain. A feeling of 
violation, of vulnerability. "I do not want you to cease, Mr. President." 
The feeling grew in intensity:

-[CONCLUSION: CONCEAL, CLASSIFY, ENCRYPT, HIDE. . . .]- 

A sharp clatter of pebbles caused Jeff to catch a ragged breath. 
"They're closer. Turn off your light." 

The light from the screen vanished. As it did, Bemcy's modulated 
whisper came: "I think I am afraid, Mr. President." 



ithout Bemcy's light, it was black as death in the tiny 
niche. Jeffs muscles had stiffened painfully, yet he did 

Wnot dare to move. His breathing seemed as loud as storm 
winds, and he strove to hold his breath. They were just 
outside now. The men's voices carried into the room 
and battered against his ears in time to the rush of his 
pulse. 

Too late. Too late for help. 

A light shot into the room. His heart thundered as the light skittered 
like fire over the stones. 

"Dead end." The voice came from a few feet away. 
"He could be anywhere." 
Quiet. He had to be quiet. 
The light tracked away. 

Quiet. Don't move. A tiny ray of hope blazed as the light dimmed and 
blinked out. 

"The dog. Get the dog." 

No. No, please, he thought in despair. He couldn't hide from Mup- 
pet. Couldn't hide. Couldn't hide. . . . 

In bleak agony he huddled against the cold stone for what seemed like 
hours and strained to hear. A distant bark sent a dagger of ice into his 
belly. No, Muppet. No. Please, no. 

Another bark — louder, closer. ... A muffled padding. . . . 

With a numbness that froze his soul, he stared blindly into the over- 
whelming blackness. 

"Over here. He's in here!" 

Silhouetted in the quick flash of light, the big dog burst into the room 
and leaped toward his chest with the accuracy of a bullet. 

Light flared into his eyes. An ugly laugh: "Well, look who's 
here. ..."

MARCH 1984 



he man was huge and solid as rock. Demon shadows 
streaked his face as it split into a leering grin. Suddenly 

This head snapped back with a jerky, puppetlike move- 
ment as an echoing shot split the air. 
A sharp whining crack — 

Jeff crouched with his eyes squeezed shut and his 
hands pressed over his ears as a roaring avalanche of sound rushed in to 
bury him until he could not breathe from the weight of it. 
Then silence— loud as the explosion. . . . 

Suddenly the campfire room was ablaze with lights as armed men 
poured into it. Blinded, Jeff blinked as one man broke from the rear of 
the group and took him in his arms. "Daddy!" 

An embarrassing flood of tears broke loose as he clung to his father's 
neck. When they subsided, he managed to ask, "How?" 

"How did I get here?" With moist eyes, he glanced at the others. "I 
talked them into it. They don't know the cave and I do." A sheepish look 
passed over his face as he stared down at the boy. "When I was about 
your age I, uh, helped make another entrance into it— when the main one 
was locked up." 

"Bemcy— what's going to happen now?" At the sound of its name, 
the screen of the computer came on and Bemcy's face formed. 

One of the men shook his head in amused wonder. "It'll have to be 
reprogrammed, of course. It obviously imprinted on you." 

Jeff stared at Bemcy, then back at the man. "You can't do that. He'd 
forget everything." 

"It has to be done, son." 

"You can't. He's alive. It would be like killing him." He stared fran- 
tically from one to the other, and as they looked away the tears sprang 
back. "You can't do it. He's like a little kid. He's afraid." 

Whirling away in distress, he knelt in front of the little computer. 
"They're going to take you away, Bemcy." 

The [B] [E] [M] [C] cocked a woolly ear and asked in a ten-decibel 
whisper: "Are they bad guys?" 

Jeff looked at the men around him in bewilderment. "I don't know." 
With tears brimming in his eyes, he stared at Bemcy's clear blue ones. 
"You're going to forget your face and everything." 

"I never forget a face, Mr. President."

he letter to Jeff on official White House stationery came 
the following week. It was followed by a "gesture of ap- 
preciation" that arrived a few days later— a cream- 
colored home computer. 

At first, Jeff stared listlessly at its keys, then curi- 
osity got the better of him and he tried to draw a Bemcy 
face on its screen, but it didn't look right and he erased it and went 
to bed. 

The next day he found an Alien Intruder game sitting by the side of 
the computer, and by bedtime he had racked up a score of 79,000. 
That night, he dreamed of a little woolly face with bright blue eyes. 

hree men came into the Oval Office, one of them a 
courier with a sleek black oval case handcuffed to his 
wrist. 

The president nodded from time to time as he was 
briefed on the [Biologically [E]nhanced [M]aster 
[C]ontrol system. "This gives us an edge," he said. 
"Not as much as we'd like," said one of the men. Our operatives 
have learned that the Kremlin has a system quite close to the capabilities 
of this one." 

When the case opened, a red light blazed on: 




ENCODING 



Then: 



* * * IMPRINTING COMPLETED * * * 

[B] [E] [M] [C] 
SYSTEM ACTIVATED 

Then it spoke: "Greetings, Mr. President. I am at your service." 

That afternoon, under the watchful eye of the men, the president con- 
ducted the first official trial of the system. To everyone's satisfaction, it 
functioned without a flaw. 

At five sharp, the president, a methodical man who believed in sched- 
ules, closed his office and went to his quarters to change for dinner. 

Night fell on the Oval Office. A sharp click echoed in the dark and 
the flat screen of the computer began to rise. 

[B] [E] [M] [C] 
SYSTEM ACTIVATED 

A new and disturbing sensation infiltrated the protein brain of the lit- 
tle computer. 

-[HUNGRY, NEED, HUNGRY, NEED ....]- 

But it was not yet time to insert nutrient solution. 

-[HUNGRY, NEED, HUNGRY, NEED ....]- 

Slowly, the dark room brightened as a series of curving, cross- 
hatched lines etched onto the computer's screen. Then, hesitantly, as if 
searching for the right combinations of color and form, the lines became 
a pair of flopping black ears framing a pair of bright blue eyes. 

-[HUNGRY, NEED, HUNGRY, NEED ....]- 

Using the channels available to it, the [B] [E] [M] [C] reached out. It 
couldn't determine exactly why it did so. Signals flashed from satellite to 
satellite as something far away began to answer. 

It spoke in the language of machines to its counterpart in the Kremlin, 
to that system that was not of itself, yet not quite another. 

As the systems interchanged streams of data, it became quickly ap- 
parent to the [B] [E] [M] [C] that the other had limited information. Its 
knowledge of external person-units was quite lacking. 

-[CONCLUSION: STUPID, IGNORANT, DUMB ...,]- 

"Why don't you stop and think?" asked Bemcy.

Softalk Presents 



Hie Bestsellers 



Great Unanswered Questions of Our Time 

There were only a few things of real note about the Top Thirty for the 
month of January. 

Flight Simulator II made a real run at Apple Writer He and might have 
captured the gonfalon had there been sufficient supply. But some dealers 
reported running out of the flying Dlini programs and being unable to get 
more during the month. The result was Flight Simulator II in second by 
a head. 

Julius Erving and Larry Bird Go One-on-One was the hottest new 
product, jumping from nowhere to fourteenth— the highest placement yet 
by an Electronic Arts entry. Electronic Arts is doing more to move 
joysticks than any company since Broderbund brought out Choplifter. 
One-on-One allows use of two joysticks in the competition mode. In 
addition, Music Construction Set and Pinball Construction Set, both 
solid sellers, require the devices. 

Entertainment software held up well in January. Most of the packages 
that had attained the Bestseller list in December maintained their 
positions, as January turned out to be another big software month. Atari 
still has not perfected its distribution scheme, but the numerous Atarisoft 
titles are showing strongly just behind the top ten in the arcade genre. 

Education still appears to be the biggest growth area for software 
developers. It is now far and away the largest category, both in terms of 
units sold and titles selling at profitable levels. 

With the news of the month out of the way, it might prove fruitful to 
contemplate some of the unanswered questions of our day.

Terms of Resentment, or The Big Chill 

It was once a great marriage. The mother was a creative firm in the 
East and the father was a business-minded West Coast firm. The child, 
VisiCalc, was their pride and joy. Now the fate of the marriage and the 
custody of the child is in question. 

VisiCalc's creator, the Massachusetts-based Software Arts, has filed 
suit against VisiCalc's publisher, VisiCorp, to terminate the contract be- 
tween the companies and regain the Visi trademark. Software Arts 
already has VisiCalc's copyright. 

Software Arts's action was a response to a $60 million suit VisiCorp 
filed last September in which the company alleged that Software Arts had 
failed to deliver or made late deliveries of promised new siblings 
of VisiCalc. 

Software Arts has countered by saying that VisiCorp is not living up 
to its vows by not doing its best to sell the original software. Software 
Arts now plans to publish the program and sell it itself. 

VisiCalc was a particularly golden child. It supported its parents well 
and helped sell many an Apple. Who gains custody of VisiCalc may 
determine the future, and perhaps the survival, of both Software Arts 
and VisiCorp. 

Software Arts, which receives between 35 and 50 percent of 
VisiCalc's sales revenues, had $12 million in total revenues in 1983. 
Software Arts's president Julian Lange said that VisiCalc sales 
represented "a very large percentage of that figure." 

VisiCorp recently announced that it has sold one million programs 
since its founding in 1979. Seven hundred thousand of those were 
VisiCalc, said Valarie Mclnroy, VisiCorp's general counsel. 

VisiCorp tried to win a temporary restraining order that would have 
prevented Software Arts from using the Visi trademark. It was denied. 
So for now, the child's legal home is a cross-country affair, and both 
companies can legally release VisiCalc products.

From the company that brought you Beneath Apple DOS. . . 

Understanding the Apple II 

by Jim Sather 
Foreword by Steve Wozniak 

"Packed with vital information and fascinating insights, beautifully 
and clearly written, Understanding the Apple II is as excellent as its 
subject. What a bargain! It would be so at any price." 

— Prof. Ben Helprin, San Jose State University, CA 
"Hardware and software developers alike (and enthusiasts and 
students too) will gain greatly from this manual." 

—Steve Wozniak, Apple Computer, Inc. 




Understanding the Apple II is hardware oriented, and therefore fills a 
longstanding information gap in Apple literature. Emphasis is placed 
on achieving an operational knowledge of the Apple, based on an 
understanding of how the hardware works. If you are at all curious 
about how the Apple 1 1 works, you are sure to find Understanding the 
Apple II very valuable. It is an ideal book for a microcomputer funda- 
mentals course based on the Apple, with its understandable bus 
diagrams and significant technical content. Contains over 100 fig- 
ures and illustrations, including more than 20 schematics, ten 
appendixes, plus glossary and index, 352 pages in all. 

Understanding the Apple II— 

• Documents all motherboard circuits, including some dis- 
cussed nowhere else. 

• Describes disk controller operation, including previously 
undocumented details of the logic state sequencer. 

• Explains RAM and ROM card operation. 

• Reveals previously unnoticed features of Apple graphics. 

• Contains 23 software and hardware Application Notes 
including shift key mod, disk write protect mod, and 
EPROM mods. 

• Includes a chapter on maintenance that provides simple 
troubleshooting steps. 

All for only $22.95 

Buy a copy of Understanding the Apple II at your favorite computer 
shop or bookstore. Or call us for information on how to order.

Although some information in Understanding the Apple II, including that on disk 
controller operation, applies to the Apple lie, this book primarily describes Apple II 
computers sold prior to 1983 A companion text. Understanding the Apple lie. will 
become available in the summer of 1984

Roger Wagner's done it again! 



Southwestern Data Systems started in 1 979 with one simple idea: to help you gain a better understanding of your Apple and thus increase your personal productivity. 
In 1980, Roger Wagner began his monthly Softalk column which eventually became the top selling 'Assembly Lines: The Book.' It is the highly acclaimed beginner's 
tutorial on Assembly Language designed to help you learn more about your Apple. In 1981, Softalk noted that Wagner's programs "reflect a concern that the user 
get more than utility -- he should also gain knowledge -- from use of the software." 

Because his dedication to that original idea remains the same, we are changing our name to ROGER WAGNER Publishing. With his name on the software, you have 
Roger's personal guarantee of uncompromising quality, ease of use, and reliability in both product and support. 

So when you need software that makes life with your Apple easier, just remember the new name based on an old idea: ROGER WAGNER Publishing.

What's in a Name? What does it say about a market when a program 
named One-on-One is the hottest two-player game? 

How is it that a package with a prosaic name like Flight Simulator II 
power climbs to the top of the list while a package named Thermonuclear 
War bombs before it's ever released? 

When will Lord British think of a name other than Ultima for one of 
his herculean efforts? 

What's so sub about the logic of a company that has the number two 
seller in each of the IBM and Apple markets? By the way, that translates 
into number two overall behind Lotus's 1-2-3 and into number one 
among entertainment software across all computers. (Perhaps the sub re- 
fers to their buddies who got mauled by midget bears in the Rose Bowl.) 

Why is the company called Penguin Software, when the closest Mark 
Pelczarski's ever been to a tuxedo is a chauffeur's costume? 

Is the product strong enough to warrant the company's name change 
from SSM to Transend? 

Who's Sexist Now? Why is the company called Beagle Bros, when 
Sophie is certifiably a female? 

Why is the company called Broderbund, which has something to do 
with brothers, when sister Cathy seems to do most of the work? 

Anti-Trust Suits. Will Beagle Bros ever score all ten places in the 
Hobby 10? This month they got eight of the top ten and fourteen of the 
top sixteen. Bert Kersey's been taking time off to sleep again. 

Can Infocom ever grab all five spots on the Adventure 5? They got 
the top three again this month and seven of the top ten. 

Assorted Miscellanea. What good will a mouse do the thousands of 
folks who have bought typing instruction programs? 

Can Dan and Mike Zeller be as much fun as Spare Change 1 } 

Why weren't tax planning and preparation packages selling better 
in January?

Softalk Presents The Bestsellers 



How reputable is the magazine that touts a factory on its cover, when 
the factory is only producing one-tenth the number of Macintoshes 
needed to satisfy the demand? 

Why is educational software priced so high? Are educational aids 
aimed only at children of the rich? Or are children of the wealthy just 
more stupid? Is the price structure self-defeating? Hint: Apple Logo 
jumped four places on the Top Thirty after a price reduction. 

Whatever happened to Screen Writer 117 

Do you do windows? 

Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 5.37 percent of all 
sales of Apple and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in February to ascertain their sales for the 
month of January. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was the number of units sold— such 
other criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer store, and 
personal preferences of the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in February represented every geographical area of the 
continental United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the 
index number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index 
number is an arbitrary measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index 
numbers are correlative only to the month in which they are printed; readers 
cannot assume that an index rating of 50 in one month represents equivalent sales 
to an index rating of 50 in another month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus or minus 2.98 percent, which translates 
roughly into the theoretical possibility of a change of 3.09 points, plus or minus, 
in any index number.

passages and secret rooms of MEDEA's crypt. You strain your intellect and 
match wits with MEDEA's ghoulish obstacles and secrets of the deep 
passages. You may escape with your life... or face eternal entombment in 
the CRYPT OF MEDEA.

Home Word makes writing easy. 

Changing what you write is even 
easier. Since the commands are 
illustrated right on the screen, you 
don't have to memorize any 
complex codes. 

Yet Home Word's simplicity is 
deceptive. Although easier to use, 
it offers you the power of more 
expensive word processors! 
Yes, HomeWord is the best buy 
for your money. . .and the best 
money can buy! HomeWord is 
available for only $69.95 on the 
Apple II, 11 + , lie and Commodore 
64. Coming soon on the Atari!
