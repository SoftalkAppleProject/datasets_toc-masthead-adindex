JANUARY 1982 



Apple 




Philip Suh, of San Francisco, won September's Contest 
Contest. Apple Jumble is his winning entry. Here is his con- 
test. 

A group of ten oddly named Apple enthusiasts decided to 
get together to form an Apple users group. By a strange coin- 
cidence, the letters of each individual's name, when correctly 
rearranged, produced the name of an Apple-related product, 
either hardware, software, or firmware. 

Determine the particular product represented by each 
name and then use the letters that fall in the squares to form 
the topic for discussion at the first meeting of this newly 
formed Apple users group. 

Only the topic conceived by Philip Suh will be acceptable as 
the answer to the last part. It is possible, with so many letters, 
that other conceivable subjects could be formed. However, the 
correct answer is not at all awkward and is thoroughly rele- 
vant. So if the letters you get happen to form "computed the 
montauk islands," look further. 

Deadline for entries is February 15, 1982. Prize is $100 worth 
of your choice of goods produced by Softalk advertisers from 
your local computer store. In case of ties, the Apple random 
generator will choose the winner. Hi

The Oracle '81— Grand Prize Winner. 

Jim Ganz, who led the Oracle '81 race for 
a disk drive, scored maximally on the 
final contest to secure first place in the 
year-long contest. Ganz, from West Hart- 
ford, Connecticut, achieved a cumula- 
tive score of +42, a considerable achieve- 
ment because three of the six contest 
parts scored minus points against a per- 
fect zero. Ganz's winning entry was his 
only entry in the contest. 

Here's how he racked 'em up: Part 1 
called for the combined winning mar- 
gins of the 1981 Rose Bowl and Super 
Bowl winners. Ganz predicted 30, for a 
score of -4. Part 2 was the first of three 
chances for plus points: predicting the 
winners of the best actor, best actress, 
and best film Oscars. Ganz got them all 
for +30 points and a two-part total of +26. 
His prediction of 155 mph average speed 
for the winner of the Indy 500 was 16 off 
the mark; now he had +10 points total. 
Next came the prediction of Apple stock's 
price on July 30; Ganz's guess was $8 on 
the bullish side, for a diminishing total of 
+2. 

The crazy baseball season that almost 
wasn't caused concern that there might 
never be an answer to part 5 — naming 
the contenders and winner of the World 
Series. Ganz went with the odds on the 
teams that would play and picked up 20 
points for the effort. Like all but six other 
people who predicted a Yankee/Dodger 
confrontation, Ganz put his money on the 
Yankees. Still, his total was now a re- 
spectable — and contest leading— +22. 
Finally, Ganz had the foresight to pre- 
dict the company that would frequent the 
Softalk Top Thirty most often in 1981 for 
20 more points and the grand total of 42. 

Ganz will pick up his Disk n at A.M. 
Computer, Southington, Connecticut. 

Runnersup in the Oracle '81 were 
Charles S. Lewis (Richmond, VA), 
+23%; Michael B. Preston (Culver Qty, 
CA), +2Wb; Paul Shanberg (Moraga, 
CA) +213/8; Gary Kim (Seattle, WA) and 
Daniel Tobias (Poughkeepsie, NY), tied 
with +9^8; Cliff Josephy (Brookvllle, 
NY), +9; Unda Weintraub (New Hyde 
Park, NY), +63/^; Paul Shanberg again, 
+43/8; and Gary Kim again, 

Oracle '81— The Hidden Race. While 
Jim Ganz was enjojing a good lead on 
the overall Oracle, several companies 
suddenly found themselves vying to be 
the one everyone should have picked for 
Oracle part 6. Going into December, Ap- 
ple Computer itself was the only sub- 
stantial contender against the leader, 
and contend It did. The two appearances 
on the Top Thirty by which Apple trailed 
could have been a piece of pie to the com- 
pany that averages four to five appear- 
ances each month. But the less regular 



but very popular "small" software pub- 
lisher himg on anxiously as Apple closed 
the gap to one. But that was it, that was 
the end of the rally. And On-Line Sys- 
tems emerged as the company most fre- 
quently appeariiig in Softalk' a Top Thirty 
during 1981. On-Line's product's appear- 
ances totaled 43. After Apple's 42 came 
Sirius Software with 37, Personal Soft- 
ware with 28, Broderbund Software with 
25, and Microsoft with 22. 

Oracle '81— The Wnner, Part 6. Many 
people send multiple entries to Softalk 
contests; ironically, the random genera- 
tor has called the number of a single-en- 
try contestant almost every time. The 
winner of part 6 entered forty-three times 
for the Oracle. Did the random number 
generator change its ways? No. Winner 
EJthan Starr chose On-Line Systems as 
the answer to part 6 on only one of those 
entries, so only one was entered in the tie- 
breaking. 

Starr, who lives in Amherst, Massa- 
chusetts, will choose a prize from the Re- 
tail Computer Center in Northampton, 
Massachusetts. 

Nasty Puns 'n Anagrams Explained. 
P. Cucka (Scotch Plains, NJ) was one of 
only seventeen correct solutions to the 
crossword puzzle. Many entries came 
very close, with only one word or even 
one letter off (core for code, for exam- 
ple). Every entry wins applause, though, 
for super effort; the clues were nasty. 

Here's the answer, with the clues ex- 
plained.

Apple and Apple II Plus are traderfiarks of Apple Computer Co. j 




When Innovative Design Software introduced Pool 1. 5 to the 
Applemarket last year, the smooth animation of the compli- 
cated physics involved in simulating pool caused such a stir 
that few ever questioned what happened to Pool 1. 0 or whether 
there would be a Pool 2.0. 

There's still no answer to those questions. Instead, IDSI fol- 
lowed Pool 1.5 with Trick Shot, a package that includes sever- 
al other variations on pool as well as the ability to set up and 
test your own trick shots. 

Trick shots are the ultimate test of a pool player's ability to 
handle his cue ball ; and control of the cue ball will determine a 
pool player's fate in any contest. So trick shots have always 
served the player as a demonstration of his ability to exercise 
exacting control of the cue ball while sinking one or more ob- 
ject balls. 

Can he put enough draw on the cue ball to pull it the length 
of the table and sink object balls in opposite pockets? Can he 
sink six balls with one shot without taking any ball except the 
cue ball off a rail? 

Trick shots are the ballet of pool, combining the highest art- 
istry with the greatest skill. Trick Shot has that aura within the 
programming community. Among the innovations imple- 
mented by authors Don Hoffman, Howard de St. Germain, and 
Dave Morock are pixel-level accuracy in the placement of 
each ball on the table. 

Moving one ball one pixel on the screen seems insignifi- 
cant; but the actual differences in results from such minute 
moves are the true indication of the importance of such accur- 
acy. 

Now the authors of the program want to determine if pro- 
viding that level of accuracy was worth the effort, and they're 
willing to pay handsomely to find out. 

The Great Trick Shot Tournament should elicit the best ef- 
forts of computer owners across the country, if for no other 
reason than that the first prize is $1,000. It also gives everyone 
a chance to pit his imagination and skill against those of fellow 
computer owners. 



The object of the tournament is to consummate the most ar- 
tistic, the most imaginative, the most innovative, and the most 
difficult pool shot that can be conceived. 

In addition to the $1,000 first prize, there will be second and 
third prizes at the national level as well as a prize to the best 
entry from each state. Second prize is worth $500, third prize is 
$250 and each state winner will earn $10. 

The Trick Shot disk has several examples of fancy shots on 
it to give contestants an idea of what kind of shots might qual- 
ify for prize money. 

The tournament rules: 

1. Design one or more shots that you believe represent the 
epitome of trick shot artistry. It is not necessary that the shots 
be makable on a real pool table so long as you can execute 
them with the Trick Shot program. 

2. Save your best shots to disk and mail them to Softalk 
IDSI Trick Shot Tournament, 11021 Magnolia Boulevard, 
North Holljrwood, CA 91601. Limit the number of shots submit- 
ted to three per disk. No disks will be returned. 

3. There are no limits as to the speed, number of balls, or 
kind of English applied to the cue ball. However, only shots 
submitted that use friction settings 2 or 3 will be considered for 
prizes. 

4. Judges will consider imagination, finesse, degree of dif- 
ficulty, and the innovative aspects of the shots. Decisions of the 
judges are not subject to appeal. 

5. Overall prizes of $1,000 for first place, $500 for second 
place, and $250 for third place will be awarded. The best entry 
from each state will receive $10. The District of Columbia, all 
U.S. territories, and all foreign countries will be considered as 
one state for judging purposes. 

6. Entries must be postmarked not later than February 28, 
1982. All entries must include the following information : name, 
street address, city, state, zip code, and telephone number of 
the entrant and the name of the dealer from whom the Trick 
Shot program was originally purchased. 

Winners will be announced in the May issue of Softalk. JW 



JANUARY 1982 S Q P T A L IT 



Enthusiasm of computer owners for nationwide contests has grown tremendously in the last year, fueled partially by the regular contests ap- 
pearing in Softalk and partially by independent contests sponsored by software publishers and arcade manufacturers. 

Softalk, with rare exceptions, has kept its contests from being product oriented so as to avoid the suspicion of favoritism for one advertiser or 
product over another. 

However, the number of innovative software programs conducive to national contests continues to grow, making possible this new section of 
Softalk wherein we announce contests sponsored by other companies but administered by Softalk. 

In this issue, we have two such contests, one for the arcade addict £ind one for the pool enthusiast. The prizes are significant and the contests 
should provide you with hours of fun. 



Are Chet and David 



Sirlus Software wowed 'em in Peoria as well as Silicon Gulch when 
they published Epoch, an arcade game by Larry Miller with some of the 
smoothest animation and best three-dimensional effects yet seen on the 
Apple. 

Miller's next, Hadron, features the same high quality graphics In a 
space chase to destroy an enemy base. 

Along the way, the player sees many diverse objects In space, not the 
least of which Is a space ship carrying two chatty characters by the names 
of Chet and David. 

When the game ends, a musical theme heralds your success — or mere- 
ly your finish. 

The characters Chet and David and the musical theme are the basis for 
two separate contests sponsored by Sirlus. 

One contest asks you, In 250 words or less, to re-create the conversa- 
tion between Chet and David. What are they saying? Judging will be based 
on originality, wit, and appropriateness to the situation the duo find them- 
selves in. 

First prize is $250 for the most creative conversation. Second prize Is 
$100. Eight honorable mention prizes of one product of the entrant's choice 
from the Sirius catalog will also be awarded. 

The second contest requires that you complete the game and hear the 
musical theme. If you can Identify that theme correctly, you're in the rvin- 
nlng for a $250 first prize. All correct entries will be throvra Into Apple's 
random number generator to determine the winner. 

Drawings will also be held for a $100 second prize and eight honorable 
mention prizes of one product of the entrant's choice from the Sirius cata- 
log. 

You must submit a separate entry for each contest. The entry must in- 
clude your name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone number, 
and place of purchase of Hadron, and must reach Softalk by February 15, 
1982. 

Address the entries to Softalk Sirius Conversation or Softalk Sirius Mu- 
sic, 11021 Magnolia Boulevard, North Hollywood, CA 91601. 3M

Christmas 1981 had a pall over it for the folks at Softalk because they knew the text 
of the following message that would serve as our New Year's greeting to you, our 
readers : 

Effective immediately, Softalk will no longer be provided free to all owners of Ap- 
ple computers. 

Instead, all Apple owners will be given a one-year complimentary subscription, 
after which they will be given the option of dropping the magazine or converting ^eir 
complimentary subscription to a paid one. 

The decision to make the change in policy was an easy one. Economics dictated 
that Softalk either find alternate sourcei§ of revenue or cease publishing. 

Living with that policy change has been somewhat more difficult. Because the fact 
is that we at Softalk have genuinely enjoyed giving each of you the best magazine we 
could produce each month. In a way, seeing the first issues off the press made each 
month seem a little imbued with the Christmas spirit. 

Our fondest wish through these seventeen issues has been that some of that enjoy- 
ment and spirit has seeped into the magazine and that you've been able to share it. 

Softalk never has pretended to be a typical computer magazine. In our very first 
issue we stressed that the emphasis here would be on journalistic style rather than 
technical data. 

We've made every attempt to keep that pledge. No other computer magazine, in 
or out of the Apple world, makes an attempt to cover the issuance of each new 
product in its chosen field of coverag'e. But between Marketalk News and Marketalk 
Reviews, Softalk does exactly that each month, even when the products seem so 
arcane that we wonder why anyone would have ever bothered to dream them up, let 
alone attempt to make them commercially available. 

That policy has paid off in the satisfaction we get when the telephone starts ring- 
ing with inquiries for more information on such products. Some of them we still don't 
pretend to understand — we're still coming to grips with the depth of technical exper- 
tise and breadth of applications interest in the Apple market ourselves — ^but we've been 
able to realize true pleasure in seeing a frustrated user get together with a nascent 
manufacturer to accomplish something never before done with an Apple computer. 

We've also been able to bring you applications articles designed to stretch your 
imagination as to what you can do with an Apple. Is it a game machine? A word 
processor? A number-cruncher? A keeper of organized data? 

It's all these, of course, but the amazing thing about the Apple is that it's become 
far more than anyone, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Mike Markkula, or John Couch, 
could have ever imagined. 

An esprit de corps has surrounded the Apple that almost approaches religious 
fervor. And what Apple owners won't attempt to do with that machine defies imagi- 
nation. We've attempted to bring you some of those stories. 

We've also tried to adapt ourselves to the mold you've perceived as fitting for a 
computer magazine. 

In that regard, we've constantly monitored our mail and added columns that 
seemed to be in demand. 



The only noticeable difference in the short run between the Softalk you received this month and the Softalk 
you'll receive in February is that the February mageizine will be given a protective wrapping to-spare it the rav- 
ages of the U.S. Postal Service. 

The wrapping, in whatever form it may take now or in the future, could not be afforded when Softalk waa ship- 
ping for free. 

In addition, the likelihood is that you'll see more feature coverage from a wider geographical spectrum than 
ever before, contests with bigger prizes, and more eirticles such as the ones on compilers and Fortran that are long 
lead-time items. 

But generally, what you'll be getting for your money is exactly what you previously got for free — Softalk maga- 
zine as you see it now. 

Implementation of the paid subscription policy is as follows: 

1. All subscriptions are considered to have started with the October 1980 issue. September was mailed courte- 
sy of Apple Computer Inc. and will not be counted against the one-yetir free subscription. 

2. Dating from the first month in which our records show that a subscriber has received continuous service, 
twelve issues will be mailed on a complimentary basis. 

3. Subsequent to the twelfth complimentary issue, a notice of renewal will be mailed, advising of the change- 
over to paid subscription. All subscribers who do not choose to renew will be promptly removed from the active 
circulation rolls. Under no circumstances will any Apple owner ever be billed for issues not ordered. The notice of 
renewal is not an invoice, but a reminder of a change in status. 

4. Beginning with the February issue, the cover price of Softalk will be $2.60, or $30 per year. The one-year sub- 



DlSTMBUTIOn POLICY 

We began with a tutorial in machine language by Roger Wagner. Since then we've 
added columns on VisiCalc, SoftCard, Business Basic, Applesoft, investments and fi- 
nance, business applications, Baaic subroutines, Pascal, a tutorial for beginners, and, 
as of this month, a column on peripherals. 

Our columnists have been selected on the basis of their knowledge and their ability 
to communicate information in a literate manner. 

We've derived pleasure from your cards and letters, which often have described 
how some tidbit in Softalk helped solve a problem you had been wrestling with. 

We've also derived pleasure in the last seventeen months from seeing the blos- 
soming of the Apple market. The list of companies and products that did not exist that 
short time ago is lengthy; contemplate that Broderbund, On-Line Systems, and Sirius 
had released no product and DB Master was still on the drawing boards when we 
started planning Softalk in May 1980. VisiCalc had just been released. 

The people who bring you the programs and peripherals that drive your Apple 
have been living their own Horatio Alger stories, and we've attempted to keep you 
abreast of them and how they did it. It's been said before in the pages of this maga- 
zine, but, by and large, some of the most genuinely fine human beings on the planet 
function in the Apple marketplace. 

But most of all, we've enjoyed making our efforts complimentary to each of you. It 
is indeed more blessed to give than to receive, and we at Softalk have been truly 
blessed during these past seventeen months with some of the finest hours any journal- 
ist could hope for. 

Below you'll find what we hope is a complete statement of the new policy. Because 
we've never done this before, there may be bugs in the program. If you detect one, 
please inform us. 

Also below you'll find a list of everyone who contributes, either editorially or 
through such heart-breaking and mundane efforts as preparing our sixty-thousand- 
name mailing list for printing each month. Regardless of whether you ratify our past 
efforts by choosing to now pay for Softalk, please be assured that we've all received 
great pleasure from providing it for you.

scription rate will be $24, with the following exceptions: 

a. Apple owners who receive Softalk compliments of their local retail store or a software publisher will be 
granted the courtesy rate of $18 per year. Sofialk will regularly publish a list of those retail outlets and software 
publishers who have joined this program for the information of subscribers. 

b. Apple owners who desire multiple subscriptions may deduct $6 per subscription for each subscription af- 
ter the first. 

c. Public libraries, nonprofit institutions, and schools of all kinds, public and private, element£iry, secondary, 
and higher education, receive the special rate of $8 per yetu" for the first subscription and $5 per year for each ad- 
ditional subscription. 

5. Softalk will not recognize as a break in continuous service the feillure of the U.S. Postal Service to deliver any 
issue that Softalk's circulation list shows was mailed. Subscribers should inquire about replacement copies of non- 
delivered issues approximately on the 15th of the month of issue. 

6. No break in service, for whatever retison, subsequent to the receipt of twelve free Issues will entitle an Apple 
owner to additional complimentary issues. 

7. Softalk welcomes written inquiries as to the applicability of the subscription rates to any individual. Such in- 
quiries must state clearly what question is being raised and postulate the answer from the subscriber's viewpoint. 

8. Any paid subscriber may terminate his subscription at any time for any reason tuid request a full refund of 
the unused portion of the subscription rate. 

9. Under no circumstances should anyone presently receiving Softalk remit money until such time as they re- 
ceive their notice for renewed.

The Address Controversy 
Please send me the address of Shakti 
Systems, manufacturer of the Pegasus 
DBMS for Apple Pascal, as mentioned in 
Marketalk of your Augtist 1981 issue. 

I, like Mr. Peter Wagner (letter, Sep- 
tember issue) , would like you to give the 
addresses of the manufacturers listed in 
Marketalk and other columns in Softalk. 

1 understand your wish that readers pa- 
tronize their local Apple dealer and sin- 
cerely wish that I could. I am sure that 
there are many other Softalk readers 
who either do not have a local Apple deal- 
er or whose dealer has no knowledge of 
recent products for the Apple. We, and 
the manufacturers, your advertisers, 
would benefit by being able to contact 
one another. 

Gerald Perkins, APO San Francisco, CA 

You'll find addresses accompanying 
all items in Marketalk beginning in this 
issue of Softalk. 

We continue to encourage our read- 
ers to purchase through their dealers 
whenever possible. However, with the in- 
crease in our readership, our capacity to 
deal individually vnth requests for ad- 
dresses from readers such as Gerald 
Perkins, who is vnth the armed services 
overseas, has been sorely tried.

retailers who specialize in service for 
people such as Perkins, no one can give 
you the customer support and service 
that your retailer can. Manufacturers 
and publishers are seldom set up to deal 
with service problems; some will not re- 
spond to direct orders but will send you to 
your dealer or recommend another 
source for their wares.

A Kick When You're Down 

While your magazine is a greatly needed 
interface between consumer and indus- 
try, it is interesting to note that the con- 
sumer still seems to get short-circuited. 

I read in a recent issue of your maga- 
zine that Broderbund Software was of- 
fering an upgraded joy-stick version of 
Snoggle for those who had purchased the 
keyboard version. I anxiously attempted 
to take advantage of this offer. However, 
upon contacting Broderbund, I was in- 
formed that I was a couple of days late ; 
they had sold all Snoggle material to 
Atari and cannot deal with this product. 
They suggested that I contact "my" 
Atari dealer and continue to "enjoy" the 
version that I have. 

I'm certain "my" Atari dealer will 
love to take care of me and my Apple. 
Maybe he will offer me an upgraded ver- 
sion if I agree to take receipt of an Atari 
800. Sounds like a deal to me. 

As most probably know, it is not all 
fun and games the way it is written in 
your magazine. I just wish to make you 
and perhaps some readers aware of this 
type of unfortunate "big business" deal- 
ing that will sour the appletite of majiy 
personal computerlsts. If things like this 
continue, it will be easy justification for 
anyone to bootleg, rob, or steal such soft- 
ware. "Aye — Mate, pirate or perish" 
might be the only answer. 
Jerry Roberts, Melbourne, FL 

The letter you received from Broder- 
bund stated, ". . . as of October 21, all 
Snoggle material became the property of 
Atari. ..." You have jumped to the con- 
clusion that Broderbund sold Snoggle to 
Atari. They did not. Threatened lawsuits 
from Atari and injunctions from that 
company and its parent, Warner Com- 
munications, based on the similarity of 
Snoggle to the arcade game, Pac-Man, 
were more than a small, family-owned 
company such as Broderbund could 
fight. Therefore, Atari took Snoggle. 

The apology in your letter from Brod- 
erbund is sincere. 

The question is, indeed, one of piracy, 
or, at least, of copyright violation. Pro- 
grammers such as Jun Wada did not see 
the translation of a program from one 



JANUARY 1982 



s s I o n 

medium — the arcade — to another — the 
Apple home computer— to be a violation. 
Neither, at first, did the arcade game- 
makers. Recently, the worm has turned, 
and Atari has been demanding royalties 
on and/or removal from the market of 
any products that resemble their own. In 
many cases, their objection is open to 
question, but most software companies 
don't have the resources to stand up to 
the multimegabusinesses behind Atari. 
Ken Williams of On-Line Systems, with 
slightly more resources than others and 
vnth a great deal of courage, is doing so. 
Softalk unll keep you informed of the re- 
sults. (See Tradetalk, page 44.) 

The controversy will be covered in 
depth in the January issue of Softllne, 
Softalk'5 sister publication. 

Even if Broderbund' s actions had 
been everything you interpreted them as, 
it vxmld not constitute the least excuse for 
you to engage in piracy. Boycott — doing 
without a program — is an appropriate re- 
sponse to business practices you don't 
like; theft is not 

When DOS Boss Hits Again, Gassidy Will 
Be There 

As a software author for the Apple, I toil 
in relative obscurity. My friends always 
ask me what do I do all day? Why do I sit 
at home, instead of working, like a nor- 
mal person? I think they think I watch 
soap operas all day. 

You can imagine my elation when I 
opened my November issue of Sofialk 
and saw that one of my programs, DOS 
Boss, had made it to the top thirty! And 
not only that, but it was number three on 
the Hobby 10, right behind DOS Toolkit \ 

Despair followed on the heels of joy. I 
soon noticed that my name, Jack Gas- 
sidy, was not included in the entry. How 
could this have happened? My name is 
right next to the author's, Bert Kersey's, 
name everywhere on the package and in 
the program. Is there some foul plot to 
frustrate my childhood ambition for rec- 
ognition in the microcomputer indus- 
try??? 

So now, I go around to my friends, and 
I show them my copy of Sofialk In which I 
have penciled in my name next to Bert's. 
And I say, "That's me there. That's what 
I do all day. I've made It to the big time 
now." And they all smile and say they're 
happy for me, but as soon aa I turn my 
back I can hear them laughing and mak- 
ing jokes among themselves. 

So Softalk, my question to you is this: 
Would it be possible for you to put my 
name in as coauthor of DOS Boss, or 
should I just pencil my name into the 
VisiCalc entry, and go for the really big 
time?

This Blackjack System Works 

We were all delighted at the fine review 



you gave The World's Greatest Black- 
jack Program. I enjoy your magazine 
immensely, but It's even more fun to 
read about something we've done. 

My only concern was in your use of 
"allegedly" in describing the power of 
the Hi-Opt I card-counting system. I 
know this fits because you haven't seen 
any of the academic material, but the Hi- 
Opt I is generally considered the most 
powerful, simple system available. 

Julian Braun, an IBM employee and 
widely regarded as the final authority in 
the performance analysis of gaming sys- 
tems, established the merits of the Hi-Opt 
I in his paper, "The Development and 
Analysis of Winning Strategies for the 
Casino Game of Blackjack." He rated the 
Hi-Opt I as having an advantage of be- 
tween 0.8 percent and 2.8 percent over 
the house for single deck Las Vegas Strip 
rules. While exact performance depends 
upon many factors, there is no question 
in anyone's mind of the Hi-Opt being able 
to beat the casino. 

I know several high rollers who quick- 
ly Justified the entire Apple system sole- 
ly for its ability to teach them how to win 
at blackjack using The World's Greatest 
Blackjack Program. 

It's a minor point, and this letter is too 
long, but I don't think it would hurt to con- 
sider an item in the Letters section 
"clearing" the slur on the Hl-Opt I sys- 
tem.

An Open Letter to Rudy Lauer 

Thanks for your thoughtful response to 
my challenge. I appreciate the concern 
expressed in your letter to Softalk re- 
garding my claims for A bsolute Security. 

I realize that my challenge cipher 
does not rigorously prove the insolubility 
of my system ; however, I view the Sof- 
talk challenge as an effective way to ex- 
pose the merits at Absolute Security to the 
public. It seems to be a popular belief 
everywhere I turn that any code is solv- 
able, given enough time and computing 
resources. In order to sell my product, I 
am faced with the difficult task of over- 
coming that belief. 

Yes, Absolute Security is a true "One- 
Time-Pad" system. Its strength depends 
entirely on specific keys created by each 
liser. I realize that computers are only 
capable of generating "pseudo-random" 
sequences: therefore. Absolute Security 
has two sources of keys. One, based on a 
twelve-character "seed" input from the 
keyboard, is a pseudo-random genera- 
tor. It takes the twelve-character seed a^s 
the basis for a 72-bit generator (after a 
Knuth algorithm) . In my documentation 
for the program, I have been very care- 
ful to point out that using this pseudo-ran- 
dom generator does not provide absolute 
security — rather, it is included as a con- 
venience for higher volume, lower secur- 
ity applications. 

The other source of keys uses a hard- 
ware function readily available on every 



Apple— its cassette interface. By placing 
a cassette recorder In monitor mode and 
connecting it to the Apple (i.e., utilizing it 
as an audio amplifier), it is possible to 
compile highly random files from ambi- 
ent sounds (e.g., speech, room noises, 
dogs barking, traffic sounds, rain, etc.). 
This effectively handles the difficulty of 
creating large quantities of unique keys 
by making key production almost auto- 
matic. 

My documentation cautions users that 
they mtist use keys one time only and 
then destroy them. I have also been care- 
ful to point out the need for knowing that 
keys have not been compromised In tran- 
sit between sites. 



Since I view this system as having its 
major application in the area of commu- 
nication (rather than storage protec- 
tion), I don't see key loss as a major 
problem. If a key is lost or stolen, simply 
delete all copies and don't use it for en- 
coding data. It is far better to lose a key 
in transit (since keys have no integral 
value) than to lose a real document con- 
taining valuable data. 

I recognize that physical security at 
both ends of the communication path is 
vital. This Is true of any secure commu- 
nication system, however, and not Just of 
Absolute Security. Physical security Is 
much more straightforward than secur- 
ing a communication link, and I view it

In summary: I stand by my claims 
tor Absolute Security. Additionally, I feel 
that, in conjunction with the modem 
hardware of the Apple computer and the 
media of magnetic disks, Absolute Se- 
curity overcomes many of the tradition- 
al objections to the use of "One-Time-

A Hex on the Comer 
To Craig Stinson: I enjoy reading your 
Beginners' Comer very much. I don't 
think you wrote this article in the 
November 1981 issue. It doesn't sound 
like you. 

I also found a very bad mistake for 
you to have made in writing an article for 
beginners. In the third column, second 
paragraph from the top, starting with the 
words "Counting in the binary system," 
you use the binary number 1011 for the 
decimal equivalent of thirteen instead of 
the binary number 1101. 

I also found in the second to the last 
paragraph that you say that the binary 
number 1100 is the decimal number 
eleven. This is not true. It is equal to 
twelve. The hexadecimal is C6.

The Digital Woodman 

I do woodworking as a hobby and am 
often forced into making decisions on 
cutting lumber that I am sure are not 
optimal. I buy unfinished lumber and am 
able to resaw and plane the material to 
varying thicknesses, lengths, and widths. 
My problem is, on the one hand, having a 
list of required boards of finished 
dimension and, on the other hand, having 
a pile of unfinished lumber of varying 
dimensions that can be cut and finished 
into almost unlimited dimensional possi- 
bilities. 

The ideal situation, of course, is to be 
able to utilize the minimum amount of 
lumber with essentially no waste and 
have the largest possible unfinished 
boards left over. Is anyone aware of a 
program that I can utilize with my Apple 

II that can help me make the proper 
decisions on what unfinished lumber to 
use in order to produce a list of finished 
boards of known dimensions? 

On another note, I have read at least 
two advertisements for program-writing 
programs that sell for about $600 each. Is 
there any plan to report on these in a 
future issue? 

Lance Goddard, Belmont, CA 

Answering Their Own Question 

I had you put a letter in Softalk about 
entry addresses in Applesoft; mean- 
while we have been asking around about 
such a list. Enclosed is such a list that I 



typed from a friend. These have not all 
been tested but the ones we've used have 
worked. (Some are 2 to 4 off but can be 
found — see eirticle 1.) He derived this list 
by vising the token table in the reference 
manual plus making educated guesses 
from looking at the machine language. 
Some entry addresses need to be seen to 
load registers. I also wajs told of two ar- 
ticles that deal with this subject: 1. 
"Notes on Hi-Res Graphics Routines and 
Applesoft," by C. R. Mesztenyl, Apple 
Orchard (Spring 1981). 2, "Applesoft In- 
temal Entry Points," by J. Crossley, Ap- 
ple Orchard (March- April 1980). I have 
not seen the latter. The former is very 
helpful. 

We'll be grateful for any other infor- 
mation we get through our letter in the 
magazine. Any corrections to the list, 
too — and additions.

Medley of Thoughts from Nowhere 

I live in Barstow, California, where there 
are no computer magazines for sale, 
never mind computers. Plus, I have my 
Apple at work in my office at Fort Irwin 
which is thirty-seven miles north of the 
middle of nowhere. So, I need a little 
help, please. 

Can I access my MX-80 through ilppie 
'Writer'? You stated Magic Window can 
do it through control-B. Does Apple 
Writer have a similar device? If not, 
which other word processors can control 
the MX-80 print styles from text embed- 
ded commands? 

My Apple was malfunctioning the 
other day by intermittently blanking out 
the screen with reverse and full green 



video. It turns out some of my ICs had 
almost worked loose. After they were 
pushed down tight, everything worked 
normally. 

On-Line Systems promptly and politely 
helped me with a problem I had with one 
of their adventures (I admit it; I was 
stumped over the combined notes in the 
Wiz) . All things not being equal, I recom- 
mend that the water level In that 
infamous hot tub be lowered about eight 
inches. And put me in it! 

When can we talk to our Apples? 
The revolution will truly start when we, 
the masters, can talk to our machines, 
the slaves. They now respond to buttons 
and levers. I want a three hundred dollar 
card that will let me talk to the Apple 
with a vocabulary of twenty-five words 
with the capability of constructing an in- 
finite number of words based upon the 
first twenty-five. Is that too much to ask? 

The hardest part of living out here is 
not being able to see the appetite-whet- 
ting programs in operation. Thirty to a 
hundred dollars is too much to pay for a 
"looksee." But then, when I go into a 
computer store, what do I see? A bunch 
of dead machines with no one around that 
can adequately bring them to life. 
Imagine a car showroom where the 
salesman can't start or drive the car! 
That's the situation in many Los Angeles 
computer stores — no action. 

In a software store recently, I had a 
hell of a time talking the manager into 



13 



running Superscribe II for me. I wanted 
to see the seventy-column format on the 
screen without the eighty-column card In- 
stalled. After much cajoling, he opened 
the package up, booted up, and then gave 
up. He couldn't put the format on the 
screen and he wouldn't let me try. He 
wants me to pay $130 for a program I 
can't see in action? (I'm sure it wasn't 
the program's fault.) As we say: the 
buyer-seller interface has some bugs. 

Don't you love the ads on TV by the 
Big Boys? They are selling computers 
like selling a restaurant because the 
waitresses are pretty. The sizzle of 
computers needs to be sold in those TV 
ads. The sizzle is software. How shall I 
put it? "Sell sizzling software!" 
J. Barry Smith, Barstow, CA 

International Apples 

Mr. Gregory Enos asked for names of 

Apple computer users' groups in foreign 

countries (October 1981, page 9). While I 

am unaware of any official group here in 

Rio, I do know many of the Apple owners. 

Perhaps if he were to contact me for 

whatever help he wants, a "users' 

group" would appear.

to warn your other readers that the Diet 
Analysis program written by Javed 
Aslam and marketed by Apple as part of 
their SDS program has design deficien- 
cies and defects which render it of lim- 
ited value to the serious user. 

I purchased Diet Analysis for my wife 
on the basis of the description published 
in Apple's SDS catalog. It sounded like a 
great way for her to keep up with her 
intake of carbohydrates and all the other 
things she loves so well. The first 
problem encountered was that the pro- 
gram would crash when an attempt was 
made to activate one of the fimctions 
from the menu. Since the disk was locked 
to prevent the user from copying the 
program and the various tricks had 
been used to reset the reset vector and 
prevent listing the program, the only 
recourse was to turn off the computer. In 
addition to this fatal flaw, it turned out 
that, contrary to indications in the SDS 
catalog, it was not possible to add foods to 
the data base to tailor it to the user's 
likes. Finally there was no provision for 
printing any of the results. Since the pro- 
gram had to be booted to run it, it was not 
possible to install a screen print routine 
and, for reasons stated above, it was not 
possible to add printing options to the 
code. Fortunately, the local store took the 
program back. 

Once again, I regret having to throw 
cold water on Dr. Aslam's efforts, 
particularly since the program other- 
wise has a lot of merit. I am disappoint- 
ed, however, that Apple did not try a little 
harder to ensure that the program would 
run as the author intended, and that their 
catalog was misleading. Perhaps I would 
have kept the program had I been 
permitted to modify the code to do what I 
wanted. 

Mike Kramer, Klngwood, TX 

Wants To Copyright Supergame 
I've written an adventure game to 
market through a software firm, and, as 
it is the first such program I've ever writ- 
ten, I would like to know the procedure 
for copyrighting it. I've done my level 
best in cheatproofing the code, but 
modifying DOS 3.3 is still beyond my 
expertise. I hope to have the program hit 
the stands before the end of next year. 

If public response is sufficient, I will 
develop an idea into a second adventure 
game and have that marketed. Perhaps, 
someday, I can resign my present job as 
a chemistry lab technician, but I keep 
such musing under strict control. 

Some of my cheatproofing efforts 
involved the use of programs like the 
Extended Memory Dump by Curt 
Deegan, which was simply thrown away 
by being published in Apple Orchard. 
I've seen some blame good marketable 
software thrown away by release via a 
magazine. A software magazine is for 
short utilities, patches, news on com- 
puter developments, ads on software and 
hardware reviews, and seminars on com- 



puter uses (Like Roger Wagner's Assem- 
bly Lines), but not to publish market- 
able games like Suitor's Fast Life or 
Thomas Mimlitch's Spelunker, which 
involved a lot of ingenious work and were 
yet thrown away via magazine release. 
All they'll get is payment for the article 
and for republication in a "Best Of" 
book, and they lose himdreds of dollars. 

My game is far too long to publish in a 
magazine, and involves untypable file 
names, exit disable, auto-run mode, and 
starting at boot-up. Besides, typing it in 
from a printed page would reveal all 
playing secrets and spoil the fun. 
Paul R. Wilson, Bergenfield, NJ 

Case of the Heavy Manual Cover 
Just a simple question. I know that I 
must clear my Apple screen before I 
Load an overlapping program. 

But when I save an updated program 
(using the same old title) do I have to 
first delete the old program? 

Half of my "experts" say, "absolute- 
ly." The other half say, "the Apple will 
automatically push the old program into 
a different sector. There will be no 
overlap problems." 

I can't find this in any of my eight 
manuals, though I confess I've been too 
lazy to thoroughly research them. 
Charles M. Larson, Whittier, CA 

Saving an updated program with 
exactly the same name as the old pro- 
gram will write over the old program. 
The old program will he effectively 
deleted automatically. You can never 
have two programs with precisely the 
same name on the same disk. Names 
need differ only slightly, however, to 
retain both programs. Naming the revise 
of MyProgram MyProgram 2 will render 
two separate files. 

Reading your manual (in this case, 
Applesoft Tutorial, page 60) is always a 
more certain way and usually a faster 
way of finding an accurate answer than 
polling the populace. It also takes less 
effort. 

More to Games Than Fun 
I appreciated "Psychology and the 
Apple" (November 1981). As a psychol- 
ogist and behavior therapist I have used 
my Apple II to enhance treatment of 
youngsters in much the same way as Dr. 
Wanderer. 

Perhaps, by showing the article to 
parents, it may be easier to explain how 
"playing games" on the Apple can be 
therapeutic for their children.

A Telling Time for Clocks 
We would like to amplify several of Rich- 
ard Kaapke's comments about the Cali- 
fornia Computer Systems Model 7424 Cal- 
endar-Clock Module. We purchased two 
of these clocks. The manual with the first 
contained clock-setting and reading pro- 
grams that had to be debugged. We agree

with Mr. Kaapke that a product like the 
7424 should be accompanied by a disk of 
tested programs, not a manual full of de- 
fective ones. The manual with the sec- 
ond 7424 that we purchased at a later date 
wasn't much of an improvement. Even 
"seasoned computer owners" will find it 
disorganized and practically impossible 
to follow. Our electronics technician had 
to examine both the circuit board and the 
schematic diagram even to install the 
batteries (not supplied) . Finally, the ma- 
jor disadvantage of the CCS 7424 is that to 
change the mode of operation one has to 
open the Apple and move jumpers on the 
clock board. 

Although our clocks now function 



properly, we would not recommend them 
primarily because of the poor documen- 
tation. However, for anyone who already 
owns this clock we would like to offer 
some help. Mr. Kaapke stated that in the 
"screen display routine . . . there is no 
simple way for a program to read the 
time off the screen. ..." The program 
we offer peeks the memory addresses of 
the text screen positions to which the 
CCS clock writes the time. Because the 
screen display routine operates via in- 
terrupts, any Basic program can run si- 
multaneously and make use of the time 
data so long as the Basic program does 
not use the same text screen positions. To 
use this program without modification, 



JANUARY 1982 



the appropriate jumpers should be in- 
stalled for the screen display mode and 
for 1 Hz or slower interrupts. We found 
that 1 Hz interrupts only make screen 
scrolling a bit slower than usual, where- 
as 1.024 kHz interrupts interfere with disk 
operations.

Master Plan for Modem 

I have just finished reading my copy of 
October's Softalk and was completely 
taken with the article on "The Game- 
Master." That unique service is the best 
argument I've heard yet for investing in 
a modem. It is articles like that that keep 
me reading Softalk from cover to cover 
each month. 

I would very much like to contact 
Harlow Stevens, Bob Knlskem, and/or 
Paul Martin and learn more about the 
GameMaster philosophy and the possi- 
bility of bringing it to the east coast 
where I live.

Apple Silentype printer — and a question. 

As you can see from the directory, I 
have a file BH3.BAS.

Without the inconvenience of going into 
MBasic (change print to Iprint) , can you 
tell me how I can directly from the CP/M

MENU GENERATORS " 
CAN ORGANIZE YOUR APPLE 



MENU GENERATOR is an exciting 
new software package for developing 
menu programs on your Apple. In 
fact, MENU GENERATOR contains 
its own menu system to lead you 
through the development process, 
which involves filling in several 
forms on the screen. 

On request, MENU GENERATOR 
will compile your inputs and write 
a menu program in Basic. It will 
also store your inputs in a data 
base for later editing. The menu 
programs developed with MENU 
GENERATOR display completely 
formatted screens, process user 
input commands and perform the 
required DOS operations to run 
other programs. 

MENU GENERATOR requires a 48K Apple II Plus, one disk drive, 
DOS 3.3 and optional printer. Suggested retail price is $39.95 for 
MENU GENERATOR on disk with instruction manual.

E) to work on the Magic Window? I 
suspect that this problem may arise with 
other printers and other word proces- 
sors. The key is simple: use a capital E, 
represented in Magic Window by an in- 
verse letter. The key sequence for the 
example (assuming you are not in caps 
lock) is: 

CTRL-B ESC ESC E continue typing 

a Ctrl this capital 
char is the letter 
follows char follows 

This shift key also explains why the char- 
acters @ [ / ] < come out as ' ) ! ) $ on 

the printout ; the first bunch were shifted 
and appear on the screen in inverse. 
Tim Desmond, Harbor City, CA 

To Michael Gibson, Roy Trahan, and 
Martin Tiersky: THANKS! While I don't 
have B. Magic Window with my Apple II, I 
do have the Apple Pie Text Editor. 
Up to now, I've not foxand a way to send 
an escape sequence to the printer. My 
letters to Programma brought back a 
rather cryptic reply of "... type the 
standard series followed by ESC. " I was 
unable to decipher this code until I saw 
the letters of the above gentlemen in 
reply to someone else's problem. The 
same fix (entering an escape code 
sequence as control-escape) works with 
my Pie. The keypresses are: Shift-con- 
trol-M, then escape, then the number or 
letter for the code (the letters must be 
uppercase) . 

By the way, with the new Graftrax-80 



option on my MX-80, 1 can now mix com- 
pressed, emphasized, double-print, and 
expanded print on the same line, mixing 
them at will, and cancelling any at any 
time (with the exception of the expanded 
charactera; they still turn off at the end of 
the line). 

Not only that, but I now have an italics 
mode that can add extra emphasis to any 
printed matter. Then add the new ability 
to backspace, and underlining becomes a 
reality at last. 

There are still more advantages to the 
Graftrax-80 that I'll not go into now, but 
suffice it to say that this is not just a set of 
PROMs to produce hard-copy graphics 
(which it also does quite well — thank you, 
Epson) . 

Finally, thanks for a great magazine, 
and I look forward to your newest 
venture, Softline. It should prove inter- 
esting to the adventurer in all of us.

The Oft-Overlooked Integer Variable 

Your September 1981 Basic Solution for 
inputting cursor control commands in a 
clear uniform manner (and also other 
commands as required by the program) 
uses excessive code to accomplish this 
task, mainly because the subroutine does 
not use the two most powerful program- 
ming tools aveiilable in Basic, the array 
and the for-next loop. Also, since real 
numbers are used, rather than integers, 
the subroutine is executing slower than it 
would if integers were used. 



The first step in perfecting this rou- 
tine, then, is to change all the real num- 
ber variables to integer variables. 
Thus line 110 would be changed to read 
CM%=1 : GOSUB 1000 and lines 1010 and 
1020 would use C% rather than C to store 
the input from the keyboard. 

Secondly, the character codes that will 
be considered valid are rearranged and 
read into an integer array during pro- 
gram initialization in the following man- 
ner: 



Character Codes 
27 Escape 
08 left arrow 
21 right arrow 
13 return 
47 slash 
— string 



Return Codes 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 



10 DATA 27,8,21,13,47 

20 FOR Z= 1 TO 5 : READ CC%(Z) ; NEXT 

The codes are now in array CC%. Entry 
one contains a 27, entry two an 8, etc. The 
subroutine is modified by replacing the 
lines 1030 through 1080 with the follow- 
ing: 

1030 FOR RV = 1 TO 5 : IF C% = CC%(RV)THEN 
1090 

1040 NEXT : IF NOT CM% THEN INPUT ""; 1$ : 
RETURN 

The subroutine will now read array CC% 
and if it finds a match to the value in C% 
then a GOTO 1090 is executed where 1$ is 
set to the character represented by the 
ASCII value in C%. When the return is

Now, all this work will save approxi- 
mately 45.73 microseconds (this figure is 
accurate to +/- 10 microseconds), but 
more importantly, program storage is re- 
duced. No matter how many different

Remedy for Absent- Minded Renumberer 

The Renumber utility program supplied 
with Apple DOS 3.2 and 3.3 has an insidi- 



ous bug — after you use Renumber, your 
program may still appear to run perfect- 
ly, so you may not even notice that your 
program's operations have been al- 
tered! Renumber will correctly change 
all line number references to agree with 
the new line numbers. Unfortunately, Re- 
number may also alter any number in an 
arithmetic expression that (a) follows an 
asterisk (the multiply operator) , and (b) 
has the same value as a pre-Renumber 
line number. 

I obtained the corrections for the DOS 
3.2 version from the Apple Hotline in May 
of 1980. I just discovered that the prob- 
lem still exists in the DOS 3.3 version, and 
I am still seeing letters in various maga- 
zines from perplexed Apple users.

versions of the program are similar— 
they involve swapping two data values in

To correct the Renumber program 
permanently, you must a) load Renum- 
ber, b) Do the two pokes for your version 
of DOS. c) Save Renumber.

these fixes — even if you don't use Re-

Renovating the Dumps 
Art Christopher's Screen Dump Pro- 
gram (November 1981, page 16) works 
very well. I have made a few changes 
that should be interesting. 

First, because of the intertwined pat- 
tern in which the screen is stored, he used 
three for^ext loops. Since the loops are 
values that are exactly forty apart, a sin- 
gle loop can be nested within another. 

Second, the gosub was needed to 
avoid repeating the code for printing one 
screen line within each of the three loops. 
Since there is now one nested loop, the 
code can be put in the middle of the loop 
and the gosub is eliminated. 

Third, because the gosub and the 
branch around it are eliminated, the en- 
tire routine can be entered on one line 
number. All three of these changes add to 
the efficiency of the routine. 

A fourth improvement that, for clar- 
ity, I did not choose to include is to elimi- 
nate the variable name after each next.

The routine just listed should work for 
most printers. For printers that can han- 
dle 132 character lines (Epson MX-80 
with condensed print, or EJpson MX-lOO, for 
example) the following routine will print 
the screen dump three-up. This takes ad- 
vantage of the interleaved organization 
of the lines in memory so that the first 
eight lines on the screen print on the left, 
the middle eight lines in the middle, and 
the last eight lines on the right.

Mark Lavetter, Southfield, MI 

I wish to express my thanks for a most in- 
formative magazine. I am a new ad- 
venturer to the world of computing and 
subscribe to various publications but 
yours is by far my favorite. 

I have a question regarding Art 
Christopher's Screen Dump Program. 
Art stated that it could be called with a 
control-P; would you please clarify this 
on just how it could be written into a 
program? 

Dr. Joseph D. Scalzo, Scottsdale, AZ 

Mr. Christopher's screen dump pro- 
gram is intended to be used as a subrou- 
tine. It can be called from any input or 
get statement in the main program. As- 
suming you want to use controUP to 
trigger the screen dump, the calling 
statement might look like this: If 
A$=CHR$(16) THEN GOSUB 33000. 
Naturally A$ in this statement could as 
easily have been X$ or any other string 
variable. The use of control-P is also ar- 
bitrary, although the use of a control 
character has the merit of not echoing 
the trigger character on the screen fol- 
lowing an input statement. 



Toward Easy Conversion 
I have been reading Softalk for the past 
few years now and I must say that it has 
come a long way in that time. I have 
found that among the most helpful arti- 
cles in Softalk are Basic Solution and As- 
sembly Lines. One difficulty some of us 
have is converting hex numbers to deci- 
mal and decimal to hex. To that end, I 
submit a program, which I think will help 
my fellow Apple users. 

Here is how it works:

Lines 40 to 70 are used to select and 
validate the option "H" or "D." 

Line 80 requests the hex address as a 
string variable. 

Line 90 validates the input. 



Line 100 establishes the for-next loop 
used to check each input character, the N 
variable is created to invert the J se- 
quence since the mid$ step in line 130 
reads characters from left to right (left 
justification for characters). 

The for-next loop of lines 110 to 140 is 
used to check each input character 
against the data statement in line 420. 
Then use the value of I (which corre- 
sponds to the match of "B$" to input 
character J) to load the array A%,J. 

Line 150 detects an illegal character. 

Line 170 resets the data pointer to 
entry #1. 

Line 180 is the heart of the hex-dec 
conversion; it raises each variable in the 
array A% to the appropriate power of six- 
teen and then sums the results into vari- 
able D. 

Line 190 prints the results. 

Line 220 is used when dec to hex con- 
version is requested. The input is stored 
as a real number since Apple will not ac- 
cept an integer number larger than 32767 
and $FFFF is 65535 in decimal. 

Line 230 validates the input. 

Line 240 saves the input in variable C 
for later display. 

Lines 250 to 300 convert the input "R" 
into an equivalent integer variable A%. 
Each A% variable is loaded with the ap- 
propriate number of times that the power 
of 16 (4096, 256, 16, 1) will divide into R, 
the input. Each time a division occurs, 
the product of sixteen raised to the ap- 



propriate power and the integer value A%

is subtracted from the input variable R. 
Thus the remainder is paussed on to the 
next lower power of sixteen for division. 

line 310 starts the for-next loop that 
will load the output variables. 

Lines 320 and 350 match the integer 
loaded in A%,J against I; when a match 
is found the corresponding B$ variable 
represents the hex equivalent of the in- 
teger A%,J. The appropriate B$ variable 
is then loaded into the string array D$,J. 

Line 360 is printed when no hex match 
can be found. 

Line 370 restores the data pointer as 
above. 

Line 380 is used to concatenate all of 
the D$ variables into the output variable 
E$. 

Line 390 prints the result of the con- 
version. 

Line 420 is the data statement that 
represents all the possible hex designa- 
tions.

thanks for the good work you folks are 
doing.

Let's End The War 

Right now the Apple users are in a 
state of conf vision. 

Looking at all the new software that is 
on the market, with the boom in home 
computers, and seeing the prices on pro- 
grams makes us wonder what's going on. 

We have to make a decision between 
saving our hard earned cash and paying 
the ridiculous high prices for these pro- 
grams or being illegal and getting black 
market programs at a more affordable 
price; neither is a good choice. 

I have noticed in recent ads in other 
computer magazines that certain com- 
panies have more or less declared war on 
those that are making these copies. 

Granted software companies should 



#a S ( U I A I V 

make a profit on the work and effort of 
what they have done. But how much of a 
profit and for how long? That's what it 
gets down to. 

Most companies need at the most 6 
percent profit to put back into the com- 
pany. The prices we see have to be more 
than that, figuring they can't be paying 
over $2 for the diskette, and that leaves 
the remainder for the printed matter, 
which can't be more than $5 (basing this 
on the price of similar material on the 
market), which comes to a total of $7. 
Most software listed in Softalk sells from 
$26.95 on up. 

If these manufacturers would bring 
the price down, these so-called pirates 
couldn't afford to buy the copy pro- 
grams, take the time to copy, and still fig- 
ure that they are coming out ahead. 

I am not for copying copyrighted pro- 
grams because these companies have 
earned the rights to them and it is against 
the law. However if these same compa- 
nies would wake up to the fact that they 
Could all but eliminate these pirates by 
cutting their prices (in some cases by 
more than half) , it would make a simple 
compromise.

A Better Way To Trace Roots 
I want to add my congratulations on the 
content of Softalk, which covers a wide 
range of interests and abilities in the per- 
sonal computing field. My own interest is 
in genealogy and you might want to con- 
sider an article on the available pro- 
gframs and the various uses that are 
made of them. While I can't claim that 
genealogy is the leading use for small 
computers, it certainly has great poten- 
tial. 

The average person interested in ge- 
nealogy is not a computer or program- 
ming expert but is vitally interested in 
storing and sorting data. Since cost is a 
factor, I have found a great reluctance to 



JANUARY 1982 



invest in genealogy programs that are 
advertised, since many "horror stories" 
are circulated, and most computer stores 
do not have sample disks to demonstrate 
to the neophyte what a particular pro- 
gram can do. 

Since I started some time ago, I am 
using File Cabinet on a 48K, 13 sector, 3.2 
system, and many others also use either 
File Cabinet or Data Factory as a meth- 
od of storing the data. I have heavily 
modified my File Cabinet but still it is not 
a genealogy program and of course mov- 
ing data from disk to disk is still not a 
simple matter, though I have programs 
to help a little. I am not in the "expert 
programmer" category and need all the 
help I can get. Some of us do exchange 
ideas of course, but I have not found any 
real national source of ideajs or pro- 
grams ... a mention in Softalk of the 
problem might tincover a solution. 

I modified the Sklar program for find- 
ing dates (October 1981) and can now fig- 
ure dates forward or backward, com- 
pute birth dates from the common death 
info foimd in genealogy, etc. I appreciate 
his efforts and yours in publishing the 
basic program.

THE APPLE SPELLEK fills the void 
that has consistently kept the large 
variety of excellent word processing 
packages for the Apple II Computer 
from approaching the power of a 
dedicated word processor. Finally, 
the first professional quality spelling 
verification program is available for 
the Apple II. The Apple Speller will 
certainly be the standard against 
which all other similar programs are 
compared. 

The Apple Speller interfaces to 
the most popular Apple word pro- 
cessors including Applewriter, 
Apple Pie, Superscribe II, and Magic 
Window just to name a few. In fact, 
the Apple Speller can analyze the 
output of any editor that writes a 
standard Apple binary or text file to a 
diskette. In addition to this flexibility, 
the performance of the Apple Speller 
will astound the microcomputer 
world. 

The Apple Speller is supplied with 
a 30,000 + word dictionary on a 
single SVa " diskette with additional 
space to easily add another 8,000 



words to suit your individual needs. 
The Apple Speller has built-in utilities 
to maintain the dictionary diskette. 
You can readily add words, delete 
words, and create an unlimited num- 
ber of modified and/or new diction- 
aries for specific applications. 

The Apple Speller is unbelievably 
fast. The first pass reads your docu- 
ment and collects all the words it 
contains at a rate of 5,000 words 
per minute. Next, the words are 
compared to the dictionary for spell- 
ing errors at the incredible speed of 
50,000 words per minute. Finally, all 
misspelled words are marked as 
such in your document with a rate 
of 1 ,000 words per minute. This 
translates to proofreading a 10 page 
document in 1 minute if there are no 
spelling mistakes and 2 minutes, 15 
seconds for an unlimited number of 
spelling errors. 

Numerous options are provided 
throughout the program to enable 
you to completely control all activ- 
ities of the Apple Speller. These 
include the ability to ignore both 



control codes and formatting com- 
mands, an alphabetical listing of 
either misspelled words or all the 
words in your document along with 
usage frequencies, multiple options 
for the action taken with each 
misspelled word, and much, much 
more! A verification mode is pro- 
vided to allow you to examine and 
dispense with misspelled words 
while viewing them in the actual 
context in which they appeared in 
your file. 

The Apple Speller requires an 
Apple I I/Apple II + equipped with 
48K, Dos 3.3, and two disk drives. 

The Apple Speller is being intro- 
duced at the incredible price of 
$75.00!

What Is Obscene, after All? 

Softalk is a useful tool for those inter- 
ested in programming. However, I feel 
that some of the ads are completely in- 
appropriate for such a magazine. I am 
referring to the advertisements for erotic 
software and pornographic games. I find 
it disgusting and do not want to see any- 
thing of the sort in Softalk. In addition to 
agreeing with Ms. Smith's objection (in 
the November Softalk) that one such ad 
was degrading to women, I think such 
ads are harmful to the industry. What 
does one say to the parents who see top- 
less women in their child's magazine? I 
do not wish to preach from the pulpit, but 
a prostitution simulation game is a moral 
outrage. What people do is their busi- 
ness, as long as it is not intruding upon 
the freedom of others. If others wish to 
engage in such activities, then they have 
made that choice. But being assaulted by 
this filth merely because one turns a 
page is unacceptable. 
Michael Daugherty, Fort Collins, CO 

The seocual mores of a society are al- 
ways under debate. That very statement 
implies that there are two sides to the is- 
sue, neither side more morally correct 
than the other, both only seeking for 
some higher truth. In our society, the Sur 
preme Court has defined pornography cw 
those portrayals of human seocual activ- 
ity that have no socially redeeming 
value; Softalk has seen some programs 
like that and has rejected ads for them. 
The programs for which we have ac- 
cepted ads in this context are those that 
we believe to be legal under the guide- 
lines of this country. 

In general, it's been a pitiably small 
minority that have raised their voices to 
object to these ads. In fact, more than 
three times as many persons have called 
with support for carrying those kinds of 
ads as have protested. But even more co- 
gent is the point that nothing, not even the 
pure science of computer programming, 
exists external to the society within 
which it functions. And that society will 
intrude and force its own reality upon its 
subgroups. 

Thank you for printing the objections to 
cheesecake ads (November) . I would like 
to add my agreement to the opinions of 
GiUett and Smith, and thank them for 
raising the issue. Softalk doesn't need 
this sort of material and advertisers need 



to know it. (Sex is wonderful, but if I want 
to look at nude people I'll subscribe to 
Playboy. ) 

I would add the ad for Hi-Res Secrets 
(November, page 39) to the list of unde- 
sirables. Please ask Don Fudge if he 
really wants his name on such cheap 
sleeze. 

Please continue your high-density 
coverage of the Apple. You have been a 
real help.

Basic Solutions? Good idea. But they are 
not solutions at all when they are full of 
errors. Take December for example (this 
is the first one I've tried to implement) . 
You'd do us (and yourself) a favor by 
printing actual computer listings (that 
work) instead of a typeset version of 
same. If a "solution" must be typeset for 
publication, try keying the program from

Bugs in the Forest 

After reading the November 1981 article 
entitled "Apples Among the Acorns," I 
felt compelled to write you concerning a 
few inaccurate statements. 

In the section entitled Apple's Instant 
Recall Handles Logistics, the very first 
paragraph speaks of a program feature 
that deploys helicopters to incidents by 
providing a heading (in degrees) and a 
distance (in miles) . This aspect is avail- 
able only to our air tankers based at Fox 
Field Airport, in Lancaster, California. 
The distance and heading is calculated 
by the Apple from the Palmdale VOR 
(Variable Omni Range) , to the center of 
the section (a 640-acre area) , where the 
fire is located. 

In paragpraph six of the same section. 
Matching Specific Fires to Methods that 
Worked Historically, you incorrectly 
mention that the main information cen- 
ter (for another computer we have ac- 
cess to) is in Atlanta, Georgia. This 
should be corrected to read Riverside, 
California. I might mention that this 
computer in Riverside, labeled the 
PRIME, ties together a multitude of co- 
operating fire agencies in a system called 
FIRESCOPE (Flrefighting REsources 
of Southern California Organized for Po- 
tential Emergencies). 

Finally, in the section Margin for Er- 
ror, second paragraph, the Marble Cone 
Fire occurred in 1977 and burned 177,000 
acres, not, as the article stated, 1979 and 
130,000 acres burned. 

On the positive side, I would like to 
take this opportunity to express our ap- 
preciation for the article and your inter- 
est in our program. The response from 
the Forest readers has been good and 
we will continue to look forward to read- 
ing your magazine each month.

JANUARY 1982 



Apple president Mike Markkula predicted in the Decem- 
ber Softalk that the personal computer would equal the print- 
ing press in its impact on society. Should Markkula prove pre- 
scient in that regard, then it's fitting that magazines that treat 
the use of the personal computer also address the larger is- 
sues. 

This series of Newspeak articles will attempt to air the is- 
sues confronting our civilization. Because of that orientation, it 
ivill contain no inside information on peeks and pokes, bits and 
bytes, or RAMs and ROMs. 

The issues are far less concrete and to that extent far more 
discomforting than the technical aspects of how to make your 
Apple do your personal bidding. But it's not realistic in this era 
of such rapid change to use technology as a shield from the real 
world. The real world unll impinge on the ethics, morality, and 
pragmatics of pure science and technology, even as our grow- 
ing technological expertise impinges on the real world. 

Because this is true, the interaction with the civilization at 



large of those members of civilization who use such advanced 
tools as the personal computer is as much a proper subject for 
a magazine like Softalk as delivering tutorials on specific larir 
guages or specific applications programs. 

Not all the articles in this series will be as wide-ranging as 
this one. In his eighty-six years, R. Buckminster Fuller has de- 
veloped a thoughtful, coherent, logically complete cosmology 
for the universe and the planet he affectionately calls Space- 
ship Earth. He limits his consideration of infrastructures to 
those whose policies, if continued, represent the forces of op- 
position to the changes he feels are necessary. 

We did not so much interview Buckminster Fuller as we did 
attend a personal lecture. Fuller's hearing impairment makes 
the intercouse usually implied by the word interview difficult. 

Another consideration is that Fuller is a man feeling dead- 
line pressure. He feels human civilization is fast approaching a 
crisis point and his interest is in disseminating the philosophy 
he feels the human race need adopt to salvage itself. With such 



JANUARY 1982 S C3 P T A L 1^ 25 



cosmic issues under consideration, directing Fuller's attenr 
tion to more mundane topics seemed inappropriate. 

The pursuit of Truth, however, is never inappropriate. If 
Markkula is correct, it's mandatory for Softalk's readers to 
give thoughtful consideration to the alternate futures avail- 
able. Perhaps few unll find Truth or an appealing alternative 
future in the words of R. Buckminster Fuller. But all toill be 
better equipped to evaluate other alternatives and other phi- 
losophies once they've grasped Fuller's views. 

Whether it is to be Utopia or Oblivion loill be a 
touch-and-go relay race . . . Humanity is in "final 
exam" 

— Buckminster Fuller, Critical Path 

You may remember the Plight Reverend Thomas Malthus. 
It was his postulation that the earth's food resources grow ar- 
ithmetically while its population increases geometrically, im- 



plying inevitable food shortages and worldwide starvation. 

That awful realization was what caused David Hume to dub 
economics the "dismal science." 

For a short time in this century, Malthus's theory became 
the object of scorn and derision. Technology would overcome 
all such seemingly determinate mathematics. 

When it later became apparent that the population was not 
only acting in the manner observed by Malthus, but it was also 
rapidly converting fertile agricultural lands to urban home 
sites, his theory again gained a degree of credibility. It seemed 
not even technology could overthrow the inexorable fact of 
scarcity. 

Advocates of Scarcity. But that may not be the fact. Rich- 
ard Buckminster Filler, mechanic, architect, and philoso- 
pher, believes that the entrenched interests in most advanced 
countries embrace the philosophy of scarcity and use it as the 
raison d'etre for activities that, in his opinion, hardly qualify as 
being in mankind's best interests. 



26 



JANUARY 1982 



What's most frustrating about these activities, which Full- 
er tends to subsume under the label "political," is, he believes, 
that the fundamental underlying principle of scarcity is no 
longer operative. 

About ten years ago, mankind turned the comer and tech- 
nology became available that, properly applied, had the power 
to repeal the law of scarce resources. That the organized 
bodies of society have failed to do so is prima facie evidence of 
their vested interest in a status quo that imbues value to goods 
and services viewed as scarce. After all, the law of supply and 
demand only functions in an environment where there's no 
equilibrium between the elements. 

Much of this new technology that makes it possible to 
dream of a higher standard of living for all men came from re- 
search into weaponry. Now Fuller believes it's time to break 
down our weaponry and build "llvingry" — ^the modem eqiiiva- 
lent of the Biblical injunction to beat swords into plowshares. 

Biblical metaphors are not out of place when discussing 
Buckminster Fuller's ideas. He has a firm beUef in a higher in- 
telligence, which he is reluctant to call God and drag into the 
realm of religious controversy ; and this belief and his overall 
view of the universe are a necessary departure point for under- 
standing Fuller's philosophy. 

The Ultimate Design. In conversation. Fuller alludes to the 
American Indian belief in a Great Spirit as being analogous to 
the higher intelligence he perceives. He derives what he be- 
lieves to be an experiential proof of the existence of this being 
from the universal physical laws that find their expression in 
mathematics. These higher laws are distinct from that body of 
natural phenomena where the exception proves the rule in that 
there are no exceptions. They coexist and interact and aug- 
ment each other at times, but never do they conflict. 

An example of such a law, from the field of astronomy, is 
the interattraction of celestial bodies, which always varies in- 
versely as the second power of the arithmetical distances in- 



tervening. 

In essence. Fuller sees design, in contradistinction to ran- 
domness, in such laws and from that design deduces a galac- 
tic intellect greater than our own. 

Design is important to a man of architectural skills such as 
Fuller, who cites various levels of design skill. A house can be 
designed with 500 drawings and requires building tolerances to 
one thirty-second of an inch. An automobile requires 5000 
drawings and requires tolerances of one ten-thousandth of an 
inch, which is finer than the human eye can detect. 

A Boeing 747 requires 50,000 drawings. Because air resis- 
tance increases as the second power of the speed of the craft, 
the 747, traveling at 650 miles per hour, must be able to v/lth- 
stand air pressure one hundred times greater than the ve- 
locity of a hurricane. For such a task, it requires better engi- 
neering design in each nut and bolt than in all the automotive 
industry. 

Yet all this pales in comparison with the design Fuller sees 
in the universe. 

Caretakers of the Mind. Another manifestation of this 
greater intellect's design is that the universe is self-regenera- 
tive. Everything in the universe is energy, either in the form of 
matter or in the form of radiation. No energy is ever lost, nor is 
any ever added, to the universe. Instead, the universe regen- 
erates itself. 

Fuller depicts mankind's role in this universe is as a hua- 
bandryman for the small comer of it that we inhabit. It is 
man's role to serve as a local information gatherer in this sec- 
tor of the universe, detecting and solving local problems ac- 
commodating evolutionary change. 

Humanity needs to produce technology to address those 
problems it finds. But, as the human becomes more adept at 
problem solving, it doesn't mean that all the problems are 
solved; instead, bigger problems manifest themselves and beg 
for solution. 

Fuller believes mankind was nominated as caretaker for 
this section of the universe because of the presence in humans 
of mind as well as brain. 

Brain, which humans have in common with other animals, 
is that part of the intellect that deals with the senses. The brain 
processes data on what we see, hear, smell, and feel. To that 
extent, the brain is limited to experiential data. 

On the other hand, mind comprehends data beyond the 
senses. It's mind that allows man to recognize principles and 
universal laws that control the data the brain recognizes. It's 
mind that makes the great leap from the concrete to the ab- 
stract. It's mind that allowed astronomers from Copernicus to 
Galileo to make valid assumptions about our universe even 
though they lacked the means to objectively verify their hypo- 
theses. 

Fuller emphasizes the greater importance that mind plays 
in the understanding of reality in this day and age. 

When he was bom in 1895, reality was measured essential- 
ly by the senses. What you could see, hear, smell, and feel con- 
stituted reality. But in that same year, Guglielmo Marconi in- 
vented the wireless. Hamessed radio waves were a phenome- 
non that could not be sensed objectively; only the results of 
their existence could be known. 

Such subsequent discoveries as the electron and the devel- 
opment of metallurgy continued the trend toward changing 
reality from a visible one to an invisible one until today 99.99 
percent of what constitutes our reality is not directly contact- 
able by our senses. 

Man Must Think To Live. Mankind is also eminently suited 
to its role as caretaker of this end of the universe because of its 
lack of specialization. 

Fuller points to the unique advantages enjoyed by all other 
species — birds with wings, animals with speed, strength, cun- 
ning, or daring, fish with protective coloring— and concludes 
that while these special advantages help to preserve each 
species, they also tend to channel species development in di- 
rections where their advantages can be best exploited. 

On the other hand, man has no unique advantage. In fact,

JANUARY 1982 SQPTALk ^ 29 



he comes to the world naked, helpless, and ignorant. This 
seemingly hapless state may be mankind's greatest strength 
in that it forces learning by trial and error. 

The phrase "naked, helpless, and ignorant" rolls off Full- 
er's tongue often in any lengthy discourse. The understanding 
of man's origins is central to the theses he develops. Man's 
state at birth and his lack of special advantages forces him to 
maximize those attributes, such as mind, that he has. Devel- 
opment of the mind is what makes man suitable as a hus- 
bandry man for this part of the universe. Man is helpless by de- 
sign — mind is everything and muscle is nothing. 

Thwarting Rresponsibility. From Fuller's vantage point, 
however, mankind has failed to seize the responsibility thrust 
upon it. Instead, it has politicized itself, with the result that 
vested interests have prevented adoption of policies that would 
enhance man's chances of success in the iiniverse. 

The political activities of mankind have deleterious effects 
in two directions : they interfere with the self-regenerative pro- 
cess of the universe and they inhibit proper understanding of 
the universe that would cause knowledgeable people to seek 
political change. 

Filler believes that the major political blocs spning up as 
defenses against the law of scarcity. As organized societies, 
they had a better chance of competing for those resources in 
short supply. 

One effect of their actions has been to hoard rather than 
husband the resources available. This is a natural outgrowth of 
the view that such resources are limited. But hoarding inhibits 
the regenerative process of the universe by withholding from 
that process raw materials. 

That's a serious enough effect to raise questions about the 
viability of multiple political bodies on Spaceship Earth. 
Equally as dangerous, however, is the fact that the political en- 
tities recognized that they had a vested interest in maintaining 
the myth of scarcity, even in the face of new technology that 
promised abundance. 

The response of the governments has been to tie the people 
to them in divers ways as well as educating them all to be- 



come specialists. 

The Main Problem: Dependence and Specialization. Fuller 
views water mains and sewer lines aa devices designed spe- 
cifically to make the individual dependent on the state. During 
his last visit to China, he pledged that he would not return until 
he had perfected the means to emancipate the Chinese from 
the chains of government-owned sanitation devices. 

He now predicts that he's a year away from delivering a 
dry package toilet that will convert waste either to fertilizer or 
to gas and a means of personal cleansing using pressurized 
air instead of water. 

But more dangerous in the long run than man's depen- 
dence on his government for services is man's ignorance 
caused by the means by which he's educated. Fuller believes 
that public education is designed to make each person a spe- 
cialist. In the context of Fuller's view that mankind is the spe- 
cies best suited to husband this comer of the universe, making 
man a specialist is especially abhorrent. 

Because the power structure fears high intelligence, it 
turns that intelligence in an individual to specialized functions 
where only a part of the picture can be seen instead of the en- 
tire picture. 

Buckminster Fuller sees that as truly limiting. Nothing 
about the behavior of any part of a structure will, in his view, 
permit you to understand the fxinctioning of the whole. There is 
nothing about one atom that predicts another atom. 

Missing the Forest — and the Universe. There is nothing 
about an atom that predicts amino acids. Likewise, there is 
nothing about amino acids that predicts protoplasm. And noth- 
ing in protoplasm will permit one to deduce camels or palm 
trees. 

Knowing atoms will not tell you that camels are smelly, 
cranky animals that bite. Yet those are germane facts. 

When man becomes a specialist, he loses sight of the larger 
picture. In the case of mankind, specializing prevents a clear 
understanding of the universe, which is the most critical whole 
to comprehend. Fuller uses himself as an example, saying that 
he had to throw off the shackles of specialization to enable him-

self to grasp the verities of the universe. 

So Fuller wages verbal war on the power structures em- 
bodied in political bodies as conducting themselves contrary to 
the best Interest of the universe. 

But what are the great technological breakthroughs that 
Fuller believes have repealed the fundamental law of 
scarcity? They are the get-more-for-less technologies that 
started arriving at the end of the sixties. 

The Apple and the Dome. Technology has made it feasible 
to provide more basic needs with fewer pounds of materials, 
using fewer ergs of energy, and using fewer units of time. The 
personal computer is one example of the more-for-less tech- 
nology. A loaded Apple II Plus approaches the computing 
power of the IBM 360 mainframes that were prevalent In the 
late sixties. Yet the Apple patently employs fewer materials in 
construction, requires smaller inputs of power to operate, and 
is constructed and maintained with far fewer units of man- 
power. 

Construction technology has taken the same route. Fuller's 
own patented geodesic domes provide shelter that is stronger 
and more reliable than steel and brick at fractions of the cost 
and weight. The domes are energy efficient and can be con- 
structed in relatively short time periods as compared to con- 
ventional structures. 

Fuller's dome structures exist throughout the world, but 
they've been especially adopted by people in harsh environ- 
ments such as the South Pole. What was required there were 
structures that could withstand 180 mile per hour winds and 
snow loads of as much as three hundred pounds per square 
foot. Structures using conventional building techniques cannot 
handle snow loads of more than sixty pounds per square foot, 
but Fuller's domes have been providing shelter for scientists at 
the South Pole for years. 

The magnitude of the energy savings using more function- 
al shapes such as domes and newer materials of higher tensile 
strength than steel and brick is brought home by considering

tho name o( your neofeii MUU deai«f 



the island of Manhattan, home of the skyscraper. To enclose 
Manhattan in a dome that would provide the same living and 
working space would cut the energy use eighty-four fold. Mag- 
nify that savings worldwide and you've made practical one of 
the planks of Filler's platform — phase out the use of fossil 
fuels and atomic energ^y. 

Fuller points out that fossil fuels are far more expensive 
than any price an individual can afford to pay if you consider 
the time and energy expended by nature to create the sub- 
stance, rather than the monetary expense at the gas pump. 

Fueling Nonsense and Aggression. What galls Fuller most 
about the use of fossil fuels is that they're used to operate re- 
ciprocating engines that are mounted in automobiles that car- 
ry people to jobs that are nonessential in terms of the uni- 
verse. To him this is not just waste, but waste doubly damned. 

Mankind's efforts should be expended in life support activi- 
ties or in promoting the self-regenerative aspects of the uni- 
verse. Other activities, such as an arms race that he views bjs 
futile, should be halted. 

The trillions of dollars of materials, energy, and time that 
have gone into the buildup of weaponry are ghastly wastes In 
Fuller's view. The arms race reflects the mentality of scarcity 
and the need of competing power structures to defend their in- 
terests in the face of hostile competition from other power 
structures. Of course, if there no longer exists a situation of 
scarcity, then there no longer exists a need for power struc- 
tures to compete for resources and therefore there no longer 
exists a need for defending those power structures with expen- 
sive armaments. 

To allege that the arms race has its foundations in power 
structures competing for resources does not address another 
line of thought equally as likely. That body of reasoning holds 
that man, as other animals, is naturally aggressive and there- 
fore societies need defense systems regardless of the relative 
abundance or lack thereof. 

Fuller finds this hypothesis at odds with observation. He be- 
lieves that aggression is a learned behavior caiised by with- 
holding life support for some period short of critical. T^ie key 
life support elements are food, water, and air. 

The universe has socialized air, making it freely available 
to all. In most areas, water supplies are adequate if not abun- 
dant. That leaves food as the life support element most likely to 
be withheld. This is especially true in the animal world, where 
periods of food deprivation are frequent. Fuller observes that 
the aggression quotient Increases with the Increased Incidence 
of food deprivation. 

Aggression is a learned behavior that stems from the ag- 
gressor having been punished by his environment through de- 
privation. In a future civilization of plenty, there need be no en- 
vironmental deprivation for mankind. 

Fuller believes the universe carries an inventory of rela- 
tive abundance that can be harnessed to raise the standard of 
living of all persons to new heights. However, it's essential that 
mankind cease its activities that inhibit the self-regeneration 
of the universe. 

Truth and the Computer. The individual's responsibility in 
this area is, in Fuller's words, to always tell the truth, the 
whole truth, and nothing but the truth. That may seem like lit- 
tle enough to ask, but it's vital in the overall scheme because. 
Fuller believes, the computer is the essential tool that can turn 
mankind away from its counterproductive activities to those 
that make more sense. But for the computer to do so, it needs 
truthful inputs. 

Fuller places great faith in the computer as the eventual 
tool that will persuade the power structures to reorient their 
thinking away from a mindset of scarcity and toward a mind- 
set of abundance. 

He's fond of recounting the use of the computer by United 
Auto Worker president Walter Reuther to extract a record 
wage hike from General Motors. Reuther used the computer to 
perform complex calculations that concluded that General Mo- 
tors would make higher profits by paying Its workers more 
money.

This was in the late forties, when computers were not the 
ubiquitous tools they are now, and the negotiators for GM were 
convinced that Reuther had seeded his computer with bad in- 
formation. They were shocked to find, upon running their own 
analyses, that his contention was absolutely correct. 

What happened was that the computer was able to analyze 
data and detect correlations between data that escaped the 
visibility of man. In effect, the computer was able to prove 
through its logic circuits that what seemed quixotic was ac- 
tually the correct and sensible course of action. 

Fuller believes the computer can serve the same purpose in 
the present: ratifjdng his contention of abundance and caus- 
ing the power structure to change its policies. But that makes it 
imperative that the computer be fed the unvarnished truth, 
rather than a concoction of misapprehensions and psuedo- 
laws. 

The requirement that the computer receive accurate data 
and be posed pertinent questions is the root of Fuller's counsel 
that individuals serve the cause of the universe best by truth- 
fulness. 

Fuller believes, among other things, that a computer fed 
good data would request that all humans be provided life sup- 
port elements and that only those humans engaged in the pro- 
duction of life support elements should work. He believes the 
computer will conclude that if persons are not providing life 
support, they should be paid to stay home. 

The energy and materials saved by eliminating occupa- 
tions not directly involved with life support would go a long 
way toward providing the higher living standard Fuller be- 
lieves is possible. 

Such a policy would not necessarily lead to a life of idleness 
and xnischief for that portion of the populace so unemployed. 
Fuller believes many would begin to seek out ways they could 
contribute to the welfare of the universe. He believes that in a 
world where work was not required for life support, working 
would become a desirable and honored calling. 



Our Ultimate, Immediate Choice. Buckminster Fuller be- 
lieves that mankind has the option to make it in the universe. 
But that option is no longer open-ended. For one thing, man- 
kind must opt for change before one of the competing power 
structures decides to trigger the button that will start the next 
war. Fuller firmly believes that no one can win that war, which 
is another reason why it's so imperative to change policies 
now. 

Another factor is that the power structures are impeding 
the process of self-regeneration of the universe. Even if no one 
pushes the button, such policies will eventually doom man- 
kind. 

What plagues Fuller is how to get the message to the four 
billion persons on Earth that they don't need to live in poverty. 
That there is abundance if only mankind will pursue appro- 
priate policies. 

To that end, Fuller crisscrosses the globe, spreading the 
message. He's been around the world forty-eight times and to 
this day, at age eighty-six, he speaks to at least one thousand 
persons every four days. 

He's been an invited professor at more than six hundred 
colleges and has spoken on more than one thousand college 
campuses. For all that busy schedule. Fuller employs no pub- 
lic relations persons, uses no speakers bureau, has no agent, 
and does no promotion. 

Unlike many prominent persons, he receives no remunera- 
tion from sitting on the board of directors of big companies. His 
only income is from speaking engagements and what monies 
are donated to advance his research. 

But even though he's attempting to cut back on his speak- 
ing schedule, he carries a schedule more arduous than most 
younger persons as he strives to beat the cosmic deadline. 

To Buckminster F'uller, the choice is between Utopia and 
oblivion. He believes we have the option and the time to reach 
for Utopia. And Fuller perseveres in forcing us to look to that 
option. '19

□ A Lot of Character. A new typewriter 
and a computer are teaming up to help 
the Chinese learn to type. Typing is a skill 
many Chinese have never acquired be- 
cause their language's thousands of sym- 
bols cannot fit on a keyboard. But a type- 
writer recently developed by Olympia in 
Wilhelmshaven, Germany, reproduces 
the characters by squirting ink through a 
computer-manipulated grid. The type- 
writer can produce fifteen signs per sec- 
ond from its computer bank. Now, if we 
could only translate that into words per 
minute, the Chinese could compete with 
us on an American typing test. 

□ Lo-Tech Crime. No matter how so- 
phisticated technology becomes, there 
will always be a crook who uses the most 
unsophisticated techniques and gets 
away with it. A "shabby-looking box" 
collected some money recently from a 
southern California bank. According to 
police reports, customers who intended 
to stick their cash in the night deposit 
found an out-of-order sign on the slot. In- 
stead the sign directed them to deposit 
their cash in an adjoining wooden box, 
which mysteriously disappeared by the 
next morning. Bank officials, who had no 
knowledge of either the out-of-order sign 
or the replacement deposit box, an- 
nounced the robbery soon after custom- 
ers started complaining that their night 
deposits hadn't been recorded on their 
monthly bank statements. The moral of 
this story: Computers aren't always to 
blame. Also, never trust a shabby box. 

□ Just Doing What Comes Naturally. 
In past issues of Softalk we've report- 
ed on many unusual applications for the 
Apple computer. Scientists, doctors, 
educators, and business executives have 
all found the Apple an invaluable tool. Al- 
though we haven't delved into the sub- 
ject much, there are those who would use 
the Apple for less legitimate purposes. 

One enterprising individual, Joseph 
Harvey, is a case in point. In August of 
last year, he and a couple of red-faced 
Apples were hauled off to jail for running 
a orostitution ring in Santa Ana, Califor- 
nia. The thirty-six-year-old Harvey, an 
aerospace engineer had started a lucra- 
tive escort business that offered more 
than the usual services. 

Using Apples and a five and a quarter 
inch floppy disk drive, Harvey kept track 
of all his customers, employees, and fi- 
nancial records. He also had a file called 
"pranks," which included known violent 
customers, nonpayers, and undercover 
agents and their pseudonyms. When a 
call came in it would be cross-refrenced 
against the data to determine if the caller 



was an undercover agent or some other 
undesirable. 

Harvey also had a handy device built 
into his Apple— a "kill" button. If the 
need arose pressing "kill" would erase 
the disk in the drive in a matter of 
seconds. Sgt. Dan Felix of the Santa Ana 
police department says that the arrest- 
ing officers entered Harvey's business 
fast enough to prevent the kill button 
from doing much damage. Felix also re- 
ports that Harvey was just about to ex- 



pand from five and a quarter in inch 
floppies to an eight-inch floppy disk sys- 
tem. 

At this point, Harvey has not yet gone 
to trial. Since he's charged with a felony 
offense, the maximum punishment if he's 
convicted would be a stint in the state pri- 
son. The Apples and fostware have been 
impounded and will be used as evidence. 
No charges have been filed against the 
computers, and they have sworn to walk 
the straight and narrow from now on. Hi

Everyone's Guide to Assembly 
Language, Fart 16 

One useful application of machine language programming 
is in the enhancement of your existing Applesoft programs. 
Some people are inclined to write all their programs in ma- 
chine language, but it may be more efficient on occasion to 
write "hybrids"— programs that are a combination of Apple- 
soft and machine language. In this way, particular functions 
can be done by the operating system best suited to the particu- 
lar task. 

If you had to write a short program to store ten names, it 
would be best to do it in Applesoft: 

10 FOR I = 1 TO 10 
20 INPUT N$(l) 
30 NEXT I 

This is much simpler than the equivalent program in ma- 
chine language. In cases where neither speed nor program size 
is a concern, Applesoft is a completely acceptable solution. 

However, if you had to sort a thousand names, speed would 
become a concern, and it would be worth considering whether 
the job could best be done in machine language. 

If you have ever done a call in one of your Basic programs, 
then you have already combined Applesoft with machine code. 
For example: 

10 HOME 

20 PRINT "THIS IS A TEST" 

30 PRINT "THIS IS STILL A TEST" 

40 GET A$ 

50 VTAB 1: HTAB 5: CALL- 958 

In this program, a line of text is printed on the screen. After 
you press a key, all text on the screen after the first word 
"THIS" is cleared. 

Now although it might be possible to accomplish the same 
effect in Applesoft by printing many blank lines, it would not be 
as fast or as efficient in terms of code as the call -958. 

In executing the above program, the Applesoft interpreter 
goes along carrying out your instructions until it reaches the 
call statement. At that point a JSR is done to the address indi- 
cated by the call. When the final RTS is encountered, control 
returns to the Basic program. In between, however, you can do 
anything you'd like ! 

Calling routines is hardly complicated enough to warrant 
an entire article on the subject. The real questions are, how do 
you pass data back and forth between the two programs, and 
how can the problem of handling that data be made easier for 
the machine langxiage program? 

Simple Interfacing. The easiest way to pass data to a ma- 
chine language routine is simply to poke the appropriate 
values into unused memory locations, and then retrieve them 
when you get to yovir machine language routine. To illustrate 
this, let's resurrect the tone routine from the May 1981 issue of 
Softalk. 

To use this, assemble the code and place the final object 
code at $300. Then enter the accompanying Applesoft pro- 
gram.

The Applesoft program works by first requesting values for 
the pitch and dviration of the tone from the user. These values 
are then poked into locations 6 and 7 and the tone routine 
called. The tone routine uses these values to produce the de- 
sired sound, and then returns to the casing program for 
another round. 

This technique works fine for limited applications. Having 
to poke all the desired parameters into various comers of 
memory is not flexible, and strings are nearly impossible. 
There must be an alternative. 

The Internal Structure of Applesoft. If you've been follow- 
ing this series for long, you've no doubt figured out by now that 
I'm a great believer in using routines already present in the 
Apple where possible, to accomplish a particular task. Since 
routines already exist in Applesoft for processing variables di- 
rectly, why not use them? 

To answer this, we must take a brief detour to outline how 
Applesoft actually "runs" a program. 

Consider this simple program: 

10 HOME: PRINT "HELLO" 
20 END 

After you've entered this into the computer, typing list 
should reproduce the listing given here. An interesting ques- 
tion arises: "How does the computer actually store, and then 
later execute, this program?" 

To answer that, we'll have to go to the Monitor and exam- 
ine the program data directly. 

The first question to anwer is, exactly where in the comput- 
er is the program stored? This can be found by entering the 
Monitor and typing in : 67 68 AF BO and pressing return. 

The computer should respond with: 

67- 01 

68- 08 
AF- 18 
BO- 08 

The first pair of numbers is the pointer for the program be- 
ginning, bytes reversed of course. They indicate that the pro- 
gram starts at $801. The second pair is the program end point- 
er, and they show it ends at $818. Using this information let's 
examine the program data by typing in: 

801 L 

You should get: 

*801L 

0801- 10 08 BPL $080B 

0803- OA ASL 

0804- 00 BRK 

0805- 97 ???

To understand this, let's break it down one section at a 
time. When the Apple stores a line of Basic, it encodes each 
keyword as a single byte token. Thus the world print is stored 
as a $BA. This does wonders for conserving space. In addition, 
there is some basic overhead associated with packaging the 
line, namely a byte to signify the end of the line, and a few 
bytes at the beginning of each line to hold information related 
to the length of the line, and also the line number itself. 

To be more specific:

The first two bytes of every line of an Applesoft program 
are an index to the address of the beginning of the next line. At 
$801,802 we find the address $810 (bytes reversed). This is 
where line 20 starts. At $810 we find the address $816. This is 
where the next line would start if there were one. The double 00 
at $816 tells Applesoft that this is the end of the Basic listing. It 
is important to realize that the 00 00 end of the Applesoft pro- 
gram usually, but not always, corresponds to the contents of 
$AF,B0. It is possible to hide machine language code between 
the end of the line data and the actual end as indicated by 
$AF,BO — but more on that later. 

The next information within a line is the line number itself: 



0801-

The OA 00 is the two-byte form of the number ten, the line 
number of the first line of the Applesoft program. Likewise, the 
14 00 is the data for the line number twenty. The bytes are 
again reversed. After these four bytes, we see the actual 
tokens for each line.

All b5i;es with a value of $80 or greater are Applesoft key- 
words in token form. Bytes less than $80 represent normal 
ASCII data (letters of the alphabet, for example). Examining 
the data here we see a $97 followed by $3A. $97 is the token for 
home, and $3A the colon. Next, $BA is the token for print. This 
is followed by the quote ($22) knd the text for HELLO (48 45 4C 
4C 4F) and the closing quote ($22) . Last of all, the 00 indicates 
the end of the line. 

In line number twenty, the $80 is the token for end. As be- 
fore, the line is terminated with a 00. 

When a program is executed, the interpreter scans through 
the data. Each time it encounters a token, such as the print 
token, it looks up the value in a table to see what action should 
be taken. In the case of print, this would be to output the char- 
acters following the token, namely "HELLO". 

This constant translation is the reason for the use of the 
term interpreter for Applesoft Basic. 

Machine code on the other hand is directly executable by 
the 6502 microprocessor and hence is much faster, since no ta- 
ble lookups are required. 

In Applesoft, a syntax error is generated whenever a series 
of tokens is encountered that is not consistent with what the in- 
terpreter expects to find. 

Passing Variables. So, back to the point of all this. The key 
to passing variables to your own machine language routines is 
to work with Applesoft in terms of routines already present in 
the machine. One of the simplest methods was described in the 
October 1981 issue of Softalk, wherein a given variable is the 
very first one defined in your program (see the input routine) . 
This is okay, but rather restrictive. A better way is to name the 
variable you're dealing with right in the call statement. 

The important points here are two components of the Ap- 
plesoft interpreter: TXTPTR and CHRGET (and related rou- 
tines) . 

TXTPTR is the two-byte pointer ($B8, B9) that points to the

Though it is very simple to use, the Dithertizer II represents 
the ultimate in video digitizing using the Apple II 
computer. The Dithertizer is an interface card which 
converts video input into digitized images. Because the 
Dithertizer II is a frame grabber, DMA type digitizer, it 
offers extreme high speed in the conversion process (it 
grabs an entire frame in 1/60th of a second). The camera 
supplied with the package is the Sanyo model VC1610X. 
Cabling is supplied for this camera so as to have the 
Dithertizer II system up and running in minutes. The video 
camera used for input must have external sync to allow 
for the frame grabber technology employed for digitizing. 
If a camera other than the model recommended is used, 
wiring adaptations by the user may be required. Software 
is supplied with the board to allow you to display up to 64 
pseudo grey levels on your Apple's screen. The number 
of grey levels may be changed with one keystroke. The 
intensity and contrast of the image are controllable via 
game paddles. Also supplied is software for image 
contouring for those interested in movement detection 
or graphic design applications. 



The Dithertizer II package Is available ready 
to run with camera, Interface card and

The Applesoft calling program would then be revised to 
read: 

10 INPUT "PITCH DURATION? ",P,D 
20 CALL 768,P,D 
30 PRINT 
40 GOTO 10 

This is a much more elegant way of passing the values and 
also requires no miscellaneous memory locations as such (al- 
though for purposes of simplicity the tone routine itself still 
uses the same zero page locations.) 

The secret to the new technique is the use of the routine 
COMBYTE ($E74C) . This is an Applesoft routine which checks 
for a comma and then returns a value between $00 and $FF 
(0-255) in the X register. 

It is normally used for evaluating pofees, hcolor=, and so 
forth, but does the job very nicely here. It also leaves TXTPTR 
pointing to the end of the line (or a colon if there was one) by 
using CHRGET to advance TXTPR appropriate to the num- 
ber of characters following each comma. Note also that any 
legal expression — such as (X-5)/2 — can be used to pass the 
data. 

To verify the importance of managing TXTPTR, try put- 
ting a simple RTS ($60) at $300. Calling this you will get a 
SYNTAX ERROR, since upon return, Applesoft's TXTPTR 
will be on the first comma, and the phrase ",P,D" is not a le- 
gal Applesoft expression. 

Now what about two-bjrte quantities? To do this, a number 
of other routines are used. For example, this routine will do the 
equivalent of a two- byte pointer po/ce. Suppose for instance you

wanted to store the bytes for the address $9600 at locations 
$1000, 1001. Normally in Applesoft you would do it like this: 



50 POKE 4096,0: POKE 4097,150 



Where 4096 and 4097 are the decimal equivalents of $1000 and 
$1001 and 0 and 150 are the low-order and high-order bytes for 
the address $9600 ($96 = 150, $00 = 0). 

A more convenient approach might be like this: 



50 CALL 768, 4096, 38400

The special items in this routine include CHKCOM, a syn- 
tax-checking routine that serves two purposes. First it verifies 
that a command follows the call address, and secondly it ad- 
vances TXTPTR to point to the first byte of the expression im- 
mediately following the comma. If a comma is not found, a 
syntax error is generated. 

FRMNUM is a routine that evaluates any expression and 
puts the real floating-point number result into Applesoft's float- 
ing-point accumulator, usually called FAC. This is a six-byte 
pseudo register ($97-9C) used to hold the floating-point repre- 
sentation of a number. It includes such nifties as the exponen- 
tial magnitude of the number and the equivalent of the digits of 
the logarithm of the number stored. 

At this stage you'd have to be something of a masochist to 
want to deal with the number in its current form, so the next 
step is used to convert it into a two-bjde integer. 

GETADR does this by putting the two-byte result into LIN- 
NUM, LINNUM+1 ($50,51). 

Even if this is not exactly an in-depth explanation of all the 
most precise details of the operation, the bottom line is that the 
three JSRs (CHKCOM, FRMNUM, and GETADR) will al- 
ways end up with the low-order and high-order bytes of what- 
ever expression follows a comma in LINNUM and LIN- 
NUM -hi. 

These simple subroutines should be quite adequate for 
many applications. Next month, however, we'll look at string 
passing, some of the various other routines available, and how 
to pass data back to the casing Applesoft program. 3M

□ Round one in the legal brouhaha be- 
tween On-Llne Systems and Atari went to 
On-Line Systems. A federal Judge in 
Fresno denied Atari's petition to prevent 
On-Une from shipping Jawbreaker on the 
grounds that it infringed on the audiovi- 
sual copyright held on Pac-Man. 

The ruling only affected Atari's re- 
quest for an injunction and did not go to 
the heart of the issue of infringement, a 
question presumably to be settled at a 
later date. 

Atari's suit alleging infringement 
countered a prior On-Line suit against 
Atari alleging restraint of trade. 

It was the second such defeat for Atari 
in a week. Earlier, in a Chicago federal 
court, Magnavox had been successful in 
preventing Atari from getting an injunc- 
tion ag£iinst K.C. Munchkin, Magna- 
vox's eat-the-dots game for its Odyssey 
machine. 

□ Edu-Ware Services and its gaming 
branch Interactive Fantasies had the ex- 



citement of moving from their Canoga 
Park facility to new offices in Agoura, 
California, dampened considerably by 
thieves early in the dawn of December 
7 — once more a day of infamy. The 
break-in occurred when much of the com- 
pany's equipment was conveniently 
packed and stacked for the move. Rob- 
bers simply grabbed the ready-to-ship 
cartons but proved to be computer il- 
literate when they tried for the still-set-up 
Apple belonging to Edu-Ware 's chair- 
man and director of research services, 
Sherwln Steffln. They couldn't manage to 
disconnect the computer but destroyed a 
controller card in the attempt. 

Among the equipment the scoundrels 
took was Edu-Ware president and pre- 
miere programmer Dave Mulllch's per- 
sonal Apple. Other pieces included other 
Apples, monitors, a printer, a dicta- 
phone, and part of the company's intern- 
al business software. Steffln estimated 
the loss as between fifteen and eighteen 





thousand dollars' worth; that the thieves 
confined their activities to the upstairs of 
the two-floor facility saved Edu-Ware 
from far more disastrous losses. 

Investigating police warn that thefts 
of personal and business computers are 
skyrocketing. Today's thieves have en- 
tered the computer age, the officers said, 
and they know the market for word pro- 
cessors and computer systems. 

If you deal with new or used equip- 
ment, watch for the following pieces 
stolen from Edu-Ware, here listed with 
serial numbers where available. If you 
should come across one, notify your lo-

Starfire 5. The disk drive that wont play hide-and-seek 




What do we mean by that? 

You chose the Apple II, and it's a good 
computer choice. 

But Apple diskette drives play hide-and- 
seek with your valuable data. 

And if you're not looking for a diskette, 
you're worrying about scratching one. 

Besides, they're just too slow and hold too 
little. 

That's why your Apple II needs a REAL 
business partner. 

Like Starfire 5, the 5 Megabyte Winchester 
disk from Corona. 



The one that holds 38 diskettes of data, 
available instantly, and can alphabetize 
a mailing list 5 to 10 times faster. 

The one that seals your data off from 
danger and insures it with DataGuard 
automatic data protection. 

Double-volume data files. 

And best of all, Starfire 5 lets your files be 
twice as long, beating a crucial limitation 
of Apple's disk operating system, without 
abandoning it. 

That's the kind of partner your Apple II 
needs to let it fulfill its computer promise. 



At $2995, it's quite a deal. 

So ask your dealer to show you Starfire 5 
from Corona.

JANUARY 1982 



If you want to see a brave man cringe and a grown man 
near tears, just call Mitch Kapor an instant millionaire to his 
face. 

He's actually not quite that sensitive to the charge, but he 
clearly isn't fond of the new indiistry perception of him caused 
by the announcement in November that his prior company. Mi- 
cro Finance Systems, had sold the rights to VisiTrend/Visi- 
Plot for seven-figure money to Personal Software, which had 
been the publisher of the program authored by Kapor. 

Kapor's perception of the event, bolstered by all the facts 
unknown to the rest of an envious software industry, is com- 
pletely different. 

The first thing to understand is that no seven-figure money 
will ever change hands. As these things are done in the world of 
that size finance, the payments are spread out some to avoid 
the more obvious income tax repercussions that a lump sum 
payment would entail. 

Another factor to reckon with is that Micro Finance Sys- 
tems was a partnership of Kapor and Eric Rosenfeld. Clearly, 
some of the proceeds went to the lesser known partner. 

The Skyrocket Was a Local. Finally, instant hardly de-

scribes the path that's taken Kapor from being a high school 
math prodigy to master of his own fate at Lotus Development 
Company. 

What is Lotus Development Company? It's Kapor's new 
firm. Micro Finance Systems only had the one product, so it 
was dissolved upon completion of the sale. Kapor formed Lo- 
tus to keep his momentum going. But that's a tale for later in 
this yam. 

That Kapor's product was the first in the Apple market to 
draw such big figures has about it an aura of the incredible. Af- 
ter all, he didn't have the big system programming expe- 
rience of Stanley Crane of DB Master fame or Robert Franks- 
ton of VisiCalc notoriety or Ken Williams of On-Line Systems. 

Instead, Kapor's path led from being a disk jockey in Hart- 
ford, Connecticut, through teaching transcendental medita- 
tion and mental health counseling before he became a com- 
puter hobbyist and tinkerer. 

It was a brash self-confidence that led him to becoming an 
Apple programmer. He had bought his Apple the previous day 
and was back in the store to look over software and get a ques- 
tion or two answered. At this time, he was unemployed, hav- 
ing just returned from the vacation that marked the end of his 
stint in mental health. 

At the store counter was a man wearing a suit and buying 
an Apple. He was asking the usual novice questions, and Ka- 
por, figuring he was an expert since he'd had his Apple all of 
one day, deigned to share his knowledge. 

It turned out the buyer was in need of some custom pro- 
gramming. Kapor figured he was at least one day ahead, and if 
he could stay ahead he'd be all right. So he sold himself as an 
Apple programmer for $5 per hour. 

Harvard's Loss. But it isn't as if Kapor embarked upon 
such an intellectual endeavor unequipped. 

He had been a true math prodigy in high school on Long Is- 
land. As a senior, he discovered a new method of calculating 
square roots using recursive equations. Actually, his was one 
of several simultaneous discoveries of the technique. 

His method was published, and he hastened to get copies of 
the paper to all the universities to which he had applied for ad- 
mission as additional evidence of his worthiness. All the uni- 
versities, that is, except Harvard, which is where his heart 
was. Kapor had been led to believe that entrance into Harvard 
was assured, so he failed to fire off this proof of his intellectual 
worthiness for matriculation. 

The result was that of all the universities to which he ap- 
plied. Harvard was the single entity that refused him admis- 
sion. Kapor was stuck with Yale, although his heart has re- 
mained at Harvard, as evidenced by the location of his compa- 
ny in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 

Kapor entered the mathematics program at Yale, but 
changed majors after a few weeks. It was 1967, a period when 
college students were more interested in protesting the war in 
Vietnam than in studying. Kapor joined the campus radio sta- 
tion and drifted away from mathematics into current events. 

His eventual major was cybernetics. 

From Yale, he became a disk jockey in Hartford and got in- 
terested in TM. Eventually he spent a year in Europe, study- 
ing the discipline. 

After a brief stint in marketing research in Boston, he got 
into TM full-time until he became disillusioned, feeling that it 
not only wasn't solving the world's problems, it wasn't solving 
his problems either. In retrospect, he thinks he expected too 
much of it. 

Subsequently, he went back to school and obtained the mas- 
ter of arts degree in counseling psychology. He became a 
mental health aide at a psychiatric hospital and soon learned 
"the best contribution I could make to the mental health field 
was to leave it." 

It was then that he bought his Apple and talked his way into 
the job of contract programmer. 

Getting Together. That first programming job was only fif- 
teen hours a week, which left him plenty of time, but not much 
money. He realized that the best way to find other Apple own- 



ers who might require custom programming services was to 
join a user group. 

Alas, there were none. 

But in a copy of Micro, he saw an article written by Rich- 
ard Suitor. He called Suitor, who did know of other Apple own- 
ers. They met and agreed to form a user group. The first meet- 
ing, in Kapor's living room, was attended by seven persons. 

Eventually, Kapor foimd enough other clients who wanted 
custom programming to make it a real occupation. But in the 
meantime, he became a professional collector of early Apple 
software. 

In those days, before the dawn of the professional pro- 
grammer, programs were traded by the authors for other pro- 
grams through user group channels. Kapor collected nearly 
sixty disks of public domain software. 

During that period he met his future partner, Rosenfeld, 
who was then a graduate student at Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. Rosenfeld was deeply involved in a graduate re- 
search project that needed hours of computer time to perform 
multiple regression operations, but he had run out of money to 
buy the time on the Institute's computer. 

Tiny Troll — New Adventure? Kapor looked at Rosenfeld's 
requirements and agreed that the Apple could be made to per- 
form the functions that Rosenfeld needed for his research. Pro- 
gramming in Basic and creating from scratch a tiny interpre- 
ter as he went, Kapor proceeded to create Tiny Troll, the first 
statistical analysis package sold for the Apple. 

Tiny Troll went on to sell slightly more than one thousand 
copies even though it was never advertised or promoted. Tiny 
Troll was the basic program from which VisiTrend/VisiPlot 
eventuated, although the geographical connection is not as di- 
rect as one might assume, considering that Personal Software 
started in Cambridge during the same period Kapor was there. 

Actually, Kapor did not come in contact with the Personal 
team until after Personal had moved to California. Kapor had 
met Robert Frankston, coauthor of VisiCalc. Frankston Intro-

duced Kapor to Peter Jennings, one of Personal's founders. 

Personal asked Kapor to add "a couple" of features to Tiny 
Troll and bring It out as a VlslProduct. The prototype finished, 
they offered Kapor a full-time position as new products man- 
ager and offered him stock options as an additional induce- 
ment to get him to move to California. 

Kapor took the bait and was immediately thrown into the 
introduction of CAA Data Management System. That took so 
much of his time that he was unable to concentrate on spruc- 
ing up Tiny Troll. One reason for this was that "I was so in- 
spired by VisiCalc that I kept adding elements to my own pro- 
gram to try to match the quality." 

The Wrong Personality. He had Joined Personal in March 
1980, after the successful introduction of VisiCalc, so his stock 
options looked like money in the bank. But Kapor foxind he 
didn't like the California lifestyle and missed the Harvard 
Square environs. He also found out that he was too much the 
free spirit to work in the controlled environment of Personal, 
even when the company was relatively small. 

So Kapor gave back his stock options in return for his re- 
lease from his employment obligation and retiimed to Cam- 
bridge. There he concentrated on VisiTrend/VisiPlot. Be- 
cause he wasn't working, he had to borrow money to keep go- 
ing, eventually digging a $30,000 hole. 

In addition, he was working under conditions that weren't 
exactly ideal. He didn't even have a printer to get hard copy of 
the 60K of code he packed into the programs. The program 
kept growing as he conceived further enhancements to Tiny 
Troll. 

In sum, the couple of additions he contracted for with Per- 
sonal in spring of 1980 took over a year to hit the market in 
greatly expanded form. 

So when someone calls Kapor an instant millionaire, he has 



every reason to shudder. 

The Opening of the Lotus. Regardless of whether he's 
earned the title of millionaire, Instant or not, he's not resting on 
his laurels. Lotus now has four full-time programmers among 
its nine employees, situated in a twenty-five hundred square 
foot facility on Central Square in Cambridge, not far from the 
headquarters of Software Arts. 

Kapor is readying for release his first product under the Lo- 
tus label. Executive Briefing System, which he categorizes as 
the ultimate in show and tell. EBS is a graphics package that 
will make it easy for businessmen to prepare colorful slide 
briefings for conferences directly on their Apple. 

Although Kapor proved with Tiny Troll and Visi- 
Trend/VisiPlot that he can program, he doesn't consider him- 
self a computer person in the sense that he can converse 
knowledgeably about the speed in megahertz of a given chip. 
At Lotus, he confines himself to designing the projects on 
which the company works. 

Kapor feels that there are surprisingly few excellent soft- 
ware packages available at present. He views software devel- 
opment as being in the Stone Age in terms of ordinary people 
using the products. 

Perhaps one reasonf for this, he believes, is that it takes so 
long — perhaps more than a year — ^to develop a comprehensive 
piece of excellent business software. That kind of investment is 
so great that most software publishers opt for goals that in- 
clude more frequent product introductions of software that is 
narrower in scope. 

High Quality Takes Time. Kapor is great believer in the 
theory that you can't throw manpower at a software bottle- 
neck. Instead, he prefers to approach the problems of soft- 
ware development more systematically. 

In his view, good software development methodology is vl-

tal to a successful programming endeavor. Kapor is fond of the 
filmmaking metaphor. As in making a movie, in software he 
believes you need structured groups with defined purposes. 
However, there's room for improvisation in the development 
of software, just as there is room for improvisation during 
filming. 

One of Kapor's fears is that the personal computer user will 
become so inured to inadequate software that no demand for 
quality will ensue. Considering the potential of the personal 
computer, that could be the ultimate tragedy. 

To combat the trend toward mediocre software, Lotus im- 
plemented stringent development techniques. Kapor designs 
the software and works in conjunction with his four in-house 
programmers to maintain high standards of implementation. 
With a programming crew that's comprised of big system pro- 
grammers and hobbyists-turned- pro, Kapor has a versatile 
mix of experience from which to draw during development 
phases. 

Visicalc was a major breakthrough in software and the 
microcomputer industry is awaiting the next such milestone. 
Until a new standard of excellence is set by a new package, 
Kapor believes the VisiCalc standard is the one to shoot for. A 
higher level of performance of better software tools for the end 
user, rather than what he terms "bit tiddling," should be the 
goal of all software producers. 

Invisible Language Ahead. Lotus's long-range aspirations 
may include the development of an applications generator. 
Kapor hopes to take programming away from the program- 
mers by designing a programming language that doesn't look 
like a programming language. 

A watchword to Kapor is that it's up to the individuals to in- 
vent the future. Many applications now are possible but will 



not be practical until hardware and systems become more 
capable. 

Two areas that he believes augur promise for the future are 
videotext and artificial intelligence. Videotext — what might 
become a utility for computer use in the same sense that the 
telephone is a utility for communications — should contribute 
consumer services and information services. Data bases for 
the home user and new applications technology may become 
available through videotext channels. 

Kapor is much taken with the C/B option on CompuServe. 
The service simulates on 36 channels the C/B environment of 
the open road. The immediacy of the medium has suggested 
"all sorts" of possibilities to Kapor. 

The development of artificial intelligence, Kapor concedes, 
is far more blue sky than information utilities, but he feels the 
technology has much to offer. 

Double Vision. In December, Lotus moved to strengthen its 
position in the market by establishing Professional Software 
Technology Inc., a joint ventiore of Lotus and Pansophics Ltd. 
PST will handle marketing and distribution of Lotus products 
and the Pansophics line of spread sheet application models for 
VisiCalc and SuperCalc. 

Kapor and Bob Ramsdell, president of Pansophics, also 
contemplate PST as serving as publisher for a small, select 
group of third-party software developers. 

Even with this evidence of Kapor's commitment to the 
microcomputer software industry, he continues to protest that 
he's no computer cognoscente and doesn't intend to get him- 
self totally immersed in microcomputers to the exclusion of 
other interests. 

But as the man said, "Methlnks he doth protest too much."

PUT ONE OVER 
ON APPLE II. ^ ^ 



Introducing Station II. 

The Apple II Support System. 





What happens when you put one over on Apple II? You 
make it better. Because Station 11 organizes, simplifies, 
protects, secures and lets you control access to your 
Apple. In other words, it makes your Apple II your 
personal computer. 

rrS DESIGNED FOR n-GETHERNESS. 

Station II is designed specifically for Apple II by 
design consultants to Apple Com- 
puter. It pulls your Apple and peri- 
pherals together into an attractive, easy- 
to-use, integrated system. 

Yoiu" Apple is free to slide in and out, so 
there's no unstacking and restacking peri- 
pherals everytime you need to get inside. 
And you can choose the distance from 
keyboard to monitor that's most com- 
fortable for you. Station II even posi- 
tions your monitor at just the right 
an^e for maximum viewing 
ease. 

IT CLEARS YOUR DESK OF 
CORDS AND CABLES. 

Station II is equipped 
with three built-in power 
outlets, so the cords and 
cables that normally clutter 
your work area are tucked away neatly 
inside. Now one cord. Station II's own, 
powers your entire system. 

Apple and Apple 11 are registered trademarks of Apple Computer. 






THE KEY IS SECURITY 
AND CONVENIENCE. 

You're not the only one who's 
discovered the value of ^, 
Apple II, so Station II has a key. 
And a lock. And two ways to 
secure it. Now you can slide your V 
Apple inside, lock it and leave it. 
Safe and sound. It puts the clamps on 
theft, and beyond tiiat, you control 
who gets inside your Apple and who 
doesn't 

Your programs are safe, too. Because 
Station II has a Mne voltage surge sup- 

Eressor, ready to intercept power surges 
efore they can wipe out your program. 
What's more, the key means conven- 
ience. With one twist 
of the wrist you can 
power up your entire 
system. Plus, you can lock 
your Apple "on" or "off." 
rr MAKES YOUR APPLE 
MORE FRUITFUL. 
That's what happens when you put 
one over on Apple II. So look for 
Station II at your computer dealer.

Tools of the Craft, Part 7 : 
Milestones 

Our progress down the Pascal Path has taken us through all 
the important elementary language topics (with the exception 
of simple data input, which will be discussed very soon), and 
we are about to enter "advanced Pascal" territory. Depend- 
ing upon how long you've followed the Path, you've been 
exposed to the following essential subjects: assignments (Au- 
gust 1981) ; comments (November 1981) ; compiler syntax er- 
ror messages (May 1981) ; constants (named) vs. literals (July 
1981); control-flow, conditional [IF-THEN, IF-THEN-ELSE 
(October 1981), CASE (December 1981)]; control-flow, repeti- 
tive [REPEAT-UNTIL (September 1981), WHILE-DO, FOR 
(October 1981)]; data and data types, concept of (July 1981) ; 
data types, fundamental [Char, iiteger, Real, Boolean] (July 
1981) ; data types, user-defined (July 1981) ; expressions and 
operators (August 1981) ; identifiers, formation of (March 
1981) ; keywords vs. identifiers (March 1981) ; output format- 
ting (November 1981) ; program, general form of (March, 
June 1981) ; progprams, preparation and execution of, using 
Pascal operating system, editor, and compiler (February, 
April, May, June 1981) ; statement, compound (October 1981) ; 
syntax ("railroad") diagrams (June 1981) ; variables (August 
1981); Write, WriteLn, definition of (November 1981). 

It's important for you to be comfortable with these con- 
cepts, because I am going to take them for granted from now 
on. The "advanced" topics, which we'll begin this month, 
usually concern methods by which you can use the elemen- 
tary techniques more efficiently and with greater sophistica- 
tion. Stated another way, Pascal's "advanced" techniques and 
features are all but useless to anyone who is not familiar with 
the fundamentals. So, if you need to review, please take a mo- 
ment to consult the appropriate back issues of Softalk. (I'll 
wait here for you.) 

PROCEDURES. What They Are. You've seen how to use 
the keywords BEGIN and END to group several statements to- 
gether into a single compound statement. Pascal also permits 
you to give a name to a compound statement, thus turning it in- 
to a PROCEDURE. For example, here is a compound state- 
ment that sends a dumb message to the console screen: 

BEGIN (* Dumb Msg *) 

WriteLnC This is a compound statement.'); 

WriteLn(' It generates a dumb message.'); 
END (* Dumb Msg *); 

This compound becomes a PROCEDURE named 
"DumbMsg" if you move it into the declaration area and pref- 
ace it with the following procedure heading: 

PROCEDURE 
DumbMsg; 

Finally, here's a program that contains and uses 
DumbMsg. 



PROGRAM 
ProcDemo; 
PROCEDURE 

DumbMsg; 
BEGIN (* Dumb Msg *) 

WriteLnf This is a compound statement.'); 

WriteLn(* It generates a dumb message.'); 
END {* Dumb Msg *); 

BEGIN (* Demo *) 

WriteLn('Going to call Dumb Msg:'); 
DumbMsg; 

WriteLnC . . . and we"re backl'); 
END (* Demo ♦). 

The preceedlng example illustrates several important 
points about the declaration and use of PROCEDURES: 
A PROCEDURE, like any other object in a Pascal pro-

ated you just fill in the blanks. Looking 
up what you've filed is just as easy. PFS 
can search for a number, a single piece of 
data, a word within a page of text, or 
any combination. All forms that match 
are displayed on the screen for browsing, updating, ex- 
panding, or printing. PFS can even create mailing labels. 

PFS: REPORT, the personal report system, uses 
the files PFS creates to produce a report tailored Co your

gram, is defined in the program's declaration area. PROCE- 
DURE declarations are placed between the VAR section and 
the start of the program body. 

In its simplest form, the procedure heading consists of the 
keyword PROCEDURE, followed by an identifier that names 
the PROCEDURE, then a semicolon. 

A procedure body is a compound statement, just as a pro- 
gram body is. However, the main program body is always fol- 
lowed by a period. In contrast, a procedure body is always fol- 
lowed by a semicolon. 

"DumbMsg" is an example of a simple procedure. 

The name of such a PROCEDURE may be used as a state- 
ment in your program, Jiast as "DumbMsg" is used in the body 
of the ProcDemo main program. 

When you use the name of a PROCEDURE in this way, you 
are said to be calling that PROCEDURE. 

Whenever a PROCEDURE is called, the statements in its 
body are executed as if they actually occur in the program at 
the point of the call. Let's run through PROGRAM ProcDemo, 
to see this process in action: 

When the program is executed, the first Pascal statement 
encountered by the computer is, of course, the first statement 
in the main program body. In "ProcDemo," this is a WriteLn. 
Next, DumbMsg is called. Now execution of the main pro- 
gram body is postponed while the body of DumbMsg is exe- 
cuted. The two WriteLn statements in DumbMsg are dis- 
patched, and execution of the main program body resumes 
with the statement that follows the call to DumbMsg (in this 
case, another WriteLn). Here is the output generated by 
DumbMsg: 

Going to call DumbMsg: 
This is a compound statement. 
It generates a dumb message. 
. . . and we're backl 

Worlds within Worlds. The DumbMsg example suggests 
that PROCEDURES and PROGRAMS are very much alike. In 
fact, they are identical in nearly every respect, except, of 
course, that their headings begin with different keywords 
(PROGRAM vs. PROCEDURE) and their bodies terminate 
with different punctuation symbols (period vs. semicolon). 
Figure 1 shows the syntax diagram for a PROCEDURE. 

PROCEDURES are self-contained sub-programs, true 
"worlds within worlds," even to the point of including, at the 
programmer's option, their own declaration sections. Any ob- 
jects that are declared within PROCEDURES are unknown to.

and cannot be manipulated by, the main program (the "call- 
er"). Such objects are said to be local to the PROCEDURE. 

Conversely, anything defined in the main program's decla- 
ration section, prior to the declaration of a PROCEDURE, is 
known to, and can be manipulated by, that PROCEDURE. 
These objects are said to be global to the entire PROGRAM. 

Examine the program Scopel, below. The Integer variable 
I is introduced in the program's declaration area, and there- 
fore is global. The variable J, however, is defined within Procl, 
and so is local to that PROCEDURE and unavailable to the 
main program. You can't refer to J in the program body with- 
out causing a syntax error (#104, "undeclared identifier"). 

However, you can, and I do, refer to I in the body of Procl.

Procl displays a 5-to-l countdown, using J to control a RE- 
PEAT loop. The main program calls Procl from within a 
WHILE loop that is controlled by the value in the global vari- 
able I. This loop counts up, from 1 to 6. Here is the output that 
Scopel produces: 

(main body)= 1 
(Procl)= 1: 54321 

(main body)= 2 
(Procl )= 2: 54321 

(main body)= 3 
(Procl)= 3: 54321 

(main body)= 4 
(Proc1)= 4: 54321 

(main body)= 5 
(Proc1)= 5: 54321 

Notice that the values reported for I are Identical in both the 
main body and Procl. We expect this, of course, since I is de- 
fined in only one place. It makes sense that the identifier I re- 
fers to the same variable everywhere throughout Scopel. 

Scope2, shown below, was derived from Scopel by chang- 
ing the output format only slightly, and by turning all refer- 
ences to J in Procl into references to I, not Just in Prod's body, 
but in its declaration area as well. This leads to a redefinition 
of I in Procl. You might think that Pascal would not permit 
this, but, in fact, it does. Notice that the duplicate definitions 
occur in separate declaration areas. Had they occurred in the 
same VAR section, this would have caused the Pascal com-

piler to reject the second one as redundant. But Procl is a 
world unto itself, and if it needs its own variable I, the Peuical 
compiler is more than happy to oblige. 

Thus, in Scope2, a local variable I supersedes the global 
variable I whenever Procl is executing. That is, within the 
body of Procl, every use of the identifier I refers to the local I, 
and not the global one.

WHILE (I < 5) DO 
BEGIN (* WHILE *) 
I := 1 + 1; 

WriteLnf 1 (main body after Prod) = ',1:1); 
Prod; 

WriteLn(M (main body after Prod) = ',1:1); 
WriteLn; 
END (* WHILE *); 
END (* Scope2 *). 

Prod's local I is entirely separate from the global I; the 
two are related only by virtue of having the same name. 

Changing the value of the local I within Procl doesn't, in 
any way, affect the value stored in the global I, as you can see 
by examining Scope2's output: 

(main body before Proc1)= 1 
(Proc1)= 5: 54321 
(main body after Prod) = 1 

(main body before Prod)= 2 
(Proc1)= 5: 54321 
(main body after Prod) = 2 

(main body before Proc1)= 3 
(Prod)= 5: 54321 
(main body after Prod) = 3 

(main body before Proc1)= 4 
(Proc1)= 5: 54321 
(main body after Prod) = 4 

(main body before Prod)= 5 
(Prod)= 5; 54321 
(main body after Procl) = 5 

Now, edit Scope2 by deleting the VAR section in Prod's 
declaration area. (If you wish, you may change the name of f 
this altered version of Scope2 to Scope3, but since the textual 
differences between the two programs are so minor, I won't 
waste space by listing "Scope3" here.) Compile the altered 
program, but don't execute It until you have considered the 
consequences of the change you have made. 

By eliminating the local definition of I in Procl, you force 
the main program to share its variable I with Prod, exactly as 
it did in the Scopel example. This might be reasonable if all 
Procl ever did was determine and use the value of I, without 
changing it, but, of course, it does change it.

JANUARY 1982 



Specifically, every call to Procl resets I to 0, becaiise of the 
countdown action of the PROCEDURE'S internal REPEAT 
loop. As long as there was a local definition of I in Procl, that 
PROCEDURE could change the value of its own, private, var- 
iable I without affecting the behavior of the main program. 
However, under the present circumstances, the changes in I 
that occur during the execution of Procl have a profound ef- 
fect on the WHILE loop in the main program. As I'm sure you 
can see, the WHILE loop can never terminate, since, for every 
iteration, Procl is called with 1=1. Procl then resets I to 0, and, 
at the start of the next cycle, I is incremented back to 1 again. 
The loop cannot help but repeat indefinitely. The type of situa- 
tion encountered in "Scope3" happens often to those who ha- 
bitually use PROCEDURES to manipulate global objects. If 
there are a lot of PROCEDURES In a program, most of which 
access global things, it is hard to tell when and if two PRO- 
CEDURES are working at cross purposes with respect to the 
same global object. The programmer misst take great pains to 
keep track of how global objects are being accessed through- 
out the program, in order to avoid bizarre and confusing con- 
flicts between PROCEDURES. All this effort is usually 
wasted, since a PROCEDURE rarely needs to use or change a 
global object. In the example above, for instance, the local var- 
iable I served as well as the global one for controlling Prod's 
loop — even better, because no strange side effects could pos- 
sibly occur, no matter how often the value in the local I was 
changed. 

In later columns, we'll see instances where the intelligent 
and careful sharing of global objects between PROCEDURES 
can simplify the job of programming, by making it easier for 
cooperating PROCEDURES to communicate with each other. 
In most cases, however, you should design a PROCEDURE to 
do a small job with as little knowledge of, and influence on, the 
"outside world" as possible. That is, you should insulate your 
PROCEDURES as completely as possible from the main pro-

gram, and from any other PROCEDURES. The more self-suf- 
ficient a PROCEDURE is— relying on its own local objects 
rather than global ones— the less other PROCEDURES can in- 
terfere with it, and the less it, in turn, can interfere with other 
PROCEDURES. This general (and somewhat vague) princi- 
ple will be brought into greater focus in future columns, as we 
delve further into program design. For now, until you're fa- 
miliar with all the considerations involved: don't access glo- 
bal variables from within PROCEDURES. 

Why Use PROCEDURES? PROCEDURES (and FUNC- 
TIONS, which we'll investigate soon) are commonly used to 
achieve one or more of the following ends: 

Better Program Readability. I've always felt that a good 
main program should not be more than a printed page or two 
in length, so that anyone who tries to read it can have a fight- 
ing chance of taking it all in at a glance. Sometimes, however, 
there is just too much to do ! A process that is simple to con- 
ceive may, in fact, translate into tens, hundreds, or even thou- 
sands of Pascal statements. When a program starts getting too 
long, you can almost certainly identify important sub-proc- 
esses that themselves consist of many statements. You can iso- 
late these sub-processes as PROCEDURES, giving each a 
name that aptly describes its function. In so doing, you in- 
crease the legibility of the original main program by making it 
not only smaller, but clearer, since huge blocks of code are re- 
placed with PROCEDURE names that mean much more to a 
human reader than long sequences of Pascal statements. 
(Note that this pruning technique can be applied to long, un- 
wieldy PROCEDURES, as well ; if a PROCEDURE is too long, 
break it into several more manageable ones. 

Easier Maintenance and Modification. An electronic com- 
ponent that is constructed from interconnected plug-in printed 
circuit boards, each of which performs a specific function, is 
much easier to service or upgrade than one where all the elec- 
tronic parts are wired to a single, large board. If something 
goes wrong with the former, the problem can usually be traced 
to a board, which is then unplugged and replaced by another. 
This is certainly easier than pulling out an entire majiter cir- 
cuit board and tr jdng to trace through its many connections to 
isolate a malfunction. 

In the same way, a program that includes many smaller 
PROCEDURES will usually be easier to improve or trouble- 
shoot than one which consists only of one or two gargantuans. 
For example, if you need to debug one of the PROCEDURES 
and you have been careful to avoid global access except in 
rare, well understood cases, you can rewrite and adjust the ail- 
ing PROCEDURE to your heart's content without worrying 
about introducing mystifyingly strange behavior in another 
PROCEDURE. F^hermore, if you find a better way to do 
something, and you have been thoughtful in your program de- 
sign, you can easily replace one PROCEDURE with another 
that, although it serves the same purpose, tuses the new meth- 
od or technique. 

Avoids Needless Reinvention. As you program more and 
more, you'll find that you write a lot of the same code over and 
over to solve programming problems that occur frequently. 
When I catch myself doing this, I try to write a general PRO- 
CEDURE that solves the problem once and for all. I have been 
keeping a library of such PROCEDURES for several years 
now. Whenever one of my programs needs to perform one of 
these common tasks, I arrange for the appropriate PROCE- 
DURE to be included in the compilation. One of the goals of the 
Pascal Path series is to teach you how to do the same thing, 
and so speed to completion your own projects. 

Certainly my list of motivations for using PROCEDURES is 
not an exhaustive one. Perhaps you can think of a few more by 
yourself. In any case, we'll be dealing with PROCEDURES for 
the rest of the series, so you'll no doubt have ample opportu- 
nity to add to the list. Next time, I'll talk about how to send 
news of the outside world into PROCEDURES without relying 
on global variables. There should also be room to begin talk- 
ing about FUNCTIONS. I'd love to have you along for the ride.

Apple-Cat II is a superb 
direct modem. 

But it's a good deal more than 
that. It's a full personal communica- 
tion system that opens up the out- 
side world to your computer. 

You can access data banks. 
Swap programs. Work with your 
office computer from home. All in 
the simplest, easiest, most 
logical way. 

Programmed, 
ready-to-use. 

All functions are fully pro- 
grammed. Insert the Novation 
Apple II diskette and you're ready 
to start talking with the world. It's 
self-prompting. No homework 
needed. 

Set it on automatic 

Your Apple can run on its own 
with automatic dial, answer and 
disconnect. The system uses your 
computer memory to hold mes- 
sages, so you can send and receive 
automatically any time— including 
the late hours of the night when 
line charges are lowest. 



And the variety of speeds 
available lets you save even more. 
Switch from the standard 110 or 300 
baud to 1200 baud (it's 202 compat- 
ible) and suddenly you're moving 
data four times faster. 

New full duplex 
212 option 

Now for the quickest, most 
convenient communication, 
212 full duplex is available. An ad- 
ditional card just slips into yOur 
Apple. It comes with a complete 



212 Comware II compatible software 
package which includes current 
upgrades for the entire system. This 
can be added to existing Apple-Cat 
II cards so you can start with a 212 
or start with the basic Apple-Cat II 
and upgrade later. 





Simple, quick 
installation. In less 
than 10 minutes 
you can plug 
your computer into 
the world. 





It's a phone. 



With automatic dial, it's a 
handy intelligent phone for regular 
use. But also, you can switch from 
voice to data at any time without 
losing the connection. 




Important "built-ins" 

The Serial RS-232 port to run 
your printer is built-in. No need 
for the expense and trouble of a 
separate card. 

A BSR controller is also built- 
in. Along with a conventional BSR 
system, it lets you control electric 

appliances, lights, 
whatever through 
your computer — 
even by phone. Add a 
real time clock and you 
can program it to be 
activated whenever you want.

^Applesoft 



kyDougCarist^ 



Basic is probably the most popular 
computer language in the world, and Ap- 
plesoft may be the most popular dialect 
of that language. Try to learn Applesoft 
much as you would any other lan- 
guage — a couple of words at a time, with 
lots of time off for examples. As your vo- 
cabulary expands you will start saying 
increasingly complicated things. 

Those of you with Apple disk systems 
also have some additions to Applesoft 
known as the Disk Operating System (or 
DOS for short) . We will try to work these 
commands in now and anon. 

Each month will begin with a sum- 
mary of commands used for the first 
time, a little like this: 



HOME 
LIST 



PRINT 
NEW 
IF . . . THEN 
% 
HTAB 



RUN 
GOTO 



VTAB 



So let's get started. Follow the in- 
structions that came with the computer 
and get into Applesoft. You can tell that 
you are in Applesoft by the prompt char- 
acter ] that appears in front of the blink- 
ing cursor. If you see the prompt, then 
you are ready to begin. 

Type home, then press the return key. 
This will clear the screen. Next type the 
following line exactly as it appears be- 
low: 

PRINT"! AM PROGRAMMING IN APPLESOFTIII" 

Now press the return key. Voila! The 
computer did exactly as you told it, 
right? Naturally. This is what is referred 
to as immediate execution mode, which 
means that the moment you finish enter- 
ing the instruction and press return, the 
computer executes the instruction. In 
this case it printed a few words, Just as 
you asked. 

Some tasks are more complicated and 
require a whole series of instructions. 
Your Apple could be a very disruptive in- 
fluence if It interrupted you after every 
line you typed! Therefore, the powers 
that be invented the deferred execution 
mode. Try typing the following: 

10PRINT"I AM STILL AT ITIIII" 




With brother Gary and sister Kathy, 
Doug Carlston runs Broderbund Soft- 
ware in San Rafael, California. Carlston 
is the designer and programmer of Bro- 
derbund's original game series, Galactic 
Saga. So far, the series is comprised of 
Galactic Empire, Galactic Trader, Ga- 
lactic Revolution, and Tawala's Last Re- 
doubt; All are programmed primarily in 
Applesoft. 

In a previous incarnation (a year or 
two ago), Carlston was a Harvard-bred 
attorney. He's been forgiven, however. 

Press return when finished with the 
line. Nothing happens, right? Now type 
run and press retiom (you are going to 
have to press return after almost every- 
thing, so nobody is going to mention it 
from now on unless for some reason you 
aren't supposed to press it) . The number 
at the beginning of the line tells the com- 
puter to store your instruction in its 
memory and wait for the next one. It will 
not execute it until you type the word run. 
Try it. With a little bit of luck your Apple 
will perform its appointed task with a 
minimum of grumbling and then return 
control to you, flashing the Applesoft 
prompt at you to indicate that It is your 
turn once again. 

Any instruction that begins with a 
number is treated as a deferred instruc- 
tion. These instructions are automatical- 
ly stored in numerical order (regardless 



of the order in which you type them) and 
then executed one after another once you 
type run. Try typing the following lines: 

20PRINT"AND I JUST CAN'T STOP!" 
5PRINT"NOW I'M PROGRAMMING." 

Now type list. As you can see, the com- 
puter has listed the three instructions in 
proper order. It has also added a few 
spaces to make the whole thing easier to 
read. What would have happened if you 
had given two lines the same line num- 
ber? Try it, then list the program. As you 
can see, the second instruction erases the 
first and takes its place. This is the sim- 
plest and most reliable form of editing. If 
you make a mistake, press return and 
then retjrpe the line. 

If you type run, the computer will exe- 
cute your three instructions, one at a 
time. This may not seem very impres- 
sive at first, but it will grow on you. 

The real power of a computer can be 
seen when boring, repetitious jobs need 
doing. Imagine, if you will, that you have 
just been instructed to print these three 
(admittedly marvelous) lines fifty times. 
When I was in school there were a lot of 
assignments like that. However, this is 
the dawning of a new age and tedium is 
about to meet its Waterloo. Enter the Ap- 
ple computer. 

We are now going to design a genuine 
4-carat computer program. We will have 
to introduce two new concepts in order to 
write it. The first is the loop. Although 
Applesoft ordinarily takes instructions in 
numerical order, you the programmer 
can alter that state of affairs at any time 
by telling the computer to go to some in- 
struction other than the next one. 

The simplest form of loop is that 
created by the Applesoft goto command. 
Try adding the following to your pro- 
g[ram: 

40 G0T05 

Now run it. You get a lot for your 
money with that instruction, don't you? If 
you get tired of watching your words of 
wisdom roll by, press the control key at 
the left-hand side of the keyboard and 
then, without letting up on the control 
key, press the C key. This is called con-

SHIPS 



On June 5, 1982, a luxurious cruise ship wili depart from Vancouver, Canada, with several 
Apples on board. For seven days, these privileged Apples will be learning such arcane arts 
as assembly language from Roger Wagner and graphics from Ken Williams, as well as com- 
piling Applesoft programs into assembly code with Dennis Goodrow. 

Besides coming bacl( more intelligent, the Apples will be treated to the usual ship- 
board conveniences by a professional staff dedicated to providing everything a micropro- 
cessor might desire. The Apples will enjoy some of the most dramatic scenery north of Sili- 
con Gulch, stopping in Ketchikan, Juneau, and Skagway, some of the last frontier com- 
munities. They'll cruise past Glacier Bay— giving the Apples a look at a true hi-res graphic. 

Amazingly, in keeping with Softalk's policies, the Apples will be taking the tour free. Ap- 
ples craving the companionship of their owners may inquire about the cost of human par? 
ticipation by writing to: 

Softalk Cruise

trol-C. It is a good way of getting the com- 
puter's attention when it has gone off 
doing its own thing. 

The second new idea is the Applesoft 
equals sign. If you remember any math 
from school, it's a good idea to forget it 
before you look closely at an Applesoft 
equation. You will see expressions like : 

X = X + 1 

The correct way to read this expres- 
sion is: "Set the variable on the left side 
of the equal sign (X in this case) to the 
value of the expression on the righthand 
side." So, in this example, if X had been 
equal to zero, it would now be equal to 
one. If you try to reverse the equation (X 
+ 1 = X), you will utterly confuse your 
Apple. 

This sort of expression is very useful 
for keeping track of the number of times 
you have gone through a loop. Just in- 
clude such an expression inside your 
loop. Then each time the command is 
executed, X will be incremented by one. 

It's a good idea to work out the gener- 
al flow of a program before you try to sit 
down and actually program it. So we 
might draw a flowchart of this project as 
follows : 





Set counter to zero 








1 — ^ 


Print three lines 







Increment counter 



No 

> End 



The last box in this flowchart is called 
a test or a conditional branch. If the coun- 
ter is less than 50, then you want to re- 
turn to the box that prints three lines 
again. Otherwise you Just want to stop. 
You could write a conditional branch like 
this: 

40 IF X < 50 THEN GOTO 5 

(In fact, if you are in a hurry, you can 
write the same sentence: IF X < 50 
THEN 5. The goto is assumed. Your com- 
puter is really rather astute sometimes.) 

Try to write the whole program now. 
If it runs, go to the head of the class. If 
you have trouble, then look at the pro- 
gram printed at the end of this article. 

Bells and Whistles. Once you get any 
program functioning, you will want to 
tweak it a little, so that its output is at- 
tractive and readable. In our case we 
might want to introduce space between 
each set of sentences and number each 
group. Neither of these is very hard. To 
add space we can Just print a blank line 
or two. Try adding the following: 

25 PRINLPRINT

is just like the period at the end of a sen- 
tence. It's a tricky way of putting two in- 
structions on the same line. Line 25 above 
is exactly the same as : 

25 PRINT 

26 PRINT 

Using the colon is often quicker than 
typing an entire new line. It also saves a 
little bit of memory, since the computer 
doesn't have to store a new line number. 
The effect of line 25 is, as you have no 
doubt guessed, to print two lines of noth- 
ing; in other words to space down two 
lines. 

The second bell and whistle is equally 
simple. We want to type a number in 
front of each group of sentences, going 
from 1 to 50. We have already built in a 
counter (X) that counts from 0 to 49. So, 
all we have to do is print the value of X-f-1 
before each group of sentences. Right? 
(If X is 0 then X+1 will equal 1; by the 
same logic, when X finally gets up to 49, 
the last time through the loop, X-l-1 will 
be equal to 50.) 

Take a closer look at the print state- 
ments in our program. Everything that 
we have had printed so far has been en- 
closed in quotes, "like this." If we typed 
print "X+1", the Apple, as you probably 
suspected, will print: X-l-1. Try it. If, on 
the other hand, we want the computer to 
type the value of X+1 (in other words, a 
number) , all we have to do is type : print 
X+1. Try that. So, the moral of this mes- 



sage is: a print instruction will find the 
numerical value of anything it is asked to 
print and then print it, except for items 
enclosed in quotes, which will be printed 
exactly as they appear in the print in- 
struction! 

If you find this confusing, remember 
this. Any word, except for a few re- 
served words, can be used as a variable 
name. That is, it can be assigned a nu- 
merical value, which the computer will 
remember until a new value is reas- 
signed to that name. We have used X like 
this already. We set X equal to a number 
using the equals command, and the state- 
ment print X will print the number that 
we set X equal to. We'll talk more about 
this in a moment. 

Now let's type a new line 5 to read as 
follows : 

5 PRINT X+1") NOW I'M PROGRAMMING." 

It's time to run our program again 
and see what we have wrought. Go to it. 

Variables. Variables are very Impor- 
tant animals, so we are going to take a 
closer look at them now. Think of vari- 
ables as storage bins in the computer. 
Each bin has a label on the outside iden- 
tifying it. When you want to find out what 
is in a particular bin, you ask for infor- 
mation about its contents by referring to 
it by its label. For example, suppose you 
wrote the following lines in a program: 

10 EGGS = 12 

20 TURKEYS = 3.24 



30 JUNEBUGS = 4000 

In fact, try this right now. First, erase 
your old program by typing new (a sig- 
nal to the computer to forget everything 
because you want to start all over) . Then 
type the three lines above. Now t3rpe: 

PRINT EGGS 

Surprised? The computer will give a 
value of zero to any variable name that 
hasn't been assigned a value yet. And re- 
member, the three instructions you just 
typed were typed in the deferred execu- 
tion mode. Try typing run and then when 
the prompt comes back, tjrpe print eggs 
again. This time it should answer 12. 
Check out your turkeys and junebugs 
while you're at it. 

Now try this. T3^e print tuxedos. Sur- 
prise again ! Although you can make your 
labels almost as long as you like (up to 
238 characters, according to the latest ru- 
mors) , your lazy computer only inspects 
the first two characters ! So as far as the 
Apple is concerned, there's no difference 
between a turkey and a tuxedo. We, of 
course, know better. That's why we're 
still in charge. 

Generally, you can use all twenty-six 
letters of the alphabet and all ten nu- 
merical digits in variable names, as long 
as the name starts with a letter, not a 
digit. In other words R2D2 is a perfectly 
good variable name, 4square is not. How- 
ever, no rule is complete without its ex- 
ceptions. Try changing line 10 to read:

10 ALTOS = 12 

Now run the program. Syntax error in 
10! The Apple doesn't like altos. Type list. 
Notice how your word has been chopped 
up by the computer? 

10 AL TO S = 12 

This is the computer's way of telling 
you that your variable name contains a 
reserved word, in this case the word to. 
There is a list of reserved words in Ap- 
pendix C of the Applesoft manual. This 
won't happen to you too often, especially 
if you make your variable names unpro- 
nounceable. 

Up to now, all of the bins in your Ap- 
ple have held numbers, in a form called 
real numbers (which means that they 
can have a decimal point if you like). 
There are two other kinds of labels, used 
to identify bins that hold completely dif- 
ferent animals. 

If you add a dollar sign to the end of 
any variable name, that name is used to 
identify a string. Strings are words, 
phrases, numbers; almost anything that 
doesn't have to be evaluated mathemati- 
cally. Try the following: First type new. 
Then type this : 

10 NAMES = "JONES" 

20 INTROS = "HOW DO YOU DO, MR. " 

30 PRINT: PRINT INTRO$;NAME$ 

Type run and presto! A pretty silly 
way to type a sentence, but a good way to 



illustrate string variables, nevertheless. 
You might want to make note of the use 
of the semicolon to separate the two vari- 
ables in the print statement, too. 

The second alternate kind of label is 
an integer label. If you add a percent 
symbol to the end of a variable name, the 
computer will only keep track of the part 
to the left of the decimal point. This is 
very useful if you have a large program 
and need to save memory. It is also a 
good way to speed up the computer, 
which thinks faster in whole numbers 
than in fractions. As do I. 

Tj^e new and give this a whirl: 

10 NUMBER% = 3.14159 
20 PRINT "THE NUMBER I AM THINKING OF IS 
"NUMBER% 

Run it and watch that fraction get 
whittled down to size. 

Formatting. Print statements are 
your Apple's principal way of communi- 
cating with the world at large. There- 
fore, a number of additional formatting 
tricks and shortcuts have been provided 
to allow you to arrange the printed word 
on the screen exactly as you would like. 

Type new and then home. Incidental- 
ly, although we have been using these 
two commands in immediate execution 
mode, they can also be used within a pro- 
gram. Like this: 

10 HOME 

20 PRINT "HELLO." 



JANUARY 1982 



Type run and "HELLO." will appear 
in the upper left comer of the screen. 
Now add a new line as follows : 

15 HTAB 20 

Type run and the same word will ap- 
pear halfway across the screen. Let's 
add yet another line to our program and 
then run it again: 

16 VTAB 12 

Htab and vtab will position the cursor 
horizontally and vertically. There are 
forty columns on the screen and twenty- 
four rows, so these commands allow you 
to print anywhere you wish just by mov- 
ing the cursor right before the print state- 
ment. 

Now delete lines 15 and 16 from your 
program. You do this by typing each 
number and then pressing return (re- 
placing a program line with an empty i 
line). Add the following line: 

30 GOTO20 

Run the prog^ram. You should get a I 
long column of HELLOs scrolling by j 
along the left margin. Very nice. Retake 
control of your computer. (Remember? 
Control-C. It stands for Curb your Com- 
puter.) Now we are going to redo line 20. 

First, a little shorthand trick. Type : ' 

20 ?"HELLO."; 

Now list the program. The question ' 
mark is a quick way of writing print ^ 
(and just about the only abbreviation 
built into the Apple) . Don't ask why. 

Notice the semicolon added at the end 
of the line. This is a signal to your Apple 
telling it that you aren't finished printing 
on the current line yet. Type run and you 
will see how it works. 

When the Apple runs out of room on 
one line, it just continues on the next one 
down. If it was already on the bottom line 
on the screen, it bumps everything up one 
line to make extra room (and you can 
kiss your top line good-bye — you'll never 
see it again). This is called automatic 
scrolling. It only works one direction. 
There's no backing up in this business. 

Now let's try one final trick. Retype 
line 20, changing that semicolon to a com- 
ma. Then type run. The comma works a 
little like the tab bar on a typewriter, ex- 
cept that the tabs are permanently set at 
columns 1, 17 and 33. 

If you got a little tired of retyping line 
20 and wonder if there isn't an easier 
form of editing, be reassured. There is. 
We'll cover it next time, along with a first 
look at graphics. 

One last thing. Here's that first list- 
ing, for those whose computers simply 
failed to recognize their master's voice. 

1 x=o 

5 PRINT"NOW I'M PROGRAMMING." 

10 PRINT"I'M STILL AT ITIIII" 

20 PRINT"AND I JUST CAN'T STOP!"

Beginners' 
Corner 




BY (RAic sTinsori 

Last month's installment of this col- 
umn concluded with a summary of the 
way memory is allocated on a 48K Apple 
II or II Plus. In particular, we pointed out 
that the addresses from 0 to 2047 are re- 
served for system functions; that Basic 
programs and data get stored in the vast 
territory between 2048 and 49151, al- 
though the top 10. 5K of this space is 
usually taken up by the Disk Operating 
System; that the addresses from 8192 to 
24575 do double duty, serving either as 



free RAM for program storage or as con- 
trol areas for the Apple's hi-res graph- 
ics ; and that the addresses from 49152 to 
65535 are committed to I/O functions, the 
Basic interpreter (Applesoft or Integer, 
depending on the species of machine), 
and the system Monitor. 

Clumsy Figures Gain Grace in Trans- 
lation. Astute as you are, you may have 
noticed that with the single exception of 
address 0, these boundary points on the 
memory map are not exactly round, 
memorable numbers. As with many 
other things about the computer, how- 
ever, there is order and simplicity hiding 



behind apparent complexity. 

In the binary counting system, these 
numbers are indeed nice, round quanti- 
ties. For example, 2,048 translates to 
100,000,000,000 in binary; 49,152 is equiv- 
alent to 1,100,000,000,000,000. 

Round, you say, but not memorable. 

There's a simple way to convert these 
binary enormities into a form both round 
and digestible, and that's the hexadeci- 
mal system. You may recall that, when 
the subject of hex was introduced in this 
column a couple of months back, it was 
described as a method of simplifying the 
representation of binary numbers. Any

group of four numerals in a binary num- 
ber can be translated into a single hex 
digit, and hence all the addresses avail- 
able to the Apple fit neatly into the space 
between hex 0 and hex FFFF. If you 
wanted to brandish a little computer jar- 
gon, you could say that hex is a way of 
easing the interface between man and 
machine. 

Expressed hexadecimally, those land- 
marks on the memory map take on a 
more transparent character. The so- 
called free RAM area starts at $800 (that 
means hex 800; the dollar sign is one of 
the standard symbols indicating a hex 
number). The two hi-res graphics areas 
start at $2000 and $4000. DOS, in its de- 
fault state on the 48K Apple, takes up 
quarters at $9600, and the region of mem- 
ory that is devoted to I/O, interpreter, 
and Monitor begins at $C000. 

Beading Street and Town in Hex Ad- 
dresses. There's a reason why all these 
boundaries begin with hex addresses 
ending in 00. It's the natxire of the 6502 
that it must deal with its range of mem- 
ory addresses in units of 256 bytes. These 
units are called pages, and all the impor- 
tant functional boundaries on the Ap- 
ple's memory layout are also page boun- 
daries. 

In hex notation, two figures can ex- 
press a total of 256 different numbers, 
from zero to 255. So the last two figures in 
a four-figure hex address represent a 
particular byte within a given page of 
memory. The first two figures identify 
the number of the page. To state the gen- 
eral case, in address $XXyy, XX repre- 
sents a page number, and yy identifies a 
specific byte within page XX. 

Those first two figures can also be ar- 
ranged 256 different ways, so now you 
can see that the Apple's memory is struc- 
tured in 256 pages of 256 bytes each. 

You'll find it useful to be able to re- 
late to your Apple in hexadecimal terms. 
For one thing, much of the so-called lit- 
erature about the computer — both pro- 
gram documentation and how-to books — 
assumes an understanding of hex. But 
aside from that reason, whether or not 
you ever become an assembly-language 
programmer, you're probably going to 
want to know more about the system 
Monitor, and the Monitor speaks and un- 
derstands only hex. 

When Simplicity Won't Work. The bad 
news is that even if you thoroughly learn 
your way around the Apple's memory in 
hex, you'll probably still need to know a 
lot of big, clumsy decimal landmarks as 
well. 

There are times when it's useful 
either to inspect or to alter the contents of 
some specific byte of the Apple's mem- 
ory. You can do that by getting into the 
Monitor (by typing call -151) and then 
typing the hex number of the desired ad- 
dress (omitting the dollar sign); If you 
want to find out what value is currently 
held at some address, just type the ad- 
dress and hit return. To store some de- 



sired value at an address, type the ad- 
dress, a colon, and then the desired 
value. 

You can also accomplish these feats 
without using the Monitor, either by way 
of a program in Basic or by typing in 
some commands at the keyboard when 
you're facing the Applesoft or Integer Ba- 
sic prompt. These commands are called 
peeks and pokes. 

Should you, for example, be curious to 
know what value currently resides at ad- 
dress 2000, you could type in the words 
print peek (2000), and your Apple would 



inform you. Similarly, if you wanted to 
store some specific value at a particular 
address, say the value 25 at location 3000, 
you could type poke 3000,25, and the or- 
der would be carried out (you could ver- 
ify the results then by typing print peek 
(3000). The value that you poke must be 
within the range of 0 to 255. 

The point to note here is that the com- 
mands peek and poke only work with 
decimal numbers. Typing poke 3000,2C 
will give you a syntax error. It's unfor- 
tunate, perhaps, that Apple users have to 
contend with this Babelous state of af- 




72 



JANUARY 1982 



fairs, but peek and poke are commands 
in the Basic language, and Basic, de- 
signed to be somewhat like English, re- 
quires the use of decimal numbers (the 
commands are said to require decimal 
arguments). The Monitor, on the other 
hand, was intended to facilitate more in- 
timate conversation with the machine; 
hence it operates in hex. 

Taking It from the Top. Stranger still, 
you will sometimes see addresses ex- 
pressed in negative decimal numbers. 
Call —151 is an example of such a nega- 
tive address (call is a command in Basic 
that tells the computer to execute an in- 
struction stored at a specified address) . 
What sense are we to make of an ad- 
dress like -151? 

It's a shorthand way of writing high- 
numbered addresses; -151 is equivalent 
to 151 subtracted from 65536. In other 
words, so long as you're in Applesoft, typ- 
ing call 65385 will yield exactly the same 
results as typing call -151. If you're 
working from Integer Basic, on the other 
hand, you can't get to the Monitor with 
call 65385, because Integer will only ac- 
cept quantities between -32767 and 
+ 32767. 

By now you may be wondering about 
the practical value of all this peeking and 
pofcing, aside from its giving you some in- 
teresting ways to tinker with your ma- 
chine. There are a great many things you 



can do with direct control of memory lo- 
cations, ranging from the very simple to 
the very complex. 

For example, addresses 32 to 35 ($20 
to $23) control the dimensions of the Ap- 
ple text screen. The values stored at 
these locations determine, respectively, 
the left edge, the width, the top edge, and 
the bottom edge of your text display. Nor- 
mally, these locations hold the values 0, 
40, 0, and 24, creating a text window of 
twenty-four lines, with forty character 
positions per line. But you can change 
that, if you wish. 

A Very Useful Tip. If you've ever tried 
to list a program and then edit it with the 
escape I-J-K-M keys, you've probably ob- 
served that the way program lines break 
on the screen makes this procedure a tri- 
fle awkward; you wind up either retyp- 
ing a lot of empty spaces on the right side 
of the screen or else making more abso- 
lute cursor moves than you would like. 
Try first typing poke 33, 33 and then list- 
ing a program. 

Here's another experiment or two or 
three. Type print peek (49200) and hit re- 
turn. Or, if you're working in Integer Ba- 
sic, type print peek (-16336). Assuming 
you're in a quiet room, there's a 50 per- 
cent chance that when you do this, you'll 
hear a bip from your Apple's speaker. If 
it doesn't work the first time, then it will 
the second.

As we mentioned in last month's col- 
umn, there are a group of addresses right 
above 48K (starting at 49152) that are 
neither random access memory nor read 
only memory. In a sense they're not 
memory addresses at all, since you can't 
store any data there. These addresses 
perform functions relating to various I/O 
devices, including the eight peripheral 
slots at the back of the motherboard, the 
video display, the game port, and the Ap- 
ple's built-in speaker. 

Address 49200 ($C030) is an example 
of what's called a soft switch. Like the 
switch on a lamp, it has two positions. 
Unlike a lamp switch, however, this 
switch is not a physical device, but sim- 
ply an address; and the way you throw 
this switch is to have the computer per- 
form a software action — in this case a 
read operation. You'll also see this speak- 
er switch referred to as a toggle, which 
means that the same action that turns the 
switch on, if performed a second time, 
turns it off. That's why the speaker clicks 
every other time you peek 49200. When 
you throw the toggle into one of its two 
positions, it performs; when you throw it 
the other way, it does not. 

Speaking of Beeps. The Apple's 
speaker is a rather humble device, some- 
what like a tuning fork. The way to make 
it emit a sustained, pitched sound, in- 
stead of a barely audible click, is simply 
to throw the toggle switch a whole lot of 
times in a great hurry. Typing print peek 
(49200) again and again is not an effec- 
tive way to do this. On the other hand you 
can type in the following one-line pro- 
gram: 

10 PRINT PEEK (49200) : GOTO 10 

and then type run, and you ought to get a 
little more action out of your speaker. Re- 
member, if you're using Integer Basic, to 
make that address -16336 instead of 
49200. 

If all has gone well, your speaker 
should sound a little like an arcade game 
race car about to run out of fuel. You 
should also see a column of numbers 
streaming by on your screen. Even though 
49200 is not an ordinary memory loca- 
tion, the computer will, if you wish, print 
a value supposedly held there. The value, 
however, has nothing to do with whether 
or not the speaker clicks. It is the action 
of reading the address that throws the 
soft switch, not the contents of the mem- 
ory location. 

If you happen to have both Applesoft 
and Integer on your machine, try this 
program in both languages (you'll have 
to retype it after you switch from one lan- 
guage to the other) , and you'll get an idea 
of how much faster Integer executes. In 
Integer it still doesn't give you a continu- 
ous, pitched sound, but it does a little bet- 
ter than a pathetic putt-putt. 

Here's a way to speed things up some. 
Put a comma after the print statement, 
so that it looks like this:

errors. APPLE SPICE also greatly ex- 
pands Applesoft's capabilities by adding 
features found in many larger BASICs 
such as PRINT USING, STRING SEARCH

10 PRINT PEEK (-16336),: GOTO 10 

(we'll use the negative version of the ad- 
dress now, since it's applicable to both 
langiiages) . Note that when you run this 
new and improved version, the printed 
output shows up neatly aligned in three 
columns (five in Integer) . The comma is 
a print-formatting tool in Basic. 

The Race for Fast Music. The speak- 
er's output now should sound louder and 
more like a definite pitch. The Integer 
version, in fact, begins to sound almost 
musical. What's happening is that by re- 
lieving the Apple of the need to start a 
new line every time it executes the print 
instruction, we've enabled it to get on 
with its business a lot faster. 



Now try substituting a semicolon for 
the comma: 

10 PRINT PEEK (-16336); : GOTO 10 

The semicolon causes all the output to be 
crammed together on the screen. With 
this improvement, your speaker ought to 
start to hum a bit. The Integer version 
should sound like mosquitoes on a Min- 
nesota summer night. 

One more modification will turn hum- 
ming into singing. Take out the print 
statement altogether and try this meth- 
od of reading the speaker toggle : 

10 Y = PEEK (-16636) = GOTO 10 

You can learn a couple of things from this 



JANUARY 1982 



change. First, there's no reason why you 
need to output anything in the process of 
accessing the soft switch; simply look- 
ing at the address (peeking it) and as- 
signing the value there to a variable (Y, 
in this case) will do the trick. Second, put- 
ting things on the video screen is a rela- 
tively time-consuming procedure. By re- 
lieving your Apple of this burden, you en- 
able it to click the speaker many more 
times per second — fast enough to pro- 
duce a recognizable musical pitch. 

A couple other things can be noted 
here. In Integer Basic this program will 
produce a tone in the neighborhood of 
middle C, which is roughly equivalent to 
256 cycles per second. In Applesoft you 
get a tone approximately an octave deep- 
er, which means that the speaker is vi- 
brating about half as fast. 

The Winner — for Dogs. Now type con- 
trol-G. That familiar beep is a 1000 Hz 
(cycles per second) tone produced by a 
routine written in machine language and 
stored permanently in ROM at location 
65338. You can also get the beep by tj^- 
ing call 65338 (or call -198). 

One thousand cycles per second is sig- 
nificantly faster than what we were able 
to achieve in Ba.sic. Machine language, in 
fact, is so much faster than Basic that if 
we were to use it to write a simple rou- 
tine to hit the speaker toggle again and 
again, as we did here in Basic, we would 
have to put instructions in to distract the 
Apple, to slow it down drastically, or else 
the resulting pitch would be above the 
frequency range of human hearing. 

The reason why a program in Basic 
gets executed so much more slowly than 
one written in machine language is that 
the computer has to translate each Basic 
instruction, as it encounters it, into its 
own native tongue. That means as it's 
running our program to produce middle 
C, it has to visit the Basic interpreter 
ROMs before every toggle of the toggle 
switch, to releam how it's supposed to 
execute y = peek (-16336). It's not a very 
efficient process. 

Fortunately, the call command g^ves 
programmers the option of executing 
machine language routines (either al- 
ready stored in the Apple's Monitor or of 
their own devising) at places in their pro- 
grams where speed is critical, while writ- 
ing the other parts in Basic, which most 
people find a whole lot easier to do. For 
example, when a 1000 Hz or higher pitch 
is desired, it can be obtained by means of 
a call statement within an overall Basic 
program. 

Next month we'll take a look at some 
of the other soft switches in the Apple's

No Adventure More Challenging 
No Challenge More Realistic 
No Reality More Frightening 

If you're tired of playing juvenile games, INTERACTIVE FANTASIES (IFs) are waiting for you. • 

Each is a classic, an entertainment more sophisticated than most gamesv 
, an experience slightly more realistic than you bargained for, 

a step beyond the ordinary. . .h 
II. I "TT , m .. ; • ; Enter one, you won't want to leave; 




. mm ■ The line between adventure an'cl obsession wears thin 

when the computer you supposedly control starts playing games with you. 
THE PRISONER'S challenge is compelling. In°a surreal environment where the simplest clue becomes deception and a riddle may suddenly; 
turn a deadly edge, will you keep your wits? In a bizarre world where your captor smiles sweetly at you, will you remain an individual? In 

a prison where you may never even find the bars, can you escape?.: 



THE PRISONER, a nightmarish gaming fantasy, was written by David Mullich. Available in Applesoft, 48K, DOS 3.2 or 3.3 . . .■ $29.95 

^J^^y^^WORLD BUILDERS'"^ 

Miner Hobart accumulated several million credits during the 
years he spent working the asteroid belts and investing wisely in ■ 
gambling casinos throughout the galaxy . . . but now uranium 
poisoning is killing him. 

Zora has spread her missionary gospel from one. village to 
the next, manipulating the credulous populace with magic 
charms and rituals ... yet now she stands facing the deadly 
point of a unicorn's horn. 

Lazeras Long, stricken with cabin fever while in transit to a 
distant colony, steps out of the air-lock of his craft into the 
vacuum of space ... to meet the Lord of Light. 
■ Who are these intrepid pioneers? Citizens of the EMPIRE. 
Their lives, and the lives of countless others, are yours to 
experience in EMPIRE I: WORLD BUILDERS, where realism goes 
beyond high-resolution graphics.

Face your opponent. Consider your objectives ... and his. 
Examine your options ... and his. Make your move. You may 
be too late. Act, Now! 

TERRORIST does not skirt the issues — whether nuclear 
blackmail, a jetliner hijacking, or seizure of the World Trade 
Center. TERRORIST simulates these confrontations more 
accurately than you may have wanted. Your every move is 
tangled in bureaucratic red tape, randomness, the ambiguities of 
international politics ... and the unpredictable behavior of your 
opponent. You may choose the role of terrorist or authority. But 
choose; in TERRORIST there is no middle ground.

PUT YOUR APPLE TO WORK FOR YOU! 

WITH THE THUNDERCLOCK PLUS™ 




As an APPLE user you already know all the things your APPLE can do. Now Thunderware 
expands that list with the THUNDERCLOCK PLUS, the complete clock/calendar system 
for your APPLE! Your programs can read the month, date, day-of-week, hour, 
minute, and second in any of APPLE'S languages. On-board batteries keep 
your THUNDERCLOCK running accurately when your APPLE is off - for up 
to 4 years before battery replacement. But that's just the beginning. 

The THUNDERCLOCK PLUS is the most useful and versatile peripheral 
you can put in your APPLE. It can keep your disk files organized by 
time-and-date-stamping them, it enhances the usability of many of the 
new business/professional software packages for accounting, filing, and 
time management, and it can remotely control lights and appliances 
for security or display purposes in your business or home. 

SOFTWARE PRODUCT COMPATIBILITY 

Many of today's important software packages for data-base 
management, business applications, communications, and time management are designed to use the 
THUNDERCLOCK PLUS. If you have or plan to purchase any of these packages, a THUNDERCLOCK will greatly 
enhance their usefulness. 

•VISIDEX* (Personal Software) •DB MASTER and MICRO-MEMO (Stoneware) •MICRO-COURIER and MICRO- 
TELEGRAM (Microcom) -THE CASHIER and THE STORE MANAGER (High Technology) ©BUSINESS PLUS and 

NET-WORKS (Advanced Data Systems) ...and many others! 

THUNDERWARE'S DOS-DATER 

Our new DOS-DATER software upgrades the regular DOS on 
your disks so that DOS will use the THUNDERCLOCK to time- 
and-date-stamp disk files. Every time a program is saved or a file is 
modified, the current date and time to the minute are stored in 
the CATALOG with the file's name. You can tell ata glance when 
a program was saved or when any file was last modified. And this 
time/date stamping feature is completely automatic. That means 
any program which uses DOS will time/date stamp its files! 

REMOTE CONTROL 

Add Thunderware's X-10 INTERFACE OPTION to your 
THUNDERCLOCK PLUS and your APPLE can control lights and appliances through your BSR X-10 Home Control 
System on your pre-defined schedules. Our powerful SCHEDULER software allows you to create and modify 
schedules easily and execute them in the 'background', while using your APPLE for other tasks in the 'foreground'. 
Use your APPLE for energy management, display and security lighting, or laboratory/process control. 

Our PASCAL Software lets you use all the THUNDERCLOCK'S features in PASCAL and sets the F)iler date 
whenever you boot. 

You get all this versatility in just one peripheral system. Backed by a full one year warranty. See your APPLE dealer 
for a demonstration, or contact us for more information. We'll give your APPLE the best time around!

This is the graphics package for 
which every programmer has 
been waiting. Written by three

machine language animation 
routines that have been used to 
create some of the finest Apple 
arcade games. It also gives you the power to create 108-color screen images 
and graphic objects the way professionals do for adventure games and other 
programs that require dozens of pictures and objects to be quickly accessible 
from a minimum of space. Add to that new, "super shape tables"; a new 
approach to saving shapes that allows multiple colors, preservation of angles 
on scaling and rotation, and taking less space than standard shapes stored 
on the Apple. Extensive documentation and the same user-friendly approach 
of all Penguin Software products make the "Magician" incredibly easy to use.

imaginary, then view and modify 
them in 3-D perspective with your 
Apple computer. The 16"xl3" 
tablet comes with a customized 



version of The Complete Graphics 
System, specifically designed to 
accept input from three dimen- 
sions. In addition, the Space Tablet 
includes machine language soft- 
ware that allows you to design 
your own programs using 3-D in- 
put. This unique hardware/software 
package also comes at a very pal- 
atable price " half the cost of most

Contains everything you need for de- 
signing 2-dimensional and 3-dimen- 
sional graphics with the Apple, pre- 
viously available only on expensive 
graphics computers. Create color 
screen images with lines, circles, el- 
lipses, automatic 108-color filling, and 
"paintbrushes". Use high-resolution 
text anywhere on the screen in dozens 
of colors. Create and edit shape tables, 
and shrink pictures for multiple dis- 
plays. Amazing 3-D routines let you 
draw the parts of 3-D objects on the 
screen, then assemble, rotate, and edit 
them visually in true 3-D perspective. 
All the software is easy to use, even 
for the novice. Programmers can use 
the graphics, and even our machine 
language routines, in their own soft- 
ware. This one package gives you more 
than most other graphics software 
packages combined. Find out why The 
Complete Graphics System is top rated 
in Apple graphics. 




Development of a 3-D image using 
The Complete Graphics System. 




by Mark Pelczarski 

Like nothing else on the market, this unique software 
package allows you to escape the "coloring book" ap- 
proach to computer graphics, giving you a palette of 108 
colors and 96 different brushes for creating or enhancing 
color computer images. Also included is a magnifying 
mode that lets you magnify images 2 or 4 times and edit 
them point-byrpoint, a "picture packer" that lets you 
store images in a fraction of the space normally taken, and 
a set of tricks that allow you to reverse colors, perform 
mirror images, and move parts of screen images around 
and to other pictures. Special Effects is great as a stand- 
alone package -- or the perfect complement to 
The Complete Graphics System. 



All products require an Apple II with Applesoft, 48K, and a disk drive.

ECHO SPEECH SYNTHESIZER 

UNLIMITED VOCABULARY AT YOUR FINGERTIPS 




Give your Apple* something to talk about with an 
ECHO ][ Speech Synthesizer. The ECHO ][ offers in- 
telligible voice-output while using a minimum of RAM. 
The ECHO ][ uses LPC technology pioneered by Texas 
Instruments, coupled with a phoneme-based operating 
system allowing you to create any vocabulary desired.

questions or make exclamations while also allowing 
for optimal quality. Speech can easily be added to 
BASIC programs with PRINT statements. 

The applications of synthesized speech are limited 
only by your imagination. From educational programs 
to games to business applications, speech-output 
adds a new dimension to your Apple's capabilities. 

The ECHO ][ Speech Synthesizer comes complete with 
speaker and cable, instruction manual, speech editing 
features and a sample vocabulary. The ECHO ][

Why you need The Inspector. 



If you're serious about programming, you need 
to set all your utilities together in one place — 
inside your Apple. The hispector comes on an 
Eprom that simply plugs into the D8 socket, or on 
a disk ready to merge with Integer Basic for 
automatic loading on boot. Either way, it stays at 
your fingertips, ready to call without disturbing 
your current program. 

The Inspector puts you in total control of both 
memory and disks. You can search forward 
and backwards, edit, read nibbles, 
map disk space, dump the screen 
to a printer, examine every secret 
of your Apple. Use The Inspector 
to repair blown disks, undelete 
files, input "illegal" commands, 




read and alter files, locate strings in memory or on 
disk. The uses are endless. The manual, alone, is an 
education. And it's always when you need it. 

You need the most powerful disk and memory 
utility available for your Apple. You need the 
Inspector

1ST WE GOT RID OF 
THE LOWER CASE ADAPTER 



and put lower case on the screen 
WITHOUT HARDWARE. 



THEN WE GOT RID OF 
THE 80 COLUMN BOARD 




and put seventy columns of text on the screen^ 
WITHOUT HARDWARE. 



THEN WE GOT RID OF 
WASTED EDITING TIME 

by developing printer spooling 
AGAIN WITHOUT HARDWARE! 



AND WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR 
NEW WAYS TO SAVE YOU TIME AND MONEY. 





When ON-LINE SYSTEMS began work on SUPERSCRIBE II. we wanted to make it the 
most powerful word processor on the market. We began by putting in boldfacing, 
underlining, form letter capabilities, global search and replace, support of multiple disk 
drives, full macro capabilities, generation of up to four indices, complete formatting 
capabilities, a software based keyboard buffer, full editing capability of any DOS 3.3 text ^^^^ 
or binary file (including APPLESOFT programs) and all other features you need for professional word processing. That was just the 
beginning. ... 

Our next step was to make SUPERSCRIBE II hardware independent, so we eliminated the lower case adapter and the 80 column 
board. SUPERSCRIBE II is the only word processor on the market to offer true software based lower case and a 70 column screen 
available today. 

The move that put us over the top was the introduction of printer spooling* which allows you to do your editing while printing, 
making your word processing time more efficient. 

With SUPERSCRIBE II, we've added all the features you need, did away with all the problems you can do without, and we did it all at 
a price that you can afford-$l29.95. 

•Printer spooling feature only available for printers with APPLE parallel or SSM AlO interface, and EPSON printers/APPLE II and APPLE II Plus are registered trade 
marks of APPLE COMPUTER INC. 

We Don't Think That Word Processing Should Cost An Arm And A Leg,

A recent article in "INTERFACE AGE" tested 45 of the most 
used BASICs on 48 different microcomputers. That article 
judged that if you are an APPLE owner writing programs in 
APPLESOFT, you have the nineteenth fastest BASIC/com- 
puter combination tested.* 

-THAT WAS BEFORE EXPEDITER II.- 

If you're an APPLE owner with EXPEDITER U writing 
programs in APPLESOFT, you can now have your BASIC 
program judged second in the same comparison - with a 
minimum of effort. You need only LOAD your program, BRUN 
EXPEDITER, then save your program. 

EXPEDITER II is a new programming utility which translates 
your APPLESOFT programs into machine language, usually on 
the first try. Problem spots in the code are flagged during 
compilation. The new compiled code supports all the features of 
APPLESOFT including HI-RES graphics, shape tables, LO- 
RES graphics, defined functions and DOS commands. 
EXPEDITER II is the only compiler to support global string 
variables easily. There is no additional BASIC syntax to learn. 
The only real difference you'll notice with the new program is 
that it's faster - usually two to twenty times faster. 

Other APPLESOFT compilers are available for the 
APPLE, but none have all the features of EXPEDITER II. 
EXPEDITER II, with its new MEMORY COMPRESSION 
OPTION can reduce your compiled program size by up to 50 
percent. (Remember: a machine language program is normally 
bigger than a BASIC program that does the same thing). It's also 
compatible with MMS II** to help you solve any memory 
problems you might encounter. 



The race has just begun 

We make your compilation process easier by providing a 
symbol table and address listings for each line of your BASIC 
program. EXPEDITER II even allows you to reserve areas for 
machine language subprograms or graphics. Debugging is 
facilitated by EXPEDITER lis support of the Applesoft TRACE 
command. 

We at ON-LINE SYSTEMS believe that the APPLE II is a 
powerful machine, and we're constantly trying to make it better 
and easier to use. Thats why we offer a full line of utilities written 
by some of the best programmers in the field. The only limits we 
feel the APPLE should have, are the limits to your imagination. 

*Write for more information on the INTERFACE AGE article.

System on your memory expansion board. Available for $49.95.

Crossfire. By Jay Sullivan. Here is a game, totally new and 
Just for the Apple, that will make the arcaders green with 
envy. Crossfire is the best home-arcade game to cross our 
screens since Alien Rain — well, since Raster Blaster — well, 
since Bezman. . . . The point is. Crossfire is great. 

Chances are, you'll feel lucky to score a simple hundred the 
first few times you take on the invading aliens. Crossfire con- 
sists of a grid such as you might see on the street map of a city, 
which is precisely what this represents. All your allies have 
turned tail; you alone remain to defend the city from aliens, of 
which there are many. The aliens come at you from three di- 
rections — later four — relentlessly. They fire in the direction 
they move — if you're nearby. 

These are not the aliens of Super Invader or even of Alien 
Rain. These aliens are intelligent. They know just where you 
are and they go after you. They even seem to anticipate some 
of your moves. While this makes them a formidable foe, it also 
renders them subject to being outwitted. Try it. 

You can move in any direction through the city streets, in- 
cluding back where you just came from. You can shoot in any 
direction as well, whether you are headed that way or not. You 
must shoot and move swiftly to evade the crossfire of the 
aliens. They often manage to get off a shot just as you get 
them; they explode, but their shot continues. Each alien has

four stages of metamorphosis ; when you do in one, the next ap- 
pears at the point of origin for that particular creature. 

Four lights surround the center of the map; they become 
consecutively available to you to run over, which renders the 
most points. But you must plan your strategy to reach them. In 
addition, your ammunition is limited. New sources of ammu- 
nition appear when you are ten bullets from empty; where 
they appear depends on where you aren't. You must maneu- 
ver among the aliens' fire to reload. 

Although a home-arcade game without doubt. Crossfire of- 
fers much opportunity for strategy — far more than normal in a 
shoot-'em-up. Because of this, and because of the intense con- 
centration required to watch and respond to the entire screen 
at once. Crossfire looks to be a winner for all gamers. 

Programmed in colorful hi-res graphics. Crossfire shows 
advanced smoothness in motion as well as an excellent, fast 
capacity for monitoring many individual pieces apparently si- 
multaneously. With Crossfire and the recent Threshold, On- 
Line moves firmly into the same league as Sirius, Broder- 
bund, Cavalier, and the like as a purveyor of outstanding 
home-arcade fun. Crossfire is a must for the holiday fun of ev- 
ery game-playing household. flCT

Rubik's Cube Unlocked. By Jeff Grold. Although you can use 
this program as a substitute for the famous cube, that's not its 
main purpose. Rubik's Cube Unlocked is designed for those 
who have the real McCoy and have begxin, out of total frustra- 
tion, to feel like Hatfields. 

Unlocked prompts you to enter the colors on the monitor 
cube precisely as they appear on your cantankerous one. Then 
the computer directs you, step-by-step, to its solution. As you 
go, the moves are displayed in hi-res color (or, optionally, text) 
on a three-dimensional representation and on six separate rep- 
resentations of the six sides. To be still more graphic, the side 
to be changed appears again separately above another look at 
it after the proposed change. 

In another option, the program will generate a random 
cube — actually by messing up the cube you've given it in your 
choice of a given number of moves. In still other options, the 
program arranges the cube in several patterns other than the 
solid sided standard win. 

The most outstanding feature of Rubik's Cube Unlocked is 
its speed. There is no delay, even at the beginning, before it 
solves the problem. The hi-res, too, is fine, with a nice graph- 
ics character set. The colors, unfortunately, could be better; a 
disclaimer apologizes for some running into others by claim- 
ing impossibility. Some other alternative needs to be found 
then. The bleeding colors are still clear enough to read, so this 
is not a reason to forego this program. 

If you've been tearing your hair out over the cube, Rubik's 
Cube Unlocked could prevent baldness. Don't overlook it. n(T

Although it's designed primarily as a learning supplement 
for students working at the second to tenth grade levels who 
have some prior knowledge of geometric and measurement 
concepts, this package can be used to advantage by nearly 
anyone who would like to become more comfortable and pro- 
ficient in matters of measurement and geometry. 

Included in the package are two master disks, two back- 
ups, and a documentation booklet. Each master disk contains 
four master programs that are accessible from a main menu. 
The first set of programs drills the user on classifying poly- 
gons, measuring the length of line segments (or caterpillars) 
in metric terms, measuring perimeter and area (easy ver- 
sion), and telling time; the second set covers circles, angle 
measurement, perimeter/area measurement (advanced ver- 
sion) , and volume/area measurement. 

Each master program also has subprograms within it, re- 
sulting in a total of thirty categories for students to choose 
from. The various subprograms are arranged in order from 
simplest to most advanced, and users can choose how many 
exercises of a particular type they would like to do. Minimum 
and maximum numbers of exercises (ordinarily one to ten) 
are usually indicated, although in the case of the drill on angle 
measurement a maximum number wasn't indicated, and we 
discovered we could ask for a series of up to ninety-nine ran- 
dom problems. 

In all exercises, except the clock drill for which thirty sec- 
onds is the time limit, a user can take as long as desired to an- 
swer a question. Three tries are allowed before the correct an- 
swer is revealed, and the scoring feedback that's given when a 
series of problems has been completed tells the student how 
many questions were answered correctly on the first, second, 
and third tries, and how many questions (if any) were not an- 
swered correctly. The learner can then decide to run the sub- 



program again for additional practice, return to the main 
menu to choose another variety of problem, or quit. 

The documentation booklet is intended as a guide for teach- 
ers and parents but will also interest older students who are 
curious about what's in store as they move through the vari- 
ous programs. Included in the manual are summary over- 
views of the eight master programs, illustrations of sample 
screens for each of the master programs, and a sample pro- 
gram run-through. Program summaries also indicate the 
grade level range for which a particular program is geared. 

One of the appendices to the documentation contains short 
definitions of all the important terms used in the various pro- 
grams. These will help parents, teachers, and students re- 
fresh their memories about the meanings of various terms (it's 
not easy to remember off the top of your head precisely what 
an isosceles triangle is or how many sides a heptagon has). 
These miniature glossaries also provide raw material for 
matching or fill-in quizzes on definitions. 

The program itself is a delight to use and earns an A for 
user-friendliness. Its organization is straightforward and logi- 
cal, and its screen prompts are clear and supportive of the 
learner's efforts. Learners will enjoy being able to work inde- 
pendently at their own pace. This well conceived, well ex- 
ecuted program is an example of CAI at its best. )EV

catching some of the constant stream of beer cans falling from 
above or acquiring kegs of beer that pop up frequently. 

Climbing ladders and riding elevators Is difficult as it is, 
particularly after you've had a few beers, but there are also 
guzzlers and bouncers, out to send you to the bottom of the 
building. At first it seems impossible to maneuver past the 
drunken guzzlers and busybody bouncers. There is no way to 
make them go away, and they seek you out with the intention 
of ruining your day. When you climb a ladder you can only go 
down after you reach the top of that ladder. And when you go 
down you can only go down one level. 

This makes it all very frustrating at first. Frequently you'll 
find yourself stuck on a ledge with nowhere to go and the guz- 
zlers marching stupidly towards you. Needless to say, all this 
frustration makes you play harder and develop strategies for 
using the elevators, which are the only things that get you any- 
where in this game. Patience is the key to success here, as the 
elevators go up and down. 

The Sirius building is thirty floors high, and if you make it to 
the top an erratically flying blimp lowers a rope. Catching the 
rope on the first try gets you extra beers, but once you've 
caught it the real action begins. Deposited on the top of the 
Olympia Beer building you find yourself in the same kind of sit- 
uation as before, except now you go down. One nice thing Is if 
you get killed in the Olympia building you don't get sent back 
to the Sirius building. 

Mark Turmell's graphics are humorous, but one could 
imagine the main character looking less like a blind man walk- 
ing on a treacherous ledge. The sound effects are obnoxious, 
but if you hit control-S it seems like something is missing. 

A good party game. Beer Run's real mystery is the Ar- 
tesians. Tantalizing messages appear on screen during play, 
announcing their arrival in the building, but if you find any it 
probably means you drank too many beers and are imagining 
things. Artesians or no Artesians, a game where you try to 



amass a year's supply of beer is a noble concept. Even if it's 
imaginary beer. DU

Volcanoes. By Gordon Goles. Adventurers who are tired of bat- 
tling dragons and wizards might want to try their keyboards at 
volcanoes instead. Volcanic eruption is no less dangerous than 
the average dragon or wizard (remember Vesuvius £uid Krak- 
atoa) , and this new game allows the veteran adventure play- 
er to tax his powers of strategy, foresight, and reasoning. Vol- 
canoes automatically throws two or more players into the role 
of expert volcanologlsts. The object of the game is to predict 
via a series of investigations which volcanoes in the mythical 
land of Wrangalia are going to erupt, so the inhabitants of the 
neighboring villages can be properly warned and evacuated. 

The game is self -prompting; you never even have to read 
the manual to play. And that's almost too bad. The author is a 
professional volcanologist, and the documentation manages to 
be extremely educational and extremely interesting at the 
same time. The documentation "blue book" was also written 
to enhance the player's enjoyment of the game with facts 
every amateur volcanologist should know from history to a 
working glossary. 

The investigations the player must undertake to make his 
predictions are those performed on true volcanoes to deter- 
mine hazards and impending activity, including infrared scan 
to find "hot spots"; seismic survey to look for volcanic trem- 
ors; electrical conductivity to detect zones that may Indicate 
the existence of shallow magma chambers ; and tiltmeter sur- 
vey to find patterns of short-term swelling or deflation. In ad- 
dition, detailed background is provided in the documentation 
to explain the logic of the investigation — why shallow magma 
chambers are so significant. The methods are also clearly out- 
lined.

tion available, it should be easy to prevent a future Pompeii, 
right? Wrong. In this game each player-scientist starts out 
with a given amount of money (about $352,000) to spend as he 
or she likes on tiltmeters and gas analyses. Goles's costs close- 
ly parallel the actual costs of such investigations — gas analy- 
ses are about $60,000 cheaper than taking a seismic survey. In 
this game, the scientists don't have extra money to bum, so 
scientific inquiry must be made wisely. 

Which brings up another point in this game. Goles inten- 
tionally programmed the game to teach cooperation as well as 
geology. The volcanoes seem to be winning when the players 
don't cooperate as a scientific team. 

Another feature is the "electronic mailbox" to provide a lit- 
tle bit of chance to keep the game interesting. But Goles says 
this feature only comes into play if your credibility should 
either become very high owing to your expert predictions or 
too low owing to your poor predictions. There's also three lev- 
els to keep the game hot. And as many as four players can par- 
ticipate in making the correct predictions or destroying the 
town. A feature also allows players to exit the game after an 
eruption and save it until everjkhing cools off. 

Goles seems to have left no stone unturned with this some- 
what slow-paced but volatile game. And anyone who plays it 
will leave the game knowing that a volcanologist is no relation 
to Mr. Spock. Hn

Snack Attack. By Dan Illowsky. Newcomer Dan Illowsky hit 
the Apple market with two big Christmas entries. Thief (Mar- 
ketalk Reviews, 1981) and Snack Attack. 

Snack Attack is an eat-the-dots game done in a Persian 
graphic style unique to Apple gaming. 

Illowsky has packed the game with features not found in 
other games of the genre. Best of them is the provision that 
each time the program is booted, it will specify different com- 
mand keys, which spreads the load through the keyboard and 
keeps any particular set of keys from wearing out faster than 
others. 

The game features three distinct mazes, each of which re- 
quires different tactics to clear the dots. If you're successful in 
clearing more than three screens, the rotation starts anew. 

The characters move faster on each succeeding screen. For 
those who get to maze nine or higher, you'll find the speed al- 
most uncontrollable — a true challenge to the dedicated arcade 
gamer. 

A thoughtful last-minute addition was the ability of the 
player to start the game at any of five different speed levels. 
This is a good option because the first couple of mazes other- 
wise go so slowly they could lull you to sleep. But when the 
speed picks up, it takes an alert and skillful player to succeed. 
On the other hand, those folks who have never shown an apti- 
tude for arcade games may find the slower beginning speeds 
just the ticket. ART

The Telematic Society. By James Martin. The effort to make 
science and technology palatable to the ordinary person has 
given rise to such celebrities as Isaac Asimov and Carl Sagan. 
Both attempt to excite the imagination and inform the intel- 
lect without overwhelming the individual with the intricacies 
and complexities of mathematics and scientific language. A 
fixture at IBM for nineteen years, James Martin is another 
professional who has taken on the task of educating the public 
about the world we live in and the world we voill live in through 
the end of the century and beyond. 

Written in clear, precise language, Martin's latest book. 
The Telematic Society, strives hard to set guidelines for the 
telecommunications revolution that Martin sees as inevitable. 
His vision is of a world bound by satellites, coaxial cables, and 
glass fibers. The technology we already have and the innova- 
tions sure to come before the end of the century will present a 
profound challenge to the human race. Telecommunications 
technology has the power to improve all of our Uves, but it also

has the power to muck things up with a vengeance. 

One of the better discussions of this dual nature of the tele- 
communications revolution occurs in the chapter "Public Re- 
sponse Systems." Theory has it that by the end of the decade 
many more features will be available for your television or 
home computer. Through interactive systems it will be possi- 
ble to make your opinion known in a much faster and presum- 
ably more accurate fashion. Advertisements, political speech- 
es, even entertainment programs will be judged by the elec- 
tronic response received from individual users. 

The advantages here are obvious : no longer will the chan- 
nels of communication be from the top down or from the in- 
side out. One of the greatest frustrations of the modem age — 
not having a say in the policies of the government and the 
shape of the society — may change. It would most certainly 
change, but whether this would be for the good of all or not is a 
question for serious debate. Martin is quick to point out that 
manipulation and propagandizing may reach new heights 
when people have more direct means of communicating their 
views. Careful judgment may be eschewed for emotional 
whimsy as people find it easier to make their opinions known 
but still lack a clear knowledge of the realities involved. 

Martin's solution to this problem is an old one — education. 
Television and microcomputers are great things, but only if 
they at least partially reach their potential for educating the 
masses. It is unthinkable that mass media in this country will 
evolve into the kind of dead end found in iron curtain coun- 
tries, where there are only one or two television stations and no 
entertainment programming. On the other hand, there are un- 
told improvements that could make television a more serious 
and worthwhile medium in this country. 

The bulk of Martin's book is a step-by-step examination of 
the possibilities the future holds with the coming invasion of 
telecommunications. It is eminently readable and worth the ef- 
fort. It is entertaining and frightening — a science fiction look at 
the future that is prophetic and insightful. Martin tries hard to

Hadron. By Larry Miller. The author of Epoch has expanded 
his universe to allow adversaries to travel in any direction and, 
in some cases, to swoop and swerve and dodge out of sight. The 
craft that populate this universe are more complex than those 
in Epoch ; more are animated and detailed. One bit of space 
debris houses people, and Hadron itself, a sort of giant robot 
that stalks through space, speaks its name when it passes you. 

The greatest improvement of Epoch is the means of refuel- 
ing. Instead of wandering randomly in hope of coming upon a 
swarm of bases as in Epoch, you need only find a warrior ship 
hightailing it away from you. That ship's on its way to the en- 
emy base to refuel. If you follow it successfully and manage to 
shoot the base, your supplies are replenished. Skill will bring 
you what you need — not arbitrary chance. It isn't an improve- 
ment that there are no friendly bases — no friendly element of 
any kind . . . That's a bit devastating if you think about it. 

Gone also is the 2001-type fanfare to which Epoch treats 
you upon refueling, and totally missing are the musical, mys- 
tical, wonderful time warps. Added, besides the good things, 
are huge block meteors and explosion debris the size and 
opacity of which break the mood of the game too often. 

Still, Hadron is fun to play and beautiful to watch even 
though it lacks the sense of serene, vast beauty Epoch could 
haunt you with. 

If Epoch wasn't enough for you, you may love Hadron. If 
you loved Epoch, once you accept the differences, you'll prob- 
ably enjoy Hadron a lot. n(T

□ Space Adventure, by Alick Dziabczenko, Sierra Software (536 
East Sahara Avenue, Las Vegas, NV). Arriving just at Sof- 
talk's press deadline, Space Adventure, subtitled A Real-Time 
Space Flight Simulator, seemed an important enough game 
that it ought to be reported despite there not being sufficient 
time for a full review. 

Dziabczenko (pronounced simply Zeb-chen'-ko) has al- 
most said it all in the title, but you must read and believe ev- 
ery word. This is an adventure, of the kind that calls for talk- 
ing to the computer, giving commands about what you want to 
do ; it takes place in space and is relevant to space ; it requires 
you to pilot a space ship through the three dimensions of space 
in an extremely realistic fashion, and all must be done as time 
and energy run down — the computer game form of real time. 

What the author hasn't said is that it's all done in three-di- 
mensional animated color graphics. And that the computer 
you talk to isn't your own Apple but the computer onboard the 
space ship. He leaves out also the option you have throughout 
the game to fly by the skin of your pants or to use the auto pilot 
and auto track to do all your mathematics and implement 
them. And the title doesn't expound on the three memories you 
have to save message clues in and another three for saving lo- 
cation clues. 

Finally, Dziabczenko, a physicist when not programming, 
is too modest to mention the achievements he has made in vis- 
ual terms. The view from the space ship helm, moving through 
the stars, has great depth and real three-dimensionality, en- 
hanced when you move into a turn — in any direction. You can 
even orbit a planet — a remarkable visual effect. 



JANUARY 1982 S O P T A L K 101 



As an impression, there's a potential drawback to the pro- 
gram. No matter how you cut it, the universe is a big, big place 
and flying about in it is going to take time. Even at 256 light 
years a second, the speed at which you hyperwarp, it can take 
five real minutes to go from one sector to another. On the good 
side, a lot can happen within a sector; and, even flying through 
a quiet sector, you can keep busy by experimenting with your 
onboard computer's vocabulary. Incidentally, there's a voca- 
bulary card that presumably lists all the words the computer 
knows — but don't count on it. If you want to say things that 
aren't on the card, give them a try — some of them will be un- 
derstood. 

This is, in the end, an adventure; and, in the beginning, it 
has its own equivalent of the Wizard and the Princess snake. 
But Dziabczenko is a thoughtful man and notes in the docu- 
mentation how to reach him with questions. 

As games go these days, the price of this game is quite low 
for its value. $29.95. 

□ Menu Generator, by Bob Crane, Crane Software (16835 Al- 
gonquin, Suite 611, Huntington Beach, CA). Those of you who 
may think that Menu Generator must be a kitchen aid should 
be disabused of that notion immediately. Instead, Menu Gen- 
reator is a highly professional code generation program that 
speciaUzes in the making of computer menus. 

Perhaps the finest documentation ever to accompany a 
company's first product and a series of menu-driven prompts 
will lead the user through constructing menus for his disk col- 
lection. 

For those of us who have so many small programs 
crammed onto a disk that we have to read three screens to see 
what's in the catalog. Menu Generator is a godsend. It serves 
the ancillary purpose of being a dynamite organizational tool 
for any disk collection. $39.95. 

□ Time Zone. By Roberta Williams and Ken Williams, On-Line 
Systems (36575 Mudge Ranch Road, Coarsegold, CA). Both 



sides of eight disks are what you need to play Time Zone, and 
they're all included in the package. 

When Roberta Williams conceived of creating the ultimate 
adventure, she wasn't kidding. Time Zone covers at least ten 
periods in the history — past and future — of this and (in the fu- 
ture) other worlds, and it takes you to each of the earth's con- 
tinents in all but the earliest and most futuristic eras. (Austra- 
lia wasn't a whole lot different from Europe in 50 million B.C., 
for instance, so there's only one segment in that time period). 

At the time of this writing, all of Time Zone was pro- 
grammed, but only about two-fifths were ready for a prere- 
lease outsider testing. So this impression is of only the execu- 
tion of the general idea, the earth, and each of the time periods 
in some of the continents. The most general impression is — we 
can't wait for the rest. 

If you're a fan of On-Line adventures, you have a feast in 
store. Although final touches were still being thought of and 
implemented, this prerelease peek showed Roberta Williams 
to be at her best. Puzzles are fun but not impossible — although 
there's one to equal the snake in Wisard — and many are bajsed 
on historical information. The author went out of her way to in- 
clude interesting facts and authentic custom touches about 
each of the continents and eras, some in words, some in the 
general pictures, some required for the puzzles. If you don't al- 
ready know what the Australian aborigines use rhea eggs for, 
you'll learn (or lose!). 

The idea that you'll run into famous people is accurate, al- 
though, in some cases, that's all you do — run into them. In 
most, however, you get to interact in some way with them. In 
at least one case, you have the opportunity — and the chal- 
lenge — to change history by your actions; can you do it? 

Overall, this taste of Time Zone served as an appetizer. If 
the other three-fifths comes up to these, the game is all It's said 
to be. According to On-Line, it doesn't; it's much better. We 
look forward to finding out. $99. Hi

Mind Your x 

- ^*«-*/ 





BY PETER OLIVIERI 




A very Happy New Yeair to all of you. I hope you were able 
to usher in 1982 in some suitable and memorable fashion. Be- 
fore getting down to business, I'd like to suggest some New 
Year's Resolutions for Others. (This is much easier to do when 
the suggestions are for someone else!) 

Be it resolved that any vuser's guide developed for a busi- 
ness application program or package shall be (a) proofread, 
(b) visually attractive, and (c) readable. 

Be it resolved that if a program diskette is to be elaborate- 
ly copy-protected, then a backup copy shall be supplied to the 
user along with the original. 

Be it resolved that if a description is given to the user of 
what a particular program or package will display, actual 
samples of the screen listings, input forms, or output docu- 
ments shall be provided in the user's guide. 

Be it resolved that the proliferation of software in all sizes, 
shapes, and applications shall begin to settle down to more 
manageable proportions. 

Be it resolved that costs of microcomputer peripherals 
shall decrease by a constant amount during each month of 
1982. 

Be it resolved that users of Apples in business environ- 
ments shall share their talents, experiences, and resources 
with others. 

With respect to this last suggestion, I'd like to launch a few 
new ventures this year. I would like to use this column as a ve- 
hicle to organize a business users group. Members might 
range from those of you who are currently using your Apple in 
your business to those who are just contemplating its use. The 
column would provide a centralized forum for members to 
share their experiences — describing the problems they faced 
in selecting software, developing their first application, choos- 
ing a printer, or acquiring a word processing package. The 
sharing of experiences, and of how particular problems were 
resolved, might mean that those who are Just now venturing in- 
to the Apple applications arena will be spared similar 
problems. 

Business User Profile. I'd also like occasionally to profile 
some of you who have successfully applied the Apple to a par- 
ticular business. Please let me hear from you. Drop me a note 
in care of Softalk and I'll get in touch with you either by phone 
or in person. Of course, if you know of someone who is vusing 
the Apple in a small business, please let me know about them. 
These profiles can be a vehicle for sharing with others the 
steps necessary to take full advantage of the microcomputer. 
Who knows — your profile may just be the one to turn someone 
on to greater things. 

Sources and Resources. Finally, I'd like to introduce a sec- 
tion of the column that will focus on the resources available to 
the business user who wants further information about a par- 
ticular topic. These resources would include textbooks, ref- 
erence books, management references, articles, computer 
books, catalogs, and so on. Since much material is published in 
these fields, it would be helpful to have a Ust of the best on a va- 
riety of topics. I have my own personal list. Please share some 
of your favorites. 

Well, enough of things to come. It's time now to finish re- 
viewing the accounting packages we started looking at a few 
Issues back. After examining some of the details of each, we'll 
offer some comments that may help you identify the "best of 
the bunch" for your particular needs. 

The Accountant Finance Data Base System. The Accoun- 



tant, by Decision Support Software (McLean, VA) , is a system 
for either home or office. It's more than a checkbook bal- 
ancer. In fact, it's one of the nicest home packages I've seen. It 
would be a mistake, however, to exclude it from the small busi- 
ness setting since it has been designed for either environment. 

The system requires an Apple II or II Plus with 48K, Apple- 
soft in ROM, single or dual drives, and DOS 3.3. A printer is, of 
course, of significant benefit in any business application. 

The package provides the following features : double-entry 
bookkeeping, a user dialog^ue that does not presume a back- 
ground in accounting, relatively fast retrieval of information, a 
memory management feature, a built-in calculator, output re- 
ports designed for both screen and printer, an interface with 
VisiCalc, and very complete documentation. 

One of the nice features of this package is its user guide. It 
is well written and easy to follow. AlLterms that might be new 
to the user are clearly defined prior to their use. An actual ap- 
plication is provided on diskette with the master programs and 
the first portion of the manual gfuldes you through it. This dem- 
onstration section explains clearly each of the major features 
of the program. Not only can the user reference actual data 
and observe screen formats and reports, sample reports and 
forms are included in the guide itself. 

The system allows the user to do double-entry bookkeep- 
ing. Entries can be made easily and retrieval of stored data is

unusually fast. You may specify up to sixty-three accounts and 
sixty-three codes. The Accountant stores each of the detailed 
transactions in its data base. This detail includes the date, a de- 
scription, two accounts, an amount, and an optional code. You 
can examine the current balances in each account and print 
out monthly summaries or profit and loss statements when- 
ever you require them. In addition, maintaining the data base 
is a relatively simple process. Changes can be entered rather 
easily, and all appropriate monthly balances are automatical- 
ly updated. 

A few special features of this package deserve mention. 

1. The user can code a set of automatic transactions in a 
separate file that can be posted automatically at the user's re- 
quest. Thus, if you have certain categories that remain the 
same from month to month, you do not have to enter the same 
data over and over again. 

2. Each transaction can be assigned a code of your choice 
that will allow you to summarize all data with a particular 
code. This feature can come in handy around income tax time. 

3. Special data compression methods are used to conserve 
space on diskettes. This means the user can store up to four 
thousand transactions on a single diskette. 

4. The user guide contains a tutorial that is nicely done. 
With it, the user can learn all of the standard and special fea- 
tures of the package by actually selecting options and manipu- 
lating data in a data base provided on one of the diskettes. As 
an extra aid, screen formats or tables are printed in the man- 
ual itself. 

5. The Accountant package interfaces with VisiCalc. You 
can specify what data you wish to have transferred into a for- 
mat that you can use with VisiCalc, and then you can load the 
data onto a clear VisiCalc screen or onto a previously pre- 
pared template (such as a tax form) . Of course, once there, all 
of the features of VisiCalc are now at yoior disposal. 

Finally, the package allows you to make as many copies of 
the diskettes as you need. To prevent inappropriate distribu- 
tion of the software, a key is supplied that must be inserted into 
the game port in order for the programs to work. This is easy 
to do and should present no problem at all to the user. 

The quality of the documentation and the user friendliness 
of the programs impressed me, as did the care that was taken 
in program design. The programs certainly have applicability 
both in the home and in some small business settings (though 
The Accountant is not as complete a small business package as 
either the Controller or the Westware packages). The Accoun- 
tant does, indeed, make financial management a simple and 
straightforward procedure. 

Business Series. The Business Series by Spectrum Soft- 
ware (Sunnyvale, CA) is a set of three separate programs de- 
signed to serve the needs of the small business user. The pro- 
grams can be purchased together as a complete package or as 
individual modules. The three modules are the Universal Busi- 
ness Machine, the Microaccountant, and the Business Check 
Register and Budget. 

The Universal Business Machine comes with eight stand- 
ard financial planning and analysis models. Included are mod- 
els to handle inventory, real estate investment, pro forma P & 
L statements, pro forma balance sheets, sources and uses of 
funds, sales and profit forecasting, and a job cost estimator. 
Part of this package includes a Spectrum product called the 
Universal Computing Machine. This general-purpose pro- 
gram allows the user to label rows and columns in a table, 
manipulate elements in the table, obtain totals for the rows and 
columns of the table, and ask a variety of what if questions by 
changing some of the table entries and observing the results. 

The Microaccountant provides the user with a double-en- 
try ledger system. You can maintain a transaction Journal and 
a general ledger. The system can accommodate up to one 
thousand transactions per month and up to three hundred ledg- 
er accounts. A report generator produces journal listings, bal- 
ances and transaction information for individual accounts, a 
balance sheet, and a net income statement. 

The Business Check Register and Budget is most appro-

priate in situations that primarily involve cash transactions. 
The program can handle up to four hundred checks per month 
and up to sixty check accounts. 

In order to use these programs, you must have an Apple II 
or Apple n Plus, Applesoft in ROM, 32K or 48K RAM, DOS 3.2 
or DOS 3.3, and a printer. 

The Universal Business Machine is really a computerized 
worksheet. It's reminiscent of VisiCalc in that it allows you to 
manipulate data that is in table form. Of the three modules, 
this one is the most useful. The generalness of its design al- 
lows you to adapt the package to your own particular needs. 

The documentation (user's guide) was disappointing, how- 
ever. It could have been more thorough and could have illus- 
trated various applications in more detail. In some of the 
manuals, the sample listings were too light to be readable. 
While this may be the result of a faulty copying machine, it 
certainly affects the perception of the user concerning the 
quality of the product. 

Software Technology for Computers. Software Technology 
for Computers (Belmont, MA) has prepared a variety of pro- 
grams for the general market. Their offerings include an ac- 
counts payable package, an advanced payroll package, a data 
base management system (to be reviewed in a forthcoming 
column), a professional time and billing package, an inven- 
tory control program, a graphics coloring board program, and 
a variety of other programs. 

We will look now at their accounts payable package (and in 
the future at their data base system and their graphics pack- 
age). 

To use the accounts payable package you must have two 
disk drives, an Apple II or Apple II Plus, 48K, DOS 3.3, and for 
best results a 132-column printer. 

The software offers the following features: creation of a 
chart of accounts (up to sixty may be created), preparation of 
invoices, creation of vendor files (up to one hundred twenty 
vendors) , and printing a variety of reports. Reports include in- 
formation on open invoices, year-to-date or current month 



cash disbursements, actual checks, cash requirements, and a 
complete check register. The transaction file will hold up to 725 
transactions. 

The user's gtilde is easy to read and includes all of the in- 
formation necessary to make you thoroughly familiar with the 
system. The guide carefully describes the steps involved in ini- 
tializing diskettes, backing up data, recovering from errors, 
and nmning the appropriate programs. Software Technology 
for Computers has effectively prepared a guide that will be 
useful both to the novice and to the more experienced user. The 
programs are user friendly and all options easily accessed via 
a menu. The attention to detail in both the user's guide and the 
operation of the programs speaks well for the accounts pay- 
able package. 

Summary. Because of the diversity encountered among 
these packages, it's difficult to prepare a comparison table 
similar to the one that was done for data base management 
systems. However, it's important to provide some bajsis for 
comparison. 

Given the available information, the following observationB 
can be made. If you're seeking a "complete" system, the can- 
didates would be the Controller, the Westware Package, or a 
set of Software Technology for Computers packages. By com- 
plete, we mean a thorough package that allows the user to han- 
dle accounts payable, accounts receivable, general ledgers, 
as well as a variety of special journals, listings, and reports. 
The Controller is the most complete of all of those we evalu- 
ated. It's a quality product with excellent and complete docu- 
mentation. It certainly should be considered by anyone inter- 
ested in computerizing the accounting and financial aspects of 
a small business. Of course, it is not without its drawbacks; a 
lot of disk swapping is often necessary, and learning the sys- 
tem takes a good deal of time. 

If you'd rather start slow and develop your applications in 
modules, the Software Technology products may suit your 
needs best. 

In either case, as a small business user, you should be

The Readers Speak. "Sometimes I am interested in buying 
a program or piece of software but cannot find any reviews of 
it. The package may be a game or specialized progfrani that 
just didn't make the published scene as yet. How can I find out 
about a package before I pay for it? Are there questions I can 
ask or places I can go for information?" G.F., New York. 

Evaluating software without actually running the pro- 
grams yourself is very difficult. Reviews are considered an im- 
portant part of most computer publications precisely because 
potential users do not often get to use a package before they 
buy it; the review provides a real service to them. Unfortu- 
nately, not every program gets reviewed and, sometimes, a 
publication is reluctant to say anything really bad about a 
product. When considering the purchase of software pack- 
ages that cost $2,000 to $10,000, users in the minicomputer or 
medium-size computer market are highly motivated to be ag- 
gressive and demand a demonstration and/or an opportunity 
to speak with other users. With microcomputer packages that 



sell for $29.95 or perhaps even $200, it seems that many con- 
sumers are less aggressive than they might be. 

Your first step should be to try to speak with someone who 
has actually used the product, perhaps one of the dealers in 
your local area. If you cannot find reviews of the product or lo- 
cal dealers who are familiar with it, then you might consider 
visiting a library. A library associated with a college or vini- 
versity with a computer science program is your best bet. At 
the library, ask if they have any publications that give profiles 
on computers or software. One such publication is published by 
a firm called Datapro. They provide several tly?ee ring bind- 
ers that list and evaluate small computers, microcomputers, 
software, and so on. You may get lucky and find a description 
of the program you're interested in, along with information 
about how users have reacted to it. 

A second step might be to call the vendor. Ask if you can 
talk with anyone who is currently using the program. If the 
vendor can't supply you with any such contacts, then I would 
wonder about the acceptability of the package. To be sure, the 
vendor is unlikely to have you speak with someone who hates 
the package so it's wise to evaluate carefully the responses you 
get from such sources. 

The problem you're facing is not a unique one ; it's perhaps 
the most difficult problem facing the small business user. I re- 
cently spoke at a workshop for dentists who were interested in 
computerizing their offices. They were Interested in a com- 
plete package (both hardware and software). As they be- 
came more and more involved in gathering data about what 
was available, they felt more and more confused. They 
wondered why one system costs $28,000 and another (seeming- 
ly developed to achieve the same result) would cost $10,000. 
Since there is, indeed, a lot the potential user can do to become 
more proficient at evaluating and selecting among alternative 
systems, a portion of next issue's column will be devoted to 
precisely that topic : A Guide To C!omputerizing Your Busi- 
ness: Doing Your Homework.

as all electronic mail functions. 

Transend comes in three different 
versions. You can begin economically' 
with the simplest form, Ti-ansend 1, 
an intelHgent terminal/file transfer 
system. As your needs increase, you 
can move up to two other IVansend 
packages, without worrying about 
retraining or repurchasing. "Fransend 
2 gives any Apple II intelligent ter- 
minal capabilities, plus file transfer 
with complete error detection and 



automatic retransmission for de- 
manding business applications. 
Transend 3 incorporates electronic 
mail— with password security, text 
editing, mailbox with mailstop, unat- 
tended scheduling and receiving, 
automatic redialing, and much more.

Apple's IQ 



Bv ALLEH mmo 

"The lab has just ordered me a personal computer!" exult- 
ed the Whiz Kid. I was a bit surprised. The Kid had a Ph.D. in 
artificial intelligence and was working on the frontiers of com- 
puter science. I reflected smugly that I'd been using a person- 
al computer for almost three years. 

"What, an Apple?" I asked, prepared to bestow my wis- 
dom bom of experience. The Whiz Kid giggled, not sure that I 
was serious. 

"No, no," he said, "a Lisp personal computer. You know, 
better performance than a dedicated DEC KA-10, forty to nine- 
ty thousand dollars. What good is a personal computer without 
Usp?" 

I was about to try to tell him what good a personal comput- 
er without Lisp could be — about electronic spreadsheets, word 
processing, mailing list programs, and adventure and arcade 
games, not to mention the convenience of Basic and the ele- 
gance of Pascal— when I realized it would all mean nothing to 
him. To workers in artificial intelligence, there is only Lisp — 
and a few even more exotic "object-oriented" languages such 
as Logo and Smalltalk. The history of artificial intelligence — 
the science of making machines think, often much like human 
beings — and the computer programming language Lisp are in- 
timately intertwined. 

Lisp was developed by John McCarthy of MIT in the 19608 
in order to facilitate the development of programs that exhibit 
purposive problem-solving behavior and can process natural 
language. Research projects using Lisp have produced Eliza, 
a program that interacts with the user like a Rogerian or 
"client-centered" psychotherapist, chess-playing programs, 
pattern-recognition systems, intelligent robots, and Shrdlu, a 
system that interprets English commands to move blocks 
about on a table surface. Artificial intelligence is expected to 
play an increasingly important role in providing new applica- 
tion domains for the powerful, inexpensive computers of the 
late 1980s. Lisp is likely to be important in this process. 

The Whiz Kid's personal Lisp computer is real. Xerox re- 
fers to its $59,719 Dolphin/Interlisp machine as a "medium 
sized personal computer." This system and its competitors, 
the Symbolics LM-2 and the Foonly F6, all offer a megabyte or 
more of main memory, 23-80 megabyte hard disk drives. Lisp 
optimization, and many programming environment support 
features. 

"How about color gfraphics?" I asked the Kid. 

"An extra cost option," he admitted. 

Well, Lisp is now available on the Apple II, and lo-res color 



graphics is even included at no extra charge. Total system cost 
is well below the Whiz Kid's system, as well: all you need is a 
32K Apple n (48K recommended) and a $99.95 P-Ldsp soft- 
ware package from Gnosis (Philadelphia, PA) . The package 
includes two versions of the P-Iisp system, one for 32-48K Ap- 
ples and one for 64K Apples. In addition, it offers a Lisp editor 
with a pretty-print function for consistent screen formatting of 
Lisp functions. Two demonstration programs are included: a 
version of the Eliza therapist program, and a Pig Latin pro- 
gram that converts English input to Pig Latin. Of course, the 
P-Lisp package offers something less in speed, maximum pro- 
gram size, and programming environment features than "per- 
sonal computers in the $40,000-$90,000 price range." It does pro- 
vide the user with an excellent opportunity to learn Lisp by us- 
ing Lisp. 

To this end. Gnosis is about to reletise The P-Lisp Tutor- 
ial, designed to introduce the reader to Lisp, using the P-Lisp 
system. The text is $15 and an accompanying diskette is $5. 
The combination of an inexpensive microcomputer Lisp and a 
textbook specifically geared to that implementation of the lan- 
guage has the potential to liberate Lisp from the hothouse aca- 
demic atmosphere that has nurtured it for the past twenty-five 
years. 

P-Lisp. P-Lisp on disk is an Apple DOS-based system (Ap- 
ple DOS commands such as bload and brun are available) . Fif- 
ty-seven Lisp functions are standard in the system, including 
several for control of Apple lo-res graphics. There are no built- 
in functions for reading the Apple paddles or controlling the 
Apple's built-in speaker, but there are peek and poke func- 
tions, which permit the user to write paddle and tone func- 
tions. One of the characteristics of Lisp systems is that users 
tend to add functions to develop a personal version of the lan- 
guage and programming environment. 

Two sample programs are included as examples of P-Llsp 
applications. The sample programs provided will stimulate 
many users to try to improve them. For example, the Pig 
Latin program recognizes spaces, but not punctuation, as word 
boundaries. As a result, the transformed words put out by the 
program can have embedded punctuation marks. The Gno- 
sis version of Eliza is entertaining, but evidences somewhat 
less wit, variety, and "insight" than is revealed in the original 
Eliza dialogues given in Joseph Weizenbaum's Computers and 
Human Reason (San Francisco: Freeman, 1978). 

Bringing up either of the P-Lisp systems is quite simple. To 
use the normal 32-48K Lisp, one can simply boot the Gnosis 
P-Lisp disk and then type brun Lisp. If the system has a 
16K memory card in slot 0, such as an Apple Language Sys- 
tem card or a Microsoft RamCard, then one has the option of 




A SOFTALK BOOK $19.95 



When Roger Wagner isn't writing utility progranns for the Apple computer, planting corn in 
his backyard, publishing communications and utility software, or singing on the beaches near 
San Diego, he contributes a monthly column to Softalk. 

Called Assembly Lines, it deals with assembly language programs at a fundamental level 
and has caused more comment and more mail than any other feature in the magazine. Be- 
cause of the large number of requests, Softalk is now reprinting all Assembly Lines columns 
through December 1981 in a compact form, bound with spiral binding to make reference easy. 

The columns are fleshed out with additional comments and the book will contain handy ref- 
erence information that will put the information you need to program in assembly language in 
one neat package. , 

If you are an aficionado of Roger's column, or if you've got a driving desire to speak to the 
Apple in assembly language, there is no better way to start than by reading Assembly Lines: 
The Book by Roger Wagner. -

using the normal P-Lisp system in the manner Jvist described 
or using the special language card Lisp version. The language 
card Ldsp provides the user with an additional 8K of program 
space, which will be especially welcome to users with larger 
applications. To boot the language card version, one must first 
bring up a DOS 3.3 master diskette, then Insert the Gnosis 
P-Lisp diskette and type brun Lispl. Except for the additional 
memory, the two systems appear to function Identically. 

Gnosis Lisp, like most Lisps, is an Interpretive language. 
When the user types in a function name with arguments, the 
function is immediately evaluated with those arguments. This 
is an excellent feature for beginners in the language and the 
system — there is an immediate system response to every com- 
pleted input. There are speed disadvantages for the advanced 
user with large and complex applications. 

Lisp is a recursive language. This means that a function 
may be partially defined in terms of Itself. When the function Is 
used, it will call Itself recursively until some terminating con- 
dition is reached. The productive use of recursion is somewhat 
limited in P-Lisp. No more than 128 recursive calls of a func- 
tion 'are possible without raising an error condition. 

An editor utility is provided with P-Llsp. One simply types 
(load edit) to invoke the editor. Some practice is reqtilred to 
make effective use of the editor, which is not screen-oriented. 
Instead, the editor requires that one step through the lists that 
comprise a function element by element. Users familiar with 
the Apple Pascal Editor or even the cursor controls of Basic 
are likely to find this a frustrating exercise. The P-Lisp editor 
includes a pretty-printer, which displays functions on the 
screen in a consistent format. 

Documentation for P-Lisp 2.0 consists of twenty-four dense- 
ly written pages. Several sheets of addenda for the enhance- 
ments of the 2.1 release accompany the diskette. The docu- 
mentation accurately describes the P-Llsp system, but it does 
not provide an easy introduction to the Lisp language. For that. 
Gnosis offers The P-Lisp Tutorial. 



The P-Llsp Tutorial. The P-Lisp Tutorial is a printed intro- 
ductory text accompanied by a diskette with a P-Lisp file 
called hook. The text introduces the reader to Lisp through 
guided exploration of P-Llsp. The hook file provides a number 
of Lisp functions described in the text but not available in stan- 
dard P-Llsp. Each chapter of the text is short. Only five to 
twenty minutes are required to read a chapter, work through 
the example, and try out a few test Lisp lists of your own. The 
writing style sometimes suffers from labored wit and exces- 
sive cuteness, but accurately reflects the llghthearted nomen- 
clature commonly found in artificial intelligence programs. 

Completing The P-Lisp Tutorial will not prepare the read- 
er for innovative research in artificial intelligence, or even for 
writing substantial Lisp programs. However, it will prepare 
the reader to tackle meatier introductions to Lisp without the 
benefit of a Lisp Instructor. The P-Lisp Tutorial is an educa- 
tional bootstrap into learning more about Lisp. Three recent 
Lisp texts the "graduate" of The P-Lisp Tutorial might want to 
consider are: 

E. Chamiak, C. Rlesbeck, and D. McDermott. Artificial 
Intelligence Programming. Hillsdale, N.J.: Lawrence Erl- 
baum Associates, 1979. 

K. Tracton. Programmers Guide to LISP. Blue Ridge Sum- 
mit, PA: Tab Books, Inc., 1980. 

P.H. Winston and B.K. Horn. USP. Reading, MA: Addi- 
son- Wesley, 1981. 

The future of personal computing is thought by many ob- 
servers to be bound up with powerful artificial intelligence- 
based systems. There is no doubt that future hardware will be 
capable of supporting such sophisticated environments and 
languages. Whether they will be fully exploited will depend. In 
part, on whether there are applications programmers who can 
take advantage of these features. The P-Lisp package offers 
those who have not had formal training in artificial intelli- 
gence the chance to start acquiring the programming skills of 
the future. JM

Eskimos

Apples 

a nEussA niLKu 


^^^^ 


All photos from the collection of 
Jeff Whittaker, Education Special- 
ist, Bethel School District. Whit- 
taker has been shooting pictures of 
Alaska for the past ten years. 


Among the citizens of Kotzebue, there are Eskimos who 
still hunt polar bear, who chew sour seal skin, and many who 
wear muklucks. And there are many who use computers. 

As children, Americans envision our two groups of natives 
in a rather fairy tale way. Quite soon in our growing up, we 
learn that few American Indians inhabit teepees anymore ; but 
many of us continue to envision our other native Americans, 
the Eskimos, as living in igloos. 



In fact, igloos always were merely temporary dwellings (as 
you might logically deduce), used by hunters on the trail. An 
occasional winter wilderness traveller might still put up an ig- 
loo; but a stateside tourist would be hard-pressed to find one, 
even In the remote Eskimo town of Kotzebue. 

Several hundred Apples are scattered throughout the 
schools of Alaska, some in the most remote Eskimo villages, 
providing one of the more sophisticated educational systems in 
the country for computer literacy. The parka-clad children 
who attend know how to set rabbit traps as well as they know 
how to reset a computer. 

And soon a networking system called Project Walrus will 
link the isolated villages electronically, allowing the adult Es- 
kimos to hold hunting conferences and other information ex- 



changes with neighbors separated from them by miles and 
miles of snow. 

The only thing that's holding up the project is telephone 
installation; some of the villages don't have such facilities yet. 

Not long ago a cheechako (Alaskan for "newcomer") asked 
Donovan J. Rinker, director of telecommunication of the 
Northwest Arctic School District, if he didn't think It was 
slightly unusual that Eskimos were using computers. 

Rinker looked as if he had just been asked the stupidest 
question he had heard all day, but he replied politely, "Most 
Americans don't know too much about Alaska." 

But computers? After all, some parts of Alaska are 
definitely rural, if not primitive. Some Eskimos still haul their 
water from the river. Some children above the Arctic Circle

have never seen a tree, let alone a supermarket, but these 
same kids know all about a computer. 

It makes no sense and it makes perfect sense. 

Remember, Alaska is our biggest state. Put the three next 
largest states together — Texas, California, and Montana — and 
you have a territory approaching the magnitude of Alaska. Ap- 
proximately four hundred sixty thousand Alaskans — Cauca- 
sian, Eskimos, and Indians, make up the population of the en- 
tire state — about as many people as live in Cincinnati. Anchor- 
age and Fairbanks tend to hustle and bustle just like many 
other American cities, but the villages in the north, within shiv- 
ering distance of the Arctic Circle, tend to become isolated dur- 
ing the relentless winter. Then the only way out, to other civili- 
zations or neighboring villages, is travel by airplane, snowmo- 
bile, or dog sled. 

The Communitree, a bulletin board system for access by 
modem built on a branching tree structure, was Red Bou- 
cher's way of breaking the ice. H. A. "Red" Boucher, former 
lieutenant governor of the state and now head of his own con- 
sulting firm, is setting up the networking system throughout 
Alaska. The Communitree is a communication by modem 
device that allows users to converse freely back and forth ; the 
system is set up to allow conferences to extend from the cen- 
tral discussion much in the form of a wildly growing tree. 
Boucher has already set up a Communitree in his Anchorage 
home, from which he talks about Alaska with other people all 
over the world. 

"It taught me how little we really know about each other," 
says Boucher, who made the Communitree a present to the iso- 
lated villages. "So little is known about Alaska. So little is 
known about the first inhabitants of America!" And then he 
relates a lesson on Eskimo history with an eloquent pride 
reserved for cheechakos. 

"Forty thousand years before the birth of Christ, man 
crossed the Bering sea land- bridge to the new world." He 
pauses and a picture of early men and women comes alive, the 
first Americans crunching through the snow from Mongolia to 
what, when later discovered by Russian explorer Vitus Bering 
in 1741, became known as Walrussla. Later it was bought by 
the United States for $7,200,000, approximately two cents an 
acre. Settlers said it was a mystery— not why Russia sold it, 
but why America wanted it. 

"Here we still have the last vestiges of that first frontier. 
People still hunt and fish as a way of life ; a subsistence life- 
style," declares Boucher with finality. 

Eskimos learned to live in the snow and use everything the 
land had to offer. And maybe that's why they didn't turn their 
backs on computers when the machine first arrived in the vil- 
lages. 

But the Americanization of the Eskimo culture has many 
people worried, and one of the most concerned Is Boucher. 

"Rich heritages and languages are being lost," he says. 
Paradoxically, the introduction of the computer network may 
help preserve some of the endangered cultural elements. 

"The Communitree will give young children and old people 
the chance to communicate between villages. I believe there 
will be a lot of conferencing during whaling and caribou 
season, and I see no reason why Eskimo children can't learn to 
program in their native Inuit language." 

Boucher has had his own Apple system since June 1980 and 
started his own user's group which he calls the Sourdough Net- 
work. Again, a bit of history. During the gold nish of the 1800s, 
the prospectors kept a bit of sourdough bread with them to use 
as starter for another batch. These hardy, self-sufficient 
pioneers of Alaska were nicknamed sourdoughs. Today, to 
qualify for sourdough status, a cheechako must wrestle a 
Kodiak bear, climb Mount McKlnley, and spit in the Yukon. To 
become one of Boucher's sourdoughs Is not eus difficult. 

Boucher met one of his sourdoughs, Jeff Whlttaker, while 
looking at software in a computer store in Anchorage. Whlt- 
taker, a teacher, decided his students could use a Communi- 
tree in their village. 

"It's reasonable that I should nan into Red even though we 



live four hundred miles away from each other," explains Whit- 
taker, an education specialist with the Bethel School District in 
western Alaska. "Socially it seems as if this is a very small 
state. People who are active in computers are going to cross 
paths eventually." 

A sourdough in more ways than one, Whlttaker has been 
teaching in the Bureau of Indian Affairs school system for the 
last ten years and has lived in three different villages. He was 
trained at the University of Oregon, but he had to learn a lot 
more when he came to Alaska. 

"There's a bilingual and a blcultural hurdle to cross; some 
of these villages have been extremely isolated. The kids have 
not seen cities, nor even trees — ^the things people In the more 
southern forty-nine states take for granted." 

"Some years ago, I actually overheard a mother tell her 
child 'horses are not real; do not believe them.' " 

The B.I.A. schools are small. Usually three or four teachers 
handle several ages, kindergarten through eighth grade, and 
they face a wide range of instructional problems. But In this 
school system there is generally one Apple for every thirty stu- 
dents. The computers provide a wide range of instruction from 
individual drill and practice to group teaching of computer 
awareness and literacy. The majority of Whlttaker's students 
are not native speakers of English, but they're becoming fluent 
in computer languages. 

Good students are also rewarded with time on the computer 
for plajdng games. Their current favorites are Raster Blas- 
ter, Olympic Decathlon, and Apple Panic. 

"A child anywhere is going to enjoy the entertaining nature 
of a computer. But it takes a little longer for adults. It's still 
new and confusing to the parents." 

Whlttaker feels as if he's at the meeting of two cultures, but 
he's not trying to force his culture upon the Eskimos. 

"Weather and distance have been barriers for the children 
here to see other villages. The Communitree will provide a 
way for children to communicate with each other, make 
friends in other villages, and discover commonalities. They'll 
be, in a sense, electronic pen pals." 

On request, Whlttaker attempted to describe the everyday 
life of a child from an Eskimo village; he made clear he 
doesn't like generalizing, but offered this view from ten years 
experience working with the children. 

Imagine a football field with fifty houses on It. Houses are 
small, but families are large, sometimes eight people in a two- 
room or three-room house. As a rule, there are no roads, jvist 
paths. The entire layout may appear helter-skelter, but the 
houses have been built in practical places, always close to the 
water. In the smaller villages, people carry water to their 
houses, usually from the well or from the river. 
"I am generalizing," reminds Whlttaker. 

Ice skating is everywhere, and although older boys might 
spend their after-school time checking their rabbit Bnares, 
most of the children engage in group games. 

"These children are not as competitive about games as 
most of us are accustomed to seeing. They play for the sake of 
playing, rather than winning. 

"Eskimo children are very good at playing and enjojdng 
life. They're experts at being children. Children in other Amer- 
ican cultures tend to be suppressed by adults. That hasn't hap- 
pened to the Eskimos." 

When all the phone lines are in — not even all the schools had 
telephones — the Communitree will double £U9 a means for 
teachers to exchange ideas. "We're always looking for ways to 
find shortcuts to administrative needs," says Whlttaker. 

Whlttaker's district has dubbed their Communitree the 
Walnis network, an apt acronym that stands for Western ALcu- 
ka RUral Schools. The villages initially participating are Ala- 
kanuk, Chevak, Kaslgluk, Klpnuk, Kwethluk, Nunapitchuk, 
and Tununak. Next fall, Whlttaker expects to see the people of 
Chefomak, Mekoryuk, Napasklak, Newtok, Scammon Bay, 
Toksook Bay, Tuluksak, and Tuntutullak also talking to the 
Walrus. 

But will it work? "Well, we're going to find out," spouted

Red Boucher. "We're not going to push, we're going to put It 
there. We want this to grow naturally, aa a way to bring In ed- 
ucation from other areeia. 

"The kids will help the old-timers. There's no reason why 
they can't program In their native tongue." 

According to Boucher, the micro allows Its users to become 
Information participants In an otherwise sedentary world. "Aa 
a nation, we're used to sitting as spectators, watching elec- 
tronic junk spit out at us from a tube. Out of the twentieth cen- 
tury comes Charlie's Angels. The children of the Alaskan vil- 
lages sit there in wonder, trying to figure out how that all 
relates to them. 

"I believe this network will allow both children and adults 
to carry on a cultural exchange between villages, to learn from 
each other." 

Donovan J. Rinker of the Northwest Arctic School District is 
also setting up a Communitree system for eleven surrounding 
villages. Life in Kotzebue, a town that lies several miles within 
the Arctic Qrcle, seems a universe away from Rinker 's 
former life in Los Angeles, although he left it barely two years 
ago. Outside his Kotzebue office, the winter rages with grey 
and gloomy skies and a wind chill factor that brings the tem- 
perature down to nearly forty degrees below zero. But it's not 
the weather he notices, it's the absence of freeways. 

"The most elaborate car in Kotzebue is a late model Chevy 
station wagon, and they use it as a cab," reflects Rinker, who 
used to spend an hour and forty-five minutes commuting to 
work in southern California — and that on a good day. 

"Now it takes me five minutes to walk to work, thirty se- 
conds if I take my motorcycle," he gloats. "You couldn't blow 
me out of here with a stick of dynamite." 

Life in Alaska is a well-kept secret, according to Rinker. 
"Most people don't think about Alaska in any other terms ex- 
cept that it's cold. 

"But of course it's cold. Right now the sun rises about nlne-

thirty in the morning and sets at two-thirty in the afternoon. 
We're losing about eighteen minutes of sunlight a day. But it's 
real nice. 

"People are marvelously friendly. It's like everybody's 
related. The Eskimos don't take anything from nature they 
can't give back. I wish we could all share their philosophy of 
life." 

There's presently a concerted effort to bring the Eskimo 
culture back into the schools, evidenced by a new requirement 
for all the children to learn Yu'plk, the native language. In 
addition, some of the courses, such as Eskimo history, which 
seem best expressed in the native language, are being taught 
in Yu'plk. 

"We had an historical situation here where the first 
purveyors of Christianity told the Eskimos to speak English, 
that it was heathen for them to speak their native language. 
The folly of that has been realized, and now we're getting the 
language back into the schools." 

Computer-based learning is "an obvious plus" for all 
Alaska, notes Rinker. "It makes sense because of the distance 
between schools. In the northwest Arctic district, there are 
eleven schools spread throughout 36,000 acres." 

Rinker takes great pleasure in destroying the myth about 
Alaska being a backward state, and he won't let you forget 
that you inquired about igloos. "Kotzebue won an ail-Ameri- 
can city award in 1979," he says proudly. "We have a variety of 
housing, and some of our apartments are as modem ba those in 
L.A. The only difference here is that we don't have swimming 
pools or hot tubs." 

Even though there are no igloos, Rinker agrees that there is 
a lot of Eskimo heritage and culture that needs to be saved 
from modernity. And, like Boucher, he believes the Communl- 
trees wiU help. People who talk together learn things from each 
other, and the concept of electronic pen pals isn't foolish to 
Rinker. 

"When you're talking about a computer system, anything 
and everything makes sense." 

One of Boucher's most far-out yet sensible suggestions is 
the electronic potlatch. "What?! Don't tell me you don't know 
what a potlatch is?" exclaimed Boucher. Again the old sour- 
dough geared himself up for a history lesson. 

Potlatches are still very much a part of Eskimo life, 
although their roots in the culture go back almost as far as the 
Bering Sea land-bridge. Boucher describes the potlatch as an 
economic, social, and cultural get-together between villages to 
pay off all debts and obligations, exchange hunting informa- 
tion, and barter walrus hides in exchange for clothes and food. 
There is always a big feast where muktuk (whale blubber) is 
served with Eskimo ice cream for desert. Notes the historian, 
"You haven't lived until you've tried Eskimo ice cream." 

"Cultures tend to preserve themselves by passing on infor- 
mation. No matter what happens to the rest of the country, the 
people want to go on living the same way their ancestors." 

Historically, potlatches have been determined by the 
hunting season or by the weather. Boucher says the Commu- 
nitree can provide an ongoing cultural exchange by allowing 
people in various villages an electronic potlatch to communi- 
cate about their concerns and their needs. The only thing miss- 
ing will be the ice cream. 

So Eskimos will soon have the Communitree to learn about 
each other, and outsiders anywhere in the world can now learn 
about Alaska by calling up the sourdough network through 
their modems. And if microcomputer users make the elec- 
tronic trip to Alaska, Boucher will send them official certifi- 
cates naming them as Honorary Sourdoughs. The last para- 
graph of the Honorary Sourdough certificate allows its bearer 
to "swap stories about Alaska with anyone who will listen." 

Americans are a lot alike, and yet they're different. 

In Alaska computer networks are breaking down some bar- 
riers. Shy Eskimo children will soon be able to make friends in 
neighboring villages. The rest of the world can call the sour- 
dough network. Red Boucher will be there, and he'll tell stories 
to anyone who'll listen. Hi

SOFICARD 
Symposium 

by Greg Hbbettsl 

This month's column will be a first of sorts, the first in 
which we'll have a chance to respond to some of the mail that's 
arrived from readers. Because of the time lag between the 
writing of a column and its appearance in print, specific ques- 
tions from specific readers should long since have been an- 
swered. Nevertheless, we hope that general comments in re- 
sponse to such questions will be of interest to many readers. 

Before we get to the mail, however, our main topic of this 
month — and probably for several months to come — will be the 
CP/M utilities. Since, we hope, this column is being read by 
Apple owners without CP/M as well as those already familiar 
with CP/M, we'll get as basic as possible in our descriptions of 
the programs. Also, we'll try to take them in the order of most 
confusing to least confusing, based on general comments of 
users. With that in mind, PIP will be our first target. 

PIP stands for Peripheral Interchange Program and is one 
of the transient commands available on all CP/M systems. Ap- 
ple users traditionally think of the term peripheral as mean- 
ing a discrete device connected to the Apple via an interface 
card of some type. To Digital Research and hence to CP/M, 
the term is used to describe any module, hardware or soft- 
ware, physical or logical, that interfaces with the operating 
system. In this light, the keyboard, video display, card reader, 
a disk file, and the printer are all examples of peripheral 
devices. 

Now the name Peripheral Interchange Program begins 
to make sense, since this is the means by which these pe- 
ripheral devices exchange data amongfst themselves. In a later 
column covering STAT.COM, we'll have more to say about the 
structure of devices and the ways they can be arranged or 
assigned. For now we'll deal with them in their default 
structure. 

Since PIP is a transient command, it exists as a COM file on 
the disk and is invoked simply by tjrping its name, like so: 
PIP 

PIP always requires additional input to function. But, like 
most other Digital Research utilities, if it is invoked by typing 
only its name, it will prompt the user for additional input with 
an asterisk. If the user is prepared both to invoke PIP and at 
the same time to give it the input it requires, then it can be in- 
voked as follows: 

PIP target =sovirce [opt] 

Since, as its name implies, PIP is a program that allows the 
interchange of data, there must always be both a source from 
which the information is taken and a target for the informa- 
tion to be sent to. There may be more than one source device 
specified, in which case PIP will concatenate the multiple de- 
vices and/or files, reading from left to right. 

As with all CP/M utilities, the positions of the target and 
source devices with respect to the equals sign can be remem- 
bered by analogy with a Basic assignment statement; the ob- 
ject to the right of the equals sign is placed into the object on 
the left, as in A=10 or B$= "hello". 

In addition to the target and source devices, the user may 
also select one or more special options — indicated by the [opt] 
in our example— that direct PIP to give special handling to 
particular data. 

Target and source devices may be disk files or any of the 




following: 

CON: Console device; if CON: is target, then output will be 
to the screen. If CON: is source, then input will be from the 
keyboard. 

TTY: UCl:, AND CRT: Unless specially defined by the 
user, these devices will have the same effect for input and out- 
put as CON:, whether they're used £is targets or as sources. 

RDR: General-purpose reader device. This is typically set 
up to handle input from an input-only device or from the input 
portion of a bidirectional device. Unless the proper hardware 
and software interface has been done, vuse of RDR: with PIP 
will be undefined. Since this is an input-only device ; it can only 
be used as a source, not as a target. 

PTR: URl, and UR2: These devices are to RDR: what 
TTY:, UCl:, and CRT: are to CON:, and the results of using 
them will be same as with RDR: unless special definitions 
have been made. 

PUN: General-purpose output device. This is typically set 
up to handle output from an output-only device or from the out- 
put portion of a bidirectional device. Unless the proper hard- 
ware and software interface has been done, use of PUN: with

PIP will be undefined. Since this is an output-only device, it 
can only be used as a target. 

PTP:, UPl:, and UP2:. These devices are to PUN: what 
TTY : , UCl : , and CRT : are to CON : . The results of using them 
will be the same as with PUN : unless special definitions have 
been made. 

LST: The system list device, usually a printer. It may also 
be assigned to the console, via the TTY: device, if the console 
is used as a teletype producing hard-copy output. Obviously 
this is an output-only device and therefore can only be a tar- 
get, not a source. 

LPT: and ULl: These devices are to LST: what TTY:, 
UCl : , and CRT : are to CON : ; the results of using them will be 
identical to those of using LST: unless special definitions have 
been made. 

In addition to the names we've listed so far, the following 
special names can also be used: 

PRN: This special "device" is the same as LST:, except 
that tabs are expanded at every eighth character position, all 
lines are numbered, and page ejects (form feeds) are inserted 
every sixty lines with an initial eject before printing starts. 
PRN: can be used to create formatted hard copy of files 
created by ED.COM, for example. 

NUL: This special "device" is used with paper tape 
punches as a way of providing necessary leader and trailer on 
the tape. Its effect, when encountered, is to send forty null 
characters (ASCII zeros) to the target device. 

EOF: This special "device" is used to insert the CP/M end- 
of-file character (always an ASCII control-Z) at the end of a 
transfer. This isn't often used, since all ASCII files trknsferred 
via PIP get an automatic end-of-file character. Non- ASCII files 
do not require such a character, since the true end of file — the 
total number of records specified in the file's directory entry — 
is used. 

INP: and OUT: These special "devices" are only usable if 
PIP itself has been altered by DDT to patch in special driver 
routines to interface to some nonstandard peripheral device. It 
is possible, for example, to patch in a routine for getting and 
sending data from and to cassette with these routines, but this 
requires knowledge of assembly language programming, as 
well as of the Apple cassette-handling routines and hardware. 
See the CP/M interface guide portion of the manual for more 
information on this facility. If enough interest is shown in this 
subject, it could be made the focus of a separate column. 

Now that we have examined the possible target and source 
devices, we'll look at the special options that can be invoked. 
Such options must be enclosed in square brackets — achieved 
by control-K and shift-M on Apples with unmodified key- 
boards. 

[B]. This option tells PIP that the source device will be send- 
ing the ASCII x-off character, a control-S, on a regular basis. It 
also directs PIP that when it sees this character it should 
pause input and write out to disk all the data so far received 
and stored temporarily in memory, then return for more in- 
put. This option is most useful when you're reading from a de- 
vice that sends a continuous stream of information that would 
exceed the memory available for buffering it, but which can be 
programmed to send the x-off periodically and also pause its 
output when directed. 

[Dn]. Truncate all lines transferred at column n. This is sup- 
posed to allow the transfer of text with long lines to a narrow 
device. However, it's difficult to imagine a situation where 
data cut off on the right would not be missed. 

[E] . Echo all transfer options to the console as they are per- 
formed. This has the effect of tjrping out the file to the console 
device during transfer and consequently will slow all but print- 
er transfers. 

[F] . Remove any form feeds encountered in the source dur- 
ing transfer. 

[Gn]. This option, for use only with disk files, tells PIP that 
the source file resides in USER No. n, which must be different 
from the current user area. Also, you should be aware that 
wild-card file names like *.* and *.BAS cannot be used with [G]. 

[H]. This tells PIP that the source file is an Intel-format hex 



OMNI 

The "Everything" I/O Board 
for the Apple H & n+ 



OMNI is a multi-function input/output board for the Apple II or 
11+ computer. It provides, on a single board, most of the "missing" 
features needed to make the Apple a complete computer. With 
OMNI your Apple can have: . p^^^„^, ,/q ^^^^ handshaking 

• RS232 Level serial I/O (software 
driven) 

• 24 Hr Real Time Clock with Alarm 

• 2K EPROM with graphics. I/O 
driver, and screen editor firmware 

• 256 Byte PROM supervisory 
firmware 

• Six 2K PROM/EPROM expansion 
sockets software selectable (one 
socket used for Eclectic firmware, 
5 available for user) 





INPUT: 

• Generate full ASCII character set 
from keyboard 

• Optional shift key detection 

• User-definable "soft" keys with 
screen legends 

• Integrated text line editor full 
cursor movement, insertion/ 
deletion modes 

• Key legend stickers included 

• Demonstration Diskette with pro- 
gramming examples and a Soft 
Character Editor 

OUTPUT: 

• Full 96 character ASCII display 

• Concurrent 64 user-definable 
"soft" characters 

• Optional character overstrike and 
EOR on background 

• Optional double-width color 
characters 

• Character rotation in 90° steps 



Never t)efbre have so many functions been available on a single board. 

OMNI was designed with one major goal in mind, flexibility. The 
OMNI system consists of some extremely simple but very sophisticated 
hardware, a large amount of powerful firmware (programs 
permanently residing in Read Only Memory chips), and an equally 
extensive amount of software (programs residing on diskette that 
are loaded into RAM as needed). In addition, OMNI comes with 
extensive documentation.

file. Such files follow a very specific format, as can be seen by 
assembling DUMP. ASM from your master disk and then 
printing or typing the DUMP.HEX file created. PIP will do 
some editing of the file and will allow retries and corrective ac- 
tion if warranted. 

[I]. This option also applies to Intel-format hex files and tells 
PIP to ignore the :00 records in the file. This option automati- 
cally sets the H option. 

[L]. This option translates all upper-case alphabetic char- 
acters to lower case during transfer. 

[N]. With [N] specified, each line transferred will have a line 
number added. The lines will start at one and increment by one 
with leading zeros suppressed and a colon following the num- 
ber. You can optionally specify [N2], which has the effect of in- 
cluding leading zeros in the Une numbers and Inserting a tab 
character following the number. 

[O]. This tells PIP that the file to be transferred is an object 
(non- ASCII) file and therefore that any control-Zs encoun- 
tered do not signify the end of file as they do in ASCII files. If 
[O] is selected, PIP will use the absolute end of file as indicated 
in the file's directory entry to tell when to stop transfer. It 
should be noted PIP automatically assumes all COM files to be 
object files. 

[Pn]. Insert a page eject (form feed) every n lines. If no 
number is specified, or if an n of one is used, PIP will default to 
sixty. If the [F] option is used first, any existing form feeds will 
be eliminated in favor of the ones specified with [P]. 

[Qs control-Z]. This tells PIP to stop the transfer when 
string s is encountered. You must terminate the string in the 
command with a control-Z. See also the [S] option. 

[R]. This option informs PIP that the file used as source is a 
system file. Without this option, PIP will not recognize system 
files. 

[Ss control-Z]. This tells PIP to start transfer when string s 
is encountered. You must terminate the string in the com- 
mand with a control-Z. 

[Tn]. This option tells P7P to expand any tab characters that 
it encounters to every nth column during transfer. This is dlf-

ferent from simply replacing tab characters with n spaces. 
You should be aware of that difference. 

[U]. With this option, PIP is directed to translate all lower- 
case alphabetic characters to upper case during the transfer. 

[V]. This option tells PIP to perform a verify operation on 
every disk write that takes place. With the [V] option in effect, 
the information written to disk is read back and compared 
against what is in memory before new input is taken from the 
source. The target in this case must be a disk file. It is a good 
habit to use the [V] option whenever you transfer data ; the de- 
crease in speed is offset by increased reliability. 

[W]. With [W] in effect, a target disk file that has been set to 
read-only (R/0) will be overwritten without P/P's ausking for 
permission. Without [W], PIP will not overwrite until it inter- 
rogates the console for the user's approval. 

[Z]. This option tells PIP to zero the parity bit on all incom- 
ing ASCII characters during transfer. 

Now that we've gotten all the descriptions out of the way, 
we can talk about P/P's uses. The majority of users treat PIP 
as no more than a simple disk file transfer program. In many 
cases, for a particular user, this may be its only valid applica- 
tion. However, as can be seen by a study of the material in this 
column, PIP is really much more sophisticated than a simple 
file transfer program. Ignoring the abilities that apply to such 
special peripherals as tape readers and the like, it can be used 
as everything from a text file print formatter to a gross form of 
editor. 

As a disk or file copy program, PIP is somewhat slower 
than COPY, but it gives increased control over the files to be 
transferred. The availability of wild-card file names or am- 
biguous file names (as the manual refers to them) makes it 
easy to transfer selected files from a source disk to a format- 
ted target disk. 

For example, PIP B:=A:*.BAS will transfer all files with 
the extension .BAS to the target disk (B: in this case). PIP 
B: = A:*.* will transfer all files, regardless of name or exten- 
sion, to the target disk, PIP B: = A:G*.* will transfer all files 
with names beginning with G and any extension to the target 
disk. And so on. 

This wild-card facility makes Incremental backups on of- 
ten updated files as easy as setting up a system to have all ac- 
tive files share a common name or extension — NEW, for ex- 
ample. A PIP B: =A:*.NEW, and the backup is done. You can 
also create a SUBMIT file that will automate this process even 
further. 

Copjang individual files from disk to disk is only one use of 
PIP in this fashion. Files may also be renamed during the copy 
process, by specifying a new name on the target side. Even du- 
plicate copies of the same file may be made on the same disk, 
simply by specifying a different name for the copy. PIP will 
default to the currently logged drive if there's no drive letter 
specified. 

In addition to copying files, PIP will also edit files during 
transfer or duplication. By using the appropriate options, you 
can have page ejects inserted or ignored, line numbers added, 
upper-case and lower-case conversion made, and so on. You 
can concatenate files, by specifying more than one source file 
name, or you can have only selected data extracted from a file, 
by using the S for Start-at and Q for Qult-at options. Since op- 
tions apply only to the file name or device to which they're im- 
mediately appended, it is possible to combine several options 
and several files without conflict. 

Finally, anyone who has done much with large files using 
ED.COM will attest to the difficulty of editing such files when 
ED line numbers don't show on printed output. By using PIP 
with the target as PRN:, you can get a hard-copy printout 
with line numbers that follow the default numbering of ED. 
Such copy will also have all tabs expanded and page ejects in- 
serted for improved readability. 

Although programs exist that have many of the same spe- 
cial purpose printing and data-capturing facilities (from CP/M 
bulletin boards, for example) many users prefer to use PIP be- 
cause it is easy and because one program will do the work of 
several individual ones. By far the easiest way to learn the use

and versatility of PIP is simply to practice with it. Try out the 
various options, devices, and formats. You'll probably find — as 
many others have in the past — at least one more very substan- 
tial use for this program. 

Before we leave the subject of PIP, there are a couple of 
miscellaneous things that should be mentioned. 

Concatenated source files must be separated by commas, 
and options must be enclosed in square brackets with no other 
punctuation between the source file and the option. Also, op- 
tions apply only to the source file to which they're appended. 
PIP'S default state assumes that source files are true ASCII 
files ending with a control-Z; COM files, however, are as- 
sumed to be object files. The total length of a single command 
line must not exceed 255 characters, and all characters In a 
PIP command line, if given at the same time PIP is invoked 
(that is, on the same line), will be translated to upper case. 
This last fact will seldom cause a problem, since CP/M keeps 
its file names in upper case. However, if you are using the S 
and Q options, the strings you are searcWng for also will be 
transferred to upper case. To avoid this unwanted conversion, 
invoke PIP by typing only its name, and then enter your com- 
mand line at the asterisk prompt. PIP will not translate the 
characters in the strings to upper case if you do it this way. 

When PIP copies or duplicates a file that already exists, it 
creates a temporary file on the disk with the appropriate file- 
name and an extension of .$$$. The original file is only deleted 
and the temporary file renamed to the actual name if the 
transfer operation is successful. Otherwise PIP will indicate 
an error and terminate, leaving the original file intact; the 
temporary filename, in that case, will remain in the directory, 
but the temporary file will be empty. Such temporary files 
should be deleted as soon as possible. Pressing any key on the 
keyboard will also terminate a transfer operation ; PIP will re- 
port the message ABORTED, with the same result as an error 
condition. 

Now — on to the mail. 

Several people have written asking for a reverse of the 
APDOS utility— one that would go from CP/M to Apple DOS. 
Such a utility does exist and, in fact, is included on the disk sold 
as part of the Assembly Language Development System. The 
program is not available separately as yet, since there doesn't 
seem to be sufficient interest to warrant making it a product. 
The program is available in printed form, but unfortunately 
consists of several pages of hex dump. It can, however, be re- 
quested. Perhaps a group effort would reduce the drudgery of 
typing in all that hex dump. As is the case with all such appli- 
cation notes distributed, this material is considered to be in the 
public domain. 

Several people have written to ask whether the SoftCard 
works with the Apple Graphics tablet. To the best of our knowl- 



T A L K JANUARY 1982 

edge, no driver currently exists that will allow these two prod- 
ucts to work together. If anyone knows of such a program, we 
would welcome news of it and report it here. 

Many of you have written concerning the interfacing of ma- 
chine language routines to Basic-80 programs. That subject 
was dealt with briefly during the series on Basic-SO, and more 
esoteric examples will be forthcoming in future columns. 

One very good question received was why the common pro- 
grams MOVCPM and SYSGEN that one reads about were not 
included on the SoftCard diskettes. MOVCPM is a utility that 
makes it possible for the user to relocate CP/M to fit the mem- 
ory size of a particular system — 16K, 32K, 48K, 60K, or what- 
ever. Since the SoftCard can only be used with Apples that are 
either 48K or 64K systems, only two versions of CP/M were 
possible— 44K and 56K. The program CPM56.COM fulfills the 
function of MOVCPM in creating the larger size for those who 
need it. SYSGEN is a program that places the operating sys- 
tem on disk. That function is fulfilled with the SoftCard by us- 
ing C0PY.COM with the /S option. 

We have also received several questions about why the util- 
ities DDT.COM and ylSM.COM are 8080-based programs rath- 
er than Z-80 based, since the SoftCard is a Z-SO-based product. 
Both those programs were developed at a time when CP/M 
was only available for 8080-based machines, and they were 
standard items included with every copy of CP/M. Later, 
when the Z-80 chip became popular and CP/M was made avail- 
able for systems using it, these programs were left as stan- 
dard, since they were still very functional on the newer ma- 
chines. Other assemblers and debuggers designed to take 
advantage of the Z-80 were introduced and sold separately 
for those people who wished to upgrade, but by far the widest 
support among users groups (in the exchange of programs 
and so forth) is still for 8080 code, since, no matter which sys- 
tem you have, 8080 code will execute properly. 

Finally, the problem of available software is still very 
much with us. Most programs written in the CP/M world are 
utilitarian in nature — compilers, assemblers, disk utilities, and 
so on. There is, however, a wealth of public domain software 
out there in the CP/M users groups that can be had for the cost 
of a telephone call to download it. This software ranges from 
games to business applications, and most of it is very good. 
The only real requirement is the use of a modem and connec- 
tion to Micronet or one of the local CP/M user group bulletin 
boards. I would recommend to anyone wishing to expand his 
CP/M library, that he attempt to get up on these boards either 
personally or through his local Apple club, which probably al- 
ready has a Micronet account or at least the phone numbers of 
some existing boards. You may be pleasantly surprised at 
what's out there. 

Until next month ... ^'

POWERFUL THAN THE MOST ADVANCED LANGUAGE AVAILABLE. AND BECAUSE READ ONLY MEMORY NEVER FORGETS, THESE NEW COMMANDS BECOME A 
PERMANENT PART OF APPLESOFT'S* BASIC LANGUAGE. 

PRINT STATEMENT FORMATTING ■ Can you imagine formatting a letter with Applesoft print statements? Monumental to say the least - you 
would have to agree. Well - with the print statement formatting capabilities of the FORMAT ROM all you have to worry about is what 
you want your print statements to say and leave the rest to the FORMAT ROM. You tell the FORMAT ROM, right in your Applesoft 
program, how you want your letter, manuscript, etc. to look and best of all, formatting commands can be changed at any point in your 
program with simple basic commands. FORMAT ROM gives you the same powerful commands as a dedicated word processor 
costing hundreds of dollars. Here are some of the powerful formatting instructions which you will have with the format rom- 
DERNE PRINTING MARGINS - DEHNE THE LENGTH OF A PRINTED LINE - RIGHT HAND JUSTIHCATION - NO WORD WRAP AROUND JUSTIFICATION - AUTOMATIC 
INDENTING OR OUTDENTING OF PARAGRAPHS - SKIPPING OF LINES ARER EACH PRINTED LINE (Double space/Triple space etc.) PAUSE AFTER PRINTING SO 
MANY LINES - CENTER THE NEXT LINE OF TEXT (FORMAT ROM FIGURES IT OUT FOR YOU) - USER DEFINED CHARACTER SUBSTITUTION • FORMAT 
ROM will even put two spaces after each period it finds, even If you forget and only put one space. 

PRINT...USiNG ■ Will format and tabulate the output of alpha/numerical data that has been predefined by you without having to go 
through the basic programming steps to get the format requirements. Five modes of PRINT.. .USING are available: Alpha mode ■ will 
tabulate and right justify strings of any length. Alpha/Numeric mode - will tabulate any predefined string to the left of any predefined 
numerical data which can be formatted in any of the following output modes; Floating Point or Integer with any number of digits, 
Fixed output with any number of decimal places with round off capabilities of positive or negative numbers. Fixed output with 
commas Inserted every third digit from the left of the decimal point. All PRINT. ..USING routines will tabulate, right justify, line up all 
decimal points, pad the right and left side of a number with any predefined character and can be used within formulas or equations 
which will then format the mathematical result. Overflow messages or symbols, defined by you, can be printed if a number overflows 
the limits specified by you. PRINT.. .USING can be used in immediate or deferred and is compatible with all Applesoft basic 
commands.

Word processing programs have done much to simplify the 
lives of microcomputer users. Now you can draft, rewrite, re- 
vise, update, and otherwise modify your written communica- 
tion to your heart's content — no need to start all over again at 
the trusty typewriter or dog-eared legal pad. For many of us, 
our favorite word processing program for the Apple qualifies 
as a small miracle, holding the place of honor reserved pre- 
viously for erasable typing paper and later for self-correcting 
typewriters. 

A Significant Stone Unturned. But as useful as word pro- 
cessors are, they leave one important task undone— they do 
nothing to ensure that the words in that professional-looking 
letter or document are spelled correctly and that no typo- 
graphical errors have crept in during the fever of inspiration 
or the flurry of revision. Not only don't word processors know 
whether accommodate has one m or two, they won't even 
alert you to simple errors — missing letters, transpositions, 
and the like. A good spell-checking program that's compatible 
with the word processor you use holds promise of filling the 
gap. 

We looked at four spell-checking programs for the Apple : 
Goodspell, by Henry G. Brown (Synapse Computer Services, 
Apple Computer /Special Delivery Software) ; Magic Words, 
by Bill Graves and Bill Depew (Artsci) ; Apple Speller (Sensi- 
ble Software) ; and The Dictionary, by Thomas G. Cain and 
James E. Linley (On-Line Systems). Goodspell bears a 1980 
copyright; the other programs are quite recent releases. Each 
requires 48K aiid works best with a printer, although only 
Goodspell and Magic Words require one. Goodspell and Magic 
Words are single-disk drive programs, Apple Speller' a current 
version requires two drives, and The Dictionary accommo- 
dates either one or two. 

To be useful, a spell-checking progfram must be compatible 
with the files your word processor generates. Goodspell is de- 
signed specifically to work with 3.3 Apple Writer files. Magic 
Words is particularly suited to files created on Artsci's Magic 
Window word processor but will also process flies created on 
other word processors that generate standard 3.3 text or 
binary flies. Although the prerelease version of Magic Words 
had not been endowed with Apple Writer compatibility, the 
package you'll find in your store is, according to Artsci. Sen- 
sible Software's Apple Speller is compatible with standard 3.3 
DOS text or binary files, including those generated by Apple 
Pie, Executive Secretary, Letter Perfect, Magic Window, Text 
Editor, Superscribe'II, Word Power, and Write-On, in addition 
to Apple Writer. The current version of The Dictionary is com- 
patible with Apple Pie, Apple Writer, and On-Line 's own 
Suverscribe II. 

Seeing the Trees for the Forest. Now that so many spell- 
checking programs are hitting the market, several questions 
arise. What is a spell checking program supposed to do? How 
do spell-checking programs work? How do the existing pro- 
grams differ? Which program is right for you? 

The primary stated purpose of each of the programs evalu- 
ated is to help you find and correct spelling and typogfraphic er- 
rors in your word processor files. Each program accom- 
plishes this by means of a dictionary or wordbook that's stored 
on disk and loaded into RAM (and, in some cases, into your 
RAM card if you have one) . After the program and the dic- 
tionary have been loaded into memory, your previously gen- 
erated word processor file is checked (proofread) against the 
dictionary. Letter combinations the program isn't familiar 
with are presented to you for consideration. 

All four of the programs allow you to indicate that the spell- 
ings questioned are correct, ask that they either be marked or 



e t ^ 



printed out as errors, or ask that they be ignored, and all allow 
you to generate a printed list of questionable spellings or 
known errors. 

How and What Else. Although these programs can right- 
fully be called spell-checkers, they differ in how they accom- 
plish this task and in the other features they offer. 

Goodspell checks any Apple Writer text file you specify 
against its dictionary and prints out a list of suspected errors. 
After Goodspell is up and running, you insert your Apple 
Writer text file disk in the drive and select one file to be 
checked. Your Apple Writer disk is catalogued. Just in case you 
can't recall the exact file names. In attended operation, Good- 
spell will ignore any words you ask it to and will print the 
others out in a sixty-four-character display showing the word 
in its context, followed by a message showing which word 
wasn't found. Your word and its context will also be displayed 
on the screen. If your Apple has a lower-case chip, certain 
characters (apostrophes and periods, for example) will be 
shown incorrectly on the screen, but will be fine in your print- 
out. When you choose the unattended mode, Goodspell will 
print out in context all words it does not recognize, again fol- 
lowed by the word-not-found indicator. 

In addition to attended/unattended modes for spell-check- 
ing files. Magic Words gives you a printed error list showing 
the page and line numbers at which errors occurred. You can 
vary the error context length, as well as specify such things as 
the width of the column in which the printed-out error line is 
displayed. Magic Words also allows you to create a marked 
file, using whatever character you designate to indicate the oc- 
currence of errors. This makes it easy to locate your errors

later when you use your word processor to correct them. It's 
also possible to correct your errors as you go along and to cre- 
ate a new, completely corrected file on a separate disk without 
rebooting your word processor. Magic Words also allows you 
to add words to its dictionary during the correction process or 
to specify that a particular spelling should be accepted as cor- 
rect but not added to the dictionary. 

Apple Speller offers attended and unattended operations 
and an attractively formatted printed error list that shows 
your word in context. It also allows you to catalog your word 
processor disk if you need help remembering the name of a 
file. It gives you the option of creating marked files so that 
your errors will be easy to spot when you correct your files 
through your word processor. This program also allows you to 
add words to its dictionary during the process of reviewing 
your file. 

The Dictionary offers attended or unattended modes and al- 
lows you to add words to a temporary dictionary during file 
processing. It provides the options of a printed error list or a 
marked file but not the option to have both. The printed error 
list does not give you the context of a questionable spelling; 
what it does do, and shouldn't, is print out the screen prompts 
that guide you through the disk-swapping process. This de- 
tracts somewhat from the appearance of the printed output. 
The presence of a RAM card will be recognized by The Dic- 
tionary and will speed up its spell-checking process. 

Time of Decision. Which program is right for you depends 
on a number of factors, including what word processor you 
use, whether you have one or two disk drives, whether you 
have a RAM card you'd like to make use of, and how much 
money you plan to spend. Processing speed and frequency of 
disk swapping may also be significant considerations. 

Other pertinent variables include dictionary size; diction- 
ary add/delete capabilities; program start-up time, organiza- 
tion, and ease of use; error-handling; adequacy of screen 
prompts; and clarity of written documentation. 

When Size Counts — and When It Doesn't. Dictionary sizes in 
the four evaluated programs are: 14,000 words in Goodspell 
and Magic Words; 25,000 words in The Dictionary; and more 
than 31,000 words in Apple Speller. Although many people 
simply assume that a larger dictionary means a better pro- 
gram, the issues of dictionary size and adequacy have been the 
subjects of considerable discussion. 

Since spell-checking dictionaries are not context sensitive, 
the point can be made that a larger spell-checking dictionary 
may actually increase the possibility that errors will slip by un- 
detected. The more combinations of letters a dictionary recog- 
nizes as words, the greater the probability that it will accept 
some combination as correct even though it doesn't spell the 
word you intended. If you accidentally type the word spear 
when you meant to type the word speak, for example, the dic- 
tionary wiU not alert you to your error, since your error itself is 
a word the dictionary recognizes. 

Focusing entirely on dictionary size obscures another im- 
portant concern— dictionary quality. Given that the English 
language has been estimated to consist of some six hundred 
thousand words, doesn't the usefulness of a dictionary depend 
in large measure on the appropriateness of the words 
selected? 

The matter of dictionary size also brings to mind the sticky 
crocomputer owner an average person? Goodspell'a 14,000- 
word dictionary was designed to meet the needs of the statisti- 
cally defined average person. That turned out to be less than 
adequate to our purposes. Goodspell queried a great many 
words we knew were spelled correctly but it didn't. This is not 
meant to imply that Goodspell is not a useful program in cer- 
tain settings, only that it was not an appropriate spell-checker 
for our text files, which happened to be manuscripts for typi- 
cal Softalk articles. 

A more significant limitation to the Goodspell program 
than dictionary size is that its dictionary cannot be augmented 
or altered. Although words you ask it to ignore while it proc- 



esses a particular file will store temporarily in RAM, the dic- 
tionary itself cannot be permanently updated so that it recog- 
nizes words and abbreviations you use often. This means it 
can't be customized to particular needs. For files such as ours, 
the checking process using Goodspell would necessarily be 
lengthy and repetive. 

While the Magic Words dictionary is no larger than Good- 
spell's it did recognize a higher percentage of the words it en- 
countered in our files. Whether this is indicative of better word 
choice on the part of Magic Words or has more to do with the 
oddities of our files is difficult to ascertain. Neither the Good- 
spell or Magic Words dictionaries will list, so it was not possi- 
ble to compare them to one another in an attempt to account 
for this somewhat unexpected difference. 

Unlike Goodspell' s, the Magic Words dictionary is extensi- 
ble. Applications dictionaries of 400 to 500 words apiece (sig- 
nificantly more if you have a RAM card) can be created to 
complement the main dictionary. Files can be checked against 
these applications dictionaries as required, and, if you need to 
add more than the alloted number of words, you just create 
volume two of a particular appUcations dictionary. If you want 
to add lots of words to the dictionary all at once, you can create 
a text or binary file listing of new words or treat an existing file 
as an appUcations dictionary. 

At more than 31,000 words, Apple Speller's dictionary is the 
largest among the four programs. It is one of the two pro- 
grams that recognizes contractions rather than treating the 
apostrophe as a word separator. It is also extensible — as many 
as five thousand words can be added to its main dictionary 
and, if you should run out of room, you can create additional 
volumes of the dictionary on which to store additional words 
(up to five thousand on each disk onto which you've copied the 
main dictionary) . You can do global adds to the dictionary by 
creating empty dictionary files for words of your own choos- 
ing to reside in ; deleting words from the existing dictionary to

create room for more of your own words Is also a relatively 
simple matter. 

Apple Speller's dictionary is also listable, in whole or in 
part. If you want to know, for instance, all the words that be- 
gin with the letters br, you can ask that they be listed, and they 
will appear on the screen. If you have game paddles hooked 
up, you can vary the speed at which the listing scrolls, from 
slow to lightning quick. 

When we used Apple Speller as a spell-checking program 
for some typical in-house files, it performed extremely well. 
While catching typos such as overweigt and dlightful and a 
misspelling of the word aggression, it recognized most of the 
words we used. This speeded up processing time consider- 
ably. 

On-Line 's Dictionary also sports a rather large (25,000- 
word) lexicon that will list and print out. As the accompanjdng 
documentation forewarns, listing the contents of the wordbook 
requires a lot of paper — approximately one hundred thirty 
sheets — but a printed copy of the main dictionary may come in 
quite handy when you want to add or delete words. The Dic- 
tionary's wordbook is not listable in segments, however, so 
when you ask it to list, be sure you really mean it. If you 
change your mind once you've set things in motion, your best 
bet is to reset and start again. 

The add and delete processes on The Dictionary are 
straightforward, and the program offers single-word add and 
delete as well as addition or deletion of groups of words con- 
tained in a particular file. Up to 1,500 words can be added to the 
main disk before a new one is needed. 

Special Attractlons/Idlosyncracles. Although your pri- 
mary reason for purchasing a spell-checking program is to 
have a way of verifying the correctness of your spelling, vari- 
ous special features of the different programs are likely to in- 
terest you and may even sway the vote to the program you 
eventually decide on. 

Goodspell's major pluses are its basic simplicity of opera-

tion and the fact that it requires only one disk drive. 

Magic Words has various special features to recommend it. 
Among these are its file formatting capability and variable 
context length, its dictionary extension via applications dic- 
tionaries, and its ability to take advantage of a RAM card if 
you have one. Its correct-as-you-go capability and the ability to 
create new corrected files without requiring you to return to 
your word processor are also noteworthy features. In addi- 
tion. Magic Words provides word counts of documents you 
check. The fact that Magic Words is a single-dlsk-drive pro- 
gram that doesn't call for a great deal of disk swapping may 
also rate as a plus, as may the fact that it is intended to work 
with a variety of word processor files in addition to Magic Winr 
dow. 

Among Apple Speller's major pluses are the adequacy 
of its existing dictionary, its extensibility, and the ease of its 
add/delete dictionary functions. Also worth noting are the fact 
that its dictionary is listable, in whole or in part, and the fact 
that it recognizes contractions. Its documentation, simplicity of 
operation, and user friendliness are also strong points, as is the 
fact that it works with a wide variety of word processor files. 
Apple Speller gives you a word count of your file and also al- 
lows you to list all the words of your document in "almost al- 
phabetical order." It will also provide counts of how many 
times each word occurs in your file and tell you how many 
unique words your file contains. From start to finish, this is an 
excellent program. 

The Dictionary's special features include its compatibility 
with a variety of word processors, recognition of contractions, 
a listable and printable dictionary with global and single-word 
add/delete capabilities, and the fact that it will support either 
one or two disk drives. Unfortionately, single drive operation 
requires a lot of disk swapping. Screen prompting through this 
process is quite good, but the pace is annoyingly slow, es- 
pecially on a long file. Also significant is its ability to speed 
processing by taking advantage of a RAM card. 

The Components. Goodspell package consists of the mast- 
er disk on which the program and the dictionary are contained 
and a short, straightforward documentation booklet. You can 
copy the master to create a backup, although you are not di- 
rected to do so. The documentation of the program and the ex- 
plication of the way spell-checking dictionaries work is 
informative. 

The Magic Spell package consists of a master disk and 
documentation in a three-ring binder. The program is copy- 
protected, but a card that's included in the package can be re- 
turned to Artsci in exchange for a back-up disk. Our impres- 
sion is that Magic Window owners who use this program are 
likely to become proficient very quickly, but those unfamiliar 
with Magic Window are likely to have a few adjustments to 
make at first. While the documentation we read (a prelimi- 
nary version) was clearly written, its organization was a bit 
difficult to follow. As we worked with the program (also in its 
prerelease version) , there were times we wished for a bit more 
onscreen prompting. But once we got the hang of it, the logical 
organization of the program became clear. 

The Apple Speller package provides two disks — ^the diction- 
ary disk and the program disk. A card included in the package 
can be returned along with $7.50 to obtain a backup of the copy- 
protected program disk; the dictionary disk is copyable. The 
accompanying documentation, a forty- page softbound book- 
let, is clearly written and logically organized. It takes you step- 
by-step through the program and provides illustrations of the 
screen displays you'll see at various times during program op- 
eration. This manual is easy to refer to when you have a ques- 
tion about a particular function or feature. 

The Dictionary package consists of a wordbook disk which 
is copyable and a program disk which is not, a backup for the 
program disk, and documentation. The preliminary version of 
the documentation we read is certainly adequate, and the il- 
lustrations of typical screen displays are useful.

er for $75, and The Dictionary for $99.96. Hi

JANUARY 1982 



THE BASIC 




Here it is, 1982. Only two years away 
from George Orwell's infamous 1984. He 
predicted that, with the help of comput- 
ers and electronic surveillance. Big 
Brother would be in control of every per- 
son's individual freedoms. 

From the perspective of January 1982, 
it seems quite obvious that the concept of 
Big Brother is, after all, science fiction. 
Among other things, Orwell could not 



foresee the impact that the personal com- 
puter would have on the individual. 

Nineteen eighty-two also brings Ap- 
ple's sixth year in the microcomputer 
market. It seems almost unbelievable 
that a machine less than six years old 
could have such an impact on the Ameri- 
can home and business. 

In that six-year span, very little has 
changed in the basic Apple II system. 




Even though the electronic industry is de- 
veloping new technologies almost daily, 
the Apple II is still one of the best com- 
puters on the market today. 

The most curious point about this six- 
year-old Apple is the fact that even today 
programmers are still discovering new 
tricks the Apple can perform. Programs 
are running faster, sounding better, and, 
most important, offering visual effects 
that two years ago were thought impos- 
sible. 

In this month's Basic Solution we are 
going to review seven memory locations 
that control hi-res graphic displays. A 
number of Basic Solution readers have 
requested a method to allow the Apple to 
draw on the hi-res screen without having 
the user view the action. 

Let's take a look at seven basic com- 
mands that can be used to control upon 
which screen the text, hi-res 1, and hi-res 
2 are displayed: 

1. POKE -16304,0— Go fo graphics 

2. POKE -16297,0— Set hi-re$ graphics 

3. POKE -16302,0— Full screen 

4. POKE -16301,1 — Mixed graphics, four lines 

text 

5. POKE -16300,0— Page 1 

6. POKE -16299,0— Page 2 

7. POKE - 1 6303,0— Set text mode 

Most Basic users use the hgr or hgr2 
command to display the appropriate hi- 
res screen. These commands do, how- 
ever, clear the screen at the same time 
they are being viewed. Clearing the 
screen destroys any graphs, pictures, or 
other information that may be on the 
screen. Any pictures at this point must be 
either drawn or bloaded in from the Ap- 
ple disk. A neat trick following the hgr 
command is using POKE -16303,0. This 
returns the display to the text screen and 
still allows the Apple's hi-res drawing 
commands to operate. After the entire 
screen is drawn or loaded from the disk, 
two pokes, POKE -16304,0 and POKE 
-16297,0, redisplay the hi-res screen with 
whatever information was placed there. 

This same system works for the sec- 
ond hi-res page, but the programmer 
must remember, on returning to text 
mode or to the hi-res screen, that the dis- 
play must be set to the proper page. 
POKE -16299,0 sets the display to page 2. 
POKE -16300,0 sets the display to page 1. 
Even the Basic text command will not re- 
store display to page 1. It must be man- 
ually done. 

Many Apple disk owners have had the 



JANUARY 1982 



139 



"opportunity to run the Apple picture disk. 
This disk, no longer availahle, contained 
many hi-res pictures ; it cycled the user 
through them, one at a time, and then re- 
peated the process. The Basic program 
that controlled this was very simple and 
used the display control commands we're 
discussing. 

Creating your own picture disk is real- 
ly very simple. First, a picture is blooded 
into the first hi-res screen and the poke 
commands are executed to view the 
screen: POKE -16304,0: POKE 
-16297,0; POKE -16302,0. Once the user 
is viewing page 1, the second picture is 
blooded into the second hi-res screen and 
the display is switched to the second 
page, POKE -16299,0. Now, once again, 
while the user is viewing the picture on 
the second page another picture is 
blooded into the first hi-res page and the 
display is switched back to the first hi-res 
page with a single command, POKE 
-16300,0. This process is repeated until 
all the pictures are shown. On exiting the 
picture disk program, the programmer 
must remember to set the display back to 
page one and to text mode, POKE 
-16303,0; POKE -16300,0. 

By using these few simple poke com- 
mands, your programs using hi-res 
graphics can have a much nicer appear- 
ance. Don't be afraid to play euround with 
the commands. They won't damage any 
of your programs and, if you find you're 
lost, a simple press of the reset key will 
restore the values to their proper state. 

The Basic Solution is looking for your 
comments ajtid ideas on future articles 
and subroutines. If one of your routines is 
used in a future Basic Solution, a $10 
credit toward your next software pur- 
chase will be available at your local com- 
puter store. Send your letters to Softalk

Who Was That Child? Many readers 
knew the reference in the November col- 
umn to be to Karl Friedrich Gauss. One, 
Fred Abraham of the Blueberry Brain 
Institute in Waterbury, Vermont, knew 
another, better documented, and more 
memorable version of the story, in which 
Gaviss, after his first two years of formal 
education under the academic tyranny of 
an old-style Teutonic schoolmaster 
named Buttn6r, began his first class in 
arithmetic at the age of ten. 

None of the boys in the class knew 
what an arithmetical progression was. 
Buttner took the opportunity to demon- 
strate his innate superiority by giving the 
class a lengthy addition problem like 
15,486 -I- 15,659 + 15,832 . . . with one hun- 
dred terms and the same step (173) from 
one number to the next; which he would 
grandly solve with a simple formula 
while they all struggled. 

Immediately after Buttner stated the 
problem. Gauss dropped his slate to his 
desk, saying "Ugget se"— there it lies. 
Buttner assumed his youngest pupil was a 



moron. After an hour, he examined the 
students' slates, finding Gauss's bare ex- 
cept for the answer. 

Buttner was impressed and bought 
the boy the best arithmetic text avail- 
able, which Gauss mastered effortlessly. 
"He is beyond me," Buttner said; "I can 
teach him nothing more." 

AbraJiam will receive a bonus $10 
even though he wasn't first in his time 
zone, with thanks. Regular winners are: 
Richard A. Neumark, Saint Paul, Min- 
nesota; G. F. Leeper, Winston-Salem, 
North Carolina; Richard D. Stratton, 
Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Dave 
Brockman, El Cerrito, California. 

To Straighten th^ Record. As several 
of our readers observed and pointed out 
to us, there were some typographical in- 
accuracies in last month's Basic Solu-

When Softalk introduced the Most 
Popular Software Award last January, 
the vote was among all software pro- 
duced prior to January 1, 1981. It seems a 
very long time ago when we recall that 
the winner was Super Invader. Few 
gameplayers remember that disk with- 
out fond memories of fun and frustra- 
tion — but even Super Invader is long out- 
dated now by developments in hi-res 
graphics, animation, speed, smoothness, 
and color. It's definitely time for a new 
reigning program. 

The idea of the Most Popular Soft- 
ware Poll is to give you, the user, the 
chance to voice your opinion. The mar- 
ket may be the final polling place, but we 
believe that, occasionally, a real turkey 
sells very well either on the basis of its 
publisher's reputation or of very effec- 
tive advertising; and sometimes sleep- 
ers appear — programs not given much 
fanfare that pick up speed well after their 
release, selling steadily but never mak- 
ing large waves in the realm of bestsell- 
erdom. 

By the time the votes were counted 
last year, we realized a problem. Many 



packages released during the last three 
months of the year were too new to be 
considered by the voters. Therefore, the 
software contending for this year's title 
includes all that released after October 1, 
1980, and before January 1, 1982. Al- 
though that means some programs have 
two shots at the goodies, a program 
would have to be extremely outstanding 
to overcome having been released very 
late in the year. If such a program did 
win, it would not be eligible to win the fol- 
lowing year as well. 

The list shows many popular pro- 
grams released in this timeframe. The 
list is not exhaustive, and you are wel- 
come to write in other programs. The list 
is intended only to help define the time- 
frame and jog your memory. 

The ballot has room for your top ten 
favorite programs. They may be pro- 
grams of any sort; games, business, util- 
ity, whatever. All the programs you list 
will benefit from your vote. Each will be 
given a value equivalent to its placement 
on your list. When all these values from 
all ballots are totaled up for any pro- 
gram, they will determine its finishing 



place; so, conceivably, a program could 
win very few first place votes and still 
win the award because a great many peo- 
ple placed it second and the vote for first 
was fragmented. 

The author and publisher of the soft- 
ware package you choose as number one 
will receive an award at the West Coast 
Computer Faire. 

Rules. Only one ballot will be accept- 
ed per Apple user; that means that a 
family-owned Apple might generate four 
or five ballots — one from each member 
of the family. Where there are two bal- 
lots from one person, only one will be 
counted if the choices are the same and 
neither will be counted if the choices dif- 
fer. 

Your ballot must reach Softalk by 
February 15, 1982. 

Your vote in a poll such as this helps 
to encourage better and better software 
for all of us. And, armed with that worthy 
purpose as a reason to get out the soft- 
ware you like best, pull up your Apple 
and start running your favorite pro- 
grams to decide between them! 



Here's a list of some of the programs eligible for this year's 
awards. This list was compiled from Softalk's bestseller polls; 
it is not meant to be exhaustive, however, and you may vote for 
any program published between October 1, 1980, and January 
1, 1982.

□ Diarmuid McCarthy, a professor of 
computer science at the College of De- 
sign and Marketing, Dublin, Ireland, has 
an Applesoft tutorial on disk that he 
wishes to make available to Apple users 
everywhere (seeSoftalk, December 1981, 
page 26). The disk, which requires DOS 
3.3 and 48K, can now be obtained from 
three different sources in the United 
States. The International Apple Core is 
featuring it as its disk of the month for 
January and distributing it to Apple user 
groups worldwide. Micro Lab, 2310 Sko- 
kie Valley Road, Highland Park, IL 
60035, will furnish the progfram to anyone 
for a $7 charge that includes costs of disk, 
duplication, and shipping. And David Al- 
pert of Omega Microware, 222 S. River- 
side Plaza, Chicago, IL 60606, has of- 
fered to provide it for anyone who will 
send him a disk and 56 cents in postage. 
He requests a self-addressed label and 
shipping material adequate for a round 
trip. 

□ Canoga Data Systems have expanded 
their facilities in Canoga Park, Califor- 
nia. The change marks a 50 percent in- 
crease in facility size adjacent to their 
previous location and consolidates de- 
sign and product planning groups under 
one roof, as well as giving the manufac- 
turing operation additional space needed 
to support increased sales volume of Ca- 
noga's multiplexer and modem product 
lines. 

□ Comdex drew a crowd from all over 
the world to the jewel of the desert — or 
was Vegas itself part of the attraction? 
No one enjoys a good bet any more than a 
good Australian, and Harry Harper, 
guiding light of Zofarry Enterprises just 
outside Sydney, became a big winner in 
Las Vegas no matter what he may have 
dropped at the tables. He called in on his 
Source accovint that Friday and found his 
wife Zofia (the Zof part of Zofarry) had 
given birth to a Simon Christopher Har- 



per. Simon's father was here to light a 
fire under Vista Computing, who've been 
just about to release Zofarry's Vision 80 
eighty-column card since the West Coast 
Computer Faire last April. The kindling 
took, and the card is finally available. 
Just in case you have trouble, though, 
you can get it through Zofarry Enter- 
prises itself by writing to them at 6A Bur- 
wood Road, Burwood, NSW 2134, Austra- 
lia. Service? Well, Harry gets over here 
about every six months, so. ... In fact, 
according to Harper, the manual has 
schematics of all the innards so any tech- 
nician could service your card. If yours 
couldn't, Zofarry would replace your 
card with a new one immediately. Har- 
per enjoyed the novelty of spending 
Thanksgiving here ; it's a strictly Ameri- 
can holiday. With nothing but football 
and feasting, he was mulling over ways 
to get one instituted Down Under. 

□ Daniel S. Bricklin, chairman of the 
board of Software Arts, has been named 
winner of the Grace Murray Hopper 
Award for his work in the design and de- 
velopment of VisiCalc, the most popular 
microcomputer progfram ever created. 
The award has been given annually since 
1971 by the Association for Computing 
Machinery in recognition of major com- 
puting achievements made by individ- 
uals under thirty years of age. It in- 
cludes a cash award of $1,000 from Sper- 
ry Univac, which Bricklin will donate to 
the Boston Computer Society. 

□ For the third year in a row, the Mid- 
west Affiliation of Computer Clubs, rep- 
resenting about a thousand personal 
computer enthusiasts in twenty clubs 
throughout the midwest and southern 
Canada, will hold its annual exhibition of 
recent advances in the industry — featur- 
ing lectures, demonstrations, contests, 
and a flea market — at Franklin Univer- 
sity in Columbus, Ohio. Potential 
speakers are urged to contact the MACC 
as soon as possible before the start of 
Computerfest 82 on June 18; as are po- 
tential exhibitors who wish to reserve 
booth space— fifty booths available on a 
first come, first served basis; early sub- 
scription rewarded with a discount. Write 
to Midwest Affiliation of Computer Clubs, 
c/o Prof. Don Moore, MACC President, 
201 South Grant Avenue, Columbus, OH 
43215. 

□ Microcon SoftwareCenters, New 
England's first microcomputer software 
retail/consulting store, has officially 
opened in Watertown, Massachusetts. 
Barry Passen, president, said that sales 
and inquiries during the store's first two 



weeks exceeded his original business 
plan projections. Strongest customer re- 
sponse has come from small business op- 
erators able to discuss their needs with 
MSC business consultants and check out 
software on the appropriate hardware in 
the store's showroom. Passen plans to 
open two more stores in 1982 in major 
east coast cities and projects one 
hundred stores by 1985. 
□ Meanwhile, on the west coast: Calling 
for "a computer on every desk and a 
robot in every broom closet," Proto the 
robot concluded his ribbon-cutting cere- 
mony address to a thousand admiring lis- 
teners and officially opened The Soft- 
waire Store in Los Angeles. Glenn John- 
son, the store's founder, wants it to be 
used "in the same context as record 
stores and video stores," and has 
desigfned it as a supermarketlike cen- 
tral location for computer books and 
magazines, plus games and personal and 
business CP/M programs that can be de- 




monstrated on various computers for 
comparison. Seminars are being sched- 
uled to instruct present and potential 
small computer owners on how to apply 
software programs successfully and to 
explore future needs. A free newsletter is 
available. 

□ Christy Lee is the latest addition to the 
increased personnel roster in the newly 
expanded office space of Small Business 
Computer Systems (Lincoln, NE). She 
will be assisting with product develop- 
ment for the accounting software firm. 

□ Expanding its sales functions and 
staff, Olivetti OPE (Tarrytown, NY) has 
appointed Steven Wallace manager of 
their new technical support function. 
Wallace leaves his position as applica- 
tions engineer with the company to take 
on the responsibility, which consolidates 
applications engineering and field ser- 
vice. In further moves to strengthen sales 
activity, OPE appointed Lee H. Heller,

Welcome to Hardtalk. This new Softalk feature will ex- 
plore the hardware side of the Apple II. Our hope is that this 
column will teach everyone a little more about how the Apple 
works, as well as how to connect it to other devices. We will 
also try to evaluate the various peripherals on the market so 
you'll find it easier to determine which ones are right for you. 

Let's start by taking a good "hard" look at the Apple II. 
Remove the cover from your computer and gaze inside. 
There's nothing very exciting in there — just a bunch of little 
black boxes called integrated circuits (also known as ICa or 
chips). Now run your favorite game program or watch the 
computer sort a mailing list of several hundred names. Listen 
to an Apple synthesize speech or recognize verbal commands. 
Or, how about programming the computer to calculate pi to 



help accomplish physical work, computers aid in the perfor- 
mance of mental work. 

A lever is also classified as a mechanical machine and in- 
deed the first "mental machines" were also mechanical 
devices. In fact, the abacus could be considered one of the first 
mental machines. There have been many others since then, in- 
cluding slide rules and adding machines. The modem com- 
puter, however, is an electronic machine. This means that it 
uses stationary electric current controlling devices instead of 
moving mechanical parts. The electronic analogy for the lever 
is an amplifier. An electronic amplifier is nothing more than a 
device that can use a small current or signal to control a 
larger one. As with the lever, energy is still conserved because 
the larger current must be supplied by some other source ; but 




Boarding the Apple Bus, Part 1 



1,000 digits? Now take another look at those little black boxes 
that make all of these things possible. To most people, such a 
feat is nothing short of pure magic! 

Indeed, the Apple II represents a miraculous achievement. 
One of the goals of this column will be to strip away some of the 
magic behind the Apple so you'll understand better what 
makes the computer tick. 

Although you may not become an electronic design 
engineer, you will learn how to connect almost any type of 
equipment to the Apple. This will include ready-made periph- 
erals such as printers, storage devices, and so on, and, from 
time to time, information on how to "roll your own" circuits us- 
ing PIAa, ACIAs, and more. Judging by the positive response 
to Silas Warner's article in October's Softalk, "The Controller 
Even You Can Make," it would appear that a great many Ap- 
ple owners are interested in this subject. 

Before we do anjrthing else, however, let's review the his- 
tory of computers to see how the Apple came into being. 

What Is a Computer? In the world of computers, the Apple 
n stacks up as a relatively small, slow, and limited machine. It 
is considered a personaZ computer because it is usually used by 
only one person at a time, as contrasted to larger time-sharing 
computers that can handle many users simultaneously. 

In most respects, however, the Apple shares the same 
design aa even the most powerful computers. It is a stored-pro- 
gram, digital, electronic machine. This rather lengfthy de- 
scription reflects the entire history of computers. 

First of all, the computer is a machine. This means that it 
does work, or helps accomplish a desired task. A lever is also a 
machine — it can be used to move objects that would otherwise 
be too heavy to move. The lever works by transforming a 
small force over a large distance into a larger force over a 
smaller distance. In obedience to the laws of physics, energy is 
conserved (neither created or lost) , but the desired action oc- 
curs: a small force is changed into a larger one. While levers 



it is the control of the currents that becomes important in 
electronics. 

Almost every electronic device is based upon the use of am- 
plifiers. Originally, vacuum tubes were the primary element; 
now solid state transistors have replaced tubes. Depending 
upon their associated circuitry, amplifiers can also be used to 
accomplish other tasks, such as inverting, adding, performing 
logarithms, or storing electronic signals. 

At this point in history, computers were dealing with analog 
voltage signals much in the same way that a slide rule uses 
analog lengths to accomplish multipUcation and division. Then 
it was discovered that almost any information could be proc- 
essed digitally, and this was something that electronic circuits 
could do exceedingly well. All information to be processed 
by the computer, whether in the form of numbers, text, 
or electronic signals, was first converted to a maze of binary 
ones and zeros. Dealing with only digital signals makes the 
electronics much simpler. Amplifiers, for example, need wor- 
ry no longer about nonlinearities or distortion, since they are 
operating either fully on or fully off. 

This development gave rise to some specialized digital cir- 
cuits called gates. A gate can have one or more inputs but only 
one output. The state of the output (either high or low) is deter- 
mined by the state of its input (s) according to a truth table 
defined for its function. For example, the output of an and gate 
will be high only when all of its Inputs are high. Similar defini- 
tions were worked out for not gates (inverters) , or gates, nor 
gates, and so on. From these primitive gates it is possible to 
build more complex circuits to accomplish such tfusks m the 
adding of two binary numbers. A particular arrangement of 
gates worth mentioning is the flip-flop. This is a circuit that can 
hold its output in one state even after the input signal is 
removed — it is the basic memory element. Thus was bom the 
digital electronic computer. 

One major stumbling block still remained, however. These

JANUARY 1982 




ACIA. Asynchronous Communications Interface Adapter. 
A large scale integrated circuit that allows bus-oriented sys- 
tems such as the Apple to communicate serially with other 
devices. Can be the basis for a serial interface board. 

Address bus. The collection of related wires that carries a 
unique combination of signals (the address) to specify what 
device the CPU is communicating with. The Apple's CPU has 
a sixteen-bit address bus, allowing for 65,536 (two to the six- 
teenth power) different addresses. Every other device in the 
Apple, including RAM, ROM, and on-board and peripheral 
I/O, is assigned a particular address or range of addresses. 

Analog. A signal or entity that can have an infinite number 
of states or values. Most characteristics are analog in na- 
ture — for example, length, time, and speed. Usually used in 
contrast to digital. 

Architecture. The way in which a CPU or computer sys- 
tem is designed. For example, it refers to the number and size 
of the internal registers in a CPU, how instructions are execu- 
ted, addressing schemes, and so on. 

Binary. The base-two number system. It is the simplest 
number system, since it has only two digits: 0 and 1. This is 
very simple to represent with electronic circuits and thus has 
become the basis for all digital computers. 

Bit. Binary dlglT. The smallest unit of digital information. 
Can take on one of two values: 1 (or high, true, +5 volts) or 0 
(also low, false, 0 volts) . 

Board. Short for printed circuit board. A collection of elec- 
tronic devices mounted on a suitable material, usually fiber- 
glass, with copper traces forming the connections between the 
various devices. Can refer to amy peripheral that plugs into one 
of the I/O connectors. 

Bus. A collection of wires that transmit information (elec- 
trical signals) from one circviit to another. Three buses are 
often referred to in the Apple. Two of these are the 6502 CPU's 
address and data buses, "pie eight peripheral connectora at the 
rear of the computer are all basically tied together and are 
sometimes called the Apple bus. 

Byte Eight bits. The basic unit of data the Apple's CPU can 
handle. A hyte can be used to represent any alphanumerical 
character or a number between 0 and 255. 

Card. See board. 

Centronics. Actually the name of a company that manufac- 
tures printers. However, the interface configuration lised by 
them has become a standard for parallel connection of periph- 
erals (usually printers). 
Chip. See IC. 



early computers were programmed by using wires to connect 
various circuit elements. Thus, making a simple change in the 
program could involve a complicated, time-consuming re-wir- 
ing. Programs were also limited in size by this technique. The 
idea of storing the program itself within the machine's memo- 
ry was the final link to today's computers. Replacing the wires 
with a bit pattern in memory means that programs can be 
made more flexible and are limited in size only by the amount 
of memory available. 

Stored-program machines operate by executing instruction 
cycles. Each cycle begins by having the CPU fetch an instruc- 
tion. This simply means that the CPU looks in a particular 
area of memory (where the program is stored) and reads a 
byte of information. This information is then decoded by the 
CPU to direct its further action. Most of the time, the CPU will 
need one or two other bytes of data to finish the operation. All 
of this takes place very rapidly — in the Apple, up to one half 
million instructions can be executed in one second. 

The stored-program technique, coupled with advances in 
digital electronics, has been responsible for the fantastic 



Clock. A very rythmic signal used to keep all of the com- 
puter's circuits synchronized. Very similar to the coxswain on 
a scull that keeps the oarsmen in sync. 

CF/M. Control Program for Microprocessors. One of the 
first operating systems available for small computers based on 
the 8080 (or Z^-BO) CPU. It has become the standard for soft- 
ware distribution among such computers since it allows a pro- 
gram written on one machine to nan without change on any 
other computer that uses CP/M. 

CPU. Central Processing Unit. The "brain" of any com- 
puter system. Like the conductor in an orchestra, it is the cen- 
tral figure that directs the performance of the other circuits. 
Usually one of the large ICs in a computer, 

Data bus. The collection of related wires that carries the 
actual information to be transferred into or out of the CPU. 
The Apple has an eight-bit data buiS which, among other things, 
allows it to operate on one character at a time. 

Digital. A form of electronic circuitry in which all informa- 
tion is processed as binary states (either on or off) . 

DMA. Direct Memory Access. A process whereby a 
peripheral reads or writes directly into memory without going 
through the CPU. 

Eprom. Eraseable PROM. A non- volatile memory element 
that can be programmed and then erased by exposure to ultra- 
violet light (this wipes out the entire array, requiring the chip 
to be completely reprogrammed) . 

Eeprom, Eaprom. Electrically Erasable (Alterable) 
PROM. Similar to an EPROM, but can be erased while still in 
operation, sometimes on a blt-by-bit basis. 

Firmware. A program that has been stored in some sort of 
non- volatile memory device. 

Flip-flop. An electronic circuit that can hold a given logic 
state imtil directed to change. An R-S (Reset-Set) flip-flop has 
two Inputs; one input sets the output high and holds it there un- 
til there is a signal on the other input which brings the output 
low. A toggle flip-flop has only one input, causing the output to 
change state each time there is em input signal. Another type of 
flip-flop is the D (data) latch. This device has a trigger input 
that is used to grab the state of the input signal and hold it until 
the next trigger pulse. 

Handshaking. The control signals used to coordinate com- 
munications between two devices. Makes sure that no data is 
lost because one device was not ready. 

Hertz or Hz. The basic unit of frequency equal to one cycle 
per second. 



growth of computer technology since 1950. The last thirty years 
have brought about dramatic increases in speed and memory 
size, but the basic concepts of the stored-program, digital, elec- 
tronic computer have remained the same — whether applied to 
the latest state-of-the-art mainframe or to the Apple 11. 

All aboard the Bus I Now that you know what type of com- 
puter the Apple is, take a look at figure 1, a block diagram of 
the Apple II. In the upper-left comer is the reference oscillator 
and system timing block. A couple of transistors and a quartz 
crystal form this circuit, which is the heart of the computer. 
The circuit they comprise, known as an oscillator, generates a 
signal that oscillates, or swings back and forth, at a very 
precise rate. In the Apple II, this circuit oscillates over four- 
teen million times per second. 

This signal is then divided down or converted into other sig- 
nals which control all aspects of the computer's operation, in- 
cluding CPU functions, video generation, and memory refresh. 
Everything is tied to the mfuster oscillator or clock; if it stops, 
so does the computer. 6602-based computers, such as the Ap- 

GOTO 148 



JANUARY 1982 SOPTALK W o 147 



IC. Integrated Circuit. A collection of transistors and other 
related electronic components on one piece of silicon (the ma- 
terial used for almost all active electronic components) . Metal 
leads, or pins, allow connection of the internal components to 
an external circuit. 

Interface. The means by which two things communicate. In 
particular, the term refers to the electrical configuration that 
allows two or more devices to pass information. 

Interrupt. Not exactly a hardware term, it refers to a 
process most CPUs can perform. If while the computer is 
executing a given program, an interrupt signal comes in on 
one of the CPU's special pins, it temporarily halts the current 
program, executes a predetermined interrupt routine, and 
then resumes working on the original program. The term 
refers to the actual signal, usually generated by one of the pe- 
ripheral boards in the computer, that is sent to the CPU. 

K. Stands for kilo, the metric prefix for 1000. KHz means 
kilohertz, or 1000 cycles per second. However, when referring 
to certain binary values such as memory size, K may actually 
equal 1024. 

Latch. See Flip-flop. 

Logic State. The condition of a digital signal. May be either 
high or low (1 or 0, -1-5 volts or 0 volts) true or false. 
Microprocessor. See CPU. 

Motherboard. The main circuit board of all complex elec- 
tronic systems, particularly bus-oriented ones. 

Parallel. When refering to communications techniques, a 
system where data is transferred more than one bit at a time 
(for example, eight bits together). 

PIA. Parallel Interface Adapter. A large scale IC used to 
connect parallel data signals to a bus-oriented system such as 
the Apple. 

Pin. A small metal connection device such as is found on 
the outside of ICs or at the "fingers" of a peripheral card that 
goes into one of the I/O connectors. Since all pins look alike, 
they are usually numbered in some standard fashion. 

PROM. Programmable ROM. A ROM that is programmed 



after it has been made. Usually requires special program- 
ming apparatus. 

Pulse. An electronic signal which changes state for a 
relatively short period of time. 

Refresh. The preservation of information held in a dynamic 
memory element. Such memories store data as a minute 
charge that rapidly diminishes. By accessing the memory, the 
charge is replenished; a certain portion of all the memory 
cells, therefore, must be accessed at least several times per 
second. 

RAM. Random Access Memory. The main working 
memory of any computer. In most small computers, anything 
stored in RAM will be lost when the power is turned off. 

ROM. Read Only Memory. A memory device in which in- 
formation is permanently stored as it is being made. Thus, this 
information can be read out but not changed. 

RS-232. A standard specification for serial data transmis- 
sion. It defines the voltage levels, connector assignments, and 
signal types for this form of communication. 

S-100. One of the first and most popular bus structures for 
8080-type computers. Like the Apple bus, it defined what 
signals would be on what pins, connector sizes, and so on, but it 
had twice as many connections. 

Serial. A form of data communication where information is 
passed one bit at a time. See RS-232. 

TTL. Transistor-Transistor-Logic. The most popular of all 
logic IC families. These devices are characterized by their 
operation at 5 volts, with any signal above 2.0 volts considered 
as high and anything below 0.8 volts being low. 

Volatile. Refers to memory that forgets whenever the 
power is removed. 

Z-80. An improved version of the 8080 that was completely 
compatible with all software written for the 8080. 

6502. The CPU chip used in the Apple as well as in many 
other computers. 

8080. An older generation CPU chip that helped power the 
tremendous growth of small computers.

pie, also use a two- phase clock that is generated by the CPU 
from the master clock. These are two signals which are com- 
plimentary, that is, when one is high, the other is low. La- 
belled phase one ( 1) and phase two ( 2) , they help coordinate 
data transfer in and out of the CPU. For example, when the 
CPU wants to read data from memory, it will put out the ap- 
propriate address on the address bus while the phase one clock 
is high. Then it will transfer in the information on the data bus 
at the end of the phase two clock. These clock signals will be 
used by almost all other devices connected to the CPU. 

Next comes the sync counter, which has the job of handling 
the video display. It makes sure the video memory is read out 
at the proper rate so that the video signal is compatible with 
existing TV standards (60 Hz frame rate in the United States, 
50 Hz for European Apples). In between each CPU cycle, the 
sync counter grabs a byte of data from the video RAM and 
passes it to the video generator. The sync counter also accom- 
plishes the necessary refresh of the djTiamic RAMs. 

The video generator takes the data received from memory 
and creates the proper picture display, either text or graphics. 
Text characters are formed by reading out of a pre-pro- 
grammed ROM that determines which dots must be turned on 
within a 5x7 array to form the desired image. The top row 
of dots for all 40 characters on a line is generated first. Then 
come the second and third rows and so on. After eight scan 
lines on the monitor, a complete line of forty characters will 
have been displayed. 

The next block represents the power supply which, as its 
name denotes, supplies power to all of the circuits in the com- 
puter. By the way, this is a switching-regulator-type supply, 
which makes it much smaller, lighter, and more efficient than 
a conventional supply.

Jumping to the next square, you find the peripheral I/O. 
This may be a small step on the diagram, but It vraa a giant 
leap for the Apple II. Through these Innocent-looking connec- 
tors in the back of the computer came a flood of peripherals. In 
fact, we have reached the point where the Apple Itself could be 
considered a peripheral to some of its add-on boards. 

One of the reasons the Apple has gained such acceptance 
among peripheral makers is the forethought that went into the 
design of the peripheral connector arrangement, or Apple bus. 
The Apple bus consists of fifty pins that carry the usual ad- 
dress, data, timing, control, and power signals. For the most 
part, this is a standard bus structure with all connectors tied 
together, pin for pin, in parallel. However, several pins on the 
connectors have been isolated, allowing additional decoding to 
make each slot unique. This additional coding eliminated the 
need for several chips on almost every card that would be de- 
signed for the Apple. Figure 2 shows the details of the Apple 
bus. 

Coupled with the peripheral I/O is the on-board I/O. This 
term refers to the cassette, keyboard, speaker, and game I/O 
connector. The cassette and speaker outputs are simply flip- 
flops, or latches, that respond to varioiis addresses sent out by 
the CPU. For example, whenever the hex address $C020 is 
placed on the address bus, the state of the cassette latch will 
change ; that is, if it was high it will go low, or vice versa. Ad- 
dress $C030 does the same for the speaker latch. Although one 
such event would not be of much use, a software loop routine 
can trigger the latch many times a second to create a square 
wave signal. Since the CPU operates at about 1 MHz, frequen- 
cies up to 100 kHz are possible. When you have an error or type 
control-G, for example, a routine in the Apple's Monitor firm- 
ware generates a 1 kHz tone for one tenth of a second which 
emanates from the speaker. A similar routine generates tones 
that can be recorded on a tape recorder to store programs and 
data.

The four annunciator outputs on the game I/O connector 
act like R-S flip-flops. One address turns them on, another 
turns them off. Three other outputs are provided, although 
they were not latched. This means that they will put out a very 
short pulse each time they are addressed. These pulses, also 
called strobes, are used as: 1) a utility signal on the game I/O 
connector (normally not used) , 2) a clear keyboard strobe sig- 
nifying that the software has read the last pressed key, and 3) 
a start sigfnal to tell the paddle timers to begin counting. 

On the input side is the keyboard, which generates seven- 
bit code according to which key is hit. The keyboard uses the 
standard ASCII code and sets the high order bit whenever a 
key is pressed. The pushbutton and game controller inputs axe 
read by testing the highest order bit of their memory location. 
For the pushbuttons, this bit will reflect the TTL level present 
on that input. 

The game controller inputs, however, are used to represent 
an analog resistance value. They do this by using a timer cir- 
cuit. The timer is started by the paddle strobe described pre- 
viously. The output of the timer will remain high for a period of 
time determined by the resistance value of the external pad- 
dle or joystick. To determine this resistance, a software loop is 
employed to keep checking the status of the timer output. Each 
time through the loop, the software increments a counter to 
keep track of the time. When the timer's output finally goes 
low, the program exits the loop with the contents of the coun- 
ter indicating how many times the loop executed. This num- 
ber will be directly proportional to the time constant of the cir- 
cuit, which, in turn, is proportional to the external resistance 
and therefore to the position of the paddle or joystick. 

Moving to the left now, we see the RAM address MUX 
(multiplexor) . This circuit takes care of two important func- 
tions. First, it allows both the CPU and the video generation 
circuits to access the RAM without conflict. In between each 
memory access by the CPU, the video generation circuit is al- 
lowed to jump in and grab one bj^e of data. Since the video cir- 
cuits must read out an entire screenful sixty times a second, 
they are constantly accessing at least IK of memory at this 
rate. This conveniently solves the problem of refreshing the 
dynamic RAMs used in the Apple. The second function of the 
address MUX is to satisfy the memory chips' addressing 
scheme whereby the twelve-bit address is sent to the chips six 
bits at a time. F^her control is provided by the RAM select 
circuits (which also used to allow either 4K or 16K RAM chips 
to be used). 

The next block represents the 8K to 12K of ROM that holds 
the system Monitor and either Integer or Applesoft Basic. This 
block is what gives the Apple its intelligence when it is first 
turned on. 

Last, but certainly not least significant, is the CPU itself, 
along with some associated circuits that let it control the rest of 
the computer. Also shown on the diagram is the DMA (Direct 
Memory Access) signal which can be used to transfer data into 
or out of memory without using the CPU. During a DMA re- 
quest, the CPU's address and data buses would be shut off, al- 
lowing the requesting device to take over these buses and ac- 
cess memory directly. Although this is a powerful technique, it 
is rarely used on the Apple. With the exception of DMA and 
video generation (which is a form of DMA) , all data is trans- 
ferred via the CPU. 

A Preview of What's To Come. Now that we have some 
background on how the Apple works, we can begin to examine 
the numerous devices that can be attached to the computer. 
Next month, we will explore printers and how to hook them up. 
In the future we will cover such subjects as prototyping, firm- 
ware expansion, I/O protocol, and interrupts. Hardware re- 
views will include paddle/joystick selection, an IEEE GPIB 
controller, cooling devices, mass storage alternatives, and co- 
processor boards. If you have questions, topic ideas, or prod- 
ucts you wish to see reviewed, please send your comments to

Exploring Business Basic, Part 5 



Last month's column promised the 
answer to the question, How many bytes 
of memory are available In a 256K Apple 
m? As you know, the 256K Apple m has 
been announced and Is beginning to be 
available, so the answer can now be re- 
vealed: 191,484 bytes! That's more than 
three times the workspace available in 
any other personal computer Basic. 
(Aren't you glad you've got an Apple HI? 
Don't you wish everybody did?) We were 
discussing some sorting techniques for 
our database that can make good use of 
that space. This time we'll explore a 
mixed bag of items, deferring our dis- 
cussion of the print using capabilities of 
Business Basic until next time. 

Our Mixed Bag. The first bagged item 
this month is the mailbag. Several ques- 
tions have come my way since this series 
started in September; the most interest- 
ing ones have to do with programming 
style and philosophy. The most intrigu- 
ing question concerned why I always use 
lower case variable names in my pro- 
grams, especially since the Basic key- 
words (like print) all seem to be in caps. 
While it would be easy to say that I lack 
the strength or will to operate the alpha 
lock key, the real reason has to do with 
the way Beusic itself works. 

As you probably know, Business Ba- 
sic defers its syntax checking (looking 
for errors) until you actually run the pro- 
gram. Basic does perform some tasks as 
each statement is entered, however; the 
process is generally referred to as token- 
iaing. Simply stated, this means that Ba- 
sic scans each statement and converts 
each keyword, sometimes called a re- 
served word, into a special internal one- 
byte code called a token. This code not 
only saves space, but also simplifies er- 
ror checking and program execution. 

Almost all Basic interpreters use the 
tokenizing technique. One of the conse- 
quences of this method is that program 
statements cannot be listed out without 



the Basic list command converting these 
tokens back to their English-language 
equivalents. In converting the tokens, 
Basic always prints out the upper-case 
version of the keywords. I type in all Ba- 
sic statements — both variables and key- 
words — in lower case so that when I list 
out a program, I can see what Basic in- 
terpreted as kejrwords. If I misspell 
print, Basic will not recognize it as a key- 
word, and the fact that It remains lower 
case makes such an error easy to spot in 
a listing. In addition. Business Basic re- 
quires spaces between keywords and 
variable names, to allow variables to 
contain keywords themselves. 

Ever try to use a variable like Or- 
ange in Applesoft, only to discover that or 
is a reserved word (and therefore your 
variable must be renamed to something 
like mge)t Tjrping variable names in 
lower case will allow you to spot those 
times you forgot to space and ended up 
with "fori=l TO 10" instead of "FOR 1=1 
TO 10". The first instance will produce an 
error, since Bfusic will assume you are 
trying to assign the value of 1 to the vari- 
able fori and for some reason put the 
phrase "TO 10" onto the end of the state- 
ment. Some examples will clarify: 

Typing: 10pruntx'''53 will result in: 10 

pruntx*53 

whereas: 10 print x*53 will result in: 10 

PRINT x*53 

Typing: 10onxgoto20< will result in: 10 ON 
40,50 xgoto20,40,50 

whereas: 10 on x goto 20, will result In: 10 ON 
40,50 X GOTO 20,40,50 

See how much easier it is to catch the er- 
ror when it's displayed visually? 

As with every rule, there are excep- 
tions. Any variable that starts with the 
letters "FN" will be assumed to be a 
function name. Again, typing all lower 
case will help you spot the problem: 



Typing: 10xval = aval* will result In; 10 

fnumber xvai = aval* FNumber 

and you'll immediately know some- 
thing's wrong (assuming that you really 
wanted to use fnumber as a variable 
name). 

There's another little quirk in Basic 
that this technique helped me spot. As 
you may know, we've used the on eof# 
statement quite a bit to take action if a 
program tries to read past the end of file. 
According to the manual, the part fol- 
lowing eo/#n can be any executable state- 
ment. So far, we've generally used goto 
or gosub statements to take action. 

Consider the following: 

Typing: 10 on eof#1 goto 20 

will result In: 10 ON EOF#1 GOTO 20 

as you'd expect. But: 

Typing: 10 on eof#1 xval = 20 
will result in: 10 ON EOF#xval = 20 

For some reason Basic treats the whole 
thing as one variable. The solution in- 
volves dredging up a bit of Basic folk- 
lore. Remember in your first class in 
Basic when they told you that all assign- 
ment statements started with the key- 
word let? Most Basic dialects have long 
since made the let keyword optional, and 
most people have quit using it altogeth- 
er. An example of the use of let is: 

10 LET x=45 which is usually written simply: 10 
x=45 

If there's any ambiguity to the way a 
statement can be Interpreted, let can be 
used to clear it up. Witih our new version 
of the eof statement : 

typing: 10 on 6oW let xval = 20 

will result in: 10 ON EOF#1 LET xval=20 

and everjrthing works fine. The fact that 
Basic failed to upshift the reserved word 
eof in the example above is very Impor- 
tant to an understanding of the problem.

The technique of entering everything In 
lower case has saved me countless hours 
of debugging my errors. I recommend it. 

Bag Item Number Two. Last month's 
list of new goodies in Business Basic 1.1 
completely overlooked one item which, 
while it may seem minor, has Important 
consequences. The change is an exten- 
sion to the standard get statement. Nor- 
mally, as is the case in Applesoft and 
some other Basics, get allows reading the 
keyboard one character at a time, in- 
cluding all special control characters and 
delimiters. This means you can bypass 
control-C and return, read commas, and 
so on. 

Business Bajsic 1.1 extends get to al- 
low get#n. This means you can read any 
SOS file one character at a time, without 
respect to what kind of file it is. This can 
be very handy for reading all characters 
from the communications port (via the 
.RS232 driver) or for reading other char- 
acter streams from special devices. One 
of its most interesting traits, however, is 
the fact that it can be used on disk files as 
well. Remember that one file is just like 
another in the SOS environment, so if we 
open a text file on disk, get^ will allow us 
to read one character at a time from it. 

This means that there's now an easy 
way to read text files that contain more 
than 255 characters without a return 
character. Normally a string overflow 
error results if you attempt to read such

text files with the Basic input statement. 
Even more interesting is the fact that we 
can also open and read from the Basic 
data file. Remember that I described the 
data file as having special tags, called 
type bytes, that enable Basic to deter- 
mine what data type is stored next in the 
file. Remember also that numeric data is 
stored in a data file in its binary form. 
Get# allows reading this binary informa- 
tion, one byte at a time. One example is 
worth a thousand explanations: 



5 


INPUT"File to dump: ";a$ 


10 


IF a$ = "" THEN 100 


15 




20 


ON EOF#l GOTO 100 


25 


cr$=CHR$(13) 


30 


GET#l;a$ 


40 


IF a$ = cr$ THEN PRINT 


50 


PRINT a$; 


70 


GOTO 30 


100 


CLOSE 


110 


END 



This simple example will dump any 
text file to the screen, no matter how long 
the intervals between carriage returns. A 
good example of a text file with arbitrar- 
ily long strings is the file I'm creating 
•now, using Applewriter III. Return char- 
acters are inserted only at the end of 
paragraphs which, as you'll notice, tend 
to run on indefinitely. 

Note that this program looks for re- 
turn characters by loading the variable 
cr$ with a return (decimal 13) and then 
testing for it before printing. If you want- 
ed to reconstruct strings from the file, 
you could do so by using a string vari- 
able to accumulate characters, stopping 
when a return was encountered. You'd 
need to test to be sure you hadn't over- 
flowed the 255 character limit. 

This program has one serious de- 
ficiency, however. Printing arbitrary 
characters from a file (especially a data 
file) can have weird consequences when 
the output device is the console, as it is in 
the example program. The console uses 
lots of different control sequences to per- 
form functions, including setting win- 
dows and changing from black and white 
to color text modes. Also, a bj^te can con- 
tain 256 different characters, and the 
ASCII character set defines only 128. 
Clearly, we need a safe and consistent 
way to display any byte readable from a 
file. So, like most programs that start out 
short and simple, this last one's about to 
get complex: 



5 


INPUT"Flle to dump: ",a$ 


10 


IF a$ = "" THEN 95 


15 


OPEN#l,a$ 


20 


INPUT"File for output: ";a$ 


25 




30 


ON EOFjid LET eof.occurred= l:GOTO 80 


35 


bytes = O:eof .occurred = 0 


40 


line$ = "" 


45 


PRINT#2;HEX$(byte5);"-";HEX$(bytes+31);" 


50 


FOR i=l TO 32 


55 




57 


val = ASC(a$):IF val>127 THEN 



val=val-128 



60 IF val<32 THEN llne$ = line$ + " 

.":ELSE:line$ = line$+""+CHR$(val) 

65 outhex$=HEX$(ASC(a$)) 

70 PRINT#2;MID$(outhex$,3,2); 

75 NEXT i 

80 PRINT#2:PRINT#2;" ";line$ 

85 bytes = bytes +32 

90 IF eof.occurred = 0 THEN 40 

95 CLOSE 

120 END 

As you scan through the program, 
note that in addition to opening the file to 
be dumped, we open a second file to 
which the output is written. This gives ua 
more flexibility, and still allows us to use 
.console to see the output on the screen. 
Line 30 sets up our end-of-file condition, 
using the let statement to get around the 
problem we described earlier, and dem- 
onstrates one other handy thing. We can 
embed periods in variable names to im- 
prove readability. It's obvious that 
eof. occurred is easier to interpret than 
eofoccurred, and this is especially true 
for more complex variable names (re- 
member that Business Basic permits 64- 
character names) . 

Lines 35 and 40 initialize variables. We 
will be using the line$ string to accumu- 
late the characters read from the file for 
later printing. After each line of print we 
will reinitialize the string. Since we'll be 
printing thirty-two characters at a time 
from the file, line 45 uses the hex$ func- 
tion to set up the labels for each line. 

A note about hex is appropriate here. 
Hex stands for hexadecimal, or base-16, 
arithmetic. Since any hex digit can be 
represented by four binary bits and a 
byte can be exactly represented by two 
hex digits, it is convenient to use hexa- 
decimal numbering in many aspects of 
computing. It is preferred over decimal 
and octal notation and is, of course, much 
more compact than binary. What usual- 
ly throws people is that to represent all 
values between 0 and 15 with a single 
digit, hex uses the numerals 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, respectively. F 
thus is equivalent to decimal 15, and IF to 
decimal 31 (the 1 is in the sixteens place) . 

We won't try to offer an in-depth ex- 
planation of hexadecimal notation here. 
If you aren't familiar with it, any begin- 
ning text on computers usually covers 
the subject thoroughly, and readers of 
Roger Wagner's column in this maga- 
zine have been inundated with help on 
hex. Suffice it to say that the hex$ func- 
tion will convert any reasonable nu- 
meric quantity into a four-byte string of 
hex digits. 

Getting back to our program, the loop 
from line 50 to line 75 is the main one 
where we dump thirty-two bytes at a 
time in hex format, while providing char- 
acter representations for those within the 
displayable range (hex 20 to 7F, decimal 
32 to 127). The back of your Basic man- 
ual contains an ASCII code chart that 
will help you follow along with the decod- 
ing. Line 57 in the program seta the vari-

able val to the ASCII value of the byte 
just read, and then an if statement 
checks to see if the value is in the 128 to 
255 range. If so, 128 is subtracted from 
the original value to bring it within the 
normal ASCII range. 

Line 60 checks to see if the resulting 
character is a control character, and if 
so, represents it as a period in line$ to sig- 
nify that it is unprintable. Otherwise, the 
character representation is stored. The 
characters are right justified in each two- 
b3^e cell, because they'll be printed be- 
low the hex values. Next, the hex value of 
the original character is assigned to out- 
hex$ in line 65, and printed to the output 
file in line 70. Since we want only the 
rightmost two hex digits, the mid$ func- 
tion is used. After the loop prints out the 
thirty-two values, lines 80-90 print the 
ASCII equivalents stored in line$, bump 
the byte count, check for eof condition, 
and repeat the sequence. 

Figure 1 shows how the output from 
this little jewel looks when run against 
the file for the first draft of this article. 

Messy, huh? Let's look more closely 
at the output to see if it makes sense. The 
first line tells us we are looking at bytes 
00 through IF (0 to 31 decimal) , and the 
top line is the hex representation of the 
characters, two digits per character. The 
first character in the file is 2E in hex, 
which happens to be a period. Notice that 
2E is the character printed below on the 
next line. The next two characters in the 
file are 63 and 6A which correspond to the 
ASCII characters c and j. This is under- 
standable, since Applewriter III uses the 
print format command .cj for center- jus- 
tify, which is what I wanted done with the 
title. The next character is OD which 
translates to decimal 13, or a return char- 
acter. Note that a period is substituted 
for this character on the print line, since 
return is in the control character range. 
And so on, and so on. Practice on a few 
text files of your own and get a feel for 
reading the notation. 

It really gets interesting when we be- 



gin reading files whose exact format is 
normally pretty obscure. Data files are 
an excellent example since, although the 
read# statement can get data out, things 
like the type bytes and string-length 
bj^es are normally inaccessible. To see 
how our dump program would work on a 
data file, we need a way to generate an 
interesting file at which to look. The fol- 
lowing simple program will do the trick. 
When we get serious later on about sort- 
ing techniques, we'll need such a pro- 
gram, so I'll introduce it now:

This program will create a random ac- 
cess data file of arbitrary length contain- 
ing an integer, a string, a real, and a long 
integer in each record. What's notewor- 
thy here are the two small loops that 
build the string value. They're set up in 
such a way as to insure that the first five 
characters are upper-case alpha and the 
next four are decimal digits. Type the 
program in now and run it to create a 
small file, say five records. Although 
each run will differ, the output should 
look something like this :

Figure 2. 



Now for the fun. When you run your 
dump program against the file this pro- 
gram creates, the output should look 
something like figure 2. 

Well, nobody said computer science 
was for the faint of heart ! By the way, the 
term generally used to refer to this type 
of listing of file contents is formatted 
dump. Formatted, because we have or- 
ganized the information in the printout, 
and dump, because it is a nonselective 
output of the exact contents of the file. 

Now the fun begins. The first thing to 
notice is that almost the entire first line is 
composed of zeros. Remember that al- 
though our dump program starts at the 
beginning of the file, the program we 
used to create this file began at record 1. 
Since the record size was thirty bytes, we 
would expect to find an empty record of 
thirty bytes at the beginning, and that's 
exactly what the dump shows. This 
means that the hex 12 in byte 31 of the file 
must be at the beginning of record 1. Now 
something that was mentioned earlier 
about type bytes in data files becomes 
important. Remember that the general 
format of a data file is: 



Type byte Data bytes (2,4 or 8) 



for numeric values (integer, real and 
long integer), and: 



Type byte 



Length byte 



Data bytes (0 to 255) 



for strings. This information should en- 
able us to decode the information in this 
dump. 

Since the first value in the record was 
an integer, the hex code 12 must be the 
type byte for integer data. Following our 
format, this means the next two bytes 
(hex codes 08 and 2C) must be the binary 
integer value. Evaluating the hex value 
082C yields decimal value 2092, exactly 
the value our printout led us to expect. 

The next value in the file is a string, 
which contained CEEBE4542. Referring 
again to our format for strings in data 
files, we'd expect the next file byte to be 
the type byte. That's the hex code 21. 
Next is the length byte, which, since the 
string is nine characters long, should be 



equal to 9. That's hex code 09, one of 
those lucky hex numbers that is the same 
as its decimal equivalent. After that, oiir 
format line shows that indeed, the string 
value is CEEBE4542. 

The next value in the record was real. 
Since the next byte after the string should 
be the type byte for reals, we can con- 
clude that the hex 14 found in position 2C 
(44 in decimal) is the floating-point type 
byte. Floating-point numbers are stored 
in a thirty-two-bit internal format in Busi- 
ness Basic, so we would expect the next 
four bytes to contain the binary value. 
Proving that this value (hex A1661722) is 
equal to 7.72055E-I-09 is a considerably 
more complex task and will be left to the 
numerically inclined reader. That phrase 
"left to the numerically inclined reader" 
is this author's equivalent to the famous 
line found in all math texts — "it can 
easily be shown that . . ."—and is just as 
big a cop-out. 

The last value in the record is a long 
integer, and the type byte in position 31 
(decimal 49) has the value of hex 18. 
Long integers are stored as eight byte 
quantities, therefore the next sixteen hex 
digits should represent the number. Since 
that hex value is 00034EA713C9C400, it 
follows that converting this value should 
yield the decimal value originally print- 
ed out: 930904428626944. 

As a little added bonus in this article, 
let me offer a program that demon- 
strates the truth of the preceding state- 
ment. This program will convert any rea- 
sonable hex value into decimal and print 
it out rather quickly, using the long-inte- 
ger data type and Business Basic's con- 
version functions. Forthwith, it is: 

5 sixteen&=16 

10 INPUT"hex value: ";a$ 

15 IF a$="" THEN 100 

20 cum& = 0 

25 mult&=l 

30 FOR i = LEN(a$) TO STEP- 1 

35 val& = CONV&(TEN(MID$(a$;l,))) 

40 diglt& = mult&*val& 

45 cum& = cum&+dlgit& 

50 mult& = mult&*sixteen8i 

55 NEXT i 

60 PRINT cum& 

65 GOTO 10 

100 END 

The program simply brute forces the 



problem, one digit at a time, but since the 
long integer arithmetic is very fast, pro- 
gram performance is quite reasonable. 
This program knows nothing about sign 
bits, though, so it will fail to convert nega- 
tive integers expressed as hex constants. 
A fix for this limitation would be to check 
for the high-order bit and negate the fi- 
nal result, but the program would then 
lose its general nature. Anyway, it's free. 

Well, that got us completely off track. 
Going back for a second to the formatted 
dump, we are now at position 3 A hex (58 
decimal) , which is really position 28 deci- 
mal in this record. The remaining two 
bytes of the record (remember that we 
declared the record to be thirty bytes long) 
should be empty; sure enough, they show 
up here as zeros. This gets us to position 
3C, the beginning of the next record, and 
there we find the integer type byte 12, sig- 
naling that we can start the whole proc- 
ess again. I leave that to you if you want 
to try your hand at decoding. Some of 
what we have learned can be summar- 
ized in the following table :

Don't forget that the get# statement 
can be used in lots of other interesting 
ways and that its primary function is to 
process console input effectively without 
those characters being first processed by 
Basic. I just thought the examples above 
would give us a chance to explore sev- 
eral interesting topics at once. 

Final Thoughts (Bottom of the Bag). 
I'd fully intended to explore one more 
topic that had previously generated ques- 
tions, but this tome grows overlong. The 
topic I had in mind was the use of the re- 
quest invokable module. Those of you 
who are writing programs that do lots of 
reading and writing of numeric arrays to 
disk should tune in next time when we 
show how to get at least twenty times the 
performance improvement over using 
for— next loops to accomplish the same 
task. That, combined with the huge 
memory space available for arrays, pro- 
vides some significant capability to the 
person interested in data analysis and so- 
phisticated file indexing. 

I also promise to get to my thesis on 
print tLsing, especially since Business Ba- 
sic allows some tricks not available in 
most other Basics. One of these days 
we'll get to graphics as well, and discuss 
how to use bgraf and download to create 
some really interesting stuff. 

Until then, just one last note. I looked 
back over this article and decided that 
the word hex was mentioned so many 
times that we have left the era of "voo- 
doo economics" and entered a new era of 
"voodoo Basic". Oh well. Maybe if I wore 
garlic while typing .... )l 



ARTSCI explains why some 
word processing systems 
are better than others. 



Let's begin with an easy to understand explanation of what a word 
processor is and how ARTSCI has created a professional system. 



A word processing system is simply 
an easier, faster and less expensive way 
to type. With a modern word 
processor, documents are entered on a 
video screen instead of paper. 

You can enter your first rough draft 
without concern about errors or 
spelling. Simply go back and insert 
letters, delete words and even move 
paragraphs with a few keystrokes. No 
document will ever have to be retyped. 

WORD PROCESSING 
AND THE APPLE II 

The APPLE II is the most 
expandable, inexpensive micro- 
computer available today. It can 
perform almost any task, including 
word processing. 

The standard APPLE II however, 
uses a 40 column video display. This 
display causes a serious word 
processing problem: How do you 
display a full sized 80 column letter? 
Most word processing programs 
available today do not solve this 
problem. 




THE MAGIC WINDOW 

ARTSCI has developed the MAGIC 
WINDOW word processing system 
that incorporates the full power of a 
professional word processor and solves 
the APPLE'S display problem without 
expensive hardware. 

The first feature of a professional 
word processing system is the ability to 
enter and edit data in a fast and 
friendly manner. The MAGIC 
WINDOW operates just like a 
standard typewriter. The electronic 
paper moves to the left across the 
video screen as you type. Almost any 
size document can be represented on 
the video screen. You can see the edges 



of the paper through this MAGIC 
WINDOW as you typ 

The rule is: What 
you see on the screen 
is what you'll get in 
print. However, 
if you print using 
proportional spacing, 
the result will look even 
better than the screen. 



This typewriter simulation, together 
with simple to use menu selection of 
functions and electronic editing 
abilities, creates the finest word 
processor available on the standard 
APPLE II. 

MAGIC SPELL 

The second feature of an advanced 
word processor is the ability to find 
and correct mistakes. The most 
common mistakes in most documents 
is the misspelled word. 

ARTSCI's MAGIC SPELL program 
will take any document you can create 
and find spelling errors. Over 14,000 
commonly misspelled words are known 
to MAGIC SPELL. You can also add 
new words to the vocabulary at any 
time.

The third feature of a professional

to alter a document by replacing 
names and other related data from 
mailing lists. 



Form letters, invoices, and almost any 
document can be individualized by 
replacing names, addresses or any 
other personal data anywhere in the 
document using ARTSCI'S BASIC

and print personalized letters with a 
few simple keystrokes.

BV CHRISTOPHER U. LICHT 



Eight years isn't a very long time in most industries. Steel 
mills still lise the same type of blast furnaces they had eight 
years ago. Banks still have tellers to conduct personal trans- 
actions, and these tellers still have long lines at their windows. 
But, as you know, eight years is a couple of generations in the 
computer business. In this field, eight months can produce 
revolutions and eight weeks an awful lot of change. In fact, I 
find that if I don't stop in at my local computer store every 
eight days or so, I may miss a piece of software I need. And I 
know I'll miss a new game my teenage boy would like to try 
out. 

Eight years ago I was hired to design and program a finan- 
cial modeling package for a large bank holding company that 
would help answer the sort of "What if" questions that are now 
so easily analyzed with VisiCalc. Of course I didn't come up 
with a catchy name like VisiCalc (I wish I had) but, with the 
help of a number of the bank's vice presidents, its entire re- 
search department, a dozen keypunch operators, systems ana- 
lysts, computer operators, and innumerable cups of black cof- 
fee, I finally produced the "Southern National Bank" Finan- 
cial Forecasting Model (Version 97.3 or something like that) . 

It was a nightmare. But it ran. And it only took about half 
an hour of my time — generally around midnight — plus maybe 
a quarter of an hour of I.B.M.'s biggest and best number- 
cruncher each time the bank wanted to look at one possible 
policy change, in other words each time we changed the num- 
ber in one cell. 

"Southern Bank Holding Company" (SBHC, for short) was 
the parent holding company that owned the "Southern Nation- 
al Bank" (both names are disguised) . Its top management had 
had a very critical policy decision to make back in 1974. It was 
located in a state that permitted an almost unlimited number 
of bank branches within a bank's home community (the Joke 
was that the state had a bank on every comer that didn't al- 
ready have a gas station) and, using a multibank holding com- 
pany to own other complete banks, allowed banks to expand in- 
to other communities across the state. In 1974 there was a 
branching war in the state with the twenty or so largest banks 
starting new banks, taking over smaller ones in mergers and 
building new branches just as fast as they could to prevent 
their competitors from getting those key comers that didn't al- 
ready have gas stations on them. It was eat or be eaten, and 
the presidents of all but the largest banks, which were busy 
taking over or moving in on the smaller banks, were running 
scared. Later, when OPEC-financed Eurodollars began flood- 
ing in, heads rolled at a few of even the biggest banks as the 
new Saudi and Kuwaiti owners hired their own management 
teams. Perhaps it wasn't the worst of times to be a banker, but 
it certainly wasn't the best. 

In its quest to put one of its own banks in evety town in its re- 
gion of the state and a branch on every vacant comer of that 
town, SBHC had borrowed several millions of dollars from one 
of the giants of the banking Industry, dollars which it was using 
as capital to start up its new banks and branches. Interest on 
this loan had to be paid each year, and the loan itself wajs to be 



repaid, presumably out of the profits of the new banks, at the 
end of ten years. 

The bank's announced goal was to start or acquire by merg- 
er three complete banks a year and about as many branches 
as it could find vacant lots to put them on. Its board of direc- 
tors approved, and its stockholders wanted the growth. But a 
brand new bank is an expensive business to create — costing in 
the millions — and even a new branch can require an invest- 
ment in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Furthermore, 
banking is a business that is tightly regulated by the federal 
and state govemments. Because no one wants to chance 
another banking system collapse like the one that triggered the 
Great Depression of the 1930s, the government makes sure that 
banks aren't allowed to take risks so great that they might go 
under— taking their depositors' money with them. 

And so, each time that SBHC would apply to the Federal 
Reserve System for a permit to start another bank, which it 
was then doing every few months, the Fed would ask, "How 
will you pay back that multimillion dollar loan?" And SBHC 
would reply, "Out of the profits from these new banks." For a 
while the Fed went along with this off-the-cuff forecast. Then, 
when SBHC had seven banks and a few nonbanking financial 
service companies, the Fed demanded a closer look. Knowing 
that new banks, like any other businesses, take time to build up 
a list of customers and simply won't be profitable overnight, 
the Fed responded to the application for the eighth bank by say- 
ing, in effect, "You have a very large loan that must be paid 
back in ten years, and we know that you will be in very serious 
trouble if you can't pay It back then. Give us detailed forecasts 
showing how your entire holding company complex will gen- 
erate enough profits to pay back that loan. Because you have a 
ten-year loan, you must give us a ten-year forecast; in addi- 
tion, we win need to see how you can generate sufficient de- 
posits and make enough profitable loans not only at the parent 
company level, but for each separate bank that you own." 
In other words, somebody at the Fed had realized from SBHC's 
financial statements that it was expanding so fast that it might 
run out of money before the new profits came in, and wanted 
someone on the bank to do all the "What if" analysis neces- 
sary to show Just how many new banks and branches could be 
added a year without spending the company into bankruptcy. 

Today, the cry would go out, "VisiCalc to the Rescue," and a 
member of the bank's research department would tum to his 
Apple and begin asking those questions. But only eight years 
ago not only was there no VisiCalc, but Apples still grew on 
trees. Instead SBHC had to hire someone to design a VisiCalc- 
type of program that would run on the large, mainframe 
I.B.M. equipment it used for its own accounting. The choice 
was very clear: either hire a consultant to design a financial 
planning model at the bank's own expense or stop expanding. 

It was a cushy assignment. I was given an office in the 
bank's tower with a view overlooking half the city, an office 
that had Just been vacated by one of the bank's directors. I re- 
ported directly to the parent company's executive vice presi- 
dent. I was given all the secretarial support I needed and, be-

lieve it or not, unlimited computer time. Today, when you can 
buy a fully equipped computer for your exclusive use for less 
than half the cost of a plain- Jane automobile, this last may not 
seem like much. But, back in the mid-1970s, unlimited com- 
puter time, which was billed out at a rate as high as $600 per 
hour, was something you might aspire to as your reward In 
heaven after an absolutely sin-free life. And, best of all, SBHC 
agreed to give me a two-month training program in top level 
bank management. I had been educated in model building and 
financial theory but knew almost nothing about banking, and 
the knowledge I gained has proved invaluable both in business 
and in the classroom. There was, of course, a deadline: six 
months. At the time it seemed more than ample, and it did tvim 
out to be Just adequate. I've often wondered how long it took 
the designers of VisiCalc to come up with their package, which 
is much more complex and versatile. 

The training program consisted of moving from depart- 
ment to department observing how a large bank operates and, 
especially, meeting the people who had the information I 
would later need. I spent three days with the controller, per- 
haps four with the research staff, a coffee break with the presi- 
dent, a week in the computer center, and so on. In the evenings 
I read textbooks on bank accounting methods. The time went 
fast. At the end I didn't know enough to be able to run a bank, 
but I knew who to go to to ask how one should be run. And it 
was knowledge I needed. The hardest part of forecasting isn't 
figuring which equations to use to connect the cells in a Visi- 
Calc worksheet. It's in the numbers that go into those equa- 
tions. And the best source of some of those numbers will be the 
very executives responsible for them, but they'll give you 
honest estimates only after they've come to know and trust 
you. 

So, with four months to go, it was time to begin building a 
model. One of the first steps, as is true even if you already have 
a VisiCalc and don't have to create your own from scratch, is 
to formulate very clearly the questions you want the model to 
answer and to pin down the sources of the data you will plug in- 



to your model, because the form of the model itself depends 
critically on these. 

For example, suppose I were a complete outsider with no 
access to inside information, hired to answer the question, 
"Should I buy stock in SBHC?" Instead of estimating how 
much cash newly formed subsidiary banks will throw off over 
the next ten years, what I would like to do would be to forecast 
the stock price for my client.' I can't forecast stock prices (and 
no other forecaster who's honest with himself will claim he can 
either) . So I would suggest that we might try aj9 a proxy ques- 
tion, "What are SBHC's earnings likely to be over the next dec- 
ade?" If we can talk to management and find out its plans, 
great. If we can't, one approach that I might suggest would be 
to look at the overall economic outlook and try to relate this 
company's performance to it. Depending on how much my 
client wanted to spend on the forecast, that is, how much he 
could gain from it, such an approach could Involve anything up 
to multi-equation econometric models of the global, national, 
and state economies or at least the use of those that were al- 
ready available. 

Clearly SBHC's cost and time constraints precluded the 
econometric approach. Besides, it would be like using a 
howitzer to kill a fly on the wall of your house ; after the dust 
has cleared, all you can see is a fly buzzing around trying to de- 
cide which piece of rubble to land on. Clearly, too, a simula- 
tion model was the answer, and VisiCalc-type models shine in 
situations like the one I was in, where I could go to a particular 
vice president and say, "Let's sit down and figure out what 
number I should use for this year's home mortgage loans, and 
what rate of increase I should assume each year hereafter." 

The only question was whether or not to make the model 
"stochastic," that is, whether or not we ought to allow for fu- 
ture uncertainty (and there's a whale of a lot of It when you're 
trying to go out ten years) by incorporating probability distri- 
butions for key variables or not. For example, we might be- 
lieve that the interest rate on automobile loans, currently 18 
percent a year, has a 50 percent probability of remednlng un-

changed next year, a 10 percent probability of going to 20 per- 
cent, and a 40 percent chance of falling to 15 percent. We then 
roll the dice or consult a random number table to determine 
which figure to put into the model, the idea being that if we run 
the model many times under different assumed conditions, we 
will have used the correct interest rate on the average. 

It's called Monte Carlo simulation, after the famous Euro- 
pean gambling casino, and business schools love to teach it. 
It's also one of the reasons that Applesoft and the other ver- 
sions of Basic have the md function; if you're doing Monte Car- 
lo simulation, you can generate all the random numbers you 
need inside your program. The problem is that you must come 
up with a probability distribution for each of the significant 
variables; you must be able to say, for example, that there is a 
20 percent probability that X will happen, a 40 percent proba- 
bility that Y will happen, a 10 percent probability that it will be 
Z, and a 30 percent chance that what happens will be some- 
thing entirely different. 

My two-month training program had taught me that there 
was no way I could reliably estimate the probability distribu- 
tions governing future interest rates, growth rates of the com- 
munity, tellers' wages, the bank president's salary, and so on. 
In fact, a couple of years later I attended a seminar in Monte 
Carlo simulation. After the main speaker had spent half a day 
showing how to build a model, I asked him how he comes up 
with the actual probability distributions he needs whenever he 
wants to use his model on a real world problem. He smiled and 
said, "Oh, I leave that to my graduate students." 

So, with my boss's approval, I decided to design a simple 
"What if" model in which we would insert figures that com- 
mon sense said were reasonable. By varying them and running 
the model again and again, we reasoned, we could see which 
management decisions would be the most sensitive in terms of 
profits and cash available to repay that loan. Then we could ex- 
amine more closely the assumptions behind the more sensi- 
tive decisions and, just using experience and Judgment, have a 
pretty good idea of which runs of the model were likely to be 



the most realistic. It's a tried and true method that often gives 
as good results as the most sophisticated models, and it's in- 
teresting to note that, despite its theoretical usefulness and the 
love that professors of business have for it, the designers of 
VisiCalc also chose to eschew the Monte Carlo method. I am 
siire that it would have been possible to include the md(x) 
function in the list of VisiCalc functions, although at the cost of 
some memory, but it must not have seemed worth It. I think I 
would have made the same decision. 

Another key consideration in the choice of model is the com- 
puter it's going to run on. Just imagine VisiCalc on a 4K ma- 
chine. That didn't seem to be a problem in the bank's case, al- 
though it turned out to be one. The bank's computer center had 
three I.B.M. 360s, two model 50s and one model 40, and each 
had 256K of internal memory plus disk drives, tap>e drives, 
and, of course, those 132-column printers that gobble up a cou- 
ple of reams of green-striped paper an hour. All input would 
have to be on cards punched laboriously on I.B.M. keypunch- 
es, but that also didn't seem like a burden at the time. Eight 
years ago I still thought the only use for a TV screen was to 
watch reruns of "Bonanza." The only on-line systems I'd ever 
seen produced teletype output printed on newsprint with 
Samuel F. B. Morse's own original ink ribbon. 

The hardware available seemed fine. Then came the ques- 
tion of which language to use. The bank's computer program- 
ers only knew Cobol, which is the language typically used for 
accounting. I only knew Fortran, both Versions n and IV, and 
a variant called Watfiv. Because the final printouts had to go to 
top executives and the board of directors, they had to be neat, 
organized reports with proper labels for each row and column. 
That constraint suggested using Cobol. My boss thought for 
maybe three seconds about keeping me on the payroll while I 
learned that language, and said, "We'll do it in Fortran, even 
though there won't be anybody who can help you." 

I said that would be fine ; it was only later that I realized 
just how much I had previously depended for help on having 
colleagues around me whose Fortran w£is better than mine. In 
its handling of mathematics, Fortran is very much like Basic, 
which was modeled on the older langfuage. It uses the same 
arithmetic operators except that exponentiation is *♦ instead of 
the upward arrow. Its commands to print labels are complex 
in Version n, but not too dissimilar to Basic in Version IV. It 
cannot handle strings, but, lonllke Applesoft, it allows its user 
to place his output anjrwhere on the page he wants, and it is this 
ability that allows one to produce good-looking business re- 
ports even though the language was designed for scientific 
analysis. 

Fortran has a format statement that allows the program- 
mer to take the entire 132 columns of I.B.M. 's printers and 
treat them as anything from a single field of 132 columns to 132 
fields of one column each. I wish I could do this with Applesoft. 
The statement goes like this, for example: 

10 FORMAT 13, 2X, 5(F4.2, 2X) 

WRITE (3) 10, X, Y, (Z(l), I = 1, 5) 

This means print on printer number 3 the values of X, Y and 
Z(l) through Z(5) in the format shown in statement 10. This 
format is: an integer of three columns (13), two blank spaces 
(2X) and five identical fields consisting of a four-column float- 
ing point number followed by two spaces (6(F4.2,2X)) ; the fig- 
ure 4.2 means a number using four columns in total including 
the decimal point and rounded to two places after the decimal 
point — 1.23. Labels can be Included In the format statement In 
quotes, as they are in Applesoft. 

it's a cumbersome system at best and is very hard to learn 
because a misplaced comma In a Fortran statement will cause 
a syntax error, and It might take many tries before a program 
will produce any output at all. Nevertheless, it does allow pro- 
fessional-appearing reports, which I wish I could do with Ba- 
sic. VisiCalc, of course, provides menu-driven control of its for- 
mat, which is easiest of all. 

The error message caused by a misplaced comma might 
take five or ten minutes to figure out. In I.B.M.'s Fortran, the

TASC The Applesoft Compiler. 
II turns your Apple into 
a power tool. 



Step up to speed. TASC, the Applesoft Compiler, 
converts a standard Applesoft BASIC progrann 
into super-fast nnachine code. By 
increasing program execution speed 
up to 20 times, Microsoft gives 
you a power tool for Applesoft 
BASIC programming. 
Highest capacity available. 
TASC will compile and run 
larger programs than any 
other Applesoft Compiler. As a 
disk-based system, it doesn't 
require the simultaneous pres- 
ence of compiler and program 
in memory. The memory you save 
allows you to compile significantly 
bigger programs. 

Power without bulk. Code expansion of up to 100% 
severely restricts other compilers. TASC's special 
code compression schemes typically limit code 
expansion to only 25%. You'll really appreciate that 
with complex programs or programs that utilize 
Apple's hi-res graphic pages. 
More BASIC power. TASC's powerful new 
commands increase Applesoft BASIC programming 
capability. Chain with COMMON allows compiled 
programs to share variables, so a main menu

supports several programs in a 
single runtime environment. 
TASC's True Integer Arithmetic 
and Integer FOR... NEXT 
capabilities maximize the execu- 
tion speed of compiled programs. 
TASC's near total compatibility 

with Applesoft speeds compil- 
ation of existing programs 
with little or no modification. 
What about mistakes? You 
perfect your programs Inter- 
actively with Applesoft. If some- 
thing does slip by TASC recovers 
from errors discovered in compilation 
and traps all runtime errors. It even permits 
graceful interruptions during compilation.

message would look something like, "IT332." You would then 
go to I.B.M.'s error message manual, which is about the size of 
a medium-sized city's phone book, look up the error message 
code and find it translated as "Syntax Error." There is a won- 
derful dialect of Fortran called Watfiv that makes program 
debugging almost a Joy. Instead of printing SYNTAX ERROR 
and refusing to run, it lists all the lines in which errors occur 
and puts a symbol over the error itself. Unfortunately, SBHC's 
computer center didn't have a Watfiv compiler. Even more 
unfortunately, one hasn't been developed for Applesoft. 
Wouldn't it be loverly. . . ? 

My daughter was recently in my office doing her high 
school computer course assignment on my Apple. She just sat 
at the desk and typed out a forty or fifty line program from 
some notes she had made, flipped on the printer, listed it, ran 
it, and printed it all at once. I said, "Don't you want to run it 
every few lines to check for errors?" She replied, "Dad, I don't 
make errors." She was right. It ran correctly the first time. 
But you can't do that in Fortran. 

In addition, as I mentioned, Fortran was designed when 
TVs were black and white instead of green and carried mostly 
reruns of "Bonanza." Since a user couldn't interact directly 
with a computer anyway, there was no need for instant con- 
version of Fortran code into machine language. So, instead of 
interpreting a program line into machine language and run- 
ning it immediately, all Fortran programs have to be com- 
piled first. Aa those of you who have seen the ads for the new 
Applesoft compilers know, a compiled program runs at sever- 
al times the speed of one that has to be converted line by line as 
it's running. But they're terrible to debug because you must 
compile, correct the first error, recompile, correct the second 
error, compile again, and so on. 

Also the batch processing on an I.B.M. 360 requires cum- 
bersome control cards for the input of instructions that are 
simply automatic on an Apple. To begin with, if the previous 
program failed to contain an End Of Job card (I beUeve the

symbol was /■") , the computer would treat your program ais 
part of that one, and both would bomb. To ensure against that, 
some of us would stick a handful of End Of Job cards at the be- 
ginning of our programs and let the accountants worry later 
about the number of jobs that had actually run. Instead of just 
turning on a switch, we had to have as our first card a Job card 
that handled the accounting and contained our name, account 
number, and some authorization code that told the computer 
we had permission to use it. Instead of having Applesoft ready 
and waiting when that switch was turned on, we had to put in 
another control card that told the 360 to load its Fortran com- 
piler (usually from disk or tape, although one installation that I 
used kept its language compilers on cards — one "fold, spindle 
or mutilate" and your entire system is down). The next card 
contained the instructions to load the program. Then we in- 
serted the deck of cards containing the program. This was fol- 
lowed by another card that announced that the next cards 
would be data cards followed by a data deck. Somewhere or 
other there would be a control card telling the computer to run 
the program it had compiled. These control cards, which had 
to be absolutely correct in each column, looked something like 
//FORTG.GO,EXECFORT, or whatever. Unfortunately, the 
control codes vary from computer center to computer center 
depending on what version of DOS is being used. I long ago 
bought an Apple and burned my I.B.M. 360 manuals and don't 
remember exactly what the codes were, but you get the point. 
We didn't just type "RUN HELLO" and have everything hap- 
pen magically. 

So, using what was then the workhorse, mainframe com- 
puter of the world, I was ready to begin developing for the 
Southern BaJik Holding Company its very own "VisiCalc." It 
seemed like a piece of cake. I was young and naive. 

A typical day began when I got to my office in the tower 
about 8:30 or 9 a.m., spent a minute or two admiring the view 
and then turned to the SBHC's internal management reports. 
While a theoretically elegant forecasting system can be de- 
signed from scratch, it's simpler to use one that was built 
around the type of data it will have to use. So, working alter- 
nately with a Hewlett-Packard HP-80 calculator to get a rough 
idea of what the results might be like and some Fortran coding 
forms I had brought from home, I began working on the indi- 
vidual bank portion of the model. To save memory, it was de- 
cided early to do only one subprogram for all banks. This 
would read the data for Bank 1, perform the calculations, print 
it, sum it with the other banks in an accumulator and go on to 
Bank 2, and so forth. Because I had two spare columns on a 
key data card, the program could handle ninety-nine banks. If 
there had been only one column available, it would have been 
limited to nine. 

After a week or so, I decided I'd better see whether or not 
what I had written would run. I made the first of what would 
turn out to be perhaps one hundred trips to SBHC's computer 
center out in the suburbs and handed my coding sheets to a 
keypunch operator who had been assigned to help me. The first 
thing I discovered was that the slash, /, goes through the zero, 
not through the letter O. I had come from a university re- 
search environment, where the computer center had to handle 
tremendous amounts of numerical data and very little alpha- 
betical. To avoid writing a slash through one out of every ten 
characters, everyone there was taught that the letter got the 
slash. Well, a statement number that has the letter O in It 
bombs the program in Fortran Just as it does in Applesoft, and 
when you're using batch processing with cards, you don't even 
get that message, "IT332," or "SYNTAX ERROR," or 
"TILT," or whatever your machine uses, until the next day. 

The next day, still cheerful, my keypunch operator had to 
repunch every card she'd done for me the day before. She 
didn't complain the first time, or the second, or even the third. 
Then I ran out of the coding forms I had saved since my college 
days and discovered that SBHC had none. That was OK; I of- 
ten used ordinary notebook paper anyway. Unfortunately my 
keypunch operator didn't know that each I.B.M. Fortran card 
must have the statement number in columns one through five.

must reserve column six for a "C" (Comment = rem) , if any, 
and can't have the statement's command begin until column 
seven. So she redid all the cards again the next day. 

Neither she nor the other keypunch operators ever com- 
plained to me about the strange coding they were handling and 
about the corrections that they would have to make the next 
morning because the 360 had discovered, for example, an odd 
number of parentheses. But after a while I realized that, when 
I needed some work done, the supervisor of the keypvinch de- 
partment was letting it sit on her desk until she had some free 
time and was then doing it herself. I got the message and be- 
gan punching the corrections myself. 

The next problem took a couple of weeks to solve. Fortran 
n and Fortran IV are different versions of the same language 
and require different compilers. Fortran IV is the more ad- 
vanced and has the Boolean if tests— greater than, less than, or 
equal to— that we're used to in Applesoft. It also allowed la- 
bels to be printed by putting quote marks aroiond them. 
Version II accomplishes these by some very roundabout 
means. Because I'd been told that SBHC's compiler was Ver- 
sion IV, I had used both the simplified labeling system and 
some Boolean operators. My program bombed. 

The people at the computer center kept assuring me that I 
was indeed using Fortran IV, but my program kept bombing. I 
then wrote a couple of very short and essentially identical pro- 
grams, one in Version II and one in IV. The first ran, but not 
the second. I shook in fear at the thought of having to eusk the 
keypunch operators to repunch everything again, and de- 
cided, since all else had failed, to read the instructions. Unfor- 
tunately SBHC's computer center had no I.B.M. Fortran man- 
uals. The local I.B.M. office ordered some, which arrived a 
week or so later. After only a day and a half or so of trying to 
read something written by a computer engineer, I realized the 
problem. There are two (at least) versions of Fortran IV. the 
complete version is available for systems using I.B.M. 's oper- 
ating system, OS. Under DOS, the disk operating system used 



by SBHC, only a truncated version of Fortran IV, without the 
Boolean operations, was available. Fortunately it did use quote 
marks for printing labels, so I only had to retype a few lines. 
But I had lost a couple of weeks. 

The next major problem came when my program exceed- 
ed the 360's memory — 256K. I was incredulous and spent a day 
trying to find where the program was attempting to divide by 
zero and producing such a large number that it overflowed 
memory. Fortran will do that. I couldn't find it. Then I dis- 
covered that Fortran is very inefficient in its storage of words 
and other nonnumerical symbols. So, "Automobile Loans" 
became "Auto Loans." As the model grew, this problem hap- 
pened time and time again. At first I abbreviated labels. Later 
I had to go through and consolidate groups of lines: "Instal- 
ment Loans" for the combined automobile, home mortgage, 
and personal loans, and so on. This required renaming many of 
the variables and being very careful to make sure that any 
which were no longer used were erased everywhere. 

So it went, and the weeks passed. When we had perhaps six 
weeks to go, I began spending my evenings at the computer 
center. I had found that short jobs were processed from about 3 
p.m. to midnight, when the bank's large accounting nm would 
tie up all the equipment for the rest of the night. If I simply 
stayed there and kept making corrections and resubmitting 
the job, I could sometimes run it four or five times in an eve- 
ning, each time adding a few lines. The computer center had 
vending machines: horrible coffee and worse sandwiches, but 
the lunch room at least gave me a comfortable chair to wait in. 

And so it went. Each day the model got a little longer and a 
little closer to mirroring reality. I don't remember how big it 
was finally. The worksheet had ten columns of figures be- 
cause ten years were needed, with everything rounded to the 
nearest million dollars, plus a label column. There must have 
been somewhere between one hundred and one hundred fifty 
rows in the worksheet Itself (about seven hundred or eight 
hundred in the final printout because the program successive-

ly loaded, saved, and reloaded data into the worksheet as need- 
ed). Whatever the final number of cells, they strained the 
capacity of what was at the time the biggest I.B.M. machine in 
general usage, a machine that still cost in the neighborhood of 
a million bucks. The truly giant number-cruncher, the 370, was 
out, but was still very rare. 

Anjrway, summer was over, the leaves were turning, and 
the computer center's coffee was even begining to taste famil- 
iar. The model was done, and it was time to use it. Most of the 
data had been worked out simultaneously with the model it- 
self, so it was already in useable form. The first run simply 
examined where SBHC might find itself if nothing changed. 
The next run answered one of the many "What if" questions 
my boss wanted asked. All that was necessary was changing 
the numbers in one cell, Just as with VisiCalc. 

Unfortunately, this couldn't be done at a keyboard. Some- 
body (me, since no one else had any idea how the model opera- 
ted) had to take a deck of cards that was now a couple of feet 
thick, remove one card (they were numbered), repunch that 
card with one digit changed and no errors made in the col- 
umns that were to remain the same, reinsert the card at exact- 
ly the right place in the deck and resubmit the deck to the com- 
puter operator. I had a couple of back-up decks, but the key- 
punch operated by the computer itself, which had copied the 
original deck, couldn't also type at the top of the cards what 
was on them, so I couldn't tell which card weus which in the 
duplicate decks. I was very careful with the original deck. 

And I was lucky. The card reader never chewed up more 
than a few cards at a time. No one dropped the deck without its 
rubber bands. And only once did the person in whose locked 
filing cabinet it was stored go on vacation for two weeks. 

Finally the big day arrived. My boss and I picked what 
seemed to be the six most representative runs and presented 
them to the chairman of the board to show him his options, and 
he presented his report to the full board itself. I collected my 
check and moved away from that office with a great view to a 
higher office in the tower of another building in another city. It 



had been a good assignment, and I'd learned a lot. But, in 
retrospect, I admit that an Apple with VisiCalc would have 
saved the SBHC an awful lot of time and money. 

If VisiCalc and Apples had been invented eight years ago, I 
wouldn't have been hired for this job, of course. For a fraction 
of the cost of training me in banking, the SBHC could have pvir- 
chased its 48K Apple, two disk drives, a monitor, VisiCalc, and 
a daisy wheel printer, given a member of the research depart- 
ment time to learn how to use the equipment (a fine invest- 
ment anyway) and, within a couple of months, have had its re- 
port. As I said at the beginning, eight years is long enough for a 
couple of generations in the microcomputer business. 

And did the SBHC act on the recommendations of the mod- 
el? Yes it did. No matter what assumptions we made, the mod- 
el showed that the holding company simply could not expand 
at anything like the rate it was going and also repay that mul- 
timillion dollar loan at the end of ten years. In fact, the most 
likely assumptions showed that in only two or three years, the 
holding company would have to borrow many more millions 
instead of paying back what it had already borrowed. It was 
simply growing faster than it could afford to grow. 

So, as much as it pained the SBHC's top management to 
stop gfrowing, the holding company decided it had to stop for a 
while. It cancelled its applications for all its new banks and 
most of its new branches and planned to g^row slowly from its 
profits. It also voluntarily reduced the assets it then had by 
three percent and saw profits rise by ten percent. 

I don't like ten year forecasts. That's just too far out. But 
three years after my assignment was finished, I compared the 
data in that year's annual report with the "What if" forecast 
that had been based on the company following the recommen- 
dation it did, in fact, follow. It was gratifying. The forecasts of 
the two key variables, earnings, and ability to repay the loan, 
were off by only about one percent. That was just chance, of 
course. That margin was too close to claim credit for. But still 
it was gratifying. VisiCalc couldn't have done any better. But it 
certainly would have been faster and less painful.

contemplating 

a byte 



For one full year, many of you have been wondering how long we would con- 
tinue sending you So/talk free without trying to put the touch on you for some- 
thing, whether a subscription, software, peripherals, kidney beans, defective 
grommets, or spare Edsel parts. Now comes the magic moment. 

Sr)ft(ilk commissioned graphics artist Robert Zraick to do August's cover 
with a poster in mind. The robot contemplating a bite is evocative both of Ro- 
din's The Thiytker and the Genesis passage on the Garden of Eden ... not to 
mention the possible significance to our favorite technological fruit. 

The artist and Saftdlk are sharing in the profits from the poster. Si>ftiilk will 
distribute its proceeds to individuals developing Apple tools to help the handi- 
capped. Sdftiilk guarantees 100 percent distribution of its monies. 

In addition to the posters, which are being sold at $6.00, (plus $1.50 to cover 
shipping and handling), two hundred artist's proofs, signed by Robert Zraick, 
are available at $75 each. 

The size of the poster is 24 inches by 34 inches. The artist's proof will be hand- 
numbered and hand-signed and be accompanied by a certificate giving its num- 
ber and guaranteeing that only 200 are being distributed. 

Robert Zraick's art will grace any computer room, and your purchase will 
help others become more self-sufficient.

The results of Christmas marketing were felt in Novem- 
ber's software sales figures, but the results were not at all 
what might be expected. 

VisiCalc remained the leading program in the Apple mar- 
ket, but the distance between it and second-place DB Master is 
beginning to close. Many more retailers are now reporting 
that, as they do with VisiCalc, they're selling a DB Mobster with 
every business system out the door. The fact of DB Master's 
maining in second position indicates the continuing matura-

tion of the market toward business applications. 

One could almost draw the same conclusion from the third- 
place finisher, Personal Filing System; but it, Olympic 
Decathlon, and Personal Finance Manager all benefitted from 
a different phenomenon. All were packaged in Apple's special 
Family Plan package that was merchandised in the final two 
months of 1981. 

Instead of cutting into the individual purchase of the pro- 
grams included, the Family Plan actually fueled sales because 
the programs were being aggressively marketed as part of the 
package deal. 

PFS jumped from thirteenth to third. Personal Finance 
Manager leaped to seventh from twenty-fifth, and Olympic 
Decathlon rose to tenth from twenty-seventh. 

There were special circumstances behind the fourth-place 
finish of Gorgon as well. Many retailers had been unable to get 
the product in late October and early November. Rumors that 



it might be removed from the marketplace because of licens- 
ing difficulties heated demand to the point where it was the hot- 
test selling individual package in the last week of November. 

This poll probably marks the last mention of Snoggle, 
twelfth in November, which was removed from the market- 
place because of a licensing difficulty. 

The only program that made the jump from off the Top 
Thirty into the top ten was VisiFile, Personal Software's new

data base program. Its presence in the top ten along with DB 
Master and PFS Is further indication that uses outside of en- 
tertainment are becoming more prevalent for the Apple. 

Other software packages making the Top Thirty for the 
first time were Word Star, the CP/M-based word processor 
that runs on the Apple in conjunction with Microsoft's Soft- 
Card; Snack Attack, which was the highest ranked new game ; 
Threshold; Superscribe 11; and Bug Attack. In addition, BPI 
General Ledger regained the Top Thirty. 

The Strategy 5 entertainment list was exactly the same as 
in October, but the Fantasy 5 list underwent wholesale revi- 
sions. Wizardry knocked off Ultima for first place. Crush, 
Crumble and Chomp regained the list. Sword Thrust master 
disk from CE Software made the list for the first time and Al- 
kemstone dropped to fifth from fourth. 

Ken Williams shared in each of the top three programs in 
the Adventure 5 list. He had Cranston Manor with Harold De- 
Witz, Ulysses and the Golden Fleece with Bob Davis, and The 
Wizard and the Princess with wife Roberta. Ulysses was a new 
entry as were fourth and fifth placers, Zork II and Cyborg. 

The Word Processor 5 list remains an interesting one. 



Apple-franchlsed retail stores representing approximately 9.7 percent of 
all sales of Apples and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in 
the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early In December to ascertain their sales 
leaders for the month of November. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was number of sales made — 
such other criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer 
retailer, and personal preference of the Individual respondents were not 
considered. 

Respondents in December represented every geog^raphical area of the 
continental United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in 
the Index number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. 
The index number is an arbitrary measure of relative strength of the 
programs listed. Index numbers are correlative only for the month in which 
they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index rating of 80 in one 
month represents equivalent sales to an Index number of 60 in another 
month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus-or-mlnus 4.1 percent, which trans- 
lates roughly into the theoretical possibility of a change of 2.89 points, plus or 
minus, in any index number.

Apple Writer maintained first with Word Star Jumping to sec- 
ond. Superscribe II rising to third. Magic Window dropping to 
fourth, and Easy Writer dropping to fifth. 

However, Supertext II and Letter Perfect were in a virtual 
tie with Easy Writer for fifth. In addition, the November poll 
unearthed the first mention of any software for the Apple III — 
Word Juggler from Quark. 

Most of the entries in the Home 10 list remained the same, 
although there was considerable shifting of order, with Per- 
sonal Finance Manager not only overtaking Home Money 
Minder for first in home finance packages but also leading all 
home packages in November. 

New Home 10 entries were Mastertype from Lightning Sj^sft- 
ware and Real Estate Analyzer from Howardsoft. 

The Hobby 10 underwent considerable revision. Beagle 
Brothers put two programs on the list: DOS Boss and Utility 
City. SubLogic's A2-3D1 Graphics Package, fueled by the re- 
quirement to have it in order to run Saturn Navigator, became 
the leading graphics pacji^ge. LISA, Randy Hyde's assem- 
bler, rejoined the list from a new publisher. Fortran 80 
squeaked into the last position, another evidence of the vari- 
ous uses to which the Apple is put. 

The only new entry in the Business 10 category is a notable 
one. Accounting Plus II General Ledger from Systems Plus ap- 
pears ready to make a real run at BPI. Interest and sales of the 
product have been growing each month. 

The microcomputer market in general appears to be un- 
reasonably healthy in the face of the nationwide recession. 
IBM and Osborne are back-ordered and neither appear to have 
made a significant impact on Apple sales. HI

THE 

GENERAL MANAGER 

THE SHORT CUT TO YOUR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT NEEDS 




• Easy to use— Simply design the screens you wish to use for data entry. Your 
database is created automatically. 



• Information may be retrieved such as: list all customers who owe over 
$1,000 with an invoice over 30 days old or who owe over $10,000 dollars. 



• APPLESOFT interface provides complete access to your information and 
allows you to tailor THE GENERAL MANAGER to YOUR needs. 

• Selected fields from selected records can be written to a standard text file. 



• Expand your database at any time with no loss of existing data. 

• Easy to use reporting capability provides automatic formatting and totals. 

• Easily sort the entire database or selected portions for reporting. 

• Full range of calculation capabilities including logical operations. 

• Your database can span over one hundred disketts using one to four drives 
or a hard disk. 

• Complete tutorial and reference manual. 



Some database programs let you perform calculations so you can 
easily handle economic projections, sales forecasting, and cost 
accounting. Other database programs give you a wide range of 
search and selection options so you can find the information you 
need to make daily decisions. Still others format the screen for 
easy data entry so anyone can use the database. But now, one 
database program PUTS IT ALL TOGETHER. 

THE GENERAL MANAGER is designed after large mainframe 
database management programs. The hierarchial structure allows 
up to sixteen unique record formats which interrelate to form the 
total database. You design the screens the way you want them 
and then fill them in. It's just like working with a set of blank 
forms. Information from one screen can be automatically used in 
other screens. Any fields can be used in complex calculations to 
figure costs, interest, payment terms, discount rates, recipe 
proportions, and many more applications. The data built on one 
screen may easily be used to make comparisons or build totals on 
another screen. 

THE GENERAL MANAGER provides easy-to-use APPLESOFT 
interface using the ampersand command which allows user 
programs to read, write, update and delete database records. 
Uses for this interface are limited only by your imagination. In 
addition, using your selection criteria, THE GENERAL MANAGER 
can write selected fields of selected records to a standard DOS 
text file to be used by word processors or other existing 
programs. 

Visa, MasterCard, Check, COD 



With THE GENERAL MANAGER you are never stuck with your 
original database format. You may change the length and type of 
fields, add and delete fields and add entirely new screens at any 
time with no loss of existing data. As your needs change The 
GENERAL MANAGER will change with you. The unique access 
method of The GENERAL MANAGER allows your database to 
span over 100 diskettes using from one to four disk drives or a 
hard disk while at the same time using the minimum amount of 
disk storage to store your data. The GENERAL MANAGER has 
the flexibility to handle a recipe file or an entire business system. 

A complete tutorial and reference manual leads you through the 
many uses of The GENERAL MANAGER and presents a number 
of solid applications. 

THE GENERAL MANAGER is designed to work FOR you. You 
mold it to your operation and it gives you the information you 
need, when you need it, in just about any format you want it. 

THE GENERAL MANAGER, a database management program 
that finally BRINGS IT ALL TOGETHER for only $99.95 

THE GENERAL MANAGER runs on any 48K Apple II or II Plus with single or 
multiple disk drives and is available at your local computer store or order direct by 
sending $99.95 plus $1.00 to cover shipping and handling to . . .
