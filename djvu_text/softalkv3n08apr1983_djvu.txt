DOST TAKE CHANCES WITH TAXES! Thousands of tax 
professionals have used our "Tax Preparer" in the past 
and have made it #J in tax software. But we have con- 
tinually improved the software in response to their 
"wants" so that NOW it is the most time-saving and 
error -eliminating tool that any tax preparer could ever 
own. And it is so fool-proof that even the total novice can 
now prepare tax returns. 

TRULY AUTOMATED TAX RETURN PREPARATION. 
With low-cost updates as the tax laws change, year-long 
record-keeping for itemized lists, year-to-year data trans- 
fer, instant error-correcting, over 20 forms and sched- 
ules built-in, and some state supplements available too, ■ 
it is the only professional package available at a reason- 
able price. And most important of all it can be TRL'STED 
to produce accurate results in a format that is accepted 
by the I.R.S., because tax-related software is our only 
business and we take it seriously.

CONTEST: Forty 
Thousand Words 



Line up, troops! All you whiners who com- 
plained that our last few contests were just too 

hard, get down here in front and listen up. Lim- 
ericks too tough for you, eh? Puns and ana- 
grams too tricky? Well, this month we're get- 
ting away from all the stuff that's supposed to 
be good for the mind and stimulate the intellect. 

April's contest is pure fun for fun's sake. If 
you haven't already taken a peek at the pic- 
tures on this page and on page 4, do so now and 
report back when you're finished. What you see 
there is a whole mess of cute little drawings 
created and compiled by a bleary-eyed art de- 
partment. They're all a combination of rebuses 
(riddles in pictures), puns (the worse they are, 
the better they are), and charades (sounds 
like . . .). 

Your job, faithful ones, is to take a good 
square look at the pictures and figure out what 
the heck they're trying to say. And whoever is in 











the back moaning, "It's too hard; I can't do re- 
buses; give us an easier one; my brain hurts," sit 
down, clam up, and read on. 

The big clue to all this party-time action is 
that each picture represents an Apple-related 
company or product. For example, if we had a 
picture of some unlucky sap being chased by a 
squad of attacking sandwiches, potato chips, 
and popcorn, you'd know without a doubt that 
it's Snack Attack. 

Or if we had a picture of a pen walking 
through a door marked "Entrance," you'd im- 
mediately scream out, "Penguin Software!" Af- 
ter everyone told you to shut up and quit acting 
like a fool, you'd explain, "Pen go in; Penguin!" 

All you have to do is write down what the 
picture says and what it refers to. For those still 
confused, all you'd have to write for the first 
example would be, "It's a person being at- 
tacked by snacks; Snack Attack." Just writing

down the company or product won't do. 

Now, in English: there are two things you 
have to write down for each picture. 

Simple? You bet. There's one hitch, how- 
ever. What would an April contest be without 
the usual fool? Softalk's contest staff refused to 
be the fools again, so the dirty bunch of sneaks 
decided to turn the tables on you this time. The 
trick: how can you be sure all the pictures refer 
to a company or product? You can't. We won't 
tell you if they all do or not. And if they don't, 
we're not saying which ones or how many 
might be fake. (One? Ten? None of them? All of 
them?) That's your job. 

All of the pictures say something, that's for 
sure. But when you find one that's not a com- 
pany or product, write down its translation fol- 
lowed by, "Nyah, nyah, you can't make a fool 
out of me!" 

When you have your list filled out, send it in 
with a facsimile of the coupon on this page (any 
fools caught cutting up the magazine will find 
their entries at the bottom of the pile). 

Oh yeah, prizes. The person who submits the 



entry with the most correct answers will win 
$101 in prizes made by our advertisers. The ex- 
tra dollar is for having the guts to enter a con- 
test like this. 

' In case of a tie, the mighty Softalk RFD 
(random fool designator) will designate one 
lucky soul as the Softalk Fool of the Month, 
who will foolishly walk off with all the loot, 
laughing all the way to the computer store.

Contest Winners 



The Subheads Are Saved. Okay, we'll ad- 
mit it. Writing short stories may not be as easy 
as solving droodles, writing limericks, or even 
counting turkeys. But look at it this way the 
Save the Subheads contest in January's issue 
sure did weed out those who were looking for a 
fast and easy $100 prize. The contest was not 
one to be fooled with by the amateur entrant. 

It was an interesting sight. The same thou- 
sands of turkey counters who took a chance 
with the November contest and the countless 
die-hards who entered the Oracle '83 contest 



which section of the magazine she's been 
reading.) 

"Then, I grouped the subheads that seemed 
to belong together on separate sheets of pa- 
per," Oerman continues. "I worked on the story 
itself for about an hour and a half every day for 
two weeks while I was at school waiting for my 
brother to finish his last class." She should have 
been using that time for studying, but who are 
we to judge? 

All that patience and hard work paid off for 
Oerman; she'll be heading down to the Mem- 




Charles Shanes of Computer Concepts (Richmond, VA) has been taken hostage by Charles and 
Elizabeth Lewis, winners of the Oracle '82 (overall) and Oracle '82 Part 5 contests respectively. 
Shanes eventually kept the loot, but gave Charles a Disk II drive and Elizabeth her demands in 
software. 



took one look at the January contest, shrugged 
their shoulders, scratched their heads, and 
walked away. 
Most of them. 

The ones who stuck around were the same 
ones who, after sitting through eighteen hours of 
Laverne and Shirley reruns, would take just a 
short popcorn break before settling back down 
for the uninterrupted version of The Winds of 
War. 

It wasn't an easy contest, nor was it an easy 
one to judge. Entries came in all sorts of forms: 
manuscript, screenplay, diary, and even one 
with artwork on its cover. 

Choosing one winner was difficult and not a 
coveted task. Truth is, we liked a lot of them, 
and finding the best one didn't seem possible. 

But it was possible to select Lisa Oerman 
(Muscatine, I A) as the So/talk Subhead Short 
Story Writer for 1983. Oerman's story, The 
Sound of One Voice Talking, was the one that 
shined brighter than all the rest. 

Sharing her secret to winning the contest, 
Oerman told us that "first, I brought out all our 
So/talks and wrote down all the subheads. I no- 
ticed that there seemed to be a lot on the subject 
of flying and winning and losing." (Gee, guess 



ory Bank in nearby Bettendorf to pick up her 
prize. "Probably a word processor," she says 
with uncertainty. "We don't have a printer yet." 

Entries were judged on how many sub- 
heads were used in relation to nonsubheads, 
how well subheads were connected to each 
other, the quality of the overall story, and how 
well subheads blended in with the rest of the 
sentence. So f talk judges read carefully to make 
sure story writers weren't just throwing in sub- 
heads at random and then forming sentences 
around them. Some of you had the nerve to do 
that and thought it would pass for a story. 
No way. 

Others plopped down just one or a handful 
of subs and wrote epic novels around them, 
hoping that it would reel in $100 in prizes. 
Good try, but no dice. That would be like buy- 
ing a box of chocolate chip cookies, a cheese- 
cake, fifteen TV dinners, a gallon of fudge rip- 
ple ice cream, and some fresh fruit and vegeta- 
bles and saying you went on a health food shop- 
ping spree. You're not fooling anyone. 

And Now, the Standouts. Ben Moore (Car- 
pinteria, CA) wins the Modesty Blaise Pascal 
award for his three entries generated by a Pas- 
cal program. Monsieur Pascal would have been 



pleased with Moore's use of the tools of the 
craft, but only moderately so. The resulting 
short story turned out to be nothing more than 
a bunch of concatenated strings, MaxSubhead- 
Nums, and WriteLns. 

Lightning rarely strikes twice, but that 
didn't stop Susan "What's an F-stop?" West 
(Coolville, OH) from trying to win the contest 
by relating to us in her story how pleased she 
was to have won the Apples in History contest. 
" Winning [4/81] is better the second time around 
[1 1 /80]," West had the gall to write. We agreed. 
But if we had let her win again, she'd probably 
have sent in the same underexposed pictures of 
her receiving her prize as she did last time. 

We're awarding two prizes this month. The 
$100 prize goes to Lisa Oerman, and a photo- 
copy of a $100 check will go to Brian Warner 
(Rochester, IL), who sent us the carbon copy of 
his entry, keeping the original for himself. The 
nerve of some people. 

For video fanatics, a look at satellite video 
offerings ten years in the future was offered by 
George "Mind in the Gutter" Bass (Williams- 
burg, VA). On the Playboy channel, Playboy 
Video Magazine featured a pictorial, "The Girls 
of Sierra On-Line" (let's let old ads die grace- 
fully, huh?) and Playmate of the Month Bam- 
bi Mae Hopper, vice president of sales at 
VisiCorp. 

The highly coveted Softalk Greenpeace 
award goes to Laura Hunt (Parkersburg, VA) 
for her dedication to the conservation of nat- 
ural subhead resources. Wrote Hunt: "While 
writing my story, I found several subheads lead- 
ing long and healthy lives. Others I met along 
the way seemed to be hermits; I knew of their 
existence only by their brief appearance over a 
long period of time. 

"For example, the error of our ways must 
have lived for at least a year, since it appeared in 
August 1981 (page 10) and again in July 1982 
(page 82). Still others lived their lives to the full- 
est, seeing all they could, if only for a limited 
time. The real thing (April, May, and August 
1982) and Lord British (March and May 1981) 
appeared several times during their short life 
spans. 

"Some reappeared in slightly disguised 
form, perhaps the result of some crippling dis- 
ease or merely an escape from the pressures of 
subhead life. Some are old subheads in cos- 
tume; others may, in fact, be new ones with a 
family resemblance to their ancestors." 

Kids' Korner. The following is an open let- 
ter to the aspiring subhead saver supremes of 
the Farrell Area School District 

To everybody: thanks for the Valentine 
cards and stories. 

To Rhonda Zaborowski: the reason your 
dad wouldn't let you have any of the lost and 
deserted animals you saw at the California farm 
is because those abused beasts were retired Sof- 
talk writers gone crazy. 

To Ray Hajduk: where the heck did you get 
your boot knives, switchblade, .357 Magnum, 
and sawed-off shotgun? Is that what they're 
teaching you at school? Oh, well, at least you

YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN 
HAVE TO WASTE TIME 
WAITING FOR YOUR PRINTER. 



MICROBUFFER ALLOWS YOU 
TO PRINT AND PROCESS 
SIMULTANEOUSLY. 

Microbuffer will instantly increase 
your efficiency — and eliminate 
the frustration of waiting for your 
slowpoke printer. 

Now you can simply dump your 
printing data directly to Microbuffer 
and continue processing. 
Microbuffer accepts the data as 
fast as your computer can send. It 
stores the data in its own memory 
buffer, then takes control of your 
printer. 

THERE IS A MICROBUFFER 
FOR ANY COMPUTER PRINTER 
COMBINATION. 



Whatever your system, there is a 
specific Microbuffer designed to 
accommodate it. 




FOR APPLE II COMPUTERS, 
Mircobuffer II features on-board 
firmware for text formatting and 
advanced graphics dump routines. 
Both serial and pari lei versions 



have a power-efficient low- 
consumption design. Special 
functions include Basic listing 
formatter, self-test, buffer zap, and 
transparent and maintain modes. 
The 16K model is priced at $259 
and the 32K, at $299. 




FOR EPSON PRINTERS, Microbuffer/ E 
comes in two serial versions — 
8K or 16K (upgradable to 32K) — 
and two parallel versions — 16K 
or 32K (upgradable to 64K). The 
serial buffer supports both hard- 
ware handshaking and XON-XOFF 
software handshaking at baud 
rates up to 19,200. Both interfaces 
are compatible with standard Epson 
commands, including GRAFTRAX-80 
and GRAFTRAX-80 + . Prices range 
from $159 to $279. 




ALL OTHER COMPUTER/PRINTER 

COMBINATIONS are served by the 
stand-alone Microbuffer In-line. 

The serial stand-alone will 
support different input and output 
baud rates and different hand- 
shake protocol. Both serial and 
parallel versions are available in a 
32K model at $299 or 64K for 
$349. Either can be user-upgraded 
to a total of 256K with 64K add-ons 
— just $179 each. 

SIMPLE TO INSTALL. 

Microbuffer II is slot-independent. 
It slips directly inside the Apple II 
in any slot except zero. 

Microbuffer/ E mounts easily 
inside the existing auxiliary slot 
directly inside the Epson printer. 

The stand-alone Microbuffer is 
installed in-line between virtually 
any computer and any printer. 

MICROBUFFER FROM 
PRACTICAL PERIPHERALS. 

So what are you waiting for? Write 
to us for more information or ask 
your dealer for a demonstration. 

When you see how much 
freedom Microbuffer will allow, 
you'll understand why it's so silly 
to be without one.

F A S T A L K 



Fastalk is your quick guide to popular, special- 
ized, or classic software. Programs appearing in Fas- 
talk must meet one or more of the following criteria: 
(1) equal or surpass in sales the least-selling program 
to appear on any of the current bestseller lists; (2) re- 
late to a specialized subject area and be in general dis- 
tribution (more specialized packages and areas will be 
included as Fastalk matures); (3) be new and of pro- 
fessional quality (such programs will be carried for 
one month only — after that, they must meet other cri- 
teria for inclusion); (4) stand out as extraordinary. 

Designation as a classic is noted by a bullet pre- 
ceding a program's title. 

Where opinion is expressed, Softalk has seen the 
software in question; the date of So/talk's review, if 
any, is given at the end of the item. 

Softalk may arbitrarily omit any package from 
Fastalk, whether or not it meets the foregoing criteria.

on any subject, tailoring the 
program to your child's needs. No 
knowledge of computers is required. 
Our programs make sense to people 
— from 4 to 94 — and grow right 
along with your child. 

A Success In Schools 

Over 1800 school districts have 
chosen CAI programs to teach 
essential vocabulary and logic skills 
in a full range of topics. Our products 
get recognition— because they work. 

Head Start 

Your child's future begins with 
opportunities you create at home. 
Choosing resources that are 
stimulating, challenging and fun can

Spinnaker presents 
Delta Drawing. 




An introduction to the 
modern art of programming 
using the ancient art 
of drawing. 



) Spinnaker Software Corp , 1982 



Kids love to draw. 

And with Delta Drawing, your children 
can have fun creating their own colorful 
drawings, and at the same time, learn 
about computer programming. 

Delta Drawing is much more than 
just a fun game. Ifs an educational 
tool that helps children develop their 
creativity, learn to write computer pro- 
grams and 
build an 
understand- 
ing of pro- 
cedural 
thinking. 





Easier to use than LOGO. 

Delta Drawing makes 
it easy for children to 
use the computer-even 
if they've never used a 
computer before. 

In fact ifs easier to use than LOGO 
turtle graphics. And Delta Drawing costs 
less than half as much as LOGO. 

With Delta Drawing, your child controls 
the Delta cursor, and the Delta cursor 
controls all the action. 5o kids can learn 
at their own pace while they're having fun. 
How your children will learn 
programming. 

With Delta Drawing, your child first 
creates a picture using simple, single- 
key commands, for example: "D" for 
draw, T' for left "E" for erase. 

As the picture is being drawn, the com- 
puter keeps track of every keystroke 
and records it as a program. 

Then, by touching the "T" key for "text 
mode," the child can see the program 



that was written. As children progress, 
they can begin to write their programs 
in the text mode and switch to the graph- 
ics mode to see their pictures. They can 
even switch back and forth 
between graphics and 
text modes. 

Delta Drawing will 
make your child comfort- 
able with the computer 
and helps develop proce- 
dural thinking-the kind 
of step-by-step approach 
needed to write programs 
and solve problems 
with computers. 
Get Delta Drawing today. 

Delta Drawing can be played on Apple,® 
IBM® and Atari® computers. 

It comes complete with easy-to- 
follow fast-start cards. And for more 
advanced users, a completely detailed 
instruction manual. 

You can save your child's drawings 
on a blank disk and even print them, 
if you have a printer with graphics 
capabilities. 

5o look for Delta Drawing at your local 
software store. Or write to Spinnaker, 
215 Pirst Street Cambridge, MA 02142. 

You'll find that when we combined 
learning and fun, we created a work

VisiCalc was a swell idea 

for then. 



The next generation. First generation electronic 
worksheets were a good idea. They were early software 
management tools that could eliminate a lot of hours 
with a spreadsheet, calculator, pencil and eraser. Enter 
Multiplan, the next generation electronic worksheet 
that's as easy to use as it is useful. 
Make comparisons. Compare Multiplan to any of 
the earlier electronic worksheets. We've given you some 
"prompts" above. 

Compare learning time. Multiplan's tutorial book brings 
you up to speed. Fast. But Multiplan doesn't stop there. 
Multiplan's On-line Reference Guide gives you instant 
help if you have questions. It knows where you are in 
Multiplan and offers information related to your problem, 
right on the screen. 

Compare ease of use. All Multiplan prompts are 
full length words or phrases. And Multiplan provides 
"naming," the ability to assign a plain English name to any

of VisiCalc on the Apple II and IBM PC respectively. 



cell or area. "Gross Profit = Sales— Cost" rather than 
"AA44=AZ23— BK154." Which means you can work 
more intuitively. And faster. 

Compare utility. Multiplan lets you link related work- 
sheets so that information is transferred between them 
automatically. For instance, you can keep regional sales 
forecasts on separate sheets but link them with your overall 
company forecast. Then, just change the forecast for 
any region, and the company forecast sheet is updated 
automatically. Something you can't do with first generation 
worksheets. 

Compare reports. Not just the work you can do, but the 

way you can present it. Multiplan's flexible formatting 
options allow you to produce presentation -quality reports. 
And its sorting capability lets you sort by either alpha- 
betic or numeric order. So a sales manager who normally 
lists sales regions alphabetically could sort by amount 
sold and conveniently rank by sales performance. The

result is a more meaningful and useful presentation of data. 
Compare availability. With Multiplan, you're not 
limited to a single range of computers. Multiplan is avail- 
able for Apple® and for microcomputers that run 
MS™-DOS. XENIXr or CP/M-80® operating systems. 
Multiplan supports both 40- and 80- columns on the 
Apple II. 

Compare the source. Microsoft was the world's first 
microcomputer software company. Today, Microsoft 
software is running in well over a million installations, 
worldwide. Languages. Utilities. Business programs. All, 
maintained at the state-of-the-art. 
Compare for yourself. Drop into your computer store. 
Compare Multiplan's powerful, user-oriented features 
to any electronic worksheet on the market. If you've 
been using VisiCalc, Multiplan's ability to directly utilize 
your VisiCalc files lets you easily upgrade to Multiplan. 
And that's just another of the many features designed

now. 

to make Multiplan the electronic worksheet for 
now. And years from now.

For Line Surge Suppression 

The SYSTEM SAVER provides es- 
sential protection to hardware and 
data from dangerous power surges 
and spikes. 




Volts 
RMS 



SYSTEM SAVER 
APPLE II 



By connecting the Apple II 
power input through the SYSTEM 
SAVER, power is controlled in two 
ways: 1) Dangerous voltage spikes 
are clipped off at a safe 130 Volts 
RMS/175 Volts dc level. 2) High fre- 
quency noise is smoothed out be- 
fore reaching the Apple H A PI type 
filter attenuates common mode 
noise signals by a minimum of 
30 dB from 600 khz to 20 mhz, with 
a maximum attenuation of 50 dB. 



For Cooling 

As soon as you move to 64K RAM 
or 80 columns on your Apple n you 
need SYSTEM SAVER. 

Today's advanced peripheral 
cards generate more heat. In addi- 
tion, the cards block any natural air 
flow through the Apple II creating 
high temperature conditions that 
substantially reduce the life of the 
cards and the computer itself. 



For Operating Efficiency 

SYSTEM SAVER contains two 
switched power outlets. As shown 
in the diagram, the SYSTEM 
SAVER efficiently organizes your 
system so that one convenient, 
front mounted 
power switch 
controls SYSTEM 
SAVER, Apple E, 
monitor and printer. 



MONITOR 








APPLE 11 




SYSTEM SAVER provides cor- 
rect cooling. An efficient, quiet fan 
draws fresh air across the mother 
board, over the power supply and 
out the side ventilation slots. 



The heavy duty switch has a 
pilot light to alert when system is 
on You'll never use the Apple power 
switch again! 



Easy Installation 



Compatible with Apple Stand 



Just clips on. 
No mounting or 
hardware required.

If your printer uses your Apple 
more than you do, 
yott need The Bufferboard. 



If your Apple is locked into the "PRINT" 
mode so much that you've taken up soli- 
taire to kill the boredom, you need a 
buffer. And if your computer is the Apple 
II or III, the only buffer for you is The 
Bufferboard. Expandable to 64K of stor- 
age, The Bufferboard stores an instantane- 
ous bucketful of print data from your 
computer. Then it feeds the data to your 
printer at its own printing rate. Your Apple 
is set free from driving your printer and is 
ready for more data from you. 



or expensive power supplies are needed 
because The Bufferboard fits right into 
your Apple — and docks onto your existing 
printer interface. The result is convenient 





Take your existing interface — 
and buffer it! 

Only The Bufferboard has a simple 
Interface-Docking System. No bulky boxes 



and economical buffering of most popu- 
lar printer interfaces, including the 
Grappler + ™ interface, Epson interface, 
and Apple printer interface. Thirty sec- 
onds and a single hook-up are all you need 
to end the printer waiting game forever. 

Up to 20 letter-size pages 
stored at a time. 

The Bufferboard comes standard with 
16K, and is expandable to 32K or 64K of 
buffering capacity with the addition of 




memory chips. This "bucket" will hold up 
to 20 pages of a print job, allowing you

Open Discussion gives you the chance to air your views 
and concerns, to seek answers to questions, to offer so- 
lutions or helpful suggestions, and to develop a rapport 
with other readers. It's what you make it, so share your 
thoughts, typed or printed, and double-spaced (please), 
in Softalk 'j Open Discussion, Box 60, North Holly- 
wood, CA 91603. To ensure the inclusion of as many 
contributions as possible, letters may be condensed and 
edited. 

No Excuses Accepted 

Softalk is certainly the most informative and 
readable of all the microcomputer magazines I 
have seen. I especially enjoy Open Discussion 
and believe that it is the best place to present 
the Apple community with my opinions relat- 
ing to the computer marketplace. 

In your December '82 issue, Softalk printed a 
highly critical but accurate review of Sierra On- 
Line's official Frogger game. The president of 
that firm, John Williams, wrote a rebuttal that 
was printed in the January '83 issue. 

First of all, I would like to point out that 
there is no excuse for a second-rate program, 
particularly from a leading company such as 
his. Second, it is clear that Mr. Williams's ex- 
cuses are invalid. He writes: ". . . the origin of 
the 'lackluster graphics' you complain of stems 
from . . . the Apple II," and that the problem in 
the visuals is a result of "lack of color scrolling 
. . . making mud of any white object on a 
colored field . . . [and a] multitude of other 
problems that Apple graphics present." Well, 
Mr. Williams, how did Nasir Gebelli manage 
color scrolling in Phantoms Five way back in 
December 1980? How did Broderbund manage 
making objects move over colored back- 
grounds in A .£.? How have thousands of enter- 
prising programmers worldwide managed to 
work around the "multitude of problems that 
Apple graphics present" to produce the most 
stunning array of games and other graphic soft- 
ware available for any microcomputer? It's 
called ingenuity, and it's something you could 
have used a lot more of in preparing your 
Frogger. 

On another note, I found the article on the 
Apple He quite interesting, and I'm looking for- 
ward to reading more on the subject. However, 
Softalk 's coverage of the Lisa was disappoint- 
ing. Although I cannot afford this machine, I 
would be interested in reading about it, as I 
imagine most of your readers would. Perhaps 
the lack of coverage was due to an early pub- 
lication deadline. In any case, I'm hoping that 
you will print something additional about it in, 
the next few months. Other things that I would 
like to see are a review of the huge variety of 
add-in microprocessor boards now available 
and a monthly top-ten chart for peripherals and 
accessories. 

David Temkin, Highland Park, NJ 



S S I O H 

There's no doubt that ingenuity and Apples go 
together; the Apple's accessibility has enabled 
programmers and hardware designers to do things 
on the Apple that "should" have been impossible. 

But some problems have not been solved, and 
it's not fair knocking creators because they don't 
create everything. Ben Franklin discovered elec- 
tricity, but he neglected to invent the light bulb; is 
he less admirable because of it? On the other 
hand, he didn't try to market key-adorned kites. 

Vertical scrolling, like that in Phantoms 
Five, has been implemented on the Apple for 
some time. Horizontal scrolling is a different mat- 
ter entirely. No one has discovered how to extend 
the Apple's limitations in this area. 

A.E. uses color in an unusual way; none of it 
is solid color. In fact, the background is black — 
that is, no color. Color on color is a problem as 
yet unsolved. 

There are people who swear that Atari graph- 
ics have it all over Apple graphics for just such 
abilities as these. But we agree with you — in gen- 
eral, our old Apple's graphics look a heck of a lot 
better anyway. 

Sierra On-Line has broken many barriers. 
It's no wonder that when it licensed Frogger from 
Sega, Sierra expected to be able to break bar- 
riers here too. It couldn't. Whether this means the 
company should have dropped the project for the 
Apple is a moot point. But John Williams, who is, 
incidentally, not president but director of mar- 
keting for Sierra On-Line, was not talking 
through his hat. 

On that other note, more coverage on the Lisa 



will be forthcoming — when we have a Lisa to tell 
you about firsthand. 

Militating against Half-Tracking 

I would like to see all games designed so that 
players are able to save the top ten scores to 
disk, with initials on request. They should also 
be able to erase these scores if requested. This 
would make all games a little more challenging 
and fun. Also, software writers: please don't 
make my disk drive do funny things. It really 
doesn't like to go half-tracking, which doesn't 
prolong its life very well. 

Contrary to some beliefs, arcade games 
should also be "backupable." Most people say 
that since games are of low price, people can af- 
ford to have them replaced. This is just an ex- 
cuse of the businessman who can afford to do 
so. When you're in the military, getting only a 4 
percent raise (as we did this year), twenty-five to 
thirty-five dollars is a lot of money. 

One company that does not get any recog- 
nition is Cross Educational. It makes some ex- 
cellent programs for many high school or col- 
lege courses. 

Dennis Heaton, Seattle, WA 
Lucky Legaliteen 

Softalk could do its readers a valuable service 
by running an article discussing and clarifying 
the laws regarding software copyrights. I've no- 
ticed that there seems to be some confusion 
about what's legal and what's not. Most people 
are aware that copying software to sell is illegal, 
but how about trading copies, or photocopying 
software documentation? I have not seen such 
an article in any major computer magazine. 

On my recent sixteenth birthday, my moth- 
er baked her traditional cake — this time, it was 
an Apple (16K, of course). Here it is, for fellow 
readers to enjoy seeing. (I was lucky enough to 
enjoy eating it too!)

Hopping Support 

I wanted to take this opportunity to let your 
readers know that some software manufac- 
turers do care about us. I purchased the game 
Frogger by Sierra On-Line a couple of months 
ago. From the moment I first attempted to boot 
the disk to play the game, I got nothing but a 
whirring drive and a rebooting message on my 
screen. Needless to say, I tired of Frogger rapid- 
ly. I decided to fire off a rather testy letter to 
Sierra On-Line and tell them what I thought of 
a game that took me six tries to boot. Within a 
few days of my letter, I got a personal phone 
call from the publisher. They were very sorry I 
was having such a rough time. They asked me 
to send them my disk, and told me they'd send 
another. Sure enough, they did. 

Well, I had the new disk about one week, 
and then it went bonkers when I tried to boot it 
(flashing inverse characters all over the screen — 
that kind of thing). Again, I shipped my disk off 
with another letter, and again they sent me an- 
other disk. And this one works great! I think 
Sierra On-Line's support of their software is 
fantastic; they deserve a lot of our business for 
that very reason. My hat is off to them — thanks 
for being there when it counted!

Properly Handled 

I sent a letter to Silicon Valley Systems outlin- 
ing an interface problem I was having between 
my printer and Word Handler II. Within seven 
working days I received a phone call from them 
concerning my problem. Not only did the lady 
help me to my great satisfaction, but she was 
also very pleasant and even filled me in on the 
latest updates that they're working on for Word 
Handler. Even though I had offered to call them 
in my letter, they went out of their way and 
called me. Their timely and positive manner 
convinced me that they really are there to help. 
That's the support a user is looking for.

Exemplary Exec 

Softalk has been of great assistance to me in my 
first year as an Apple owner. I have been 
pleased that, despite your financial dependence 
on the software industry for advertisements, 
you have been able to maintain your journalis- 
tic independence in the reviewing of software. I 
am particularly referring to your critical review 
of Frogger by Sierra On-Line, your largest ad- 
vertiser and the sponsor of my first year as a 
Softalk subscriber. 

I would particularly like to thank you for 
"Exec TG Products" that appeared in the De- 
cember '82 issue. I had become extremely frus- 
trated with three TG joysticks, two of which I 
had to return to the store during the warranty 
period. At the time of the article, I had a nine- 
month-old TG joystick that had failed about 
two weeks after the ninety-day warranty had ex- 
pired. After reading the article, I took a chance 
and mailed the product to TG with an explana- 
tory letter and an offer to pay a reasonable 
amount for repair. Two weeks later, I received 
my joystick back, repaired with TG's improved 



strain-relief round cable rather than the ribbon 
cable that had been the source of my problems. 
There was no charge for the repair. TG was un- 
der no obligation to provide this service. I 
would like to thank them and to thank Softalk 
for informing me of the quality of this 
company.

A Few Inches More 

It has been difficult for me to obtain an exten- 
sion cable that will connect my Apple II to an 
Epson printer. The cord and connector leading 
from the interface card were too short. I need- 
ed the convenience of an extension cord. The 
Data Set Cable Company of Las Vegas, Ne- 
vada, was my solution. This company special- 
izes in constructing extension cables. The man- 
ager of the division, Gordon Paulson, con- 
structed a high-quality cable for me, and I've 
found it works well.

The Right Answer 

The out-of-the-ordinary assistance received 
from Jack Oakuright of Answer Corporation 
and their Disk Utility 1.1 saved the day for this 
Florida accounting firm. Somehow we man- 
aged to destroy the directory on the data file of 
our largest client. Without the help of their disk 
utility, we would have lost one hundred fifty 
hours of input, not that we didn't keep a back- 
up. With the disk and backup from their engi- 
neering staff, the directory was restored in 
twenty minutes. By the way, we were using a 
VisiCalc storage function when the disk became 
inoperable. It was the second time this had oc- 
curred, and we have since tossed the VisiCalc 
master program aside and use the backup copy. 
We would be interested in hearing if anyone else 
has experienced this problem.

An Examination of Premises 

As an expatriate Californian living in London 
and working in the computer field, I would like 
to comment on a disturbing aspect of some 
computer games recently emanating from my 
former homeland. Specifically, I have in mind 
those games pretending to be simulations of a 
possible nuclear war between the United States 
and the Soviet Union. What is disturbing is that 
these games convey (or perpetuate) misunder- 
standings of the present East /West stand-off 
that are not only false but also highly dangerous. 

Two of these games are worthy of discus- 
sion: Norad (Southwestern Data Systems) and 
Germany 1985 (Strategic Simulations), since 
each, in its own way, illustrates this pernicious 
effect of computer games. I should point out 
that the quality of this software, as software, is 
not in question (and is of little importance any- 
way). What I am concerned about is the dan- 
gerous misunderstandings and misconceptions 
that these games propagate. 

According to Softalk's mention (January 
'83, page 93), "Germany 1985 is. . .SSI's cata- 
strophic vision of World War III. Soviet battal- 
ions have invaded. . .West Germany. The game 



provides several variables to challenge the play- 
er in this confrontation between East and 
West." Softalk's writer, incidentally, goes on for 
several lines in this lighthearted manner, as if 
nuclear conflict between East and West (and 
don't think it wouldn't be nuclear) were simply 
a variation on Dungeons and Dragons. 

My essential criticism of SSI's game (and 
similar ones) is that it perpetuates a vital mis- 
understanding of the nature and degree of the 
Soviet threat to the West. The public under- 
standing, fostered by recent administrations and 
by Pentagon spokesmen, is that the Soviet 
Union is the embodiment of everything evil, 
and thus of everything un-American. This sce- 
nario concludes that the Soviet Union would 
certainly invade (and probably destroy) West- 
ern Europe were it not for the fear of Western 
nuclear retaliation. This view is false. But it is 
widely believed, and this belief (among others) 
has consequences that are extremely dangerous 
for the West — indeed, for the world. 

The fact is that a peaceful trade with a 
flourishing, capitalist Western Europe is much 
more advantageous to the Soviet Union than an 
attempted military invasion. The distinguished 
American scholar George Kennan makes the 
point succinctly when he writes that "the fears 
voiced in [the U.S.] and in Western Europe 
about the present danger of a surprise Soviet at- 
tack against the NATO countries of Western 
Europe are almost too bizarre to be credible" 
(The Nuclear Delusion, page 94).

known for its sober, high-quality utilities. But in 
describing Norad, SDS's product guide be- 
comes breathless with excitement. "Alert! En- 
emy missiles bearing nuclear warheads are hur- 
tling towards the United States! Automatic 
ABM guidance systems have failed! You have 
been designated as the failsafe system, and must 
manually target ..." ad nauseam. 

How many players of Norad (how many 
nonp layers, too) know that the United States 
has no antiballistic missile (ABM) system, and 
that there are no plans to install any? The 
United States is practically defenseless against 
incoming warheads. The missiles themselves fall 
back to earth as soon as their warheads have 
been released. The Soviet Union is similarly al- 
most defenseless, despite the existence of a rudi- 
mentary ABM system around Moscow. The 
reason America lacks an ABM system is not 
for want of money. The Pentagon generals ap- 
parently have only to ask to receive, even 
though what they get is the funny money that is 
wrecking the American economy. No, the rea- 
son is that there is simply no effective defense 
against hundreds of ballistic warheads raining 
down at ten thousand miles per hour, mostly 
through tornadoes of superheated gas pro- 
duced by previous explosions. 

Do the buyers of Norad believe that Amer- 
ica has any defense against Soviet retaliation to 
an American first strike? Don't forget that while 
the Soviet Union has repeatedly and publicly re- 
nounced the first use of atomic weapons, first 
use remains the cornerstone of NATO's Euro- 



pean defense strategy. Games such as Norad en- 
courage the illusion that a war between the 
United States and the Soviet Union would ba- 
sically be like any other war — except that this 
time we would have the very latest in techno- 
logical weaponry, and the best (the very best) 
that our tax dollars could buy. This is an illu- 
sion that may turn out to be fatal for us all. 

How, then, is it possible for software pub- 
lishers like SSI and SDS to be so flippant in 
their portrayal of what would be a scarcely 
imaginable disaster, a catastrophe so horren- 
dous that even the extermination of six million 
people would pale in comparison. From pub- 
lishers of software who are otherwise apparent- 
ly intelligent, can we not hope also for some 
moral responsibility? Or is it too late, even for 
that? 

Robert Marlowe, London, England 

Of Peripherals, Piracy, and Protection Policy 

First of all, let me say that I am not trying to 
add to the producer/pirate debate, since most 
discussion directed to that front has not pro- 
duced a solution — even if it has made us all 
painfully aware that we have a problem on our 
hands. My two cents' worth is aimed at a blight 
on the tree of modern microcomputing called 
copy-protection schemes. 

On the outside, it seems to be a very rea- 
sonable idea. If some people are making copies 
for illegitimate purposes, make it impossible for 
people to copy the software. Of course, this 
raises the price of the software — to pay for not 



only the added cost of developing protection 
schemes but also registration costs, the extra 
costs of backups or for a little hardware board, 
and so forth. One thing that really steams me is 
that we (you and I, the consumers) are paying 
for a feature that doesn't work! 

Early protection schemes begat nibble 
copiers, and as the protection improved so did 
the nibble copiers. Recently, some software 
houses developed disks that they claim cannot 
be copied using a nibble copier. Along come 
folks with some new hardware boards that take 
a picture of your entire memory so that no to- 
tal load program is safe. So now manufacturers 
are producing software to look at all the ROMs 
in your peripheral slots to find these cards. Can 
you imagine what will happen if your printer 
card ROM has the same bit of code in the loca- 
tions they check? "Sorry, but because of our 
copy-protection scheme, you can't get a hard 
copy of your database." 

In any case, I think the following statement 
is valid: for any copy-protection scheme de- 
vised, some bright person somewhere will in- 
vent a way to bypass or break the protection. 
Thus, we are paying for a feature that we nei- 
ther want nor need. Just for the record, the only 
copy-protected software I buy are games, where 
there doesn't seem to be much difference in the 
price of protected and unprotected software. 

Actually, the increased price isn't the only 
reason I won't buy protected software. After all, 
there are some very nice packages that do won- 
derful things that are copy-protected. In some 
cases, it's the warranties that scare me away. 
Several of the very high-priced packages work 
on the "break-it, buy-it" principle. You can look 
over the manual all you want for free, but break 
the seal on the disk package and it's yours. I've 
seen several pieces of software that looked good 
on paper but just didn't perform as I expected in 
use. Manuals never cover everything, and per- 
haps the software will perform the undocu- 
mented function you desire, but you'll never 
know until you try it. If you don't believe that 
this is a common problem, read the letters pages 
of other popular computer magazines more 
carefully. Software manufacturers often submit 
letters saying, "In your review you stated that 
our program didn't do such and such, but if you 
perform the following steps (this will be clari- 
fied in the new manual) you can do such and 
such." 

Of course, warranties are basically a cost 
problem as well. If you are loaded with money, 
maybe you can afford to blow $500 on soft- 
ware that you later find to be worthless to you. 
My next point hits everyone — the rich and the 
poor. What was the last piece of perfect soft- 
ware you wrote? Let's face it: most complicated 
software can run into problems. What if you 
bought one of those new, improved, 100-per- 
cent-compatible disk drives? Sure, they handle 
3.2, 3.3, CP/M, and Pascal, but what if a given 
program's whiz-bang operating system plays 
games that the specs don't mention? Then — 
pow! It worked fine at the dealer's place, but it 
won't boot for you. Go back to your dealer on 
hands and knees and pray that he'll take it back. 






WW 



How about those little errors, like a misspelling 
in an error message, or the trace option that 
won't work when printing using the buffer op- 
tion? These things probably won't show up in 
testing, but what if some user discovers them 
and reports them? You can't just send an errata 
sheet to your customers, since they don't have 
the tools to correct the problem. Is the manu- 
facturer going to send a new disk to all of its 
customers and recall all of the old packages 
from stores to get new disks? For a little error? 
We knew the answer to that question before we 
asked it. 

There's something I've always suspected 
about copy protectors. I've always thought that 
they were hiding something. Remember, I buy 
only games, so this applies only to certain game 
manufacturers. What kind of stuff other folks 
are getting away with I don't know. I bought an 
Enhancer II, a Videx product, because I needed 
upper and lower case; the auto-repeat and type- 
ahead buffer sounded nice; macro keys sound- 
ed great; it wouldn't take a slot; and the price 
was reasonable. Of course, even though the En- 
hancer fit in the space where the encoder board 
used to fit, I didn't believe it would work just 
like the encoder board. So I took a whole load 
of software to my dealer to test it — my terminal 
program, my assemblers, my compilers, Pascal, 
CP/M, my full-screen editors, the works. All of 
the funny, unkeyables worked in Basic, in Pas- 
cal, in CP/M, and so forth. I couldn't find one 
thing wrong with the Enhancer. So I brought it 
home, installed it, and was delighted. 

Unfortunately, I did not test any of my 
games. I mean, why should I? None of them use 
special keys. What were they hiding? Some 
game manufacturers do not strobe the key- 
board after reading a character! The old Apple 
keyboards didn't care, and the encoder board 
Apples don't care, but the Enhancer doesn't like 
it. So suddenly three of my favorite games re- 
spond to my keyboard once, and do not re- 
spond again until I press the reset key. Do you 
know why this is unpardonable? Because Ap- 
ple states in the reference manual that the key- 
board should be strobed after you read a char- 
acter! Because all of these games could be fixed 
to work on all Apples (old, encoder, Enhancer) 
by adding, at most, eight bytes of code! Be- 
cause for months I thought that I had found a 
problem with the Enhancer until a friend of 
mine showed me what was causing the prob- 
lem, using a game he wrote as an example. 

So what can we do about copy-protected 
software? I don't know about you, but I have 
just changed my personal policy. Now I won't 
even buy copy-protected games. 
Richard Ekblaw, Champaign, IL 

The manufacturer responds: 

Some programs, games especially, may have 
trouble with a type-ahead buffer. While it is 
easy to flush the buffer at any time from the 
keyboard, Videx has a solution to offer those 
who can identify with this reader's inconven- 
ience. It is possible to disable any feature of the 
Enhancer II by using the Macro Editor pro- 



gram on the Enhancer Utilities Disk. The En- 
hancer II has always offered this. 

During the past year, Videx has been pro- 
ducing Enhancer lis with Firmware 1.1, which 
will automatically disable the Enhancer N's ad- 
vanced features simply by holding down the 
space bar while turning on the power. This fea- 
ture was designed to provide our users with con- 
venience and ease of operation with any 
program. 

Videx will provide updates of the new ver- 
sion of Enhancer firmware at no charge, on an 
exchange-due basis. A call to our customer serv- 
ice department is all that is necessary to ar- 
range a firmware exchange. 

(Videx has recently made available a Quick 
Reference card for the Enhancer II. For those 



interested in receiving one, please call or send a 
stamped, self-addressed envelope to our cus- 
tomer service department.)

Dumb Protection 

I've read in other computer publications of soft- 
ware companies rescinding their copy-protec- 
tion schemes due to pressure from CP/M users. 
This, I believe, is indicative of the attitude held 
by CP/M users toward copy protection of the 
programs they use. 

I cannot believe that CP/M users are more 
honest or intelligent than Apple users. How- 
ever, they do insist that they be able to back up 
their programs, or modify them to suit their

needs, as necessary. 

It soon becomes obvious to anyone using an 
Apple for business, as I do, that the 5'/4-inch 
disks do not do the job. Even a pair of 8-inch 
drives in single density is doing it the hard way. 
Copy-protected programs do not allow the user 
to download to the 8-inch drives. It is for this 
reason that all my business software runs on my 
Apple under CP/M. 

Possibly, if enough users of Apple DOS 
(Dumb Operating System) would let software 
producers know their feelings, like CP/M users 
have, it might do some good to improve the 
situation.

No Flair for Fiction 

I really enjoy Softalk; it's wonderful. However, 
there are some things I would like to see 
changed and new things added. 

First of all, I absolutely love the new col- 
umn on telecommunications for the Apple. It is 
my favorite column, and I think that it should 
be in every magazine. 

I agree with Edward Isenberg (January 
Open Discussion). Softalk should use adver- 
tisement cards and limit each user to choose 
only three information numbers. That way peo- 
ple wouldn't circle fifty numbers just to get 
some mail. I also think that each month there 
should be a favorite program. In some maga- 
zines, there is a questionnaire to fill out asking 
about your favorite programs. This would help 
many people decide what programs to buy by 
seeing what other people like. 

What has happened to Marketalk Re- 
views? I have noticed the number of reviews de- 
clining, as well as the length of the reviews. 
Please try and cram in a few more. 

Now here is my major complaint about the 
magazine. In recent issues, there have been fic- 
tional stories that deal with computers. I hate 
them! Your magazine is about computers, not 
computer stories. They make your magazine 
look like Playboy\ Whether that's bad or not re- 
mains to be seen. Please remove them at once. I 
find them dull and boring. 
Peter T. Clark, Sacramento, CA 

Stepwise Projections 

I have been reading Softalk for the past year 
and a half, and I really look forward to each is- 
sue. My only complaint, which isn't much of 
one, is that I have a hard time getting through 
an entire issue before the next one comes out! 

I found the article, "The Cat That's the Ap- 
ple's Meow," in the February issue most inter- 
esting. I feel there is a real place in the maga- 
zine for such articles that take readers through 
projects step by step. I would like to make my 
Apple do things, but I'm never quite sure how 
to go about it. I am sure, though, that many 
readers would take a great interest in this type 
of article. What we're talking about is explor- 
ing ways to interface the Apple to the real 
world — from controlling simple external 
switches and beyond. Most books that attempt 
this seem too technical. Softalk articles that ap- 
proach these ideas simply, much like a Heath- 
kit manual, would be valuable. Here is an area 
that holds great potential, but it seems neglect- 
ed by most magazines.

Printer Hints in Print 

In Peter Olivieri's December '82 Mind Your 
Business, he referred to an excellent book on the 
Epson for the Apple. So far I've drawn blanks 
in trying to find such a book. Could you identi- 
fy this book for me? 
Mathias J. Leupold, Wayland, MA 

The book referred to was the Epson MX 
Printer Manual. Although it is published by 
Compusoft Publishing, it is available only with the 
purchase of the Graftrax Plus Retrofit Kit; you 
can't get it separately. 

In the February Open Discussion I made refer- 
ence to and recommended The Other Epson 
Manual. I'm writing now to let readers know 
the address of the publisher, Cut the Bull Soft- 
ware, Box 82761, San Diego, CA 92138. 

This manual is a thirty-eight-page soft-cover 
book, printed using the Epson printer by Bill 
Parker, one of the staff writers for Call 
— A.P.P.L.E. To quote the author, the manual is 
"a summary of tips, tricks, debugged sample 
programs, and improved documentation for the 
MX-80 printer with Graftrax."

Needling for the Opined 

I'd like to see more about the play and pro- 
gramming in Softalk's product reviews, and 
maybe the reviewers' opinions as well.

Beyond the Outlines 

I am a regular reader of Softalk and enjoy the 
magazine very much. I have been reading Oli- 
vieri's Outline of Word Processors, and I am 
tired of reading reviews of word processing pro- 
grams written by someone who is not familiar 
with, and who hasn't used, the programs he re- 
views. Today's sophisticated and powerful word 
processing programs for the Apple II require in- 
tensive and extensive use in order to be proper- 
ly evaluated. 

In January Softalk, Peter Olivieri reviews 
ScreenWriter II by Sierra On-Line; and he 
makes it clear that he has barely looked at the 
program and has written his review based on a 
quick reading of the manual and some conver- 
sations with users. For example, control-P ad- 
vances the cursor one page, not shift-conlrol-P . 
He says that ". . .certain maneuvers are some- 
times cumbersome. . ." and "until. . .an attach- 
ment to the game port is developed, this will al- 
ways be the case to some degree with word 
processing programs on microcomputers." If he 
had used the program he would know that a 
joystick can be used for cursor movements with 
ScreenWriter II. In a very brief review he sin- 
gles out indexes and hyphenation for consider- 
ation, functions little used by the average writer. 
Yet he refers to "something called runoff," 
which is the entire second half of the program, 
the printing half. And this contains one of the 
most useful and powerful features of the pro-

processing program designed for microcom- 
puters can allow the user to display on-screen 
exactly what will be printed on paper. Anyone 
who is at all familiar with word processing 
should know this. Also, I cannot reconcile the 
fact that Olivieri discusses a high-level function 
such as automatic index creation and asks, 
"Where, oh where, are those sticky labels?" 
Sticky labels indeed! 

A colleague and I, both college English in- 
structors and both currently writing our Ph.D. 
dissertations, have reviewed word processing 
programs for the Apple II during the last year. 
We both do a lot of writing besides our disser- 
tations. We both chose Screen Writer II over all 
the other programs, including WordStar. 

Only by working with a word processing 
program intensively and for a considerable 
length of time can one truly become familiar 
with its strengths and weaknesses. Several times 
we felt that we had found the perfect program, 
only to find, days or weeks later, that the pro- 
gram was limited or flawed in some serious 
way. We contacted Sierra On-Line about some 
problems with the program they were not aware 
of. It is apparent (given the history of the pro- 
gram) that they have not had the program eval- 
uated by someone who needs, understands, and 
uses word processing. They have relied on user 
response — not a good marketing technique. 
The continued popularity of the program indi- 
cates that users recognize the many strengths of 
the program and value it in spite of its flaws. 
Given its checkered past, Olivieri should have 
said something about file integrity mainte- 
nance; I assume he didn't because he doesn't 
know the program. 

ScreenWriter II is the most versatile and 
powerful word processing program on the mar- 
ket for the Apple II. By the way, Olivieri is 
wrong when he says that the original Magic 
Window program has only a forty-column dis- 
play. I've worked with that one too. To be sure, 
Screen Writer II has a number of faults, none of 
which Olivieri pointed out. There is not space 
enough here to enumerate the many strengths 
of ScreenWriter II, nor to enumerate its several 
weaknesses. I have long waited for an accurate 
and thorough review of the program, which re- 
ceived some bad press in its earlier versions. I 
guess I will have to wait until I write the review 
myself. 

George Tylutki, La Plume, PA 

Peter Olivieri responds: 

It is very easy to get defensive about George Ty- 
lutki's comments, but I think it unnecessary in 
this case. I would, however, like to comment on 
one or two points he raises. 

First and foremost, I do use the programs 
that are reviewed. I have a set of applications 
that are entered into each of the word process- 
ing programs. They are evaluated based on 
these particular applications. These packages do 
not get as thorough an evaluation as our reader 
has been able to give, but it should be remem- 
bered that the articles are outlines, not critical 
reviews. In earlier installments we cautioned

readers to do their homework, try out the pack- 
ages that interest them, and use the outlines as 
guides only. 

As to whether I understand word process- 
ing, I suppose that may always be open to ques- 
tion. However, I (like George Tylutki) wrote my 
dissertation using a word processor. I have used 
IBM, Digital, and Apple word processors, in- 
cluding Screen Writer. In fact, for the last three 
years, everything I've typed has been done on a 
word processor. 

Mr. Tylutki's letter, however, serves a much 
more important purpose. It portrays a user who 
is both thoroughly familiar with, and quite hap- 
py using, a particular word processing package. 
In many ways, his letter serves to highlight the 



strengths of ScreenW riter II much better than 
many a review. It is a very powerful program 
and one of my favorites. It is, of course, impor- 
tant to use a package thoroughly to finally get 
to know its strengths and weaknesses, just as it 
is important to know a good deal about the re- 
quirements of one's own particular application. 
I hope that my word processing outlines pro- 
vide readers with some help in narrowing their 
choices. Feedback from readers like Mr. Tylut- 
ki certainly helps.

Light Reprieve 

Tell Christopher Light that machine language is 
confusing enough for beginners without their 



having to decipher his mistakes. I refer to his 
column from the January '83 Softalk. 

When himem is set to location 38144 ($9500), 
the string formations are, as he says, started at 
38143, working their way down. Examining 
locations 38368 to 38400 ($95E0 to $9600) will 
reveal your machine language program at 38384 
($95F0), but your new strings will not be dan- 
gling from 38383 ($95EF) downward, as he also 
says. Rather, they will be found dangling from 
38143 ($94FF) downward. If Chris is not more 
careful he may be found dangling from the gal- 
lows — the victim of all the beginners who get 
hung up on his mistakes.

Powerful Suggestion 

To Greg Tibbetts: Can you suggest any sources 
of public-domain software for CP/M users? 
Daniel J. Krause, West Bloomfield, MI 

Greg Tibbetts responds: 

Try contacting the larger CP/M user groups for 
their group library. At last count, for example, 
CPMUG, the primary one, had seventy-five- 
plus eight-inch disks of public-domain pro- 
grams, most including the source code. Much of 
this collection is of limited value, and some of 
the rest must be modified slightly for use with 
SoftCard. A full catalogue is available of all 
seventy-five disks by contacting the group. They 
can be reached at CP/M User's Group, 1651 
Third Avenue, New York, NY 10028. You 
might also contact Digital Research at their Pa- 
cific Grove headquarters for the names of other 
groups.

Cursors! Foiled Again! 

Calling all Apple III users! Something very 
strange happened to me after typing in Taylor 
Pohlman's superb character font and shape ta- 
ble editor in the February '83 Softalk. I ran the 
program with no problems. I tried experiment- 
ing with a new block-style character font. After 
changing a few characters I saved the font and 
loaded it into memory. Everything worked fine 
except for one problem — the entire character 
font was backward! 

When I find the bug, it will have a slow and 
painful death. Nothing escapes the blazing 
cursor! 

Also, many of you who don't have Pascal 
may have problems trying to load in new char- 
acter fonts created by the font editor. One way 
to load these newly created fonts is by using a 
simple program called Newdownload on page 
138 of the April '82 issue of Softalk. Both this 
program and the accompanying character font

editor are written by John Jeppson. Of course, 
owners of Apple III Pascal only have to use the 
alter function of the Pascal Filer to change the 
font's current file type to a font-file type.

Serendipity 

Someone asked in Open Discussion how to ac- 
cess the escape code necessary to change print- 
ing modes for the Epson MX-80 F/T printer 
when using Apple Writer II. Needless to say, I 
have been anxiously waiting for the answer. 
This morning I accidentally found out how, and 
want to share with Softalk readers. 

I stumbled — and I mean stumbled — on it 
while writing a program in word processing lan- 
guage to handle mailing labels. It got me to the 
back of the manual, Appendix B, to be more 
specific. There, on page 104, is a discussion of 
the special characters glossary file that you load 
from the Additional Functions Menu (#5 and 
the file name Special). With some experiment- 
ing I discovered that the following works. 

After loading the Special file, you have ac- 
cess to the escape code, a flashing "[" with a 
"D" or "U" (the escape shift-D and the escape 
shift-U for the Qume Sprint printer). Just call 
either of the special commands in and simply 
change the D or U to the character you need for 
your printer command. The flashing "[" appar- 
ently is the escape code command. Whichever 
letter you change it to, however, must be in up- 
per case. I assume one can use this same tech- 
nique for other printers using the escape com- 
mand. It seems to work well. 
Charles Miller, Cambridge, MN 

Logo a Go-Go 

I was surprised to see the high sales for Apple 
Logo, and not see Terrapin Logo in Fastalk. 
Apple certainly has done a remarkabLe job in 
marketing the second-best Logo available for 
the Apple computer. Whereas Apple Logo has 
many bells and whistles, it is second to Terra- 
pin Logo in three essential features: It is less ef- 
ficient in memory use. (Very important, con- 
sidering that the interpreter leaves only about 
ten thousand bytes for the user.) It has no con- 
venient trace function. (Important not only for 
debugging but also for understanding pro- 
grams, in particular the interplay of various 
program modules and understanding recur- 
sion.) Its syntax is, overall, less user-friendly. 

Perhaps your entries in Fastalk contribute 
to the misconception that apparently exists 
among the public. The October Softalk men- 
tions Apple Logo but ignores Terrapin Logo 
completely. The January '83 issue mentions 
Terrapin Logo, but the two are treated quite 
differently. The two Logos are so similar that 
giving Papert as the author for one but not for 
the other is misleading (not to mention that 
many other people, not the least of which is 
Harold Abelson, were involved in developing 
the language). If Apple Logo is a "first-rate ed- 
ucational tool," so is Terrapin Logo. Both en- 
tries completely miss the potential of Logo in 
string and list manipulation, and therefore in 
language processing and, at least of Terrapin 



Logo, in music, feeding the widespread mis- 
conception that Logo is merely a graphics lan- 
guage. Terrapin's documentation is, if any- 
thing, better than Apple's and so are its utilities. 
Dagobert Soergel, College Park, MD 

A major criterion for inclusion in Fastalk is 
sales. All programs that sell as many packages as 
the least-selling entry to make any of Softalk 's 
bestseller lists are meant to be included. Apple's 
Logo was the only one to meet this criterion. 
Another criterion is service. You will find Terra- 
pin's and Krell's Logos reinstated in this issue, 
along with a new entry, Cyberlogo. In the event 
of space limitations, programs included by this 
criterion will have to be deleted first. 

A Miser Now Wiser 

In some ads I see reference to a 6 percent Cali- 
fornia state sales tax which is to be added to 
orders. It appears to me that businesses located in 
places such as Los Angeles where there is an 
added Vi percent sales tax (earmarked for pub- 
lic transit or some other local use) are trying to 
get this added tax from us nonresidents. I am not 
going to donate to the Los Angeles public tran- 
sit system, which I'll probably never use, even if 
I am willing to accept the 6 percent state sales 
tax. I can order from out of state and pay less 
for transportation and handling than this 6'/2 
percent tax. I balk at being assessed any added 
local tax that neither I nor my representative 
have voted upon. If Los Angeles wants to help 



business, they'd better omit that added tax on 
mail orders and be content with their cut of the 
regular tax. 

Charles P. Haber, Huntington Beach, CA 

The California State Board of Equalization 
requires that businesses in California assess a 6 
percent sales tax from residents who purchase 
items mail order. Certain counties, Los Angeles 
and San Francisco among them, assess an addi- 
tional Vi percent transit lax. If you are purchas- 
ing mail order from businesses within these coun- 
ties, and you intend to use what you purchase in 
these counties, you pay a total of 6 'A percent sales 
tax. If you reside and will be using your mail- 
order purchase outside the areas with the transit 
tax, you are not required to pay the extra 'A per- 
cent. This is the case even if the businesses you' re 
buying from are located in one of the areas that 
has a transit tax. If you don't live in California at 
all, none of these taxes will apply to your mail- 
order purchases. Got it? 

Tales of the Unexplained 

I am fourteen years old and have an Apple II 
Plus with a disk installed in slot 6. For experi- 
mental purposes I tried the following program: 

10 FOR A = 0 TO 6 
20 PR#A 
30 NEXT A 

If the program had worked as written, it would 
have executed PRjfO and then hung on PRjfl. 
Instead, it immediately booted my disk in slot 6. 




Auto Repeat: Invaluable. Repeats any 
keypress, including control characters for 
scrolling, rubout, etc. Adjustable delay to 
match your typing touch. ON/OFF control. 

High Speed Cursor: Makes Apple's REPT 
key a speed control to double the repeat 
rate of any keypress. Zip through text or 
across a VisiCalc spreadsheet to get there 
fast. A must for 80 column displays. 

New option for the REPEATERRRR: 
SHIFT-key Modification: SHIFT as you 
should. Get the "standardized" connection 
(SHIFT-key to Game I/O) while leaving the 
Game I/O open with our plug-in connector. 
Supported by most popular word proces- 
sors (Apple Writer II, Word Handler, Screen 
Writer II, etc.) and many other programs. 
Works only with certain software and/or 
most 80 column boards. 

Easy installation. Open top and plug onto

I had some other strange results, with some 
variations. When I changed line 20 to IN§A in 
place of PR#A, the disk also booted. Here is 
the strange part. With 20 changed, I inserted 
line 1 5 as print A . When the program was run, 
numbers 1 through 6 were printed in a column 
and the disk booted when it hit 6. The strangest 
part was when line 20 was changed back to 
PR§A — the computer printed 0 and 1, and 
finally hung. If anyone reading this has an ex- 
planation, please write to Open Discussion.

Hot Stuff 

Does anyone know of an Apple II program to 
monitor preventive-maintenance steps in a heat- 



ing system? I am looking for a standalone mod- 
el, equivalent to the computerized reminder- 
and-recorder systems offered by certain climate 
control services. 

On another subject, Michael Demyan's ad- 
vice in December '82 Open Discussion is in- 
complete. He suggested determining VisiCalc's 
degree of precision with the formula: 

@INT ((cell) * x .5) / x 

where x governs the number of decimal places 
of precision desired. 

This formula works only when the value in 
cell is positive or zero. If there is any chance that 
cell contains a negative number, use (or regret 
not using): 



@INT ((cell) * x + @IF (cell > 0, .5, 
-.5)) / x

Negative Reaction, Positive Results 

The letter "No Small Change" from Stanley 
Wilcox in Open Discussion (December '82) was 
interesting, but I found that it required a few big 
changes in order to work properly with nega- 
tive numbers. I've rewritten the program to 
handle negatives, and it also inserts a con- 
venient dollar sign.

We've found this program can handle num- 
bers as large as 9,999,999.99 (positive or nega- 
tive) accurately. With numbers larger than that 
you will find yourself dealing with modified sci- 
entific notation, whereupon there should be no 
confusion when it gives you a wrong answer be- 
cause a wrong answer never looks like a right an- 
swer. One idiosyncrasy: The number 1.009 will be 
rounded to 1. 01 , but .009 alone comes out as 0.00. 

Caught in a Bind 

Someone please help me if you can! For over 
five years a Hewlett-Packard desktop calcula- 
tor, with eight-inch floppy disks and custom 
software, has been a workhorse in my small 
business. Increasing maintenance-contract fees 
have forced me to invest in new microcomput- 
er technology. I have three Apple II Pluses, and 
over eight thousand dollars invested in Corvus 
20M storage, a Mirror with video-cassette back- 
up, and a Constellation network. I have bought 
numerous programs, including dBase II, Visi- 
Calc, Datadex, Pie Writer, AppleWriter II, Su- 
per File, Route Master, and a half dozen others. 
Altogether I have over $20,000 invested, count- 
ing the Qume printer and Epson MX- 100 print- 
er, six disk drives, three monitors, a Saturn 
128K card, Microsoft cards, an Apple lan- 
guage card, and eighty-column cards. I want to 
store my programs on the Corvus with quick 
access from a menu.

Beyond Basics 

I am a math and computer teacher at Monroe 
High School. Monroe is a small private school 
in Fairbanks, Alaska. About two years ago we 
received our first microcomputer. We now have 
five Apple II Pluses, and over forty students 
have completed a one-semester course in 
beginning Basic. Our emphasis in the course is 
on problem-solving through structured pro- 
gramming, with a little history and hardware 
technology, as well as an examination of the 
uses of computers in society. From the com-

ments of our graduates who have taken com- 
puter courses on the university level, and the in- 
dependent projects of some of our other stu- 
dents, we feel the course is successful. 

We are now thinking of offering a second 
course in computers. And here we are having a 
problem. In most of the computer magazines 
we subscribe to, very little is said about what to 
do after a student completes a basic Basic 
course. Perhaps someone could recommend a 
good textbook for our use. 

I know what I would like to do: teach Pas- 
cal. But using Pascal on the Apple really re- 
quires two disk drives and a language card for 
each computer. That is a little out of our budg- 
et. Next, I would like to teach data manage- 
ment, specifically, creating and amending se- 
quential and random-access files, arrays, sort- 
ing, and more complicated uses of string ma- 
nipulation. Currently, I have several students 
doing independent study, learning just these 
techniques. One is even learning machine lan- 
guage and shape tables, which I can't help much 
with. I would really like to design a more for- 
mal approach. A usable textbook would prob- 
ably have to be Apple-specific, but I'm having 
trouble finding any suitable text. 

Perhaps I'm having trouble because these 
topics are not best dealt with using Basic, so no 
one writes about them in Basic. I find that diffi- 
cult to accept. Can fellow readers be of any 
assistance? 

Rodney D. Hixon, Fairbanks, AK 



Subsidizing the Future 

I have taken one computer class during my sen- 
ior year of high school, and I plan on con- 
tinuing my study of computer science when I go 
to Central Michigan University. My sources of 
financial aid are limited; I was wondering if any 
readers of Softalk know of any organizations or 
companies that offer financial assistance to peo- 
ple like me, who wish to work toward a degree 
in computer science. I'd appreciate hearing 
about it in Open Discussion. 
Mark Deja, Gladstone, MI 

Planning Ahead for Summer 

I'm interested in going to computer camp this 
summer. I am eleven years old and my family 
has an Apple II Plus. Can anyone give me some 
leads on computer camps in general, or one 
near me that I could contact? Please let me 
know through Open Discussion — I really want 
to find one I can go to. 
Sheri Bowman, Harlingen, TX 

Pascal Publications, Please 

As a novice to the microcomputer field, I have 
asked many people which language I should 
try to learn first. As you might expect, Pascal 
was often given as the language to learn. I pur- 
chased Apple's Pascal package for my Apple II 
Plus and have been trying to teach myself Pas- 
cal. I have had some problems and cannot 
readily find solutions. Yet, I often read about 
Basic solutions to similar problems. Still, I want 
to go directly to Pascal, not Basic. Could any- 
one suggest any good, clear books that would 
help me? 

Jim Rebeck, Sun Prairie, WI 
A Disarming Plea 

I have a problem, and I'd like to find the best 
way to use my Apple II Plus with two disk 
drives, Epson printer, and File Cabinet to 
solve it. 

I am working with the Freeze Strategic Nu- 
clear Campaign, and one of my jobs is to col- 
lect and organize hundreds of newspaper clip- 
pings on various phases of the project. The 
cross references, many of them financial, for ex- 
ample, can be very broad indeed. I don't have a 
manual to use with File Cabinet, and I under- 
stand that no single manual exists for this pro- 
gram. Very little of my data is numerical — it 
consists mainly of news clippings. The program 
says that I can sort my material either alpha- 
betically or numerically. I'm not sure which 
method I should use. I'm also not sure how 
much material from each clip I can store in my 
files. Since I have two disk drives, I would like 
to use the second one for data files, while dedi- 
cating the other drive to my operating pro- 
gram. I don't really know how to accomplish 
this correctly. 

I keep the news clippings in file folders and I 
have begun to number them. I got the idea that 
I could key my files into the computer as lists, 
then the computer could direct me in locating 
the original clipping by referencing its file fold- 
er number. I need to devise a way to locate clip- 
pings faster and with greater ease.

Search for a Remedy 

I am associated with a group of seven physi- 
cians. We work out of several different places 
and all have specialties. I am in charge of the 
time-consuming and frustrating task of sched- 
uling. It is often mandatory that certain people 
be in the hospital for special procedures. Along 
with this, I must schedule vacation and time off 
for these physicians. 

I own an Apple II Plus and feel that if I could 
get an appropriate program commercially it 
would be ideal for this problem. I have checked 
with my local computer dealer and they are not 
aware of any such program. I would appreciate 
any information from readers that might help.

Brain-Wave Imbroglio 

Some friends and I are currently involved in a 
stress-management program of sorts. One of us 
has an Apple, and we'd like any information 
about hardware or software that can be utilized

program development, and we are in dire need 
of such feedback information. We'd appreciate 
reading any suggestions or recommendations in 
Open Discussion.

Hard Put To Justify 

In August of 1982 I purchased an Apple II Plus 
with the Apple III monitor and disk drive. 
Along with the assorted software I received a 
free trial subscription to your magazine. I had 
certain expectations of what your magazine 
would offer but I was not prepared for the dis- 
mal failure of it to meet even some of them. 

From a magazine devoted exclusively to the 
Apple computer, I would have expected more 
concerning the operation of the computer. 
Someone must have realized that in a number 
of places the manuals that come with the Apple 
leave a lot to be desired. It is an ideal situation 
for you to take advantage of by publishing ar- 
ticles on the nuts-and-bolts operations of the 
computer, clarifying vague points in the refer- 
ence manuals, and discussing basic program- 
ming at all levels. 

If one has any common sense, one must 
realize that computers are having a growing 
impact on our lives and will continue to do so. 
There is an incredible demand for beginning 
programming courses. So/talk has apparently 
chosen to use itself as a forum allowing adver- 
tisers to market their products to those who can 
ill afford to spend money on related equipment 
after the considerable initial investment. It is 
rather reminiscent of the marketing of the 
American car. You can get the basic car but you 
must expend x amount of dollars more to make 
it work right.

First, the company was able to move out of Alan Dziejma's basement 
and into the entire second floor of a professional building, leasing an 
enormous twelve hundred square feet of space. Large windows and ex- 
tensive skylights provided natural light to the environment, a definite im- 
provement from the basement. 

Secondly, Dziejma (pronounced Jayma) chose a new product direc- 
tion for the company. Continuing its development of multiapplication 
programs, Business Solutions decided to produce a package that com- 



bined an electronic spreadsheet with a database management system 
while also offering word processing. This jack-of-all-trades program 
turned out to be even more than Dziejma had envisioned. Thus, Busi- 
ness Solutions's most popular product was named The Incredible Jack. 

The evolution of a company from a creeping, crawling caterpillar to a 
beautiful soaring butterfly is a fascinating process. Very few companies 
actually achieve the metamorphosis; the corporate jungle swallows most 
of them first. 

Evolutionary Process. The spring of 1983 finds Business Solutions 
undergoing a similar corporate evolution on the eastern end of Long 
Island. It is difficult to peer inside the cocoon and observe the process in 
detail, as the shield of corporate secrecy protects the evolving pupa. 
However, from a study of the early stages of the company's life span an

intriguing picture emerges. 

Business Solutions hatched from the fertile mind of Alan Dziejma 
in 1980. Dziejma started his computer career while in college at Carne- 
gie Mellon University in 1964. 

"I entered the school thinking that I wanted to be either a profes- 
sional violinist or a physicist," Dziejma recalls. "Obviously, I have not 
met either of my career goals!" 

Early in his college career, Dziejma took an advanced-placement 
computer-science course. "I had absolutely no inkling what a computer 
was, but I was in the mood to take all the tricky-sounding courses." The 
first computer Dziejma worked on was a 32K Bendix G-20, which had a 
drum memory and ALGOL for the programming language. The first 
project he worked on entailed using ALGOL to create and rotate three-

Graduating in 1967 with a degree in mathematics, Dziejma went to 
work for White Weld and Company, an investment banking firm on 
Wall Street. White Weld had the idea of providing Standard and Poors 
data to financial analysts on a timesharing basis. Dziejma was initially 
responsible for developing a compiler for the appropriately titled "First 
Financial Language" program.

Incredible Jack, at the 1982 Comdex in Las Vegas. 



After a whirlwind six months, Dziejma found himself, at the ripe age 
of twenty, in charge of the entire development effort of the company, 
with seven people reporting to him. Due to his age, Dziejma had to take 
older people with him on business trips; he was too young to rent a car. 

In the late sixties, timesharing created quite a stir in the financial 
community. The first First Financial Language was also well received, 
and Dziejma was called on to give lectures on the system concept. He 
spoke at the Sloane School, New York University, and the Massachu- 
setts Institute of Technology. 




EZ-INVOICE 

We are very very proud to announce the long awaited 
EZ-INVOICE 1.0. 

EZ-INVOICE will allow you to generate invoices and then 
save them to disk. You may then recall the invoices and 
print them or fully edit them. The great thing about 
EZ-INVOICE is that everything on the invoices is user 
designed. The lines of dashes, the centering of headers, 
even which line the header (if any) is to go on. You can 
now enter comments right into the invoice/statement 
and have last line messages and on and on. The really 
exciting feature about EZ-INVOICE is the editing 
features. When you recall an invoice/statement from 
your invoice-data disk you will be able to edit any of the 
items on the invoice and then print it or save it. You will 
be able to delete items, revise items and add items. 

EZ-INVOICE also has a keyboard Macro feature. What 
this means ip that you can build a name and address file 
or an items and prices file and then call the entire record 
into your invoice by entering a user defined three 
character code, what could be easier!

Making of a VisiFriend. One of Dziejma's employees at White Weld 
was Bob Frankston, who was then a high-school student working part- 
time. A close, long-term friendship developed between the two that 
would span the evolving microcomputer industry. Frankston was best 
man at Dziejma's wedding long before teaming up with Dan Bricklin to 
write VisiCalc. 

In 1969, the timesharing industry fell on hard times, and Dziejma 
looked around for something new. While working for White Weld and 
its subsidiary, Interactive Data, he had done some consulting work for 
General Motors, at the still amazing amount of four hundred dollars per 
day. Dziejma worked on General Motors's financial reporting system, 
called Oracle, and so impressed the company that in late 1969 they hired 
him full-time. 

Dziejma was responsible for the design of a massive branch informa- 
tion system. GM had more than three hundred offices nationwide and 
wanted to link them all electronically. GM's original concept was for five 
regional data centers to share the timesharing chores. Dziejma intro- 
duced the idea of doing some of the local processing at the individual 
branch offices on smaller computers. This speeded up the network con- 
siderably by freeing the large-scale timesharing computers from trivial 
tasks. It also boosted the reliability of the network, decreasing the 
amount of expensive downtime. Dziejma chose the small Datapoint 
computers as the best for use in the branch offices and had twenty sys- 
tems installed throughout the company. 

Dziejma next tackled the development of a general ledger system for 
GM's U.S. division. Even though some of the figures ran into ten 
digits, the entire multibillion-dollar operation was accounted for by 
Dziejma on a 16K Datapoint 2200 with cassettes. Previously the ac- 
counting work had been done manually on large cards, so the company 
was very pleased with the marvelous upgrade. 

Datapoint underwent a massive reorganization in 1970, and in the 
following year was looking for a director of marketing. Dziejma was 
chosen for the position and the opportunity proved a real change of 
pace. He hadn't had any real marketing experience, but what he did have 
was a good, solid grassroots feel for how the Datapoint equipment could 
be used, based on his work at GM. Dziejma proceeded to build a mar- 
keting staff for Datapoint's computers. 

Datapoint's 2200 was a 16K desktop computer with an unusual wide 
and short CRT. The computer had a tremendous one-millisecond re- 
sponse time, and sold for the very affordable price of $16,000. Dziejma 
was at the forefront of what became known as distributor processing. 
The idea was to take small computers and distribute them everywhere. 
Dziejma brought to the project an understanding of applications cou- 
pled with an in-depth knowledge of networking. 

The Arc of Computing. Datapoint's innovative ARC networking 
system was Dziejma's brainchild. The concept was to have remote data- 
bases to which resource processors could be attached. Massive comput- 
er capability was split up among little modules. 

Dziejma's success at GM attracted a great amount of industry atten- 
tion. In particular, the giant Digital Equipment Corporation appreci- 
ated his talents. In 1973, he joined Digital as product manager, where his 
most significant accomplishment was a hard-won fight to bring the VT- 
100 to light. 

Dziejma felt that Digital needed an intelligent terminal to replace the 
mainstay VT-52, which was large, bulky, and nonintelligent. Due to 
shifts in corporate emphasis, the project was canceled seven times. Each 
time he resurrected the VT-100 and started pounding on doors to gather 
support and funding. 

Dziejma was completely responsible for the functional specifications 
of the terminal. The VT-100 had several innovative features — 132 col- 
umns, smooth scrolling, double-high/double-wide characters, and print- 
er spooling. While working at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, 
Dziejma had developed the technique for an expanded character gen- 
erator. The terminal was a phenomenal success, shattering all previous 
Digital sales records. 

Digital promoted Dziejma to group manager over all small systems, 
such as the LSI-1 1 series, as well as all the terminals. He had twenty-five 
product managers under his supervision, accounting for $350 million a 
year in sales.

APRIL 1983 



Dziejma was also on the steering committee for the development of 
DECNET, Digital's networking system. DECNET's big success was that, 
for the first time, relatively incompatible systems and terminals could be 
linked together. DECNET now spans the globe, linking major comput- 
ers in different countries. 

Digital VP. In 1977 Dziejma received an offer from Applied Digital 
Data Systems to become the company's vice president of marketing. The 
firm was the country's largest OEM supplier of display terminals, but it 
was rapidly losing ground to National Cash Register. Applied Digital 
was trying to break into the computer field; they had marketed the 64K 
System 70 with an 8080-based processor. It was the size of a desk and so 
wide that it had to be dismantled to fit through a door. Quite innovative 
at its introduction, the machine was woefully outdated by the time 
Dziejma joined the company. 

Applied Digital Data Systems had only one hardware engineer and 
three technicians available to work on the development of a new com- 
puter. Dziejma quickly realized that unless the company formed a group 
whose only job was to develop a new computer, it would never get any- 
where in the market. So he created the computer division and in 1980 in- 
troduced a family of three computers under the name of MultiVision. 
The entry-level machine was equipped with 64K and two double-density, 
double-sided disk drives. 

At the same time, Frankston and Bricklin were beginning their 
meteoric rise with VisiCalc. Dziejma suddenly realized that a growing 
market existed for software. He had gotten out of software and into sys- 
tems because the software business was not really a business back in the 
sixties. Sixteen years ago, software was considered an ethereal thing that 
was routinely included with the hardware. "The software business grew 
up when I was not looking," Dziejma says. 

Dziejma bought an Apple in 1980 and the potential of this new won- 
der really excited him. 

The Ultimate Solution. Dziejma approached John Brown, a former 
colleague at Digital Equipment, for some seed money in September of

1980. On an initial investment of $120,000, Dziejma founded Business 
Solutions. The initial premise of the company was to form a product line 
aimed at the Fortune 500. Dziejma felt that VisiCalc was not address- 
ing the needs of the large corporations — the networking environment. 
What was needed, he thought, were turnkey systems that would fulfill 
the specific needs of different corporate areas. 

Business Solutions's first products were tailored for sales managers, 
because Dziejma understood the need for such modules in his previous 
work. The first module, "Sales Performance," was followed by "Setting 
Quotas" and "Calculating Commissions." Dziejma chose an innovative 
packaging for the company's product line, a compact white plastic disk. 
He did not want the usual notebook-style packaging, but something 
unique. 

Late in 1980, Business Solutions hired its second employee, Marie 
Aurigemma, as office manager. Aurigemma had been Dziejma's execu- 
tive secretary at Applied Digital Data Systems. "Alan said he wanted to 
build a small company where everyone could enjoy their work," she re- 
calls. Her new offices at Business Solutions comprised Dziejma's com- 
fortably furnished basement. She was told on being hired that the only 
condition for her employment was that she had to go out and buy her 
own desk! To this day, through all the company's relocating, Aurigem- 
ma still has that desk. 

Unfortunately, in December 1980 the marketplace was not ready for 
vertical applications. The needed channels of distribution did not yet ex- 
ist. Although some orders were received, it wasn't profitable to sell a 
package for $125 when only fifty a month were sold. By January 1981, 
John Brown, who was now with Business Solutions, and Dziejma came 
to the realization that the real marketable product was the module de- 
signer itself. It was time to sell the goose instead of the golden eggs. This 
internal development tool evolved into Senior Analyst, which in- 
cluded database management and electronic spreadsheet capability. 

In a Nutshell. Dziejma began actively seeking a distributor for the 
company's new product. A humorous situation arose because he had 
chosen the code name "Project Acorn" for disguising the software proj- 
ect. Unbeknownst to him, IBM had chosen that same phrase for its top- 
secret personal computer. When Dziejma was making the rounds to dif- 
ferent high-level people in the computer industry, he raised quite a few 
eyebrows by relating that his company was working on "Project Acorn"! 

With Bob Frankston's help, Dziejma entered into rapid contract ne- 
gotiations with Personal Software, the original name of VisiCorp. Just 
before an agreement was reached, Apple Computer heard about 
Dziejma's product. Apple was very interested in the product because it 
was written in Pascal and therefore translated easily to the then-new 
Apple III. 

At the time, Apple was hungry for any product that would operate 
on the III and immediately outbid Personal Software. Apple agreed ini- 
tially to buy fourteen thousand copies. This represented quite a windfall 
for Dziejma's small company, but help was needed to pull it off. 

Fortunately a big university in nearby Stony Brook, Long Island, 
had a large number of Pascal-adept students. Dziejma devised an un- 
usual employment test. First, he ran a want ad, especially seeking Pascal 
programmers. He was amazed when ninety students answered the ad. To 
weed out the nonserious applicants, Dziejma sent each a section of Sen- 
ior Analyst's code with one part wrong. The task of the applicants was 
to figure out what was wrong with the code, and only the most persistent 
students came back to Dziejma with the solution. Still, there were thirty 
persistent people to choose among. Only four students were hired. Three 
of them, Brian Macker, Susan Liers, and Robert Wimpfheimer, are still 
with the company. 

Working long hours in Dziejma's basement, the group developed the 
final form of Senior Analyst for the Apple II Plus and Apple III. What 
started as a part-time summer job for the students rapidly became a full- 
time position. The team often worked far into the night, and occasional- 
ly Marie Aurigemma would stumble over people in sleeping bags when 
she arrived the next morning. 

Robert Wimpfheimer handled the computation portion of the pro- 
gram. He later did consulting for Apple Computer on a variety of pro- 
grams while still working for Business Solutions.

Apple 11+ owners can enjoy 
the calculating power of 
VisiCalc with "advanced" for- 
matting features found only 
on the Apple III. 



Introducing VisiCalc Formatting Aids 4.1, the latest 
version of this popular VisiCalc enhancement program 
which adds print-using to the earlier features of print- 
ing variable width columns, formula reading and file 
handling. 

The new global features are as easy as selecting A, B, or 
C from a menu. There are only 3 VisiCalc-like key com- 
mands for non-global formatting of specific grids or 
ranges of columns or rows. There are 3 other key 
commands for printing selected rows, controlling line 
spacing, and issuing top-of-form feeds. These 6 keys are 
the only non-english commands in the entire program. 

No more paste-ups. No more retyping. No more mar- 
ginal-looking reports. All this without sacrificing VisiCalc 
memory! VisiCalc Formatting Aids reads files just as 
VisiCalc does, but instead of taking up memory for 
calculating power, VisiCalc Formatting Aids is dedicated 
solely to file handling and report formatting. In fact, it 
can process huge files created on expansion RAM boards 
quickly and easily.

eration and data management development of Senior Analyst. He also 
converted the Apple II Plus version to the Apple III. Dziejma thinks 
Macker is one of the finest programmers he has ever worked with: 
"Brian has an unusual style of writing programs. He works the entire 
program up on paper first, doing all the debugging in his head. He then 
inputs the program into the computer and it runs the very first time." 

Susan Liers managed the quality assurance of the product and did 
the technical writing. Liers is a world-class athlete in the grueling sport of 
race walking and holds a half dozen world records. She has represented 
the United States in overseas track meets and participated in the Helsin- 
ki Olympics in 1952. 

The first copies of the Apple II Plus version of Senior Analyst were 
delivered to Apple in November 1981; the Apple III version was deliv- 
ered in the spring of 1982. 

Because of the company's close ties to Apple, Business Solutions's 
next major product, The Incredible Jack, was developed initially for the 
debut of the Apple He originally set for October 1982. The program was 
one of the very first written exclusively for the He. 

Dziejma provided the architecture for the program. Brian Macker 
was responsible for the word processing and file management portions. 
Susan Liers handled the same duties as before with equal aplomb. A few 
new team members were added. Frederick Tryster, another graduate 
from Stony Brook University, did programming for the compiler and 
spreadsheet portions of The Incredible Jack. Marie Gaudet wrote the 
documentation. Karen Saroka joined as an administrative assistant, 
while Suresh Jagannathan handled additional programming functions. 

Business Solutions is basically a ground-floor development com- 
pany. It specializes in doing fundamental research into new frontiers. The 
Incredible Jack was actually a case of reversed engineering. When the 
creators started mapping out the functions the program should have, 
they looked at several current programs on the Apple to see what fea- 
tures were then most marketable. Some of the features were difficult to

match, but with perseverance they managed not only to do so but also to 
expand upon them. Afterward, it dawned on Dziejma that they had used 
Apple III programs as prototypes. This meant that they had reverse-engi- 
neered the Apple Ill's SOS operating system, enabling those same so- 
phisticated features now to be run on the Apple II Plus with much less 
memory. Quite a feat! 

What the Buzz? The Incredible Jack is a technological break- 
through. It is the only truly integrated form of applications software on 
the Apple market today. The phrase integrated application has become 
the hottest buzzword of 1983. Several other programs appear to be inte- 
grated but in fact are not. Those programs offer multifunctional pro- 
grams, but each function is still separate from the others. Not so with The 
Incredible Jack. Business Solutions has actually managed to meld word 
processing, database management, and spreadsheet capabilities into 
one program. That means that if there is a table of figures within a re- 
port, and if some of the figures, or the total, are referred to in the text, the 
changing of any of those numbers will cause the text to be updated auto- 
matically. That is real integration. 

With The Incredible Jack, Business Solutions planned on doing its 
own marketing. The company's biggest problem is its obscurity in the 
marketplace. Hardly anyone realizes that this is the company that wrote 
Senior Analyst — the price one pays when a product is marketed by 
another company. 

The Incredible Jack was launched in the fall of 1982 on a $30,000 ad- 
vertising budget. The response has been phenomenal. The Incredible Jack 
is priced at one-third the cost of its closest competitor. Every sales pro- 
jection has been exceeded by many factors of magnitude. Now the ma- 
jor national distributors are asking Dziejma if they can distribute the 
product. 

Under Instead of over the Hill. The price structuring of the product 

also reflects Dziejma's feeling about the historic value of programs. "One 
of the disadvantages of being in the computer industry for sixteen years is 
that all of the major accomplishments of my youth that really seemed 
like big deals at the time are now being sold for twenty-nine dollars!" 
Dziejma has decided to make The Incredible Jack a classic in its own 
time. 

One of Dziejma's strengths is his ability to captivate people with his 
vision of the future. The latest person to be swept up to those Olympian 
heights is a very familiar name with Apple Computer, Marc Shargel. 
Shargel joined Business Solutions in February 1983 as vice president of 
marketing. To take this position he had to move from sunny California 
to the northeastern chill of February in Long Island, New York. Only 
the highest motivations could have prompted such a move. 

Shargel had been with Apple for two and a half years, in charge of 
producing point-of-sale materials for dealers and developing the large li- 
brary of Apple software training demos. He was the star of Apple's fa- 
mous video sales training tape that introduced the Apple III "Profes- 
sional Solution" promotion to the national sales force in the summer of 
1982. His background in Pascal programming on the Apple III will stand 
him in good stead among the Business Solutions people, where the post- 
er, "Pascal Spoken Here," really has some meaning. 

The hiring of a high-powered executive like Shargel is part of the co- 
coon-spinning process the company is undergoing. Another visible sign 
is the recent expansion of the company, almost tripling its previous floor 
space. Accompanying this is a projected general increase in employees 
from twelve to twenty. To fund this metamorphosis, Dziejma recently ar- 
ranged the private placing of $1 million for funding. This will allow the 
advertising budget to expand substantially to $400,000 this year. Dziej- 
ma's four-year plan is right on track and accelerating. 

It's What's inside That Counts. It's quite perplexing to look at this 
particular corporate cocoon and determine with any certainty what the 
shape and color of the resultant butterfly will be. A light touch on the 
surface of the cocoon yields quite a surprise, which startles the casual 
lepidopterist. Usually, one can feel the smooth, quiet breathing of a con- 
fident pupa waiting for its appointed time to emerge and soar in the 
morning sun. 

This cocoon, instead, feels like an ingathering of strength, of a 
panther tensing to strike. What will emerge may well surprise the entire 
microcomputer industry. JM

THE BASIC 




o ution 

By Wm. V R. Smith 



record has been viewed, you will be kicked back 
to the menu. 

Delete-a-record will remove any record in the 
file. It does this by removing the last record in 
the database, writing it over the record to be de- 
leted, and decrementing the next-available-rec- 
ord counter (NAR) by one. This method is fast- 
er than moving all the subsequent records back 
to fill in the space, although it does change the 
order of the records. 

The print-data section won't be available 
until next month. If you choose it, you should 
get a "not functional" message. 

Nothing we're going to present in next 
month's section will change the file structure, so 
you can begin entering records now if you want. 
If you make any modifications between now 
and then, keep the version as it appears here un- 
der another file name so you can be sure to have 
a version that is compatible with the new 
sections. 

These are the changes to make to the sec- 
tions from last month. 



This second part of our database manage- 
ment program presents the sections that handle 
disk input and output, including a method for 
deleting data from the middle of a random-ac- 
cess text file. 

Last month, part 1 of the three-part presen- 
tation introduced the routines for handling the 
menu and entering, editing, viewing, and delet- 
ing a record in memory. That may sound like 
most of the battle right there, but remember 
that this is a disk-based database, as we dis- 
cussed last month. All of those actions could be 
performed on only one record. That makes for 
a pretty limited program, so this month's rou- 
tines allow all those functions to act upon as 
many pieces of data as you can reasonably get 
on a disk. And yet, there is still only one record 
kept in memory at a time. 

Some of the new routines necessitated some 
changes in the old routines, so preceding the 
listing of new routines is a short list of lines to 
type in. Some of the lines are additions and. 
some are changes to last month's sections, but 
they can all be easily incorporated by loading 
the program from last month and just typing 
them in. In addition, there is one line to delete, 
which is mentioned after the additions. When 
you've done all that, you're ready to type in the 
new routines. 

The first new section includes a lot of rem 
statements. You don't have to type these in if 
you don't want to, but keep them handy. They 
will be invaluable to you if you ever want to 
modify the program in any way. Three new 
variables are identified in lines 120 through 122 
and all of the major routines are listed in lines 
200 through 290. 

The disk I/O routines are in lines 4000 
through 4490. The database uses random-ac- 
cess records with a maximum field length of 
forty characters. As currently configured, the 



program will include five separate fields in each 
record. You can change this number of fields by 
changing the data in lines 1200 through 1230 be- 
fore you start a data file. 

Be sure to save the program to disk before 
you run it, as a syntax or typing error could 
damage the program in memory. In fact, it's 
usually a good idea to save to disk every five 
minutes or so while you're entering a program 
as a guard against power fluctuations. 

When you first run the program it will 
search the disk for a file called Data File. Since 
it won't be there the first time, the program will 
ask you if it is all right to clear the file. Enter a Y 
and the program will ask for a database name; 
then it will open a file with a few fields to re- 
cord that name and the number of records, 
which starts at zero. 

If, by the way, you already have a file called 
Data File on the database program disk, but it 
wasn't created by this program, transfer the file 
to another disk and delete it from the disk con- 
taining the program or this program will dam- 
age the information in it. 

Each time you run the program thereafter, 
the disk will spin and the program will open 
your data file. Because of the way the file is 
saved and automatically opened, you can only 
keep one data file on each disk. Enter a few rec- 
ords and then try out the other options in the 
menu. 

The view-record option lets you look at all 
the fields in a single record, selecting the first 
record automatically and incrementing from 
there unless you ask for a specific one. The 
view-a-page option looks at one selected field in 
all the records. This option is useful if you want 
to find a particular record but you don't know 
where it is. 

The edit-record and delete-record options 
each operate on the last record viewed. If no

VisiCalc™ 

pre-boot with 80-Column Display 

Now you can view the VisiCalc electronic worksheet window in 
80 columns. Since the entry line is also 80 columns wide, 
complex formulas can now be seen in their entirety for editing 
ease. An added bonus is the ability to display upper and lower 
case $49.00 

Suggested retail price 

For those who need even more power, a more advanced ver- 
sion combines all the above features with the ability to use 
many of the memory expansion boards currently available. A 
configuration editor allows VisiCalc to use a mixture of dif- 
ferent kinds of memory expansion cards. Just tell it what

VENTURES WITH 
VISICALC 



BV JOE SHELTOH 



When you purchased VisiCalc, you received one of the best sources of 
information on how to learn and use it — the VisiCalc manual. But like 
any form of instruction, the manual is more useful to some people than it 
is to others. This month, we'll discuss a couple of books that show how 
to use VisiCalc. We'll look also at a couple of special training packages 
and at some products that might help you get more out of the program. 

Then, for you VisiCalc junkies, we'll examine and experiment with 
one of the most powerful features of VisiCalc — replicate. Most everyone 
knows how to use it, but few people understand all its nuances or know 
the kinds of tricks you can do to make it more valuable and easier to use. 
We'll use replicate to create a checkbook balance template that will help 
you make sure your checkbook matches your bank statement. 

VisiCalc Primers. A number of authors who recognize that there's a 
need for simpler, more concise information than the manual provides 
have written books that explain VisiCalc in different ways. There are 
many such publications available; a trip to your dealer or to a bookstore 
that carries a good selection of computer books will prove that. The two 
volumes mentioned here are good examples of the kinds of books avail- 
able, but they are not by any means the only good ones out there. 

The first, The VisiCalc Book Apple Edition by Donald Beil (Reston 
Publishing Company, Reston, VA), is an example of a book that could 
supplement, or even replace, your manual. Beil's book is a thorough ex- 
planation of what VisiCalc is, what it does, and how to use it. It does 
what a good book should do — begins at the beginning, explaining Visi- 
Calc in simple terms. It then proceeds to explain what the program can 
be used for and, through a number of examples in tutorial form, intro- 
duces a new purchaser to the power of VisiCalc. 

But don't let that fool you experienced users. Obviously, you're still 
interested in learning or you wouldn't be reading this article. The Visi- 
Calc Book offers experienced users a lot too. Have you had trouble un- 
derstanding how to use a particular function, even though it is explained 
in the manual? The VisiCalc Book explains every function and com- 
mand in depth. It also contains many charts and drawings that can real- 
ly help you understand the program more completely. Don't throw away 
your manual, but if you want an exceptional addition to your library, 
one that will probably end up beside your computer, do look at The Visi- 
Calc Book. 

Real Estate. If you happen to overhear someone trying to describe 
VisiCalc to a friend, one phrase that's likely to come up is "the power of 
VisiCalc." Patricia J. Hughes and Kaz Ochi have used that expression in 
the title of their new book, The Power of VisiCalc: Real Estate (Manage- 
ment Information Source, Portland, OR). 

The authors assume that you have a basic understanding of VisiCalc 
and proceed to show you how you can use VisiCalc in real estate. Each 
command and entry is shown, so you can make some use of the book 
even if you don't understand VisiCalc very well. You'll have an easier 
time of it if you have an understanding of real estate also, but once 
you've completed a template, you can easily use it to do such things as 
projected operating cash-flow analysis. This book isn't for everybody, 
but if you're involved in real estate the book might be a very impor- 
tant addition to your library. 

Beginner Training. Program manuals have a big job to do. They 



must explain what a product is and how you use it, and they must at- 
tempt to provide a constant source of reference as users become more ex- 
perienced. Sadly, many manuals that try to do all of these things end up 
doing none of them very well. In addition, many people who buy a pro- 
gram just don't have time to read the entire manual. 

Apple Computer produces a number of Product Training Paks 
(available from your dealer) for many of their more important products. 
These PTPs are designed to provide users with just the basics of how to 
use a program. The assumption is that a PTP will teach that 10 percent 
of a product you use 80 percent of the time. 

Apple's PTP for VisiCalc is a simple and friendly forty-five-page in- 
troduction that begins by explaining how to boot the system. The 
VisiCalc PTP is an especially useful product in the business environ- 
ment, since business users often need to pick up, in a minimum amount 
of time, the minimum information necessary to operate the program. 
Even though this package is designed for the Apple III, most of the com- 
mands are equally useful for VisiCalc on the Apple II. To maximize 
learning, users should have a computer and the VisiCalc program disk 
available. 

Interactive. For a different kind of training, Cdex Corporation has 
created Cdex Training for VisiCalc. This three-ring binder contains three 
training disks that provide interactive instruction on how to use Visi- 
Calc. The training begins by explaining such simple things as how to 
move the cursor and progresses to matters as complex as the individual 
functions. Good graphic examples work together with the program's in- 
teractive nature to assist you in learning. This package is a very useful 
one for someone who is just getting started with VisiCalc and wants to 
learn it quickly. Of course, you can pick and choose your topics, but the 
package can't really be used as a quick reference aid. 

To Replicate or Not To Replicate. Once you understand the repli- 
cate command, you'll rarely be questioning whether to use it or not. 
You'll use it often and save lots of time by doing so. It may not add to 
your analytical ability, but it certainly will speed up and simplify the 
process of developing templates. 

On the off chance that you don't know about replicate (a surprising 
number of VisiCalc users don't), let's talk about it for a minute. At its 
simplest, replicating is nothing more than copying a value contained in 
one cell into another cell. At its most complex, it involves copying the 
values, text, formulas, and functions in a range of cells into multiple 
ranges of cells. The range to be replicated can be either columns or rows. 
VisiCalc Advanced Version goes one step further, allowing you to repli- 
cate blocks (groups of columns and rows) once or even several times. 

Try to imagine a situation in which you have twenty-five columns of 
numbers and you have to total each column at the bottom. To accom- 
plish this, you could enter an ©SUM statement for each of the twenty-five 
columns. Or you could sum a single column and replicate the formula in- 
to the other twenty-four columns. 

Let's consider another example. Say you are completing a thirty-six- 
month cash-flow analysis that contains individual income and expense 
entries, separate income and expense totals, and a final cash-flow anal- 
ysis. With replicate, you'd simply enter the formulas for one month's 
analysis and replicate them into the remaining thirty-five months. Using

replicate is a real timesaver. 

In summary, replicate allows you to copy a cell entry into another 
cell, copy a cell entry into a number of cells, copy a row or a column into 
another row or column, copy a row into a series of rows, and copy a col- 
umn into a series of columns. In Advanced Version, replicate can also be 
used to copy a block into another block and to copy a block into a series 
of blocks. 

The replicate operation can be thought of as having two parts. The 
first of these is the definition of the source range (the cell or cells you want 
to copy) and the target range (where you want the copies to go). The sec- 
ond part of the operation comes into play only if you're replicating cells 
that contain references to other cells. In our example of summing col- 
umns, we would have to tell VisiCalc whether we wanted the cell refer- 
ences in each formula to refer to the original column or to the relative 
column (the column above each ©SUM statement). Obviously, in our 
example we want relative column summations. 

Advanced Version offers you two other options. In addition to cell 
formats, A dvanced Version has something called attributes; these are simi- 
lar to formats. You have the option of replicating attributes or formats 
only (ignoring the remaining contents of the cells), replicating the cell 
contents (ignoring the attributes or formats), or replicating the complete 
cell (that is, contents, formats, and attributes). 

With that introduction, let's take a simple example and see what we 
can discover about using replicate. Whenever you are learning VisiCalc, 
just remember that if you save your file just before you attempt some- 
thing that you aren't sure how to do, you can't hurt anything. No matter 
how bad you mess things up, all you have to do is clear the spreadsheet, 
reload your file, and start again. So don't be afraid to experiment — it's 
the best way to learn. 

The template we'll build is designed to help you balance your check- 
ing account. You'll be able to enter every check you write each month 
and then have VisiCalc automatically calculate the balance remaining in 
your account after each check has been dealt with. Compare this figure 
against the one recorded in your checkbook register and any difference 
will be obvious. 

If you've been reading this column regularly, you know what's next. 
Boot VisiCalc and let's play. 

We'll use column A for the check numbers. Go to A10 and enter the 
check number of the first check you want to record. This will probably 
be the check number following the last balance you verified as correct. 
For our example we'll start with check number 100. If you want to be 
consistent with our example, enter 100 for now and change it when you 
start on your own checkbook. 

You could enter 101 in All, 102 in A12, and so on, but entering 1 
through 200 would be a long process. Replicating makes it quick and 
painless. 

In Al 1, enter + A10+ 1. In Al 1, press /R. The prompt line (figure 1) re- 
quests the source range or return. The source range is what you want to 
replicate. It can be a single cell or a range of contiguous cells in either a 
column or a row. As we noted before, it can even be a block of cells if 
you are using Advanced Version. The requirement for the definition of the 
range is that it begin with a cell reference, followed by an ellipsis (three 



A11 (V) + A10+1 C! 
REPLICATE: SOURCE RANGE OR RETURN 34 
A11 | 



periods), followed by the ending cell reference. Since we're going to rep- 
licate only a single cell, the range will be All. ..All. Press return and 
VisiCalc will automatically enter the ellipsis and the final cell coordinate. 
You can enter the final cell coordinate automatically, as we just did, or 
you can enter it manually. 

VisiCalc now requests the target range. You can enter the target 
range manually, or you can point with the cursor keys to select the be- 
ginning and ending range cells. Try both methods. Use the arrow keys to 
move into A 12 and type a period. Notice that VisiCalc has again saved 
you time and effort by automatically entering the remaining two periods 
in the ellipsis. If we wished, we could now use the cursor keys to point at 
the final delimiter of the range. Instead, enter A209 and press return. Do- 
ing this saves time, since you've simply entered the coordinate rather than 
having to scroll to find it. Remember, you can save time and effort by se- 
lecting cells with the cursor, manually entering them, or doing a combi- 
nation of the two. 

If yours is an Apple II with 48K or less, choose a target range de- 
limiter of 109. Otherwise you might not have enough memory to com- 
plete the template. 

Figure 2 shows that VisiCalc has now prompted the cell coordinate 
in the formula we're replicating and is asking whether each replicated 
formula should contain the same cell reference (A10) or a relative refer- 
ence. In other words, will each successive cell in column A contain A 10 
(no change) or will each refer to the cell above it (A 12 to All, A 13 to 
A 12, and so on)? Since we want each cell to contain the next sequential 
check number, enter R for relative reference. If we press N for no 
change, each cell in the column will contain 101, and that's not what we 
want. 

Now press R for relative and see the result! If the formula in Al 1 had 
had multiple cell references (for example, +A10*BK3+ 1), we would 
have been prompted for relative or no change for each of the formula's 
cell references. 

Stop and think about the difference in how long it took replicate to 
accomplish what you've just done and how long it would have taken you 
to enter individual check numbers from 100 to 299. Believe in replicate 
yet? Stick around, it gets better. 

Now save your template on your data disk so we can try an experi- 
ment. Enter 300 in B10. We're going to make a second column, num- 
bered 300 to 499. But first, we will replicate to obtain check numbers 300 
through 310. Go to All and press /R.A20 return Bll. Remember, you 
could have selected either A20 or Bll using the cursor arrows. Notice 
that in this example we've selected a source range rather than an indi- 
vidual cell, and a single target cell rather than a range of cells. 

Press return and once again you're prompted for no change or rela- 
tive. Which should we do? We're starting a new column; if we press N, the 
formula in Bll will be + A 10+1, and that's not what we want, is it? The 
thing to do is to press R, because we want the formulas in column B to 
be relative to B10. But now we have something new. We're being 
prompted for no change or relative for the coordinate All. Why? Be- 
cause VisiCalc is replicating each formula in the source range A11...A20 
into the corresponding cell in column B. You can imagine that it will 
take a while to select N or R for each cell, especially if you're replicating

a column containing a hundred or more formulas. Continue to press R 
until the replication is complete. If you enter too many Rs, pressing es- 
cape returns things to normal. 

Is there an easier way? Of course there is, but there's a qualification. 
If you're replicating a single formula into the target column, you can do 
it by an easier method than the one you just tried (we'll get to that short- 
ly). But, if you're trying to replicate a column (or a row, for that matter) 
that contains different formulas, you'll have to select N or R for each cell 
reference in the column. Our cash-flow analysis is an example of that 
type of replication. 

When you're trying to remember whether to select a single cell or a 
range to replicate, think about what you are trying to replicate. If you 
have to enter a range to include all individual formulas, you need to se- 
lect a range for the source and just the beginning cell for the target. If all 
the formulas are the same (with only relative reference differences), you 
need only a single cell for the source and a range that defines the target. 

Before completing column B let's remove the values in Bl 1 through 
B20. We could blank each cell, or we could even ignore them and repli- 
cate over them. But since we're learning about replicate, let's use it. Go to 
A9 and press /R return B11.B20 return. Magically, the cells have been 
blanked! You have replicated a blank cell. This is another way replicate 
can save time and effort. 

One more experiment and we'll return to the project at hand. Go to 
Al 1 and press /R.A20 return Bl 1. Looks familiar so far. Enter .CI 1 as 
the end of the target range, press return, and begin pressing R as each ref- 
erence requires an N or R selection. If you press too many Rs, just press 
escape until things return to normal. Notice that you have just replicated 
one column into two others. Didn't take very long, did it? 

Column C starts with a 1 in CI 1, while B contains 301. Why the dif- 
ference? The formula in CI 1 is +C10+1. Since CIO is blank, 1 is the cor- 
rect value. Enter 500 in CIO and see the results. 

Save your file again and then see if you can complete columns B and 
C. You have learned a couple of methods that will accomplish this. In 



fact, you might try it one way, clear the spreadsheet, load your file again, 
and try completing it using the other method. When you finish, your 
template should look like figure 3.

We now have 600 check numbers to make use of. Go to D9 and en- 
ter the balance in your account for the check prior to the check number 
in A10. In our example, the check register balance for check 99 is $1,000, 
so we'll enter 1000 in D9. 

Jf you don't like waiting while VisiCalc recalculates after each entry, 
turn off automatic recalculation by pressing /GRM. Just remember that 
the only ways to ensure the accuracy of any displayed values are to return 
to automatic recalculation (/GRA) or press the exclamation mark. 

Move to B10 and insert a blank column (/IC). Insert another col- 
umn between columns C and D and another between columns E and F. 
These are the columns in which the individual check amounts will be en- 
tered. To help clarify each column's use, enter CHECK # in cells A8, C8, 
and E8. Enter AMOUNT in B8, D8, and F8. Enter BALANCE in G8, 
18, and K8. Remember, you can use replicate. 

Next, we'll calculate a running account balance in column G. G9 al- 
ready has our beginning balance of $1,000. In G10 we want to calculate 
the balance for a check amount entered in B10. The formula should be 
beginning balance less check amount. Enter +G9— B10 in G10. Enter 10 
in B10 and the result in G10 should be 990 (don't forget to recalculate). 
Save your file to the data disk. 

Next, replicate the formula in G10 into the remaining part of col- 
umn G (through cell G210). Should both of the references be no change 
or relative? Or should one be no change and one relative? Since each to- 
tal is based on the check amount of the current check and the check to- 
tal of the prior check, enter R for both references. 

After completing the replication, move slowly down column G for 
five to ten cells to ensure that both cell references increment (indicating 
relative reference) in each cell. You should do this any time you replicate 
formulas to ensure that you have accomplished it successfully. If the cells 
increment correctly, you can be assured that the formulas in the remain- 
der of the column are also correct. As a backup, you might enter differ- 
ent check amounts in column B and check the result in column G. If you 
don't get what you expect, clear the file, load it, and try again. 

Next we should complete the balances for checks 300 through 700. 
Replicate the formula in G10 into 110 and K10. Relative or no change? 
You might wonder why we selected columns I and K for the balances. 
The reason is that they have the same reference to their individual check 
amount columns as column G (that is, the respective amount column is 
five columns to the left for all three balance columns). This relationship al- 
lows you to replicate the balance formula into 110 and K10 using rela- 
tive reference. 

Now replicate both formulas down each column (relative reference 
again) and we are almost through. 

There are two things left to do. First, the columns need to be ordered 
so that the check numbers, check amounts, and balances are in proper 
sequence. We could have entered them in the proper sequence initially, 
but replicate is faster if you replicate into columns or rows that are to- 
gether. If you have a number of columns that require the same formulas, 
you can replicate into a range of columns and then move the columns 
(with /M) to their appropriate positions. 

To move a column, go to G8 and press /M (G8 is automatically dis- 
played as the source column). Press .C8 and return. Move column I to

Last, if the template is to work correctly, it must have correct bal-

Don't worry about all the 990s in column C. Every time you enter a 
check amount, the balance will change to reflect the different total. If 
you'd like to have it display 0 until a check amount is entered in the 
appropriate amount cell, there's an easy way to make that happen. A 
prior column explains @IF, but the formula in CI 1 would be 
@IF(B11>0,(C10-B11),0). If you replicate that formula using relative 
reference, 0 will be displayed until a value is entered in the amount 
column for that check. 

No Change? You're probably wondering what this no change stuff is 
about and where it might be used. It isn't used nearly as often as relative, 



but there are times it is necessary. A sales/income statement forecast 
would be a perfect example. You might want your forecast sales and/or 
expenses to grow at specific rates. To complete our discussion of the first 
period's formulas, sales and expense formulas will reference two cells 
that contain as variables the sales and the expenses growth rates. When 
you replicate these formulas for each subsequent period, these cell refer- 
ences will require no change. Thus, changing the sales growth rate in ei- 
ther variable cell affects the respective growth value in every period. 

Replication Tips. Before we close, here are a few tips for using repli- 
cation that are worth remembering. 

Older versions of VisiCalc don't have an edit command. That means 
that sometimes the complete formula isn't visible in the entry contents 
line. If you want to see what's in a cell, replicating it allows you to see the 
complete formula displayed as you are prompted for relative and no 
change. Be sure to write the formula down as it's displayed. Afterward, 
simply blank the cell to return to the original template. 

If you're going to use a formula similar to one you've used already 
and you don't want to reenter it, simply replicate it and then edit the 
changes. This can be especially useful when you're working with com- 
plex formulas because most of the entry is already complete and you may 
have to make only minor changes. 

Advanced Version users can use replicate to simulate a block move. 
All you have to do is replicate the block to the destination range, ensur- 
ing that all references to cells outside the block are no change and that 
all references to cells inside the block are relative. Important — you must 
ensure that any cell references referencing into the block from elsewhere 
on the spreadsheet be changed to reflect the new cell references! Then 
blank the original block (using replicate, if you wish) and you have a 
block move. 

To Replicate or Not? No Question! Now that we've completed this 
template, imagine how long it would have taken without using replicate. 
To replicate or not is not the question! The question is, how many differ- 
ent ways can you use replicate to save yourself time and trouble? The an- 
swer the more you look, the more ways you'll find. Hi

APRIL 1983 




My fivonie V 



Apple II owners were of one mind in So/talk's annual Most Popular 
Software poll. The problem was that the one mind contradicted itself. 
Adding to the confusion was a So/talk foul-up on the eligibility 
requirements. 

Choplifter and/or Wizardry won, depending on whom you talk to 
and what gauge you use. Actually, they both won, which was almost an 
impossibility given the structure of the balloting. 

Apple owners were asked to select their ten favorite programs re- 



for All-Time 
Pops 

leased in late 1981 or during 1982. Then they were asked to nominate just 
one program as their all-time favorite from all the software ever released 
for the Apple. 

Votes for the most popular program of 1982 were weighted accord- 
ing to their rank on the ballot, with first-place votes being awarded ten 
points and tenth-place votes being awarded one point. 

Using that tabulating system, VisiCalc: Advanced Version was the 
most popular Apple III program, and Broderbund's Choplifter was the 



APRIL 1983 



SOCTAl U

overwhelming winner as the best Apple II program released in 1982. Dan 
Gorlin's debut effort scored on more than 50 percent of the ballots, 
showing its wide acceptance by Apple users with varying tastes. It was 
mentioned on 374 more ballots than the runner-up. 
In short, Choplifter' % victory was a landslide. 
In second place was none other than Wizardry, Sir-tech's bellwether 
program from Andrew Greenberg and Robert Woodhead. It scored an 
additional 227-vote margin over the third-place program. So it was clear- 
ly Choplifter and Wizardry in that order for 1982. 

Then came the tabulation of votes for the all-time favorite. The vote 
was even more decisive. Wizardry won. It was a rout. Wizardry got more 
than double the votes of second-place VisiCalc. Wizardry got quadruple 
the votes of Choplifter, which finished fourth. 

So how could the voters recon- 
cile placing Choplifter ahead of Wiz- 
ardry in one vote and behind in 
another? Common threads of rea- 
soning ran through the comments: 
"Choplifter has the best graphics 
ever. It's too bad you can't con- 
tinue the game after saving all the 
hostages." "Wizardry gets my vote 
because of the depth of play. And 
it's the master for the following 
scenarios." 

In other words, Choplifter was 
stunning, but when you're done, 
you're done. With Wizardry, when 
you're done, you're just waiting for 
another scenario to be released. 
Choplifter was king in '82; Wiz- 
ardry is the program for all seasons. 

Softalk added a confusion fac- 
tor of its own, by listing as eligible 
contenders several programs that 
weren't. These included Locksmith 4.1, Screen Writer II, PFS: File, Apple 
Writer II, Global Program Line Editor, and Flight Simulator. All except 
Flight Simulator 'had undergone revision during the eligibility period and 
were included by virtue of the announcements of their transfiguration. 
Nobody knows how Flight Simulator made the list of eligibles. 

Disqualifying those programs is consistent with the rules applied in 
previous years. Last year, VisiCalc underwent an extensive revision and 
enhancement but was excluded from the balloting. VisiCalc: Advanced 
Version was eligible in the Apple III voting this year because it is a sepa- 
rate program from VisiCalc III. 

The reasoning behind the rule is that programs with longer market- 
ing windows will probably do better in a poll than those just recently 
brought to market. Because the poll is intended to reflect the owners' 
opinions of the best new software, prior releases are excluded. To do dif- 
ferently this year would do an injustice to programs deserving a spot on 
the Top Thirty. 

But disqualifying those programs, all of which ended up on the Top 
Thirty, invalidates a few thousand votes. 

Lacking a Solomon to propose cutting the baby in two, Softalk hit 
upon a solution certain to be unsatisfactory to everyone. The votes were 
all counted and the programs ranked regardless of eligibility. Then only 
the eligible programs were numbered. 

That means you'll see Locksmith 4.1 listed third in the Top Thirty, 
but Cannonball Blitz gets the number-three rating. Locksmith 4. 1 and the 
other ineligible programs get an asterisk instead of a rating. But they are 
placed in the correct order so you can see how the voters evaluated them. 

A word of caution about the results printed here. They reflect only 
programs released during the last three months of 1981 or during 1982, 
with the exceptions already noted. The omission of such programs as 
VisiCalc, DB Master, and Castle Wolfenstein is not a reflection of their 
popularity, but merely reflects their ineligibility due to longevity in the 
marketplace. 

Voters named 848 separate titles on their ballots. Some weren't eligi- 
ble, such as the three just cited. But that number's an indication of the 



strength of the Apple market. No other computer or operating system 
had anywhere near as many new entries in the past year. Even more to 
the point, a majority of the programs listed got more than two votes, 
which means somebody besides the author and his mother voted for it. 

From the standpoint of bulk, arcade games represented the largest 
segment of new efforts, although the total was considerably less than 30 
percent. Utilities, business applications, and educational programs also 
had a significant number of different entries. Following were strategy 
games, home applications, adventure games, word processors, fantasy 
games, and Apple III software. 

Games dominated the most popular program of 1982 votes. Only five 
nonentertainment programs made the Top Thirty. There was consider- 
ably more balance in the all-time list: seventeen entertainment programs 
to thirteen applications programs. 

Arcade games led the all-time list with ten entries. Four packages

came from each of the fantasy games, business applications, word proc- 
essing, and utility categories. Two adventures, one strategy game, and 
one home applications package concluded the list. 

Apparently, good fantasy authors are worth their weight in gold. On 
the all-time list, only fantasy authors were able to replicate their success. 
Greenberg and Woodhead had Wizardry and Knight of Diamonds. Lord 
British had Ultima and Ultima II. 

Several authors were hot in 1982, putting two programs on the 
charts. Greenberg and Woodhead had their Wizardry double feature, 
Olaf Lubeck had Cannonball Blitz and Frogger, Paul Stephenson wrote 
Swashbuckler and Aztec, David Snider created Serpentine and David's 
Midnight Magic, and Jim Nitchals had Bug Attack and a shared credit 
on Microwave. Chris Jochumson shared credit for both Graphics Ma- 
gician and The Arcade Machine. Ken Williams shared credit for Thresh- 
old and Time Zone. 

In addition to his authoring efforts, it was a very good year for Ken 
Williams the publisher. Sierra On-Line had six programs among 1982's 
tops and four programs among the all-time favorites. Both were high 
marks for publishers. 

Broderbund scored second on the publishing front. They had five 
programs among last year's favorites and two packages on the all-time

list. DataMost had three hit packages last year, two of which also made 
the all-time list. Obviously, Sir-tech placed two entries on each list. 

There were no other publishers with dual entries on the all-time list. 
On the 1982 list, Sirius Software, Infocom, and Cavalier Software each 
had two entries. 

The all-time list had some surprises other than the Wizardry-Choplift- 
er reversal. VisiCalc was no surprise in second, but Castle Wolfensteirfs 
third-place showing is unprecedented. Last year it placed second to Ras- 
ter Blaster for program of 1981. That's a stunning showing over two 
years for any entertainment program. In contrast, Raster Blaster dropped 
from first in 1981 to eleventh of all time. Wizardry was seventh in the 
1981 program contest, after being in distribution for just less than three 
months. 

Ultima II was the second strongest fantasy program of all time, al- 
though it ran third to Knight of Diamonds for 1982. Ultima, not eligible 
for 1982 balloting, also topped Knight of Diamonds for all-time honors. 

Neil Konzen's Global Program Line Editor would have been tied for 
twenty-first for 1982 had it not been disqualified. But it jumped to eighth 
on the all-time list, reflecting one comment that "you can't be a pro- 
grammer if you don't have GPLE." The eighth-place all-time vote is the 
highest ever for a utility package. 

Zork I, not eligible in 1982, was the runaway adventure leader of all 
time. DB Master, also not a 1982 candidate, was tenth, a higher showing 
than its fourteenth place in the 1981 poll. Aztec showed strength, going 
from a 1982 rating of twenty-sixth to an all-time rating of eighteenth. The 
currently red-hot educational market is too new to have captured 
owners' hearts in the all-time balloting. 

Softalk Publishing made the awards last month at the West Coast 
Computer Faire. VisiCalc was a double winner. It also took top honors 
among IBM Personal Computer programs. Star Raiders won as best 
program ever on the Atari. 

The specialized lists reflect Softalk's monthly Bestseller format with a 
few exceptions: The disqualified programs are shown with an asterisk in- 
stead of a position rating. The strategy and adventure lists are fleshed out

to ten to reflect the strong voting for programs of this type. The fantasy 
list is extended to eight for the same reason. The arcade list actually con- 
tinues the list of arcade games in the Top Thirty. Eighteen arcade games 
made the Top Thirty, making a list of the top ten rather redundant. In- 
stead, the nineteenth through twenty-eighth programs in that genre are 
listed. 

There were other dynamite new programs for the Apple III as well as 
VisiCalc: Advanced Version. Quark Engineering put three titles on the 
list Word Juggler, Catalyst, and Lexicheck. Software Publishing Corpo- 
ration added PFS.File and PFS.Report. Apple came up with Quick File 
III and Senior Analyst III. VersaForm and Great Plains Hardisk Account- 
ing Series were the other owner choices. 

Two new database programs paced the business list — dBase II and 
General Manager. Multiplan gained fifth with very little 1982 exposure; it 
will be eligible for the 1983 vote as well. Although it was not listed and 
was not eligible, dozens of voters could not refrain from casting ballots 
for VisiCalc. It scored second to PFS. File among all business programs. 
DB Master got enough votes for sixth, even though it wasn't eligible 
either. 

Sensible Speller led all eligible word processing programs. Word Han- 
dler was second and PIE Writer third.

gician paced the 1982 programs. Beagle Bros put three programs on the 
utility list. Their ineligible DOS Boss would have placed eleventh. 

Among home applications, Home Accountant remained dominant. 
The surprise of the list was the seventh-place showing of Brook Boer- 
ing's revolutionary Ceemac. It's not been known as a commercial suc- 
cess, but it's sure popular among those owning it. The Accountant was in- 
eligible for 1982 balloting, but showed its strength by garnering more 
votes than ninth-place DataFax. 

Tax Preparer from Howardsoft would have been tenth on the Home 
list had it been eligible. But the showing of tax packages in general was 
mystifying. Thousands were sold last year. Only a handful were voted for 
this year.

pack, with Terrapin's version a distant second but well ahead of all other 
educational programs. Most of the entries have been making commer- 
cial waves lately. MasterType, a monthly sales leader among education- 
al programs, was a 1981 product that would have been third. 

There were few surprises, but some portents among the arcade prod- 
ucts. The thirty-first program was Bill Budge's Pinball Construction Set 
that was sold for only a few weeks before this survey was conducted. 
Making considerable waves was Miner 2049er, which had even fewer 
sales days in 1982. Both are eligible for the 1983 poll and figure to place 
strongly. 

After months of taking a back seat to the text adventures, hi-res ad- 
ventures got new recognition. Time Zone led the 1982 voting, The Mask 
of the Sun was fourth, and four other graphic adventures scored highly. 
Infocom didn't suffer much with its text adventures, however; it placed 
second, third, fifth, and seventh. 

The fantasy ranks were the thinnest. Only eight programs received 
significant support. David Mullich appears determined to give the 
Greenberg-Woodhead combo and Lord British a run for their money. 
His Prisoner 2 was fourth and his Empire I: World Builders was eighth. 

Castle Wolfenstein and Flight Simulator continue to sit atop the 
strategy list, but neither were 1982 programs. Avant-Garde's Hi-Res 
Computer Golf took top honors. But the category actually belonged to

Strategic Simulations and Mind Systems in 1982. SSI published five of 
the strategy winners; Mind Systems had two leaders. 

The single outstanding feature of the survey was the vitality of the 
Apple software market in all its applications. For every rumor that a par- 
ticular publisher was switching to the Atari or IBM Personal Computer, 
two new programs appeared. 

One of the industry pros returned a partially completed ballot with 
the comment that "in retrospect, 1982 wasn't a very good year." Dozens 
of consumers contradicted that viewpoint with comments on how good 
1982 was. Both views are probably accurate. There wasn't much break- 
through software in 1982. But there was a diversity of high-quality appli- 
cations and entertainment software to address even the tiniest market 
niche. 

The Apple market looks alive and well.

SOt TA I V 



APRIL 1983 




Plotting preshifted shapes from Basic, as we did last month, sort of 
defeats their purpose. Preshifted shapes are designed for speed. Basic 
isn't; at least not when it comes to graphics. So this month we'll look at 
building larger preshifted shapes (larger than last month's hi-res dot), 
and voyage back into the world of machine language for some of the 
coding. 

First, a Shape. We'll do a fairly easy shape so that the amount of 
data we generate doesn't wreak havoc on the proofreaders and the less 
proficient typists. This is your chance to shine with creativity, however. 
Almost all the shapes in all the arcade games you play are created in this 
form, so make up the shape you want, plot it out, and watch it animate 
at the end of this article. 

Last month's column hinted that there is a technique for creating and 
animating a shape that allows you to omit the erase cycle of the usual 
draw-update-erase animation. There is, and it speeds up your animation 
considerably. Since we're just putting bytes onto the screen, we can cause 
a shape to erase its old image at the same time as the new image is being 
plotted if we know the maximum single movement of the shape. That is, 
if we know, for example, that in any single move a shape will go no more 
than two dots in any direction, we can create a two-dot border that is the 
color of the background around the shape. Technically, the two-dot bor- 
der is part of the shape. Visibly, it isn't. 

Figure 1 shows a box shape preshifted across three bytes. Note that, 
although the box is less than two bytes wide, when the border is in- 
cluded and the shape is shifted through its seven possible positions rela- 
tive to the byte boundaries, we need the extra byte as part of the 
definition. 

You'll notice that, in defining the boxes, we also played some games 
with a horizontal line cutting through the middle of the box. Remember 
that when using preshifted shapes, the shape selected from the table 
will depend on the desired horizontal position of the image on the 
screen. We can take advantage of the need for seven preshifts by modi- 
fying each preshift slightly to cause the object to animate as it moves. A 
man walking can have his legs moving as he moves across the screen, 
helicopter blades can swirl, lights and radars on a spaceship can blink and 
turn, and on and on. In a way, it's double animation, with the shape 
moving smoothly around the screen and the shape itself animated 
as well. 

Okay. But that doesn't explain why those lines in the boxes seem 
oddly out of sequence. The intention is for the line to scroll vertically in- 
side the box while the box moves. Shouldn't the line move in smaller in- 
crements between frames? Well, it does. 

Two Dot or Not Two Dot? We're going to animate the box in two- 
dot moves. Besides making the box move faster around the screen, 
there's a very good reason for moves in multiples of two. Odd-numbered 
horizontal movements mess up any colors you might have. Bits that were 
in even columns (blue or violet) get put in odd columns (orange or 



green), and vice versa. Your shape definition can contain every Apple 
color at once, including blended colors such as those used in the fill rou- 
tines. So to keep colors consistent as the shape is moved around, it's 
usually advisable to move in twos. The result is that, instead of the 
shapes animating in a 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 sequence, they animate in a 
1,3,5,7,2,4,6 sequence. If you look at the shapes in figure 1 again, you'll 
see that this order moves that little line inside the box in much shorter 
steps. 

The hexadecimal numbers defined by the shape are shown alongside 
the shape itself. For our plotting routine, we need the width and height of 
the shape in bytes (3 by 12). To speed up access to the individual shapes, 
we'll also store offsets in the table that point to the start of each of the 
seven shapes in the table. 

Here's the format of the table: 

The first fourteen bytes (starting address + 0 through starting address 
+ 1 3) hold the two-byte offsets for each of the seven shapes, telling the 
routine what to add to the starting address of the table in order to find 
the address of the individual shape needed. 

Bytes 14 and 15 hold the height and width of the shape, in bytes. 

Getting Into Shape. Starting at byte 16 (starting address + 15), the 
byte values define each of the seven shapes, row by row, as illustrated in 
figure 1. 

The first sixteen bytes of the table that describes our 3 by 12 shape are 
shown in figure 2. Note that, no matter what the size of the shape, the 
offset to the first shape is always 16 since the first shape always starts at 
the end of the list of offsets, at the starting address + 16. Sixteen is 00 10 
in two-byte hexadecimal. Since the width and height are 3 and 12, 3 times 
1 2 gives the length of each individual shape, in bytes, and we can find the 
other offsets by adding this length to each previous offset. The second 
offset is 16 plus 36, or 52, or 00 34 in hexadecimal. The third is 52 plus 36, 
or 88, and so on. If hexadecimal makes you queasy use the short pro- 
gram in listing 1 to compute and poke in the first sixteen values for any 
shape you make. 

After you enter the first sixteen bytes, you have to enter the shape

Figure 3. Entering the shape table. 



data itself. By following the steps in figure 3, you can enter all the data di- 
rectly into memory. Note by the addresses that we started the table at ad- 
ress $8000 hex, or 32768 base 10. The last step is to bsave your shape with 
the command: 

BSAVE BOX,A$8000,L268 

The length of the table is computed by taking the length of each 
shape, times 7, and then adding 16 (for the first sixteen bytes). Or, just 
given the width and height of the shape (in bytes): 

Width X Height X 7 + 16 

All of this, by the way, is much more easily done through graphics 
editors that do all the calculations and setup of shapes. Die-hards may 
still enter a lot of the values directly in hexadecimal, but there are utili- 
ties to do much of this work for you. 

The machine language shape-plotting routine is given in listing 2. It is 
similar in function to the plotting program we did in Basic last month, 
except it allows shapes that are more than one byte long. It is set up so 
that you relate the X and Y coordinates at which you want to plot the 
shape by poking those values into zero-page locations 4 and 2 
respectively. 

The first thing the routine does (lines 14 through 25) is a quick divi-

TIRED OF ALL THE 
"EXCEPT FOR..."S? 

r ITH THE NEW PRINTOGRAPHER 
GRAPHICS PRINTING SYSTEM, 
WE'VE GOT YOU COVERED! 



PONTGCDAPHED 




PRICE: $49.95 

(Colifornio Residents odd 6% soles tax.) 
Plus S2 50 Shipping 

The PRINTOGRAPHER is designed to fill all of your graphic printing needs, 
without having to worry about running into the problem of it almost work- 
ing, "except on your printer", or "except for the lack of that particular 
feature". Whether you have a daisy wheel or dot matrix printer, the stan- 
dard version of PRINTOGRAPHER works on any printer and interface com- 
bination with graphics capabilities. In many cases, this includes printers you 
may not even have thought could print graphics. 

Just a FEW of the possible printers include- EPSON, PAPER TIGER, APPLE 
DMP, PRISM, C. ITOH, GEMINI, BASE 2, ANADEX, NEC, DIABLO, QUME, MPI, 
5ILENTYPE, OKIDATA, MALIBIL interface cards include: APPLE, SSM, CCS, 
MTN COMP. CPS, MPI, GRAPPLER, TYMAC, PROMETHEUS and more! 

In addition to versatile print options (easy cropping, variable magnifica- 
tions, normal/reverse inking, vertical/horizontal format, etc.) PRINTO- 
GRAPHER offers such unique features as the ability to print pictures directly 
from disk (without loading a file), spooling via our DOUDLETIME PRINTER 
package, or sending pictures over a phone line using ASCII EXPRESS. You 
can even put graphics in your text documents with our text editor soft- 
ware, THE CORRESPONDENT. As if that wasn't enough, we've mode it 
easy to put the PRINTOGRAPHER routines right in your own programs to 
do Hi-Res printing immediately during their operation, without having to 
save screen images to disk! 

We also know you see o lot of advertising these days for a truly over- 
whelming volume of software, all claiming to be the best, so we moke 
this simple guarantee: 

IF YOU CAN FIND A BETTER PACKAGE THAN (OR ARE AT ALL UNSATISFIED 
WITH) THE PRINTOGRAPHER WITHIN 30 DAYS OF PURCHASE. SIMPLY 
RETURN THE PACKAGE FOR A COMPLETE REFUND. NO QUESTIONS ASKED! 

For more information, see your local dealer, or write SOUTHWESTERN DATA 
SYSTEMS for a free catalog. If your dealer is out of stock we can ship 
PRINTOGRAPHER to him within 24 hours of a call to our offices. 

REMEMBER, WITH PRINTOGRAPHER. YOU'RE PICTURE PERFECT!

sion by 7 to determine the X bit and X byte that the X location you used 
corresponds to. The division routine goes through a loop that subtracts 7 
from the X value until the result is smaller than 7. The number of sub- 
tractions (counted in the Y register) is the quotient, giving the X byte, 
and the number left over (in the accumulator) is the remainder, or the 
X bit. 

From there the routine pulls the height and width out of the table, 
then, using 2 times the X bit value, finds the location of the offset values 
for the desired shape. The offset is added to the starting address of the 
table, giving the starting location of the shape definition to be used. The 
address is then inserted into the machine code (at BLOCK1 + 1 and 
BLOCK 1 +2). This is called self-modifying code; the program actually re- 
writes part of itself, in this case an address. The advantage gained here is 
in speed. Sometimes the technique is also used to keep programming 
code short. 

A Loopy Pair. The rest of the routine is a pair of loops that puts each 
row of bytes onto the screen while counting down the screen vertically. 
We use the Y lookup table for finding the starting address of each screen 
line once again. 

This routine was originally written with David Lubar and is partially 
used in Graphics Magician. Much of what has been used this month and 
last is the result of things discovered with Lubar and with Chris Jochum- 
son (who wrote the Arcade Machine), both of whom are to be com- 
mended for their very open attitudes about programming "secrets" that 
they've discovered. The people who've helped them deserve thanks too, 
for techniques tend to develop over several generations of use. Sharing 
techniques and information greatly benefits the quality of the 
marketplace. 

The last listing this month puts all these techniques together. Listing 3 
is a basic program that loads the Shape Plot routine, the Y lookup table 
(at $7000), and the box shape we created (or any other shape that you de- 
sign). Line 50 pokes in the X and Y coordinates and calls the routine. 
Line 60 reads the paddles, and lines 70 and 80 compute the new X and Y 
values. Note that the weird expressions in the latter two lines use an in- 
teresting little fact: an expression such as (XP < 80) generates a value of 1 
if true, or a value of 0 if false. You can use that 0 or 1 in a computation! 
In line 70, for example, the equation evaluates as follows: 
If XP < 80, the joystick is to the left: 

X = X - (2 * 1) + (2 * 0), which is X - 2. 
If XP is between 80 and 160, the joystick is in the middle: 

X = X - (2 * 0) + (2 * 0), which is X. 
And if XP > 160, the joystick is to the right: 

X = X - (2 * 0) + (2 * 1), which is X + 2. 
Neat, huh? 

One last note: the Basic routine is written to accept values between 0 
and 255 for X and Y. That means that if you let the shape go too far to 
the right, or up to the top of the screen, you'll get an error — the program 
just stops. Once again, Basic becomes cumbersome. The reason is that 
poke statements only accept values from 0 to 255 (the values that fit in a 
byte). To get an idea of how fast the animation can go from Basic, we've 
left out any if statements or value checks. Unfortunately, the more Basic 
statements you add, the more you slow down the animation. An al- 
ternative solution to the speed problem is to perform the movement cal- 
culations in machine language, or to have the movements pregenerated 
in a path table. Either way you can easily increase the speed enough for 
the routine to be driven from Basic, although you still have to be careful 
about how much code you put into an animation loop. HI

A hundred times a day, you type L-I-S-T and 
your Applesoft Listings dutifully appear on 
your monitor... then promptly scroll off of the 
screen into Hyper-Space. If the program line 
you are looking for goes by, you must LIST 
AGAIN to read it. There's a better way... 
8-WAY SCROLLING: Nowyou can list your pro- 
grams (all or part) with the added ability to 
CHANGE LIST-DIRECTION using the Apple Arrow 
Keys. The monitor becomes a "Search Window" to 
be moved UP AND DOWN through a listing at will. 

IMPROVED LIST-FORMAT;* (optional) Each 
program statement is listed on a new line for easy 
tracing of program flow, and PAST de-bugging. 
Commands are properly-spaced (one space be- 
tween words, not two) and much easier to follow.

at Machine-Language speed, directly from the LIST command. For-

Called Jack, this software package 
for the Apple II includes a word pro- 
cessor, mailing list, a personal-file 
system and calculator routines. All of 
the routines are integrated into one 
package, not as a collection of sepa- 
rate programs. 

The word-processing capability in- 
cludes the creation of formatted re- 
cords with items that require calcula- 
tion being automatically computed 
and included as the document is pre- 
pared. The record-keeping routines 
handle records that range in size from 
the data for a mailing label to one that 
stores text from up to 69 sheets of 
legal-size paper. 

Up to 1000 records, depending on 
individual record size, can be handled 
on one diskette. 



February, 1983 



NEW SOFTWARE IS JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES 

The Incredible Jack, a four-applications-in-one software 
package for the Apple II computer, has just been introduced by 
Business Solutions. Jack offers a personal filer, calc package. 

J and word processing and mailing label capabilities in one 

1 package. 

"Jack combines the convenience of a personal filer with the 
power of a calc package, and handles most word-processing 
tasks, providing all of the functions that people usually want 
from a personal computer," says Alan Dziejma. president of 
Business Solutions. "Jack turns your computer into a jack-of- 
all-trades by performing all functions with a simple integrated 
set of commands. Besides being easier to learn, these 
functions can be combined in a single task." 

Jack's unique features let users create letters and reports 
with embedded calculations, the company says. The word 
processing capability enables the creation of neatly formatted 
records and can include items that are automatically calculated 
as the document is being prepared. 

Needing only a few simple commands, the word-processing 
functions create letters, memos and reports. Jack also inserts, 
deletes and copies text with automatic word wrap and flush- . 
right margins. C, 

Users can arrange information in files they design them- 
selves using Jack's personal filer. The records can be as small 
as a mailing label or as large as 60 sheets of legal-size paper. 

The calc features let users build decision-making logic into 
their files. With English language calculation rules and power- 
ful IF/THEN/ELSE function, it is possible to perform 
complex calculations instantly. 



NEW SOFTWARE FOR THE APPLE // e 
DOES THE WORK OF THREE PROGRAMS 
FOR THE PRICE OF ONE 

Are you on a budget? Do the functions of file management, 
word processing, and calculation pretty much cover what you 
want out of your computer? Do you find that specialized 
programs in these areas often cost too much, take too long to 
leam or to keep current, and do more than you really need? 
Does having to load one program after another into memory as 
you go through the day get you down? Well, there may be one 
program in all computerdom that will make you happy: The 
Incredible Jack, from Business Solutions. Inc., for an Apple 
//e or Apple II Plus with 64K RAM and two disk drives 

Our test of Jack showed you could just load it into your 
computer and leave it there all day. Say you start a business 
letter, and halfway through, a client calls with a question 
Saving your letter on disk, you switch to the file management 
function, get the data you need, switch to the logic function, 
get the calculations you need - give your client one-call 
turnaround on his question - and return to your letter without 
ever leaving your program! 

A relative newcomer to computing became comfortable 
with Jack (working through the manual's tutorial) in an hour, 
with only occasional help. An experienced computer user took 
even less. In five hours you should be flying with Jack, 
regardless of your background, thanks to the 57 diskette-size 
pages of tutorial. The comprehensive 67-page reference sec- 
tion will help you thereafter. The reference section includes a 
troubleshooting guide, calculation templates, index, and more. 

For $129 you get a remarkable program specializing in the 
generalist's needs. Jack lets you adapt the computer to your 
work flow, freely using the various functions as needed. . . if 
Jack's functions fit your needs, no combination of single- 
function programs will fill those needs at anywhere near Jack's 
price.

WH T A I I 



Vol. 3, February, 1983 



The Jack of Apples. The appearance of The Incredible Jack from 
Business Solutions among the He specific software is almost a travesty. If 
there were any justice, Business Solutions would be the only company 
making a software announcement. This is the single current program 
that from the conception stages was intended for the He only. When 
Apple's development time on the new machine became extended, Busi- 
ness Solutions retrofitted it to the II Plus. 

The Incredible Jack draws its name from your ordinary garden-vari- 
ety jack-of-all-trades. That's what this program is: a spreadsheet, a data- 
base, and a word processor in one integrated package. It's the Apple and 
eight-bit answer to MBA and 1-2-3, widely heralded and praised soft- 
ware packages for the IBM pc.

Low-Cost Apple" Jack" of All Trades 



nAn easy-to-use, very low-cost pack- 
age for the Apple II Plus combines 
simple spreadsheet analysis, fairly advanced 
word processing for reports and memos, a 
versatile mail list manager, and a very good 
personal filing system. Called jack, this 
program is the only fully integrated package 
available for the Apple II; other new inte- 
grated products work on the IBM PC or larger 
machines. JACK costs $129, very inexpen- 
sive for a program with its capabilities. 

JACK can also serve double duty as a good 
computer literacy package for novices or 



new users who can graduate to more power- 
ful packages later. 

Recommendation: Managers with Apples 
and especially start-up users should see if 
jack's capabilities meet current needs. 
jack has a two- week money-back guarantee, 
and requires a 64K Apple with two disk 
drives.

Four applications in one. 

The Incredible Jack combines the 
convenience of a personal filer with the 
power of a calc package. It handles 
most word processing tasks with ease. 
Toss in the ability to sort and print 
mailing labels, and you have a totally 
integrated, suprisingly easy to use 
package that does most of what you 
bought your Apple for. 

Organize information your way. 

The Incredible Jack lets you arrange 
your information in "records" you design 
yourself using the computer display 
Each record may be as little as a mailing 
label or as large as 60 sheets of legal 
sized paper. 

Word processing made easy. 

With a few simple commands you can 



master in minutes, you can create 
letters, memos and reports. To help 
you edit, Jack lets you insert, delete, 
and copy portions of text all with 
automatic word wrap and flush right 
margins. The Jack does away with the 
mind boggling control codes and 
formatting options of other word 
processing packages. 

Automatic decision making. 

Jack even allows you to build decison 
making logic into your file. With 
English language rules and a powerful 
IF THEN ELSE function, you can 
instantly calculate complex discount 
tables, commission plans, contract 
terms, or tax rates. 

See for yourself. 

Try Jack. (You'll need an Apple II 



with 16K memory extension and 2 
disks.) If you're not convinced it's the 
best investment you've made since you 
bought your Apple, send Jack back 
in good condition within 2 weeks 
for a full refund.

How do stock market analysts value securities? How do they decide 
that a stock is priced too high, or too low? 

If you were to bring together the top five analysts in a given industry 
and ask each to pick the stock he thought would be the top performer, 
you'd probably get five different answers. 

One of the analysts you queried might be a fundamentalist. The 
strength of a company as reflected in its financial statements would be 
that analyst's key criterion. Another analyst might be a technician who 
would chart and analyze the performances of various stocks in order to 
arrive at an answer. Still another might proclaim to be an oracle, ca- 
pable of understanding the incomprehensible. Each analyst's techniques 
could be pure science, pure witchcraft, or a little of both. But no matter 
what its foundations, the sole purpose of any investment analysis system 
is to pick winners. 

The Deciding Factor. A decision generator is a program that ma- 
nipulates the information you put in and produces either buy/sell deci- 
sions or rankings based on measuring that information against specific 
predetermined criteria. There's nothing wrong with decision generators 
per se. A decision generator is, simply stated, a program that recom- 
mends action based on specific decision rules. 

All too often, however, decision generators promise to produce re- 
sults by means of a secret technique or system. Profit by magic, their au- 
thors seem to be saying; put some numbers in and out will come the in- 
vestment of your dreams. Such programs are dangerous because they 
don't tell you what their decisions are based on. 

A useful decision generator consists of a filtering program, which 
sorts through information the user inputs and picks out those items that 
meet preset criteria the user recognizes, and a set of calculations, which 
brings to bear analytic relationships and factors that the user under- 
stands and acknowledges to be meaningful. The result of this combina- 
tion is a decision with which the user knows he can agree. 

Market Maverick is the first fully documented, fully explained, and 
fully comprehensible decision generator we've seen. 

Market Maverick, Financial Software (1 1401 Westridge Circle, Char- 
don, OH 44024; 216-338-6811). $175. 

Backup policy: Copyable (program held under license). 

System requirements: 48K Apple II, II Plus, He, or III, one disk 
drive. 

Optional: Second disk drive, printer, modem (for use with Dowlog 
[Stock Market Software] or Dow Jones Market Analyzer [Dow Jones 
and Company]). 

This package contains two disks, the Market Maverick program disk 
and the Market Manager disk. The Manager contains all the necessary 
inputs, including the current prices, for 905 common stocks, "compiled 
from the estimates of over two thousand analysts at fifty-seven broker- 
age firms." The program author recommends the use of consensus opin- 
ions, as they are more likely than one person's opinion to reflect the 



movement of an issue (unless, of course, that person controls a signifi- 
cant portion of the company's stock). Investors can choose between pur- 
chasing the Market Manager portion of the program on a monthly sub- 
scription basis or entering by hand the information Market Maverick 
requires. 

Low Price, High Potential. The program documentation provides a 
thorough and clear explanation of the analysis technique Market Mav- 
erick uses. The technique is a mixture of statistical analysis and funda- 
mental analysis developed originally by a brokerage firm in the mid-six- 
ties. The analysis resulting from it is designed to identify promising, bar- 
gain-priced stocks before their merits become common knowledge and 
their prices rise. 

The technique that Market Maverick uses is not based on the move- 
ment of the planets or the length of women's skirts; rather, it appears to 
be grounded in solid, rational theory. Every opportunity to clarify the 
theory and function of the model has been taken. 

The author also provides a sober, well-written discussion of how to 
use the outputs of Market Maverick in making investment decisions. 
This discussion concerns not only the Market Maverick outputs but mar- 
ket psychology and an analysis of stock-price cycles. There is a con- 
spicuous absence of hyperbolic claims; investors should be able to un- 
derstand the author's arguments and should have all the information 
necessary to evaluate the promise of the model. 

In addition, the program code is unlocked, so you can look at it and 
determine what the program is doing and make appropriate 
modifications. 

As many as 1,200 stocks can reside in memory at any given time. 
You specify the stock price input mode (decimals or eighths) you prefer, 
the name of the database you'll be using most often, and whether or not 
you plan to use the Market Manager. 

Creating a Database. Once your system is configured and you've ini- 
tialized a data disk, you're ready to create a database of stocks to ana- 
lyze. The author suggests you begin by choosing ten stocks contained in 
the Manager. As you work your way through the easy-to-use menu 
structure, you'll go through the processes of adding stocks to the data- 
base and getting the Standard & Poor's parameters on-line. 

Market Maverick uses the Standard & Poor's 400 statistics to repre- 
sent the market as a whole. The statistics are drawn from a compilation 
of 400 industrial issues carried on the New York Stock Exchange. You 
can accept the S&P 400 or vary them as you see fit. 

The Standard & Poor's 400 statistics used are the inflation rate, in- 
flation pass-through (the ability of a company to pass along its increas- 
ing prices to its customers), normalized earnings per share (EPS that are 
"normalized," or adjusted, for high cyclically), and earnings volatility 
(historic fluctuations in the EPS). 

When the Standard & Poor's implementation is complete, you can 
add up to two hundred stocks to the database. Market Maverick then 
collects all the necessary background information from the Manager on 



APRIL 1983 



mum 



95 



any stocks it carries. You can include stocks that aren't contained in the 
Manager, but you'll have to supply the historic information yourself. 

Once the Maverick has the necessary historic information, you're 
asked for the current price quotation for the stock. 

Let's Analyze. Once you've entered all the required information, 
you're ready to execute the Market Maverick analysis. Any combination 
of stocks in the database, from a single stock to as many as 200, may be 
analyzed. 

The two available analyses are stock valuation and sensitivity. The 
program gives each security a symbol; during analysis, the symbol of the 
security being analyzed is displayed. The final computation sorts the 
stocks in the order of their attractiveness for purchase. The results may 
either be interpreted directly from the display or printed out. 

What exactly does the Market Maverick do? The valuation-analysis 
portion of the program is designed to forecast the fair price, or target 
value, of the stock being analyzed. Knowing this value enables an inves- 
tor to identify undervalued stocks, buy them, and make money as they 
appreciate. 

The sensitivity-analysis portion automatically adjusts the input pa- 
rameters for a stock until the target value is equal to the current price. 
This shows the investor what growth rate or level of earnings is implied 
into the current stock price. The sensitivity analysis provides an investor 
with additional analytic data on which to base investment decisions. 

The results of the sensitivity analysis can be displayed on the Apple's 
hi-res screen in the form of a graph. The graph displays the stock's price 
along the vertical axis and either the growth rate or the normalized EPS 
along the horizontal axis. 

In most cases the point at which the parameter being studied is im- 
plied by the current price is marked by an asterisk on the plotted ray. The 
author calls this intersection the equilibrium point. The cases in which 
the equilibrium point will not be displayed are those in which there is no 
growth rate above zero that will yield the current price, and those in 
which the equilibrium is at the intersection of the axis (0). 

According to the author, the Market Maverick program analyzed 
300 securities during the period from December 31, 1973, to June 30, 
1982. Of the stocks picked by Market Maverick, the top 10 percent rose 
139.1 percent in a market that was up only 16.7 percent. The bottom 10 
percent declined 31.6%. On an annual basis, the top 10 percent appreci- 
ated 10.8 percent per year, 15.9 percent with dividend income. This rep- 
resents a reasonable return on investment. T-bills during the same pe- 
riod were yielding 8.6 percent, with inflation averaging 7.8 percent. 

Decision Time. The Market Maverick does not claim to be a money 
generator. What it claims to be is an automated analytical tool that will 
help in the decision-making processes of those subscribing to the theory 
behind the model. 

But no one can manage your money better than you can; so if you 
don't understand Market Maverick or any other piece of investment soft- 
ware, don't buy it, even if your broker recommends it. The purpose of an 
advisory tool or service is to help you make your own decisions, not to 
make your decisions for you. 

Overall, Market Maverick is a well-executed, thoroughly thought-out 
program. It is well error-trapped and easy to use. The documentation is 
well written, clear, and comprehensive and follows a unique instruction 
scheme. Each page is divided into two columns, with the left-hand col- 
umn representing the prompt that the investor would see on the screen 
and the right-hand column showing the appropriate responses to the 
prompt. This can be a little disconcerting at first, but once you get used 
to it, it's a very effective instruction method. 

The program's only evident weakness seems to be its reliance on 
auto-price-update files generated by either the Dow Jones Market Ana- 
lyzer or Dowlog. If you don't already own one of these programs, you 
may find it expedient to make an extra purchase in order to take full ad- 
vantage of Market Maverick; even if you own one of these programs, 
switching back and forth between it and Market Maverick is a clumsy 
affair. 

If you're serious about investing, this program is worthy of your con- 
sideration. Your decision on whether to purchase this package should be 
based on your understanding of and belief in the theory behind the pack- 
age, and on your personal investment style. m

IF YOU'RE CONFUSED 
PERSONAL COMPUTER. 



At this moment, there are no 
less than 50 personal computers 
on the market. And more are 
being introduced every day. 

On one hand, having all those 
options is a good thing. On the 
other, it can make picking the 
right one pretty difficult. 




Start by making a list of the 
things you want to use the com- 
puter for. It can include almost 
anything-any kind of inventory, 
filing, accounting, graphics, 
reporting, record-keeping, 
analysis-you name it and there's 
probably a software program that 
does it. 

Next, take the list into a com- 
puter store and ask the salesper- 
son to give you a demonstration 
of the program, or programs 
that will do the things you 
want. 

Even though you'll 
need a computer 
for the soft 
demonstrc 



Computers come in two parts. 
You have to buy both. 

We'd like to help. So here are a 
few suggestions about how to buy 
the computer that's right for you. 
Computers come in two parts. 

One part is the "hardware," 
which is the machinery itself. The 
other is the "software," or a pro- 
gram, as it's sometimes called. 

Software is the part that tells 
the computer what to do, the way 
a driver tells a car what to do. 

Without software, a computer 
can't do anything. 

And vice versa. 

You have to buy both. 
Buy the software first. 

Since the reason you're buying 
a computer is to get the capability 
the software gives you (remember 
it's the software that knows how 
to get things done), it makes 
good sense to pick the 
software first. 



tion, keep in mind the computer 
is just a vehicle. The software is 
the driver. And once you've 
decided on the software, picking 
out the rest of the computer sys- 
tem will be much easier. 
The simpler the better. 

Look for software that's easy to 
learn, easy to use, and that does 
the job in the simplest way 
possible. 

Good personal soft- 
ware should be, as the 
computer people say 
"friendly." Meaning 
that it helps you 
do what you 
have to do 
without get- 
ting in the 
way. 






Mean- 
ing there 
are no com- 
plicated routines 
to follow to perform 
a simple task. And no 
programming 
language to learn. 
Some people, how- 
ever, will tell you that soft- 
ware has to be compli- 
cated to be powerful. 

Nothing could be far- 
ther from the truth. 
Hr Because in order for a 
program to appear simple 
to you on the outside, it has to 
be extremely complex on 
the inside. 



ABOUT BUYING A 
HERE'S SOME HELR 



Good software keeps the com- 
plications in the computer, where 
they belong. And keeps the capa- 
bility at your fingertips. It's that 
simple. 

You simply have to see 
for yourself. 

You can read any number of 
interesting books and magazines 
about personal computers. You 
can ask friends who have them. 
You can look at all the sales litera- 
ture you can get your hands on. 
And you should do all those 
things before you decide to buy. 

But as helpful as all that can be, 
there really is no substitute for a 
real, live demonstration. 

When you do go out shopping, 
we recommend you take a look at 
the PFS®Family of Software. 

The PFS family is designed the 
way we think all software should 
be: simple, straightforward and 
powerful. 

Currently, three products 
make up the family. PFS:FILE, 
PFS:REPORT and PFS.GRAPH, 
with more programs on the way 
Here's a little more about each 
of them. 

PFS:FILE. The simplest way 
to get organized. 

Basically FILE works like a 
paper filing system, without the 
paper. So you can record, file, 
retrieve and review information in 
a fraction of the time it takes with 
a conventional filing system. 

FILE lets you arrange your 
information in "forms" you design 
yourself. So you can get at and 
really use your information in A 
ways never before possible. 

What's more, FILE lets you 
change the original form without 
having to redo the information on it. 



PFS:REPORT. Making the most 
of your information. 

REPORT summarizes the 
information on your forms so you 
can use it to analyze, plan and 
make better-informed decisions. 

With REPORT, you get presen- 
tation-quality reports-sorted, cal- 
culated, formatted and prmted- 
automatically in seconds. 
PFS:GRAPH. Instant pictures. 

GRAPH gives you presentation 
quality bar charts, line graphs, 
and pie charts, in black and white 
or color, on paper or the com- 
puter screen. To get a clearer 
picture of things and spot trends 
instantly, you simply enter your 
information and specify the kind 
of graph or chart you want. 
GRAPH does the rest. 

You can also mix and match 
line and bar graphs, or even stack 
or compare up to four bar graphs 
simultaneously. 

And GRAPH will work with 
PFS:FILE, VisiCalc® files, or data 
entered directly into the 
computer. 

Best of all, compared to the 
cost of hand-drawn graphics, 
GRAPH can save you enough 
money over the course of a few 
months to pay for the computer it 
runs on.

Big-league baseball is customarily played by brilliant outfielders, veter- 
an hurlers, powerful sluggers, knuckle-ball artists, towering first basemen, 
key moundsmen, fleet base runners, ace southpaws, scrappy little short- 
stops, sensational war vets, ex-college stars, relief artists, rifle-armed twirl- 
ers, dependable mainstays, doughty right-handers, streamlined backstops, 
power-hitting batsmen, redoubtable infielders, erstwhile Dodgers, veteran 
sparkplugs, sterling moundsmen, aging twirlers, and rookie sensations. 
— From "The Cliche Expert Testifies on Baseball," by Frank Sullivan 

It was almost seventy-nine years ago — on May 5, 1904 — that Den- 
ton True "Cy" Young pitched his perfect game. The Philadelphia Ath- 
letics sent twenty-seven men to the plate against the Red Sox hurler and 
they all went away empty-handed. Cy, short for cyclone, knew he had to 
pitch a good game, because the Athletics pitcher, Rube Waddell, had 
blanked the Red Sox twice in a row. 

Young, with perfect control and a good curve ball, struck out eight, 
got ten batters on fly balls, and nine on ground balls. Young faced a for- 
midable team in the Athletics, boasting the likes of Harry Davis, Danny 
Murphy, Socks Seybold, and Lave Cross. 

In the ninth inning, Young struck out the Athletics' shortstop Monte

shining centerpiece of a career that would eventually make Young the 
winningest pitcher in the game and a legend. 

It's a remarkable feat that might never have happened if the Phila- 
delphia manager, Connie Mack, had had an Apple. 

Guiding the Oakland A's' Destiny. Mack's present-day counterpart, 
Stephen Boros, manager of the Philadelphia Athletics' present-day de- 
scendants, the Oakland A's, uses an Apple. It helps him plan strategies 
before a game and provides information to help make decisions during a 
game. The kinds of decisions the Apple helps Boros make are basic — 
what hitter to send against a certain pitcher, how to play a certain hitter 
in the field. 

In Young's perfect game, for instance, Connie Mack used only ten 
different hitters. If he had had the kind of information that's now avail- 
able to Boros, Mack would have searched his bench for the one hitter 
who could break Young's spell. Whether or not that hitter existed is un- 
important. Actually, Young and Waddell squared off again the next 
year, with Waddell the victor in a twenty-inning thriller. 

The point is that microcomputers have become a part of the game, 
and, though they may not bring radical changes at first, they're currently 
taking over the fact-finding and information-storage tasks for several 
professional clubs. Keeping statistics, managing player data, creating 
scouting reports, and improving player training represent areas in which 
microcomputers are well-suited to lend a hand. 

Last July, Softalk showed you how the Philadelphia Phillies and 
Texas Rangers were using Apples in their training programs. This time 
around we'll visit the Oakland A's and, briefly, the Chicago White Sox. 
Both American League teams are using programs created by Dick 
Kramer of Pacific Select Corporation, a marketing and management 
firm. Pacific Select specializes in consulting for sports teams through its 
STATS (sports team analysis and tracking system) division. 

Baseball is a strategic game. You plan your moves in advance, but 
you must be ready to make changes on the spur of the moment. It's a 
game of chance and intense mental concentration. Finding the thin line 
that separates good luck and a successful calculated risk has obsessed 
baseball managers for more than a hundred years, as has finding the line 
that separates bad luck and miscalculation. 

Many aspects of baseball strategy stay the same from game to game: 
send a left-handed pinch-hitter against a right-handed pitcher, look for 
the pitcher to bunt if there's a runner on base, have all your base runners 
running on a 3-2 count with two outs. A typical game is played with

these basic strategies in mind as well as the individual strengths and 
weaknesses of the players. 

Dreams of a Youthful Pilot. The ability to easily access data that re- 
flects a player's performance in a given situation is a manager's dream. In 
the old days, that kind of information gathering was all done by hand on 
paper. Usually with a small battalion of statistical support people and 
record keepers, teams made extensive written reports on their own play- 
ers and those of the competition. Managers combined seat-of-the-pants 
piloting (managers don't manage) with reams of disorganized, some- 
times inaccurate, information. 

Now that is all changing, at least in that the reams of paper come off 
a computer printer. Pacific Select's Edge 1000 package, created by Dick 
Kramer, was designed to take over the task of keeping records on play- 
ers and creating reports on opposing teams. With Kramer's program, an 
Apple II Plus, a Hayes Smartmodem, and a DEC PDP-10 located in 
Philadelphia, Oakland A's manager Steve Boros can have more accu- 
rate information made available to him faster than any of his 
predecessors. 

Nineteen hundred eighty-three will be the first full year that the A's 
have used the Apple for actual managerial applications. All last year, 
though, the A's used the Apple and Pacific Select's system to support 
their radio and television broadcasters. 

Besides managers, fans of baseball are always hungry to know hard- 
to-remember details of a player's past performance. Like managers, 
broadcasters usually have a small army of statistical support people and 
record keepers. Kramer was approached by the A's to put together a sys- 
tem that would update batting averages during a game and provide other 
features for Lon Simmons, Bill King, and Wayne Hagan, the A's broad- 
casters. 

"The broadcasters had to get used to it at first," says Jay Alves, a 
statistician for the A's. "They were hesitant because it was new. Bill King 
and Lon Simmons have been in broadcasting for twenty-five years. But 
they found that the Apple was a lot easier than shuffling through papers. 



I broke them in on a black-and-white monitor. For some reason they 
didn't like green." 

Edge 1000 consists of two main programs, Play Ball and Scout. Play 
Ball uses the Apple II in conjunction with the DEC PDP-10 and is the 
program that the A's use both for managerial purposes and to support 
the broadcasters. On the DEC are kept the play-by-play, pitch-by-pitch 
records of every game the A's played in 1981 and 1982, including exhibi- 
tion games. 

The 1022 database system on the DEC is relational. The game data is 
entered in such a way that all of the important details are included for 
later recall. Kramer says they tried to make the game summaries and in- 
ning accounts as detailed as possible. A whole season's worth of games 
amounts to six or seven thousand individual events, which Kramer says 
is too much data to expect an Apple to keep track of. 

The programs allowing the Apple to interact with the DEC were 
written mainly in UCSD Pascal by Kramer. He has nothing but praise 
for UCSD Pascal. Some Fortran programs were required as well. Kra- 
mer says that Pete Palmer, a programmer in the employ of the Amer- 
ican League, "steered us around some problems." 

A Microcomputer Circuit Clout. Kramer had some minor prob- 
lems with the Apple at first, because he's not much of a microcomputer 
person, having worked mostly with mainframes. Taylor Pohlman of 
Apple Computer advised Kramer to use the Apple II instead of the 
Apple III because of the IPs higher-level Pascal. 

The A's use the Apple as "a very intelligent terminal," says Kramer. 
"It's very clever at getting and returning information to the DEC." 

Before playing a team, the A's will access the DEC and record on 
disk in summary form all the recent games that that team has played 
against the A's. Jay Alves, who is the A's Apple caretaker, also keeps a 
disk of the A's' players, which is constantly updated. In the broadcasting 
booth, the Apple is set up with the two team disks and a program disk 
that updates averages and statistics during the game, and is capable of 
pulling interesting bits of information for the announcers to use 
on the air. 

In terms of the managerial side of baseball, Play Ball provides sev- 
eral different applications. At the end of each game, Alves sends the 
game summary to the PDP-10. The mainframe sends back daily 
"canned" reports that are basically updated statistics on the A's and the 
opposing team. 

The only muff, says Alves, is having to rely on the phone system. 
"Suppose I'm out here in Oakland and there's a storm in the Midwest 
that interferes with the data. We're seriously thinking about purchasing 
hard disks to avoid that problem." 

Last year, Alves took the Apple with him on all the A's' road games, 
and the same will be true this year. "I was on the road off and on for 
seven months, rarely staying in a city longer than three days. The carry- 
ing case I was using for the Apple got beat to hell." 

Besides providing the daily updates, the DEC is also used for special 
queries. A's manager Boros may want to know more about one of his 
pitcher's patterns, what kind of pitches are being thrown when the 
pitcher is behind or ahead in the count, for instance. Alves winds up his 
trusty 1200-baud Hayes Smartmodem and pitches a request at the main- 
frame. Shortly, the data is batted back and the Apple makes a routine 
catch. 

One of the most useful features available to Alves and the A's graph- 
ically shows where a batter hits the ball. A rough estimation of the base- 
ball diamond is represented on the Apple's screen and the path of balls 
hit is plotted. The data for these computations is generated manually 
during the game by treating the field as a grid map and simply noting 
where a ball is hit. 

By requesting an entire year's worth of data, it's possible to see in five 
minutes or so where a player hit every ball, whether they were home 
runs, bunts, or pop flys. It's possible to see where a slugger hit all his 
home runs and where an average hitter made all his outs. With the rela- 
tional database it's possible to see how a batter fared in a myriad of dif- 
ferent situations — against a particular pitcher, during the day, at night, 
on artificial turf, on grass, early in the season, late in the season, 
and so on. 

This graphics feature is particularly helpful in determining defensive

strategy. As long as the information is available it's possible to see graph- 
ically how an opposing hitter has fared in past meetings with A's pitch- 
ers. This helps the manager to adjust the infield or outfield accurately for 
each individual match-up in a game, assuming that the batter and pitch- 
er have met before. 

Finding out where a batter hit balls is a typical special query that the 
A's may send off to the DEC. The Apple by itself is capable of making 
reports on "last-time" match-ups. It's possible to search through the op- 
posing team's disk and pull all the recent meetings between a particular 
hitter and batter in summary form. 

This ability to call up accurate data on last time match-ups could 
have drastically changed the outcome of the first and second innings of 
the 1934 All-Star Game. You may remember the event. 

King Carl the Legendary Twirler. The National League pitcher Carl 
"The Meal Ticket" Hubbell got into trouble early in the first inning, 
with two men on and nobody out. The next five batters were Babe Ruth, 
Lou Gehrig, Jimmy "Double XX" Foxx, Al Simmons, and Joe Cronin. 
Who could have predicted what happened next. 

Ruth struck out looking. Gehrig struck out swinging. Foxx struck 
out swinging. That got Hubbell out of the first. In the second he prompt- 
ly struck out Simmons and Cronin. The next batter, Bill Dickey of the 
Yankees, hit a single, breaking the spell. But Hubbell had already made 
history fanning in succession five of the most fearsome hitters to play the 
game of baseball. Few people bother to mention that he almost struck 
out six in a row, mowing down Lefty Gomez after Dickey's hit. 

Now suppose that Foxx (who hit fifty-eight homers in 1932 and a to- 
tal of 534 in his career) or Ruth had faced Hubbell and his killer screw- 
ball in an earlier exhibition game. The American League manager be- 
fore the All-Star game could have seen the results of the earlier meetings 
and determined how best to approach Hubbell. 

You say what more knowledge do you need when you have Ruth, 
Gehrig, and Foxx in the same lineup? Then how come they all struck out 
with men in scoring position, one of baseball's most embarrassing feats? 
The answer is also the reason why computers will never take away the ex- 



citement of baseball: It's a game of chance, of inches. The impossible is 
always possible. 

How would the Chicago Cubs have fared against the Philadelphia 

Athletics in that most famous of comebacks — the seventh inning of the 
fourth game of the 1929 World Series — if they had had Kramer's pro- 
gram? They might have recognized patterns that indicated their ace 
pitcher Charlie Root was getting tired when he faced Al Simmons at the 
opening of the seventh. By having an accurate pitch-by-pitch report of 
Root's previous games, the manager could have compared the number 
of pitches thrown with their speed and placement and evaluated Root's 
condition in relation to his past performances. 

But the Cubs were winning comfortably 8-0 and there seemed no 
good reason to take Root out or even warm up the bullpen. 

Simmons led off the inning with a home run. Jimmy Foxx followed 
with a single. Bing Miller, Jimmy Dykes, and Joe Boley followed Foxx 
with three more singles. The next batter, pinch-hitter George Burns, 
popped out. Then Max Bishop smacked another single to center for the 
Athletics. Root left the game. His replacement, Art Nehf, fell on equally 
bad times. 

The next batter with one out and the score now 8-4 was Mule Haas. 
He hit a wild in-the-park home run that made the score 8-7. After an- 
other three runs and two more Cub pitchers the Athletics were finally re- 
tired. But they had scored ten runs in the inning and secured a crucial vic- 
tory in the series. They went on to beat the Cubs for the 1929 World 
Championship four games to one. 

Avoiding Slugfests and Batting Orgies. If the Apple can help the 
Oakland A's avoid giving up ten runs in an inning it will become popu- 
lar in a hurry, even more so if it can help them score ten runs in an in- 
ning. The Apple should prove a very valuable tool, complementing the 
real central computers, the truly remarkable baseball minds of Boros, 
Alves, and the A's coaching staff. 

Managers are justly famous for pulling off the improbable and im- 
practical, defying logic, tradition, and the wishes of the fans. Connie 
Mack surprised everyone in the opening game of the same 1929 World

SOEUI g 



APRIL 1983 



Series against the Cubs. A week before the Fall Classic, Mack had pitch- 
er Howard Ehmke (a ho-hum seven-game winner that year) secretly 
scout the Cubs in preparation for pitching the opener. 

The fans thought Mack was daft. Why doesn't he start Grove or 
Earnshaw? But few Athletics fans complained when Ehmke completely 
baffled the Cubs, striking out thirteen and winning the game easily. It's 
not hard to imagine the Apple helping out in preparing some of the elab- 
orate, secretive schemes that managers love to indulge in. 

Next year the A's will start using Kramer's scouting system. Once 
again it's a case of entering player data in such a way as to flag the items 
needed for possible searching later. These would include age, position, 
condition, different scouts' ratings, previous performance, and salary 
information. 

The Chicago White Sox are already using Edge 1000's scouting pro- 
gram with an Apple connected to a twenty-megabyte Corvus hard disk. 
Like the A's, the White Sox are also using Kramer's Play Ball, for de- 
fensive purposes. 

The Chicago White Sox broadcasters are also using the Apple and 
Kramer's programs to complement their reporting of games. With a vid- 
eo interface they visually update batting averages and display on-screen 
for the audience the results of a batter's last few at-bats and other bits of 
information. 

Kramer is currently talking to other interested parties. He believes 
that the Edge 1000's help in presenting cases to an arbiter can justify the 
cost very rapidly. "Win one good size judgment and you've paid for it." 
The A's themselves lost $185,000 this year in an arbitration settlement in 
favor of master base stealer Ricky Henderson. 

Mighty Batsmen and Veteran Hurlers. Another project Kramer has 
going is creating a separate database by player of every big leaguer to 
play from 1970 to the present. He's just about licked the data entry part 
of the program. 

Eventually the A's would like to have an Apple in the dugout during 
the game, mainly for defensive purposes. Woe to the innocent chip that 
overheats and blows the system in the eighth inning of a 5-5 tie. There are 



plenty of spare willows, wagon tongues, and pieces of lumber in the 
dugout. 

Generally, though, Apples are more dependable than humans, par- 
ticularly legendary characters like Rube Waddell — who injured his 
shoulder in a wrestling match at a Boston railroad station and missed the 
1906 World Series. Fans were denied the dream duel of Waddell against 
Christy Mathewson. The New York Giants won the series, beating the 
Philadelphia Athletics 4-1. Mathewson pitched three shutouts, an awe- 
some twenty-seven scoreless innings with only fourteen scattered hits. 

"Baseball is an old-style sport, slow to make changes," says Alves. 
"But we're excited about the Apple. The manager, Steve Boros, really 
likes it and he's been very cooperative. He's got a real baseball mind." 
Boros managed the Kansas City Royals for several years in the mid-sev- 
enties and most recently the Montreal Expos for two years. 

Alves is beginning to notice some interest in the Apple among the 
players themselves. They're curious about how they performed and ask 
to see the charts and reports. Individual printouts to be given to players 
before a game are another thing the A's will be investigating this year. 

As the A's Wend Their Way South. For the last three or four weeks, 
Alves has been with the A's in Scottsdale, Arizona, for spring training. 
This spring training went a lot easier for Alves than the last one. He only 
had to keep track of fifty-eight hopefuls. 

"Last year we had more than a hundred guys in spring training 
camp," he recalls. "The Apple couldn't handle that many players at once 
and started freaking out." 

With a new manager, a new computer system, and a brand-new sea- 
son where anything is possible — even the World Championship— the A's 
are just about ready for their April 4 opener against the Cleveland In- 
dians. 

"We're looking forward to the 1983 season," says Alves. 

What he means to say is the A's are planning to nip, top, trounce, 
rout, subdue, wallop, drub, paste, crush, erase, bop, batter, hammer, 
clout, thump, larrup, flatten, shellac, blast, slaughter, topple, whack, baf- 
fle, thwart, foil, and maul the opposition. !■

Before we get started, will everyone who is sitting in the rear of the 
class please move forward and fill these empty seats in the front. No doz- 
ing off in this column. 

If you came here wanting to learn how to write games, databases, 
and word processing programs, you're in the wrong class. This is the Be- 
ginners' Corner and is, just like it says, for beginners. There are plenty of 
other tutorials for the advanced students, so if you came here looking for 
an easy A, forget it. This class is for those who don't know RAM from 
ewe, control-C from Hi-C, or escape from Rungistan. Beginners with a 
capital B. 

We're assuming that everyone here has just bought, won, stolen, or 
otherwise acquired an Apple and has minimal knowledge of how to 
work it. It doesn't make any difference whether you use one at work for 
a single application and want to learn more about it or you bought it for 
the kids and don't want to feel left out of dinnertime conversation. This 
is the place to get started. 

The focus of the class will be toward the Apple He, since that's the 
machine on the market. However, anyone using a II Plus can also join in 
the fun, since most of the basic principles apply to both Apples. 

We'll start off nice and slow to give everyone a chance to warm up to 
the machine; then we'll gradually pick up the pace as you become more 
familiar with computer words and the Apple in general. By the time 
we're through, you won't be a programmer extraordinaire, but you will 
have an understanding of the way things work. In a way, this will be like 
driving school; you won't become a Cale Yarborough of drivers, but 
you'll be able to handle Los Angeles freeways and New York's East Side 
Drive. 

Who's In Charge Here? The first thing we ought to understand is 
that computers are dumb. Really dumb. If you think the kid at the su- 
permarket who throws the cantaloupes on top of the eggs in your gro- 
cery bag is a bit dim, wait until you see some of the stuff the Apple can 
do if you're not careful. Yes, the computer performs calculations faster 
than we can conceive them, and yes, it does remember a lot of things you 
tell it. But it's not "smart"; it's obedient. 

The family dog, for instance, can probably run faster, jump higher, 
and hear better than you can. He can probably remember under which 
tree he buried your slippers long after you've forgotten all about them. 
But that doesn't make him smarter. After all, how can you call an ani- 
mal that eats dog food, and loves it, smarter than you? By the same token, 
how can you call a machine that sleeps all day — until you wake it up — 
smart? Even Fido wakes up by himself. 

If you have any apprehensions about operating a computer, just re- 
member this: it won't do anything you don't tell it to do. You're the one 



in control here, not it. Sure, it can do things that you can't; but so can a 
toaster. Let's not put ourselves on the same intellectual level as a toaster; 
save those kinds of comparisons for the person dropping cantaloupes on 
top of your eggs. 

Enough lecturing, let's have some fun. We're assuming that you have 
everything all set up and are ready to rip. If you don't, then go through 
the first chapter of the owner's manual. It explains all you need to know 
to get the system set up. There are plenty of color pictures that help in 
case you get caught up in words that seem to make little sense. When you 
have everything set up, come back and join us in the next paragraph. 

If you're sitting in front of the keyboard and wondering what the 
heck all those funny-looking keys are for, welcome to the club. Most of 
them are in the same place you'd expect to find them on a standard type- 
writer, and Apple's even added a few. 

One way to become familiar with all those keys is to turn on the com- 
puter, start hitting keys, and take notes on what makes smoke come out 
the back and what doesn't. An even better way is to break out the disk 
called Apple Presents . . . Apple. It's nothing like any typing classes you 
might have taken; it's a bit more fun. By the time you get through that (it 
takes less than a half hour), you'll be familiar with all the function keys 
and editing keys. 

It's Kickoff Time. Take the Sample Programs disk and insert it into 
the disk drive. Make sure you insert it with the label end toward you and 
the label facing upward. Close the disk drive door, and boot the disk. Go 
ahead. Done? If you picked up the disk and kicked it across the room, 
you're good at following directions, but you're on the wrong track. 

Boot is one of those computerese words; it means nothing more than, 
"Put the disk in the drive, and turn the computer on." The term comes 
from the phrase, "Pulling oneself up by the bootstraps." For us it means 
that the main program on the disk starts by itself when the power is 
switched on. 

The power switch is located on your left-hand side on the back panel, 
right next to where the power cord plugs in. For very good reasons, the 
power switch is located in this awkward spot. It's a safeguard. You can't 
accidentally shut off the computer when you're working on something 
very important (or if you're on your way to a high score on your favorite 
game). 

When you switch the computer on, it will beep, the red "in-use" light 
on the disk drive will light up, and you'll hear all sorts of whirring and 
clicking coming from the drive. Don't worry; that's how the drive sounds 
when it wakes up. Sort of like, "Aw, geez, is it time to go to work al- 
ready?" Actually, what's happening is the computer is looking at the 
disk, trying to find the set of instructions that tells it how to operate the 



112 



HUXDZE 



APRIL 1983 



disk drive. Whether you're switching on the computer for the first or the 
thousandth time, it always looks for those instructions before it does any- 
thing else. It's dumb, remember? 

DOS Boot. The set of instructions it's looking for is called DOS 
(rhymes with "boss"), which stands for "Disk Operating System." Every 
time you want to do anything that has to do with your disk, the comput- 
er has to be told how to do it. The instructions that tell it how to operate 
the drive are complicated, lengthy, and hard to remember. So, to save 
you from having to type them in each time you want to get, put, or even 
look at something on the disk, DOS is loaded into a corner of the com- 
puter's memory whenever you boot a disk, and all you have to remem- 
ber are a few English words that tell the computer what you want 
it to do. 

The English words are often referred to as "DOS commands." 
Whenever you use one, you can think of yourself as a monarch com- 
manding your machine to carry out your wishes. Remember, you're the 
one in charge around here, not the computer. 

With all those instructions in its memory, the computer then looks 
for the greeting program. That's the program that runs first, no matter 
what else you might have on the disk. In the case of the Sample Pro- 
grams disk, the greeting program, Hello, displays a message on-screen 
and then loads the Integer Basic language from the disk into another cor- 
ner of the computer's memory. 

Now you have a message on-screen and a blinking box below it, bet- 
ter known as the cursor. Having absolutely nothing to do with cursing, 
all the cursor says is, "What would you like me to do next, boss?" and 
"Whatever you type next I'll display at this spot on the screen." In other 
words, it's waiting for you to type something and showing you where it 
will appear. But it won't do anything until you give it permission. 

Let's have a look at the disk. If you pulled the disk out, squinted at it, 
and said, "Looks okay to me," put it back in the drive; that's not what 
we meant. To see what kinds of things are recorded on your disk, type in 
the command catalog. Be sure you have the caps-lock key down when 
you type because the Apple refuses to listen to you unless you use all 
capital letters. The same goes for any kind of command you give it. The 
Apple is very fussy when it comes to taking orders. Even though that's 
what its job is, it won't listen to you unless you are very specific in what 
you type. 

Nothing will happen until you hit the return key because you haven't 
told the computer to do anything yet; you're just preparing the message. 
In a way, it lets you get your command in a nice understandable form be- 
fore it looks to see what you want it to do. 

After you hit return, the disk will spin around, and a list of things will 
come up on the screen. If none of this happens, check your spelling. Re- 
member, the computer is dumb. If you typed in catlog, catalog, catalogg, 
or any other variation of the word, the computer will look at it, scratch 
its head, and reply, ?syntax error. (That's the computer's way of saying, 
"Huh?") You know what you meant, your fingers know what you 
meant, and anybody who has read this far knows what you meant. But 
the computer hasn't the faintest idea; it has to know exactly what you 
mean before it acts. No sense of initiative. 

What it's showing you is the disk's catalog, a list of programs you can 
run that are on the disk. The list is incomplete, though, because the com- 
puter wants you to be able to see the first part of the catalog before it 
pushes it up and off the screen, making room for the rest of the catalog. 
When you see the blinking cursor, hit any key, and the catalog will con- 
tinue scrolling by until it reaches the last program. After it's done, you'll 
see the cursor again, eagerly awaiting your next command. 

There's a lot of information in the catalog. On the far left-hand side 
of each program name is an asterisk, indicating that the program is 
locked. Don't worry too much about this yet; we'll get back to it later. 
Next, you'll see the letter A, B, I, or T. This tells you what kind of pro- 
gram you're looking at, Applesoft Basic, binary (machine language), 
Integer Basic, or text file. Knowing what kind of program helps you 
know what commands to use with it. 

Right after the letter comes a three-digit number. That's just an indi- 
cation of how large a program is; it tells you how much space it takes up 
on the disk and in the computer's memory. Last comes the program's 
name. 



Programs are really nothing more than a series of instructions telling 
the computer what to do. For example, if you wanted to write a pro- 
gram that would make breakfast for you, it would go something like, 
"First, get the box of cereal from the cupboard. Second, get a bowl, a 
spoon, and some milk. Third, pour some cereal into the bowl, and then 
add some milk. Don't add any sugar because it's bad for the teeth." 
Realistically, the Apple can't do that for you . . . yet. 

None of the programs you see listed in the disk catalog will make 
breakfast for you, but they do have their uses. Let's have a look. Run- 
ning progams is a lot like playing records on the record player. Before 
you get to hear the music, you have to put the record on the turntable, 
then wait for the grooves to be translated into an understandable form 
(music) before it comes out through the speakers. 

With the computer, you first have to load the program from the disk 
into the computer's memory and then have it translate the program into 
a form you can comprehend (words, pictures, sound). We could do it 
that way, but people are lazy, always looking for a shorter, faster, easier 
way to do things (that's why people buy computers). Fortunately, the 
people at Apple have combined the loading and translating functions in- 
to one command, run. 

Here's How It Works. Type the command, run Applevision, and hit 
the return key (remember, you almost always have to press the return 
key before your command will work). The computer searches through 
the disk, the same way you flip through your record collection, looking 
for a program called Applevision, and then loads it into memory. When 
the program's all there, the computer tells it to begin doing whatever it's 
supposed to do, the same way you lower the needle onto the spinning 
record. 

Now, just sit back and watch the action. Not exactly the latest in pro- 
gramming applications, nor even the most useful, but it is kind of neat. 
When you're through being amazed, hit the escape key to stop the 
program. 

In Applevision, the program is telling the computer, "Print this mes- 
sage, and when the human hits the return key, draw a bunch of lines in 
these places to make this picture. Then draw the person in the television 
set and make him dance while you play the following song. . . ." 

Another way we could have done it is the long way, the way we try to 
avoid. Type in the command, load Applevision. The computer will load 
the program into memory as before but will not run it. To run the pro- 
gram, just type in (you guessed it) run. 

In case you're thinking that it's dumb to have a long way to do some- 
thing when a short way will work just fine, you'll be happy to know that 
the long way came first. When you pull out an album from your record 
collection, you don't have to listen to it. You can look at the artwork on 
the cover, you can read the liner notes, or you can play Frisbee with it. 
Likewise, when you load a program, you can modify it, put it on another 
disk, or just look at the program listing. 

Try it now. Load the program called Address into the computer, and 
then type list. The moment you hit return, a whole bunch of stuff that 
looks like it's written in a foreign language will begin rolling by faster 
than you can possibly read it. In fact, it is a foreign language, called Ap- 
plesoft, and what you're seeing is the list of statements that make up the 
program. Unlike the catalog, the program listing will not stop and wait 
for you to tell it to continue; it just whisks by without even saying hello. 

To get a better look at the listing while it's scrolling by, type control- 
S. You do this by holding down the control key and then pressing the S 
key. Control-S will stop the listing until you give it permission to keep on 
going. Hitting any key will start it going again, and every time you hit 
control-S it will stop. If you want it to stop listing completely, good old 
control-C is standing by. Play around with these control characters to get 
a feel for them. Don't worry; you can't wreck anything on your disk. 

Killer Bs. The commands catalog, load, and run are DOS com- 
mands. The last two, when used with the name of a program following 
them, cause the disk drive to perform some kind of action with a 
program. You can use load and run with Applesoft and Integer pro- 
grams, but not with binary ones. To run a binary program, type brun 
(pronounced, bee-run) followed by the name of the binary program you 
want to run. Brun does the same as run; it loads the program and 
makes it go. 



APRIL 1983

You can load binary programs into memory by using bload (bee- 
load) plus the program name, but once it's in memory, a simple brun 
without the program name will not run it. To run binary programs, you 
have to do it the short way. 

Remember when we said you "almost always" have to hit return to 
execute your commands? Well, control characters, as we saw, don't wait 
for the return key, they work the moment you type them in. Run Apple- 
vision again. After it begins drawing the room, type control-C. This is a 
command that stops what's in progress. It tells the computer, "Stop what 
you're doing; we're going to do something else." 

You'll notice also that the cursor is nowhere to be found. Actually, 
that's not true. It is on the screen, waiting for you to type something in, 
but you can't see it. Just to prove that, type in catalog and hit return. 
You'll have to be especially careful when you type because the letters 
won't appear on the screen. The disk spun around, didn't it? You 
couldn't see it, but the catalog scrolled up the screen, too. Just have a lit- 
tle faith. Now that we've agreed the cursor is there somewhere, why can't 
we see the darned thing? 

At first, you'd say the cursor is invisible, but that's not an accurate 
way to describe it; a better way would be to say that it's hidden. The 
monitor functions very much like the front of a classroom. When you're 
typing in commands, programs, or other text, it's like writing on a chalk- 
board. When you want to draw pictures or do things with graphics, you 
have to go into a graphics mode, which is sort of like pulling down a 
movie screen when you want to show films or slides. 

So, when Applevision wants to do its thing, it goes into the graphics 
mode before it starts drawing pictures. Control-C stops the program in 
its tracks but leaves the monitor in the graphics mode. It's as though you 
pulled the plug on the movie projector; the film stops, but the screen is 
still covering up the chalkboard. 

To be able to see what you're typing, you have to get back into the 
text mode, which is done by simply typing the command, text. Voila, the 
movie screen is gone, and the chalkboard is visible again. 



Get Out the Crayons. If you have a color monitor or color television 
with your Apple, another program to have fun with on rainy days is 
Color Test. It doesn't sound like much, but the Kaleidoscope option 
might help you meditate away the hours. And if you have a joystick or 
game paddles hooked up, you can play around with the Sketching 
Screen. 

The Sketching Screen demonstrates another way you communicate 
with the computer, much like the way you communicate with it when 
you play your favorite game. Inputting DOS commands is one way to 
talk to the computer; manipulating the game controllers is another. 

Every time you play video games on the Apple or in the arcades, 
you're telling the program what to do, which in turn tells the computer 
what to do. For example, in Pac-Man, when you move the joystick for- 
ward, you're telling the program to make the Pac-Man character move 
toward the top of the screen. The program tells the computer to draw a 
series of Pac-Men in such a way that it looks like he's moving upward. 
Despite what some video games might make you feel like, you really are 
in control of the machine, not the other way around. 

To demonstrate that point a little more, there's a game on the Sam- 
ple Programs disk called Brick Out. It's one of the original Pong-type 
games where you bounce a ball off a wall, trying to knock out all the 
bricks. 

There's a variety of programs on the System Master and Sample Pro- 
grams disks that you can have fun and experiment with until our next 
meeting. If you have the Apple manual around, it won't hurt to go 
through it very briefly. That should be enough to keep you busy for a 
while. Next time, we'll take a close look inside the Apple to see how 
things work. 

In the meantime, remember that the Apple is a tool for you to use 
(though some programmers might feel the reverse is true). If you start 
feeling frustrated, it's only because the Apple can't read your mind; it 
does only as it's told. 

Be patient. It's not as smart as you.

The Schoolhouse Apple 

1 byJeanVarven 




You know what you want to know — now where do you go to find 
out? So much is happening so fast with regard to computers in educa- 
tion that it sometimes seems impossible even to know where to begin 
looking to keep up. With that in mind, let's look this month at various 
information sources, including bulletin boards, conferences, magazines, 
and directories. Perhaps one or more of these will come in handy later on 
when you know what you want to know but you don't — well, you get the 
idea. 

Education On-Line. Electronic bulletin boards can provide an effec- 
tive way for teachers, parents, and others interested in education to inter- 
act with and learn from one another. Here's information about four such 
systems. All focus on education and all are free — that is, users do not pay 
for the service, only for the telephone call. Of course, all require that you 
have an Apple (or some other micro) and a modem. 

The Department of Educational Technology at San Diego State Uni- 
versity established the Ed Tech PMS (People's Message System) last No- 
vember. Since then, reports educational technology professor Bernard 
Dodge, calls have come in from people in thirty different states. Callers 
can use the system to share information about education, ask and an- 
swer questions, announce new products, and publicize upcoming classes 
and conferences. Soon, there will also be files of education-related infor- 
mation for users to download onto their systems. 

The Ed Tech PMS operates between the hours of 4:30 p.m. and 8:00 
a.m. on weekdays and twenty-four hours a day on weekends. The access 
number is (619) 265-3428. 

San Francisco's Living BBS, cosponsored by Computer Using Edu- 
cators and Far West Regional Educational Laboratory, is another edu- 
cation-centered bulletin board worth knowing about. Living BBS is a 
good name for this system. Its tree-structured format gives organization 
to the system and encourages dialogue among users. It also promotes a 
feeling of immediacy and connectedness with real people on the other 
end of the line. Because of the tree structure, it's easy to follow the course 
of a discussion that has been going on over time. A password system en- 
ables users to send and receive private messages. 

The Living BBS can be reached twenty-four hours a day, seven days 
a week. To log on, dial (415) 565-3037. 

The Leprechaun is an electronic bulletin board supported by the Uni- 
versity of Notre Dame. Provided by the office of the assistant provost for 
computing and the Byteing Irish (the Apple user group at the univer- 
sity), this new board is intended to provide members of the academic 
community with a means of communicating with one another about 
computers in education. It features an Apple tips board and help com- 
mands that guide new users as they learn about the system. Users can 
send messages to one another privately by using a password system, and 
it's also possible to download certain information and programs. 

The Leprechaun can be reached twenty-four hours a day, seven days 
a week. To hook up, dial (219) 239-5875. 

Connecticut's Education-80 was set up "to permit free exchange of 
information and to allow dialogue about the uses of computers in edu- 
cation." System organization is logical and instructions to- new users are 
clear and straightforward. You can make connections twenty-four hours 
a day, every day, by calling (203) 629-4375. 

Conference Corner. Computer fairs, conferences, and other such 
events can provide excellent opportunities to give and get information, 
have new experiences, and make personal contacts. Of course, you just 
may leave one of these gatherings with more questions than you had 
when you arrived, but that's better than being bored, isn't it? 

Apple owners living in and around Anaheim, California, or Bos- 
ton, Massachusetts, can look forward to Applefests in both these cities 



come spring. Anaheim's Applefest will take place April 15—17 at the 
Anaheim Convention Center; Boston's gathering will be happening May 
13-15 at the Bayside Exposition Center. In addition to hundreds of ex- 
hibits, both shows will feature seminars, workshops, panel discussions, 
and "software spotlights." To find out more, contact Northeast Exposi- 
tions, 826 Boylston Street, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167; (617) 739-2000 or 
(800) 841-7000. 

Ed-Com Spring '83 will be held April 28-30 at the Convention Cen- 
ter in Washington, D.C. Hardware, software, and computer-related pub- 
lications will be on display in the exhibit hall, with demos, seminars, 
hands-on sessions, and microcourses for educators planned. Presenta- 
tion topics will include CAI, administrative and class management uses 
of computers, computer literacy, programming, authoring languages, 
and research applications. For more information, contact Judco Com- 
puter Expos, 2629 North Scottsdale Road, Suite 201, Scottsdale, AZ 
85257; (800) 528-2355 outside Arizona; (602) 990-1715 in Arizona. 

And then there's the event that people at North Carolina State Uni- 
versity are calling "the little conference that grew." According to Profes- 
sor Sarah Burton in the department of English, the Sixth International 
Conference on Computers and the Humanities promises to be an inform- 
ative, impressive, and well-attended event (preregistration is essential). 
General areas being addressed by speakers will include the moral, social, 
and philosophical implications of using computers in the humanities; cre- 
ative writing and microcomputers; linguistic analysis; CAI program- 
ming and artificial intelligence; and CAI in foreign language instruction. 
Dictionary production, lexicography, and linguistics will also be dis- 
cussed, and presentations on computer literacy and telecommunications 
are planned. 

The conference will take place June 6—8 at North Carolina State. 
For more information, contact Sarah Burton, ICCH, Department of 
English, North Carolina State University, Box 5308, Raleigh, NC 27650. 

Magazine Madness. The number of magazines devoted to com- 
puters in education (or to some specialized facet of the subject) seems to 
have doubled in the last six months or so. Three new ones to watch for 
are Teaching and Computers, Family Computing, and Microzine, all from 
Scholastic (730 Broadway, New York, NY 10003; (212) 505-3000). 

According to editorial director Jack Roberts, Teaching and Com- 
puters was created in response to teachers' requests for nontechnical in- 
formation about computers and practical ideas on how to use them in 
the classroom. The monthly magazine is designed "to help teachers learn 
about the computer, to help them teach their students about the com- 
puter, and to help them teach on a daily basis with the computer." It will 
be published eight times a year, starting in September 1983; meanwhile, a 
pilot get-acquainted issue is being sent to teachers, school principals, and 
other educators across the country. 

Scheduled to begin publication in September 1983 is Scholastic's 
Family Computing. According to the company, the monthly magazine is 
intended to supply "practical, easily understandable information on how 
to use computers for learning and fun on a day-to-day basis." Family 
Computing will address parents but will contain articles for young peo- 
ple as well. 

Microzine is a bimonthly publication especially for kids ages eight to 
fourteen. According to Scholastic, it's a magazine on disk (or cassette, if 
you prefer) "designed to allow kids to participate in each of its features, 
rather than simply read them." The company plans to have the first issue 
in retail outlets some time this month. 

Another magazine on disk, available now, is Window, a bimonthly. 
Window's regular components include a feature article, a feature pro- 
gram (in the second issue, the program was Notebook, a simple, well-ex- 



116

plained file-management system for home and classroom use), columns 
on Logo and VisiCalc, and reviews that allow readers to see samples of 
programs before buying them. Future plans call for issues that focus on 
music, graphics, and language. 

To learn more, contact Window, Suite N, 469 Pleasant Street, Water- 
town, MA 02172; (617) 923-9147. 

Still another magazine on disk is The Political Science Micro Review, 
an ambitious new publication from the Public Service Research and 
Computer Laboratory at North Carolina State University's department 
of political science and public administration. The nonprofit venture is 
designed to promote communication among political scientists who 
use micros. 

Published quarterly, the Review consists of a twenty-five-page newslet- 
ter (primarily Apple-oriented) and a disk for the Apple II. Each disk issue 
contains at least one public administration program, one tutorial on 
some aspect of programming, and one utility program, while each news- 
letter installment includes reviews of software for political scientists, pro- 
gramming tips and listings, and reports from readers about their experi- 
ences using microcomputers in political science and public administra- 
tion. Professor Dave Garson, Review editor, encourages readers to par- 
ticipate by submitting articles and letters to the newsletter and programs 
to the disk version of the publication. For more information, contact 
Micro Review, PSPA Link 215, North Carolina State University, 
Raleigh, NC 27511. 

Another University-based publication is Collegiate Microcomputer, 
edited by Brian J. Winkel, an associate professor of mathematics at 
Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and published by the institute. 
According to the publisher, this new quarterly publication is intended to 
be "a forum for the exchange of ideas on the role of microcomputers in 
all areas of college and university life." It will include accounts of hard- 
ware and software uses, experiences with microcomputer consulting and 
workshops, and results of research using microcomputers, as well as anal- 
yses of experiments in microcomputer use, student projects, and reviews 
of software, hardware, products, and literature. University professionals 
and libraries are expected to be the journal's primary audience. 

To learn more, contact Collegiate Microcomputer, Rose-Hulman In- 



stitute of Technology, Terre Haute, IN 47803. 

The Interactive Education Foundation, a nonprofit research organi- 
zation in Stony Brook, New York, has begun publishing The Logo and 
Educational Computing Journal. The journal is addressed to teachers who 
use microcomputers in the classroom, educators who use or create edu- 
cational software, and parents and children who use microcomputers at 
home. Editor Al Weiner invites readers to take an active role in the mag- 
azine by sharing their ideas and experiences; Logo, educational soft- 
ware, and artificial intelligence are of particular interest. Constructive 
criticism, disagreements with conventional wisdom, and cantankerous 
insights are also welcome, says Weiner. 

For more information, contact The Logo and Educational Comput- 
ing Journal, The Interactive Education Foundation, 1320 Stony Brook 
Road, Stony Brook, NY 11790. 

The February issue of The Arithmetic Teacher, published by the Na- 
tional Council of Teachers of Mathematics, is a "focus issue" on teach- 
ing mathematics with microcomputers. If you're interested in seeing how 
microcomputers can be used to teach mathematics better, you'll want to 
get a copy of this outstanding issue. It contains separate articles on teach- 
ing mathematics in the primary and middle grades as well as in junior 
high school, an article on training teachers to work with microcom- 
puters, and a thought-provoking piece about micros and the mentally 
gifted. You'll also learn how microcomputers can be used in the teach- 
ing of mathematical concepts, computational skills, problem solving, es- 
timation, and reasoning. Information on where to learn more about 
computers is also included, as is an excellent glossary of computer terms. 

Copies of this issue are available from The National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics, 1906 Association Drive, Reston, VA 22091; 
(703 ) 620-9840. 

Directory Details. Instructor magazine is now compiling informa-

All's Fair in Love and Assembly Language 
Programming on the Apple 

Buying a copy of Roger Wagner's Assembly Lines: The Book means never having to 
say you're sorry. 

Your programming friends will be pea-green with envy. They'll scratch their heads 
and ponder the beauty of your self-modifying code and indirect jumps. They'll beg to 
hear more about I/O routines, the stack, and sound generation. 

In short, you can lord it over your local programming enclave as long as someone 
else doesn't buy Wagner's book. Then you'll be in trouble. 

But at least you'll have a head start. You'll already have mastered branch offsets and 
reverse branches. Reading a game paddle, comparing commands, and carrying the flag 
will already be under your belt. 

Assembly Language: The Book costs $19.95, plus $1.50 postage and handling if you 
order direct from Softalk. Assembly Language: The Book is also available in many fine 
computer stores around the country. 

If you are attending the Anaheim Applefest April 15-17, please stop by the Softalk 
Publishing booth. You can pick up a copy of Wagner's book and meet the 
folks who bring you Softalk, Softline, and Softdisk. 

See you there!

THETURXLE 

A Schoolhouse Apple 
Tu t o r i a I 

LOGO 

DONNA BEARDEH 

In the various designs and pictures we've created, we've taught the 
turtle to draw, and we've moved him with the FD, BK, RT and LT com- 
mands. It's also possible to move the turtle by means of the X and Y co- 
ordinates. But did you ever think about drawing a picture using the co- 
ordinates? It's a fun way to learn to use the coordinate system. 

First, let's figure out how the coordinate system works in Logo. Place 
the turtle at HOME facing the top of the screen. HOME is 0, and every 
step the turtle goes FORWARD toward the top of the screen is a posi- 
tive step. Exactly how many steps can he go before he slips off the top of 
the screen and wraps around to the bottom? Return the turtle to HOME 
and this time go BACKWARD toward the bottom of the screen. Think 
of every BACKWARD step as a negative step. (In fact, one way to tell 
the turtle to go BK 10 is to tell him to go FD - 10.) How far can he go? 

Once you've figured out the up and down dimensions of the screen, 
there's a quick way to tell the turtle exactly where to go above or below 
the mid-line. It is SETY, followed by a space and a number. The num- 
ber will be positive for the positions above the midpoint and negative for 
the positions below the midpoint. Remember to use the PENUP com- 
mand first or the turtle will draw from one position to the next; right now 
we just want him to hop. 

That takes care of up and down. What about side to side? Return the 
turtle to HOME and rotate him RIGHT 90. He should now be facing 
the right side of the screen. Figure out how many steps he can go for- 
ward before he wraps. Return him to HOME, rotate him RT 90 (or 
SETH 90), and this time go BACKWARD toward the left edge of 
the screen. 

The positions to the right of HOME are positive and those to the left 
are negative. To tell the turtle to go to the left or right, use SETX, fol- 
lowed by a space and a number. Try several commands, using positive 
numbers and negative numbers, and watch the turtle jump back and 
forth across the screen. 

By using both an X and a Y command, we can place the turtle any- 
where on the screen. Try hopping the turtle, alternating between an X 
command and a Y command. Then try putting the two together into a 
single command, like this: 

MIT LOGO: SETXY and two numbers, the first for X and the second 
for Y. If Y is a negative number, it must be enclosed in parentheses. 

Apple Logo: SETPOS [ J. The two numbers for X and Y are en- 
closed in brackets. 

Now let's have the turtle draw some "graph paper" on the screen. 
Then we can hop him around on the graph paper by giving him X and Y 
commands. To draw the graph we'll have to use recursion and a 
conditional.

The unique word 
challenge game. 

It offers intellectual stimulation arcade games can't 
match . . . with all the excitement. 

Fast-action fun isn't just for mystery or arcade games any 
more. Cross Clues is a word game that tests more than 
mere reflexes. It's the mind-challenging evolution of the 
crossword puzzle, with beat-the-clock excitement. The 
playing tempo is lively, but you decide how fast you want 
to go. The computer "umpires" while you compete with 
another player for hidden words, coaxing clues from the 
computer. Since a clue helps your opponent too, suspense 
builds till the end, when the best combination of skill, 
intellect, timing and luck wins. 

If you're ready for an even greater challenge, try 
Concentration Crosswords'," 1 a game that offers 3 levels 
of difficulty and 3 ways to play — for even the most 
demanding word whiz. Again, you compete against the 
clock to uncover hidden words. But once discovered, they 
disappear, to test your memory. Here, a combination ol 
word skills, intellect, memory and luck determine the 
winner. 

Both games offer 50 mind-boggling puzzles that appeal 
to young teens through adults. Try them both! You may 
find you've matched wits with monsters and space critters 
long enough.

MIT LOGO: The MIT version of the procedure is like the Apple ver- 
sion. Just remove the brackets from the conditional commands in 
XLINES and YLINES. 

Now just pick up the pen and hop the turtle from one point on the 
"graph paper" to another. With this setup two people can play "Hop the 
Turtle" by placing colored stickers at certain points on the graph and see- 
ing how quickly they can figure out the coordinates. 

Connect the Dots. Does the fact that you have to pick the pen up be- 
fore you give the X and Y commands to the turtle suggest another way 
to draw? How about keeping the pen down and trying to draw a picture 
by telling the turtle what coordinates to go to? It's like drawing a dot-to- 
dot on the computer! 

This connect-the-dots activity is also a good one for two people. The 
first person plots a picture on a piece of graph paper — the real kind that 
you can wad up and throw in the trash can if you're not happy with 
your artistic efforts. For starters, select a simple picture or design and 
transfer it to the graph paper. Figure out the coordinates for the outline 
and list them on a separate sheet of paper. The second person then takes 
the list, plots all the points on another sheet of graph paper, and con- 
nects them in the order they were listed. 

Remember that the first number is always the X coordinate and the 
second number is always the Y coordinate. It's a good idea to start with 
simple designs and then move up to more complex ones. Included here 
are two designs for starters, a simple sailboat and a more difficult 
elephant.

Let's check out how these designs work on the computer. First, pick 
the PENUP and go to the first coordinate listed. Now, put the PEN- 
DOWN and tell the turtle to SETPOS [ ] (Apple) or to SETXY 

(MIT). Continue down the list of positions for either the sailboat 



119 



or the elephant; you'll discover that your turtle can draw quite well with 
X and Y. 

Here's one more just for fun — a turtle, or course! Once he was drawn 
his shell looked so empty that it seemed to cry out for a design; hence the 
addition of a hexagon spiral. You're welcome to add your own design. 
The procedures are written in Apple Logo. To change them to MIT 
Logo, use the command SETXY instead of SETPOS. Remember, if the 
Y coordinate is negative, it must be enclosed in parentheses. The only 
other change to be made for MIT is to remove the brackets from STOP 
in the spiral procedures.

Free Enterprise 

A business management game 

You run your own company making decisions based 
on economic factors and the actions of competitors. 

It's your opportunity to sit on top and run a corporation. 
Free Enterprise, based on an IBM-developed simulation 
for training top-level managers, is as surprising and 
demanding as the real world. 

It lets you face the same on-your-toes challenges you 
would in running a real business: pricing products, 
determining budgets for advertising, production, plant 
improvement, and R&D. Even securing bank loans and 
deciding on stockholder dividends. You use computer 
generated reports to make decisions. But if you're wrong 
you could go bankrupt. Only the shrewd survive! 

Free Enterprise can be played at three competency levels 
so novices can compete with the more experienced, and 
from one to six can play. It's the perfect chance to learn 
about the free enterprise system — to practice business 
strategies — and to enjoy it — with no risks. 

Simulation components: disk, user's manual, pad of 50 
record sheets, and pad of 50 decision sheets. 

To obtain Free Enterprise, see your local dealer or 
send in the order form below. 

Operates on Apple II Plus® with 48k RAM and disk 
drive (DOS 3.3): A printer is strongly recommended.

Par/ 4: Bars and Lines 



If your only experience with bars and lines to date is standing in lines 
at bars, you are about to see a whole new world open up to you. The 
Bar/ Line Chart program is the culmination of the SoftGraph series — the 
most complex piece of code in the system. 

The original intention was to have two programs, one each for bar 
and line charts; but so many of the calculations needed to create the two 
types of charts were the same that it was deemed more efficient to com- 
bine the two. This is fortunate, because it allows us to create combina- 
tion charts fairly easily. 

Before we begin entering Bar/Line Chart, we have to create some 
more shapes. If the memory of January's experience with shape tables 
still keeps you up nights, worry not. This batch is much smaller. It con- 
sists of the four symbols we'll use to distinguish one line from another in 
the line charts. 

This program pokes in the new shape table. Type it, run it, and put it 
away. That is, save it under some innocuous file name in case the shapes 
mutate and you need to fix them.

This chart of the first quarter of 1983 is taken from the same data as 
charts on subsequent pages. Moving the begin and end pointers 
limited this chart to the three-month period shown, even though the

150 DATA 0 

Having run this program, save the shape table generated by it with 
the command 

BSAVE B/L.SHAPES,A26076,L81 

To see to it that the shape table gets put in when you use SoftGraph, 
add this line to the hello program: 

. 55 PRINT D$;"BLOAD B/L.SHAPES" 

And that is that. SoftGraph now loads and uses two shape tables. 
The only remaining task is to make sure that the program uses the right 
table at any given time. We'll go into that a little later. 

A Software Organ Transplant. You may remember from last month 
that, instead of diving right in with the typing, you had to gather to- 
gether some routines that had been presented previously and build the 
rest of the program around them. That was because some of the neces- 
sary functions performed by the programs in the SoftGraph system 
overlap. 

For instance, we keep the data created by the Data Editor in a spe- 
cial place in RAM so that we can pass it effortlessly from one program to 
the next. All the programs that need to read this data need a routine to

data covered eighteen months. A grid density of four resulted in solid 
grid lines. 



do it with. That routine was first presented in the Data Editor in Feb- 
ruary, as you may recall, and deftly spliced into the Pie Chart program 
during last month's extravaganza. We added to the read routine Jan- 
uary's hi-res print routine, that useful device for getting letters and num- 
bers to do our bidding on the graphics screen. 

As you might expect, we need those routines again. This time, how- 
ever, we can call them up without all the mum bo jumbo. Simply load the 
Pie Chart program and type: 

DEL 10,2420 
DEL 2700,3060 

This action rids us of those parts of Pie Chart that we won't be using 
in Bar I Line Chart. Now we're ready once again to type our fingers to the 
bone in pursuit of a decent graph. 

This first section, as usual, presets the values of certain variables, di- 
mensions the array variables, defines certain functions, and does all the 
other preliminary things.

60 VTAB 10: HTAB 13: PRINT "BAR/LINE CHART"

The variable C$ in line 30 contains the characters that Bar/Line 
Chart's command mode accepts as commands. The last two, CHR$ ( 17) 
and CHR$ (16), are control-Q and control-P. When a command is keyed 
in later on, a routine will use this string to determine what the com- 
mand was. 

A Model of Functionality. The functions defined in line 50 are the 
calculating workhorses of Bar/ Line Chart. FN Y(Y) determines the hi- 
res vertical coordinate associated with a given Y value. FN X(X) deter- 
mines the horizontal coordinate. FN B(X) calculates the starting loca- 
tion of a given bar. The reason these expressions are so complicated is 
that there are many variables to consider in order to make the charts 
flexible. 

The X locations (FN X) vary, depending on the number of X fields, 
which is determined by the difference between the last field selected and 
the first field selected (LX - FX + 1 in the function definition) and the 
width of the Y labels (YW, which is determined elsewhere). Of course, 
the value of X is a factor as well. And that's one of the simpler functions. 

The other variables in the function definitions are VR, for vertical 
resolution (that is, the amount of space allotted to the chart after the size 
of the labels is accounted for); GY and LY, for greatest and least Y 
values; NB, for number of data columns to be graphed as bars; BN, for 
the number of the bar currently being graphed; and B W, for the width of 
each bar, which is calculated elsewhere. That's quite a cast of characters 
to keep track of. 

A word about defined functions. Those equations don't do anything 
this early in the program. Instead, they tell the computer what we'll mean 
later on when we use one of the functions.

tor screen.

Gosub 2500, remember, goes to the read routine, which gets as many 
as eight characters from our data area. This routine does the gosub twice 
for each time through the loop because the legends are sixteen charac- 
ters long, with the two halves stored in separate cells. Line 110 adds 
spaces to the first string to bring it up to eight characters before the sec- 
ond string is added to it. 

Now the labels are read from the X field by this next routine. 

170 REM LABEL READER 
180 HF = 1: FOR VF = 1 TO 18 
190 GOSUB 2500:L$(VF) = W$ 
200 LP = VF 

210 IF LEN (W$) = 0 THEN LP = LP - 1:VF = 18 
220 NEXT VF 
230 LX = LP 

The only thing distinguishing this for-next loop from any other is line 
210. The loop reads labels from memory until it comes across one that is 
blank, at which point it leaves the loop. It doesn't break out of the loop 
with a goto, however. If you do that too many times in a program the 
stack will fill up with return addresses that are never used and you'll 
eventually get an out-of-memory error. Instead, it sets the value of LP to 
the number of the last valid label and sets VF to 18. Then line 220 stops 
executing the loop naturally. 

After the labels are read, the program goes on to read the values.

There's LP again in the VF loop in line 250. This routine won't read 
any data that appears after the last label read by the previous loop. 

These loops take some time to execute when you first run the pro- 
gram, so there is a brief wait before anything is displayed on the screen.

This is as much data as you can put on a single chart with SoftGraph. The 
lower grid density makes the lines stand out. 

After that, however, the program runs quite quickly. Like the Pie Chart 
program, Bar/ Line Chart inputs parameters before plotting anything. 
Here's the section that prints the parameter input screen.

Most of this consists mainly of vtabs, htabs, and prints. Line 350 is 
interesting, though. The labels are printed vertically to make them relate 
visually to the way they will appear on the graph. The easiest way to do 
this is to set the text window to an area one character wide. 

Window Dressing. Typing poke 32, VF * 2 sets the left edge of the 
window to a different value each time, and poke 33,1 sets the window 
width to 1 . Whenever a character is printed, it hits the end of the win- 
dow and the cursor moves down a line, so the string is printed vertically. 
The text command in line 370 opens the window back up to the full 
screen. (You can read more about the text window in Appendix J of the 
Applesoft manual or Appendix F in volume two of the He Applesoft 
manual.) 

The gosub 2950 in line 450 goes to a subroutine that calculates the 
lowest and highest values in the data to be graphed, among other things. 
More on that later. 



This next routine handles command input. 
460 REM MAIN COMMAND INPUT 

470 VTAB 23: HTAB 1: PRINT "COMMANDS: L,B,E,T,Y,C,G 

CONTROL-P.Q.";: CALL - 868

500 IF A$ = MID$ (C$,X,1) THEN A = X 
510 NEXT X: IF A = 0 THEN 480 

520 ON A GOTO 530,660,780,3070,960,900,1080,2920,1200 

Line 470 prints the command prompt. Because of space limitations 
on the screen and the multiplicity of commands available, there's no on- 
screen explanation of each of these commands, so we'll summarize the 
commands here and then discuss each of the routines in turn. 

The loop from 490 through 510 goes through C$ (from line 30) one 
character at a time to determine whether and where the character ac- 
cepted in line 480 has a match. If there is a match, it is assigned a num- 
ber from 1 to the number of the commands, and the on-goto statement 
in line 520 speeds the program to the corresponding routine. This is a 
very elegant command handler, the idea for which (to give credit where 
credit is due) came from the All About Applesoft column. 

A Command Performance. Now then, the commands, in brief. L al- 
lows you to set the chart type, bar or line, for each of the columns of 
data. Because chart types are assigned individually for each column of 
data, you can determine what data to graph and what to ignore. 

B and E work as a pair, allowing you to set the beginning and end la- 
bels for the graph. In other words, if you have data ranging from Jan- 
uary to December, you can limit the graph to a shorter period anywhere 
within that range. 

The T command allows you to enter a title for the chart. Since the 
previous three commands allow you such flexibility in what data to 
graph, you may want to enter a different title each time you make a dif- 
ferent graph from a given set of data. 

Y allows you to set the range of the Y axis. You must enter a num- 
ber for low Y that is less than or equal to the "least value" displayed on 
the left, and assign a high Y that is greater than or equal to the "most 
value," also displayed on the left. The increment must be large enough 
that all the labels will fit along the Y axis of the graph. The program will 
inform you if any of the values you enter is too small or too large, as the 
case may be. 

The C command is a simple toggle for color. G allows you to set grid 
density. Control-Q sends you back to the Menu program, and control-P 
processes the chart. 

This routine responds to the L command

This routine and many of the ones that come later begin with a 
prompt that goes at the bottom of the screen, and this one is no excep- 
tion. The call -868 at the end of line 540 clears away any of the previous 
prompt. Then the routine loops through the four legends, asking you to 
assign a chart type to each. If the legend is empty (that is, it contains only 
eight spaces), line 560 will skip the input section, allowing no chart type 
to be assigned. Otherwise, line 570 would get a character and the lines 
following would handle it. T$(CT(X)) in line 630 contains labels, preset

The begin pointer routine lets you set the beginning of the data to 
graph. A less-than sign appears over the first X label and a greater-than 
sign over the last one, marking the beginning and end of the data to be 
graphed. With this routine you can move the first pointer to a new loca- 
tion and it will reset FX, the first X field, to match it. 

The next routine is virtually identical to the previous one, except that 
it moves the end pointer and changes LX, the last X field.

Mixing bars and lines is as easy as selecting some columns to be lines and 
others to be bars. 

The Y range set routine is most noteworthy for the routines it calls. 
The routine at line 2610 is an eight-digit numeric input routine and the 
one at line 2780 checks to see that the values entered are legal. We'll dis- 
cuss the routines themselves later. 

The next routine inputs grid density. 

1080 REM GRID DENSITY INPUT 

1090 VTAB 23: HTAB 1: PRINT "ENTER NEW GRID DENSITY 

(0-4)";: CALL - 868

1110 IF A < 48 OR A > 52 THEN 1100 
1 120 PRINT A$;:GD = A - 48: GOTO 460 

Like so many of the input routines in SoftGraph, this one doesn't ac- 
cept answers that are outside of the legal parameters. It's unique in that it 
uses the ASC function to evaluate the input string (line 1 100) rather than 
using VAL. This is because VAL evaluates most illegal input as zero, but 
in this case zero is within the legal range. 

Now we get to the lengthy procedures the program uses to plot a 
graph. This first section determines the width of the longest label in the Y 
range you specified. 

1200 REM DETERMINE Y LABEL WIDTH 

1210 YW = 0: FOR X = LY TO GY STEP Yl 

1220 IF LEN ( STR$ (X)) > YW THEN YW = LEN ( STR$ (X))

1240 YW = (YW + 1) * 6 

1250 REM ERROR CHECK 

1260 GOSUB 2780 

1270 IF ER = 1 THEN 460 

After a simple length-checking loop, the program executes a gosub to 
line 2780, the same error-checking routine mentioned before, to see if 
everything will be okay. If the Y range is illegal (ER = 1), line 1270 re- 
turns you to the parameter input screen with an error message. 



If everything is okay, the action on the hi-res screen begins with the 
next routine.

1490 D = 1 :F = 2 

Lines 1 280 through 1490 draw the axes of the graph and the grid, if 
any. The grid-density variable (GD) exerts its influence on the step of the 
for-next loops beginning at lines 1410 and 1460. 

After the grid is laid down, the bars are plotted, the zero line is put in 
and the line charts are then drawn. This order has the effect of overlay- 
ing things in an appealing way. First the bars:

If the hplot coordinates in line 1600 don't make sense to you, go back 
to the discussion of the defined functions at the beginning of the pro- 
gram. The color bar routine is simpler than the black-and-white one that 
follows because color bars can be constructed with vertical lines of a 
given color. It is harder to establish four different patterns that are read- 
ily distinguishable in black and white.

A year's worth of data charted with lines. As many as four different lines can 
be distinguished by the four key shapes. 

through 1750). All of the black-and-white bars are outlined with white 
(line 1770) to make them stand out better. 
Next the bar legends are written in. 

1790 REM BAR LEGENDS 

1800 Y = 175: IF BN > 2 OR NG < 3 THEN Y = 184 
1810 X = 10: IF BN / 2 = INT (BN / 2) THEN X = 150 
1820 IF CO THEN 1860 
1830 HCOLOR= BN - 1 

1840 IF BN = 3 THEN FOR Y1 = Y TO Y + 5 STEP 2: HPLOT X,Y1 

TO X + 8,Y1: NEXT Y1: GOTO 1890 
1850 GOTO 1870 

1860 HCOLOR= BN: IF BN = 4 THEN HCOLOR= 5 

1870 FOR X1 = X TO X + 8: HPLOT X1,Y TO X1,Y + 5: NEXT X1 

1880 IF CO THEN 1900 

1890 HCOLOR= 3: HPLOTX.Y - 1 TO X,Y + 5TOX 4- 8,Y + 5TOX 

+ 8,Y - 1 TO X,Y - 1 
1900 X = X + 20:W$ = LE$(N) 
1910 HCOLOR= 3: GOSUB 9000 
1920 NEXT N 

1930 HCOLOR= 3: HPLOT YW, FN Y(0) TO FN X(LX - FX + 1.5), 
FN Y(0) 

The procedure to create the key marker for the bar legends is much 
the same as the procedure to create the bars, whether the bars are mono- 
chrome or color. Then the word to be written is determined and a gosub 
to line 9000 is executed to write the string. Line 1930 plots a white hori- 
zontal line where Y equals zero to make that axis stand out. 

The lines are plotted next. 

1940 REM LINES 

1950 LN = 0 

1960 FOR N = 1 TO 4 

1970 IF CT(N) <> 1 THEN 2130 

1980 POKE 232,220: POKE 233,101 

1990 LN = LN + 1 

2000 HCOLOR= 3 

2010 HPLOT FN X(1), FN Y(V(FX,N)) 

2020 FOR C = FX TO LX 

2030 HPLOT TO FN X(C + 1 - FX), FN Y(V(C,N)) 

2040 DRAW LN AT FN X(C + 1 - FX), FN Y(V(C,N)) 

2050 NEXT C 

2060 REM LINE LEGENDS 

2070 Y = 175: IF NB + LN > 2 OR NG < 3 THEN Y = 184 

2080 X = 10: IF (NB + LN) 12 = INT ((NB + LN) 12) THEN X = 150 

2090 DRAW LN AT X + 3,Y + 2 

2095 HPLOT X - 4,Y + 4 TO X + 10,Y + 1 

2100 X = X + 20:W$ = LE$(N) 

2110 POKE 232,0: POKE 233,96 



The lines routine is a piece of cake. Line 1980 sets the pointers to the 
second shape table, which contains the markers identifying the lines in 
the legend. Because the program charts the same lines for color or mono- 
chrome, the line plotting is all accomplished in a simple loop from lines 
2020 through 2050. The legends for the lines are handled next, in lines 
2060 through 2130, thus completing the outer loop. Line 2110 turns the 
first shape table back on. 

Now the program finishes up with the axis labels and the chart title. 

2140 REM Y LABELS 

2150 FOR YL = LY TO GY STEP Yl 

2160 W$ = STR$ (YL) 

2170 X = YW - 6 * LEN (W$) 

2180 Y = FN Y(YL) - 2 

2190 GOSUB 9000 

2200 NEXT YL 

2210 REM X LABELS 

2220 FOR XL = FX TO LX 

2230 W$ = L$(XL) 

2240 Y = FN Y(LY) + 2 

2250 IF LD THEN 2300 

2260 X = FN X(XL + 1 - FX) - 3 * LEN (W$) + 3 

2270 D = 1:F = 2 

2280 GOSUB 9000 

2290 GOTO 2330 

2300 X = FN X(XL + 1 - FX) 

2310 D = 2:F = 1 

2320 GOSUB 9000 

2330 NEXT XL 

2340 D = 1:F = 2 

2350 IF T$ = "" THEN 2380 

2360 X = 140 - 3 * LEN (T$):Y = 2 

2370 W$ = T$: GOSUB 9000 

The positioning of the labels is designed to make them as readable as 
possible. The Y axis labels are placed flush right against the axis. The po- 
sition calculation is made in line 2170. Line 2260 centers the X axis la- 
bels under their corresponding locations. In the same way, line 2360 cen- 
ters the chart title on the top of the screen. 

With the chart completed, the next routine presents your options.

This is largely the same as the Pie Chart exit, except for the addition 
of the escape feature in line 2930.

Finally, the last routine does the input of the title. We could almost 
have used a simple input statement for this, but if we hadn't limited the

We didn't include any graph-printing programs in this system. The 
reason is that every printer works differently. The Silentype from Apple 
has a graphics dump program built in, as do several printer interfaces. 
Many dot-matrix printers have a graphics capability but need a special 
program to interpret the data. There are several programs available for 
various printers — too many to discuss here. Your dealer can probably 
answer any questions you have about your system's capabilities for print- 
ing graphics. 

In any case, there are a few things to remember when printing charts 
generated by SoftGraph. First of all, all charts are on hi-res page two. If 
your program or printer has the option, unidirectional printing is usual- 
ly better than bidirectional for graphics. Lastly, with some programs you 
will have to specify printing in inverse. The white-on-black of the screen 
should become black-on-white when printed out. 

AJFond Farewell. That completes the SoftGraph system, or at least 
that's as far as we'll go with it together. It's been said that no work of art 
is ever truly finished, only interrupted. The same is true for computer 
software. There is a lot more that can be done with the system. Scatter 
plots and histograms are one direction to go in, if such is your bent. An- 
other would be to incorporate the aforementioned graphics dump rou- 
tines, or picture packers, or even VisiCalc file converters. We've really 
only begun, but it's a firm beginning, a solid foundation on which to 
build an even larger system. 

The ball's in your court. Ji

A NEW CONCEPT IN STATIC CONTROL 



YOU'LL NEVER TOUCH A 
"NAKED" COMPUTER AGAIN! 



A "naked" computer is any computer that 
sits on a bare table or desk top, without a 
TouchMat™ static dissipative table mat 
directly under it. 

"NAKED" COMPUTERS ABE 
VULNERABLE to some of the most 
frustrating static-related problems a computer 
user can encounter — erratic or erroneous data 
transmission, loss of programs or data, damage 
to discs or accessory cards, component failure, 
or "unexplained" clown time. 

During the dry winter heating season, you are 
probably more aware of static electricity 
because you can feel it. However, your 
computer is vulnerable to a much smaller ZAP 
than you can possibly feel, and that level of 
static may occur at any time of the year. Even 
air conditioning can aggravate the problem by 
drying the air. 

IT ONLY TM(ES ONE ZAP to make your 
perfectlylom^emputer act irrational and 
tempeMi^iy Experienced computer urers 
knowlnjpKtic electricity cannot be j^mpjetely 
elimina^from the environment Qfi 
mjcMomputer, since people are 
. nerators of static. The bestsoluJPTis to 
nannel static charges harmlesjjPaway before 
they have a chance to spark J^ensitive 
components and accessor!' 



THE TOUCHMAT SlTS ON THE TABLE, 

directly under the computer, within easy reach 
of your hands and fingers, to discharge static 
from your body, simply touch the mat before 
turning on the computer, and then periodically 
during operation. 

Discharging takes less than a second, does not 
produce a spark, and is absolutely assured by 
the simple fact that your skin contacts the mat 
directly. (The sweat layer of the human skin is a 
primary conductor of electricity.) Anytime your 
hands or wrists rest on the mat, static discharge 
is automatic. 

A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT OVER 
CONDUCTIVE FLOOR MATS, the 

TouchMat does not require users to wear 
leather-soled shoes for effective static 
discharge. A floor mat may be rendered virtually 
ineffective by today's popular synthetic and 
rubber-soled shoes, which insulate the user.

NAME SAYS HAYDEN, 



Four Thousand Years of Challenge 

According to legend, GO was invented over 
four thousand years ago, by the great Chinese 
Emperor Shun. And it has defied being mas- 
tered ever since! With chess, you fight one battle 
at a time, while GO is more like a war: multiple 
battles take place on the 19 x 19 grid simultane- 
ously. Its rules are quite simple and easy to learn 
yet the number of possible combinations is 
almost limitless. In fact, one former World Chess 
Champion considers GO more challenging 
than chess! Play GO against the smartest per- 
son you know or against your own computer. 
Maybe in a thousand years or so you'll master it. 



A Classic Game of Strategy 

Reversal is another ancient game, with origins 
going back centuries. Simply trap your oppo- 
nent's piece between two of yours, and capture 
the piece for yourself. But the move that cap- 
tures the most pieces may not be the wisest. 
Reversal has a way of turning the tables on you! 
Hayden's Reversal has nine levels of play, with 
three strategy levels within each. It is a fascinat- 
ing game even for young children— the playing 
pieces change expression as the advantage 
shifts from win to tie to loss. Yet Reversal will 
test the most gifted adult. It is the winner of the 
First Man-Machine Othello* Tournament and, 
at its top level, has never been beaten! You can 
even play against a human opponent— but that 
might soon be too easy for you!

Cut down your phone time. The TransModem 1200 
cuts long distance costs by sending and receiving elec- 
tronic information faster. 

The TransModem 1200 runs at the most widely used 
baud rates — 110, 300, or 1200 — so you can easily commu- 
nicate with any computer, including other personal com- 
puters, public information services, and timeshare 
systems. 

You don't even have to set the data transfer speed. The 
TransModem 1200 automatically adjusts the baud rate to 
match the speed of any modem on the other end of the 
line. 

You can't find a better equipped modem for the 



money. The TransModem 1200 completes calls where 
other modems cannot get through. It dials and answers 
high speed Touch Tone™ or Pulse dial telephones auto- 
matically. It stores telephone numbers of up to 32 digits, 
enabling you to dial MCI Advantage™ or Sprint® automat- 
ically. And Transend™ software is available, so you don't 
have to do any programming.

Pat Carroll 

An Apple Is 
An Apple Is 
An Apple 

BY harcot (omTog TOHHERYIK 

When Pat Carroll began working on her characterization of Ger- 
trude Stein more than four years ago, even she didn't know why Stein 
held such a fascination for her. She had never much liked Stein's writing. 

Carroll was bedridden at the time after a knee operation. Perhaps it 
was the need for a project to occupy her; or perhaps she recognized that 
she could convey Stein's physical presence. 

It wasn't until the show, Gertrude Stein Gertrude Stein Gertrude 
Stein, had been on the boards several years that a shared spirit between 
these two women became clear. It wasn't until Pat Carroll bought her 
Apple. 

Matisse, Cezanne, and Picasso. It was in 1904 that Gertrude Stein 
left her native San Francisco to make her home in Paris with her brother 
Leo. Leo Stein was an art connoisseur and a collector and Gertrude took 
an apt interest in his work. Together they discovered and began to col- 
lect Cezanne and later Picasso. An argument over who actually discov- 
ered Picasso ended amicably with the two agreeing that Leo had indeed 
discovered Picasso's painting, but Gertrude had discovered Picasso the 
man. 

At the time, no one else had discovered either, nor Matisse nor Ce- 
zanne. The Steins were fascinated by the new ideas of these struggling 
young artists, concepts that were to be boiled down to the term cubism. 
Gertrude Stein especially worked to understand the theory behind 
cubism, and she saw it as the turning point in art, as the means by which 
art was to move into the twentieth century. 

The ideas so moved and excited Stein that she sought to carry them 
over into literature through her own writing. Just as the rest of the world 
was not ready to accept Picasso, so it was not ready for cubist stories. 
Gertrude Stein worked at her craft and kept her faith in her work for 
more than a quarter century before anyone other than she herself saw fit 
to publish any of her writings. 

She did publish her own works. And her friends read them. She had 
many friends, she and Leo at first, and then she and Alice B. Toklas. 
They opened their Paris home to their friends in the art colony every Sat- 
urday night for discussion and sharing and criticism in a series of salons. 
The Stein salon is familiar today to people who cannot tell you who Stein 
was, for it became the gathering place not only of Picasso and Matisse, 
but of the American expatriates living in Paris. Hemingway visited; so 
did the Fitzgeralds. 

Gertrude Stein recognized a significant movement and embraced it 
with excitement and vigor. She would not be left behind; she had the vi- 
sion to see the future and to know she wanted a place in it. 

Wozniak, Turmell, and Sullivan. And here is where Pat Carroll and 
her Apple come in. Pat Carroll looks into the future and sees computers, 
everywhere — in art, in homes, in theater; they are our ticket into the 
twenty-first century. She sees a significant movement and embraces it 
with excitement and vigor. She will not be left behind. 

Carroll has made this eminently clear. When she read recently in a 
national newsmagazine that anyone born before 1955 was too old to be 
part of the computer age, Carroll would have none of it. 

"It was a challenge!" she declares. "An open challenge. I'd show 
them how left out we are." 

And she did, and she wasn't. 

Gertrude Stein's new world was cubism. Pat Carroll's new world is

Her marvelously expressive face is 
seldom still, seldom long without a smile 
(above). In years past, Carroll joined 
Doris Day in With Six You Get Eggroll 
(upper center) and spoofed with Sid 
Caesar on Caesar's Hour (upper right). 
Carroll expounds positively on something 
near and dear, at home as herself (lower 
left) and onstage as Gertrude Stein 
(lower right). 



computers. The curiosity, the excitement, the gusto are the same. 

Theater Theater Theater. Carroll was twelve when she fell in love 
with the theater; and she had never been to a live theater in her life. She 
was reading a play, the first play she'd ever read, a play called The Pass- 
ing of the Third Floor Back by Jerome K. Jerome. An only child, she was 
an avid reader, and by the age of thirteen she'd read all of Eugene 
O'Neill. 

Her mother wisely pointed her toward the local community theater, 
and fate was sealed. Carroll pursued community and little theater as a 
teenager; during college in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., she acted 
with the USO and in radio, becoming a civilian actress technician for the 
Second Army. When school was through, she was ready to do just about 
anything in her chosen career. 

The anything that was happening then was television. Carroll's first 
stint was on the Red Buttons Show in 1952; later she was a regular on the 
Danny Thomas Show and appeared on the Carol Burnett, Danny Kaye, 
and Red Skelton shows. And Caesar's Hour. Her work with Sid Caesar 
earned her an Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Emmy in 1956. 

Pat Carroll was a working actress, not a skyrocketing superstar who 
could pick and choose her roles and her schedule. She had to be flexible, 




and she was flexible. She could play the cabarets, and she did, with great 
success in New York City and in the Pocono resorts doing weekly origi- 
nal revues. She could play light comedy, and she did, costarring in nu- 
merous movies of the genre. She could play games (even then), and she 
did, participating as guest celebrity on television game shows. And she 
could delight with the warm, generous, slightly irreverent personality that 
was her own, and she did, on the full circuit of talk shows. Today she has 
more than two hundred fifty roles as a stock actress in drama and musi- 
cal comedy under her belt. She's a working actress and she's done her 
work well. 

Pat Carroll feels strongly about working actors, meaning that vast 
majority of actors who aren't superstars and never amass superriches but 
who earn their living at their craft. She'd like more of us to realize they 
exist; the extraordinary salary for a few weeks' work, Carroll points out, 
often represents the only work an actor has in his field for a year or 
more. 

Always, Carroll's fondest love is the theater. There are two kinds of 
watchers, she says; audiences and spectators. "Watchers are manipulated 
in movies and TV; they're spectators. But theater is two-way; it must be 
reacted to. At a live play, the audience participates." Audience reaction 




147 




and response interact with the players and affect the performance. 

At one performance of Gertrude Stein Gertrude Stein Gertrude Stein, 
when Carroll as Stein muses about what she has just been saying, "I 
wonder if that was clear?" Carroll was startled to hear a woman's voice 
from the audience respond benevolently, "Absolutely, my dear; you may 
continue." The audience is a doer, not a viewer. 

New Lore That Stretches and Saves. Carroll sees no incongruity be- 
tween theater and computers. "Theater has a relationship to higher 
mathematics; you can feel it," she says. So has music, which is the one 
pure art. If she were to come back in another life, Carroll might choose 
to be a composer. Of computer-generated music, no doubt. 

Carroll is like a good audience; she is a doer, not a viewer, in life. 
And among her favorite things to do is anything that involves learning. 

"Anything you learn is exciting; learning itself intrigues me. That 
wonderful muscle, the brain, intrigues me. It needs learning to keep from 
being bored — otherwise it just wallows in its own juices." 

And everything we learn enhances all our other knowledge. Carroll is 
not a talented painter, for instance; but some years ago she enrolled in a 
life-drawing class. At first, her attempts were awful, but a good teacher 
showed her how to look at the subject and transfer it to paper. She has

no ambition of becoming an Escher, but she came out of the class with a 
much richer ability to see everything. The discipline served its purpose. 

That Carroll saw her intellectual curiosity and respect for the mind 
reflected in Gertrude Stein is certainly one of the attractions that drew 
her to Stein. In an article in Horizon magazine in late 1980, Carroll said 
of Stein, "She was a woman who took pride in the mind and what it can 
do — see deep, think clear, say short. She made thinking itself a valid pas- 
time, mandatory if we are to survive as civilized beings in this increasing- 
ly barbaric century." 

The same could be said of Pat Carroll. 

Computers present a new kind of learning, Carroll believes. The 
process requires and stretches the imagination; and the end result is im- 
mediate. Computers call on a new kind of concentration. "They'll have a 
tremendous impact on psychology," she muses. 

"How exciting it is to be in on the new wave," Carroll exclaims. She 
feels fortunate to have been part of the early days of television, when 
shows were performed live and broadcast on the spot — what you might 
call real-time, in computer game lingo. When you saw Sid Caesar on 
Caesar's Hour in the fifties, he was at that very minute performing on a 
stage in New York exactly what you were seeing on your TV screen. 
And, incidentally, Carroll was probably with him. 

Now Carroll is even more excited about the microcomputer wave. 
She sees it as having a much more far-reaching impact than early televi- 
sion. Not all that Pat Carroll foresees is good, but the microcomputer's 
part in it is. 

"Ten years from now, we'll all have computers," Carroll says. "That 
will be our main means of communication." 

As the world becomes less safe, and she is resigned that it will, our 
homes will become our fortresses; we'll not leave them unless we must. 
Our means of reaching out — and a wonderful, saving means — will be 
our microcomputers. 

A Rose Is a Rose Is a Rose. When Pat Carroll found herself mysteri- 
ously drawn toward Gertrude Stein as the individual she'd portray in the 
one-woman play she'd always wanted to do, she immersed herself in 
Stein and Stein memorabilia. In an eighteen-year-old from Texas, she 
found a willing protege, a pen pal, and a playwright. Marty Martin had 
been writing plays since the age of ten, and had forty that he was proud 
of by the time he met Pat Carroll. He asked her to read a few. 

He picked the right person, because Carroll has strong feelings for 
the new theater people just trying to make a go of it. She goes out of her 
way to help, giving generously of her time and herself — the irreplaceable 
gifts. 

Martin did something else right. When Carroll pointed out that some 
of his plays were a good four hours long — much too long for modern 
theater — he responded, "Oh, that's all right — how's the writing?" Car- 
roll loved his positiveness, and thence came their correspondence. 

When Carroll felt the Stein piece was ready to be written, she called 
Martin. He leaped at the project, even decorating his home to simulate 
the atmosphere of Stein's while he wrote. The finished play ran much too 
long, as might have been expected, but Carroll liked it. She called Mary 
Ellyn Devery, a good friend and a producer with the Theatre Guild, to 
undertake the production. Devery, delighted, selected director Milton 
Moss, whose first task it was to help Carroll, via phone and tape be- 
cause she was simultaneously on the road with a tour of Pippin, edit 
Martin's script to size. 

From there rehearsals began — while Carroll did a movie — and final- 
ly they began trying the nearly finished product on willing friends. Ger- 
trude Stein Gertrude Stein Gertrude Stein opened at State College, Penn- 
sylvania, on May 4, 1979. Its first review, on May 5, was headlined, "Ms. 
Carroll Is Ms. Stein Is a Gift." 

The play was a hit was a hit was a hit. 

Off the Great White Way. Next stop was New York, where the re- 
spected Circle Repertory Theater asked the Stein group to play in rep 
that summer. They did, and they did it well, and they were told so. Car- 
roll won the Drama Desk Award for Best Actress for 1980 and Mary El- 
lyn Devery took home the Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Produc- 
tion of a Play or Musical Off-Broadway. Later, the record album of the 
monologue was to take another laurel a Grammy from the National 
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. 

To date, Gertrude Stein Gertrude Stein Gertrude Stein has played 



fourteen months in New York and two years on the road in eighty-two 
cities in thirty-five states, and at the Jerusalem Spring Festival of 1980 in 
Israel. 

Others were involved in the initial staging of the show, but the troupe 
that took to the road with Stein numbered just four: Carroll, Devery, 
production manager Ellen Zalk, and lighting designer David Lee Crist. 

They traveled by van, these four, often with two vans and everyone 
taking turns driving in two-hour shifts. It came to pass that the first thing 
they'd look for in each theater town was a Laundromat; and the second 
was an arcade parlor. There Pat Carroll would pursue her newfound ad- 
diction, already determined not to let the youngsters hog the new world 
all to themselves. She enjoyed taking her turn among the skeptical young 
experts, only to see their eyes widen and grow friendly as they saw her 
skill. 

But the quarters the machines were eating "would have paid off the 
national debt," says Devery. So they bought an Atari video cartridge sys- 
tem — a game machine. It doesn't take superior vision to recognize that 
the VCSs don't measure up to the 
real arcades. But the Apple comes 
close, and that, thanks to Ted Sher- 
man, was where the Gertrude Stein 
Gertrude Stein Gertrude Stein fam- 
ily looked next. 

Say Good-Bye to the Sun. Dur- 
ing breaks between engagements, the 
Stein company takes up residence 
at a small farm near Kingston, 
New York, in the countryside 
Washington Irving made famous. 
Then the barn and the carriage 
house become the office and, de- 
spite its dissimilarity to Paris, the 
Gertrude Stein company salon. 

Ted Sherman takes care of the audio and visual aids needs of the 
Poughkeepsie school system. On the side, he's passionate about 
computers. 

So it occurred that Carroll and friends called on Sherman for advice 
about getting a computer. 




Papa Geppetto, sometimes known 
as Ted Sherman, is the Father of 
Modern Day Cybernetics— as far 
as the Stein family is concerned.

SEARCHING FOR RECORDS 
CAN BE A REAL HASSLE. 






IT'S 



It always seems 
to happen at the 
wrong time. A file 
cabinet or two 

filled with records that are not 
quite in alphabetical order. In 
there somewhere is the right 
record, but there's just no way 
to find it without leafing through the whole mess. 
Sound familiar? 

With DB MASTER finding the right record takes 
about three seconds. You just call up the name, say 
"Mark Piper," or invoice number "38965," and there 
it is in front of you. No worries. No misfiling. 
No anxiety. Think what it means for a business where 
you constantly need to check product inventories or 
customer billing status. 

But what if you don't know the whole name or the 
exact number you're after? No problem. DB 
MASTER'S "Search" method makes it simple to find 
what you're after. For example, you can call up all the 
"Pipers" and stop when you recognize the right one. 
And there's more. You don't even have to know the 
name at all. If all you really know is that it begins 
with a "P", for instance, you can use DB MASTER'S 
"Wild Card" feature. It'll give you every name in your 
file that begins with "P". The same goes for a range 
of numbers. Punch in the range of digits you know, 
and you'll get a series to choose from. Try that with 
your filing-cabinet system. 

We designed DB MASTER to make your life easier.

"Oh, shoot!" A lone Pat Carroll takes on the forty-eight opponents in 
Crossfire. Sneakers is another favorite, and Castle Wolfenstein, and 
Olympic Decathlon, and. . . . 

Sherman insisted they investigate his own Apple. There, on the farm, 
he'd explain things about computers, and as soon as he saw a fidget, a 
wandering eye, a hint of confusion, he'd stop and say, "Play games." 
And they would. "Like kids together in a playpen," says Carroll. And as 
they played and forgot the medium, they grew familiar, and comforta- 
ble, and ready to learn more. Whence came Carroll's confidence: "I'm 
not beyond the pale," she realized; "I can learn about computers." 

"It's playing games that's the way in," Carroll says now. "Teddy 
took our hands and led us into the maze. 

"Learning from Teddy, the four of us had our progress customized, 
like having clothes fitted to us." 

Sherman's method caused no fear, no compunction. "No matter 
how stupid a question we ask, he always says sincerely, 'Good question!' 
and treats it that way." 

When he'd passed to them his passion and had set them up with the 
complete Apple system they'd need, Sherman said, "Say good-bye to the 
sun." 

And Carroll and Devery took the computer home and pulled the 
drapes to get rid of the glare and watched a brilliant new sun rise on an 
Apple monitor. 

Work Is Less Work Is Play. Mary Ellyn Devery uses the Apple to 
keep all the accounts for the Gertmde Stein company. She's using Disk- 
O-Check and Home Accountant, and likes them, but neither is precisely 
what she's after. A single-entry system that uses at least three-letter codes 
and can handle credit cards and petty cash would be ideal; a simple jour- 
nal and ledger combined. 

The Apple also keeps tabs on Devery's extensive Stein collection of 
rare books and memorabilia, gathered during preparation for the show. 

Ellen Zalk uses Screen Writer and Apple Writer to serve the group's 
word processing needs. "We keep the bios of all the company people on 
Screen Writer" Devery says, "so we never have a bunch printed up, only 
to have them outdated before half are used." If a member of the compa- 
ny needs to send out a bio, she can update the Screen Writer file and 
print out a single up-to-the-minute document. Zalk produces contracts 
for theaters on a fourteen-page contract model on Screen Writer. The 
contract can be customized easily for each individual theater and 
situation. 

Doing the theater circuit — those eighty-two cities in two years — loses 
its uncertainty. On DB Master, Zalk records all sorts of pertinent facts 
about each theater — the size and layout of the house, notes on quality, 
names of theater crew members, even the locations of bathrooms and 
notes on where to stay and eat in town. 

David Lee Crist stores on the Apple the entire lighting schemes for all 



the theaters the company plays. His system serves on two levels. Prior to 
arriving in a town, Crist prints out an instrument schedule and hookup 
information to send, along with a light plot graph, to the next theater; so, 
much of the preparation can be done ahead by the resident theater crew. 
Then, when the company arrives at the theater, if the theater has an Ap- 
ple-compatible computer running its lighting system, Crist merely runs a 
disk through the theater computer; voila, all the light cues are set. At the- 
aters in which lighting arrangements involve other computers, setting the 
cues takes seven hours. Crist is working on designing an interface be- 
tween the Apple and the various lighting system computers. 
And then there's Pat Carroll. 

Not yet does the Apple feed her her cue lines when she's studying a 
role. Not yet does her Apple serve when she's making notes or working 
on a new project or her planned book. Not yet has her Apple learned to 
respond appropriately with feedback to her reading of a new play (al- 
though it does very well at attentively listening). All in good time. 

Just now, for Carroll, her Apple is her excitement, her fun, her com- 
panion, and, most important, her link with the new age, the age of com- 
puters of which she is so determined to be a part. 

Just now, her Apple is Sneakers and Castle Wolfenstein and Olympic 
Decathlon. 

And she loves it passionately. 

Chances are, Gertrude Stein would have loved it too. 

The Future x 3. Between evenings as Gertrude Stein and bouts with 
her Apple, Pat Carroll is mulling and inventing and forming her next 
venture. 

"I'd like to develop four character studies, four one-person plays, to 
perform in repertory. Audiences would be able to return four times dur- 
ing a run and see four different shows" — each starring Carroll and each 
with its own unique identity. 

The magnitude of that ambition is outshone only by the probability 
that this warm, outgoing, caring woman of rich humor and deep thought 
will indeed achieve it. And she will. 

And when she does, there's no question that by her side will be her 
Apple be her Apple be her Apple. 

Producer Mary Ellyn Devery may talk about accounting systems, but she's 
no slouch at games either. Here, she takes a concentrated approach to Bolo.

Fruitful Connections* 



There are more people in more 
places making more accessories 
and peripherals for Apples than 
for any other personal computer 
in the world. 

Thanks to those people — 
in hundreds of independent 
companies— you can make the 
humblest 1978 Apple II turn tricks 
that are still on IBM's Wish List 
for 1984. 

But now we're coming out with 
our very own line of peripherals 
and accessories for Apple® Personal 
Computers. 

For two very good reasons. 

First, compatibility. We've 
created a totally kluge-free family 
of products designed to take full 
advantage of all the advantages 
built into every Apple. 

Second, service and support. 




Now the same kindly dealer who 
keeps your Apple PC in the pink 
can do the same competent job 
for your Apple hard-disk and your 
Apple daisywheel printer. 

So if you're looking to expand 
the capabilities of your Apple II 
or III, remember: 

Now you can add Apples to 
Apples. 



Gutenberg would be proud. 

Old Faithful Silentype® has now been joined by New Faithfuls, the 
Apple Dot Matrix Printer and the Apple Letter Quality Printer. 

^ y So now, whatever your budget and your 

needs, you can hook your Apple to a printer 
that's specifically designed to take advan- 
tage of all the features built into your 
Apple. With no compromises. 

The 7x9 Apple Dot Matrix 
Printer is redefining "correspondence 
quality" with exceptional legibility. 
With 144x160 dots per square inch, it can 
also create high resolution graphics. 

The Apple Letter Quality Printer, 
which gets die words out about 33% 
Ujgjjff faster than other daisywheel printers 
in its price range, also offers graphics 
capabilities. See your authorized 
Apple dealer for more information and 
demonstrations. Because, unfortunately, all 
the news fit to print simply doesn't fit. 




A joy to behold 

The new Apple Joystick II is 
the ultimate hand control device 
for the Apple II. 

Why is it such a joy to use? 

With two firing buttons, it's 
the first ambidextrous joystick — 
just as comfortable for lefties 
as righties. 

Of course, it gives you 360° 
cursor control (not just 8-way like 
some game-oriented devices) and 
full X/Y coordinate control. 

And the Joystick II contains 
high-quality components and 
switches tested to over 1,000,000 
life cycles. 

Which makes it a thing of 
beauty. And a joystick forever.

A storehouse of knowledge* 



If you work with so much data 
or so many programs that you find 
yourself shuffling diskettes con- 
stantly, you should take a look at 
Apple's ProFile™ the personal 
mass storage system for 
the Apple III Personal 
Computer. 

This Winchester-based 
5-megabyte hard disk 
can handle as much data 
as 35 floppies. Even more 
important for some, it 
can access that data 
about 10-times faster 
than a standard floppy 
drive. 

So now your Apple 
III can handle jobs once 
reserved for computers 
costing thousands 
more. 

As for quality 



and reliability, you need only store 
one word of wisdom: 
Apple. 




Launching pad for numeric data. 



i 



Good tidings for crunchers of 
numerous numbers: 

Apple now offers a numeric 
keypad that's electronically and 
aesthetically compatible 
with the Apple II 
Personal Computer. 
So you can enter 
numeric data f 
faster than 
ever before. 

The Apple 
Numeric Key- 
pad II has 
a standard 
calculator- 
style layout. 
Appropriate, 




because unlike some other key- 
pads, it can actually function as a 
calculator 

The four function keys to the 
left of the numeric pad should be 
of special interest 
to people who use 
VisiCalc? Because 
they let you zip 
around your 
work sheet more 
easily than ever, 
adding and 
deleting entries.

Suspended. By Michael Berlyn. When Infocom released Zork two years 
ago, it was evident that this new company cared about quality and its 
customers. The full parser was an innovation — freedom from putting the 
cat in the hat in two words or less, and a vocabulary that seemed to want 
to understand even when it didn't. 

On top of the technical excellence, the adventure story was entertain- 
ing and its puzzles logical and intelligent. 

As new Infocom products arrived, they merely cemented these im- 
pressions. Innovation and excellence are a way of life for the folks at In- 
focom. A breakthrough is something they must make approximately 
once a week. 

Meanwhile, high in the mountains of Colorado, a science-fiction 
writer was not plying his trade. He'd fallen in love with the Apple he'd 
bought to write his books on and had taken to writing computer adven- 
tures instead, under the banner of Sentient Software. But Berlyn couldn't 
stop plotting. The clever, rounded plots that make good fiction kept 
creeping into his adventures, bringing them critical acclaim despite their 
limited parser (cleverly done) and Berlyn 's beginning programming 
status. Oo Topos was a promise that Cyborg began to fulfill. 

Like the people at Infocom, Berlyn drove himself for the best he 
could produce; he would push beyond his capacity. 

Wouldn't it be wonderful, adventurers might muse, if Infocom and 
Mike Berlyn could get together? It would, and they did, and it is. 

The first product of Mike Berlyn at Infocom, working with Info- 
com's specially developed tools and methods and the input of the com- 
pany's designers, Marc Blank and Dave Lebling, is exactly what you 
might expect in your wildest dreams: a highly intelligent, intricately plot- 
ted, totally playable, challenging and satisfying adventure, and, of 
course, a breakthrough. 

Suspended takes place on a computer-controlled planet; the failsafe, 
in case of computer malfunction, is human — that is the role the player 
assumes; and, as you begin, the computer has just malfunctioned. 

Awakened just enough from a cryogenic sleep to think clearly, but 
still in a vulnerably suspended state physically, you must direct the ac- 
tions of (here's this week's breakthrough) six unique robots to manipu- 
late the controls that maintain the planet manually and to ferret out the 
causes of the malfunction and correct them. 

Each of the six robots is individual, with strengths and weaknesses. 
Auda can hear; she cannot see. Iris can see, but she is confined to a small 
section of the control center. Sensa can detect physical waves and emis- 
sions, but she cannot manipulate things well. Waldo can manipulate just 
about anything, but he cannot always figure things out. Whiz is terrific 
when he's getting information from the central computer, but he's little 
more than an errand runner away from his plug. And Poet, well, Poet's 
makers missed the boat in debugging; he does his job well — he under- 
stands much through touch — but he speaks in poems and riddles. 

There's a good argument that the robots are essentially personifica- 
tions of human senses; if that fascinates you, consider it now. Once you 
begin playing Suspended, you are apt to be so charmed by the individual 
personalities of the six robots that you won't want to think of them as 
symbolic of anything. They are themselves, varied and colorful and 
friendly. 

The robots are independent of each other. You can send several to 
various places and have others do other things while the first are on their 



way. In fact, to win the game, you'll have to find efficient ways to keep all 
the robots working simultaneously. Infocom provides a full-color lami- 
nated map with stick-on symbols of the six robots to help you keep track 
of who's where. 

The object of Suspended is to repair the malfunctioning parts of the 
control center with the least possible fatalities planetside. At first, it 
seems impossible to finish the job at all before angry humans from the 
planet storm the control center to replace you for a job poorly done. But 
once you've solved all the puzzles, the temptation to go back and do it all 
more efficiently is strong. Can you do it with no fatalities? 

Berlyn has succeeded in devising an adventure that is so absorbing, 
so compelling in the pleasure of the achieving, that you can replay it 
again and again. 

Recognizing this, Berlyn included three extra modes of play, ad- 
vanced, configure, and impossible. Advanced starts you off later in the 
game with one robot out of commission. Configure lets you choose your 
own parameters — how many robots are functional, how soon angry hu- 
mans come in from the planet. Impossible — well, impossible's a joke. 

As usual with Infocom games, the vocabulary is even more extensive 
than the last Infocom game. If you are using your mind, Suspended will 
probably understand you. If there's an approximate common word for a 
concept and a precise uncommon word, try the precise one. That's the 
way the minds at Infocom work, too. It's a pleasure.

Senior Analyst. By Business Solutions. Senior Analyst is Apple's try at a 
Kw/Ca/c-styled electronic spreadsheet. Basically, the program, which re- 
quires 64K, handles the everyday fundamental spreadsheet work, the 
what-if modeling. However, in place of the typical spreadsheet cells des- 
ignated by coordinates, Senior Analyst uses what it calls "tags." Each tag 
may be four characters, and thus can be a mnemonic, such as sis or wage. 
These tags are put into "definitions." VisiCalc and some other spread- 
sheet programs don't protect formulas. This lack of protection can undo 
a great deal of work if a formula is inadvertently changed. The longer 
and more complex the model, the greater the chance of an accidental 
change. If a number of people are entering data for a report, the chances 
for error increase as well. Senior Analyst protects against changing any- 
thing in the model but a value. 

One odd shortcoming of the program, however, is that you can save 
only nine pages of figures per disk. A page can be up to 50 rows and 16 
columns of values. This compares to 254 rows and 63 values available 
with VisiCalc. However, Senior Analyst gets around this deficiency by 
making it easy to link pages together, even when they are on many dif- 
ferent disks. As a result, a model may be as large as required, and people 
in other departments or at other locations can make their own models. 
Later, they may transfer those models into one or more larger models. 

Several special functions are supported. These functions allow the al- 
location of values, the creation of linear regression forecasts, and the il- 
lustration of various types of depreciation and growth. 

The most special printing function is the spooling option. Spooling 
lets the computer hold up to 10,000 characters on the side, waiting to be 
printed, while you continue using the program. Senior Analyst will even 
reprint all spooled reports.

Its most serious weakness is its inability to transfer data to a word 
processor, a graphics package, or through a modem to a distant site. Ma- 
jor corporations frequently need to modem their financial data around

Dark Crystal. By Roberta Williams. You read the book, you saw the 
movie, now play the computer game! Does that sound familiar — yet 
strange? The movie was the much-heralded Christmastime release, Dark 
Crystal; the game is Roberta Williams's computer adventure version of 
the movie. 

The direct conversion from movie to game is a first and, thanks to 
Williams's bright imagination and delight in puzzling, it works. In fact, 
Dark Crystal is actually better as a computer adventure than as a movie. 

The world of the Dark Crystal was created by Jim Henson, master of 
Muppets. British illustrator Brian Froud breathed life into Henson's fan- 
tasy world. The movie marked a departure for Henson from the cute lov- 
ability of the Muppets to a foreboding world filled with strange and 
exotic creatures. 

Dark Crystal is the tale of a small elflike creature's attempt to find 
and return a missing shard to the central energy source of his world, a 
mystical dark crystal, thereby healing the crystal and restoring good and 
balance in his world. The creature, a gelfling named Jen, must figure out 
what he must do, then overcome tremendous obstacles, escape ferocious 
beasts, and outwit the evil skeksis rulers to accomplish it. He finds friend- 
ship and a partner in his quest in gelfling Kira and her puppylike pet, 
Fizzgig. Jen's mentor is the mystic UrSu; the one-eyed Aughra is the key 
to their success. 

Aughra is an immortal seer; the legend of the dark crystal is actually 
a translation of her arcane work, the Book of Aughra. All the characters 
in the movie are portrayed by Muppets. 

When Henson Associates decided to produce a computer adventure 
game based on the movie, Roberta Williams seemed the logical choice to 
create it. Williams, originator of illustrated computer adventures and 
bestselling author of several, including the gargantuan Time Zone, has 
faithfully adapted the story to the Apple. While retaining many of the ad- 
venture problems from the movie, Williams has added clever new puz- 
zles, which maintain the tempo of the originals. So, having seen the mov- 
ie doesn't mean you'll instantly solve the adventure. The game is im- 
mense, occupying four disk sides. The puzzles are basically oriented to- 
ward the intermediate level adventurer, but figuring out how to get into 
the dreaded skeksis' castle, near the end of the game, will tax even the 
most jaded, expert gamer. The outcome is uncertain until the very last 
move. Do you have the right crystal shard — or one of the many 
imitations? 

Artistic hi-res color graphics subtly capture the mood and eeriness of 
the Dark Crystal world and catapult the player into high tension adven- 
ture. Each panel was drawn, on paper, by Henson Associates's art direc- 
tor Jim Mahon and then transcribed to the Apple by Sierra On-Line via 
graphic tablets. Every aspect of the story and graphics was personally ap- 
proved by Jim Henson to ensure authenticity. 

This game represents an unprecedented accomplishment in the mi- 
crocomputer industry. It is the first time that a computer adventure game 
has been directly translated from a movie. 

The experiment works. Whether the concept can hold up for a mov- 

Beamscope II . . . again. The fourth sentence in the fifth paragraph of 

last month's review of the Beamscope II, as the reviewer wrote it, read 
"If you have a crummy little television and you buy a Beamscope, you'll 
have a crummy big television." Somewhere in the course of publishorial 
bureaucracy, someone evidently objected to the terms "little" and "big" 
and refined the line. The new, classier review implied that it was the fault 
of Beamscope and the good folks at International Marketing Services if 
the hypothetical crummy TV remained crummy when enlarged. Not so. 
A twelve-inch Trinitron looks fantastic when Beamscope turns it into a 
25-inch panoramic vista. Kudos, Beamscope. Eat dirt, staff prude.

ie that wasn't already a fantasy, peopled with fantasy characters, is not 
certain; but that next step will be more interesting to watch for after see- 
ing the success of Dark Crystal. 

The collaboration of Roberta Williams and Jim Henson paves the 
way for similar projects throughout the industry. Computer adventure 
gaming is becoming the new link in the classic merchandising chain of 
book-play-movie-games-toys. Dark Crystal represents a coming of age 
for a very young industry. RRA

Genesis. By Salem-Pritchett. Breathes there an adventurer with imagi- 
nation so dead who never to herself has said, "I'd like to write my own 
adventure!" Playing adventures whets the imagination, hones the dia- 
bolical mind, sparks the creative juices. 

But few adventure players are programmers. The road to good ad- 
ventures is paved with codeless plots, you might say. 

There is an answer, and it's to be found in Genesis. No, reading the 
Bible won't make a programmer of you, but the program Genesis: The 
Adventure Creator will do all the programming for you. 

You'll have to live with its limits, of course; and your finished adven- 
ture will resemble early Scott Adams in format. But its content can be 
whatever you want; it really will be your adventure, playable and fun for 
anyone you want to play it with. 

The publisher has opened Genesis for anyone to use, even if the user 
plans to market the finished product. That's enormously generous, but 
the fact is that the finished product won't really be retail-marketable as is. 
But, if your story and puzzles are good, it will be sufficient to market to a 
publisher who'll do the actual programming in-house. Just the way it is, 
it's fine for making adventures for family and friends. 

Genesis has a lot to recommend it. Its greatest strength is in its ability 
to help you organize your thinking and manipulate the pieces. It encour- 
ages you to develop your map, select your objects, plan your com- 
mands. It's a cinch to edit, so you can always go back and make changes 
or new connections and puzzles. 



A side effect is that you learn just how complicated an adventure is 
and how detailed your thinking about it must be. You also learn that all 
that work is even more fun than you thought. 

On the negative side, for some people, Genesis is limited in scope, but 
the imagination can take users far beyond its capacity to respond. You 
can't write Suspended or Labyrinth of Crete on Genesis, or even Dead- 
line. But after all, they are programming tours de force — no fair. More to 
the point, you're limited to ninety-nine of everything rooms, objects, flag 
messages. For the most part, that's quite a lot. But if you should get ter- 
ribly ambitious and use all ninety-nine rooms, for example, you could 
have no more than one identifiable object per room. 

Other innovations take up unexpected space. Normally, Genesis dis- 
plays on the game screen all directions possible from a room. If you want 
the player to have to discover an exit, you must enter it as a command; 
the command often involves an object and a message. The object be- 
comes one of your ninety-nine and the message counts as a flag message. 
There's no provision for synonyms either; if you want your players to be 
able to refer to a wall hanging as either a picture or a painting, you'll 
have to enter both picture and painting as separate objects — one for the 
price of two. 

Still, so long as you keep your adventures to a reasonable size and 
complexity, you can do plenty with Genesis without knowing one single 
word about programming. And, if you're just beginning to toy with ad- 
venture making, Genesis is invaluable for putting you on the right track 
in your thinking and organization. f1(T

Crime Wave. By Scott Schramm. There's something very, very wrong 
with this game. The graphics are smooth, the colors are bright, the sound 
is subtle, and the action is mostly nonviolent (the only time you use vio- 
lence is in self-defense). The plot is even respectable: you're a police offi- 
cer on your city beat, and your job is to round up criminals after they've 
robbed banks.

So, there you have it. A playful way to simulate the preservation of 
American justice, all in 48K. Anyone who sees something wrong in that 
probably also sees Superman as a self-righteous vigilante and a showoff. 

Well, there isn't anything wrong with the idea behind the game; rath- 
er, it's in the way you feel while you're playing it and for a considerable 
time afterward. The game is addicting because after you're done kicking 
yourself for letting the bad guys get you, you'll want revenge. Bad. 

What you see on the screen is a bird's-eye view of the city and the 
bank robbers' hideout to the side. When the alarm sounds, you must get 
to the scene of the crime within seconds if you are to capture the robber 
before he makes it to his getaway car. If he manages to get to the car, it's 
a downtown chase with you in hot pursuit. 

The hideout is where they stash the cash, and once there, robbers 
equip themselves with ramrodders that make them vulnerable only to 
bombs, of which you can carry just one at a time (use it wisely). If you 
can catch the gunsels before they reach the hideout, just tow 'em to the 
station and get back on your beat. 

After the successful booking of several robbers, the next crime wave 
hits, only with more robbers and no reinforcements to help you. Seems 
that all your fellow officers are hanging out at the doughnut shops. 

Gee, what a nice game. What could possibly be wrong with it? 
What's wrong is that after successfully jailing ten or fifteen or thirty rob- 
bers, you're still angry! Angry at your patrol car for not turning the 
wrong way down a one-way street (no one is above the law); angry at it 
for not turning the right way when you could swear you hit the right key; 
angry because their cars go through each other and they destroy yours. 

What's wrong is that the game is smart. Escaping crooks know which 
way you turned or will turn. At least it seems that way. Penguin can pat 
itself on the back for releasing the first game that shows a corollary of 
Murphy's Law in action: "Whichever way you think they'll go, they'll go 
the other way." 

Don't even think about playing just a few rounds of Crime Wave and 
then leaving the game satisfied. If steam comes out of your ears and 
you're muttering, "Grrr!" then you're perfectly normal. If you're doing 



neither of these things, you're either stubborn or a very, very patient 
player. 

Games are supposed to be fun, aren't they? If you're not having fun, 
it has to be the game's fault. Yeah, that's it; the game's fault. 

Right. Rationalize, rationalize. f|TV

Serpent's Star. By Michael Ormsby, Larry Franks, Christopher P. An- 
son, Kristin Pearson-Franks, and Alan B. Clark. What does an intrepid 
explorer do for relaxation after battling an ancient Aztec sun god in the 
jungle of Mexico? He goes to Tibet to frolic in the snow! While there, he 
might as well search the Himalayas for the fabled Serpent's Star, no 
doubt to defray expenses. 

Continuing the saga of its bestselling first release, Mask of the Sun, 
Ultrasoft is presenting Serpent's Star. At the end of Mask of the Sun, our 
hero, Mac Steele, had recovered the rare Lhasa scrolls of Tibet. Careful 
deciphering of the scrolls yielded a strange legend of an eternal city, 
Kara-Koram. That city exists mostly out of our time, making only occa- 
sional appearances. The scrolls also told of an enormous blue-star sap- 
phire, called the Serpent's Star because it was supposed to belong to a 
dragon god. Usually, you openly scoff at such superstitions, but with the 
Aztec sun god coming to life and almost devouring you, perhaps a little 
tolerance of strange customs is in order. 

Searching for a legendary city that appears only for one day each 
year is a difficult undertaking. Not having the luxury of a plane crash on 
the doorstep of Shangri-La, as had Ronald Coleman in Lost Horizon, the 
player must search the Himalayas. In your possession are ten of the thir- 
teen Lhasa scrolls. Finding the other three will take the adventurer 
through the first two-thirds of the game. Talk to everyone encountered. 
Important clues and aid can be found through acts of generosity. 

The teaching of the Buddha figures prominently in the solution of 
this game. The path to enlightenment requires humbleness, generosity, 
and introspection. 

Mask of the Sun required no a priori knowledge of the Aztec religion

It's almost three in the morning. 
You knew just one more line of code 
and your program would be finished. 
That was seven hours ago. It's hard 
work developing good software. Writing 
it on the Apple II is no exception. 
Although we can't promise to get you 
to bed by eleven o'clock, we can make 
your job a lot easier. 

When we developed MetaCard, a 
co-processor system for the Apple II, we 
designed in 128K bytes of on-board 
memory with parity. Enough memory to 
run the most powerful development tools 
available. We included memory expansion 
capabilities beyond 128K. 

And we made sure it could run all three 
operating systems for the IBM PC. MetaCard 
does more than make your job easier, it opens 
up new development areas. If you want to create 
or run more powerful applications software for 
the Apple, or for the IBM PC or other 
8086/88-based systems, you should have a 
MetaCard in your Apple. MetaCard supports the 
most popular development languages available 
for MS-DOS, CP/M-86 and UCSD p-System 
Version IV. Languages like Pascal, C, COBOL, 




FORTRAN, BASIC and almost all others operate 
at peak performance. MetaCard enables you to 
continue to use most of the popular peripherals 
for your Apple II, plus all of your existing 
software. And with many best selling 
applications for the IBM PC available soon, you 
can use your Apple in new and developing areas. 

MetaCard uses the Intel 8088 processor and 
operates at a full 5 Mhz. And MetaCard's 
real-time clock, external power supply, parity 
checking RAM, and power-up ROM diagnostics 
give you the features and reliability you demand. 



Satisfaction Guaranteed 

We know you'll still work through the night. 
But if MetaCard doesn't improve your 
working conditions, return it within 
30 days, and we'll send your money 
back. No questions asked. 
MetaCard, complete with 
W documentation, MS-DOS and UCSD 
m p-System (CP/M-86 optional) and power

or mythos for the game to be solved. The adventurer was not required to 
sacrifice virgins at the Well of Chichen-Itza or to know that the name of 
the Aztec love god was Checan. In Serpent's Star, however, familiarity 
with the basic Buddhist traditions is more than just helpful, it's neces- 
sary. Two difficult riddles, based on those traditions, must be solved be- 
fore the adventurer can advance. Failure to solve either riddle can get the 
player fried or lost in oblivion. 

While Serpent's Star breaks no new ground, the gaming aspect has 
improved. The adventure is more complex than Mask of the Sun, and its 
traps less obvious. Unfortunately, the high level of graphics that 
characterized the first game is not so prevalent in Serpent's Star. The illus- 
trating of people, especially, seems to have suffered. The outdoor scenes 
don't have the richness of the previous game — partly because snow is 
simply less colorful than tropical foliage. Yet, some of the interior scenes 
are among the best that Ultrasoft has ever created. Ultrasoft's main 
claims to fame, the animated scenes and travel sequences, highlight this 
game. A levitating meditating monk is a real delight, as are the manifes- 
tations of the fabled city of Kara-Koram. The traveler sways from side to 
side like a drunken sailor. So much so that on a swaying bridge the two 
motions cancel each other out and the traveler appears to be standing 
still. A quick-travel option has been included to speed up the game for 
those not interested in the scenic tour. 

This game also has two segments, a springing wolf and an ava- 
lanche, where the adventurer is required to have quick reflexes to go on. 
Even the mystical Yeti make an appearance. 

While Serpent's Star is more of a sequel to Mask of the Sun than a 



new adventure concept, it still represents a sophisticated style of gaming 
that's entirely Ultrasoft's own. The two-sided disk will treat you to a 
glimpse of a faraway mystical land where feats of the occult are com- 
monplace. RRA

Flip Out. By Scott Huskey. Its reputation as an arcade game company 
notwithstanding, Sirius Software occasionally manages to come out with 
a good, solid thinking game. This time it's tried something a little further 
off the beaten track and has come up with a dandy: Flip Out. 

The simplicity of the game may be its strongest point. For one or two 
players, it consists of nine different layouts of gates through which 
players must drop their or their opponents' marbles. There are two types 
of gates: one catches marbles, holding them, and the other switches mar- 
bles over to an adjoining track. The bottom ends of both types of gates 
allow marbles to pass by freely. These gates are set up in vertical pas- 
sageways through which the player drops a marble. The marble either 
passes through to the bottom of the layout or stops at one of the catching 
gates. Each time a marble passes through a gate, it flips it so that the op- 
posite end (either catching or switching) moves into place for the next 
marble coming through. 

The object of the game is twofold. Of primary importance is getting 
all of your marbles through the gates. But trapping an opponent's mar- 
bles in the layout is important, too. The game continues until one player 
has gotten all of his marbles through the layout.

The computer is not a very tough opponent in the one-player ver- 
sion of Flip Out. In fact, the only way to play a really challenging one- 
player game is to see how quickly one can win by holding the computer 
to the fewest possible marbles through the series of gates. The computer 
tends to drop its marbles right where the human last placed hers and thus 
is easily beaten with a little foresight and calculation. 

As a two-player game, however, Flip Out really shines. Evenly 
matched players often (but not always, by any stretch of the imagina- 
tion) end up in a tie. Each player has to estimate correctly all the pos- 
sible paths a marble can take through the gates and then pick the best 
option. With as many as half a dozen or more marbles from both players 
trapped in the network of gates, this can be a tricky proposition. Gen- 
erally the player who makes the fewest miscalculations wins. Every game 
seems different; for a while each of the nine layouts stays basically the 
same. The gates are set randomly each time you play, making for an end- 
less variety of starting situations. 

The real beauty of Flip Out is the fact that it is so utterly simple that 
people of virtually any age can comprehend the game and play it in little 
or no time. It is a leisurely game, much like chess or checkers, in which

Shadow Vet. By Brian Scott and Gary Goodman. There's a certain in- 
toxicating feeling that even the most jaded machine fanatic experiences 
when encountering such a truly novel system as the Shadow Vet. Vet 
stands for voice-entry terminal. Its name, Shadow, characterizes the way 
it's run. As a background peripheral to the Apple keyboard, the Shadow 
Vet simultaneously allows either spoken or keyed-in commands. Almost 
imperceptible flickers and pauses may be heard as the process unveils its 



wonders, making it appear as if the program is really thinking about 
what it is doing. Almost immediately, Shadow Vet reveals itself to be a 
very smart, very cleverly put-together system. The Shadow Vet is an 
Apple-sized harbinger of the forthcoming fifth-generation, artificially 
intelligent computer. 

Shadow Vefs creators set out to design a system that would be as per- 
fect a replica of the human ear as they could realize. Combining Scott's 
expertise in speech recognition and Goodman's in artificial intelligence, 
they came up with this system. The Shadow Vet is impressive in its ability 
to mimic the workings of one of the brain's most important peripherals. 
Although the system was designed for general use it should be of partic- 
ular benefit to those handicapped people for whom it can provide total 
access to the Apple. 

Shadow Vet is extremely easy to learn and use, even for beginners and 
nontechnical users. It is completely menu-driven, well prompted and as- 
sisted. Command vocabularies may be set for any standard program or 
operating system and for any combination of display formats (text with 
or without graphics, forty or eighty-column screen widths). CP/M pro- 
grams do require the addition of a command file to the CP/M disk, but 
this step is well explained. 

Installation is fairly well documented, though a little tricky, because it 
requires inserting a board that fits nicely in even the most "fully loaded" 
Apples. Two chips from the Apple motherboard (three, if you have a lan- 
guage card) have to be pulled and several connecting ribbon cables in- 
stalled. The necessary surgery was performed with great ease. In addition 
to the board, the hardware includes a flat box containing the speech pre- 
processing circuitry, which may sit on top of the disk drive. A comfort- 
able headset, which supports the microphone and leaves one's hands 
free, is also included. 

The disk provided must be booted to use the Shadow Vet because it 
loads the Shadow Vet's own Monitor, called SVS, into its on-board cache 
memory. At this point, the disk may be removed and any other DOS

booted. The Shadow Vet requires virtually no extra memory or drive 
space. Vocabulary files may be stored anywhere and easily loaded at any 
point in any standard program. This is accomplished by invoking the 
SVS Monitor and asking it to do so (in a nice tone of voice, of course!). 
Once vocabularies are created, the files may live on the same disks with 
unprotected programs. They may be loaded automatically with the hello 
program. Though vocabularies are limited to forty words, or command 
strings, each file uses only 4K of disk memory. Quite a few of these files 
may be scattered around on program and working disks. Because the 
Shadow Vet is completely transparent to the Apple, it may also be used 
with protected software. 

The text of the 'Teaching Your Computer To Listen" section in the 
manual is one of the most delightful pieces of computer-related prose. To 
wit: "Talking to a machine will likely be a new experience and you may 
feel a bit awkward at first. Relax — with a little practice, it will come nat- 
urally." For those of us who've been talking to our earless machines for 
years, at times cajoling or downright obsequious, at other times venge- 
fully sputtering obscenities while kicking and beating them to death, a 
little behavior modification will be necessary: "Should mistakes occur, 
do not raise your voice in frustration; marked change in volume will 
impair recognition." 

Even forewarned and forearmed, this may not always be as easy as 
might be expected. This is definitely one of the times in your computer 
life when you will find the difficulties encountered more interesting than 
the easy victories. The idea is to repeat the words a few times so that the 
system can create a unique template for each word. The process is fas- 
cinating to watch and works surprisingly well for most words. For the 
neophyte, or the user interested only in results, there's an easy fix. Try a 
few different enunciations, follow the directions in the manual (don't talk 
too slowly/quickly, softly/loudly, and don't get emotional!). If all else 
fails, use another, more easily trained word to represent the prob- 
lem word. 



This latter tactic, of course, presents the adventurous user with yet 
another wealth of possibilities: why not substitute your own vocabulary 
for all those boring commands? A user who hadn't seen you set it up 
would never figure out that you get a catalog by authoritatively saying 
"piggy." Or scroll the screen by following up with "ducky," and proceed 
to display the drive 2 catalog with a triumphant cry (careful, don't get 
too emotional . . .) of "horsie!" All of the above, including rapping your 
knuckles on the table or clicking or hissing, were fun alternatives to 
explore. As children enjoy experimenting with the Shadow Vet, its po- 
tential for educational use will be of significant interest. 

The programmer's reference section contains a wealth of informa- 
tion for the more technical user. The information includes the utilities 
available for changing the system's parameters. Wonderful sounding 
things, such as noise, silence, vocalic, and acceptance thresholds, are 
listed. Writing custom software using the Shadow Vet routines is tanta- 
lizingly possible but is the least complete section of the documentation. 

Technically ingenious, user-friendly, wonderful fun, the Shadow Vet 
has significantly more potential than its current capabilities might sug- 
gest. It inevitably educates, by raising questions about the mechanisms of 
perception and the role perception plays in intelligence. C(

VIM. By Ron Runge. The sight of someone talking to a computer isn't 
too startling. When you work closely with one of these seemingly smart 
machines, it can seem to have a personality of its own. So if, perchance, 
you overhear a friend having words with his Apple, you are likely to think 
little of it. A sight that's sure to make you do a double-take, however, is 
that of someone talking to his Apple, and the Apple responding. 

There are all kinds of misconceptions people have about computer 
voice input. Some might picture a computer you can talk to the way you 
talk to people, but this kind of sophistication just doesn't exist yet. On 
the other hand, you might expect that a voice input device for the Apple

would be totally incompatible with existing software, that it would re- 
quire a whole new body of very specialized — and probably expensive — 
applications. Nothing could be further from the truth. 

The VIM, or Voice Input Module, lets you teach your Apple a 
vocabulary of up to eighty words for use with any Apple program. Each 
word has a visual component, the word the computer prompts you with; 
a verbal component, the sound you make when you say the word; and a 
definition, a set of characters the VIM sends to the keyboard when you 
say the word. The Apple interprets the characters the VIM sends as if 
they had really been entered from the keyboard. The VIM physically 
intercepts the keyboard input, but you can still type at the keyboard; the 
VIM only blocks keyboard input when it is translating one of your utter- 
ances to the Apple. 

The VIM comes with a utility called AVIM, which accomplishes all 
the tasks of training the module to recognize your voice. All the various 
training functions — entering and editing vocabulary and key definitions, 
training the VIM to recognize each word as you speak it, loading and 
saving vocabulary and voice patterns, and activating recognition — are 
selected through a series of menus. 

Vocabularies are designed with specific applications in mind. With 
most serious applications, you should think out beforehand which func- 
tions are easy to do from the keyboard and which best lend themselves to 
voice command. Think of each command you train as a kind of vocal 
macro. Frequently used commands requiring complicated key se- 
quences and commands you want to give the computer while looking for 
something else are best suited to voice input. 

The words chosen for the spoken commands should be selected with 
the idea of making them easily distinguishable. For instance, you prob- 
ably wouldn't want to use "correction" and "direction" in the same 
vocabulary. Instead, you could change one of them to some synonym 
that wouldn't cause confusion. 

In training, AVIM prompts you one word at a time, making at least 
three passes through the list. If you say something differently the second 
or third time through, it prompts you to repeat it to make sure it has a 
good sample of the average way you say the word. If you said it wrong 
the first time, the program will prompt you several times on the next pass 
until it is sure enough about the way you meant to say it that it can throw 
out the original sample. When you're finished training, AVIM turns the 
VIM on and drops you into Basic, where you can load or boot the pro- 
gram you wish to control by voice. 

The AVIM program also contains options to test the trained vocabu- 
lary for separability — which makes sure that no two words sound too 
much alike — to test for proper recognition and to retain difficult words. 

Of course, voice recognition technology has yet to reach its logical 
conclusion. It has the potential, ultimately, to revolutionize the office, the 
factory, even the home. A machine that takes dictation, still within the 
realm of science fiction today, is not impossibly far off. Pt)

Germany 1985. By Roger Keating. The date is the summer of 1985, and 
the Soviet Union launches a massive strike into central Germany. The 
Red Army is on the march and only the NATO forces under your com- 
mand can stop them — maybe. 

During the height of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, President John 
F. Kennedy and his brother Robert found themselves discussing the 
chances of war in the White House kitchen late one evening. Dave 
Powers, a longtime friend from Boston, was also there enjoying a hasty 
meal. The president remarked to his brother, "The way Dave is eating 
my food you'd think it was his last meal." Dave Powers looked up, 
thought a moment, and answered, "The way you and Bobby are talk- 
ing, maybe it is!" After a few hours with Germany 1985, you will under- 
stand Dave Powers's point of view. 

Germany 1985 uses an advanced version of the innovative game sys- 
tem first developed for SSI's Southern Command, the 1973 Sinai Cam- 
paign. Germany 1985 is the first in a projected series of contemporary war 
games depicting different conceivable U.S. and Soviet conflicts on a 
global scale.

Documentation is thorough. A battalion-level simulation of two pos- 
sible scenarios of "conventional" battle between NATO and Soviet 
forces in central Germany is included. An innovative feature in SSI's 
documentation is that a "Sample Turn" is outlined in the manual to fa- 
miliarize the player with the game's command system. To assist in learn- 
ing the game system, the novice player may watch the computer play a 
"demonstration game" against itself. The battlefield is a hi-res hexagonal grid 
representing one mile per hex. Terrain is varied, including for- 
est, rivers, swamps, cities, and towns. Victory is determined by the num- 
ber of occupied cities and towns controlled by the player's forces at the 
conclusion of the game. 

A terrific new feature is an optional computer-assisted automatic 
movement and fire control. This feature enables the player to direct the 
strategic flow of the game without the tedium of managing every detail of 
game play. 

Solitaire play is available, with the computer playing either the 
NATO or Soviet forces. Three levels of difficulty may be selected to ac- 
commodate novice or experienced war gamers. In addition, the player 
may select open or hidden movement, with enemy units only becoming 
visible when sighted by friendly forces. 

Germany 1985's brigade level simulation is as contemporary as to- 
day's headlines and represents the full range of modern arms. Two new 
and exciting elements have been added with the introduction of divi- 
sional integrity and variable movement. Divisional integrity represents 
the tendency of a military unit's effectiveness to decrease with the unit's 
distance from headquarters. This is a vital concept in modern tactical 
warfare. Variable movement introduces the concept that when sighted by 
enemy forces the movement of friendly units tends to "slow down." Tra- 
ditional elements of variable terrain, morale, fatigue, and restricted 
movement have been included. Even the use of smoke screens to screen 
attack or retreat is employed. 

Germany 1985 uses one of the best graphic-display systems yet by 
SSI. The entire hexagonal display may be scrolled using the cursor to 
show all portions of the battlefield. To provide a single overall strategic 
view, an aggregated, hi-res color map may be toggled on or off. The 



quality of the terrain and unit counter graphics is first-rate. Troop unit 
types are clear, easily identifiable, and remain that way even with black- 
and-white displays. A considerable achievement. 

The computer in solitaire mode plays a capable game. It capitalizes 
on obvious mistakes and presents some apparent tactical insight. Only in 
the end game does the computer lack finesse and fail to "see" a simple 
conclusion. 

Germany 1985 is an intermediate level simulation, requiring three to 
four hours' playing time. Well-designed and executed, it's an excellent 
first entry in the "When Superpowers Collide" series. WHH

Voice Box. "Wake up, Susan, it's time to go to work," the tiny speaker 
beside her bed announces. The monotone voice continues, "It is now 
seven fifteen; your coffee is waiting for you." 

Speech synthesizers for microcomputers have been around for some 
time, and though they have found great acceptance by those with speak- 
ing difficulties or other communications handicaps, they can also be 
downright fun to play with! The latest generation is not only relatively 
inexpensive, but, with the addition of a "text-to-speech" converter, ex- 
tremely easy to use. 

The Voice Box is no exception, and with the text algorithm on a 
ROM instead of a disk, there is no longer a need to boot before it can be 
used. It may be plugged into any Apple slot, and will be ready to go with 
a simple "PR# " command. Any print statements that follow will be con- 
verted into the appropriate spoken words, though with the rules of Eng- 
lish being what they are, don't be surprised at occasional mispro- 
nunciations. Of course, this is easily circumvented by spelling those 
words phonetically, which in time will become second nature. 

The Voice Box isn't limited to a fixed spoken pitch; nor does it require 
setting an on-board trimmer. Its pitch and pacing are under independent 
software control. If desired, either may be changed for each word or part 
of a word, lending a much greater feeling of realism. Recent experiments 
have shown, however, that cats and dogs are smarter than we think, since 
they won't be fooled for more than about a second. Although, with

enough patience, it is possible to generate an almost natural inflection. In 
fact, one of the product's featured selling points is its singing capability, 
though certain notes seem to suffer from a disturbing "gargling" quality. 

The speaker has a two-position volume switch, eliminating the in- 
convenience of removing the Apple's cover just to change the volume. 
The documentation accompanying the Voice Box is well written and the 
setup instructions are easy to follow, though it would be nice if it were a 
bit more durable than mimeographed pages stapled together. Still, all of 
the relevant addresses are listed (for those who care), although the best 
part is that it can operate in five minutes or less. 

Also included is an unprotected disk containing four different pro- 
nouncing dictionaries. One dictionary spells all words. There are also a 
variety of utility programs, including one that generates random sen- 
tences that actually make sense. It could be fun to add your own words 
and pep up a party. The dictionaries can be easily altered to include fre- 
quently used technical words or to pronounce the name of a friend cor- 
rectly. In addition, there is a hysterical hi-res face that moves its mouth 
and eyebrows as it speaks. 

Overall, the Voice Box is extremely easy to use, but more important, 
it is very intelligible. It is a pleasure not to have to strain to understand 
the words. Children really thrill at hearing their words repeated back to 
them by the computer. EW 
Voice Box, the Alien Group (27 West Twenty-third Street, New York, NY 10010;

Galactic Adventures. By Tom Reamy. Something old, something new, 
something borrowed, something. . . . Strategic Simulations has taken one 
of the first of its RapidFire series, Galactic Gladiators, and turned it into 
a bona fide fantasy role-playing game. In doing so, it's created a very 
playable game. Ambitious in scope and complexity, the program is 
almost a classic. 

Galactic Adventures places the player as the leader of a combat group 
of adventurers and mercenaries. Bent on increasing skills and financial 



well-being, the players undertake a galaxywide search for treasures and 
mayhem. The more successful the team, the better they become at their 
individual and collective skills. 

A leader is chosen from one of seven regular species from the various 
far-flung planets. Each species has its benefits and disadvantages; they're 
fairly balanced in abilities and native skills. Then the player begins hiring 
or cloning a team to go adventuring. 

The adventures themselves are miniscenarios in which there are half 
a dozen or so rooms to explore. Most rooms have opposing teams of 
single or mixed species and occasional loot in the form of K-devices — 
relics from an unknown culture, best described as magic devices from a 
scientific framework. Unfortunately, all references to that particular sci- 
ence have long since vanished, and without knowledge science becomes 
the occult, or magic. 

The most striking thing about Galactic Adventures is its scope. It's 
vast! There are twenty-six possible scenarios. The areas to be explored 
are contained in the four Guild areas, where teams may embark either on 
special missions to fabled places or try to fight their way out of confine- 
ment — providing, of course, that the team isn't wiped out by berserk 
Robots, missile-slinging Orangaphins, or the dreaded Mole People. For 
those not strong enough to go on adventures, the Streets hold the answer 
to character development. Skills may be earned, or intelligence-raising 
RNA drugs bought. 

But Galactic Adventures^ strength is also its primary weakness. A 
game of this size written mostly in Basic can be painfully slow at times. 
Combat resolution with teams of seven or eight players can take up to 
two minutes per round; that's how long it can take the computer to do its 
bookkeeping. The player's decision making, similar to chess in the sense 
of requiring thinking ahead a few turns, can take quite a while too. All in 
all, a single adventure, one day in game time, can take more than an hour 
to play. Unfortunately, the game can only be paused and saved during 
the periods between complete adventures. To savor the fruits of an expe-

dition, players must see it through to the end, regardless of prior com- 
mitments or emergencies. Most sessions last somewhere between three 
and eight hours. 

Another weakness is Galactic Adventures'* documentation. Fans of 
Strategic Simulations have come to expect the most detailed and com- 
prehensive documentation in the gaming world, but Galactic Adventures 
falls woefully short of that. The lack of explanation as to how the com- 
puter figures line-of-sight rules and why opponents disappear from sight 
while still being able to see and blast at the player's team are minor irri- 
tations. However, the documentation for playing homemade scenarios is 
almost nonexistent. One of Galactic Adventures 's finest features is the 
ability to create adventures. That segment of the program is a four-step, 
menu-driven set of editors for creating settings, populating them with 
treasures and opponents, and adding the various flavors and scents that 
make up a fantasy role-playing game. But, in fact, it is extremely diffi- 
cult to figure out how to use these scenarios once they have been set up. 
Incredibly, there are no instructions for loading and using your own ad- 
ventures in the documentation! 

Nevertheless, Galactic Adventures is an excellent game to play, one of 
the most engrossing programs of the year. The game is open-ended, 
seemingly possessed of infinite variety. It could be better — but only in its 
mechanics, not in design. DA

Bubble Memory Module. You may have heard of bubble memory be- 
fore, but chances are that, unless you're a dedicated hacker with a back- 
ground that extends to other computers, you're a little hazy about what 
exactly bubble memory is. 

Bubble memory has been under development for a while. It is a non- 
volatile device for data storage. Nonvolatile is another of those terms 
that seem to ignore their English meaning when used in computerese. 
The RAM inside your Apple is volatile, meaning that it will lose its data 
when you turn the power off, not that it will ignite when exposed to open 
flame. Bubble memory is nonvolatile; it keeps its data whether the power 
is on or off. 

Bubble memory won't be replacing the RAM in your computer in 
the foreseeable future because, sad to say, it passes data much more 
slowly than RAM. There are practical uses for those bubbles, however, 
and MPC has come up with a good one. 

Sometimes referred to as Bubdisk, the Bubble Memory Module Sys- 
tem uses a 128K Intel bubble chip and is one of the most convenient 
pseudodisks available. 

But not the fastest. Any RAM-based pseudodisk worth the price will 
boast faster data transfer than the Bubdisk. 

Now consider the advantages. The Bubdisk is the first pseudodisk 
that can actually free you from the disk drive. Put it in a higher num- 
bered slot than the actual disk drive and the bubble memory becomes the 
boot disk. You can even leave the real drive out of the system entirely. 
The Bubdisk, with no moving parts, takes to travel much better than a 
disk drive does. Since it needs no power to keep its data, as a RAM-based 
pseudodisk does, it makes the whole system more portable. 

The security-minded could easily create a password system for their 
computers. With the Bubdisk as the boot disk and a hello program with 
proper control-C and reset trapping, the Apple can be made secure 
against unauthorized users. 

There are limitations to the module's use. Copy-protected software 
that has to be booted to run will replace the modified DOS in memory, 
cutting off access to the bubble disk but not overwriting its data. The 
bubble-disk capability can be restored by booting the bubble board. 

The Bubble Memory Module is clearly not for everyone, but in the 
highly diversified Apple marketplace that isn't a great weakness. Hobby- 
ists and programmers with a collection of frequently used, unprotected 
programs will appreciate its speed and convenience. It's a well-designed 
storage system and will certainly find its niche. DD

CA 92123; 714-278-0630). $875. 

War. By Stan Erwin. Adventure International's war game is a simula- 
tion of combat between two stylized armies consisting of bombers, tanks, 
infantry, and engineering units. Set on a colorful hi-res battlefield, human 



or computer opponents square off to mercilessly destroy each other's 
cities. 

The battleground is made up of elements placed randomly within a 
basic structure. Two cities, on opposite ends of the screen, are separated 
by a river and forests. The cities are composed of rectangular areas; the 
number of these areas unoccupied by hostile forces determines the num- 
ber of replacements available to the city's army during the course of the 
battle. Not particularly original, but serviceable. 

The war and the game continue in that vein. Engineer units build 
bridges, armored units destroy bridges. Each opponent has one air- 
plane, and each airplane has a dropable bomb. Incredibly, the high-fly- 
ing bombers can be shot down by enemy ground fire. 

War comes brightly packaged (colorwise, anyway) with a cover de- 
picting a World War I biplane dropping a bomb on a burning city. But 
one plane per player does not an air battle make; the game has little to do 
with aerial bombardment. 

In the solitaire mode, War plays a weak and apparently random 
game. The computer deploys its forces in a manner reminiscent of an old 
ROTC battalion commander without combat experience. The scenario is 
simplistic, without any strategic depth. And the two-page documenta- 
tion is not the "extensive manual" promised on the package. 

Adventure International produces some of the most entertaining ad- 
ventures this side of the Colossal Cave. Unfortunately, War doesn't meet 
the company's usual standards. WHU

SpeedSTAT Volume 1: Frequencies and Crosstabs. By Dennis W. 
LaRue, Tamara L. Sullivan, and Thomas E. Simpson. According to its 
designers, this statistical-analysis package is intended to be so simple that 
a market-research executive can hand it to his secretary, have her enter 
the data, run the analysis, and return neatly formatted, complete reports 
to him. While it might not be quite that simple, there's no doubt that ex- 
tensive computer experience is unnecessary, and a relative newcomer to

with the tutorial and well-documented reference manual. The program is 
entirely menu-driven, including loading and saving disk files, choosing 
printer or screen output, and selecting which statistics to calculate. Like 
all statistical analyses, however, interpretation of the results requires 
training and experience. 

In keeping with its goal of user-friendliness, SpeedSTAT Volume 1, 
the first of five parts of the complete system scheduled to be issued over 
the next several months, comes in what must be one of the most attrac- 
tive and expensive packages of any Apple software. The 7-7 /8-by-9- 1/8- 
inch notebook (a common size for expensive office packages) has dou- 
ble-jointed hinges (the pages thus lie flat even when the notebook is 
propped up on a copy stand) and comes in a heavy cardboard slipcase. 
Even the two disks (copy-protected program disk and copyable work 
disk for saving a certain file, but no backups) come in vinyl sleeves in- 
stead of paper ones. It's impressive-looking, both on the shelf and in use. 

Unfortunately you're paying a lot for the trim and ease of use because 
Volume 1 by itself will calculate only single-sample frequency-distribu- 
tion statistics and selected two-way measures of association including 
joint-frequency tables. Single-set statistics include the first four moments 
about the mean (mean, variance, and measures of skewness and kurto- 
sis), minimum, maximum, range, standard error of the mean, standard 
deviation and variance of the sample, and estimates of the latter values 
for the population. Two-way statistics are chi-square, Cramer's V, lamb- 
da, gamma, Kendall's Tau C, Somer's D, contingency coefficient C, 
Spearman's rho, and Pearson product-moment. All formulas for them 
are documented. Data limitations vary from 6 variables by 2,048 cases 
(the case maximum) to 128 variables (the variable maximum) by 25 
cases. A data set must fit onto a single disk, and the program allows a 
disk to store just one data set even if it takes up only a few bytes. An up- 
grade to permit DIF files is scheduled for release this spring. No plots or 
graphs are available. 

According to the publisher, each of the additional volumes in the 
package will cost approximately the same as this one. Scheduled are Vol- 



ume 2: Regression and Correlation (mid-April), Volume 3: Analysis of 
Variance (mid-May), Volume 4: Time Series Analysis (July), and Volume

Max-Command. By Paul Mason, Louis R. Mayne, and Robert E. Sieg- 
ling. Set in the early twenty-first century, Max-Command is a simulation 
of combat on the fictional plains of AlphaGorda. There, two super- 
powers square off. Equal in strength, each possesses, among more con- 
ventional weapons, the Max One — a long-range missile that renders the 
impact area impassible to the enemy. 

AlphaGorda is divided into a large grid. The randomly drawn battle- 
field offers mountains, lakes, forests, swamps, and devastated areas in hi- 
res. An overlay showing the grid toggles on and off during game play to 
assist movement. 

Prior to game play, the player is shown a series of screens depicting 
the deterioration of the diplomatic situation and confidential military 
commands. There are no selectable levels of game difficulty. Three sepa- 
rate game scenarios are available: Limited War, a specified number of 
turns; Victory Match, a specified number of victory points; and Shikari 
Version, a fight to the finish. 

Play may be either two-player or solitaire. Each side begins combat 
with twelve counters composed of Shikari tanks, mobile laser artillery, 
dart fighters, Perseus missiles, and a Max One. Movement and deploy- 
ment are affected by the random weather generator in the game. Simul- 
taneous movement is not possible and the game proceeds in a series of 
discrete alternating single moves. 

The game recalls chess, with identical numbers and kinds of pieces 
starting from opposite ends of a game board. Like chess, each piece pos- 
sesses different movement allowances and capabilities. The difference is 
the randomized playing field or game board that offers unique opportu- 
nities with each game.

Zendar. By Terry Eagan. The people of Zendar need help. The eight 
countries that make up this island continent have found themselves on 
the brink of economic collapse. Their usually harmonious international 
relationships have begun to deteriorate. One of the countries has decid- 
ed to launch a war against its neighbors as a means of curing its 
economy, a la Mussolini. The whole continent is in danger of being en- 
gulfed in warfare. This situation will challenge the skills of any top-notch 
administrator or political leader. But does the average player have the 
time to accept this challenge? 

Zendar can take eight to ten hours to play. During all this time, little 
feedback is provided for the player to determine how good or bad his 
decisions are. In fact, when the game is over, the player may feel as 
uneasy and uncertain in victory as in defeat! 

Part of the reason Zendar takes so long to play lies in its complexity. 
On each turn, two hundred fifty assets and personnel need to be allo- 
cated among as many as eight countries. Each turn the player must find 
the optimal balance of assets, administrators, military personnel, sci- 
entists, and engineers. The player divides those personnel among seven 
categories of national effort. 

All of these decisions are incredibly time-consuming. But there are 
even more serious delays in the game. The program has an unbelievably 
slow response time. There is a ten-second delay here, a fifteen-second 
delay there, and finally there is a minute-and-a-half delay at the end of 



each turn. It is all too easy to get in the habit of walking away from the 
computer between turns. After a while, the player may forget to come 
back. 

Zendar could be a real challenge. The player is not given all the rules 
of a balanced enonomy but must guess at them. For example, trans- 
portation is surely essential; no use building up manpower and produc- 
tion facilities if there is a shortage of raw materials and/or transporta- 
tion capabilities. Management is important to make things run but 
should not be overdone. There is no use putting a dozen administrators 
on a job, and only one engineer, although our government has done this 
many times in the past. 

Unfortunately, after the game has taken forty mind-numbing turns, 
the thrill wears off. Within seven turns, even a novice will probably suc- 
ceed in annexing or invading all eight countries on the continent. Hold- 
ing on to them presents the next problem. Play can continue for eight 
hours and yet never result in "optimal" strategy. The strategy is good, 
bad, or just plain silly. The program is a very good, complex idea that 
completely got away from its author. PC

Graphics Processing System, the professional version. By Richard 
Blum. Okay. You say you want a graphics system with the ability to save 
and edit, superimpose, manipulate compositions as full-screen pictures, 
and separate objects within a picture or group of objects? You say you 
want to create graphics displays that can be expanded within a graphic 
window four or sixteen times? You say you want a sophisticated screen- 
oriented editing system with a zoom option? Have we got a graphics 
processor for you. . . . 

In the Graphics Processing System the author has created an option 
that rotates a drawing up to 360 degrees and has included the ability to 
create complex shapes, remove hidden lines, and reproduce three- 
dimensional objects. Another option allows the user to enlarge or reduce 
a drawing to virtually any size, and an extensive color editing function 



LOCK-IT-UP 

DISKETTE COPY-PROTECTION 
AND DUPLICATION SYSTEMS 
FOR THE APPLE COMPUTER 

The Lock-lt-Up systems are sophisticated, menu driven 
copy-protection and duplication utilities for the Apple II 
Computer. They feature several levels of protection which 
make standard diskettes uncopyable by even the most 
sophisticated nibble copy programs currently available. 

• All sectors on the diskette can still be used. 

• Data files can be loaded and/or saved to either the protected diskette 
or an unprotected diskette. 

• Memory will be cleared and the disk will reboot if the reset key is 
pushed. 

• The copying systems support up to 14 disk drives. 

• Complete data-verification is optional during copy. 

• Sequential serial numbers are assigned to each diskette produced by 
the system 

• Master diskettes created with the system contain an I.D. stamp that 
you select. The I.D. stamp must be correctly specified before any 
diskettes can be duplicated. This prevents other Lock-lt-Up owners 
from copying your diskettes. 

• Extensive support is provided should you have any problems or 
special needs. 

• Our system is supported by numerous disk copying services should 
you need a large quantity of diskettes duplicated. 

Either system is available for $225, which includes three diskettes, an 
informative manual, and a non-exclusive license to copy as many 
diskettes as needed.

enables the user to select any standard color or mix the Apple II primary 
colors, creating wholly new shades and tones from a screen palette. 

As with any good processor, the drawing on-screen may be dupli- 
cated on another disk or on a graphics printer or plotter. The save disk 
option may be used to create a boilerplate collection of standard graphic 
pictures. 

GPS has a powerful graphic editing package. After a few minutes 
with the system, composing and editing graphics becomes possible with a 
fraction of the time and effort usually necessary. 

GPS can be used with a choice of several graphic drawing tools: 
game paddles, joystick, Apple Graphics Tablet, or Symtec Light Pen. 
Optional hardware includes a 16K RAM card, second disk drive, Hous- 
ton Instrument plotter, Apple Silentype, or other printers with graphic 
options. While the game paddles function in an Etch-A-Sketch-type 
mode, a full function joystick works better, and the Apple Graphics 
Tablet works best. 

The Graphics Processing System comes packaged with two disks. One 
is the full system disk and the other contains special features that en- 
hance the user's graphic compositions. The manual itself is a minor 
triumph of good technical writing. Clear and well organized, it paces the 
user through the many capabilities of the system, carefully documenting 
each procedure. 

The Graphics Processing System operates via a series of nested 
menus. Program functions are then selected via the on-screen cursor. 
This may be a little confusing until the user gains some experience. 
The user creates in a variety of ways, from freehand composition to com- 
puter-assisted automatic straight line drawing. Compositions may be 
drawn, erased, or partially erased at any time. 

The program is excellent, and the author has succeeded in creating a 
true graphic editing system with impressive capabilities and genuine ease 
of use. WUH

Wargle. By Mark Bernstein. Remember when generic blobs going putt- 
putt across the screen and firing wavering little missiles used to make the 
heart beat faster? It was the miracle of movement right there on your 
own personal computer. Return with us now to those glorious days of 
yesteryear. . . . 

With all the Porsche Turbo and Ferrari Berlinetta-type home-arcade 
games now revving their RAMjets in the marketplace, is there still room 
for the kind of Basic transportation that Wargle represents? 

Well, sure. This Nash Rambler of a game, which plays as though 
sired out of Crossfire in an unholy union with Deathrace '82, is a sturdy, 
workmanlike hunk of software, though priced dangerously close to self- 
extinction. 

You're in the maze, waltzing with the usual crew of blind, blunder- 
ing aliens. You had best make your shot count; if you miss, it must pro- 
ceed the length of the mazes before you can fire again. With several of 
the little buggers on your tail, this is a potentially fatal situation. The pos- 
sible strategies are several, and you can become reasonably proficient in a 
reasonable span of time. 

There are six different maze configurations, with speed-ups from 
novice level to tournament. The animation of the program is not 
"smooth" by any definition, but unlike a lot of the new slick whipper- 
snappers in town, it gives you the benefit of the doubt in those close- 
shave situations when you hit the key to fire at your nemesis a split 
second before skidding into the space it was occupying — safe! 

The disk saves high scores permanently, even giving you the option 
of writing in your own score if you don't like the one that's there. 
Hmmm. . . . 

That's all there is to it. The graphics, sound, and animation are noth- 
ing to write home about, but they are as good as need be for the intent 
and the scenario. After about ten minutes you will either curl your lip in 
a disdainful sneer or be totally hooked and keep coming back to it again 
and again. 

What is the true measure of a game? If you get good enough to

Elementary Pascal: Learning To Program Your Computer in Pascal 
with Sherlock Holmes. By Henry Ledgard and Andrew Singer. This is, 
of course, a teach-yourself-Pascal book — but this one is a bit different: 
here, the Pascal Analytical Engine is used to help solve the cases of the 
master detective of Baker Street! 

You will remember, if you are a fan of the Great Man and his work, 
that he was a relentless stickler for logic — always trying to teach poor 
Watson how to observe properly and organize his thinking. It's certainly 
reasonable that he would have been fascinated by Pascal, if the language 
had been known to him. 

It's a little harder to imagine a Babbage calculator running Pascal — 
that's the hardware Holmes uses in the book — but, what the hey, think 
of it as science fiction! 

The book alternates between stories, in which Holmes uses the en- 
gine to help in his cases — programming it in Pascal, of course, and ex- 
plaining each step to the bewildered Watson — and explanatory text, in 
which the authors develop the ideas brought out in the story. 

Each story is plotted around a puzzle or some sort of question that a 
computer program could answer. There's a mystery with clues of the 
form, "The man in Room 12 had gray hair," "The man with tattered 
cuffs had red hair," and the like; several cases involving data analysis, 
from types of cigar ash to criminal records; a request from the Foreign 
Office for an unbreakable code, in which Holmes uses the engine to con- 
struct a double-substitution cipher; and so on. 

After each story, the authors explain the new programming princi- 
ple^) in more detail and give you a wide variety of application examples. 
There is little emphasis on writing .your own programs but plenty of 
examples of how it should be done. 

The authors have tackled a difficult job here and have brought it off

unusually well. It's not easy to have a literary legend teach a modern sub- 
ject without hurling a major insult at either one. But here, the personali- 
ties of Holmes and Watson are re-created very well, as is the atmosphere 
of their time (the illustrations are perfect!) — and the Pascal teaching is 
clear, simple, and integrated with the story. 

The really fanatical Holmes fans won't like it much — they hate to see 
the master doing commercials — and the dedicated Pascal student will 
find purer textbooks than this; but if you are neither of those, you might

Pollywog. By Alan Wootton. 

"When you were a tadpole, and I was a fish, 
in the Palaeozoic time, 
And side by side in the ebbing tide 
We sprawled through the ooze and slime." 
— Langdon Smith, A Toast to a Lady. 
If they gave out a game award in the category "From Way Out There 
in Left Field," Pollywog would be a shooin. 

Not that there's anything particularly wrong with this game; on the 
contrary, Pollywog is one of the most original arcade games on the mar- 
ket today. It is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a copy of any other 
game. 

Just a mite strange. That's immediately obvious from the moment 
you first boot it. 

Colorful lo-res graphics (remember those?) fill the screen with 

provocative abstractions, transforming and resolving themselves grad- 
ually into the title page. 

The attract mode that follows is also composed of abstractions, rep- 
resenting the various "ponds" that serve as the game screens. 

On entering the game, hi-res writing gives an immediate status report: 
level, score, eggs left, and so on, and even wishes you luck. An extremely 
jazzy color-bleed screen dissolve precedes each level. 

Accompanying the action is the tastiest sample of Apple game music 
extant, serving the dual purpose of background music and win/lose 
sound effects. The melody of destruction blends remarkably well with the 
rhythmic counterpoint of survival (no kidding). It must be heard to be 
believed. 

Conceptually, Pollywog is a "survival" game. Each level begins in a 
pond when your eggs hatch. You start out as a school of pollywogs 
swimming through rapidly growing patches of green algae. Eating the 
algae gains points; gain enough points and soon your pollywogs lose 
their tails and grow arms and legs. Poof — your pollywogs have become 
frogs. Eating all the algae completes the level. 

The ponds are infested with creepies who also enjoy a good meal. 
Needless to say, creepies dine on pollywogs. Pollywogs can do nothing 
about the creepies, but once your pollywogs have become frogs, you may 
return the flavor (sorry) by getting in front of a creepie and pushing the 
fire button. No, your frogs don't fire nuclear frog rockets, but their pink 
tongues lash out and, gulp, goodbye creepies. This is a survival game, 
remember? 

Enter the "killer fish" (sounds like a Bruce Lee movie). There is only 
one way to handle killer fish: avoid them. They're not the least bit fussy; 
they eat everything — eggs, pollywogs, frogs . . . definitely bad-news kind 
of guys. 

Now for some good news. Frogs are female. That means that if they 
survive long enough they may lay eggs. (Aren't programmers logical?) If 
they do lay eggs, it's like gaining a bonus man. If one of these eggs hap- 
pens to be blue, oh boy, it possesses "royal characteristics" and may 
grow up to become a prince! That's even better because now it's like get- 
ting two bonus men. That's assuming you last until the end of the level. 

Because you're guiding the general direction of a "school" of crea- 
tures rather than the movement of a single character, control in Polly- 
wog is of a more general nature than you're probably used to. 

Also, in keeping with the abstract nature of the game, shapes are 
colorful and colors are plentiful, but the vague lo-res patterns are con- 
stantly intermingling with each other. It takes some getting used to. 
Don't even think about playing this in black and white!

The overall look, sound, and feel of Pollywog is more like visual 
music than arcade, and more abstract art than action. It's a game that 
more than anything else proves that the potential for arcade game 
graphics is limited not by the computer, only by the imagination. But 
you already knew that. HAS

Bibliotek. A bibliographic management system to aid researchers in 
maintaining a personal file of reprints and copies of literature pertinent 
to an area of interest, Bibliotek is a comprehensive tool that allows cita- 
tion entry, selective retrieval, sorting, and printing of references. 

The program requires two disk drives and will store approximately 
five hundred references per two-disk set. Any number of disks may be 
created (they're copyable), so backups are not a problem. 

Each citation in a bibliography contains all of the information need- 
ed to reference the publication. Each file is designed to include authors' 
and editors' names (maximum of ten), specific title of the publication, ti- 
tle of the entire work, volume and issue numbers, page numbers, and 
dates, plus more, depending on the type of work. Up to six keywords 
may be stored with each citation. 

In searching, you can specify up to five screening parameters, which 
may be selected simultaneously. In addition to date and entire work ti- 
tle, up to ten authors/editors may be specified, up to six keywords may 
be selected, and, finally, as many as six phrases of up to thirty characters 
may be selected to compare for matching in the article title. 

Bibliotek is slow at times, but the amount of time that the user has to 
be in attendance during the slower functions is small. For example, en- 
tries are stored in a temporary batch file as they're made. The batch com- 
mand can be invoked later while you go have lunch; the citations will be 
integrated into the bibliography automatically. This process is the most 
time consuming in the program, so its incorporation as an option is a 
nice time-saving feature. 

The documentation is very well written and takes the user through 
the program in an orderly and logical fashion. The program's only draw- 



back is that only one hundred citations may be sorted at once. The en- 
tire bibliography would therefore have to be sorted into five different al- 
phabetical or chronological lists if you were to have the maximum five 
hundred entries. However, the need for a command to sort the entire bib- 
liography has been acknowledged in the documentation; apparently, fu- 
ture versions will have this feature. 

The program as a whole does what it claims to, and, as an added fea- 
ture, the predefined output format is the same one recommended by the 
Council of Biology Editors. Bibliotek is a useful tool for researchers in 
the science and technical fields. The price may seem a bit hefty, but the 
program appears to be worth every penny of it. till

Grapple. By Tony Lewis. On the remote planetoid Squelchem, the 
strongest prison in the universe has been built. The inhabitants of this 
maximum security facility are among the galaxy's worst mutations — 
creatures such as deviloids, robotesques, and horrible hoppers. To make 
matters worse, these outcasts have trained two local low-life forms, flip- 
pant flyers and sneaky snerds, as pets. 

As prison warden, the player supervises android guards, named 
Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, and a reserve guard named Clyde to ensure 
that no one escapes. The game takes place during an attempted break- 
out; all the universe's dregs are loose and on the attack. Armed with stun 
guns, the android guards can only push the prisoners back a couple of 
steps at a time. With sufficient hits, they fall back over the edge of the 
prison floor and drop to their demise. Their pets, however, can be killed 
with one well placed shot, but they move much faster than their masters. 

As new waves of prisoners come on, the stun gun loses power, 
knocking the monsters back fewer steps. The flippant flyers and sneaky 
snerds seem to attach with renewed anger. 

Grapple is a fast-paced home-arcade game written in GraForth. 
You'll have your hands full trying to squelch 'em on Squelchem. DD

rescued the computers. 

To Anthony Scott: your story, "The Gang 
in New York City," was a) sick, really sick; b) 
grody to the max; c) a fair representation of life 
in the Big Apple; d) enough to make Ray Haj- 
duk look like a Boy Scout; or e) all of the above. 

To Greg Grande: nice story. But we don't 
think the people at Apple would appreciate it if 
you did use your computer to wipe out cops. 

To Duane Carroll: when we read your en- 
try, we couldn't stop laughing. We don't care if 
you and Allen Frieson are "only in this contest 
for the money," or that you "will kill" if you 
don't win. Well, you didn't win. You ought to 
get together with Grande, Scott, and Hajduk; 
you guys could start a swell club. 

To the rest of the school and all other con- 
testants: aren't you glad we didn't embarrass 
you this month? 

Little-Known Contest. Just as we finally got 
our front door repaired from the damage done 
by a deranged penguin driving a bumper car 
(Contest Winners, March 1983), the same beer- 
chugging penguin came careening through our 
back door. Pretty impressive driving skills; how 
he got up the rickety staircase is anyone's guess. 

Swinging joysticks in the air, we chased 
(waddled) after the reckless penguin for a few 
hours before he finally surrendered and handed 
us the following note: 

"Hi, gang, sorry about the door. This is just 
a note to let you know that the first winner of 
Penguin Software's Spy's Demise code contest 
has checked in. 

"Despite some critics' vehement claims to 
the contrary, the code is solvable, as shown by 
Buell Hollister (Shelbourne, VT). He had to 
rack up more than thirty-three thousand points 
in order to get all the pieces of the code. Hollis- 
ter wins an official Spy's Demise T-shirt as a re- 
ward for his excellence in elevator-dodging and 
general espionage skills. 

"The contest continues until there are win- 
ners from each of the fifty states, each Canadi- 
an province, and other countries where spying is 
the favorite pastime it is here." 

Even-Littler-Known Contest. Lawyers al- 
ways tell you to read the fine print before sign- 
ing a contract, and the same goes for reading 
Softalk. Readers of fine print in February's 
Marketalk Reviews discovered a chance to win 
even more stuff for their Apples. 

We posed the question, "Which version of a 
game should be listed in Fastalk, the classic or 
the newer, improved version?" Entries poured 
in, some explaining the merits of listing the clas- 
sic, some arguing that the new version be listed, 
and some missing the point entirely. 



Barrister of the Month awards go to Alan 
"Vintage Version" Fedder (La Mesa, CA) and 
Shawn "Vamped-Up Version" Smith, who pre- 
sented the most logical reasons for listing the 
classic and newer versions respectively. Fedder 
will receive the original version of Beneath Ap- 
ple Manor and The Prisoner, and Smith will re- 
ceive the newer versions of the two. 

A special mention must go to Paul Parrish 
(Houston, TX), who rooted for the latest ver- 
sions by telling us that classics are nice, but we 
must keep up with the times. "Someday your 
grandkids may ask what 'clockwise' means when 
we're living in a world of digital clocks. As long 
as we acknowledge the classics, there is nothing 
wrong with the advancements." 

Gary Mugford (Bramalea, Ontario) almost 
had us convinced, until we read his closing 
analogy. "Like a wine that has become more re- 
fined with time, so has Beneath Apple Manor." 
Something's wrong here. "Refined wine?" 
Yuck! 

Aliens and Other Bezare Things. The Be- 

zardians finally got off their cans and an- 
nounced the winner of the first part of their 
Contest That's Out of This World (way back in 
October, remember?). Dean Carter (Santa Bar- 
bara, CA) wins seventy thousand Bez Bucks' 
worth of Apple software and peripherals for 
having deciphered the game's ad. The direct 
conversion is worth about $15,000, but inter- 
planetary tariffs and other levies reduce it to a 
mere $100. 

The only news on the second part of the 
contest, deciphering the manual and screens of 
their game, is that the Bezardians are taking 
their darn sweet time about finding a winner. 
We're told that the winner will be announced in 
these pages next month. Sure, we're getting im- 
patient, too; but if you're the one who ends up 
winning the Apple II Plus, won't the wait have 
been worth it? 

See you in May, faithful ones. 

The Sound of One Voice Talking (6/82) 
Wilma: Time out (7 /82)! I need a minor diversion 
(3/82) right now. I need to enjdy something refresh- 
ingly avant-garde (4 /82), something really tight and to- 
gether (8/82), something beyond compare (9/82), 
something too cheap to be true{\\ /82). Sam, will you 
turn on the TV? I need to experience a real program 
(5/82) filled with unreal people (7 /82), funny charac- 
ters (9/82), prehistorically modern (1 /83) plots, wood- 
en acting (12/82), explosions (9/82), cowboys, tigers, 
and Indians (12/82)! 

Sam: Uh, there's an Earth, Wind, and Fire (3/82) 
concert now on the air (12/82). . . . 

Wilma: Good grief (2/83)! It figures (8/82). I have 
no tolerance (5/82) for that! It's too much to look at 
(12/82)! 

Sam: Well, the possibilities (9/82) are limited, my 



dear. A quick review (1 1/82) of the TV Guide shows 
not a good rating (4/82) in sight. (Click!) Wait a min- 
ute. . . . What's this? 

Bob: For those of you just tuning in and looking to 
get out (12/82), let me remind you that it's Friday 
(5/82), the big day (4/82)! We're here at NewTown 
(11 /82), deep in the heart of Texas (12/82), where it's 
always fair weather (11/82), continuing our series of 
special reports ( 3 /82) about the sport of kings (7 /82>— 
flying! If you come to Critical Path (5/82) Airfield 
now, you'll be in the right place at the right time 
(4/82), because today is the day of the Third Annual 
Amateur Computer-Designed Aircraft Race! 

Looks like the gang's all here (12/82), and all along 
the control tower ( 1 /83) I can see the spectators wait- 
ing with a special excitement (4/82) for start-up time 
(1/83), when three very brave and daring young men 
(1/83) will reap the wild wind (11/82) in a challenge 
(12/82) of the computer age! 

So, here's a review from the top (3/82) of today's 
race, everyone! These three men — the good, the gen- 
tle, the important (4 /82) — are going to sail away (1 /83) 
on a fantastic flight of fancy (7/82), a light trip (3/82) 
across the great jumble (4/82) of prairie cactus and 
tumbleweed you can see here behind me, for prizes 
(12/82), of course! 

Wilma: Oh boy, a contest (1/83). Whoopee. Is 
there no reprieve (5/82) from such drivel? 

Sam: Well, it's got to be better than "The New 
Pesticides ( 5 /82) and Your Stagecoach ( 1 1 / 82)." Why 
don't we just grin and bear it (1/83) for a while? 
There's nothing else on. 

Bob: Yes, the daring young man (8/82) who ar- 
rives in CompulerTown, USA (5/82) first, which is just 
about five miles from where I'm standing, will win the 
grand prize of $1,000 and Douglas Adams's latest sci- 
fi bestseller, "Keeping Your Cool (12/82) at the Other 
End of the Universe (5 /82)," which includes a special 
note (1 /83) by the editor (1 /83) concerning the role of 
the interpreter (5/82) on Location (3/82) V, a small 
planet in the vicinity of Dial X (9/82). The also-rans 
(l 1 /82) may entertain some great expectations (1/83), 
but they won't be luminously lucky (12/82)! What you 
gain (4/82) for place and show (1 1/82) is $50 and a 
paperback copy of "The Inner Workings (9/82) of 
Scandinavian Leftovers (8/82)." Well, at least it's in 
English (5/82). Might be good for something (7/82). 

But today we're not talking (4/82) to just anyone, 
ladies and gentlemen. We're interviewing a new breed 
(8/82) of racers: three birds of a feather (9/82) who 
will be flying their actual computer-built chariots of 
the clouds (1/83)! Each of the big three (9/82) will at- 
tempt to be a winner (11/82) in the challenge (1/83) of 
champions. But behind every great man there's a little 
computer ( 1 2/82), and you can't beat the A pple (2/82) 
for designing the best! 

Wilma: For the love of Mike (4/82), I wish he'd get 
on with it (7/82)! 

Sam: Why bother ( 1 1 /82)? These guys are just bad 
amateurs (9/82). I'd go with the pros (12/82) if I were 
planning a race like this, although computer-built air- 
planes do sound neat. 

Bob: Well, let's find out who's who here (1/83). 
First we'll be chatting with Peter (5/82) Johnson, one 
of those memorable characters (6/82) with true grit 
(1 1/82), a lust for life (3/82), and a penchant for set- 
ting his goals high (11/82). Peter, before you leave 
(9/82), can you tell us about the aircraft your Apple

designed for you to fly today? 

Peter. Hey, Bobby ol' buddy, I've been talking to 
Apples (3/82) for years, and I've got the winning an- 
swer (7/82)! I feel I'm blessed for success (7 '/ 82)— ex- 
cessive success (4/82)! I'm no prehistoric pilot (1/83), 
Bobby boy. No, my plane, the Teachers Pet (6/82), be 
it ever so humble (5/82), has some special features 
( 1 /83) I've been invariably pleased ( 1 /83) with: a deli- 
cate balance (12 /82) of unlimited potential (4/82), plus 
some other functions (4/82) for getting control (7/82). 

Bob: Some more Applesoft internals (12/82)? For 
inner control (8/82), I suppose. 

Peter: But that's not all (9/82)! Oh, sorry. . . . 

Bob: No, go ahead, interrupt me (3/82). 

Peter Okay, well anyway, it has a streamlined 
body (6/82), it's faster than a speeding bullet (9/82), 
and it gets 15 MPG (12/82) to boot! My personal Ap- 
ple has been reviving an old technique (9/82) in aero- 
dynamics, called the switcheroonie (7/82). All it took 
was a little manual dexterity (8 /82), some experiments 
(9/82), and my magic fingers (1/83) and, voila (9/82)! 
A little bag of tricks (9/82) to reduce the overseas com- 
petition (11/82)! The Teacher's Pet is crammed with 
goodies (7/82), all right. I've been building an Apple- 
throttle (6/82); that's the secret (3/82) to winning. 
Using the Applethrottle (6/82) is easy; it's automatic 



(8 /82)! My Apple designed this plane well. It keeps se- 
crets (6/82) like my Applethrottle well hidden! 

Bob: Say, Peter, we're a little short on time. 

Peter: No problem, Bob ol' buddy. I've got to ad- 
just the scanner (9/82) anyway. 

Bob: Alrighty, so long ( 1 1 /82). And keep it legal 
(7/82), Pete; no jumping the gun (9/82) at the starting 
lineup (5/82)! Hey, how about a round of applause 
(8/82) for this man? 

Wilma: Holy Toledo (6/82), what an airhead that 

Peter is. Ha, ha, ha. Apples? He, he. he (12/82) 

Designing for that guy? I wish we could watch some- 
thing with a little more finesse (12/82)! 

Sam: Oh, it's not so bad, dear. I happened to see 
this race last year. 

Wilma: How interesting. What happened (8/82)? 

Sam: Well, there was a three-hour rain delay 
(7/82), a real thunderstorm (7/82). And one of the pi- 
lots had double vision (8/82). He was a big hit (9/82) 
with everyone; they called him The Searcher ( 1 1 /82). 

Bob: For a bit of background (3 /82), let me say 
that in our last challenge (8/82) this man, Jacques 
Groslaid of France, won the grand prize, as in the 
time before that. So, we'll be getting some answers 
(9/82) about Jacques's travel plans (5/82) for today. 

How about it, Jacques? Let's hear some words 




Here's the artwork for Walter Schendel's (Stacy, MN) Subhead story. Schendel didn't win, but his art 
is on display in the aquatics wing of the Softalk Museum. 



from a winner (3/82) in the strength of tradition (4/82) 
of a champion. Will the remembrance of things past 
( 1 /83) prove helpful here? Can you tell us about your 
plane and how it works (9/82)? Which method should 
you use (9/82) if you want to win? What are your 
secrets for making it fly ( 1 /83)? Any parting remarks 
(7/82)? 

Jacques: I'm just doing what comes naturally 
(5 /82), Bob. Because it 's there (4/82). I mean, birds do 
it (5/82), right? 

Bob: Uh . . . right. Okay, uh, hmmm. Moving 
right along, now, let's follow the tail (9/82) of this 
next, rather bizarre aircraft, and get some additional 
thoughts (3/82) about this race from Huey Fuse, our 
third competitor. Everything in order (9/82), Mr. 
Fuse? Tell us about yourself and your unusual Ap- 
ple-designed aircraft. 

Huey: Well, I can't say much about myself. I 
didn't pass ground school (3 /82); they made me leave 
after the seventh day (8/82). I failed basic training 
(3/82), but I have started a new training season ( 1 1 /82) 
and at least I'm gaining momentum (9/82) now. I tried 
a crash course (5/82) in flying once, but the home- 
work (7/82) was overwhelming, and I couldn't pass 
the first essay test (1 /83). The instructor said I had 
what he called a dislocated memory (3 /82). Right now, 
I'm making up time (4/82); no more fooling around 
(11/82) for me! I need new responsibilities (4/82); 
there's lots to see and learn (4/82) in flying, Bob. I fig- 
ure, old dogs learn new tricks (6/82), so why couldn't 
I? I know the rules (1 /82). If you want the plain truth 
(1/83), only fools rush in (6/82) where there's danger. 
Glad I have my trusty Apple. 

Bob: Just a moment (7/82), Huey, perhaps you 
could tell us about your plane now. 

Huey: Well, the Saturn Express (12/82) is shorter 
and faster (9 /82) than most. I took it for a test flight 
(3 /82) once. Had some tiny troubles (9/82) at first, but 
not after I switched from an inferior computer sys- 
tem to the Apple. I mean, how can you soar with the 
eagles when you're working with turkeys (11/82)? I 
know my limitations (1 /83), though, and I've got a 
flight plan (6/82) all worked out. I'm ready to get 
down to business (8/82). My motto is, "Never go out 
without a route (12/82)." Usually, I start by charting a 
course (7/82); then I get in motion (3/82) and start 
homing in (3/82) on the landmarks (3/82). You gotta 
check for effect (7/82) if you want to do it right! Lis- 
ten, I've got ten hours (4/82) of experience. Guess I 
just believe in doing one thing well (4/82). And that's a 
quote (12/82)!

Tools of the Craft, Part 22 

It is midnight. In a secluded alcove of the catacombs, illuminated 
only by the flickering gleam of a single candle, several cowled figures 
stand, encircling a young girl who kneels in reverence before the Holy Al- 
tar. The soft, droning sounds of a ritual chant fill the air and echo 
through the endless, twisting passageways. Suddenly, the chanting ceases 
as the young one takes a deep breath and recites the ancient incantation: 

Here, your Omniscience, is my poor oblation, 

presented in all its humility. 
May it please the gods, and earn their approval, 

thus granting me inner tranquility. 
But should they find flaws in this, my creation, 

please know that I have the facility 
To find what is bad, and cause its removal, 

if they'll point out my culpability. 

Then, with one hand, she pushes a slim, square object through a slot 
that has been cut into the altar. With the other, she attracts the attention 
of the gods by tapping out a staccato rhythm with her fingers upon a 
sculpted, uneven surface near the slot. After a moment, the hopeful ex- 
pression on her face turns to one of anguish, as the following image 
forms in the mystical looking glass at the top of the altar

Those who are new to the game of programming tend to approach 
the compiler as if it were the Delphic oracle. Only slowly do they realize 
that the compiler is no harsh judge of their programming competence 
but merely the meticulous reporter of their success or failure in following 
Pascal's rules of grammar. 

In truth, the compiler is nothing more (or less) than a mechanical 
tool that helps you exert rational control over the electronic complexity 
that is your Apple computer. Tools are made to be mastered, and it's 
high time you quit offering up your programs to the compiler as if they 
were sacrificial lambs. From now on, you should treat the compiler as 
the hired hand it really is; and learning to give it proper orders is a good 
first step in that direction. 

When activated, the compiler assumes that it has been called to trans- 
late a beginner's program into p-code. In doing so, it takes certain steps 
that may be inconvenient or even objectionable to the experienced pro- 
grammer. It's possible, however, to override the compiler's initial as- 
sumptions and so alter the nature of the compilation process. This can be 
done by placing compiler directives within the text of your Pascal 
programs. 

The Format of Compiler Directives. A directive forces the compiler 
to do things your way and thus identifies you as an experienced pro- 
grammer. It looks like a comment, and it must occur within the text of a 
Pascal program in order to be effective. Yet, no compiler directive is real- 
ly part of the Pascal language, and none is ever translated into p-code (at 
least not in the way that Pascal statements are). Instead, compiler direc- 



tives constitute a tiny, separate language of their own, understood and 
obeyed only by the compiler, and only during program compilation. 
The special opening delimiter 



introduces a compiler directive in the same way that 



introduces a comment. The closing delimiter 
*) 

marks the end of either a compiler directive or a comment. This similar- 
ity between delimiters in directives and comments is intentional and per- 
mits you to move programs written in Apple Pascal to other computer 
systems, in which the Pascal compilers may not recognize compiler di- 
rectives. (Such compilers will ignore any Apple Pascal compiler direc- 
tive, believing it to be a comment.) 

There must be no blank space whatsoever between the star and the 
dollar sign in a compiler directive's opening delimiter or the compiler will 
fail to recognize the directive for what it is, classifying it instead as a com- 
ment. In general, the compiler is quite intolerant of blanks within com- 
piler directives; you may use them only in special circumstances, which 
will be described soon. 

The text between the opening and closing delimiters must consist of 
one or more special instructions to the compiler. Each instruction begins 
with one of several special key-letters. In recognizing key-letters, the 
compiler does not distinguish between upper and lower case. 

In this and succeeding columns, we'll investigate the compiler-direc- 
tive instructions summarized in figure 1 . This is not a complete list, as 
you can see by referring to chapter 4 of the Apple Pascal Language Ref- 
erence Manual. With one exception, however, these instructions are the 
ones that experienced programmers find most helpful and use most of- 
ten. Instructions of a somewhat more exotic nature will be presented and 
explained in columns yet to be written, as necessary to round out discus- 
sions of important advanced features of the Apple Pascal language and 
operating system. 

Many compiler-directive instructions act as switches. That is, you 
may use them to accept or refuse certain services provided by the com- 
piler. This kind of instruction consists of a key-letter, followed immedi- 
ately by an appropriate switch setting, usually either the plus sign (+) or 
the minus sign (-), although a double-plus (++) is appropriate for one 
particular instruction that will be examined shortly. The plus sign is used 
to enable a service, the double-plus to enable a more comprehensive ver-

sion of it, and the minus sign to disable it. 

Some compiler services involve files of I/O devices that you must 
specify by name. Each directive instruction corresponding to such a serv- 
ice requires a name parameter, which is simply an arbitrary sequence of 
printable characters, such that the first character is not the plus sign or 
the minus sign. In order to access the object specified by a name param- 
eter, the compiler itself calls Reset or ReWrite, using the name parame- 
ter as the file name argument to these procedures. This implies that you 
may use one or more blanks to separate a key-letter from a name pa- 
rameter so as to improve the readability of your program. Although 
such blanks are assumed by the compiler to be part of the name parame- 
ter, they are of no consequence, since the operating system subsequently 
ignores them. Bear in mind, however, that this is the only exception to 
the "no-blanks" rule for compiler directives. In particular, you may not 
use blanks to separate key-letters from switch settings. 

Several instructions may occur in one directive, provided that they 
are separated from one another by commas. For instance, 

(*$I-,R + *) 

is a compiler directive containing two different instructions. Every com- 
piler directive must fit completely on one text line, no matter how many 
instructions it contains. 

An instruction requiring a name parameter must be the last one in a 
directive. Examine the two following directives. The first is legal, the sec- 
ond illegal. 

(*$I+,L LISTING.TEXT*) (*$L LISTING.TEXT.I + *) 

In the second case, the compiler takes ' LISTING.TEXT,I+' as the 
name parameter for the L instruction; the 1+ instruction is "swallowed 
up." A name parameter extends from its first character up to (and not in- 
cluding) the directive's closing delimiter, so you must not only be sure to 
place an instruction with a name parameter at the end of a directive, you 
must also take pains to guarantee that no directive contains more than 
one instruction that requires a name parameter. 

Compiling Large Programs. At one point or another, you'll begin 
writing programs that contain hundreds or even thousands of lines of 
Pascal code, and this will put you squarely at odds with one of the Pas- 
cal compiler's primary assumptions: that all programs are short and un- 
sophisticated. The UCSD Pascal System, on which Apple Pascal is 
based, was originally developed for the benefit of fledgling computer-sci- 
ence students at the University of California, San Diego. To enhance the 
learning experience, the designers of UCSD Pascal optimized not only 
the compiler but the entire system to permit quick entry, compilation, 
and revision of the relatively brief and simple programs that students 
tend to write. Unfortunately, these optimizations serve as hurdles in the 
paths of those who would develop substantial programs. Key facilities 
for clearing these hurdles are provided through several compiler-direc- 
tive instructions. 

Include Files. Any program that fits in one text file and can be ma- 
nipulated by the screen editor must also be reasonably short, since no file 
produced by the editor can contain more than a few hundred text lines. 
To write a larger program, you must apportion its text among several 
different files. For instance, a program consisting of 600 lines of 
Pascal code might be split into two files, MYPROGA.TEXT and 
MYPROGBTEXT, each containing 300 lines. 

Unless told otherwise, the compiler knows only to draw source text 
from the file that you name at the beginning of the compilation, which 
we'll call the master source file. However, the "I" (Include) instruction 
permits the compiler to turn its attention temporarily from the master 
source to another, included source file. To illustrate, the directive 

(*$l MYPROGB*) 

tells the compiler to postpone reading the master source file and to draw 
subsequent program text from the file MYPROGBTEXT. When all the 
text in the included source has been processed, the compiler resumes its 
scan of the master source at the point of postponement. 



Note that the name parameter to an I instruction need not include 
the ".TEXT" suffix — the compiler first tries to open the file, given the 
name as written. If it fails, it appends ".TEXT" to the name and tries 
again. If unsuccessful in its second attempt to access the included file, the 
compiler complains of "error 403" ("Error in reading include file"). It 
then abandons the entire compilation. 

In effect, the I instruction stands for the entire text of an included file, 
in much the same way that a constant identifier can stand for some data 
value. You might be tempted to draw a parallel between an I instruction 
and a Pascal procedure call, since both permit textual abbreviation for 
arbitrarily large chunks of source code. Unfortunately, the analogy 
would be a weak one; although a procedure may call another procedure, 
an included file may not itself contain an I instruction. Only master 
source files may "include" other files. 

The I instruction may be used to "chain" two source files to- 
gether during compilation. In the case of MYPROGA.TEXT and 
MYPROGBTEXT, for example, the directive 

(*$l MYPROGB*) 

may be placed at the end of the file MYPROGA.TEXT. Then you may 
compile the entire program by responding to the compiler's question, 
"Compile what file?" with the single file name MYPROGA. When it 
reaches the end of MYPROGA, the compiler will encounter the direc- 
tive containing the I instruction and will pass smoothly on to 
MYPROGB for the rest of the source text. 

What if you expand the program so that the complete source 
text is apportioned among three files, say MYPROGA.TEXT, 
MYPROGBTEXT, and MYPROGCTEXT? Most people would be 
tempted to put the directive 

(*$l MYPROGB*)

at the end of MYPROGA.TEXT and 



(*$l MYPROGC*) 

at the end of MYPROGB.TEXT. This, however, would be a mistake 
and would cause the compiler to report "error 406" ("Include file not le- 
gal"). MYPROGB.TEXT is an "included file," and it is illegal to use an 
I instruction within a compiler directive that occurs inside an included 
file. The correct way to handle this problem is to place both directives, in 
the proper order, at the end of MYPROGA.TEXT. 

When writing very large programs, it is not uncommon for a pro- 
grammer to place all the source code in included files and leave only a 
string of compiler directives in the master source file. For instance, you 
might create a file MYPROG.TEXT, which would contain simply the 
following. 

(* INCLUDE LIST FOR MYPROG *) 
(*$IMYPROGA*) 
(*$IMYPROGB*) 
(*$IMYPROGC*) 

Stylistic Tricks with Included Files. The fastidious programmer 
may employ the "included-file" mechanism to enhance the modularity of 
her programs. Suppose you've written a program named MasterWork, 
which needs to use Capital, Goodlnteger, InToString, and other tools 
we've developed in past columns. Clever programmer that you are, you 
have probably started to group such handy routines together in one or 
more "toolkit files." Using the editor, it's a simple matter to copy these 
routines into your programs as necessary, without having to enter them 
from scratch each time. On the other hand, why clutter your source pro- 
grams with redundant copies of commonly needed procedures and 
functions? 

You can save time, not to mention your Apple's disk space, by using 
the I instruction to force the compiler to "include" any "toolkit" of rou- 
tines at the appropriate locations in your program. Of course, using an 
included file is an all-or-nothing proposition; either all routines in the 
toolkit are included with your program, even some that you may not 
want or need, or none are. The only way to be able to include just a sin- 
gle routine at a time is to put that routine in its own separate text file. 

A rarely exploited aspect of the "included-file" facility enables you to 
improve the clarity of your programs by "clustering" related data decla- 
rations together. Within an included file, there may be several CONST, 
TYPE, or VAR sections at any procedure nesting level, and these sec- 
tions may be placed in any order. Thus, the following declaration area is 
acceptable so long as it occurs within an included file: 

(* DECLARATION LAYOUT POSSIBLE WITHIN INCLUDE FILE *)

Included Files: Points To Ponder. Several crucial points regarding 
the usage of included files should be studied carefully: 

1. For any given level of procedure or function nesting, all declara- 
tions — both those that occur in the master source file and those con- 
tained inside included files — must precede the procedure and function 
declarations at that level. As an example, it is improper to interleave 
global data declarations and global procedure definitions, since all global 
objects exist at the same level of nesting (level 0 — unnested). 

2. All declarations in the master source file at a given level of proce- 
dure nesting must come before declarations at the same level contained 
within included files. Assuming that the file DECS.TEXT contains arbi- 
trary data declarations, the following text in a master source file would 



cause an error condition: 

(* BAD MIXTURE OF DECLARATIONS AND INCLUDE FILES *) 
CONST 

ProgName= 'NETWORKER (VER 1.0 // 1-Feb-83)'; 

(*l DECS*) 

VAR 

NumUsers 
: Integer; 

Fixing the problem requires only that you switch the order of the I in- 
struction (relative to the declarations in the master source file) as 

follows: 

(* GOOD MIXTURE OF DECLARATIONS AND INCLUDE FILES *) 
CONST 

ProgName= 'NETWORKER (VER 1.0 // 1-Feb-83)'; 

VAR 

NumUsers 
: Integer; 

(*l DECS*) 

3. Any declarations occurring in the master source file must follow 
the order prescribed by the Pascal syntax diagrams. 

Compiler Swapping. Now that you are able to create programs of 
any length by stringing together several text files, you will soon find that 
the compiler runs out of RAM memory space during the compilation of 
large and complicated programs. This happens primarily because the 
compiler must consume a certain amount of memory each time you de- 
clare a new object in order to keep track of the object's name and other 
characteristics during the compilation. Such information is kept in a tree-

structured aggregate of data called, for historical reasons, a "sym- 
bol table.'''' 

While the compiler is running, it and the operating system occupy 
most of the RAM available in your Apple. Very little space is left for the 
symbol table. Consequently, your Pascal program will not be able to de- 
clare very many different objects before the symbol table grows too large 
to exist within memory. At this point, a "stack overflow" occurs. 

All stack overflows require that the Pascal system be restarted as if 
from a press of the reset key or a flip of the power switch. Sometimes, the 
p-machine can recognize an overflow as it occurs. In this case, you'll re- 
ceive a brief indication of the problem on your console screen. Often, 
however, the p-machine is totally overwhelmed by a stack overflow and 
doesn't even have time to say "good-bye." In this situation, the reset ap- 
pears to occur spontaneously: the Apple's video screen is covered with 
asterisks, then wiped smoothly to black, and in seconds the Pascal sys- 
tem greets you once again. It is one of the system's great weaknesses that 
even a program of modest size and complexity can cause this cata- 
strophic seizure. 

The compiler-directive instruction S ("compiler Swapping") may be 
used to increase the amount of memory available for symbol table 
storage — at the cost of compiler execution speed. Let's pause for a mo- 
ment and consider how this is done. 

How Is RAM Like a Time-Shared Condo? You know that Pascal pro- 
grams, in the form of p-code, are kept on disks or other mass-storage units 
until you choose to execute them. At your command, the Pascal system 
retrieves an executable program from the code file in which it resides and 
copies the p-codes into RAM memory for quick access during execu- 
tion. However, it is not always necessary (or possible) to copy an entire 
program into memory at once. The programmer may specify that only a 
certain part, or segment, of the program should reside in RAM memory 
at any given time. Other segments remain on disk until they're needed 
during execution, at which point they're loaded into RAM, replacing one 
or more segments that are no longer being used. 

When a segment is loaded into RAM from disk, it is said to be 
"swapped in." A discarded segment is said to be "swapped out," even 
though the copy of it that resides in RAM actually goes nowhere. In- 
stead, it is simply destroyed — overwritten by incoming segments, per- 
haps. After all, the unfortunate segment may always be reloaded from 
disk whenever it is needed again. 

We'll return to the detailed study of "segment swapping" when in fu- 
ture columns we investigate the keyword SEGMENT and the concept of 
UNITs. For now, it's easy to see that swapping tends to slow program 
execution somewhat, since each disk access takes around a second to 
complete. 

The Compiler's Interchangeable Parts. The S instruction accepts 
three switch settings. S- indicates "no swapping"; in other words, it 
forces the entire compiler program to reside in RAM throughout the 
compilation (which is also what happens when you don't bother to use 
the S instruction at all). 

S+ indicates "standard swapping." In this case, the segment of the 
compiler that processes declarations will share RAM space with the seg- 
ment that processes procedure, function, and program bodies. These two 
parts of the compiler are mutually exclusive, since no executable code 
may occur in a declaration area and no declarations may be placed in a 
routine's body. When the "declaration segment" is no longer needed, it 
may be replaced in RAM by the "body segment" and vice versa. This is, 
indeed, what happens when the compiler operates under the influence of 
the S+ instruction. Of course, S+ forces a time-consuming segment- 
swap at every transition between data declarations and executable code. 
Thus, the typical procedure or function triggers two swaps: one for its 
declaration area and one for its body. On the other hand, "standard 
swapping" frees approximately fifty-three hundred words (10,600 bytes) 
of RAM for symbol table growth, which is sufficient for most medium- 
size programs, as well as for many large ones. 

S+ + is the third possible variant of the S instruction, and its story re- 
quires some prefacing. In previous columns, we've identifed several 
"anomalous" constructs in the Apple Pascal language — procedures and 
functions that use somewhat bizarre syntax and so seem to bend the 
otherwise strict grammatical rules of Pascal. For instance, the Reset pro- 



cedure may take either one argument or two, despite the Pascal rule stat- 
ing that all procedures written by you must take a fixed number of 
arguments. 

A third segment of the compiler has sole responsibility for dealing 
with anomalous constructs. Whenever it's not needed, the space that it 
occupies in RAM — about fifteen hundred words (3,000 bytes) — may be 
considered open territory for symbol-table expansion. 

When you use the S++ instruction, you tell the compiler to swap all 
three of its special segments as necessary to maximize the availability of 
RAM during compilation. So long as you avoid the use of anomalous 
constructs, the third swapping segment is never brought into memory, 
and your symbol table is free to grow into the space that would other- 
wise be occupied by that part of the compiler. Beware, though! If at some 
point your program does make use of Pascal's anomalies and the sym- 
bol table has grown too big by this time, the system will try to bring the 
third segment into the insufficient area of free memory that remains, thus 
causing the same stack overflow that you hoped to avoid by using S++ 
in the first place! 

It's very easy for your programs to require the compiler's "anomaly 
segment." Many of the most convenient features of Apple Pascal, in- 
cluding almost all of the facilities for manipulating strings and many of 
those for dealing with files, fall under the classification of "anomalous." 
Here's a reasonably complete list of such built-in procedures and func- 
tions, most of which have not yet been discussed in this column:

The list is accurate, but by the time you read this, it may not be ex- 
haustive for the version of Apple Pascal you use. It is presented here only 
to give you a feeling for the wide variety of circumstances requiring the 
attention of the "anomaly" segment. Luckily, the anomalous constructs 
Read, ReadLn, Write, and WriteLn do not involve this special segment. 
Since they are used so often, these standard procedures are handled by 
sections of the compiler that are always resident in RAM. 

By now it should be clear that S++ is a very tricky and dangerous 
form of the S instruction, to be used with extreme caution, even by very 
experienced programmers. Strategies do exist for permitting the safe use 
of anomalous constructs in large programs, even though the symbol ta- 
ble is sure to leave no room for the "anomaly" segment during compila- 
tion. Sadly, space does not permit us to investigate such methods at this 
time. If you'd like to learn more about them, please drop Jim Merritt a 
line at Softalk. 

One final piece of advice regarding the S instruction: always remem- 
ber that it was designed to influence an entire compilation. Consequent- 
ly, it should appear once (at most) in the text of any program and should 
always be situated ahead of the PROGRAM keyword. If you fail to fol- 
low these recommendations, undefined (and potentially disappointing) 
swapping behavior will result. 

Coming: More Directives. Most people find it nearly impossible to 
comprehend the workings of a large program by studying it one screen- 
ful at a time. It's also hard to repair or improve any program unless you 
can be looking at the source text while the program itself is running. To 
assist you in these pursuits, the compiler will generate a handy program 
listing on paper, provided that you issue the order through the appropri- 
ate compiler-directive instructions, which we'll study next month. 

In addition, we'll look at several of the ways the compiler protects the 
Pascal system from poorly written, renegade programs. As we'll see, 
however, you'll occasionally need to use "renegade methods" in order to 
achieve some desirable end. In such situations, you may employ several 
of next month's compiler-directive instructions in disabling Apple Pas- 
cal's "immune system," thus enabling your programs to compile and 
execute without undue restraint.

BV JEAH VARVEM 

It's a typical morning before school has 
started. Most families in Reily, Ohio, are just 
finishing breakfast, but a half dozen first-grad- 
ers at Reily School are already hard at work. 
They're taking turns battling the dragon, mov- 
ing left, right, up, and down through a maze — 
totally engrossed in trying to beat the clever 
beast at his own game. Captivated by the first- 
graders' involvement is Rich Hofmann, profes- 
sor of educational psychology at Miami Uni- 
versity in Oxford, Ohio. Hofmann is fond of 
dropping by Reily School for a few minutes 
every now and then on his way to the univer- 
sity, where he teaches statistics, research meth- 
ods, and psychometrics. 

Rich Hofmann is far from a casual ob- 
server. When he's not teaching or writing the 
manual to accompany his upcoming theoreti- 
cal and applied statistics package, Hofmann 
creates "software fantasies" on the Apple for 
young children. Dragon Maze, with its blink- 
ing-dot "dragon" that growls and talks, is one 
such program. 

The Computer Graduate. Hofmann is a for- 
mer schoolteacher. His twenty-year association 
with computers began in the early sixties when 
he was in graduate school. When the time came 
to fulfill the foreign-language requirement, Hof- 
mann talked the school into allowing him to 
substitute a computer programming language. 
His fascination with programming and the poten- 
tial of computers has been strong ever since. 

In the course of his professional life, Hof- 
mann's work has been multifocused, spanning 
theoretical statistics and testing theory, child 
psychology and cognitive development, and mi- 
crocomputer software development. Most of his 
past work with computers has been concerned 
with developing statistical applications pro- 
grams on mainframes. He speaks of the last 
three years as among the most satisfying. That's 
how long he's been working with microcom- 
puters and young children. 

Talking about his work with computers is a 
relatively new experience for Hofmann. For the 
first seventeen years, he didn't say much about 
it, even to his family. The closest he came to 
"bringing his work home" before was when he 
recycled used computer paper and old punched 
cards by passing them on to his family. The kids 
drew pictures on the backs of the printouts and 
his wife Lydia, a teacher, made the punched 
cards into flash cards for use in the classroom. 

Hofmann is finding that he enjoys talking 
about his work. "Now," he says, "people are 
more interested in my thoughts than in my 
equations. 

"My first love is fantasy. And I'm intrigued by 
the power of the computer to create a learning fan- 
tasy for children." 

One of Hofmann's primary goals is to make 
the computer a desirable companion for chil- 
dren, because when they like something they're 
learning from and feel comfortable with, they

learn more. Hofmann has found that involving 
multiple senses in the learning process helps 
children relate to microcomputers. 

That's why most of his programs make the 
computer talk. The voice component helps 
young children relate to the computer, so much 
so that the machine becomes akin to a well- 
loved doll or a favorite teddy bear. 

How To Make Your Apple Wacky. Work- 
ing with computers and speech can present 
some problems, says Hofmann. When people 
talk, they tend to run their words together; 
whatever comes before and after a particular 
word or phrase affects how it sounds. Synthetic 
speech is created by decomposing a spoken 
word into phonemes, basic language sounds, 
and then putting it back together. Satisfactorily 
imitating the sounds and patterns of natural 
speech involves taking into account all the ver- 
bal variations in pitch, flow, and timing. 

In endowing his programs with the gift of 
speech, Hofmann uses the Echo II speech syn- 
thesizer from Street Electronics. The Echo syn- 
thesizes speech by replicating the patterns asso- 
ciated with different phonemes. A programmer 
can then arrange the phonemes into word se- 
quences. Word files can be created, reviewed, 
modified, and used in other programs. Levels of 
stress and intonation can be varied via addi- 
tional commands. 

Some of Hofmann's programs require the 
Apple to be a good listener. First, the Apple is 
trained to "recognize" a particular voice by 
means of a "very general voice training algo- 
rithm." Once a user has entered and pro- 
nounced a limited vocabulary, the Apple is able 
to recognize and respond to that speaker's 
voice. 

In teaching young children to work with a 
voice recognition unit (the Heuristics 2000 
Speech Link), Hofmann uses a gamelike pro- 
gram called Froggy. Before a child can play 
Froggy, he or she must pronounce the words 
jump, hop, left, right, turn, speak, and quit. Once 
the speech training algorithm "learns" the new 
voice pattern, the child is able to talk to the 
computer and command the frog to jump, 
turn, and hop around the screen. 

Hofmann's talking programs can open up 
the world of microcomputers to kids who have 
trouble reading the traditional keyboard, kids 
with visual problems that make it hard for them 
to read the standard television or monitor dis- 
play, and kids who have auditory or other 
learning difficulties that affect their ability to 
read. 

Having Fun and In Control. Hofmann's in- 
troductory programs — Dragon Maze, Torpedo, 
and Pronouncer — are designed to be a child's 
first exposure to the microcomputer. His em- 
phasis in these programs is on providing "fun 
experiences in which children are in control of 
the microcomputer environment." Even chil- 
dren who tend to be afraid of anything new 
open up to the computer when they see Hof- 
mann's programs. 

The kids at Reily School are doubly lucky.

APRIL 1983 



They get to use everything Rich Hofmann makes 
and their teacher is Lydia Hofmann, Rich's wife 
and valued partner in the making of computer 
learning materials for young children. Lydia re- 
cently returned to classroom teaching after sev- 
eral years as a school psychologist. Many of her 
ideas are incorporated into the programs her 
husband writes. 

Collaboration, it seems, is the key to many 
successes for the Hofmanns. Working together, 
they wrote the grant request that got Reily 
School its Apple. And, Rich Hofmann ex- 
plains, "virtually all our projects are the result 
of our own emerging ideas that are refined af- 
ter working with kids in the classroom." Typi- 
cally, it is Lydia who conducts the field tests and 
suggests refinements to the original programs. 

Rich Hofmann is a frequent visitor to an- 
other place where children use his programs — 
Dr. Mary Link's kindergarten room at Mc- 
Guffey Laboratory School. He enjoys talking 
with Dr. Link and the children about their ex- 
periences with the computer. 

The school of education at Miami Univer- 
sity shares its microcomputer facility with Mc- 
Guffey students. There are five Apples at the 
school of education computer lab and four 
more shared among the classes at the labora- 
tory school. When the Apple is in the kinder- 
garten room, the kids can use it from eight in 
the morning until school starts and also after 
school until five o'clock. 

Located on the Miami University campus, 
and named for the McGuffey of Reader fame, 



McGuffey is one of the oldest laboratory 
schools in the country. At McGuffey, teachers 
are trained and children are observed, with per- 
mission, for educational research purposes. 
There's even a balcony with one-way mirrors 
from which teachers and children can be ob- 
served as they work together. 

Many McGuffey students are the children 
of faculty members. Classes are small, the kids 
are motivated, and the teachers are dedicated. 
Innovative teaching methods and instructional 
tools are encouraged. The tools Hofmann has 
contributed include programs for teaching pri- 
mary schoolers about directionality, spelling, 
pronunciation, and color. He has also created 
an ever-expanding computer dictionary, a story 
bulletin board, and a little bit of magic he calls a 
touch pad. Most of these programs talk. 

"I typically work on the children's pro- 
grams as a change of pace from my statistical 
work. There's something special about work- 
ing with kids and communicating with them." 

Graphically Teaching. At various times 
during the past couple of years, Hofmann has 
also taught programming to fifth through 
eighth graders. He has found it particularly ef- 
fective to teach programming to kids by intro- 
ducing them first to graphics. 

"The nice thing about the graphics ap- 
proach is that it enables them to conceptualize 
what the end result should be. Then if at first 
they don't get it right, they usually have some 
idea why." Traditional methods of teaching 
programming don't always have this advan-

tage, he notes. 

Hofmann's experience has been that kids 
can learn programming faster than most col- 
lege students can. The explanation for this may 
lie, he proposes, in the fact that college students 
are beginning to assume adult responsibilities, 
while younger children have more time to ex- 
periment. They also tend to have more patience. 
Unlike older students, kids don't expect to be 
proficient in a short time; therefore, they get 
less frustrated and learn more readily. (A case in 
point — now that Hofmann is devoting more time 
to some of his other projects for kids, several 
former students from his grade school pro- 
gramming classes are carrying on with the 
teaching on an informal basis.) 

Is there some quality or characteristic that 
makes some people better prospects than others 
for learning about computers and program- 
ming? Hofrnann says yes, but he doesn't cite su- 
perior intelligence as the factor. 

"Average intellect is fine," he says. "Intel- 
lectually normal children seem to be just as ca- 
pable of programming as intellectually gifted 
children. Being a good programmer requires a 
freedom of the thought process — being less in- 
hibited and having a mind that's free to 
wander." The same way of thinking, he points 
out, characterizes a good scientist. 

"A good scientist will never tell you what 
you can't do." Similarly, he explains, "chil- 
dren never tell you what you can't do — chil- 
dren don't know what they can do, and there- 
fore they do more than we expect." 

You Can't Always Get What You Want. 
What about older people — teachers and par- 
ents? How can they catch up? 

Hofmann has some unexpected yet sensible 
ideas to share. He suggests that when you're just 
beginning it can be good to "accept the com- 
puter as a tool and to recognize the fact that you 
may never be a terribly proficient programmer. 
There's nothing wrong with not being a pro- 
grammer." After all, he points out, if you're an 
adult, you just don't have the time children 
have. 

He also believes that teachers would do well 
to realize that "they're learning with the chil- 
dren and that it's impossible to know every- 
thing there is to know. Too many teachers are 
really worried about using computers because 
they think that they have to be programmers." 
What's most important is "being a facilitator, 
and that means being a very intelligent user." 

Hofmann predicts that more useful instruc- 
tion about computers will occur "as we move 
computers into the existing curriculum. We 
need to have teachers become comfortable with 
computers in their own areas." Then, he sug- 
gests, they can share their excitement and en- 
thusiasm with children in those areas. This is 
preferable to having only one teacher, who may 
have a very specialized or limited perspective, 
covering the subject. "Let's not create new 
courses," he says. "Let's work with what we 
have." 

Someday soon Hofmann would like to con- 
duct a summer computer camp for elementary 
schoolteachers who know nothing about com- 
puters. As he envisions it, from "sunup to sun-

Rich Hofmann and friends share an Apple. 

In designing his programs, Rich Hofmann 
strives to incorporate synthetic speech, good 
graphics, and sound learning principles, believ- 
ing that these elements can be brought together 
to create effective learning tools for young chil- 
dren. Good programs for primary school kids, 
says Hofmann, should also reflect the author's 
knowledge of "cognitive development, learning 
theory, and fine motor development." 

Amazing Dragon. The programs that chil- 
dren at McGuffey Laboratory School and Reily 
School (both in Ohio) are using offer them a 
variety of experiences and activities. When they 
play Hofmann's Dragon Maze, they're learning 
the directional concepts up, down, left, and 
right and they're becoming comfortable with 




the keyboard. Since the keys are labeled with di- 
rectional symbols, the ability to read is not re- 
quired. And when the dragon talks to them, 
even when he's gloating triumphantly, "I got 
you; yum, yum!" (courtesy of Mountain Hard- 
ware's Supertalker and Hofmann's own soft- 
ware) the kids are delighted. 

Another simple yet imaginative program is 
Hofmann's Torpedo. In this game, children re- 
inforce their knowledge of directions and their 
familiarity with the keyboard. They also learn 
to think ahead, to plan their moves rapidly in 
advance. The element of risk and the conse- 
quences of taking a chance (firing a torpedo) are 
also introduced. 

Next come the color-recognition programs. 
Color Guesser is a talking program for kids who 
are learning to recognize and spell the names of 
colors. The program features ten colors. When 



the child hits any letter key, the Apple pro- 
nounces the name of that letter and displays the 
jumbo-sized lower-case letter in a color to be 
guessed by the child. When the correct word is 
typed in, the computer speaks and displays a col- 
orful reward. In Painter, another speaking pro- 
gram, children use game paddles to color in pic- 
tures on the computer screen. First, they move 
the cursor to the area of the picture they want to 
color in. Then they are prompted for the name 
of a color. If they enter the color word correct- 
ly, the computer fills in that part of the picture 
with the color they've chosen. 

Hofmann's spelling programs incorporate a 
collection of words that have been identified as 
fundamental to success in reading. These 
"building-block" words are the ones most chil- 
dren memorize and learn to recognize on sight. 

A Talking Speller. More sophisticated than 
Color Guesser or Painter, the spelling programs 
require learners to be fairly comfortable using 
the keyboard. The first, titled simply Spelling 
Program, is set up by the teacher, who can use it 
to create a unique spelling test for each child in 
the class. When a child uses the program in the 
practice mode, each word the teacher has en- 
tered is displayed on the screen and pronounced 
by an Echo II speech synthesizer from Street 
Electronics. The child must then type in the cor- 
rect spelling of the word. As soon as the child 
presses a wrong key, the Apple intervenes, al- 
lowing three more chances to push the correct 
letter. Then the Apple supplies the problem let-

down" attendees would have all kinds of new 
experiences. They'd be exposed to word proc- 
essing, VisiCalc, elementary programming, and 
programs for children. They'd learn what to 
look for when evaluating courseware, how to 
use Logo to simulate nature, and even how to 
replace a chip in a disk drive. Teachers would 
also learn more about synthetic speech and 
other new technology and assess how these de- 
velopments might affect their work in the 
future. 

Although there's value in some of the edu- 
cational software he's looked at lately, Hof- 
mann has also seen numerous programs that 
don't seem to have much purpose. "Often," he 
says, "there's nothing there that couldn't be 
done with flash cards. That turns children off." 
One of the problems may be that "a lot of the 
people who are writing educational software 
have forgotten that learning is supposed to be 
fun." 

Some people also seem to have forgotten a 
natural resource — kids as critics. Hofmann 
finds it valuable to ask children what they think 
and then to listen to what they have to say. In 
an article published last summer in the Journal 
of Learning Disabilities, Hofmann suggested 
that in some ways, when it comes to programs 
written for children, the children themselves are 
more capable evaluators than the adult experts. 

The Critical Choice. For one thing, he says, 
"children are much franker than adults. That's 
what makes them good critics. I'll be doing 
some work, and adults will come along and say, 
'That's terrific,' because it's something they

ter and the child continues. This way, the 
learner never ends up with a misspelled word. 
In nonpractice mode, the word is pronounced 
by the Echo but is not shown. 

The follow-up to Spelling Program is Hof- 
mann's talking version of Hangman, the tradi- 
tional game that children always seem to like. 

With the aid of the Echo's text-to-speech 
algorithm, Hofmann has created two pro- 
nunciation programs, Pronouncer and Dic- 
tionary. Pronouncer helps very young children 
become comfortable with the Apple keyboard 
by saying the names of letters as the children en- 
ter them and displaying them in jumbo-sized 
form on-screen. Entering a sequence of letters 
and then pressing the return key prompts the 
program to attempt to pronounce the combi- 
nation of letters as a word. 

Dictionary, one of Hofmann's more ambi- 
tious ongoing projects, is a software "module" 
(he compares it to a subroutine) that can be 
used on its own or in conjunction with other 
programs. Children learning to read and hav- 
ing trouble pronouncing a word simply "look it 
up" by typing it on the Apple's keyboard. If the 
word is currently in the Dictionary, the Apple 
pronounces it accurately. If the word is a new 
one, the program tells the child and makes an 
attempt at pronouncing the word anyway. Any 
new words Dictionary encounters are stored 
away, to be analyzed and added to the perma- 
nent file later on. 

The program's vocabulary, expanded almost 



don't know how to do themselves. An eight- 
year-old kid will come along and say that it's 
awful; a kid will tell you what's wrong so you 
can fix it. 

"In so many instances," he adds, "the real 
finishing touches are suggested by the children. 
They'll say, spontaneously, i really think the 
program would be better if. . . .' " One of Hof- 
mann's favorite examples of this happened in 
connection with the Easter story written by the 
children at Reily School. He had shown these 
children page-flipping between the first and sec- 
ond hi-res pages, and they liked the animated 
effect. The hi-res grass in the Easter program is 
animated, because the children told him how it 
should look and that it should move. 

How does Hofmann fit everything in? He'd 
like to say he's very disciplined, but he's not 
sure it's true. Rather, it would seem, he is car- 
ried along by the excitement and satisfaction 
that comes from doing work he really enjoys. 
Further, he attributes his success and ability to 
do so much in so many areas to the coopera- 
tion he gets from the kids, teachers, and others 
he works with — and to his wife, whose support 
and ideas he values tremendously. 

Hofmann gets so involved in his work with 
and for kids that he sometimes feels ready to 
abandon statistics altogether and work entirely 
with computers as they relate to children. He 
likes the energy and wide-open sense of possi- 
bility the microcomputer field offers. 

"Walls haven't been built up," he explains. 
"We don't know what we can't do. That's what 
makes it really exciting." Hi 



daily, includes the words particularly impor- 
tant for children to know "on sight," along with 
other words. A graduate student knowledge- 
able about phonetics does the initial work of 
adding and saving new words to the Dic- 
tionary, using a program Hofmann wrote. 
Later, Hofmann can review the new words, 
modify them, test them in the classroom, and 
perhaps modify them again. When necessary, 
he programs new words himself, breaking them 
down by means of a phonetic coding system. 
He then puts the appropriate sound pieces to- 
gether and stores the word for future use. 

Easter Magic. In the story bulletin board, 
voice synthesis and simple animation tech- 
niques work together to produce "talking 
stories." "The Magic of Easter" written and il- 
lustrated by first-graders at Reily School, was 
created in this way. The story and illustrations 
are developed on paper first. Then the children 
enter their pictures by tracing over them using 
an Apple Graphics Tablet, and Hofmann enters 
the desired words over the pictures. The syn- 
thetic speech is added last. The final product 
moves, talks, and entertains. 

The project Hofmann is most excited about 
lately is the touch pad, an input device that 
works by means of an interface card and a 
touch membrane with a graphic overlay. The 
touch membrane is of the sort used by Chil- 
dren's Television Workshop in the computer 
programs at Sesame Place. 

Now that Hofmann has developed an algo- 



rithm that makes the touch pad and interface 
card work together, young Apple users can by- 
pass the traditional keyboard entirely. The 
touch pad offers upper and lower case alpha- 
bets, the numbers from zero to fifteen, mathe- 
matical operators, directional symbols, colors, 
circles, and squares. Since it's a talking touch 
pad, it also contains a pair of bright red lips. 

The touch pad allows children to indulge their 
natural tendency to experiment. By pressing the 
appropriate symbols on the pad, they can move 
around the screen, play with colors, and ma- 
nipulate numbers, letters, symbols, and shapes. 
When the red lips are pressed, the talking pro- 
gram repeats the letter, number, or word that 
has been entered. It's also possible to do simple 
math problems with voice accompaniment; if 
the child enters "5 + 2," the computer will say 
"equals seven." If a child creates a math prob- 
lem with an incorrect answer (by entering "5 + 2 
= 8," for example), the computer will display 
and repeat aloud what has been entered, but 
will then tell the child that this is not correct. 

It wasn't long, Hofmann reports, before 
children using the touch pad were entering not 
just random letters or the letters in their names, 
but words — both words they knew and words 
they had invented. Through experimentation, 
the kids discovered that including certain 
"magic letters" in the combinations they en- 
tered resulted in words that the talking pro- 
gram could say. The magic letters the children 
had found were vowels.

Mind Your 




0 PETER OLIVIERI 




It seems that every time a person begins to catch up with what's 
going on in the computer field, something new comes along. There are 
now well over a hundred models of microcomputers available for pur- 
chase. And more than two hundred additional models have been an- 
nounced for sale in the coming year. Software abounds. And the variety 
of peripheral equipment you can add to your Apple is endless. It seems 
clear that change is the one constant we can count on; we'll just have to 
learn to live with it and find new ways to adapt to it. 

For example, now that many of us have learned to use VisiCalc, 
database management systems, word processing programs, and graph- 
ics utilities, vendors are releasing all-in-one packages that offer all of 
these capabilities under one roof. Meanwhile, the new Lisa business com- 
puter from Apple has one million bytes of RAM (not our standard 48K). 
And, in a very few years, communicating with the computer via the key- 
board may be an obsolete skill; we'll use the "mouse" or some other 
means instead. 

Other developments include prototype disks that can store eight 
times more data than our familiar floppies and sixteen (and even thirty- 
two) bit machines that can process information at much greater speeds. 

Why is all this happening now? Why weren't these innovations avail- 
able when we bought our Apples? Well, that's the age-old process of 
technological change at work. In many ways, we've been an experimen- 
tal group of sorts for the microcomputer manufacturers. No one really 
knew at the outset what people wanted in a personal computer, and in 
fact many doubted that such a beast would sell at all. It did, of course, 
and over time manufacturers have gotten feedback from users that has 
enabled them to design even better machines than the originals. The vari- 
ous incarnations of the Apple II are a good example of this. In the case of 
the Apple He, the memory has been expanded, there's built-in eighty-col- 
umn display with upper and lower case, and the keyboard has been re- 
designed to incorporate additional capabilities. 

When will it all end? In truth, probably never. We're just at the be- 
ginning of the computer age; and while it may sound trite, we can only 
speculate about what will be available to all of us in the 1990s (only sev- 
en years away). Meantime, expect much of the advancement to be in 
software. The machines available now are still not as friendly as they 
could be, and the new software that's created over the next several years 
will help make them easier and easier to use. We'll also see significantly 
increased disk storage capacity and faster processing speeds. 

Take heart. You're already a knowledgeable computer person. 
You'll have an edge. 

The Teaming Power of Lisa. As you may know, Apple's new Lisa 
business computer comes with many features of the future, including one 
million bytes of RAM, a five-megabyte hard disk, and two floppy disk 
drives capable of storing more than eight hundred thousand charac- 
ters each. 

But the Lisa's real revolution is in software, which by the way uses 
two million bytes of that five-megabyte hard disk. The system includes 
an integrated software package that incorporates a database manage- 
ment system, a word processor, a graphics package, list processing, and a 
PERT-like scheduling package. In addition, another package that comes 
with the system allows the Lisa to emulate a VT100, a VT52, or a TTY 
data communications terminal. All of the programs can communicate 
with each other and data can be passed back and forth between them 
quite easily. 

The machine itself is very easy to use. Because of the mouse, which 
enables users to make menu selections by pointing rather than by means 
of the keyboard, very little typing is necessary. 

Why call it Lisa? A variety of explanations have been put forth. Ac- 



cording to one popular story, it was not uncommon for Apple execu- 
tives to find themselves traveling in the same plane as some of their Atari 
counterparts. In order to be able to communicate about their products 
while in flight, they decided to give their products the first names of their 
wives or friends, hence Lisa. When it came time to release the product, 
the marketing department at Apple came up with another name for the 
machine, but by that time the people who'd worked long and hard on the 
project had grown to know and love Lisa, and Lisa it remained. As you 
might guess, Lisa is also an acronym; it stands for Local Integrated Soft- 
ware Architecture. 

Keywiz! For many people, the interface with the keyboard is the 
most difficult part about learning to use the computer. For example, 
when executives come together to learn to use a software package ( Visi- 
Calc, for instance), they often get frustrated with the amount of key- 
boarding necessary to enter commands. In some cases, telling the com- 
puter what to do requires several keystrokes. 

One creative company, Creative Computers, has fashioned a solu- 
tion to this problem. Its product is Keywiz. 

Keywiz is, in effect, another keyboard. It attaches to your Apple via a 
board placed in one of the peripheral slots in much the same way that a 
disk drive does. You must also connect a cable from the board to your 
keyboard connector. At first, the instructions saying that you have to 
take off the Apple case by removing ten screws from the bottom of the 
machine are a bit intimidating. But the instructions are clear and the in- 
stallation goes smoothly. When you finish installing the device, what you 
have essentially is a second keyboard sitting next to your Apple's 
keyboard. 

The Keywiz contains two pads, one being the standard numeric key- 
pad, the other a pad designed specifically for accepting the VisiCalc 
commands. 

The numeric keypad functions as a quick data-entry device. Many 
Apple owners have complained about the lack of such a pad on the Ap- 
ple II. If you do a lot of numeric-data entry, the pad is a godsend. 

The VisiCalc keypad allows you to enter many (but not all) of the 
VisiCalc commands. There are four arrows on the pad for controlling 
cursor movement. Most of the other keys have two functions. Each key 
has one command written on it in white and another in yellow. Hit the 
key and the white command is executed; hold down the shift key and the 
yellow command is carried out. 

It's very easy to get used to working with this pad, and the single-key- 
stroke commands are much easier to use than the commands within Visi- 
Calc itself. For example, in VisiCalc, if you wish to change the column 
width of your spreadsheet, you must press three keys (a slash to bring up 
the command line, a G to specify a global format, and a C to indicate a 
change in column width). Using the keypad, you hold down the shift key 
and press the key labeled "column width." The VisiCalc commands are 
written out fully on the keys. 

Clearly, Keywiz has the potential to speed up considerably the proc- 
ess of VisiCalc model building. In truth, if this were all Keywiz offered, it 
might be something you could live without. However, there's more; the 
numeric keypad can serve as a word processing keypad. Pressing the 
shift-lock key on the numeric keypad makes the keys take on twenty-two 
common word processing functions. The current version of Keywiz sup- 
ports Apple Writer II, ScreenW riter II, Super-Text, Magic Window, 
WordStar, Executive Secretary, Word Handler, Pie Writer, and Easy 
Writer. Included in the package is a set of stick-on labels (how many 
times have we mentioned labels?). 

If you do a lot of word processing, this product can really save you 
time and effort. Hitting single labeled keys now accomplishes the same 



202 



APRIL 1983 



things that sometimes used to require several keystrokes. For example, you 
may indeed find it much easier to press a single key labeled "delete 
word" in order to delete a word instead of having to type escape control- 
P (as in Screen Writer II). 

Key wiz sells for $299 ( VisiCalc and numeric keypads only), $339 if 
the word processing option is included. That's a bit steep, but you are 
getting three products in one and it's nicely designed. It may not be for 
everyone, but if you do a lot of word processing and you also use Visi- 
Calc, it's well worth considering. Try it out at your dealer's. It's easy to 
learn to use, and you should be able to tell within a few minutes whether 
Keywiz is worth the price for your applications. 

PFS People. If you're a PFS database user or have an interest in 
graphics, read on. Software Publishing Corporation's PFS series of prod- 
ucts includes PFS (formerly Personal Filing System), PFS: File (a data- 
base management program), PFS.Report (a report writer for PFS.File), 
and PFS.Graph (a graphics program). 

Two things about the PFS series of products stand out — high-qual- 
ity user manuals and ease of use. It takes very little time to feel like an ex- 
pert with any of the PFS packages. Some people will argue that there are 
more powerful database packages and more thorough graphics pro- 
grams; that much is true. On the other hand, there are an awful lot of 
PFS users, and a great many database and graphics applications don't 
require a lot of fancy features. 

The program we'll look at here is PFS.Graph, a standalone graphics 
package that can be used whether or not you own any other PFS pack- 
ages. It does "talk to" the PFS. File database, however; so if you own 
that package as well, you'll be able to graph some of the data in your 
database. 

Using PFS. Graph calls for an Apple II or II Plus with at least 48K, a 
television set or monitor, at least one disk drive, and if at all possible a 
printer or plotter. A new PFS. Graph compatible with the He allows users 
to pull eighty-column PFS files. There's also an Apple III version of the 
program. 



You can use PFS. Graph to create, display, and print a graph in well 
under thirty minutes. Most users find this relatively simple to do and en- 
joy the creative aspects of the task. The six functions available from the 
main menu are get or edit data, display a chart, define a chart, save a 
chart, get or remove a chart, and print or plot a chart. 

Up to forty-five graphs can be stored on one disk. Each graph can 
have as many as thirty-six points, and data can be cumulated so that each 
data point represents the total of the Y values up to that point. Data re- 
duction is automatic (that is, if two or more X values have the same Y 
value, they will be combined automatically). In addition, colors, pattern 
filling, and symbols (for multiple-line graphs) are all chosen by the pro- 
gram automatically. 

The get-or-edit-data function allows you to enter data direct from the 
keyboard or to retrieve data from a VisiCalc DIF file or a PFS file. You 
indicate the items that will provide the X and Y values for your graph; as 
many as four graphs can be created on one chart. Once you've entered 
some data, you can merge new data into it; this means you can combine 
data from several sources. 

Charts can be either 3 inches by 4 inches or 8 Vi inches by 1 1 inches. 
If you like, you can have both lines and bars in the same chart. 

The define-chart function lets you add explanatory information to 
your chart. You can display information in three forms — bar chart, line 
graph, or pie chart, and you can stack individual graphs on top of each 
other or display them side by side. If you have a color monitor, charts 
you create can be displayed in color. You can adjust the Y axis to what- 
ever scale you choose. You can provide legends to identify the informa- 
tion in each graph, and you can label the X axis, the Y axis, and the 
graph itself. 

Among PFS. Graph's other features is a special mode for drawing 
charts on transparency masters. 

The Readers Speak. "I just wanted to share with your readers some 
of the ways I currently use my Apple. I have a simple database program 
(PFS. File) that I use to keep records of importance to my family. For ex- 
ample, I have a file that contains an inventory of all our household pos- 
sessions, another that lists birth, health, and educational records of each 
of our children, a file of phone numbers and addresses, and a file of my 
coin collection. I have kept these files not merely for ease of access to the 
information but also as a hedge against any destruction to or loss of my 
records. I have made two copies of each file and keep one of them in a 
safety deposit box at the bank. My insurance company liked that idea, 
since serial numbers of all my valuable equipment were readily avail- 
able. It is a simple system to use and could prove invaluable one 
day" — J. Pareto, Reston, Virginia. 

Your example is a good one. The disk provides a very convenient 
way of storing information. Perhaps your suggestions will motivate other 
readers to keep similar records. It's fairly common for people to keep 
their tax records on disk, but this is the first time someone has described 
this particular application. 

Another good point is raised by your letter. You mention that your 
insurance company looks favorably on this method of record keeping. It 
would be interesting to know if insurance companies would reduce 
the premiums of people who maintain systems of this type. 

Speaking of insurance, business users and personal users alike would 
do well to contact their respective insurance companies to determine 
whether their computer equipment (both hardware and software) is cov- 
ered by their policy. It's easy to forget how valuable one's system has be- 
come now that hardware and software have been added. 

Some companies include coverage of a computer within the limits of 
the existing policy; others require that you add an attachment to the ex- 
isting policy. Still others agree to cover losses only up to a certain 
amount. Forewarned is forearmed! A phone call to find out now wheth- 
er (and to what extent) your computer is covered under your existing 
policy is a dime well spent. 

Well, that's it for another month. See you in May.

Exploring Business Basic, Part 19 

Here's hoping all of you got a chance to see 
the March article in this series, because there's 
going to be lots of information in this month's 
edition, which will build on that exploration of 
character graphics and the associated game that 
was dubbed Bug-Mania. As was said last time, 
Business Basic wasn't exactly designed for 
games (the name is one clue!), but with careful 
design, reasonable graphics performance is pos- 
sible, and the techniques can have a lot of busi- 
ness applications. In fact, the concept of rede- 
fining characters to new shapes can add tre- 
mendously to the effectiveness and readability 
of your screen displays. For proof of this state- 
ment, take a look at Apple's Mail List Man- 
ager program. Special character sets in that pro- 
gram make it one of the best-appearing and eas- 
iest-to-use applications on the Apple III. 

But First, a Word from Our Sponsor. The 
mailbag this month brought a couple of items 
of general interest. First, the question came up 
as to why Business Basic does not allow pro- 
grams larger than 64K bytes. That is, the Basic 
program statements cannot total more than 
64K, excluding variable and array space. This 
question rarely comes up, because 64K is 
enough space for more than three thousand 
program lines, which is a very impractical size 
for a single program. One of these articles some- 
day will cover all the tricks you can do with the 
chain statement to break your program up into 
logical segments. But the question deserves an 
answer, and while we answer it, we'll note some 
other limits of Business Basic as well. 

One of the reasons that limits like 64 K. keep 
coming up relates to the fact that a sixteen-bit 
pointer can store all the possible addresses in a 
64K address space (2 16 = 65,536). The Apple III 
can address more than 64K because it uses ex- 
tended indirect addressing, which makes use of 
three-byte, twenty- four-bit pointers. Three-byte 
pointers take up more space, however, and 
therefore are used only when it makes sense. 
The designers of Business Basic built in several 
such limits to save space and improve perform- 
ance. For example, you are only allowed to 
have 64K of string variable space and 64K of 
simple numeric variable space. You are al- 



lowed as many numeric arrays as will fit, but 
each one must be no more than 64 K. These 
may sound like limits, but remember, most per- 
sonal computer Basics have an absolute limit of 
64K of total space — program, data, the works. 
Ask your friends with an IBM pc what they get 
when they print FRE(O) — right, about 61 K, no 
matter how much memory (above 128K) is ac- 
tually installed! 

It would be remiss not to note another, 
though more esoteric, reason for the program 
size limit. Since Business Basic saves and loads 
programs with a single SOS call, and SOS has a 
64K limit on the total number of bytes in a sin- 
gle read or write, it would be impossible to use a 
program larger than 64K, even if it could be 
written. So now you know. 

The other question is one for which we 
know no ready answer, so your comments are 
solicited. It concerns using the Qume letter- 
quality printer as a graphics-output device. The 
Apple HI Business Graphics package supports 
the Qume, producing hi-res screen dumps and 
other graphic images, but those routines are 
written in Pascal. If anybody has developed 
Qume output routines, drop a note in care of 
Softalk and it will be passed along to the in- 
quirer and to the rest of you in a later column. 

Finally, we have a bug to report in our Feb- 
ruary font editor. As you may recall, the Apple 
III stores fonts in a format that is the reverse of 
the way they are displayed on the screen. The 
program deals with this by reversing the font 
when it is loaded into memory. Unfortunately, 
it fails to reverse it again before saving it back to 
disk. The following lines will handle this task: 

1178 IF choice <> filtyp THEN GOSUB 
2000 

1179 IF filtyp = 3 THEN GOSUB 3950 
1182 IF choice = 3 THEN GOSUB 3950 
Back to Work. Last time, as you may re- 
member, we used the fact that the Apple III has 
a RAM-based, and therefore modifiable, char- 
acter set to create some high-speed animation 
effects. These were accomplished by redefining 
certain characters and then printing them 
rapidly to the screen, taking advantage of the 
fact that printing to the text screen goes very 
rapidly, compared to writing to the graphics 
screen. Since the Apple III has a sixteen-color 



text mode, it can be tough to tell whether the ac- 
tion is occurring in text mode or graphics, espe- 
cially if you do a lot of work with the character 
definitions. 

There are, however, other ways to accom- 
plish the rapid changing of characters on the 
screen for animation and other purposes. For 
example, suppose you wanted to change every 
occurrence of one character shape on the screen 
to another shape. You could simply reprint the 
character and rely on the fact that printing in 
text mode is pretty fast, or you could take ad- 
vantage of a little-known capability of the 
.Console driver, the partial-character-down- 
load feature. This is a control call to the driver 
(remember our previous sessions about console 
capabilities?), specifically control call 17. More 
information about how it works is in the Stan- 
dard Device Drivers Manual in the section on the 
Console driver. Basically, it allows you to 
change up to eight character definitions on the 
fly, and it does this very fast. To give you a feel 
for how this process works, let's try the follow- 
ing program: 

10 DIM a%(511) 

15 INVOKE"/basic/download.inv","/basic/ 

request.inv" 
20 q$ = CHR$(34):array$ = "a%" 
25 text40$ = CHR$(16) + CHR$(1) 
30 INPUT"Name of font file: ";flname$ 
35 name$='q$+flname$+q$ 
40 PERFORM getfont(@name$,@array$) 
The lines above set up the array that will 
hold an alternate character set, invoke the nec- 
essary modules, and load the font into the a% 
array. Although we don't need all these charac- 
ters, it saves us the trouble of entering the defi- 
nitions manually. The next section extracts two 
character definitions: 

45 ltr.a$="":ltr.b$="" 

50 FOR i = 260 TO 263 

55 lt$ = HEX$(a%(i)) 

60 ltr.a$ = ltr.a$+CHR$(TEN(MID$ 

(lt$,1,2)))+CHR$(TEN(MID$(lt$,3,2))) 
65 NEXT i 

70 FOR i=264 TO 267 

75 lt$ = HEX$(a%(i)) 

80 ltr.b$ = ltr.b$+CHR$(TEN(MID$ 

(lt$,1,2)))+CHR$(TEN(MID$(lt$,3,2))) 
85 NEXT i 

The routine above looks a little compli- 
cated, but it's really straightforward. Since the 



206 

SOS control call mechanism in the Request. Inv 
invokable module uses a string variable as the 
parameter list, it is necessary to convert the con- 
tents of the integer array a% into equivalent 
ASCII characters. This is done in lines 55 and 
60 and 75 and 80 by first converting the integer 
into hex format and then treating the result as a 
pair of two-digit hex numbers converted into 
ASCII characters by the CHR$ function. No- 
tice also that since the integer format requires 
four locations for each character, the locations 
260 through 263 and 264 through 267 corre- 
spond to upper-case A and B respectively 
(which probably explains the variable names). 

Now that ltr.aS and ltr.bS contain the defini- 
tions for the two characters, we'll load the font 
into the character generator, turn on forty-col- 
umn mode, clear the screen, and print several 
lines of As and Bs on the screen, like this: 

90 PERFORM loadfont(@array$) 
95 PRINT text40$:HOME 
100 FOR 1=1 TO 10PRINT 

"ABABABABABABABABABABAB": 

NEXT i 

Next, we'll change those characters on- 
screen by using the partial character download 
mentioned before: 

110 name$ = ". console" 
120 ctrlist1$ = CHR$(1) + CHR$(65)+ltr.b$ 
130 ctrlist2$ = CHR$(1) + CHR$(65) + ltr.a$ 
150 PERFORM control(%17,@ctrlist1$) 
name$ 

160 GET a$:IF ASC(a$) = 27 THEN 500 
170 PERFORM control{% 1 7, @ctrlist2$) 
name$ 

180 GET a$:IF ASC(a$)<>27 THEN 150

In line 110, we define the name of the de- 
vice driver to be called, and then lines 120 and 
130 set up the parameter string for the control 
call. Notice that the format is the number of 
characters to be loaded, then the character 
number, followed by the character definition. If 
you load more than one character, the first 
value changes, and then each character defini- 
tion in the string is preceded with its character 
number. In this case, character 65, which is nor- 
mally an upper-case A, is being defined in 
ctrlistlS as a B and in ctrlist2$ as an A. Lines 
150 through 180 do the character switching, 
with get statements in between to allow you to 
see what's going on. By pressing any key, you 
can switch the As to Bs and back. Holding 
down a fast repeating key will give you an idea 
of just how fast these changes can take place. 
Pressing escape will allow the next routine to 
clean up and end 

500 REM restore screen 

510 PRINT CHR$(22);CHR$(14) 

520 TEXT:HOME 

530 nam$=q$+"/basic/standard"+q$ 
540 PERFORM getfont(@nam$,@array$): 

PERFORM loadfont(@array$) 
550 PRINT CHR$(15); 
560 END 

Well, there you have it. The routine above 
could just as easily change every character on- 
screen to a different definition, since the change 
is in the character generator and not in the 
screen memory itself. 

Some Relevance Rears Its Ugly Head. 
What, you ask, does this have to do with Bug- 
Mania and character-set animation? Good 
question, and one about to be answered by the 
next program. Remember, just because we 
changed one letter to another doesn't mean that 
that's the only use of the principle. Last time we 
looked at redefining characters (we used con- 
trol characters 21 through 26) to make little 
creatures to populate our game. The character 
definitions were created by the font editor from 
a few episodes back, or could be created with 
any font-editing program. The next program 
takes those character definitions and demon- 
strates how they can be used to make our little 
critters move. It is similar in structure to the pre- 
vious program, with a more general-purpose de- 
sign, and has some similarities to the game pro- 
gram from last time: 

10 DIM a%(511)

80 GOSUB 700:REM get font 
90 GOSUB 800:REM load up the bugs 
100 GOSUB 600:REM set up screen 

After the initialization in lines 10 through 
70, three subroutines are called to set things up 
for the animation to follow. Here's the first of 
them (in order of use): 

700 RESTORE

The routine above uses some of the tech- 
niques from the last program in defining the 
characters, except that this time we are reading 
the font definition from the data statements in 
lines 780 through 795. These numbers may look 
like gibberish, but, in the immortal words of 
many a programmer, "trust me." These values 
define our tiny creature's head, body, and tail, 
and were, in fact, extracted from a font created 
by the font editor from the February column. In 
the event you have a working version of that 
editor, or a similar one that produces system 
font files, you could use the Bug-Mania font 
from last month, substituting the following lines 
for lines 700 through 795 above: 

700 INPUT"Name of font file: ";flname$

That seems like a lot of repetition, and it is, 
mostly for clarity. As set up, the subroutine will 
extract the characters from last month's game 
set, if you have defined that font. By changing 
the parameters of the for-next loops and in the 
build routine below, you could use any set of 
characters from any font. To simplify the screen 
display and show how powerful the character 
download capability is, we'll build strings of 
creature characters to populate the screen: 

800 char$(0) = " ":char$(1) = CHR$(149): 

char$(2)=CHR$(150):char$(3) 

= CHR$(151) 
810 m$ =".23. ..123. 1223. .13. 123. 3. 23... 

123.1223.." 
820 FOR i=1 TO 40:SUB$(m$,i,1) = 

char$(VAL(MID$(m$,i,1))):NEXT i 
830 RETURN 

This routine uses a technique borrowed 
from the last article to create m$ with the ap- 
propriate characters for the head, body, and tail 
of the creatures. Notice that character values 
greater than 127 are used in order to map into 
the printable control character space. Charac- 
ters 149 through 151 correspond to 21 through 
23 in the standard ASCII set and are the same 
as used in last month's game. 

Now on to the subroutine at 600, which sets 
up the screen and prints many bug-filled strings: 

600 PRINT text40$;bw$;:HOME 
610 PERFORM loadfont(@array$) 
620 FOR i=1 TO 11 
630 PRINT m$ 
640 NEXT i 
650 RETURN 

Now that the setup is done, it's on with the 
show 

110 name$=". console" 

120 ctrlist1$ = CHR$(3)+CHR$(23) + 

head 1 $ +CHR$(22) +body 1 $ + 

CHR$(21)+tail1$ 
130 ctrlist2$=CHR$(3)+CHR$(23) + 

head2$+CHR$(22)+body2$ + 

CHR$(21)+tail2$ 
140 ON KBD GOTO 200 
150 PERFORM control(% 1 7, @ctrlist1 $) 

name$:For i = 1 TO 10*pause:NEXT 
160 PERFORM control(%17,@ctrlist2$) 

name$:FOR i=1 TO 10*pause:NEXT 
170 GOTO 150 

This section is also similar to the corre- 
sponding part of the last program, except that 
this time we load three characters at a time. Al- 
so, instead of requesting input between each 
character switch to slow the display changes 
down, for-next loops are introduced, with a 
variable speed depending on the value of pause. 
Exits and speed changes are taken by pressing 
keys that use the on kbd routine in line 200: 

200 OFF KBD 

210 IF KBD = 27 THEN 500 

220 IF KBD>47 AND KBD<58 THEN

pause = KBD-48 
230 ON KBD GOTO 200 
240 RETURN 

Notice in line 210 that if escape (ASCII 27) 
is pressed, a jump is done to line 500, where the 
program ends. If a number key is pressed, then 
the pause factor is set to that numeric value. 
This allows you to see the speeds possible with 
this technique, while the program is running. 
Obviously, the routine could do lots of other in- 
teresting things. The cleanup routine, very simi- 
lar to the one in the earlier program, looks like 
this: 

500 PRINT CHR$(21);" = " 

510 PRINT CHR$(22);CHR$( 1 4); 

520 TEXT:HOME 

530 nam$=q$ + "/basic/standard" + q$ 
540 PERFORM getfont(@nam$,@array$): 

PERFORM loadfont(@array$) 
550 PRINT CHR$(15); 
560 END 

The only noticeable change in the routine 
above is that the CHR$(21);" = " in line 500 sets 
all console options back to normal. While this is 
not necessary in this case, it is good practice and 
will be required in some later programs. 

That's All Fine, but Was It Good for You? 
Running the program (the data statement ver- 
sion is recommended for starters) will demon- 
strate that this technique can produce some 
really fast stationary animation. With pause 
equal to zero, the critters will run in place so fast 
that you can hardly see their little legs move. 
However, running in place is not what we're af-

ter. The really interesting part is in using the 
character-redefinition capability to produce 
smooth motion. Remember in the last article 
where we achieved animation by printing sev- 
eral different versions of the characters in dif- 
ferent places on the screen? That looked okay, 
but it suffered from one fact of life about print- 
ing characters — namely that there are only a 
limited number of horizontal locations where 
you can print them. In the case of the forty-col- 
umn mode that we have been using, the charac- 
ters appear to jerk from place to place, because 
there are only forty columns to draw them. But 
are we doomed to jerky animation? Not the 
MicroKids! 

One obvious solution to the dilemma, and 
one discussed in a moment, lies in using the hi- 
res graphics screen instead of the text screen 
that we have been using. Since you can draw 
any character at any dot location on the graph- 
ics screen, it's just a matter of repositioning and 
printing. Later on, and especially in the next ar- 
ticle, we'll see how that can open up a whole 
new bag of tricks, but we're not finished with 
what text-mode graphics can do for us yet. 

It Ain't the Mode, It's the Motion. The 
text-mode character sets are so fast that a whole 
new possibility exists to make motion out of 
multiple-character definitions, and therein lies 
the solution to our dilemma. If we could create 
a definition of an object in all the phases of 
moving from one character cell to another, and 
could download these redefinitions rapidly, the 
object would appear to move smoothly from 
one cell to another. Since a character cell is sev- 
en dots wide, this implies that creating smooth 
horizontal motion will require seven different 
definitions of the same character, each one 
moved over one row of pixels into the next 
character cell. All of which leads us to the fol- 
lowing program: 

10 DIM a%(511),ctrlist$(13),head1$(6), 
head2$(6) 

20 INVOKE"/basic/download.inv","basic/ 

request.inv" 
30 q$ = CHR$(34):array$ = "a%" 
40 fg$=CHR$(19):bg$ = CHR$(20) 
50 mblue$ = CHR$(6):white$ = CHR$(15)

80 GOSUB 700:REM get the head definitions 
90 GOSUB 800:REM load the print line 
100 GOSUB 600:REM set up screen 

If the program above looks familiar, it 
should. With the exception of array dimension 
statements for the seven versions of the head, 
and the fourteen versions of the control list nec- 
essary to define the different versions of the 
head, it's the same as in the last program. As in 
the description of that program, let's take the 
subroutines in order

17,3840 

782 DATA 64,16448,16384,0,3607,16144, 
291,7680 

The code in lines 700 through 765 above 
looks simpler (certainly shorter) than in the last 
program, but notice that there is much more da- 
ta. Simply put, each line of data defines two ad- 
jacent character cells. If you look back at the 
data in the previous program, you'll notice that 
the first four elements of line 770 in this pro- 
gram match the data in the first column in the 
other program. That's because 7215, 32545, 
838, and 15360 are the four elements of the font 
definition that make up the creature's head. 
These are loaded by 720 through 735 into the 
first headlS definition. 

The next four numbers, all zeros in this case, 
make up the definition of the adjacent cell. This 
is logical, since the head starts in the first cell 
completely, with the second cell blank. The next 
row of data (line 772) describes what the head 
looks like when it is shifted one dot over in the 
first cell, and the second cell picks up the col- 
umn of dots from the rightmost column of the 
first cell. 

The definition proceeds, each row repre- 
senting the head shifted over one dot column in- 
to the adjacent cell. Since there is already a defi- 
nition for the head completely in a cell, there is 
no need for an eighth definition; we can just 
switch the character definitions around. More 
on that later. Also, as you might have guessed, 
these numbers came from defining the charac- 
ters with the font editor and then printing out 
the results. Changing the program to accom- 
modate font-editor output directly would be 
done in a similar way to the alternate subrou- 
tine in the previous program. 

Next, the subroutine at 800 through 830 
builds the character string in a similar fashion to 
the last program, with some notable exceptions: 

800 char$(0)=" ":char$(1)=CHR$(128): 

char$(2) = CHR$(129) 
810 m$="121 21 2121 21212121 212121 21 2 

12121212121212" 
820 FOR i=1 TO 40:SUB$(m$,i,1)=char$ 

(VAL(MID$(m$,i,1))):NEXT i 
830 RETURN 

Notice that this time we use ASCII 0 and 1 
as our characters to redefine (converted to 128

died by successively redefining the two on the 
screen. Note also that we fill up m$ completely, 
because we want smooth motion from one side 
of the screen to the other. 

Next comes the routine to put our charac- 
ter strings on the screen. This time we've chosen 
to fill nearly the whole screen up with charac- 
ters, to wit: 

600 PRINT text40$;bw$ 
610 HOME:PRINT: PRINT 
620 FOR i=1 TO 21 
630 PRINT m$; 
640 NEXT i

create the horse by defining all the characters, 
each a small piece of the big puzzle. By creating 
multiple definitions of these characters, both in 
place and in motion, you can duplicate that dis- 
play yourself, using the principles in this article. 

RAMbling Onward. As you might guess, 
there are enough suggestions in the last para- 
graph to last a lifetime, but since it's only one 
short month until next month's article, we had 
best move on to the promised treatment of the 
high-resolution graphics mode. As previously 
mentioned, smooth motion on the hi-res screen 
is trivial, and there's nothing like a trivial pro- 
gram to demonstrate that fact:

Getting Your (Color) Priorities Straight. 

Looks pretty much like the last one, right? Not 
right. Notice that our primary colors are 4 and 
1 3, the fillcolor and pencolor respectively. No- 
tice also the color-priority definition in line 45. 
This says that any time color 4 or color 13 is 
printed over color 9 (the color of two border 
strips set up at each edge of the screen), the re- 
sult should remain color 9. Run the program 
and see how this works. You should notice also 
that this time the print string runs backward, 
not forward. The color-priority table is a very 
powerful feature of the Apple III graphics driv- 
er, one exploited very little by programmers. 

Next time we will work this feature to death, 
and in the process do things that would chal- 
lenge the best of the hi-res jocks on less capable 
machines. Until then, remember that a pixel a 
day keeps boredom away, which gives you 
107,520 days to enjoy your Apple III! 1 



Okay, now to make all these little heads pay 
attention: 

110 name$= ".console" 

115 FOR i = 0 TO 6 

120 ctrlist$(i) = CHR$(2) + CHR$(0) + 

head1$(i)+CHR$(1)+head2$(i) 
125 NEXT i 
130 FOR i = 7 TO 13 
135 ctrlist$(i) = CHR$(2) + CHR$(0) + 

head2$(i-7)+CHR$(1)+head1$(i-7) 
140 NEXT i 

145 ON KBD GOTO 200 

150 FOR i=0 TO 13:PERFORM control 

(%17,@ctrlist$(i))name$:NEXT 
155' GOTO 150 

This time We create a series of control 
strings for efficiency. The first seven definitions 
in ctrlistS describe how the head moves from 
character 0 to character 1. The second seven (in 
lines 130 through 140) show how the head looks 
moving from 1 to 0. Recall that, since the screen 
lineup is 010101..., the steady cycling through 
the definitions will create the desired motion. 
Lines 150 and 155 accomplish this, endlessly re- 
peating the whole sequence. 

The on kbd routine is simpler this time, and 
just gives us a way out: 

200 OFF KBD 
210 IF KBD = 27 THEN 500 
220 ON KBD GOTO 200 
230 RETURN 

The cleanup routine at 500 is identical to the 
one in the last program. Just copy it and you'll 
exit to the normal world properly with the es- 
cape key. 

At Long Last, Bug. When you run this, the 
effect is somewhat amazing. With a simple Ba- 
sic program, you're creating smooth anima- 
tion, which takes quite a bit of assembly lan- 
guage on an Apple II, IBM pc, and most other 
computers. In fact, even the best assembly pro- 
grammers would be hard put to create smooth 
motion over such a large area of the screen. But 
wait, you say. You've seen smooth animation 
on the Apple III before. What about that run- 
ning-horse demo on the System Demo disk? If 
you haven't seen it, take a moment to run the 
demo that comes with each Apple III and se- 
lect the horse section. You will see magnificent 
full-color animation that you probably always 
thought was done on the hi-res screen. Think 
again, bucko! That demo uses the same charac- 
ter-set redefinition techniques we've just been 
discussing. If you are patient enough, you might

This just prints the string m$ starting at each 
successive location on the hi-res screen, in this 
case the 140 X 192 sixteen-color mode. One or 
two things should be noted here that will be- 
come important later, especially in the next ar- 
ticle. First, we can print off the screen without 
any apparent problem and without wrapping 
onto the next line. Second, the display seems to 
move faster as less and less of the string is ac- 
tually printed in the display area. Watch this 
closely; it's a clue to what's happening in the 
graphics driver. Another thing is interesting and 
it's worth experimenting with. Try changing the 
text character set before opening the .grafix 
driver, using the techniques previously de- 
scribed. This allows you to print special charac- 
ters like the bug's head onto the graphics screen, 
just as you would any other character. 

If positioning were the only virtue of the 
graphics driver, it would not be nearly as use- 
ful. The next little program provides a clue to 
some of the graphics driver's special capabil- 
ities, which will be used fully in the next excit- 
ing episode of this long-winded serial. Try the 
following:

Looking for a place to deposit your Ap- 
ple and its associated side dishes and goodies? 
Here is a plan with detailed instructions for 
building your own inexpensive computer cup- 
board made basically from one four-foot-by- 
eight-foot sheet of plywood and a few acces- 
sories, like wheels. The finished desk will 
house an Apple II, two disk drives, a printer 
with box of paper, a twelve-inch monitor, a 
gaggle of small manuals or books and note- 
book-size references, a drawer full of disks 
and you'll still have desktop space for con- 
trollers and writing and a shelf for stacking 
stuff. 

With the monitor placed on the lower desk 
surface, the unit is a compact forty-eight inch- 
es wide by thirty-nine inches high by eighteen 
inches deep, which can be rolled into a pretty 
small space. Adding electrical expansion and 
switch control outlets can provide one-plug 
convenience, making the whole thing easy to 
move from one site to another; just plug in 
and run. 

The cost to make a computer cupboard 
starts at about forty dollars for the early-pov- 
erty model and goes up, depending on your

The required and optional materials are listed in table l. Tools re- 
quired for this program are an electric hand saw, a hammer, a screw- 
driver, a paintbrush, sandpaper, a good straightedge, and a tape meas- 
ure. A table or radial arm saw and a jointer-planer would improve the 
quality of the joints; but spackling compound does wonders to fill in the 
joints if they're not perfect. 

Start by laying out the parts on the sheet of plywood, as shown in fig- 
ure l, according to the dimensions in table 2. Use a fine veneer or cabi- 
net blade and cut very carefully, as there is little room for error. The 
shaded area designates the leftovers, which can be saved for use in sam- 
pling paints.

gical incisions. Sand any rough edges but do not chamfer or round them 
yet. The two-by-two-foot clear fir is cut for the foot rest (FR) and the 
drawer guides (DG). However, if you prefer to use purchased drawer 
slides, ignore the DGs and use the smaller W dimension for DB and DR. 

Assemble the pieces, using a good-quality white glue. To hold the 
joints till set, you may simply use finishing nails (set and fill them). If you 
have a set of long furniture clamps, you may omit the nails where they 
would show and trust the glue to do the holding. The sequence of as- 
sembly goes like this (pretend each part is a string): 

A = 7 + 8 + 6 + 9+14 

B = 10 + 2 + 3 + 12 (goes at top edge in back of drawer position) 
C = 4 + 5 + 5+11 +15+15 

D = B+1+13 + A + FR (use a wood screw on each end plus a nail 

or two to prevent rotation) 
E = DB + DR + DS + DS + DF (where D = drawer, B = bottom, R = 

rear, S = side, and F = front) 
F = D + (DG + DG) or drawer slides + E + casters + C 

You are done, but not finished! What about all those nail holes, 
cracks, and that unsightly plywood edge? That's where the Wood Dough 
or spackling compound comes into play. Even if you use a hardwood ve- 
neer plywood and want a natural or stained finish, the simple method for 
the cover-up is to brush or spatula the filler on those eyesores, sand 
smooth, and paint the edges with a trim color. 

If you're a purist wood butcher, you may want to buy strips of ve- 
neer trim to match the plywood and attach these to the exposed edges by 
contact cement or other adhesive (also stain your crack and hole filler to 
match the final finish). For backwoods decor, just fill, sand, and paint. 
Whichever finish you choose, be sure to sand all surfaces as specified by 
the finish and round off or chamfer edges to suit your pleasure before 
you apply the finish. 

What you add from here depends on your needs, desires, and budg- 
et. Here are a few ideas: 

1 . Independent lighted switches for each equipment unit with a com- 
mon cord supplying the whole desk. 

2. Dividers in the drawer for disk filing. 

3. A vinyl window shade attached to the back of the top shelf for a 
pullover dust cover. 

The resulting computer cupboard should be a compact, portable, yet 
safe and efficient place to keep your whole system within reach of your 
fingers and pocketbook. m

Test Your Knowledge of the Apple's Video Capabilities. True or 

false? 

1 . The Apple can display sixteen different colors in the lo-res graph- 
ics mode. 

2. When two adjacent dots on the hi-res screen are "turned on," the 
complementary colors from each dot blend in the eye to form a white 
spot. 

3. Since the Apple's video signal is described as "NTSC-compati- 
ble," it should be possible to use the Apple with other video devices such 
as video-tape recorders, processing amplifiers, and so on. 

If you answered true to any of these questions, then you may not un- 
derstand the Apple as well as you thought. This month's column marks 
the beginning of a two-part article that explains why all of the state- 
ments just listed are false. 

Many articles have been written about the Apple's hi-res graphics ca- 
pabilities. In particular, because of the machine's rather unorthodox de- 
sign, the system has a number of quirks that take some study to under- 
stand fully. Unfortunately, much of the existing literature is riddled with 
inaccuracies and gross oversimplifications. Some of these simplifica- 
tions make the vital information easier to comprehend. After all, no 
formal understanding of the principles of color video is necessary to cre- 
ate images with the Apple from Basic. However, since this column is de- 
voted to hardware, our discussion will indeed focus on the technical 
aspects of the Apple's circuitry. To this end, we will even explore the ac- 
tual components and interconnections responsible for the computer's 
amazing video capabilities. This may get a little rough for readers unfa- 
miliar with electronics, but the fundamental points should get through. 

Hi-res graphics is only one of three video modes within the Apple's 
capabilities. Since the text and lo-res graphics modes share much of the 
same circuitry, it is useful to study the three modes together. 

Video Basics. It would seem that the best place to start is at the be- 
ginning — with a primer on what video is and how it works. In its broad- 
est definition, video refers to the presentation of information as a visual 
image, usually by some electronic means. Nearly all video displays are 
created through some form of cathode-ray tube (CRT), better known as 
a picture tube. 

A CRT consists of an electron gun assembly (similar to the long, nar- 
row neck shown in figure 1 ) and a relatively flat viewing area coated with 



a phosphorescent material. The electron gun contains a small wire fila- 
ment that is heated by passing a current through it, working much the 
way an incandescent light bulb does. This heating element gives off elec- 
trons, which are attracted toward the face of the tube by a high voltage 
(generated by circuits within the television set or monitor). This voltage 
accelerates the electrons to a very high speed. 

When the electrons strike the phosphors on the CRT screen, they 
cause it to glow, creating a small speck of light. The intensity of this spot 
is controlled by an electrode, which varies the number of electrons leav- 
ing the heater area. Finally, the location on the screen where the elec- 
trons hit must also be manipulated. This is accomplished by deflecting 
the beam of electrons either electrostatically or magnetically. In most vid- 
eo displays, the deflection is accomplished by means of two magnetic 
coils wound around the neck of the cathode-ray tube. These are known 
as the deflection yoke(s). When the proper electric signals are applied to 
these yokes, the electron beam can be directed left or right, up or down, 
at will. 

With few exceptions, video displays use a raster-scan technique. This 
means that the electron beam is constantly being swept, in a consistent 
pattern, across the entire screen. Starting in the upper-left corner of the 
screen, the beam is made to scan towards the right. Wherever informa- 
tion is to be displayed, the electron (or beam) current is modulated so 
that it illuminates only the desired areas. When the beam reaches the far 
right edge of the screen, it is turned completely off (or "blanked") and 
then rapidly returned to the left side in preparation for scanning the next 
line. During this time, the beam is also moving toward the bottom of the 
screen so that the next line will appear slightly below the previous one. 
When the beam eventually reaches the bottom of the screen, there's a 
similar blanking period, during which the beam is brought back to its 
"starting" position. 

To standardize the American television industry and to reduce the in- 
formation needed to transfer a video image, the National Television Sys- 
tem Committee (NTSC) was formed in 1953. This committee set down 
the specifications for a raster-scan video system and further defined the 
frequencies, levels, and timing of the video signal. Some of these speci- 
fications are shown in table 1 on the next page. 

It turns out that the electrical signal needed to deflect the electron 
beam horizontally and vertically in the appropriate fashion is quite easy

to obtain. The waveform for this signal is known as a sawtooth, (so 
named for its resemblance to the ragged edge of a saw), and since this sig- 
nal can be created by an oscillator circuit within the monitor or televi- 
sion, it need not be sent along with the video information from the cam- 
era, computer, or other video source. 

In a camera, for instance, there might be another sawtooth oscillator 
that causes an electron beam to scan the face of a video pickup tube. The 
output of this tube would vary according to the brightness level of the 
scene at the exact location of the beam. Thus, if the pickup tube's output 
were connected to the CRT's input, it would "paint" an image on the 
screen of whatever the camera was focused on. 

There is, of course, one hitch. For the system to work properly, the 
pickup tube's scanning position and the CRT's beam deflection must co- 
incide with and track each other. Although the NTSC specification sets 
the frequency for these oscillators, some means of getting them "in 
phase," or synchronized, must be provided. This is accomplished by add- 
ing some special features, (known as horizontal and vertical sync) to the 
video signal. See figure 2. 

The preceding holds true for both black-and-white and color trans- 
mission. When color television was first considered by the NTSC, it was 
decided that some means of adding the color information, while remain- 
ing compatible with black-and-white standards, needed to be found. The 
NTSC's solution was to add a high-frequency subcarrier that could be 
both amplitude and frequency modulated (actually phase modulated) to

carry the Awe (tint) and saturation (color intensity) information. This sub- 
carrier would ride along the video waveform so that to a black-and-white 
receiver it would pass unnoticed. With the proper circuitry in a color set, 
however, this extra signal could be reconstituted into the proper red, 
green, and blue signals needed to drive a typical color CRT. 

As was the case with the horizontal and vertical sync signals, another 
"color sync" signal needed to be added so that the receiver's color oscil- 
lator could be synchronized to that of the original video source. This ad- 
ditional signal is called the color burst because it consists of a burst of ap- 
proximately nine cycles of the originating subcarrier reference oscillator. 

To summarize the NTSC color video system, let's consider its three 
separate parts. Both the sending and receiving devices contain three os- 
cillators: a vertical one at a rate of 29.97 Hz, a horizontal one at 15,735 
Hz, and a subcarrier riding on 3.579545 MHz. Through these oscilla- 
tors, the sending device creates a video signal with the following 
properties: 

1 . There is a negative-going pulse to signify the start of each hori- 
zontal line and a similar signal to signify the beginning of each vertical 
field. 

2. The color reference subcarrier is modulated by signals represent- 
ing the red, green, and blue content of each portion of the active video 
field. These signals in turn create an AM and FM signal that rides along 
with the brightness or luminance signal. In actuality, the phase of this 
subcarrier represents the hue, and the amplitude of the subcarrier cor- 
responds to the saturation of the color. This subcarrier signal is referred 
to as the chrominance subcarrier, or simply chroma. The center point 
around which the subcarrier oscillates is thus the luminance level (refer 
again to figure 2). 

Inside the Apple. Now that we understand the basic principle by 
which television and video monitors function, we can begin to look at the 
circuits within the Apple that generate the video signal. From the pre- 
vious discussion, it is apparent that this signal must contain horizontal 
and vertical sync portions, color burst, chroma information, and video 
luminance. 

Figure 3 represents the heart of the Apple and, in particular, its video 
display capabilities. We start with the master oscillator that feeds a tim- 
ing chain for all of the computer's functions. Here's where the cpu clock 
is established, memory timing signals are created, and video generation 
begins.

Figure 4. Video timing chain. 



The most important devices here, as far as video is concerned, are the 
counters Dll through D14. These integrated circuits divide the 14.3 
MHz master oscillator into signals representing the horizontal and verti- 
cal positions of the raster scan signal being created by the Apple. The sig- 
nals labeled HO to H5, for example, represent in binary the current hori- 
zontal position or cell being displayed. The next signals — VA, VB, and 
VC — are used to specify one of the eight horizontal scan lines within a 
row of characters. The rest of the signals, V0 to V5, signify which row (or 
blanking) is currently active. Figure 4 outlines the major functions of this 
circuit. 

The Apple simplifies things a great deal by creating a digital video sig- 
nal — that is, the level of the signal is either high or low, appearing on the 
screen as either a bright or dark spot respectively. Each line of the video 
display is divided into two segments — the blanking plus sync portion and 
the active video area. The latter zone is where the text or graphics data is 
actually presented. This area is further divided into 560 cells. Each cell 
can be turned on or off according to bit patterns stored in the Apple's 
memory. The exact representation depends on which of the three modes 
the Apple is currently in: text, lo-res graphics, or hi-res graphics. 

To get color, Apple's designers chose its clock rate to be a multiple of 
the 3.58 MHz subcarrier frequency. This meant that the individual dot 
cells could be set up to produce an appropriate chroma signal. In fact, 
there really is no separate luminance or chroma signal generated by the 
Apple. When the digital output from the video circuits alternates on and 
off at the 3.58 rate, a color pixel (picture element) is created. When the 
ratio of on-to-off time is uneven (as it can be in the lo-res mode), the 
brightness level of a pixel can be controlled. If the on time exceeds (or is 
less than) one 3.58 MHz period, the color circuits ignore it and that pixel 
appears as black, white, or gray, depending again on the relative "on 
time" for that pixel.

quantity requirements for new products as 
well as pinpointing cost overrun problems. 
In other words, the FINAL ANALYSIS gives you 
greater control over your organization's costs, reduces 
bookkeeping while providing data for your budget and 
your material requirements 

The FINAL ANALYSIS is the comprehensive Apple II 
& He-based cost management system that lets you: 

• calculate the full cost of your products or services. 

• determine the impact of changes in the prices of inputs 
and/or overhead items on your standard costs. 

• compare your actual costs against your standards to 
pinpoint the reason behind any difference in cost. 

• determine the amount of overhead that is absorbed or 
can be absorbed by production schedules.

Operation is sim- 
ple. You enter cost and 
formula information into a 
model. The system integrates 
this data for you into a single 
consistent database for cost 
and quantity calculations. Calcu-

and inverted to form the composite sync signal. (The real hacker won't 
find it too difficult to trace back further for a closer look at what pro- 
vides the two sync signals, but this analysis would only complicate our 
discussion here. If you do trace back any further, however, note that the 
circuits shown in these figures are for Revision 7 Apples and up. Earlier 
motherboards had a slightly different circuit that actually caused sync to 
be too wide and burst to appear too late.) 

Returning to the summing point and to R6, we can trace this signal 
back to the output of B12, pin 12 (B 12- 12), and the LC ringing network 
of C3, C2, and LI. The inputs to B12 consist of the 3.58 color reference 
signal and a gating circuit at C13 that turns on B 12 during the color burst 
period. The output of this gate is thus a square wave burst signal. Work- 
ing together, R5 and the LC network turn this signal into something 
closer to a sine wave, which is more acceptable to monitors and televi- 
sion sets. The adjustable trimmer capacitor C3 affords some phase 
adjustment and thus acts much like the tint control on a receiver. 

Since the Apple creates digital-square-wave video based on the color 
reference frequency, there will obviously be quite a bit of chroma noise — 
spurious 3.58 signals even when noncolor images are being displayed. 
When viewing text, for example, it would be desirable to be able to 
eliminate these color fringes by shutting off the color circuits in the 
monitor. All Revision 1 and above motherboards have a "color killer" 
circuit composed of Q6 and R27. The transistor effectively grounds out 
the burst signal whenever the text mode is enabled. Without burst, the 
Apple's video will appear to the television set or monitor as a mono- 
chrome signal, and it will revert to that mode. To further reduce the pos- 
sibility of color noise in very sensitive sets, the Revision 7 modifications 
include a gate at A 14-1 to disconnect the color reference signal com- 
pletely in the text mode. 

So far we have a composite sync signal with color burst added only 
when in a graphics mode. The final element is the picture video itself, 
which comes into the summer via R7. This signal is by far the most com- 
plicated of the three and comes from a variety of sources, depending on 
the active video mode of the Apple. The only thing common to these

modes is that the video display/refresh timing is still the same. This 
means that during the active video portion (that is, excluding blanking) 
of each line, the cpu executes forty machine cycles. During each cycle, 
the video generation circuits access one location in either of the text or 
graphics pages of RAM and display the results. Exactly which area of 
RAM is used and how that data is turned into video depends on which 
video mode is in use. Let's now discuss each of these modes in detail. 

Text Mode. As we said earlier, the color burst signal is removed 
from the video signal when the Apple's in text mode. Thus the only func- 
tion of the video generator is to create a signal that will turn the CRT's 
electron beam on and off as it scans across the face of the tube. When- 
ever the beam is on, it creates light areas on the screen; whenever it's off, 
the screen is black. By turning it on at the right moments, the Apple can 
produce some recognizable information on the screen. 

To accomplish this, the Apple's video circuits divide each horizontal 
line into a finite number of pixels. We already know that each line con- 
tains forty cells, where each cell corresponds to a given memory location 
in RAM. In text mode these RAM locations are normally in the range of 
$40O-$7FF. The figure on page 16 of the Apple II Reference Manual de- 
tails how the text page is mapped into this area of memory. There's also a 
second text screen page at locations $800 through $BFF, which can be 
displayed by setting an appropriate "soft switch" within the Apple. 

Each of the forty cells on one line is further divided into seven dots; 
the result is a total of 280 pixels per line. Vertically, the screen is divided 
into twenty-four rows of eight scan lines each. Within this framework, 
the Apple tries to create text characters by turning on the appropriate 
dots within the seven-dot-by-eight-line matrix associated with each cell. 
Actually, there must be some blank space between characters; therefore, 
two dots and one line within every cell are usually left off. In early Ap- 
ples with the 2513 ROM character generator IC, the blank dots were 
hardwired into the shift register A3 and the blank line was stored within 
the ROM. In later machines, a 2316 ROM SPCL or a 2716 compatible 
EPROM takes the place of the 2513. This allows for much more free- 
dom in the text display. For example, lower-case characters can now be 
easily added. 

In any case, the data read from the screen area of RAM is latched 
(stored) and fed into the character generator, A5. The lower three bits of 
this ROM come from the vertical counters that determine which line 
within the cell is being scanned. Depending on which line is being 
scanned and what character is to be displayed (via the upper six to eight 
bits), the ROM outputs a five or seven bit word that represents the dots 
that need to be turned on. This word is sent to the shift register, A3, 
where it is converted into a serial bit stream in order to create the video 
signal. 

Before leaving the Apple, however, this bit stream passes through a 
number of important channels. First, after coming out from the shift 
register at A3-13, it passes through an exclusive-OR gate at B2-11. The 
other input to this gate is normally high in order that the video signal will 
pass through unchanged. However, when the high-order bit of the video 
RAM data is a 1, this causes B134 to place a low at B2-1 2 (remember 
that A10 is just a latch and that its D inputs just pass through to the cor- 
responding Q outputs). This causes the video data to be inverted, and 
therefore the characters show up on the screen in inverse (black-on- 
white). Likewise, whenever bit 7 is low and bit 6 high, the output of the 
flash oscillator, B3, is sent to the exclusive-OR gate. Note that the Revi- 
sion 7 boards have extra provisions to control these signals from the 
ROM character generator IC. 

After leaving B2, the video signal passes through a selector switch at 
A9. The function of this IC is to select either the character generator or 
the graphics shift registers B4 and B9 as the source of video. Because of 
the signals from A 12 and A8, the text video passes through A9 and final- 
ly into B10-2 where it is clocked once more at the 14 MHz master clock 
rate. The output finally gets combined with sync through R7. This signal 
then goes out to the monitor, where it turns on the appropriate dots 
across the screen. Thus the first line of one character has been created. 

Immediately after sending out these seven dots (or undots), the data 
latch grabs the next byte to be displayed. This again is fed into the ROM 
and shift register whereby the first line of the next character is displayed. 
When forty consecutive bytes of memory have been read, an entire ras-

ter line has been scanned and the beginnings of forty characters have 
been drawn on the screen. After retrace and blanking, the beam is ready 
to create the next line. The same memory locations are accessed again, 
only now the vertical line counter has incremented by one. Therefore the 
addresses presented to the character generator ROM have been changed 
so that the necessary dots on this next line will be displayed. 

After seven passes (eight if you include the blank line), the complete 
dot patterns for all forty characters on the line have been presented. Now 
the vertical row counters advance so that a new area of RAM is used and 
the process continues, displaying another forty characters in the same 
way. After twenty-four rows and vertical blanking, the whole thing starts 
over again. 

This technique, known as a memory mapped display, has several ad- 
vantages. To begin with, it provides a quick and easy way to create text 
displays — simply put the appropriate data into the video display RAM. 
This can be accomplished by means of ordinary machine language in- 
structions, including the powerful extended addressing modes. Chang- 
ing one character in the display requires only one memory access. Since 
cpu activity and video generation are interleaved, there are no memory 
conflicts and the video display contains no "glitches." And lastly, a mem- 
ory mapped display provides a convenient way to refresh the dynamic 
memory chips used in the Apple. 

Lo-Res Graphics. When the lo-res graphics mode is being switched 
to, the most significant change takes place at A9. This IC now takes the 
output of either B4 or B9 as the source of video information. Which of 
these is chosen is determined by the VC signal that makes its way to A9- 
10. This signal divides each of the forty cells into two parts: an upper part 
during the first four scan lines and a lower part during the remaining 
four. (Since this has the effect of creating forty-eight rows out of the nor- 
mal twenty-four, it explains the forty-by-forty-eight resolution of the lo- 
res-graphics screen.) Furthermore, we can see that the information for 
the upper half of each cell comes from B4, while the information for the 
lower half comes from B9. 

These shift registers get loaded at the beginning of each cell by the 



LD194 signal from B12-8. The lowest four bits of the RAM data get 
loaded into B4, while the higher bits go to B9. If you follow the shift 
register control lines around, you'll find that they enable the register to 
shift the data around continuously in a loop at the full 14 MHz clock 
rate. Note that the cpu clock cycles, and thus the LD194 pulse, occur 
once every fourteen master clock cycles. Thus the four bits in the shift 
register will be read out three and a half times for each of the four lines of 
a given lo-res color pixel. It is the exact bit content of these registers that 
determines the color to be displayed. 

Because of the chosen clock rate, all but three patterns will contain a 
3.58 MHz component. Of course, all bits off results in black and all bits 
on makes white. Alternating bits causes a 7 MHz signal to be gener- 
ated — this creates a line of "half-size" dots on a high-resolution mono- 
chrome monitor and does not carry any color information. The effect is a 
luminance level halfway between black and white. Since there are two 
possible patterns of alternating bits (0101 [decimal 5] and 1010 [decimal 
10]), there are two values that give a gray color. (Therefore the lo-res 
mode has only fifteen distinct color possibilities — how did you do on 
question number one?) All other possible bit combinations yield varying 
hues and luminance levels. Basically the transitions from high to low de- 
termine the phase of the color signal and thus its hue. The total number 
of high bits will set the luminance level. 

There's one problem with this technique. Since each cell clocks out its 
bit stream three and a half times, the start of the next cell will be off by 
one-half color cycle. This could be compensated for in software by shift- 
ing the data in every other byte of memory for a solid background but 
that would be messy. Instead, the HO signal, which alternates during 
every other cell, is used to select either the Q0 or Q2 output from the shift 
registers, depending upon screen position. This latter output is 180 de- 
grees out of phase and thus provides the one-half-cycle compensation as 
far as the color circuits are concerned. 

Next month we'll answer questions two and three, look closely at the 
hi-res-graphics display, and discuss RGB video boards and various 
monochrome and color monitors. ~M

□ Systems Plus (Palo Alto, CA), internation- 
al marketer of microcomputer business-appli- 
cations software, has renewed its contract with 
Software Dimensions (Citrus Heights, CA) to 
continue selling Accounting Plus and all other 
Software Dimensions products. "We signed a 
contract that reflects our sales to date and the 
rise expected for 1983," says Systems Plus presi- 
dent Rick Mehrlich. Systems Plus began mar- 
keting the five-module Accounting Plus Super /e 
for the Apple He in March. "Systems Plus has 
worked with Accounting Plus for nearly three 
years and has come to understand the market- 
ing of business-applications software that clear- 
ly positions it as a leader in the field," says Soft- 
ware Dimensions president Ron Green. "They 
continue to develop new sales aids and support 
techniques, which have consequently increased 
the attraction of the product to dealers while di- 
minishing the need for support." 

Green maintains that the product became a 
little too attractive to Megaware Systems (La- 
guna Hills, CA), charging that the company's 
Micromate III is an exact copy of Accounting 
Plus. "They pirated it," says Green. "They 
copied the entire program and documenta- 
tion." Software Dimensions is seeking an in- 
junction against further production of Micro- 
mate III, the impounding of all present copies, 
$1.5 million in punitive damages, more than 
$ 1 50,000 in statutory damages, and reimburse- 
ment to the company of all profits made from 
the sale of Micromate III.

SOFTCARD 
Symposium 

by Greg Tibbetts 



When we left off last month's Symposium, we had just finished 
examining the CONOUT subroutines and had therefore also completed 
our discussion of the BIOS logical Console device. This month, then, 
we'll begin our discussion of the logical Reader device, the next of the 
four devices we've categorized as character I/O. 

Once again, we won't be presenting actual source code during this dis- 
cussion, but since we will be mentioning specific addresses and the pur- 
poses of routines at those addresses, you'll be able to start making alter- 
ations to the character I/O routines. This kind of experimentation is one 
of the best ways to learn about the subject at hand, but do use caution 
and always maintain a backup copy of any disk you modify in this 
fashion. 

Readers who wish to share modifications made to their systems are 
invited to forward copies of the mods to SoftCard Symposium in care of 
Softalk. No promise is made to print all such submissions, but those 
printed will include authors' names unless specific requests to the con- 
trary are made. 

As a quick review, let's reexamine the subject of I/O. Early on, we 
said that the BIOS is responsible for providing seventeen functions (cor- 
responding to seventeen routines in the BIOS), which can be accessed, 
via calls to the routines, by BDOS. We broke these functions down into 
three categories: system (re)initialization, character I/O, and disk I/O. 

System initialization, the first category, has two functions (and con- 
sequently two routines): namely BOOT (the system cold start) and 
WBOOT (the system warm start), both of which we examined some 
months ago. 

Character I/O, which we're examining currently, has seven functions 
or routines. So far we've discussed three of these: CONST, the console 
status; CONIN, the console input; and CONOUT, the console output. 
The other four character I/O routines are READER, the alternate input 
device; PUNCH, the alternate output device; LIST, the system printer 
output; and LISTST, the printer status. 

Disk I/O, which we'll examine later on, has eight functions: HOME 
(seek track zero), SELDSK (select a specific drive), SETTRK (seek a 
specific track), SETSEC (seek a specific sector), SETDMA (select a mem- 
ory range to read or write data to disk), READ (read a disk sector), 
WRITE (write a disk sector), and SECTRAN (translate a logical sector 
number into a physical sector). Some of these functions may not make 
much sense at this point; they'll become clearer when we take up this 
category later on and examine them in detail. 

The seven character I/O routines are organized around something 
called a device. This term has two possible meanings, depending on 
whether we're speaking of logical devices or physical devices. As we dis- 
cussed in an earlier column, logical devices, though they represent a spe- 
cific function that would require a hardware peripheral, are independent 
of actual hardware. The term is simply a way for BDOS to categorize the 
attributes that such a device would have. In this way, you might want to 
think of logical devices as types or categories of devices, rather than as 
something physical. For example, all of the actual hardware peripheral 
devices we discussed during the columns on the CONST, CONIN, and 
CONOUT routines are in the "Console device" category. 

In speaking of the logical Reader device (a category of many physical 



U1WW1U1W1U1 

devices, remember), Digital Research defines it as "the principal tape 
reading device, such as a simple optical reader or teletype." The fact that 
few of us use teletypes or other tape or card readers makes little differ- 
ence; a logical device (or category) of this type can include any actual pe- 
ripheral device that can send character data as input, one character at a 
time on request. 

This category also can include the input portion of a device that has 
the capability to do both input and output of such data in that format. 
Such a peripheral may sound suspiciously like the physical devices we 
discussed when we talked about the logical console, and indeed there are 
devices that would serve both purposes. There are, however, some subtle 
differences in the way the two types of devices are treated. The main such 
difference is that a peripheral included in the Reader device category is 
not assumed to be the main source of operator input for the system; that 
is, its input usually consists of a block of character data that's submitted 
to the system one character at a time on request, as opposed to being a 
random series of inputs of indeterminate length (like keyboard input). 

The difference just described is definitely a subtle one, and there are 
cases in which it does not apply, such as when one computer is used to 
control another through the Reader device or during batch processing, 
where control and data both come through this device. It is, however, a 
valid difference to BDOS, since BDOS will not accept such control via 
the Reader device unless its entire I/O structure is changed, as we saw in 
the February column when we discussed the BAT: device assignment. 
This distinction is further reinforced by the fact that there's no way to 
test the status of the device via a Reader status function, suggesting that 
it was never expected that the Reader device would be called randomly, 
but rather, only when the operator or user program expected there to be 
data available. 

For our purposes, then, we can consider READER to be a function 
wherein characters are passed to a user program from some auxiliary pe- 
ripheral device as a means of gathering data from outside the comput- 
er's "normal" environment. In this way, READER is treated much more 
like a disk drive interface than a keyboard interface, with the exceptions 
that the input consists of single characters as opposed to blocks of data, 
and that, as far as BDOS is concerned, READER is an input-only 
device. 

The Digital Research criterion for the BIOS READER function is 
that each time it's called by BDOS, it will return in register [A] the next 
available character from the physical peripheral assigned to be the Read- 
er device (that is, the assigned physical device in the logical Reader cate- 
gory). The character must be a valid ASCII value (0 to 127), with the 
parity bit reset (zero). All physical peripheral devices to be included in the 
logical Reader device category for BDOS must be able to do input in the 
manner just described. This is the only criterion, and, consequently, it is 
reasonably easy to fulfill. 

There's one other concern with regard to the Reader category. This is 
not really a criterion for the device or for the routine servicing it but more 
a matter of data structure. This factor also helps to point up the differ- 
ence between the ways Console device input and Reader device input are 
treated. Since the Reader device is not really the main system input meth- 
od, the practice of scanning it continually for random input usually does 



APRIL 1983 



not apply. There must, therefore, be some method of telling a program 
using the Reader device that all characters in this collection have been 
transmitted, a condition usually called "end-of-file." 

When the end-of-file has been reached, a control-Z (1AH) should be 
returned in register [A] when BDOS makes its next call to the Reader de- 
vice. This character is the general CP/M end-of-file character and is used 
in all CP/M text files for that purpose. It must be understood, however, 
that this is not a function of the device or of the driver routine that oper- 
ates the device, since neither the device nor the driver routine can tell 
whether all the data in the collection has been transmitted. The end-of- 
file character must instead be part of the data that's being input. It is per- 
missible, however, to have a routine always return the end-of-file char- 
acter if there's no peripheral implemented as the Reader device (as we 
shall see), since this will at least keep the system from hanging. 

Once again, as a means of implementing more than one device, Mi- 
crosoft chose to use the IOBYTE when creating the logical Reader de- 
vice. Although up to four devices are allowed by Digital Research, Mi- 
crosoft decided to limit the possible number of physical devices to three; 
this was done for the sake of simplicity and because of the limited num- 
ber of peripheral slots on the Apple. The four physical devices defined by 
Digital Research are TTY:, PTR:, UR1:, and UR2:. Microsoft treats 
UR1 : and UR2: as the same physical device; consequently, we'll refer to 
them from now on as URx :. 

Of the three devices SoftCard supports, only two are specifically ori- 
ented to auxiliary physical devices. As mentioned in previous columns, 
the physical TTY: device is included as an option for all four of the logi- 
cal device categories in order to allow a common physical device to be as- 
signed to any form of input or output. Since the TTY: device must there- 
fore be capable of both input and output (to satisfy the requirements of 
its being assigned to the logical Console device), it is often implemented 
as the standard form of console I/O — the keyboard and video. This is, in 
fact, the case with SoftCard, and setting the logical Reader equal to 
TTY: has the effect of getting Reader input via the current keyboard. Re- 
member that this does not automatically mean the Apple keyboard, since 
the Console TTY: service routine is altered by BOOT to reflect the pres- 
ence or absence of a serial card or Apple Communications card (comm 
card) in slot 3. 

The two remaining devices, PTR: and URx:, are, on the other hand, 
designed solely for auxiliary input, with PTR: being the primary, prein- 
stalled device and URx: being a secondary, user-installed device. When 
the device structure of auxiliary I/O was devised, Microsoft decided to 
use slot 2 as the general-purpose I/O interface area, since the loose cus- 
tom that then existed in the Apple world reserved slot 1 primarily for 
printers and slot 3 for keyboard/terminal peripherals, leaving slot 2 pret- 
ty much untouched. The feeling was that the most common use for 
Reader input would be for modems or other types of intersystem com- 
munication, especially since this kind of communication lends itself to 
the character I/O type of data transfer. PTR:, then, is primarily de- 
signed to use a serial card or comm card in slot 2, interfaced by the user 
to a modem, another computer, or whatever. 

Now let's examine the actual routines involved in the Reader device 
implementation. As before with the Console input, when BDOS wants a 
character of Reader input, it calls an entry point in the BIOS jump table, 
in this case the eighth one. The entry is nothing more than a single in- 
struction, JP READER, where READER is the label of a general rou- 
tine to handle Reader device input. The READER routine is located at 
ODB87H in 56K (0AB87H in 44K). 

Like the other routines that use the IOBYTE, READER'S first ac- 
tivity is to load the IOBYTE value from its place at 0003H in the system 
data page. It then strips out the two bits that make up the READER 
field of the IOBYTE and decodes the value of these two bits by means of a 
single compare instruction. Since only the values of 0 (for TTY:), 1 (for 
PTR:), or greater than 1 (for URx:) have any significance, the routine 
compares the two-bit IOBYTE value to 1. In this way, if the current 
value is less than the comparitor, the carry flag will be set, and by testing 
the carry flag the routine knows that the TTY: device is in effect. 

If it turned out that the TTY: device was in effect, control would 
transfer to a routine called TTYIN at 0DB5EH, which is part of 
CNIN2, the CONIN subroutine we discussed in February. From this 



point, input would occur the same way whether we entered via CONIN 
or READER, so you can simply refer back to February's column if you 
wish to proceed further in the input process. 

If, on the other hand, the current value of the two-bit field of the 
IOBYTE had been 1, the carry flag would be clear but the zero flag 
would be set, indicating that the current value and the comparitor were 
equal. In this case, the routine would know that the physical PTR: de- 
vice was selected and would jump to a routine called RDRIN at 
0DB62H. (This routine was mentioned in February also, during our dis- 
cussion of the BAT: device assignment. RDRIN was the routine jumped 
to from CONIN if BAT: was in effect and all console input was to come 
from the Reader device.) 

RDRIN is a very simple routine, since its only function is to load a 
vector address from the I/O vector table in the IOCB and jump to that 
address. Before we proceed beyond this, however, we should note that, if 
the current IOBYTE field value had been 2 or 3 instead of 1, neither the 
carry flag nor the zero flag would have been set, and so neither of the 
jumps (to TTYIN or to RDRIN) would have taken place. Instead, a dif- 
ferent vector address would have been loaded from the vector table and a 
jump to that address would have been made. 

In our earlier discussions of the vector table, we learned that each of 
the logical devices making up character I/O has two vectors in the table; 
the exception is the Console device, which has four — two for console in- 
put and two for console output. We also learned that each routine cor- 
responds to a physical device, as in the case of console output, where 
Vector #1 corresponded to TTY:/CRT: and Vector #2 corresponded to 
UC1:. 

With the Reader device, the same basic structure exists, with Reader 
Input Vector #1 assigned to the PTR: device and Vector #2 assigned to 
the URx: device. As with the other logical devices, both of the Reader 
device vectors point to the same routine (that is, contain the same ad- 
dress) when SoftCard is shipped to the customer. Again, this is because 
Vector #2 is designed for a user-implemented device, so no routine exists 
for it. The address of the PTR: service routine is placed in it solely to

keep the system from hanging, should a user assign UR1 : or UR2: to the 
Reader device and call for input. 

Taking this information back to where we left off in the READER 
routine, we see that if control had proceeded to RDRIN to service the 
PTR: device, an address would have been loaded from Reader Input Vec- 
tor #1, while if the URx: device had been selected, the address would 
have been loaded from Vector #2. Unless you've altered the #2 vector 
yourself, both vectors will contain the same address; we'll examine 
it now. 

The address contained in both vectors is ODD45H, and the routine 
at that location is called RDRIN1. In purpose and appearance, RDRIN 1 
is very similar to the routine TTYIN1 , discussed in February. At that 
time, we said that general-purpose read routines existed for both serial 
and comm cards (called RSER and RCOM respectively). These rou- 
tines are considered general purpose since they do not look for the card in 
a specific slot every time but rather are designed to get the slot number 
from whatever routine calls them. The calling routines needing to use 
RSER or RCOM have only to load the slot number in question into the 
[DE] register pair and jump to the location of RSER or RCOM, de- 
pending on which kind of card you're dealing with. RDRIN1, then, as its 
first action, loads [DE] with a value of 2, since PTR: is set up to be a slot 
2 device. 

The next instruction in RDRIN 1 is a jump to either RSER or 
RCOM. Just like TTYIN1, RDRIN 1 has this address patched by the 
BOOT routine during system initialization, as soon as the type of card in 
slot 2 has been determined. The address starts out originally as 0000. 
BOOT examines the card-type byte found during the initial booting proc- 
ess. If a serial card is present, BOOT changes the address to 0DD1CH 
for RSER; if a comm card is present, BOOT changes the address to 
0DD12H for RCOM. 

Any other card, even if it is recognized by BOOT (as a parallel card 
would be, for example), is considered unreadable for input. In that case, 
BOOT replaces the jump instruction and its address with two complete- 
ly different instructions — a LDA,1AH and a RET. These two instruc- 
tions fulfill the Digital Research requirements by returning to BDOS 
with the end-of-file character in register [A], meaning that there is no 
more input. Consequently, unless the card you're using for the Reader 
device in slot 2 can perfectly imitate a serial or comm card, SoftCard 
won't recognize it as valid for input. 

If the card in slot 2 looks like a serial card or comm card but doesn't 
operate the same way, watch out! SoftCard will attempt to treat it in a 
manner appropriate to its appearance, which may cause some bizarre re- 
sults. Microsoft has prepared special driver routines for certain other 
cards in this category, such as the D.C. Hayes Micromodem and the 
SSM AIO card. A letter to Microsoft's technical support group will get 
you these patches should you need them. 

Since both RCOM and RSER return directly to BDOS, this com- 
pletes our coverage of the Reader device. Let's move on now to the 
Punch device. 

In speaking of the Punch device, Digital Research says, "The princi- 
pal tape-punching device, if it exists, is normally a high-speed paper tape 
punch or teletype." Once again, not many of us have teletypes, paper 
tape punches, or card punches connected to our systems. However, 
Punch can be just about any output device capable of accepting charac- 
ter data, one value at a time. The criterion for the Punch device service 
routine is very similar to that for the Reader device; that is, the routine 
must accept the character value in register [C], which will be in ASCII 
with the parity bit reset, and transmit it to the physical device assigned as 
the current logical Punch device. And that's all there is to it; if no pe- 
ripheral is implemented as the Punch device, the routine should simply 
return, having done nothing. 

The physical-to-logical Punch device assignment is also very similar 
to that of the Reader device. The four devices in this case are TTY:, 
PTP:, UP1 :, and UP2:. These correspond to IOBYTE field values of 0, 1, 
2, and 3 respectively. In this case as well, Microsoft chose to limit the 
number of devices to three. They combined UP1: and UP2:; again we'll 
use a convention (UPx:) to indicate this multiple device. 

The TTY: device is implemented by having the TTY:/CRT: portion 



of the Console output routines perform this function, as we'll see when 
we discuss the routines themselves. The PTP: device is implemented by 
means of a routine whose address is stored in the Punch Output Vector 
#1, and the UPx: device is implemented by means of a routine whose ad- 
dress is stored in Punch Output Vector #2. As with the other routines 
we've dealt with, both of these vectors point to the same routine origi- 
nally, for reasons already mentioned. 

Physical devices implemented as part of the logical Punch device will 
probably be the output portion of a corresponding Reader device; that is, 
PTP: may be the output portion of a modem, the input portion of which 
is PTR:. This is not always true; for example, Microsoft's technical sup- 
port group uses a card reader of the type that processes cards on which 
boxes have been blacked out with pencil marks. This device is incapable 
of creating cards or of handling any output beyond acknowledgement 
and other handshake-type signals, and therefore only the PTR: device is 
implemented. In such a case, PTP: is free to deal with something entirely 
unrelated — numerically controlled machinery, perhaps. 

In most cases, machine communication implies a bidirectional capa- 
bility, and devices that you may interface will probably affect both the 
Reader and Punch device assignments. Because of this, PTP:, as the pre- 
installed device, is designed to communicate with a card in slot 2 so that 
it can link up with the PTR: device. UPx:, since it's to be a user-installed 
device, has no such restriction. 

BDOS accesses the physical devices in the logical Punch group by 
calling the seventh entry point in the BIOS jump table, which simply con- 
tains the instruction JP PUNCH. The routine with that name is located 
at 0DB75H. In format it looks very much like the READER routine 
examined earlier, except it has a minor error, which we'll come to soon. 

Initially, PUNCH loads the IOBYTE value and strips its particular 
two-bit field out. By doing a compare with a value of 1 and checking for 
the carry flag, PUNCH can jump to the Console output's TTY: service 
routine if the carry flag is set. This is accomplished through a jump to the 
routine TTYOUT at 0DB96H, discussed in the March column. If you 
wish to know more about that routine, please refer to that issue. 

At this point, we come to the minor error in PUNCH. If the value of 
the two-bit IOBYTE field is 1, this indicates that the PTP: device is se- 
lected, and this device (as we've said) is implemented by Punch Output 
Vector #1 . A field value of 2 or 3 indicates the UPx: device and Vector 
#2. In the PUNCH routine, if no jump is made when the carry flag is 
tested, then Vector #1 is loaded as the default to jump to. At this junc- 
ture, if the result of the compare is zero, meaning that the value was 1, a 
jump to the address just loaded should occur. Instead, however, the jump 
is made if the result of the compare is nonzero, meaning that the 
IOBYTE field value is 2 or 3. In such a case, the UPx: device would be 
the selected one, but the jump would be made to the address in Vector 
#1 . Conversely, if it had been 1 , no jump would be made, the contents of 
Vector #2 would be loaded, and a jump would be made to that address. 
More simply stated, things are backward here: if PTP: is selected, the 
UPx: service routine is branched to, and if UPx: is selected, the PTP: ser- 
vice routine is branched to. This error seems more significant than it is. 
The reason it doesn't cause problems (in two years, we've not heard of 
any) is that the vectors are identical when the customer receives them, 
and it is rare that both PTP: and UPx: are implemented in the same 
system. 

Anyone wishing to fix this error can do so after the system is booted 
by changing the byte at 0DB81H (0AB81H in 44K) from a 20H to a 
28H. Changing it on a more permanent basis is somewhat more compli- 
cated; if you wish to do this, write in care of the magazine and we'll tell 
you how to go about it. One word of caution, however now that 
SoftCard has been in the field for some years, there's always the chance 
that software producers have tailored their products to such small varia- 
tions as this and that correcting the error would affect the operation of 
such products. Your best bet is to follow the rule that if you haven't had 
trouble with it, don't change it. 

In any case, no matter which vector is used, control now winds up at 
a routine called PUNOU1, located at 0DD3FH. Like RDRIN1, this 
routine consists only of loading the register pair [DE] with the value 2 for 
slot 2 and a jump to an address patched by BOOT. In the case of

APRIL 1983 



PUN0U1, however, BOOT can patch in not only the addresses of 
WSER and WCOM, the general-purpose write routines for serial and 
comm cards, but also the address of a routine called WPAR. 

As you've no doubt guessed, WPAR is a general-purpose write rou- 
tine for "Apple-standard parallel cards." The reason this phrase is in 
quotation marks is that, unlike with serial devices, for which there exists 
a definite and long-standing protocol (the RS-232 standard, to be exact), 
there is little standardization in the world of parallel devices. Indeed, 
most of the interfacing questions and problems in the early days of Soft- 
Card support by Microsoft concerned the different ways in which vari- 
ous manufacturers implemented parallel devices. 

For that reason, the WPAR routine was designed to implement a ba- 
sic parallel card of the type issued by Apple itself. No attempt was made 
to produce a universal parallel-card driver that would handle such di- 
verse peripheral cards as the D.C. Hayes modem card or the parallel por- 
tion of the SSM AIO board. It was considered better to interface these 
with special driver routines as they were encountered. 

WPAR, then, located at 0DD31H, uses the value in [DE] and a cal- 
culation subroutine to determine the page of memory dedicated to that 
board — that is, 0E«00H, where n = the slot number. Using the high- 
order byte of this address and the low-order byte 0C1H, the address of 
the status register on the parallel card is determined to be OE/zClH, or in 
the case of slot 2, 0E2C1H. This location is read repeatedly in a loop un- 
til the high-order bit of that location is set (1). When that occurs, the card 
is ready to accept a byte of data. 

The data register location is calculated using the slot value of [DE] 
also, but calculated to produce OEO«0H; n in this case is the slot num- 
ber plus 8. The data register for parallel cards, therefore, is seen to be in 
the sixteen-byte scratchpad space for that slot. The data register is in fact 
the first address of the sixteen available (or for slot 2 it is at 0E0A0H). 
When the card signals its readiness to accept a data byte, the character 
being sent to BDOS in register [C] is loaded into the data register, and 
control returns directly to BDOS. 



So, with that explanation, we have now examined both of the gener- 
al input routines and all three of the general output routines. In the fu- 
ture, we'll refer to them only by name, as we have done when talking 
about RSER, RCOM, WSER, and WCOM this month. 

Let's get back to our discussion of the Punch device. When we left off 
a moment ago, we were discussing the PUNOU1 routine; more specifi- 
cally, we were talking about BOOT'S alteration of the jump address dur- 
ing initialization. We now know that one of the three output addresses 
will be placed in the jump address field if a card is found. Unlike the 
RDRIN1 routine, BOOT does not alter the instructions themselves if no 
card is found. Rather, it simply leaves the address alone, since a default 
address of 0DD3EH is already there. As you may have guessed, this is 
the address of a simple RET instruction that just returns to BDOS with- 
out having done anything if no punch device has been installed. This, of 
course, is done to prevent the system from hanging or (worse yet) from 
doing indiscriminate memory alterations if no device is implemented. 

The final note we need to make on the Punch device routines con- 
cerns problems with the comm card write routine, WCOM. In March, 
when we spoke of comm cards used as terminal interfaces, we said that a 
patch had been installed in version 2.20B of the SoftCard BIOS 
CONOUT routine. Called OUTPAT, this correction routine is located 
in the patch area. Its job is to determine if a comm card is present in slot 
3 and, if so, to handle the write to it immediately (using a 6502 subrou- 
tine), thereby ignoring the remainder of the CONOUT routine, includ- 
ing WCOM. The reason for this is that the Z-80 processor, unlike the 
6502, does a preread of the contents of any memory location before it 
writes to it. 

In most cases this is not a problem. As a result of the communica- 
tions chip it contains, however, a comm card interprets this read access 
as the actual write of the data byte, and this causes the comm card to as- 
sume that the data register now contains valid data. It therefore pro- 
ceeds to transmit to the connected peripheral. Since the data has not yet 
been written into the register, however, the byte sent is whatever value 
the data register already contained. And now, since the chip is under the 
impression that it has already accepted a byte of data, it goes into not- 
ready state until the cycle of transmission is completed, meaning that the 
Z-80 is never able to write the correct byte into the card's data register. 

This error was addressed for Console output during the 2.20B cor- 
rections, but not for Punch output. Basically, the feeling was that while 
no chance could be taken with Console device I /O (since that would be 
required in order to do anything at all with the system), the fix to deal 
with a comm card in slot 2 was not mandatory. That being the case, it 
was decided that further complicating the patch procedure for 2.20B by 
having two such corrections would be an unnecessary risk. 

The same type of patch as OUTPAT can be created for the PTP: de- 
vice. It must be a filter-type patch, meaning that it checks for a condition 
(a comm card in slot 2); if the condition is not met, it lets the program 
flow filter through and continue on its normal route to the Punch rou- 
tines in the BIOS. If the condition is met, however, the patch must deal 
with the output itself, using the 6502 to do the actual write. Because of 
the detail required, not so much to create the patch but to describe the in- 
stallation of it, space won't be taken to demonstrate it right now. 

It's important to put what we've been talking about into perspective. 
Although there are two errors in the Punch device service routines, they 
are not terribly significant problems. Only if you are using a comm card 
(or some other device that can't tolerate a Z-80 preread) will you en- 
counter the error just dealt with. And the previous problem, the switch- 
ing of the Punch device vectors, will crop up only if you've implemented 
the UPx: device and have changed Vector #2 to point to your routine. 
The former problem is somewhat more difficult to fix, but it's also fairly 
easy to avoid. 

In this month's column, we've covered in some detail the Reader and 
Punch devices and their associated routines. These two devices are prob- 
ably the ones least used by SoftCard owners; nonetheless, they offer the 
easiest means by which to implement new peripherals. At some point in 
the future, after we've covered the BIOS internals to a satisfactory de- 
gree, we'll spend some time talking about interfacing to specific periph- 
erals, using these logical devices. Until next month. ...

The general public has indelicately dubbed 
them headhunters, but the appropriate handle, 
the dignified job title, says Ronald Dukes, is ex- 
ecutive recruiter. 

"We're not body snatchers," says Dukes in 
tones of injured professional pride. "We don't 
creep around in the night. I'm helping clients 
solve a problem. If they get the right person, 
you're talking bottom-line profits." 

The forty-year-old Dukes is a defender of 
the faith — a member of the Chicago headquar- 
ters staff of Heidrick & Struggles, one of the na- 
tion's top recruiting companies. Recruiters like 
Dukes are the employment pros who spot the 
fast-track up-and-comers, the men and women 
who fill middle and senior management posi- 
tions and pull salaries ranging from $60,000 to 
$350,000-plus. Theirs is a serious and highly 
competitive business, one that requires cool, 
confident professionalism. Here, first impres- 
sions are often lasting ones. 

Enter the VP Xs. Flashback to the late 
seventies. Dukes is working on one of his big- 
gest projects yet — finding the new top man for a 
major Midwest company. He's interviewing six- 
figure executive VPs who've made a career of 
making things happen. 

Candidate "X," one of the stellar pros- 
pects, arrives at Dukes's office. A picture of re- 
laxed control, Dukes wants to put the inter- 
viewee at ease. He offers his guest a seat and 



BY JONATHAN MILLER 

leans back confidently in his own, when sud- 
denly, diabolically, the chair gives way. Head 
over heels he tumbles, stacks of papers flying. 
Dukes, the unwitting king of slapstick ice- 
breakers, lands in an undignified heap on the 
office floor, feet straight up in the air. 

Yes, this executive recruiting can be a rough 
business, but collapsing chairs aren't among its 
everyday perils. Delayed airline flights, secretar- 
ies who insist you "state your business," and 
candidates who back out at the last moment are 
the daily devils. 

"Either you like recruiting or you hate it," 
says Dukes. "There are lots of telephone calls, 
lots of flying, interviewing at airports, working 
out of telephone booths. Just a helluva lot of 
hard work." 

Whatever its drawbacks, recruiting has its 
compensations. Top recruiters earn between 
$75,000 and $150,000 a year, their fees from 
client corporations representing a percentage 
(around 30 percent) of an exec's first-year sal- 
ary and expected bonuses. The work may be 
hard, but it's a spiritual tonic for nomads like 
Dukes. "I don't want to be stuck behind a 
desk," says the former Vietnam infantry 
captain. 

Dukes figures he's on the road roughly a 
third of the time, but the challenge and involve- 
ment of the job help ease the strain of being 
away from kith and kin back in the Chicago 



suburb of Buffalo Falls. 

Deadeye Dukes. A recruiter is a match- 
maker and a troubleshooter. He gets the call 
when a company finally wakes up to the fact 
that the problem in the manufacturing division 
is the person in charge. Not equipment, not 
systems, but complex, quirky people. Dukes has 
to understand what clients want — and they 
don't always know or spell it out — and then size 
up scores of potential candidates who all tend 
to look the part — articulate, well-groomed, 
enthusiastic. 

You don't have to have a Ph.D. from Har- 
vard to be a recruiter, but you do have to have a 
feel for and fascination with people, for the text 
and subtext of human interaction. Does the 
client actually want an aggressive, independent 
individual who'll come in and make changes, or 
is he really saying he wants someone who'll toe 
the line? 

"Personal styles must mesh," says Dukes. 
"Some people are hard to work for; they may 
be browbeaters, and you have to find out. Does 
the person you're interviewing have the will to 
do the job? You have to distill the essence of 
what the client wants and what the candidate 
can contribute." 

And then, you have to put it all down on pa- 
per, faithfully describing a stranger to the client 
in a three to four-page narrative. Dukes used to

like dictating and, at the time, didn't like typ- 
ing — but that all changed circa 1980. That's 
when, as Dukes puts it, he kind of fell into com- 
puters, into CP/M, and finally into WordStar, 
the so-called Cadillac of word processors. 

The Dukes of Missouri. Dukes was never 
much good at math or science when he was hit- 
ting the books in his native Saint Louis, but he's 
always liked to be on top of things. And three 
years ago computers were rising to the top. 

"For some reason, I just had it in the back 
of my mind that I wanted to learn more about 
them." That eventually led him to the friendly 
folks at Data Domain, his one and only com- 
puter store. Like Dukes with his clients, they've 
made it a point to know their customers well — 
and for the same reason: the development of a 
long-term relationship. 

When Dukes purchased his Apple II (he has 
since traded up to a III), WordStar was his 
word processor of choice. 

"At the time, there wasn't any word proces- 
sor that came close to WordStar" says Dukes, 
"and I immediately fell in love with it when I got 
my eighty-column card." 

A complex program written in assembly 
language, WordStar, from MicroPro Interna- 
tional, actually consists of four linked pro- 
grams that together occupy close to 80K of 
memory. Despite its size, it has been designed to 
run with a minimum of 32K and one disk drive, 
a neat trick accomplished through a bit of shuf- 
fling known as "program overlays." Only a pro- 
gram core resides in memory at loading. When 
a user wants to execute a special function, such 
as underlining or search and replace, the pro- 
gram toggles to disk and overlays the appropri- 
ate program segment. 

For all intents and purposes, what you see 
on-screen is what will print with WordStar. 
What the monitor displays is virtually identical 
to the finished product. Dashed lines indicate 
page breaks. Left and right margins and line 
spacing changes — single, double, or triple — are 
also shown, while a status line at the top of the 
screen reports file name, page, line, and file 
number. 

WordStar supports various printers (in- 
cluding Diablo, NEC, and Qume), along with 
serial terminals and memory-mapped video 
boards. The manual provides the code neces- 
sary to customize the system to various ter- 
minals and printers. 

Double and Triple Shots of Command. 
WordStar operates on two command levels. 
The primary level consists of double and triple 
keystroke commands, referenced at the top of 
the screen in highlighted and modifiable help 
menus. As users familiarize themselves with the 
program, they can all but eliminate the menus, 
thereby increasing the available text display 
area. 

WordStar also features a second tier of dot 
or embedded printer commands, which are dis- 
played but not printed. They govern a number 
of printing options, such as line spacing, paper 
length, top and bottom margins, header and 
footer locations, conditional page breaks, char- 
acter width (pitch), page numbers, and the like. 



In working with WordStar, Dukes has yet 
to employ an embedded command. Primarily, 
he uses the program to compose rough drafts of 
his candidate reports. Like many WordStar 
owners, Dukes employs only a fraction of the 
program's features, which include deletions in 
either direction either by character, word, or 
line; vertical and horizontal scrolling, either line 
by line or in segments; word-wrap and justifica- 
tion options; relocation of copy blocks with the 
option of deleting or retaining the block at its 
original location; backward and forward 
searches with the option of ignoring distinc- 
tions between upper and lower case; underscor- 
ing of words, not spaces, along with boldfac- 
ing, double-striking, overstriking (printing one 
character on top of another), subscripting, and 
superscripting; automatic creation of backup 
copies; and a print spooler allowing the user to 
edit one file while printing another. 

Manual Override. Complex programs be- 
get complex manuals, and by Dukes's lights 
WordStars is horrendous. So complicated, in 
fact, that he's never read through it. He gets by 
with a little bit of help from the menus and his 
copy of the more readable publication, Word- 
Star Made Easy. Where he feels assistance is 
sorely lacking is in the customer support de- 
partment. MicroPro fields retailer inquiries but 
not those of end users, and Dukes doesn't re- 
gard that as inspired public relations. 

Though Dukes doesn't care for MicroPro's 
support policies, he's very pleased with its prod- 
uct and the CP/M operating system, though he 
has one reservation about the latter. A year ago, 
Dukes traded up to an Apple III. It can sup- 
port 256K, but standard CP/M effectively 
limits Dukes to 64K. "That's not a drawback of 
WordStar," he emphasizes, "but of CP/M." As 
it is, though, it's not a critical issue, because 
Dukes doesn't generate large files. 

So overall he's very pleased. A split screen 
and a larger memory capacity would be nice, he 
allows, but he doesn't need it. What he did need 
was something that would enable him to gather 
his thoughts after an interview, and WordStar 
has more than satisfied that requirement. It's 
also worked a subtle transformation in his writ- 
ing, making it a lot easier and more fun. His 
presentations also seem more creative and 
structured. 

"I just find it a lot easier to sit down at the 
computer and start typing," he explains. "As I 
go, even though I'm wordy, I can easily go back 
and change it, which saves time and helps me 
compose a lot better." 

People who think executive recruiters are 
high-level employment counselors would prob- 
ably also believe a recession would boost busi- 
ness. They'd be wrong on both counts. 

Unlike employment counselors, executive 
recruiters like Dukes don't usually work on a 
contingency basis. They earn their fees by con- 
ducting long-term searches even if the client ulti- 
mately rejects their candidates. The prolonged 
recession has flattened business but has not 
killed it. "People are still moving, particularly at 
the high level," says Dukes. "The economy is 
not a big factor with eighty to one-hundred-

thousand-a-year executives." 

The Boss Was a Rolling Stone. The big fac- 
tor for executives is what Dukes calls "a com- 
pelling need to move." A difficult boss or a 
blocked career path are the commonest prods, 
greater challenge and individual satisfaction the 
major lures. Money, interestingly enough, is 
rarely a top priority, says Dukes, adding, "The 
guy with the super boss, who's paid well and 
sees opportunity in his present job, is difficult to 
recruit." 

But nearly everybody will hear you out. 
When Ron Dukes and other recruiters call, ex- 
ecutives listen. Whether they're bona fide or 
would-be prospects, they willingly exchange in- 
formation, because today's contact could be to-

morrow's candidate. "We know the insides of 
most companies," says Dukes. "We know what 
their problems are — what their people prob- 
lems are." 

They know, but they keep it in strictest con- 
fidence, says Dukes. Discretion is the better part 
of recruiting, whether dealing with a client, a 
prospect, or a source, which is why the business 
traditionally maintains a low profile. When peo- 
ple ask Dukes what he does, he's purposely 
vague. "Consulting," he'll say. If they knew 
more, they'd be hustling him for a job, com- 
promising his objectivity and client relation- 
ships. 

"It's difficult to explain to people that I 
work for client companies, not individuals,

without turning them off. Many of my friends 
and associates don't understand what I do and 
that's fine with me." 

Nonlinear Recruiters. What makes a top 
recruiter? Someone who is eclectic, not linear, it 
would appear. Someone with a feel for indus- 
tries as a whole, for the functional interrela- 
tionships among manufacturing, sales, and 
marketing divisions, according to Dukes. A 
client may say he wants a candidate with such 
and such educational background and sales ex- 
perience from the hi-tech industry, say, but the 
right one, in terms of personality, moxie, and 
ambition, may be champing at the bit in a big 
oil company. "That's why I tend to be a little 
concerned when clients appear to be too rigid," 
says Dukes. 

Dukes believes career history determines fu- 
ture performance by and large. When he inter- 
views prospects and composes his WordStar 
candidate reports, he's trying to discern and 
communicate the essential pattern. Do the ca- 
reer moves, or the lack thereof, indicate a win- 
ner, or another guy who's going to drop the 
ball? 

"Many times, candidates swamp you with 
lots of extraneous information," says Dukes. 
"I'm only interested in whether the person can 
do the job. That they got an MBA from Stan- 



Olivieri's Outline 
of 

Word Processors 

by Peter Olivieri 



We've looked at quite a few word process- 
ing packages over the last few months. Each 
program so far has had its own special features, 
advantages, and disadvantages. The ones we'll 
look at this month are no exception. 
PowerText, Beaman Porter, Pleasant Ridge 
Road, Harrison, NY 10528; (914) 967-3504. 
Complete Apple II system (no Pascal required) 
$299; with PowerCase chip (for lower-case ca- 
pability), $329.95. For Apple II and III owners 
who already have Apple Pascal, $199. 
Equipment required Apple II, He, or III with 
64K; monitor; two disk drives; printer. Apple 
III version requires Apple Pascal. 

PowerText is both unique and powerful — 
unique in that it approaches the word process- 
ing task in a somewhat different manner than 
many of its competitors, and powerful in that it 
offers a good deal more than the typical word 
processing package. Let's look first at the way 
PowerText approaches word processing and 
then consider some of its particular features. 

The program documentation describes Pow- 
erText as a program that "shapes" your text in- 
to the form you want. This description is par-

ford or Harvard is fine, but that might not be as 
relevant as what they've done lately in the R&D 
area, say, when I'm looking for a manager of 
engineering." 

What ages recruiters prematurely is that 
finding the right person may not be enough. 
Dukes can gather all the data, conduct his in- 
terviews, and hammer out his WordStar sum- 
maries, but success is governed by matters be- 
yond his control. Clients who forget to men- 
tion that they don't like people who smoke 
pipes or sport mustaches. Spouses of prospects 
who decide, at the eleventh hour, that they'd 
rather stay in Cleveland. And then there's the 
bolt from the blue. 

"Clients will sometimes tell you they want 
somebody with XYZ background and then find 
someone on their own who's totally opposite," 
says Dukes. "It's happened numerous times." 

Such surprises frustrate many, but Dukes, a 
man who describes his military experiences as 
the best three years of his life, is reassured by 
them. 

"For some reason," he says of clients who 
go against their own specs, "they liked the indi- 
vidual. He fit. In the final analysis, it turned out 
to be the person. It's not a matter, if I may say 
so, of computers or numbers. It's individuals 
who make the difference." 

ticularly appropriate. PowerTexfs "format-file 
module" allows you to define formats for the 
kinds of documents you create fairly often. 
Once these basic formats have been defined, 
you can ask PowerText to "shape" the text 
you've just finished working on into whatever 
format you name. 

The document format can be used to specify 
the format of a paper, a market report, or a 
business proposal; the letter format provides a 
customized style for business letters; the per- 
sonal format is for setting up personal letters; 
and the memo format, as you could probably 
guess, describes how a company memo might 
look. The landscape format refers to a 132-col- 
um-wide page, and the standard format indi- 
cates a blank page with no headers or footers. 
Once you've defined these formats, they can be 
saved to your system and easily recalled. 

The editor module permits you to enter new 
text; to change, delete, or move text; and to 
copy text into your document from another 
disk file. It allows you to search and replace 
both forward and backward and to scroll by 
screen or by page. The editor also provides 
automatic word wrap, a type-ahead buffer, and 
a "paint mode" that can be used to create dia- 
grams containing vertical and horizontal lines 
(boxes, for instance). 

Most of the editing commands are single- 
letter commands, and the letters usually relate 
to the functions being performed. For example, 
when you're in the editor, B moves you to the 
beginning of a line, and P moves you to the next 
page in the document. This editor is disk- 
based — that is, files are stored on disk and only 
a portion of the file you're working on resides in 
memory at any one time. 

PowerTexfs editor always maintains a

backup copy of any file you're editing. This is a 
nice safety feature, but it also limits file size to 
one-half of a disk. (Of course, with two disk 
drives you can create and edit larger files.) 

This is one of the most powerful editors 
we've seen. And, like most editors, it's not al- 
ways simple to operate. This system is not real- 
ly "menu-driven" in the user-friendly sense of 
the word. As you become more familiar with 
the way the commands work, however, you'll 
see that a system such as this offers a good deal 
more than the typical menu-driven system. 

Fortunately, the PowerText manual is 
well written and easy to read. Each chapter be- 
gins with a description of the objectives for that 
chapter. The manual's not fast reading, and 
there are no illustrations to help clarify the vari- 
ous features being described. Yet, by moving 
along through the manual, you can become a 
very knowledgeable user of the system. 

PowerText has some unique features worth 
mentioning. To begin with, you never have to 
set margins with this word processor. Instead 
you use "style files" to describe the detailed lay- 
out of your correspondence and other writing. 
Addresses can be printed on your envelopes as 
well as in the texts of your letters. 

Subscripting, superscripting, boldface print- 
ing, extended printing, and underlining are all 
supported. Pages are numbered automatically 
and page breaks are carefully monitored by the 
system. PowerText won't leave a dangling line 
at the top of a new page or start a new heading 
as the last line on the current page. And when 
you create papers and reports, a table of con- 
tents can be produced automatically. 

There's more. You can "suspend" editing 
on one file and examine or edit another. You 
can even extract information from the second 
file and add it to the list. A utility supplied with 
PowerText gives you the ability to format disks, 
erase disks, examine disks for bad blocks, and 
list disk directories. 

PowerText also offers the user the ability to 
prepare reports in columnar format, with up to 
fourteen columns per 1 32-character line. Hori- 
zontal space can be divided into vertical col- 
umns with the relative width proportions you 
specify, and you can even right-justify, left-jus- 
tify, or center each column. This provides an 
unusual amount of flexibility in document 
preparation. 

The ability to create a wide variety of docu- 
ments quite easily is one of the major strengths 
of this package. Supplied with the program 
documentation are some sample documents 
prepared using PowerText. Among these are a 
table of contents, a page from a screenplay (this 
is impressive — the formatting requirements for 
such documents are very particular), a sample 
page from a movie script, some letters and re- 
ports, and a "calendar" printed in the boxed 
format so typical of many appointment books. 
These sample documents communicate, more 
appropriately than any promotional literature 
could, exactly what this package can do. 

Indeed, some users will not like the ap- 
proach PowerText takes with regard to the 
word processing task. In particular, some users 



are very uncomfortable with word processors 
that don't allow them to see on-screen exactly 
what their final document will look like. Power- 
Text won't show it to you; what it will do is 
shape the document properly so that you have 
no need to view it. Nevertheless, the inability to 
see the "final version" on-screen before print- 
ing will be considered a drawback to some. In 
addition, the fact that this is a Pascal-based sys- 
tem may matter to others. 

Ultimately, you must weigh your own par- 
ticular needs (do your homework) before de- 
ciding which package is right for you. Some 
word processors are easier to use than Power- 
Text. Some may be learned in a shorter period 
of time. But it's unlikely that you'll find very 
many word processors that are as powerful as 
this one. 

A few final notes. PowerText is not copy- 
protected and users are encouraged to make 
backups. The program comes with a five-year 
warranty. If it fails to perform as specified, it 
will be fixed at no charge. Now that is unusual. 
In addition, you can call Beaman Porter direct- 
ly if you need assistance. Company personnel 
are prompt, courteous, and most helpful. 
Apple Writer III, Apple Computer, 20525 
Mariani Avenue, Cupertino, CA 95014; (408) 
966-1010. 

Equipment required: 128K Apple III, monitor, 
printer. Suggested: Have your Apple III own- 
er's manual and the Standard Device Drivers 
Manual nearby. 

Apple Writer III is an excellent word proc- 
essing package. Let's look now at its features 
and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. 

Apple Writer III enables the user to create 
letters, reports, and manuscripts and to print 
out these documents using a wide variety of for- 
matting options. The program can also be used 
to design and print form letters in which names 
and addresses are inserted automatically dur- 
ing printing, and to create one's own programs 
for carrying out complex word processing 
tasks. 

It's easy to insert, delete, or change charac- 
ters, words, lines, or whole sections within a 
document using Apple Writer III. In addition, 
certain keys can be defined to represent words 
or phrases that would otherwise be time-con- 
suming or difficult to type. 

Once the program's up and running, you can 
load or save a file, erase a file from memory, ac- 
cept SOS commands, give print program com- 
mands, or go to a submenu of additional func- 
tions. Simply pressing return gets you a blank 
screen on which to begin typing your docu- 
ment. Actually, the screen is not quite blank — 
there's a data line at the top that displays infor- 
mation about what line and character you are at 
and how much memory for your file remains. 
This display can be eliminated from the screen 
(or reinstated) by pressing escape. 

Moving the cursor in Apple Writer III is 
done by pressing the arrow keys (remember that 
the Apple III keyboard has four of them). 
Holding down the shift key as you depress an 
arrow key causes the cursor to move more 
rapidly (by characters, twenty-four at a time, or

by lines, twelve at a time). Control-B moves you 
to the beginning of your document and con- 
trol-E moves you to the end of it. Using the left 
arrow and the control key together deletes char- 
acters; pressing the right arrow in combination 
with control reinstates the last 128 characters (a 
useful feature when you wish to move small 
amounts of text around within a document). 

To insert new text, you simply position the 
cursor where you want the text to go and begin 
typing. As you'd expect, word wrap is automa- 
tic. It can be turned off, however, by pressing 
control-Z; that's a useful option, especially 
handy when you wish to arrange information in 
columns. 

Saving a document is a relatively simple 
process. Pressing control-S saves the entire con- 
tents of memory to disk. It's also possible to 
save to disk only a portion of what's in mem- 
ory or to add a text segment to an already exist- 
ing disk file. The ability to see a catalog listing 
of your disk files before you name the docu- 
ment you wish to save is a nice feature. 

The loading process is just as flexible. You 
can load an entire document, a segment of a 
document, or all portions of a document that 
contain a certain segment of text. It's even pos- 
sible to display a file on-screen without loading 
it into memory (and thereby overwriting what's 
in memory). This allows you to review the con- 
tents of a document before you actually 
load it. 

SOS. Pressing control-O calls up the SOS 
commands menu. From here, you can catalog 
your disk, rename a document, lock or unlock a 
document, delete a document, set the system 
date and time, or name a disk drive as the de- 
fault for all future commands. 

More Functions. Pressing control-Q causes 
the additional functions menu to appear. From 
here, you can set tab stops, save a file of tab set- 
tings, observe where carriage returns are lo- 
cated in a document, and do underlining. 
Further editing capacities that facilitate inser- 
tion and deletion of material on a word-by- 
word or paragraph basis are also available. 

Apple Writer Iirs find feature can be used 
to find text or to find text and replace it with 
something else automatically or after confirma- 
tion. It can also be used to find text and replace 
it with nothing at all (an unusual but useful fea- 
ture). In addition, it's possible to use wild-card 
entries in order to select items of interest more 
carefully. 

Apple Writer HI also offers a powerful glos- 
sary feature. To create a glossary item, you 
enter the glossary (control-G) and then type any 
letter from the keyboard, followed by a string of 
text. That particular glossary item is now 
"hidden" behind that particular key. All but 
two keys on the keyboard can be used in the 
creation of glossary entries, and upper and 
lower case letters are counted as different keys. 
There is a limitation to this feature, however; it 
concerns the total combined length of all glos- 
sary items, which cannot exceed 2,048 charac- 
ters. Whenever you want to use a glossary item 
within a word processing document, you just 
press control-G followed by the letter key under 



which it's filed. Glossary lists can be saved, re- 
trieved, and displayed. 

Some Special Features. Apple Writer HI 
offers some particularly unusual word process- 
ing features. These include a case command, a 
jump command, a split-screen command, and a 
command that allows the entry of control char- 
acters in text. The case command (control-C) 
changes the case of all characters you pass over 
with the cursor from upper case to lower case or 
vice versa. The jump command (control-J) 
jumps quickly to the position of the word you 
choose. The split-screen command (control-Y) 
splits the screen into two independent twelve- 
line displays. The cursor can be placed in either 



text window and you can then work in all the 
normal ways on the text contained there. The 
command for entering control characters in text 
(control-V) facilitates Apple Writer IIPs inter- 
face with various printers by allowing you to 
enter the necessary control characters for bold- 
face, compressed print, superscripts, subscripts, 
and so on. 

Apple Writer III also offers alternate type 
styles; five character sets are available, includ- 
ing gothic and inverse.

siderations in evaluating a word processing pro- 
gram concerns how the final printed document 
will look. Margin settings, paragraph indenta-

tion, top and bottom margins, page-number 
location, number of lines per page, line spac- 
ing, running heads and feet, and justification 
can all be chosen from the print-control menu. 
It's also possible to embed text-formatting com- 
mands within the text. There's also a query fea- 
ture within the print procedure. This enables 
you to specify that printing should be halted at 
a particular point and that a message should be 
displayed on-screen; printing resumes when the 
user takes the appropriate, specified action. 

Word Processing Programming. Finally, 
we come to a truly unique feature of this pack- 
age — Apple Writer III has its own word proc- 
essing language (WPL), which can be used to 
write programs that interface with the word 
processor portion of Apple Writer III. For ex- 
ample, instead of entering text editor and print 
commands from the keyboard, you could write 
a computer program that would do this for you. 
In this way, you could automate the form letter 
printing process and other activities. Unfor- 
tunately, the section of the user guide that dis- 
cusses how to use WPL is not at all clear. Prior 
programming experience will help you here, but 
not much. You are provided with lots of exam- 
ples, both in text and on an accompanying disk. 

Program Strengths. Apple Writer III is a 
very thorough program and it is particularly 
easy to use. Since commands usually begin with 
a letter that corresponds in some way to the 
function you're trying to accomplish, they're 
fairly easy to remember. The special character- 
istics of the Apple III are also used to advan- 
tage in this program. In addition, Apple Writer 
II files can be transferred into this program 
(and, of course, the Apple Writer III files you 
generate can be transferred in turn into Apple 
Writer II). 

Program Weaknesses. As mentioned 
earlier, the word processing language feature is 
quite nice but relatively difficult to learn. The 
portions of the manual devoted to this topic 
could have been a good deal clearer. In addi- 
tion, it would have been helpful if the program 
manual had been indexed; it can be frustrating 
not to have an index when you want to refer 
back to something in the manual and you can't 
remember exactly where you read it. 

Apple Writer IITs most serious drawback is 
the fact that you can't see on-screen actual ver- 
sions of what the pages of your document will 
look like when printed. And speaking of print- 
ing, it's not easy to get a printout of a single 
page from a multipage document. In addition, 
some users have had a great deal of trouble 
sending the proper characters to their printers 
for underlining, subscripts, and superscripts. 
(Some reader-supplied solutions to these prob- 
lems will appear in an upcoming Mind Your 
Business installment; if you're an Apple III user, 
or a potential user, keep an eye out for that 
column.) 

All in all, the Apple Writer III owners we've 
heard from indicate a very high level of satis- 
faction with this product. If you're an Apple III 
owner and you're looking for a word proces- 
sor, you'll probably want to give this one care- 
ful consideration.

Everyone's Guide to Assembly Language, Part 31 



This month's article starts a discussion on how to write your own hi- 
res character generator, and thus how to use text on the hi-res screen in 
your own machine language programs. 

The discussion will cover a number of points. First, we'll look at the 
memory mapping of the hi-res screen to see what considerations must be 
made to put the data for the appropriate characters on the screen. 

Next, we'll look at the code needed to intercept the characters being 
output to the normal text screen, and how this information can be used 
to actually implement the hi-res character generator. 

Last of all, a listing for a character editor will be presented, so you 
can make up your own character sets, or even produce special charac- 
ters for unusual graphics effects. 

Hi-Res Screen Mapping. The first consideration in creating our 
character generator is the topic of what actually will be required to put a 
character on the hi-res screen. In previous issues we have seen how each 
dot on the graphics screen is related to an individual bit within a byte of 
memory assigned to the hi-res display. In earlier routines we created 
graphics by plotting dots using the routines built into Applesoft Basic. 
This time the approach will be somewhat different. 

To create a character on the screen, an entire array of dots will have 
to be turned on. Although the hplot routines of Applesoft could be used, 
it turns out there is a much simpler way to achieve the desired result. This 
method is based on similarities between the normal text display page and 
the hi-res graphics display page. To fully understand this technique, 
though, a brief overview of the screen memory mapping will be required. 



The Text Display Screen. On the Apple, text display is normally 
confined to what is called text display page 1 . This display corresponds to 
a block of memory in the address range $400 to $7FF (1024 to 2047 deci- 
mal). A character is printed on the screen by storing a single byte in this 
memory range. The computer hardware then takes care of converting 
this stored character into a video image on your monitor or television set. 

The memory for the screen display is not mapped in a simple, con- 
tinuous pattern. That is to say, if you were to fill memory sequentially 
with a certain value, the screen image would not be changed in a line-by- 
line, character-by-character pattern. Instead, a rather unusual pattern 
would be followed. Table 1 gives the address of the first character on 
each line on the normal text display page. You may also wish to look at 
page 16 of the Apple II Reference Manual for a more complete chart. 

You may recall from earlier issues that it was not necessary to calcu- 
late the beginning address (sometimes called the base address) of each line 
ourselves. Instead, we can use a routine that already exists in the Moni- 
tor at SFC22 called VTAB. 

When this routine is called, it takes the value stored in location $24 
(called CV for cursor vertical position) and calculates the base address of 
the line corresponding to that vertical position. CV is assumed to be in 
the range of $0 to $17 (0 to 23 decimal) when VTAB is called. 

This is what COUT ($FDED) does whenever the cursor moves to a 
new line, such as when return is pressed, or when a vtab command in Ba- 
sic is done. The base address is returned in a zero-page pointer called 
BASL,BASH ($28,29 = base address low byte and high byte). 



The hi-res screen map is broken down to 
correspond to the layout of the text screen 
map. Note that the hi-res screen line 
numbers (on the left in figure 1) are equal to 
the equivalent text screen line numbers 
(table 1) plus $1000.

APRIL 1983 



To determine the final address to print to, the value in CH (cursor 
horizontal position) is put in the Y register, and an STA (BASL),Y is 
done. 

How does all this relate to the hi-res display? Well, let's look at a 
similar memory list for the hi-res page. See figure 1 on the previous page 
for a map of the memory layout of page 1 of the hi-res display. 

At first glance, there may seem to be too few horizontal rows to repre- 
sent all 192 lines. However, if you look at the right-hand side of the chart, 
you'll see a blow-up of one box of the map. Each of eight lines within the 
box is labeled with one of eight values. What this means is that each box 
on the main chart actually represents eight screen lines on the display. 
Twenty-four boxes times eight lines in each box gives us the total of 192 
screen lines. To find the base address of the third screen line, for instance, 
you would add the correction for the third line within a box ($800) to the 
base address for the primary box ($2000) to get the actual base address 
($2800). 

Looking at the horizontal columns, you'll notice that there are forty 
bytes that make up the 280 horizontal dot positions. Seven bits in each 
byte are used to map the screen dots (7 X 40 = 280). 

At this point you may be getting discouraged thinking that a lot of 
complicated calculations are going to be required to even begin to know 
where to start drawing our character on-screen. Take heart, though! If 
you give it a little thought, you should be able to see a remarkable simi- 
larity between the hi-res page and the text page in regards to their mem- 
ory mapping. 

The first similarity is in the number of bytes used for each horizontal 
line on the screen. In each case, forty bytes are used for an entire line. 
Could there be even more similarity? Read on! 

If you look at the first four lines of the text page, the base addresses 
are the values $400, $480, $500, and $580. If you examine the first four 
blocks of eight lines each on the hi-res screen, the base addresses are 
$2000, $2080, $2100, and $2180. 

You'll notice that if you add the value $1C00 to each of the text 
screen values, you'll get the corresponding base address for the hi-res 
screen. This pattern continues throughout all twenty-four text screen 
lines. 

What about the eight lines for each block? Each successive line with- 
in a block can be calculated by adding the value $400 to the address for 
the line above it. This will turn out to be just perfect for creating a 
character. 

As it happens, a character on the normal text screen is made up of 
dots in a matrix seven dots high by five dots wide. Around this matrix, 
there is a boundary of one dot position on either side, and one dot posi- 
tion along the bottom. This permanently empty region is set up to pro- 
vide the guaranteed separation between characters when printed on- 
screen. Thus, the final matrix is actually seven dots wide by eight dots 
high. Figure 2, for example, shows the matrix pattern for the letter A. 

A column of dot positions on each side of the character and a row on 
the bottom are left open. At this point, the little light in your mind is 
probably starting to glow. The seven dot positions across each character 
can correspond to seven bits in each of the forty hi-res screen bytes used 
on each line. The eight horizontal rows will correspond to the eight bytes 
assigned to each primary box described earlier. 

All this, then, brings us to the precipice. It is time to make the mental 
leap to understanding the concept of how a hi-res character will be 
created. 

In a block of eight sequential bytes of memory, we can store all the 



information needed to create a single character on the screen. Each byte 
will correspond to one of the eight rows in the matrix. Each bit within a 
byte will correspond to one possible dot position within a given row. 

For example, to encode the letter A, we might store the following 
bytes: $08,$14,$22,$22,$3C,$22,$22,$00. 

To illustrate how this really forms the letter A, take a look at table 2, 
which shows these same numbers ir; a different way:

Table 2. 



Figure 2. Dot matrix for A. 



In the right-hand column is the binary form of each number. You 
can see which bits are on and which are off. This relates directly to how 
the character is displayed on-screen. The bits are plotted in reverse or- 
der — that is, with bit 0 in the leftmost position. Bit 7 (the high bit) is nev- 
er displayed on-screen. At most, bit 7 can be used only to shift the other 
dots one half position. See the earlier articles on hi-res plotting if you 
need a little refresher in this area. 

The Character Generator. Now to actually describe the character 
generator that will be used to put the appropriate ASCII character on the 
hi-res screen. 

The process it will use will be as follows: 

1 . A routine will be hooked up to the output vector to intercept each 
character to be printed to the normal text screen. 

2. If the character is a control character, no special processing will be 
done and the character will be passed on to COUT1 ($FDF0). 

3. If the character is not a control character, an examination of the 
vertical cursor position (CV = $23) and the current text page address will 
be made. A value of $1C00 will be added to BASL,BASH ($28,29) to cal- 
culate the base address of the primary hi-res screen line. The contents of 
CH ($22 = cursor horizontal position) will then be added to this base ad- 
dress to calculate the actual byte on the hi-res screen to be modified. 

4. The ASCII value of the character to be printed will be used to de- 
termine the position in a character data table from which the eight bytes 
containing the data for the character will be retrieved. The position can 
be determined by first subtracting thirty-two from the ASCII value (to 
make up for the missing control characters in the table). The resulting 
value is then multiplied by eight (for eight bytes per character) to deter- 
mine the correct starting position of the data for that particular charac- 
ter. The general formula, then, is: 

Position = (ASCII value - 32) * 8 

5. The character will actually be produced by storing the first byte in 
the calculated address. The next seven bytes will then be stored by suc- 
cessively adding the value $400 to the base address and storing the next 
byte. This process will be repeated until all eight bytes have been stored 
in the hi-res screen memory. 

6. At that point the printing to the hi-res screen will be complete. 
The original character to be printed will then be sent to COUT1 
($FDF0) so that the Monitor routines can handle carriage returns, back- 
spaces, and so on. This action by the Monitor will automatically ensure 
that the BASL,BASH pair is maintained properly so that we can always 
rely on its accuracy in positioning the text output on the screen. 

This last point may need a bit of explanation. If we never sent a char- 
acter to COUT1, we would have to handle the entire screen manage- 
ment ourselves. This means when we got to the end of the line, we would 
have to detect it, and advance CV and recalculate BASL.BASH accord- 
ingly. By passing each character to COUTl (even though technically we 
never see the text screen), the Monitor will keep BASL, BASH, CH, and 
CV all maintained in a way consistent with the data printed to the screen. 

Thus all we need to do is look at BASL, BASH, CH, and CV for each 
character printed to have the hi-res screen properly mimic what is going

COUT1 





The routine is relatively short and is placed at location $300 (768 
decimal). When a call to $300 is done by either a 300G from the Moni- 
tor or a call 768 from Basic, the routine will set the output vectors to 
point to ENTRY and then call the DOS hookup routine described in 
earlier issues. At this point, all future character output will pass through 
this routine, until it is disconnected either by a PR#0 or by pressing reset. 

At ENTRY, the first thing that is checked for is to see if the charac- 
ter being output is a control character. Remember that at this point the 
high bit will be set on all text going to the screen. Therefore, even though 
$20 is the more normal ASCII value for a space character, with the high 
bit set, it will be sent through COUT as an $A0. 

If a control character is detected here, the CMP and BCC will pass 
control to the exit point of the routine, OUT. Remember that BBC is 
used to detect all values in the accumulator less than the value used in the 
CMP instruction. All control characters will have an ASCII value less 
than that of the space character. 

If the character is a noncontrol character, it's then pushed onto the 
stack in line 25. This is to save the character to be printed so that it can 
eventually be passed on to COUT1. The next line, 26, then clears the 
high bit of the character and stores the resulting value in POSN. 

This resulting true ASCII value will shortly be used to calculate the 
needed position in our character table, so lines 28 and 29 store a zero in 
the high-order-byte position of POSN. Because 96 characters times 8 
bytes each will require a table 768 ($300) bytes long, POSN will have to 
be able to include a two-byte value. Thus lines 28 and 29 now take this 
opportunity to set the high byte of POSN to zero now in anticipation of 
future calculations. 

Another bit of programming technique appears on lines 30 and 31. 
Because the Apple assumes all output routines will leave all the registers 
(X, Y and A) unaltered, we must save the Y register so as to be able to re- 
store it to its original condition later on exit. To avoid having to use 
another zero-page location for this, we've delayed saving the Y register 
until now so that its value can be put in the accumulator and then pushed 
onto the stack. Prior to saving the character value in POSN, any at- 
tempt to put Y in the accumulator would have erased the value for the 
character we wanted to print. 

Now for the calculation phase of all this. The first step is to subtract 
32 from the ASCII value in preparation for calculating the table posi- 
tion. Lines 33 through 36 do this. The next step is to multiply by 8 to 
get the relative position in the table. Fortunately, 8 is an easy num- 
ber to multiply by. You may remember from earlier issues that a left-shift 
operation is equivalent to multiplying by 2. Therefore, all we need do is 
shift left three times to get the effect of multiplying by 8 (2 X 2 X 2 = 8). 

Normally, because POSN is a two-byte value, each shift would have 
to be a set of ASL and ROLs. However, because we know we're starting 
with a value less than 96, we know the first shift cannot possibly give a re- 
sult greater than 256. In looking at lines 37 through 41, you can see that 
line 37 does the first multiply by two. It is then lines 38 through 41 that 
do the two-byte shifts to get the final result. Remember also that an ASL 



puts the bit pushed out the end into the carry flag. That allows ROL to 
pick up the carry when shifting the high-order byte. 

Consider the example in table 3 to see how the shifts work. The letter 
A has an ASCII value of $41. After subtracting $20 (32 decimal) we'll 
have a result of $21 (33 decimal). After multiplying by 8, we should get a 
result of $108 (264 decimal). 

Once the multiplication by 8 has been done, the only thing remain- 
ing is to take the relative offset position determined and add that to the 
base address of the table. In this case, we will assume that the table has 
been loaded at $9000 (and presumably protected by setting himem: 
36864). 

Once the table position is calculated, the screen byte to be modified 
must be calculated also. This is done by CALC2. Lines 53 through 59 
take the contents of BASL.BASH and add $lCxx to that, where xx is the 
value of CH at that point. Adding $1C00 gives the base address of the hi- 
res screen line corresponding to the current text page line. We could have 
used the Y register for CH, but that would have prevented us from easily 
using the Y register to index the character table data. Therefore, we add 
CH to make BASL,BASH the address of the first hi-res screen byte to be 
modified. Note that an added advantage of this approach is that HTAB 
and VTAB commands will continue to work on the hi-res page. Scroll- 
ing, however, will not be available. 

GETBYTE (line 61) is the section responsible for putting the charac- 
ter on the hi-res screen. This is done in a number of stages. The first step 
is to set the Y register to #$00 to prepare to retrieve the data bytes from 
the table. Gl then starts the retrieval loop by getting the first byte of the 
character from the table and storing it on the hi-res screen. 

Now here's where it gets interesting. Normally, the next steps would 
be to increment Y to get the next character from the table, and to also 
add $400 to the POSN value to access the next horizontal line on the 
screen. The problem is, if Y changes, we won't access the line directly be- 
low the one we just modified, but rather one byte to the right of where we 
want to be. 

The solution is to add $3FF, rather than $400, to POSN. That way 
the value of POSN will grow in a way compatible with the increasing 
value of the Y register. This part of the listing is worth studying until you 
have the concept. It saves a lot of needless saving of the Y register and 
hence needless extra time and memory usage. The technique can be ap- 
plied to many other situations as well. 

Once the entire eight bytes have been put on the hi-res screen, lines 78 
through 81 restore the accumulator to the value of the original character 
to be printed and the Y register to its original value. The jump to 
COUT1 ($FDF0) is then done to complete the printing to the normal 
text screen. The advantages of this were discussed earlier (maintenance of 
BASL,BASH, CV, and so on). 

A Hi-Res Character Set. The way to use the character generator is 
to load the assembled binary routine at $300 (768 decimal). In an Apple- 
soft program, you would then execute an hgr command, followed by a 
call 768 to activate the routine. 

If you were to use the routine entirely from machine language, you 
would have to call it directly. See the articles on internal hi-res for more 
information on these. 

There is, however, one minor detail still missing. That is the table that 
we assumed existed at $9000. Since you don't yet have a means of easily 
creating your own character set, you'll need a table to use. 

This data, although lengthy, will provide you with a complete char- 
acter set to be loaded at $9000. Although it will take a while to enter the

Here is how it works. 

You review what you like from 
the pre-selected food groups in 
the system. Delete any foods 
you don't enjoy. Add anything 
new at any time. Then decide 
how often you like to eat certain 
items. For example. Don't like 
liver? Then eliminate it with a few 
simple keystrokes. Or, you can 
plan for it as seldom as once every 
99 weeks or as often as daily. 

Want to go out to your favorite 
restaurant? Enter the restaurant's 
name as a "Main Course." Now 
your computer will automatically 
remind you to go out to eat— and 
as often as you select. It will de- 
lete all other items from that meal 
except the name of the restaurant. 

AUTOMATIC SHOPPING LIST 

You get a new menu each week 
or for just a few days if you want. 
And, it generates a detailed shop- 
ping list, automatically. It can 
arrange each item on the list in 
sequence according to the aisles 
at your favorite store. Studies 
show a shopping list will discour- 
age impulse buying and save 
you money. 

Also, it generates a per serving 
calorie counter. This is easy to 
delete anytime you are not in a 
diet mood or want to celebrate 
for any reason. You never count 
calories unless you want to. 

RANDOMLY DELICIOUS 

Say goodby to boring meals. 
Your computer will remember 
variety is the spice of life. This 
system makes eating at home a 
pleasure again. Each menu is 
randomly generated from major 
food groups according to the 
specific criteria you select. The 
system is easy to learn and easy 
to operate Yet it is a sophisti- 
cated piece of software which will 
prevent menu mix-ups. 

It will add a new dimension to 
your home meals without increas- 
ing your food costs It is rumored 
The Pizza Program may actually 
reduce the climbing divorce rate 
Husbands now have something 
to look forward to for dinner 
Wives think it is terrific because 



it saves time and effort. And, kids 
love anything computerized. This 
is a useful and practical applica- 
tion you'll appreciate day after 
day, week after week. 

TRY IT FOR 30 DAYS 
WITHOUT RISK 

This tested system is guaran- 
teed to make your life easier and 
happier. Our home trial lets you 
actually use The Pizza Program 
for a full 30 days before you de- 
cide to keep it. Watch the fun and 
convenience it creates. Enjoy 
better meals and see how much 
time it saves. If you are not satis- 
fied for any reason, return it 
within 1 month for a prompt and 
courteous refund. Your invest- 
ment is just $34.50 plus $2.00 for 
shipping and handling. (Califor- 
nia residents add 6V?% sales tax.) 
Full documentation is included. 

OUT OF THE RUT 

One housewife's reaction to 
this program is typical. She wrote, 
"Before using your system I found 
myself getting into a rut of serv- 
ing the same things over and over. 
The Pizza Program has changed 
all of this for me. We now have a 
wider variety of dinners and best 
of all I don't have to decide what 
they will be. If this was all it did, 
I'd be thrilled. But it isn't. The 
shopping list I receive along with 
my menus has been such a time 
saver. I quickly run through it 
and delete anything I feel I don't 
need and add something I might. 
I would have a hard time going 
back to doing my menus by hand." 

This system requires an Apple II 
Plqs* with 48K and 1 disk drive.

As a side note, this is an odd program in that it doesn't actually do 
anything. It just creates a data table. Assemble it anyway and save the 
object code under the name ASCII SET. 

To test all this out, you can use this simple Applesoft program. You 
probably should verify that you can at least get this much to work be- 
fore diving in and trying to use the routines from within your own ma- 
chine language programs.

Summary. At this point you should feel fairly comfortable with the 
idea of how a hi-res character generator works. The ideas presented here 
rely heavily on a general degree of familiarity with a variety of tech- 
niques discussed in earlier issues, specifically, output vector use and in- 
terception, memory mapping of the hi-res and text screens, and of course 
general techniques of machine language programming. If you are hav- 
ing difficulty in any of these areas, you may wish to review previous 
issues. 

All in all, you should find the approach shown here to be much eas- 
ier than you first thought. The similarities between the text and hi-res 
screens greatly reduce the amount of difficulty in creating a character 
generator. 

Next month, we'll do a character editor to create your own hi-res 
character fonts (the term used for the character design), and also take a 
brief look at how hi-res graphics in arcade-style games can take advan- 
tage of these same techniques to create a wide variety of effects. fl

Volume TWO! 




T.M. 



by Bob Nacon 



The success of the original Amper-Mag i c m program package and the 
introduction of its technique for attaching new commands to Applesoft 
programs has stimulated the production of Command Library"" packages 
designed around a 'theme' such as information display or output, input, 
memory management, etc., which will enhance your Applesoft programs. They 
will give your program a professional operation and appearance by 
increasing speed, reducing size, and giving you features you never could 
have before, while still allowing you to program with the ease of BASIC. 

Ampei — Magic Command Library No. 2 is dedicated to information display 
and output capabilities. Read on and enjoy the new programming power 
Ampei — Magic Command Library No. 2 will give you. 

This disk contains 27 machine language routines ready to be inserted 
quickly and painlessly into your own Applesoft programs. Included among 
them is the most powerful PRINT USING routine yet created for Applesoft, 
as wel I as some small but very handy routines for control ling the appear- 
ance and activity on the display screen. 

In order to use these commands, you wil I need the Ampei — Magic program 
itself which is contained on Volume One. SOME commands on this disk are: 

** Access the most powerful PRINT USING command EVER for the Apple. 
It sure does more than just line up decimal points! It works with 
strings of characters as wel I as numbers, and lets the program de- 
cide whether to make them Flash or Inverse or Normal depending on 
conditions you specify. With numbers, you can have fixed or 
floating dollar sign and/or optional commas and a variety of fill 
characters. You can embed standard phrases within your format de- 
sign. You can even print to the screen WHILE outputting to the 
printer! And generate NO GARBAGE to collect! All in all, the 
most powerful PRINT USING yet! 

** Print to the screen while a peripheral is active 

** Save and restore instantly any text screen, no matter how complex 
with flashing, inverse, and any window settings... 

** Make your program WAIT a length of time specified in ordinary sec- 
onds (to the tenth of a second); the time may be a variable or 
expression which can be controlled by the program... 

** Print anywhere on the screen under program control, either with 
absolute movements or with relative movements... 

** Print string arrays to any device, with or without an appended 
special character, and WITHOUT A LOOP... 

** Set, clear, or toggle ANY bit or bits anywhere in RAM memory... 

** Check the keyboard when called, pause if SPACEBAR is pressed, then 
continue If SPACE Is pressed again or GOTO a location if RETURN is 
pressed . . . 

** Print the current text screen on command or from the program... 

** Send ASCII characters to peripheral devices and POKE peripheral 
card memory to set or clear bits for control purposes... 

** AND MORE

Bert Kersey, the fellow who used to write this column, says to say 
hello. He's the one whose picture used to appear at the top — remember 
the guy, obviously from California, with a disk drive to his ear? Folks say 
his dog Sophie really wrote the column. It's not true, though. Sophie is a 
lot funnier than Bert. . . . 

Decrying Disk-Drive Decibels. Apple disk drives make a lot of 
noise. In fact, I've never met one that you had to hold up to your ear. 
Most of them are leather-lunged little devils that will moan and groan 
your head off if you let them. There's a guy here in Kansas who says that 
he has four disk drives and that they all sound different. Each of the 
little whelps seems to have its own personality. 

Those of you who've been at this for a while probably understand a 
bit of this clatter. If DOS is new to you, stay tuned; you'll find some ex- 
planation of it here. Readers of this column can expect to find un- 
abashed enthusiasm for the Apple II; cynical remarks about CP/M and 
the Pascal Operating System; and tips, tricks, and kind words for plain 
old Apple DOS. 

In the Beginning Was Init. What would be a more suitable place to 
begin than with inifl Even those of you who first sat down at an Apple 
last week have used this DOS command by now. And those of you who 
are old pros may be surprised at what you don't know about it. After this 
initial discussion, we'll talk about the changes Apple made to DOS 3.3 in 
January when it released the Apple lie. 

We all know init is the command you use to make a brand-new disk 
work. If you really want to hear your disk-drive holler, slip in a brand- 
new disk and do a few catalogs, loads, or saves. Its plea will be "I/O er- 
ror." Always keep a brand-new disk around in case one of your drives 
gets recalcitrant. When it finally sends back the message "uncle" you'll 
know it's had enough. 

Init's younger brother is named boot, the friendliest of the DOS com- 
mands. This is because you usually don't have to type anything to exe- 
cute it. (At least 80 percent of computer literacy is knowing how to type.) 
At any rate, init and boot are brethren. They share a couple of subrou- 
tines inside DOS. When you do an init, DOS replicates itself onto a disk. 
When you boot that disk, DOS brings itself back to life. 

Greetings. In addition, when you boot a disk, it automatically runs 
one of the programs stored on it, the hello program. When you initialize 
the disk, the program you want to be the hello program must be present 
in your computer's memory so it can be saved on the new disk. 

What often confuses people is that every disk you want to use must 
be initialized, but probably only 10 percent of these will ever be booted. 
Nine out of every ten disks you meet are used to store word processing, 
financial modeling, or other types of data files. 

"Why do I have to put a hello program on a disk I'm just going to 
use for data storage?" people ask. The answer is that there's no good rea- 
son for it. It's just the way things are normally done. But in a moment 
we'll teach the old DOS a new trick. 

The init command does three things to your disk: it formats the disk, 
puts a copy of DOS itself on the disk, and saves the hello program. You 
must use the init command on new disks before they will work with your 
Apple. You can also reinitialize your old disks, but whatever is on those 
disks will be erased. 

Now the Syntax. Syntax is a word apparently invented to churn the 
stomachs of kids flunking French in college. One of the many things Ap- 
ple teaches is that syntax can be a useful word. Presumably, however, 
there are those flunking computer-science classes right now who cringe at 



the cheerful greeting, "syntax error." 

The init command requires that a file name follow it. This name is 
the name that will be given to the hello program. Incidentally, if you 
don't have a Basic program loaded when you enter the init command, 
your new disk will still end up with a hello file on it; it will be empty 
(usually). 

After "init file name" you may include a volume, slot, or drive num- 
ber. One of the great beauties of Apple DOS is that these things are op- 
tional. With many other disk operating systems, you have to type in the 
volume, the slot/drive, or what color pajamas your disk wears every time 
you turn around. This, as you may notice, is user-hostile. 

A Volume on Volumes. If you don't supply a volume number, your 
disk will automatically be given the improbable volume number 254. 
This is the highest possible volume number — they stretch on down to L 
If you specify a volume number less than 0, you'll get a syntax error; if 
you specify 0, you'll surprisingly get 254; if you specify any number over 
254, you'll get a range error. 

(If for some reason you need to know the volume number of a spe- 
cific disk, just catalog it. The only way to change a disk's volume num- 
ber is to reinitialize the disk.) 

After all this data on volume numbers, those of you who are new 
around here may get the idea that volume numbers are pretty impor- 
tant. In fact, unless you have a hard disk drive or a program that needs to 
be very compulsive about where it stores its data, volume numbers are 
close to useless, and you can forget about them. 

About Those Noises. When you type in the init command and press 
return, the first thing you'll hear out of your disk drive is a terrible groan 
or clatter. This is because DOS has just told your disk drive it is reading 
track 40 and it should move to track 0. Now we all know that Apple 
drives only have thirty-five tracks. So when Uncle DOS says this he 
knows your drive is going to slam into the stopper just beyond track 0 at 
least five times and probably more. This dirty trick assures everyone that 
we start on track 0. Your disk controller card pulls the same trick every 
time you boot a disk. 

After your drive quiets down from this merciless treatment, listen 
very carefully and count very quickly. You will hear exactly thirty-four 
small "bips" as the magnetic recording head inside your drive moves 
from track to track and pounds spikes into your disk that mark the be- 
ginning and end of each track's sixteen sectors. At the same time it fills 
every sector with 256 zeros. 

After this you will hear a sliding sound as the head moves to track 17 
(in hexadecimal that's $11). This is the track DOS uses to write down 
what is stored where on the disk. The stop here is to fill in some initial 
information. 

Then you will hear another sliding sound as the head moves to track 
0. Here Uncle DOS procreates. An exact image of the DOS in memory is 
written on the disk in tracks 0 and 1 and part of track 2. Whenever this 
disk you are initializing is booted, this image of DOS will be brought 
back into your Apple and given life. If your active DOS has any muta- 
tions or bugs (whether good or evil), they will be passed down through 
the generations. 

Next comes another sliding sound as the head moves back to track 
17 ($11). Uncle DOS is checking to find out where he can save the hello 
program. Brand-new disks always indicate that the next file should be 
stored in track 18 ($12). You may hear a few shuffling noises as the pro- 
gram is saved. After that, the init command is finished. The whole proc-

ess takes about thirty seconds. 

Genetic Engineering. The init command can be used to make per- 
manent the changes you intentionally put into DOS. Later in the year 
you'll read here, for example, how to give yourself a new DOS com- 
mand that will display text files on your screen or printer. After the rou- 
tines for this command are poked into DOS, you'll do an init. Whenever 
that disk is booted, you'll have a version of Uncle DOS that contains the 
new command. 

We can demonstrate this now in an area a little more germane to init. 
Normally the hello program on your disk must be in either Applesoft or 
Integer Basic. By changing just one byte, however, you can get Uncle 
DOS to brun an assembly language program or exec a text file for his 
boot greeting. 

For RUN: C = 6 

BRUN: C = 52 

EXEC: C = 20 
POKE -25022, C (normally 6) 

After making this poke, enter new to erase any program in memory 
and initialize a disk, using the file name you want for your hello program. 
After the disk has been initialized, delete the empty Basic file you will 
find on it. Then use the FID program on your System Master disk to put 
your binary or text file on the newly initialized disk. When you boot that 
disk, it will brun or exec the file with the hello file name. 

This poke only affects the run command DOS uses at the end of a 
boot. It does not change the type of file that is saved as part of the init 
command. 

Mysterious Problems. This knack Uncle DOS has for saving an 
exact image of himself during an init can occasionally be a source of frus- 
tration. Somewhere along the line, a program gone wild or a careless 
poke may have introduced an unobtrusive error into DOS. Every disk 
you initialize from that DOS and any of its progeny will contain the 
error.

It may seem crazy that changing the value of a single byte inside DOS 
could do much damage, but look what we were just able to do with only 
one poke. Here's one more just to prove the point. The following poke 
should be used only on other people's computers. If anyone asks, you 
don't remember where you read this: 

POKE -22397,0 

Since DOS (or any other software) is so sensitive to small changes, 
it's a good idea, when you initialize a disk you plan to use for booting, to 
start with a clean version of DOS. Start by booting your System Master 
disk. Then immediately do your initializing. Do not run any programs first. 

In particular, don't run any programs that insert themselves between 
DOS and its buffers (don't worry if you don't know what that means; 
we'll get to it in a month or two). Global Program Line Editor, for exam- 
ple, is a wonderful program. But any disks you initialize after running 
GPLE will save space for it whenever they are booted. 

Yes, Master. A disk you initialize yourself is a "slave" disk. This 
means that, when the disk is booted, DOS loads itself into whatever 
memory area it was in when the disk was initialized. Back in the early 
days of personal computing (twenty-four months ago) this was of some 
concern. Various Apples had various amounts of memory in them. A 
slave disk initialized on a 48K Apple, for example, would not boot on a 
32K Apple. 

If you have an Apple with less than 48K of memory, take it and run, 
don't walk, to the nearest computer store and buy it a handful of chips. 
These are much cheaper now than they were the last time you checked. 
Now that we have the Apple He and its 64K minimum memory, up- 
grading memory will be a lost art within six months. Have it done now. 

Then you can forget the program called Master Create on your DOS 
System Master disk. It is used to change "slave" disks into "master" 
disks (disks that will boot on any size Apple). Since we just talked the 
owner of the last remaining Apple with less than 48K into upgrading, we 
don't need master disks anymore. And the slaves are freed. 

Look Ma, No DOS. The DOS manual, under one of those little stop 
sighs, insists that the init command should not be used from inside pro- 
grams, but only in immediate-execution mode. It doesn't say why. Prob- 
ably it's because the program with the init in it would become the hello 
program. If you booted the new disk, its hello program would promptly 
proceed to init its disk — and erase itself. 

But come on, Uncle DOS. We are user-friendly people, right? And 
we all know human users never realize they don't have any initialized 
disks left until their Apples are full of an evening's worth of data that 
needs to be saved. Professional-quality programs should allow you to ini- 
tialize disks without leaving the program and losing your data. 

One trick is to poke old Uncle DOS in a few magical places so that he 
won't save a hello file. We can also make him forget to save himself — this 
will leave tracks l and 2 empty and give us more disk space for files. 
(Track 0 will also be empty, but getting Uncle DOS to use it would re- 
quire major surgery.) 

In the February DOStalk, Kersey told you how to free up these tracks 
on your existing disks. Now you find out how simple it is to initialize 
your disks that way: 



POKE -23192,76 
POKE -20743,11 
POKE -20813, 4 
POKE -22263,65 



(normally 32) 
(normally 5) 
(normally 12) 
(normally 33) 



Note that these are negative numbers. The first poke makes Uncle 
DOS forget to save a hello program. The second poke makes him forget 
to replicate himself. The third poke makes him mark tracks 1 and 2 as 
"free" rather than "in use." 

You may or may not want to use the fourth poke. It changes the syn- 
tax of the init command. After this poke, "init file name" will give you a 
syntax error. Just enter "init" without a file name to avoid the error. 
This is handy for reminding you that neither a hello program nor DOS 
will be saved. However, it also causes programs that use the standard init 
syntax to fail. One, for instance, is CopyA on the DOS System Master disk. 

These pokes can be typed in by hand very carefully or can be in- 
cluded in a program. Unfortunately, you can't use init itself to save a ver- 
sion of DOS with these pokes intact. Your homework for this month is 
to figure out why.

If you include these pokes in the hello program on the disk you 
usually boot from, any disks you initialize will be data disks. Use them to 
store graphics, word processing files, or other files. DOS isn't on them 
and they won't boot; but so what? 

(Note to assembly language programmers: after you've made the 
above changes in a DOS that has already been booted, the following 
memory areas become free space: SB600— SB65C, SB700— SB7B4, 
$B7C2-$B7D5.) 

DOS 3.3e. When the Apple lie was released in January, a few fairly 
minor changes were made to DOS 3.3. 

A routine used to calculate random access file position was changed 
slightly. It's now about 10 percent easier to understand but comes up 
with the same answers it always did, it seems. This routine lives at 45873 
(SB331) Memory Lane. 

The DOS boot routine was changed slightly to store the value 255 
($FF) in one of the bytes of the slot 3 scratch space (1275; $4FB) and to 
throw two new switches, one at 49164 (SC00C) and the other at 49166 
(SCOOE). The He reference manuals hadn't made their way to Kansas 
City when this article was written, so we can't tell you what these 
switches do exactly, but at least one of them seems to turn off the He's 
eighty-column card if it is on during a boot. 

Booting is somewhat simplified on the He, by the way. By pressing 
the open-apple key (located just to the left of the space bar), control, and 
reset all at the same time, you can force a reboot even if your system is 
hopelessly locked up. These keys are separated widely enough so that 
you won't hit them by accident. (It takes practice to do it on purpose.) 

Ever Had Appendicitis? Uncle DOS has always had a very obscure 
bug in his append command. That's the one you use to add data to the 
end of a sequential text file. In the old DOS 3.3 this command doesn't 
work if it is preceded by an exec or an "end of data" error on a file that 
ends on a sector boundary. Since, on the average, only 1 in every 256 files 
ends exactly at the end of a sector, and since the exec or error has to pre- 
cede the append command with no other intervening DOS errors, and 
since the error has to occur on a different file than the one being append- 



ed to, this bug is quite obscure indeed. It is difficult to replicate on pur- 
pose. Nonetheless, when the stars are right, it can ruin your day. 

That bug has been fixed in DOS 3.3e. Unfortunately, as often hap- 
pens, the fix caused another bug. Now append fails to work on any file 
that ends one byte short of a full sector. Before, append failed maybe 
once in every 10,000 tries. Now it fails once in every 256 tries. This means 
append still works right 99.6 percent of the time. 

If you'd like append to work right 100 percent of the time, use the 
pre-IIe version of DOS and, before every append, poke —18851,0. This 
exterminates even the obscure bug. 

Probably the most important factor in the 3.3e changes is their loca- 
tion. Changes have to be put someplace, and Apple put these in a for- 
merly empty space inside DOS at 47721 (SBA69). This territory has been 
claimed over the years by many different programs. Beware, program- 
mers — you can't use it anymore. Pencil this into your copies of Beneath 
Apple DOS now. 

The use of this space also means that most programs that move DOS 
to a language card do not work correctly with DOS 3.3e. Using append 
while DOS is on the card brings your system down in flames. 

Speaking of Language Cards. In the February Softalk Open Dis- 
cussion, Chris Riley asked about putting DOS on a language card. This 
is no trivial exercise, but it can be done. The trick is in handling all the 
switching back and forth between DOS on the card and Basic on the 
motherboard. I've spent a couple of weeks trying to do it and my pro- 
gram is all finished — except that it doesn't work. 

Meanwhile, Riley and anybody else who's interested might take a 
look at "Loading DOS 3.3 on the Language Card" in the July/ August 
1981 Call -A.P.P.L.E. and "Notes about DOS Mover" in the Novem- 
ber/December 1981 issue. Both articles are by Cornelis Bongers. The 
program as published works just fine with the pre-3.3e version of Apple 
DOS. What's beyond my capacity to understand is that the folks at Nib- 
ble own the rights to this program. The manager of data processing al- 
ways did say programming was too complex for me.

Many programs would benefit if it were possible to mix hi-res graph- 
ics and text on the Apple screen. Although there is a four-line text win- 
dow available at the bottom of the hi-res screen, that won't cut the mus- 
tard if, for example, we want to design a graph with two scaled and la- 
beled axes. 

There are several ways around this limitation. Some of the best in- 
volve convincing your Apple to print on the hi-res screen rather than on 
the text page. Unfortunately, this kind of convincing requires talking to 
the Apple in its own native machine language — Applesoft won't do. 

Several years ago Apple published and distributed to its dealers a 
booklet and a set of disks called Apple Software Bank Contributed Pro- 
grams Volumes 3—5. Volume 3 contained a hi-res character generator 
and character table. 

If you can get your hands on that disk, your life will be much sim- 
pler. If you can't, you're going to have to type in two long and very bor- 
ing programs to create those routines. 

This column is not dedicated to boring anyone, and if this were not 
such an incredibly useful tool, we'd never ask you to do anything so te- 
dious. But, just this once, do it. It's worth it. 

Once the dirty work is done, we'll use the hi-res character generator 
to create a program that will track your weight over an eleven-week pe- 
riod and plot the results on a graph. If tracking your weight has no ap- 
peal, you can easily change the labels to track your height, IQ, or 
shoe size. 

We'll also learn how to scale graphs, and we'll practice moving pro- 
grams around into different areas of the Apple's memory — a trick that 
becomes increasingly important when you start filling up your Apple's 
memory and need to start searching around for a few free bytes. 

This discussion is written for disk drive owners — if you have a cas- 
sette, you can still use the hi-res routines but you'll have to renumber the 
programs that poke the routines into memory so that they and your 
main program can all be saved to cassette simultaneously. 

Let's get the hard work done first. There are two programs that poke 
data into memory. The first one pokes in a machine language program 
that generates characters on the hi-res screen. The second (and longer) 
program pokes in a table that describes those characters in excruciating 
detail. Make sure that you boot a disk before you start typing either pro- 
gram — you'd hate to type in something this long and then discover that 
you had no way to save it:

Run it and then type save Table Maker. If you were able to find the 
contributed programs disk, you'll note that this table is only a portion of 
the one on the disk. For the time being, we've omitted lower-case and 
control characters. Including them would have about tripled the typ- 
ing job. 

If you looked closely at the addresses where these programs poked, 
you may have noted that they are right in the middle of that area of 
memory between the text page and the hi-res page where most Apple- 
soft programs reside (look at the memory map on page 141 of your DOS 
3.3 manual if you want a refresher). If you ate your Wheaties this morn- 
ing you might even have been wondering if this wasn't going to cause 
something of a conflict once we got around to writing our Applesoft 
graphing program. 

If you were actually wondering that, go to the head of the class. If 
we'd tried to write an Applesoft program of any length, it would even-

SOU Al If

tually have overwritten the two machine language routines, and we 
would have had no hi-res character set. 

Applesoft programs usually load starting at location 2048. However, 
it is possible to force them to load at other locations. There's a pointer in 
locations 103 and 104 that indicates the starting address for an Apple- 
soft program. Try peeking those locations now: 

PRINT PEEK(103), PEEK(104) 
You should get: 

1 8 

Location 103 stores the low two digits of the hex address, and loca- 
tion 104 stores the high two digits of the address, so if you translate the 
numbers to hex and arrange them in the order we are usually accus- 
tomed to seeing them in, you get 0801 . Naturally, your Apple is thinking 
in hex, not in decimal. However, your lightning-quick mind has already 
recognized that 801 in hex is the same as 2049 in decimal (8*16*16 + 0 
* 16 + 1). 

But wait. You thought we said 2048 was the starting address, not 
2049. Indeed it is. However, for various obscure reasons, the pointer 
actually points to the byte after the starting address. In fact, there is 
another rule: the starting address itself must always contain a zero. 
Try this: 

PRINT PEEK (2048) 

So let's write a routine that will force all subsequent Applesoft pro- 
grams to load somewhere up in high memory. As we'll only be using hi- 
res page one, the memory associated with page two is a good place. 
Checking the map, we see that page two begins at 4000 hex, usually writ- 
ten as $4000, or 16384 decimal. The first thing to do, then, is to change 
the pointer so that it points at $4001. 

The high byte of $4001 is $40; the low byte is $01. In order to poke 
these values into the Apple we have to convert them to decimal (Apple- 
soft uses decimal; the Monitor uses hex). The number 1 is 1 in hex or in 
decimal. Forty hex is the same as 4 times 16, or 64. So here's our line 
of code: 

POKE 103,1: POKE 104,64 
One last thing to do — ensure that the first byte is zero: 
POKE 16384,0 

Once we've typed in these three pokes, any Applesoft program we 
load will load up in the hi-res page two area. Here's a quick test. After 
you've keyed in the three pokes, load in any Applesoft program. List it to 
make sure it's there. Then type hgr2:text. This will clear page two and 
then put you back in text mode. Now try to list your program. All gone. 

Remember, you have to change the low memory pointer before you 
load your Applesoft program — you can't do it from within the pro- 
gram. So let's write a little introductory program that turns on the graph- 
ics and moves the start of program address:

POKE 104,64: 



POKE 16384,0 

Save this program under the title Diet Hello. We'll run it to change 
the program starting address before we load our main graphics program. 
Now type new and let's start work on the graphing program: 
10 DIM A%(200): GOSUB 1000: GOSUB 3000: GOTO 100 
The first thing we do is reserve space via the dimension statement for 
all of the data we expect to be entering. Then we jump to our two setup 
routines. Subroutine 1000 sets up the graph on the hi-res page and sub- 
routine 3000 sets up the menu on the text page: 

1000 REM *** PRINT GRAPH "* 

1005 GOSUB 2000: HCOLOR= 3: PRINT CHR$(12): VTAB 1: HTAB

1010 FORX = 0 TO 9: VTAB 22 - (X * 2 + 1): HTAB 1: PRINT 100 + 

(10 * X): HPLOT 23,X * 16 + 20 TO 27,X * 16 + 20: NEXT 
1020 VTAB 23: HTAB 7: FOR X = 1 TO 11: PRINT X" ";: HPLOT 28 

+ 21 * X, 168 TO 28 + 21 * X..172: NEXT : VTAB 24: HTAB 

19: PRINT "WEEK"; 
1030 HPLOT 25,0 TO 25,170 TO 270,170: GOSUB 2010: RETURN

CALL 43089: RETURN 
2010 REM TURN OFF HI-RES CHARACTER SET 
2015 VTAB 24: HTAB 1: PRINT " ": PR# 0: CALL 43089: RETURN 



Let's walk through this together. The first thing the graphics routine 
does is jump to a subroutine at line 2000 that turns on the hi-res charac- 
ter set. Probably the best way to handle line 2005 is to treat it as one of 
the natural mysteries of the world and not to worry about it too much. It 
sets things up so that the print command calls our machine language rou- 
tine and writes on the hi-res screen instead of the text screen. If your 
curiosity is insatiable, try to get your hands on the booklet that goes 
along with volumes 3 through 5 and read up on it there. 

The rest of line 1005 sets the drawing color to white 1 (color 3) and 
then clears the screen — we could have used hgr, but printing CHR$(12), 
or control-L, works just as well with our routine active. It then prints the 
label for our vertical axis in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. 

Line 1010 does a lot. This is the line that prints the numbers from 100 
to 190 up the left-hand side of the screen and then makes little hash 
marks next to them. Let's see how it works. 

The variable X is going to run from 0 to 9 in value. The first thing we 
do with X is set our vertical tab. Then we calculate a weight based on X. 
Finally, we choose the horizontal line on which to print our hash mark. 
Look at the three formulas in that line and at their values as X changes. 
Table 1 shows the results of these formulas.

These formulas are not all that difficult to figure out. Keep in mind 
that the hi-res screen is 280 pixels wide and 192 pixels high (and that pixel 
is just a good Scrabble word meaning dot). Since the Apple screen is also 
40 characters wide and 24 characters high, a little quick division reveals 
that each character must be 8 pixels (192/24) high and 7 (280/40) wide. 
So if you're going to vertically tab down 2 characters, you are moving the 
equivalent of 16 pixels toward the bottom of the screen.

APRIL 1983 



Line 1020 draws the scale and hash marks for the X axis of the graph. 
Line 1030 actually plots the two axes and then jumps to a subroutine at 
line 2010 that turns off the hi-res character set, so that print statements 
will go back to their old habit of printing on the text page. 

Using the two subroutines at 2000 and 2010, you can alternate be- 
tween printing text on the hi-res screen and on the text page. This fea- 
ture is useful in our program because we can set up a menu of functions 
on the text page without disturbing our graph: 

3000 REM ** SET UP TEXT PAGE ** 
3005 GOSUB 2010 

3010 HOME : HTAB 10: INVERSE : PRINT "WEIGHT TRACKING 

CHART": NORMAL 
3020 VTAB 5: PRINT TAB( 5)"L(OAD DATA FROM DISK" 
3030 PRINT : PRINT TAB( 5)"E(NTER NEW DATA FROM 

KEYBOARD" 

3040 PRINT : PRINT TAB( 5)"S(AVE DATA TO DISK" 
3100 RETURN 

Inverse is a clever command that prints your characters in black on 
white instead of the other way around. It works well for highlighting im- 
portant text. Normal rectifies the situation. Another command, called 
flash, works the same way as inverse does. Flash is particularly useful if 
you want to create painfully annoying text displays. Use it sparingly. 

Now we need to design an input routine. We would like one that not 
only collects keyboard input generally but that also allows us to bounce 
quickly back and forth at any time between the graph and the menu on 
the text page. 

19 REM ** KEYBOARD STROBE ** 

20 POKE - 16368,0 

21 X = PEEK ( - 16384): IF X < 128 THEN 21 

22 IF X = 155 THEN FLAG = NOT FLAG: IF FLAG THEN POKE - 
16303,0 

23 IF NOT FLAG THEN POKE - 16304,0 

24 A$ = CHR$ (X - 128): POKE - 16368,0: RETURN 

The escape key toggles between the input display and the graphics 
display. 



When we press escape, which is the same as CHR$(27), X will be 
equal to 128 + 27, or 1 55. Whenever that happens, the routine checks the 
variable named FLAG, which tells it whether we are currently looking at 
the text page or the graph. Poking - 16304 (or peeking it) puts us in 
graphics mode; poking — 16303 puts us back in text mode. Both", as you 
remember, make the switch without erasing anything on either screen. 

Next we need to design the main program, which will check to see if 
we want to go to any of the functions on the menu and will send us there 
when we ask: 



150 



100 REM ** MAIN PROGRAM " 
110 GOSUB 20: IF A$ = "L" THEN 
120 IF A$ = "E" THEN 300 
130 IF A$ = "S" THEN 500 
140 GOTO 1 10 

There were three major program parts listed in the menu on the text 
page: enter data, load data from disk, and save data. Let's start with 
enter data. 

There are two times when we will want to enter data. The first is 
when we are just beginning to enter information about a person and 
therefore know that we can start storing it at the beginning of our array. 
The second, more complicated situation occurs when we want to append 
new data to an existing file. In that case we'll have to load in existing 
information, check to see how many days have been entered, and then 
start entering keyboard information from that point. Let's let K be the 
variable representing our day counter, and use a flag, FG, to keep track 
of whether this is a new file or an appendage to an existing file: 

300 REM ** ENTER DATA ** 

VTAB 5: CALL - 958: PRINT : PRINT TAB( 5)"N(EW PERSON": 
PRINT : PRINT TAB( 5)"A(PPEND DATA": GOSUB 20: IF A$ = 
"N" THEN K = 0:FG = 1 
PRINT : PRINT "ENTER 0 TO QUIT": PRINT 
PRINT "ENTER WEIGHT FOR DAY ";K + 1;: INPUT ":";WEIGHT: 
IF WEIGHT = 0 THEN A%(K) = 0: GOSUB 3000: GOTO 100 
WEIGHT = WEIGHT + (100 - WEIGHT) * (WEIGHT < 100) - 
(WEIGHT - 190) * (WEIGHT > 190) 
A%(K) = 20 + (190 - WEIGHT) * 1.6:K = K + 1

We'll assume that no sane soul will ever permit his or her weight to 
plummet to zero and therefore will use zero as a signal that the user is 
finished entering data. Lines 310 through 340 form a loop that continues 
until a zero is entered. 

Line 310 prompts you for your next entry, telling you what day 
you're on and using a normal input statement to accept your answer, 
which it stores in the variable WEIGHT. If your entry is 0, line 310 puts 
the menu back on the text page (subroutine 3000) and then goes back to 
the main program. 

Line 315 tests your answer and makes sure that your response falls 
within the acceptable limits of 100 and 190. This line uses logical oper- 
ators, which we discussed a few months ago. For example, the phrase 
(WEIGHT < 100) has a numerical value of 0 unless WEIGHT is less 
than 100, in which case it has a value of 1. To see how it works, try test- 
ing this line in your head with several values. 

Line 320 is a different kettle of fish. What this line does is convert 
WEIGHT (which can range in value from 100 to 190) into a variable, 
A%(K), which represents the Y coordinate of the dot to be plotted. This 
gets a little complicated. The value of Y closest to the top of the screen is 
0; at the bottom the value is 191. The number 190 appears 20 lines from 
the top of the screen; the number 100 appears 164 lines from the top. 

Here's how to come up with the formula on line 320: 

1. The label 190 is on the third row from the top (see the formula for 
vtab in line 1010 and table 1). Each line is eight pixels high. Halfway 
down the third row is 8 + 8 + 4 = 20 pixels from the top. 

2. Every 10 pounds of weight is two rows, or sixteen pixels, lower on 
the screen. Therefore, for every pound less than 190 we must plot 1.6 
pixels further down the screen. 

3. In other words, for any given weight (WEIGHT), the Y coor- 
dinate (also known as the number of lines from the top) is 20 plus the dif- 
ference between 190 and WEIGHT, or (190 - WEIGHT), multiplied 
by 1.6. 

That's all there is to it. We add 1 to K, the day counter, to get ready 
for the next day's data. 

Lines 330 and 335 handle all of the actual plotting. Line 330 uses the 
hplot command, which plots a single dot, and line 335 uses hplot to, 
which draws a line from the last plot position to the new one. 

Hplot to is a nice command because it connects all the dots we want 
to plot. However, we can't use it until we've plotted at least one point 
using hplot. Therefore, line 330 checks for that, and if we're entering the 
first day's data or if we're beginning to append data (first point), it keeps 
control and hplots the dot, then jumps to line 340. Otherwise, control 
bounces down to line 335, where the hplot to command is used. 

If you are wondering where the 28 + 3 * K came from, take a close 
look at line 1020. As you can see, the X coordinate of the first hash mark 
is 28 + 21 * 1, or 49. This marks the end of the first week, or the seventh 
day. The hash mark indicating the end of every week is twenty-one pixels 
farther to the right. Since there are seven days in a week, each day should 
be 21 / 7, or three pixels farther to the right. That's how we got 28 + 
3 * K. 

Finally, let's make sure we understand why the Y coordinate is 
A%(K - 1). A%(K) keeps the data for each day. However, line 320 
changes that data from WEIGHT, which was what we input, to a num- 
ber indicating the Y coordinate of the pixel. We use K — 1 instead of K 
because we already advanced the counter to the next day at line 320. 

The program is far enough along now that you can test it. Save it 
under the file name Diet. 

To run the program, you'll have to bload Character Generator and 
bload Character Table, run Diet Hello, and finally run Diet. Your graph 
should appear on-screen. Press escape to see the menu. Try entering some 
data (ending by entering a zero), and then press escape to see how well it 
graphed. 

Try writing the load and save routines yourself. These should be 
pretty simple for you by now. Next month we will propose one solu- 
tion and then turn the mess into a turnkey program using a text file and 
the exec command. Until then, stay slim!

INDUSTRY MAKES MOVES TO EASE 
CRISIS IN COMPUTER EDUCATION 



In the seventies, educators cried that 
"Johnny can't read." Today, they're con- 
cerned that "Johnny can't compute," but the 
problem isn't necessarily with Johnny. 

Despite overall declining enrollments, col- 
leges and universities can't accommodate 
thousands of students who want a computer 
education, and the story's little better at the 
grade-school level. The problem is not enough 
teachers and inadequate facilities. 

Fewer qualified graduates augurs badly 
for the beleaguered U.S. computer industry. It 
now confronts the Japanese challenge know- 
ing that last year there were only fifty thou- 
sand engineering and computer-science grad- 
uates to fill one hundred fifteen thousand in- 
dustry slots. 

"We've looked at the whole problem and 
it's pervasive," says Patricia Hill Hubbard, 
president of the Education Foundation of the 
two-thousand-member AEA (American Elec- 
tronics Association). "If we don't expand the 
basic university plant through increased teach- 
ing capacity, it's going to be a moot point how 
literate our high school graduates are." 



Fortunately, the AEA, Hewlett-Packard, 
Apple, IBM, and other industry leaders are 
doing something about the problem. With a 
big assist from Hewlett-Packard, the AEA has 
launched a fellowship program designed to in- 
crease the number of engineering and com- 
puter-science doctoral candidates by two hun- 
dred and to encourage them to pursue teach- 
ing careers after graduation. 

Hewlett-Packard has pledged $6 million 
from 1982 to 1987 for the three-part program 
involving twenty- two selected universities. It 
provides tuition support for four-year doc- 
toral work, a stipend for living expenses, and a 
grant of new equipment if the graduate joins 
the science faculty of an accredited university, 
not necessarily one of the twenty-two. 

Total benefits of the program to individ- 
uals range from $48,000 to $72,000, depend- 
ing on whether the candidate attends a public 
or private school. All fellowship loan money is 
forgiven if the candidate holds an accredited 
teaching position for three years after gradua- 
tion — proportionally less is forgiven if the

A MUSICAL PLAY 
ALL ABOUT KIDS 
AND COMPUTERS 

There's a wonderfully ironic twist at the 
end of the musical play Bits and Bytes. Mor- 
ton B. Norton, supersalesman of Computer- 
rama, gives up. He finally realizes that his po- 
tential customer can't possibly afford to buy 
what he's selling. He tells the young girl, 
Happy, that public libraries, workshops, 
clubs, and magazines are ways to learn about 
and use computers without buying one. 

This final-act resolution contrasts well 
with the opening song of Bits and Bytes. The 
South Coast Repertory touring production, 
playing mainly in southern California ele- 
mentary schools for children from kindergar- 
ten to eighth grade, begins with a musical 
number praising the computer revolution and 
imploring the audience to "get your com- 
puter right away." 

The entire cast of Bits and Bytes consists of 
five performers, with three actors playing 
multiple roles. The setting is a funky, make- 
believe computer store. The set is dominated 
by an overgrown, multicolored checkerboard 
that is supposed to be a computer monitor. 
The disk drive is a box with a slot big enough 
for a twenty-four-inch floppy disk. Disks are 
made of flimsy foam-packing material and 
provide some of the play's more slapstick 
moments. 

With a running time of about forty min- 
utes, Bits and Bytes is a very enjoyable kids' 
view of computers. Morton B. Norton (James 
LeGros) "can outsell everybody," but he 
doesn't know that much about computers. 
His two helpers are Bits (Deborah Nishi- 
mura) and Bytes (Sam Hamann). Early on 
they inform the audience that real bits and 
bytes are what computers use to remember 
things. 

Hungrily searching for a customer, Nor- 
ton finds Happy (Laura Leyva), a decidedly 
unhappy little girl. Fast-talking and pushy — a 
typical salesman — Norton closes in for the 
kill: "Sales are our game. So let's talk hi-tech. 
For remembering things a computer is better 
than an elephant, and a lot cleaner, if you 
know what I mean."

Pagination Predicted To Spark Another

An amazing thing has happened at the

daily southern California newspaper has re- 
duced the number of employees in its com- 
posing room by more than half, from twenty- 
two to nine. At the same time, it has nearly 
doubled its output. In addition to the Star- 
News, Knight-Ridder Newspapers publishes 
the daily A U-S ports newspaper and several lo- 
cal weeklies. 

Currently the Star-News is the most tech- 
nically advanced newspaper in the world. It 
took lots of money, but the owners are like 
pioneers in a wild new frontier. They'll be 
called loco at first, and then other publica- 
tions will recognize the rich, untouched terri- 
tory opening up. 

Utilizing a complicated machine that can 
do the work faster, more accurately, and, in 
the long run, cheaper, the eventual goal of the 
Star-News is zero employees in the compos- 
ing room. 

The Newspaper Pagination System (NPS), 
specially developed for the Star-News by In- 
formation International Incorporated of Cul- 
ver City, California, is an expanded and 
adapted version of its "electronic scissors"

computer systems used by several national 
weekly newsmagazines, including Time, News- 
week, and U.S. News and World Report. The 
Star-News is currently the only newspaper in 
the world using the complete pagination sys- 
tem for newspaper production. 

Pagination is the process of actually de- 
signing a page on a terminal screen, using a 
customized graphics tablet and a mouselike 
device for input. Preedited and coded compo- 
nents (pictures, headlines, text), stored in a 
computer's memory, are called up onto a grid 
and keyed into blocks that equal the number 
of inches and columns on the actual page. All 
the scaled-down elements on the screen are 
manipulated to the operator's satisfaction, al- 
lowing freedom to try different layouts and ar- 
rangements expeditiously. When a page is fin- 
ished, a complete, camera-ready Velox is 
printed out through a separate phototypeset- 
ting process. 

Before the electronic make-up portion of 



the process, elements of the newspaper page — 
ads, headlines, stories, bylines, screened pho- 
tographs, and so on — have been entered into 
the main computer separately, using a "front- 
end" computer system, with terminals in each 
of the major departments. All the front-end 
terminals are linked to the main computer, 
where the information is stored for retrieval 
by the make-up editors who work at the pagi- 
nation terminals. 

The NPS is made up of four subsystems, 
all working in conjunction with one another. 
The first is a scanner for digitizing artwork, 
photographs, and line drawings. The second is 
a graphic merge and storage subsystem, com- 
prised of two file managers and a pair of 200 
megabyte disk drives that receive and store 
text and formatted illustration files, interfac- 
ing with the SDC Text-II host computer sys- 
tem. The third subsystem consists of the page- 
make-up stations where the pages are format-

Profitable Texas Minimill Bucks Trend 
AILING STEEL INDUSTRY RETOOLS 



The country's largest steelmaker and "Big 
8" chief negotiator, U.S. Steel Corpora- 
tion, is currently bargaining with labor leaders 
in hopes of curing the "ailing steel industry." 
Competition from Japan and Western Eu- 
rope, the recession, and the loss of the inter- 
national market have seriously injured big 
steel companies in this country. 

The result is the closing down of large steel 
mills all over the United States, particularly 



thriving Texas "minimill" has its head well 
above water. 

Chaparral, with only seven hundred fifty 
employees, puts out an average of one hun- 
dred tons of steel per hour. They can produce 
a ton of steel in less than two man-hours, one 
of the most efficient ratios in the industry. 
Among the more automated of steel mills, 
Chaparral has used computers since it opened 
in 1976. The mill began with "an old Xerox 




Large steel mills like Bethlehem Steel's permanently closed Los Angeles plant have fallen on 
disastrous times. 



along the "rust belt" from New Jersey to the 
Great Lakes. Bethlehem Steel recently closed 
its Los Angeles plant permanently, laying off 
more than one thousand workers, and the 
company is facing the greatest single-year loss 
in history. Only twenty-five years ago, Bethle- 
hem's L.A. plant had been considered the 
most modern and efficient steel mill ever built. 
Nowadays, its West German and Japanese 
competitors are utilizing the latest technology 
and management techniques to outproduce 
and outprofit once-indomitable Bethlehem. 

No one can say for sure what could save 
the ailing steel industry, but examples do exist 
that point to a different approach to the job of 
making steel. Not unlike independent film- 
makers that flourish away from Hollywood 
and its aging studios, smaller steel companies 
are trimming their operations and adapting 
some of the techniques that have made for- 
eign steel producers so successful in recent 
years. 

For instance, in 1982 Chaparral Steel 
Company in Midlothian, Texas, reported 
earnings of $11 million on sales of $160 mil- 
lion. A small operation in comparison to the 
Big 8, to be sure, but the key word here is 
profits. In the midst of the worst steel-indus- 
try slump since the Great Depression, this 



computer," says Michael Redmon of the data 
processing department, referring to a Xerox 
530 that worked in the melt shop. 

The Xerox was unable to keep up with the 
progress of the company, which soon out- 
grew its capacity. The Xerox, which Chapar- 
ral donated to a local high school, was re- 
placed about two years ago with a Hewlett- 
Packard minicomputer. 

The system's primary function is moni- 
toring the casting process in the melt shop — 
maintaining the proper temperature and log- 
ging the number of hours the process is being 
used. The computer controls the furnace, leav- 
ing the operator the ability, of course, to over- 
ride it. In addition to the monitoring, the 
Hewlett-Packard provides chemical analysis 
for all of the metallurgical testing done at 
Chaparral's lab. The desired chemistry is en- 
tered into the system, and it in turn lists the re- 
quired alloys. 

The forty-acre site also includes a me- 
dium-section mill where a complete Japanese 
computer system by Fuji, with a powerful as- 
sembly-language-type program, is being used. 
Five microprocessors control different sec- 
tions of the mill, while constantly monitoring 
each other. Position and speed control, se- 
quence timing, and safety interlocking are all 



maintained by the Fuji system. 

Most of the programming had already 
been done by the Japanese. However, Fuji 
trained some of Chaparral's employees, in- 
cluding a group of electricians who were sent 
to Japan to learn trouble-shooting techniques. 

Chaparral has gotten more than comput- 
ers from Japan. They have also adopted some 
of the Japanese management techniques and 
business practices, such as uniting the worker 
and the front office, retraining, and sharing 
profits. Ironically, while many of their coun- 
terparts from the major steel mills are run- 
ning out of employment benefits, Chaparral 
workers are collecting overtime. 

The seven-year-old minimill is proud of 
its on-site instructional offerings. Two perma- 
nent employee instructors teach electrical and 
mechanical courses on various aspects of both 
disciplines. Voluntary classes are held for an 
average of eight hours per week for six to eight 
week periods. All hourly employees who at- 
tend classes in addition to putting in their 
regular workweek receive overtime pay. 

The classes are limited to those working in 
the specified fields. However, the company 
does not limit the educational opportunities to 
what is offered on-site. 

Michael Cseay, an electrical technician in 
the medium-section mill, has been with Chap- 
arral a year and a half and has been sent to 
four different training programs in various

for Happy's benefit that proclaims, "Use a 
computer and you'll have it made. It'll do 
your homework and raise your grades. Buy a 
computer and solve your problems for real." 

Happy wants to make sure the machine 
will work before she buys it. ("A wise con- 
sumer, a quick chick," says Norton.) He 
shows her how it can help with homework. 
("Oooh, homework. Grody to the max," says 
Happy.) Then, in one of the play's most mad- 
cap scenes, Norton shows her some educa- 
tional programs — Pirates of Pronouns, Star 
Words, Star Words II: The Adverbs Strike 
Back, and finally Spelling. ("Oooh, gag me, 
my worst subject," winces Happy.) 

The next number is real cute. Norton ex- 
plains how computers are making old office 
machines useless. Three of the actors come 
out dressed as a calculator, a typewriter, and a 
file cabinet singing a mournful song. "We're 
obsolete, we can't compete. Last year's smash 
is this year's crash. We had our day and that's 
the way it is with technology." 

Happy decides that she would like a pro- 
gram that would help her find the right boy. 
Bits writes the program while, to the delight of 
the crowd, Happy picks out several young 
bachelors from the audience and lines them

He must have hair and not be into disco or 
slam dancing.") But the program has a bug 
and doesn't pick any of them for Happy. A 
computer hacker's worst fears are realized 
when two four-armed bugs emerge from the 
computer and dance around gleefully singing 
a nasty bug song. 

But writing custom programs is not exact- 
ly what Happy had in mind. ("It sounds too 
much like work. I want to have fun.") The 
games number ensues, with three giant Pac- 
Man characters dancing, singing, and chasing 
each other. It's great fun and the kids love it. 

Finally Norton pushes Happy to sign on 
the dotted line. ("All you have to do is sign 
here and we will automatically get your week- 
ly allowance of two dollars and ten cents for 
the next fifty-seven years, twenty-seven 
months, and three days.") But Happy wants

truly happy. She asks the crucial question that 
causes the machine to blow up. 

Happy is definitely not happy after "it's 
dead." ("Who's going to love me when the 
power blows?") Trying to calm her down, 
Bytes says that "when you're sad or distressed, 
people are best." An appearance by Mr. Chips 
(Robert Crow) further convinces her that she 
didn't destroy the computer, but she asked it a 
question it couldn't answer. 

Bits and Bytes, written by Michael Dixon 
and Jerry Patch, takes a refreshingly innocent 
approach to computers and manages to say 
something. Not all the jokes are readily ac- 
cessible to the children and some of the lyrics 
get buried with all the dancing and fooling 
around. Still, the overall reaction at the Glen- 
oaks School in Glendale, California, on Feb- 
ruary 22 (one of more than two hundred 
planned performances of the show) was spec- 
tacularly good. The basics of computer tech- 
nology have rarely been presented in such an 
entertaining and palatable fashion. One teach- 
er, referring to the attitude of the performers, 
commented: "If teachers could be that unin- 
hibited, the kids would learn a lot more." 

Bits and Bytes will be touring throughout 
the southern California area until June this 
year. South Coast Repertory is also distribut- 
ing a brief study guide on computers for

parts of the country. He is leaving soon for yet 
another program in Houston. 

"One thing I like about this mill," Cseay 
comments, "is they want everyone to learn." 
Cseay, a former Tandy employee, emphasizes 
the company's desire to "keep up in a hi- 
tech world." He also adds that employees in 
all areas of Chaparral get the opportunity to 
attend classes in their fields. 

A nonunionized mill (all employees are on 
salary), Chaparral does not believe in layoffs, 
company cars or planes, time clocks, execu- 
tive secretaries, or executive parking places. In 
seven short years the company has become 
one of the top twenty steel producers in the 
United States. Workers seem happy and 
they're making a little money. 

Bethlehem Steel would love to make "a lit- 
tle money."

ted. Typesetting output is produced by the 
fourth subsystem, made up of two InfoSet 400 
Pagesetters. These are devices that set fully 
made-up, illustrated, broadsheet pages, which 
are then put in front of a camera and shot into 
negatives for press plates. 

The computerized production of the 
morning paper occupies parts of three floors 
of the five-story Star-News building. On the 
first floor, classified ads, taken over the phone, 
are entered directly into the front-end sys- 
tem's data banks, called directories. A dic- 
tionary is built in, and the order of the classi- 
fieds can be determined by terminal operators 
who assemble the pages each day. Classified 
display ads are also created at make-up ter- 
minals on the same floor. 

Front-end editorial work and pagination 
is done on the third floor. On the fourth floor, 



The pagination process is still expensive for 
large newspapers, like the Los Angeles Times, 
which has a front-end system in use but is 
holding off on pagination. Advancements in 
disk-storage technology will soon make the 
system more readily available. The Los Ange- 
les Times makes in a week what the Pasadena 
Star-News makes in a year ($15 million). The 
Times also prints about fifteen hundred pages 
a week to the Star-News's three hundred to 
three hundred fifty pages. 

Still, the benefits of the pagination system 
in a medium-sized newspaper environment are 
many, according to Wiltse. "Revisions and 
corrections can be made very quickly; layout 
editors never have to rebuild anything from 
scratch. The display of line art on the screen is 
a tremendous advantage, especially when the 
art is irregularly shaped. The layout is auto- 
matic. New material is entered and simply 
flowed into position. 

"Make-up editors can take the time they 
need to get the quality they want. They're not 
looking over the shoulder of a paste-up per-

wire-service information, via satellite, comes 
straight into the computer system. The chat- 
tering Teletypes of the traditional newsroom 
are now an on-line process. 

Also on the fourth floor, in the air-condi- 
tioned and glass-walled computer center, is 
the scanner doing the scanning once done in 
the camera room of the composing depart- 
ment. The mechanical paste-up operations 
that the computer has yet to take over are also 
done on this floor. 

Production director for the Star-News, 
Les Wiltse, oversees the whole computer op- 
eration from his office on the fifth floor, as 
well as fielding calls from other papers inter- 
ested in how the system is shaking down and 
consulting with debuggers and production 
specialists working on the system's gradual 
expansion. 

The most frequently asked question, 
Wiltse says, is how much did all this cost? The 
system has a $1.9-million price tag. "Cer- 
tainly no small change for an operation with 
our revenue," says Wiltse. "But it's cost-effec- 
tive. We expect to meet our original estimate 
of a four-year payback." 



son at a drawing board in a bustling compos- 
ing room anymore." 

One of pagination's biggest advantages is 
in the area of aesthetics. "Cold type [photo- 
composition] has never been able to achieve 
the precise make-up of hot metal," Wiltse ex- 
plains. "Now we have the best of both worlds, 
the flexibility of cold type and a precision in- 
herent in a modern digital computer to keep 
gutters and margins even, headlines straight, 
and all graphic-arts elements under electronic 
control that cannot be equaled by any mere 
mortal. Nothing's going to be crooked, and 
the spacing won't be bad, and nobody's going 
to drop a line." 

"Hot metal" is a reference to the Lino- 
type machine, introduced into the publishing 
industry in the 1880s. It was a huge contrap- 
tion of belts and moving arms that rivaled the 
best work of Rube Goldberg. A skilled op- 
erator would retype a story and the machine 
would cast it into metal lines of type at a speed 
of about sixty words per minute. Linotype 
machines were used at the Star-News until 
1973.

Two-Year Program Equips Execs for the Future 



In the "information age," keeping one's 
job often requires keeping up with change. 
Blue-collar and white-collar workers alike 
may have to adapt to new technologies in our 
fast-changing, fast-paced society. Even high- 
level management will be forced into re- 
tooling and reorganizing as computer tech- 
nology provides the necessary implements of 
change. 

According to Western Behavioral Sci- 



ences Institute president Richard Farson, the 
assumptions and styles of traditional man- 
agement are no longer sufficient in modern 
businesses. Managers and executives must 
adapt to the changing times. 

The WBSI is helping executives learn to 
adapt through its School of Management and 
Strategic Studies, based in La Jolla, Califor- 
nia. The school was established to provide 
an intensive two-year educational program

for a limited number of key executives 
from business, government, and nonprofit 
organizations. 

The School of Management has enlisted 
the services of some of the nation's leading 
scholars and scientists. The objective of the 
two-year ongoing program is to get execu- 
tives to learn from the faculty and from each 
other about the changing requirements of 
leadership in the coming decades. 

Participants come from the leadership 
ranks of the private and public sectors. They 
are nominated by their sponsoring organiza- 
tions and are evaluated by WBSI to make sure 
all class members are compatible. 

The six-month course currently being 
taught is entitled "The Management of Scar- 
city and Abundance" and follows the school's 
first two, "The Private Sector and the State" 
and "Technological Progress and People," 
which were taught last year. Beginning in July 
of this year, the course will be "Globalism and 
Interdependence." Because each of the 
courses will be repeated at two-year intervals, 
participants may enter the program any time a 
new segment is beginning. 

When they begin the program, students 
meet the faculty in La Jolla for a seminar 
where they are taught the basics of computer 
teleconferencing and are given hands-on ex- 
perience with microcomputers. At the end of 
the session, each participant takes home a 
computer and a printer, which serves as a link 
to fellow students and WBSI faculty. 

By virtue of its crucial role in the School of 
Management's style of instruction, telecon- 
ferencing is one sophisticated application that 
participants are introduced to right from the 
start of the program. 

During the six months between meetings, 
participants and faculty "meet" and converse 
with each other via modem. Faculty mem- 
bers call up the central computer and, after in- 
putting their passwords, present questions and 
information drawn from their fields of exper- 
tise. Participants read this material at their lei- 
sure and can store it for printing hard copy 
later. They can also challenge the ideas given, 
offer suggestions and comments, or leave re- 
lated information based on experience for the 
rest of the group to read. 

Computer teleconferencing allows more 
than one person on the system at a time. 
When students call up, they can check to see 
who else is logged on and exchange live mes- 
sages with that person. Although participants 
can communicate via electronic mail on the 
system, allowing several users on-line at once 
lets their debate or exchange of ideas happen 
instantaneously. 

Through its courses, the School of Man- 
agement and Strategic Studies wants the stu-

dents to develop strategic thinking. Courses 
are divided into modules, each lasting three or 
four weeks and taught by an expert in the sub- 
ject. The four themes of "fundamental 
values," "context of decisions," "human sys- 
tems," and understanding "the past as pro- 
logue," are included in all the courses, acting 
as the center for discussion. The faculty mem- 
ber responsible for each topic stimulates dis- 
cussion with questions, case-history prob- 
lems, simulations, and exercises. 

Apple Computer, Anadex, and Hayes Mi- 
crocomputer donated computers, printers, 
and modems respectively for students who be- 
gan their studies at the program's inception in 
January 1982. New students now pay for their

PAGINATION 



continued from page 269 

Photocomposition revolutionized the 
composing room in the sixties. The rate at 
which the new photographic method could 
generate type in justified form was seventy-six 
hundred words a minute. Galleys of type are 
developed chemically and pasted onto boards. 
Metal press plates are made from the nega- 
tives of these page boards. This cold-type 
process is what the majority of magazines and 
newspapers use today. 

Now the photocomposition process is 
clearly threatened by the computerized com- 
posing room. "The composing room is no 
longer the beehive of activity that it was just a 
few years ago," says Wiltse. "Once, one hun- 
dred people worked in composing at the Star- 
News. With a tough stance on union negotia- 
tions, some generous offers, attrition, and 
other factors, the composing room now has 
only nine people." 

The only stumbling block to total com- 
puterization at the Star-News is a union re- 
striction involving the make-up of display ads, 
a point that is still in negotiation. 

Unions across the country are under- 
standably opposing automation of the news- 
paper business — across the board, from front- 
end editorial to the composing room. There 
was an uproar from the same sectors at the in- 
troduction of the Linotype and the photo- 
composition processes as well. Nobody likes 
losing their job, and no one knows how diffi- 
cult and expensive retraining will be until it is 
tried. 

Training new editorial and classified peo- 
ple to work on the pagination system is an in- 
house activity at the Star-News and is simpler 
than might be imagined. Trainees are sur- 
prised at how easy the system is to learn and 



operate. "New employees are given a course 
on the front-end system as soon as they are 
hired. Three days of on-the-job training fol- 
lowed by a couple of weeks of hands-on expe- 
rience at a page-make-up station is usually 
enough," says Wiltse. 

All the union tumult, retraining, and ex- 
pense aside, "Pagination is here to stay," says 
Wiltse. And that means it's time to start 
hawking all those grease pencils, pica rulers, 
and X-acto knives. 



INDUSTRY 



continued from page 265 

teaching is for a shorter duration. 

Thus far, says Hubbard, hi-tech com- 
panies have agreed to sponsor eighty of the 
two hundred fellowships, but their efforts will 
be undercut in the long run if teacher salaries 
continue to average 30 percent less than those 
offered by industry. For that reason, the AEA 
is also looking into short-term add-on grants 
to boost faculty salaries, while lobbying Con- 
gress and state houses to enlarge their com- 
mitment to computer education for salaries 
and equipment. 

Apple will be making some ten thousand 
computers available to public and private 
grade schools in California this spring under 
the tax-write-off provisions of a state bill 
passed last year. The legislation, similar to a 
measure defeated at the federal level and re- 
cently reintroduced, allows the company to 
write off the donation at twice cost or cost plus 
one-half of the unrealized profit, whichever is 
smaller. Steve Scheier, project director for 
Apple's Kids Can't Wait program, hopes local 
Apple clubs will chip in as volunteer teaching 
aides to turn their neighborhood schools into 
Apple corps. 

According to Hubbard, Apple's donation 
comes none too soon. "The whole of under- 
graduate education is in trouble," she says. In 
California, the annual capital replacement rate 
of educational equipment runs about 2 per- 
cent. If that trend continues, the equipment 
life cycle will soon be fifty-nine years. "That's 
the base," she sighs, "and it's absolutely 
antiquated." 

Hubbard is pleased that remedial steps are 
being taken, but she's concerned that the com- 
puter industry will permanently lose the serv- 
ices of many gifted students for whom there is 
inadequate teaching space today. The gap is 
too great to fill quickly, she says, and time 
may be working against us. Demographic 
trends indicate that the manpower pool that 
industry must draw on is steadily shrinking. 

"If these students today can't get into 
higher education," she warns, "there won't be 
engineers to design the products and we'll lose 
our competitive edge." 




□ Eat Your Heart Out, Woz. Get ready for 
the ME Festival. California State College, San 
Bernardino, is hosting a computer workshop 
and technology exhibit April 22-24. Semi- 
nars will feature hands-on encounters with 
microcomputers, including a special series on 
the handicapped. At least fifty industry ex- 
hibitors will display their latest wares. The ten- 
dollar workshop registration fee includes ad- 
mission to the exhibit area. ME stands for 
"microtechnology for everybody." 

□ Meanwhile, Back at the Ranch. Unuson 
is planning to hold the second and third Us 
Festivals May 28-30 and June 4-5. Both fes- 
tivals will be at the Glen Helen Regional Park 
in San Bernardino, California, the site of last 
year's well-attended extravaganza. 

□ MudWare on the Move. The rains pelting 
California this winter have paid off for N. Ur- 
ban Shocker. First tons of mud slid into 
Shocker's swimming pool. Then lightning hit 
the pool and the resultant chemical reactions 
formed a superconducting mud puddle with 
more computing power than a Cray 1. Shock- 
er copyrighted the unusual computer archi- 
tecture and plans to sell personal mud pies 
with Dirt, a unique programming language.

□ Do DROID-BUGS Dream of Electric 
People? Two of the cheaper (in cost and per- 
formance) hobby robots come from Robot 
Shack, a division of Dynamic Development, 
based in El Toro, California. PR-1 has two 
arms that rotate ninety degrees, two faces (one 
female and one male), limited hearing, a digi- 
tal clock, an optional water gun for squirting 
unfriendly people, a computer control panel, 
and a belly-button balloon inflator. Con- 
trolled by radio waves or computer pro- 
grams, PR-1 costs $499. The DROID-BUG 
from Robot Shack is a self-contained, dome- 
O 




shaped toy that moves forward until it hits an 
obstacle, then changes direction and repeats 
the process indefinitely. DROID-BUG costs 
$100. Both robots are expensive toys more 
than anything else, and they should appeal to 
children but not to many hard-core robotics 
hobbyists. 

□ And Now for the Computer Movie News. 

Columbia Pictures has acquired the rights to 
Tracy Kidder's Pulitzer Prize-winning book, 
Soul of a New Machine. The studio has not an- 
nounced any plans for the material yet. Rid- 
ing high on the success of Tootsie and Gandhi, 
Columbia is on a roll. In these days of steamy 
Richard Gere and tantalizing Sandahl Berg- 
man, it's difficult to imagine Kidder's retell- 
ing of Data General's Eagle minicomputer 
project making much of an impact on the big 
screen. But Columbia just may be the studio 
to pull it off. 

□ And on the Computer-Music Scene. Oh, 

for the days of "Heartbreak Hotel" and "The 
Twist," when rock 'n' roll was uncomplicated 
and not striving for relevance. Styx has 
brought beer-and-broads technorock to the 
eighties with a decidedly banal offering in its 
new album Kilroy Was Here. Voice-synthe- 
sized drivel about "Mr. Roboto" and rock 'n' 
roll's ability to save mankind from technoto- 
talitarianism makes this album a real earsore. 
Much more interesting is Neil Young's cow- 
boy-lament to the computer age — Trans — re- 
leased on Geffen Records, a Warner label. 
Most of the songs on the album feature syn- 
thesized sounds, including vocoderized sing- 
ing. With several keyboards, a drum ma- 
chine, and assorted digital and analog equip- 
ment, Young has fashioned a sometimes bleak 
but always interesting look at a dystopian fu- 
ture. Songs like "Computer Age," "We R in 
Control," and "Computer Cowboy" are eerie 
electronic echoes of Orwell's 1984 — decrying 
the loss of love, individuality, and livelihood. 




"Transformer Man" is an especially effective 
tune about future hero worship of a sort. This 
is one of the strongest commitments yet to the 
new digital technology by a serious rock art- 
ist. Young's fans have had to survive as many 
directions in his music as albums he's re- 
leased. Not ready to abandon his roots, 
Young will begin each show in his upcoming 
Trans tour with a solo acoustic set and then 
break out the hi-tech jingles — the same con- 
cert format he used in the immensely popular 
Rust Never Sleeps tour a few years back. 
You'll probably hear Styx's bombastic crud 
on the radio much more than Young's grand 
experiment, but don't be put off. Computers 
are drastically changing the composition and 
presentation of modern music and Young 
proves the new direction is accessible to more 
than just adolescent space cadets. 

□ No Loud Typing, Please. Interstate Com- 
puting Company has opened the Computer 
Library in Metairie, Louisiana. The Comput- 
er Library is an ambitious project, created to 
increase the public's knowledge and aware- 
ness of computer technology and how it's 
changing the world. For a yearly fee, library 
members have use of a variety of personal 
computers and a large collection of software. 
Public and member-only seminars are on the 
docket. 

□ Architects, Take Note. The Computer, a 
new annual publication for architects and en- 
gineers launched by Architectural Record, is 
scheduled for a mid-May premiere. The pub- 
lication will include articles on computers for 
architects, a directory of computer hardware 
and software service organizations, and a buy- 
er's guide. It will be distributed to some twelve 
thousand architectural firms identified as 
"million-dollar-plus companies." Ill

BY YIYIAH YAtlDE YELDE 



The back door slammed. 

"Is that you, George?" Eloise called. 

The door slam made him jump, but the 
voice made him wince.. 

"No, dear, it's Jack the Ripper," George 
whispered. 

In all the years they'd lived here, he'd al- 
ways gotten home at the same time. Yet every 
day Eloise would come in from fondling those 
miserable plants that made the veranda look 
like a tropical rain forest, slam the door, and 
ask that same pointless question. 

George's answer was also part of the ritual, 
although this time he waited a bit too long be- 
fore saying it. He was struggling to get his key 



out of the door while balancing a large, heavy 
carton, and he hadn't noticed that Eloise was 
already entering the room behind him. 

"What did you say, George?" she shouted 
into his ear. She insisted she was not hard of 
hearing but merely surrounded by people who 
wouldn't speak up. Eloise made a point of al- 
ways speaking up. 

George abandoned the key in frustration 
and turned to face his wife. "Nothing, dear. 
Yes, it's me." 

"Don't be facetious, George. Of course I 
can see it's you. What's in the box?" 

George sighed — mentally. He'd never dare 
try Eloise's patience by vocalizing it. "I told 
you I was going to stop at lunch today to pick 
up the computer." 

Disappointed, Eloise stood in his way tap- 
ping her foot. 

"Eloise, this box is heavy." 



Eloise remained unfazed in the doorway. 
"And where do you think you're putting that... 
that computer thing?" 

George drew himself a decidedly nasty men- 
tal picture, but merely nodded with his head 
toward the living room. 

"Oh no you don't," his wife said. "I don't 
want all those stupid wires and things all over 
the place." 

"There aren't a lot of wires. Eloise, please, 
my arms are breaking. " 
"In the basement." 
"Eloise—" 

"The basement, George. Or you can stand 
here holding it till your arms fall off." 

Fearing that just such an occurrence was 
imminent, George nodded. "Yes, dear." 

Eloise stepped out of his way. "I'll get the 
door for you," she offered graciously. 

"Thank you, dear," George said. 



George gingerly made his way down the basement stairs to his work- 
bench. Eloise followed but looked in no mood to help. George got the 
light switch with his shoulder. 

"Dearest," he murmured, inclining his head toward a philodendron 
she had been repotting. 

She glowered, but pushed her equipment slightly to one side. He 
eased the box down. 

"Do I have time before dinner?" he asked, knowing that she never 
started before he got home. 

Eloise glared some more. 

"Ah, good," George said; "then I can set this up." 
Again the glare. 

"Thank you very much," George said, and he began to struggle the 
computer out of its carton. 

He was surprised that she remained as he hooked everything up; he 
decided she must be intrigued in spite of herself. 

He had bought the computer with the money she had given him for 
birthdays and Christmases over the years, but she had been furious. 

"Computer?" she had said. "What would anybody want a comput- 
er for?" 

He had given several useful, albeit unlikely, possibilities. Eloise had 
stared at him blankly and he had begun to describe some of the won- 
drous things he had seen on the TV special about microcomputers. 

"Games," she had said. "You want to play games with it." 

"Well, yes, dear, I suppose I do." 

Eloise had been bitterly disappointed. She had hoped he would spend 
the money on something worthwhile, like taking her to Bermuda, but she 
could only blame herself for trusting him with the money in the first 
place. 

"Wouldn't a pocket calculator do just as well?" she had asked. 

And yet here she was watching him with a steady — even impatient — 
concentration as he set up the computer and put one of the demonstra- 
tion cartridges into his cassette recorder. She sighed loudly and frequent- 
ly as they waited for the information to be loaded. 

"Which would you prefer — infinite spiral or random squares?" 

"Oh, really, George. Get on with it." 

"Right. Infinite spiral, then," George decided and keyed in the ap- 
propriate command. 

"That's it?" Eloise asked in total disgust. 

George was so intent on the clear, beautiful image, it took several sec- 
onds for him to realize that she had spoken and then several more be- 
fore what she had said registered. 

George looked up in surprise, amazed that anybody, even Eloise, 
could fail to be charmed. 

She shook her head and turned toward the stairs. "Stupid thing," she 
muttered. But whether she meant her husband or the computer she 
didn't say. 

In the following weeks George retreated more and more to his base- 
ment room. He spent hours adapting existing games to be more 
challenging or devising his own programs. 

Drab at work, unmemorable around the neighborhood, submissive 
with his wife, he turned his computer sanctuary into an exotic world 
where heavily armed starships and ravenous dragons lurked. 

Although Eloise spent her evenings watching television or tending 
her plants, she resented the time he spent with the computer and nagged 
at him to keep her company. When he did, he'd fidget, his mind awhirl 
with complex chess moves to boggle the computer or strategies to navi- 
gate a lunar rocket to a safe landing. 

"Oh, go on, get out of here!" Eloise would finally scream. "Your 
twitching is making me crazy!" 

"Yes, dear. Thank you very much." And George would scramble to 
recheck listings and debug programs until all hours of the night. 

This had been going on for almost three months when Eloise stopped 
him as he got up from the dinner table. He was still chewing on his last 
mouthful of liver — Eloise was the only person George knew who actual- 
ly liked the stuff — and he had his hand on the basement doorknob. 

Eloise had already dismissed him, but now she said, "My sister's 
having a garage sale." 



"That's nice," George said, opening the door. 
"I'm giving her that damned computer." 

George smiled feebly. Eloise had a vicious sense of humor. 
"I mean it, George." 

George's arms and neck tingled. "Eloise," he said, trying to chuckle. 
"So enjoy it, because the sale is next Saturday." 
"Eloise!" he cried. 

"It's not open to debate," she warned. "I can't take any more of it. 
You've become obsessed." 

George wished that she would give him an "It's the computer or me" 
choice, but she didn't. She simply said the computer was on its way out. 
He tried whining and pleading — he knew it wouldn't do any good to at- 
tempt firmness — but Eloise had decided and, as always, George finally 
found himself admitting that, yes, he was wrong, and, no, he couldn't ex- 
pect Eloise to put up with that sort of behavior, and, of course, Eloise 
knew best how to handle such things. 

Devastated, he half-stumbled down the stairs and numbly turned on 
the computer. He caressed the smooth frame and ran his fingers ever so 
lightly over the keys that would respond instantly and silently to his 
touch. Damn her, anyway, he thought; she had no right to take away his 
only friend. 

The idea came to him while he was playing a game of Star Invaders. 
He was wishing he could crack the programmer's code so that he could 
change the advancing rows from alien shapes to the initial "E" for Elo- 
ise, because what he wanted more than anything else was to zap his wife. 
He suddenly surprised himself by saying — out loud — "Why not?" 

George quickly glanced over his shoulder to make sure Eloise wasn't 
within earshot — Eloise didn't approve of people talking to themselves — 
then gleefully exclaimed, "Why not, indeed! 

"This time she's gone too far," he muttered as he flipped through all 
the literature the computer store had given him with his purchase, "too 
far." He and his friendly computer were going to get rid of that med- 
dling woman together. 

George had gotten to the bottom of a formidable pile of manuals, 
pamphlets, and clippings without finding anything. 

"Help," he typed on the keyboard. 

"Syntax error," the computer's screen responded. 

"A lot of help you are." George sighed and leafed through the ad- 
vertising section of a magazine aimed at home computer operators. 

Audio recognition capability couldn't help, he decided. Neither could 
a printer. The trouble was that Eloise rarely even went into the base- 
ment. Of course, there were the days she did the laundry and George 
would find her underwear folded on top of his disk drive; and on several 
occasions he had noticed potting soil on his work papers. But she never 
actually used the computer, and George reluctantly admitted to himself 
that he wasn't likely to cajole, trick, or force her into doing so. Too bad. 
He had really set his heart on somehow killing her with the computer — 
poetic justice, he considered it. Even if it were something as mundane as 
electrocuting her with it. 

He glanced at the washing machine only a few feet away, but 
couldn't come up with anything that wouldn't destroy the computer 
along with his wife. He patted the computer reassuringly on its CRT 
screen to let it know he wouldn't do anything to endanger it. 

If he hadn't had his mind on electrocution, the ad wouldn't have 
grabbed his attention; but he had, and it did, and there was the solution 
to his problem. 

"The Home of the Future," the ad said. "Interface Your House with 
Your Home Computer." 

"Hmm," George said. He read on. 

There was a way, he discovered, to hook the computer into the elec- 
trical system. Actually, the headline was a bit hyperbolic. The system 
was actually a sophisticated timer, George realized. Program the com- 
puter and at preordained times it would do what you had keyed in. 

The ad talked about starting the furnace and water heater half an 
hour before it was time to get up, turning the lights on dim and increas- 
ing their brilliance gently, perking the coffee and toasting the bread, 
heating the electric rollers — all to help people get to work on time while 
sleeping in later. 

George tapped his finger on this line several times: "And you don't

even have to be there." 

"Preset your computer to do your work for you," the ad suggested. 
"Sprinkle the lawn. . . . Start your dinner cooking. . . ." 

"Kill your wife," George whispered. Again he looked over his shoul- 
der. He really had to stop that. 

He sat back and gnawed at a pencil. On TV they always had such 
complex ways of doing such things. But how? How? 

George's imagination had never been fertile, and years of living with 
Eloise had dried it out even more. By 3:30 he had only come up with one 
practicable possibility. It wasn't as flashy as he would have liked; but it 
would do. 

One of the things about Eloise that had always grated on his nerves 
was that she was so predictable. There was never any room for variance 
in her life. Now that very trait would work to his benefit. 

George knew that whenever Eloise was upset she would take a long, 
hot bubble bath. He could call her from work (the alibi) and say some- 
thing totally unexpected and rude that would disturb her. She would get 
in the tub (the scene of the crime) for one of her hour-long soaks. There 
was a shelf over the tub where she kept her paraphernalia — including the 
blowdryer (the weapon!) which he would have already computer-set to 
turn on at a certain time (the modus operandi). The vibration would cause 
the dryer to drop into the water, and that, he was pleased to visualize, 
would be that. 

If the computer store hadn't had the equipment in stock, George 
would have been lost. As it was, he had withdrawn all the money 
from their savings account and even cashed a couple of savings bonds. If 
Eloise had known, George thought with grim satisfaction, she would 
have killed him. 

George spent the next two days installing the system and checking 
the program for any bugs. He didn't have time to play any of his usual 
computer games, but he consoled himself by planning all the wonderful- 
ly rude things he could say to Eloise in that phone conversation on the 
big day. He thought of this as a new game, his magnum opus, and he had 
to have a routine for every contingency. 

Finally, on Thursday, all was ready. That morning George could 
barely keep from whistling as he shaved. Leaving the bathroom, he noted 
that the hair dryer was in place exactly where he wanted it. 

Next, he skipped breakfast. (Eloise believed in breakfast, but she nev- 
er got up early enough to check on him. Still, he had never tried crossing 
her before.) 

When he went into the basement, he found a Swedish ivy plant on 
top of his computer. 

"Why does she always have to do that?" he hissed. He picked up the 
pot by the plant itself and smashed it on the edge of his workbench. Then 
he loaded in the program that would make the dryer start blowing at 
exactly 3:17. 

"It's just you and me, kid," he said in his best Bogart, which wasn't 
very like Bogart at all. He patted the computer affectionately. 

George called Eloise at 3:00. 
"About my computer," he started without even saying hello. 

"Yes?" 

"You're not selling it." 

"I beg your pardon?" Eloise said in the tone that always made him 
lose at least three inches from his already meager height. 

"That's my computer, which / bought with my money, and from now 
on I plan to do what I want and you will kindly keep your nasty little 
nose and your fat, ugly sister out of my business." 

George noticed that everyone in the office had suddenly become very 
busy. 

"George!" Eloise gasped. 

"And you know what else?" George added. "I broke your goddamn 
Swedish ivy." He slammed the phone down, then picked it up instantly. 
Without even checking to see if they had been disconnected, he 
screamed, "On purpose!" and slammed down the phone again. 

George glanced around the office. Everyone was pretending to be un- 
aware of what had happened, although those who sat farthest away had 
maneuvered themselves within better hearing range. 



That argument had served two purposes. He was counting on it send- 
ing Eloise into a frenzy, and it had also made people aware of his pres- 
ence at the office at the time of her death. George sometimes suspected 
that he could miss a week or two of work without anyone noticing that 
he wasn't around. But they all noticed him today. He tried to stifle a 
smile as he bent over a lengthy report. "George?" he imagined everyone 
saying. "Oh, yes, he was here at 3:00. 1 remember because he had a fight 
with his wife and now he's heartbroken about it." 

George worked on thinking heartbroken but kept breaking into 
chuckles that he'd disguise by clearing his throat. By quitting time he 
sounded like a man on the edge of pneumonic collapse. 

"Feel like a beer on the way home?" George asked a co-worker. He 
and the colleague always walked in the same direction, but they had al- 
ways done so separately before. "I had a bit of a tiff with the missis and I 
sort of need a bracer. We could stop in at the Windmill." 

The man looked desperate to find a suitable excuse. "No," he finally 
said. "Sorry, I can't." He scurried out ahead of George and went home a 
different way. 

George stopped for a beer anyway. Eloise hated the smell of the stuff 
and wouldn't allow him to have any. He had once had one glass at a 
wedding and Eloise had complained for a week. George smiled and or- 
dered a second. 

A middle-aged woman who looked as if she had been there for some 
time already was sitting on a stool next to where he stood. 
"Nice place," he observed. 

The woman glanced at him disinterestedly. "Hmmph." 
"Come here often?" 

Her look was somewhat suspicious this time but her answer was the 
same. "Hmmph." 
"Real nice place." 

"Drop dead," she said and moved down a stool. 
George decided it was time to go home. 

He entered by the basement door. Not a sound could be heard from 
upstairs, but there was a pungent, burnt-out smell throughout the house. 
He glanced at his watch. It was almost an hour past his usual time. What 
would Eloise have said? He couldn't guess, for in all these years he had 
never been late before. Eloise wanted him to be punctual. 

"But from now on, we can do whatever we want!" he shouted to his 
computer. 

Then he switched on the light. 

He gave a wordless cry. The computer was still smoking, its power 
supply impenetrable in metal housing. The keys were half melted into 
each other and the whole right side of the console had oozed in on itself. 

"What did she do to you?" he screamed. He put his hand out to the 
charred plastic and burned his fingers. 

He jumped back and landed in a puddle. The plastic couldn't have 
melted that much, he knew. He bent down. It was ordinary water. 

The phone call must have been too much, he decided. Instead of sim- 
ply heading for the bathtub, Eloise must have thrown a bucket of water 
on his beloved computer. 

He dropped to his knees and raised his eyes to heaven. It was then 
that he realized what had really happened. 

His wife's Swedish ivy — the one he had smashed — had been picked 
up off the floor. It had been tenderly — George knew how gentle she 
could be with her plants — placed in a new clay pot and replanted. And 
then, without maliciousness but simply to help it overcome the trauma its 
violent unrooting had caused, Eloise had saturated the soil and hung the 
pot by the one basement window that offered good light — the one di- 
rectly above his computer. 

The damage wouldn't have been so bad if George hadn't left the 
power on to run his program. Instead of simply being water-damaged, all 
the chips had shorted out. As George watched, another drop of water 
gathered at one of the holes in the bottom of the pot. The drop elon- 
gated for an unbearably long moment, then fell, sizzling as it hit his 
computer. 

He thought the sound would make him weep; but then he heard 
something worse. 

The back door slammed. 

"Is that you, George?" Eloise called. m

It's time for a quiz to find out how many of you have been paying at- 
tention in class and doing your homework. Your score won't count 
against your final grade, so don't panic and don't look at your neigh- 
bors' papers. They probably don't know either. 

1. What was the main thrust behind simplifying the architecture of 
the Apple He? 

2. What well-known microcomputer hardware company has never 
been able to produce applications software that would lead its own mar- 
ket in sales? 

3. Other than spreadsheets — read that VisiCalc — what one category 
of software is always found among the top four positions in the Top 
Thirty? 

See, that wasn't so hard, was it? Now let's check your answers. 

1. The streamlined motherboard was intended to facilitate mass 
manufacturing. A simple test can be conducted to observe the effective- 
ness of this strategy. Walk into any Apple dealer and try to buy an Ap- 
ple He. Hear your dealer's response and then figure out whether you 
want to wait that long before taking delivery. 

Yes, dear hearts. For all that the good folks at Apple strove mightily 
to design you a makable machine, they can't make them fast enough. 
They're selling forty thousand a month of the newfangled version; even 
streamlined manufacturing processes can't keep up with the demand. 

So much for industrial design.

one. But this is an Apple text, which should have been hint enough to 
dredge that hallowed name from some dark recess of your mind. Since 
time immemorial — or at least since early 1980 — Apple has been unable 
to write software with the best of the independent software vendors. 
Those gloaters who got this one right will have to relearn their history, 
however, because Apple is no longer the correct answer. 

Remember those forty thousand machines a month mentioned in an- 
swer 1? What do you think is happening to them? A hint: They aren't 
playing Little Brick Out. Many of them are busily engaged in word proc- 
essing, using Apple Writer II. So many new machines are so occupied 
that Apple Writer He walked away from the rest of the pack in Feb- 
ruary, thus becoming the first Apple software product to head the Top 
Thirty. 

That might be a more impressive statistic if Apple hadn't had the 
home-court advantage in developing specific software for the He. Never- 



theless, A WII dethroned Choplifter to reign supreme in the first full 
month of He sales. 

3. If you answered this with a specific genre of games, you could 
lose. But if you just answered entertainment software, you get full credit 
and another chance to relearn history. 

Referring back to those aforementioned forty thousand new Apples 
in February, another thing they aren't doing besides playing Little Brick 
Out is playing anything in great numbers. What we're looking at is the 
silicon-implanting of the small-business set. 

Not only was A WII first; VisiCalc was second, PFS: File was third, 
and Honte Accountant was fourth. Nary a game in the bunch unless you

take it upon yourself to try to make the four leaders interchange data. 
That'd be more challenging than Repton and more frustrating than play- 
ing Strip Poker in a nudist colony. 

Slowness in entertainment software was a central theme among deal- 
ers, with each offering a different analysis. A southern dealer put forth 
inventiveness — more specifically, the lack thereof — as the reason for the 
sales slowdown. In his thinking, there's been little exciting and different 
software to spark a buying spree. His diagnosis: galactic gobs of enervat- 
ing ennui. 

A midwestern dealer felt price was the key factor. He's noted consid- 
erably greater resistance to the high price of entertainment software late- 
ly and believes Penguin's ten-dollar price reduction is a start in the right 
direction. Another way of phrasing his comment is that programming 
artistry is no longer sufficient unto itself to ensure snappy sales — the

game should be priced competitively with other entertainments of a fleet- 
ing nature. 

Whatever the reason, entertainment software took it on the chin in 
February. Nine of the Business 10 programs made the Top Thirty, the 
largest such penetration ever, as new owners embraced the revamped 
Apple as a worthy business machine. 

That doesn't necessarily imply that publishers of applications soft- 
ware were getting rich while the entertainment publishers lined up at the 
poorhouse. Nobody will retire off the February earnings. Valentine's 
month may be great for Hallmark, but it's traditionally a bummer for 
software, and this year was no different. One of the burning questions is 
what those forty thousand new owners are running other than a He 
product demo disk.

1985 WAS NOT A VERY GOOD YEAR. 

THE RUSSIANS INVADED GERMANY, 
STORMED THE PERSIAN GULF, 
ATTACKED NORWAY, AND 
OVERRAN THE BALTIC. 




INTRODUCING OUR NEW SERIES OF WARGAMES: 

WHEN SUPERPOWERS COLLIDE! 



SS/ has just turned the Cold War into 
a very hot one. We've produced an 
entire line of wargames under the title: 
WHEN SUPERPOWERS COLLIDE.* Each 
game in the series presents a different 
scenario of probable U.S.-Russia con- 
frontations in various parts of the world. 

The first four releases are GERMANY 
1985," RDF" (in the Persian Gulf), 
NORWAY 1985," and BALTIC 1985." 

Designed by Roger Keating, creator of 
SSI's highly-acclaimed SOUTHERN COM- 
MAND " these strategy simulations boast 
the same successful look and play as 
his previous masterpiece: beautiful color 
graphic displays, easy-to-use movement 
system and realistic combat rules. 

In GERMANY 1985, battalions of 
Soviet infantry, tanks, artillery units, and 



'48K disc lor the Apple II with Applesoft ROM card. 



paratroopers have breached the southern 
center of West Germany through the 
Fulda Gap. NATO forces must contain 
and repel the Red invasion. 

We've introduced several innovative 
rules to this game: Speed of movement . 
is inversely proportional to the number 
of enemy units that can see you: smoke 
screens can be called upon to help cover 
an attack or retreat; and the concepts 
of HQ units, divisional integrity, and air 
superiority are fully incorporated. 

For improved payability, the computer 
can actually move and fire for you. For 
example, if you wish to move from point 
A to B, simply order the computer and it 



will move the designated units along the 
most efficient path — stopping whenever 
enemy units are encountered. Or you 
can have the computer direct your 
artillery fire for you. In the solitaire 
mode, the computer can play either the 
Soviet or U.S. side. 

GERMANY 1985 (at $59.95) is more 
than the standard bearer for our new 
series. Its rulebook contains all the rules 
for the rest of the line.. ..which are priced 
at just $34.95 each! What you've got 
are four great modern wargames at 
unbeatable prices!

outcome of battle when superpowers 
collide, look for GERMANY 1985 " and

There were some interesting developments, however, that bear 
watching. 

Definitely the most-impacted list by the introduction of the He was 
the Word Processing 10. Even though other publishers got some lead 
time in getting their packages ready for the switchover, they weren't at all 
prepared to compete with Apple's marketing and distribution push. 

Screen Writer II was impacted the most. It's been bouncing around 
the top ten for several months, but trailed off to fourteenth in February. 

The fates were even cruder to Word Handler. It's been making steady 
progress through the ranks until, in December, it looked ready to make a 
real run at Screen Writer II for top dog. In February, it edged past 
Screen Writer II, only to see Apple Writer II farther ahead than Screen 
Writer II had ever been. 

WordStar, because of the presence of 64K standard, and Bank Street 
Writer, because it was ready for the change in systems, also benefited in 
February. 

Another Apple product also made waves after the intro of the lie. 
Quick File, which resembles a mature File Cabinet more than any other 
program, burst on the scene and supplanted Multiplan as the third- 
ranked business title. Multiplan was unable to gain further ground on 
VisiCalc as VisiCorp unveiled a special He edition of that program to en- 
tice buyers. 

Home Accountant maintained a dominant position among Home 10 
programs, but it hasn't been able to shake two dogged competitors — The 
Accountant and Chequemate. The annual invasion of privacy by the IRS

headed by Micro Lab's Tax Manager. 

That old war-horse, DOS Boss, went to the top of the Hobby 10 list, 
which seemed particularly down in comparison to other categories. Mer- 
lin, Apple Pascal, and Utility City joined that list. 

MasterType still heads the Home Education 10, but it's Early Games

Bag of TricKs 

By Don Worth and Pieter Lechner 



TM 




Now there is more from the authors of the best selling book Beneath 
Apple DOS— four comprehensive utility programs on diskette and 
over 100 more pages of valuable information about the Apple ll's 
disk operating system. 

BAG OF TRICKS is useful to beginners and experienced programmers 
alike. It includes many "hand holding" tutorials that assist you in 
repairing damaged diskettes and allow you to change sector ordering, 
reconstruct blown catalogs, etc. etc. etc. At the low price of S39.95, 
BAG OF TRICKS is one of the best software values ever 

The four programs and their functions are. 

1. TRAX dumps and examines a raw track, either 13-sector or 16- 
sector, displays the internal Apple diskette formatting 
information, and flags exceptions to standard formats. 

2 INIT will reformat one or more tracks, attempting to preserve 
the contents of undamaged sectors. It also allows you to change 
sector order. This can cut disk access times by 40% or more! 

3 ZAP is a sector editor like no other! More than 50 commands are 
available to assist you to locate, compare, change, or print the 
data on your diskettes. ZAP is even programmable! Using 
powerful macros, it is possible to transfer and compare DOS 
CP/M, or PASCAL files 

4. FIXCAT automates the process of repairing a damaged diskette 
catalog. It operates with or without user intervention, locating 
"lost" files and rebuilding the catalog— from scratch if necessary! 
DOS removal and VTOC repair are also possible.

ton dealer is using the program to sell systems. That's the highest praise a 
dealer can give a piece of software. 

A pple Writer III got a boost from the attention paid to its little broth- 
er and moved past Word Juggler in the most significant change on the 
Apple III list. VisiCalc Advanced Version continues to dominate. 

Among arcade games, Choplifter narrowly held off Miner 2049er for 
top spot. Seafox and Super Taxman 2 joined an otherwise little-chang- 
ing list. Snack Attack failed to make the Top Thirty for the first time in 
fifteen months. 

The top three Fantasy 5 games retained their positions, but Knight of 
Diamonds fell out of the Top Thirty for the first time since its introduc- 
tion. Don Worth's remake of Beneath Apple Manor scored the bottom 
rung of the list. 

Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 7.6 percent of all sales of 
Apple and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in March to ascertain their sales for the month of 
February. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was the number of units sold — such other 
criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer store, and personal 
preference of the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in March represented every geographical area of the continental United 
States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index 
number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is an 
arbitrary measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are correla- 
tive only for the month in which they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index 
rating of 50 in one month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in another 
month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus or minus 3.67 percent, which translates roughly 
into the theoretical possibility of a change of 4.11 points, plus or minus, in any index 
number.

The Mask of the Sun ousted Zork I for first in the adventure cate- 
gory, but Infocom still had three of the top five programs. Rounding out 
the top five is Sherwood Forest from Phoenix Software. 

Castle Wolfenstein maintained the lead in the Strategy 5 division, but 
the big change was lower down, where Chess 7.0 from Odesta overtook 
Sargon II by a narrow margin. 

One last quiz question: What's the difference between VisiCalc and 
VisiCalc Ilel 

If you answered, "Nothing," you agree with Softalk's pretentious 
sage, who decreed that the programs should be tracked together. Like- 
wise with Apple Writer, PFS: File, and other software with split person- 
alities. But don't believe that when you go into a store to buy. 1M
